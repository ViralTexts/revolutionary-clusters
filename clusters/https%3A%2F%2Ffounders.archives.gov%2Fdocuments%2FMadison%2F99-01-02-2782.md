				Department of State March 5th. 1808  
					  
					I have had the honor to receive and lay before the President your letter of the 26th. January, in which you state that you are &quot;expressly precluded by your instructions from entering upon any negotiation for the adjustment of the differences arising from  
						the encounter of His Britannic Majesty’s ship Leopard and the Frigate of the United States the Chesapeake, as long as the Proclamation of the President of the 2d. of July 1807 shall be in force.&quot;  
					This demand Sir, might justly suggest the simple answer, that before the Proclamation of the President could become a subject of consideration, satisfaction should be made for the acknowledged aggression which preceded it. This is evidently agreeable to the  
						order of time, to the order of reason, and, it may be added, to the order of usage as maintained by Great Britain, whenever in analagous cases, she has been the complaining party.  
					But as you have subjoined to the preliminary demand, certain explanations with a view doubtless to obviate such an answer, it will best accord with the candor of the President, to meet them with such a review of the whole subject as will present the solid  
						grounds on which he regards such a demand, as inadmissible.  
					I begin with the occurrences from which the Proclamation of July 2d. resulted. These are in general terms referred to by the instrument itself. A more particular notice of the most important of them, will there be in place.  
					Passing over then, the habitual but minor irregularities of His Britannic Majesty’s ships of war, in making the hospitalities of our ports subservient to the annoyance of our trade, both outward and inward, a practice not only contrary to the principles of  
						public law, but expressly contrary to British ordinances enforced during maritime wars to which she bore a neutral relation, I am constrained, unwelcome as the task is, to call your attention to the following more prominent instances.  
					In the summer of the year 1804, the British frigate the Cambrian with other cruizers in company, entered the harbour of New York. The commander, Capt. Bradley, in violation of the port laws relating both to health and revenue, caused a merchant vessel just  
						arrived, and confessedly within the limits and under the authority of the UStates to be boarded by persons under his command, who, after resisting the officers of the port in the legal exercise of their functions, actually impressed and carried off a number of seamen and  
						passengers, into the service of the ships of war. On an appeal to his voluntary respect for the laws, he first failed to give up the offender to justice, and finally repelled the officer charged with the regular process for the purpose.  
					This procedure was not only a flagrant insult to the Sovereignty of the Nation, but an infraction of its neutrality also, which did not permit a belligerent ship thus to augment its force within the neutral territory.  
					To finish the scene, this commander went so far as to declare, in an official letter, to the Minister Plenipotentiary of His Britannic Majesty and by him communicated to this Government that he considered his ship, whilst lying in the harbour of New York as  
						having dominion around her, within the distance of her buoys.  
					All these circumstances were duly made known to the British Government, in just expectation of honorable reparation. None has ever been offered. Capt. Bradley was advanced from his frigate to the commands of a ship of the line.  
					At a subsequent period, several British frigates under the Command of Capt. Whitby of the Leander, pursuing the practice of vexing the inward and outward trade of our ports and hovering for that purpose about the entrance of that of N. York closed a series  
						of irregularities, with an attempt to arrest a coasting vessel, on board of which an American Citizen was killed by a cannon ball which entered the vessel whilst within less than a mile from the shore.  
					The blood of a citizen thus murdered, in a trade from one to another port of his own Country, and within the sanctuary of its territorial jurisdiction, could not fail to arouse the sensibility of the public and to make a solemn appeal to the justice of the  
						British Government. The case was presented moreover to that Government by this in the accent which it required; and with due confidence that the offender would receive the exemplary punishment which he deserved. That there might be no failure of legal proof of a fact  
						sufficiently notorious of itself unexceptionable witnesses to establish it were sent to Great Britain at the expence of the UStates.  
					Capt. Whitby was notwithstanding honorably acquitted; no animadversion took place on any other officer belonging to the Squadron; nor has any apology or explanation been made since the trial was over, as a conciliatory offering to the disappointment of this  
						Country at such a result.  
					A case of another character occurred in the month of Sept. 1806. The Impetueux, a french ship of 74 guns, when aground within a few hundred yards of the shore of North Carolina, and therefore visibly within the territorial jurisdiction and hospitable  
						protection of the United States, was fired upon, boarded and burnt, from three British ships of war, under the command of Capt. Douglass. Having completed this outrage on the Sovereignty and neutrality of the United States, the British Commander felt no scruple in proceeding  
						thence into the waters near Norfolk, nor in the midst of the hospitalities enjoyed by him to add to what had passed a refusal to discharge from his ship, impressed Citizens of the UStates not denied to be such, on the plea that the Government of the U States had refused to  
						surrender to the demand of Admiral Berkley, certain seamen alleged to be British deserters; a demand which it is well understood your Government disclaims any right to make.  
					It would be very superfluous to dwell on the features which mark this aggravated insult. But I must be permitted to remind you that in so serious a light, was a similar violation of neutral territory, by the destruction of certain French ships on the coast  
						of Portugal, by a British squadron under the command of Admiral Boscawan, regarded by the Court of Great Britain that a Minister Extraordinary was despatched for the express purpose of expiating the aggression on the Sovereignty of a friendly power.  
					Lastly presents itself, the attack by the British ship of War Leopard, on the American frigate Chesapeake, a case too familiar in all its circumstances to need a recital of any part of them. It is sufficient to remark that the conclusive evidence which this  
						event added to that which had preceded, of the uncontrouled excesses, of the British Naval Commanders, in insulting our sovereignty, and abusing our hospitality, determined the President to extend to all British armed ships, the precaution heretofore applied to a few by name,  
						of interdicting to them the use and privileges of our harbours and waters.  
					This was done by his proclamation of July 2 1807, referring to the series of occurrences, ending with the aggression on the Frigate Chesapeake, as the considerations requiring it. And if the apprehension from the licencious spirit of the British naval  
						commanders, thus developed and uncontrouled, which led to this measure of precaution, could need other justification than was afforded by what had passed, it would be amply found in the subsequent conduct of the Ships under the command of the same Capt. Douglass.  
					This Officer neither admonished by reflections on the crisis produced by the attack on the Chesapeake, nor controuled by respect for the law of Nations, or the laws of the land, did not cease within our waters to bring to by firing at vessels pursuing their  
						regular course of trade; and in the same spirit which had displayed itself in the recent outrage committed on the American frigate he not only indulged himself in hostile threats and in indications of a hostile approach to Norfolk, but actually obstructed our Citizens in the  
						ordinary communication between that and neighbouring places. His proceedings constituted in fact, a blockade of the port, and as real an invasion of the Country, according to the extent of his force, as if troops had been debarked, and the town besieged on the land side.  
					Was it possible for the Chief Magistrate of a nation who felt for its rights and its honor to do less than interpose some measure of precaution at least against the repetition of enormities which had been so long uncontrouled, by the Government whose  
						officers had committed them, and which had at last taken the exorbitant shape of hostility and of insult seen in the attack on the Frigate Chesapeake? Candor will pronounce that less could not be done; and it will as readily admit that the proclamation,  
						comprizing that measure could not have breathed a more temperate spirit, nor spoken in a more becoming tone. How far it has received from those, whose intrusions it prohibited the respect due to the national authority, or been made the occasion of new indignities needs no  
						explanation.  
					The President having interposed this precautionary interdict lost no time in instructing the Minister Plenipotentiary of the UStates to represent to the British Govt. the signal aggression which had been committed on their Sovereignty and their flag and to  
						require the satisfaction due for it; indulging the expectation that His Britannic Majesty would at once perceive it to be the truest magnanimity as well as the strictest justice to offer that prompt and full expiation of an acknowledged wrong which would reestablish and  
						improve both in fact and in feeling, the state of things which it had violated.  
					This expectation was considered as not only honorable to the sentiments of His Majesty, but was supported by known examples, in which, being the complaining party, he had required and obtained, as a preliminary to any counter complaints whatever, a precise  
						replacement of things, in every practicable circumstance in their preexisting situation.  
					Thus in the year 1764 Bermudians and other British subjects, who had according to annual custom, taken possession of Turks Island for the season of making salt, having been forcibly removed with their vessels and effects by a french detachment from the  
						Island of St. Domingo, to which Turks Island was alleged to be an appurtenance, the British Ambassador at Paris, in pursuance of instructions from his Government, demanded, as a satisfaction for the violence committed, that the proceedings should be disavowed, the intention  
						of acquiring Turks Island disclaimed orders given for the immediate abandonment of it on the part of the French, every thing restored to the condition in which it was at the time of the aggression, and reparation made of the damages which any British subjects should be found  
						to have sustained, according to an estimation to be settled, between the Governors of St. Domingo and Jamaica. A compliance with the whole of this demand was the result.  
					Again:-- In the year 1789 certain English Merchants having opened a trade at Nootka sound on the Northwest coast of America, and attempted a settlement at that place, the Spaniards who had long claimed that part of the world as their exclusive property,  
						dispatched a frigate from Mexico, which captured two English vessels engaged in the trade, and broke up the settlement on the coast. The Spanish Government was the first to complain, in this case, of the intrusions committed by the British Merchants. The British Government  
						however demanded that the vessels taken by the Spanish frigate should be restored, and adequate satisfaction granted, previous to any other discussion.  
					This demand prevailed; the Spanish Government agreeing to make full restoration of the captured vessels, and to indemnify the parties interested in them for the losses sustained. They restored also the buildings and tracts of land of which the British  
						subjects had been dispossessed. The British however soon gave a proof of the little value they set on the possession by a voluntary dereliction under which it has since remained.  
					The case which will be noted last, tho’ of a date prior to the case of Nootka sound, is that of Falklands Islands. These Islands lie about 100 leagues Eastward of the straights of Magellan. The title to them had been a subject of controversy among several  
						of the maritime nations of Europe. From the position of the Islands and other circumstances, the pretension of Spain bore an advantageous comparison with those of her competitors. In the year 1770 the British took possession of Port Egmont in one of the Islands; the Spaniards  
						being at the time in possession of another part; and protesting against a settlement by the British. The protest being without effect, ships and troops were sent from Buennos Ayres by the Governor of that place, which forcibly dispossessed and drove off the British  
						settlers.  
					The British Government looking entirely to the dispossession by force, demanded as a specific condition of preserving harmony between the two Courts, not only the disavowal of the Spanish proceedings; but that the affairs of that settlement should be  
						immediately restored to the precise state in which they were previous to the act of dispossession. The Spanish Government made some difficulties; requiring particularly a disavowal on the part of Great Britain of the conduct of her officer at Falklands Islands, which, it was  
						alleged, gave occasion to the steps taken by the Spanish Governor; and proposing an adjustment by mutual stipulations in the ordinary forms.  
					The reply was that the moderation of his Britannic Majesty having limited his demand to the smallest reparation he could accept for the injury done, nothing was left for discussion but the mode of carrying the disavowal and restitution into execution; reparation losing its value if it be conditional, and to be obtained by any stipulation whatever from the party injured.  
					The Spanish Government yielded. The violent proceedings of its officers were disavowed. The fort, the port and every thing else were agreed to be immediately restored to the precise situation which had been disturbed; and duplicates of orders issued for the  
						purpose to the Spanish Officers, were delivered into the hands of one of the British principal Secretaries of State. Here again it is to be remarked that satisfaction having been made for the forcible dispossession, the Islands lost their importance in the eyes of the British  
						Government, were in a short time finally evacuated, and Port Egmont remains with every other part of them in the hands of Spain.  
					Could stronger pledges have been given, than are here found that an honorable and instant reparation would be made in a case, differing no otherwise from those recited, than as it furnished to the same monarch of a great nation, an opportunity to prove,  
						that adhering always to the same immutable principle, he was as ready to do right to others, as to require it for himself.  
					Returning to the instructions given to the Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States at London, I am to observe that the President, thought it just and expedient to insist as a necessary ingredient in the adjustment of the outrage committed on the  
						American frigate, a security against the future practice of British Naval Commanders, in impressing from Merchant vessels of the UStates on the high seas, such of their crews, as they might undertake to denominate British subjects.  
					To this association of the two subjects, the President was determined, first by his regarding both as resting on kindred principles; the immunity of private ships, with the known exceptions made by the law of nations, being as well established as that of  
						public ships; and there being no pretext for including in these exceptions the impressment (if it could be freed from its enormous and notorious abuse) of the subjects of a belligerent by the officers of that belligerent. The rights of a belligerent against the ships of a  
						neutral nation, accrue merely from the relation of the neutral to the other belligerent, as in conveying to him contraband of war or in supplying a blockaded port.  
					The claim of a belligerent to search for and seize on board neutral vessels on the high seas, persons under his allegiance; does not therefore rest on any belligerent right under the law of nations, but on a prerogative derived from municipal law; and  
						involves the extravagant supposition that one nation has a right, to execute at all times and in all cases, its municipal laws and regulations, on board the ships of another nation not being within its territorial limits.  
					The President was led to the same determination 2d. by his desire of converting a particular incident, into an occasion for removing another, and more extensive source of danger to the harmony of the two Countries. And 3dly. by his persuasion, that the  
						liberality of the propositions authorized with this view, would not fail to induce the ready concurrence of His Britannic Majesty; and that the more extensive source of irritation and perplexity, being removed, a satisfactory adjustment of the particular incident would be the  
						less difficult. The President still thinks that such would have been the tendency of the mode for which he had provided, and he cannot therefore but regret that the door was shut against the experiment, by the peremptory refusal of Mr. Canning to admit it into discussion,  
						even in the most informal manner, as was suggested by Mr. Monroe.  
					The President felt the greater regret as the step he had taken towards a more enlarged and lasting accommodation, became thus a bar to the adjustment of the particular and recent aggression which had been committed against the UStates. He found however an  
						alleviation, in the signified purpose of His Britannic Majesty to charge with this adjustment, a special mission to the United States, which, restricted as it was, seemed to indicate a disposition from which a liberal and conciliatory arrangement of one great object at least  
						might be confidently expected.  
					In this confidence, your arrival was awaited with every friendly solicitude; and our first interview having opened the way by an acquiescence in the separation of the two cases insisted on by his Britannic Majesty, notwithstanding the strong grounds on  
						which they had been united by the President, it was not to be doubted that a tender of the satisfaction claimed by the UStates for a distinguished and an acknowledged insult, by one of his officers would immediately follow.  
					It was not therefore without a very painful surprize that the error of this expectation was discovered. Instead of the satisfaction due from the original aggressor, it was announced that the first step towards the adjustment must proceed from the party  
						injured; and your letter now before me, formally repeats, that as long as the proclamation of the President which issued on the 2d. July 1807 shall be in force, it will be an insuperable obstacle to a negotiation even on the subject of the aggression which preceded it; in  
						other words, that the proclamation must be put out of force before an adjustment of the aggression can be taken into discussion.  
					In explaining the grounds of this extraordinary demand, it is alleged to be supported by the consideration that the proceeding and pretension of the offending officer, has been disavowed: that general assurances are given of a disposition and intention in  
						His Britannic Majesty to make satisfaction; that a special Minister was dispatched with promptitude for the purpose of carrying into effect this disposition: and that you have a personal conviction that the particular terms, which you are not at liberty previously to  
						disclose, will be deemed by theU States satisfactory.  
					With respect to the disavowal it would be unjust not to regard it as a proof of candor and Amity towards the United States, and as some presage, of the voluntary reparation which it implied to be due. But the disavowal can be the less confounded with the  
						reparation itself; since it was sufficiently required by the respect which Great Britain owed to her own honor; it being impossible that an enlightened Government, had hostility been meditated, would have commenced it in such a manner, and in the midst of existing professions  
						of peace and friendship. She owed it also to consistency with the disavowal on a former occasion in which the pretensions had been enforced by a British Squadron against the sloop of War Baltimore belonging to the United States; and finally to the interest which Great Britain  
						has more than any other nation in disclaiming a principle which would expose her superior number of ships of war, to so many indignities from inferior navies.  
					As little can the general assurances that reparation would be made, claim a return which could properly follow the actual reparation only. They cannot amount to more than a disposition, or at most a promise to do what the aggressor may deem a fulfilment of  
						his obligation. They do not prove even a disposition to do what may be satisfactory to the injured party, who cannot have less than an equal right to decide on the sufficiency of the redress.  
					In dispatching a special Minister for the purpose of adjusting the difference, the U States ought cheerfully to acknowledge all the proof it affords on the part of His Britannic Majesty of his pacific views towards them, and of his respect for their  
						friendship. But whilst they could not, under any circumstances, allow to the measure more than a certain participation in an honorable reparation, it is to be recollected that the avowed and primary object of the Mission was to substitute for the more extended adjustment  
						proposed by the United States, at London a separation of the subjects as preferred by His Britannic Majesty, and you well know Sir, how fully this object was accomplished.  
					With respect to the personal conviction which you have expressed, that the terms which you decline to disclose would be satisfactory to the UStates, it is incumbent on me to observe that with the highest respect for your judgment and the most perfect  
						confidence in your sincerity, an insuperable objection manifestly lies, to the acceptance of a personal and unexplained opinion in place of a disclosure which would enable this Government to exercise its own judgment in a case affecting so essentially its honor and its  
						rights. Such a course of proceeding would be without example; and there can be no hazard in saying that one will never be afforded by a Government which respects itself as much as yours justly does; and therefore can never be reasonably expected from one which respects itself  
						as much as this has a right to do.  
					I forbear Sir, to enlarge on the intrinsic incongruity of the expedient proposed. But I must be allowed to remark as an additional admonition of the singular and mortifying perplexity in which a compliance might involve the President, that there are in the  
						letter of Mr. Canning, communicating to Mr. Monroe the special mission to the UStates, pregnant indications that other questions, and conditions may have been contemplated which would be found utterly irreconcilable with the sentiments of this nation.  
					If neither any nor all of these considerations can sustain the preliminary demand made in your communication, it remains to be seen whether such a demand rests with greater advantage on the more precise ground on which you finally seem to place it.  
					The proclamation is considered as a hostile measure, and a discontinuance of it as due to the discontinuance of the aggression which led to it.  
					It has been sufficiently shewn that the proclamation, as appears on the face of it was produced by a train of occurrences terminating in the attack on the American frigate, and not by the last alone. To a demand therefore that the proclamation  
							be revoked, it would be perfectly fair to oppose a demand that redress be first given for the numerous irregularities which preceded the aggression on the American frigate, as well as for this particular aggression, and that effectual controul be  
						interposed against repetitions of them. And as no such redress has been given for the past notwithstanding the lapse of time which has taken place, nor any such security for the future, notwithstanding the undiminished reasonableness of it, it follows, that a continuance of  
						the proclamation would be consistent with an entire discontinuance of one only of the occurrences from which it proceeded.  
					But it is not necessary to avail the argument of this view of the case, altho’ of itself entirely conclusive. Had the proclamation been founded on the single aggression committed on the Chesapeake, and were it admitted that the discontinuance of that  
						aggression merely, gave a claim to the discontinuance of the proclamation, the claim would be defeated, by the incontestable fact, that that aggression has not been discontinued. It has never ceased to exist; and is in existence at this  
						moment. Need I remind you Sir, that the seizure and asportation of the Seamen belonging to the crew of the Chesapeake, entered into the very essence of that aggression; that with an exception of the victim to a trial forbidden by the most solemn considerations, and greatly  
						aggravating the guilt of its author, the seamen in question are still retained, and consequently that the aggression, if in no other respect, is by that act alone continued and in force?  
					If the views which have been taken of the subject have the justness which they claim, they will have shewn that on no ground whatever can an annulment of the proclamation of July 2d. be reasonably required, as a preliminary to the negotiation with which you  
						are charged. On the contrary it clearly results, from a recurrence to the causes and object of the Proclamation, that, as was at first intimated, the strongest sanctions of Great Britain herself, would support the demand, that previous to a discussion of the Proclamation, due  
						satisfaction should be made to the U States; that this satisfaction ought to extend to all the wrongs which preceded and produced that act: and that even limiting the merits of the question to the single relation of the proclamation to the wrong committed in the attack on the  
						American frigate, and deciding the question on the principle that a discontinuance of the latter required of right a discontinuance of the former, nothing appears that does not leave such a preliminary destitute of every foundation which could be assumed for it.  
					With a right to draw this conclusion the President might have instructed me to close this communication, with the reply stated in the beginning of it; and perhaps in taking this course, he would only have consulted a sensibility, to which most Governments  
						would, in such a case, have yielded. But adhering to the moderation by which he has been invariably guided and anxious to rescue the two nations from the circumstances; under which an abortive issue to your Mission necessarily place them, he has authorized me, in the event of  
						your disclosing the terms of reparation which you believe will be satisfactory and on its appearing that they are so, to consider this evidence of the Justice of His Britannic Majesty as a pledge for an effectual interposition with respect to all the abuses against a  
						recurrence of which the Proclamation was meant to provide, and to proceed to concert with you, a revocation of that act bearing the same date with the act of reparation to which the U States are entitled.  
					I am not unaware Sir, that according to the view which you appear to have taken of your instructions, such a course of proceeding has not been contemplated by them. It is possible, nevertheless, that an examination, in the spirit, in which I am well  
						persuaded it will be made; may discover them to be not inflexible to a proposition, in so high a degree, liberal and conciliatory. In every event, the President will have manifested his willingness to meet your Government on a ground of accommodation, which spares to its  
						feelings, however misapplied he may deem them, every concession, not essentially due to those which must be equally respected; and consequently will have demonstrated that the very ineligible posture given to so important a subject in the relations of the two Countries, by  
						the unsuccessful termination of your mission, can be referred to no other source, than the rigorous restrictions under which it was to be executed.  
					I make no apology Sir, for the long interval between the date of your letter and that under which I write. It is rendered unnecessary by your knowledge of the circumstances to which the delay is to be ascribed. With high consideration &amp; respect I have  
						the honor to be Sir, your most obt. Set

Department of State, March  
5, 1808.  
SIRs  
  
I have had the honour to receive  
and lay before the president your  
letter of the 26th January, in which  
you state, that you are “ expressly  
precluded, by your instructions,  
from entering upon any negotia-  
tion for the adjustment of the dif-  
ferences arising from the encoun-  
ter of his Britannic majesty’s ship  
the Leopard and the frigate of the  
United States, the Chesapeake, as  
long as the proclamation of the  
president, of the 2d of July, 1807,  
shall be in force.”  
  
This demand, sir, might justly  
suggest the simple answer, that,  
before the proclamation of the pre-  
sident could become a subject of  
consideration, satisfaction should  
be made for the acknowledged ag-  
gression which preceded it. This  
  
REGISTER.  
  
is evidently agreeable to the order  
of time, tothe order of reason, and,  
it may be added, to the order of  
usage, as maintained by Great  
Britain, whenever, in analogous  
cases, she has been the complain-  
ing party.  
  
But as you have subjoimed to  
the preliminary demand certain  
explanations, with a view doubt-  
less to obviate such an answer, it  
will best accord with the candour  
of the president to meet them  
with such a review of the whole  
subject, as will present the solid  
grounds on which he regards such  
a demand as inadmissible  
  
I begin with the occurrences  
from which the proclamation of  
July 2d resulted. These are in  
general terms referred to by the  
instrument itself. A more parti-  
car notice of the most important  
of them will here be in place.  
  
Passing over, then, the habitual  
but minor irregularities of his  
Britannic majesty’s ships of war,  
in making the hospitalities of our  
ports subservient to the annoyance  
of our trade, both outward and in-  
ward, a practice not only contrary  
to the principles of public law, but  
expressly contrary to British ordi-  
nances, enforced during maritime  
wars to which she bore a neutral  
relation, I am constrained, unwel-  
come as the task is, to call your  
attention to the following more  
prominent instances.  
  
Inthe summer ofthe year 1804,  
the British frigate the Cambrian,  
with others in company, entered  
the harbour of New York. The  
commander, captain Bradley, in  
violation of the port laws relating  
both to health and revenue, caused  
a merchant vessel just arrived, and  
confessedly within the limits and  
under the authority of the United  
States, to be boarded by persons  
  
j

under his command, who, after  
resisting the officers of the port in  
the legal exercise of their func-  
tions, actually impressed and car-  
ried off a number of seamen and  
passengers inte the service of the  
ships of war. On anappeal to his  
voluntary respect for the laws, he  
first failed to give up the offender  
to justice, and finally repelled the  
officer charged with the regular  
process for the purpose.  
  
This procedure was not only a  
flagrant insult to the sovereignty  
of the nation, but an infraction of  
its neutrality also, which did not  
permit a belligerent ship thus to  
augment its force within the neu-  
tral territory.  
  
To finish the scene, this com-  
mander went so far as to declare,  
in an official letter to the minister  
plenipotentiary of his Britannic  
majesty, and by him communicat-  
ed to this government, that he con-  
sidered his ship, whilst lying in  
the harbour of New York, as hav-  
ing dominion around her, within  
the distance of her buoys.  
  
All these circumstances were  
duly made known to the British  
government, in just expectations  
of honourable reparation. None  
has ever been offered. Captain  
Bradley was advanced from his  
frigate to the command of a ship  
of the line.  
  
At a subsequent period, several  
British frigates, under the com-  
mand of captain Whitby, of the  
Leander, pursuing the practice of  
vexing the inward and outward  
trade of our ports, and hovering for  
that purpose about the entrance of  
that of New York, closed a series  
of irregularities with an attempt  
to arrest a coasting vessel, on  
board of which an American citi-  
zen was killed by a cannon ball,  
which entered the vessel whilst  
  
415  
  
within less than a mile of the  
shore.  
  
‘The blood of a citizen thus mur-  
dered, in a trade from one to ano-  
ther port of his own country, and  
within the sanctuary of its territo-  
rial jurisdiction, could not fail to  
arouse the sensibility of the pub-  
lic, and to make a solemn appeal  
to the justice of the British go-  
vernment. The case was present-  
ed moreover to that government  
by this, in the accent which it re-  
quired; and with due confidence  
that the offender would receive the  
exemplary punishment which he  
deserved. ‘hat there might be no  
failure of legal proof of a fact sufhi-  
ciently notorious of itself, unex-  
ceptionable witnesses to establish  
it were sent to Great Britain, at the  
expence of the United States.  
  
Captain Whitby was, notwith-  
standing, honourably acquitted ;  
no animadversion took place on  
any other officer belonging to the  
squadron ; nor has any apology er  
explanation been made since the  
trial was over, as a conciliatory of-  
fering to the disappointment of  
this country at such a result.  
  
A case of another character oc-  
curred in the month of September,  
1806. ‘The Impeteux, a Irench  
ship of 74 guns, when aground  
within a few hundred yards of the  
shore of North Carolina, and there-  
fore visibly within the territorial  
jurisdiction and hospitable protec-  
tion of the United States, was fired  
upon, boarded, and burnt, from  
three British ships of war, under  
the command of captain Douglas.  
Having completed this outrage on  
the sovereignty and neutrality of  
the United States, the British com-  
mander felt no scruple in proceed-  
ing thence into the waters near  
Norfolk, nor, in the midst of the  
hospitalities enjoyed by him, to

add to what had passed a refusal  
to discharge from his ships im-  
pressed citizens of the United  
States, not denied to be such, on  
the plea that the government of  
the United States had refused to  
surrender to the command of ad-  
  
_tmiral Berkley, certain seamen al-  
  
leged to be British deserters: a  
demand which it is well under-  
stood your government disclaims  
any right to make.  
  
It would be very superfluous to  
dwell on the features which mark  
the aggravated insult. But I must  
be permitted to remind you, that in  
so serious a light was a similar vio-  
jation of neutral territory, by the  
destruction of certain French ships  
on the coast of Portugal, by a  
British squadron, under the com-  
mand of admiral Boscawen, re-  
garded by the court of Great Bri-  
fain, that a minister extraordina-  
ry was dispatched, for the express  
purpose of expiating the aggres-  
sion on the sovereignty of a friend-  
ly power.  
  
Lastly presents itself the at-  
tack of the British ship of war  
Leopard, on the American fri-  
gate Chesapeake: a case too fa-  
miliar in all its circumstances to  
need a recital of any part of them.  
It is sufficient to remark, that the  
conclusive evidence which this  
event added to that which had  
preceded, of the uncontrouled ex-  
cesses of the British naval com-  
manders, in insulting our sove-  
reignty, and abusing our hospi-  
tality, determined the president  
to extend to all British armed  
ships, the precaution heretofore  
applied to a few by name, of in-  
terdicting to them the use and  
privileges of cur harbours and  
waters.  
  
This was done by his procla-  
mation of July 2, 1807, referring  
  
to the series of occurrences, end-  
ing with the aggression on the  
frigate Chesapeake, as the con-  
siderations requiring it. And if  
the apprehension from the licen-  
tious spirit of the British naval  
commanders, thus developed and  
uncontrouled, which led to this  
measure of precaution, could need  
other justification than was af-  
forded by what had passed, it  
would be amply found in the sub-  
sequent conduct of the ships un-  
der the command of the same  
captain Douglas.  
  
This officer, neither admonish-  
ed by reflections on the crisis pro-  
duced by the attack on the Chesa-  
peake, nor controuied by respect  
for the law of nations, or the laws  
of the land, did not cease within  
our waters to bring to, by firing  
at, vessels pursuing their regular  
course of trade; and, in the same  
spirit which had displayed itself  
in the recent outrage committed  
on the American frigate, he not  
only indulged himself in hostile  
threats, and indications of a hos-  
tile approach to Norfolk, but ac-  
  
‘tually obstructed our citizens in  
  
the ordinary communication be-  
tween that and _ neighbouring  
places. His proceedings consti-  
tuted, in fact, a blockade of the  
port, and as real an invasion of  
the country, according to the ex-  
tent of his force, as if troops had  
been debarked, and the town been  
besieged on the land side.  
  
_ Was it possible for the chief  
magistrate of a nation, who felt  
for its rights and its honour, to  
do less than interpose some mea-  
sure of precaution at least against  
the repetition of enormities which  
had been so long uncontrouled by  
the government whose officers had  
committed them, and which had  
at last taken the exorbitant shape

AMERICAN STATE PAPERS.  
  
of hostility and of insult, seen in  
the attack on the frigate Chesa-  
peake? Candour will pronounce  
that less could not be done ; and it  
will as readily admit that the pro-  
clamation comprizing that mea-  
sure could not have breathed a  
more temperate spirit, nor spoken  
ina more becoming tone. How  
far it has received, from those  
whose intrusions it prohibited,  
the respect due to the national au-  
thority, or been made the occa-  
sion of new indignities, needs no  
explanation.  
  
The president, having interpos-  
ed this precautionary interdict, lost  
no time in instructing the minis-  
ter plenipotentiary of the United,  
States to represent to the British  
government the signal aggression  
which had been committed on  
their sovereignty and their flag,  
and to require the satisfaction due  
for it; indulging the expectation,  
that his Britannic majesty would  
at once perceive it to be the tru-  
est magnanimity, as well as the  
strictest justice, to offer that  
prompt and full expiation of an  
acknowledged wrong, which would  
re-establish and improve, both in  
fact and in feeling, the state of  
things which it had violated.  
  
This expectation was consider-  
ed as not only honourable to the  
sentiments of his majesty, but was  
supported by known examples, in  
which, being the complaining par-  
ty, he had required and obtained,  
as a preliminary to any counter  
complaints whatever, a precise re-*  
placement of things, in every prac-  
ticable circumstance, in their pre-  
existing situation.  
  
‘Thus, in the year 1764, Bermudi-  
ans and other British subjects, who  
had, according to annual custom,  
taken possession of Turk’s island  
tor the season of fnaking salt, hay-  
  
VOL,

ing been forcibly removed, with  
their vessels and effects, by a  
French detachment from the is-  
land of St. Domingo, to which  
Turk’s island was alleged to be  
an appurtenance, the British am-  
bassador at Paris, in pursuance of  
instructions from his government,  
demanded, as a satisfaction for the  
violence committed, that the pro-  
ceedings should be disavowed, the  
intention of acquiring Turk’s is-  
land disclaimed, orders given for  
the immediate abandonment of it  
on the part of the French, every  
thing restored to the condition in  
which it was at the time ofthe ag-  
“zression, and reparation of the da-  
mages which any British subjects.  
should be found to have sustained,  
according to an estimation to be  
settled between the governors of  
St. Domingo and Jamaica. A  
compliance with the whole of this  
demand was the result.  
  
Again: in the year 1789, certain  
English merchants having opened  
a trade at Nootka sound, on the  
north-west coast of America, and  
attempted a settlement at that  
place, the Spaniards, who had long  
claimed that part of the world as  
their exclusive property, dispatch-  
ed a frigate from Mexico, which  
captured two English vessels en-  
gaged in the trade, and broke up  
the settlement on the coast. The  
Spanish government was the first  
to complain, in this case, of the in-  
trusion committed by the British  
merchants. The British govern-  
ment, however, demanded that the  
vessels taken by the Spanish fri-  
gate shouk! be restored, and ade-  
quate satisfaction granted, frevi-  
ous to any other discussion.  
  
This demand prevailed; the  
Spanish government agreeing to  
make full restoration of the cap-  
tured vessels, and to indemnify the  
  
&#x27;  
—  
  
418  
  
parties interested in them for the  
losses sustained. They restored  
also the buildings and tracts of  
land of which the British subjects  
had been dispossessed. The Bri-  
tish, however, soon gave proof of  
the little value they set on the pos-  
session, by a voluntary dereliction,  
under which it has since re-  
mained.  
  
The case which will be noted  
last, though of a date prior to the  
case of Nootka sound, is that of  
Falkland’s islands. These islands  
lie about 100 leagues eastward of  
the straitsof Magellan. ‘The title  
to them, had been a subject of con-  
troversy among several of the.  
maritime nations of Europe. From  
the position of the islands and  
other circumstances, the preten-  
sions of Spain bore an advantage-  
ous comparison with those of her  
competitors. In the year 1770,  
the British took possession of port  
Egmont, in one of the islands, the  
Spaniards being at the time in pos-  
session of another part, and pro-  
testing against a settlement by the  
British. The protest being with-  
out effect, ships ard troops were  
sent from Buenos Ayres by the  
governor of that place, which for-  
cibly dispossessed and drove off  
the British settlers.  
  
The British government looked  
entirely to the dispossession by  
force, demanded, as a specific con-  
dition of preserving harmony be-  
tween the two courts, not only the  
disavowal of the Spanish proceed-  
ings, but that the affairs of that  
settlement should be immediately  
restored to the precise state in  
_which they were previous to the  
act of dispossession. The Span-  
ish government made some difhi-  
culties ; requiring particularly a  
disavowal, on the part of Great

Britain, of the conduct of her offi-  
cer at Falkland’s islands, which, it  
was alleged, gave occasion to the  
steps taken by the Spanish gover-  
nor, and proposing an adjustment  
by mutual stipulation in the ordi-  
nary form.  
  
The reply was, that the modera-  
tion of his Britannic majesty having  
limited his demand to the smallest  
reparation he could accept for the  
injury done, nothing was left for  
discussion but the mode of car-  
rying the disavowal and restitution  
into execution ; refiaration losing  
its value if it be conditional, and  
to be obtained by any stipulation  
whatever from the party injur-  
ed.  
The Spanish government yield-  
  
ed. The violent proceedings of  
its officers were disavowed. The  
fort, the port, and every thing else  
were agreed to be immediately re-  
stored to the precise situation which  
had been disturbed ; and duplicates  
of orders issued for the purpose  
to the Spanish officers were de-  
livered into the hands of the Bri-  
tish principal secretaries of state.  
Here again it is to be remarked,  
that satisfaction having been made  
for the forcible dispossession, the  
islands lost their importance in  
the eyes of the British govern-  
ment, were in a short time evacu-  
ated, and port Egmont remains,  
with every other part of them, in  
the hands of Spain.  
Could stronger pledges have  
been given than are here found,  
» that an honourable and instant re-  
paration would be made in a case  
differing no otherwise from those  
recited, than as it furnished to the  
same monarch of a great nation  
an opportunity to prove, that, ad-  
hering always to the same immu-  
table principle, he was as ready to

do right to others, as to require it  
for himself.  
  
Returning to the instructions  
given to the minister plenipoten-  
tiary of the United States at Lon-  
don, I am to observe, that the pre-  
sident thought it just and expedi-  
ent to insert, as a necessary ingre-  
dient, in the adjustment of the  
outrage committed on the Ameri-  
can frigate, a security against the  
future practice of British naval  
commanders, in impressing from  
merchant vessels of the United  
States, on the high seas, such of  
their crews as they might under-  
take to denominate British sub-  
jects.  
  
To this association of the two  
subjects, the president was deter-  
mined, first, by his regarding both  
as resting on kindred principles ;  
the immunity of private ships,  
with the known exceptions made  
by the law of nations, being as well  
established as that of public ships ;  
and there being no pretext for in-  
cluding in these exceptions the  
impressment (if it could be freed  
from its enormous and notorious  
abuses) of the subjects of a belli-  
gerent, by the officers of that bel-  
ligerent. The rights of a belii-  
gerent, against the ships of a neu-  
tral nation, accrue merely from the  
relation of the neutral to the other  
belligerent, as in conveying to him  
contraband of war, or in supplying  
a blockaded port.  
  
The claim of a belligerent to  
search for and seize on board neu-  
tral vessels, on the high seas, per-  
sons under his allegiance, does not  
therefore rest on any belligerent  
right under the law of nations, but  
on a prerogative derived from mu-  
nicipal laws ; and involves the ex-  
travagant supposition, that one na-  
tion has a right to execute, at all  
timesand in all cases, its municipal  
  
419  
  
laws and regulations, on board  
the ships of another nation, not  
being within its territorial limits.  
  
The president was led to the  
same determination, secondly, by  
his desire of converting a particu-  
lar incident into an occasion for  
removing another and more ex-  
tensive source of danger to the  
harmony of the two countries:  
and, thirdly, by his persuasion that  
the liberality of the propositions  
authorized with this view would  
not fail to induce the ready con-  
currence of his Britannic majesty ;  
and that the more extensive source  
of irritation and perplexity being  
removed, a satisfactory adjustment  
of the particular incident would be  
the less difficult. The president  
still thinks that such would have  
been the tendency of the mode for  
which he had provided; and he  
cannot therefore but regret that  
the door was shut against the ex-  
periment, by the peremptory refu-  
sal of Mr. Canning to admit it in-  
to discussion, even in the most in-  
formal manner, as was suggested  
by Mr. Monroe.  
  
The president felt the greater  
regret, asthe step he had taken to-  
wards a more enlarged and lasting  
accommodation became thus a bar  
to the adjustment of the particular  
and recent aggression which had  
been committed against the Unit-  
ed States. He found, however, an  
alleviation, in the signified purpose  
of his Britannic majesty to charge  
with this adjustment a special mis-  
sion to the United States, which,  
restricted as it was, seemed to in-  
dicate a disposition from which a  
liberal and conciliatory arrange-  
ment of one great object at least  
might be confidently expected.  
  
In this confidence, your arrival  
was awaited with. every friendly  
solicitude ; and our first interview  
  
&gt;  
‘  
  
420  
  
having opened the way, by an ac-  
quiescence in the separation of the  
two cases, insisted on by his Bri-  
tannic majesty, notwithstanding  
the strong ground on which they  
had been united by the president, it  
was not to be doubted that a tender  
of the satisfaction claimed by the  
United States for a distinguished  
and acknowledged insult, by one  
of lris officers, would immediately  
follow.  
  
It was not, therefore, without a  
very painful surprize, that the er-  
ror of this expectation was disco-  
vered. Instead of the satisfaction  
due from. the original aggression,  
it was announced that the first step  
towards the adjustment must pro-  
ceed from the party injured; and  
your letter now before me formal-  
ly repeats, that, as long as the pro-  
clamation of the president, which  
issued on the 2d of July, 1807,  
shall be in force, it will be an in-  
superable obstacle to a negotiation,  
even on the subject of the aggres-  
sion which preceded it; in other  
words, that the proclamation must  
be put out of force before an ad-  
justment of the aggression can be  
taken into discussion.  
  
In explaining the grounds of  
this extraordinary demand, it is  
alleged to be supported by the  
consideration, that the proceeding  
and pretension of the offending  
ofticer has been disavowed; that  
general assurances are given of a  
disposition and intention in bis  
Britannic majesty to make satis-  
faction; that a special minister  
was dispatched with promptitude  
for the purpose of carrying into  
effect this disposition; and that  
you have a personal conviction  
that the particular terms, which  
you are not at liberty previously to  
disclose, will be deemed by the  
United States satisfactory.  
  
AMERICAN REGISTER.  
  
With respect to the disavowal,  
it would be unjust not to regard it  
as a proof of candour and amity to-  
wards the United States, and as  
some presage of the voluntary re-  
paration which it implied to be  
due. But the disavowal can be  
the less confounded with the repa-  
ration itself, since it was sufficient-  
ly required by the respect which  
Great Britain owed to her own ho-  
nour; it being impossible that an  
enlightened government, had hos-  
tility been meditated, would have  
commenced_it in such a- manner,  
and in the midst of existing pro-  
fessions of peace and friendship.  
She owed it also to consistency  
with a disavowal on a former occa-  
sion, in whith the pretension had  
been enforced by a British squad-  
ron, against the sloop of war Balti-  
more, belonging to the United  
States; and finally to the interest  
which Great Britain has, more  
than any other nation, in disclaim-  
ing a principle which would ex-  
pose her superior number of ships  
of war to so many indignities from  
inferior navies.  
  
As little can the general assur-  
ances that reparation would be  
made claim a return which could  
properly follow the actual repara-  
tion only. They cannot amount  
to more than a disposition, or at  
most a promise, to do what the ag-  
gressor may deem a fulfilment of  
his obligation. They do not prove  
even a disposition to do what may  
be satisfactory to the injured par-  
ty, who cannot have less than an  
equal right to decide on the suffi-  
ciency of the redress.  
  
In dispatching a special minis-  
ter for the purpose of adjusting the  
difference, the United States ought  
cheerfully to acknowledge all the  
proof it affords, on the part of his  
Britannic majesty, of his pacific

views towards them. But whilst  
they could not, under any circum-  
stances, allow to the measure more  
than a certain participation in an  
honourable reparation, it is to be  
recollected, that the avowed and  
  
primary object of the mission was ~  
  
to substitute for the more extend-  
ed adjustment proposed by the  
United States at London, a separa-  
tion of the subjects, as preferred  
by his Britannic majesty ; and you  
well know, sir, how fully this ob-  
ject was accomplished.  
  
With respect to the personal  
conviction which you have ex-  
pressed, that the terms, which you  
decline to disclose, would be satis-  
factory to the United States, it is  
incumbent on me to observe, that,  
with the highest respect for your  
judgment, and the most perfect  
confidence in your sincerity, an in-  
superable objection manifestly lies  
to the acceptance of a personal and  
unexplained opinion, in place of a  
disclosure, which would enable this  
government to exercise its own  
judgment ina case affecting so es-  
sentially its honour and its rights.  
Such a course of proceeding would  
be without example; andthere can  
be no hazard in saying that one  
will never be afforded by a govern-  
ment which respects itself as much  
as yours justly does; and there-  
fore can never be reasonably ex-  
pected from one which respects it-  
self as much as this has a right to  
do.  
  
I forbear, sir, to enlarge on the  
intrinsic incongruity of the expe-  
dient proposed. But I must be al-  
Jowed to remark, as an additional  
admonition of the singular and  
mortifying perplexity in which a  
compliance might involve the pre-  
sident, that there are in the letter  
of Mr. Canning, communicating to  
Mr. Monroe the special mission to  
  
42)  
  
the United States, pregnant indi-  
cations that other questions and  
conditions may have been contem-  
plated, which would be found ut- —  
terly irreconcilable with the senti-  
ments of this nation.  
  
If neither any nor all of these  
considerations can sustain the pre-  
liminary demand made in your  
communication, it remains to be  
seen whether such a demand rests  
with greater advantage on the more  
precise ground on which you final-  
ly seem to place it.  
  
The proclamation is considered  
as a hostile measure, and a discon-  
tinuance of it as due to the discon-  
tinuance of the aggression which  
led to it.  
  
It has been sufficiently shown  
that the proclamation, as appears  
on the face of it, was produced by  
a train of occurrences terminating  
in the attack on the American fri-  
gate, and not by this last alone.  
To a demand, therefore, that the  
proclamation be revoked, it would  
be perfectly fair to oppose a de-  
mand that redress be first given  
for the pumerous irregularities  
which preceded the aggression on  
the American frigate, as well as for  
this particular aggression, and that  
effectual controul be interposed  
against repetitions of them. And  
as no such redress has been given  
for the past, notwithstanding the  
lapse of time which has taken  
place, nor any such security for  
the future, notwithstanding the un-  
diminished reasonableness of it,  
it follows, that a continuance of  
the proclamation would be consist-  
ent with an entire discontinuance  
of one only of the occurrences from  
which it proceeded.  
  
But it is not necessary to avail  
the argument of this view of the  
case, although of itself entirely  
conclusive... Had the proclumation  
  
422  
  
been founded on the single aggres-  
sion committed on the Chesapeake,  
and were it admitted that the dis-  
continuance of that aggression  
merely gave a claim to the dis-  
continuance of the proclamation,  
the claim would be defeated by  
the incontestible fact, that that  
aggression has not been discon-  
tinued. It has never ceased to  
exist; and is in existence at this  
moment. Need I remind you,  
sir, that the seizure and aspor-  
tation of the seamen belonging  
to the crew of the Chesapeake  
entered into the very essence of  
that aggression; that with an ex-  
ception of the victim to a trial,  
forbidden by the most solemn con-  
siderations, and greatly aggravat-  
ing the guilt of its author, the  
seamen in question are still re-  
tained, and consequently that the  
aggression, if in no other respect,  
is by that act alone continued and  
in force ?  
  
If the views which have been  
taken of the subject have the just-  
ness which they claim, they will  
have shown that on no ground  
whatever can an annulment of the  
proclamation of July 2d be rea-  
sonably required as a prelimina-  
ry to the negotiation with which  
you are charged. On the contra-  
ry, it clearly results, from a re-  
currence to the causes and object  
of the proclamation, that, as was  
at first’ intimated, the ‘strongest  
sanctions of Great Britain herself  
would support the demand, that,  
previous to a discussion of the  
proclamation, due satisfaction  
  
should be made to the United  
States ; that this satisfaction ought  
to extend to all the wrongs which  
preceded and produced that act;  
and that, even limiting the merits  
of the question to the single rela-  
tion of the proclamation to the  
  
AMERICAN RECISTER. |  
  
wrong committed in the attack  
on the American frigate, and de-  
ciding the question on the princi-  
ple that a discontinuance of the  
latter required of right a discon-  
tinuance of the former, nothing  
appears that does not leave such  
a preliminary destitute of every  
foundation which could be assum-  
ed for it.  
  
With a right to draw this  
conclusion, the president might  
have instructed me to close this  
communication with the reply  
stated in the beginning of it; and,  
perhaps, in taking this course, he  
would only have consulted a sen-  
sibility to which most govern-  
ments would, in such a case, have  
yielded. But, adhering to the  
moderation by which he has been  
invariably guided, and anxious to  
rescue the two nations from the  
circumstances under which an  
abortive issue to your mission ne-  
cessarily places them, he has au-  
thorized me, in the event of your  
disclosing the terms of reparation  
which you believe will be satisfac-  
tory, and on its appearing that  
they are, to consider this evidence  
of the justice of his Britannic  
majesty as a pledge for an effec-  
tual interposition with respect to  
all the abuses, against a recur-  
rence of which the proclamation  
was meant to provide, and to pro-  
ceed to concert with you a revo-  
cation of that act, bearing the  
same date with the act of repara-  
tion to which the United States  
are entitled.  
  
I am not unaware, sir, that, ac-  
cording to the view which you  
appear to have taken of your in-  
structions, such a course of pro-  
ceeding has not been contemplat-  
ed by them. It is possible, ne-  
vertheless, that a re-examination,  
in a spirit in which [ am well  
  
t  
  
AMERICAN STATE PAPERS.  
  
persuaded it will be made, may  
discover them to be not inflexible  
to a proposition in so high a de-  
gree liberal and conciliatory. In  
every event, the president will  
have manifested his willingness to  
meet your government on a  
ground of accommodation, which  
spares to its feelings, however  
misapplied he may deem them,  
every concession not essentially  
due to those which must be  
equally respected, and conse-  
quently will have demonstrated,  
that the very ineligible posture  
given to so important a subject in  
the relations of the two coun-  
tries, by the unsuccessful termi-  
nation of your mission, can be re-  
ferred to no other source than the  
rigorous restrictions under which  
it was to be executed.  
  
I make no apology, sir, for the  
long interval between the date of  
your letter and that under which  
I write. It is rendered unneces-  
sary, by your knowledge of the  
circumstances to which the delay  
is to be ascribed. I have the ho

&#x27; . Sib—I have h«h :&lt;,r »0 ,c_  
eeiie and lay before ibe .rcsideni,  
&#x27; your letter of tne 26tb January, in  
which you stale, that y.u are &quot; ex­  
, prcsdy precluded by your instructions  
&#x27; from entering Upon any negociation  
for the adjustment of the differ;  
&#x27; arising from tin; encounter of his  
Britannic majesty&#x27;s ship the Leopard,  
the frigate of the U. States, the  
Chesapeake, as long as the prociama­  
&#x27; lion of the President of the 2d of  
&quot; July, 1807, shall be in force.&quot;  
This demand, sir, might justly  
suggest the :;imple answer, lhat be­  
fore the proclamation of the Presi­  
&#x27; dent could become v subject of con­  
skleratlon, satisfaction should be ;  
made for the acknowledged aggres­  
sion which preceded it. This is evi­  
d&lt; iitly agreeable to the order of time,  
. to the order of reason, and, it may­  
be added, to the order of i  
maintained by G. Britain, whenevei  
in analogous cases, she. has been tin  
complaining party.  
But as you have subjoined to the  
preliminary demand, certain explana­  
tions, with a view, doubtless to &lt;  
ate such an answer, it will best accord  
with the candor of the President, X  
meet ihem with such a review of the  
whole subjec!, as will present the (  
solid grounds on which he regards  
such a demand, as inadmissible.  
I begin with the occurrences from  
which the procla nation of July 2d,  
resulted. These are in general terms  
. referred 10, by 1 i.c instrument b  
! A more particular notice ofthe most  
! important of them, will here be in j  
! place.  
Passing over then, the habitual but /  
: minor irregularities of his Britannic ,  
majesty&#x27;s ships of war, in malting toe  
hospitalities of our ports, subservient  
to the annoyance of our trade, both  
j outward and inward, a practice not &#x27;,  
only contrary to the principles of pub- ,J  
j lit law, but expressly contrary to Rri- ■  
tish ordinances enforced during ma­  
ritime wars, to which she bore a neu­  
tral i elation. I am&#x27;constrained, unwel­  
come as the task is, to call your ai­  
mi to the following moie promi- &#x27;  
nent iristai  
In the, summer of the year 1804,  
- &#x27;■ f&#x27; ate the Cambrian, with .  
other ciuizers in company, entered  
the harbor of N. York. The comman­  
der, captain Ibadley, in violation of j  
he port hnvsy relating both to health (  
ttd revenue, caused a merchant ves­  
just arrived, and conlessediy r  
within the limits and under the an­  
tnoiity of the U. States, to be boarded ]  
  
WASHINGTON CIIY, PlllN .ED BY SAMI EL HARRISON SMITH, PENNS i LVANIA AVENUE.  
  
WEDNESDAY, MARCH 30, 1808.  
  
f by persons unlet&#x27; his co n mind, who,  
I after resisting the officers ofthe ) &gt;rt,  
- in tic legal exercise of their rune*  
r tions, actually impressed and carried  
t off a number of seamen and p issen­  
r gcrs into the service of the ships of  
- war. On an appeal to his volu tarv  
1 respect for the laws, he first failed  
l to give up the offender to justice, and  
*, finally repelled the officer charged  
; with the regular process for the pur­  
i pose.  
.1 This procedure was not only a Ra­  
- grant insult to the sovereignty of the  
- nation, but an infraction of ilsncu&#x27;ra­  
&gt; iityalso, which did not permit a bel­  
-1 ligerent ship thus to augment its force  
r within the neutral territory.  
To finish t tic scene, this comman­  
der went so far as to declare, in an of­  
, licial letter, to the minister plenipo­  
i tenliary of his Britannic majesty, and  
by him communicated to this govern­  
ment, that he considered bis ship,  
\ whilst lying in the harbor of New  
: York, as having dominion around her,  
, within the distance of her buoys,  
i All these circumstances were duly  
. made known to the British govern­  
ment in just expectation of honorable  
t reparation. None has ever been of­  
. fcred. Captain Bradley was advanced  
from his frigate to the command of a  
f ship of the line.  
At a subsequent period, several  
f; British frigates under the command  
jof captain Whitby, of- the Leandcr,  
pursuing the practice of vexing the  
i inward and outward trade oi our ports,  
and hovering for lhat purpose about  
; the entrance of that of New York,  
closed a scries of irregularities, with  
. an attempt to arrest a coasting vessel,  
on board of which an American citi­  
zen was killed by. a capnon ball which  
entered the vessel, whilst within less  
than a mile from ihe *diorc.  
The. blood of a citizen thus mur­  
dered, in a trade from one to another  
port ot hi; own counfy, and yvithin  
the sanctua-y ol its territorial juris­  
diction, could not tail to arouse the  
sensibility of the public, and to make  
a solemn appeal to the justice of the  
British government. The case was  
presented moreover to that govern- !  
ment by this, in the accent which it  
required; and with due confidence  
&#x27;hat the offender would receive the  
exemplary punishment which he de­  
served. That there might be no  
failure ol&#x27; legal proof of a fact suffici­  
. entry notorious of itself, unexcepti­  
onable, witnesses lo establish it were  
sent to Great Britain at the expence  
ol the United States.  
Captain Whitby was notwithstand­  
ing honorably acquitted ; no animad­  
, version took place on any other ofti­  
i cer belonging to the squadron ; nor  
has any apology or explanation been  
made since the trial was over, as a  
cpn&lt; iliatory offering to the disappoint­  
ment of this country at such a re­  
sult.  
A ease of another character oc­  
curred in the month of September,  
1806. The Impetueux, a French  
snip of 74 guns, when aground within  
a lew hundred yards of the shore of  
North Carolina, and therefore visibly  
within;th.e territorial jurisdiction and &#x27;  
hospitable protection ol the United  
States, was fired upon, boarded and  
burnt, from three British ships of  
under the command of captain  
Douglass. Having completed this ]  
outrage on the sovereignty and neu­  
trality of the United States, the Bri­  
tish commander felt no scruple in  
proceeding I hence into the waters near  
Norfolk, nor in the midst of the bos- .  
; pilalities enjoyed by him, to add to \
what had passed a refusal lo discharge  
from his ships, impressed citizens of j  
the United States not denied lo be  
such, on the plea that the government : !  
of the United States had refused to  
surrender to the demand of admiral C  
Berkeley, certain seamen alleged to  
be British deserters; a demand which  
it is well understood your government  
Claims any right to make.  
It would be very superfluous to *  
dwell on the features which mark this  
aggravated insult. But I must be j|  
permitted to remind you, lint in so  
serious a light was a similar violation &#x27;  
of neutral territory, by the destrue- &#x27;!  
lion of certain French ships on the  
coast of Portugal, by a British sipia- &#x27;&#x27;  
di on under the command of admiral  
.wan, regarded by the. court of  
Great Britain, that a minister extra- :  
ordinary was disp.m bed for the ex- !  
press purpose of expiating Ihe ag* H  
ion on the sovereignty of a .  
friendly power.  
  
&gt;, j Lastly presents itself, the attack by  
;, ■ the British ship of war Leopard, on  
&gt; the American frigate Chesapeake ; a  
d case too familiar in all its circuni­  
i- stances to need a recital of any part of  
&gt;f them. It is sufficient to remark that  
v the conclusive evidence which this  
d event added to that which had prec -  
d (led, of the uncontrolled excesses of  
d the British naval commanders, in in*  
•- SUltmg our sovereignty, and abusing  
our hospitably, determined the Pre­  
- sident to extend to all British armed  
c ships, the precaution heretofore ftp*.  
l- plied to a kw by name, of interdict-  
I- ing to them the use and privileges of  
f our harbors and waters.  
1 his was done by Irs proclamation  
- of July 2, 1807, referring to the se­  
ries of occurrences, ending with the  
&#x27;- aggression on the frigate Chesapeake,  
as the considerations requiring it.  
Andil th apprehension from the li­  
b eentious spirit of the B ilish nanl  
v comm unlcrs, thus developed and un­  
&#x27;.» controlled, which led to ibis measure  
of precaution, could need other jusli-  
V fixation than was afforded by what hid  
passed, it would be amply found in  
? the SUbsequeni conduct of the ships  
&quot; under the command of the same capt.  
Douglass.  
This officer, neither admonished  
by reflections on the crisis produced  
by the attack on the Chesapeake, nor  
controlled by respect for the law of i  
&#x27;&#x27; natims, or the laws of the laid, did |  
not cease within our waters to bring 10.  
&#x27; by firing at vessels pursuing their re- &#x27;  
- gular course of trade ; and in the  
&#x27; same spirit which had displayed it- &#x27;  
1 self in the recent outrage committed  
1 on the American frigate, he not only  
indulged himself in hostile threats, j  
1 and indications of a hostile approach I  
s to Norfolk, but actually obstructed i  
our citizens in the ordinary communi- &#x27;  
&quot; cation between that and neighboring &#x27;  
places. Mis proceedings constituted !  
in fact, a blockade of the poll, aid as &#x27;  
&quot; real ;m invasion of the country, ac- &#x27;  
cording lo the extent of his force, as j  
, if WoopS bail been debarked, and the t  
&#x27; town besieged on the land side. &lt;  
3 ; Was it possible for (he chief ma- &#x27;  
&quot; gistrate of a nation, who felt for its j  
rights and ils honor, to do less than (  
interpose some measure of precaution ]  
al least against the repetition of onor- j  
mities which had been SO long uncon- c  
trolled by the government whose offi­  
cers had committed them, and which t  
[ had at last taken ihe exorbitant shape; &#x27;  
of hostility and of insult seen in the J  
attack on the frigate Chesapeake r v  
Candor will pronounce that less could, f  
not be done ; and it will as readily r  
admit that the proclamation compri- i  
j sing that measure, could not have &#x27;  
breathed a more temperate spirit, nor !  
spoken in a more becoming tone.  
How far it has received from those   
whose intrusions it prohibited, the i  
respect due to the national&#x27; authority, s  
or been made the occasion of new in* a  
dignities, needs no explanation. i a  
The President having interposed:  
this prccau ionary interdict, lost no ,  
. time in instructing the minister pie- j,  
nipotenliaiy of the United States to v  
represent to the British government n  
the sigbal aggression which had been r  
committed on their sovereignty and   
. their flag, and to require thesuti,- ;1  
faction due for it ; indulging ihe e»  
peciation, that his Britannic majesty j  
would at once perceive it to be the «  
truest magnanimity, as well as the a  
strictest justice, to offer that prompt ,]  
and full expiation of an acknowledged H  
w*rohg, which would re-establish and , *  
improve both in fact and in feeling the J  
state o things which it had violated. \i  
This expectation was considered as I  
not only honorable to the sentiments si  
,of his majesty, bul was supported by f&lt;  
i known examples, in which, being the l  
complaining party, he had required ;   
and Obtained, as a preliminary to any n  
counter complaints wtlfcterer, a pre- tt  
cisc replacement of things, in every j  
practicable circumstance, in the.  
pre-existing situation. &quot;  
Thus in the year 17G4, Bermudi- &#x27;&#x27;  
ans and other British subjects, who [ *  
had according lo anhual custom, taken  
possession of Turk&#x27;s island for tl,  
season of making salt,&#x27; having been n  
forcibly&#x27;removed with their vessels (!  
and effects by a French detachment h  
n-om the island of St. Domingo, to ,  
which Turk&#x27;s island was alleged to be  
an appurler.ance, the British amhas- .]  
sador at Paris, in • urstlance of in- ,\
structions from his government, de- i  
mancled, as a satislai lion for the vio­  
lence committed, that the proceed*

a claimed, orders given for the immcdi­  
- ate abandonment of it on the part of  
f the French, every thing restored to

f tish subjects should be found to have

j to be settled between the governors  
. of St. Domingo and Jamaica. A  
I compliance with the whole of this  
. demand was the result.  
_ Ae.in:—|&#x27;n ihe year 1789, certain

i it of the &gt;n can be  
talsen into discussion.  
In explaining the grounds of this esc­  
traor liuary d-&quot;n-,inl, it is alleged to he  
supported by t&gt; ration that the  
i; and pretension of the nfiend*  
ing oflicer h«.s f, c i disavowed : that  
general assurances are given of a dis­  
position I&#x27;ll intention ri his Britannic  
maj &#x27;sty to make satisfaction ; that a  
.special minister was dispatched with  
promptitude for the purpose of carry­  
to effect this disposition ; and that  
ymi btvea personal conviction that the  
par icular terms, which y,),J are n,it- M  
ii!)ertv previoudv to disclose, will be  
deemed by the United States satisfac­  
tory.  
With respect to the disavowal it  
would beiin) ist not to regard it as a proof  
of candor am&#x27; amity towards the fj. S.  
and as some of the voluntary  
reparathwi which it implied to be due.  
But the disavowal can be the leys ton­  
founded with the reparation itself;  
since it wis sufficiently required by the  
respect which (i. Brit &lt;in owed to her  
own hooor ; it b?ing impossible that an ;  
enlightened government, had hostility |  
been meditated, would have commenc­  
ed it in such a m inner, and in the mi.lst  
of existing professions of p ace ;nid  
friendship. She owed it also to consis- J  
tewcy with the disavowal on a former ,  
occasion i&lt;t which the pretension had  
been enforced by a British squadron a- j  
gainst the sloop ol war Baltimore, be- ;  
longing to the U. S ; and finally to  
the int.;rsst which (J. Britain has, more  
than any other nation, in disclaiming  
a principle which would ex &gt;ose her  
sup ri &gt;r n-i nher of sh.p.s of war, to  
so maay indignities from interior na­  
vies.  
As little can the general assurances j  
!  
  
that reparation would he made, claim  
a return which could properly follow  
the actual reparation only. I&#x27;hey can*  
. .nt,nnt.to move than a disposition,  
or at most a promise to do what the  
sm r tna.v deem a fulfilment of his  
obligation. They do nM prove even a  
disposition to &lt;;.» what may he satisf a -  
tory to the injured party, who cannot  
less than in equal right to de­  
cide on the sufficiency ot the re­  
dress.  
In dispatching a special minister for  
the purpose ol adjusting the difference,  
the U. States ought cheerfully to ac­  
knowledge all the proof it affords on the  
part of his Britannic maj«*ty of his pa­  
cific views towards the i, and of his re­  
spect for their friendship. Hut whilst  
they could not, under any circum­  
stances, allow to the measure more  
firm i certain participation in an ho­  
norable reparation, it is to he recollect­  
ed that the avowed and primary ob­  
ject of the mission was to substitute for  
the more extended adjustment pro­  
posed hy the U. *-. at London, a sepa­  
ration of the subjects as preferred by  
his Britannic, majesty, and you well  
&#x27; know, sir, how billy this object was ac­  
complished.  
I Widt respect to the personal convic­  
,-tron which you have expr-ssed, tha»  
! the terms which you decline to disclose  
J would he satisfactory to the U. States,  
It is incumbent on roe to observe that  
with the highest respect for your judg-  
I ment and the most perfect confidence  
in votlr sincerity, an innup Table objec­  
-1 tion manif tly lies, to ihe acceptance  
\of a pergonal and unexpl ined opinion,  
lin plate* of i &#x27;U«clostire which would  
enable this government to extrcis&lt;~ its  
own pidgm-nt in a case allVcting so es*  
l sentiallv its honor ami its rights. Such  
j a course of proceeding would he with­  
out &lt; x impb- ; and there C in be no ha*  
; z&#x27;ird in saving that one Will never be  
afforded hy a government which re­  
spects itself as much as yours justly  
does ; and therefore can never be rea­  
sonably expected from one which re­  
spects itself as much as thL has a right  
ito do.  
! I forbear, sir, to enlarge on the m  
&#x27; trinsic incongruity of the expedient  
proposed. Rut 1 must he allowed to  
remark, as an additional admonition of  
the singular and mortifying perplexity  
in which a compliance might involve  
the President, tliit there ire n die let­  
ter of Mr. Cann&#x27;m;*, communicating to  
Mr. .Monro.&quot; the sp.c.i tl mission to the  
U. S. pregnant Indications ihu. other  
questions and conditions may hive been  
Contemplated which would be found ut­  
terly »irrec.o!,&lt; ileahle with the senti­  
mrnts of this nation.  
If neither any nor all of these consi­  
derations can sustain the preliminary |  
demand made in your c&lt; mmuniratioe, I  
it rehli ins t• he seen wii&gt; t vi- such a  
demand rests with greater advantage  
on the mose precise ground Oh which  
yon tin illy seem to pbiceit.  
The proclamation is considered as a  
hostile measure, and a discontinuance ;  
of it is due to the ducotinu mcc of the  
aggression which led to it.  
It has been Sufficiently shewn that  
the proclamation, as appears on the  
, face ot it, was produced by a train of  
occurrences term in :ting in the attick  
on ihe American frigate, and not by  
this last alone; T-i a (U mand there*  
fore that the prod um.tiou be rev.olp d,  
it would be perfectly fair to oppose a  
demand that fedress he first given for  
the numerous irregularities which pre­  
ceded the aggression &lt;&lt;n the Atm-ricai,  
frigate, as well as t- r this p irticul rag- j  
grey.i&#x27;■ i, and tnat effectual control be j  
iaterp■)•&gt; d against repetitions of them  
And is no su h redress has been given  
far the p-ist, notwithstanding the I,ipse  
of time which ha, taken pi c- , nor any  
such security for the future, nntwith­  
ai i;,,,._ the undiminished reasi .mblt&#x27;­  
ness of it, It follows, that a continuance of  
the proclamation would be consistent  
with an enure uisconlbniance of one  
nrfly of the occurrfiic.es from which it  
p, &gt;ceeded.  
But it is not necessary to avail the  
argu nent of this view of the case, al- :  
though of itself entirely conclusive.!  
11 id the proclamation been founded i  
0 i the single aggression c ■•&gt;.omitted on ;  
the Chesapeake, and were it adl  
that the di confirm mcc: of thataggrefi*  
sion merely, gave a claim to the dis­  
continuance of the proclamation, the  
claim would be defeated by the incon­  
testihle (act, that that aggression has  
not been discontinued• It has n  
ceased to exist ; and is in existence at  
this moment. Need 1 remind you, sir,  
thai the seizure and asportation ofthe  
seamen belonging to the crew of  
the Chesapeake, entered into the very  
essence of that aggression, that with  
an exception of the victim to a trial  
forbidden by the most solemn ■ con.*itler­  
atloss, and greatly aggravating the  
guilt cl its ni, bor, the seamen in ques­  
tion are still retained, and Consequently  
that the aggression, if In no other re*  
spect, is by th it act slope continued and  
i . forte ?  
If th views which h a»e been taken  
ofthe subject have the justness which  
they cl nm, they will have shewn tb t  
!on no ground what ver &lt;an an annul­  
j ment ol the proclamation of July Sd,»e  
reasonably required, as a preliminary  
to the negociation with w iich yti ire.  
charged. On the contrary, it clearly  
l results, from a recurrence to the causes  
and object of the proclamation, that, as  
&#x27; was at first intimated, the strong&#x27; st  
sanctions of fi. Britain herself, would  
; support the demand, that, previous to a  
I discussion of the proclamation, due •-a  
tisfaction should be made to the U  
States ; that this satisfaction ought to  
ex end to a 1 the wrongs which preo li­  
ed an * nr&#x27;oduceii that act ; and th it  
even limitin,; the merits of th question ,  
jto the single r, latum of the proolama­  
| tiop. to the wrong committed in the  
  
attack on, the American frigate, and  
deciding the question on the principle  
that a discontinuance of the lain r  
required of rfght a discontinuance &lt; f  
the former, nothing appears that doe*  
not have such a preliminary destitute  
of every foundation which could bt  
assumed for it.  
With a right to draw this conclusion,  
the President miehthave instructed mi  
inclose this communication, with the  
reply stated m tiie beginning of it ;  
and perhaps in taking this course, be  
would only .have consulted a sensibility,  
to which most governments would, in  
such a case, have yielded. But adher­  
ing to the moderation by which he has  
i invariably guided, and anxious to  
rescue the two nations from the cir­  
cumstances, under which an abortne  
issue to your missi.n, necessarily places j  
them, he has authorized me, in the)  
i vent of your disclosing the terms of  
reparation which you believe will be  
satisfactory, and on its appearing that J  
they are so, to consider this evidence of  
the justice of his Britannic majesty as a  
pledge for an elf dual interposition |  
with respect to all the abuses against !  
a recurrence of which the proclamation  
was meant to provide, and to proceed  
to concert with you, a revocation of  
that act, bearing the same date with  
the act of reparation to which the U.  
States are entitled.  
I am not unaware, sir, that acccrd­  
ing to the view which you appear to  
have taken of your instructions, such  
a course of preceeding has not been  
contemplated by them. It is possi­  
ble nevertheless, that a re-examina­  
tion, in the spirit in which I am well  
persuaded it will be made, may dis­  
cover them to be not inflexible to a  
proposition, in so high a degree, libe­  
ral and conciliatory. In every event  
the President will have manifested  
his willingness to meet your govern­  
ment on a ground of accommodation,  
which spares to its feelings, however  
misapplied he may deem them, eve­  
ry concession not essentially due to  
these which must be equally re­  
spected : and consequently will have  
demonstrated that the very ineligible  
i posture given to so important a sub­  
ject in the relations of the two  
countries, by the unsuccesful ter­  
mination, of your mission, can be re­  
ferred to no other seource, than the  
rigorous restrictions under which it  
was to be executed.  
I make no apology, sir, for *:he  
long interval between the date of  
your letter and that under which I  
write. It is rendered unnecessary  
by your knowledge of the circum­  
stances to which the delay is to be as­  
cribed.  
With high consideration and re­  
spect, I have the honor to be, sir,  
1 your most obt. servt

Tir—I have had the honor to receive and  
lay before the President, your letter of ibr  
26th January, in which you state, that you  
are ‘‘expressly precluded by your instructi­  
ons from entering upon any negotiation for  
the adjustment of the differences arising  
from the encounter of his Hritannick majes­  
tv’s ship the Leopard, and the frigate of the  
U. States, the Chesapeake, as long as the  
I it emulation of the President of the 2d of  
)v‘v, shall bcin force.”  
This demand. Sir, might justly suggest  
the simple answer, that before the procla­  
fn.tticn of the President could become a sub­  
ject of consideration, satisfaction should be  
made for the acknowledged aggression  
width j receded it. This is evidently agree­  
able to the ord*r of timid, to the order of

of usage, as maintained bv Cireat-Hritain,

i more prominent instances.  
| In the summerof the year 1804, the Bri­  
tish frigate the Cambrian,, with other, crui­  
sers in company, eirered theharb6rof N.  
York. The commander, captain Bradley,  
in violation of the port laws, relating both  
to health and revenue, caused a merchant  
vessel, iust arrived, and confessedly with­  
in the limits and under the authority of the  
lT. States, to be boarded, by persons under  
his command, who, after resisting the offi­  
cers of the port, in the legal exercise of  
their functions, actually impressed and car­  
ried off a number of seamen and p issengers  
into the service of the ships of war. On an  
appeal to his voluntary respect for the laws,  
he lirst failed to give up the offender to jus­  
tice and finally repelled the officer charged  
with the regular process for the purpose.  
This procedure was not only a flagrant  
insult to the sovereignty of the nation, but an j  
| infraction of its neutrality also, which did  
not permit a belligerent ship thus to aug-*J  
t meat ts force withih the neutral territo­  
ry.  
To frish the scerfei this commander  
went so far as to declare, in an official let­  
ter. to the minister plenipotentiary of his  
Britannic majesty, and by him communicat­  
ed^ this government, that he considered  
his sliip. whilst lying in the harbor of New­  
York, as having dominion around her, with­  
I in ihe distance of her buoys.  
All these circumstances were duly made  
i known \o the British government in just ex­  
pectation of honorable reparation. None  
has ever been offered. Captain Bradley  
was advanced from his frigate to the com­  
mand of a ship of the line.  
At a subsequent period, several British  
frigates under the command of Capt. Whit­  
by, of the Leander, pursuing the practice of  
vexing the inward and outward trade of our  
ports, and hovering for that purpose, about  
the entrance of that of New-York, closed a  
series of irregularities, with an attempt to  
arrest a coasting vessel, on board of which  
an American citizen was killed by a cannon  
ball which entered the vessel, whilst within  
| less than a mile from the shore.  
  
1 lie b ood of a citizen thus murdered, in  
a trade from one to another port of his own  
country, and within the sanctuary of its ter  
ritovial jurisdiction, could not fail to arouse  
the sensibility of the public, anil to make a  
solemn appeal to the justice &lt; f the Biitisi.  
government. The case was presented more­  
over t” that government by this, in the ac­  
cent M hrch it required • and with due coft  
iiden&#x27;Cfe that the offender would receive the  
cxen.p; ify pun shment which he deserted.  
That there might lie no tai.urc of legal proof  
of a f vet sufficiently notorious of itself, un­  
exccpti liable witnesses to establish it were  
sent to Great-Britain at the expence ot’ the  
U. S.  
Capt. Whitby was, notwithstanding hono­  
rably acquitted; no animadversion took,  
place on any other officer belonging to the  
squadron ; nor has any apology or explana­  
tion been made since the trial was over, as a  
conciliatory offering to the disappointment o.~  
this country at such a result,  
j A c ase t.f another r&#x27;«i iracter occurred in  
[ the mow h of Sept ltttrj. The Impetueux. a  
1- reach ship ef ,r4 guns, when aground within  
a fe&gt;v hundred yards of the shore of North­  
Caroli a, and therefore visibly within the  
territorial jurisdictw n and hospitable protec­  
tion of the United .States, was fired upon,  
1 boarded and burnt, from throe B ntisli ships  
1 of war, under the command of capt. Douglass.  
Having Completed this outrage on the sove­  
reignty and neutrality of the United States,  
the Hrit&#x27;sh commander ffe&#x27;.t no scruple in pro­  
ceeding thence into the waters near Norfolk,  
nor in thfe midst of the hospitalities enjoyed  
by bird, t&lt;$ add to tvhathad passed a refusal  
to discharge from bis ships, impressed citi­  
zens of the United States not denied to be  
such, on the p ea that the government of the  
United States had refused to surrender to  
the demand of Admiral Berke’eV, certain  
seamen allcdged to be British deserters; a  
demand which it is well.understood your go­  
vernment disclaims any l ight to make.  
It would be very superfluous to dwell oh  
the features which mark this aggravate J in­  
sult. l*ut 1 mus. be permitted to remind vou,  
that id ..ost-rious a light was a similar viola­  
tion t.f nbiltral territory, by the destruction  
of certain French ships ort the coast of Por­  
tugal, by a British squadron under the com­  
mand of admiral Bc&gt;c liven, regarded by the  
court of Great-Britain, that a minister ex­  
traordinary was dispatched for the express  
purpost of expiating the aggression on the  
  
Sovereignty o* afriendly power.  
Lastly presents itself, the attack by the  
British ship of \var, Leopard, on the Ameri­  
can frigate Chesapeake ; a case too familiar  
in all its circumstances to need a recital of  
any part of them. It is sufficient to remark,  
that the conclusive evidence which this e­  
vent added to that which Had preceeded, of  
the uncontrolled excesses of the British naval  
commanders, in Insulting our sovereignty, £e  
abusing our hospitality, determined the pre­  
Jsiderrtto cx end to ali British armed ships,  
the precaution heretotore applied to a few  
I by name, of interdicting to them the use and  
priv Hedges of our harbors and waters.  
This was done by his proC atnation of Ju­  
ly 2, lfor, referring to the series of oc­  
currences, ending with the aggression on the  
fng .tc Chesapeake,- at. the considerations  
requiring it. Audit the apprehension from  
.the iccntious spirit of the British naval com­  
Jmanders, thus tleve oped and uncontrolled,  
| which led to this measure o. precaution,  
could need other justification than was af­  
forded by what had passed, it would be am­  
ply found in the subsequent conduct of the  
ships under the command of the same capt.  
• Douglass.  
&#x27;1 &#x27;his&lt;.nicer, neither admonished by re­  
jections on the crisis produced by the attack  
on the Chesapeake, nor con.rolled by respect  
jlo* the law of nations, or the laws of the  
land, did not erase within ortr waters to  
; bring to by firing at vessels pursuing their  
regular course of trade ; and in the same  
&#x27;spirit which had displayed i,t.*.clf in the re­  
ft nt outi age committed on the American  
j frigate, he not only indulged himself in bos­  
|ti c threats, and indications of a hostile ap­  
| pruneh to Norfolk, l&gt;ut actually obs. meted  
our citizens in the ordinary communication  
between that and neighboring places, llis  
proci filings const tsited in nu t, a blockade  
of the purl, and as real an in\asion of the  
country, according to the extent of his force,  
as if troops had been debarked, &amp; the towh  
besieged on the land side.  
&#x27; Was it possib c for -.be Chief Magistrate  
I f a nation, who felt for its rights ami i • |&gt;n.  
not, ro dt) less than interpose some rrv amire  
f precaution, at )?&gt;**, against the repetition  
Q&amp;ftW&#x27;/iJit Which had been so long uncon­  
  
trolled by&#x27;the government whose officers had  
committed them, and which had, at last, ta­  
ken the exorbitant shape of hostility and of  
insult seen in the attack ou the frigate Che­  
sapeake ? Candor will pronounce that less  
could not be done ; and it will asVeadily ad­  
mit that the proclamation Comprising that  
measure, could not have breathed a more  
temperate spirit, nor spoken in a more Be­  
coming tone. IIow far it has received frftm  
those whose intrusions it prohibited, the  
respect due to the national authority, or been  
made the occasion of new indignities, needs  
noexpl &#x27;.nation.  
The President having interposed this pre­  
cautionary interdict, lost no time in instruc­  
ting the minister plenipotentiary of the Uni­  
ted States to represent to the British govern­  
ment the signal aggression which had been  
committed on their sovereignty and their flag,  
md to i squire the satisfaction due for it; in  
bulging the rxjK-Ciation, that his Britannic  
majesty would at once perceive it to be the  
truest magnanimity, as well as the strictest  
justice, to offer that prompt and full expia­  
tion of an acknowledged wrong, which would  
re-establish and improve both in fact and  
in feeling the state of things which it had vi­  
olated.  
This expectation was considered as not  
only honorable to the sentiments of his ma­  
jesty, but was supported by known exam­  
ples. in which, being the complaining party,  
lit- had required and obtained, as a prelimi­  
nary to any counter complaints whatever, a  
precise replacement of things, in every prac  
ticable circumstance, in their pre-existing  
situation.  
  
i nus in the year 17G4, Bermudians and ci­  
ther British subjects, who had according to  
annual custom, taken possession of Turk’s  
island for the season of making sa&#x27;t, having  
been forcib&#x27;y icmoved wi h their ves els, a \1  
effects b a French detachment from the isl  
and of St. Domingo, to which Turk’s island  
was alledgtd to lie an appurtenance, the Bri­  
tish ambai sadorat Paris, in persunnee of in­  
structions from his government, demanded,  
as a satisfaction for the violence committed  
that the pr cceditigs should be disavowed,  
the intention of acquiring Turk’s island dis­  
claimed, orders given for the immediate a­  
bandonment of it on the part of the Trench,  
every thing restored to the con lition in which  
it was at the time of the aggression, and rc  
partition made ofthc damages which any Bri­  
I l&#x27;sh subjects should be found to have sustain­  
ed, according to an estimation to be settled  
between the governors of St. Domingo and  
Jamaica. A compliance w ith the whole oi1  
.his demand was thc result.  
Again :—In the year 1789, certAin English  
merchants huving opened a trade at Nootka  
sound, on the north west coa6t of America,  
and attempted a settlement at that place,  
the Spaniards, who had long claimed that  
part of the world as their exclusive proper  
tv, dispatched a frigate from Mexico, w hich  
captured the two English vessels engaged  
in the trade, and broke up the settlement  
I on the coast. The Spanish government was  
tlte first to complain, in this case, of the in­  
t fusions committed by the British merchants.  
Fhe British government, however, demand­  
ed that the vessels taken by the Spanish fri­  
I g ’-tte should be restored, and adequate sa­  
tisfaction granted, Jircvious to any other  
(liiicu&amp;aion.  
1 his demand prevailed ; the Spanish gov­  
ernment agreeing to make full restoration  
of the captured vessels, and to indemnify the  
parties in&#x27;ercsted in them for the losses sus­  
tained. Thev restored also the build’ngs 8c  
tracts of land, of which the British subjects  
had been dispossessed. The British, howe­  
ver, soon give a proof of the ^little value  
they set . on the possession, by a voluntary  
dereliction} under which it has since re­  
mained. ... .  
The case which wi’l be noted last, though  
bf a date prior to the case of Nootka Sound,  
is that of Fa.kland’s Islands. These islands  
lie about one hundred leagues eastward of  
the streights of Magellan. The title to them  
hail been.a subject of controversy among se­  
veral of the maritime nations of Europe —  
From the position of the islands and other  
circumstances, the pretension of Spain bore  
an advantageous comparison with those of  
her competitors. In the year 1770, the Bri­  
tish took possession of Port Egmont in one  
of the islands, the Spaniards being at the  
time in possession df another part, and pro­  
testing against a settlement by the British.  
&#x27;Fife protest being without effect, ships and  
troops were sent from Buenos Ayres by the  
governor at that place, which forcibly dis­  
possessed and drove off&#x27;the British settlers.  
rI ne British government looki .g entirely  
to the dispossession by force, demanded as a  
specific condition of preserving harmony be­  
tween the two courts, not only the disavow­  
i al of the bpanis i pr ceedings, but that the  
affairs of that settlement should be inimedi­  
ately restored to the precise state in which  
they were previ &gt;us to the act of disposses­  
sion..Thebpatiibh government made somedif­  
  
iicuitics; requiring particularly a disavowal,  
on the part ci G. uritain, of ihe conduct of  
her officer at Falkland’s islands; which, it  
w as aliedged, gave occasion to thfc steps ta­  
ken by the Spanish governor;—and pro­  
posing an adjustment by mutual stipulation  
in the ordinary form. ,  
The reply was, that tKc moderation of his  
Britannic majesty having limited his de­  
j mand to t.ic smallest reparation he comd ac­  
cept tor the injury done, nothing was left  
for discussion but the mode of carrying the  
disavowal and restitution in o execution;_  
reparation losing its value if it be conditi­  
onal, and to be obtained by any stipulation  
I whatever from the party injured.  
The Spanish government yielded. The  
j vio ent proceedings of its officers were disa­  
vowed. Ihe tort, the port, and every thing  
else were agreed to be immediately restored  
to the precise situation which had been dis­  
turbed ; and duplicates of orders issued  
for the purpose to the Spanish officers, were  
delivered into the hands of one of the Bri­  
tish principal secretaries ol state. Here a  
gain it is to be remarked, that satisfaction  
having been made for the forcible dis­  
j possession, the islands lost their Importance  
| in tue e\us of rhe British government, were  
in a snort time evacuated, and port Egniont  
remains with every other part of them in tin  
hands of Spain.  
( onId stronger pledges have been given  
than are here lotind, that an honorable and  
instant reparation would be made in a case  
differing no other wi&gt;c from those recited,  
than as it furnished to the same monarch  
of a great nation, an opportunity to prove,  
that adln ring always to the same immuta­  
ble principle, lie was as ready to do right  
to others, as to request it for himself*  
Returning to the instructions given to the  
minister jriraipotriitiarjr of the 0. States at  
i&quot; Err&#x27;d&#x27;nr, I art) to observe that the President  
thought it just and expedient to insert as a  
necessary ingredient in the adjustment ol  
the outrage committed on the American fri­  
  
... - .- • ■  
gate, a security against tht: future practice  
«f the British naval commanders, in impress­  
ing from merchant vessels of the U. States,  
on the high seas, such of thteir crews as they  
ni’ght undertake to denominate British sub­  
jects.  
Fo this Association of the two subjects, the  
President was determined,^st, bv his regar­  
ding both as resting on kindred principles;  
the Immunity of private ships, with the  
known exceptions made bv the laws of nati­  
ons, laung as well established as that ofpHb­  
l*c jdtips ; and there being no pretext for in­  
cluding in these exceptions tlfe impressment  
(it it could be freed from its enormous. and  
notorious abuses) of the subjects of a bellige­  
rent by the officers of that belligerent. The  
rights of a belligerent against the ships of a  
neutral nation, accrue merely from the rela­  
tion of the neutral to the other belligerent,  
ns in conveying to him contraband of war, or  
in. suppivil g a blockaded port.  
I lie claim of a belligerent to search for  
and seize on board neutral vessels on the  
high seas, persons under liis allegiance, does  
not thcrcfoi e rest on any belligerent right un­  
der the law of nation&#x27;s, butiei k prerogative  
derived from municipal law ; and involves  
the extravagant supposition, that one nati­  
on has a right to execute at all t;mcs and  
ih all cases, its municipal laws and regulati­  
ons; on board the ships of another nation,  
not being wi hin its territorial limits.  
( lie President was led to ilie same de­  
termination, 2dly, by liis desire of convert­  
ing a particular incident into an oocasibn  
for removing another and more extensive  
source of danger to the harmony of the two  
countries: and Silly, by his persuasion, that  
the liberality of the propositions authorised  
with liis view, Would not fail to induce the  
read , concurrence of his Britannic majesty ;  
•ind that the more extensive source of irri­  
tation ar.d perplexity being removed, a sa­  
tisfactory adjustment of the particular inci­  
dent would be tireless difficult. The Presi­  
dent still thinks that Such would have bee &gt;  
’he tendency of the mode for which lie h id  
provided; and lie cannot, therefore, but re­  
gret that the door was shut against the ex­  
periment, by the peremptory refusal of Mr.  
Canning to admit it into discussion, even in  
the most informal mmiU&#x27;er, as was Suggested  
  
n .vi p. Monroe.  
I lie President felt the greater regret, a­  
• lie step he had taken towards a m&#x27;»re enlar­  
ged and lasting accommodation’, became  
thus a bar to the adjustment of the particu­  
lar and recent aggression which had been  
committed against the United States. He  
found, however, an alleviation in the signi­  
fied purpose of his Britannic majesty, to  
charge wi,h this adjustment a special mis­  
sion to the United States which, restricted  
as it was. seemed to indicate a disposition  
tiom which a liberal and conciliatory ar­  
rangement ol one great object at least  
might be confidently expected.  
In this confidence, your arrival was a­  
waited with every friendly solicitude ; and  
our first interview having opened the way by  
an acquiescence in the separation of the two  
cases insisted oh by his Britannic nrtajesty,  
notwithstanding the strong grounds on which  
they had been united by the President, it  
was not to be doubted that a tender of the  
satisfaction claimed by the United States  
tor a distinguished and acknowledged iasul.  
I&gt;v one oi his officers, would immediately fol­  
low.  
It was not, therefore, without a v«ryr pain­  
ful surprise, that the error of this expecta­  
tion was discovered. Instead of the satis­  
faction due from the original aggressor, it  
was anuouiiccd that the first step towards  
the adjustment must proceed from the par­  
ty injuied . and your letter now before me  
I formally repeats, that as long as the proc­  
lamation of the President&#x27; which issued oh  
the 2d Julyr, 1807, shall be in force, it will  
be an .nsupei able obstacle to a negociation,  
even on the subject of the aggression which  
preceded it; in other words, that the proc­  
lamation must be put out of force, bcfoi e  
an adjustment of the aggression can be ta- j  
keu into discussion.  
In explaining the grounds of this extraor­  
dinary demand, it is ailedged to oe sup- l  
ported by the consideration that the proceed- I  
ing and pretension of tne offending officer h ts .  
been d sa\ owed : that general assurances  
a* t given oi a disposition anti intention iH his *  
Britannic majesty to make satisfaction ; that j  
a special minister was dispatched w ith !  
promptitude for the purpose ot carrying in.o &#x27;  
effect this disposition ; and that you have a \
personal conviction that the particular terms  
which you aie not at liberty previously to  
disclose, will be deemed by the United  
States satisfactory. j  
V» itli respect t. the disavowal i‘ would be  
unjust not to regar i it as a proof o: candor  
and amity towards the United biuies and  
as some presage ot the voluntary reparation  
wh ch it implied to he due But tlie disa­  
vowal can be the less coiuounded with the  
reparation itself; since it was sufficiently  
required by the respect which Great Britain  
owed to her own honor; it being impossible  
that an cn ightened government, had hostili­  
ty been mcdititcd, would have commenced  
it in such a manner, and in the midst of ex­  
isting professions of peace and friendship.  
She owed it also to consistency with the clis-!  
avowal on a former occasion in which the  
pretension had been enforced bv a British  
squadron against the sloop of war Baltimore  
belonging to the U. S. ; and finally to the in- j  
terest wnich G. Britain has, mere than any  
othernation, in disclaiming a principle which  
would expose her superior number of ships  
of war, to so many indignities from inferior  
nations.  
  
As little can the general assurances that I  
reparation would be made, claim a return  
which could properly follow the actual repa-1  
ration only. They cannot amount to more  
than a disposition, or at most a promise to;  
do what the aggressor may deem a fulfil- j  
merit of his obligation. They do not prove  
even a disposition to do what may be satisfac­  
tory to the injured party, who cannot have  
less than anerpia. right to decide on the suf­  
ficiency of the redress.  
In dispatching a special minister for the  
purpose of adjusting the difference, the LT.  
States ought cheerfully to acknowledge all  
the proof it affords on the part of his hritan­  
n.c majesty of his pacific viewstowards them,  
and of his respect ior their friendship, tt.it  
whilst they could not, under any circumstan­  
ces, allow to the measure more than a cer­  
tain participation in an honorable reparati­  
on, it is to be recollected that the avowed  
md primary object of the mission was to sub­  
stitute lor the more extended adjustment pro­  
posed by the 17. States at London, a separa­  
tion of the subjects as preferred Ivy his Bri­  
tannic majesty, and you well know, sir, how  
fully this object was accomplished.  
VV ith respect to the pci*.«uiial conviction  
which you have expressed, that the terms  
which you decline to disclose would be sa­  
tisfactory to the IJ. States, it is incumbent  
on me to observe that with the highest ics­  
  
peet for your judgment ahd the *nr.at perfect  
confidence in your sincerity. Mi insupera­  
ble objection manifest:*, lies, to thu accept­  
ance ot a personal aud unexplained opinion,  
in place ot a disclosure which would enable  
this government to exercise its own j.ulg- ,  
ment in a case affecting so essentially itxhor  
nor and its rrghts. Such a course of proceed­  
ing would be without example; and theie  
can be no hazard in saying that cue will ne­  
ver be afforded by a government which res­  
pects itself as much ai yours justly does ; and  
therefore can never he reasonably* expected  
from one which respects itself as much as  
this lias a right to do.  
j 1 forbear, sir, to enlarge on the intrinsic  
incongruity of the expedient proposed, lint  
I must be allowed to remark, as an add At­  
onal admonition of the singular and mortify­  
ing perplexity in Which a compliance might  
involve the President, that there are in the  
letter of Mr. Canning, communicating to  
Mr. Mutiroe the special mission to tlie LL  
**• pregnant indications that other cpiestious  
and conditions may have been contemplated  
which would be found utierlv irreconcileab.e  
with thy sentiments of this nation.  
It neither any nor all of the-c considerati­  
ons can sustain thh preliminary deni aud mat c  
in your conmiunica i.ai, it remains to be seen  
whether such a drinavd rests with greater  
.•dvantage on the more predise ground ou  
which you finally ? eni to place it.  
I he proclamation is rpnsidered as a lios­  
ti e me .sure, £&lt; ;t discontinuance of it dstlue  
to the discontinuance of the aggression  
w *iic.li led to it. *  
It has been sufficiently shewn that he  
proclamation, as appears on tlie facb of it*  
was pm. iced by .1 liainof occurrencester­  
mina&gt;ing in the&#x27;attack on the A .ufci ican fri­  
j gate, and not bv this last alone. To a demand  
| therefore that the pr&lt;&gt;clamaii*n be revoked,  
&#x27;t would he perfect y fair to oppose a de­  
niHiul that redress he first given for the nu­  
merous irregularities which preteued the  
aggression on the American frigate, as&#x27;sVtil  
as^tor this particular aggression, and that  
I effectual com foul be interposed against rd­  
Ipetitions of them. And as no such redress  
has been giteii for the past, notwithstanding  
the lapse of time which has taken place, nor  
any&#x27; such security for the future, notwith­  
standing the undihsinished-reasonableness of  
it, it follows, th l a continuance of the pro­  
claim!. ion would ;c consistent with an entire  
discontinuance nr one only of the occurrences  
from which it proceeded.  
  
nut it is not necessary to avail the argu  
mei.i of this View of the case, although of  
ivselt entirely conclusive. Mad the procla­  
mation been founded on the single aggression  
commitn d i n the Chesapeake, and wereit  
admitted hat the discontinuance ot that ng­  
gi ession merely, gave a ciaim to tlie discon­  
tinuance of the proclamation* the claim  
would be defeated by the incontestable fact,  
that that aggression has not been discontin­  
ued. It has never ceased to exist; and it is  
in existence at this moment. Meed I re­  
mind you, sir, that the seizure and asportati­  
on of the sbamen belonging t &gt; the crew of  
the Chesapeake, cn ered into the very es­  
sence ot that aggi ession, that with an ex­  
ception of the victim to a trial forbidden l&gt;y  
the most solemn considerations, and greatly  
aggravating the guilt of its author, t.ic sea­  
men in question are still retained, and c &gt;n­  
sequently that the aggression, if in non her  
respect, is by that act alone continued and  
in fokce ?  
It the views which have been taken of the  
subject have the justness which they claim,  
they will have shewn that on nogiouiid what  
ever c.in an annulment of the proclamation  
of July id, he reasonably required, as a pre­  
liminary to the negotiation with which you  
are charged. On the contrary, it clearly re­  
sults, from a recukrence to the causes and  
object of the proclamation, that, as was at  
first intimated, tile strongest saricti jus of G.  
Hritaih herself, vfrouid support the demand,  
that previous to a discussion of the procla­  
mation, iluc sutis:action should be made to  
the^ United .obites; that tins satisfaction  
ougntio extend to all the wrongs wbicn pre­  
ce«ied and produced that act i aud that e­  
ven limiting the merits of th question to the  
single relation ox the proclamation to the  
wrong committed in he attack on the Ame­  
i lean Irigate, and deciding the question on  
the principle that a disc .‘..tinuance of the  
latter required of kight a discontinuance of  
tlie former, nothing appears that does not  
leave such a pre.iminai y destitute of every  
foundation wh.eli co lid be assumed for it. •&#x27;  
  
• v&#x27; U!1 ofight to draw this conclusion, the  
President might have instructed me to c:o‘c  
this Communication, with tlie reply stated  
in the^ beginning of it; and perhaps in ta­  
king t.iis course, he would onlv hateconsuh*  
ed a sensibility to which most governments  
would, in such a case, have yielded. lint  
adhering to tlie moderation bv which helms  
been invariably guided, and anxious ty res­  
cue the two nations from the circumstances;  
under .vhich an abortive issue to your mis­  
sion, necessarily places them, helms autho­  
rised me, in the event of your disclosing the  
terms of reparation which you believe will  
he satisfactory, and on ifs appearing that  
they arc so, to consider this evidence of tlie  
justice of his Britannic majesty as a pledge  
for an effectual interposition with respect  
to all the abuses against a recurrence of  
which tiic Proclamation was meant to pro  
vide, and to proceed to concert- wi$h \ou#  
a revocation of that act, bearing the same  
date with the act of reparation to which the  
United States are entitled.  
I am not unaware, sir, that according to  
the view which you appear tb have taken of  
your instructions, suen a course of proceed­  
ing has not been contemplated by them. It  
is possible nevertheless, that a re examina­  
tion, in the spirit in which I am well per­  
suaded it will be made, nmv discover them  
to be not inflexible to a proposition, in .*?  
high a degree, liberal and conciliatory. In  
every event the President wnl have mini­  
fested his willingness to mectyuur govtrn­  
rtlent on a ground of accommodation, which  
spares to its feelings, however misapplied  
he may deem them, (very conces&#x27;-iori not  
essentially due to those which must he equal­  
ly respected: and consequently will h.ive  
demonstrated that the very ineligible postore  
given to so important a subject in the relati­  
ons of the two countries, by the unsuccess­  
ful termination, of your mission, can he re­  
ferred to no other source, than the r gorans  
restrictions under which it was to be execu­  
ted.  
1 make no apology, sir,-for the long inter­  
val between the date (f your ettcrand that  
under which 1 write. It is rendered unne­

I have had the honor to receive and  
lay before the President, your letter of tho  
Jfdli January, in which you state, that you  
are “ expressly precluded l*v your instructi­  
ons from entering upon aiiy negociation for  
the adjustment of the differences arising

i his demand, sir, might justly suggest  
the simple answer, that before the procla­  
mation of the President could become h sub­  
ject ot consideration, satisfaction should b«  
made for the acknowledged aggression which  
preceded it. This is evidently nerrcublo  
to the order of time, to the order of reason,  
and, it may be added, to the order of usage,  
as maintained by Great Britain, whenever  
in analogous cases, she has lieen the coni*  
plaining party.  
But as y&lt;»t* have subjoined to the prelimi­

it will best accord with (lib candor ot the

Tint irregularities of his Britannic majesty&#x27;s  
ships of war, in making the hospitalities of  
our ports subservient to the annoyance ct  
our trade, both outward and inward, a  
practice not only contrary to the principles  
of public law, hut expressly contrary to  
ordinances enforced during maritime wars,  
to which sne bore a neutral relation, I am  
constrained, unwelcome as the task is, to  
call your attention to the following more  
prominent instances.  
In the summer of the year 1804, the  
British Frigate the Cambrian, with other  
cruizers in company, entered the harbor  
of New York The commander, captain  
Bradley, in violation of the port laws, rela­  
ting both to health and revenue, caused a  
merchant vessel, just arrived, and confes­  
sedly wifhin the limits and under the au­  
thority of the United States, to be board­  
ed by persons under his command, who af­  
ter resisting the officers of the port, in the  
legal exercise of the r functions, actually  
impressed and carried off a number of sea­  
men and passengers into the scrvici of the  
ships of war On an appeal to Ins volun­  
tary respect for the laws, he first failed to  
give up the offender to justice, and finally  
repelied the officer charged with the regu­  
Ini process for the purpose.  
, Ibis procedure was not only a flagrant  
insult to the sovereignty of the*nation, but  
an infraction of its neutrality als.,, -which  
did not permit a be iligt rent sli p thus to  
augment its force within the neutral terri­  
tory.  
1 o finish the scene, this commander went  
so far as to declare, in an official letter, to  
the minister plenipotentiary of his Britan­  
nic majesty&#x27;, and by him communicated to  
this government, that he conudered his  
Ship, Whilst lying in the harbor of New  
v ork, as having dominion around her, with •  
in the distance of her buoy s.  
Ail these circumstances wi re duly made  
known to tire British government in just  
expectation oflionorable reparation. None  
lias ever been offered. Capt. Bradley was  
advanced from his frigate to the command  
of a ship of the line  
  
At a subsequent period,fcseveral British  
frigates under the command of captain  
Whitby, of the Lean tier, pursuing the  
practice of vexing the inward and outwart  
trade of our ports, and hovering for that  
purpose about the entrance of that of New  
Vork, closed a series of irregularities, with  
an attempt to arrest a coasting vessel, on  
board of which nn American citizen was  
killed by a cannon ball which entered the  
vessel, whilst within less than a mile of the  
Shore.  
The blood of a citizen thus murdered, in  
a track from one to another port of his coun­  
ty, and Within the sanctuary of i»s territo.  
rial jurisdiction, could not fail to arouse the  
sensibility of the public, and to make a so­  
lemu appeal to the justice of the British go­  
vernment. Tiic_c .se was presented more­  
over to that government by this, in the ac­  
cent which it required ; and with due con­  
fidence ill it th : offender would receive the  
exemplary punishment which he deserved.  
That there might be no failure of legal  
proof of a fact sufficiently notorious of itself,  
unexceptionable witnesses to establish itj  
were sent »o Great Britain at the expense  
of the United States.  
C*pt Wliuby was, notwithstanding, ho­  
norary acquitted ; no animadversion took  
place n any other officer belonging to the  
• squadron; nor has any apo&#x27;ogv or explana­  
tion been made since fie trial’was over, as  
a conciliatory offering to the disappointment  
of this country at such a result.  
A case of another charmer occurred in  
the month of September, J30 0. Thelmpc­  
tu* ux, a t rer.ch ship or 74 runs, wh n a­  
giound within a few hundred yards of the  
snore, of North-Carolina, and therefore vi­  
sibly wnhiii the territorial jurisdiction and  
hospitable protection of the United States,  
was fired up. n. boarded and hi,. n»  
  
three British ships &gt; t war, under the com­  
mand ot capt Douglass. Having completed  
tins outrage on the sovereignty and neutra­  
lity of the United States, the British com­  
mander felt no scruple in proceeding thence,  
into the waters near Norfolk, nor in the  
midst of the hospitalities enjoyed by him, to  
add to what had passed, a refusal to dis­  
charge from his ships, impressed citizens  
of the United States, not denied to be such,  
on the plea, that the government of he U­  
nited States had refused to surrender to the  
demand of admiral Berkeley, certain sea­  
men a Hedged ,o he British deserters ; a de­  
mand which it is well understood, your go.  
vernment declaims any right to make.  
It would be very superfluous to dwell on  
the features Which mark this aggravated  
insult. Hut I must he j ermitted to remind  
you, that in so serious a light was a similar  
violation or neutral territory, by the de­  
struction of certain Frcnch ships on the  
coast of Portugal, by a British squadron un­  
cicr t!icj command of ^dmiriil Hoscawan*  
regarded by the court of Great Britain, that  
a minister extraordinary was dispatched  
f r the express purpose of expiating the  
aggression on the sovereignty of a friendly  
power. J  
Lastly presents itself, the attack by the  
British ship of war Leopard, on the Ameri­  
can frigate Chesapeake, a case too familiar  
in all Its circumstance* to need a recital of  
nnv p&lt;m of them. It is sufficient to remark  
that the conclusive evidence, which this  
*&#x27;*cot added to that which had preceded, ol  
the uncontrolled excesses of the British na­  
vsi! commander*, in insulting our sovereign­  
ty an,l abusing our hospitality, determined  
the president to extend to all British armed  
ships, the precaution heretofore applied to  
a few by name, of interdicting to them the  
use and privileges of our harbours and wa.  
ters.  
This was done by his proclamation of July  
2, 1H07, referring to the series of occur­  
rences, ending with the aggression on the  
frigate Chesapeake, ah the considerations  
requiring it. And if the apprehension from  
the licentious spirit of the British n%\ il  
commanders, thus developed and uncon­  
trolled, Which led to this measure of pre­  
caution, could need other justification than  
was afforded by what h id passed, it would  
be amply found in the subsequent conduct  
©f the ships under the command of the same  
captain Douglass.  
Tbis officer, neither admonished by re­  
flections on the crisis produced bv the at­  
tack (Hi the Chesapeake, nor controlled by  
reject f.ir the law of nations, or the laws  
*• the land, did not ce«*sa within our waters  
\\*\
  
to bring to, by firing at vessels pursuing i  
their regular course of trade; and in the i  
same spirit which had displayed itself in the j&gt;  
recent outrage committed on the American |&lt;  
frigate, he not-only indulged himself in hos­  
tile threats, and in ii dicutlous of a hostile 1  
approach to Norfolk, but actually obstruct- , !  
ed oui citizens in the ordinary communica- .  
tion between that and neighbouring places 11  
His proceedings constituted in fact, a bloc- I  
kude ot the port, and as real an invasion of &#x27;  
the country, according to the extent of his  
force, as if troops hud been debarked, and  
tiie town besieged on the land side.  
Was it possible for the chief magistrate  
of a nation, who felt for its rights and its  
honor, to do less than interpose some mea­  
surc of precaution, at luast against the re- !  
petition of enormities which had been so (  
long uncontrolled by the government whose &#x27;  
officers had committed them, and which had  
atlas*, taken the exorbitant shape of hostility  
and of insult seen in the attack on the fri­  
gate Chesapeake? Candor will pronounce  
that less could not be done ; and it will ns  
readily admit that the pr«&gt;clamatton com­  
prising that measure,could not have breath­  
ed a more temperate spirit, nor spoken in  
; a more becoming tone. How far it has re­  
ceived from those, whose intrusions it pro­  
hi- ited, the respect due to the national  
authority, or been made the cccnsion of new  
indignities, needs no explanation.  
1 lie president having interposed this  
precautionary interdict, lost no time in in­  
structing t e minister plenipotentiary of  
the U States, to represent to the British  
government the signal aggression which  
had he* n committed on their sovereignty  
: and tlu-ir flag, and to require the satistac  
| tion due for it; indulging the expectation  
j that his Britannic majesty would at once  
  
1 as weli as the strictest justice, to offer  
I that prompt and full expiation of an ac­  
knowledged wrong which would re-estnb­  
; lish and improve, both in fact and in feel­  
ing, the state of things which it had vio­  
j laied.  
1 iiis expectation was considered as not  
j only honorable to the sentiments of his  
, majesty, hut was supported by known ex­  
amples, in which, being the complaining  
&#x27;party, he had required and obtained, as a  
; preliminary to ary counter comp&#x27;aints  
: whatever, a precise replacement of things,  
in every practicable circumstance, in their  
i pre existing situation.  
I Inis in the year 1764, Bermudians and  
i other British subjects, who had according  
I to annual custom, taken possesion of Turk’s  
I island for the season of making salt, having  
&#x27;been forcibly removed witli thpti&gt; ,*r&gt;ccdc  
  
j and effects by a French detachment from  
j the island of St. Doming®, to which Turk’s  
island .was alledged to be an appurtenance,  
the British ambassador at Paris, in pursu­  
ance of instructions from his government,  
demanded, as a satisfaction for the violence  
committed, that the proceedings should he  
, disavowed, t he intention of acquiring Turk’s  
i island disclaimed, orders given for the im­  
mediate abandonment of it on the part of  
jthe French, every thing restored to the  
condition in which it was at the time of the  
aggression, and reparation made of the da­  
mages which any British subject should be  
, found.to have sustained, according to an es­  
timation to be settled between the govern*  
ors o{ St. Domingo and Jamaica. A compli­  
ance with the whole of this demand was the  
result.  
Agjiii :—In the tear 1789, certain English  
merchants having opene l a trade at Nootka  
, Sound, on the north west coast of America  
•an«l attemotpd a settlement at that place, the  
! Spaniards, win. h. d long claim cl hat part of  
the world as their exclusive property, dispatch­  
. ed a Obg r from Mexico, which captured the  
t wo E iglish vess -Is engaged in the trade, and  
• up the si- dement &lt;&gt;n the coast. The  
I Spanish government was the first to complain  
in this. case, of tlie intrusions committed by  
the 11 itish merchants. The British govern­  
ment, however, demanded tliat the vess. ls ,a­  
ken by the Spanish frigU’c should H.- rc *.»reo,  
j H&quot;d adequate i&gt; faction granted, previous to  
any other liitcustinn

! mc&quot;t agreeing to make full restoration of the- &#x27;  
j captured vessel,,, and to indemnify the* par i s I  
i interested in them for the losses sustained.— ;  
I They restored also thi buildings an l tr^ets of j  
i land. &gt;&gt;f wliirii it... p.i.:i*.di. o .i. i e  
  
dispossessed The British, however, soon &#x27;  
gave h proof i f tlit. little value they set on J  
tlie possession, by a voluntary dereliction, un- i  
tier which it has since remained.  
Tlie case which will be noted last tho’ -&gt;f  
a date prior to the case of^Nixitka sound, is  
tluit of Falkland’* islands. Tht-nc island* lie  
about 100leagues eastward of the straights of  
Magellan. The Cde to them h.«;l been i» sub­  
jectof controversy amongseveral of ihe ma­  
riiimc nations of Europe. From the position of  
the islands, and ocher circumstances, the pr«­  
tension of Spain Imre an advautc grons romp*,  
rison with those of her competitors. In the  
yeae 1770, tlie British took possession of Port  
Eg mot ft, inri.c* of the islands ; the Spaniards  
being .»t the time in possession of snotlirr part,  
and prote sting against a settlement by tlr Uti  
tesh. The protest being without effect, ship*  
a:c.l troops were sent from Bueno* Ayres, hv  
the governor of that place, whirh forcibly dis­  
possessed and drove oil Hie Hr; i,n settlers.  
The British governme nt. Iook.i:,e entire ly to  
tlie (hs;K}sse*sion by force, demanded a* a&#x27;spe­  
cdic condition «.f prrsolving harmony between  
the two courts, not only tin- disavowal of die  
Spanish nrocecdi ig; hut that tlie affair* of  
tiini seltl inc-nt should he immediately restored  
to the precise state ip which they were previ­  
ous to the net of disposHt--sion ’The Spanish  
government made some difficulties ; requiring  
part iculnily a disavowal on tfie purl of Great  
Britain, ol the conduct of her officer at Falk

occasion to thf steps taken by the Spanish go­  
vernor; and proposing »n adjustment by mutu­  
al stipulation* m tlie ordinary form.  
1 he reply was, that the moderation of his  
II &quot;ttannic majesty having limited lus demand  
to the.smallest reparation be could accept for  
the injury done, nothing was left for discussi- ,  
on hut the mode of carry ing the disavowal and  
restitution into execution / reparation losing it* &#x27;

Could stronger pledges have been given,  
han are here found, that an h.&#x27;norab.e and i  
nstant reparation would be made in a case,  
liffsring no otherwise from those recited,  
;han as it furnished to the same monarch &lt;  
&gt;f a great nation, an opportunity to prove, j  
;l»at adhering always to the same immuta­  
ble principle, he was as ready to do right j  
:o others, as to require it for himself.  
Returning to the instructions given to the !  
minister plenipotentiary of the United  
stales at London, 1 am to observe, that the  
President thought it just and expedient to  
insert, as a necessary ingredient in the ad­  
justment of the outrage committed on the  
American frigate, a security agajnst the  
future practice of British naval command­  
ers, in impressing from merchant vessels  
of the U. S on ihe high seas, such of their  
crews as they migat undertake to denomi­  
nate Rritish subjects.  
To this association of the two subjects, i  
the President was determined, 1st, by his  
regarding both as resting on kindred prin­  
ciples, the immunity of private ships, with  
the known exceptions made by the law of  
nations, being as well established as that of  
public ships ; and there being no pretext  
for including in these exceptions the im­  
pressment (if it could be freed from its en­  
ormous and notorious abuses) of the subjects  
of a belligerent, by the officers of that belli­  
gerent. The rights of a belligerent, against  
the ships of a neutral nation, accrue merely  
from the relation of the neutral to the othe r  
belligerent, as in conveying to him contra­  
band of war, or in supplying a blockaded  
port.  
The claim of a belligerent to search for  
and seize on board neutral vessels on the  
high seas, persons under his allegiance,  
does not therefore rest on any belligerent .  
right under the law of nations, but on .1 pi e* :  
rogative derived from municipal law ; and  
involves the extravagant supposition, that  
one nation has a right to execute at all times  
and in all cases, its rnunicinal law* »n»l m. !  
  
filiations, on board tlu- ships of another na­  
tion, not being within its territorial limits.  
The President was led to the same de­  
termination, 2dly, by his desire of convert­  
ir.g a particular incident, into an occasion  
for removing another and more extensive  
source cf danger to ihe harmony of the two  
countries : And 3dly, by his persuasion  
that the liberality of the propositions autho­  
rised with this view, would ndt fail to in­  
duce the ready concurrence of his Britan­  
nic majesty ; and that the mure extensive  
source of irritation and perplexity being re­  
moved, a satisfactory adjustment of the par­  
ticular incident would be the less difficult.  
The President still thinks that such would  
have been the tendency of the mode for  
which he had provided ; and he cannot  
therefore but regret that the door was-shut  
against the experiment, by the peremptory  
refusal of Mr- Canning to admit it into dis­  
cussion. even in the most informal manner,  
as was suggested by Mr Monroe.  
The President felt the greater regret, as  
the step he had taken towards a more en­  
larged and lasting accommodation became  
thus a bar to the adjustment of the particu­  
lar and recent aggression which had been  
committed against the U. S. He found how­  
ev&lt; ran alleviation, »n the signified purpose  
of his Britannic majesty, to charge with  
&lt;his adjustment a special mission to the U.  
S which, restricted as it was, seemed to in­  
dicate a disposition from which a lioeral  
anti conciliatory arrangement of one great  
object at least might be confidently expec­  
ted. &#x27;  
In this cohfidence, your arrival w.i6 a­  
waited with every friendly solicitude ; and  
our first interview having opened the way,  
by an acquiescence in the scparat.on of the  
two cases insisted on by his Britannic ma­  
jesty, notwithstanding the strong ground on  
which they had been un ted by the Presi­  
dent, it was not to be doubted that a tender  
of the satisfaction claimed by the U. S. for  
a distinguish d and an acknowledged insult,  
by one of lus officers, would immediately  
follow.  
it was not, thcrefcyi, without a very pain­  
ful surprise, that the error of this expec­  
tation was &lt;i »covered. Instead of the sa­  
tisfaction one from the original aggression,  
it was announced &#x27;hat the first step towards  
the adjustment must proceed from the par­  
ty injured ; and you: letter now before me.  
  
airmail) repeals, that as long as the pio­  
c amation of the Picsident, which issued on  
the 2d July, 1807, shall he in force, it will  
be an insuperable obstacle to a negociatim,  
even on the subject of the aggression whicn  
preceded it ; in other words, that the pro­  
clamation must he put out of force, before  
an adjustment of the aggression can be ta­  
ken into discussion.  
In explaining the grounds of this extra­  
ordinary &#x27;demand, it is alledgcd to be sup­  
port ! by the consideration that the procee­  
ding and pretension of the offending officer  
has been disavowed : that general assuran­  
ces are given of a disposition and m ention  
in his Britannic majesty to make satisfacti­  
on ; that a special minister was dispatched ■  
with promptitude for the purpose of carry­  
ing into effect this disposition : and that yqu  
liave a personal conviction that the parti­  
cular terms, which you are not at liberty  
previously to disclose, will be deemed by  
he U. S. satisfactory.  
With respect to the disavowal, it would  
&gt;e unjust not to regard it as a proof of can­  
lor and amity towards the U. S. and as  
lome presage of the voluntary feparation  
which it implied to be due. But the disa­  
vowal can he the less confounded with the  
reparation itself; since it was sufficiently j  
r. q »*-cd by the respect which Great Brit- ■  
do owed to her own lionm*; it being impos- |  
able that an enlightened government, had  
mstility been meditated, would have com­  
menced it in such a manner, and in the  
nidst of existing professions o peace and  
riendship. Hbe owed it also to cousisten- ;  
:y with * disavowal on a former occasion, )  
n wh ch the pretension had been enforced  
&gt;y a British squadron, against the sloop of  
var Baltimore, belonging to the United  
itatea, and finally to the interest whi#h t  
Jreat Britain has, more than any other na- !  
ion, in disclaiming aprinr.ip e which would j  
xpose her ‘•&#x27;ipcrior number of ships of war, J  
o so many indignities from inferior na­  
ies.  
As litf.eean the general assurances that  
  
•eparation would be tr.atic, claim a return  
vhich could properly follow the actual re­  
&gt;irration only. They cannot amount to more  
:han a disposition, or at most a promise, to  
1o what the aggressor may deem a fulfil- i  
rnent of his obligation. They do not prove t  
even a disposition to do whatiuay be satisfac­  
tory to the injured party who cannot have less  
than an equal right to decide on the sufficien- I  
cy of the redress.  
In dispatchmga special minister for the j  
purpose of adjusting the diffts cncc, the Ti­  
nned States ought cheerfully to acknowl­  
edge all the proof it affords on the part  
of his Biitanic majesty, of his pacific views  
towards them, and of his respect for their  
friendship. Hut whilst they could not, un­  
der any circumstances, allow to the mea­  
sure more than a certain participation in  
an honorable reparation, it is to be recol­  
lected that the avowed ; nci primary object  
of the mission was to substitute for tiic more  
extended adjustment proposed bv the Uni­  
ted States, at London, a separation of the  
subjects, as preferred by his Britanic ma­  
jesty ; and you well know, sir, how fully  
this object was accomplished.  
With respect to the persona! conviction  
which you have expressed, that the terms  
which you decline to disclose, would be sat­  
isfactory to the United States, it is incum­  
bent on me to observe, that with the highest  
  
respect tor your judgment, and the mostjper­  
fect confidence in your sincerity an i..*-, ar­  
able objection manifestly lies, to the accept­  
ance ot a personal and unexplained op.mon,  
in place of a disclosure which would enable  
this government to exercise its own judg­  
ment in a case affecting so essentially its  
honor and its rights. Such a course ot pro­  
ceeding would be without example ; and  
there can be no hazard in saying that one  
will never be afforded bya government which  
respects itself as much as yours justly does ;  
and therefore can never be reasonably ex­  
pected from one which respects itself as  
much as this has .a right to do  
I forbear, sir, to enlarge on the intrinsic  
incongruity of the expedient proposed.  
But 1 must be allowed to remark, as an  
additional adiuoi&#x27;ition of ihe sirg ilar and mor­  
tifying perplexity in which a compliance  
might involve the President, that there are in  
ihe letter of Mr. Canning, communicating Vo  
Mr. Monroe the special mission of the United  
States, pregnant indications that other ques­  
tions and conditions may have been contempla­  
ted* which would he found utterly irreconcila­  
ble with the sentiments of this nation.  
If neither any nor.all of these considerations  
can sustain the preliminary demand made in  
your communication, it remains to be seen  
whether sucli a demand rests with greater ad­  
vantage on the more precise ground on wii.cii  
you finally seem to place it.  
The proclamation is considered as a hostile  
measure, and a discontinuance of it as due to  
the discontinuance 01 the aggression which led  
to it.  
It has been sufficiently shewn that the  
proclamation, as appears on the face of it,  
was produced by a train of occurrences ter­  
minating in the attack on the American  
frigate, and not by th;3 last alone. To a  
demand, therefore, that the proclamation  
lie revoked, it would be perfectly fa r to  
oppose a demand that redress be first gi­  
ven for the numerous irregularities w.iich  
preceded the aggression on the American  
frigate, as well as for this particular ag­  
gression, and that the effectual control be  
interposed against repetitions of them. And ’  
as no such redress has been given for tne i  
past, notwithstanding the lapse of time  
which has taken place, nor any suc:i sccu- !  
rity for the future, notwithstanding the un  
diminished reasonableness of it, it follows,  
that a cor.tinu .nee ot the proclamation  
would be consistent with an entire disc n­  
tinu.ince of one only of t. e occurrences  
from which it proceeded  
But it is not necessary tonvail the argil  
ment ol this view of tiie case, Rithoti&#x27;i of!  
itself entirely conclusive Had the tia­  
mation been founded on the single iv ^res­  
smn commut&#x27;d on the Cl • ; cakej°and  
weie it admitted that the isconlinuam e  
of that aggression met el., g:.ve a claim to  
the discontinuance of t t proclamation, the  
claim would lie defeated, by the incontes­  
table fact, that that aggression ins not been  
di&lt;cont.nued. It nasm ver etas d to exist •  
and is in existence at ibis nr» m nt. Need  
I rem nd you, sir, H u the seizure ami .■ -  
portation of the seamen belonging to the  
crew of the Chesapeake, entered into the  
very essence of that aggress.on ; that with  
an exception of the victim to o t. ial, for­  
hiddeu by the most solemn considerations,  
and greatly aggravating the guilt of ita au­  
thor, the seamen in question are st ll re­  
tained, and consequently that the aggres­  
sion, if in no other respect, is by that act  
alone continued and in force?  
If the views which have been taken of  
&#x27;.lie subject have the justness which they  
claim, they will have shewn that on no I  
ground whatever can an annulment ol the |  
proclamation of July 2d be reasonably re­  
quired, as a preliminary to the negociation  
wuh which you are charged. On the con­  
  
-v vivan; i«ums, irum a recurrence  
to the causes and object of the proclaran- 1  
tion, that, as was at first intimated, the  
strongest sanctions of Great Britain herself  
would support the demand, that previous  
to a discussion of the proclamation, due  
satisfaction should be made to the 11 States ;  
that (Ins satisfaction ought to extend to all  
the wrongs which preceded and produced  
tljat act; and that even limiting the mer­  
its of the question to the single relation of  
the proclamation to the wrong committed  
in the attack on the American frigate, and  
deciding the question on the principle that  
a d&#x27;scominuance of the latter, required of  
right a discontinuance of the former, no­  
thing appears that does not leave such a  
preliminary destitute of every foundation  
which could he assumed for it.  
With a right to draw this conclusion, the  
President might have instructed me to  
close this communication, with the reply  
stated in the beginning of it; and perhaps  
in taking this course, he would only have  
consu ted a sensibility, to which most go­  
vernments would, in sm?h a case have yield­  
ed. But adhering to the modera.ion by  
which he has been invariably guided, and j  
anxious to rescue the two nation* from the  
circumstances, under which an nhortivc &lt;  
issue to your mission necessarily places !  
them, he lias authorised tne, in tne event of |  
your disclosing the terms of reparation j  
which you believe will be satisfactory, and &lt;  
on its appearing that they are so, to consi- j  
dcr this evidence cf the justice of his liri- ‘  
  
Unto majesty a* a pledge ft r nn j*T

motion was meant to provide, am! to |m,.  
cced to concert with \«u a revocation  
that act bearing the same date with the  
act of reparation to which the U. States  
arc entitled.  
1 am not unaware, dr, that according to  
the view which you appear to have taken  
of your instructions, such a course of rro­  
cceding lias not Keen contemplated bv the u  
%*s possible, nevertheless that a&#x27; ,e-ex­  
aro nation, in a spirit, in which I am well  
persuaded it will be made, may discover to

a degree liberal and conciliatory f„ everv

tion of the pre­  
sident could become a subject of ronsiderusinn, sa­  
tisfaction should be made for the acknowledged ag­  
gression which preceded it. This is evidently  
agreeable to the order of reason, and, it may be add­  
ed, to the order of usage as maintained by Gieal  
Britain, whenever in analogous cases, she has been  
the complaining party.  
But as you have sul joined to the preliminary de­  
mand, certain explanations, with a view doubtless  
less to obviate such an answer, it will best accord  
with the candour of the president, to meet them  
with such a review of the whole subject as will pre­  
sent the solid grounds on which lie regards such ade­  
round as inadmissible.  
1 begin with the occurrences from which the pro­  
clamation ol July Ud resulted. These are in gene­  
ral terms referred to by the instrument itself. A  
more particular notice of the most important ot  
them, will here be in place.  
Passing over, then, the habitual hut minor irre­  
gularities ot bis Bntannick majesty’s ships of war,  
in making the hospitalities of our ports subservient  
to the annoyance of our trade, both outward and in­  
ward, a practice not only contrary to the principles  
of publirk law, but expressly contrary to British  
ordinances enforced dunug maritime wars to which  
she bore a neutral relation, I am constrained, unwel­  
come as tbe task is, to rail your attention to the  
following more prominent instances.  
In tbe summer ol the year 1804, the British fri  
gate the Cambrian, with other cruisers in company,  
entered the harbour ol N* w York. The command­  
er, Capt. Bradley, in violation of the port laws re­  
lating botii to health and revenue, caused a mere haul  
vessel just arrived, and confessedly within the limits  
, and under the authority of the United States, to he  
boarded by persons under his command, who alter  
resisting the otfirers of the port in the legal exer­  
| l&#x27;-se of their functions, actually impressed and carri­  
I ed oft a number ol seamen and passengers into the  
I service ol the ships or war. On an appeul to the  
j voluntary respect for the laws, he first failed to give  
up the oftcndei to justice, and finally repelled the  
officer charged with the regular process for tbe pur­  
pose.  
This procedure was not only a flagrant insult to  
! tbe sovereignty of tbe nation, but an infraction of  
its neutrality also, vvhirli did not permit a bellige­  
lent ship tkus to augment its force within the neu­  
tral territory.  
lo finish the scene, this commander went so far  
as to declare, in an official letter to the minister ple­  
nipotentiary ol his Britannic majesty, and by him  
communicated lo this government, that he consider­  
ed Ins ship, whilst lying in the harbor ot New-York,  
as having dominion around her, within the distance  
of her buoys.  
AH these circumstances were duly made known to  
the British government, in just expectation ot hoT  
norublc reparation. None has ever been ollered.—  
Capt. Bradley was advanced Irmn his frigate to the  
command ot a ship ot the line.  
At a subsequent period severat British frigates tin­  
der the command of capt. Whitby, of the Leander,  
pursuing the piactiee of vexing the inward and out­  
ward trade of our ports, and hovering for that pur*  
pose, about the entranre of that ol New-York, clos­  
ed a scries ol irregularities, w ith an attempt to arrest  
! a coasting vessel, on board of which an American  
i citizen was killed bv a cannon ball which entered  
the vessel whilst within less thaw a mile from the  
I shore.  
  
i lhe uiooa oi a citizen thus murdered, in a trade  
from one to another port of his own rnnnlrv, and  
within the sanctuary o» its territorial jurisdiction,  
could notfaii to amuse th- sensibility of the pul,lie,  
and to make a solemn appeal to the justice of the  
British government. Tliet-ase was presented moie­  
ovt r to that government hy this, in the accent which  
! it rcquned; and with due confidence that the offender  
would receive the examplary punishment which he  
deserved. That there might be no failure of legal  
proof of a fact sufficiently notorious of itself, unex­  
| ceptionable witnesses to establish it were sent to  
I Great Britain at the expense of the United States.  
Captain Whitby was notwithstanding honorably  
acquitted j no animadversion took place on any  
other officer belonging to the squadron ; nor has  
any apology or explanation been made since the tri­  
al was over, as a conciliatory offering to the disap­  
pointment of this country at such a result.  
A case of another character occurred in the month  
of September, 1806’. The Impetueux, a French  
ship of 74 guns, when aground within a few huudred  
yards of the shore of North Carolina, and theiefore  
visibly within the territorial jurisdiction and hospi  
table protection of the United States, was fired up­  
on, boarded and burnt, form three British ships of  
war, under the command of capt, Douglas, Ha­  
ving completed this outrage on the sovereignty and  
neutrality of the United Stales, the British com­  
mander felt no scruple m proceeding thence into  
the waters near Norfolk, nor in the midst of  
the hospitalities enjoyed by him, to add to wbat bad  
passed, a refusal to discharge from his ships, im­  
pressed citizens of the United States not to be such,  
on the plea that the government of the United  
States had refused to surrender to the demand of ad­  
miral Berkety, certain seamen alleged to be British  
deserters; a demand which it is well understood  
your government disclaims any right to make.  
It would be superfluous to dwell os the features  
  
- &#x27;• ;&quot;T &#x27;iiir.H  
which mark this agaravatetynsuli. Bot l must fc*  
permitted to remind you, that in so serious * Ugh*  
was a similar violation of neutral territory, by the  
destruction-of certain French ships on the coast of  
Portugal, by a British stjudron- undeR the cotnmantf  
of admiral Boscawan, regarded by the court of  
Great Britain, that a minister extrordinary was die*  
patched tor the express purpnse&#x27;bf expiating the ag­  
gressions on the sovereignty of a friendly power.  
Lastly presents itself, the attack bv the Urilisl»  
  
&#x27;hip ot. war Leopold, oil the American frigate Che­  
sapeake ; a rase too tamiliar in alt its ciccumstHn­  
res to need a recital of any part of them* Ft is eufli*  
rient to remark that the conclusive evidence wbicb  
this event added to that which had preceded, of tbq  
unrontrouled excesses of the British naval com*  
inandeis, in insulting our sovereignty, and abusing  
our hospitality, determined, the President to extend  
to all British armed shijis, the precaution heretofore  
applied to a few by name, of interdicting to ihenp  
the use and privileges of our harbours and waters. &quot;  
&#x27;1 tns was done by his proclamation of July  
180f, referring to the series of occurrences, endiog  
with the aggression on the frigate Chesapeake, as  
the considerations requiring it. And if the appre­  
hensions (rom the licentions spirit of the British  
naval commanders, thus developed and uncontroyl*  
ed, which h&#x27;d to this measure of precaution, could  
need other justification than was afforded by what  
had passed, it would lie amply found in the subset  
quent (‘onduct ol the ships under the command of  
the same captain Douglas,  
This officer, neither admonished by reflecting oq  
the crisis produced by the attack on the Chesapeake,  
nor conlrouien by respect for the law of nations, Qf  
the laws ot the land, did not rease within our w*t  
ters to t&gt;rin£ to, by firing at vessels pursuing theif  
regular comse ot trade; and ii&gt; the same spirit  
winch had displayed itsell in the recent outrage com*  
imtted on the American trigate, he not only in*  
dulged himsell in hostile threats, and indications of a,  
hostile approach to Norfolk, but actually o&#x27;ostructeq  
our citizens in the ordinary communication between  
that and neighboring places, Hv* proceedings  
constituted in fact, a blockade of the port, and  
real an invasion of the country, according to the ex*  
tent of his force, as if troops had been debarked,  
and the town besieged on the land side.  
Was it possible tor the chief magistrate of n t»a­  
tion, who felt lor its rights and its honour, to do  
less than interpose some measure of precaution at  
least against the repetition of enormities whiefp  
; hud been so long unvontrouled, by the government  
j whose officers had committed them, and which bad!  
I at last taken the exorbitant shape of hostility and  
of insult seen in the attack on the Chesapeake £  
Candour will pinnounre that less could not be dene j  
and it will as reasonably admit that the proeluma- %  
lion comprising that measure, could not havp i  
j breathed u more temperate spirit, nor spoken in q  
mure oecoming tone. How lar it has received fr.itq  
those whose instructions it prohibited, the respect  
due to the national authority, or been made the oc­  
casion of new indignities, needs no explanation. &#x27;

sou of making salt, having been forcibly removed  
with their vessels and eltects by a French detach*  
ment from the island of Si. Domingo, to which.  
Turks fsiand was alleged to bean appurtenance, th*  
British ambassador at Paris, in pursuance of in­  
structions troni his government, demanded, as •  
satisfaction for the violence committed, (hat the  
proceedings should be disavowed, the intention of ac­  
quiring Turks Island disclaimed, orders given for  
the immediate abandonment of it on the part of tb*  
French, every thing restored to the condition ija.  
which it was at the time of the aggression, and re­

sutijects should be found to have sustained, accord­

vernors of St. Domiogo and Jamaica. A compli­  
ance with the whole of this demand was the reself.  
Again : In the year 1789, certain English mer­  
chants having opened a trade at Nonika Sound, net  
thf North-West roast of America, and attempted •  
settlement at that place, the Spaniards who bad  
long claimed that part of the world as tbeir exclu­  
sive propei ty, dispatched a frigate from Mexico*  
which captured two English vessels engaged in the  
trade, and broke up the settlement on the coast.—  
The Spanish government was the 6rst to complain*  
in this case, of the intrusions committed by the Bri­  
tish merchants. The Biitish government, however,  
demanded that the vessels taken by the Spanish fri— .  
gate should be restored and adequate satisfaction  
granted, precious to any other discussion.  
This demand prevailed; the Spanish government  
agreeing to make foil restitution of the captured  
vessels, and to indemnify the parties interested is

; v Ihu betiding* and tracts of land of which the British  
subject* had been dispossessed. The British, how­  
over, soon gave a proof of tbe little value they set ou  
the possession, by a voluntary direlection under  
wbirh it has since remained.’  
The rase which will be noted last, though of a  
date prior to the rase of Nootka Sound, is that of  
Falkland&#x27;s Islands. These islands lie about one hun­  
dred leagues eastward of the straits of Magellan.—  
The title of them had been a subject of controversy  
among several of the maritime nations of Europe.  
From the position of the islands and other circum­  
stances, the pretensions of Spain bore an advantage­  
ous ^Comparison with those ot her competitors. In  
the year 1770, the British took possesion of Port  
Egmont in one of the islands, the Spaniards being  
at the time in possession of another part, and pro­  
ving against a settlement by the British. The  
protest being without effect, ships and troops were  
tent from Buenos Ayres by the governor of that  
place, which forcibly dispossessed and drove off the  
British settlers.  
_ The British government looked entirely to the  
dispossession by force, demanded as a specifick con­  
dition of preserving harmony brtween the two  
Courts, not only the disavowal of the Spanish pro­  
ceedings, but that the affairs of the settlement  
should be immediately restored to the precise state  
in which they were previous to the act of dispos­  
session. The Spanish government made some diffi  
Culties ; requiring particularly a disavowal, on the  
Jart of Great Britain, of the conduct of her officer  
t Falkland’s islands, which it was alleged, gave oc­  
casion to SteDS taken bv the Snanigh om&gt;ern..r . ..„,l  
  
proposed an adjustment by mutual stipulations in  
the Ordinary form.  
_ The reply was, that the moderation of his Britan­  
niek majesty having limitted liis demand to the  
smallest reparation he could accept for the injury  
done, nothing w-ts left for discussion but the mode  
Of carrying the disavowal and restitution into exe­  
cution ; reparation losing its value if it be conditi m­  
al, and to be obtained by any stipulation whatever  
from the party injured.  
The Spanish government yielded. The violent  
proceedings of its officers were disavowed. The fort,  
the port, and every thing else were agreed to fie im­  
mediately restored to the precise situation which had  
been disturbed ; and duplicates of orders issued lor  
the purpose to the Spanish officers, were delivered  
into the hands of one of the British principal secre­  
taries of state. Mere again it is to be rcm.irked,  
thm satisfaction having been made for the forcible  
dispossession, the islands hut their importance in  
the eyes of the Biitish government, were in a short  
time finally evacuated, and Port Egmont remains  
With every other part of them in the hands of Spain.  
Could stronger pledges have been given, than are  
here found, that an honourable and instant repara­  
tion would be made in a case, differing no otherwise  
from those recited, than as it furnished to the same  
monarch of a great nation, an opportunity to prove  
that adhering always to the same immutable princi­  
ple, he was as ready to do right to others, as to re­  
quire it for himself.  
Returning to the instructions given to the minis­  
ter plenipotentiary of the United States at London,  
I am to observe that the {’resident thought it just  
and expedient to insert, as a necessary ingredient in  
the adjustment nf the outrage committed on the A­  
merican frigate, a security against the future prac­  
tice of British naval commanders, impressing from  
merchant vessels of the United States on the high  
teas, such of their crews as they might undertake to  
denominate British subjects.  
To this association of the two subjects, the presi­  
, dent was determined, 1st, by his regarding both as  
resting on kindred principles, the immunity of pri­  
vate ships, with the know^jk&amp;ceptions made by the  
law of nations, being as well&#x27;dstablished as that of  
publick ships; and there being no pretext for in­  
cluding in these exceptions the impressim nt (if it  
could be freed from its enormous and notorious a­  
l&gt;uses) of the subjects of a belligerent, by the offi­  
cers of that belligerent. The rights of a belligerent  
against the ships of a neutral nation, accrue merely  
from the relation of the neutral to the other belli­  
  
hv,u,vB° ••• * vu%cjiu£ in umi coniruoana oi war, or  
in supplying n blockaded port.  
The claim of a belligerent to search for and seize  
on board neutral vessels on the high sea&#x27;s, persons  
■under his allegiance, does not therefore rest on any  
belligerent right under the law of nations, but on a  
prerogative derived from municipal law ; and in­  
volves tbe extravagant supposition, that one nation  
basa right to execute at all tunes and in all rases,  
its municipal laws and regulations, on board the  
ships of another nation, not being withiu its terri­  
torial limits.  
The president was led to the same determination,  
2dly, by his desire of converting a particular inci­  
dent, into an Occasion for removing another and  
more extensive source of danger to the harmony of  
the two countries : and 3dly, by his persuasion that  
the liberality of the propositions authorized with  
this view, would not fail to induce the ready con­  
currence of his Britannirk majesty ; and that the  
more extensive source of irritation and perplexity  
being removed, a satisfactory adjustment of the  
particular incident would be the less difficult. The  
president still thinks that such would huve been the  
tendency of the mode for which lie had provided ;  
Md he cannot therefore hut regret that the door was  
shut against the experiment, by the peremptoiy re­  
fusal of Mr. Canning to admit it into discussion,  
even in the most informal manner, as was suizuest­  
- ed by Mr. Monroe.  
Ths president felt the greater regret, as the step  
he had taken towards a more enlarged and lasting  
accommodation became -thus a bar to the adjust­  
ment of the particular and recent aggression which  
had been committed against the United States.—  
„ He found however an alleviation, in the signified  
purpose ot his Britannick majesty, to charge with  
this adjustment a special mission to ibe United  
States, which, restricted us it was, seemed to indi­  
cate a disposition fiom which a liberal and concili­  
atory arrangement of one great object at least might  
be confidently expected.  
&#x27; In this confidence, your arrival was awaited with  
every friendly solicitude; and our first interview  
having opened the way, by an acquiescence in the  
. separation nf the two cases insisted on by his Bri  
tannick majesty, notwithstanding the strung ground  
on which they had been united by the pnsident, it  
■was not to be doubted that a tender of the satisfac­  
tion claimed by tbeUniled .States, for a distinguish­  
ed and an acknowledged insults, by one of bis offi­  
ces*, would immediately follow.  
* it was «vt, tkeaplore, without a very painful nr*&#x27;  
: • ■ *r*&#x27;v&#x27; • - V.- ..  
  
prize, that the errour of this expectation vat die*!  
•overed. Instead of the satisfaction due from th  
original aggression, it was announced that the lira  
=tep towards an adjustment must proceed from th:  
party injured ; and your letter now before me, foi  
itidlly repeats, that as long as tiie proclamation m  
the president, which issued on the 2d July, 180?,  
shall be in lorre, it will be an insuperable obstai l  
m a negot iation, even on the subject of the aggros  
sion which preceded i. ; in other words, that th’  
proclamation must he pul out of mice, before an ad­  
justment of the aggression ran be taken into discus­  
ftinn.  
In explaining the grounds of this extraordinary  
demand, it is alledged to lie supported by the consi­  
deiation that tiie proceeding and pretension of the  
oneuding officer lias been disavowed: that the ge­  
neial assurances aie given ol a disposition and in­  
leolion in ins Britaumrk majesty to make satisfac­  
tion : that a special minister was dispatched with  
promptitude tm the purpose of carrying into effect  
tins disposition ; and that you have a personal con­  
viction that the particular terms, which you are  
not at liberty previously to disclose, will be deem­  
ed by the United Slates satisfactory.  
Uuh respect to the disavowal, it would be unjust  
not to regard it as a proof of candour and amity to­  
wards the United Stales, ami as some presage ol  
t le voluntary reparation which it implied to be due.  
But the disavowal can be the less confounded with  
the reparation itseli; since it was sufficiently re­  
quired by the respect which Great-Britain owed to  
her own honour; it being impossible that au en­  
lightened government, had hostility been meditated,  
would have commenced it in such a manner, and  
in the midst m existing proiessions of peace and  
friendship. She owed it also to consistency with a  
disavowal on a former Occasion, in which the pre­  
ension had been enforced by a British squadron,  
against the sloop ot war Baltimoie, belonging to  
the Unibd Slates ; and finally to tbe interest which  
C&lt;re&lt;tt-Briuin has, more than any other nation, in  
disclaiming a principle which would exnose her so­  
  
p rmur number of ships of war, to so many rndig­  
nitit-s Irom inleriour navies.  
As little ran the general assurances that repara­  
tion would be made, claim a return which could pro­  
perly follow the actual reparation only. They can­  
not amount to more than a disposition, or at most  
•a promise, to do what the aggressor may deem a  
fulfilment of his obligation. They do not prove  
e\en a disposition to do what may be satisfactory  
to the injured party, who cannot have less than an  
equ il right to decide on the sufficiency of the re­  
diess.  
In dispatching a special minister for the purpose  
of adjusting the difference, the United States ought  
cbeerlully to acknowledge all the proof it allords on  
the part of his Britanmrk majesty, of his pantick  
views towards them, and ol his prospect for their  
friendship. But whilst they could not under any  
circumstances, allow the measure more than a cer­  
tain participation in an honourable reparation it is  
to be recollected that the avowed and primary object  
of the mission was to substitute for the more ex­  
tended adjustment proposed by the United States,  
at London, a separation of the subject, as preferred  
by his Britanmrk majesty, and you well know, sir,  
how fully this object was accomplished.  
With respect to the personal conviction which  
you have expressed, that the terms which you de­  
cline to disclose, would be satisfactory to the Unit­  
ed States it is incumbent on me to observe, that  
w ill ti e highest respect for your judgement, and  
the most perfect confidence in your sincerity, an in­  
superable objection manifestly lies, to the accep­  
tance ol a personal and unexplained opinion, in  
place o: a disclosure, which would enable this go­  
vernment to exercise its own judgement, in a case  
alfecting so essentially its honour and its rights.—  
Such a course ot proceeding would be without ex­  
ample ; and there can he no hazard in saying that  
one will never be afforded by a government which  
respects itself as much as yours justly does ; and  
therefore can never be reasonably expected from  
one which respects itself as much as this has a  
light to do.  
  
1 lorbear, »ir, to enlarge on the intrinsick incon­  
gruity of the expedient proposed. But I must he  
allowed to remark, as an additional admonition of  
the singular and mortifying perplexity in which a  
compliance might involve the president, that there  
are.in the letter of Mr. Canning, communicating to  
Mr. Monroe the special mission to the United Stales  
pregnant indications that other questions and condi­  
tions may have been contemplated, which would be  
found utterly irreconcilable with the sentiments of  
this nation.  
it neither any nor all these considerations can  
sustaiu the preliminary demand made in your com­  
munication, it remains to be seen whether such a  
demand rests with greater advantage on the more  
precise ground on which you finally seem to place  
it.  
, The proclamation is considered as a hostile mea­  
sure, and a discontinuance of it, as due to the dis­  
continuance of the aggression which led to it.  
It lias been sufficiently shewn that the proclama­  
tion, as appears on the face of it, was produced by  
a train of ocruirences terminating in the attack on  
the American frigate, and not by this last alone._  
To a demand, therefore, that the proclamation be  
revoked, it would he perfectly fair to oppose a de­  
mand that redress be first given for the numerous  
irregularities which preceded the aggression on the  
American frigate, as well as for this particular ag­  
gression, and that effectual rontroul be interposed  
against repetitions of them. And us no such re-1  
dress has been given for the past, notwithstanding  
the lapse of time which has taken place, nor any  
such security for the future, notwithstanding the  
undiminished leasonablencss of it, it follows, that  
a continuance of the proclamation would be con­  
sistent with an entire discontinuance of one only of  
the occurrences from which it proceeded.  
Hut it is not necessary to avail the argument of  
this view of the case, although of itself entirely  
conclusive. Had the proclamation been founded  
on the single aggression committed on the Chesa­  
peake, and were it admitted that the discontinuance  
of that aggression merely, gave a claim to the dis­  
continuance of the proclamation, the claim would  
be defeated, by the incontestable fact, that that ag­  
gression has not been discontinued. It has never  
ceased to exist; aad is in existence at this moment.  
Meed I remind you, sir, that the seizure and aspor­  
tation of the teamen belonging to the crew of the  
Chesapeake entered into the very essence of that  
iggression ; that with an exception of the victim  
to a trial, lorbidderr by the most solemn considera­  
  
tjon*, and greatly aggravating the guilt of its an­  
tnor, the teamei* in question are still retained, and  
• onsequently that the aggression, if in no other re­  
pect, is by that act alone continued and-in force ?  
It the views which have been taken of* the sub­  
ject have the justness which they claim, they will  
ba*e shewn that on no ground whatever can an an­  
mlmeiit ot the proclamation of July 2d, be reason­  
ably required, us a preliminary to the negotiation  
&#x27; uh w,*ich you are charged. On the contrary, it  
clearly results, from a recurrence to the causes and  
obj*-t of the proclamation, that, as was at first  
intimated, the strongest sanctions of Great Britain  
hersell, would support the demand, that previous to  
a discussion of the proclamation, due satisfaction  
should be made to the United States ; that this sa­  
tisfaction ought to extend to all the wrongs which  
preceded and produced that act; and that even li­  
miting the merits of the question to the single rela­  
tion of the proclamation to the wrong committed  
in the attack on the American frigate, and deciding  
the question on the principle that a discontinuance  
of the latter required of right a discontinuance of  
the former, nothing appears that does not leave  
such a preliminary destitute of every foundation  
which could be assumed for it.  
With a right to draw this conclusion, the presi­  
dent might have instructed me to close this commu­  
nication, with the reply staled in the beginning of  
it; and perhaps in taking this course, he would on­  
ly have consulted a sensibility, to which most go­  
vernments would, in such a case, have yielded. But  
adhering to the moderation by which he has been  
invariably guided, and anxious to rescue the two  
nations from the circumstances, under which an a­  
hortive issue to your mission necessarily places  
them, he has authorised me, in the event of your  
disclosing the terms of reparation which you be­  
lieve will be satisfactory, and on its appearing that  
they are so, to consider this evidence of the justice  
of his Britanniek majesty as a pledge for an effec­  
tual interposition with rspect to all the abuses  
against a recurrence of which the proclama­  
  
non was meant to provide, and to proceed to con­  
cert with you, a revocation of that act, bearing  
ihe tame date with the act of reparation to which  
the United States are entitled.  
I am not unaware, sir, that according to the  
view which you appear to have taken of your in­  
structions, such a course of proceeding has not been  
contemplated by them. It is possible, neverthe­  
less, that a re-examination, in the spirit in which  
I am well persuaded it will be made, may discover  
them to be not inflexible to a proposition, in so  
high a degree, liberal and conciliatory. In every  
event the president w ill have manifested his wil­  
lingness to meet your government on a ground of  
accommodation, which spares to its feelings, how­  
ever misapplied he rnay deem them, every conces­  
sion not essentially due to those which must be e­  
ijually respected ; and consequently will have de­  
monstrated that the very ineligible posture given to  
so important a subject in the relations of the two  
countries, by the unsuccessful termination of your  
mission, can be referred to no other sourre, than the  
rigorous restrictions under which it was to be exe­  
cuted.  
I make no apology, sir, for the long interval be­  
tween the date ofyour letter and that undor which  
l write. It is rendered unnecessary by your know­  
ledge of the circumstances to which the delay is to  
to be asriibed.  
With high consideration and respect,  
I have the honour to he, Sir,  
Your most obedient servant,

1 his demand. &gt;ir, mignt justly sug­  
gest the simple answer, that oefore tire  
proclamation ol iiie pi t sidetit could be­  
come a subject ot consideration, satis­  
faction saouid ti^macle loi the acknow­  
ledged agression wiiieu preceded it.  
1 his is evidently agreeable to the order  
of lime, to the order of reason, and it  
nisv be added, to the order of usage as  
maintained by Qrt: at* Britain whenever  
in analogous cart s, she has been the  
complaining party. ♦  
But as you have subjoined to the  
preliminary demand certain explana­  
tions, with a view douh: less to obviate  
sueh an answer, ir will best accord with  
the candor of the presiuent, to meet,  
them with such a review of the whole  
subject as will present the solid grounds  
on which he regards such a demand as  
inadmissbie.  
  
I *&gt;egin with the occurence from  
witch the proclamation of July 2d re­  
sulted. I he he ai c in general terms  
referred to by the instrument itself. A  
more patticular notice of the most im­  
portant of tnein, will here be in place.  
Passing over, then, the habitual, but  
minor irregularities of his Britannic  
Majesty&#x27;s shipsol war, in making the !  
hospitalities of our ports subservient to \
the annoyance of oi|i&#x27; trade, both out­  
ward and in waul, a practice not only  
contrary to the principles of public  
law. but expressly contrary to British  
ordinances enforced during maritime  
wars to which she bore a neutral rela­  
tion, I am constrained, unweh omc as  
the task is, to call your attention to the  
following more prominent instances.  
.i» the summer ot the year 1804, the  
British l&#x27; ig*tff tue Cumbrian, with other  
ciuizers in company, entered the bar  
bor of AHy-Wx-. The cammandcr,  
captain Bradley^ in violation ol the port  
Bws relating IhuIi to health anti reven­  
ue, caused a merchant vessel just arri­  
ved, and confessedly within the limits  
md under the authority of the United  
States, to be boaided by persons under  
his command, who after resisting tin  
officers ot the port in the legal exercise  
ot their functions actually impressed  
and carried ntimlrerol seamen and  
passengers into the set * ice of the ships  
jf war—On an appeal to his voluntary  
respect for the* laws, he hrst failed to  
  
give up the offender to justice, and fi­  
nally repelled the officer charged with  
ie regular process for the purpose.  
1 his procedure was not only a fla­  
grant insult to the sovereignty of the h i­  
lion, but an infraction of its neutrality  
Iso, which did not permit a belligerent  
ship thus to augment its force within  
tlie neutral territory.  
To finish the scene, this commander  
went so far as to declare, in an official  
letter to the minister plenipotentiary of  
his Britannick Majesty, and by him  
communicated to this government, that  
he considered his&gt; ship, whilst lying in  
the harbor of Arw-Vbrjt, as having do­  
minion around her, within the distance  
of her buoys.  
All these circumstances wtre duly  
nude known to the British government  
in just expectation of honorable repara­  
tion. None lias ever been offered.  
Capt. Bradley wui advanced from his  
frigate to the command of a ship of the  
line.  
At a subsequent period several Brit­  
ish frigates under ihe command of capt.  
IVhi&#x27;, by of the Lrander, pursuing the  
practice of vexing the inward and out­  
ward trade of our j»orts, and hovering  
for that purpose about the entrance of  
that of Sievj- York, closed a series of ir­  
re; ulaiides, with an attempt to arrest  
a coasting .vessel, on l&gt;o\rd of which an  
American citizen was killed by a can­  
non ball which entered the vessel whilst  
within less than a mile f om the shore.  
The blood of a ciiiz&gt; n thus murder­  
ed, in a trade from one to another port  
of his own country,ind within the sanc­  
tuary, of its teriitoii-4 jurisdic’ion,  
could not fail to arouse the sensibi ity  
of the public, and io m»^e a solemn ap­  
peal to the justice of the Bitish gov­  
ernment. 1 he case was presented  
moreover to that government by this,  
in the accent which it required; and  
with due confidence that the offender  
would receive tlie exemplary punish­  
ment which he deserved 1 hat tnete  
might he no failure of legal pi oof of a  
fact suflicitntly notorious of itself, un­  
exceptionable witnesses to establish it  
were sent to (*rrai-kri(ain at the ex­

A C A^E of another character occur­  
red in the month of September, 1805.  
The Im/ietueux, a French ship of 7A  
guns, whan aground within a few  
hundred yards of the shore of Morth  
Carolina, and therefore visibly within  
the territorial jurisdiction and hospita­  
ble protection of the United States was  
fired upon bearded and burnt, from  
three British ships of war, under the  
command of Capt. Douglas. Having  
completed this outrage on the sove­  
reignty and neutrality of the United  
States, the British commander felt no  
scruple in proceeding thence into the  
waters near Xorfolk nor in the midst  
of the hospitable rites enjoyed by him,  
to add to what had passed a refusal to  
discharge from his ships impressed  
citizens of the United States not denied  
to be such, on the plea that the govern­  
ment of the United Slates had refused  
surrender to the demand of Admiral  
Berkeley, certain seamen alledgtd to be  
British deserters ; a demand which it  
is well understood your government  
disclaims any right to make.  
It would be superfluous to dwell on the  
features which murk, this aggravated  
insult. But I must be permitted to  
remind you that in so serious a light  
was a similar violation of neutral terri­  
tory. bv the destruction of certain  
French ships on the coast of Portugal^  
by a British squadron under the com­  
mand of Admiral Boscan&#x27;an, regarded  
by the court of Great-fir:tain that a  
minister extraordinary was dispatched  
for the express purpose of expiating  
the aggression on the sovereignty of a  
friendly now r.  
  
Lastly presents itself, the attack by  
the British ship Leopard^ on the Amer­  
ican frigate Chrnuprake; a case too  
familiar in all its circumstances to need  
a rucital of any part ,®f them. It is  
sufficient to remark that the conclusive  
evidence wliiah this event added to that  
which had precedwd, of the uncontroul­  
ed excesses of the British naval com­  
mander, in insulting our sovereignty,  
and abusing our hospitality, determined  
the President to extend to all British  
armed ships, the precaution heretofore  
applied to a few by name, of interdict­  
ing to them the use and priveleges of  
our harbors and waters.  
This was done by his proclamation  
of July 2, 1807, referring to the series  
ofoccurrences ending with the aggres­  
sion on the frigate Chesapeake, as the  
considerations requiring it. And if the  
apprehensions from the licentious spirit  
of the British naval commanders, thus  
developed and uncoutrouled, which led  
to litis measure of precaution, could  
need other justification than w as afford­  
ed by what had passed, it would be am­  
ply found in the subsequent conduct  
of the ships under the command of the  
same captain DoJglumt.  
The officer neither admonished by  
reflection on t the crisis produced by  
the attack on the Chesapeake, nor con­  
trouied by respect for the law of nations,  
air the laws of the land, did not cease  
within our waters to bring to, bv firing  
at vessels pursuing their regular course  
oi trade ; and in the same spirit which  
had displayed itself in the recent out­  
rage committed on the American fri­  
gate, he not only indulged himself in  
hostile threats, end indications of a  
hosti.e approach to Aor/b/J‘, but actu­  
ally obstructed our citizens in the orili- i  
nary communication between that and !  
neighbouring places. I Its proceedings |  
constituted in fact, a blockade of the !  
port, and as real an invasion of the  
country, according to the extent of his  
otce as ii troops had been debarked,  
and the town besieged on the land  
side.  
t  
  
f  
** XVas it possible for the chief magi*- j  
trate of a nation, who felt for its rights  
and honor, to do less than interpose  
some measure of precaution at least a­  
gainst the repetition of enormities  
which had been so long uncontrouled,  
by the government whose officers had  
committed them, and which had at last  
taken the exorbitant shape ot hostility  
and of insult seen in the attack on the  
frigate Chesapeake ? Candour will  
pronounce that less could not be done ;  
and it will as reasonably admit that  
the proclamation comprising that mea­  
sure, could not have breathed a more  
temperate spirit, nor spoken in a more ?  
becoming tone. II0W far it has receiv­  
ed from those whose intrusions it pro-,  
hibited, thr respect due to the national,  
authority, or been made the occasion  
of new indignities, needs no explanation.

h had been committed on  
their sovereignty and their flag, and to&#x27;  
require the satisfaction due for it ; in­  
dulging the expectation, that his Bri­  
tannic majesty would at once perceive  
it to be the truest magnanimity, as well  
as the strictest justice, to offer that  
prompt and full expiation of an ac­  
knowledged wrong, which would re-es­  
tablish and improve both in tact and  
in feeling, the state of things which it,  
had violated.  
This expectation was considered as  
not only honourable to the sentiments  
of his majesty, but was supported by (  
known examples, in which, being the  
complaining party, he had required and 1  
obtained, as a preliminary to any coun­  
ter complaints whatever, a precise re-;  
placement of things, in every practica­  
ble circumstance, in their pre-existing  
situation.  
  
l nus in the year 1764, Bermudians ,  
and other Britif subjects, who had}  
according- to annual custom, taken pos­  
session of 7ur Pa-Island for the season  
of making salt, having been forcibly  
removed with their vessels and effects  
by a French detachment from the island  
of St. Domingo, to which Turks-Inland  
was aliedged to be an appurtenance,  
the British ambassador at Paris, in 1  
pursuance of instructions from his}  
government, demanded, as a satisfac-j  
tion for the violence committed, that!  
the proceedings should be disavowed,  
the intention of acquiring Turks-Island  
disclaimed, orders £iven for the imme­  
diate abandonment of it on the part of  
the French, evety thing restored to the  
condition in which it w&#x27;as at the time  
of the aggression, and reparation made  
of the damages which any British sub­  
jects should be found to have sustained,  
according to an estimation to be settled t  
between the governors of St. Domingo j  
and Jamaica. A compliance with the  
whole of this demand was the result.  
Afpiit ; In the year 1789, certain;  
English merchants having opened a  
trade at JVoatka Sound, on the North­  
West coast of America, and attempted  
a settlement at that place, the Span* j  
iards who hat! long claimed that part  
of the world as their exclusive property,  
dispatched a frigate from Mexico,  
  
winch captured two English vessels  
engaged in the trade, and broke up the&#x27;  
settb ment on the coast. The Spanish 1  
government was the first to complain,  
in this case,of tke intrusions committed  
by the British merchants. The British  
government, however, demanded that  
the vessels takaii by the Spanish frigate  
should be restored, and adequate satis­  
faction granted previous to any uthcr  
discussion.  
This demand prevailed ; the Spanish  
government agreeing to make full  
restitution of the captured vessels, and &gt;  
to indemnify the parties interested in j  
them for the losses sustained. They i  
restored also the buildings and tracts  
of land of which the British subjects!  
had been dispossessed. The British,!  
however, soon gave a proof of the little j  
value they set on the possession, by &#x27;  
a voluntary dereliction under which it  
has since remained.  
The case which will be noted last,  
though of a date prior ta the case of  
JVbotka Sound, is that of Falkland&#x27;s Isl­  
ands. These islands lie about one  
hundred leagues eastward of the straits  
of Magellan. The title to them had  
been a subject of controversy among  
several of the maritime nations of Eu­  
rope. From the position of the islands  
and other circumstances, the preten­  
sions of S/iain bore an advantageous  
comparison with those of her compet­  
itors. In the year 17T0, the British  
took possession of Fort Kgmont in one  
ol the islands, the Spaniards being at  
the time in possession of another part,  
a»d protesting against a settlement by  
the British. The protest being with­  
out effect, skips and troops were sent  
from Buenos-Ayr as by the governor  
of that place, which forcibly disposses­  
sed and drove off ihe British settlers.  
The British government looked en­  
tirely to the dispossession by force,  
demanded as a specific condition of  
preserving harmony betweyi the two  
  
courts, not only the disavowal of the  
Spanish proceedings, but that the affairs  
of that settlement should be immediate&#x27;  
ly restored to the precise state in which  
they were previous to the ict ol dis­  
possession. The Spanish government  
made some difficulties ; requiring par­  
ticularly a disavowal, on the part of  
Great Britain, of the conduct of her  
officer at FalklandInland*, which, it  
was alleilged, gave occasion to the steps  
taken by the Spanish governor ; and  
proposing an adjustment by mutual  
stipulation in the ordinary forms.  
The reply was that the moderation  
of his Britannick majesty having limit­  
ed his demand to the smallest reparation  
he could accept for the injury done,  
nothing was left for discussion but the  
mode of carrying the disavowal and  
restitution into execution ; reparation ,  
losing its value if it be conditional and  
to be obtained by any stipulation what­  
ever from the party injured.  
The Spanish government yielded.  
The violent proceedings of its officers  
were disavowed. The fort, the port,  
and every thing else were agreed to be  
immediately restored to the precise sit­  
uation wiiich had been disturbed ; and j  
duplicates of orders issued for the pur- .  
pose to the Spanish officers, were deliv- j  
ered into the hands of one of the British &#x27;  
principal secretaries of state. Here  
again it is to be remarked, that satisfac­  
tion having been made lbr the forcible j  
dispossession the islands lost their im- I  
portance in the eyes of the Britsih  
government, were in a short time eva­  
cuated and part Fg.nont remains with  
every other part of them in the hands  
of Spain.  
  
Could stronger pledges have been  
given than are here found, that an hon­  
ourable and instant reparation would be  
made in a case, differing no otherwise  
from those recited than as it furnished  
to the same monarch of a great nation,  
an opportunity to prove, that adhering  
always to the same immutable princi­  
ple, he was as ready to do right to oth­  
ers, as to require it for himself i  
Returning to the instructions given  
to the minister plenipotentiary of the  
United States at London, 1 am to ob­  
serve that the President thought it just  
and expedient to insert as a necessary  
ingredient in the adjustment of the  
outrage committed on the American  
frigate a security against thefuture prac­  
tice of the British naval commanders, in  
impresting from merchant vessels of  
the United States on the high seas-, such  
of their crews as they might undertake to  
denominate British subjects.  
To the association of the two sub­  
jects, the President was determined,  
1st by his regarding both as resting on  
kindred principles ; the immunity of  
private ships, with the known excep­  
tions made by the laws of nations, being  
as well established as that of public  
ships ; and there being no pretext for  
including in these exceptions the im­  
pressment (if it could be freed from its  
enormous and notorious abuses^ of th»  
subjects of a belligerent. The rights  
of a belligerent against the ships of a  
neutral nation, accrue merely from the  
relation of the neutral to the other bel­  
ligerent as in conveying to him contra­  
band of war, or in supplying a blocka^  
ded port.  
  
The clairr ot a belligerent to search  
for, and seize on board neutral vessels  
on the high seas, persons under his  
allegiance does not therefore rest on  
any belligerent right under the law of  
nations, but on a prerogative derived  
from municipal law ; and involves the  
extravagant supposition, that one na­  
tion has a right to execute at all times  
and in all cases, its municipal laws and  
regulations, on board the ships of an­  
other nation not being within its territo­  
lial limits.  
The President was led to the same  
determination, 2dly, by his desire «1  
converting a particular incident into an  
occasion for removing another and  
more extensive source of danger to the  
harmony of the two countries;* and  
3dly, by his persuasion, that the liber­  
ality of the propositions authorized with  
this view, would not fail to induce the  
ready concurrence of his Britannic  
Majesty; and the more extensive  
source ofirritation and perplexity being I  
removed, a satisfactory adjustment of  
the particular incident would be the &#x27;  
less difficult. The President still thinks i  
that such would have been the tendency  
of the mode for which he had provi­  
ded ; and lie cannot, therefore Wijpff. !  
gret, that the door was shut against the j  
experiment by the peremptory refusal  
of Mr. Canning to admit it into discus­  
sion even in the most informal manner  
as was suggested by M.. Munroe.  
The President felt the greater i egret, as  
the step he had taken towards a more en­  
larged and lasting accommodation became  
thus a bar to the adjustment of the particu­  
lar and recent aggression which had been  
committed against the United Slates. Hc  
i found, however, an alleviation in the signi­  
fied purpose of his Britanic Majesty* to  
| charge with this adjustment a special mis.  
| »ion to the United States, which restricted  
| as it was, seemed to indicate a di .p,,si­  
1 tion from which a liberal and conciliatory  
arrangement of one great object at least  
j might be confidently expected. *

I  
utmeting Document.  
Mr. Mvmsox’s 1.titer to Mr. Rose, on  
the subject of the Chesaficuke, &amp;c.  
(concluded )  
IN this confidence, your arrival was  
* waited with every friendly solicitude ;  
fttx* our first interview having opened  
the way by an acquiescence in the  
separation of the two cases insisted  
on by his Britannic Majesty, notwith­  
atetiding the strong grounds on which 1  
they hwi been united by the President,  
it was not to be doubted that a tender |  
ot&#x27;vhe satisfaction-claimed by the United  
Strtes for a distinguished and an ac­  
knowledged insult by one of his offi­  
ce* s- would immediately follow  
It wasTtot, therefore, without a very  
gainful surprise that the error of this  
expectation was discovered. Instead  
of the satisfaction due from the origin­  
al aggrtssot\it wa* announced that the  
step towards the adjustment must  
\ occeed from the party injured ; and {  
year letter now before me, U anally re- •  
peats that as long as the proclaim*;ion j  
of the President which issued on the 2d :  
July, 1807, shall be in force, it wiM b. *  
aii insuperable obstacle to : icgou.. ion  
even on the subject of the aggression  
w Inch preceded it; in other words, that  
the proclamation must be put out of  
force before an adjustment of the ag­  
gression can be taken into discussion.  
In explaining the grounds of this ex­  
traordinary demand, it is allcdged to be  
supported by the consideration that the  
proceeding and pretention of the offend­  
ing officer, has been disavowed ; that  
general assurances are given of a dis­  
position and intention in his Britannic  
majesty, to make satisfaction ; that a  
special minister was dispatched with  
promptitude, for the purpose of carry­  
ing into effect this disposition : and  
that you have a i»ersonal comiction  
that the particular terms, which you  
&gt;are not at liberty previously to disclose,  
sullbe deemed by the United Mates  
satisfactory.  
  
&gt;v iui respect to urc u  
would be unjust not to regard it as a  
proof of candor and amity towards the  
United S&#x27;ctH*, and a* some* presage of  
the voluntary reparation which it im­  
plied to be due But the disavowal  
can “be the less confounded with the  
reparation itself ; since it wra» suffi­  
ciently required by the respect which  
Greal-Briudn owed to her own honor ;  
it being impossible that nm enlightened  
government, had hostility been medi­  
tated, would have commenced it in  
*urh a manner, and in the mid»t of  
existing professions ol peace and  
friendship. She owed it also to con­  
sistency with the disavowal on a former  
occasion in which the pretension had  
been enforced by a British squadron  
sc-ainst tlve sloop of w*r Baltimore,  
\ longing to the United States, ai d  
finally to the interest which Greuf-Un­  
tain has more than am other nation, in  
disclaiming a principle which would  
exoose her superior number of ships of  
war, to so many iudigniats from inferi­  
or navies.  
As little ctn the genera! assurance  
that reparation* would be made, claim  
» return which could pioperly follow  
the actual reparation only. They can­  
not. amount to more than a disposition,  
or at most a promise to do what the  
aggressor may deem a fulfilment of his  
obligation. They do not prove even  
a disposition to do what may be satis­  
factory to the injured party, who can­  
not have less i.v.r an equal right  
to decide or. the sufficiency oi the »e­  
dress.  
  
in dispairr.rng a spccutj minister ror  
the purpose of adjusting the difference,  
the United &lt;S(ate* ought cheerfully to  
acknowledge all the proof it affords on  
the part oi his Britannic majesty of his  
pacific views towards them, rid of his  
respect for their friendship But whilst  
they could not, under any circumstan­  
ces, allow to the measure more than  
a certain participation in «*n honorable  
reparation, it is in he recollected that  
tht avowed and primary object of the  
mission was to substitute lot the more  
extended adjustment proposed by the  
United Staten at Lcndony a separation  
of the sublets as preferred by his  
Britannic ma jesty, and you well know,  
viir, how &quot;fully u.is object was accom­  
plished.  
With respect to the personal convic­  
tion w^.ich you have expressed, that  
the terms which you decline to disclose  
would be satisfactory to the United  
State*, it is incumbent on me to observe  
that with the highest respect for your  
judgment and the most perfect confi­  
dence in voiir sincerity, an insuperable  
objection manifestly lies, to the accep­  
tance of a personal and unexplained  
opinion in place of a disclosure which  
would enable this government to exer­  
cise its own judgment in a case effect­  
ing so essentially its honor and its  
rights. Such a course of proceeding  
would be without example ; and there  
can be no hazard inlaying that one will  
»^yer be offeredby a government which  
  
respects itself as much as yours justly  
does, and therefore can never be rea­  
sonably expected from one w hich res­  
pects itself as much as this has a right  
lo do.  
I forbear, Sir, to enlarge on theuin­  
rinsic incongruity of the expedi^u  
proposed. But 1 must be allowed to  
remark, as an additional admonition of  
he Angular and mortifying perplexity  
m which a compliance might involve  
the president, that Ihere are in the let­  
j ter of Mr. Cannings ctftnfhunicating to  
Mr. Mujiroe fhe-special mission to the  
United. State*, pregnant * indications  
that other questions and conditions may  
have been contemplated which would ■  
be found utterly irreconcilable with  
the sentiments of this nation.  
If neither any nor all of these consid­  
erations can sustain the preliminary  
demand made in your communication,  
it remains to be seen whether such a &#x27;  
demand rests with greater advantage  
to the more precise ground on which  
you finally seem to place it.  
•&#x27;he proclamation is considered a*? a  
hostile measure, and a discontinuance  
of it as due to t he discontinuance of the  
aggression which led to it.  
It has been sufficiently shewn that  
the proclamation, as appears on the  
face of it, was pioduced by a train of  
occurrences terminating in the attack 1  
on me Chesapeake frigate, and not by  
t his last alone. To a demand there lore  
that the proclamation be revoKed, it  
would be perfectly lair to oppose a de­  
mand that redress be first given for [  
the numerous irregularities wnich pre- )  
ceded the aggression on the Americar  
frigate, as well as for this particular  
aggression, and that effectual control he  
interposed against repetitions of them.  
And as no such red. ess lus been given  
for the past, notwithstanding the lapse  
ol time w.uch lias taken place, nor any  
such swcuiity for the future, notwith­  
standing the undiminished reasonable­  
ness of it, it follows, that a continuance  
oi the proclamation would be consistent  
with an entire discontinuance of one  
only of the occurrences irom which it  
proceded.  
  
But it ;s not Recessary to avail the  
argument ot this view oi the case, al-:  
enough of itself entirely conclusive.  
Had tne proclamation been founded on  
the single aggression committed on  
the C/it iafiraKCy aiui were it admitted  
that the discontinuance of that aggies­  
sion merely, gave a claim to the dis­

continuance of the proclamation, the  
claim would be defeated by the incon­  
testible fact, that that aggression has  
not been discontinued. It has never  
ceased to exist ; and is in existence  
at tais moment. Need I remind you,  
Sir, that the seizure and importation of  
the seamen beonging to the crew of  
tne Chesapeake entered into the very  
tssence of that aggression, that with  
an exception of the victim to a tiial  
forbidden by the most solemn consider­  
ations, and greatly aggravating the  
guilt of its author, the seamen in ques­  
tion are still retained, and consequently  
that the aggression, if in no otner res­  
pect, is by that act alone eontinual and  
in force ?  
if the view which have been taken of  
the subject have the justness which  
they claim, they will have shewn that  
on no ground whatever can an annul­  
ment of the proclamation of July 2d oc  
reasonably required as a preliminary  
to the negotiation with which you are  
charged. On the contraty it clearly  
results, from a recurrence to the causes  
and objects of the proclamation, tnat,  
as it was at first intimated, the strong­  
est sanctions of (ireat-Britain herself  
would support the demand, that previ­  
ous to a discussion-of the proclamation,  
  
cue satlslucl on should be made to the *  
United Stait* ; that this satisfaction ♦  
ought to extend to ail the wrongs which  
preceded and produced that act; and  
that even limiting the merits of the  
question to the single relation oi the  
proclamation to the wiong committed  
in the attack on the American trigale,  
and deciding tne questi n on the prin­  
ciple that a discontinuance of the latter&gt;  
required A iig.it a discontinuance of  
the torrner, nothing appears that does  
not leave such a preliminary destitute  
of every fourdation wnich could be as­  
sumed for it.  
With a light to draw this conclusion,  
the president might ha\e entrusted nit  
to clo.»e this communication, with the  
» reply stated in the beginning of it; and  
perhaps in taking this course, ne would  
only have consulted a sensibility, to  
which most governments would, in  
such a case, have yielded. But adhe­  
ring to the moderation by which he has  
been invariably guided, and anxious to  
rescue the two nations trom the cir­  
cumstances, under which an abortive  
issue to your mission necessarily pla­  
ces them, he has authorised me, in the  
event ot your disclosing terms of repa­  
ration which you believe will be satis­  
factory,.and on its appearing that they  
are so, to consider this evidence of the  
justice of his Britannic majesty as a  
pledge for an effectual interposition  
with respect to all the abuses against a  
recurrence of which the proclamation  
  
was meant to provide, and to proceed  
to &#x27;concert with you a revocation of that  
act bearing the same date with the act  
of reparation to which the United  
States are entitled.  
I am not unaware, Sir, that accord­  
ing to the view which you appear to  
have taken of your instructions, such  
a course of proceeding has not been  
contemplated by them It is possible,  
nevertheless, that arc-examination, in  
a spirit in which I am well persuaded it  
will be made, may discover them to be  
not inflexible to a proposition, in so  
high a degree liberal and conciliatory.  
In every event, the president will have  
manifested his willingness to meet  
your government on a ground of ac­  
commodation, which spares to its feel­  
ings, however misapplied he may deem  
them every concession, not essentially  
due to those which must be equally res­  
pected, and consequently will have de­  
monstrated that the very ineligible poa-1  
ture given to so important a subject in  
the relations of the two countries, by  
the unsuccessful termination of your j  
mission, can be referred to no other  
source than the rigorous restrictions  
under which it was to be executed.  
I make no apology, Sir, for the long  
interval between the date of your letter  
and that under which I write. It is ren­  
dered unnecessary by your knowledge  
of the circumstances to which the delay  
is to be ascribed.  
With high consideration and respect,  
I have the honor to be, Sir, Your most  
obedient servant

pent inougni is just ana expeoicnt to tnaerv .  
as a necessary ingredient b the adjustment;  
of the outrage committed on thev Amencaia L  
frigate,&#x27; a security against the future practice!  
of British naval wmmandc impressing  
from merchant vessels of the - United State &#x27;  
cat the high seas, such oi their crews as .  
  
they might undertake to denominate Br:  
subjects, -.a .-. &#x27;  
  
Tothis asaodation of the two. jswbjects,  
the President was determined, 1st, -by his  
regarding both as resting on kindred prL.ci­  
ples the immunity of private sliips with  
the known exceptions made by the law of  
nations, being as well established as that of  
public ships ; and there being no pretext for  
including b these, exceptions the impress­  
ment (if it could be freed from its enormous .  
and notorious abuses) of the. subjects of a  
belligerent, by &quot; the officers tf that bellige­  
rent. The rights of a belligerent against  
lMpf a neutral nation, accrue merely  
from the relation of the neutral to the other  
belligerent as fa conveying to him contraband  
,f wr OTin applying a blockaded porv ;  
&quot; &quot; The claim of a belligerent to search for  
and seise on board neutral vessels on the high  
seas JT5X under his allegiance, does ne t  
therefore rest on any belligerent right under  
the law of nations but on a prerogative de­  
rived frohx municipal law ; and involves the  
extravagant supposition, that one nation has  
a right to execute at all times and b all ca­  
ars its municipal laws and regulaticos m  
b rd the ships of another nation, not ber -  
  
wunui its territorial Umita.

I liegin with the occurrences frofnl  
  
which the proclamation ot July 2rj  
resulted. These are in general terms  
referred to by the instrumnt&#x27;itself.  
A more par icuiar notice of a part of  
them, will here be in place; . -  
Passing over, then, the j habitual  
but minor irregularities of his. Bit  
tannic Majes&#x27;y&#x27;s ships cf wit, in ma­  
king the hospitalities of our mrts sub­  
servient to the annoyance of ur trade,  
both outward and inward, a practice  
ttwt only contrary to the prficiples of  
public law, but expressly enforced  
during maiitime wars to which she  
bore a neutral relation, I am con­  
strained, unwelcome as the task is,  
to call your atten ion to the follow­  
ing more prominent instances.  
In the summer of the year 180,  
the British frigate thet Cambrian,  
with oilv r cruiz-rs in company, tn  
(ered the harbour of New York. The  
commander, Capt. Bra&#x27;clky, in tioIa  
ion of the port laws relating both to  
le.dth.. and revenue, caused a mer­  
.Jiaot vessel just arrived, and confes­  
sedly within the limits and under the  
Authority of the United Siatbs, to be  
boarded by persons under, his com.  
naiid, who, after resisting the offi  
ers of the port in the. legal exercise  
f their functions, actually impressed  
iud carried off a number of seamen  
md passengers into. the service of the  
hips of war.- On an appeal, to his  
voluntary icspect for the laws, he first  
l ukd to&#x27;gixe up the offender to jus-  
ice, and finally repelled the ofheer  
lurged with the regular process for  
.he purpose.  
This procedure was not only a fla  
grant insult toHhe sovereignty of ihe  
nation, but an infraction of its neu  
trality also, which did not permit a  
belligerent ship thus to augment its  
force within. the neutral territory  
To finish the scenr, this commander  
went so far as to deel -re, in an offi­  
cial letter to the minister plenipoten­  
tiary of his Britannic Majesty, and  
by him communicated to this go­  
vernment, that he considered his ship,  
whilst lying in the haibor of New­  
Yo k, a having dominion around her  
within the distance of her buoys.  
All thtse circumstances were duly  
made known to the Bt&#x27;uish govcrn­  
mvnt, in just expectation of honora­  
ble reparation. None has ever b-en  
ffered, Capt Dudley was advanced  
from his frigate to the command of a  
snip of the line. : -  
At a subsequent period, several  
British frigates under the command  
of Capt. Whitby, of the Leander, pur­  
suing the.practice of vexing the in­  
ward and outward trade of our ports,  
arid hovering for that purpose about  
he entrance of that &#x27;of New-York,&#x27;  
closed a series of irregularities, with  
an attempt to arrest a coasting res­  
sel, on board of which an American  
citiz- n was killed by a cannon ball  
vhich entered the vessel whilst with­  
in lessrthan a mile.from thehore.  
The blood of a citrren thus mur­  
dered, in a trade from one lb another  
port of his own country, and within  
the santtuaij;f its territorial juris­  
diction, couM not fail to arouse the  
seh&#x27;ibitky of the public, and to make  
a solemn appeal tPitbe&#x27;Uaticq. of ths  
British iivernmentrThe case was  
presented moreover, to&#x27; that govern-nient  
by this, in the accent which it  
renuired ; and &#x27;with due confidence  
thai the offender would receive than  
exemplary punishment which he de­  
served. Tliat die re might be no fai­

having ppeiied the way. bv an ac­  
quiescence in the separation of the  
two cases insisted on by his Bri­  
tannic majr&#x27;uy notwithstanding  
the strong ground on whiclv they  
had been united by the President  
it was not to te oouoieu mat a i  
tender of the satisfaction claimed  
by the United States, for a distin­  
guished and an acknowledged in­  
sult, by.ooc of his ofiicers, vrouid  
immediately follow. ,  
It ras not, therefore, without  
a very painful surprize, that the  
error of, this expectation was dis­  
covered. Instead of the satisfac­  
tion due from the original aggres­  
Mon, it was announced that thf-

an insuperable obstacle -to a nego­  
ciafion, even on the subject of the  
aggression which preceded it ; in  
other word?, that th - proclamation  
must be put out ol force, before ai  
adjustment, of the nggression can  
be taken into discussion.  
In expljining the grounds of this  
extraordinary demand, it Is ailed­  
ged to be supported by the consi­  
deration that the proceeding and  
pretensieu of the offending officer  
lias been disavowed : that general  
assurances are given of a disposi­  
tion and intention in his Britan­  
nic majesty to make satisfaction;

purpose of carrying into effect this

be deemed try the United btates !  
satisfactory &#x27; ,  
With respect to the disavowal,  
it would be unjnst not to j-egardit  
as a proof of candor and amity to­

whilst they could not, .under afly  
circumstances, allow to the mea­  
surelmore than a certain partjcipar  
tion irt an hondraole reparatibrtit  
is to be recollected that the avowed

the U, States, at-London, a .sepa­  
ration of the subjects, as preferred  
I by his Britannic majesty; and. you  
well know, sir, how lull)tlus ob­  
ject was accomplished. &#x27;4  
With respect to the personal  
conviction which you nave ex­  
pressed, that the terms which you  
decline to disclose would be satis­  
factory to the United States, it is  
incumbent cn me to observe, that  
with&#x27; the highest respect for your  
judgment, and the mbsr perfect  
confidence in your sincerity, an  
insuf arable objection manifestly  
lies, to the acceptance of.&#x27;tfApeK&#x27;

and there can br no hazard in say  
ing that one will never he afforded  
by a government which re?pectsx  
itself as much s yours justly, does ;  
and therefore t an never be rtua-  
bly expected from one which res  
pects itstli a; much as this has ;i  
right tr do. . !  
. I forbear, sir, to enlarge on tht  
intrinsic imongruity of th expe­  
oient prcpostd. Bat I must be  
I&#x27;l- &#x27;cd to rennrh, as :Uil:iw)n-  
i  
il ndmoni&#x27;io&#x27;.i  
of  
the binguLr and  
moitifing iv.rplcxity in which, u  
i compUanec might involve t ie Pre-  
ichnt, that there are in the leaer  
of JMr. Canning, cocimucicated  
to Mr. Monroe the special mis­  
sion to the U. Suter, pregnant  
indications that other questions &#x27;S;  
conditions may have beencpntem­  
pLted, which would he found ut­  
ter.&#x27; irreconcilable with the senti­  
ments of this nation  
If neither any nor all or these  
considerations fao sustain the pre-  
rtliminar demand mad in your  
communication, it remains to be  
-een whether, such a dem irid rests  
with , great. r advantage on tbc  
more precise ground on which  
you finally seem to plae it. .  
The proclamation is considered  
as a hostile- measure, and a &#x27;dis­  
i ontinuancfc1 of it, as due to the,  
discontinuance of the aggressiop  
which led to it : &#x27; -  
It has been sufficiently shewn  
mai inc proclamation, as appears  
on the face 6f it, was &#x27;produced  
by a train &#x27;of occurrences Jtermi-  
natinrr in the attack on.the Amfe-  
ican frigate, and no by;tbis last  
alone. To a demand, therefore  
that the proclamation be revoked,  
it would be perfectly fair &#x27;to op­  
pose a demand that redress be,,  
first given for the numerous irre­  
gularities which preceded, the ag­  
gression on the Amerleanfrjgate,NV  
as well as? for this particular ..&#x27;ac­  
gression, and -hat effectual; cpn­

redress has been gi vcnv fo r the pas t  
notwithstanding the lapse- if time

such security for the future, npt1  
withstanding the undiminishedJ

(that a continuance of&#x27; the &#x27;prdcla­

an entire discontinuance j &#x27;of out

I have had the honor to receive and  
lay before the President, vour letter of  
the *6th of January, in which you state  
that you uic “ expressly precluded by  
jour instructions front entering upon anv  
negociation for the adjustment of the dif­  
ferences arising from the encounter of  
his Britanic majesty&#x27;s ship Leopard, and  
the frigate of the U. States Chesapeake,  
as long as the proclamation of the Presi­  
dent of the 2J of J uly, 180/, shall be  
in Ibrce.&quot;  
The demand, sir, might jusdy suggest  
the simple answer, t! at before the pro­  
clamation of the President could become  
a subject of consideration, satisfaction ,  
should be made for the acknowledged  
aggression .which preceded it. This is  
evidently agreeable to the urder of time,  
to the order of reason, and, it might be  
added, to the order of usage, as main­  
tained by Great Britain whenever in a­  
nalogou* cases she has been the cobs,  
plaining partv. &gt; _ : ■ ^  
But a* you have subjoined lb the pre­  
liminary demand, certain explanation*,  
with a vie# doubtless to obviate such an  
answer, it will best accord, with the esn­  
dor of the President, to meet them with  
such a review of the w^e subject, M  
will preseat the solid grounds on which  
he regards such a demand ss inadmissible.  
1 begin with the occurences from  
which the proclamation of July id, re­  
■ghlted. .7 hese are in general terms **•  
(erred to, by the instrument itself. A  
more particular notice of the most Im­  
portant of them, will here be in place.  
Passing over then, the habitual, but  
rpinor irregularities of Hi* Britanic Ma­  
jesty’s ships of war, in malting the hos­  
pitalities of our pbrta subservient to the.  
annoyance of our trade, both outward  
and inward&#x27; a praticc not only contrary  
to the principles of publie&#x27;Iaw, but ex­  
pressly contrary to British ordinance*  
enforced during maritime years, to which  
she bore a neutral relation, I am con­  
strained, unwelcome as the task it, to  
| call your attention to the following more  
prominent instances. ., . .;  
In (He summer of the vear 1804, the  
British frigate the Cambrian, with other  
cruisers in company, entered the bar:  
hour of New-York. The commander,  
, captain Bradley, in violation of the port  
laws, relating both try. health and reve­  
nue, caused a merchant vessel, just ar­  
rived, i.nd confessedly within the limits  
and under the authority of the United  
States, to be boarded by persona under j  
,, 4 ■&#x27; t &quot;&quot; &#x27;  
t  
  
his command, who, after resisting the  
office! t of the port, ia the legal eaercise  
of theil functioni, actually impressed  
and carried off a number of seamen and  
passengers into the service of the ships  
of «u, On an appeal to his voluntary  
respect for the laws, he irst filled to  
give up the offender to Justice, and i&lt;  
nally repelled the oifcer charged with  
the regular process for the purpose*  
This procedure was not only a flagrant  
insult to the sovereignty bf the nation,  
hut sn infraction of ita neutrality also,  
which did not permit a belligerent ship  
thus to sugmeot its force within the neu­  
tral territory. r  
, Tb finish the scene, this eotnmandcr  
■went so far ss to declare, in an official  
letur to the minister plenipotentiary of  
his Britannic majesty, and by him com­  
municated to this government, that he  
considered his ship, whilst lying in the  
harbour of New-Y&lt;&gt;Ht, as having domi­  
nion around her, within the distance of  
her buoc s.  
AH these circumstance* being duly  
made known to the British government  
in just expectation of honorable repara­  
tion. None has ever been offered, capt.  
Bradley was advanced from his frigate  
to the command of a ship of the line­  
A t a subsequent period, several Bri­  
tish frigates under the command of capt,  
Whitby, of the Lcandcf, pursuing the  
practice of vexing the iuward sod out­  
ward trade of our ports, and hovering  
for that purpose about the entrance of  
that of New-York, doted a series of ir­  
regularities, with an attempt to. arrest a  
coasting vessel, on board of which an  
American citizen was killed by a can­  
non ball which entered the vessel, whilst  
Within leas than a mile from the shore.  
The Hood of a citizen thus murdered  
in a traefe from one to another port of  
his own country, and within the sanctu­  
ary of ita territorial jurisdiction, could  
not fail to arouse the sensibility of the  
public, and to make n solemn appeal to  
the justice of the British government.  
The case was presented moreover to  
that government by this, in the accent  
which it required t and with due confi­  
dence that the offender would receive  
the exemplary punishment which he de­  
served. r That there might be no failure  
of legal proof of a fact sufficiently noto­  
rious of itself, uncsceptionable witnes­  
ses to establish it, weie sent tn Great  
Britain at the expense of the United  
States.  
  
Captain Whitby was, notwithstanding  
honorably acquitted; no animadversion  
took place on any other oficcr belonging  
to the squadron i, nor has any apology or  
explanation been made since the trial  
was over, an a conc&#x27;.latory of. ring to the  
disapp ininritrni of this country at such a  
mull. . “  
A case of another character occurred  
in the month of September, 1806 —  
The Impetueun, n .French ship of T4  
guns, when aground within n few hun­  
dred yard* of the shore of North Caroli­  
oa, and therefore visibly within die ter­  
fitpi ial jurisdiction and hospitable pro*  
tection of the (Juited States, was fired  
upon, boarded and burnt, from three  
British ships of war, undeir the command  
of Captain Douglas.. Having completed  
this outrage on the sovereignty and neu­  
trality of v»e U- S. the Biituh comman  
d&lt;r felt bO scruple in proceeding thence,  
Norfolk, nor in the  
Into the waters near  
midst of the hospitalities enjoyed by bias,  
to add to what had passed, a refusal to  
discharge from his ships, impressed  
citizens of the U&gt; S. not denied to be  
such, on the plea, that the government  
of the U S. had refused to surrender to  
the demand of Admiral Berkeley, cer­  
tain seamen, atlcdge&lt;l to be British de­  
serters—« demand which it is wtB un­  
derstood, your government disclaims  
any right to make.  
It would be very superfluous to dwell  
oa the features which mark the aggravat­  
ed insult. Hut 1 must be permitted to  
remind you, that in so serious a light,  
was a similar violation of oeutr»l_terri­  
tory by ^he destruction of certain r reach  
ships on the coast of Ponugtt? by a Ifir i­  
tish squadron untitr the «ton»»(J of  
Admiral Uoicyveq, regarded by the  
court of Orest-Britain, thgt a minister  
extraordinary w as dispatched for the ex­  
press purpose of expiating thq aggres­  
sion on the sovereignty of a friendly  
power. sSsaMri .  
r  
  
Lastly presents ituK, the attack b f  
the British ship atmr Leopard, «a the  
American frigate Chesapeake, a  
too fsAillaT tb all its circumstances to  
need a recital cfauy part of them. It  
is sufficient to rental!, that the conclu­  
sive evidence, which this event added  
to that nrhich had preceded, « f the un­  
controlcd eat cases of the British naval  
command*?*, in insulting our sovereign­  
ty, and abusinf-our hospitality, deter­  
mined the President to extend to all  
British armed ships, the precaution  
heretofore applied u» a it* by name,  
interdicting to them the use and privi­  
leges of our harbonrs and waters.  
This was done byliis proctaasatkm of  
July Id, 1*07, referring to the scries of  
occurrences ending with the aggression  
on the frigate Chesapeake, aa the consi­  
derations requiring it. And if the ap­  
prehension from the licentious spirit of  
the British Naval commanders, than  
developed and uncontrolled, which led  
to ihia measure of precaution, could  
need other justification than was albfdai  
by what had passed, it would ha amply  
found in the subsequent conduct of thin  
ships under the command of the aaaan  
CMDC* DoUfildls  
This officer, neither admonished bjr  
reflections on the crises produced by the  
attack on the Chesapeake, nor controlcd  
by respect for the law of nations, or dm  
laws of the land, did not  
our waters to bring to,  
acla pursuing their rei  
trade and in thb same spirit which M  
displayed itself in the recant outrage  
committed on the Ansrioa Frigate, he  
not only indulged himaclf in hostile  
threats, and indications of a hostile ap­  
proach to Norfolk, hot actually obstruct­  
ed our citizens ia the ordinary commu­  
nication between that and neighboring  
places. Mia proceedings constituted ia  
fact, a blockade of the port, and aa real  
invasion of the country, according to the  
extent of his force, aa if troops had been  
debarked, and the town besieged on dm  
land side.  
course at  
  
Was it possible for the chief masts,  
trate of a natioa, who felt for Its rights  
and its honor, to do less than interrose  
some measure of precaution, at kast a&gt;  
gainst the repetition of enormities which  
had been to long uncontrolled bjr the  
government, whose oficera had com.  
mitted them, and which had sTUat taken  
the exorbitant shape of ^hostility and of  
insult seen in the attack on dm frigate  
Chesapeake i , Candor «iU pronounce  
that less could uot be done 5 and K will  
as readily admit that the proclamation  
comprising that measure, could not  
have breathed a more temperate tfpsrit,  
nor spbkcn a becoming tone. How hr  
it has received, from those* whose in.  
irueiona it prohibited, the respect due  
to the national authority, or been  
thr occasion of new indignities,  
no explanation. , ....  
The President having interposed thin  
precautionary interdict, lost no time he  
instruct in a the minister plenipotentiary  
of the U. States, to Represent toths Bn.  
which had been committed on their  
sovereignty end their lag, and te rw&gt;  
quire satisfaction due foe It j twdslsmg  
the expectation that his Brits oak ftMjr*&#x27;  
ty would at once perceive it to bt the  
truest rnagnsaimity, as wett as the strict,  
cat justice, to offer that prompt and Ml  
expiation of an acknowledged wrong  
which would establish and laaprove,  
both In fret and in feeling, tbs stats of  
things which it had violated.  
This expectation was considered as  
not only hoaorable to tbs send moats of  
his majesty, hut . mas. supported by ,  
known examples, la which, bring the  
complaining party* ha had required and  
obtained, as a preliminary to any ceua&gt;  
ter complaints whatever, a precise re.  
placemcatof thiags, in every practica.  
ble circumstance, in the preexisting  
situation. ....  
Thus in the year 1764, Bermudians  
sad other British subjects, who had sc.  
cording to annual custom,; taken posses*  
*»fH|.of Turk’s.ULmd- iur the season of  
making salt, having been forcibly re­  
moved with their vessels and effects by

ings should, be disavowed^ the intention

orders’given for the immediate tfban.  
donmentof it an the part of the French,  
every thing resided to the condition in  
which it w»a at the time of the »jnreMMBy  
dnd reparation made of the damage&#x27;s  
whkh any British subjects should be  
found to have sustained* according to an  
estimation to be settled between the go*  
Vernon of St D &gt;mmgo hod Jamaica.  
A compliance with the whok of this de­  
mand was the result  
Again:—In the year 1789, certain  
English merchants having opened a trade  
at N outka sound, on the north weet coast  
of America, attempted a settlement at  
that place, the Spaniardr#1to had tong  
claimed that part of the world at their  
eaclusive property, dispatched a frigate  
from/Mesico, which captured the two  
£ngtish vessels engaged in the trade, and&#x27;  
broke up the settlement on the coast.  
The Spanish government was the first to  
complain, in this case, of the intrusions  
committed by tbe British merchants.  
The British government, however, de­  
manded that the vessels taken by the  
Ksh fi igate should be restored^ and  
. #a Satisfaction granted, previous  
10 other di acuteitn*.  
This demand prevailed j the Spanish  
government agreeing to make full resto­  
ration or the captured vessels, and to in­  
demnlfy the parties interested in them  
far tbe losses sustained. They restor­  
ed also the buddings and tracts of land,  
of which the British subjects had been  
dispossessed- rlhe British, however,  
► •on gsve proof of the little vslne they  
fcet on the poss&#x27;ession. by a voluntary  
dereiictiofi, under which it has since re­  
mained.&quot;&#x27;-1^ ~&gt;- v &#x27; •  
. The case which will be noted last,  
though of a date prior to the case or  
tfootka sound, is that of Falkland’s isl­  
ands. These islands lie about 100  
leagues eastward of the streights of *Ma  
getlaa. The title to them had been i  
subject of controversy among several ol  
the iharitime nations of Europe. Frore  
the position of the Islands, and other  
Circumstances; the pretension of Spain  
ht re an idrahtageous comparison with  
those of her competitors. In the yeat  
1770, the British took possession oi  
Port Egmcw, in one of the islands ; the  
Spaniards being at the time in possession  
oi another pair, and protesting against i  
settlement by the British, 1 he protes  
being without effect, ships and troop:  
were sent from Buenos Ayres, by Um  
governor of lhat place, which forcibly  
dispossessed and drove off the British  
settlers. - •&#x27; .  
  
1 he British government looking en­  
tirely to the dispossession by force, de­  
manded ana specific condition of pre­  
serving harmony between the two courts,  
®*t Mily the disavowal of the Spanish pro­  
ceeding ; but that the affairs of that, set­  
tle meat should be immediately restored  
to the praise state in which they were  
previous tothe act of dispossession. T he  
Spanish government Baade some dificul­  
ties; requiring, paniculafly a disavowal  
on the part of &lt;iren-lV uain, of the con­  
duct of her officer at Falkland’s islands,  
which, it was eiledged. gave occasion to  
the steps taken by the Spanish governor;  
nod proposing an adjustment by mutual  
stlpulstions ia the ordinary Cornu  
&quot;The replv was, that the moderation of  
his Britannic majesty haring limited his  
demand to the smallest reparation he  
could accept furthe Injury done,&#x27; nothing  
was left for discussion but the mode Ot  
carrying the disavowalnod restitution io­  
to execution ; reparation kotigitr valui  
tfrt ke conditional, and to he obtained  
by any stipulation whatever from die  
part# injured.  
\ The Spanish government yielded.  
The Violent proceedings off its * C fleer*  
were disavowed. The fort, the poit,  
snd every thiog else w»re agreed to be  
immediately restored to th« precise si­  
tuation Which had been disturbed; and  
duplicajjt&gt;fs of orders tfcued for the pur.  
pose tothe Spanish o&amp;eers, were d&lt;­  
Ttvered into the hands of one of the Bri­  
tish principal secretaries of state. Here  
again it is to be rental ked, that satisfac­  
tion bating been made for the forcible  
dispoascssion, thVislands lost their ins­  
pot ranCc in the eyes of the British go­  
veminent, were ia a short time finally&#x27;  
evacuated. and Port Kgmout remains  
with event other part of them in the  
hands of Spain. . «Y­  
Could stringer pledges have been  
giten, than are here found, that an ho  
n &#x27;Vtblc sod instant reparation would be  
mi&amp;c in eases* differing no otherwise  
from those settled, than as it furnished  
tothe same monarch of a great nation,  
an opportunity to prove; that  
adhering  
always to thy same immutable principi  
  
u  
he witt as ready to da light tc tftars, a*  
to require it tor Itiiiotlf.  
Returning to the instructions given to  
the amiutr plenipotentiary of the Uni­  
ted State* at London, I ata to observe,  
that the President thought it just and ex*  
pedient to inxtYt, a* a necessary ingredi­  
ent In the adjustment of the outrage coin,  
aaitted on the American frigate, a se­  
curity against the future practice of  
British tueal coihinaDdtrs, in impress­  
ing bon merchant vetsds of the. Uni ted  
States on the high seas, such of their  
creWs as they might Undertake to de­  
nominate British subjects.  
, To this association of the two sub­  
jects the President was determined, 1st,  
by hlsYrgarding both M resting on kin­  
dred principles, the immunity of private  
ships, with the jtnowia exceptions made  
by the law ot nations being as well ev  
tabliahed at that of public ships; and  
there being no pretext for including in  
Utise exceptions the impressment (if it  
could be Avrd from its enbrmous andno­  
tnlriotis abuses} of the subjects of a bel*  
ligerent, by the officers of that beiligo*  
r^nt. &#x27;1 he rights of a belligerent, a­  
gainst the ships of a neutral nati &lt;n, ac­  
crue m&lt; rely ftdm the relation of the neu­  
tral to the other belligerent, as in con­  
veying to him contraband of war, or in  
supply mg a blockaded port  
The claim of a belligerent to search  
for, and seize on board aeutfal vessels  
on the high seas, persons under his al­  
legiance, does not therefore rest on any  
helligtitnt ri« ht under the law of nati­  
ons, but on a prerogative derived from  
municipal law; and involves the extra­  
vacant supposition, that one natioo ha*  
a right to execute at all times, and in all  
cases, its municipal laws and regulations,  
on board the ships of another nation, not  
being within its territorial limits.  
  
me rresident was led to toe note  
determination, 2dly, by his desire of  
converting a particular incident; into sn  
occasion for removing another and more  
extensive source of danger to the harmo­  
ny of the two countries—-And idly, by  
his persuasion that the liberality of the  
propositions authorised with this view,  
would not fail to induce the feady con­  
currence of his B. majesty ; and that (be •  
more extensive source of irritation and  
perplexity being removed, a satisfactory  
adjustment of the particular incident  
Would be the less difficult. The Presi­  
dent itlH thinks that such vfould have  
been the tendency of the ih &gt;de fee&#x27;which  
he had provided; and he ubbot there­  
fore but regret, that the door was s^t  
against the experiment, by the peremp­  
tory refusal of Mr. Canning to admit it  
into discussion, even io the moat infer,  
mal manner, as was suggested by Mr.  
Monte*.  
The President felt greater regret as  
the Step he had taken towards a more en­  
larged and lasting accommodation be­  
cam* thus a bar to the adjustment of the  
particular and recent aggression which j  
bad been committed against the United,;  
Stutt- He found, however, an allcvi-*  
ation,, in the signified purpose of his  
BHtatthte majesty, to charge with this  
adjustment a. special mlaeioo to the U.;  
Stales, which, restricted as it was,*eera.  
ed to indicates disposition Isom which a  
liberal and conciliator j arrangement of  
one great object at lecst might be confi­  
dently expected. V ,,  
■ In this confidence, , yopr arrival was!  
awaited with every friendly solicitude—  
and our first inters iew having opened the  
»iy» hy an acquiescence ia the separa­  
tion of the two cases insisted on by his  
Britannic majesty, notwithstanding the  
strong ground ou which they bad been  
united by the President, it washet to L*  
dottbud that a under of the satisfactioa  
claimed by the United States, for a dis­  
tinguished and an acknowledged insult,  
hv one of his officers, would immediate­  
ly follow. „ -t  
/ It was nor, therefore., without a very  
painful sorprtxe, that the error of this  
expectation was discovered. Instead of  
the satisfaction due from I he original ag­  
greasion, h was announced that the first  
step towards the adjustment aftust pro  
ceed from the party injured; and your  
letter now before mi, formally repeats&#x27;,  
that aa long as the proclamation of the’  
I President, which issued on the 2d of Ju­  
ly, tadf, shall be in forenit will be an  
insuperable obstacle t6 a negotiation,  
even oh tHe subject of the aggression  
which preceded it, in 6Ch«r words, the  
proclamation roust be put out bf force,  
before an adjustment of the aggression  
can be taken into discussion­  
In espUining the grounds of this ex- !  
ttaordtnatv demand, it i^alledgerl to ba .  
supported by the consideration that the  
proceeding and pretension of die ofifand­  
ing officer baa been disavowed: that ge­  
neral assurances are given of a disposi­  
tion and intention in bis, Britannic majea­  
&#x27; i. * &#x27; * v I  
- -,&gt;  
  
&quot;  
t) tu m«ke satisfaction j iWt * ip«cij  
| minister «m dispatched with prompti­  
tude fpr the purpose of carrying into ef­  
fect this disposition ; nod that you hove  
n persons! conviction that the particular  
terms, which you are not at liberty to  
disclose, will be deemed by the U. States  
satisfactory.  
With respect to the disavowed it would  
be unjust not to regard it as a proof of  
candor and amity towards theU- States,  
and as some presage of the voluntary re­  
paration which it implies to be due. Bui  
the disavowal can be the lesa confounded  
with the reparation itself; since it was  
sufficiently required by the respect which  
G. Britain owed to her own honor; it  
being impossible that an enlightened go­  
vernment, had hostility been misditattd,  
wo ild have commenced it in aocb a  
manner, and in the midst of existing pro­  
fessions of peace and friendship. She  
owed it also to consistency with a disa­  
vowal on a former occasion, in which  
the pretension had been enforced by a  
British squadron, against the sloop of  
war Baltimore, belongings to the United  
States; and finally to the interest which  
G Britain has, more than any other na­  
tion ill disclaiming a principle which  
would expole her superior number of  
ships of war to so many Indignities from  
interior navies. ” &quot; *  
As little can the verier*! assurances  
that reparation wotild be made, claim a  
peturn which could properly follow the  
actual reparation only. They cannot  
amount to more than a disposition, or at  
most a promise to do what the aggressor  
may deem a fulfilment of hit obligation.  
They do not prove even a disposition to  
do What nlay be satisfactory to the in*  
jured party, who cannot have leas than  
an equal right to decide on the sufficien­  
cy of the redress.&#x27;  
  
In dispatching a special minister for  
the purpose of adjusting the difference,  
the United States ought cheerfully to  
acknowledge all the proof it affords on  
the part of his Britannic majesty of his  
pacific views towards them, and of his  
respect for their friendship. But whilst  
they emifinot, under any circumstan­  
ces, allow to the measure more than a  
certain particitation in an honorable re­  
paration, ilia to he recollected that the  
avowed arid primary object of thfe mis­  
sion was to substitute for the more etf­  
l-ndcd adjustment proposed by the U­  
nited Sta&#x27;ea, »t London, a separation of  
the subjects as prefei red by his Hj4n.  
ntc majesty, and you well know, »ir,  
how fully this object was accomplished.&#x27;  
With respect to the personal convic­  
tion which \ ou have expressed, that the  
terms which you decline to disclose  
would be satisfactory to the United  
States, it rs incumbent on me toebserve  
that with the highest respect for your  
judgment and the most perfect confi,  
dence in your sincerity, an insuperable  
objection manifestly lies, to the accrp.  
tance of a personal and unexplained o­  
pinion, in place of a disclosure which  
would enable this government to e*er­  
cite its own judgment in a case affecting  
so essentially its honor and its rights.  
Such a course of proceeding would be  
without example ; and there can be no  
hazard in say ing that one will never be  
afforded by a government which respects  
itself as much as yours justly does ; and  
therefore can never be reasonably ex­  
pected from one which reSpccts itself as  
much as this has a right to do.  
I forbear, sir, to enlarge on the jn­  
trinsic incongruity of the expedient pro­  
posed. But I must be allowed, to re­  
mark, as an additional admonition of  
the singular and mortifying perplexity  
«n which a compliance might involve the  
president, tint there are ia the letter of  
♦Ir. Canning, communicating to Mr.  
Munroe the special mission to the U­  
nttrd States, pregnant indications that  
other questions and conditions may  
h*ve been contemplated which would  
be found utterly irreconcileahle with the  
sentiments of this nation.  
If nether any nor all of these eon­  
sideraiionactn sustain the preliminary  
demand made in your communication,  
it remains to be se#n whether such a de­  
mand rests with greater advantage on  
the more precise ground on which you  
finally seem to place it. i  
The proclamation is considered as a  
hosttU wswri, and a discontinuance,  
of it as due to dm discontinuance of the  
nggresston which led to it.  
l&gt;«en sufficiently shewn that the  
proclamation, ys appears oo the face of  
it, was produced by a train of occur,  
rentes term,n«ing in the stuck on the  
American frigate, and not by this last  
alone. To a demand therefor* that the  
proclamation be revoked, it should lie  
perfectly fair to oppose a demand that  
redress he first given for the numerous  
irregularities which preceded the ag­  
  
grevhtoo on the American frigite, »»  
welt as for this particular sg^r. ssion,  
sod that effectual controulbe mic^ted  
against repetitions oi them. And as no  
such redress has beta giv^a for the p.st,  
notwithstanding the lapse of time which  
has taken place, nor any such security  
for the future, notwithstanding the un­  
diminished reasonableness of it, tt fol­  
lows, that a continuance of the procla­  
mation would be consistent with an en­  
tire discontinuance of one only of the &gt;  
occurrences from which it proceeded.  
Hut it is not necessary to avail the ar­  
gument of this view of the case, al*  
though of itself entirely conclusive.  
Had the proclamation been founded on  
thfc single aggression conrhmted on the  
Chesapeake, and were it admitted that  
the discontinuance of that aggression  
merely, gave a claim to the discontinu­  
ance of the proclamation, the claim  
would be defeated by the incorxe?iible  
tact, thst that aggression has not been  
discontinued. cf .  
It has never ceased to exist i and is in  
existence st tins moment. Need 1 re­  
mind you, sir, that the Seizure and  
asportation of the seamen belonging to  
thecrewof the Chesapeake, entered in­  
to the very essence of thst aggressioo,  
that with ah exception of the victim to  
a trial forbidden by the most solemn con­  
siderations, and greatly aggravating the  
guilt of its author, the teamen in ques­  
tion are still retained, and consequently  
that the aggression, jf in no other res­  
pect, is by that act alone continued snd  
la force ?  
  
If the views which, have been taken of  
the subject have the justness which they  
claim, they will bdve shewn that on no  
ground whatever can an annulment cf  
the pio laroation of July *d, be reason*  
ably required, as a preliminary to the  
negotiation with which you are charged.  
On the contrary, it clearly results, from  
* recurrence to the causes and object of  
the proclamation, that, as was at firs«  
intimated, the strongest aahctibna of  
Great-Brilsiu herself, wobld support  
the demand^ that previous to a discus,  
sion of the proclamation, due satisfac­  
tion sbouldf be made to the United  
States f that this satisfaction ought to  
extend to all the wrongs which preceded  
and produced that act; and that even  
limiting the merits of the question to  
the single relation of the proclamation  
to the wroog committed iqthe stuck on  
the American frigate, -and deciding the  
question on the principle that a diston­  
tmuauce of the latter requited of right  
a discontinuance of the former, nothing  
appears that does not leave such a pre­  
liminary destitute of every foundation  
which could be assumed For it.  
• W ith a right to draw this conclusion,  
the President might have instructed me  
to close this communication, with the.”  
reply stated in the beginnir g of it; and  
perhaps in taking this course, be would  
only have consulted a sensibility, to  
which most governments would, in such  
a case, have yielded. But adhering to  
the moderation by which he has been in­  
variably guided, and anxious ,p rescue  
the two nations from the circumstances,  
under which an abortive issue to yoor  
mission necessarily places them, he has  
authorised me, in the evenfjkf your dis­  
closing the terms of repartition which you  
believe will be satisfactory, and on its  
appearing that they are so, to consider  
this evidence of justice of his Britannic  
majesty as a pledge for an effectual in­  
imposition with respect to all the abuses  
against a recurrence of which the procla­  
mation was meant to provide, and to  
proceed to concert with you a revocation  
of that act bearing the same date whh  
the let of reparation to which the United  
States ere entitled. * t  
I am not unaware, air, that according  
tp the view which jou appear to havfc  
taken of yoor instructions, such a course  
of proceeding has not been contemplated  
bv them. 1c is possible, nevertheless,  
that a reexamination, in a spirit- in  
which I am well persuaded it will be  
made, may discover them to be . not in­  
dexible to a proposition, in so high a de­  
gree liberal and conciliatory. In every  
event, the. President will have manifest­  
ed hi* wiUtngness to meet your govern­  
ment on a ground of accommodation,  
which spares to its feelings, however  
misapplied he may deem them, every  
concession, not essentially due to those  
which if net be equally respected!, end  
consequently will nave demonstrated that  
the very ineligible posture given to so  
important a subject in the relations of  
the two ebuntries, by the unsuccessful  
termination of your mission, can be re­  
ferred to no other louKe than the rigo­  
rous restrictions unddr*which it was to  
be executed. t &#x27; j  
I make no apology, sir, for the long  
interval between the date of your letter

Sir—l have had the honor to receive and lay  
before the President, youretter of the 26th Jan- |  
uary, in which you Rate, that you are “expressly |  
precluded by your infiructions from entering  
upon any negociation for the adjuflment of ths  
differences arising from the enconater dF his Bri­  
tannic majclty’s (hip the Leopard, and the fri.  
gate of the U. States, the Chesapeake, as long  
- as the proclamation of the President of the 2d of  
Juiy, 1803, fhisdl be in force.”” , .  
This demand, fir, might justly fogoel the  
simple an{wer; that before the proclamation of  
the President could become a fubje&amp;t of conlid­  
eration, fatisfa&amp;ion should be mad: for the ac­  
knowledged aggreflion which preceded it. This  
is evidently agreeable to the order of time, to  
the order of reason, and, it may be added, to the  
order of ufige, as maintained by G: Britain,  
whenever in analogous cases, {he has beed the  
complaining party.  
But as you have subjoined to the preliminary  
demand,certain explanations, with a view, doubt­  
llefs to obviate such an answer, it will best ac­  
cord with the candor of the President, to meet  
themn with such a review of the whole subject, as  
will present the solid grounds on which&#x27; he re­  
gards such a demand, as inadmifiible.  
I begin with the dccurrences from which the  
proclamation of July 24, refulced. These are in  
general terms referred toy by the instrument it­  
f=lf. A more paticnlar notice of the molt im­  
portant of them, will here be in place. &#x27;  
Pafling over then, the habitual but minor ir­  
regularities of his Dritannic’ majesty’s ships of -  
war, in making the hofpiialities of our ports,  
*® subservient to the annoyance of our trade, both  
outward and inward, a praice not c.ily contra.  
ry to the principles of public law, but expressly  
conirary to British ordinzncss enforced during -  
marititae wars, 10 which ihe bore a neutral le­  
lation, I 2m conflrained, unwelcome as the tatk  
is, to call your attention to the following more  
prominent instances. 9 ‘  
In the summer of the year 1804, the Britth  
frigate the Cambrian with other cruizers in com­  
pany, eatered the harbor of N. Yoik. The ccm­  
mznder, Capt. Dradley, in violation of the port  
laws, relatiag toth to health and revenue, eanf.  
ed a 2 merchant vef:l, jult arrived, and conf:fled- j  
}y within the limits and under the authority of  
the U. States, to be boarded by persons under­  
his command, who, after refilting the officers of  
the port, io the legal exercise of their fun&amp;ions,  
a&amp;uaally imprefled and carried off a number of  
seamen and paflengers into the service of the  
ships of war. On an appzal to his voluatary re­  
&quot; fpe&amp; for the laws, he firit_failed to pive up the  
offen et to juftice.and finally repelled the officer  
&#x27; charged with the regular process for the purpose. |  
This ptocedure was not only a flagrantdnfult  
“to the sovereignty of the nation, but an infrac­  
tion of its neuirclity aifo, which did not permit  
a belligerent (hip thus to augment its force with­  
in the neutral territory. .  
&quot; To finith the scene, this commander went so  
far as to declare, in an official letter, to the min.  
iter plenipotentiary of his Britannic majesty,  
&quot; and by him communicated to this government,  
that he considered his ship, whilit lying in the  
harbor of New York, as having dominion around  
her, within the distance of her buoys.  
Al these circumitances were duly made  
known to the British government in jult expe­  
ation of honorable reparation. None has ever  
baen offered. Capt. Bradley was advanced from  
his frigate tothe command of a ship of the line.  
At a subsequent period, several Britith fri­  
gates under the command of captain Whitby, of  
. theLeaader, pursuing the pra&amp;ice of vexing the  
inward and outward trade of our ports, and  
hovering for that purpose about the entrance of  
that of New York, closed a series of irregulari­  
ties, with an attempt to arrest a coalting veflel,  
on board of which an American citizen was kill­  
&quot;ed by a cannon ball which entered the veilul,  
whil® within less than a mile from the shore.  
The blood of a citizen thus murdered, in a  
trade from one to another port of his own coun­  
try, and within the fanuary of its teriitorial ju.  
yi{di&amp;ion, could not fail to arouse the sensibility  
.of the public, and tomake a solemn appeai to  
“the justice of the British governmeant. The case  
“was presented moreover to that government by  
this, in the accent which it required ; and with  
“due confidence that the offender would receive:  
the exemplary punithment which he deserved.  
Tt}fn‘ there might be no failure of legal proof of  
&lt;&amp; fa&amp; fufficiently notarious of itfelf, unexcep­  
tiohable witnefl=s to establish it were sent to  
“i({3reat Britain at the expence of the U, States.

mand of Captain Douglass, Idivicg completed  
this outrage on the sovereignty and neutrality of  
the Uaited States, the Britith commandsf feicno

Notfolk, nor in the midst of the hospitalities en­  
joved by him, to add to what had pafici a re­  
fufal to discharge from his ships, imprefled citi­  
2ens of the United States not deried to be such,  
on th= plea that the government of the United  
States had refufed to furrendeér to the demand of  
Admiral Berkeley, certain seamen alleged to be  
Britith deserters ; a demand which it is well un­  
derflcod your government disclaims any right  
to-make. &#x27; . g  
It wopld be very fuperfincus %o d#.c&#x27;l on thy  
features which mark thisaggravated insult. . But &#x27;  
I must be perimitted to remind you, that in so se­  
rious a light &#x27; was a similar violation of neutral  
territory, by the delirution of certain French  
ships on the coast of Portugal, by a British squa­  
dron under the command of admiral Bofcawan, |  
~regarded by the court of Great Britain, thata/  
- minifler extraordinary was dispatched for the ex/  
_prefs purpose of expiating the aggreflion on thé¢  
sovereignty of a friendly power. , |  
Lastly presents itfeif, the attack by the Britilh  
ship of war Leopard, on the American frigate  
~ Chesapeake ; a case too familiarin all its circum­  
stances to need a recital of any part of them, It  
is fufficient to remark that the conclusive evi.  
dence which this event added to that which had  
preceded, of the uncontrollad excefles of the Bri.  
tith naval commanders, in infalting our sover­  
eignty, and abusing otr hospitality, determined  
the President to extend to all British armed ships,  
the precaution heretofore applied to a few by  
name, of interdi®ing to them the use and ptiwi.  
leges of our harbors and waters. ;  
This was done by his proclamation of July 2,  
1807, referring to the series of occurrences, end­  
ing with the aggreflion on the frigate Chela­  
peake, as the considerations requiring it. And  
if the apprechenfion from the licentious spirit of  
the Britith naval commanders,-thus developed  
and uacontroiled, which led to this mealure of  
precawiion, could need other juftification than  
was afforded by what had -passed, it would be  
amply foand in the subsequent condo@ of the  
ships uader the command of the {ame captain  
Douglass. -  
This officer neither admonished by reflz@ions  
“on the crisis produced by the attack on the Chefl­  
apezke, nor controlled by refoe&amp; for the jaw of  
nations, or the laws of the land, did not cease  
within our waters 3o bring to, by firing at vessels  
puxfuin%ytheir regular course of trade ; and in -  
the fame spirit which had displayed itfeif in the  
“ recent outrage committed on the American fri­  
gate, he not only indulged himfelf in hoflile  
threats, and indications of a hostile approach to  
Noifolk, but a&amp;ually obfiru&amp;ed our citizens in  
the ordinary communication between that apd  
the neighboring places. His proceedings conlti­  
tuted in salt, a blockade of the port, and as real  
an invasion of the country, according to the ex­  
tent of his force, as if troops had been debarked,  
and the town belieged on the land fide. |  
~ Was it possible for the chief magifirate of a  
~nation, who felt for its rights and its honor, te  
do less than interpose some measure of precau­  
tion at leaflt againit the repetition of &amp;normities  
whi¢ch had been so long uncontrolled by the go­  
- vernment whose officers had commiited them,  
- and which had at lust taken the exorbitant shape  
of hoftilicy and of insult seen in the attack on the  
i frigate Chesapeake ? Candor will pronounce that  
| less could not be doné ; and it will as readily ad­  
‘mit that the proclamation comprising that mea­  
l {ure, could not have breathed a more remperate  
{pirit, nor {poken in a more becoming tone.—  
&#x27; How far it hasreceived from those whose intru­  
| fions it prohibited, the relpe@ due to the nation­  
| al authority, or been made the occasion of new  
indignities; needs no explanation.  
Tite Preficent having interposed this precaun­  
tionary interdi&amp;, loft no time in infiru&amp;ing the  
‘mipifter plenipotentiary of the United States to  
repiefent to the Britifb government the signal  
aggression which had been committed on their  
sovereignty and their flag, and to require&#x27;the {at­  
isfaltion due for it ; indulging the expedation,  
that bis Britannic majesty would at once per­  
| ceive it to.be the truelt magoanimity, as well as  
the ftrictell jultice, to offer that prompt and fuil  
expiation of an acknowledged wrong, which  
l would re-eftabljfh and improve both in fa and  
in feeling the state of things which it had violated.  
This expe@ation was considered as not only  
honorable to the feéntiments of his majesty, but  
. was supported by known examples, in which, be­  
- ing the complaining party, he had required and  
I obtained, as a preliminary to any counter com­  
‘plaints whatéver, a precise replacement of things,  
i every pralicable circumstance, in their pre­

St Domm?,} wd Jamaica. A gm,‘;m;_agce with  
che whole .4 dis demand was therefule.  
Agani g the year 1989, certain Englifi  
meichantg RK%ing opened a trade at Nootka  
Sound, on tﬁib‘ikmjth wail coalt of America, and  
attempted 4 f mlement ar thai plaée 1 the Span.

?’v‘f’ﬂ&quot; s v eleve propert;, difparched a  
-ets it R IMGG el 1t o e g  
- English veifels engugedin the trade, and broke  
up the settlement on the coak. The Spanith  
goverpment was the fizlt to complain, in this  
case, of the intrusions committed by the Britith  
&#x27; mierchants. The Brh;}’h government, however,  
demanded that the vefi\is taken by the Sparifh  
frigate should be rc—:ﬁe&amp;g‘d, and adegoate fatif­  
faltion granted, previqui\sa any other difeuffiom.  
This demand prevailed ; the Spaniih govern.  
ment agreeing to make full restoration of the  
capiured vessels, and to jndemnify the parties  
interclied in them for the k\ﬂls [uftained. ‘They  
‘reftored also the buildingsand tra&amp;s of land, of  
which the British fhi*.-ja.wfts’k;;td been dipofl=ffed.  
The Britith, bewever, {ooy gave a proof of the  
little value thev set on ﬂ)i poffcffion, by 4 vol­  
untary dereliction, under which it has {ince re­  
mained. ;  
&quot;The case which will be hoted IR, though of  
a date p&#x27;ior ta the cafe/of Nootka Sound, is  
that es Falklund’s 1] enfll These Hlands lie a­  
bout ene hundr 3 k-a.g;z,le?’*c:&#x27;«.ﬁ.&#x27;-ﬁ*;;rd of the ltreighs  
of Magellan. / Ihe ulgto them had been a {ub­  
j2€ét of controversy am;lg&#x27;fenra! of the mari­  
time nations_of Eurogf. From the position of  
thie Islands and other zir‘cumi’t;mces, the preten.  
fion of Spain bore anfadvantageous comparison  
with those of Lier competitors. lathe year 1970,  
the Britilh took pofffiion of Port Egmott in one  
of the flands, the Spaniards being at the time in  
pofleflion of anothef part, and protefiing againit  
a settlement by the/ Britith. The proteil being  
without eff-&amp;, fhj!; and troops were sent from  
Buenos Ayres by the governor of that place,  
which forcibly difpofleffd and drove off the Bri­  
tith fectlers, e  
&quot;The British covernment looking entirely to the  
difpofliflion by force, demanded as a {pecific  
condition of preserving harmony between the  
two courts, not only the disavowal of the Span­  
ith proceedinge. hut that the affairs of that set­  
tlement fhouid gimmediately restored to the  
precise state in which they were previous to the  
aét of difpoflcflion. The Spanish government  
made, fom:e difficulties 3 requiring particulafly a  
disavowal, on the part of Great Britain, of the  
condné of her cfficer at Falkland’s Islands,  
which, it was alledged, gave occasion to the  
steps t:ken by the Spanish governor 5 and pro­  
posing an adjulimept by mutual (ipulation in  
the ordinary form. : ,  
The reply was, that the moderation of his  
Britangic - majctty having lisfited his demand  
to the finapicit reparation he could accept for  
the injuiy done, nothing was left for difcuilion  
but the mode of carrying the disavowal and refl:  
titution into gxecution ; reparation lifing its  
value i/ it be conditisnal, and (0 be obtained by  
any @Qipnlation whatever from the party injured.  
The Spanith government yielded. The vio­  
lent proceedings of its officers were disavowed.  
The fort, the port, and every thingflfe were  
agreed to be immediately refltored to the precise  
situation which had been disturbed ; and dupli­  
cates of orders issued for the purpose to the  
Spanith officérs, were delivered into the hands of  
‘one of the British principal secretaries of state.  
- Here again it is to beremarked, that {atisfaction -  
having beeu made for the forcible difpoflifiion,  
the islands loft their importance in the eyes of  
the Britith government; were in a short time  
_evacuated, and Port Egmont remains with ev­  
ery other part of them, in the hands of Spain.  
Could fironger pledges have been given, than  
are here found, than an honorable and instant  
reparation would be made in-a case, differing no  
otherwise from those recited, than as it surni4h­  
ed to the fame monarch of a great natipn, an op­  
~portunity to prove, that adbering always to the  
fame immutable principle, he was as readyto do  
right to others, as to require it for himfelf ?  
&lt; Returning to the inllruétions given to the  
-minilier plgnipotentiary of the United States at  
&quot; London, ?ﬁ‘m ‘to observe that the President  
thought if jult and expedient to insert as a ne­  
_ceffary ingredient in the adjustment of the out­  
_rage committed on the American frigate, 2 se­  
curity against the future praétice of the Britifh­

The claim of a belligerent to search for, and

relt on any brlligerent right under the law of

er and more extensive source of danger tothe

his persuasion, that the liberality of the propo­  
{itions authorized wit¥ this view, would nog  
fail to nduce the ready congurrence of bis Bri.  
tannic: majesty ; and that the more extensive  
source of irritdtion and perplexity being remove.  
ed, a fatisfaltory adjultment of the particular  
incident would be the less difficult. The Prefi.  
dent still thinks that such would have, been the  
tendency of the mode for which he had provi.  
ded ; and he cannot, therefore, but regret that  
the door was shut against the experiment, by  
the peremptory refufal of Mr. Czanning to ad­  
mit it into discussion, even in the most informal  
manner, as was suggested by Mr. Monroe.  
The President feit the greater regret, as the  
step he had taken towards a more enlarged and  
lasting accommodation, became thus a bar to  
the acdjultment of the particular and rzcent age  
greflion which had been committed against the  
«Uuited States. He found, however, an allevias  
tion in the fignified purpcfe of his Britannic  
~maj=lty, to charge with this acjultment a special  
i m%‘fﬁim to the UJ. States. which, reftrited as it  
- was, seemed to indicate a disposition from which a  
{ liberal and conciliatory arrangement of one great  
- objeét at lealt might be confidently cxpeé’teg.  
{ In this confidence, your arrival was awaited  
- with every friendly solicitude ; and our firft inter­  
| view having opened the way by an acquiescence  
{ in the separation of the two cases infitted on by  
- his Britannic maje{ty, noiwithftanding the firong  
| orounds on which they had been united by the  
i Prelident, it was not to be doubted that a tene  
- der of ihe fatisfaction claimed by Ihe UU. States  
for a diftingnifhed and an acknowledged insult by  
one of his officers, would immediately follow.  
It was not, therefore, without a very painful,  
| furprize that the ertor of this expe®ation was  
| discovered. Instead of the fatisfa@ion due from  
the original aggreflor, it was announced that  
i the firlt kep towards the adjnftment must pro­  
. ceed from the party igjured 3 and your letter  
x now before me, formally repeatsgthat as long  
as the proclamation of the Preﬁc!nt, which he  
issued on the 2d July, 18c7, shall be in force, 1t  
will be an insuperable obflacle to a negociation,  
even on the fubje@ of the aggreflion which pre­  
| ceded it 3 in other words, that the proclamation  
| must be put out of force before ah” adjnfkment  
&#x27; of the aggreflion can be taken into difcuflien.  
&#x27; In explaining the grounds of this extraordina.  
ry demand, it is alledged to be supported by  
the consideration that the proceeding and pre­  
&#x27; tension of the offending cofficer has been difa­  
- vowed ; that general aflurances are given of a  
&#x27; disposition and intention in his Pritannic majesty  
to make fatisfaction 3 thata special minister was  
dispatched with promptitude, for the purpofs  
of caraying into effe&amp; thie disposition ; and that  
you have a personal conviion that the partic­  
ular terms, which you are not at liberty previ­  
ously to disclose, will be deemed by*e United  
States fatisfallory. Bt \
. With refpe@ to the disavowal it would be  
unjult not to regard it as a proof of candor and  
amity towards the United States, and‘as some  
~ presage of the voluntary reparation which it  
~implied to be due. . But thedifavowal can be  
. the less confounided with the reparation itfelf 3

menced it in such a manner, and in the midk of  
exilting profeflions of peace and friendfhip. She  
- owed it also to confiltency with the disavowal  
on a former occasion in which the pretension  
- had been enforced by a Britith iquadron againt

his pacific views towards them, and of  
his refpe@ for their friendfhip. But  
whillt they couldsnot, under any cir.  
cumftapces, allow to the measure more  
than a certain participation in an hon­  
orable reparation, it is to be.recolle&amp;-  
ed that the avowed and primary ob­  
je&amp; of the mission was to fubltitute for  
the more extended adjultment pro­  
‘pofed by the U. S. at London, a fepa­  
yation of the fubjeds as preferred by  
his Britannic majesty, and you well  
know, fir, how fully this obje&amp;t was  
accomplished.  
With lefpe@ to the personal con­  
vi&amp;ion which you have exprefled, that  
the terms which you decline to dis­  
close would be fatisfa&amp;ory 1o the U.

serve that with the highelt refpe&amp; for  
your judgment and the most perfe&amp;  
confidence in your sincerity, an insu­  
perable obje&amp;ion manifeltly lies, to the  
acceptance of a personal and unex­  
plained opinion, in place of a diiclo­  
fure which would enable this govern.  
ment to exercise its own judgment in  
a case affeéting so eflentially its honor  
and its rights. Such a course of pro­  
ceeding would be without example 3  
and there can be no hazard in faying  
that oné will never be afforded by a  
overnment which gefpe@s itfelf as  
&amp;uch ay yours jultly does ; and there­  
fore can never be reasonably expeéted  
from one which refpe&amp;s itfelf as much  
as this has a rightto do. -  
I forbear, fir, to enlarge on the in­  
trinsic incongruity of the -expedient  
proposed. But I must be allowed to  
remark, as an additional admonition  
of the singular and mortifying per­  
plexity in which a compliance might  
involve the President, that there are  
in the letter of Mr. Canning, commu­  
picating to Mr. Monroe the special  
miflion to the U. S. pregnant indica­  
tions that other queltions and condi­  
tions may have bezn Tomtemplated  
which would be found utterly irrecon­  
cileable with the sentiments of this  
pation.  
  
If neither any nor all of these con­  
siderations can fufain the preliminary  
deman.~made in yourcommunication,  
it remains to be seen whether {uch a  
demand rests with preater advantage  
on the more precise ground on which  
you finally seem to place it.  
The proclamation is confidered“as  
a hostile measure, 2nd a discontinu­  
ance of it as due to the discontinuance  
of the aggreflion which led to it.  
It has been fufficiently thewn that  
the proclamation, as appears on the  
face of it, was produced by a train of  
occurrences terminating in the attack  
on the American frigate, and not by  
this lat alone. To a demand there­  
fore that the proclamation be revok­  
ed, it would be perfedly fair to oppose  
a demand that redress be firft given  
for the numerous irregularities which  
preceded the aggreflion onthe Amer­  
ican frigate, as well as for this partic­  
ular aggression, and that effectual con­  
trol be interposed againit repetitions  
offthem. And as no such redress has  
been given for the past, notwithstand­  
ing the lapse of time which has taken  
place, nor any {uch security for the fu­  
ture, notwithltanding the undiminish­  
ed reasonableness of it, it follows, that  
a coantinuance of the proclamation  
would be consistent with an entire dis­  
continuance of one only of the occur­  
rences from which it proceeded.  
But it is not neceflary to avail the  
argument of this view of the case, al­  
though *of itfelf entirely conclusive.  
‘Had the proclamation been founded  
on the single aggreflion committed on  
the Chesapeake, and wete it admitted  
that the discontinuance of that aggre{-  
fion ‘merely, gave a claim to the dis­

continuance of the proclamation, the  
claim would be defeated by the incon­  
teftible fa&amp;, that that aggreflion has  
not been discontinued. It has never  
ceased to exilt ; and is in existence at  
this moment. Need I remind you, fir,  
‘that the seizure and afportation of the  
seamen belonging to the crew of the  
Chesapeake, entered into the very es­  
sence of that aggreflion, that with an  
_exception of the victim to a trial for­  
biddea by the molt _,folsz%mcgnﬁdcxae  
tions, and greatly aggravaring the  
guilt of its author, the seamen in ques­  
tion are fill retained, and consequent-  
  
Iy that the aggression, if in no other  
refped, is by that a&amp; alone continued  
and in force ?  
If the views which have been taken  
of the subject have the justness which  
they. claim, they will have shewn that  
on no ground whatever can an annul­  
ment of the proclamation of July 2d,  
be reasonably required, as a prelimi­  
nary to the megociation with which  
youn are charged. On the contrary,  
it clearly results, from a recurrence to  
the causes and obje&amp; of the procla­  
‘mation, that, as was at firft intimated,  
the firongeft fanéions of G. Britain  
herfelf, would support the demand,  
that previous to a discussion of the  
proclamation, due fatisfaction should.  
be made to the U. States ;&#x27; that this  
fatisfalion ought to exrend to all the  
wrongs which preceded and produc.  
ed that a&amp; ; and that even&#x27; limiting  
the merits of the question to the sin­  
gle selation of the proclamation to  
  
‘the wrong committedin the attack on  
‘the American frigate, and deciding  
“the queflion on the principle that a  
discontinuance of the latter required  
“of right a discontinuance of the for­  
mer, nothing appears that does not.  
leave such a preliminary deltitute of  
every foundation which could be af­  
famed for it.  
With a right to draw this conclua­  
fion, the President might have in­  
firu@ed me to close this communica­  
tion, with the reply stated in the be­  
ginning of it ; and perhaps in taking  
this course, he would only have con­  
sulted a sensibility, to which most gov­  
ernments would, in such a case, have  
yielded. But adhering to the mod­  
erationr by which he has been invaria­  
bly guided, and anxious to rescue the  
two nations from the circumf@tances,  
under which an abortive issue to your  
mission, neceflarily places theri, he  
has authorized me, in the event of  
your disclosing the terms of repara­  
tion, which you believe will be fatis­  
fa&amp;ory, and on its appearing that  
they are so, to confider this evidence  
of the justice of his Britannic majelty  
as a pledge for an effetual interposi­  
tion with refpe&amp; to all the abuses a­  
gainst a recurrence of which the prog­  
lamation was meant to provide, and  
- to proceed to concert with you, a re­  
vocation of that a&amp;, bearing the fame  
date with the a&amp; of reparation to  
- which the U. States ure entitled. / -  
  
I am not unaware, fir, that acoord­  
ing to the view which you appeir to  
have taken of your nftrucions, such  
a course of proceeding has noy been  
contemplated by them. It i§ possi­  
ble nevertheless, that a re-examina­  
tion, in the spirit in which I am well  
persuaded it will be made, may dis­  
cover them to be not inflexibk to a  
proposition, in so high a degree, lib­  
eral and conciliatory. Tmevety event  
the President will have manifelted  
his willingness to meet your govern­  
ment on a grotnd of accommedation,  
which spares to its feelings, however  
misapplied he may deem then, eve­  
ry conceflion not eflentially due to  
those which must be equaltx re­  
spected : and consequently will have  
demonstrated that the very ineli§ble  
posture given to so important a kb  
je€t in the relations of the two cogn­  
tries, by the unfuccefsful terminatidn,  
of your miflion, can be referred to no  
other source, than the rigorous reﬁrii

‘** the U. States, the Chesapeake, as long as  
** the proclamation of the president of the  
  
“* 2d of July, 1807, shall be in force.” —  
  
This demand, sir, might justly suggest the  
simple answer, that before the proclamation  
  
of the president could .become a subject of  
  
consideration, satisfaction should be made for  
the acknowledged aggression which preced-  
ed it. This is evidently agreeable to the or-  
der of time, to the order of reason, and, it  
may be added, to the order of usage, as main-  
tained by G. Britain, whenever in analogous  
cases, she has been the complaining party.

—But as you have subjoined to the prelimie«  
  
| nary demand, certain explanations, witha  
  
view doubtless to obviate such an answer, it  
will best accord with the candor of the presi-  
dent, to meet them with such a review of the  
whole subject, as will present the solid  
grounds on which he regards such a demand  
as inadmissible.—I begin with the occurrene-  
es from which the proclamation of July 2d,  
resulted, These are in general terms refer-  
ed to, by the instrument itself. A more  
particular notice of the most important of  
them, will here be in place.—Passing over  
them, the habitual but minor irregularities  
of his Britannic majesty’s ships of war, in  
making the hospitalities of our ports sub-  
servient to the annoyance of our trade, both  
outward and inward, a practice not only  
contrary to the principles of public law, but  
expressly contrary to British ordinances en-  
forced during maritime wars, to which she  
bore a neutral relation, [ am constrained,  
unwelcome as the task is, to call your atten-  
tion to the following more prominent in-  
stances :—In the summer of 1804, the Bri-  
tish frigate the Cambrian, with other cruizers  
in company, entered the harbour of New  
York. The commander, capt. Bradley, in  
violation of the port laws, relating both ta  
health and revenue, caused a merchant vessel,  
just arrived, and confessedly within the limits  
and under the authority of the U, States, ta  
be boarded by persons under his command,  
who, after resisting the officers of the port,  
in the legal exercise of their functions, actu-  
ally impressed and carried off a number of  
seamen and passengers into the service of the  
ships of war, On an appeal to bis voluntary  
respect for the laws, he first failed to give up  
the offender to justice, and finally repelled  
the officer charged with the regular process  
for the purpose.—This procedure was not  
only a flagrant insult to the sovereignty ot  
the nation, but an infraction of its neutrality  
also, which did not permit a belligerent ship  
thus to augment its force within the neutzal  
territory.—To finish the scene, this com-  
mander went so far as to declare, in an Offs  
cial letter, to the minister plenipotentiary of  
his Britannic majesty, and by him commu-  
nicated to this government, that he consider-  
ed his ship, whilst lying in the harbour of  
New York, as having dominion around her,  
within the distance of her bauoys.—AIl these  
circamstances were duly made known to the  
British government in just expectation of  
honorable reparation. None has ever been  
offered, Capt. Bradley was advanced from  
his frigate to the command of a ship of the  
line.—At a subsequent period, several British  
frigates under the command of capt. Whitby,

the precaution heretofore applied toa few by  
name, of interdicting to them the use and  
privileges of our harbours and waters.—  
This was done by his prociametion of July  
2, 1807, referring tothe series of occurren-  
ces, ending with the aggression on the frigate  
Chesapeake, as the considerations requiring  
it. And if the apprehension from the hi-  
centious spirit of the British naval comman-  
  
| ders, thus developed and uncontrolled, which  
| led to this measure of precaution, co: ld  
&#x27; need other justification than was afforded  
  
| by what had passed, it would be amply found  
  
it! the subsequent conduct of the ships under  
the command of the same captain Dou-  
  
| glas.——This officer, neither admonished  
  
of this country at such a result—A case of |  
| the attack on the Chesapeake, nor cone  
  
another character occurred in Sept. 1806.  
  
The Impetueux, a French ship of 74 guns, |  
  
when aground within a few hundred yards of  
the shore of North Carolina, and therefore  
visibly within the territorial jurisdiction and  
hospitable protection of the U. States, was  
fired upon, boarded, and burat, from three  
British ships of war under the command of  
capt. Douglas, Having completed this out-  
ragé on the sovereignty and neutrality of the  
U. States, the British commander felt no  
  
scruple in proceeding thence, into the waters |  
  
near Norfolk, nor ia the midst of the hospita-  
lities enjoyed by him, to add to «hat had  
passed, a refusal to discharge from his ships,  
impressed citizens of the U. States, not de-  
nied to be such, on the plea, that the go-  
vernment of the U. States had refused to  
surrender to the demand of admiral Berkley,  
certain seamen alledged to be British desert-  
ers; a demand which it is well understood,  
your government disclaims any right to make.  
—It would be very superfluous to dwell on  
the features which mark this aggravated in-  
  
  
  
sult, But I must be permitted to remind  
  
m, that in so serious a light was a similar  
violation of neutral territory, by the destruc.  
tion of certain French ships on the coast of  
Portugal, by a British squadron under the  
command of admiral Boscawen, regarded by  
  
  
  
the court of G. Britain that a migister ex- |  
  
by reflexions on the crisis produced by  
  
trolled by respect for the law of nations  
or the laws of the land, did not cease within  
our waters to bring to, by firing at vessels  
pursuing their course of trade; and in the  
same spirit which had displayed itself in the  
recent outrage committed upon the Ameri-  
can fiigate, he not only indulged himself in  
hostile threats, and indications of a hostile  
approach to Norfolk, but actually obstructed  
our citizens in the ordinary communication  
bet ween that and neighbouring places. His  
proceedings constituted in fact, a blockade  
of the port, and as real an invasion of the  
country, according to the extent of his force,  
as if troops had been debarked, and the  
town besieged on the land side.—Was it  
possible for the chief magistrate of a nation,  
who felt for its rights and its honour, to do  
less than interpose some measure of precatl-  
tion, at least against the repetition of enormi=  
ties which had been so long uncontrolled by  
the government whose. officers had com-  
mitted them, and which had at last takea  
the exorbitant shape of hostility and of in-  
sult seen in the attack on the frigate Chesa-  
peake? Candor will pronounce that less  
could not be done ; and it will as readily ad-  
mit that the proclamation comprising that  
measure, could nov have breathed a more  
teyaperate spirit, nor spoken in a moe bee

coming tone. How far it has received  
from those, whose intrusions it prohibited,  
the respect due to the national authority, or  
been made the occasion of new indignities,  
needs no explanation. —The president having  
interposed this precautivnary interdict, lost  
no tinae in instructing the minister plenipo-  
tentiary of the U. States to represent to the  
British government the signal aggression  
which had been committed on their sove-  
reignty and their flag, and to reqnire the  
satisfaction due for it ; indulging the expec-  
tation that his Britannic majesty would at  
once perceive it to be the truest magnanimity,  
as well as the strictest justice, to offer that  
prompt and full expiation of an acknow-  
ledged wrong which would re-establish and  
improve, both in fact and in feeling, the  
state of things which it had violated.—This  
expectation was considered as not only ho-  
nourable to the sentiments of his majesty,  
but was supported by known examples, in  
which, being the complaining party, he had  
required and obtained, asapreliminary to  
any counter complaints whatever, a precise  
replacement of things, in every practicable  
circumstance, in their pre-existing situation.  
—Thus in 1764, Bermudians and other  
British subjects, who had according to an-  
nual custom take possession of Turk’s  
island for the season of making salt, having  
been forcibly removed with their vessels and  
etfects by a French detachment from the  
island of St. Domingo, to which Turk’s  
island was alledged to be an appurtenance,  
the British ambassador at Paris in pursuance  
of instructions from his government, de-  
manded asa satisfaction for the violence com-  
_ mitted, that the preceedings should be dis-  
avowed, the intention of acquiring Turk’s  
island disclaimed, orders given for the im-  
mediate abandonment of it on the part of  
the French, every thing restored to the con-  
dition in which it was at the time of the ag-  
gression, and rep2ration made of the dama-  
ges which any British subjects should be  
found to have sustained according to an es-  
timation to be settled between the g-vernors  
of St. Domingo and Jamaica. A compliance  
with the whole of this demand was the re-  
sult—Again in 1789, certain English  
merchants having openeda trade at Nootka  
Sound, on the north west coast of America,  
and attempted a settlement at that place,  
the Spaniards, who had long claimed that  
part of the world as their exelusive property,  
dispatched a frigate from Mexico, which  
captured the two English vessels engaged iu  
the trade, and broke up the settlement on the  
coast.—The Spanish goverament was the  
first to complain, in this case, of the in

trusions committed by the British merchants’  
  
The British government, however, de-  
manded that the vessels taken by the Spanish  
frigate, should be restored, and adequate sa-  
tisfaction granted previous to any other dis-  
cussion. — This demand prevailed ; the Spanish  
government agreeing to make full restoration  
of the captured vessels, and to indemnify the  
parties interested in them for the losses sustain-  
ed. ‘They restored also the buildings and tracts  
of land, of which the British subjects had  
been dispossessed, The British however,  
soon gave proof of the little value they set  
on the possession, by a voluntary dereliction,  
under which it has since remained.—The  
case which will be noted last, though of a  
date prior to the case of Nootka Sound, is  
These islands lie  
about 100 leagues eastward of the Streights  
of Magellan. ‘The title of them had been  
a subject of controversy among several of  
the maritime nationsof Europe. From the  
position of the islands, and other circume  
stances, the pretension of Spain bore an  
advantageous comparison with those of her  
competitors.—In 1770, the British took  
possession of Port Egmont, in one of the  
islands, the Spaniards being at that time  
in possession of another part, and pro-  
testing against a settlement by the Bri-  
tish. The protest being without effect,  
ships, and troops were sent from Bu-  
enos Ayres, by the governor of tha}  
place, which forcibly dispossessed and  
drove off the British settlers.——The Bri-  
tish government looking entirely to the  
dispessession by force, demanded as a spe-  
cific condition of preserving harmony bee  
tween the two courts, not only the disavowe  
al of the Spanish proceedings; but that the  
aftuirs of that settlement should be imme-  
diately restored to the precise state in which  
they were previous to the act of disposses-  
sion, The Spanish government made some  
difficulties ; requiring particularly a disae  
vowal on the part of G. Britain, of the con-  
duct of her officer, at Falkland&#x27;s Islands,  
which, it was alledged, gave occasion to the  
steps taken by the Spanish governor; and  
proposing an adjustment by mutual stipulae  
tions in the ordinary form, ‘Lhe reply  
was, that the moderation of his Britannic  
majesty having limited his demand to the  
smailest reparation he could accept for the  
injury done, nothing was left for discussion  
but the mode of carrying the disavowal and  
restitution into execution ; reparation losing  
its value if it be conditional, and to be obe  
tained by any stipulation whatever from the  
party injured, The Spanish government  
yielded. The violent proceedings of its o

ficers were disavowed. The fort, the port,  
and every thing else were agreed to be im-  
mediately restored to the precise situation  
which had been disturbed ; and duplicates  
of orders issued for the purpose to the Spa-  
nish officers, were delivered into the hands  
of one of the British principal secretaries of  
state. Here again it is to be remarked, that  
satisfaction having been made for the forci-  
ble dispossession, the islands lost their im-  
portance in the eyes of the British govera-  
ment, were in a short time finally evacuat-  
ed, and Port Egmcnt remains with every  
other part of them in the hands of Spain.—  
Could stronger pledges have been given,  
than are here found, that an honorable and  
instant reparation would be made in a case,  
differing no otherwise from those recited,  
than as it furnished to the same monarch of  
a great nation, an opportunity to prove, that  
adhering always to the same immutable prin-  
ciple, he was as ready to do right to others,-  
as to require it for himself. Returning  
to the instructions given tothe minister ple-  
nipotentiary of the United States at London,  
I am to observe, that the president thought  
it just and expedient to insert, asa necessary  
ingredient in the adjustment of the outrage  
committed on the American frigate, a secu-  
rity against the future practice of British  
naval commanders, in impressing from mer-  
chant vessels of the U. States on the high  
seas, such of their crews as they might un-  
dertake to denominate British subjects. ———  
To this association of the two subjects, the  
president was determined, Ist. by his re-  
garding both as resting on kindred principles,  
the immunity of private ships, with the  
Known exceptions made by the law of na-  
tions, being ‘as well established as that of  
pablic ships; and there being no pretext  
for including in these exceptions the im-  
pressment (if it could be freed from its  
‘egormous and notorious abuses) of the sub-  
jects of a belligerent, by the officers of that  
belligerent. The rights of a belligerent,  
‘against the ships of a neutral nation, accrue  
imérely from the relation of the neutral to  
the other belligerent, as in conveying to  
him contraband of war, or in supplying a  
dlockaded port. ‘The claim of a bellige- |  
Tetit to search for and seize on board neutral |  
‘vessels on the high seas, persons under his |  
allegiance, does not therefore rest on any  
belligerent right under the law of nations,  
but on a prerogative derived from municipal |  
daw ; and involves the extravagant supposi-  
tion, that one ‘nation has a right to execute  
ft all times andin all cases, its municipal |  
laws and regulations, on board the ships of  
other nation, net being within its terri-  
.

torial limits.  
the same determination, 2dly. by his desire  
of converting a particular incident, into an  
occasion for removing another and more ex-  
tensive source of danger to the harmony of  
the two countries: and, 3dly, by his pers  
suasion that the liberality of the proposi-  
tions authorised with this view, would not  
fail to induce the ready concurrence of his  
Britannic majesty ; and that the more ex.  
tensive source of irritation and perplexity  
being removed, a satisfactory adjustment of  
the particular incident would be the less dif-  
ficult. The president still thinks that such  
would have been the tendency of the mode  
for which he had provided ; and he cannot  
therefore but regret that the door was shut  
against the experiment, by the peremptory  
refusal of Mr. Canning to admit it into  
discussion, even in the most informal man-  
ner, as was suggested by Mr. Munroe.——.  
The president felt the greater regret, as the  
step he had taken towards a more enlarged  
and Jasting accommodation became thus a  
bar to the adjustment of the particular and  
recent aggression which had been committed  
against the U. States. He found however  
an alleviation, in the signified purpose of  
his Britannic majesty, to charge with this  
adjustment a special mission tothe U. States,  
| which, restricted as it was, seemed to in-  
| dicate a disposition from which a liberal and  
conciliatory arrangement of one great ob-  
ject at least might be confidently expected.  
In this confidence, your atrival was  
awaited with every friendly solicitude ; and  
| our first interview having opened the way,  
_ by an acquiescence in the separation of the  
&#x27; two cases insisted on by his Britannic ma-  
jesty, notwithstanding the strong ground on  
| which they had been united by the presi-  
| dent, it was not to be doubted that a tender  
| of the satisfaction claimed by the U. States,  
| for a distinguished and an acknowledged in-  
sult, by one of his officers, would imme-  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
diately follow.—It was not, therefore,  
_withov. a very painful surprize, that the  
error of this expectation was discovered.  
  
Instead of the satisfaction due from the  
original aggression, it was announced that  
the first ‘step towards the adjustment must  
proceed from the party injured; and yout  
  
| letter now before me, formally repeats, that  
  
as long as the proclamation of the president,  
  
| which issued on the 2d July, 1807, shall  
  
be in force, it will be‘an insuperable obsta-  
cle toa negociation, even on the subject  
  
| the aggression which preceded it ; in other  
  
words, that the proclamation mast be put  
  
_ Out of force, before an adjustment of the  
  
aggression can be taken into discussion.

In explaining the grounds of this extraor-  
dinary demand, it is alledged to be support-  
ed by the consideration that the proceeding  
and pretension of the offending officer has  
been disavowed : that general assurances are  
given of a disposition and intention in his  
Britannic majesty to make satisfaction ; that  
a special minister was dispatched with  
promptitude for the purpose of carrying into  
effect this disposition : and that you have a  
personal conviction that the particular terms,  
which you are not at liberty previously to  
disclose, will be deemed by the U. States  
satisfactory —-—-With respect to the dis-  
avowal, it would be unjust not to regard it  
as a proof of candour and amity towards  
the U, States, and as some presage ‘of the  
voluntary reparation which it implied to be  
due. Bat thedisavowal can be the less con-  
founded with the reparation itself; since it  
was sufficiently required by the respect  
which G. Britain owed to her own honour ;  
it being impossible that an enlightened go-  
vernment, had hostility been» meditated,  
would have commenced it in such a manner  
  
and inthe midst of existing professions of  
  
peace and friendship. She owed it also to  
consistency with a disavowal on a former  
occasion, in which the pretension had been  
  
enforced by a British squadrou, against the

sloop of war Baltimore, belonging to ¢he |  
  
U. States ; and finally to the interest which  
G. Britain has, more than any other nation,  
in disclaiming a principle which would ex-  
pose her ‘superior number of ships of war,  
to so many indignities from inferior navies.  
As little can the general assurances that  
reparation would be made, claim a return  
which could properly follow the actual re-  
paration only. They cannot amount to more  
than a disposition, or at most a promise, to  
do what the aggressor miay deem a fulfil-  
ment of his obligation. They do not prove  
even a disposition todo what may be satis-  
factory to the injnred party, who cannot  
have less thau an equal right to decide on  
the sufficiency of the redress——In dis.  
patching a special minister for the purpose  
of adjusting the differences, the U. States  
ought cheerfully to acknowledge all the proof  
it affords on the part of his Britannic ma-  
jesty, of his pacific views towards them, and  
of his respect for their friendship. But  
whilst they could not, under any circum-  
stances, allow to the measure more than  
  
certain participation in an honourable re-  
pafation, it is to be recollected that the  
  
  
  
avowed and primary object of the mission  
Was to substitute forthe more extended ad-  
justment proposed by the U. States, at Lon-  
don, a separation of the subjects as preferred |  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
[953  
by his Britannic majesty ; and you well know  
Sir, how fully this object was accomplished.  
  
—— With respect to the personal conviction  
which you have expressed, that the terms  
which you decline to disclose, would be sa-  
tisfactory to the U. States, it is incumbent  
on me to observe, that with the higliest re-  
spect for your judgment, and the most per-  
fect confidence in your sinceri ity, an insepa-  
rable objection manifestly lies, to the ae-  
ceptance of a personal and unexplained. opi-  
nion, in nlace of adisclosure which would  
enable this government to exercise its own  
judgment in a case affecting so essentially its  
honour and its rights. Such a course of pro-  
ceeding would be without example; and  
there can be no hazard in saying, that one  
will never be afferded by a government  
which respects itself as much as yours justly  
does ; and therefore can never be reasonably  
expected from one which respects itself as  
much as this has a right to do. I forbear,  
  
Sir, to enlarge on the intrinsic incongruity  
of the ex pedient proposed,— But I must be  
allowed to remark, as an additional adinoni-  
tion of the singular and mortifying per-  
plexity in which a compliance might involve  
the president, that there are in the fletrer of  
Mr. Canning, communicating to Mr. Mune  
roe, the spe cial mission to the U. Seates,  
pregnant indications that other questions and  
conditions may have been contemplated,  
  
which would be found utterly irreconcilea-  
ble with the sentiments of this nation. -——  
If neither any. nor all of these considera-  
tions can sustain the preliminary demand  
made in your communication, it remains to  
be seen whether such a demand rests with  
greater advantage on the more precise  
ground on which you finally seem to place  
  
it. The proclamation is considered as a  
hostile measure, and a discontinuance of it,  
as due to the discontinuance of the aggres-  
sion which led to it.——It has been suffi-  
ciently shewn that the preclamation, as ap-  
pears on the face of it, was produced by a  
train of occurrences terminating in the at-  
tack on the “American: frigate, and not by  
this last alone. To a demand, therefote,  
that the proclamation be revoked, it would  
be perfectly fair to oppose a demand that  
redress be first given for the numerous ir-  
regularities which preceded the aggression  
on the American frigate, as well as for this  
particular aggression, and that effectual con-  
troul ‘be interposea aghinst repetitions of  
them. “And as no such redress has been  
given for the past, not withstanding the lapse  
of time which has taken place, nor any  
such security for the future, notwithstand-  
ing the undiminished reasonableétiess ‘of it,

portation of the seamen belonging to the |  
  
crew of the Chesapeake, entered into the  
very essence of that aggression ; that with  
an exception of the victim to a trial, for-  
bidden by the most solemn considerations,  
and greatly aggravating the guilt of its au-  
thor, the seamen in question are still re-  
tained, and consequently that the aggres-  
sion, if in no other respect, is by that act  
alone continued and in force ? If the  
views which have been taken of the subject  
have the justness which they claim, they  
will have shewn that on no ground what-  
ever can an annulment of the proclamation  
of July 2d be reasonably required, as a pre-  
. liminary to the negociation with which you  
are charged. On thecontrary, it clearly re-  
suits, from a recurrence to the causes and  
object of the proclamation, that, as was at  
first intimated, the strongest sanctions of G.  
Eritain herself would support the demand,  
that previous toa discussion of the procla-  
mation, due satisfaction should be made to  
the U. States; that this satisfaction ought to  
extend to all the wrongs which preceded and  
produced that act; and that even limiting  
the merits of the question to the single re-  
lation of the proclamation to the wrong  
committed inthe attack on the American  
frigate, and deciding the question on the  
principle that a discontinuance of the latter,  
required of right a discontinuance of the  
former, nothing appears that does not leave  
such a preliminary destitute of every foun-  
dation which could be assumed for it.  
With a right to draw this conclusion, the  
president might have instructed me to close  
this communication, with the reply stated  
in the beginning of it; aud perbaps in tak-  
ing this course, he would only have con-  
sulted a sensibility, to which most govern-  
menis would, in such a case, have yielded,

dent had indulged &quot; the expectation,  
that his Britaindc majesty would at  
once perceive it to be the truest mag­  
nanimity, as well as the strictest jus­  
tice, to oiler that prompt and full ex­  
piation of an acknowledged wrong,  
Which would re-establish and improve  
both in fact and in feeling, the state  
jot things which it had violated.  
&quot; This expectation was considered,  
as hot only honorable to the sentiments  
of his majesty, but was supported by­  
known examples, in which being the  
complaining party, he had required  
and obtained, as a preliminary to any  
counter complaints whatever, a pre­  
cise replacement of things, in every  
practicable circumstance, ift their  
pre-existing situation.  
&quot; Thus in the year 1764, Bermu­  
dians and other British subjects, who  
had according to annual custom, taken  
.-.ssion of Turk&#x27;s Island, for the  
season of making salt, having been  
forcibly removed with their vessels  
and effects by a French detachment  
from the island of St. Domingo, to  
  
which Turks island was alleged to be |  
an appurtenance, the British ambas- J  
sador at Paris, in pursuance of instruc­  
tions from his government, demand­  
ed, as a satisfaction for the violence  
committed, that the proceedings  
should be disavowed, the intention of  
acquiring Turk&#x27;s Island disclaimed,  
orders given for the immediate aban­  
donment of it »m the part of the  
French, every thing restored to the  
condition in which it was at the time  
of the aggression, and reparation  
made of the damages which any Bri­  
tish subjects should oc found to have  
sustained, according to an estimation  
to be settled between the Governors of  
St. Domingo and Jamaica. A com­  
pliance with the whole of this demand  
was the result.

. look possession of Port  
~ in one of the islands, the  
Lards being at the time in posses­  
of another part and protesting  
against a settlement by the British.  
The protest being without effect, ships  
and troops were sent from Buenos  
Ayres by the governor of that place,  
which forcibly dispossessed and drove  
off the British settlers.  
&quot; The British government looking  
entirely to the dispossession by force,  
demanded as a specific condition of  
preserving harmony between the two  
courts, not only the disavowal of the  
Spanish proceedings, but that the  
affairs of that settlement should be  
immediately restored to the precise  
state in which they were previous to  
the act of dispossession—the Spanish  
government made some difficulties ;  
requiring particularly a disavowal, on  
the pari ol Great Britain, ofthe con­  
duct of her officer at Falkland&#x27;s islands,  
which it was alleged gave occasion to  
the steps taken by the Spanish gover­  
nor ; and proposing an adjustment by  
mutual stipulations in the ordinary  
form.  
&quot; The reply was, that the modera- I  
tion of his Britannic majesty having j  
limited his demand to the smallest re- j  
paration he would accept for the injury I  
done, nothing was left for discussion !  
but the mode of carrying the disavow­  
al and restitution into execution ; re­  
paration losing its value if it be condi­  
tional, and to be obtained by any stipu­  
lation whatever from the party in­  
jured.  
&quot; The Spanish government yielded.  
The violent proceedings of its officers  
were disavowed. The fort, the pert  
and every thing els,e were agreed to i  
be immediately restored to the pre- j  
cisc situation which had been disturb- &#x27;  
ed ; and duplicates of orders issued &#x27;  
for the purpose to the Spanish officers,  
were delivered into the hands of one  
ot the British principal Secretaries of j  
State. Here again it is to be remark­  
ed, that satisfaction having been made ■  
! for the forcible dispossession, the is- j  
lands lost their importance in the eyes  
of the British government, were in a  
short time evacuated, and port Eg­  
mont remains with every other part of  
j them in the hands of Spain.

« To this association of the two sub- &#x27;  
ieets, the President was determined, &#x27;  
Ist. by his regarding both as resting  
on kindred principles ; the immunity *  
of private ships, with the known ex- *  
ceplions made by the law of nations, !  
being as well established as to

tho impressment (if il could be freed  
. its enormous and notorious  
abuses) of the subjects of a belligerent

ly from the relation of the neutral lo |

ol war, or in supplying a b

rest on any belligerent 1 ight under the

before the president, your letter of the 26th Janua-  
ry. inWhich you state that you are ‘‘ expressly  
precluded by your instructions from entering upon  
any negociation for the adjustment of the differences  
arising from the encounter of his Britannic majes-  
ty’s ship Leopard, and the frigate of the United  
States, the Chesapeake, as long as_ the proclama-  
tion of the president of the 2d of July, 1807, shall  
continue in force.” &#x27;  
  
This demand, sir, might justly suggest the sim-  
ple answer, that before the proclamation of the  
President could become a subject of consideration,  
satisfaction should be made for the acknowledged  
aggression which preceded it. This is evidently  
agrceebly to the order of time, to the order of rea-  
son, and if it may be added, to the order of usage,  
as maintained by Great Britain, whenever in analo-  
  
us cases, she has been the complaing party.  
  
But as you have subjoined to the preliminary  
demand, certain explanations, with a view doubtless  
to obviate such an answer, it will best accord with  
the candor of the pres:dent, to meet them with  
such areview of the whole subject as will preseut  
solid grounds on which he regards such a demand  
  
“@s inadmissible.  
  
I begin with the occurrences from which the  
proclamation of July 2d, resulted.  
  
them will here be in place.  
  
Passing over then, the habitual but minor irregu-  
daritics ofhis Britannic majesty’s ships of war, in  
meking the hospita&#x27;ities ofour ports subservient to  
the annoyance of our trade,both inward and outward,  
a practice not only contrary to the principles of pub-  
lic law, but expressiy contrary to British ordinan-  
cesenforced during maritime wars, to which she  
bore a neutral relation ; I am constrained, unwel-  
come as the task 1s, to call your attention to the fol-  
lowing more prominent instances.  
  
In the summer of the year 1804, the British fri-  
gate, the Cambrian, with other cruisers in compa-  
ny,entered the Harbor of New-York. The comman-  
der, captain Bradley, in violation of the port laws,  
relating both to health and revenue. caused a mer-  
chant vessel just arrived, and confessedly within  
the limits and under the authority of the United  
States, to be boarded by persons under his com-  
mand, who, after resisting the officers of the port,  
mm the legal exerc:se of their functions, actually im-  
pressed and carried off anumber of seamen and  
passengers into the service of the ships of war. On  
an appeal te his voluntary pe eg to the laws,  
he first failed to give up the offenders to justice,  
and finally repelled the officer charged with the  
regular process for this purpose.  
  
This procedure was not only a flagrant insult to  
  
{ge sovereignty of the nation, but an infraction on

These are in  
general terms referred to, by the instrument itself.  
A more particular notice of the most important of  
  
  
  
  
  
its neutrality also, which did tot pérmit a belliger-  
ent ship thus to augment its force within the neu-  
tral territory.  
  
To finish the scene, this commander went so far  
as to declare, in an official letter, to the minister  
lenipotentiary of his Britannic majesty, and by  
im communicated to this government, that he  
considered his ship, whilst lying in the harbor of  
New-York as having dominion around her, within  
the distance of her buoys. All these circumstances  
were duly made known to the British government  
in just expectation ofhonorable reparation. Norie  
has ever been offered. Captain Bradley was advan-  
ced from his frigate to the command of a ship of  
the line. )  
  
Ata subsequent period, several British frigates,  
under the command of Captain Whitby, of the  
Leander, pursuing the practice by vexing the in-  
ward and outward trade of our ports, and hovering  
for that purpose about the entrance of that of New-  
York, closed a series of irregularities, with an _at-  
tempt to arrest a coasting vessel, on board of which  
an American citizen was killed by a cannon ball  
which entered the vessel, whilst lying within less  
than a mile from the shore.  
  
The blood of a citizen thus murdered, in a trade  
from one to another port of bis own country, and  
within the sanctuary of its territorial jurisdiction,  
could not fail to arouse the sensibility of the public,  
and to make a solemn appeal to the justice of the  
British government. The case was presented more-  
over to that government by this, in the accent which  
itrequired ; and with due confidence that the of-  
fender would receive the exemplary punishment  
  
-  
  
of a legal proof of a fact sufficiently notorious of it-  
self, unexceptionable witnesses to establish it were  
  
sent to Great Britain at the expense of the United  
States.  
  
acquitted ; no animadversion took place on any  
other officer belonging to the squadron ; nor has  
any apology or explanation been made since the  
trial was over, as a conciliatory offering to the dis-  
appointment of this country at sucha result  
  
A case of another character occurred in the month  
of September 1806. The Impeteux, a French ship  
of 74guns, when aground within a few hundred  
yards of the shore of North Carolina, and therefore  
visibly within the territorial jurisdiction and hospi-  
  
upon, boarded and burnt, from three British ships  
of war, under the command of Captain Douglas  
Having completed this outrage on the sovereignty  
and neutrality of the United States, the British com.  
mander felt no scruple in proceeding thence, int  
the waters near Norfolk, nor in the midst of the  
hospitalities enjoyed by him to add to what iad  
  
pressed citizens of the United States, not denied  
be such; on theplea, that the government of tl  
United States had refused to surrender to the deman¢  
of admiral Berkely, certain seamen alledged to bi  
British deserters ; a demand, which it is well unde?  
stood, your government declaims any right to make  
It wouid be very superfluous to dwell on the fe  
tures which marked this aggravated insult. But!  
must be permitted to remind you, that in so serious’  
light was a similar violation of neviral territory  
the destruction of certain Ftench ships on the cos  
of Portugal by a British squadron under the co?  
mand of Admiral Boscawan, regarded by the col

ait presents itself the attack by the British  
ship of war Leopard, on ‘the American frgate

sufticient to remark, that the conclusive evidence  
wh ch-had preceded of the uncontroled excesses  
oi the British naval commanders, in insulting our  
sovereignty and abusing our hospitality, determin-

from his government, demanded, as a satisfixion.  
for the violence committed, that the proceedings  
should be disavowed, the intention of acquir ig  
  
  
  
This was done by his proclamation of July 2.  
1807, referring to the series of occurrences, ending  
with the aggression on the frigate Chesapeake, as  
the considerations requiring it. And ifthe appre-  
bension from the licentious spirit of the British navai  
commanders, thus developed and uncontroled,  
which led to this measure ot precaution, could need  
other justification than was afforded by what had  
passed, it would be amply found in the subsequent  
conduct of the ships under the command of the  
same captain Douglas.  
  
This officer, neither admonished by reflection on  
the crisis produced by the attack on the Chesa-  
peake, nor controled by respect for the law of  
nations, or the laws of the land, did not cease with,  
in,our waters to bring to, by firing at vessels pur-  
suing their reguiar course of trade; and inthesame!  
spirit which had displayed itself in the recent out-  
rage committed on the American frigate, he not  
only indulged himself in hostile threats, and in in-  
dications of a hostile approach to Norfolk, but actu-  
ally obstructed our citizens in the ordinary com-  
munications between that and neighboring places.  
His proceedings constituted in facta blockade of  
the port, and as real an invasion of the country,  
according to the extent of his force, as if troops had  
been debarked, &amp; the town besieged on the land side.

who felt for its rights and its honor, to do less tha  
interpose some measure of precaution, at leas’

Turk’s Island disclaimed, orders given for ihe  
immediate abandonment of it on the part of the  
French. every thing restored to the condition in  
which it was at the time of the aggression, and repa-  
ration made of the damages which any British sub-  
  
jects should be found to have sustained, according,  
  
to an estimation to be settled between. the gover-  
nors of St. Domingo and Jamaica. A compliance  
with the whole of this demand was the result.  
Again :—In the year 1789, certain English mer-  
chants having opened a trade at Nootka Sound, on  
the north-west coast of America, and attempted a  
settlement at that place, the Spaniards, who had  
long claimed that part of the world as their exehi-  
sive property, dispatched a frigate from Mexico,  
which captured the two English vessels engaged in  
  
the trade and broke up the settlement on the coast. -  
  
The Spanish government was the first to complain,  
in this case, of the intrusion committed by the  
British merchants. The British government,  
however, demanded that the vessels taken by the  
Spanish frigate should be restored, and adequate  
satisfaction granted, previous to any other discussioz.  
  
This demand prevailed ; the Spanish government  
agreeing to make full restoration of the captured  
vessels, and to indemnify the parties interested in  
them for the losses sustained. They restored also  
the buildings and tracts ofland, of which the Bri-  
ish subjects had been dispossessed. The British  
however, soon gave a proof of the little value they

against the repetition of enormities which had becn  
so long uncontroled by the government whose offi  
cers had committed them, and which had at last  
taken the exorbitant shape of hostility and of in-  
sult seen in the attack on the frigate Chesapeake ?  
Candor will pronounce that less could not be done ;  
and it will as readily admit that the proclamation  
comprising that measure, could not have breathed  
a more temperate spirit, nor spoken in a more be-  
coming tone. How far it has received from those,  
whose intrusions it prohibited, the respect due to  
the national authority, or been made the occasion  
of new indignities, n¢eds no explanation.  
  
The president having interposed this precaution.  
ary interdict, lostno time in instructing the minis-  
ter plen:potentiary of the United States, to repre-  
sent to the British government the signal aggression  
which had been committed on their sovereignty  
and their fiag, and to require satisfaction due for it;  
indulgin~ the expectation that his Britannic majesty  
would at once perceive it to be the truest magna-  
nimity, as well as the strictest justice, to offerthat  
prompt ‘and full expiation of an -acknowledged  
wrong which would re-establish and improve, both  
  
in fact and in feeling, the state of things which it )  
  
had violated.  
  
This expectation was considered as not only  
honorable to the sentiments of his majesty, but was  
  
  
  
supported by known examples, in which being ttre}  
  
set on the possession, by a voluntary dereliction,  
under which it has since remained.  
  
The case which will be noted last, though of a  
date prior to the case of Nootka sound, is that of  
Falkland’s Islands. These lie about 100 leagues  
castward of the streights of Magellan. The title to  
them had been subject of controversy among seve-  
ral of the maritime nations of Eurepe. From the  
position of the islands, and. other circumstances,  
the pretension of Spain bore an advantageous coin -  
parison with those of her competitors. In the  
year 1770, the British took possession of Port Fe-  
mont, in one of the islands; the Spaniards be-  
  
ing at the time in possession of another part, and.  
  
protesting against a settlement by the British —  
The protest being without effect, ships and troops  
were sent from Beunos Ayres, by the governor of  
that place, which forcibly dispossessed and drove  
off the British settlers. 7  
  
The British government looking entirely to the  
dispossession by force, demanded as a specitic con-  
dition of preserving harmony between the two  
courts, not only the disavowal of the Spanish pro-  
ceedings; but that the affairs of that settlement  
should be immediately restored to the precise state  
in which they were previous to the act of disposses  
sion. ‘Lhe Spanish government made some diffi  
culties ; requising particularly adisavowal on the  
part of Great Britain, of the conduct of her offis

The reply was, that the moderation of his Bri-  
tannic majesty having limitted his demand to the  
smallest reparation he could accept for the injury  
done, nothing was left for discussion but the mode  
of carrying the disavowal and the restitution into  
execution : reparation losing its value if it be condi-  
tional, and to be obtained by any stipulation whate-  
ver from the part injured. ,  
  
The Spanish government yielded. The violent  
proceedings of its officers were disovowed. The  
sort, the port and every thing else were agreed to  
he immediately restored to the precise situation  
which had been disturbed ; and duplicates of or-  
ders issued for the purpose to the Spanish officers,  
were delivered into the hands of one of the British  
principal secretaries of state. Here again it is to be  
remarked, that satisfaction having been made for  
the forcible dispossession, the islands, lost their  
importance-in the eyes of the British government,  
  
were inashoit time finally evacuated, and Port  
  
Egmont remains with every other part of them in  
the hands of Spain.  
  
Could stronger pledgés have been given than  
  
are here found, than an henorable and instant re-  
paration would be made, diftering  
  
no otherwise  
‘vom those recited, than as it furnished to the same  
monarch ofa great nation, an opportunity to prove,  
chat adhering always to the same immutable prin-  
ciple, he was as ready to do right to others, as to  
require it for himself.  
  
Returning to the instructions given to the minis-  
ter plenipotentiary of the United States at London,  
tam to observe. that thé President thought it just  
and expedient to insert, as a necessary ingredient  
&#x27;n the adjustment of the outrage committed on the  
{merican frigate, a sccurity against the future  
nractice of Britisli naval commanders, in impres-  
sing from merchant vessels of the United States on  
he high seas, such oftheir crews as they might  
indertake to denominate British subjects.  
  
To this association of the two subjects the pres’-  
‘ont was determined, Ist, by his regarding both as  
esting on kindred principles, immunity of private  
ips, w.th the known exception made by the law  
of nations, being so well established as that of  
public ships, and there being no pretext for irclud-  
vg in these exceptions the impressment (1f it could  
be freed from its cnormous and notorious abuses)  
of the sabjects ofa belligerent by the officers of that  
neHigerent&lt; The rights of a belligerent, against  
  
‘the -sheps 6f&#x27;a neutral nation, accrue merely from  
  
the- relation of the neutral to the other belliger-  
ont, as in conveying to him contraband of war, or -n  
supplying a blockaded port.  
  
‘Khe claim ofa belligerent to search for and seize  
on board neutral vessels on the high seas, persons  
under bis allegianee, does not therefore rest an  
any betlégerent right under the laws of nafions, but ;  
on a prerogative derived from municipal law ; and  
invotves the extravagant supposition, that one na-  
tion has a right to execute at times and in all cases  
its municipal laws and regulations, oh board the  
ships of another nation, not beimg within its terri-  
sor at limits.  
  
‘She president was led to the same determination,  
Sidly, by his desire of converting a particular inci-  
dent, into ai occasion for removing another and  
inore extensive source of danger to the harmony of  
the two countries; and Sdly, by his persuasion  
that the liberality of the’ propositions authorised  
  
t:Cular incident would be less difficult. The pre-  
sident still thinks that such would have been the.  
tendency of the mode for which he had provided ;  
and cannot therefore but regret that the door was .  
shut against the experiment, by the peremptory re-  
tusal of Mr. Canning to admit it into discussion,  
even in the most informal manner, as suggested by  
Mr. Munroe.  
  
The president felt the greater regret as the step  
he had taken towards a more enlarged and lasting  
accommodation became thus a bar to the adjustment.  
of the particular and recent aggression that had been  
committed against the United States. He found  
however an alleviation, in the signified purpose of  
his Britannic majesty, tocharge with this adjust-  
ment a special mission to the United States, which  
restricted as it was, seemed to indicate a disposition  
from which a liberal and conciliatory arrangement  
of one great cbject, at least, might be confidenthy  
expected.  
  
In this confidence your arrival was awaited with  
very friendly solicitude ; andour first interview  
having opened the way, by an acquiescence in the  
separation of the two cases insisted on by his Bri-  
tannic majesty, notwithstanding the strong ground  
on which they had been united by the president, it  
was not to be doubted that a tender of the satisfac-  
tion claimed by the United States, for a distinguish-  
ed and acknowledged insult, by one of his officers,  
would immediately follow.  
  
It was not, therefore, without a very painful sur-  
prise, that the error of this expectation was disco-  
vered. Instead of the satisfaction due from the ori-  
ginal aggressor, it was announced that the first  
step towards the adjustment must proceed from the  
party injured ; and your letter now before me, for-  
mally repeats, that as long as the proclamation of  
the president, which issued on the 2d July, 1807,  
shall be in force, it will be an insuperable obstacle  
to a negociatian, even on the subject of the aggres-  
sion which precluded it; in other words, that the  
proclamation must be put out of force, before an  
adjustment of the aggression can be taken into dis-  
cussion. .  
  
In explaining the grounds of this extraordinary  
demand, it is alledged to be supported by the con-  
sideration that the proceeding and pretension of the  
offending officer has been disavowed ; that generc!  
assurances are giving of a disposition and intention  
in his Britannic majesty to make satisfaction ; that  
a special minister was dispatched with prompitude  
for the purpose of carrying into effect this disposi-  
ton yand that you have a personal conviction that  
the particular terms, which you are not at lberty  
previously to disclose, will be deemed by the Unit-  
ed States satisiactory.  
  
With respect tothe disavowal, it would be unjust,  
not to regard itas a proof of candor and amity’  
towards the United States, and as some presage of  
the voluntary reparation which it implied to be due.  
But the disavowal can be the less confounded with  
the reparation itself; since it was sufficiently requir-  
ed by the respect which Great Britain owed to her  
own honour; it being impossible that an enlighter-  
ed government, had hostility been meditated, would  
have commenced it in such a manner, and in the  
midst of existing professions of peace &amp; friendship-  
She owed it also to consistency with a disavowal ov  
a former occasion, in which the pretension had been  
  
  
  
enforced by a Britfsh squadron, against the stoop o}

porary punishment should have been awarded to those who  
were found guilty of persisting in such provocations. How dif-  
ferent our conduct was from this conciliating course may be col-  
lected from the following extract of Mr. Madison’s letter, 5th  
March 1808, to Mr. G. H. Rose:  
  
«&lt; In the summer of the year 1804, the British frigate the Cambrian,  
with other cruizers in company, entered the harbour of New York.  
The Commander, Captain Bradley, in violation of the port-laws re-  
lating both to health and revenue, caused a merchant vessel just arrived,  
and confessedly within the limits and under the authority of the United  
States, to be boarded by persons under his command, who, after  
resisting the officers of the port in the legal exercise of their func-  
tions, actually impressed and carried off a number of seamen and pas-  
sengers into the service of the ships of war.’’—  
  
«© All these circumstances were duly made known to the British  
government, in just expectation of honourable reparation. None  
has ever been offered. Captain Bradley was advanced from his fri-  
gate to the command of a ship of the line.  
  
‘¢ At a subsequent period, several British frigates under the com-  
mand of Captain Whitby, of the Leander, pursuing the practice of  
vexing the inward and outward trade of our ports, and hovering for  
that purpose about the entrance of that of New York, closed a series  
of irregularities with an attempt to arrest a coasting vessel, on board  
of which an American citizen was killed by a cannon-ball which en-  
tered the vessel while within less than a mile from the shore.”  
  
We were somewhat more complaisant at the time of the  
attack on the Chesapeak, and judged it proper to supersede our  
Admiral on the station: but the censure on him was of short  
duration, and his re-employment took place at a time when we  
knew that it would ar pear to the American nation in the light  
of a public affront. We must also cursorily advert to the re-  
cent case of Captain Bingham of the Lille Belt, who was raised  
a step in his profession, as if his conduct previously to th

seamen

of the British ship of war Leopard on the  
American frigate Chesapeake, which was  
fired into without warning, killing several  
of her crew, besides forcibly seizing four of  
our sailors under pretense of being Eng

British armed ships from our ports, and for

satisfaction due for these aggressions and

this Government that instructions were  
issued to British naval commanders to ob  
serve the greatest care in preserving the  
citizens of the United States from any  
molestation or injury, and that immediat
