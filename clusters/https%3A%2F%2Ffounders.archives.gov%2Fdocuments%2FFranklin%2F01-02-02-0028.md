l be generally allow’d That we always hit the Day of the Month, and that I suppose is esteem’d one of the most useful Things in an Almanack.  
As to the Weather, if I were to fall into the Method my Brother J----n sometimes uses, and tell you, Snow here or in New England,—Rain here or in South-Carolina, —Cold to the Northward, —Warm to the Southward, and the like, whatever Errors I might commit, I should be something more secure of not being detected in them: But I consider, it will be of no Service to any body to know what Weather it is 1000 miles off, and therefore I always set down positively what Weather my Reader will have, be he where he will at the time. We modestly desire only the favourable Allowance of a day or two before and a day or two after the precise Day against which the Weather is set; and if it does not come to pass accordingly, let the Fault be laid upon the Printer, who, ’tis very like, may have transpos’d or misplac’d it, perhaps for the Conveniency of putting in his Holidays: And since, in spight of all I can say, People will give him great part of the Credit of making my Almanacks, ’tis but reasonable he should take some share of the Blame.

g the Wound with it likewise: but always some of it is to be swallowed, either with the Spittle or with Water.  
The Leaf figur’d in the Margin is one of the largest; for the most part they are not near so big though the Shape be the same.  
  
  
Hints for those that would be Rich.  
The Use of Money is all the Advantage there is in having Money.  
For £6 a Year, you may have the Use of £100 if you are a Man of known Prudence and Honesty.  
He that spends a Groat a day idly, spends idly above £6 a year, which is the Price of using £100.  
He that wastes idly a Groat’s worth of his Time per Day, one Day with another, wastes the Privilege of using £100 each Day.  
He that idly loses 5s. worth of time, loses 5s. and might as prudently throw 5s. in the River.  
He that loses 5s. not only loses that Sum, but all the Advantage that might be made by turning it in Dealing, which by the time that a young Man becomes old, amounts to a comfortable Bag of Money.  
Again, He that sells upon Credit, asks a Price for what he sells, equivalent to the Principal and Interest of his Money for the Time he is like to be kept out of it: therefore  
He that buys upon Credit, pays Interest for what he buys.  
And he that pays ready Money, might let that Money out to Use: so that  
He that possesses any Thing he has bought, pays Interest for the Use of it.  
Consider then, when you are tempted to buy any unnecessary Housholdstuff, or any superfluous thing, whether you will be willing to pay Interest, and Interest upon Interest for it as long as you live; and more if it grows worse by using.  
Yet, in buying Goods, ’tis best to pay ready Money, because,  
He that sells upon Credit, expects to lose 5 per Cent. by bad Debts; therefore he charges, on all he sells upon Credit, an Advance that shall make up that Deficiency.  
Those who pay for what they buy upon Credit, pay their Share of this Advance.  
He that pays ready Money, escapes or may escape that Charge.  
A Penny sav’d is Twopence clear, A Pin a day is a Groat a Year. Save and have. Every little makes a mickle

t way to come at glory, is to do that for conscience which we do for glory.  
There is much money given to be laught at, though the purchasers don’t know it; witness A’s fine horse, and B’s fine house.  
II Mon. April hath xxx days.  
  
A Nymph and a Swain to Apollo once pray’d;  
The Swain had been jilted, the Nymph been betray’d.  
They came for to try if his Oracle knew  
E’er a Nymph that was chast or a Swain that was true.  
Apollo stood mute, and had like t’have been pos’d;  
At length he thus sagely the question disclos’d:  
He alone may be true in whom none will confide,  
And the nymph may be chast that has never been tryd.  
  
He that can compose himself, is wiser than he that composes books.  
Poor Dick, eats like a well man, and drinks like a sick.  
After crosses and losses men grow humbler and wiser.  
Love, Cough, and a Smoke, can’t well be hid.  
III Mon. May hath xxxi days.  
  
Rich Gripe does all his Thoughts and Cunning bend  
T’encrease that Wealth he wants the Soul [to] spend:  
Poor Shifter does his whole Contrivance set,  
To spend that Wealth he wants the Sense to get.  
How happy would appear to each his Fate,  
Had Gripe his Humour, or he Gripe’s Estate?  
  
Kind Fate and Fortune, blend ’em if you can,  
And of two Wretches make one happy Man.  
  
Well done is better than well said.  
  
Fine linnen, girls and gold so bright,  
Chuse not to take by candle-light.  
  
He that can travel well afoot, keeps a good horse.  
There are no ugly Loves, nor handsome Prisons.

 his Shifts,  
Borrowing of Driblets, boldly begging Gifts;  
For Twenty Shillings lent him t’other Day  
(By one who ne’er expected he would pay)  
On his Friend’s Paper fain a Note wou’d write;  
His Friend, as needless, did refuse it quite;  
Paper was scarce, and ’twas too hard, it’s true,  
To part with Cash, and lose his Paper too.  
  
Certainlie these things agree,  
The Priest, the Lawyer, and Death all three:  
Death takes both the weak and the strong.  
The lawyer takes from both right and wrong,  
And the priest from living and dead has his Fee.

VI Mon. August hath xxxi days.  
  
On his Death-bed poor Lubin lies;  
His Spouse is in Despair;  
With frequent Sobs, and mutual Cries,  
They both express their Care.  
A diff’rent Cause, says Parson Sly,  
The same Effect may give;  
Poor Lubin fears that he shall die;  
His Wife, that he may live.  
  
Don’t misinform your Doctor nor your Lawyer.  
  
I never saw an oft-transplanted tree,  
Nor yet an oft-removed family,  
That throve so well as those that settled be.  
  
VII Mon. September hath xxx days.  
  
To-morrow you’ll reform, you always cry;  
In what far Country does this Morrow lie,  
That ’tis so mighty long e’er it arrive?  
Beyond the Indies does this Morrow live?  
’Tis so far-fetch’d, this Morrow, that I fear,  
’Twill be both very old, and very dear.  
To-morrow I’ll reform, the Fool does say:  
To day it self’s too late; the Wise did yesterday.  
  
Let the Letter stay for the Post, and not the Post for the Letter.  
Three good meals a day is bad living.  
  
Tis better leave for an enemy at one’s death, than beg of a friend in one’s life.  
  
To whom thy secret thou dost tell,  
To him thy freedom thou dost sell.  
  
VIII Mon. October hath xxxi days.  
  
  
On T.T. who destroy’d his Landlord’s fine Wood.  
  
Indulgent Nature to each kind bestows,  
A secret Instinct to discern its Foes:  
The Goose, a silly Bird, avoids the Fox;  
Lambs fly from Wolves; and Sailors steer from rocks;  
A Rogue the Gallows, as his Fate, foresees,  
And bears the like Antipathy to Trees.  
  
If you’d have a Servant that you like, serve your self.  
He that pursues two Hares at once, does not catch one and lets t’other go.  
If you want a neat wife, chuse her on a Saturday.  
If you have time dont

X Mon. December hath xxxi days.  
  
Women are Books, and Men the Readers be,  
Who sometimes in those Books Erratas see;  
Yet oft the Reader’s raptur’d with each Line,  
Fair Print and Paper fraught with Sense divine;  
Tho’ some neglectful seldom care to read,  
And faithful Wives no more than Bibles heed.  
Are Women Books? says Hodge, then would mine were  
An Almanack, to change her every Year.  
  
The Creditors are a superstitious sect, great observers of set days and times.  
The noblest question in the world is What Good may I do in it?  
Nec sibi, sed toto, genitum se credere mundo.  
Nothing so popular as Goodness.  
  
  
Of the Eclipses, 1737.  
There will be four Eclipses this Year, two of the Sun and two of the Moon.  
The first is a great and visible Eclipse of the Sun, Feb. 18. beginning at 8 h. 1 m. A.M. middle at 9 h. 11 m. end at 10 h. 20 m. Digits eclipsed near nine, on the upper side of the Sun.  
The second is of the Moon, March 5. at 10 h. 34 m. in the morning, therefore invisible here.  
The third is of the Sun, Aug. 14. at 7 h. 30 m. P.M. invisible also.

Necessary Hints to those that would be

For six pounds a year you may have the use of  
one hundred pounds, provided you are a man of  
known prudence and honesty.

above six pounds a year, which is the price for  
the use of one hundred pounds.

time per day, one day with another, wastes the  
privilege of using one hundred pounds each day.  
  
He that idly loses five shillings worth of time,  
loses five shillings, and might as prudently throw

He that loses five shillings, not only loses that  
sum, but all the advantages that might be made  
by turning it in dealing; which, by the time that  
a young man becomes old, will amount to a con-  
siderable sum of money.  
  
Again; he that sells upon credit, asks a price  
for what he sells equivalent to the principal and  
interest of his money for the time he is to be  
kept out of it; therefore, he that buys upon cre-  
dit, pays interest for what he buys; and he that  
pays ready money, might let that money out to  
use ; so that he that possesses any thing he has  
bought, pays interest for the use of it.  
  
Yet, in buying goods, it is best to pay ready  
money, because he that sells upon credit, expects  
to lose five per cent. by bad debts; therefore he  
charges, on all he sells upon credit, an advance  
that shall make up that deficiency  
  
Those who pay for what they buy upon credit,  
pay their share of this advance.  
He that pays ready money, escapes, or may es-

entitled &#x27;Necessary Hints to those that  
would be Rich,&#x27; says : — The use of  
money is all the advantage there is in  
having money. For six pounds a year you  
may have the use of one hundred pounds,  
provided that you are a man of known  
prudence and honesty. He that spends a  
groat a day idly spends idly above six  
pounds a year, which is the price for  
the use of one hundred pounds. He that  
wastes idly a groat&#x27;s worth of his time  
per day, one day with another, wastes  
the privilege of using one hundred  
pounds each day. He that idly loses five  
shillings&#x27; worth of time loses five  
shillings, and might as prudently throw  
five shillings into the sea. He that  
loses five shillings loses not only that  
sum, but also all the advantages that  
might be made by turning it in dealing,  
which, by the time that a young man  
becomes old, will amount to a  
considerable sum of money. Again, he  
that sells upon credit, asks a price for  
what he sells equivalent to the  
principal and interest of his money for  
the time he is to be kept out of it;  
therefore, he that buys upon credit pays  
interest for what he buys ; and he that  
pays ready money might let that money  
out to use ; so that he that possesses  
anything he has bought pays interest for  
the use of it. Yet, in buying goods, it  
is best to pay ready money, because he  
that sells upon credit expects to lose  
five per ceut. by bad debts; therefore  
he charges on all he sells upon credit  
an advance that shall make up that  
deficiency. Those who pay for what they  
buy upon credit pay their share of this  
advance. He that pays ready money
