To which Mr. Jefferson returned the  
following Answer.  
tO THE INHABITANTS OE ALBEMARLE  
COUNTY, IN VIRGINIA.  
Returning to the scenes of my birth and  
early life, to the society of those with whom  
I was raised, ami who huve been ever dear  
to me, I receive, fellow citizens and neigh­  
bors, with inexpressible pleasure, the cordi­  
al welcome you are so good as to give me.  
Long absent on duties, which the history of a  
wouderful era made incumbent on those  
called to them, the pomp, the ttlrmoil, the  
bustle and splendor of office, have drawn  
but deeper sighs for the tranquil and irre  
sponsible occupations of private life, for the  
enjoyment of an affectionate intercourse with  
you, my neighbours und friends, and the en­  
dearments of family love, which nature has  
given ns all as the sweetner of every hour.  
For these, I gladly lay down the distressing  
burthen of power, and seek with my fellow  
citizens, repose and safety under the watch­  
ful cares, the labours and exertions of youn­  
ger and abler minds. The anxieties you  
express to administer to my happiness, do  
of themselves confer that happiness : and the  
measure will be compleat, if my endeavors to  
fulfil rny duties in the several public stations  
to which I have been called, have obtained for  
me, the approbation of my country. The part  
which I have acted on the theatre of public  
life, has been before them ; and tb their sen­  
tence I submit it: but the testimony of my  
native county, of the individuals who have  
known me in private life, to my conduct in  
its various duties and relations,&#x27;is the more  
grateful, ns proceeding from eyewitnesses &amp;  
observers, from tryers of the vicinage. Of  
you, then, my neighbors, 1 may ask in the  
face of the world, ‘whose ox have I taken,  
or whom have I defrawded? whom ha\e I  
oppressed, or of whose hand have 1 received  
a bribe to blind mine eyes therewith l’ Oh

To which Mr. Jefferfon returned the  
following answer 1o  
To the Inbabitants of Albermarle Coun­  
; ty in Virginia—  
Returning to the scenes of my birth  
and early life, ‘to the society of those  
with whom I was raised, and who  
have been ever dear to me, I reccive,  
fellow citizens and neighbors, with  
inexpreilible pleasure, the cordial wel­

Long absent on duties, which. the his­  
tories of a wonderful zra made in­  
cumbent on those called to them, the  
pomp, the turmoil, the bulftle and  
splendor of office, have drawn but  
deeper sighs for the tranquil and irre­

for the enjoyment of an affe@ionate  
intercourse with you, my neighbors  
and fiiends, and the endearments of  
family love, which nature has given  
us all as the {fweetener of every hour,  
For these, I gladly lay down the dif­  
trefling burthen of power, and seek  
with my fellow citizens repose and  
fafety under the . watchful cares, the  
labors and exertions of younger and  
abler minds. ‘The anxieties you ex­  
press to administer to my happinels,  
do of themselves confer that happi­

pleat, if my endeavors to full my  
duties in the several public stations to
