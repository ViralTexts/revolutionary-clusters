 without the continual assistance of Congress and the States.— I have been lately obliged to a fellow Citizen (Capt. C. Miller) for the Laws of New York of the 2d. meeting of the eight Session of the Legislature, amongst which to my great satisfaction I find the United States in Congress assembled, vested, for fifteen Years with powers to prohibit any goods, wares or Merchandize, from being imported into, or exported from any of the United States, in Vessels belonging to, or navigated by the Subjects of any Power with whom the States shall not have formed treaties of Commerce; and also with powers of prohibiting the Subjects of any foreign Power State, Kingdom or Empire, (unless authorised by treaty) from importing into the United States, any goods, wares, or Merchandize, which are not the produce or Manufacture of the Dominions of the Sovereign whose Subjects they are—

The people are deceived by numberless falshoods industriously circulated by the Gazettes and Conversation; so that there is too much reason to believe, that if this Nation had another hundred Million to spend, they would soon force the Ministry into a War against us. The Court itself whatever may be thought of it appears at present to be the principal Barrier against a War, and the best disposed towards us, and whether they are restrained by any thing beside their own poverty may be justly questioned. Their pr[esent] system, as far as I can penetrate it, is to maintain a determined peace with all Europe, in order that they may War singly against America, if they should think it necessary.
