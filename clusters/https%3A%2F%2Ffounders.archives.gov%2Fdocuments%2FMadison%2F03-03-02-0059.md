on December 5th 1810  
Fellow Citizens of the Senate, and of the House of Representatives.  
The embarassments which have prevailed in our foreign relations, and so much employed the deliberations of Congress, make it a primary duty, in meeting you, to communicate whatever may have occurred, in that branch of our national affairs.  
The Act of the last Session of Congress “concerning the commercial intercourse between the United States, and Great Britain and France and their dependencies” having invited, in a new form, a termination of their Edicts against our neutral commerce, copies of the Act were immediately forwarded to our Ministers at London and Paris; with a view that its object might be within the early attention of the French and British Governments.  
By the communication received through our Minister at Paris, it appeared, that a knowledge of the Act by the French Government, was followed by a declaration that the Berlin and Milan Decrees were revoked, and would cease to have effect on the first day of November ensuing. These being the only known Edicts of France, within the description of the Act, and the revocation of them, being such that they ceased, at that date, to violate our neutral commerce; the fact, as prescribed by law, was announced, by a Proclamation bearing date the second day of November.  
It would have well accorded with the conciliatory views, indicated by this proceeding on the part of France, to have extended them to all the grounds of just complaint, which now remain unadjusted with the United States. It was particularly anticipated that, as a further evidence of just dispositions towards them, restoration would have been immediately made, of the property of our Citizens, seized under a misapplication of the principle of reprisals, combined with a misconstruction of a law of the United States. This expectation has not been fulfilled.  
From the British Government, no communication on the subject of the Act has been received. To a communication from our Minister at London, of the revocation, by the French Government, of its Berlin and Milan Decrees; it was answered, that the British System would be relinquished, as soon as the repeal of the French Decrees should have actually taken effect, and the commerce of neutral nations have been restored to the condition in which it stood, previously to the promulgation of those decrees. This pledge, altho’ it does not necessarily import, does not exclude, the intention of relinquishing, along with the orders in Council, the practice of those novel Blockades, which have a like effect of interrupting our neutral commerce. And this further justice to the United States, is the rather to be looked for, inasmuch as the Blockades in question, being not more contrary to the established law of nations, than inconsistent with the rules of Blockade, formally recognised by Great Britain herself, could have no alledged basis, other than the plea of retaliation, alledged as the basis of the orders in Council. Under the modification of the original orders of November 1807, into the orders of April 1809, there is, indeed, scarcely a nominal distinction between the orders and the Blockades. One of those illegitimate blockades, bearing date in may 1806, having been expressly avowed to be still unrescinded, and to be, in effect, comprehended in the orders in Council, was too distinctly brought within the purview of the Act of Congress, not to be comprehended in the explanation of the requisites to a compliance with it. The British Government was accordingly apprized by our Minister near it, that such was the light in which the subject was to be regarded.  
On the other important subjects depending between the United States and that Government, no progress has been made, from which an early and satisfactory result can be relied on.  
In this new posture of our relations with those Powers, the consideration of Congress, will be properly turned to a removal of doubts which may occur, in the exposition; and of difficulties, in the execution, of the Act above cited.  
The commerce of the United States with the North of Europe, heretofore much vexed by licencious cruisers, particularly under the Danish flag, has latterly been visited with fresh and extensive depredations. The measures pursued in behalf of our injured Citizens, not having obtained justice for them, a further and more formal interposition with the Danish Government, is contemplated. The principles which have been maintained by that Government in relation to neutral commerce, and the friendly professions of His Danish Majesty towards the United States, are valuable pledges, in favor of a successful issue.  
Among the events growing out of the state of the Spanish Monarchy, our attention was imperiously attracted to the change, developing itself in that portion of West Florida, which, though of right appertaining to the United States, had remained in the possession of Spain; awaiting the result of negociations for its actual delivery to them. The Spanish Authority was subverted; and a situation produced, exposing the Country to ulterior events, which might essentially affect the rights and welfare of the Union. In such a conjuncture, I did not delay the interposition required for the occupancy of the Territory West of the River Perdido; to which the title of the United States extends, and to which the laws provided for the Territory of Orleans, are applicable. With this view, the Proclamation, of which a copy is laid before you, was confided to the Governor of that Territory, to be carried into effect. The legality and necessity of the course pursued, assure me of the favorable light in which it will present itself to the Legislature; and of the promptitude, with which they will supply, whatever provisions may be due, to the essential rights and equitable interests of the people, thus brought into the bosom of the American family.  
Our Amity with the Powers of Barbary, with the exception of a recent occurrence at Tunis, of which an explanation is just received, appears to have been uninterrupted, and to have become more firmly established.  
With the Indian Tribes also, the peace and friendship of the United States are found to be so eligible, that the general disposition to preserve both, continues to gain strength.  
I feel particular satisfaction in remarking, that an interior view of our country presents us with grateful proofs of its substantial and increasing prosperity. To a thriving agriculture, and the improvements related to it, is added a highly interesting extension of useful manufactures; the combined product of professional occupations, and of household industry. Such, indeed, is the experience of œconomy, as well as of policy, in these substitutes for supplies, heretofore obtained by foreign Commerce, that, in a national view, the change is justly regarded as, of itself, more than a recompence for those privations and losses resulting from foreign injustice, which furnished the general impulse required for its accomplishment. How far it may be expedient to guard the infancy of this improvement in the distribution of labor, by regulations of the Commercial tariff, is a subject which cannot fail to suggest itself to your patriotic reflections.  
It will rest with the consideration of Congress, also, whether a provident, as well as fair encouragement, would not be given to our navigation, by such regulations, as will place it on a level of competition with foreign vessels, particularly in transporting the important and bulky productions of our own Soil. The failure of equality and reciprocity in the existing regulations on this subject, operates, in our ports, as a premium to foreign competitors; and the inconvenience must increase, as these may be multiplied, under more favorable circumstances, by the more than countervailing encouragements now given them, by the laws of their respective Countries.  
Whilst it is universally admitted that a well instructed people alone, can be permanently a free people; and whilst it is evident that the means of diffusing and improving useful knowledge, form so small a proportion of the expenditures for national purposes, I cannot presume it to be unseasonable, to invite your attention to the advantages of superadding, to the means of Education provided by the several States, a Seminary of Learning, instituted by the national Legislature, within the limits of their exclusive jurisdiction; the expence of which might be defrayed, or reimbursed, out of the vacant grounds which have accrued to the Nation, within those limits.  
Such an Institution, tho’ local in its legal character, would be universal in its beneficial effects. By enlightening the opinions, by expanding the patriotism; and by assimilating the principles, the sentiments and the manners of those who might resort to this Temple of Science, to be redistributed, in due time, through every part of the community; sources of jealousy and prejudice would be diminished, the features of national character would be multiplied, and greater extent given to Social harmony. But above all, a well constituted Seminary, in the center of the nation, is recommended by the consideration, that the additional instruction emanating from it, would contribute not less to strengthen the foundations, than to adorn the structure, of our free and happy system of Government.  
Among the commercial abuses still committed under the American flag, and leaving in force my former reference to that subject, it appears that American Citizens are instrumental in carrying on a traffic in enslaved Africans, equally in violation of the laws of humanity, and in defiance of those of their own Country. The same just and benevolent motives, which produced the interdiction in force against this criminal conduct, will, doubtless, be felt by Congress, in devising further means of suppressing the evil.  
In the midst of uncertainties, necessarily connected with the great interests of the United States, prudence requires a continuance of our defensive and precautionary arrangements. The Secretary of War, and Secretary of the Navy will submit the statements and estimates which may aid Congress, in their ensuing provisions for the land and naval forces. The statements of the latter, will include a view of the transfers of appropriations in the naval expenditures, and the grounds on which they were made.  
The fortifications for the defence of our maritime frontier, have been prosecuted according to the plan laid down in 1808. The works, with some exceptions, are compleated, and furnished with ordnance. Those for the security of the City of New York, though far advanced towards completion, will require a further time and appropriation. This is the case with a few others, either not compleated, or in need of repairs.  
The improvements, in quality and quantity, made in the manufactory of Cannon; and of small arms, both at the public Armories, and private factories, warrant additional confidence in the competency of these resources, for supplying the public exigencies.  
These preparations for arming the Militia, having thus far provided for one of the objects contemplated by the power vested in Congress, with respect to that great Bulwark of the public safety; it is for their consideration, whether further provisions are not requisite, for the other contemplated objects, of organization and discipline. To give to this great mass of physical and moral force, the efficiency which it merits, and is capable of receiving; it is indispensable that they should be instructed and practised, in the rules by which they are to be governed. Towards an accomplishment of this important work, I recommend for the consideration of Congress, the expediency of instituting a system, which shall, in the first instance, call into the field, at the public expence, and for a given time, certain portions of the commissioned and noncommissioned officers. The instruction and discipline thus acquired, would gradually diffuse, thro’ the entire body of the Militia, that practical knowledge, and promptitude for active service, which are the great ends to be pursued. Experience has left no doubt, either of the necessity, or of the efficacy, of competent military skill in those portions of an army, in fitting it for the final duties, which it may have to perform.  
The Corps of Engineers, with the Military Academy, are entitled to the early attention of Congress. The Buildings at the Seat, fixt by law, for the present Academy, are so far in decay, as not to afford the necessary accomodation. But a revision of the law is recommended, principally with a view to a more enlarged cultivation and diffusion of the advantages of such Institutions, by providing professorships for all the necessary branches of military instruction; and by the establishment of an additional Academy, at the Seat of Government, or elsewhere. The means by which war, as well for defence, as for offence, are now carried on, render these Schools of the more scientific operations, an indispensable part of every adequate system. Even among nations whose large standing armies and frequent wars, afford every other opportunity of instruction; these establishments are found to be indispensable, for the due attainment of the branches of Military science, which require a regular course of study and experiment. In a Government, happily without the other opportunities; Seminaries, where the elementary principles of the art of War, can be taught without actual war, and without the expence of extensive and standing armies, have the precious advantage, of uniting an essential preparation against external danger, with a scrupulous regard to internal safety. In no other way, probably, can a provision of equal efficacy for the public defence be made, at so little expence, or more consistently with the public liberty.  
The receipts into the Treasury during the year ending on the 30th of September last (and amounting to more than eight Millions and a half of Dollars) have exceeded the current expences of the Government, including the interest on the public debt. For the purpose of reimbursing, at the end of the year 3,750,000 dollars of the Principal, a loan, as authorized by law, had been negociated to that amount; but has since been reduced to 2,750,000 dollars; the reduction being permitted by the State of the Treasury; in which there will be a balance, remaining at the end of the year, estimated at 2,000,000 dollars. For the probable receipts of the next year, and other details, I refer to statements which will be transmitted from the Treasury; and which will enable you to judge, what further provisions may be necessary for the ensuing years.  
Reserving for future occasions, in the course of the Session, whatever other communications may claim your attention, I close the present, by expressing my reliance, under the blessing of Divine Providence, on the judgment and patriotism which will guide your measures, at a period particularly calling for united counsils, and inflexible exertions, for the welfare of our Country; and by assuring you of the fidelity and alacrity, with which my co-operation will be afforded.

ml Fellow- Citizens of the Senate, and  
of the House of Representatives,  
THE embarrassments which have  
prevailed in hiir foreign relations, and  
so much employed the deliberations  
of Congress, make it a primary duty, in  
roev&#x27;tingyou, to communicate whatev­  
er may have occurred, in that branch  
of our national affaire.  
The net of the last session of Con­  
gre«a “concerning the commercial  
intercourse between the United States  
and G. Britain and France and their  
dependencies” have invited, in a new  
form, a termination of their edicts a­  
gninst our neutral commerce, copies  
of the act were immediately forward­  
ed to our ministers at London and Pa­  
ris ; with a view that its object might  
be within the early attention of the  
French and British governments.  
By the communication received  
through our minister at Paris, it api  
peered, that a knowledge of the act by  
the French government, was followed  
• by a declaration that the Berlin and  
Milan decrees were revoked, &amp; would  
cease to have effect on the first day  
of November ehsuing. These being  
the only known edicts of Franee with­  
in the description of the act, and the  
revocation of them, being such that  
4 they ceased, at that date, fo violate  
our neutral commerce ; the fact, as  
prescribed by law, was announced by  
a j reclamation bearing date the 2d  
day of Nov.  
.. It would have well accorded with  
the concilia ory vi« wg, indicated by  
this proceeding on the part of France,  
to have extended them to all the  
grounds of just complaint, which now  
remain bhadjusted wins ine U. States.  
It was particularly anticipated, that, as  
a furthei evidence of just dispositions  
towards them, restoration would have  
been jmmediaiely made of the proper­  
ty of our citizens seized under a  
misapplication of the principle of re­  
prisals&#x27;, combined with a misconstruc­  
tion of *a law of the United States*  
This expectation has not been fulfilled.  
From the British government no  
communication on the subject of the  
act has been received. i*o a com  
nication from our minister at London  
of the revocation, by the French go­  
vernment, of its Berlin and Milan de­  
cree*; it was answered that the Bri­  
tish system would be relinquished as  
soon as the repeal of the French dc­  
&#x27; crecs &#x27;should have actually taken ef­  
&#x27;iiect, and the commerce of heutral ng­  
t&#x27;fons have been restored to the con­  
dition in w ich it stood, previously to  
&#x27;the promulgation 6f those decrees.  
This pledge, although it dots not re­  
erssarily import, doVs not exclude the  
intention of relinquishing, along with  
* the orders in council, the practice of  
those novel blockades which have a  
like eflert of interrupting our neutral  
corrn(ir*re. And this further justice  
to United States is the rather to  
h ilrwf fnr inaomiirh a: fVi»• I  
  
tides in question, being not more con­  
trary to the established law of nations,  
than inconsistent with the rules of  
b!o&quot;.!tnde formerly recognized by G.  
Britain herself, could have no altcdg­  
ed basis, other than the plea of reta­  
liation, ailed gid ns the basis of the  
borders in council. Under the modi­  
ficitfion of the original orders of No.  
Somber 1807, into the orders of A&lt;  
y) il 1809, there is indeed scarcely a  
it &gt;min?.l distinction between the &#x27;rrders  
S*t ;rt the hlccVnde*. One of those il  
J. t &#x27;bin-ate bh/dtadtr, bearing date ir  
IVi, &gt;v IttOtt, having been expressly h­  
vf&#x27;t &#x27;ed to be still unrcsclnded, and tr  
he, in effect, comprehended in the or  
clerf in council, was too disiincl)  
1&gt;rod C;ht within the purview of the ac  
trf C ongres#, not to be comprehendet  
in ih i explanation of ine requisites q  
ft c &gt;t -pli men with it. Hie Uririsl  
g&#x27;»vi f .uncut was accordingly apprlz  
ed ty our minister near it, that sucf  
was ih e light in which the subject wa  
to be . regarded*  
On i e other important subjects de  
pettdm between the United State  
and thl . government, no progress ha  
been ml Jcj ftom which an early am  
niilhei ry result can be relied on.  
  
In this new posture of our relation:  
with those powers, the consideratioc  
of congress will be properly turned to*  
&#x27; wards a removal of doubts which may  
occur in the exposition, and of diffi  
culties in the execution, of the act a­  
; bove cited. .,, .  
The commerce of the United State:  
with the North of E-trope, heretofore  
much vexed by licentious cruisers,  
particularly by the. Danish hag, has  
lately been visited with fresh and ex­  
tensive depredations.—The rtaeasures  
} pursued in behalf of our ibjured citi­  
• zens not baying obtained justice^ for  
them, a further and more format in.,  
terposition with the Danish goVcrn­  
! ment is contemplated. The princi*  
[pies which have been iraintained by  
j that government in relation to neutral  
commerce, and the friendly professi­  
i on&#x27;s of his Danish majesty towards the  
United States are valuable pledges in  
favor of a successful issue.  
Among the events growing out of  
the state of the Spanish monarchy  
our attention was imperiously attract­  
[ ed to the change developing itself in  
  
that portion of West Florida, which  
&#x27; though of right appertaining to the  
| United States, had remained in the  
| possession of Spain, awaiting the re­  
i suit of negotiations for its actual deli­  
; very to them. The Spanish authori­  
ty was subverted : and a situation  
produced exposing the country to ul­  
terior events, which might essentially  
affect the rights and welfare of the  
union. In such a conjuncture, I did  
not delay the interposition required  
lor tHe occupancy* of the territory  
west of the river Perdido, to which  
the title of the United States extends,  
and to which the laws provided for  
the territory of Orleans are applica­  
ble. With ibis view, the proclamati­  
on, a copy of which is laid before you,  
was confided to the governor of that  
territory to he carried into effect. The  
legality and necessity of thu course  
pursued, assure me of the favorable  
light in which it will present itiqlf to  
the legislature; and of the promptitude  
with which they will supply whatever  
provisions may be due to the essenti­  
al rights and equitable interests of the  
people thus brought into the bosom of  
the American family.  
. Our amity with the powers of Bar­  
bary, with the exception of a recent  
-zee at Tunis, of which an ex  
r.«*nntion is just received, appears to  
j have been uninterrupted and to have  
become move firmly established^  
With the Indian tribes a’so the peace  
and friendship of the United States  
are found to be so eligible, that the  
general disposition to preserve both  
continues to gain strength,  
I feel particular satisfaction in re­  
marking that an interior view of our  
country presents us wiqjh grateful proofs  
of its substantial and increasing pros­  
perity. To a thriving agriculture and  
  
the improvements related to it, is ad.  
dec! a highly interestin&#x27;g extension of  
’useful manufactures; the combined  
product of professional ocoupatidns,  
i and of household industry. Such in.  
deed is the«experlertce of economy, a;  
well as policy, in these substitutes foi  
supplies heretofore obtained by for­  
eign commerce, that in a nation a  
view the change is justly regarded ai  
ot itself more than a recompence foi  
those privations and los-es reseltinf  
from foreign injustice, which furnish,  
eel the general impulse required for iti  
accomplish ment. How far it mav b&lt;  
t xpedient 10 gua*d the infancy of thi  
improvement in the distribution of la  
bor,bv regulations of the commercia  
tariff, is a subject which Connot fail t&lt;  
suggest itself to &gt; our patriotic refiec  
tions.  
1 It will rest with the considera’ioi  
of Congress also whether a providen  
as well as fnjr encouragement wouli  
• not he given to our navigation bv sue  
regulations as will phxe it on a levt  
■ of Ctmipe’itio &gt; with foreign vessels, paj  
l ticul rly in transporting the import.^  
&gt; and bulky productions of our own r,oi  
1 &#x27;I he failure of equality and recipmc  
-: ty in the existing regulations oath  
&gt; subject operates, in our ports, as  
» premium to foreign competitors; an  
* the inconvenience must increase •,  
may be multiplied, under moi  
« favorable circumstances, by the moi  
1 than countervailing rncour.igcm en  
1 now given them, by the laws of the  
; respective countries.  
  
• Whilst »t it universally admitted that a  
well instructed peoples lone can beperma.j  
nently a free people; arid whilst $t is evi  
dent that the means of diffusing and improve  
ing useful knowledge. form so small a pro­  
portion of the expenditures for national pur­  
poses, I cannot presume it to be unseasona­  
ble, to sprite your attention to the advan­  
tages of seperadding, to the means ot edu­  
cation provided by the several states, a se­  
minary- f learning, Instituted by the nati­

might be defrayed, or.reimbursed, out of

the nation within those limits. •  
Such an institution, though local.ln its legvV  
character, would he universal in its beneficial  
effects. By enlightening the opinions; by ex­

through every part of the community i sources  
of jealousy and.prejudice would be diminish­  
ed, the features of national character would  
be multiplied, and greater extent given to so.  
cial harmony. But above all, a well constitut­  
ed seminary, ip the centre of the nation, is re­  
commended by the consideration that the ad­  
ditional instruction emanating from it, would  
contribute not less to strengthen, the fouuda.  
tion, than to adoriwhe structure, of our free  
and happy system of government.  
  
nlining me commercial anuses still commit*  
tejl under the American flag, $nd leaving in  
force my former reference to that subject it  
appears that American citizens are instrument  
tal in carrying on a trrffic in enslaved A tricar s,  
equally in violation of the laws of humanity, fit  
in defiance of those of their own cour^ry. The  
same just fii benevolent motives which produ  
cedthe interdiction in farce against this criminal  
conduct, will doubtless he felt by Congress in  
devising further means of suppressing the evil.  
In the midst of uncertainties necessarily con­  
nected with tiie great interests of the U. States,  
pr udence requires a continuance of our defen.  
sive and precautionary arrangements. The  
secretary of war and secretary of the navy wi!l  
submit the statements and estimates which  
may aid CongTess in their ensuing provisions  
fo. the land and naval forces. The statements  
of thedatier will include a view of the trans­  
fers of appropriations in the oavalexpenditureg,  
and the grounds on which they were made.  
The fortifications for the defence of our ma­  
itime frontier have been prosecuted accord  
ing to the plan laid down in 1808 The works,  
with some exceptions, are compleated, and  
furnished with ordnance- Those for the secu­  
rity of the City of New.York, though far ad.  
vanced towards completion, will require a fur­  
ther time and appropriation. This is the case  
with a few others, either not compleated, or  
in need of repairs. .  
The improvements, in quality and qu.intity,  
made in the manufactory of cannon ; and of  
small arms, both at the public armories, ar.c!  
private factories, warrant additional confiden ce  
in the competency of these resources, for sup  
plying the public ex.genc.es.  
These preparations for &#x27;arming the mili­  
tia having thus far provided for one of the  
objects contemplated by the power vested  
in Congress, with respect to that geat »-u!_  
wark of the public safety; it i? for their  
crnS&#x27;deration, whether further provisions  
are not requisite, for the dther contempla­  
ted objects, of organization and discipline.  
To give to this great mass of physical and  
noral force, tne efficiency which it merits,  
and is capable of receiving ; it is indisptn­  
sible that they should be Instructed and  
practised in the rules by which they are  
to be governed. Towards an accomplish  
ment of this important work, I recommend  
for the consideration of Congress the expe­  
diency of instituting a system, which shall,  
in the first instance, call into the field, at  
the public expense, and for a given time,  
certain portions of the commissioned and  
non-commissioned officers. The instruction  
and discipline thus acquired would gradu.  
ally diffuse through the entire body of the  
• militia that practical knowledge fie promp­  
titude for active service, which are the  
great end* to be pursued. Experience has  
  
rett no Qouot, either ot the necessity, or of  
the efficacy, of competent military skill, in  
those portions of an army, in fitting it for  
the final duties, which it may have to per­  
form.  
The corps of Engineer*, with the MUita­  
I ry Academy, are entited to the early at.  
i tent ion of Congress The buildings at the

Fcl otv Citizens of the Senate, and  
oj the House of Representatives,  
THE embarrassments which have pre  
Vailed in our foreign relations, and so much  
employed the deliberations of Congress,  
make it a primary duty, in meeting you, to  
communicate whatever may have occurred,  
in that branch ol our national affairs.  
The act ol the last session of Congress  
“ concerning the commercial intercourse  
between the U. States and G. Britain and  
Fiance &amp; their depend;-.icies&#x27;’ having iovi.  
ted, in a new form, a termination of their  
edicts against nur neutral commerce, copies  
ot the act we*e &#x27;niu.t diateiv forwarded to  
our ministers at Lontton and Paris ; with a  
view that its object might be within the  
.early atten ion of the French and British  
governments.  
By the communication received through  
our Minister &amp;i Paris, it appeared, that a  
knowledge of the act by the French gov.  
einment. was followed by a declaration that  
the Berlin and Milan decress were revoked,  
and would cea&#x27;-e to have effect on the first  
day of November ensuing These being tile  
only known edicts ot France, within the  
description ol the act, and the revocation of  
viiem, being such that they ceased, at that  
date,&#x27;to violate our neutral commerce ; the  
fact, as prescribed bv law, was announced  
by a proclamation bearing date the 2d day  
of Nov  
  
It would have well accorded with the  
conciliatory views, indicated by this pro.,  
ceeding on the part of France, to have ex&quot;  
tended them to all the grounds of just com.  
pi.put, which now remain unadjusted with  
the U. States. It was particularly anticipa  
ted that, as a furthor evidence of just dis­  
positions towards them, restoration would  
h;ive been immediately made of the proper  
ty of our citizens seized under a ir.isappli­  
cation ol the principle of reprisals, oombined  
with a misconstruction of a law of the U.  
States. This expectation has not been ful*  
filled.  
From the British government no comma  
nication on the subject of the act has been  
received. To a communication from our  
minister at London of tbe revocation, by the  
French government, ofits Berlin and Milan  
decrees, it was answered, that the British  
system would be relinquished soon as the  
repeal of the French decrees should have  
actually taken effect, and the commerce of  
nei.tr.&gt;1 nations have been restored to the  
conili&#x27;ion in which it stood, previously to the  
promulgation of those decrees. This pledge,  
al&#x27;hingh it does not necessarily import,  
does n t exclude the intention of relinquish!  
ing along with the orders in council, the  
practice of those novel blockades which  
have a like effect of in&#x27;enup ing our neu  
tral commerce. And this further justice to  
thr U. S. is the rather to he looked for, in  
asmuch as the blockades in question being  
not more Contrary to the established law of  
nations, than inconsistent with Urn rules of  
1&gt;1 ckade formerly recognized by G B her.  
self, could havp no aliedged basis, other than 1  
the p*ca of retaliation, alb-dged as the basis &#x27;  
of&#x27;he orders in Council. Under be modi. ’  
Jica&#x27;ion of the original orders of November :  
18(7, tnco the orders of April 1809, here is 1  
indeed scnrcelya nominal distinction between &#x27;  
the ordt vs and the blockades. One of those *  
ilh itimaie blockades, bearing date in May *  
I8h6, having been expressly avowed to be  
still unrcsciiided, and to be, in effect, com.. (  
prehended in the orders in council, was too f  
distmcly brought within the puiview of the &lt;  
net of Congress, not to be corpprehendrd in r  
the explanation of the requisites to a com., i  
pliance with it. The British government a  
whs accordingly apprized by our minister t  
near it, that such was the light in which the r  
subject was to bo i egarded. v  
Oh the other important subjects depend f  
ing between the U States and (bat govern t  
inrnf, no progress has been made, from  
which an early and satisfactory result can n  
he relied on c  
In this new posture pf our relations with v  
th .se powers, the consideration of congress e  
will be properly turned towards a removal fi  
of daub&#x27;s which may occur in the exposition, t  
nod of difficulties in the execution, of thr &quot;  
ret above cited • ti  
The commerce of the U States with the t  
jKorth of Kutope heretofore much vex. p  
cd by licentious e-nizers, pHi tin larly by  
the Dm ishflag.h s la-rlybyeii v:«- d wit I ti  
in sh and txuu3ivtdepiedAli.il s. The mi x-, ft  
  
sur«4 pursued in behalf of cur injured citl- i  
zens no* hating obtained justice for them, i  
a turtlif r and more formal interposition with  
the Danish government is contemplated.—  
The principles which have been maintained  
by that government in relation to neutral  
rommerce, and the fiietully professions of  
Ills Danish majesty towards the U. States  
are taluable pledges in favor of a successful  
issue.  
Among the events growing out of the state  
of the Spanish monarchy rur attention was  
imperiously attracted to the change deve­  
loping itself in that portion of West Florida,  
which though ol right appertaining to the  
1^. S., had remained in the possession of  
Spain, awaiting the result of negociati  
ous for its actual delivery to them. Th«  
Spanish authority was subverted : and a si*  
tuation produced exposing the country to ul  
terior events, which might essentially affect  
the rights and welfare of the union. In  
such a conjuncture, I dido t delay the inter­  
position required for the occupancy of the j  
territory west of «he rivet Perdido, to which  
the title of the U. S extends, and to which,  
the laws provided for the territory of Or  
leans are applicable. With this view, the  
Proclamation, a copy of which is laid before  
you, was confuted to the governor of that  
territory to be carried into effect. The le  
gality and m cessity ot the course pursued,  
assure me of the favorable light in winch  
it * ill present itself to the legislature, and  
of &#x27;he promptitude with which they will  
supply whatever provisions may be due to  
the essential rights and equitable inte  
rests of the people thus brought into the bo  
som of the American family  
Our ami*y with the powers of Rarbary, I  
with the exception of a recent occurrence  
at Tunis,of which an explanation isjustre-J  
ceived, appears to have been uninterrupted, ■  
and to have become more firmly establish, i  
ed  
With the Indian tribes also the peace  
and friendship of the U States are found  
to be so eligible, that the general disposi..  
tion to preserve both continues to gain  
strength.  
  
i teet particular satisfaction in remark  
ing that an interior view of our country  
presents us with grateful proofs of its sub  
statuial and increasing prosperity. To a  
thriving agriculture and the improvements  
related to it, is added a highly interesting  
extension of useful manufactures; the com­  
bined prixluct of professional occupations,  
and of hr use hold industry, bucli indeed is  
the experience ot economy, as well as poli  
cy, in these substitutes for supplies hereto  
fore obtained by foreign commerce, that in  
a national view the change is justly regar­  
ded as of itself more than a recompence for  
those privations and losses resulting from  
foreign injustice, which furnished the gen­  
eral impulse, required for its accomplish­  
ment. Mow far it may be expedient to  
guard the infancy of this improvement in  
the distribution ot labor, by regulations of  
the commercial tariff, »s u subject which  
cannot fail to suggest itself to your patriot  
ic reflections.  
It will rest with the consideration of con­  
gress also whether a provident as well as fair  
encouragement would not oe given to our  
navigation by such regulations as will place  
it on a level of competition with foreign  
vessels, particularly in transporting the im  
portant and bulky productions of our own ;  
soil. . *1 he failure of equality and recipro­  
city in the existing regulations on this sub­  
ject operates, in our ports, as a premium  
to foreign competitors ; and the inconveui  
ettce must encrease as these may be multi­  
plied, under more favorable circumstances,  
by che more than countervailing encourage­  
ments now given them, by the laws of their ,  
respective countries.  
  
wnust it is universally admitted that a.  
well instructed people alone can be pei ma i  
ne.itly a free people; and whilst it is evi- |  
dent that the means of diffusing and impro. !  
ving useful knowledge form so small a pro* &#x27;  
portion of the expenditures for national pur  
poses, I cannot presume it to be unseasona.  
hie, to invite your attention to the advan  
tages of superadding, to the means of edu i  
cation provided by the several states, a se  
minary of learning, instituted by the nation  
al legislature, within the limits of their ex­  
clusive jurisdiction ; the expence of which  
might be defrayed, or reimbursed, out of the  
vacant grounds which have accrued to the na­  
tion wiihin these limits.  
Such an institution, though local in its  
legal character, would be universal in its !  
beneficial effects By enlightening the opi.j  
nions; Wy expanding the patriotism ; andi  
by assimilating the principles, the send ■  
ments and the manners of those who might!  
resort to this temple of science to be re.  
distributed, in due time, through every  
|iart of the community ; sources of jealousy  
and prejudice would be diminished, the  
features of national character would be mul  
tiplied, and greater extent given to social  
harmony. Bui above all, a well constituted &#x27;  
seminary, in the centre of the nation, is  
recommended by the consideration that the  
additional instruction emanating from it,  
would contrioute no less to strengthen  
:he foundation, than to adorn the struc j  
ure, ol our free and happy system of go I  
rernment.  
Among the commercial abuses still com.!  
Tiitted under the American flag, and leav i  
ng in force my former reference to that  
&#x27;object, it appears that American ci izens  
ue instrumental in carrying on a traffic in  
rnslaved Africans, equally in violation ol  
he laws of humanity, and in defiance of  
hose of their own country. The same just  
md benevolent motives which produced  
l»e interdiction in force against this critpi.  
ini conduct, will doubtless lie felt by Con  
;ress in devising further means of suppress  
ng the evd.  
In the midst of uncertainties necessarily  
onnected with the great interests of the U.  
dates, prudence requires a continuance of  
ur defensive and precautionary arrange,  
aents. The secretary of war and secret a  
y of the navy will submit the statements  
nd estimates which may aid Congress in  
heir ensuing provis ions for the land and  
aval forces. I he statements of the latter  
dll include a view of the transfers of ap­  
ropriations in the naval expenditures, and  
be grounds on which they were made. &lt;  
I he lot tifications for the defence of our  
maritime frontier have been prosecuted ac  
ordii.g to the plan laid dawn in 1808. The I  
ro,k*» with some exceptions, are compleat­

exigencies.  
&#x27;I hese preparations for arming tlte militia  
having thus far provided for one of the  
objects contemplated by the power ves&#x27;ed  
in Congress, with respect to that great but  
wark of the public safety; it is for their  
consideration, whether lurther provisions  
are not requisite, for he other contemplated  
objects, of organization anil discipline. To  
give to this great mass of physical and mo  
ral force, the efficiency which it merits, and  
incapable of receiving; it is iiulispensiblc  
that they should he instructed and practised  
in the rules by which they are to be govern,  
ed. 1 awards an accomplishment of this itn.  
por ant work* I recommend for the conside­  
ration ot Congress, the expediency of insti  
tuting a system, which shall, in the first in­  
stance, call into the field, at the public ex­  
pence, and for a given time, certain portions  
ot *he commissioned and non-commissioned  
officers. 1 he instruction and discipline  
thus acquired would gradually diffuse  
through the entire body of the militia that  
practical knowledge and promptitude for ac«  
live service, which are the great ends to be  
pursued. Experience has left no donbt, ei­  
ther of the necessity, or of the efficacy, of  
competent military skill, iu those portions  
of an army, in fitting it for the final duties,  
which it may have to perform.  
-The corps of Engineers, with the Military  
Academy, are entitled to the early attention I  
oft. ongress. 1 he Buildings at the seat, fix&#x27;  
by law,- for the present Academy are so far  
in decay, as not to afford the necessary ac_  
commodation. But a revision of the law is  
recommended, principally with a view to a  
more enlarged cultivation and diffusion of the  
advantages of such institutions, by providing  
professorships for all the necessarv brandies  
of military instruction, and hv the establish  
ment of an additional Academy, at ti&gt;c Seat  
of Government, or elsewhere * The means  
by which war. as well for defence, as for  
offence, are now carried on. render these  
schools of the more scientific opt rations an  
indispensable part of every adequate system.  
Even among nations whose laige s ending  
armies and frequent wars afford every oih. i  
opportunity of instruction, these establish  
  
merits are round to be mdi-pensable for ihe  
due attainment of the branches of military  
science, which require a tegular course of  
study and experiment In a government,  
happily without the other opportunities, se­  
minaries, where the elementary princip es  
of the art of war can be tauglv without actual  
war and without the expence oi extensive  
and standing armies, have the precious ad  
vantage of uni*ing an essen lal preparation  
against external danger, with a scrupulous  
rega&#x27;d to internal safety. In no o.her wav.  
probably, can a provision of equal efficacr  
for the public detence he made at 50 little  
expence or more consistently with the public  
liberty.  
I he receipts into the Treasury during  
the year ending on the 30th 01 Septembei  
last (and amounting to more than eight mil  
lions and a half of dollars) have exceeded  
the current expenses of &#x27;.he Governmejti, in  
eluding the interest on the public debt. ——  
For tne purpose of reimbursing at the end  
of the yeut 3 750.000 dollars of the princL  
pal a loan as authorised by law, had been  
negociated to that amount : but has since  
been reduced to 2,750,000 dollars ; the re  
due ion being permitted by the state of the  
Treasury ; in which there will be a balance,  
i remaining at the cud of the year, estimated  
at 2,000 000 dollars. For the probable re  
ceipts of the next year, and other details I  
lefer to statements which will be transmit

ble you to iudee what further provisions mav  
bs necessary for the ensuing years;

Fellow citizens of the senate, and  
of the house of representatives,  
  
The ernbarrassments which have prevail-  
éd in our foreign relations, and so much em-  
ployed the deliberations of congress, make  
it a primary duty in meeting you, to commu-  
nicate whatever may have eccurred, in that  
branch of our national affuirs.  
  
The act of the last session of congress,  
“ concerning the commercial intercourse be-  
tween the United States and Great Britain  
and France and their dependencies” having  
invited, in a new form, a terminetion of their  
edicts against our neutral commerce, copies  
of the act were immediately forwariled to  
our ministers at London and Paris; with a  
view that its object might be within the ear-  
ly attention of the French and British go-  
vernments.  
  
By the communication received through  
our minister at Paris, it appeared, that a  
knowledge of the act by the French govern-  
ment, was followed by a declaration that the  
Berlin and Milan decrees were revoked, and  
would cease to have effect on the first day of  
November ensuing. These being the only  
known edicts of France, within the descrip-  
tion of the act, and the revocation of them,  
being such that they ceased at that date to  
violate our neutral commerce; the fact, as  
prescribed by law, was announced by a pro-  
clamation bearing date the second day of No-  
vember.  
  
It would have well accorded with the con-  
ciliatory views, indicated by this proceeding  
on the part of France, to have extended  
them to all the grounds of just complaint,  
which now rem@in unadjusted with the Uni-  
ted States. It was particularly anticipated,  
that, as a further evidence of just disposi-  
tions towards them, restoration would have  
been immediately made of the property of  
our Citizens, seized under a misapplication  
of the principle of reprisals, combined with a  
misconstruction of a law of the United States.  
This expectation has not been fulfilled.  
  
From the British government no commu-  
nication on thé subject of the act has been  
received. To a communication from our mi-  
nister at London, of the revocation, by the  
French government, of its Berlin and Milan  
decrees, it was answered, that the British  
system would be relinquished as soon as the  
repeal of the French decrees had actually  
taken effect, and the commerce of neutral  
nations have been restored to the condition  
in which it stood, previous to the promulga-  
tion of those decrees. This pledge, although  
it does not necessarily import, does not ex-  
clude the intention of relinquishing, along  
with the orders in council, the practice of  
  
  
  
  
  
fect of interrupting our neutral commerce.  
And this further justice to the United States  
is the rather to be looked for, inasmuch as  
the blockades in question, being not more  
contrary to the established law of nations,  
than inconsistent with the rules of blockade  
formally recognised by Great Britain herself,  
could have no alledged basis, other than the  
plea of retaliation, alledged as the basis of  
the orders in council. Under the modifica-  
tion of the original orders of November 1807,  
into the orders of April 1809, there is in-  
deed scarcely a nominal distinction between  
  
ithe orders and the blockades. One of those  
  
ilie itimate blockades bearing date in May  
1806, having been expressly avowed to be  
still unrescinded, and to be, in effect, com-  
prehended in the orders in council, was too  
distinctly brought within the purview of the  
act of congress not to be comprehended in  
the explanation of the requisites to a com-  
pliance with it. The British government was  
accordingly apprised by our minister near it,  
that such was the light in which the subject  
was to be regarded.  
  
Ou the other important subjects depend-  
ing between the United States and that go-  
vernment, no progress has been made, from  
which an early and satisfactory result can be  
relied on.  
  
In the new posture of our relations with  
those powers, the consideration of congress  
will be properly turned toa removal of doubts  
which may occur in the exposition, and of  
difficulties in the execution, of the act above  
cited.  
  
The commerce of the United States, with  
the north of Europe, heretofore much vexed  
by licentious cruisers, particularly under the  
Danish flag, has latterly been visited with  
fresh and extensive depredations. The mea-  
sures pursued in behalf of our injured citi-  
zens not haying obtained justice for them,  
a further and more formal inteposition with  
the Danish government is contemplated.  
The principles which have been maintauied  
by that government in relation to neutral  
commerce, and tie friendly professions of  
his Danish majesty towards the United  
States, are vaiuabie pledges, in favor of a  
successtui issuc.  
  
Amoug the events growing out of the  
state of the Spanish monarchy, our attention  
Was lperiousiy attracted to the change, de-  
veloping itseli in that portion of West Flo-  
rida, which though of nigh’ appertaining to  
the United States, had pemualued i the pos-  
session of Spal; awuluug the result of ne-  
gociations ior its actual delivery to them,

wterior events, which might essentially af-  
  
——_—_——LL  
  
fect the rights and welfare of the Union. In  
such a conjuncture, I did not delay the in-  
terposition required for the occupancy of the  
territory west of the river Perdido; to which  
the title of the United St.:tes extends, and to  
which the laws, provided for the territory of  
Orleans, are applicable. With this view, the  
proclamation, of which a copy is laid before  
you, was confided to the governor of that  
territory, to be carried into effect. The le-  
gality and necessity of the course pursued,  
assure me of the favorable light in which it  
will present itself to ‘the legislature; and of  
the promptitude, with which they will sup-  
ply whatever provisions may be due to the  
essential rights and equitabie interests of the  
people thus brought into the bosom of the  
American family.  
  
Our amity with the powers of Barbary,  
with the exception of a recent occurrence at  
Tunis, of which an explanation is just re-  
ceived, appears to have been uninterrupted,  
and to have become more firmly established.  
  
With the Indian tribes, also, the peace  
and friendship of the United States are found  
to be so eligible, that the general disposition  
to preserve both continues to gain strength.  
  
I feel particular satisfaction in remarking  
that an interior view of our country presents  
us with grateful proofs of its substantial and  
increasing prosperity. To a thriving agricul-  
ture, and the improvements relating to it, is  
added a highly interesting extension of use-  
ful manufactures; the combined product of  
professional occupations, and of household  
industry. Such, indeed, is the experience of  
economy, as well as of policy, in these sub-  
stitutes for supplies heretofore obtained by  
foreign commerce, that, in a national view,  
the change is justly regarded as of itself  
more than a recompense for those privations  
and losses resulting from foreign injustice,  
which furnished the general impulse requi-  
red for its accomplishment. How far it may  
be expedient to guard the infancy of this  
improyement in the distribution of labor, by  
regulations of the commercial tariff, is a sub-  
ject which cannot fail to suggest itself to  
your patriotic reflections.  
  
It will rest with the consideration of  
congress, also, whether a provident as well  
as fair encouragement would not be given  
to our navigation, by such reguiations as  
will place it on a level of competition with  
foreign vessels, particularly in transporting  
the important and bulky productions oi our  
own soil. The failure of equality and re-  
ciprocity in the existing regulations on this  
subject operated, in our ports, as a pre-  
mium to foreign competitors; and the in-  
convenience must increase, as these may be  
  
  
  
multipiied, under more fayorabie circum&gt;  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
tances, by the more than countervailing  
encouragements now given them, by the  
laws of their respective countries.  
  
Whilst it is universally admitted, that a  
well instructed people alone can be perma-  
nently a free people; and whilst it is evident  
that the means of diffusing and improving  
useful knowledge form so small a proportion  
of the expenditures for national purposes, I  
cannot presume it to be unseasonable to in-  
vite your attention to the advantages of su-  
peradding, to the means of education provid-  
ed by the several states, a seminary of learn-  
ing, constituted by the national legislature,  
within the limits of their exclusive jurisdic-  
tion; the expense of which might be defray-  
ed, or reimbursed, out of the vacant grounds  
which have accrued to the nation within those  
limits.  
  
Such an institution, though local in its le-  
gal character, would be universal in its be-  
neficial effects. By enlightening the opin-  
ions; by expanding the patriotism; and by as-  
similating the principles, the sentiments and  
the manners of those who might resort to  
this temple of science, to be re-distributed,  
in due time, through every part of the com-  
munity; sources of jealousy and prejudice  
would be diminished, the features of nation-  
al character would be multiplied, and great-  
er extent given to social harmony. But,  
above all, a well constituted seminary, in  
the centre ofthe nation, is recommended by  
the consideration, that the additional instruc-  
tion emanating from it would contribute not  
less to strengthen the foundations, than to  
adorn the structure, of our free and happy  
system of government.  
  
Among the commercial abuses still com-  
mitted under the American flag, and leaving  
in force my former reference to that subject,  
it appears that American citizens are instru-  
mental in carrying on a traffic in enslaved  
Africans, equally in violation of the laws of  
humanity, and in defiance of those of their  
own country. The same just and benevolent  
motives which produced the interdiction in  
force against this criminal conduct, will doubt-  
less be felt by congress, in devising further  
means of suppressing the evil.  
  
In the midst of uncertainties, necessarily  
connected with the great interests of the U.  
States, prudence requires a continuance of  
our defensive and precautionary arrange-  
ments. The secretary of war and secretary  
of the navy will submit the statements  
and estimates which may aid congress, in  
their ensuing provisions for the land and na-  
val forces. The statements of the latter will  
include a view of the transfers of appro-  
priations in the naval expenditures, and the |  
grounds on which they were made.  
  
  
  
PHILADELPHIA REPERTORY.  
  
The fortifications for the defence of our  
maritime frontier, have heen prosecuted ac-  
cording to the plan laid down in 1808. The  
works, with some exceptions, are complet-  
ed, and furnished with ordnance. Those for  
the security of the city of New York, though  
far advanced towards completion, will re-  
quire a further time and appropriation. This  
is the case with a few ethers, either not com-  
pleted, or in need of repairs.  
  
The improvement in quality and quantity  
made in the manufactory of cannon, and of  
small arms, both at the public armories and  
private factories, warrant additional confi-  
dence in the competency of those resources,  
for supplying the public exigencies.  
  
These preparations for arming the mili-  
tia, having thus far provided for one of the  
objects contemplated by the power vested in  
congress, with respect to that great bulwark  
of the public safety; it is for their considera-  
tion, whether further provisions are not re-  
quisite for the other contemplated objects of  
  
  
  
  
  
organization and discipline. To give to this |  
great mass of physical and moral force the |  
efficiency which it merits, and is capable of |  
receiving, it is indispensable that they should  
be instructed and practised in the rules by  
which they are to be governed. Towards an  
accomplishment of this important work, I  
recominend for the consideration of con-  
gress the expediency of instituting a system,  
which shall, in the first instance, call into  
the field, at the public expense, and for a  
given time, certain portions of the commis-  
sioned and noncommissioned officers. The  
instruction and discipline thus acquired,  
would gradually diffuse through the entire  
body of the militia that practical knowledge  
and promptitude for active service, which are  
the great ends to be pursued. Experience  
has left no doubt, either of the necessity, or  
of the efficacy, of competent military skill,  
in those portions of an army, in fitting it for  
the final duties which it may-have to perform.  
  
The corps of engineers, with the military  
  
  
  
academy, are entitled to the early attention  
of congress. The buildings at the seat fixed |  
by law for the present academy, are so far  
in decay as not to afford the necessary ac-|  
commodation. But a revision of the law is ect  
commended, principally with a view to a  
more enlarged cultivation and diffusion of  
the advantages of such institutions, by pro-  
viding professorships for all the necessary  
branches of military instruction, and by the  
establishment of an additional academy at the  
seat of government or elsewhere. The means  
by which war, as well for defence, as for of- |  
fence, are now carried on, render these |  
schools of the more scientific operations an |  
  
  
  
indispensable part’ of every adequate system. |  
  
  
  
Even among nations whose large stand-  
ing armies and frequent wars afford every  
other opportunity of instruction, these estab-  
lishments are found to be indespensable, for  
the due attainment of the branches of mili-  
tary science, which require a regular course  
of study and experiment. In a government,  
happy without the other opportunities, semi-  
naries, where the elementary principles of  
war can be taught without actual war and  
without the expense of extensive and standing  
armies, have the precious advantage of uni-  
ting an essential preparation against external  
danger, with a scrupulous regard to internal  
safety. In no other way, probably, can a pro-  
vision, of equal efficacy for the public defence,  
be made at so little expense, or more con-  
sistentiy with the public liberty.  
  
The receipts into the treasury during the  
year ending on the 30th of September last  
(and amounting to more than eight millions  
and a half of dollars) have exceeded the cur-  
rent expense of the government, including  
the interest on the public debt. For the pur-  
  
pose of reimbursing at the end of the year-  
  
3,750,000 dollars of the principal, a loan as  
authorised by law, had been negociated to  
that amount; but has since been reduced to  
2,750,000 dollars, the reduction being per-  
mited by the state of the treasury; in which  
  
there will be a balance, remaining at the end ~  
  
of the year, estimated at 2,000,000 dollars.  
For the probable receipts of the next year,  
and other details, I refer to statements which  
will be transmitted from the treasury, and  
which will enable you to judge what further  
provisions may be necessary for the ensuing  
years.  
  
Reserving for future occasions, in the  
course of the session, whatever other com-  
munications may claim your attention, I close  
the present, by expressing my reliance, under  
the blessing of Divine Providence, on the  
judgement and patriotism which will guide  
your measures, at a period particularly cal-  
ling for united councils, and inflexible ex-  
ertions, for the Welfare of our country, and  
by assuring you of the fidelity and alacrity  
with which my co-operation will be afforded.

fellow Citizens of the Senate, and  
cf the House of Representatives,  
  
The enbarrassments which have prevailed in our foreign  
retations, and so much employed the celiberations of Con-  
gress, make it a primary duty, in meeting you, to communi-  
cate whatever may have occurred, in that branch of our na-  
tional aiTaies.  
  
‘bhe act of the last session of Congress “ concerning the  
commercial intercourse between the United States and Great  
Britain and France and their dependencies” having invited,  
iv &amp; new form, a terminatiow of their edicts against our neu-  
tral commerce, cies of the acts were immediately forward  
ed to our ministers at London and Paris} with a view that  
its cbiect might be within the-early attention of the French  
an: British governments.  
  
Sy this communication received through our minister at Pa-

government, Was followed by a declaration that the Berlin  
and Milan decrees were revoked, and would cease to have  
effect on the first dav of November ensuing. These being the

act, and the revocation of them being such that they ceased

prescribed by law, was announced by a proclamation bearing  
date the second day of November  
  
It would have well accorded with the conciliatory views, in-  
dicated by this proceeding on the part of France, to have ex-  
tended them to all the grounds of just complaint, which now  
reiaain unadjusted with the United States. It was particular-

of the property of our citizens seized uncer a misapplication  
of the principle of reprisals, combined with a’ misconstruction  
of a law of the United States.—This expection has not been  
fulfilled. ’  
  
From the British government no communication on the sub-  
ject of the act-has beew received. To a communication from  
our minister at Londom of the revocation, by the French go-  
vernment, ‘of its Berlin and Milan decrees, it was answered  
that the Britisli system would be relinquished as ‘soon as the  
repeal of the French decrees should have actually taken ef-  
feet, and the commerce of neutral nations have been restored  
to the condition in whichit stood, previously to the promulga-

cessarily import, does not exclide the intention of relinquish-

States is the rather te be looked for, inasmuch as the block-  
ades in-question, being not move contrary to the established  
law. of mations, than inconsistent’ With the rules of blockade  
formerly recognised by Great Britain herself, could have no  
alleged basis, other than the plea of retaliation, alledged as  
the basis of the orders in council. Under the modification o/  
the original orders of November 1207, into the. orders of  
April 1802, there is indi cd scarcely a nominal distinction be-  
  
IS Pad ha  
  
tween the orders and the blockades. One of those illegiti_  
mate blockades, bearing date in May 1806, having been ex  
pressly avowed to be still unrescinded, and to be in effect,  
comprehended in the orders of council, was too distinctly  
brought within the purview of the act of Congress, not to be  
comp:cended in the explanation of the requisites to a com-  
pliance ith it. The British government was accordingly  
apprised by our minister near it, that such was the light in  
which the subject was to be regarded. ;  
  
On the other important subjects depending-between the U.  
States and that government, no progress has been made, from  
which an early and satisfactory result can be relied on.  
  
In this new posture of our relations with those powers, the  
consideration of Congress will be properly turned to a removal  
of doubts which may occur in the expositiop, and of difficulties  
in the execution of the act above cited.  
  
The commerce of the United States with the North of Eu-  
rope, heretofore much vexed by licentious cruizers, particu-  
larly under the Danish flag, haslaterly been visited with fresh  
and extensive depredations. The measures pursued in behalt  
of our injured citizens, not having obtained justice for them,  
a further and more formal interposition with the Danish gov-  
ernment is contemplated.” The principles which have been  
maintained by that government in relation to neutral com-  
merce, and the friendly profession of his Danish majesty tow-  
ards the United States,‘are valuable pledges in favour of a  
successful isste.  
  
Among the events growing out of the state of the Spanish  
monarchy, pur attention was imperiously attracted to the  
change, developing itself in that portion of West Florida, which  
though of right,appertaining to the United States, had remain-  
ed in the ‘possession of Spain ; awaiting the result of negocia-  
tions for its actual delivery tothem. The Spanish authority  
was subverted, and a situation produced, exposing the coun-  
try to ulterior events which essentially affect the rights and  
welfare of the Union. In such a conjuncture, I did not delay  
the ‘interposition required for the occupancy of the territory  
West of the river Perdido, to which the title of the United  
States extends, and to which tht laws, pre: “led for the terri-  
tory of Orleang, are applicable. With th: view, the procla-  
mation, of which a copy is laid before you, was confided to the  
governor of that territory, to be carried into effeet. The  
legality and necessity of the course pursued, assure me of the  
favourabte light. in which it will present itself to the Legisla-  
ture ; and of the promptitugle in which they will supply what-  
ever provisions may be due to the essential rights and equita-  
ble interests of the people thus brought into the bosom of the  
American family.  
  
Our amity with the powers of Barbary, with the exception  
of a recent occurrence at Tunis, of which an explanation is  
just received, appears to have been uninterrupted, and iohave  
become more firmly established.  
  
}~ With the Indian tribes also, the peace and friendship of the  
United ‘States are found to be eligible, that the general dispo-  
sition to preserve both, continues to gain strength.  
  
‘I feel patticular ‘satisfaction in remarking, that an interior  
, Vietv-of cur Country presentsus with grateful procfs of its sub-  
stantial and increasing prosperity. To a thriving agriculture  
and the improvements related to it, is added, a lighly iater-  
esting extension of useful manufactures ; the combined product  
  
  
  
  
  
of professional occupations, and of household industry. Such,  
  
inceed, is the experience of economy, as well as of policy, ip  
  
  
  
i el  
  
  
  
  
  
Pp  
it r supplics heretofore obtained by foreign f  
¢, that, in a national view, the change is justly re-  
s of t more than a recompense for those priva-  
  
1 losses resulting from foreign injustice, which furnish-  
impulse required for its accomplishment. How  
be expedient to guard the infancy of this improre-  
listr:bation of labor, by regulations of the commer  
subject which cannot fail to suggest itself to  
riotic rehections.  
t With the consideration of congress also, whether  
as well as fair encouragement, would not be gi-  
havi ration, by such regulations as will place on a  
el of competion with foreign vessels, particularly in trans-  
, the important and balky productions of cur own soil.  
‘lure of equality and reciprocity in the existing regula  
s on Uns suljcet eperates, in our ports, as a premium to  
rh cCompeutors ; and the inconvenience must increase, as  
may be multiplied, under more favourable circum-  
snces, by the more than countervailing encouragements now  
sven them, by the laws of their respective countries.  
Whiist it is universally admitted that a well instructed  
: yoople alone can be permanently a free people ; and whiist it  
is evident that the means of diffusing and improving usefui  
«nowledge form so small.a proportion of the expenditures for  
national purposes, 1 cannot presume it to be unseasonable, to  
ovice your attention to the advantages of superadding, to the  
micins of education provided by the several states, a seminary  
of lcarning, instituted by the national legislature, within the  
Imits of their exclusive jurisdiction: the expence of which  
might be defraved, or reimbursed, out of the vacant grounds  
which have accrued to the nation within those limits.  
Sech an institution, though local in its legal character,  
would be universal in its beneficial effects. By enlightening  
‘ opinions; by expanding the patriotism ; and by assimilat-  
ng the principles, the sentimenjs and the manners of those  
‘lo might resort to this temple of science, to be redistributed  
) due time, through every part of the community : sources of  
lousy and prejudice would be diminished, the features of  
national character would be multiplied, and greater extent  
sivea to social harmony. But above all, a well constituted  
seminary, in te centre of the nation, is recommended by the  
consideration, that the additioual instruction emanating from  
‘t would contribute not dess to strengthen the foundations, than  
‘o adorn the structure, of our free and happy system of govern-

nat subject, it appears that American citizens are instru-  
viental in carrying on a traffic in enslaved Africans, equally in  
\.olation ef the laws of humanity, and in defiance of those of  
‘heir own country. The same just and benevolent motives  
watch produced the interdiction in force against this criminal  
comJuct, will doubtless be felt by Congress, in devising further  
ms Of suppressing the evil.  
  
in the midst of uncertainties, necessarily connected with  
wreat interests of the United States, prudence requires a  
« otinuance of our defensive and precautionary arrangements  
ihe Secretary of War and Seeretary of the Navy will sub-  
init the statements and estimates which may aid Congress,  
1 their ensuing provisions for the land and naval forces. The  
statements of the latter will include a view of the transfers  
«t appropriations in the naval expenditures, and the grounds  
  
on Which they are made.  
f ‘The fortifications for the defence of our maritime frontier  
; 1.ve been prosecuted according to the plan laid down in 1868.  
i ie works, with ‘some exceptions, are completed and fur-  
} ished with ordinance. ‘Those for the security of the City of  
: New-York, though far advanced towards completion, will  
; i jaire a further time and appropriation. This is the case  
  
vith a few others, either not completed, or in need of repairs.  
  
  
  
: ‘The improvements, in quality, and quantity, made in the  
nianufacte ry of cannon; and of small arms, both at the pub-  
i.c armorics,and private factories, warrant additional confi- r  
  
y+. vO  
  
  
  
  
  
dence in the competency of these resources, for supplying the  
public exigencies. &#x27;  
  
These preparations for arming the militia, having thus far  
provided for cne of the objects contemplated by the power  
vested in Congress, with respect to that great bulwark of the  
public safety ; it is for their consideration whether further  
provisions are not requisite, for the other contemplated objects,  
organization and discipline. To give to this great mass ¢t  
physical and moral force, the efficiency which it merits, wad  
is capable of receiving ; it is indispensable that they should be  
instructed and practised in the rules by which they are to be  
governed. Towards an accomplishment of this important work,  
i recommend for the consideration of Congress the expedien-  
cy of instituting a system, which shall, in the first instance,  
call into the field, at the public expence, and for a given time,  
certain portions of the commissioned and non-commissioned  
officers. The instruction and discipline thus acquired would  
gradually diffuse through the entire body of the militia and  
practical knowledge and promptitude for active service,  
which are the great ends to be pursued. Experience has left  
no doubt, either for the necessity, or the efficacy, of compe-  
tent military skill in those portions of an army, in fitting it  
for the final duties, which it may have to perform.  
  
The corps of Engineers, with the Military Academy, are  
entitled to the early attention of Congress. The Buildings at  
the Seat, fixt by law, for the present Academy, are so far in  
decay, as not to afford the necessary accommodation. Buta  
revision of the law is recommended, principally with a view to  
a more enlarged cultivation and diffusion of the advantages of  
such institutions, by providing professorships for all the neces-  
sary branches of military instruction, and by the establishment  
of an additional Atademy, at the Seat of Government, or  
elsewhere. ‘The means by which war, as well for defence, as  
for offence, are now carried on, render these schools of the  
more scientific operations an indispensable part of every ade-  
quate system. ‘he among nations whose large standing ar-  
mies and frequent wars afford every other opportunity of in-  
struction, these establishments are feund to be inpispensable,  
for the due attainment of the branches of military science,  
which require a regular course of study and experiment. In  
a government, happily without the other opportunities; Semi-  
naries, where the elementary principles of the art of war can  
be taught without actual war and without the expence of ex-  
tensive and standing armies, have the precious advantage of  
uniting an essential preparation against external danger, with  
a scrupulous segard to internal _iie. In no other way, prob-  
ably, can a provision, of equal efficacy for the public defence,  
be made at so little expence, or more consistently with the  
public liberty. .  
  
The receipts into the Treasury during the year ending on  
the 30th of September last (and amounting to more than eight  
millions and a half of dollars) have exceeded the current ex-  
pences of the Government, including the interest on the pub-  
lic debt. For the purpose of reimbursing at the enc of the  
vear 3,750,000 dollars of the principal, a loan, as authorised by  
law, had been negociated to that amount ; but has since been  
reduced to 2,750,000 dollars; the reduction being permitted  
by the state of the Treesury ; in which there will be a balance  
remaining at the end of the year, estimated at 2,000,000 dolls.  
For the probable receipts of the next year, and other details, I  
refer the statements which will be transmitted from the Trea-  
sury, and which will enable you to judge what further provis-  
ons may be necessary for the ensuing years. -  
  
Reserving for future occasions, in the course of the session,  
whatever other communications may claim your attention, I  
close the present, by expressing my reliance, under the bless-  
ing of Divine Providence on the judgment and patriotism  
which will guide your measures, at a period particularly call-  
ing for united Councils, and inflexible exertions, for the wel-  
fare of our country, and by assuring you of the fidelity and  
alacrity with which my co-operation will be afforded.

Among the event* growing out of toe state of  
the Spanish monarchy Our attention was imperious­  
ly attracted to the change developing itself in that  
portion of West Florida, which though of right ap­  
pertaining to the U. States, had remained in the pos­  
session of Spain, awaiting the result of negotiations  
•for its actual delivery to them. The Spanish autho­  
rity was subverted ; and a situation produced expo­  
sing the country t» ulterior events, which might  
essentially affect the rights and welfare of the uni­  
on. In such a conjuncture, I did not delay the in­  
terposition required for the occupancy of the terri­  
tory west of the river Perdido, to which the title  
of the United States extends, and to which the  
laws provided for the territory of Orleans are appli­  
cable. With this view, the proclamation, a copy  
of which is laid before you, was ronfideJ to the go­  
vernor of that territory to be earned into effect.—  
The legality and necessity of the course pursu­  
ed, assure me of the favourable light in which it  
will present itself to the legislature, and of the  
promptitude with which they will supply whatever  
provision^may be due to the essential rights aod e­  
quitabie interests of the people thus brought into  
the bosom of the American family.  
Our aunty with the powers of Barbary, with  
the exception of a recent occurrence at Tunis, of  
which sn explanation is just received, appears to  
have been uninterrupted and to have become more  
firmly established.  
With the Indian tribes also the peace and friend­  
| ship of the United States are found to be so eligible,  
that the general disposition to preserve both conti­  
nues to gain strength.  
1 feel particular satisfaction in remarking that an  
interior view of our country presents us with grate­  
ful proofs of its substantial and increasing prosperi­  
ty. To a thriving agriculture and the improve­  
ments related to it, is added a highly interesting  
extension of useful manufactures; the combined  
product of professional occupations, and of house­  
hold industry. Such indeed is the experience of a­  
ronomy, as well as policy, in these substitutes for  
.supplies heretofore obtained by foreign commerce,  
that in a national view the change is justly regatded  
as of itself more than a rerompence tor those priva­  
tions and losses resulting Iroin foreign injustice,  
which lurnisbtd the genera) impulse required lor its  
accromplishrnent. How far it may be expedient to  
guard the infancy of tbis improvement in the dis­  
tribution of labour, by regulations of the commer­  
cial tariff, is a subject which cannot fail to suggest  
itself lo your patriotic reflections.  
It will rest with tbe consideration of congress also  
whether a provident as well as fair encouragement  
would not be given to our navigation by such regu­  
lations as will place it on a level of competition with  
foreign vessels, particulaily in transporting the im­  
portant and bulky productions of our own soil.—  
The failure of equality and reciprocity in the exist­  
tng regulations on this subject operates, in our  
ports, as a premium to foreign competitors; and  
the inconvenience must rucrease, as these may be  
multiplied, under more favourable circumstances,  
by the more than countervailing encouragements  
now given them, by the laws of their respective  
countries. 4  
Whilst it is universally admitted that a well in­  
structed people alone can be permanently a free peo­  
ple ; and whilst it is evident that the means of dif­  
fusing and improving useful knowledge form so  
small a proportion of the expenditures for national  
purposes, 1 cannot preaume it lobe unseasonable,  
to invite, your attention to the advantages of su­  
prradding, to the means of education provided by  
the several stales, a seminary of learning, instituted  
by the national legislature, within the limits of their  
exclusive jurisdiction; the expence of which might  
be delrayed.or reimbursed,out of the vacant grounds  
which have accrued to the nation within tboie  
limits.  
  
s Such an institution, though local in it* legal cha­  
racter, would he universal in its beneficial effects.—  
By enlightening the opinions ; by expanding the  
patriotism ; and by assmiulating the principles, the  
sentiments and the inann. rs of those who might re­  
sort to this temple of erience, to be re-distributed,  
in due time, through every part of the community ;  
sources of jealousy and prejudice would bedimiqish­  
ed, the features ol national character would be mul­  
tiplied, and greater extent given&#x27;to social harmony.  
But above all, a well constituted seminary, in the  
centre of the nstion, is reronwiended by the consi­  
deration that the additional instruction emanating  
liom it, would contribute not less to strengthen the  
foundation, than to adorn the structure of our free  
and happy system of government. . v  
Among the commercial abuses still committed  
under the American flag, and leaving in force my  
former reference to that subject, it appears that A­  
mencan citizens are instrumental in earring on a  
traflirk in enslaved Africans, equally in violation of  
the laws of liumatiity, and in defiance of those of  
their own country. The same just and benevolent  
motives which produced the interdiction in foire  
against this criminal conduct, will doubtless be felt  
by congress in devising further meaus of suppress­  
iiigthe*yil.&#x27;;;wV£4&gt;.i*&gt;A ui&#x27;­

ii i* wdispensmle tout they should be instructed  
and practised in the rules by which they “are to be  
governed. Towards an accomplishment of this  
i important work, I recommend for the considera­  
&#x27; lion of congress the expediency of instituting a  
1 system, which shall, in the first instance, call iu­  
to the field, at the public expense, and for a given  
time, certain portions of the commissioned arjd un­  
commissioned officers. The instruction and disci­  
pline thus arquired would gradually diffuse through  
the entire body of the militia that practical know,  
ledge and promptitude for active service, which are  
the great ends to be pursued. Experience bag left  
no doubt, eitberof the necessity, or of the efficacy,  
of competent military skill, in those portions of  
an army, in fitting it for the final duties, which it  
may have to perform. J  
The corps of engineers, with the military acade­  
my, are entitled to the early attention of congress.  
The buildings at the seat, fixed by law, for the pre­  
sent academy, are so fur in decay, as not to afford  
the necessary accommodation. But a revision of  
the law is recommended,-principally with a view  
to a more enlarged cultivation and diffusion of the  
advantages of such institutions, by providing pro­  
fessorships for all the,necessary branches of milita­  
ry instruction, and by the establishment of an ad­  
ditional academy, at the seat of government, or else­  
where. The means by which war, as .well for de­  
fence, as for offence, are now carried on, render  
these schools of the more scientific operations an  
indispensible part of every adequate system. Even  
among lotions whose Urge standing armies and  
frequent wars afford every other opportunity of in­  
struction, these establishments are found to he in  
dijpensible for the due attainment of the branches  
of military scfhnre, which require a regular course of  
study and experiment. In a government, happily  
without the other opportunities, seminaries, where  
the elementary principles of the art of war can be  
taught withoutactual war and wilhnutthe expense of  
extensive and standing armies, have the precious ad­  
vantage of umtiiiganessential preparation against ex­  
ternal danger, with a scrupulous regard to internal  
safety. In no other way, pmbably, can a provision  
of equal efficacy for the pubiirk defence be made at  
so little expense or more consistently with the pub­  
lick liberty.  
The rereipts into the treasury during the year  
ending on the 30lh of September last (snd amount­  
ing to more than eight millions and a half of dollars)­  
have exceeded the current expenses of the Govern­  
ment, including the interest on the public debt. For  
the purpose of reimbursing at the end of the year  
3,750,000 dollars of the principal, a loan at au­  
thorized by law, had been negocialed to that  
amount: but has since been reduced to 2,730,000  
dollars; the reduction being permitted by the state  
of the treasury ; in which there will he a balance,  
remaining at the end of the year, estimated at*  
2,000,000 dollars. For the probable receipts of  
1 hr next year, and. other details, I refer to state  
ments which will be transmitted from the treasury,  
and which will enable you to judge what further pro­  
visions may be necessary for the eusuing years.  
Reserving for future occasions, in the course of  
the session, whatever other communications may  
claim your attention, I close the present, by ex­  
pressing my reliance, under the blessing of Divine  
Provideuce on the judgment and patriotism which  
will guide your measures, at a period particularly  
culling for united councils, and inflexible exertions  
for the welfare of our country ; and by assuring you  
of the fidelity and alacrity with which my co-ope­  
ration will be afforded.

Fellow Citizens of the Senate, aud of the House of Representatives, -  
The embarraflments which have prevailed in our foreign  
relations, and so much employed the deliberations of Congrets,  
~makeit a primary duty, in meeting you, to communicate what­  
ever may have ofcurred in that branch of cur national affajrs.  
The act of the last feflion of Congress ‘concerning the com­  
mercial intercourse between the United States and Great Britain  
and France and their dependencies,” having invited, in a new  
form, a termination of their edi&amp;s against our . neutral com­  
merce, copies of the- acts ‘were” immediately forwarded to our  
ministers at London and Paris; with a view that its obje&amp;t  
might be within the early attention of the French and British  
governments. g  
By the communication received through our minister at  
Paris, it appeared, that a knowledge of the a&amp;.by the French  
government, was followed by a declaration that the Berlin and  
Milar: decrees were revoked, and would cease to have effeét on  
the firft day of November ensuing, These being ‘the only  
known edi&amp;ts of France, within the description of the a&amp;, and  
the revocation of them being such that they ceased, at that date,  
to violate our neutral commerce; the fadt, as preicribed by  
law, was announced by a proclamation bearing date the {fecond  
day of November. B ~ ity %  
1t would have well accorded with the conciliatory views, in­  
dicated by this proceeding on the part of France, to have ex­  
tended them to all the grounds of just complaint, which now.  
remain vnadjufted with the United States. It was particularly  
anticipated that, as a further evidence of&#x27; just dispositions to­  
wards them, restoration would have been immediately made of  
the property of our citizéns seized under a misapplication of  
the principle of reprisals, combined with a miifconitruction of a  
law of the U. States. T&#x27;his expectation has not been tulfilled.  
From the Britith government no communication on the fub­  
jeét of the act has been received. “To a communication from  
our minister in London of the fevocation; by the French gov­  
ernment, of its Berlin and Milan decrees, 1t wus answered that  
the British system would be relinquithed as soon as the repedl  
of the French decrees thould have actually taken effe@, and the  
commerce of neutral nations have been reflored to the condi­  
tion in which it stood, previously to the promulgation of those  
decrees. - This pledge, although it dees not necefiarily import,  
does not exclude the intention of relinquithing, along with  
‘the orders in council, the pradice of those novel ‘blockades  
which have a like effet of Interrupting our neutral comimerce.  
—And this futher justice to the United States is the rather to  
be looked for, inalmuch as the blockades in queflion, being  
not more contrary to the eftablithed law of nations, than in­  
consistent with the rules of blockade formerly recognifed by  
Great-Britain herfelf, could have no.alledged basis, other than’  
the plea of retaliation, alledged as the basis of the orders ‘in  
council. Under the modificarion of the original oerders of Nov.  
1807, into the orders‘of April 1809, there is indeed scarcely a  
nominal di’&amp;in&amp;;gm between the orders and the blockades.—  
One of those illegitimate blockades, bearing date in May 1806,  
having been exprefsl%; avowed to be fill unrefcinded, and to be  
in effect, comprehended in the orders in council, was too dis  
tinctly brought within the purview of the ad of Congress, not  
50 be comprehended in the explanation of the requisites to a  
compliance with it. The Britith government was accordingly  
apprised by our minister near it, that such” was. the light in  
which the subject was to.be regarded. e  
Ohn the other important fubjeéts - depending between the U.  
States and that government, no progress has begn made, .fgbm .‘  
which an early and {atisfaétory result can be relied on. 5  
~ln this new posture of our relations with those powers, the  
consideration of Congress wili be properly turned to a removal.  
of dagbts which may occur in the exposition; and of difficulties:  
in the execution of the ac above cited. S S  
“The commerce of the United States with the North of Fu­  
rope, heretofore much vexed by licentiows cruisers, particularly.  
under the Danish flag, has latterly been -visited with frefh and  
extensive depredations. - The measures pursued in behalf of our  
injured citizens not having obtained julice for them, a further  
anid more formal interpalition ¥ich ihe Danilh government is  
eontemplaied. Lhe principies which have been maintajned by  
that governhent in relation to neutral comifierce, and the  
driendly profeflions of his Danith Majesty towards the United  
uateh, are valuable pledges in favor of a fuccesful ifoe. . - .

‘acual delivery to thei, - The Spanish authority was subverted ;  
‘and a situation produced, exposing the country to ulterior  
-eventswhich effentialiy affe@ the rights &amp; welfare of the Union.  
In such a ¢onjunéture, 1 did not delay the interposition required  
for the occupancy of the territory weft of the river Perdito ;  
to which the gitle of the United States extends, and to which  
the laws, provided for the terrifory of Orleans, ave applicable.  
With this view, the proclamation, of which a copy is laid be­  
fore you, was confided to the governor of that territory, to be  
carried into effe@. The legality and neceflity of the course  
pursued, assure me of the favorable light in which it will pre­  
sent itfelf to the legislature ; and of the premptitude, in which  
they will supply whatever provisions may be due&#x27;to the eflen­  
tial rights and equitable interest of the people thus brought  
‘into the bosom of the American family. &#x27;  
Our amity with the Powers of Barbary, with the exception  
of a recent occurrenice at Tunisy of which an explanation is just  
received, appears to have been uninterrupted, and to have be­  
come more {irmly éftablithed. \ . ‘  
With the Indian tribes, also, the peace and friendfhip of the  
United States are found to be {o eligible, that the general dis­  
position to preserve both continues to gain strength.  
I feel particular fatisfaction in remarking that an interios  
view of our country presents us with gratefulproofs of its sub-  
Atantial and increasing prosperity. ~10 a thriving agriculture,  
and the improvements related to it, is add=d a highly intereft­  
_ing eXtenfion of ufetul manufactures ; the combined produé  
of profeflional occupations, and of household industry. Such  
indeed is the experience of economy, as well as of policy, in  
these fubftitures for supplies heretofore obtained by foreign  
commerce, that, in a national point of view, the change lis juit­  
ly regarded as of itfelf more than a recompence for those pri­  
vaions and losses resulting from foreign ‘injuftice, which fur­  
nithed the gencral impulse required for its accompeithment.  
How far it may be expedient to guard the infancy of this im­  
provement in the distribution of labor, by regulations of com.  
mercial tariff, is a fubje@ which cannot fail to suggest itfelf to  
-your patriotic refle@ions. a ‘ ;  
It will rest with the consideration of Congress, also, whether  
a provideént; as well as fair encouragement, would not be giv­  
en to our navigation, by such regulations as will place it on a  
level of competition with foreign veflels, particularly in trans.  
porting the important and bulky producions ¢f our own foil,  
The failure of equality and reciprocity in the existing regula­  
tions on this fubjeét operates, in our ports, as a premium to  
foreign competitors ; and the inconvenience must increase, as  
these may be multiplied, under more favourable circum{tances,  
by the more than countervailing encouragements now given  
them by the laws of their respective countries. g  
- Whillt it is universally admitted, that a well infiru@ed peo­  
ple alozie can be permanently a free people ; and whilst it 1s  
evident thit the means of diffufing and improving ufeful  
knowledge form so small a proportion of the expenditures for  
national purposes, I cannot presume it to be unseasonable to  
invite your attentien to the advantages of fuperadding to the  
means of education provided by the fcveral {rates, a_feminary  
of learning; inflituted by the national legislature, within the  
kmits of their exclusive jurisdiction ; the expence of which  
might be defrayed, or retmburied, out of the vacant grounds  
which have accrued to thenation within those limits.  
Such an inflitution, though local in its legal charaéer, would  
be universal in its beneficial effeéts. By enlightening the opia­  
ions.: by expanding the patriotism : and. by aflimilating the  
principles, the sentiments and the manners of those who might  
resort to this temple of {cience, to be re.diftributed in due time  
through every part of the community ; sources of jealousy and  
prejudice would be diminithed, the features of pational char.  
acter would be multiplied, and greater extent given to social  
harmony. But abeve all a well constituted seminary, in the  
centre of the nation, is recommended by the consideration that  
the additional infiru&amp;ion emanating from it would coreribute  
not less to strengthen the foundations, than to adorn the firuc­  
ture of our free and happy fyflem of government. . .  
Among the commercial abuses still committed under the  
American flagyand leaving in force my former reference to  
that fubje&amp;, it appears that American citizens are infirumental  
in carrying on a traffic in «nflaved &quot; Africans, equally in viola­  
tion of the laws of humanity, and in defiance of those of their  
own country. “The fame just and benevolent motives which  
‘produced the interdition in force against this criminal conduct,  
‘will doubtless be felt by congress, in devising further means of  
fuppréfling the evil. ) = oo Vi g i  
In the midst of uncertaintécs, neceflarily conneéted with the  
great intercfts of the United States, pruderice requires a con­  
tinuance-of ourdefenfive and precautionary arrangements. 1 he  
-Secretary ‘of War, and the Secrctaay of the Navy will submit  
‘the statements and estimates which may aid congress in theif  
wenfuing proyifions’ for the land and naval force. The state­

have been prosecuted according to the plan laid down in 1868,  
“The works, with lome exceptions, are com ple&quot;ted;e{nd.ﬁlmif&amp;hed  
with ordnance. Those for the security of the city -of New-  
York, though. far advanced towards completion, will-tcquire a  
further time and appropriation. = This is the case with ‘a few  
‘others, either not completed or in need of repair.  
Theimprovements, in quality and in quantity, made in the  
‘manufactory of cannon and finall arms, both at the public arm­  
‘ories and private factories, warrant addisional confidence fn the  
competcaicyof those relousoes, forfappiying theptblicesigengie.

ftructed jmdprzéﬁfe&amp;ifftiwﬂt}m  
by which they are to be governed.  
Towards an accomplishment of  
this Important work, 1 recom­  
mend for the consideration of con­  
gress, the expediency of inflituti ng  
a system, which&#x27; thall, in the firff  
instance, call into the field, at the  
public expence, -and for a given-’  
time, certain portions of the com­  
miflioned and non-commissioned  
officers. The inftruétion and dis  
ciplinc thus acquircd would gradu­  
allydiffufe through the entire body  
of the militia a practical knowledge  
and promptitude for adtive service;  
‘which are the great ends to be pur­  
{ued. Experience has left no doubt  
either of the neceflity, or the effis  
cacy, of competent military skill  
in those portions of an army, in  
fitting it for the final duties, which  
it may have to perform.  
The corps of Engineers, with  
the Military Academy, afe enti:  
tled to the early atténtion of Con­  
gress. The Buildings at the Seat,  
hixt by law, for the present Acad­  
emy, are {o far in decay, as not  
to afford the néceflary accommo­  
dation. Buta revision of the law  
1s recommended, principally with  
a view to a more enlarged cultiva­  
tion and diffufion of the advan.  
tages of such institutions, by pro­  
viding profeflorfhips for all the ne­  
ceflary branches of military inftruc.  
tion, and by the eflablifhment of  
an additional Academy, at the Seat  
of Government or efewhere. The  
means by which war, as welil for  
defence, as for offence, are now  
carried on, render these {chools of  
the morefcientificoperations an in­  
dispensable part of.every adequate  
system. Even among nations  
whose large standing armjes and  
frequent wars dfford every other  
opportunity of infitruction,thefe ef­  
tablithments are found to be indis­  
pensable, for the duc attainment of  
the branches of military science,  
which require a regular course of  
study and experiment.-—ln a Gov­  
.ernment, happily without the oth­  
er opportunities,Seminaries,where  
the elementary principles of the art  
of war can be taught without actu­  
al war and without the expence of  
¢xtenfive and standing armies, have  
the precious advantage of uniting  
.an eflential preparation against ex­  
ternal danger with a scrupulous  
regard to internal fafety. In no  
~other way, probably, can a provi­  
sion, of equal efficacy for the public  
defence, be made at so little ex­  
pence, or more consistently with  
the public liberty. -  
__Lhe receipts into the Treasury  
during the year ending on the

mounting to more than cight mil­

ational affairs. :  
&quot; The act of the laté session of Con  
  
gress “ concefning the commercial inter-  
course between the U. States and G.  
Britain and France and their dependen+  
cies” having invited in a new form, a  
termination of their edicts against our  
heutral commerce, copies of the act were  
immediately forwarded to our ministers  
at London and Paris ; with a view that  
its object might be within. the early at-  
tention of the French and British govern-  
ments. é P  
  
By the communication — received  
through our minister at Paris, it appear  
ed that a knowledge of the act by the  
French Government, was followed by a  
declaration that the Berlin and Milan  
Decrees were tevoked, and would cease  
to have effect on the first day of Novem-  
. ber ensuing. These being the only  
’ known edicts of France, within the de-  
scription of the act, and the revocation  
of them being such that they ceased, at  
that date, to violate our neutral coin-  
merce ; the fact, as prescribed by  
law, announced by a proclamation bear-  
ing date the 2d day of November.  
  
it would have well accorded with the  
conciliatory views, indicated by this  
procecdiag on the part of France, to  
have extended them to all the grounds  
of just complaint; which now remain  
unadjusted with the United States. It  
was particularly anticipated that as fur-  
ther evidence of just dispositions to-  
wards them, restoration would have been  
immediately made of the property of our  
citizens seized under a miszppiication  
of the principles of reprisals, combined  
with a misconstruction of a law of the {&#x27;.  
States. This expectation has not been  
fulfilled  
  
From the British Government no  
communication on the subjéct of the act  
has been received. To a communica-  
tion from our minister at London of the  
revocation, by the French Government,  
of its Berlin and Milan Decrees, it was  
answered that the British system would  
be relinquished as soon as the repewi of  
the French Decrees should have actuai-  
ly taken effect, and the commerce of  
neutral nations heve been restored to  
the conditions in which it stood previ-  
ously to the promulgation of tnose de-  
crees. This pledge, although it does  
not necessarily import, does not exciuce  
the intention of relinquishiag, along with  
the Orders in Council, the practice of  
those novel blockades which have alike  
effect of interrupting our neutral com-  
merce. And this further justice to the  
United States is the rather to be looked  
for, inasmuch as the blockades in ques-  
tion, being not more contrary to the es-  
tablished law of nations, than inconsts-  
tent with the rules of blockade fermerly  
recognized by G. Britain herself, could  
have no alledged basis, other than the  
plea. of retaliation alledged as the basts  
ofthe orders in Council. Under the  
modification of ‘the original orders of  
Nov. 1807, into the orders of-April 1809,  
there is indced scarcely a nominal dis-  
tinction between the orders and the  
blockades. One of those illegitimate  
blockades, bearing date in May 1806,  
having been expressly avowed to be  
still unrescinded, and to be in effect,  
eomprehended in the orders ia council,  
was too distinctly brought within the  
purview of the act of Congress, not to be  
comprehended in the expianation of the  
requisites to a compliance with it. The  
British Government was accordingly ap-  
prized by our minister near it, that such  
was the jight in which the subject was  
to be regarded.  
  
On the other important subjects de-  
pending between the U. States and that  
Government, no progress has been made,  
from which an early satisfactory result  
can be relied on.  
  
In this new posture of our relations with  
those powers, the considcration of Con-  
gress will be properly turned to a re-  
moval of doubts which may occur in the  
exposition, and of difficulties in the exe-  
eution of the act above citcd.  
  
The commerce of the United States  
with the North of Europe, heretofore  
much vexed by licentious cruisers, par-  
Eeulany under the Danish flag, has lat-  
#:rly been vis&#x27;sd with fresh and exten-  
sive depredations. The measures pur-  
sued in behalf of our injured citizens not  
having obtained justice for them, a fur-  
ther and more formal i -terposition with  
the Danish government is cotemplated.  
The principles which have been main-  
tuined by that government in relation to  
neutral ecommerce, and the friendly pro-  
fessions of his Danish Majesty towards  
the United States, are valuable pledges,  
in favor of a successful issue.  
  
Among the events growing out of the  
state of the Spanish Monarchy, our atten-  
tion was imperiously attracted to the  
change developing itself in that portion  
of West Fiorida which, though of right  
appertaining te the United S:ates, had  
remained in the possession of Spain ; a-  
waiting the result of negociations for its  
actual deitverg to them. Tue Spanish  
autiority was subverted, and a sitnation

_ feel particular satisfaction in remark:  
ing that an interior view of our country  
presents us with grateful proofs of its  
substantial and increasing prosperity.  
Toa thriving agriculture, and the im-  
provements related to it, is added a high-  
ly interesting extension of iiseful manu-  
factures; the combined product of pro-  
fessional occupations, and of household  
indus-ry. Such, indeed, is the expe.  
rience of economy, as well as of policy  
in these substitutes for supplies hereto.  
fore obtained by foreign commerce, that,  
in a National point of view, the change is  
justly regarded as of itself more than a  
recompence for those privations and los-  
ses resulting from foreign injustice,  
which furnished the general impulse re-  
quired for its accomplishment. How far  
it may be expedient to guard the infan-  
cy of this improvement in the distribu-  
tion of labour, by regulations of commer-  
cial tariff, is a subject which cannot fail  
to suggest jtself to your patriotic reflec-  
tions. &gt;  
  
It will rest with the consideration of  
Congress, also, whether a provident, as  
well as fair encouragement, would not be  
given to our navigation, by such regula-  
tions as will place it on a level of com-  
petition with foreign vessels, particular-  
ly in transporting the important and bu)-  
ky productions ofour own soil. ‘The fai-  
lure ef equality and reciprocity in the  
cxisting regulations on this subject op-  
erates,in our ports, as a premium to for-  
eign competitors ; and the inconvenience

| ces, by the more than countervailing en-  
  
couragements now given them, by the  
laws. of their respective countries.  
  
Wailast itis universally admitted, that  
a well instructed people alone can be  
permanentiy a free people ; and whilst it  
is evident that the means of diffusing and  
impro.® : useful knowledge form so  
small.a portion of the expenditures for  
national purposes, I cannot presume it  
to be unseasonable, to invite your atten-  
tion to the advantuges of superadding to  
the means of educzxtion provided by the  
several states, a seminary of learning, in-  
stituted by the national legislature, with- :  
in the limits of their exclusive jur‘sdic-  
tion; the expence of which might be de-  
frayed, or reimbursed, out of the vacant  
grounds which have accrued to the na-  
tion within these limits.  
  
Such an institution, though local in its  
legal character, would be universal in its  
beneficial effects. By enlightening the  
opinions: by expanding the patriotism :  
and by assimilating the principles, the  
sertitnents and the manners of those who  
might resort to this temple of science,  
to be re-disiributed,in due time, through  
every part of the community ; sources of  
jealousy and prejudice would be dimin-  
ished, the features of national character  
would be muitiplied, and greater extent  
given to sociai harmony. But above all,  
a weil constituted seminary, in the cen-  
tre of the pation, is recommended by the  
consideration that the additional instruc-  
tion emanating from it would contribute  
not less to strengthen the foundations,  
than to adorn the structure of our free  
and happy system of government.  
  
Among the commercial abuses still  
cominitted under the American flag, and  
leaving in force my former reference to  
that subject, it appears that American  
citizens are instrumental in carrying on  
a traffic in enslaved Africans, equally in  
violation of the laws of humanity, and in  
defiance of thosé of their own country.  
The same just and benevolent motives  
which produced the interdiction In force  
against this criminal conduct, will doubt-  
less be felt by Congress, ia devising fur-  
ther means of suppressing the evil.  
  
Inthe midst of uncertainties, necessa-  
rity connected with the great interests of  
the United States, prudence requires a  
continuance of our defensive and pecu-  
piary arrangements. The Secretary of )  
War and the Secretary of the Navy wilt  
  
submit the statements an? estimates |  
  
which may aid Congress, in their ensu-  
ing provisions for the land and naval  
force. The statements of the latter will  
inciude a view of the transfer of appre-  
priations in the naval expenditures, and  
the grounds on which they were made.  
  
The fortifications fer the defence of  
our maritime frontier have been prose-  
cuted according to the plan laid down in  
1803. The works, with some excep-  
  
‘tons, are completed, and furnished with  
-erdaaace. Those for the security of the  
  
city of New-York, though far advanced  
  
ion, will require a fur-  
towards completion, will require a

cy which it merits, and is capable of re-  
ebiving, it ts indispensable that they  
should be instructed and practised in the  
fore ay rar be frend  
Q mpitshment-of this  
important work, I recommended for the  
appre” greet  
c Ung a System, which shall,  
in the first Instance, Callinto the fieid, at  
rk tee expence, and for a given tine,  
Portions of the commissioned and  
hon-cominissioued officers. The instruc-  
tion and discipline thus acquired wouid  
gradually diffuse through the entire bo-  
dy of the militia a practical knowledge  
and promptitude foractive service, which  
are the great ends to be pursued.—Ex-  
perience has teft ne doubt, either of the  
hecessity, or the efficacy, of competent  
military skill in these portions of an ar-  
my, in fitting it for the final duties, which  
it may have to perform.  
_ The corps of Engineer&#x27;s, with the Mil-  
itary Academy, are entitled.to the early  
attention of Congress. The Buildings at  
the Seat, fixt by law, for the present A-  
cademy, are s6 far in decay, as not to af-  
ford the necessary acc «.modation. But  
arevision of the law is recommended,  
principally with a view to a more enlarg-  
ed cultivation and diffusion of the advan-  
tages of such institutions, by providing  
professorships for all the necessary bran-  
chesof military instruction, and by the es-  
tablishment of an additional Academy, at  
the Seat of Government or elsewhere.  
The means by which war, as well for de-  
fence, as for offence, are now carried on,  
render these schools of the more scien-  
tific operations an indispensible part of  
every adequate system. _ Even among  
nations whose large standing armies and  
frequent wars afford every other oppor-  
tunity of instruction, these establishments  
are found to be indispensable, for the  
due attainment of the branches of military  
science, whicia require_a regular course  
of study and experiment.—In a govern-  
ment happily without the other opportu-  
nities, Seminaries, where the ciemen-  
tary principles of the art of war cir be  
taught without actual war and without  
the expence of extensive and standing  
armies, have the precious advantage of  
uniting an éssential preparation against  
external danger with 4 scruputous re-  
gard to internal safety. In no other way  
probably can a provision, of equal effica-  
cy for the public defence, be made at so  
little expence, or more consistently with  
the public liberty.  
  
The receipt into the Treasury during  
the year ending on the 30th of Septem-  
ber last (and amounting to more than  
eight millions and-a half of dollars) have  
exceeded the current expences of the  
Government, including the interest on  
the public debt. For the purpose of reim-  
bursing at the end of the year 3,750,000  
dollars of the principal, a loan, as author-  
ised by law had been negociated to that  
amount; but has since been reduced to  
2,750,000 dollars; the reduction being  
permitted by the state of the Treasury ;  
in which there will be a balance, remain-  
ing at the end of the year, estimated at  
2,000,000 dollars. For the probable re-  
ceipts of the next year, and other details,  
I refer to statements which will be trans-  
  
mitted from the Treasury, and which  
  
will enable you-to judge what further  
provisions may be necessary for the en-  
suing years,  
Reserving for future occasions, in the  
course of the Session, whatever other  
communications may claim your atten-  
tion, I close the present, by expressing  
  
‘my reliance, under the blessing of Di-  
  
vine Providence, on_ the judgment and  
patriotism which will guide your meas-  
  
ures, at a period particularly calling for |  
  
united Couicils and inflexible exertions,  
for the welfare of our country, and by as-  
suring you of the fidelity and_alacrity  
with which my cé-operation will be af-  
  
forded.

Fellow Citizens of the Senaiey  
and of the House of Representatives,  
  
THI embarrassments which have prevail  
ed in vur toreign reistions, and so much em­  
ploy«d the deiberations of Congress, mase  
It a primary daty, in pieeung you, 10 cominus  
nicate whatever muy have occurred, in that  
branch of our national uffiirs.  
  
Tae act of the last session of Congress,  
“ concerning the commercial intercourse be­  
tween the United Scates and Great-Briwin  
and France and their depen lencies,” having  
invited, in a new torm, a ter&#x27;minstion of their  
edicty ag..inut our neutral commerce, (&#x27;,npit&#x27;s  
of the acts were immediately forwarded (o  
our Ministers at London and Paris 1 with 4  
view (hat ity object might be within ibe early  
attention of the French and British govern­  
ments.  
  
By the communication received through  
our minister at Paris, it appeared, hat @  
knowledge of the act vy the French govern­  
ment, was followed by o declaration that the  
Berlin and Milan decrees were vevoked, and  
would gcuse (0 have effect ou the st doy ol  
November ensning. ) hese buing the only  
known edicts ol Frunce, within the descrips  
tion of the act und the revocation of them  
being such that they cevsed, on that dae, to  
vioiate our neutral commcerce : the fact, us  
prescribed by faw, was .nnounced by a proc­  
lamation, bearing date the 2d day o 1 Navem­  
ber.  
  
It would have well accorded with the con­  
cilistory views, ind cated by this proceeding  
on the part of Frauce, 10 have exiended then  
to all the grounds of just complaint, which  
now remuin unadjusied witk the United Staes  
It was patticularly snticipated that, as luithe  
evidence of just dispusitions towards thew.  
restoration would have been immediately  
made of the property of our citizens scized  
ander a misapplication of the principie of re­  
privals, combined with a misconstraction of a  
law of the United Swuates. This expectation  
has not been fuifiiled.  
From the British government no commu­  
nicafion on the subject ol the act has been re­  
ceived. To a communication from our min­  
ister at London of the revocation, by the  
French governmment, of its Berlin and Milan  
decrees, it was answered that the Bricsh sys­  
tem would be relinguished as soon as the re­  
peal of the French decrees should have actu­  
ally taken effecty and the commerce of neu­  
tral nations have becn restored to the coudi­  
tion in which it stood, proviousiv to the pro­  
mulgation oi those decrees. This pledyge.als  
though it does not veczssarily import, does  
not exclude the intention ol relinquishing, a­  
long with the orders in councily, the pracuce  
of those novel blockades which have a like  
effect of interrupting our neutral commerce.  
And this fariher justice to the United Stutes  
is the rather to be looked for,inasinuch as the  
blockades in question, bein;; not more contra­  
trary to the estublished law of nationsy than  
inconsistent with the ruies of biockade for­  
merly recognized by G Beiwain herself, celid  
have no altadgod basis ather than the plea ol  
retaliution, aliez2l s the basis of the ovders  
of conuncil Jaler the modification of  
the oviginal orleres of Navemoer 1857, into  
the orders of Aprily 1809, there is indeed  
scarcely a nomiaal distncion betwsen the  
srders an Pblockades. Oue of those illegiti­  
nate blockades, bearing daein Muy 1806,  
naving been espressly avowed to be still va­  
recinded.and 10 be in efect, compreheaded in  
the orders of council, was too distinetly brot’  
vithin the purview of the act of Congress,  
aot to be comprehended in the explunation ot  
the re juisites 1o a complivnce with it The  
Beitish government was accordinyly apprised  
wy o minisier. near ity that such was the  
Hyht in which the subject wus to be regard­  
ed. k &quot;,  
On the other important subjects depend­  
ing between the U. States and twe governs  
ment, no pro(‘r?r has been m.le, from  
Nu.c @ early satislactory result can be  
reiledoa, - - * ‘  
10 wils new porture of our relavions with  
  
those powers, the consideration ef Congress  
wiil be properly turned 1o a removal of doubts  
which may occur in the exposition, and of  
difficuhiies, in the execution of the act sbove  
ched. 7  
  
The commerce of the U. States with  
the North of Burcpe, berctofore much vexed  
by licentious cruizers, particularly under the  
Dunish Bag, has latterly been visited with  
fresh and extensive depredations. The meu­  
sures pursued in behalf of our injured citi­  
zens not having obtained justice for them, a  
further and more formal interposition with  
the Danish government is contemplated. The  
principles which bave been maintained by  
that government in relation to neutral coms  
merce, and the [riendly professions of His  
Dunish Mujesty towards the United States,  
are valugble pledges, i favour of 4 success­  
ful issue.  
  
Among the events growing out of the  
state of the Spanish Monarchy, our atteation  
was impetionsly attracted 1o ‘the change, de­  
veloping itself in that portion of West Flori­  
da ; which, though of right apperiaining o  
the United States, had remasined in the pos­  
session of Spain 3 awaiting the resalt of ne­  
gociations for 1s wctual delivery of them . The  
Spanish authority was subverted § and a si­  
ation produced, exposing the countiy to ui­  
teriour events which essentially affect the  
rigrts and welfare of the Union. In such a  
conjuncture, § did et delay *he interposition  
required for the occupancy of the terruory  
West of the river Perdido ; 1o which the -  
tle of the United States extends, and to which  
the laws, provided tor the gerritory of Or­  
leans, are applicable. With this view, the  
Proclamation, of which a copy is laid before  
you, was confided to the Governoar of that  
Territory, to be carried into effect. The le­  
gality and nccessity of the course pursued,  
assure me of the Luwvourable light in which it  
will present itsell 1o the Legislature ; and of  
the promptitude, in which they will supply  
whutever provisions may be due to the essen­  
tial rioats and equitable interests of the peo­  
le thas bronght into the bosom of the A%  
mevicun family.  
Onr amity with the Powers of Burbary,  
with the exception of 4 recent occurence at  
Tunls, of which an explwution is just re­  
ceived, appears to have been unipterrupted,  
and to have become more firmly established.  
With the Indiwm trioes, also, the peace and  
friendship of the U. States ave found to be  
&lt;0 elizinle, that the general disposition to  
sreserve bath continues o gain strength.  
I feel pardcular satisliction in remarking  
that 4w tnteriour view of our country presents  
0% with weatetul proofs of its substantial and  
incresing prosperity To a thrivig agricul  
tire, and-the improvements related to it is  
added o hivhly intercsiing cxtension of useful  
m.nufwtares 3 the combined product of pro­  
fxssional oceupations, and of heusehotd indus­  
-Iy, Sueh, indeed, is the expecience of econ­  
amy, us well as of policy, in these substitutes  
for supplies heretofore obtained by foreiyn  
commerce, that, 1n a nationl view,the change  
is justly regarded as of itsell’ move than a re­  
compence for those privations and losses re­  
sulting from toreiygn injustice, which furnish.  
ed the gencral impaise required for its ac­  
complisiment. How far it inay be expedien:  
o guard the wfincy of this improverment in  
the distribution of i.bour, by regulations ot  
theccommarcial taviff. 18 a subject which can­  
aot fail o suggest isell 1o your patriotick  
reflections.  
  
It wili rest with the consideiation o Con­  
gress, also, wiether a p ovident, as well as  
fair encouragement, would not be given to  
our navigation, by such regulations as will  
place on a level of competition with foreign  
vessels, particularly in transporting the im­  
portant and buiky prodactions of our own soii  
The failure of ¢ juaity and reciprocity ol the  
existing regulations on this subject operates.  
in our ports, as a premina 1o foreign compe­  
titors ; and the inconvenience must increase,  
as these muy be muitiplied, under wore fi­  
vourible circumstances, by the more than  
couatervatling encouragemenis now given  
them, Ly the laws of their respective coun­  
tries.  
  
Whilst it Is universally admitted that o  
well instracted peopie alone cin be berme­  
nenty o free people ; und whilst it is eviden:  
that the means of diffusing and Tmproving  
auseful knowiedge fori so small a propertion  
of the expenditures tor natignal purposes, |  
cannot presume it to be unsedsonsble, to in­  
vite your attention to the advantages of su­  
peradding, (o the measns of education provi­  
ded by the several Stues, a seminary ol

timey through every part of the community ;  
sounrces ol jealousy and prejudice would be  
diminished, the feutures of pational charucte

constiiuted seminary, in the centre of the ne­

that the additional instruction emanating from  
it would contribute not less to strengthen the

by the establishment of wr additionsl Acudemy at Ihe  
seat of government, or elsewhere. The neins by  
which war, as weil for defince, as for otience, arg  
row carried on, render these schools of the niore scin  
entifick operations an indispensable part of evory ades  
quate system Even among notiors whose large

FtUrut Citizens of the Senate, and  
&quot; the House of Representative,  
The embarrassments which have.pre­  
vailed in our foreign relations, and so  
much employed the deliberations bf  
Congress, make it a primary duty, in  
meeting you, to communicate whatever  
may have occurred, in that branch of  
our national aiTairs.  
The act of the last session of Con­  
gress &quot; concerning the commercial in­  
tercourse between the United States and  
Great Britain and France and their de­  
pendencies&quot; having invited, in a new­  
form, a termination of their edicts a­  
gainst our neutral commerce, copies of  
the act were immediately forwarded to  
our ministers at London and Paris ; with  
a view that its object might be within  
the early attention of the French and  
British governments,.  
By the communication received thro  
our minister at Paris, it appeared, that a  
knowledge of the act by the French go­  
vernment, was followed by a declaration  
that the Berlin and Milan decrees were  
revoked and would cease to have effect,  
on the first day ot November ensuing;  
These beiu the only known edicts of  
France, within the description ofthe act,  
and the revocation of them, being such  
that they ceased, at that date, to violate  
our neutral commerce ; the fact, as pre­  
scribed by, law, was announced by a pro­  
clamation bearing date the second day of  
November.  
It would have well accorded with the  
conciliatory views, indicated by this pro­  
ceeding on the part of France, to have  
extended them to all the grounds of just  
complaint, which now remain unadjust­  
ed with the United States. It was par­  
ticularly anticipated that, as a further e­  
vWence of just dispositions towards them  
restoration would have been immedi­  
ately jnade of the property of our citi­  
zens seized under a misapplication of  
the principle of reprisals, combined with  
a misconstruction of a law ofthe United  
States. This expectation has not been  
fulfilled. . . !  
Frorri the British government no com­  
munication on the subject of the act has  
been received. To a communication  
from our minister at London of the re­  
vocation, by the French government, of  
its Berlin and Milan decrees, it was ans­  
wered that the British system would be  
relinquished as soon as the repeal of the  
Frencii decrees should have .actually ta­  
ken effect, arul the commerce ot neutral  
nations have been restored to the condi­  
tion in which it stood, previously to the  
promulgation of those decrees. This  
pledge, although it does not necessarily  
import, tToes not exclude die inicntio  
of rel&#x27;usquishing, along with the order  
in council, the practice cf those cove  
blockades which tiavc a like effect j i  
hiterrtipiing our neutral commerce.  
4.nd this further justice to the Unite  
State is the rather to be looked tor, in  
i . .1. t At : i . .: ,

retaliation, aueagea as the Basis or JH

tion of the original orders of November  
vl 80?, into the orders ofApril! 809 there  
is indeed scarcely a nominal distinction  
between the orders and the b&#x27;ockades  
One of those illegitimate blockades, bear­  
ing date in May 1806, h&#x27;vihg bee ex­  
press avowed to be still Unresbinded,  
and to be, in effect, comprehended in the  
orders in council, was too distinctly bfot  
within-the purview of the&#x27;act of Con­  
gress, not to be comprehended in the  
explanation of the requisites to a com  
pliance with it. TheBriri.-h gbvernmewtv  
was accortlingiy apprized by ooT minis  
ter near it, that such was the hght in  
which the subject was to be &#x27;regarded.  
.On the other important subjects de  
pending between the United Slates and  
ahst itoveromeiit, no proeress has been  
made, from which an early and satUftc  
tory result can b relied en.  
In this new posture of our relations with  
those sowers, the consideration of Congress  
will be properly turned to a removal of  
doubts Which may occur in the exposition,  
and of difficulties in tho execution, of the act  
above cited. . &quot; &#x27;  
The cornrnerce of the U. States with the  
iCorth of Europe, heretofore much vexd by  
licentious cruisers, particularlt under the Da­  
nish flag, has lately been visited with fresh  
and ex tensive &quot;depreciations. Tlie treasures  
pursued in behalf of our injured citizens, not  
having obtained justice for itherii,&#x27; a further  
land mbre formal interposition with the Da-  
nisu govemmenus contemplate?!, me prin­  
ciples which have been maintained by that  
government in relation to neutral commerce,  
and the friendly professions of his Danish Ma­  
jesty towards the United States, are valuable  
pledges, in favor of a successful issue. ..  
Amor.p the events growing out of the state  
li of the Spanish Monarchy, our attention was  
imperiously attracted to the change develop­  
ing itself in that portion of West-Florida ;  
which, though of right appertaining to the  
United States, hid remained in the possession  
of Spain ; awaiting the result of negociations  
for its actual delivery to them. The Spanish  
authority was subverted : and a situation  
produced, exposing the country to ulterior  
events, which might essentially&#x27; affect the  
rights and welfare .of .die Union., In, such a  
conjuncture, I did not delay the interposition  
required for the occupancy of the territory  
West &quot;of the river Perdido &quot;; to which the ti­  
tle of theXF. States extends, and to which the  
laws,, provided for the territory of Orleans,  
are applicable. With this view, the Procla­  
mation, of which a copy is laid before you,  
was confided to the Governor of that territo­  
ry, to be carried into effect. The legality and  
necessity ofthe course pursued, assure me of  
the favorable ugt t in which it will present it- ,  
sen ,to the Legislature ; and ofthe prompti­  
tude, with which they will supply whatever  
provisions tnay be due to tlie essential rights  
and equitable interests of the people this  
brq&#x27;t into the bosom of the American family.  
Our amity with the powers of Barbary, with  
the exception of a recent occurrence at Tu­  
nis, of which an explanation is just receivejd,  
appears to have beeh jurunterruptedj and to  
have become more firmly established.  
With the Indian tribes, also, the peace and  
friendship ofthe TJ. States are found to be so  
eligible, that the &quot;general disposition to pre­  
serve both continues to gain strength. .  
I feel particular satisfaction in remarking  
that ah interior view of our country presents  
us with grateful proofs of its jubstantial and  
increasing prosperity. To a thriving agri­  
culture, and the improvements related to it,  
is added a highly interesting extension of  
useful manufactures V the combined product  
of professional occupations&#x27;, and ofhousehold  
industry. Such,&quot;indeed, is the experience&#x27; of  
(economy, as well as of policy, in these sub­  
stitutes for .Supplies heretofore obtained by  
foreign commerce,. that, in a national view,  
the, charge is justly regarded as of itself  
more than a recompence for those privations  
and losses resulting from foreign injustice,  
which furnished the general impulse requir­  
ed for its accomplishment. How. far it may  
be expedient to guard the infancy of this im­  
provement in the distribution of labor, by re­  
gulations of the commercial tariff, is a su­  
ect which cannot fail to suggest itself to your  
patriotic reflections  
It will rest with the consideration of Con  
gress&#x27;, also, whether a. provident, as ( well as;  
fur encouragement, would not bejf iven to  
our navigation by such regulations as will  
place it on a levej of competition, with foreign  
vessels, particularly in transporting the im­  
portant and ljulky productions of our own  
soil. The failure of equality and reciprocity  
In the existing regulati6ns on this. subject o  
perates, in our ports, as a premium to foreign  
competitors ; and the inconvenience must in-,  
crease, ,as these may be multiplied, under  
more favorable circumstances, by -the more  
than countervailing encouragements now i­  
ven them, by -the laws of , their respective  
countries.&quot; : &#x27;  
- -Whilst it is universally admitted that awell  
instructed People alone can be permanently  
a free People ;rand whilst it is evident that  
the means of diffusing and improving useful  
knowledge form so small a portion-of the ex-  
penaitures ior national purposes, i cannot  
presume it to be unseasonable to invite your  
attention to the advantages of superadding to  
the means of education provided by the seve­  
ral States, a seminary of learning, instituted  
by&#x27; tbe National Legislature,within the limits  
or their exclusive jurisdiction--the expence  
of whieh might be defrayed or reimbursed  
out of the vacant gToundswhich have accrued  
to the nation within those limits. . &#x27;. ;  
Such an institution, though local in its le&quot;  
gal character, would be universal in its bene­  
ricial effects. By enlightening the opinixms  
by expanding the patriotism and by assimi­  
lating the principles, the sentiment and the  
manners of those who might resort to this  
Temple of Science, to be re-distributed, n  
due time, through every part of the corjamu&#x27; j  
nity, sources ofjealousy and prejudice, would  
be diminished&#x27; the features of national cha-:  
racter would be multiphed, fit greater extent  
given to social harmoiv. But above all, awell  
constituted Seminary, m the centre of the na­  
tion 1 is&#x27; recommended by the consideration,  
that the additional instruction emanatingfrom  
ir would contribute not less to strengthen the  
foundations, than to adorn the structure, of  
.our free and happy system of Government.

da, you say, must we speak of that pet-  
ty affair ? Bo it seems, if wc attend to  
the language of the proceedings of  
  
■  
  
which amuses ititeir in re- j may have oecuri cd, in that brtmcli of  
  
our national affairs.  
  
The act of the last session of Con-  
gress “ concerning the commercial in-  
tercourse between the United States  
and Great Biitain and France and their  
dci&gt;eiKlencics” having invited, in anew  
form, a termination of their edicts a-  
gainst our neutral commerce, copies of  
the act were immediately forwarded to  
our n.&#x27;inisters at London and F„ris ;  
with a view that its object might be  
within the early attention of the French  
and B iiish govenimer.ts.  
  
By the ro&quot;,&gt;niuiiication received  
through our minister at I’uris, it ap-  
peared, that a knowledge of the act by  
the Frencb government, was followed  
bv a declaration Uiat the Beidin and Mi-  
lan decrees were revoked, and would  
cease to have effect oia^he first day of  
N&#x27;ovember ensuing. These being the  
only known edicts of France, within the  
description of the act, and liie revoca-  
tion of them, being such that they ceas-  
ed, at that date, to violate our neutral  
commerce ; the tact, as prescribed by-  
law, was announced by a proclamation  
bearing date the second day of Novem-  
ber.  
  
It would have well accorded with the  
conciliatory views, indicated by this  
proceeding on the part of France, to  
Itave ex. ended them to all the grounds  
of jtist complaint, which, now remain un-  
adjusted with the I nited Slates. It was  
particularly anticipated th • .safurther  
evidence of just dispo .i-,. jus towards  
them, restoration would have been im-  
mediately made of the property of our  
citiz-cns seized under a misapplication  
of the principle of reprisals, combined  
with a misconstruction of a law of the  
United States. This expectation has  
mot been fulfilled.  
  
From the British government no  
ccmniunication on the subject of the  
act liAs been received. To a commu-  
nication from our minister at London  
of the revocation, by the French go-  
verninetit, of its Beilin and Milan de-  
crees, it was answered that the British  
system would be relintjuished as soon  
as the repeal of the French decrees  
should have actually taken effect, and  
the commerce of neutral nations have  
been restored to the condition in which  
it stood previous to the promulgation  
of those decrees. &#x27;I&#x27;hls pledge, al-  
though it docs not necessarily Import,  
does not exclude the intention of relin-  
quishing, along with the orders in  
council, the practice of those novel  
blockades which have a like effect of  
intcru&#x27;.pting our neutral commerce.  
And this further justice to the United  
latcs is the rather to be. looked for.

accomplishment. How far it mav be ex-  
pedient to guard the infancy of this im-  
provement in the distribution of labor, by  
regulations of the commercial tariff, is a  
subject which cann-&#x27;t fail to suggest itself  
to your patriotic rellections.

Congress, als-i, whether a provident, as

with the rules of blockade form.illy re-  
cognised by Great Britain herself,  
could have no alleged basis, other than  
the plea of retaliation, alleged as the  
basis of the orders in council. Under  
the modification of the original orders  
of November 1 807, into the orders of  
April 1809, there is indeed scarcely a  
nominal distinction between the orders  
and the blockades. One of_ those ille-  
gitimate blockades, bearing date in  
May 1806, having been e.xjirebsly a-  
vov. ed to be still unrescinded, and to be,  
in efiVet, comprehended in the orders  
in council, was too distinctly brought  
within the purview of the act of Con-  
gress, not to be comprehended in the  
explanation of the requisites to a com-  
pliance with it. The British govern-  
ment was accordingly apprized by our  
minister near it, that such was the light  
in which the subject was to be re-  
garded.  
  
On the other important subjects dc  
pcndbig between the United Slates and  
that government no pi ogres? has been  
made, from which an early and satis-  
factory result can be relied on.  
  
In this new posture of our relations  
with those powers, the consideration of  
Congress will be properly turned to  
a removal of doubts whtcli may occur  
in the exposition, and of difficulties  
in the execution of the act above cited.  
  
The commerce of the United States,  
with the North of Europe, heretofore  
much vexed by licentious cruisers, par-  
ticularly under the Danish flag, has  
Utterly been visited with fresh and ek-  
tcBsive depredations. The measures  
pursued in behalf of our injured citi-  
zens not having obtained justice for  
them, a further and more formal inter-  
position with the Danish government is  
contemplated. The principles which  
have been maintained by that govern-  
ment in relation to neutral commerce,  
and the friendly professions of his Da-  
nish Majesty towards the United Slates,  
are valuable pledges, in favor &#x27;of a suc-  
cessful issue. f  
  
Among the events growing out of the  
state of the Sp,.tiish Monarchy, our at-  
tention was imperiously attracted to  
the change, developing itself in that  
portion of West Florida ; which, though  
of right appertaining to the United  
States, had remained in the possc.ssion  
of Spain ; awaiting the result of iiego-  
ciations for its actual dcliveiyto them.  
The Spanish authority was subverted :  
and a situation produced, exposing the  
country to ulterior events, which might  
essentially affect the rights and welfare  
of the Union. In such a conjuncture,  
I did not delay the interposition requir-

In the midst of uncertainties, necessa-

the United States, prudence requires a con-

and Secretary of the Navy will submit the

Congres , in their ensuing provisions for  
the land and naval forces. The statements  
ot the latter will include a view of the

were made.  
  
The fortifications for the defence of our

compleated, and furnished with ordinance.

Wednesday, December 5, 1810.  
y Citizens of ‘he Senate, and  
: the douse of Representatives,  
  
THE embarrassments which have prevailed  
in our foreign relations, and so much employed  
the deliberations of Congress, make it a primary  
duty, in meeting you, to communicate whatever  
may have occurred, in that branch of our nation-  
al affairs.  
  
The act of the last session of Congress  
cerning the commercial intercourse between the  
United States and Great Britain and France and  
  
their dependencies” having invited, in a new  
  
ITED STATES,  
  
Deli  
  
vered,  
  
« con-  
  
tor  
  
neutral nerce, copies of the act were imme-  
diately forwarded to our ministers at Londonand  
Paris; with 3 a view that its object might be with-  
the early attention of the French and British  
go yvernments.  
  
By the communication received through  
minister at Paris, it &lt; ippeared, that a k: owledge  
of the act by the French government was foilow-  
ed by a declaration that Berlin Milan  
decrees were revoked, and would cease to have  
eficct on the first day of November ensuing.—  
These being the only ki own edicts of sons  
description of the act, and the reve  
such that they  
  
con  
  
our  
  
the andl  
  
within the  
  
tion of them being y ceased, at that  
cate. to violate our neutral commerce: the fact  
  
prescribed by law, was announced by a pro  
elamation bearing date the sccond day of No-  
  
ber.  
It would have well accorded with the concili-  
atory views, indicated by this proceeding on the  
part of F rance, to have extended them to all the  
«rounds of just complaint, which now remain un-  
xdjusted with the United States. It was part  
éularly anticipated tl at, as a further evidence of  
just dispositions towards them, restoration woul:  
have been immediately made of the pro pert y  
eur citizens seized under a misapplic

1 of the  
  
nor  
  
prince iple of reprisals, combine ‘dow ay a misec  
struction of a law of the United St:  
pectation has not been fulfilled.  
  
From the British government no communica-  
tion on the subject of the act has been receive d.  
Toa communication from our n at Le fix.  
don of the revocation, by the French government,  
  
This ex-  
  
iinister  
  
of its Berlin and Miian d decrees, it was answered  
that the Dritish @ystem would be reinea: ished as  
soon asthe repeal of the French decrees should  
  
have actually taken effect, and the commerce ot  
neutral nations have been restored to the condi-  
tion in whieh it stood, previously to the promul-  
  
“ ° ° . ° i: ‘ |  
form, a, termination of their edicts against our  
  
  
  
ie  
  
  
  
gation of those decrees. This j ce, although  
it does not necessart&#x27;y ° f, does not exclucie  
the intention of re! ishing, along with the or-  
ders in counclhi. thé pri ctice of those neve! block- |  
  
ades, which have a ike viiectol interrupung ou  
  
|  
i  
‘  
  
|} neutral commerce.  
  
  
  
2 ee  
  
  
  
  
  
And this further justice to  
the United States is the, rather to be looked for,  
inasmuch as the blockades in question, being not  
more contrary to the established law of nations,  
than inconsistent with the rules of blockade for-  
mally recognised by Great Britain herself, could  
have no aliedged basis, other than the plea of re-  
taliation, alledged as the basis of the orders in  
council. Under the modification of the original  
orders of November, 1807, into the orders of A-  
pril, 1809, there is indeed scarcely a nominal  
distinction between the orders and the block-  
ades. One of those illegitimate blockades, bear-  
ing date in May, 1806, having been expressly a-  
vowed to be still unrescinded, and to be, in ef-  
fect, comprehended in the orders in council, was  
too distinctly brought within the purview of the  
act of Congress, not to be comprehended the  
explanation of the requisites to a compliance  
withit. The British government was according-  
ly apprized by our minister near it, that such  
was the light in which the subject was to be re-  
garded,  
  
On the other important subjects depending  
between the United States and that government,  
no progress has been made, from which an early  
and satisfacte’y result can be relied on.  
  
In this new posture of our relations with those  
powers, the consideration of Congress will be  
properly turned to a removal of doubts which  
may occurin the exposition, ane of difficulties  
in the execution, of the act above recited.  
  
The commerce of the United States, with the  
  
North of Europe, Reretofore much vexed by li-  
centious cruisers, particularly under the Danish  
  
flag, has latterly been visited with fresh and ex-  
tensive depredations. The measures purstied in  
behaif of our injured citizens not having obtain-  
ed justice for them, a further and more formal  
interposition with the Danish government is con-  
templated. ~The principles which have been  
matiitained by that government In  
  
reutral commerce, and the friendly professions  
of his Danish Majesty towards the U. States,  
valuable pledges, in favour of a successful issue.  
  
Among the events growing out of the state  
the Spanish Monarchy, our attention was in  
riously attracted to the change, de relopthg  
  
self in that portion of West Florida, which,  
sales of right appertaining to the United Stans Sy  
had remained in the possession of Spain ; await-  
ing the result of negociations for  
livery tothem. ‘The Spanish authority was sub-  
verted: and a situation produced, exposing th  
country to ulterior eventssWhich might essen-  
tially affect the rights and welfare of the Union  
[n such a conjuncture, I did not delay the inter-  
position required for the occupancy of the terri-  
ery West of the river Perdido ; to which the ti-  
  
tle ofthe United States extends, and to which  
the laws, provided for the territory of Orleans,  
are applicable. With this view, the proclama-  
tion, of which a copy is laid before you, was con-  
aided to the governor of that territory, to be cur-  
ried into effect. The legality and necessity of  
the course pursued assure me of the favourable  
licht in which it will present itself to the Legis-  
iature ; end of the promptitude, with which they  
  
wil} ‘suppl y whatever provisions may be due to  
the essential rights and equitable interests of the  
xeople thus brought into the bosom of the Ame-  
ican family.  
  
Our amity with the Powers of Barbary, with  
the exception of a récent eccurrence at Tunis.  
of which an explanation Is just received, appears  
ro | been uuinterruptes 1, and to have become  
more fin abiished.

I feel particular satisfaction in remarking that  
an interior view of our country presents us with  
grateful proofs of its substantiahand increasing,  
prosperity. To a thriving agriculture, and the  
improvements related to it, is added a highly in-  
teresting extension of useful manufactures ; ; the  
combined product of professional occupations,  
and of household industry. Such, indeed, is the  
experience of economy, as well as of policy, in  
these substitutes for supplies heretofore obtain-  
ed by foreign commerce, that, in a national view,  
the change is justly regarded as of itself more  
than a recompe for those privations and los-  
ses resulting from foreign injustice, which fur-  
nished the general impulse required for its ac-  
complishment. How dip it may be expedient to  
guard the infancy of mprovement in the dis-  
tribution of labor, by regulations of the commer-  
cial tariff, is a subject which cannot fail to sug-  
west itselfto your patriotic reflections.  
  
It will rest with the consideration of Congress, _  
also, whether a provident, as wellas fait encdtir-  
agement, would not be given to our navigatien,  
by sueh regulations as will place it on a level of  
competition “_ foreign vessels, particularly in  
transporting impertant and biky preduc~  
tions of our own soil. The failure of equ  
and reciprocity in the ¢€ revulations Oi

Whiist itis univeérss iy admitted

means of diffusing and improving useful knoe  
lecive form so smaii a portion of th®&quot;expendi-  
tures for national purposes, I cannot presume it  
to be unseasonabic, tggin ite your attention to  
the advantages of 2 dls , to the means of  
edu atio n provided by the se vere slates, a semi-  
nary eflearning, instituted by thig national leg is-  
lutume, within the limits of their exclusive juris  
dicti®n ; the expence of which might be j  
or reimbursed, cutyof the vacant gPour  
have accrded to the nation within those Mimits.  
Such an institution, though local in i eal.  
character, would be universal in its bentficial  
jeifects. By enlightening the opinie by*ex+  
panding the patriotism 3 and by assit ing the -  
principles, the sentimentsand the manners of thos€  
who might resort to this Temple of Science, to be  
re -distributed, in due time, throm every partof

would be diminished, the fegpmpes of national ch ave

under the American flag, and leaving | in force my

ing eatension of nseful manufactures; the combined product  
of professional occupations and of household industry, Such  
indeed is tlie experience of economy, as well as of policy, in  
these substitutes for supplies heretofore oblained by foreign  
commefee, that, ina national view, the change is jusily re-  
garded as of ilself more than a recompence for those priva-

How fae ii may be expedient to guard the infancy of this tm-

bevel of competition with fureign vessels, particularly in tran-  
eporting the important and bulky productions of our own soil,  
The failare of equality and reciprocity in the existing regulations  
on this oubject Operates, ip our ports, as &amp; premiam to foreign  
Gompetitors; and the inconvenience must increase, as these  
may be maliiplied, under more favourable circumstances, by  
the more than countervailing eucouragements now given them  
by the laws of their respective countries,  
  
Whiist it is universally admitted that a well instructed peo-  
ple alone can be permanently a free people, and whilst it is  
evident that the means of diffusing and improving useful know.

The embarrassments which have pre-  
vailed in our foreign relations, so much  
employed the deliberations of Congress,  
make it a primary duty, in meeting you,  
to communicate whatever may have oc-  
curred, in that branch of our national  
affairs—The Act of the last Session of  
Congress “ concerning the Commercial  
Intercourse between the United States and  
Great Britain and France and their depen-  
dencies,” having invited in a new form a  
termination of their Edicts against our  
neutral commerce, copies of the Acts  
were immediately forwarded to our mi-  
nisters at London and Paris, with a view  
that its object might be within the early  
attention of the French and British go-  
vernments.—By the communication re-  
ceived through our Minister at Paris, it  
appeared that a knowledge of the act by  
the French Government was followed by  
a declaration that the Berlin and Milan  
decrees were revoked, and would cease to

ye effect on the’ first;day of November  
ining. These being the only known  
ts of France, within the description of  
Pact, and the revocation of them being  
  
5 Bh that they ceased, at that date, to  
  
blate our neutral commerce; the fact, as  
 Sprescrived by law, was announced by .a  
Mroclamation bearing date the 2d day of  
November.—It would have well accorded  
ith the conciliatory views, indicated by  
} proceeding on the part of France, to  
  
of lave extended them to all the grounds of  
  
Ly ae  
  
Ost complaint, which now remain unad-  
mied with the United States. It was  
Hicularly anticipated that, as a further  
idence of just dispositions towards them,  
festoration would have been immediately  
ide of the property of our citizens  
under a misapplication of the prin-  
  
e of reprisals, combined with a mis-  
istruction of a law of the United States.  
his expectation has not been fu&#x27;filled.—  
yom the British Government no commu-  
ication on the subject of the act has been  
ieeived. To a communication from our  
  
mister at London of the revocation, by  
‘French Government, of its Berlin and  
lan Decrees, it was answered that the  
fish system would be relinquished as  
mas the repeal of the French Decrees  
6 actually taken effect, and the com-  
  
ice of neutral nations have been re-  
_ Bored to the condition in which it stood  
“Previovsly to the promulgation of those  
Detrees—This pledge, although it does  
Hot Necessarily import, does not exclude  
fintention of relinquishing, along with  
  
6 Orders in Council, the practice of  
Bse novel blockades which have a like  
Bct of interrupting our neutral com-  
e. And this further justice to the  
hited States is the rather to be looked  
t, inasmuch as the blockades in question  
ing not more contrary to the established  
w of nations, than incunsistent with the  
iles of blockade formerly recognised by  
at Britain herself, could have no al-  
ged basis other than the plea of re-  
ation alledged as the basis of the Or-  
  
rs ini Council. Under the modification  
Of the original Orders in Nov. 1807 into  
e Orders of April 1809, there is indeed  
ely a nominal distinction between  
Orders and the blockades. One of  
hese illegitimate blockades, bearing date  
Mey. 1806, having been expressly  
owed to be still unrescinded, and to be  
effect comprehended in the Orders in  
buncil, was too distinct! brought within  
purview of the act of Congress, not to  
  
[50  
  
he comprehended in the explanation of  
the requisites to be a compliance with it.  
The British Government was accordingly  
apprised by our Minister near it, that  
such was the light in which the subject  
was to be regarded.—In this new a  
of our relations with these powers, the con-  
sideration of Congress will be properly  
turned to a removal of doubts which may  
occur in the exposition, and difficulties  
in the execution of the act above cited,  
The commerce of the United States, with  
the north of Europe, heretofore much  
vexed by licentious cruisers, particularly  
under the Danish flag, has latterly been  
visited with fresh and extensive depreda-  
tions. The measures pursued in behalf of  
our injured citizens, not having obtained  
justice for them, a further and more formal  
interposition with the Danish Government  
is contemplated. The principles which  
have been maintained by that Government  
in relation to neutral commerce, and the  
friendly professions of bis Danish Majesty  
towards the United States, are valuable  
pledges in favour of a successful issue.  
Among the events growing out of the  
state of the Spanish Monarchy, our atten-  
tion was imperiously attracted to the  
change, developing itself in that portion  
of West Florida, which though of right  
appertaining to the United States, had re-  
mained in the possession of Spain, await-  
ing the result of negociation for its actual  
delivery tothem. The Spanish authority  
was subyerted: and a situation prodaced,  
exposing the country to ulterior events,  
which might essentially affect the rights  
}and welfare of the union. In such a con-  
juncture, I did not delay the interposition  
required for the occupancy of the territory  
west of the river Perdido, to which the  
title of the United States extends, atid to  
which the laws provided for the territor  
  
of Orleans, are applicable. With this  
view the proclamation, of which a copy  
is laid before you, was confided to the  
governor of that territory, to be carried  
into effect. The legality and necessity  
of the course pursued, assure me of the  
favourable jight in which it will present  
itself to the legislature ; and of the promp-  
titude with which they will supply what-  
ever provisions may be due to the essen-  
tial rights and equitable interests of the  
people thus brought in&#x27;o the bosom of the  
American family.—Our amity with the  
powers of Barbary, with the exception of  
a recent occdrrence. at Tunis, of which  
  
  
  
an explanation is just received, appears to

have been uninterrupted, and to have be-  
come more firmly established.— With the  
Indian tribes, also, the peace and friend-  
ship of the United States are found to be so  
eligible, that the disposition to preserve  
both continues to gaia strength.—I feel  
particular satisfaction in remarking that  
an interior view of our country presents  
us with grateful proofs of its substantial  
and increasing prosperity. To a thriv-  
ing agriculture, and the improve-  
ments relating to it, is added a highly in-  
teresting extension of usefal manufactures,  
the combined product of. professional oc-  
cnupations, and of househeld industry.  
Such, indeed, is the experience of econo-  
my, as well as of policy, in these sub-  
stitutes for supplies heretofore obtained by  
foreign commerce, that, in a national  
view, the change is justly regarded as. of  
itself more than a recompence for those  
privations and losses resulting from fo-  
reign injustice, which furnished the  
general impulse required for its accom-  
plishment. How far it may be expe-  
dient to guard the infancy of this im-  
rovement in the distribution of la-  
our, by regulations of the commercial  
tariff, is a subject which cannot fail to sug-  
gest itself to your patriotic reflections.—  
It will rest with the consideration of Con-  
gress also, whether a provident, as well as  
fair encouragement, would uot be given to  
our navigation, by such regulations as will  
place it on a level of competition with fo-  
reign vessels, particularly in transporting  
the important and bulky prodactions of eur  
own soil. The failure of equality and re-  
ciprocity in the existing regulations on this  
subject, operates, in our ports, as a pre-  
miuin to foreign competition ; and the in-  
convenience must increase as these may  
be multiplied under more favourable cir-  
cumstances, by the more than countervail-  
img) encouragements now. given them by  
the laws of their respective countries.—  
Whilst it is universally admitted that a  
well-imstructed people alone can be per-  
mgnently a free people ; and whilst it is  
evident that the means of diffusing and im-  
proving useful knowledge form so small a  
proportion of the expenditures for national  
purposes, | cannot presame it to be un-  
seasonable to invite your attention to the  
advaniages of superadding, te the means of  
education provided by the several States,

advantage of uniting an essential prepara-

at so little expence, or more consistently  
with public liberty.—The receipts into the  
Treasury during the year ending on the  
30th of September last (and amounting to  
more than eight millions and a half of dol-  
lars), have exceéded the current expenses  
of the Government, including the interest  
of the public debt.—-For the purpose of re-  
imbursing at the end of the year 3,759,000  
dollars, of the principal, a loan, as autho-  
rised by law, had been negociated to that  
amount, but has since been reduced to  
2,750,000, dollars; the reduction being  
permitted by the state of the Treasury, in  
which there will be a balance remaining  
atthe end of the year, estimated at 2,000,000  
dollars. For the probable receipts the  
next year, and other details, I refer to state-  
ments which will be transmitted from the  
Treasury, and which will enable you to  
judge what further proceedings may be  
necessary for the ensuing.—Reserving to  
future occasions, in the course of the Ses-  
sion, whatever other communications may  
claim your attention, I close the present,  
by expressing my reliance, under the bless-  
ing of Divine Providence, on the judgment  
and patriotism which will guide your  
measures, at a period particularly calling  
for united ‘councils, and inflexible exer-

by assuring you of the fidelity and alacri-

is the rather to be looked for, inasmuch  
as the blockades in questidn,* being not  
more contrary to the established law of  
nations, than inconsistent with the rvles of  
blockade formerly recognized by Great  
Britain herself; could have no alleged basis  
other than the plea of retaliation alleged as  
the basis of the Orders in Council. Under  
the modification of the original Orders of  
Nov. 1807 into the Orders of April 1809,  
there is indeed scarcely a nominal distinc-  
tion between the Orders and the blockades.  
One of those illegitimate blockades, bear-  
ing date in May, 1806, having been ex-  
pressly avowed to be still unrescinded, and  
to be in effect, comprehended in the Orders  
in Council, was too distinctly brought with-  
in the purview of the Act of Congress, not  
be comprehended in the explanation of the  
requisites to a compliance with it. ‘The  
British Government was accordingly ap-  
prized by our Minister near it, that such  
was the light in which the subject was to be  
regarded.  
  
“‘ In this new posture our relations with  
these Powers, the consideration of Con-  
gress will be properly turned to a removal  
of doubts which may occur in the exposi-  
tionjtand difficulties in the execution, of  
the Act above cited.  
  
“ The commerce of the United States,  
with the North of Europe, heretofore  
much vexed by licentious cruizers, parti-  
cularly under the Danish flag, has latterly  
been visited with fresh and extensive de-  
predations The measures pursued in be-  
half of our injured citizens, not having  
obtained justice for them, a further and  
more formal interposition with the Danish  
government is contemplated. ‘Ihe prin-  
ciples which have been maintained by that  
government in relation to neutral com-  
merce, and the friendly professions of his  
Danish majesty towards the United States  
are valuable pledges in favour of a suc-  
cessful issue.  
  
“ Among the events growing out of the  
state of the Spanish monarchy, our attcn-  
tion was imperiously attracted to the change  
developing itself in that portion of West  
Florida ; which, though of right appertain-  
ing to the United States, had remained in  
the possession of Spain; awaiting the re-  
sult of negociation for its actual delivery  
to them, The Spanish authority was sub-  
verted—and a situation produced, exposing  
the country toulterior events, which mi

ing that an interior view of our country  
presents us with greatfulproofs-of its sub-  
stantial and encreasing prosperity. ‘lo  
thriving agriculture, and the improvements  
related to it, is added a highly interesting  
extention of useful manufactures ; :thecom-  
bined-product of professional occupations,  
and of household industry. Such, indeed,  
is the experience of economy, as well as  
of poliey, in these substitutes:for supplies  
heretofore obtained by foreign commerce,  
that, in a national-view, the change is just-  
ly regarded as of itself more than a ,re-  
compence for those privations aad losses  
resulting from foreign injustice, which fur-  
nished the general impulse required for its  
accomplishment. How far it be ax-

attention of Congress. The buildings at  
the seat, fixt by law, for the present a-  
cademy, are not so far in decay, as not  
to afford the necessary accommodation.  
But a revision of the law is recommend-  
ed, principally with a view to a more en-  
larged cultivation and diffusion of the ad-  
vantages of such institutions, by providing  
professorships for all the necessary branch-  
es of military instruction, and by the es-  
tablishment of an additional academy, at  
the seat of government, or elsewhere. The  
theans By which war as well for defence,  
as for offence, are now carried en, ren-  
der these schools of the most scientific 0-  
perations an indispensible part of every  
adequate system, Even among nations  
whese large standing armies and frequent  
wars afford every other opportunity of in-  
struction, these establishments are found to  
be indispensible, for the due attainment of  
the branches of rnilitary science, which re-  
quire a regular course of study and experi-  
ment. In a government, happily without  
the other opportunities, seminaries whore  
the elementary principles of war can be  
taught without actual war, and without  
the expense of extensive and standing ar-  
mies, have the precious advantage of uni-  
ting an essential preparation against exter-  
nal danger, with a scrupulous regard to  
internal safety. In no other way, prob-  
ably, can a provision of equal efhcacy for  
the public defence, be made at so little

Fellow Citizens of the Senate,  
and of the House of Representatives,  
  
THE embarrassments which have prevailed in our foreign rela-  
tions, and so much employed the deliberations of Congress, make  
it a primary duty, in meeting you, to communicate whatever may  
have occurred, in that branch of our national affairs. «”  
  
The act of the last session of Congress, “ concerning the com-  
mercial intercourse between the United States and Great Britain  
and France and their dependencies,” having invited, in a new form,  
a termination of their edicts against our neutral commerce, copies of  
the act were immediately forwarded to our ministers at London and  
  
Paris, with a view that its object might be within the,early attention  
  
ef the French and British governments.  
  
By the communication received through our minister at Paris, it  
appeared that a knowledge of the act by the French government, was  
followed by a declaration that the Berlin and Milan decrees were  
revoked, and would cease to have effect on the first day of November  
ensuing. These being the only known edicts of France, within the  
description of the act, and the revocation of them, being such that  
they ceased at that date, to violate our neutral commerce, the fact;  
as prescribed by law, was announced by a proclamation, bearing  
date the second day of November.  
  
It would have well accorded with the conciliatory views, indicated  
by this proceeding on the part of France, to have extended them to  
all the grounds of just complaint, which now remain unadjusted  
with the United States. It was particularly anticipated that, as a  
further evidence of just dispositions towards them, restoration would  
have been immediately made of the property of our citizens, seized  
under a misapplication of the princifile of reprisals, combined with  
@ misconstruction of a law of the United States. This expfrectation  
has not been fulfilled..  
  
From the British government no communication on the subject  
of the act bas been received. ‘&#x27;o a communication from our minister  
at London, of the revocation, by the French government, of its  
Berlin and Milan decrees, it was answered, that the British system

would be relinquished as soon as the repeal of the French decrees  
should have actually taken effect, and the commerce of neutral na-  
tions have been restored to the condition in which it stood, previously  
to the promulgation of those decrees. This pledge, although it does  
not necessarily import, does net exclude, the intention of relinquish-  
ing, along with the orders in council, the practice of those novel  
blockades which have a like effect of interrupting our neutral com-  
merce. And this further justice to the United States, is rather to be  
Jooked for, inasmuch as the blockades in question, being not more  
contrary to the established law of nations, than inconsistent with the  
rules of blockade formally recognised by Great Britain herself, could  
have no alleged basis, other than. the plea of retaliation, alleged as  
the basis of the orders in council. Under the modification of the  
original orders of November, 1807, into the orders of April, 1809,  
there is indeed scarcely a nominal distinction between the orders  
and the blockades. One of thuse illegitimate blockades, bearing date  
in May, 1806, having been expressly avowed to be still unrescinded,  
and to be, in effect, comprehended in the orders in council, was too  
distinctly brought within the purview of the act of Congress, not to  
be comprehended in the explanation of the requisites to a compli-  
ance with it. The British government was accordingly apprised by  
our minister near it, that such was the light in which the subject was  
to be regarded.  
  
On the other important subjects depending between the United  
States and that government, no progress has been made, from which  
an early and_satisfactory result can be relied on.  
  
In this new posture of our relations with those powers, the con-  
sideration of Congress will be properly turned to a removal of doubts  
which may occur in the exposition, and of difficulties in the execu-  
tion, of the act above cited.  
  
The commerce of the United States, with the north of Europe,  
heretofore much vexed by licentious cruisers, particularly under the  
Danish flag, has latterly been visited with fresh and extensive dep-  
redations. The measures pursued in behalf of our injured citizens,  
not having obtained justice for them, a further and more formal  
interposition with the Danish government is contemplated. The  
principles which have been maintained by that government in rela-  
tion to neutral commerce, and the friendly professions of his Danish  
majesty towards the United States, are valuable pledges, in favour  
of a successful issue.  
  
Among the’events growing out of the state of the Spanish mon-  
archy, our attention was imperiously attracted to the change, de-  
veloping itself in that portion of West Florida, which, though of  
right appertaining to the United States, had remained in the pos-  
session of Spain; awaiting the result of negotiations for its actual  
delivery to them. The Spanish authority was subverted and a situ-  
ation produced, exposing the country to ulterior events, which might  
essentially affect the rights and welfare of the Union. In sucha  
conjuncture, I did not delay the interposition required for the oc-  
cupancy of the territory west of the river Perdido; to which the

proclamation, of which a copy is laid before you, was confided to

tion to preserve beth, continues to gain strength.  
  
I feel particular satisfaction in remarking that an interior view  
of our country, presents us with grateful proofs of its substantial  
and increasing prosperity. Toa thriving agriculture, and the im-  
provements related to it, is added a highly interesting extension of  
useful manufactures; the combined product of professional occupa-  
tions, and of household industry. Such, indeed, is the experience  
of economy, as well as of policy, in these substitutes for supplies  
heretofore obtained by foreign commerce, that, in a national view,  
the change is justly regarded, as of itself more than a recompense  
for those privations and losses resulting from foreign injustice,  
which furnished the general impulse required for its accomplish-  
ment. How far it may be expedient to guard the infancy of this  
improvement, in the distribution of labour, by regulations of the  
commercial tariff, is a subject which cannot fail to suggest itself to  
your patriotic reflections.  
  
It will rest with the consideration of congress, also, whether a  
provident as well as fair encouragement, would not be given to our  
navigation, by such regulations as will place it on a level of com-  
petition with foreign vessels, particularly in transporting the im-  
  
portant and bulky productions of our own soil. The failure of equal-&quot;  
  
ity and reciprocity, in the existing regulations on this subject, ope-  
rates, in our ports, as a premium to foreign competitors; and the  
inconvenience must increase, as these may be multiplied, under  
more favourable circumstances, by the more than countervailing  
encouragements, now given them, by the laws of their respective  
countries.  
  
Whilst it is universally admitted, that a well instructed people  
alone can be permanently a free people; and whilst it is evident,  
that the means of diffusing and improving useful knowledge, form  
so small a proportion of the expenditures for national purposes, |  
cannot presume it to be unseasonable, to invite your attention to  
the advantages of superadding, to the means of education, provided  
by the several states, a seminary of learning, instituted by the na-  
tional legislature, within the limits of their exclusive jurisdiction;

the expense of which might be defrayed, or reimbursed, out of  
the vacant grounds which have accrued to the nation within those  
limits.  
  
Such an institution, though local in its legal character, would be  
universal in its beneficial effects. By enlightening the opinions; by  
expandingthe patriotism; and by assimilating the principles, the sen-  
timents and the manners of those who might resort to this temple  
of Science, to be re-distributed, in due time, through every part of  
the community; sources of jealousy and prejudice would be dimi-  
nished, the features of national character would be multiplied, and  
greater extent given to social harmony. But, above all, a well con-  
stituted seminary, in the centre of the nation, is recommended, by  
the consideration, that the additional instruction, emanating from  
it, would contribute not less to strengthen the foundations, than te  
adorn the structure, of our free and happy system of government.  
  
Among the commercial abuses, still committed under the Ame-  
rican flag, and leaving in force my former reference to that sub-  
ject, it appears, that American citizens are instrumental in carry-  
ing on a traffic in enslaved Africans, equally in violation of the  
laws of humanity, and in defiance of those of their own country.  
The same just and benevolent motives, which produced the inter-  
diction in force against this criminal conduct, will, doubtless, be  
felt by Congress, in devising further means of suppressing the  
evil.  
  
In the midst of uncertainties, necessarily connected with the  
great interests of the United States, prudence requires a continu-  
ance of our defensive and precautionary arrangement. The secre-  
tary of war, and secretary of the navy, will submit the statements  
and estimates, which may aid Congress, in their ensuing provisions  
for the land and naval forces. The statements of the latter, will in-  
clude a view of the transfers of appropriations in the naval ex-  
penditures, and the grounds on which they were made.  
  
The fortifications for the defence of our maritime frontier, have  
been prosecuted according tothe plan laid down in 1808. The works,  
with some exceptions, are completed and furnished with ordnance.  
Those for the security of the city of New York, though far advanced  
towards completion, will require a further time and appropriation.  
This is the case with a few others, either not completed, or in need  
of repairs.  
  
The improvements, in quality and quantity, made in the manu-  
factory of cannon and of small arms, both at the public armories and  
private factories, warrant additional confidence in the competency  
of these resources, for supplying the public exigencies.  
  
These preparations for arming the militia, having thus far pro-  
vided for one of the objects contemplated by the power vested in  
Congress, with respect to that great bulwark of the public safety; it  
is for their consideration, whether further provisions are not requi-  
site, for the other contemplated objects of organization and disci-  
pline. To give to this great mass of physical and moral force, the effi-  
ciency which it merits, and is capable of receiving, it is indispensable

that they should be instructed and practised in the rules by which  
they are to be governed. Towards an accomplishment of this im-  
portant work, 1 recommend, for the consideration of Congress, the  
expediency of instituting a system, which shall, in the first instance,  
call into the field, at the public expense, and for a given time, cer-  
tain portions of the commissioned and non-commissioned officers.  
The instruction and discipline thus acquired, would gradually dif-  
  
fuse through the entire body of the militia, that practical knowledge  
  
and promptitude for active service, which are the great ends to be  
pursued. Experience has left no doubt either of the necessity, or of  
the efficacy of competent military skill, in those portions of an ar-  
my, in fitting it for the final duties which it may have to perform.  
  
The corps of engineers, with the military academy, are entitled  
to the early attention of Congress. The buildings at the seat, fixt  
by law, for the present academy, are so far in decay, as not to afford  
the necessary accommodation. But a revision of the law is recom-  
mended, principally with a view to a more enlarged cultivation and  
diffusion of the advantages of such institutions, by providing  
professorships for all the necessary branches of military in-  
struction, and by the establishment of an additional academy at the  
seat of government, or elsewhere. ‘The means by which war, as  
well for defence, as for offence, are now carried on, render these  
schools of the more scientific operations an indispensable part of  
every adequate system. Even among nations whose large standing  
armies and frequent wars afford every other opportunity of instruc-  
tion, these establishments are found to be indispensable, for the due  
attainment of the branches of military science, which require a re-  
gular course of study and experiment. In a government, happily  
without the other opportunities, seminaries, where the elementary  
principles of the art of war can be taught without actual war, and  
without the expense of extensive and standing armies, have the  
precious advantage of uniting an essential preparation against ex-  
ternal danger, with a scrupulous regard to internal safety. Inno  
other way probably, can a provision, of equal efficacy for the public  
defence, be made at so little expense, or more consistently with the  
public liberty.  
  
The receipts into the treasury during the year ending on the thir-  
tieth of September last, (and amounting to more than eight mil-  
lions and a half of dollars,) have exceeded the current expenses of  
the government, including the interest on the public debt. For the  
purpose of reimbursing at the end of the year, three millions, seven  
hundred and fifty thousand dollars of the principal, a loan, as au-  
thorized by law had been negotiated to that amount; but has since  
been reduced to two milions, seven hundred and fifty thousand dol-  
lars; the reduction being permitted by the state of the treasury, in  
which there will be a balance remaining at the end of the year, es-  
timated at two millions of dollars, lor the probable receipts of the  
next year, and other details, I refer to statments which will be trans-  
mitted from the treasury, and which will énable you to judge what  
further provisions may be necessary for the ensuing years.

officers of the counties to which arms had been  
distributed by the act of 1812, relative to the si-  
tuation of the arms. The result of that inquiry  
may be seen upon an examination of the pack-  
et ‘marked (A.) containing the reports of the  
officers. The act of 1812 makes it the duty of  
the governor to distribute the arms which may  
thereafter be received from the general govern-

mber, 1810, on this subject, uses the fol-  
ing language: “ Whilst it is universally  
mitted that a well instructed people alone  
be a permanently free people; and  
iIst it is evident that the means of diffusing  
dd improving useful knowledge, form so  
alla portion of the expenditures for na-

reasonable to invite your attention to the  
vantages of superadding tothe means of

inary of learning, instituted by the na-  
nal legislature, within the limits of their  
clusive jurisdiction, the expense of which  
ght be defrayed, or re-imbursed out of  
» vacant grounds which have accrued to  
nation within those limits.” ‘ Such an  
stitution, though local in its legal charac-  
, would be universal in its beneficial ef-  
ts. By enlightening the opinions ; by ex-  
nding the patriotism ; and by assimilating  
principles, the sentiments, and the man-  
rs of those who might resort to this tem-  
of science, to be re-distributed, in due  
e, through every part of the community ;  
rces of jealousy and prejudice would be  
inished ; the features of national cha-  
ter would be multiplied, and greater  
ent given to social harmony. But, above  
a well constituted seminary, in the  
tre of the nation, is recommended by  
P consideration, that the additional in-  
ction emanating from it would con-  
ute not less to strengthen the foun-  
ions, than to adorn the structure of  
free and happy system of government.”

ness, the welfare of the Military Academy. In his  
annual message in 1810, he states, “The corps of en.  
gineers, with the Military Academy, are entitled to  
the early attention of Congress.” ‘ But a revision  
of the law is recommended, principally with a view  
toa more enlarged cultivation and diffusion of the

The means by which wars, as well for defence as of-

large standing armies and frequent wars afford eve  
other opportunity of instruction, these establish.

require a regular course of study and experiment. In  
a country, happily without the other opportunities,  
seminaries where the elementary principles of the,  
art of war can be taught. without actual war, and  
without the expense of extensive and standing ar

&quot;I feel particular satisfaction in remarking that an in­  
terior view of our country presents us with grateful  
proots of its substantial and increasing prosperity. Tos  
thriving agriculture, and the improvements relating to it­  
is added a highly interesting extension of useful manud  
factures, the combined products of professional oceupa  
tions and of houschold industry. Such, indeed, is the ex  
perience of economy, as well as of policy, in these sub  
stitutes for supplies heretofore obtained by foreign com  
merce, that, in a national view, the change is justly re  
garded as, of itself, more than a recompense for those  
privations and losses, resulting from foreign injustice  
which furnished the general impulse required for its ac  
complishment. How far it may be expedient to guard

1810: &quot;These preparations for arming tile  
militia having thus far provided for one of the !  
objects contemplated by the power vested in ;  
Congress with respect to that great bulwark of  
the public safety, it is for their consideration  
whether further provisions are not requisite  
for tne other contemplated objects of organiza­  
tion anil discipline. To give to this great maw  
of physical and mural force the efficiency which  
it merits, and is capable of receiving,  
it is indispensable that they should be  
instructed anil practiced in the mien j  
by which they are to be governed. Toward an  
accomplishment of this important work I j  
recommend for the consideration of Congress &#x27;  
the expediency of instituting a system which  
shall in the first Instance call into the field, at  
the public expense and for a given time, cer­  
tain portions of the commissioned and non­  
commissioned officers. The instruction and  
discipline thus acquired would gradually dif­  
fuse through the entire body of the militia that  
practical knowledge and promptitude for active  
service which are the great ends to be pursued.  
Experience has left no doubt either of the  
necessity or of the efficacy of competent mili­  
tary skill in those portions of an army in fitting  
it for the tinal duties which it may have to per­  
form.&quot;

Madison, in his message of December 5, 1810, recommends  
“ the establishment of a seminary of learning instituted by the  
national legislature within the limits of their exclusive juris¬  
diction, the expense of which might be defrayed out of the  
vacant grounds which have accrued to the nation within its  
limits.” In other words, he recommends a national university  
to be supported, not by appropriations from the Federal treas¬  
ury, nor by appropriations from the sale of public lands in  
general belonging to the Government, but by the sale of lands  
belonging to the Government situated within the District of  
Columbia.
