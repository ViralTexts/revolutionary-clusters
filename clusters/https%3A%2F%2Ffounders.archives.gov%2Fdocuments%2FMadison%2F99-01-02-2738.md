	Washington February 23rd. 1808.  
					  
					I have the Honor to transmit to you the Copies of certain Orders of Council which His Majesty has thought proper to issue in Consequence of the hostile Conduct of France towards the Navigation and Commerce of Great Britain and of Neutral States.  
					His Majesty has been induced hitherto to forbear recurring to Measures of this Nature by the Expectation that the Governments of the Neutral States, who have been the Objects of the French Decrees, would have been awakened to a just Sense of what they owe  
						to their Interests and own Rights, and would have interposed with Effect, either to prevent the Execution of the French Decrees, or to procure their Abrogation.  
					But His Majesty having been disappointed in this just Expectation, and perceiving that the Neutral Nations, so far from opposing any effectual Resistance, have Submitted to whatever Regulations France may have prescribed for giving Effect to her Decrees,  
						can no longer refrain from having Recourse to such Measures as by retorting on the Enemy the Inconveniences and Evils produced by his Injustice and Violence, may afford the only remaining Chance of putting an End to a System, the Perseverance in which is not more injurious to  
						His Majesty’s Dominions than to Nations not Parties to the War between Great Britain and France.  
					The Principle upon which His Majesty finds himself compelled to proceed, would justify a complete and unqualified Retaliation on His Part of the System announced and acted upon by France, in Respect to His Majesty’s Dominions: and His Majesty might  
						therefore have declared in a State of rigorous and unmitigated Blockade all the Coasts and Colonies of France and her Allies. Such a Measure the Maritime Power of Great Britain would have enabled His Majesty to enforce: nor would those Nations which have acquiesced, without  
						effectual Remonstrance, in the French Decree of Blockade, have derived any Right from the more perfect Execution of a corresponding Determination on the Part of His Majesty, to complain of His Majesty’s enforcing that Measure which the Enemy has executed imperfectly only from  
						the Want of the Means of Execution.  
					His Majesty, however, actuated by the same Sentiments of Moderation by which His Majesty’s Conduct has been uniformly governed, has been desirous of alleviating, as much as possible, the Inconveniences necessarily brought upon Neutral Nations by a State of  
						Things so unfavorable to the Commercial Intercourse of the World; and has therefore anxiously considered what Modifications it would be practicable to apply to the Principle upon which He is compelled to act, which would not, at the same Time that they might afford Relief  
						from the Pressure of that Principle upon Neutral or Friendly Nations, impede or enfeeble its Operation upon the Enemy.  
					In Pursuance of this Desire, the Order in Council, which, if it had ended with the Sixth Paragraph, would have been no more than a strict and justifiable Retaliation, for the French Decree of November 1806, proceeds, as you will observe, Sir, to provide  
						many material Exceptions, which are calculated to qualify the Operation of the Order upon Neutral Nations in general, but which must be considered as most peculiarly favorable to the particular Interests of the United States.  
					It will not escape you, Sir, that by this Order in Council, thus modified and regulated, the direct Intercourse of the United States with the Colonies of the Enemy is unrestrained: an Indulgence which, when it is considered to be (as it really is) not only  
						a Mitigation of that Principle of just Reprisal upon which the order itself is framed, but a Deviation, in favor of the United States, from that ancient and established Principle of Maritime Law by which the Intercourse with the Colonies of an Enemy, in Time of War, is  
						limited to the Extent which that Enemy was accustomed in Time of Peace to prescribe for it and which, by Reference to the Conduct of France in a Time of Peace, would amount to a complete Interdiction, cannot fail to afford to the American Government a Proof of the amicable  
						Disposition of His Majesty towards the United States.  
					You will observe, Sir, also that the Transportation of the Colonial Produce of the Enemy from the United States to Europe, instead of being altogether prohibited (which would have been the natural Retaliation for the rigorous and universal Prohibition of  
						British Produce and Manufactures by France) is freely permitted to the Ports of Great Britain, with the Power of subsequently re-exporting it to any Part of Europe under certain Regulations.  
					The Object of these Regulations will be the Establishment of such a protecting Duty, as shall prevent the Enemy from obtaining the produce of his own Colonies at a cheaper Rate than that of the Colonies of Great Britain. In this Duty it is evident that  
						America is no otherwise concerned than as being to make an Advance to that Amount for which it is in her own Power amply to indemnify herself at the Expence of the Foreign Consumer.  
					Another most important Relaxation of the Principles upon which His Majesty’s Orders proceed is that which licenses the Importation of all Flour and Meal, and all Grains, Tobacco and other Articles, the Produce of the Soil of America with the Exception of  
						Cotton, through the Ports of His Majesty’s Dominions, into those of His Enemies, without the Payment of any Duty on the Transit. This is, I beg leave to observe, an Instance in which His Majesty has deprived His Measure of its most efficacious and hurtful Operation against  
						the Enemy, through Motives of Consideration for the Interests of America. The Reason why His Majesty could not feel himself at Liberty, consistent with what was necessary for the Execution of His Purpose, in any tolerable Degree, to allow this Relaxation to apply to Cotton,  
						is to be found in the great Extent to which France has pushed the Manufacture of that Article, and the consequent Embarrassment upon her Trade which a heavy Impost upon Cotton, as it passes through   
					*Great Britain  
					*altered by the direction of Mr. Erskine  
					Danl. Brent.  
					to France, must necessarily produce.  
					I cannot refrain from calling the Attention of the Government of the United States to the Contrast between the different Modes in which His Majesty’s Orders and those of France are carried into Execution. By His Majesty’s, the utmost Consideration is  
						manifested for the Interests of those Nations whose Commerce He is reluctantly compelled to impede, and ample Time allowed for their becoming acquainted with the new Regulations and conforming to them. Whereas France, without any previous Notice, and without any Interval,  
						applies her Orders to Trade already entered upon in Ignorance of Any such Orders, and subjects to Condemnation Ships, whose Voyages, when commenced, were in strict Conformity to all the Regulations at that Time promulgated by France.  
					Even with these and other Modifications, His Majesty is not unaware that a Measure extorted from Him by the Injustice of the Enemy, must inevitably produce Inconveniences to the Neutral Parties who are affected by its Operation.  
					The Right of His Majesty to resort to Retaliation, cannot be questioned. The Suffering occasioned to Neutral Parties is incidental, and not of His Majesty’s Seeking.  
					In the Exercise of this undoubted Right, His Majesty has Studiously endeavoured to avoid Aggravating unnecessarily the Inconveniences suffered by the Neutral. And I am commanded by His Majesty, especially to represent to the Government of the United States  
						the earnest Desire of His Majesty to see the Commerce of the World restored once more to that Freedom which is necessary for its Prosperity, and His Readiness to Abandon the System which has been forced upon him whenever the Enemy shall retract the Principles which have  
						rendered it necessary; but His Majesty entertains the Conviction, upon which alone His present Measures are founded, that it would be vain to hope for Such a Retraction, until the Enemy shall himself have been made to feel a Portion of the Evils which he has endeavoured to  
						inflict upon others. I have the Honor to be, with great Consideration and Respect, Sir, your most obedient humble Servant

I have the honour to transmit  
to you the copies of certain orders  
of council which his majesty has  
thought proper to issue, in conse-  
quence of the hostile conduct of  
  
¥  
  
AMERICAN STATE PAPERS.  
  
France towards the navigation and  
commerce of Great Britain and of  
neutral states.  
  
His majesty has hed induced  
hitherto to forbear recurring to  
measures of this nature by the ex-  
pectation that the governments of  
the neutral states, who have been  
the objects of the French decrees,  
would have been awakened to a  
just sense of what they owe to  
their interests and own rights, and  
  
would have interposed with effect,  
either to prevent the execution of  
the French decrees, or procure  
their abrogation.  
  
But his majesty having been  
disappointed in this just expecta-  
tion, and perceiving that the neu-  
tral nations, so far from opposing  
any effectual resistance, have sub-  
mitted to whatever regulations  
France may have prescribed for  
giving effect to her decrees, canno  
longer refrain from having re-  
course to such measures as, by re-  
torting on the enemy the incon-  
veniences and evils produced by  
his injustice and violence, may af-  
ford the only remaining chance of  
putting an end to a system, the  
perseverance in which is not  
more injurious to his majesty’s  
dominions than to nations not par-  
’ ties to the war between Great  
Britain and France.  
  
The principle, upon which his  
majesty finds himself compelled  
to proceed, would justify a com-  
plete and unqualified retaliation,  
on his part, of the system announc-  
ed and acted upon by France, in  
respect to his majesty’s domin-  
ions ; and his majesty might, there-  
fore, have declared in a state of  
rigorous and unmitigated block-  
ade all the coasts and colonies of  
France and her allies. Such a  
  
measure the maritime power of  
  
439  
  
Great Britain would have enabled  
his majesty to enforce; nor would  
those nations, which have acqui-  
esced, without effectual remon-  
strance, in the French decree of  
blockade, have derived any right  
from the perfect: execution of a  
corresponding determination on  
the part of his majesty, to com-  
plain of his majesty’s enforcing  
that measure, which the enemy  
has executed imperfectly, only  
from the want of the means of ex-  
ecution.  
  
His majesty, however, actuated  
by the same sentiments of moder-  
ation by which his majesty’s con-  
duct has been uniformly govern-  
ed, has been desirous of alleviat-  
ing, as much as possible, the in-  
conveniences necessarily brought  
upon neutral nations by a state of  
things so unfavourable to the com-  
mercial intercourse of the world;  
and has therefore anxiously con-  
sidered what modifications it would  
be practicable to apply to the prin-  
ciple upon which he is compelled  
to act, which would not, at the  
same time that they might afford  
relief from the pressure of that  
principle upon neutral or friendly  
nations, impede or enfeeble its  
operation upon the enemy.  
  
In pursuance of this desire, the  
order in council, which, if it had  
ended with the sixth paragraph,  
would have been no more than a  
strict and justifiable retaliation for  
the French decree of November,  
1806, proceeds, as you will ob-  
serve, sir, to provide many mate-  
rial exceptions, which are calcu-  
lated to qualify the operation of  
the order upon neutral nations in  
general, but which must be con-  
sidered as most peculiarly favour-  
able to the particular interests of  
the United States.

It will not éscape you, sir, that  
by this order in council, thus mo-  
dified and regulated, the direct in-  
tercourse of the United States  
with the colonies of the enemy  
is unrestrained: an indulgence  
which, when it is considered to be  
(as it really is) not only a mitiga-  
tion of that principle of just repri-  
sal upon which the order itself is  
framed, but a deviation, in favour  
of the United States, from that an-  
- clent and established principle of  
maritime law, by which the inter-  
course with the colonies of an  
enemy in time of war is limited to  
the extent which. that enemy was  
accustomed in time of peace to  
prescribe for it, and which, by re-  
ference to the conduct of France  
in a time of peace, would amount  
to a complete interdiction, cannot  
fail to afford tothe American go-  
vernment a proof of the amicable  
disposition of his majesty towards  
the United States.  
  
You will observe, sir, also, that  
the transportation of the colonial  
produce of the enemy from the  
United States to Europe, instead  
of being altogether prohibited  
(which ‘would have been the na-  
tural retaliation for the rigorous  
and universal prohibition of Bri-  
tish produce and manufactures by  
France) is freely permitted to the  
ports of Great Britain, with the  
power of subsequently re-export-  
ing it toany partof Europe, under  
certain regulations.  
  
The object of these regulatiqns  
will be the establishment of sucha  
protecting duty, as shall prevent  
the enemy from obtaining the pro-  
duce of his own colonies at a  
cheaper rate than that of the colo-  
nies of Britain. In this duty it is  
evident that America is no other-  
wise concerned than as being to  
  
AMERICAN REGISTER.  
  
make an advance to that amount,  
for which it is in her own power  
amply to indemnify herself at the  
expence of the foreign consumer.  
  
Another most important relaxa-  
tion of the principles upon which  
his majesty’s orders proceed, is  
that which licences the importa-  
tion of all flour and meal, and all  
grains, tobacco, and other articles  
the produce of the soil of America,  
with the exception of cotton,  
through the ports of his majesty’s  
dominions, into those of his ene-  
mies, without the payment of any  
duty on the transit. This is, I  
beg leave to observe, an instance in  
which his majesty has deprived  
his measure of its most efficacious  
and hurtful operation against the  
enemy, through motives of consi-  
deration for the interests of Ame-  
rica, The reason why his majes-  
ty could not feel himself at liberty,  
consistent with what was neces-  
sary for the execution of his pur=  
pose, in any tolerable degree, to  
allow this relaxation to apply to  
cotton is to be found in the great  
extent to which l’rance has push-  
ed the manufacture of that article,  
and the consequent embarrass-  
ment upon her trade which a  
heavy impost upon cotton, as it  
passes through Great Britain to  
I’rance, must necessarily produce.  
  
I cannot refrain from calling the  
attention of the government of the  
United States to the contrast be-  
tween the different modes in which  
his majesty’s orders and those of  
France are carried into execution.  
By his majesty’s, the utmost consi-  
deration is manifested for the in-  
terests of those nations whose com-  
merce he is reluctantiy compelled  
to impede, and ample time allow.  
ed for their becoming acquainted  
with the new regulations, and

conforming to them; whereas  
France, without any previous no-  
tice, and without any interval,  
applies her orders to trade already  
entered upon, in ignorance of any  
such orders, and subjects to con-  
demnation ships, whose voyages,  
when commenced, were in strict  
conformity to all the regulations at  
that time promulgated by France.  
  
Even with these and other mo-  
difications, his majesty is not un-  
aware, that a measure extorted  
from him by the injustice of the  
enemy must inévitably produce  
inconveniences to the neutral par-  
ties who are affected by its opera-  
tion.  
  
The right of his majesty to re-  
sort to retaliation cannot be ques-  
tioned. The suffering occasioned  
to neutral parties is incidental, and  
not of his majesty’s seeking.  
  
In the exercise of this undoubt-  
ed right, his majesty has studiously  
endeavoured to avoid aggravating  
unnecessarily the inconveniences  
suffered by the neutral. And I  
am commanded. by his majesty  
especially to represent to the go-  
vernament of the United States the  
earnest desire of his majesty to  
see the commerce of the world  
restored once more to that free-  
dom which is necessary for its  
prosperity; and his readiness to  
abandon the system which has  
been forced upon him, whenever  
the enemy shail retract the prin-  
ciples which have rendered it ne-  
cessary: but his majesty enter-  
tains the conviction, upon which  
alone his present measures are  
founded, that it would be vain to  
hope for sucha retraction, until  
the enemy shall himself have been  
made to feel a portion of the evils  
which he has endeavoured to in-  
flict upon others.

Washington, February 23d, 1SC8.  
ol R y  
I have the honor to transmit to yon the 1  
copies of certain orders of Council wh ich his i  
majesty hus thought proper to issuv in con- !  
i sequence of the hostile conduct of France  
towards the navigation and commerce of,  
Britain and of neutral states.  
His majesty has been induced hitherto to I  
lorbear recurring to measures of this na- I  
ture by the expectation that the govern-&#x27;  
ments of the neutral states, wlio have been  
objects of the French Decrees, would ha\e  
Jcen awakened to a just sense of what they  
owe to their interests and own rights, and  
would have interposed with effect, either to  
prevent the execution of the French de­  
crees, or to procure their abrogation.  
.But his Majesty having been disappoint­  
m?. , S Jnst expectation, and perceiving  
  
~ ,,*”&#x27;*ons, so tar front oppos­  
ing any effectual resistance, have submitted  
to whatever regulations France may have  
prescribed for giving effect to her decrees  
can no longer refrain from having recourse  
to such measures as by retorting on the ene­  
my the inconveniences and evils produced  
by his injustice and violence, may afford the  
only remaining chance of putting an end  
to a system, the perseverance in which is  
not more injurious to his majesty’s dominions  
than to nations not parties to the war be­  
tween Great-Britain and France.  
I lie principle, upon which his majesty  
finds himself compelled to proceed, would  
justify a complete and unqualified retaliation  
on nspart of the system announced and act­  
ed upon by Frame, in respect to his majes­  
tj s dominions: &amp; his majesty might, there- j  
oi*-, have declared in astute of rigorous tk I  
unmitigated blockade, all the coasts andco­  
lomes of France and her allies. Such a  
measure, the maritime power of Great-Bn- I  
tain would have enabled his majesty to en- j  
force : nor would those nations, which have  
acquiesced, without effectual remonstrance  
in the French decree of blockade, have de­  
rived any right from the perfect execution  
of a corresponding determination on the part  
1° |1IS majesty, to complain of his majesty’s  
[enforcing that measure, which the enemy  
has executed imperfectly, only from the  
want of the means of execution.  
His majesty however actuated by the same  
sentiments of moderation by which his ma­  
jesty s conduct has been uniformly govern­  
ed, has been desirous of alleviating, js  
much as possible, the inconveniences nccc -  
i warily brought upon neutral nations by a I  
state of things so unfavorable to the com­  
mercial intercourse of the world ; and lias  
therefore anxiously considered what modi­  
fications it would lie practicable to apply to  
the principle upon which he is compelled  
to act, which would not, at the same time  
that they might afford relief from the pres­  
sure of that principle upon neutral or fricndl.  
nations, impede or enfeeble its operation up­  
on the enemy.  
In pursuance of this desire, the order in  
council, which, if it had ended with the sixth  
paragraph, would have been no more than  
c* str*c* a,,fl justifiable retaliation for the  
1 rench decree of November 1806, proceeds,  
as you will observe, sir, to provide many  
material exceptions, which are calculated t&lt;  
qualify the operation of the order upon neu­  
tral nations in general, but which must be  
  
considered as most p&gt;»cAU3rly firoriHir H  
tlw particular interests of the U. States.  
It will not escape you, sir, that by this or  
dor in couucil, thus modified and regulated,  
the direct intercourse of the United States  
with the colonies of tin* enemy nnrestrain­  
ed ; an indulgence which when it is consi­  
dered to he* (as it really is) not only a mi­  
tigation ot that principle ot just reorisa! up­  
on which the order itself is framed, but a  
deviation in favor of the United States, froiA  
that, ancient and established principle of  
maritime law, by which the* intercourse with  
the colonies ot an enemy in time of war is »i­  
mited to the extent which that enemy was  
accustomed in tinib ot peace, to prescribe  
mr it, and which by refevenc** to the conduct  
of trance in a time of peace, would amount  
to a complete interdiction, cannot fail to uf­  
.ord to the American government a proof ot  
the amicable, disposition of his majesty to­  
wards the United States.  
^ ou will dbserve, sir, also that thetrans­  
poi t.ition of the colonial produce of the riier  
my trom the U* States to Europe, instead  
ot being altogether prohibited (which would  
have been the natdral retaliation for the ri­  
gorous and universal prohibition of British  
pioduce and manufactures by Erancc) &#x27;is  
freely permitted to the ports of G. Britain,  
witn rue power of subsequently exporting it  
lo any part oi Europe, under certain regu­  
lations.  
T hy‘object ot these regulations will be the  
establishment of such a protecting duty, as  
shu!&#x27; prevent the enemy from obtaining the  
produce ot his own colonies at a cheaper rate  
than that of the co onies of G. Britain. In  
Bi s duty it isevidc-r that America is no o­  
t her wise concerned than as being to make ah  
advance to that amount for which it is in her  
own power imply to indemnify herself at the  
expence of tin* loreign consumer.  
Another most inn r ant relaxation of the  
principles upon which nis tnaje-.v’s orders  
pi ocecd, is that which licenses the importa­  
tion of all Hour and meal, and all grains, to­  
bacco and other articles, the produce of the  
soi .ot America with the exception of cotton,  
! m&#x27;u5h t.ie ports of hi., majesty’s dominions,  
i &#x27;••&gt; those of h s enemies, without the pay­  
uk nt ot any duty on the transit. This ,s. I  
beg leave to ob erv.^ an instance in which his  
^:is,-‘Cp’*i* ed liis measure of its most  
  
1**1 -.u* uperiiuon against the  
enemy, through -.a Lives of consideration for  
tue interests of America. The reason whv  
• us iii,ties v could not feel himself at liberty  
consistent with what was ne.ce-»ary for the  
execution &lt;&gt;t Ids purpose, in any tolerable de­  
gree, to allow tlds relaxation to apply to cot­  
ton, is to be found in tii • [&gt;reat extent to  
which France has pushe*! the manufacture  
ot that article, and the consequent embar­  
rassment upon her trade which a heavy im­  
post upon cotton, as it pa -e dirough Great  
Britain to France, must no css .rile produce.  
I cannot refrain from calling the attention  
bf the government of the U State*- to the  
contrast between the different m ies in  
which Ins majesty’s orders and those of  
V ranee are carried into execution By his  
majesty&#x27;s, the utmost consideration is mani­  
fested tor the interests ot those nations whose  
commerce lie is reluctantly competed to im­  
pede, and ample time allowed for their be­  
coming acquainted with the new regulations  
and conforming to them.—Whereas France,  
without any previous notice, and without a­  
ny interval, applies her orders to trade al­  
ready entered upon in ignorance of am* such  
orders, and subjects to condemnation ships,  
whose voyages, when commenced, were in  
sti ict conformity to all the regulations at that  
time promulgated by France.  
T\en with these and other modifications,  
his majesty is not unaware that a measure ex­  
torted from him by the injustice of the ene­  
rr* * must inevitably produce inconveniences  
t-o the neutral parties who are effected by its  
operation. 1  
1 he right of Ills majesty to resort to retali­  
ation cannot be questioned. The suffering  
occasio: ed o neutral oa t ems incidental, and  
not oi us majesty’s seeking  
In the exercise of this undoubted right his  
majesty has studiously endeavored to avoid  
ag &gt;i iting unnecessarily the inconvenien­  
ces suff ied by the neutral. And I am cora­  
mamleo &gt;. hismaje. tv, especially, to repre­  
sent to the government of the United States,  
tue earnest desire of his majesty, to see the  
commerce of the world restored once more  
to that freedom which is necessary for its  
pr isperity ; and im readiness to abandon the  
system which has been forced upon him when­  
ever the enemy shall retract the principles  
which have rendered it iiecessahv ; but his  
m ijestv entertains the conviction, upon which  
alone his present measures are founded, tin i  
it would l&gt;f&gt; vain to hope for such a retracti­  
on, until the enemy shall himself have been  
made to feel a portion of the evils which lie  
has endeavored to inflict Upon others.

oc i ation and respect, sir, your most obedient  
humble servant

I have the honor to transmit to you n  
he copies of certain orders of Council t  
vliich his majesty has thought proper to a  
ssue In consequence of the hostile conduct t  
&gt;f Pr ince towards the navigation and com- »  
oerce of Great Britain and of neutral ••  
tates  
Hrs majesty has been induced hitherto to f  
orbear recurring to measures of this na­  
ure by the expectation that the govern- n  
mrts of neutral states, whohave been the r  
injects of the Trench decrees, would have &quot;  
teen awake ned to a just sense of what thrv 11  
&gt;we to their interests 8c own rights, lc would &quot;  
lave interposed with effect, either to pre­  
ent the execution of the French Decrees, *  
r to prderre their Vogatton.  
But his majesty having been disappoint­  
ed in this just expectation, and perceiving i,  
  
hat the neutral nation*, sof.it from oppo-ir  
mg any effectual resistance, have submit, i  
ed to whatever regulations France may v  
lave prescribed for giving effect to her dc- &#x27;  
:rees, can no longer refrain from having 1  
•ccourse to such measures as by retorting ’  
ki the enemy the inconveniencies and evils  
jroduced by his injustice and violence, may 1  
ilfvird the only remaining chance of putting  
in end to a system, the perseverance in  
vhich is not more injurious to his majesty’s  
hnninions than to nations not parties to the  
.var between Great Britain and France.  
The principle, upon which his majesty  
5ads himself compelled to proceed, would  
ustify a complete and unqualified retalia­  
tion on his part of the system announced  
Mid acted upon by France, in respect to his  
majesty’s dominions : Sc his majesty might,  
then have declared in a state of ri­  
gorous and unmitigated blockade, all the  
toasts and Colonies ol France and her allies.  
tUieh a measure, the murit me power oi G.  
Britain would have enabled his majesty to  
inforcti : nor would those rations, which  
tiave acquiesced, without effectual remon­  
strance, in the French decree of blockade,  
liave derived any right from the per­  
fect execution of a correspond ingt&#x27;c ei mina­  
lioii on the part of his majesty, to complain  
of his no.jesty’s enforcirg that measure,  
which the enemy has executed imperfect­  
ly, only from the want of the means oi exe­  
cution.  
His majesty however actuated by the  
same sentiments of moderation by which  
liis majesty’s conduct has been uniformly&#x27;  
governed, has been des rou3 of alleviating,  
as much as possible, the income niercies  
necessarily brought upon neutral nations i  
by a state o. things so unfavorable to the  
commercial intercourse of the world ; and j  
has therefore anxiously considered what i  
modifications it would he nracticablc to an­  
  
ply to the principle upon which he is com­  
pelled to net, which would not. at the same  
time that they might afford relief fr m the  
pressure ot that principle upon neutral or  
friendly nations, impede or enfeeble its o­  
prration upon the enemy.  
In pursuance of this desire, the order in  
council, which, it it had ended w:th the  
f ix&#x27;h par graph, would have been no more  
than (i strict a d justifiable retaliation for  
the French deevte oi Nov. 1S06, proceeds,  
as you w.ll obs&#x27; rve, sir. to provide many  
material exceptions, which are calculated  
to quality *Uie operation of the order upon  
neutral nations in general, but wuich must  
he considered as most peculiarly f.tvied to  
the particular interests of the United  
Stales.  
It will net escape you, sir, that by this  
order in council, thus mod fkd and regula­  
ted, the di ect intercourse of the U Mates  
with tae co.onies ol the enemy is unrestrain­  
cd ; an indulgence which, when it is consi­  
dered to be (as it really is) not only a mi­  
tigation of that principle ol just reprisal up­  
on which t.ie order itself is framed, but a  
deviation in favor of the United States,  
from that ancient and established principle  
of maritime law, by which the intercourse  
with the colonies of nn enemy in time ef war i  
is limited to the extent which that enemy  
was accustomed in time of peace to pre­  
scribe Inr it, and which, by reference to  
the conduct of France in a time of peace,  
wou-d amount to a complete interdiction,  
c..lino, tail to afford to the American govern­  
ment ;t proof of the amicable disposition  
2t lus majrsty towards lie Unsted States.  
You Wi.l otaerve, s.r, also that the trans­  
portation of the colonial produce of ihe en­  
emy from the United States to Europe, in­  
stead of being altogether prohibited (which  
would have been the natural rctal aiton for  
the rigorous and universal proh bit on of  
British produce and manufactures by  
Franct) is freely permitted to the ports of  
fj. Britain, with the power of subsequent  
re-exponmg i, to any part of Europe, un­  
der certiiin regulations.  
Th object ot these regulations w*H be  
ihe establishment i f such a protecting duty,  
is shall prevent the enemy from obt ,ning  
:he p educe of his own colonies at a cheap  
- r rate tlian that of flic colonies ol Cr. Bri  
-i-ir*. In this du^y it ia evident that Ame  
rica is no otherwise concerned th n us be  
mg to tnnke a i advance to ihat amount for

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
Washington, February 2id, 1808. &#x27;  
SIR, . I  
I have the honor to transmit to vou  
the copies of certain orders ot Council j  
which his majesty has thought proper to  
issue in consequence of the hostile con­  
duct of France towards the navigation  
.and commerce of Great Britain and of  
■neutral slates.  
His majesty has been induced hither­  
to to iorbear recut t ing to measures of  
this nature by the expectation that the  
governments of the neutral states, who  
have been the objects of the French De­  
crees, would have been pwakened to a  
just sense of what they owe to their in­  
terests and own rights, and would have  
interposed with effect, cither to prevent  
the execution of the French Decreet, or  
to procure their abrogation.  
But his majesty having been disap­  
pointed m this just expectation, and per­  
ceiving that the neutral nations, so far  
from opposing any effectual resistance,  
have submitted to whatever regulations  
France may have prescribed for giving  
etteEl to her decrees, can no longer re­  
frain from having recourse to such mea­  
•arenas by retorting on the enemy the  
inconveniences and evils produced bv ,  
his injustice and violence, may afford  
the only remaining chance of putting an ;  
end tq a syatem, the pcrscvcrence in  
which is wot more injurious to his ma­  
jesty *s dominions than to nations not par­  
ties to the war between Great Britain  
and France.  
  
The principle, upon which his majes­  
ty finds himself compelled lo proceed,  
would justify a complete and unqualified  
retaliation on his part of the system an­  
nounced and acted upon by France, in i  
respect to his majesty’s dominions: and I  
his majesty might, therefore, have de­  
clared in a state of rigorous and unmiti­  
gated blockade, alt the coasts and colo­  
nies of Francs and her allies. Such a  
measure, the maritime power of Great  
Britain would have enabled his majesty  
to enforce : nor would those nations,  
which have acquiesced, without effectu­  
al remonstrance, in the French decree  
of blockade, have derived any right  
from the perfect eaecurion of a corres­  
ponding determination on the part of  
his majesty, to complain of his majesty’s  
enforcing that measure, which the ene­  
my has executed imperlectly, only from  
the want of the means of execution.  
His majesty however actuated by the  
•toe sentiments of moderation by which  
&#x27; bis majesty’s conduct hat been uniform­  
ly governed, has been desirous of alle­  
viating, as much as possible, the incon­  
veniences necessarily brought upon neu­  
tral nations by a state so unfa­  
vourable to the asminqrcmtAkcrccuse of  
the world ; and has therejjpre anxiously  
considered what modificatioqb.it w*ul&lt;l  
he practicable to apply to ifcw principle  
upon which he is compelled to act, which  
would not, at the apbMri- time that they  
might afford relic/ Ikom&#x27;lhe pressure of  
that principle upon neutral or friendly  
nations, impede rtv enfeeble its operati­  
on upon the enemy.  
In pursuance of this desire, the order  
in Council, which, if it had ended with  
the sixth paragraph, would have been  
no more than a strict and justifiable reta­  
liation for the French decree of Novem­  
ber 1806, prbceeds, if you wiH observe.  
Sir, to piovide many material excepti­  
ons, which are calculated to qualify the  
operation of the order upon neutral nati­  
ons in genetal, but which mast be consi­  
dered as most peculiarly favourable to  
t)ne particular interests of tl»e United  
States. i &#x27; V  
It v»ill not escape you, Sir, that by  
this order in Council, thus modified and  
regulated, the direct intercourse of the  
United States xqtb colonic* of the ene­  
my is unrestrained; an indulgence which  
&#x27; it  
  
| r. - • • - f-ar­  
when it it considered to Lr (as it rtally  
is) not only a mitigation of that princi- j  
pie of just reprisal upon which the order i  
itself is framed, but a deviation in favor I  
of the United States, from that antient  
and established principle of maritime  
law, by which the intercourse with the  
colonies of an enemy in time of war is  
limited bo the eatcat which that enemy  
was accustomed in time of peace to pre­  
scribe for it, and which, by reference  
to the conduct of France in a time of &#x27;  
peace, would amount to a complete in­  
terdiction, cannot fail to afford to the  
American government a proof of the  
amicable disposition of his majesty to­  
wards the United States.  
You will observe, Sir, also that the  
transportation of the colonial produce of  
the enemy from the United States to  
Europe,&#x27; instead ot being altogether pro­  
hibited (which would have been the na­  
tural retaliation for the rigorous and uni­  
versal prohibition of British produce and  
manufactures by France) is freely per­  
mitted to the ports ot Great Britain,  
with the power of subsequently re-ex­  
porting it 10 any part of Europe, under  
certain regulations.  
The object of these regulations will  
be the cstablisment of such a protecting  
duty, as %jull prevent the enemy from  
obtaining the produce of h» own colo­  
nies at a cheaper rate than that of the  
colonies of Great Britain. In this duty  
it is evident that America » no otherwise  
concerned than as being p make an ad­  
vance to that amount forwhich it is in  
her own power amply to indemnify her- t  
self at the expense of thi foreign consu­  
mer.  
Another most impoiisnt relaxation of  
the principles upon witch his majesty’s  
orders proceed is lhatwhich licenses the  
importation of all fisur and meal, and  
all grains, tobacco and other articles, the  
produce of the soil cf America with the  
exception of cotton,through the ports of ,  
his majesty’s dominions, into those of  
his enemies, without the paj mentof any  
duty of the transit. This is, I beg leave  
to observe, an instmee in which his ma­  
jesty has deprived his measures of their  
most .efficacious and hurtful operation  
against the &lt;jnemy, through motives of  
consideration for the interests of Ame­  
rica. The reason why his majesty cosld  
not feci hiqtself at liberty, Consistent  
with what wit necessary for thi exi.u­  
tion of his purpose, in any tolerable de­  
gree, to allow this relaxation to apply to  
cotton, it to be found in (he great ex­  
tent to which France has pushed the ma­  
nufacture of that article, and the conse­  
quent embarrassment upon her trade  
with a heavy impost upon cotton, as it  
passes through Great Br itain to France,  
must necessarily produce.  
  
I cannot refrain from calling the at­  
tention. of the government of the Unit&lt; d  
States to the contrast between the dif.  
ferent modes in which his majesty’s or­  
ders and those of France are carried in­  
to execution. By his majesty&#x27;s, the ut­  
most consideration is manifested for  
the interests of those nations whose com­  
merce he is reluctantly compelled to im­  
pede, and ample time allowed for th. ir  
becoming acquainted with the new re­  
gulations and conforming to them_  
Whereas France, without any previous  
hotice, and without any interval, ap­  
plies het orders to trade already entered  
upon in ignorance of any such orders,  
and subjects to condemnation ships,  
whose voyages, when commenced, were  
in strict conformity tcall the regulations  
at that time promulgated by France.  
F.ven with these and other modifica­  
tions, his majestv is not unaware that a  
measure extorted from him by the injus­  
tice of the enemy, must inevitably pro­  
duce inepuvemences to the neutral par­  
ties who are affected by its operation.  
The right of his majestv to resort to  
retaliation cannot be questioned. The  
&#x27; suffering occasioned to neutral parties is  
incidental, and nut of his majesty&#x27;s seek­  
ing­  
| In the exercise ofthis undoubted right  
his majesty has studiously endeavoured  
to avoid aggravating unnecessarily the  
inconveniences suffered by the neutral.  
And I am commanded by his majesty,  
! especially, to represent to the govern­  
ment of ths United States, the earnest  
desire of his nuyesty, to see the com­  
I mercc of the world restored once more  
to that freedom which is necessary for  
its prosperity; and his readiness to a­  
bandon the system which has been for­  
ced upon him, whenever the enemy shall  
detract the principles which have ren­  
dered it necessary ; but his majesty en­  
tertains the conviction, upon which a­  
lone his present measures are founded,  
that it would be vain to hope for such a  
’ retraction, until the enemy hirdself shall  
have been made to fccl a portion of the  
  
evils wi.ivli be has endeavoured to in*  
diet upon others.  
I have the honor to be, with great  
consideration and respect. Sir, jour  
most obedient humble servant

Washington, February 23c?, 1808.  
Sir, *  
I have the honour to transmit to you the copips  
of certain orders of Council which iiis majesty has  
thought proper to issue in consequence of the hos­  
tile conduct of Fiance towards the navigation and  
coni ner e of Great Britain and of neutral States.  
His majesty has been induced hitherto‘to forbear  
reeorring to measures of this nature by the expec­  
tation that th* governments of the neutral states,  
who hi e been the objects of the French decrees,  
Would nave he-n awakened to a just sense of what  
thrv n.\c to their interests and own rights, and  
would have in&#x27;erp ised with effect, either to prevent  
the execution of the French decrees, or to procure  
their abrogation.  
But bis m jesty having been disappointed in this  
just expectation,and perceiving that the neutral na­  
t’ons, so far from opposing any effectual resistance,  
have submitted to whatever regulations France may  
have prescribed for giving effect to her decrees, can  
no longer refrain from having recourse to such mea­  
sures as by retorting on the enemy the inconveni­  
ences and evils produced by his injustice and vio­  
lence, may afford the only remaining chance of put­  
ting an end to a system, the perseverance in which  
is not more injurious to his majesty’s dominions  
than to nations not parties to the war between  
Great Britain and France.  
The principle, upon which his majesty finds liim­  
sell compelled to proceed, would justify a complete  
and unqualified retaliation on bis part of the system  
announced and acted upon by France, in respect to  
hi9 majesty’s dominions : and bis majesty might,  
therefore, have declared in a state of rigorous and  
unmitigated blockade, all tbe coasts and colonies of  
France ana her allies. Such a measure, the mart  
time power of Great Britain would have inabled  
his majesty to enforce : nor would those nations^  
whKh have acquiesced, without effectual remon­  
strance, in tbe Fiench decree of blockade, have de  
rived any i.ght from the perfect execution of a cor­  
responding determination on the pan of bis majes­  
ty, to eomplain of bis majesty’s enlorcing that  
measure, which the enemy has executed imperfect­  
ly, oniv from the want of the means of execution.  
I Its majesty however actuated by the same senti­  
nvntsof rnodeiation by which his majesty’s con­  
duct has been uniformly governed, has been desirous  
of alleviating, as much as possible, the inrnnvcni­  
.ern es necessarily brought upon neutral nations bv  
a state ol things so unfavorable to tbe commercial  
intercourse of the world; and has therefoie anxi­  
ously considered what modifications it would be  
practicable to apply to the pnnciple upon w hich he  
is compelled to act, which would not, at the same  
time that they might afford relief from the pres­  
sure of that principle upon iicuti.il or friendly  
nations, impede or enfeeble its operations upon the  
enemy.  
  
In pursuance of this desire, the order in council,  
vhiclt, if it hud ended with the sixth paragraph,  
would have been no more than a strict and justifia­  
ble retaliation lor the Fren&gt;-h decree of November,  
1806, proceeds, as you will observe, sir, to provide  
many material exceptions, which are calculated to  
qualify the operation of the order upon neutral na­  
tions in general, but whirl) must be considered as  
most peculiarly favourable to the particular inte­  
rests of the United States.  
It will not eseape you, sir, that by this order in  
council, thus modified and regulated, the direct in­  
tercourse of the United States with the colonies of  
the enemy is unrestrained : and indulgence which,  
when it is considered to he (as it really is) not only  
a mitigation of that principle of just reprisal upon  
which the order itself is framed, hut a deviation in  
favour of I he United States, from that ancient and  
established principle of maritime law, by which  
the intercourse with the colonies of an enemy in  
time of war. is limited to the extent which that ene­  
my was accustomed in time of peace to prescribe  
for it, and which, by reference to the conduct of  
France in a time of pface, would amount to a com­  
plete interdiction, cannot fail to afford to the Ame­  
rican government tf proof of till amicable dispositi­  
on of bis majesty towards tin* United States.  
You will observe, sir, also that the transportation  
1 of the colonial produce of the enemy from the U­  
nited States to Europe, ir.-tead of being altoget! e.  
prohibited (which would have been the natural reta­  
liation fur the rigorous and universal prohibition oi  
British produce and manufactures by France) i»  
  
freely permitted to (tie ports of Gteat Bfitakr, witti  
the power of subsequently re-exporting it&#x27;to any  
part of Europe, under certain regulations.  
The object of these regulations&#x27;will be the esta­  
blishment of such a protecting duty, as shall pre­  
vent the enemy from obtaining the produce of his  
own colonies at a cheaper rate than that of the co­  
lonies of Great Britain. In this duty it is evident  
that America is no otherwise concerned than «9he­  
ing to make an advance to that amount for which  
it is in her own power amply to indemnify herself  
at the expence of the foreign consumer.  
Another most important relaxation of the prin­  
ciples upon which his majesty’s orders proceed is  
that which licences the importation of all flour and  
meal, and all grains, tobacco and other articles,  
the produce of the soil of America with the excep­  
tion of cotton, through the ports of hit majesty’s  
dominions, into those of his enemies, without the  
payment of any duty on the transit. This is, 1  
beg leave to observe, an instance in which his ma­  
jesty has deprived his measure of its most efficaci­  
ous and hurtful operation against the enemy, through  
motives of consideration for the interests of Ame­  
rica The reason why his majesty could not feel  
himself at libel ty, consistant with what was neces­  
sary for the execution of his purpose, in any tole­  
rable degree, to allow this relaxation to apply to  
cotton, is lo be found in the great extent to which  
France lias pushed I lie manufacture of that article,  
and the consequent embarrassment upon her trade  
which a heavy impost upon cotton, as it passes  
through Great Britain to France, must necessaiily  
produce.  
  
I cannot refrain from railing the attention of the  
governinfill of the United States to the contrast  
between the different modi t in whirh his majesty&#x27;s  
orders and those of France are carried into rxeruti­  
lion. By his majesty’s, the utmost consideration  
is mam lasted tor the interests of those nations whose  
rommeire he is reluctantly compelled to impede,  
and ample time allowed for their Iwroming acquaint  
ed with the new regulations and conforming to  
them.—Whereas France, without any pMvions no  
tire, and without any interval, applies tier orders  
to tiade aheady entered upon in ignorance of any  
such orders, and subjects to condemnation ships,  
whose voyages, when commenced, were in strict  
conformity to all the regulations at that time pro­  
mulgated by France.  
Even with these and other modifications, his ma­  
jesty is not unaware that a measure extorted from  
him by the injustice of the enemy, must inevitably  
produce inconvenient ies to the neutral parties who  
are affected by its operation. ~  
The right of his majesty to resort to retaliation  
cannot Le questioned. The suffering occasioned to  
neutral parties :s incidental, and not of bis majesty’s  
sei kinu.  
in the exercise ol this undoubted right his ma­  
jesty has studiously endeavored to avoid aggravating  
unnecessarily the inconveniences suffered by the  
neutral. And 1 am commanded by his majesty,  
especially, to represent to the government of the  
United St lies, the earnest desire of his niojesty, to  
see the cormneirp ol the world restored once more to  
that Ireedom whirh is necessary for its prosperity ;  
and his readiness to abandon the system whirh has  
heen forced upon him, whenever the enemy shall  
retract the principles whirh have rendered it neces­  
saiy j hut hts majesty entertains the rnnvirtinn,  
upon whirh alone his present measures are founded,  
that it would be vain to hope for such a retraction,  
until the enemy shall himself have iiren made Ph !&lt;el  
a proportion o| the evils which he has endeavoured  
to inffiet upon others.  
1 have the honour to he, with great consideration  
and respect, sir,, your most obedient humble ser­  
vant

has thought proper to issue tn con­  
arquence of the .-hostile conduct of  
(Franco toward: the narration and

netltral states &quot; , . . , .  
His majesty has been inckced hi­  
therto in forbear recurring lo mea­  
sures of this nature by the expecta­  
tion that the gorernments oi the  
neutral states, who hare been the  
objects of the French Decrees, would  
hare been awakened to a just sense  
of what they owe to their interests  
and own right and would have in­  
terposed with effect,, either to prt­  
Veut the execution of the French  
decrees or to procure their abro­  
gation.But his majesty having been, dis­  
appointed in this just expectation,  
and perceiving that the neutral &quot;na­  
tions, o far from opposing any ef­  
fectual resistance, have submitted  
to whatever regulation France may  
have precribed for giving effect to  
her decrees, can no longer refrain  
from having recourse to such mea­  
sures as by retorting oh the enemy  
the inconveniences and evils produc­  
ed By his injustice and violence, may  
afford the only remaining chance of  
putting an end to a system, the per­  
severance in which i not more in­  
jurious to his mjcsy&#x27;s dominioi  
than to nations not parties to the  
war between Great Bri ain 8c France.  
Tho principle ilpon which his ma­  
jesty finds himself compelled to pro­  
ceed, would justify a complete and  
unqualified retaliation on his part of  
the system announced and acted up­  
on by France, in tespect to his ma­  
jesty&#x27;s dominions : and his &quot;majesty  
might, thtreforc, hare declared in  
a state cf rigorous and unmitigated  
blockade, all the coasts and colonies  
of Fiance and her allies. Such a  
measure, the maritime power of G.  
Britain would have enabled his ma­  
jesty to enforce : nor would those  
nation., which have acquiesced, with­  
out, effectual remc strance, in the  
French derrfce of blockade, have de­  
rived any right from the perfect exe­  
cution of a corresponding determina­  
tion on ihe pn of his Majesty, to  
complain of his Majesty&#x27; enforcing  
that measure, tthich the enemy has  
executed imperfectly, only from the  
want of the means of execution.  
His Majesty, however, actuated by  
the same sentiments of moderation by  
which liis Majesty&#x27;s conduct fias been  
uniformlygovernedjhasbeen desirous  
of alleriatidg, as tnuch as possible,  
the inconveniences necessarily bnt  
upon neutral nations by a state of  
thint so unfavorable to the commer­  
cial intercourse of the world; and  
has therefore anxiously considered  
what modifications it would br prac­  
ticable to apply to the principle up-  
on wnicn ne is compelled to act,  
whicfc would not, at the same time  
that they might afford relief from  
the pressure of that principle upon  
neutral or friendly nations, imped  
or enfeeble its rpcration upon the  
enciny. .  
In pursuance of this desire, the or­  
der in council, which, if it had ended  
with the sixth paragraph, would have  
been no.more than a strict and justi­  
fiable letaliation for the French de­  
cree of November, 1 806, proceeds, as  
you . will. cbscrrci sir, to provide ma­

of subsequently te-exnor mg it to any J  
part of Europe, under certain regu­  
lations. . . &#x27; ;  
The object of these refrulalions  
will 5e the establishment ofuch a  
protecting duty, as shall prevent the  
enem from obtaining the produce of  
his own colonies at, a cheaper rate  
than that of the colonies of Great­  
Britain. In this duty it is ; evident  
that Americans&#x27; no otherwise con­  
cerned than as being to make an ad  
vance to that amount for that which  
it is in heHown power amply to in­  
demnify cj?se( at the expence of  
-the foreign consumer. i ,  
Another most important relaxation  
of the principles upon which his Ma­  
jesty&#x27;s orders proceed, is ihat. which  
licences the importation of all flour  
and meal, and all grain, tobacco and  
other articles, the produce of the soil  
of America with the except iop of cot­  
tort, through the ports of his Majes­  
ty&#x27;s dominions, into those of his ene  
mles, with the payment of any duty  
on the transit. This is, I beg leave  
to observe, an instance in which his  
Majesty has deprived his measure of  
its most efficacious and hurtful opeN­  
ration against the enemy through mo­  
tives of consideration Tor the interests  
of America. , The reason why his  
Majesty could hot feel himself at li­  
berty, consistent with the execution  
of his purpose, In any tolerable de­  
gree, to allow this relaxation to ap­  
ply to cotton, is to be found in the  
g.-eat extent to which France has  
piished the manufacture of that arti­  
cle, and the consequent embarrass­  
ment upon her trade which a heavy  
impost upon cotton, as it passes  
ihrough G. Britain to France must  
necessarily produce.  
I cannot refrain from calling the  
attention cf the government of the  
United States to the contrast between  
the dirtcreht modes in which his  
Majesty&#x27;s orders at.d those of France  
are  
carried into execution. Br his  
iNIaj-sty&#x27;stnc utmost consideration is  
manifested for the interests of those  
nations whose commerce he is re­  
luctantly compelled to impede, and  
ample time allowed for their becom­  
ing acquainted with the new regula­  
tions arid conforming to them.  
Whereas France, without any pre­  
vious notice, and without any inter­  
val, applies her orders to trade al­  
ready entered upon in ignorance of  
any such orders, and suhjectsto con­  
demnation ships.whose voyages when  
commenced, were in strict conformi­  
ty to all the regulations at that time  
promulgated by France .  
Even wt&#x27;h these and other modi­  
fications, his Majesty is not unaware  
that a measure extorted from him by  
the injustice of the enemy, must ine­  
vitably produce inconveniences to  
the neutral parties who are affected  
by its operation.  
The right of bis Majesty to resort  
to retaliation, cannot Oe questioned.  
The suffering occasioned to neutral  
parties is incidental, and not of his  
Majesty&#x27;s seeking.  
In the exercise of this undoubted  
right his Majesty has studiously en  
deavoured to avoid aggravating un­  
necessarily the inconveniences suf­  
fered by the neutral. &#x27;And lam com­  
manded by his Majesty, especially,  
to represent to the government of  
the United States, the earnest desire  
of his Majesty, to see the commerce  
of the World restored once more to  
ihat freedom&#x27; which is necessary for  
its prosperity : and his leadiness to  
abandon the system which has Been  
forced upon him,&quot; whenever the ene­  
my shall retract the principles which  
have rendered it necessary ; but his  
Majesty entertains the conviction up­  
on which alone his present measures  
are founded, that it would be vain to  
hope for such a re&#x27;tractionj until the  
enemy himself sliall have been made  
to feel a portion ofthe evils which&#x27; Ke  
ha endeavoured toinflict ilpon others;  
I have the honor to be,4 with creat  
consideration and respect, -air, your  
. . . . - .  
most ooeutent humble servant

Washington, Feb. 23d, 1803. ;­  
Sir, -  
I have the honour to transmit to you  
the copies of certain orders of Council  
which his majesty has thought proper to  
issue in consequence of the hostile con- j  
duct of France towards the navigation j  
and commerce of Great*IJrrtnin and of I  
neutral states. .  
His majesty h is been induced hitherto I  
to forbear recurring to measures of |  
  
this nature, by the expectation that the *  
governments of the neutral states, who  
have b«en the objects of the French de­  
crees, would have been awakened to a  
just sense of what they owe to their in­  
terests and ovrn rights, and would have  
interposed with effect, either to prevent  
the execution of the French decrees or  
to procure their abrogation.  
But his majesty having been disap­  
pointed in this just expectation, and per- &#x27;  
ceiving that the neutral nations, so far  
from opposing any effectual resistance,  
have submitted to whatever regulations  
France may have prescribed for giving  
effect to her decrees, can no longer re­  
frain from having recourse to such  
measures as by retorting on the enemy  
the inconveniences and evils produced  
by his injustice and violence, may afford  
the only remaining chance of putting an  
end to a system, the perseverance in  
which is no more injurous to his majes­  
ty’s dominions than to nations not parties  
to the war between Great-Britain and  
France.  
  
1 he principle, upon which his majes­  
ty finds himself compelled to proceed,  
would justify a complete and unqualifi­  
ed retaliation on his part of the system,  
announced and acted upon by France,  
in respect to his majesty’s dominions :  
and his majesty might, therefore, have  
declared in a state of rigorous and un­  
mitigated blockade, all the coasts and  
colonies of France and her allies. Such  
a measure, the maritime power of G.  
Britain would have enabled his majesty  
to enforce : nor would those nations,  
which have acquiesced without effectu­  
al remonstrance, in the French decree  
of Blockade, have &#x27; derived any right  
from the perfect execution of a corres­  
ponding determination on the part of •  
his majesty, to complain of his majes­  
ty’s enforcing that measure, which the  
enemy has executed imperfectly, only  
from the want of the means of execution.  
His majesty, however, actuated by  
the same sentiments of moderation by  
which his majesty’s conduct has been  
uniformly governed, has been desirous  
of alleviating, as much as possible, the  
inconveniences necessar ly brought up­  
on neutral nations by a state of things  
so unfavourable to the commercial in­  
tercourse of the world ; and has there­  
fore anxiously considered what modi­  
fications it would be practicable to ap­  
ply to the principle upon which he is  
to compelled to art, which would not, at  
the same time that they might afford

relief from the pressure of that princi­  
ple upon neutral or iriendlv nations, im­  
pede or enieeblc its operation upon the  
enemy.  
in pursuance of this desire, the or­  
der in council, which, it it had ended  
with the sixth paragraph^ would have  
been no more than a strict and justifiable  
retaliation lor the French decree of No­  
vember 1800, proc/fds, as you will ob­  
serve, sir, to provide many material ex­  
ceptions, which are calculated to qualifv  
the operation of the order upon neutral  
nations in general, but which must be  
considered as most peculiarly favoura­  
ble to the particular interests of the U.  
States.  
It will not escape you, sir, that bv this  
nrdcr in council, thus modified and re­  
gulated, the direct intercourse oi the U.  
States with the colonies ol the enemv is  
unrestrained ; an indulgence which,  
when it is consult red to be (as it really  
is) i ot only a mitigation of that princi­  
ple ol just reprisal upon which the order  
itsell is framed, hut a de\ iation in fa­  
vour ol the United States, from that an­  
cient and established principle of mari­  
time law, by which the intercourse with  
  
the colonies of an enemy in time oi war  
is limited to the extent w hich that ene­  
my was accustomed in time of peace to  
prescribe ior it, and which,by reference  
to the conduct of France in a time of  
peace, would amount to a complete in­  
terdiction, cannot fail to afford to the  
American government a proof of the a­  
micable disposition of his majesty tow­  
ards the U. States.  
^ on will observe, sir, also that the  
transportation ol the colonial produce of  
the enemy from the U. S. to Europe, in­  
stead of being altogether prohibited  
(whicn would have been the natural re­  
taliation lor the rigorous and univ r;sal  
porhibiiion of British produce and manu­  
factures by I-rance) is lreelv permitt d  
to the ports ( f G. Brirain, with the  
power ot subsequently tv-exporting i*  
to any part of Europe, under certain r -  
g ulations.  
The object of these regulations will  
be the establisbm nt of stu !i a protec­  
ting duty, as shall prevent the enemy  
from obtaining tlu produce of his own  
colonies at a cheaper rate than that of  
the colonics ol (.r at-Britain. In this |  
duty it is evicl1 nt that America is no  
otherwise concerned than as being to  
maU an advance to that amount, lor  
v.hich it is in her own power amply to  
indemnify herself at the expense of the  
foreign consumer.  
  
Another most important relaxation  
of the principles upon which his majes­  
ty’s orders proceed, is that which licen­  
ses the importation of all flour and  
meal, and all grains, tobacco, and other  
articles, the produce of the soil of Ame­  
rica from the ports of his dominions  
into those of his enemies, without  
the payment of any duty on the tran­  
sit. I his is, I beg leave to observe, an  
instance in which his majesty has de­  
prived his measure of its most efficaci­  
ous and hurtful operation against the  
enemy,through motives of consideration  
for the interests of America. The rea­  
son why his majestv could not feel him­  
self at liberty consistent with what was  
necessary for the i xecution of his pur­  
pose, in any tolerable degree, to allow  
this relaxation to apply to cotton, is to  
he found in the great extent to which  
France has pushed the manufacture  
ol that article and the consequent em­  
barrassment upon her trade which a hea­  
vy impost upon cotton, as it passes  
through G. Britain to 1* ranee, must ne­  
cessarily produce.  
  
a t.wmui H inun irom catling tne nt­  
tcmion of the* govt rnment of the United  
States to the contrast between the dif­  
ferent modes in which his majesty’s or­  
ders, and these of France, are carried  
into execution. By his majesty’s the  
utmost consideration is manifested for  
the interests of those nations whose  
commerce he is reluctantly compelled  
to impede, and ample time allowed for  
their becoming acquainted with the new  
regulations and conforming to them.

notice, and \\ ithout any interval, applies  
her orders to trade already entered upon  
in ignorance of any such orders, and  
subjects to condemnation ships, whose  
voyages,when commenced,were- in strict  
conformity to all tlie* regulations at that  
time promulgated bv France.  
Fven with these* and other modifica­

The right of his majesty to is ‘-ort to  
retaliation cannot be questioned. The

incidental, and not of his majesty&#x27;s seek­

In the exercise of this undoubted  
right, his majesty lias studiously &lt; mica­

such a retraction, until the enemy shall
