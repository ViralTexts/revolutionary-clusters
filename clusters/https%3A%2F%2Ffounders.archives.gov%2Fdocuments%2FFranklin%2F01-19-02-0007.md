America. As there is something curious in our Interview in Ireland, I must give you an Account of it. I met with him accidentally at the Lord Lieutenant’s, who happened to invite us to dine, with a large Company, on the same Day. He was surprizingly civil, and urg’d my Fellow-traveller and me to call at his House in our intended Journey Northwards, where we might be sure of better Accommodations than the Inns could afford us. He press’d us so politely that it was not easy to refuse without apparent Rudeness, as we must pass through his Town of Hillsborough and by his Door; and as it might afford an Opportunity of saying something on American Affairs, I concluded to comply with his Invitation. His Lordship went home some time before we left Dublin; we call’d upon him, and were detain’d at his House four Days, during which time he entertain’d us with great Civility, and a particular Attention to me that appear’d the more extraordinary as I knew that but just before I left London he had express’d himself concerning me in very angry Terms, calling me a Republican, a factious mischievous Fellow, and the like. In our Conversations he first show’d himself a good Irishman, blaming England for its Narrowness towards that Country, in restraining its Commerce, discouraging its Woollen Manufactury, &amp;c. and when I apply’d his Observations to America, he said he had always been of Opinion that the People in every Part of the King’s Dominions had a natural Right to make the best Use they could of the Productions of their Country: and that America ought not to be restrain’d in manufacturing any thing she could manufacture to Advantage; that he suppos’d she at present found generally more Profit in Agriculture; but whenever she found that less profitable, or a particular Manufacture more so, he had no objection to her persuing it; and he censur’d Lord Chatham for asserting in his Speech that the Parliament had a Right or ought to restrain Manufactures in the Colonies; adding, that as he knew the English were apt to be jealous on that head, he avoided every thing that might inflame that Jealousy; and therefore tho’ the Commons had requested the Crown to order the Governors to send over, annually, Accounts of such Manufactures as were undertaken in the Colonies, yet as they had not ordered such Accounts to be annually laid before them, he should never produce them ’till they were call’d for. Then he gave me to understand that the Bounty on Silk raised in America was a Child of his, which he hoped would prove of great Advantage to that Country; and that he wish’d to know in what Manner a Bounty on Raising Wine there might be contrived so as to operate effectually for that purpose, desiring me to turn it in my Thoughts as he should be glad of my Opinion and Advice. Then he inform’d me that Newfoundland was grown too populous to be left any longer without a regular Government, but there were great Difficulties in the forming such a kind of Government as would be suitable to the particular Circumstances of that Country, which he wish’d me likewise to consider, and that I would favour him with my Sentiments. He seem’d attentive to every thing that might make my Stay in his House agreable to me, and put his eldest Son, Lord Kilwarling, into his Phaeton with me, to drive me a Round of Forty Miles, that I might see the Country, the Seats, Manufactures, &amp;c. covering me with his own Cloak lest I should take Cold: and, in short, seem’d in every thing extreamly solicitous to impress me, and the Colonies through me, with a good Opinion of him: All which I could not but wonder at, knowing that he likes neither them nor me; and I thought it inexplicable but on the Supposition that he apprehended an approaching Storm, and was desirous of lessening beforehand the Number of Enemies he had so imprudently created. But if he takes no Step towards withdrawing the Troops, repealing the Duties, restoring the Castle, or recalling the offensive Instructions, I shall think all the plausible Behaviour I have describ’d, and the Discourse related, concerning Manufactures, &amp;c. as meant only, by patting and stroaking the Horse to make him more patient while the Reins are drawn tighter and the Spurs set deeper into his Sides. Before I leave Ireland I must mention that being desirous of seeing the principal Patriots there, I staid till the Opening of their Parliament. I found them dispos’d to be Friends of America, in which Disposition I endeavoured to confirm them, with the Expectation that our growing Weight might in time be thrown into their Scale, and, by joining our Interest with theirs, might be obtained for them as well as for us, a more equitable Treatment from this Nation. There are many brave Spirits among them, the Gentry are a very sensible, polite and friendly People. Their Parliament makes a most respectable Figure, with a Number of very good Speakers in both Parties, and able Men of Business. And I ought not to omit acquainting you, that it being a standing Rule to admit Members of the English Parliament to sit (tho’ they do not vote) in the House among the Members, while others are only admitted into the Gallery, my Fellow-Traveller being an English Member was accordingly admitted as such, but I supposed I must have gone to the Gallery, when the Speaker having been spoken to by some of the Members, stood up and acquainted the House, that there was in Town an American Gentleman of Character, a Member or Delegate of some of the Parliaments of that Country, who was desirous of being present at the Debates of this House; that there was a standing Rule of the House for admitting Members of the English Parliament; that he did suppose the House would consider the American Assemblies as English Parliaments; but this being the first Instance he had chosen not to give any Order in it without receiving their Directions. On the Question, the whole House gave a loud unanimous Aye, when two Members came to me without the Bar, where I was standing,

that the Parliament had a right or ought to re

that, as he knew the English were ant to be icul

might inflame that jealousy; and therefore,  
though the Commons had requested the Crown  
to order the Governor to send over annually ac­  
counts of such manufactures as were under­  
taken in the colonies, yet, as they had not or  
dered such accounts to be annually laid before  
them, he should never produce them until they

of his and he hoped it would prove of great

to be left any longer without a regular goy­  
ernment, but there were great difficulties in  
the forming auch a kind of government as  
would be suitable to the particular circum­

short, he seemed extremely solicitous to im?

good opinion of him. All which I could not

pendence. In the letter referred to Franklin  
gives his American correspondent an account  
of his visit to Ireland, referring to the vari­  
ous features of English policy in that coun­  
try, and then he writes these words concern­  
ing his hope of political co-operation between  
America and Ireland:  
  
“Before leaving Ireland I must mention  
that, being desirous of seeing the principal  
patriots there, I stayed until the opening of  
their parliament I found them disposed to  
be friends of America, in which I endeavored  
to confirm them, with the expectation that  
our growing weight might in time be thrown  
into the scale, and by joining our interests  
with others, a more equitable treatment from  
this nation (England) might be obtained for  
them as well as for us. There are many brave  
spirits among them. ♦ * * Their parlia­  
ment makes a good, respectable figure, with  
a number of good speakers in both parties,  
and able men of business.”  
  
Tlie Sugar Tree of India.  
  
Every part of the tree, in fact, is of use. The  
timber, being hard and strong, close and even  
grained, is used for the wheels of carriages,  
railway sleepers, etc. The flowers when dried  
have somewhat the odor and appearance of  
sultana raisins. They are produced in enor­  
mous quantities in March and April after the  
old leaves have fallen and before the new  
leaves have appeared. The crop rarely fails.  
The fleshy flowers fall off and cover the  
ground beneath the trees, and are gathered  
eagerly by the natives every morning during  
the flowering season.

During the time of their severest struggles &#x27;  
the people of this country have always had i  
the moral support and encouragement of the ;  
Irish people. When, 1111771, Benjamin Frank­  
lin visited Dublin and came in contact wlih ,  
the leading patriots of the Irish Parliament, I

In 1775 Chntham asserted that Ireland on  
the colonial question was with America to a

a high value on Irish sympathy and so truly !  
understood its extent and influence that the :
