I have ventured, Sir in some former Letters to you, notwithstanding the Delicacy of tampering with the Confederation, to suggest to your Consideration, whether it may not he necessary for the States to reconsider this Proviso, and give to Congress unlimited Authority to enter into Treaties of Commerce with foreign Powers at least for a limited Term of Years.

I told his Lordship that those Proceedings were prefaced with “Whereas there is no Treaty of Commerce” and as I understood them they were not to be in force any longer than there should be no Treaty of Commerce. His Lordship concluded by Saying that the sooner Such a Treaty was made the better.— I had no doubt then and have been confirmed by others Since in the opinion that his Lordship did not come of his own Head.
