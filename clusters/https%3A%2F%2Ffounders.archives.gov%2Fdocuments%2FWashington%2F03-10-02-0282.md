 Event of Chagrine &amp; Surprize not apprehended, nor within the Compass of my reasoning. I know not upon what principle it was founded and I should suppose it still more difficult to reconcile, if the Garrison amounted to five thousand Men, in high Spirits—well supplied with provision and Ammunition and the Eastern Militia marching to their Succour, as you mention in your Letter of the 9th to the Council of Safety of New York. This Stroke is severe indeed and has distressed us much: But notwithstanding Things, at present, have a dark and gloomy Aspect, I hope a spirited Opposition will check the progress of General Burgoyne’s Arms, and that the Confidence derived from his Success will bring him into Measures, that will in their Consequences be favorable to us—We should never dispair. Our Situation before has been unpromising and has changed for the better, so, I trust, it will again—If new Difficulties arise, we must only put forth new Exertions and proportion our Efforts to the Exigency of the Times.
