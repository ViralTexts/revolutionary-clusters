Dear Sir  
Paris 24 January 1790  
  
I have received your kind Letter of the thirteenth of October and immediately set about procuring the Articles you there mention. Such of them at least as are best to be procured in this Capital. They are already on their Way to Havre and you will find here enclosed the Account of the Cost (including the Packages) ⟨L⟩ 2384. The Transportation to Havre will cost 46 The Charges there and the Freight I know not. For the Cost at the present Exchange of 27½ I charge you £91 Sterling. You will perhaps exclaim that I have not complied with your Directions as to the Oeconomy, but you will be of a different Opinion when you see the Articles. I would have sent you a Number of pretty Trifles for very little prime Cost, but the Transportation and the freight would have been more and you must have had an annual Supply, and your Table would have been in the Style of a petite Maitresse of this City, which mo

tion. I think it of very great Importance to fix the Taste of our Country properly, and I think your Example will go very far in that Respect. It is therefore my Wish that every Thing about you should be substantially good and majestically plain; made to endure. Nothing is so extravagant in the Event as those Buildin

ness.  
Your Sentiments on the Revolution effecting here I beleive to be perfectly just because they perfectly accord with my own, and that is you know the only Standard which Heaven has given us by which to judge. The King is in Effect a Prisoner at Paris, and obeys entirely the national Assembly. This Assembly may be divided  
  
into three Parts. One called the Aristocrats, consists of the high Clergy, the Members of the Law (note these are not the Lawyers) and such of the Nobility as think they ought to form a seperate Order. Another which has no Name but which consists of all Sorts of People really friends to a good free Government. The third is composed of what are called here the Enragées That is the Madmen. These are the most numerous and—are of that Class which in America is known by the Name of petifogging Lawyers, together with a Host of Curates, and many of those Persons who in all Revolutions throng to the Standard of Change because they are not well. This last Party is in close Alliance with the Populace here, and derives from that Circumstance very great Authority. They have already unhinged every Thing, and according to Custom on such Occasions the Torrent rushes on irresistible untill it shall have wasted itself. The Aristocrats are without a Leader, and without any Plan or Councils as yet, but ready to throw themselves into the arms of any one who shall offer. The middle Party who mean well, have unfortunately acquired their Ideas of Government from Books and are admirable Fellows upon Paper; but as it happens somewhat unfortunately that the Men who live in the World are very different from those who dwell in the Heads of Philosophers it is not to be wondered at if the Systems taken out of Books are fit for Nothing but to be put into Books again. Marmontel is the only Man I have met with among their Literati who seems truly to understand the Subject. For the Rest, they discuss Nothing in their Assembly. One large half of the Time is spent in hollowing and bawling. The Manner of speaking to a Question is as follows. Such as intend to hold forth write their Names on a Tablet kept for that Purpose, and are heard in the order that their Names are written down, if the others will hear them; which very often they refuse to do but keep up a continual uproar till the orator leaves the Pulpit. Each Man permitted to speak delivers the Result of his Lucubrations, so that the opposing Parties fire off their Cartridges, and it is a Million to one if their missile Arguments happen to meet. As to the Arguments themselves you will observe that it is an usual Compliment of the Assembly to order them printed, therefore there is as much Attention paid (at least) to make them sound well and look well as to convey Instruction or produce Conviction. But there is another Ceremony  
  
which the Arguments go through and which does not fail to affect the form at least, and perhaps the Substance. They are read before Hand in a small Society of young Men and Women, and generally the fair friend of the Speaker is one, or else the fair whom he means to make his friend, and the Society very politely give their Approbation unless the Lady who gives the Tone to that Circle chances to reprehend Something; which is of Course altered if not amended. Do not suppose that I am playing the Traveller. I have assisted at some of these Readings and will now give you an anecdote from one of them. It was at Madam de Stahls the daughter of Mr Necker. She is a Woman of wonderful Wit and above vulgar Prejudices of every Kind. Her House is a Kind of Temple of Apollo where the Men of Wit and fashion are collected twice a Week at Supper and once at Dinner, and sometimes more frequently. The Count de Clermont Tonnerre (one of their greatest orators) read to us a very pathetic oration; and the Object was to shew that as Penalties are the legal Compensation for Injuries and Crimes, the Man who is hanged having by that Event paid his Debt to the Society ought not to be held in dishonor, and in like manner he who has been condemned for seven Years to be flogged in the Gallies should when he had served out his apprenticeship be received again into good Company as if Nothing had happened. You smile; but observe that the Extreme to which the Matter was carried the other Way, dishonoring thousands for the Guilt of one, has so shocked the public Sentiment as to render this Extreme fashionable. The Oration was very fine, very sentimental, very pathetic, and the Style harmonious. Shouts of Applause and full approbation. When this was pretty well over, I told him that his Speech was extremely eloquent, but that his Principles were not very solid. Universal Surprize. A very few Remarks changed the Face of Things. The Position was universally condemned, and he left the Room. I need not add that as yet it has never been delivered in the Assembly—And yet it was of the Kind which produces a Decree by Acclamation; for Sometimes an orator gets up in the midst of another Deliberation, makes a fine Discourse and closes with a good snug Resolution, which is carried with a huzza. Thus in Considering a Plan for a national Bank proposed by Mr Necker, one of them took it into his Head to move that every Member should give his Silver Buckles,  
  
which was agreed to at once and the honorable Mover laid his upon the Table, after which the Business went on again. It is very difficult to guess whereabouts the Flock will settle When it flys so wild but as far as it is possible to guess at present, this (late) Kingdom will be cast into a Congeries of little Democracies laid out not according to Rivers Mountains &amp;ca but with the Square and Compass according to Latitude and Longitude; and as the Provinces had anciently different Laws (called Coutumes) and as the clippings and pairings of several different Provinces must fall together within some of the new Divisions I think such fermenting Matter must give them a Kind of political Cholic. Their Assemblee Nationale will be Som

d all the future is involved in the Mist of Conjecture. If the reigning Prince were not the small beer Character that he is, there can be but little Doubt that watching Events and making a tolerable Use of them he would regain his Authority. But what will you have from a Creature who situated as he is eats and drinks and sleeps well and laughs and is as merry a Grig as lives? The Idea that they will give him some Money which he can Œconomize, and that he will have no Trouble in governing, contents him entirely. Poor Man! he little thinks how unstable is his Situation. He is beloved, but it is not with the Sort of Love which a Monarch should inspire. It is that Kind of good natured Pity which one feels for a led Captain. There is besides no Possibility of serving him, for at the slightest shew of Opposition he gives up every Thing, and every Person.  
As to his Ministers The Count de Montmorin has more understanding than People in general imagine, and he means well, very well. But he means it feebly. He is a good easy Kind of Man, one who would make an excellent Peace Minister in quiet Times, but he wants the Vigor of Mind needful for great Occasions. The Count de la luzerne is an indolent pleasant Companion. A Man of Honor and as

to the Acceptance  
  
of him instead of the Marquis de Montesquieu who has a considerable Share of Talents and a great Deal of Method. Montesquieu is of Course at present the Enemy of Necker, having been his friend—As to Mr Necker, he is one of those People who has obtained a much greater Reputation than he had any Right to. His Enemies say that as a Banker he acquired his Fortune by Means which to say the least were indelicate, and they mention Instances. But in this Country every Thing is so much exagerated, that Nothing is more useful than a little Scepticism. Mr Necker in his public Administration has always been honest and disinterested, which proves well I think for his former private Conduct; or else it proves that he has more Vanity than Cupidity. Be that as it may, an unspotted Integrity as Minister, and serving at his own Expence in an Office which others seek for the Purpose of enriching themselves, have acquired him very deservedly much Confidence. Add to this that his Writings on finance teem with that Sort of Sensibility which makes the Fortune of Modern Romance, and which is exactly suited to this lively Nation, who love to read but hate to think. Hence his Reputation. He is a Man of Genius and his Wife is a Woman of Sense. But neither of them have Talents. Or rather the Talents of a great Minister. His Education as a Banker has taught him how to make tight Bargains, and put him upon Guard against Projets. But tho he understands Man as a covetous Creature, he does not understand Mankind. A Defect Which is remed⟨iless.⟩ He is utterly ignorant also of Politics, by which I mean Politics in the great Sense, that sublime Science which embraces for its Object the Happiness of Mankind. Consequently he neither knows what Constitution to form, nor how to obtain the Consent of others to such as he wishes. From the Moment of convocing the States General, he has been afloat upon the Wide Ocean of Incidents. But what is most extraordinary is that Mr Necker is a very poor financier.

moral. But the character of the Swiss minister was one which  
Mr, Morris was peculiarly qualified to fathom, from the mastery  
he had himself obtained of the science of finance. Space will  
not admit our quoting his examination of Necker’s various schemes,  
the hollowness of which he clearly demonstrates; but we may add  
a characteristic paragraph.  
  
As to M. Necker, he is one of those people, who has obtained a  
much greater reputation than he had any right to. His enemies say,  
that as a banker, he acquired his fortune by means, which, to say the  
least, were indelicate, and they mention instances. But in this country,  
every thing is so much exaggerated, that nothing is more useful than a  
little scepticism. M. Necker, in his public administration, has always  
been honest and disinterested, whick proves well, I think, for his for-  
mer private conduct, or else it proves that he has more vanity than  
cupidity. Be that as it may, an unspotted integrity as minister, and  
serving at his own expense in an office which others seek for the pur-  
pose of enriching themselves, have acquired for him very deservedly  
much confidence. Add to this, that his writings on finance teem with  
that sort of sensibility, which makes the fortune of modern romances, .  
and which is exactly suited to this lively nation, who love to read, but  
hate to think. Hence his reputation. He is a man of genius, and his  
wife is a woman of sense; but neither of them have talents, or rather  
the talents of a great minister. His education as a banker has taught  
him to make tight bargains, and put him upon his guard against pro-  
jects. But though he understands man as a covetous creature, he does  
not understand mankind; a defect which is remediless, He is utterly  
ignorant of politics, by which I mean politics in the great sense, or that  
sublime science, which embraces for its object the happiness of mankind.  
Consequently, he neither knows what constitution to form, nor how to  
obtain the consent of others to such as he wishes. From the moment  
of convening the States-General, he has been afloat upon the wide ocean  
of incidents.”—vol. ii. pp. 93, 94.

He gives a particularly interesting ac-  
count of one evening in Madame de  
Staél’s salon, where a party of choice  
spirits were assembled to listen to Cler-  
mont-Tonnerre, “one of the greatest or-  
ators of the day,” read an oration which  
he intended to deliver in the national as-  
sembly. “It was a very pathetic oration,”  
he says; the object of which was to show  
that penalties are the legal compensa-  
tion for injuries and crimes. The man  
who is hanged, having by that event  
paid his debt to society, ought not to  
be held in dishonor; and, in like  
manner, he who has been condemned  
for seven years to be flogged in the gal-  
leys should, when he had served out his  
apprenticeship, be received into good  
company as if nothing had happened.”  
  
This seems a strange doctrine ; but  
was really a strong reaction against the  
extreme to which the matter had been  
carried the other way. “ Dishonoring  
thousands for the guilt of one has so  
shocked the public that this extreme  
has become fashionable.” ‘The oration  
was very fine,” Mr. Morris says ; “ very  
sentimental, very pathetic, and the style  
harmonious. Shouts of applause and  
full approbation greeted it.”  
  
« Extremely eloquent,” he told Mon-  
sieur de Tonnerre, he found his speech ;  
but made one or two observations on  
the reasoning, telling him candidly that  
“his principles were not very sound.”  
This opinion created universal surprise,  
and a few more remarks from Mr. Mor-  
ris “changed the face of things, and  
brought the company to an opinion so  
adverse to the reader that his position  
was universally condemned, and, appar

“ The King is in effect a prisoner at Paris, and  
obeys entirely the National Assembly. This  
Assembly may be divided into three parts. One,  
called the aristocrats, consists of the high clergy,  
the members of the law (not lawyers), and such  
of the nobility as think they ought to form a  
separate order; another, which has no name,  
but which consists of all sorts of people, really  
friends to a free government. The third is com-  
posed of what are called here the enragés, that  
is, the madmen. These are the most numerous,  
and are of that class which in America is known  
by the name of pettifogging lawyers, together  
with a host of curates, and many of those who,  
in all revolutions, throng to the standard of  
change because they are not well. This party,  
in close alliance with the populace, derives from  
that circumstance very great authority. They  
have already unhinged everything...... If the  
reigning Prince were not the small-beer cha-

watching events and making tolerable use of

year. “ Your sentiments on the Revolution effecting here  
I believe to be perfectly just,” wrote Morris, “ because they  
perfectly accord with my own, and that is, you know, the  
only standard which Heaven has given us by which to  
judge. The King is in effect a prisoner at Paris, and obeys  
entirely the National Assembly. This Assembly may be  
divided into three parts. One, called the aristocrats, con-  
sists of the high clergy, the members of the law (not law-  
yers), and such of the nobility as think they ought to form  
a separate order; another, which has no name, but which  
consists of all sorts of people, really friends to a free gov-  
ernment. The third is composed of what are called here  
the enragés, that is, the madmen. These are the most  
numerous, and are of that class which in America is known  
by the name of pettifogging lawyers, together with a host  
of curates, and many of those who, in all revolutions,  
throng to the standard of change because they are not well.  
This party, in close alliance with the populace, derives from  
that circumstance very great authority. They have already  
unhinged everything. . . . The torrent rushes on irresisti-  
ble until it shall have wasted itself.  
  
“The aristocrats are without a leader, and without any  
plan or counsels as yet, but ready to throw themselves into  
the arms of any one who shall offer. The middle party,  
who mean well, have unfortunately acquired their ideas of  
government from books, and are admirable fellows upon  
paper; but as it happens, somewhat unfortunately, that the  
men who live in the world are very different from those  
who dwell in the heads of philosophers, it is not to be

elaborate. “They discuss nothing in the Assembly,” says  
Morris. “One large half of the time is spent in hollowing  
and bawling—their manner of speaking. Those who in-  
tend to speak write their names on a tablet and are heard  
in the order that their names are written down, if the others  
will hear them, which they often refuse to do, keeping up  
a continual uproar till the orator leaves the pulpit. Each  
man permitted to speak delivers the result of his lucubra-  
tions, so that the opposing parties fire off their cartridges,  
and it is a million to one if their missile arguments happen  
to meet. The arguments are usually printed; therefore  
there is as much attention paid to making them sound and  
look well, as to convey instruction or produce conviction.  
But there is another ceremony which the arguments go  
through, and which does not fail to affect the form, at least,  
and perhaps the substance. They are read beforehand in  
a small society of young men and women, and generally  
the fair friend of the speaker is one, or else the fair whom  
he means to make his friend, and the society very politely  
give their approbation, unless the lady who gives the tone  
to that circle chances to reprehend something, which is,  
of course, altered if not amended. Do not suppose I am  
playing the traveller. I have assisted at some of these read-  
ings, and will give you an anecdote from one of them.  
I was at Madame de Staél’s, the daughter of M. Necker.  
She is a woman of wonderful wit, and above vulgar preju-  
dices of every kind. Her house is a kind of Temple of  
Apollo, where the men of wit and fashion are collected  
twice a week at supper, and once at dinner, and some-  
times more frequently. The Comte de Clermont-Tonnerre  
(one of their greatest orators) read to us a very pathetic  
oration, and the object was to show that, as penalties are  
the legal compensation for injuries and crimes, the man  
who is hanged, having by that event paid his debt to

society, ought not to be held in dishonor; and in like man-  
ner, he who has been condemned for seven years to be  
flogged in the galleys should, when he has served out his  
apprenticeship, be received again into good company as  
if nothing had happened. You smile; but observe that the  
extreme to which the matter was carried the other way,  
dishonoring thousands for the guilt of one, has so shocked  
the public sentiment as to render this extreme fashionable.  
The oration was very fine, very sentimental, very pathetic,  
and the style harmonious. Shouts of applause and full  
approbation. When this was pretty well over, I told him  
that his speech was extremely eloquent but that his prin-  
ciples were not very solid. Universal surprise. A few  
remarks changed the face of things. The position was  
universally condemned, and he left the room. I need not  
add that as yet it has never been delivered in the Assembly,  
and yet it was of the kind which produces a decree by ac-  
clamation; for sometimes an orator gets up in the midst of  
another deliberation, makes a fine discourse, and closes  
with a good snug resolution, which is carried with a huzza.  
Thus in considering a plan for a national bank proposed by  
M. Necker, one of them took it into his head to move that  
every member should give his silver buckles, which was  
agreed to at once, and the honorable member laid his upon  
the table, after which the business went on again. It is  
difficult to guess whereabouts the flock will settle when  
it flies so wild. . . .”*
