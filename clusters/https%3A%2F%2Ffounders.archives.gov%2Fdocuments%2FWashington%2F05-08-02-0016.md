receive at the rate of twenty-five pounds per acre, to be paid

where the public arrangements as to streets, lots, etc., will  
admit of it, each proprietor shall possess his buildings and  
other improvements and graveyards, paying to the public only  
one half the present estimated value of the lands, on which the  
same shall be, or twelve pounds ten shillings per acre. But in  
cases where the arrangements of the streets, lots and squares  
will not admit of this, and it shall become necessary to remove  
such buildings, improvements, etc., the proprietors of the same  
shall be paid the reasonable value thereof by the public.

of the parties to this agreement may hold in the towns of
