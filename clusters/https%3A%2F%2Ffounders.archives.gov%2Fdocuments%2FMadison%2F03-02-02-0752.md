7 October 1810]  
By the President of the United States of America.  
A Proclamation.  
Whereas the Territory South of the Mississippi Territory and Eastward of the river Mississippi, and extending to the River Perdido, of which possession was not delivered to the United States in pursuance of the Treaty concluded at Paris on the 30th April 1803, has at all times, as is well known, been considered and claimed by them, as being within the Colony of Louisiana conveyed by the said Treaty, in the same extent that it had in the hands of Spain, and that it had when France originally possessed it.  
And whereas the acquiescence of the United States in the temporary continuance of the said Territory under the Spanish Authority was not the result of any distrust of their title, as has been particularly evinced by the general tenor of their laws, and by the distinction made in the application of those laws between that Territory and foreign Countries; but was occasioned by their conciliatory views, and by a confidence in the justice of their cause; and in the Success of candid discussion and amicable negotiation with a just and friendly power:  
And whereas a satisfactory adjustment, too long delayed, without the fault of the United States, has for some time been entirely suspended by events over which they had no controul, and whereas a crisis has at length arrived subversive of the order of things under the Spanish Authorities whereby a failure of the United States to take the said Territory into its possession may lead to events ultimately contravening the views of both parties, whilst in the mean time the tranquility and security of our adjoining territories are endangered, and new facilities given to violations of our Revenue and Commercial laws, and of those prohibiting the introduction of Slaves:  
Considering moreover that under these peculiar and imperative circumstances, a forbearance on the part of the United States to occupy the Territory in question, and thereby guard against the confusions and contingences which threaten it, might be construed into a dereliction of their title, or an insensibility to the importance of the stake: considering that in the hands of the United States it will not cease to be a subject of fair and friendly negotiation and adjustment: considering finally that the Acts of Congress tho’ contemplating a present possession by a foreign authority, have contemplated also an eventual possession of the said Territory by the United States, and are accordingly so framed as in that case to extend in their operation, to the same: Now be it known That I James Madison, President of the United States of America, in pursuance of these weighty and urgent considerations, have deemed it right and requisite, that possession should be taken of the said Territory, in the name and behalf of the United States. William C. C. Claiborne Governor of the Orleans Territory of which the said territory is to be taken as part, will accordingly proceed to execute the same; and to exercise over the said Territory the Authorities and functions legally appertaining to his office. And the good people inhabiting the same, are invited and enjoined to pay due respect to him in that character, to be obedient to the laws; to maintain order; to cherish harmony; and in every manner to conduct themselves as peaceable Citizens; under full assurance, that they will be protected in the enjoyment of their liberty, property and religion.  
In Testimony Whereof, I have caused the seal of the United States to be hereunto affixed and signed the same with my hand. Done at the City of Washington the Twenty seventh day of October A. D 1810, and in the thirty fifth year of the Independence of the said United States.

Whereas the Territory South and Eastward of

A PROCLAMATION.  
  
Whereas the territory south of the Missis-  
sippi territory, and eastward of the river  
Mississippi, and extending to the river Per-  
dido, of which possession was not delivered to  
the United States, in pursuance of the treaty  
concluded at Paris on the 30th of April, 1803,  
has at all times, as is well known, been con-  
sidered and claimed by them, as being with-  
  
  
  
suid treaty in the same extent that it had in  
the hands of Spain, and that it had when  
France originally possessed it.  
  
And whereas the acquiescence of the  
United States in the temporary continuance  
of the said territory under the Spanish au-  
thority, was not the result of any distrust of  
their title, as has been particularly evinced  
by the general tenor of their laws, and by  
the distinction made in the application of  
those laws between that territory and foreign  
countries; but was occasioned by their con-  
ciliatory views, and by a confidence in the  
justice of their cause; and in the success of  
candid discussion and amicable negociation  
with a just and friendly power.  
  
And whereas a satisfactory adjustment, too  
long delayed, without the fault of the United  
States, has for some time been entirely sus-  
pended by events over which they had no  
control; and whereas a crisis has at length  
arrived subversive of the order of things un-  
der the Spanish authorities, whereby a fail-  
ure of the United States to take the said ter-  
ritory into its possession may lead to events  
ultimately contravening the views of both

ity and security of our adjoining territories  
are endangered; and new facilities given to  
violations of our revenue and commercial  
laws, and of those prohibiting the introduc-  
tion of slaves:  
  
Considering moreover, that under these  
peculiar and imperative circumstances, a for-  
bearance on the part of the U. States to oc-  
cupy the territory in question, and thereby  
guard against the confusions and contingen-  
cies which threaten it, might be construed

eign authority, have contemplated also an  
eventual possession of the said territory by  
the United States, and are accordingly so  
framed as in that case to extend in their ope-  
ration to the same: Now be it known, that I,  
JAMES MADISON, president of the Unit-  
ed States of America, in pursuance of these  
weighty and urgent considerations, have  
deemed it right and requisite, that possession  
should be taken of the said territory, in the  
name and behalf of the U. States. William C.  
C. Claiborne, governor of the Orleans terri-  
tory, of which the said territory is to be tak-  
en as part, will accordingly proceed to exe-  
cute the same, and to exercise over the said  
territory the authorities and functions legal-  
  
LL  
  
people inhabiting the same, are invited and  
enjoined to pay due respect to him in that  
character; to be obedient to the laws; to  
maintain order; to cherish harmony; and in  
every manner to conduct themselves as  
peaceable citizens, under full assurance that  
they will be protected in the enjoyment of  
their liberty, property and religion.  
  
In testimony whereof, I have caused the  
seal of the United States to be here-  
unto affixed, and signed the same  
with my hand. Done at the city of  
  
(L. s.) Washington, the twenty seventh day  
of October, A. D. 1810, and in the  
thirty fifth year of the independence  
of the said United States.  
  
(Signed) JAMES MADISON.

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES  
OF AMERICA.  
A PRCCLANIATION,  
WHIREAS the Territory South of the  
Missisippi Territory, and E. of the River  
Missisipply, of which possession was not de­  
livered to the United States in pursuance of  
he treniy concluded at Paiis on the 30th of  
Aprily, 1803, has atall times, as ils well known,  
becn considered and claimed by them, as be­  
ing within the Colony of Louisiung, conveyed  
Ly the said treaty in the ssme extent that it  
bud in the hands of Spain, and that it bad  
when France originally possessed it : And  
whercas the acauiescence of the U, States in  
the temporary continuance of the sad Terri­  
thry wpder the Spanish authority was not the  
result of eny distrust of their tile, as has  
been particularly evincea by the general ten­  
or of their laws, and by the disunction meade  
in the applicaiion of these laws between that  
Territory and foreigh countries ; but wus oc­  
cavioned by their conciliatory views, and by a  
confidence in the justice of their cauvse, and  
in the success of candid discussion and ami­  
cable negociation with a just and f{ricndly  
power : Aud whereas a satisfuctory adjust­  
ment, too long deluyeds without the fauit of  
the United States, has for some time been  
entirely suspended by events over which they  
had no control 3 And whereas a crisis has at  
lenuth arrived, subversive of the order of  
things under the Spenish authorities, where­  
b, a futiure of the United States to take the  
said Terrrory into its possession mey lcad to  
evenis uwltimately contravening the views of  
both parties. whilst in the mean time the  
truncuility and security ol our adjoining Ter­  
riortes are epdangered, and new fucilities  
iven to violstions ef our revenue and com­  
mercial lawsy and ol those prolitbiiing the in­  
troduction of slaves : Consiuering, moreover,  
thot under these pecuiiar and imperative cire  
cumstances, a forbearance on ti.e part ol the  
United States to occupy the Tertitory in  
question, and thereby guard against the ton­  
fusions and comtingencies which threaten 1t  
might be construed ine a dereliction of their  
titie, or un wsensibility to the twportance of  
the stake : Considertng that in the hauds of  
the Umited States it will not ccase to be a  
subject of fuir and friendly negociation and  
ac justiment @ considering finally that the acts  
of Congress, though contemplating a present  
possession of a foreign autliority, have con­  
templated wlso an eventual possession of the  
said Territory of the United States, and are  
accordingly so framed as in that case to ex­  
tend in their operation to the same : Now be  
it known, that I, JAMES MADISON, Pre­  
sident of the United States of America, in  
pursuance of those weighty and urgent con­  
siderations, have deemed it right amd requi­  
.site, that possession should he taken of the  
said Territory, in the name and on behulf of  
the United States. Wm. C. Ciaiborne, Gov­  
ernour of the Ovleans Territory of which the  
suid Territery is to be taken as part, will ac­  
cordingly prcceed to execute the same ; and  
to exercise over the said Territory the au­  
thorities and funetions legally «ppertaining to  
his olice. And the good people inhubiting the  
same are invited and enjoined to pay due rese  
pect to bim in that character ; to be vbedient  
to the laws ; to maintain order ;to cherish  
harmony ;3 and in every manner to conduct  
themseives as peaceable citizens, under full  
assurance, that they will be protected in the  
enjoyment of their liberty, property and  
reitgion,  
IN testimony whereof, I have caused the  
seal of the United Stutes to be hereunto  
affixed und signed the same with my  
hand. Done at the City of Washington

which, possession was not delivered to tic Uni-  
ted Siutes, in pursuance of the treaty conciuded

Claimed by them, as being withia the colony of  
Louisiana, conveyed by the said treaty in the  
same extent thatit had in the hands o1 Spain,  
and that it had when France originally posses-  
sed it.  
And whereas, the acquiescence of the United  
Siates, in the temporary continuance of the said  
territory, uncer the Spanish authority, was not  
the result of any distrust of their title, as has been  
particuiarly evinced by the generaitenor of their

tion of those laws, between that territory and for-  
cign COUNLLICS ; but wus occasioned by their con-  
ciliatory views, and by a confidence in the justice  
ot theii CAUSE 5 and in the success of candid dis-  
cussion and amicable negotiation with a just and

And whereas, a satisfactory adjustment, too  
long delayed, without the fault of the United  
States, has for some time been entirely suspend-  
ed by events over which they had no controui ;  
and whereas, a crisis has at length arrived, sub-  
versive of ihe order of things under the Spanish  
authorities, whereby a failure of the United  
  
  
  
States to take the said territory into its posses- |  
  
sion, may lead to events ultimately contravening

che tranquility and security of our adjoining ter-

slaves.  
  
Considering moreover, that under these pe-  
culiar and imperative circumstances, a forbear-  
ance on the partof the United States, to occupy  
the territory in question, and thereby guard a-  
cuinst the confusions and contingencies which  
threaten it, might be construed into 2 dereliction  
of their tide, or an insensibility to the iniportance  
of the stake: considering that in the hands of the  
United States, it will not cease to be a subject of  
juir and friendly negotiation and adjustment:  
considering finally, that the acts of Congress,  
though contemplating a present possession by a  
foreign authority, have contemplatad also, an e-  
ventual possession of the suid territory by the U-  
nited States, and are accordingly so framed, as  
in that case to extend in their operation to the  
same: Now be it known, thatI, JAMES MAD-  
ISON, President of the United States of Ameri-  
ca, in pursuance of these weighty and urgent  
considerations, have deemed it right and requi-  
site, that possession should be taken of the said  
territory, In the name and behalf of the United  
States. William C. C. Claiborne, governor of  
the Orleans territory, of which the suid territory  
is tobe takenas part, will accordingly proceed  
to execute the same, and to exercise over the  
said territory, the authorities and functions, le-  
gally appertaining te his oflice. And the good  
people inhabiting the same, are invited and en-  
joined to pay due respect to him in that charac-  
ter; toh: obedient te the laws; tO Maintain or-  
ger; to cherish harmony; and in every manner  
.o conduct themselves as peaceable citizens, un-  
der full assurance, that they will be protected in  
the enjoyment of their liberty, property and re-  
ligioa.  
  
In TESTIMONY WHEREOF, I have caused  
the seal of the United States to be here-  
unto affixed, and signed the same with

A PROCLAMATION.  
  
WHEREAS, the territery south of the Mississippi territory, and  
eastward of the river Mississippi, and extending to the river Perdi-  
do, of which possession was not delivered to the United States in  
pursuance of the treaty concluded at Paris on the 30th of April, }  
1803, has at all times, as is well known, been considered and claimed :  
by them, as being within the colony of Louisiana conveyed by the Hf  
said treaty, in the same extent that it had in the hands of Spain, and  
that it had when France originally possessed it.  
  
And whereas, the acquiescence of the United States in the tem- &gt;  
porary continuance of the said territory under the Spanish authority, )  
was not the result of any distrust of their title, as has been particu- |  
larly evinced by the general tenor of their Jaws, and by the distinc- Hy  
tion made in the application of those laws between that territory  
and foreign countries; but was occasioned by their conciliatory  
views, and by a confidence in the justice of their cause, and in the |  
success of candid discussion and amicable negotiation with a just  
and friendly power.

And whereas, a satisfactory adjustment, too long delayed, without  
the fault of the United States, has for some time been entirely sus-  
pended by events over which they had no control; and whereas a  
crisis has at length arrived, subversive of the order of things under

dangered, and new facilities given to violations of our revenue and

Considering, moreover, that under these peculiar and imperative  
circumstances, a forbearance on the part of the United States to oc-  
cupy the territory in question, and thereby guard against the con-

templated also an eventual possession of the said territory by the  
  
United States, and are accordingly so framed as in that case to ex-  
  
tend in their operation to the same:
