ctober 1805. Has told JM in conversation of his just discontent with the commercial relations which the citizens of different states maintain with the rebels of every color who have momentarily withdrawn Saint-Domingue from the legal authority.  
The principles injured by such a commerce, or rather by such a system of brigandage, are so evident, generally acknowledged, and adopted, not only by all nations that have a colonial system to defend, by those who have none, and even by wise people of every political view, that a statesman, if he has not lost every idea of justice, humanity, and public law, can no more contest their wisdom than their existence. And certainly he, finding himself called by duty as well as inclination, in the bosom of a friendly people, and near the respectable chief of government, could not have expected that his first political relations would have for their object a complaint so serious, an infraction so manifest, of a most sacred law, well observed by every civilized nation.  
It was not enough for some U.S. citizens to convey munitions of every kind to the rebels of Saint-Domingue, to that race of African slaves the reproach and the refuse of nature; it was necessary to insure the success of this ignoble and criminal traffic by the use of force. The vessels destined to protect it are constructed, loaded, and armed in every port of the union, under the eyes of the American people, of the authorities, and of the federal government itself, and that government, which has taken for the basis of its political career the most severe equity and the most impartial neutrality, does not forbid it.  
Without doubt, notwithstanding the profound consideration for the American government with which he is filled, he might enlarge still further upon the reflections suggested by such an important and unexpected state of things. It would be equally as afflicting for him to dwell upon it and to state the results as it would be for the government to hear them.  
JM, who knows perfectly the justice of the principles and the legitimacy of the rights referred to, will be of opinion, that neither are susceptible of discussion because a principle universally assented to, a right generally established, is never discussed, or at least is discussed in vain. The only way open for the redress of these complaints is to put an end to the tolerance which produces them and which daily aggravates their consequences.  
Moreover, this note, founded upon facts no less evident than the principles which they infract, does not permit him to doubt that the U.S. government will take the most prompt and effectual prohibitory measures in order to put an end to its caus

Without doubt, and notwithstanding the profound

state, his just discontent with the commercial re­  
lations, which many citizens of di,latent states of  
the Union maintain with ihe rebels of every colour,  
who have momentarily withdrawn the Colony of  
St. Domingo-from the legal authority.  
The principles injuriously affected by such aconi­  
merce, or rather by such a system of robbery (bri­  
gandage) (ire so evident, so generally acknowledged,  
and adopted not only by all nations, who have a  
colonial system to defend, hut even by those wha  
have none ; ynd moreover even by every wise peo­

t every  
idci ol justice, nf humanity, and of puhln-k law,  
etui no more contest their wisdom, than then ex­  
istence. And certainly the undersigned, in finding  
himself r ailed by his duty, as well as by his inclina­  
tion, in toe bosom of a friendly people, and near  
the respectable chiel who ducts its government ;  
certainly the undersigned ought not to have ex pec t­  
ed that his first political relations would have for  
their, object, a complaint so serious, an infraction  
\ so manifest bylaw, the most sacrul, and the best  
observed by every nation under the dominion of ci­  
vilization.  
But it was not enungh for some citizens of the  
Uni led States, to convey munitions of every kind  
to the rebels of St. Domingo, to that race of Afri­  
can slaves, thecoproacb, andthe refuse of nitJie;  
5t w» moreover necessary to secure the surcess of  
tms i^ivolc tnd ciiminul trqjjk by the use of force.  
Fhe vessels destined tb protect it are constructed,  
loaded, armed, in the ports of the Union, under the  
•yes of the American people, of its particular au­  
thority, am1 &lt;jj the federal government itself % anil  
this government, which has taken far the bails Of&#x27; its  
political career, the mint scrupulous equity, end the  
nost irnp-.ii rial neutrality, docs not forbid it.  
Without doubt, and notwithstanding the profound  
consideration, with which the minister pleriip iten­  
tiary of the French empire is penetrated for the go­  
vernment of the Union ; he might enlarge still far­  
ther upon the reflections suggested hy such a state  
o! things, a circarnstance so important, so unex­  
pected. But it would he equally as aifli-ting for  
him to dwell upon it, to stale its consequences, as it  
would be for the government to hear them.  
4. The secretary ol sl.te, who perfectly knows the  
justice of the principles* and the l^ijuuvtcy nt the  
rights, referred to in this ?vote, will be of opinion,  
that m-ither are susceptible of discussion ; hecuust*  
a principle miiversully absented, a right generally  
established, is never discussed, »rat least is discus  
sed in vain. j fie only way open for the redr.s.s of  
these complaints, is to put an .-nd to the tolerance  
which produces them, and which daily aggravate  
these consequences.  
Moreover this note, founded upon facts not less  
evident than the principles which they mlrcct, does  
suit permit the undersigned to doubt that the go.  
vernmenl of the United Stairs will take the most  
prompt, as well as the most effectual prohibitory

Talleyrand, in a letter to General Armstrong, our minister at Paris,
