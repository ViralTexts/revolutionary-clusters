torial Note  
When JM yielded to the entreaties of Virginia Republicans to stand as a delegate to the Virginia General Assembly in the spring of 1799, it was for the immediate purpose of combating the influence of Patrick Henry, who, it was feared, if left unopposed, would succeed in overcoming Virginia’s “resistance to monarchical measures.” But Henry’s death in June 1799 removed the chief obstacle to Republican plans and left JM free to pursue a “vindication” of the Virginia Resolutions of 1798, a task that became more pressing as the critical replies of several state legislatures came to light. The rejoinders of Delaware, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New York, Connecticut, New Hampshire, and Vermont were unequivocally against the ideas expressed in the resolutions. The criticism shared by all of these states was that only the United States Supreme Court had the power to determine the constitutionality of

ut Virginia by order of the legislature, the lack of public comment seems to indicate that JM’s effort probably had little effect on the coming presidential election (Report of the Committee to Whom Was Committed the Proceedings of Sundry of the Other States [Richmond, 1800; EvansCharles Evans, ed., American Bibliography …

[7 January 1800]  
Whatever room might be found in the proceedings of some of the states, who have disapproved of the resolutions of the General Assembly of this commonwealth, passed on the 21st day of December, 1798, for painful remarks on the spirit and manner of those proceedings, it appears to the committee, most consistent with the duty, as well as dignity of the General Assembly, to hasten an oblivion of every circumstance, which might be construed into a diminution of mutual respect, confidence and affection, among the members of the union.  
The committee have deemed it a more useful task, to revise with a critical eye, the resolutions which have met with this disapprobation; to examine fully the several objections and arguments which have appeared against them; and to enquire, whether there be any errors of fact, of principle, or of reasoning, which the candour of the General Assembly ought to acknowledge and correct.  
The first of the resolutions is in the words following:  
Resolved, that the General Assembly of Virginia, doth unequivocally express a firm resolution to maintain and defend the Constitution of the United States, and the Constitution of this state, against every aggression either foreign or domestic, and that they will support the government of the United States in all measures warranted by the former.  
No unfavorable comment can have been made on the sentiments here expressed. To maintain and defend the Constitution of the United States, and of their own state, against every aggression both foreign and domestic, and to support the government of the United States in all measures warranted by their constitution, are duties, which the General Assembly ought always to feel, and to which on such an occasion, it was evidently proper to express their sincere and firm adherence.  
In their next resolution—The General Assembly most solemnly declares a warm attachment to the union of the states, to maintain which, it pledges all its powers; and that for this end, it is their duty to watch over and oppose every infraction of those principles, which constitute the only basis of that union, because a faithful observance of them, can alone secure its existence and the public happiness.  
The observation just made is equally applicable to this solemn declaration, of warm attachment to the union, and this solemn pledge to maintain it: nor can any question arise among enlightened friends of the union, as to the duty of watching over and opposing every infraction of those principles which constitute its basis, and a faithful observance of which, can alone secure its existence, and the public happiness thereon depending.  
The third resolution is in the words following:  
That this Assembly doth explicitly and peremptorily declare, that it views the powers of the Federal Government, as resulting from the compact, to which the states are parties, as limited by the plain sense and intention of the instrument constituting that compact; as no farther valid than they are authorized by the grants enumerated in that compact; and that in case of a deliberate, palpable and dangerous exercise of other powers, not granted by the said compact, the states who are parties thereto, have the right, and are in duty bound, to interpose, for arresting the progress of the evil, and for maintaining within their respective limits, the authorities, rights and liberties appertaining to them.  
On this resolution, the committee have bestowed all the attention which its importance merits: They have scanned it not merely with a strict, but with a severe eye; and they feel confidence in pronouncing, that in its just and fair construction, it is unexceptionably true in its several positions, as well as constitutional and conclusive in its inferences.  
The resolution declares, first, that “it views the powers of the Federal Government, as resulting from the compact to which the states are parties,” in other words, that the federal powers are derived from the Constitution, and that the Constitution is a compact to which the states are parties.  
Clear as the position must seem, that the federal powers are derived from the Constitution, and from that alone, the committee are not unapprized of a late doctrine which opens another source of federal powers, not less extensive and important, than it is new and unexpected. The examination of this doctrine will be most conveniently connected with a review of a succeeding resolution. The committee satisfy themselves here with briefly remarking, that in all the co-temporary discussions and comments, which the Constitution underwent, it was constantly justified and recommended on the ground, that the powers not given to the government, were withheld from it; and that if any doubt could have existed on this subject, under the original text of the Constitution, it is removed as far as words could remove it, by the 12th amendment, now a part of the Constitution, which expressly declares, “that the powers not delegated to the United States, by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.”  
The other position involved in this branch of the resolution, namely, “that the states are parties to the Constitution or compact,” is in the judgment of the committee, equally free from objection. It is indeed true that the term “States,” is sometimes used in a vague sense, and sometimes in different senses, according to the subject to which it is applied. Thus it sometimes means the separate sections of territory occupied by the political societies within each; sometimes the particular governments, established by those societies; sometimes those societies as organized into those particular governments; and lastly, it means the people composing those political societies, in their highest sovereign capacity. Although it might be wished that the perfection of language admitted less diversity in the signification of the same words, yet little inconveniency is produced by it, where the true sense can be collected with certainty from the different applications. In the present instance whatever different constructions of the term “States,” in the resolution may have been entertained, all will at least concur in that last mentioned; because in that sense, the Constitution was submitted to the “States”: In that sense the “States” ratified it; and in that sense of the term “States,” they are consequently parties to the compact from which the powers of the Federal Government result.  
The next position is, that the General Assembly views the powers of the Federal Government, “as limited by the plain sense and intention of the instrument constituting that compact,” and “as no farther valid than they are authorized by the grants therein enumerated.” It does not seem possible that any just objection can lie against either of these clauses. The first amounts merely to a declaration that the compact ought to have the interpretation, plainly intended by the parties to it; the other, to a declaration, that it ought to have the execution and effect intended by them. If the powers granted, be valid, it is solely because they are granted; and if the granted powers are valid, because granted, all other powers not granted, must not be valid.  
The resolution having taken this view of the federal compact, proceeds to infer, “that in case of a deliberate, palpable, and dangerous exercise of other powers not granted by the said compact, the states who are parties thereto, have the right, and are in duty bound to interpose for arresting the progress of the evil, and for maintaining within their respective limits, the authorities, rights and liberties appertaining to them.”  
It appears to your committee to be a plain principle, founded in common sense, illustrated by common practice, and essential to the nature of compacts; that where resort can be had to no tribunal superior to the authority of the parties, the parties themselves must be the rightful judges in the last resort, whether the bargain made, has been pursued or violated. The constitution of the United States was formed by the sanction of the states, given by each in its sovereign capacity. It adds to the stability and dignity, as well as to the authority of the constitution, that it rests on this legitimate and solid foundation. The states then being the parties to the constitutional compact, and in their sovereign capacity, it follows of necessity, that there can be no tribunal above their authority, to decide in the last resort, whether the compact made by them be violated; and consequently that as the parties to it, they must themselves decide in the last resort, such questions as may be of sufficient magnitude to require their interposition.  
It does not follow, however, that because the states as sovereign parties to their constitutional compact, must ultimately decide whether it has been violated, that such a decision ought to be interposed either in a hasty manner, or on doubtful and inferior occasions. Even in the case of ordinary conventions between different nations, where, by the strict rule of interpretation, a breach of a part may be deemed a breach of the whole; every part being deemed a condition of every other part, and of the whole, it is always laid down that the breach must be both wilful and material to justify an application of the rule. But in the case of an intimate and constitutional union, like that of the United States, it is evident that the interposition of the parties, in their sovereign capacity, can be called for by occasions only, deeply and essentially affecting the vital principles of their political system.  
The resolution has accordingly guarded against any misapprehension of its object, by expressly requiring for such an interposition “the case of a deliberate, palpable and dangerous breach of the constitution, by the exercise of powers not granted by it.” It must be a case, not of a light and transient nature, but of a nature dangerous to the great purposes for which the constitution was established. It must be a case moreover not obscure or doubtful in its construction, but plain and palpable. Lastly, it must be a case not resulting from a partial consideration, or hasty determination; but a case stampt with a final consideration and deliberate adherence. It is not necessary because the resolution does not require, that the question should be discussed, how far the exercise of any particular power, ungranted by the constitution, would justify the interposition of the parties to it. As cases might easily be stated, which none would contend, ought to fall within that description: Cases, on the other hand, might, with equal ease, be stated, so flagrant and so fatal as to unite every opinion in placing them within the description.  
But the resolution has done more than guard against misconstruction, by expressly referring to cases of a deliberate, palapable and dangerous nature. It specifies the object of the interposition which it contemplates, to be solely that of arresting the progress of the evil of usurpation, and of maintaining the authorities, rights and liberties appertaining to the states, as parties to the constitution.  
From this view of the resolution, it would seem inconceivable that it can incur any just disapprobation from those, who laying aside all momentary impressions, and recollecting the genuine source and object of the federal constitution, shall candidly and accurately interpret the meaning of the General Assembly. If the deliberate exercise, of dangerous powers, palpably withheld by the constitution, could not justify the parties to it, in interposing even so far as to arrest the progress of the evil, and thereby to preserve the constitution itself as well as to provide for the safety of the parties to it; there would be an end to all relief from usurped power, and a direct subversion of the rights specified or recognized under all the state constitutions, as well as a plain denial of the fundamental principle on which our independence itself was declared.  
But it is objected that the judicial authority is to be regarded as the sole expositor of the constitution, in the last resort; and it may be asked for what reason, the declaration by the General Assembly, supposing it to be theoretically true, could be required at the present day and in so solemn a manner.  
On this objection it might be observed first, that there may be instances of usurped power, which the forms of the constitution would never draw within the controul of the judicial department: secondly, that if the decision of the judiciary be raised above the authority of the sovereign parties to the constitution, the decisions of the other departments, not carried by the forms of the constitution before the judiciary, must be equally authoritative and final with the decisions of that department. But the proper answer to the objection is, that the resolution of the General Assembly relates to those great and extraordinary cases, in which all the forms of the constitution may prove ineffectual against infractions dangerous to the essential rights of the parties to it. The resolution supposes that dangerous powers not delegated, may not only be usurped and executed by the other departments, but that the Judicial Department also may exercise or sanction dangerous powers beyond the grant of the constitution; and consequently that the ultimate right of the parties to the constitution, to judge whether the compact has been dangerously violated, must extend to violations by one delegated authority, as well as by another; by the judiciary, as well as by the executive, or the legislature.  
However true therefore it may be that the Judicial Department, is, in all questions submitted to it by the forms of the constitution, to decide in the last resort, this resort must necessarily be deemed the last in relation to the authorities of the other departments of the government; not in relation to the rights of the parties to the constitutional compact, from which the judicial as well as the other departments hold their delegated trusts. On any other hypothesis, the delegation of judicial power, would annul the authority delegating it; and the concurrence of this department with the others in usurped powers, might subvert forever, and beyond the possible reach of any rightful remedy, the very constitution, which all were instituted to preserve.  
The truth declared in the resolution being established, the expediency of making the declaration at the present day, may safely be left to the temperate consideration and candid judgment of the American public. It will be remembered that a frequent recurrence to fundamental principles is solemnly enjoined by most of the state constitutions, and particularly by our own, as a necessary safeguard against the danger of degeneracy to which republics are liable, as well as other governments, though in a less degree than others. And a fair comparison of the political doctrines not unfrequent at the present day, with those which characterized the epoch of our revolution, and which form the basis of our republican constitutions, will best determine whether the declaratory recurrence here made to those principles ought to be viewed as unseasonable and improper, or as a vigilant discharge of an important duty. The authority of constitutions over governments, and of the sovereignty of the people over constitutions, are truths which are at all times necessary to be kept in mind; and at no time perhaps more necessary than at the present.  
The fourth resolution stands as follows:—  
That the General Assembly doth also express its deep regret, that a spirit has in sundry instances, been manifested by the Federal Government, to enlarge its powers by forced constructions of the Constitutional charter which defines them; and that indications have appeared of a design to expound certain general phrases, (which, having been copied from the very limited grant of powers in the former articles of confederation were the less liable to be misconstrued) so as to destroy the meaning and effect, of the particular enumeration which necessarily explains, and limits the general phrases; and so as to consolidate the states by degrees, into one sovereignty, the obvious tendency and inevitable result of which would be, to transform the present Republican system of the United States, into an absolute, or at best a mixed monarchy.  
The first question here to be considered is, whether a spirit has in sundry instances been manifested by the Federal Government to enlarge its powers by forced constructions of the Constitutional charter.  
The General Assembly having declared their opinion merely by regreting in general terms that forced constructions for enlarging the federal powers have taken place, it does not appear to the committee necessary to go into a specification of every instance to which the resolution may allude. The alien and Sedition acts being particularly named in a succeeding resolution are of course to be understood as included in the allusion. Omitting others which have less occupied public attention, or been less extensively regarded as unconstitutional, the resolution may be presumed to refer particularly to the bank law, which from the circumstances of its passage as well as the latitude of construction on which it is founded, strikes the attention with singular force; and the carriage tax, distinguished also by circumstances in its history having a similar tendency. Those instances alone, if resulting from forced construction and calculated to enlarge the powers of the Federal government, as the committee cannot but conceive to be the case, sufficiently warrant this part of the resolution. The committee have not thought it incumbent on them to extend their attention to laws which have been objected to, rather as varying the Constitutional distribution of powers in the Federal government, than as an absolute enlargement of them; because instances of this sort however important in their principles and tendencies, do not appear to fall strictly within the text under review.  
The other questions presenting themselves, are—1. Whether indications have appeared of a design to expound certain general phrases copied from the “articles of confederation,” so as to destroy the effect of the particular enumeration explaining and limiting their meaning. 2. Whether this exposition would by degrees consolidate the states into one sovereignty. 3. Whether the tendency and result of this consolidation would be to transform the Republican system of the United States into a monarchy.  
1. The general phrases here meant must be those “of providing for the common defence and general welfare.”  
In the “articles of confederation” the phrases are used as follows, in article VIII. “All charges of war, and all other expences that shall be incurred for the common defence and general welfare, and allowed by the United States in Congress assembled, shall be defrayed out of a common treasury, which shall be supplied by the several states, in proportion to the value of all land within each state, granted to or surveyed for any person, as such land and the buildings and improvements thereon shall be estimated, according to such mode as the United States in Congress assembled, shall from time to time direct and appoint.”  
In the existing constitution, they make the following part of section 8. “The Congress shall have power, to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises to pay the debts, and provide for the common defence and general welfare of the United States.”  
This similarity in the use of these phrases in the two great federal charters, might well be considered, as rendering their meaning less liable to be misconstrued in the latter; because it will scarcely be said that in the former they were ever understood to be either a general grant of power, or to authorize the requisition or application of money by the old Congress to the common defence and general welfare, except in the cases afterwards enumerated which explained and limited their meaning; and if such was the limited meaning attached to these phrases in the very instrument revised and remodelled by the present constitution, it can never be supposed that when copied into this constitution, a different meaning ought to be attached to them.  
That notwithstanding this remarkable security against misconstruction, a design has been indicated to expound these phrases in the Constitution so as to destroy the effect of the particular enumeration of powers by which it explains and limits them, must have fallen under the observation of those who have attended to the course of public transactions. Not to multiply proofs on this subject, it will suffice to refer to the debates of the Federal Legislature in which arguments have on different occasions been drawn, with apparent effect from these phrases in their indefinite meaning.  
To these indications might be added without looking farther, the official report on manufactures by the late Secretary of the Treasury, made on the 5th of December, 1791; and the report of a committee of Congress in January 1797, on the promotion of agriculture. In the first of these it is expressly contended to belong “to the discretion of the National legislature to pronounce upon the objects which concern the general welfare, and for which under that description, an appropriation of money is requisite and proper. And there seems to be no room for a doubt that whatever concerns the general interests of learning, of agriculture, of manufactures, and of commerce, are within the sphere of the national councils, as far as regards an application of money.” The latter report assumes the same latitude of power in the national councils and applies it to the encouragement of agriculture, by means of a society to be established at the seat of government. Although neither of these reports may have received the sanction of a law carrying it into effect; yet, on the other hand, the extraordinary doctrine contained in both, has passed without the slightest positive mark of disapprobation from the authority to which it was addressed.  
Now whether the phrases in question be construed to authorise every measure relating to the common defence and general welfare, as contended by some; or every measure only in which there might be an application of money, as suggested by the caution of others, the effect must substantially be the same, in destroying the import and force of the particular enumeration of powers, which follow these general phrases in the Constitution. For it is evident that there is not a single power whatever, which may not have some reference to the common defence, or the general welfare; nor a power of any magnitude which in its exercise does not involve or admit an application of money. The government therefore which possesses power in either one or other of these extents, is a government without the limitations formed by a particular enumeration of powers; and consequently the meaning and effect of this particular enumeration, is destroyed by the exposition given to these general phrases.  
This conclusion will not be affected by an attempt to qualify the power over the “general welfare,” by referring it to cases where the general welfare is beyond the reach of separate provisions by the individual states; and leaving to these their jurisdictions in cases, to which their separate provisions may be competent. For as the authority of the individual states must in all cases be incompetent to general regulations operating through the whole, the authority of the United States would be extended to every object relating to the general welfare, which might by any possibility be provided for by the general authority. This qualifying construction therefore would have little, if any tendency, to circumscribe the power claimed under the latitude of the terms “general welfare.”  
The true and fair construction of this expression, both in the original and existing federal compacts appears to the committee too obvious to be mistaken. In both, the Congress is authorized to provide money for the common defence and general welfare. In both, is subjoined to this authority, an enumeration of the cases, to which their powers shall extend. Money cannot be applied to the general welfare, otherwise than by an application of it to some particular measure conducive to the general welfare. Whenever therefore, money has been raised by the general authority, and is to be applied to a particular measure, a question arises, whether the particular measure be within the enumerated authorities vested in Congress. If it be, the money requisite for it may be applied to it; if it be not, no such application can be made. This fair and obvious interpretation coincides with, and is enforced by, the clause in the Constitution which declares that “no money shall be drawn from the treasury, but in consequence of appropriations by law.” An appropriation of money to the general welfare, would be deemed rather a mockery than an observance of this constitutional injunction.  
2. Whether the exposition of the general phrases here combated, would not, by degrees consolidate the states into one sovereignty, is a question concerning which, the committee can perceive little room for difference of opinion. To consolidate the States into one sovereignty, nothing more can be wanted, than to supercede their respective sovereignties in the cases reserved to them, by extending the sovereignty of the United States to all cases of the “general welfare,” that is to say, to all cases whatever.  
3. That the obvious tendency and inevitable result of a consolidation of the states into one sovereignty, would be, to transform the republican system of the United States into a monarchy, is a point which seems to have been sufficiently decided by the general sentiment of America. In almost every instance of discussion, relating to the consolidation in question, its certain tendency to pave the way to monarchy, seems not to have been contested. The prospect of such a consolidation has formed the only topic of controversy. It would be unnecessary therefore, for the committee to dwell long on the reasons which support the position of the General Assembly. It may not be improper however to remark two consequences evidently flowing from an extension of the federal powers to every subject falling within the idea of the “general welfare.”  
One consequence must be, to enlarge the sphere of discretion allotted to the executive magistrate. Even within the legislative limits properly defined by the constitution, the difficulty of accomodating legal regulations to a country so great in extent, and so various in its circumstances, has been much felt; and has led to occasional investments of power in the executive, which involve perhaps as large a portion of discretion, as can be deemed consistent with the nature of the executive trust. In proportion as the objects of legislative care might be multiplied, would the time allowed for each be diminished, and the difficulty of providing uniform and particular regulations for all, be increased. From these sources would necessarily ensue, a greater latitude to the agency of that department which is always in existence, and which could best mould regulations of a general nature, so as to suit them to the diversity of particular situations. And it is in this latitude, as a supplement to the deficiency of the laws, that the degree of executive prerogative materially consists.  
The other consequence would be, that of an excessive augmentation of the offices, honors, and emoluments depending on the executive will. Add to the present legitimate stock, all those of every description which a consolidation of the states would take from them, and turn over to the federal government, and the patronage of the executive would necessarily be as much swelled in this case, as its prerogative would be in the other.  
This disproportionate increase of prerogative and patronage must, evidently, either enable the chief magistrate of the union, by quiet means, to secure his re-election from time to time, and finally, to regulate the succession as he might please; or, by giving so transcendent an importance to the office, would render the elections to it so violent and corrupt, that the public voice itself might call for an hereditary, in place of an elective succession. Which ever of these events might follow, the transformation of the Republican system of the United States into a monarchy, anticipated by the General Assembly from a consolidation of the states into one sovereignty, would be equally accomplished; and whether it would be into a mixt or an absolute monarchy, might depend on too many contingencies to admit of any certain foresight.  
  
The resolution next in order, is contained in the following terms:  
That the General Assembly doth particularly protest against the palpable, and alarming infractions of the constitution, in the two late cases of the “Alien and Sedition acts,” passed at the last session of Congress; the first of which, exercises a power no where delegated to the federal government; and which by uniting legislative and judicial powers to those of executive, subverts the general principles of a free government, as well as the particular organization, and positive provisions of the federal constitution; and the other of which acts, exercises in like manner, a power not delegated by the constitution, but on the contrary, expressly and positively forbidden by one of the amendments thereto; a power, which more than any other, ought to produce universal alarm; because it is levelled against that right of freely examining public characters and measures, and of free communication among the people thereon, which has ever been justly deemed the only effectual guardian of every other right.  
The subject of this resolution having, it is presumed, more particularly led the General Assembly into the proceedings which they communicated to the other states, and being in itself of peculiar importance; it deserves the most critical and faithful investigation; for the length of which no other apology will be necessary.  
The subject divides itself into first, “The Alien Act,” secondly, “The Sedition Act.”  
Of the “Alien act,” it is affirmed by the resolution, 1st. That it exercises a power no where delegated to the federal government. 2d. That it unites legislative and judicial powers to those of the executive. 3d. That this union of power, subverts the general principles of free government. 4th. That it subverts the particular organization and positive provisions of the federal constitution.  
In order to clear the way for a correct view of the first position, several observations will be premised.  
In the first place; it is to be borne in mind, that it being a characteristic feature of the Federal constitution, as it was originally ratified, and an amendent thereto having precisely declared, “That the powers not delegated to the United States by the constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people”; it is incumbent in this, as in every other exercise of power by the federal government, to prove from the constitution, that it grants the particular power exercised.  
The next observation to be made, is, that much confusion and fallacy, have been thrown into the question, by blending the two cases of aliens, members of a hostile nation; and aliens, members of friendly nations. These two cases are so obviously, and so essentially distinct, that it occasions no little surprise that the distinction should have been disregarded: and the surprise is so much the greater, as it appears that the two cases are actually distinguished by two separate acts of Congress, passed at the same session, and comprised in the same publication; the one providing for the case of “alien enemies”; the other “concerning aliens” indiscriminately; and consequently extending to aliens of every nation in peace and amity with the United States. With respect to alien enemies, no doubt has been intimated as to the federal authority over them; the constitution having expressly delegated to Congress the power to declare war against any nation, and of course to treat it and all its members as enemies. With respect to aliens, who are not enemies, but members of nations in peace and amity with the United States, the power assumed by the act of Congress, is denied to be constitutional; and it is accordingly against this act, that the protest of the General Assembly is expressly and exclusively directed.  
A third observation is, that were it admitted as is contended, that the “act concerning aliens,” has for its object, not a penal, but a preventive justice; it would still remain to be proved that it comes within the constitutional power of the federal legislature, and if within its power, that the legislature has exercised it in a constitutional manner.  
In the administration of preventive justice, the following principles have been held sacred; that some probable ground of suspicion be exhibited before some judicial authority; that it be supported by oath or affirmation; that the party may avoid being thrown into confinement, by finding pledges or sureties for his legal conduct sufficient in the judgment of some judicial authority; that he may have the benefit of a writ of habeas corpus, and thus obtain his release, if wrongfully confined; and that he may at any time be discharged from his recognizance, or his confinement, and restored to his former liberty and rights, on the order of the proper judicial authority; if it shall see sufficient cause.  
All these principles of the only preventive justice known to American jurisprudence, are violated by the alien act. The ground of suspicion is to be judged of, not by any judicial authority, but by the executive magistrate alone; no oath or affirmation is required; if the suspicion be held reasonable by the President, he may order the suspected alien to depart the territory of the United States, without the opportunity of avoiding the sentence, by finding pledges for his future good conduct; as the President may limit the time of departure as he pleases, the benefit of the writ of habeas corpus, may be suspended with respect to the party, although the constitution ordains, that it shall not be suspended, unless when the public safety may require it in case of rebellion or invasion, neither of which existed at the passage of the act: And the party being, under the sentence of the President, either removed from the United States, or being punished by imprisonment, or disqualification ever to become a citizen on conviction of not obeying the order of removal, he cannot be discharged from the proceedings against him, and restored to the benefits of his former situation, although the highest judicial authority should see the most sufficient cause for it.  
But, in the last place, it can never be admitted, that the removal of aliens, authorised by the act, is to be considered, not as punishment for an offence; but as a measure of precaution and prevention. If the banishment of an alien from a country into which he has been invited, as the asylum most auspicious to his happiness; a country, where he may have formed the most tender of connections, where he may have vested his entire property, and acquired property of the real and permanent, as well as the moveable and temporary kind; where he enjoys under the laws, a greater share of the blessings of personal security and personal liberty, than he can elsewhere hope for, and where he may have nearly compleated his probationary title to citizenship; if moreover, in the execution of the sentence against him, he is to be exposed, not only to the ordinary dangers of the sea, but to the peculiar casualties incident to a crisis of war, and of unusual licentiousness on that element, and possibly to vindictive purposes which his emigration itself may have provoked; if a banishment of this sort be not a punishment, and among the severest of punishments, it will be difficult to imagine a doom to which the name can be applied. And if it be a punishment, it will remain to be enquired, whether it can be constitutionally inflicted, on mere suspicion, by the single will of the executive magistrate, on persons convicted of no personal offence against the laws of the land, nor involved in any offence against the law of nations, charged on the foreign state of which they are members.  
One argument offered in justification of this power exercised over aliens, is, that the admission of them into the country being of favor not of right, the favor is at all times revokable.  
To this argument it might be answered, that allowing the truth of the inference, it would be no proof of what is required. A question would still occur, whether the constitution had vested the discretionary power of admitting aliens in the federal government or in the state governments.  
But it can not be a true inference, that because the admission of an alien is a favor, the favor may be revoked at pleasure. A grant of land to an individual, may be of favor not of right; but the moment the grant is made, the favor becomes a right, and must be forfeited before it can be taken away. To pardon a malefactor may be a favor, but the pardon is not, on that account, the less irrevocable. To admit an alien to naturalization, is as much a favor, as to admit him to reside in the country; yet it cannot be pretended, that a person naturalized can be deprived of the benefit, any more than a native citizen can be disfranchised.  
Again it is said, that aliens not being parties to the constitution, the rights and privileges which it secures, cannot be at all claimed by them.  
To this reasoning also, it might be answered, that although aliens are not parties to the constitution, it does not follow that the constitution has vested in Congress an absolute power over them. The parties to the constitution may have granted, or retained, or modified the power over aliens, without regard to that particular consideration.  
But a more direct reply is, that it does not follow, because aliens are not parties to the constitution, as citizens are parties to it, that whilst they actually conform to it, they have no right to its protection. Aliens are not more parties to the laws, than they are parties to the constitution; yet it will not be disputed, that as they owe on one hand, a temporary obedience, they are entitled in return, to their protection and advantage.  
If aliens had no rights under the constitution, they might not only be banished, but even capitally punished, without a jury or the other incidents to a fair trial. But so far has a contrary principle been carried, in every part of the United States, that except on charges of treason, an alien has, besides all the common privileges, the special one of being tried by a jury, of which one half may be also aliens.  
It is said, further, that by the law and practice of nations, aliens may be removed at discretion, for offences against the law of nations; that Congress are authorised to define and punish such offences; and that to be dangerous to the peace of society is, in aliens, one of those offences.  
The distinction between alien enemies and alien friends, is a clear and conclusive answer to this argument. Alien enemies are under the law of nations, and liable to be punished for offences against it. Alien friends, except in the single case of public ministers, are under the municipal law, and must be tried and punished according to that law only.  
This argument also, by referring the alien act, to the power of Congress to define and punish offences against the law of nations, yields the point that the act is of a penal, not merely of a preventive operation. It must, in truth be so considered. And if it be a penal act, the punishment it inflicts, must be justified by some offence that deserves it.  
Offences for which aliens within the jurisdiction of a country, are punishable, are first, offences committed by the nation of which they make a part, and in whose offences they are involved: Secondly, offences committed by themselves alone, without any charge against the nation to which they belong. The first is the case of alien enemies; the second the case of alien friends. In the first case, the offending nation can no otherwise be punished than by war, one of the laws of which authorizes the expulsion of such of its members, as may be found within the country, against which the offence has been committed. In the second case, the offence being committed by the individual, not by his nation, and against the municipal law, not against the law of nations; the individual only, and not the nation is punishable; and the punishment must be conducted according to the municipal law, not according to the law of nations. Under this view of the subject, the act of Congress, for the removal of alien enemies, being conformable to the law of nations, is justified by the constitution: and the “act,” for the removal of alien friends, being repugnant to the constitutional principles of municipal law, is unjustifiable.  
Nor is the act of Congress, for the removal of alien friends, more agreeable to the general practice of nations, than it is within the purview of the law of nations. The general practice of nations, distinguishes between alien friends and alien enemies. The latter it has proceeded against, according to the law of nations, by expelling them as enemies. The former it has considered as under a local and temporary allegiance, and entitled to a correspondent protection. If contrary instances are to be found in barbarous countries, under undefined prerogatives, or amid revolutionary dangers; they will not be deemed fit precedents for the government of the United States, even if not beyond its constitutional authority.  
It is said, that Congress may grant letters of marque and reprisal; that reprisals may be made on persons, as well as property; and that the removal of aliens may be considered as the exercise in an inferior degree, of the general power of reprisal on persons.  
Without entering minutely into a question that does not seem to require it; it may be remarked, that reprisal is a seizure of foreign persons or property, with a view to obtain that justice for injuries done by one state or its members, to another state or its members; for which a refusal of the aggressor requires such a resort to force under the law of nations. It must be considered as an abuse of words to call the removal of persons from a country, a seizure or reprisal on them; nor is the distinction to be overlooked between reprisals on persons within the country and under the faith of its laws, and on persons out of the country. But, laying aside these considerations; it is evidently impossible to bring the alien act within the power of granting reprisals; since it does not alledge or imply any injury received from any particular nation, for which this proceeding against its members was intended as a reparation. The proceeding is authorized against aliens of every nation; of nations charged neither with any similar proceeding against American citizens, nor with any injuries for which justice might be sought, in the mode prescribed by the act. Were it true therefore, that good causes existed for reprisals against one or more foreign nations, and that neither the persons nor property of its members under the faith of our laws, could plead an exemption; the operation of the act ought to have been limited to the aliens among us, belonging to such nations. To license reprisals against all nations, for aggressions charged on one only, would be a measure as contrary to every principle of justice and public law, as to a wise policy, and the universal practice of nations.  
It is said, that the right of removing aliens is an incident to the power of war, vested in Congress by the constitution.  
This is a former argument in a new shape only; and is answered by repeating, that the removal of alien enemies is an incident to the power of war; that the removal of alien friends, is not an incident to the power of war.  
It is said, that Congress, are, by the constitution, to protect each state against invasion; and that the means of preventing invasion, are included in the power of protection against it.  
The power of war in general, having been before granted by the constitution; this clause must either be a mere specification for greater caution and certainty, of which there are other examples in the instrument; or be the injunction of a duty, superadded to a grant of the power. Under either explanation, it cannot enlarge the powers of Congress on the subject. The power and the duty to protect each state against an invading enemy, would be the same under the general power, if this regard to greater caution had been omitted.  
Invasion is an operation of war. To protect against invasion is an exercise of the power of war. A power therefore not incident to war, cannot be incident to a particular modification of war. And as the removal of alien friends has appeared to be no incident to a general state of war, it cannot be incident to a partial state, or a particular modification of war.  
Nor can it ever be granted, that a power to act on a case when it actually occurs, includes a power over all the means that may tend to prevent the occurrence of the case. Such a latitude of construction would render unavailing, every practicable definition of particular and limited powers. Under the idea of preventing war in general, as well as invasion in particular, not only an indiscriminate removal of all aliens, might be enforced; but a thousand other things still more remote from the operations and precautions appurtenant to war, might take place. A bigoted or tyrannical nation might threaten us with war, unless certain religious or political regulations were adopted by us; yet it never could be inferred, if the regulations which would prevent war, were such as Congress had otherwise no power to make, that the power to make them would grow out of the purpose they were to answer. Congress have power to suppress insurrections, yet it would not be allowed to follow, that they might employ all the means tending to prevent them; of which a system of moral instruction for the ignorant, and of provident support for the poor, might be regarded as among the most efficacious.  
One argument for the power of the General Government to remove aliens would have been passed in silence, if it had appeared under any authority inferior to that of a report, made during the last session of Congress, to the House of Representatives by a committee, and approved by the house. The doctrine on which this argument is founded, is of so new and so extraordinary a character, and strikes so radically at the political system of America, that it is proper to state it in the very words of the report.  
“The act (concerning aliens) is said to be unconstitutional, because to remove aliens, is a direct breach of the Constitution which provides, by the 9th section of the 1st article: that the migration or importation of such persons as any of the states shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by the Congress, prior to the year 1808.”  
Among the answers given to this objection to the constitutionality of the act, the following very remarkable one is extracted.  
“Thirdly, that as the Constitution has given to the states, no power to remove aliens, during the period of the limitation under consideration, in the mean time, on the construction assumed, there would be no authority in the country, empowered to send away dangerous aliens which cannot be admitted.”  
The reasoning here used, would not in any view, be conclusive; because there are powers exercised by most other governments, which, in the United States are withheld by the people, both from the general government and from the state governments. Of this sort are many of the powers prohibited by the Declarations of right prefixed to the Constitutions, or by the clauses in the Constitutions, in the nature of such Declarations. Nay, so far is the political system of the United States distinguishable from that of other countries, by the caution with which powers are delegated and defined; that in one very important case, even of commercial regulation and revenue, the power is absolutely locked up against the hands of both governments. A tax on exports can be laid by no Constitutional authority whatever. Under a system thus peculiarly guarded, there could surely be no absurdity in supposing, that alien friends, who if guilty of treasonable machinations may be punished, or if suspected on probable grounds, may be secured by pledges or imprisonment, in like manner with permanent citizens, were never meant to be subjected to banishment by any arbitrary and unusual process, either under the one government or the other.  
But it is not the inconclusiveness of the general reasoning in this passage, which chiefly calls the attention to it. It is the principle assumed by it, that the powers held by the states, are given to them by the constitution of the United States; and the inference from this principle, that the powers supposed to be necessary which are not so given to the state governments, must reside in the government of the United States.  
The respect which is felt for every portion of the constituted authorities, forbids some of the reflections which this singular paragraph might excite; and they are the more readily suppressed, as it may be presumed, with justice perhaps, as well as candour, that inadvertence may have had its share in the error. It would be an unjustifiable delicacy nevertheless, to pass by so portentous a claim, proceeding from so high an authority, without a monitory notice of the fatal tendencies with which it would be pregnant.  
Lastly, it is said, that a law on the same subject with the alien act, passed by this state originally in 1785, and re-enacted in 1792, is a proof that a summary removal of suspected aliens, was not heretofore regarded by the Virginia Legislature as liable to the objections now urged against such a measure.  
This charge against Virginia, vanishes before the simple remark, that the law of Virginia relates to “suspicious persons, being the subjects of any foreign power or state, who shall have made a declaration of war, or actually commenced hostilities, or from whom the President shall apprehend hostile designs”; whereas the act of Congress relates to aliens, being the subjects of foreign powers and states, who have neither declared war, nor commenced hostilities, nor from whom hostile designs are apprehended.  
II. It is next affirmed of the alien act, that it unites legislative, judicial and executive powers in the hands of the President.  
However difficult it may be to mark, in every case, with clearness and certainty, the line which divides legislative power, from the other departments of power; all will agree, that the powers referred to these departments may be so general and undefined, as to be of a legislative, not of an executive or judicial nature; and may for that reason be unconstitutional. Details, to a certain degree, are essential to the nature and character of a law; and, on criminal subjects, it is proper, that details should leave as little as possible to the discretion of those who are to apply and to execute the law. If nothing more were required, in exercising a legislative trust, than a general conveyance of authority, without laying down any precise rules, by which the authority conveyed, should be carried into effect; it would follow, that the whole power of legislation might be transferred by the legislature from itself, and proclamations might become substitutes for laws. A delegation of power in this latitude, would not be denied to be a union of the different powers.  
  
To determine then, whether the appropriate powers of the distinct departments are united by the act authorising the executive to remove aliens, it must be enquired whether it contains such details, definitions, and rules, as appertain to the true character of a law; especially, a law by which personal liberty is invaded, property deprived of its value to the owner, and life itself indirectly exposed to danger.  
The alien act, declares, “that it shall be lawful for the president to order all such aliens as he shall judge dangerous to the peace and safety of the United States, or shall have reasonable grounds to suspect, are concerned in any treasonable, or secret machinations, against the government thereof, to depart,” &amp;c.  
Could a power be well given in terms less definite, less particular, and less precise. To be dangerous to the public safety; to be suspected of secret machinations against the government: these can never be mistaken for legal rules or certain definitions. They leave every thing to the President. His will is the law.  
But it is not a legislative power only that is given to the President. He is to stand in the place of the judiciary also. His suspicion is the only evidence which is to convict: his order the only judgment which is to be executed.  
Thus it is the President whose will is to designate the offensive conduct; it is his will that is to ascertain the individuals on whom it is charged; and it is his will, that is to cause the sentence to be executed. It is rightly affirmed therefore, that the act unites legislative and judicial powers to those of the executive.  
III. It is affirmed that this union of powers subverts the general principles of free government.  
It has become an axiom in the science of government, that a separation of the legislative, executive and judicial departments, is necessary to the preservation of public liberty. No where has this axiom been better understood in theory, or more carefully pursued in practice, than in the United States.  
IV. It is affirmed that such a union of power subverts the particular organization and positive provisions of the federal constitution.  
According to the particular organization of the constitution, its legislative powers are vested in the Congress; its executive powers in the President, and its judicial powers, in a supreme and inferior tribunals. The union of any two of these powers, and still more of all three, in any one of these departments, as has been shewn to be done by the alien act, must consequently subvert the constitutional organization of them.  
That positive provisions in the constitution, securing to individuals the benefits of fair trial, are also violated by the union of powers in the alien act, necessarily results from the two facts, that the act relates to alien friends, and that alien friends being under the municipal law only, are entitled to its protection.  
The second object against which the resolution protests is the sedition act.  
Of this act it is affirmed 1. That it exercises in like manner a power not delegated by the constitution. 2d. That the power, on the contrary, is expressly and positively forbidden by one of the amendments to the constitution. 3d. That this is a power, which more than any other ought to produce universal alarm; because it is levelled against that right of freely examining public characters and measures, and of free communication thereon; which has ever been justly deemed the only effectual guardian of every other right.  
I. That it exercises a power not delegated by the constitution.  
Here, again it will be proper to recollect, that the Federal Government being composed of powers specifically granted, with a reservation of all others to the states or to the people, the positive authority under which the sedition act could be passed must be produced by those who assert its constitutionality. In what part of the constitution then is this authority to be found?  
Several attempts have been made to answer this question, which will be examined in their order. The committee will begin with one, which has filled them with equal astonishment and apprehension; and which, they cannot but persuade themselves, must have the same effect on all, who will consider it with coolness and impartiality, and with a reverence for our constitution, in the true character in which it issued from the sovereign authority of the people. The committee refer to the doctrine lately advanced as a sanction to the sedition act: “that the common or unwritten law,” a law of vast extent and complexity, and embracing almost every possible subject of legislation, both civil and criminal, “makes a part of the law of these states; in their united and national capacity.”  
The novelty, and in the judgment of the committee, the extravagance of this pretension, would have consigned it to the silence, in which they have passed by other arguments, which an extraordinary zeal for the act has drawn into the discussion. But the auspices, under which this innovation presents itself, have constrained the committee to bestow on it an attention, which other considerations might have forbidden.  
In executing the task, it may be of use, to look back to the colonial state of this country, prior to the revolution; to trace the effect of the revolution which converted the colonies into independent states; to enquire into the import of the articles of confederation, the first instrument by which the union of the states was regularly established; and finally to consult the Constitution of 1788, which is the oracle that must decide the important question.  
In the state prior to the revolution, it is certain that the common law under different limitations, made a part of the colonial codes. But whether it be understood that the original colonists brought the law with them, or made it their law by adoption; it is equally certain that it was the separate law of each colony within its respective limits, and was unknown to them, as a law pervading and operating through the whole, as one society.  
It could not possibly be otherwise. The common law was not the same in any two of the colonies; in some, the modifications were materially and extensively different. There was no common legislature, by which a common will, could be expressed in the form of a law; nor any common magistracy, by which such a law could be carried into practice. The will of each colony alone and separately, had its organs for these purposes.  
This stage of our political history, furnishes no foothold for the patrons of this new doctrine.  
Did then, the principle or operation of the great event which made the colonies, independent states, imply or introduce the common law, as a law of the union?  
The fundamental principle of the revolution was, that the colonies were co-ordinate members with each other, and with Great-Britain; of an Empire, united by a common Executive Sovereign, but not united by any common Legislative Sovereign. The Legislative power was maintained to be as complete in each American Parliament, as in the British Parliament. And the royal prerogative was in force in each colony, by virtue of its acknowledging the King for its Executive Magistrate, as it was in Great-Britain, by virtue of a like acknowledgment there. A denial of these principles by Great-Britain, and the assertion of them by America, produced the revolution.  
There was a time indeed, when an exception to the Legislative separation of the several component and co-equal parts of the Empire, obtained a degree of acquiescence. The British Parliament was allowed to regulate the trade with foreign nations, and between the different parts of the Empire. This was however mere practice without right, and contrary to the true theory of the constitution. The conveniency of some regulations in both those cases, was apparent; and as there was no Legislature with power over the whole, nor any constitutional pre-eminence among the Legislatures of the several parts; it was natural for the Legislature of that particular part which was the eldest and the largest, to assume this function, and for the others to acquiesce in it. This tacit arrangement was the less criticised, as the regulations established by the British Parliament, operated in favor of that part of the Empire, which seemed to bear the principal share of the public burdens, and were regarded as an indemnification of its advances for the other parts. As long as this regulating power was confined to the two objects of conveniency and equity, it was not complained of, nor much enquired into. But no sooner was it perverted to the selfish views of the party assuming it, than the injured parties began to feel and to reflect; and the moment the claim to a direct and indefinite power was ingrafted on the precedent of the regulating power, the whole charm was dissolved, and every eye opened to the usurpation. The assertion by G.B. of a power to make laws for the other members of the Empire in all cases whatsoever, ended in the discovery, that she had a right to make laws for them, in no cases whatsoever.  
Such being the ground of our revolution, no support nor colour can be drawn from it, for the doctrine that the common law is binding on these states as one society. The doctrine on the contrary, is evidently repugnant to the fundamental principle of the revolution.  
The articles of confederation, are the next source of information on this subject.  
In the interval between the commencement of the revolution, and the final ratification of these articles, the nature and extent of the union was determined by the circumstances of the crisis, rather than by any accurate delineation of the general authority. It will not be alledged that the “common law,” could have had any legitimate birth as a law of the United States, during that state of things. If it came as such, into existence at all, the charter of confederation must have been its parent.  
Here again, however, its pretensions are absolutely destitute of foundation. This instrument does not contain a sentence or syllable, that can be tortured into a countenance of the idea, that the parties to it were with respect to the objects of the common law, to form one community. No such law is named or implied, or alluded to, as being in force, or as brought into force by that compact. No provision is made by which such a law could be carried into operation; whilst on the other hand, every such inference or pretext is absolutely precluded, by article 2d, which declares, “that each state retains its sovereignty, freedom and independence, and every power, jurisdiction and right, which is not by this confederation expressly delegated to the United States, in Congress assembled.”  
Thus far it appears, that not a vestige of this extraordinary doctrine can be found, in the origin or progress of American institutions. The evidence against it, has, on the contrary, grown stronger at every step; till it has amounted to a formal and positive exclusion, by written articles of compact among the parties concerned.  
Is this exclusion revoked, and the common law introduced as a national law, by the present constitution of the United States? This is the final question to be examined.  
It is readily admitted, that particular parts of the common law, may have a sanction from the constitution, so far as they are necessarily comprehended in the technical phrases which express the powers delegated to the government; and so far also, as such other parts may be adopted as necessary and proper, for carrying into execution the powers expressly delegated. But the question does not relate to either of these portions of the common law. It relates to the common law, beyond these limitations.  
The only part of the constitution which seems to have been relied on in this case, is the 2d sect. of art. III. “The judicial power shall extend to all cases, in law and equity, arising under this constitution, the laws of the United States, and treaties made or which shall be made under their authority.”  
It has been asked what cases distinct from those arising under the laws and treaties of the United States, can arise under the constitution, other than those arising under the common law; and it is inferred, that the common law is accordingly adopted or recognized by the constitution.  
Never perhaps was so broad a construction applied to a text so clearly unsusceptible of it. If any colour for the inference could be found, it must be in the impossibility of finding any other cases in law and equity, within the provisions of the constitution, to satisfy the expression; and rather than resort to a construction affecting so essentially the whole character of the government, it would perhaps be more rational to consider the expression as a mere pleonasm or inadvertence. But it is not necessary to decide on such a dilemma. The expression is fully satisfied, and its accuracy justified, by two descriptions of cases, to which the judicial authority is extended, and neither of which implies that the common law is the law of the United States. One of these descriptions comprehends the cases growing out of the restrictions on the legislative power of the states. For example, it is provided that “no state shall emit bills of credit,” or “make any thing but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts.” Should this prohibition be violated, and a suit between citizens of the same state be the consequence, this would be a case arising under the constitution before the judicial power of the United States. A second description comprehends suits between citizens and foreigners, or citizens of different states, to be decided according to the state or foreign laws; but submitted by the constitution to the judicial power of the United States; the judicial power being, in several instances, extended beyond the legislative power of the United States.  
  
To this explanation of the text, the following observations may be added.  
The expression, cases in law and equity, is manifestly confined to cases of a civil nature; and would exclude cases of criminal jurisdiction. Criminal cases in law and equity, would be a language unknown to the law.  
The succeeding paragraph of the same section, is in harmony with this construction. It is in these words—“In all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and those in which a state shall be a party, the Supreme Court shall have original jurisdiction. In all the other cases (including cases in law and equity arising under the constitution) the Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction both as to law and fact; with such exceptions, and under such regulations as Congress shall make.”  
This paragraph, by expressly giving an appellate jurisdiction, in cases of law and equity arising under the constitution, to fact, as well as to law, clearly excludes criminal cases, where the trial by jury is secured; because the fact, in such cases, is not a subject of appeal. And although the appeal is liable to such exceptions and regulations as Congress may adopt; yet it is not to be supposed that an exception of all criminal cases could be contemplated; as well because a discretion in Congress to make or omit the exception would be improper; as because it would have been unnecessary. The exception could as easily have been made by the constitution itself, as referred to the Congress.  
Once more, the amendment last added to the constitution, deserves attention, as throwing light on this subject. “The judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States, by citizens of another state, or by citizens or subjects of any foreign power.” As it will not be pretended that any criminal proceeding could take place against a state; the terms law or equity, must be understood as appropriate to civil in exclusion of criminal cases.  
From these considerations, it is evident, that this part of the constitution, even if it could be applied at all, to the purpose for which it has been cited, would not include any cases whatever of a criminal nature; and consequently, would not authorise the inference from it, that the judicial authority extends to offences against the common law, as offences arising under the constitution.  
It is further to be considered, that even if this part of the constitution could be strained into an application to every common law case, criminal as well as civil, it could have no effect in justifying the sedition act; which is an exercise of legislative, and not of judicial power: and it is the judicial power only of which the extent is defined in this part of the constitution.  
  
There are two passages in the constitution, in which a description of the law of the United States, is found—The first is contained in article III. sect. 2, in the words following: “This constitution, the laws of the United States, and treaties made, or which shall be made under their authority.” The second is contained in the 2d paragraph of art. VI. as follows: “This constitution and the laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof, and all treaties made, or which shall be made under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land.” The first of these descriptions was meant as a guide to the judges of the United States; the second as a guide to the judges in the several states. Both of them consist of an enumeration, which was evidently meant to be precise and compleat. If the common law had been understood to be a law of the United states, it is not possible to assign a satisfactory reason why it was not expressed in the enumeration.  
In aid of these objections, the difficulties and confusion inseparable from a constructive introduction of the common law, would afford powerful reasons against it.  
Is it to be the common law with, or without the British statutes?  
If without the statutory amendments, the vices of the code would be insupportable.  
If with these amendments, what period is to be fixed for limiting the British authority over our laws?  
Is it to be the date of the eldest or the youngest of the colonies?  
Or are the dates to be thrown together, and a medium deduced?  
Or is our independence to be taken for the date?  
Is, again, regard to be had to the various changes in the common law made by the local codes of America?  
Is regard to be had to such changes, subsequent, as well as prior, to the establishment of the constitution?  
Is regard to be had to future, as well as past changes?  
Is the law to be different in every state, as differently modified by its code; or are the modifications of any particular state, to be applied to all?  
And on the latter supposition, which among the state codes would form the standard?  
Questions of this sort might be multiplied with as much ease, as there would be difficulty in answering them.  
The consequences flowing from the proposed construction, furnish other objections equally conclusive; unless the text were peremptory in its meaning, and consistent with other parts of the instrument.  
These consequences may be in relation; to the legislative authority of the United States; to the executive authority; to the judicial authority, and to the governments of the several states.  
If it be understood that the common law is established by the constitution, it follows that no part of the law can be altered by the legislature; such of the statutes already passed as may be repugnant thereto, would be nullified, particularly the “sedition act” itself which boasts of being a melioration of the common law; and the whole code with all its incongruities, barbarisms, and bloody maxims would be inviolably saddled on the good people of the United States.  
Should this consequence be rejected, and the common law be held, like other laws, liable to revision and alteration, by the authority of Congress; it then follows, that the authority of Congress is co-extensive with the objects of common law; that is to say, with every object of legislation: For to every such object, does some branch or other of the common law extend. The authority of Congress would therefore be no longer under the limitations, marked out in the constitution. They would be authorized to legislate in all cases whatsoever.  
In the next place, as the President possesses the executive powers of the constitution, and is to see that the laws be faithfully executed, his authority also must be co-extensive with every branch of the common law. The additions which this would make to his power, though not readily to be estimated, claim the most serious attention.  
This is not all; it will merit the most profound consideration, how far an indefinite admission of the common law, with a latitude in construing it, equal to the construction by which it is deduced from the constitution, might draw after it the various prerogatives making part of the unwritten law of England. The English constitution itself is nothing more than a composition of unwritten laws and maxims.  
In the third place, whether the common law be admitted as of legal or of constitutional obligation, it would confer on the judicial department a discretion little short of a legislative power.  
On the supposition of its having a constitutional obligation, this power in the judges would be permanent and irremediable by the legislature. On the other supposition, the power would not expire, until the legislature should have introduced a full system of statutory provisions. Let it be observed too, that besides all the uncertainties above enumerated, and which present an immense field for judicial discretion, it would remain with the same department to decide what parts of the common law would, and what would not, be properly applicable to the circumstances of the United States.  
A discretion of this sort, has always been lamented as incongruous and dangerous, even in the colonial and state courts; although so much narrowed by positive provisions in the local codes on all the principal subjects embraced by the common law. Under the United States, where so few laws exist on those subjects, and where so great a lapse of time must happen before the vast chasm could be supplied, it is manifest that the power of the judges over the law would, in fact, erect them into legislators; and that for a long time, it would be impossible for the citizens to conjecture, either what was, or would be law.  
In the last place, the consequence of admitting the common law as the law of the United States, on the authority of the individual states, is as obvious as it would be fatal. As this law relates to every subject of legislation, and would be paramount to the constitutions and laws of the states; the admission of it would overwhelm the residuary sovereignty of the states, and by one constructive operation new model the whole political fabric of the country.  
From the review thus taken of the situation of the American colonies prior to their independence; of the effect of this event on their situation; of the nature and import of the articles of confederation; of the true meaning of the passage in the existing constitution from which the common law has been deduced; of the difficulties and uncertainties incident to the doctrine; and of its vast consequences in extending the powers of the federal government, and in superceding the authorities of the state governments; the committee feel the utmost confidence in concluding that the common law never was, nor by any fair construction, ever can be, deemed a law for the American people as one community; and they indulge the strongest expectation that the same conclusion will finally be drawn, by all candid and accurate enquirers into the subject. It is indeed distressing to reflect, that it ever should have been made a question, whether the constitution, on the whole face of which is seen so much labour to enumerate and define the several objects of federal power, could intend to introduce in the lump, in an indirect manner, and by a forced construction of a few phrases, the vast and multifarious jurisdiction involved in the common law; a law filling so many ample volumes; a law overspreading the entire field of legislation; and a law that would sap the foundation of the constitution as a system of limited and specified powers. A severer reproach could not in the opinion of the committee be thrown on the constitution, on those who framed, or on those who established it, than such a supposition would throw on them.  
The argument then drawn from the common law, on the ground of its being adopted or recognized by the constitution, being inapplicable to the Sedition act, the committee will proceed to examine the other arguments which have been founded on the constitution.  
They will waste but little time on the attempt to cover the act by the preamble to the constitution; it being contrary to every acknowledged rule of construction, to set up this part of an instrument, in opposition to the plain meaning, expressed in the body of the instrument. A preamble usually contains the general motives or reasons, for the particular regulations or measures which follow it; and is always understood to be explained and limited by them. In the present instance, a contrary interpretation would have the inadmissable effect, of rendering nugatory or improper, every part of the constitution which succeeds the preamble.  
The paragraph in art. I, sect. 8, which contains the power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises, to pay the debts, and provide for the common defence and general welfare, having been already examined, will also require no particular attention in this place. It will have been seen that in its fair and consistent meaning, it cannot enlarge the enumerated powers vested in Congress.  
The part of the constitution which seems most to be recurred to, in defence of the “Sedition Act,” is the last clause of the above section, empowering Congress “to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by this constitution in the government of the United States, or in any department or officer thereof.”  
The plain import of this clause is, that Congress shall have all the incidental or instrumental powers, necessary and proper for carrying into execution all the express powers; whether they be vested in the government of the United States, more collectively, or in the several departments, or officers thereof. It is not a grant of new powers to Congress, but merely a declaration, for the removal of all uncertainty, that the means of carrying into execution, those otherwise granted, are included in the grant.  
Whenever, therefore a question arises concerning the constitutionality of a particular power; the first question is, whether the power be expressed in the constitution. If it be, the question is decided. If it be not expressed; the next enquiry must be, whether it is properly an incident to an express power, and necessary to its execution. If it be, it may be exercised by Congress. If it be not; Congress cannot exercise it.  
Let the question be asked, then, whether the power over the press exercised in the “sedition act,” be found among the powers expressly vested in the Congress? This is not pretended.  
Is there any express power, for executing which, it is a necessary and proper power?  
The power which has been selected, as least remote, in answer to this question, is that of “suppressing insurrections”; which is said to imply a power to prevent insurrections, by punishing whatever may lead or tend to them. But it surely cannot, with the least plausibility, be said, that a regulation of the press, and a punishment of libels, are exercises of a power to suppress insurrections. The most that could be said, would be, that the punishment of libels, if it had the tendency ascribed to it, might prevent the occasion, of passing or executing laws, necessary and proper for the suppression of insurrections.  
  
Has the federal government no power, then, to prevent as well as to punish resistance to the laws?  
They have the power which the constitution deemed most proper in their hands for the purpose. The Congress has power, before it happens, to pass laws for punishing it; and the Executive and Judiciary have power to enforce those laws when it does happen.  
It must be recollected by many, and could be shewn to the satisfaction of all, that the construction here put on the terms ‘necessary and proper’ is precisely the construction which prevailed during the discussions and ratifications of the constitution. It may be added, and cannot too often be repeated, that it is a construction absolutely necessary to maintain their consistency with the peculiar character of the government, as possessed of particular and defined powers only; not of the general and indefinite powers vested in ordinary governments. For if the power to suppress insurrections, includes a power to punish libels; or if the power to punish, includes a power to prevent, by all the means that may have that tendency; such is the relation and influence among the most remote subjects of legislation, that a power over a very few, would carry with it a power over all. And it must be wholly immaterial, whether unlimited powers be exercised under the name of unlimited powers, or be exercised under the name of unlimited means of carrying into execution, limited powers.  
This branch of the subject will be closed with a reflection which must have weight with all; but more especially with those who place peculiar reliance on the Judicial exposition of the constitution, as the bulwark provided against undue extensions of the Legislative power. If it be understood that the powers implied in the specified powers, have an immediate and appropriate relation to them, as means, necessary and proper for carrying them into execution, questions on the constitutionality of laws passed for this purpose, will be of a nature sufficiently precise and determinate for Judicial cognizance and controul. If, on the other hand, Congress are not limited in the choice of means by any such appropriate relation of them to the specified powers; but may employ all such means as they may deem fitted to prevent as well as to punish, crimes subjected to their authority; such as may have a tendency only to promote an object for which they are authorized to provide; every one must perceive that questions relating to means of this sort, must be questions of mere policy and expediency; on which legislative discretion alone can decide, and from which the judicial interposition and controul are completely excluded.  
II. The next point which the resolution requires to be proved, is, that the power over the press exercised by the sedition act, is positively forbidden by one of the amendments to the constitution.  
  
The amendment stands in these words—“Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.”  
In the attempts to vindicate the “Sedition act,” it has been contended, 1. That the “freedom of the press” is to be determined by the meaning of these terms in the common law. 2. That the article supposes the power over the press to be in Congress, and prohibits them only from abridging the freedom allowed to it by the common law.  
Although it will be shewn, in examining the second of these positions, that the amendment is a denial to Congress of all power over the press; it may not be useless to make the following observations on the first of them.  
It is deemed to be a sound opinion, that the sedition act, in its definition of some of the crimes created, is an abridgment of the freedom of publication, recognized by principles of the common law in England.  
The freedom of the press under the common law, is, in the defences of the sedition act, made to consist in an exemption from all previous restraint on printed publications, by persons authorized to inspect and prohibit them. It appears to the committee, that this idea of the freedom of the press, can never be admitted to be the American idea of it: since a law inflicting penalties on printed publications, would have a similar effect with a law authorizing a previous restraint on them. It would seem a mockery to say, that no law should be passed, preventing publications from being made, but that laws might be passed for punishing them in case they should be made.  
The essential difference between the British government, and the American constitutions, will place this subject in the clearest light.  
In the British government, the danger of encroachments on the rights of the people, is understood to be confined to the executive magistrate. The representatives of the people in the legislature, are not only exempt themselves, from distrust, but are considered as sufficient guardians of the rights of their constituents against the danger from the executive. Hence it is a principle, that the parliament is unlimited in its power; or in their own language, is omnipotent. Hence too, all the ramparts for protecting the rights of the people, such as their magna charta, their bill of rights, &amp;c. are not reared against the parliament, but against the royal prerogative. They are merely legislative precautions, against executive usurpations. Under such a government as this, an exemption of the press from previous restraint by licensers appointed by the king, is all the freedom that can be secured to it.  
In the United States, the case is altogether different. The people, not the government, possess the absolute sovereignty. The legislature, no less than the executive, is under limitations of power. Encroachments are regarded as possible from the one, as well as from the other. Hence in the United States, the great and essential rights of the people are secured against legislative, as well as against executive ambition. They are secured, not by laws paramount to prerogative; but by constitutions paramount to laws. This security of the freedom of the press, requires that it should be exempt, not only from previous restraint by the executive, as in Great Britain; but from legislative restraint also; and this exemption, to be effectual, must be an exemption, not only from the previous inspection of licensers, but from the subsequent penalty of laws.  
The state of the press, therefore, under the common law, can not in this point of view, be the standard of its freedom, in the United States.  
But there is another view, under which it may be necessary to consider this subject. It may be alledged, that although the security for the freedom of the press, be different in Great Britain and in this country; being a legal security only in the former, and a constitutional security in the latter; and although there may be a further difference, in an extension of the freedom of the press, here, beyond an exemption from previous restraint, to an exemption from subsequent penalties also; yet that the actual legal freedom of the press, under the common law, must determine the degree of freedom, which is meant by the terms and which is constitutionally secured against both previous and subsequent restraints.  
The committee are not unaware of the difficulty of all general questions which, may turn on the proper boundary between the liberty and licentiousness of the press. They will leave it therefore for consideration only, how far the difference between the nature of the British government, and the nature of the American governments, and the practice under the latter, may shew the degree of rigor in the former, to be inapplicable to, and not obligatory in, the latter.  
The nature of governments elective, limited and responsible, in all their branches, may well be supposed to require a greater freedom of animadversion, than might be tolerated by the genius of such a government as that of Great Britain. In the latter, it is a maxim, that the king, an hereditary, not a responsible magistrate, can do no wrong; and that the legislature, which in two thirds of its composition, is also hereditary, not responsible, can do what it pleases. In the United States, the executive magistrates are not held to be infallible, nor the legislatures to be omnipotent; and both being elective, are both responsible. Is it not natural and necessary, under such different circumstances, that a different degree of freedom, in the use of the press, should be contemplated?  
Is not such an inference favored by what is observable in Great Britain itself? Notwithstanding the general doctrine of the common law, on the subject of the press, and the occasional punishment of those, who use it with a freedom offensive to the government; it is well known, that with respect to the responsible members of the government, where the reasons operating here, become applicable there; the freedom exercised by the press, and protected by the public opinion, far exceeds the limits prescribed by the ordinary rules of law. The ministry, who are responsible to impeachment, are at all times, animadverted on, by the press, with peculiar freedom; and during the elections for the House of Commons, the other responsible part of the government, the press is employed with as little reserve towards the candidates.  
The practice in America must be entitled to much more respect. In every state, probably, in the union, the press has exerted a freedom in canvassing the merits and measures of public men, of every description, which has not been confined to the strict limits of the common law. On this footing, the freedom of the press has stood; on this footing it yet stands. And it will not be a breach, either of truth or of candour, to say, that no persons or presses are in the habit of more unrestrained animadversions on the proceedings and functionaries of the state governments, than the persons and presses most zealous, in vindicating the act of Congress for punishing similar animadversions on the government of the United States.  
The last remark will not be understood, as claiming for the state governments, an immunity greater than they have heretofore enjoyed. Some degree of abuse is inseparable from the proper use of every thing; and in no instance is this more true, than in that of the press. It has accordingly been decided by the practice of the states, that it is better to leave a few of its noxious branches, to their luxuriant growth, than by pruning them away, to injure the vigor of those yielding the proper fruits. And can the wisdom of this policy be doubted by any who reflect, that to the press alone, chequered as it is with abuses, the world is indebted for all the triumphs which have been gained by reason and humanity, over error and oppression; who reflect that to the same beneficent source, the United States owe much of the lights which conducted them to the rank of a free and independent nation; and which have improved their political system, into a shape so auspicious to their happiness. Had “Sedition acts,” forbidding every publication that might bring the constituted agents into contempt or disrepute, or that might excite the hatred of the people against the authors of unjust or pernicious measures, been uniformly enforced against the press; might not the United States have been languishing at this day, under the infirmities of a sickly confederation? Might they not possibly be miserable colonies, groaning under a foreign yoke?  
  
To these observations one fact will be added, which demonstrates that the common law cannot be admitted as the universal expositor of American terms, which may be the same with those contained in that law. The freedom of conscience, and of religion, are found in the same instruments, which assert the freedom of the press. It will never be admitted, that the meaning of the former, in the common law of England, is to limit their meaning in the United States.  
Whatever weight may be allowed to these considerations, the committee do not, however, by any means, intend to rest the question on them. They contend that the article of amendment, instead of supposing in Congress, a power that might be exercised over the press, provided its freedom be not abridged, was meant as a positive denial to Congress, of any power whatever on the subject.  
To demonstrate that this was the true object of the article, it will be sufficient to recall the circumstances which led to it, and to refer to the explanation accompanying the article.  
When the constitution was under the discussions which preceded its ratification, it is well known, that great apprehensions were expressed by many, lest the omission of some positive exception from the powers delegated, of certain rights, and of the freedom of the press particularly, might expose them to the danger of being drawn by construction within some of the powers vested in Congress; more especially of the power to make all laws necessary and proper, for carrying their other powers into execution. In reply to this objection, it was invariably urged to be a fundamental and characteristic principle of the constitution; that all powers not given by it, were reserved; that no powers were given beyond those enumerated in the constitution, and such as were fairly incident to them; that the power over the rights in question, and particularly over the press, was neither among the enumerated powers, nor incident to any of them; and consequently that an exercise of any such power, would be a manifest usurpation. It is painful to remark, how much the arguments now employed in behalf of the sedition act, are at variance with the reasoning which then justified the constitution, and invited its ratification.  
From this posture of the subject, resulted the interesting question in so many of the conventions, whether the doubts and dangers ascribed to the constitution, should be removed by any amendments previous to the ratification, or be postponed, in confidence that as far as they might be proper, they would be introduced in the form provided by the constitution. The latter course was adopted; and in most of the states, the ratifications were followed by propositions and instructions for rendering the constitution more explicit, and more safe to the rights, not meant to be delegated by it. Among those rights, the freedom of the press, in most instances, is particularly and emphatically mentioned. The firm and very pointed manner, in which it is asserted in the proceedings of the convention of this state will be hereafter seen.  
In pursuance of the wishes thus expressed, the first Congress that assembled under the constitution, proposed certain amendments which have since, by the necessary ratifications, been made a part of it; among which amendments is the article containing, among other prohibitions on the Congress, an express declaration that they should make no law abridging the freedom of the press.  
Without tracing farther the evidence on this subject, it would seem scarcely possible to doubt, that no power whatever over the press, was supposed to be delegated by the constitution, as it originally stood; and that the amendment was intended as a positive and absolute reservation of it.  
But the evidence is still stronger. The proposition of amendments made by Congress, is introduced in the following terms: “The Conventions of a number of the states having at the time of their adopting the Constitution, expressed a desire, in order to prevent misconstructions or abuse of its powers, that further declaratory and restrictive clauses should be added; and as extending the ground of public confidence in the government, will best ensure the beneficent ends of its institution.”  
Here is the most satisfactory and authentic proof, that the several amendments proposed, were to be considered as either declaratory or restrictive; and whether the one or the other, as corresponding with the desire expressed by a number of the states, and as extending the ground of public confidence in the government.  
Under any other construction of the amendment relating to the press, than that it declared the press to be wholly exempt from the power of Congress, the amendment could neither be said to correspond with the desire expressed by a number of the states, nor be calculated to extend the ground of public confidence in the government.  
Nay more; the construction employed to justify the “sedition act,” would exhibit a phenomenon, without a parallel in the political world. It would exhibit a number of respectable states, as denying first that any power over the press was delegated by the constitution; as proposing next, that an amendment to it, should explicitly declare that no such power was delegated; and finally, as concurring in an amendment actually recognizing or delegating such a power.  
Is then the federal government, it will be asked, destitute of every authority for restraining the licentiousness of the press, and for shielding itself against the libellous attacks which may be made on those who administer it?  
The constitution alone can answer this question. If no such power be expressly delegated, and it be not both necessary and proper to carry into execution an express power; above all, if it be expressly forbidden by a declaratory amendment to the constitution, the answer must be, that the federal government is destitute of all such authority.  
And might it not be asked in turn, whether it is not more probable, under all the circumstances which have been reviewed, that the authority should be withheld by the constitution, than that it should be left to a vague and violent construction: whilst so much pains were bestowed in enumerating other powers, and so many less important powers are included in the enumeration.  
Might it not be likewise asked, whether the anxious circumspection which dictated so many peculiar limitations on the general authority, would be unlikely to exempt the press altogether from that authority? The peculiar magnitude of some of the powers necessarily committed to the federal government; the peculiar duration required for the functions of some of its departments; the peculiar distance of the seat of its proceedings from the great body of its constituents; and the peculiar difficulty of circulating an adequate knowledge of them through any other channel; will not these considerations, some or other of which produced other exceptions from the powers of ordinary governments, all together, account for the policy of binding the hand of the federal government, from touching the channel which alone can give efficacy to its responsibility to its constituents; and of leaving those who administer it, to a remedy for injured reputations, under the same laws, and in the same tribunals, which protect their lives, their liberties, and their properties.  
But the question does not turn either on the wisdom of the constitution, or on the policy which gave rise to its particular organization. It turns on the actual meaning of the instrument; by which it has appeared, that a power over the press is clearly excluded, from the number of powers delegated to the federal government.  
III. And in the opinion of the committee well may it be said, as the resolution concludes with saying, that the unconstitutional power exercised over the press by the “sedition act,” ought “more than any other, to produce universal alarm; because it is leveled against that right of freely examining public characters and measures, and of free communication among the people thereon, which has ever been justly deemed the only effectual guardian of every other right.”  
Without scrutinising minutely into all the provisions of the “sedition act,” it will be sufficient to cite so much of section 2. as follows: “And be it further enacted, that if any person shall write, print, utter or publish, or shall cause or procure to be written, printed, uttered or published, or shall knowingly and willingly assist or aid in writing, printing, uttering or publishing any false, scandalous, and malicious writing or writings against the government of the United States, or either house of the Congress of the United States, or the President of the United States, with an intent to defame the said government, or either house of the said Congress, or the President, or to bring them, or either of them, into contempt or disrepute; or to excite against them, or either, or any of them, the hatred of the good people of the United States, &amp;c. then such person being thereof convicted before any court of the United States, having jurisdiction thereof, shall be punished by a fine not exceeding two thousand dollars, and by imprisonment not exceeding two years.”  
On this part of the act the following observations present themselves.  
1. The constitution supposes that the President, the Congress, and each of its houses, may not discharge their trusts, either from defect of judgment, or other causes. Hence, they are all made responsible to their constituents, at the returning periods of election; and the President, who is singly entrusted with very great powers, is, as a further guard, subjected to an intermediate impeachment.  
2. Should it happen, as the constitution supposes it may happen, that either of these branches of the government, may not have duly discharged its trust; it is natural and proper, that according to the cause and degree of their faults, they should be brought into contempt or disrepute, and incur the hatred of the people.  
3. Whether it has, in any case, happened that the proceedings of either, or all of those branches, evinces such a violation of duty as to justify a contempt, a disrepute or hatred among the people, can only be determined by a free examination thereof, and a free communication among the people thereon.  
4. Whenever it may have actually happened, that proceedings of this sort are chargeable on all or either of the branches of the government, it is the duty as well as right of intelligent and faithful citizens, to discuss and promulge them freely, as well to controul them by the censorship of the public opinion, as to promote a remedy according to the rules of the constitution. And it cannot be avoided, that those who are to apply the remedy must feel, in some degree, a contempt or hatred against the transgressing party.  
5. As the act was passed on July 14, 1798, and is to be in force until March 3, 1801, it was of course, that during its continuance, two elections of the entire House of Representatives, an election of a part of the Senate, and an election of a President, were to take place.  
6. That consequently, during all these elections, intended by the constitution to preserve the purity, or to purge the faults of the administration, the great remedial rights of the people were to be exercised, and the responsibility of their public agents to be skreened, under the penalties of this act.  
  
May it not be asked of every intelligent friend to the liberties of his country whether, the power exercised in such an act as this, ought not to produce great and universal alarm? Whether a rigid execution of such an act, in time past, would not have repressed that information and communication among the people, which is indispensible to the just exercise of their electoral rights? And whether such an act, if made perpetual, and enforced with rigor, would not, in time to come, either destroy our free system of government, or prepare a convulsion that might prove equally fatal to it.  
In answer to such questions, it has been pleaded that the writings and publications forbidden by the act, are those only which are false and malicious, and intended to defame; and merit is claimed for the privilege allowed to authors to justify, by proving the truth of their publications, and for the limitations to which the sentence of fine and imprisonment is subjected.  
To those who concurred in the act, under the extraordinary belief, that the option lay between the passing of such an act, and leaving in force the common law of libels, which punishes truth equally with falsehood, and submits the fine and imprisonment to the indefinite discretion of the court, the merit of good intentions ought surely not to be refused. A like merit may perhaps be due for the discontinuance of the corporal punishment which the common law also leaves to the discretion of the court. This merit of intention, however, would have been greater, if the several mitigations had not been limited to so short a period; and the apparent inconsistency would have been avoided, between justifying the act at one time, by contrasting it with the rigors of the common law, otherwise in force; and at another time by appealing to the nature of the crisis, as requiring the temporary rigor exerted by the act.  
But whatever may have been the meritorious intentions of all or any who contributed to the sedition act; a very few reflections will prove, that its baneful tendency is little diminished by the privilege of giving in evidence the truth of the matter contained in political writings.  
In the first place, where simple and naked facts alone are in question, there is sufficient difficulty in some cases, and sufficient trouble and vexation in all, of meeting a prosecution from the government, with the full and formal proof, necessary in a court of law.  
But in the next place, it must be obvious to the plainest minds, that opinions, and inferences, and conjectural observations, are not only in many cases inseparable from the facts, but may often be more the objects of the prosecution than the facts themselves; or may even be altogether abstracted from particular facts; and that opinions and inferences, and conjectural observations, cannot be subjects of that kind of proof which appertains to facts, before a court of law.  
  
Again, it is no less obvious, that the intent to defame or bring into contempt or disrepute, or hatred, which is made a condition of the offence created by the act; cannot prevent its pernicious influence, on the freedom of the press. For omitting the enquiry, how far the malice of the intent is an inference of the law from the mere publication; it is manifestly impossible to punish the intent to bring those who administer the government into disrepute or contempt, without striking at the right of freely discussing public characters and measures: because those who engage in such discussions, must expect and intend to excite these unfavorable sentiments, so far as they may be thought to be deserved. To prohibit therefore the intent to excite those unfavorable sentiments against those who administer the government, is equivalent to a prohibition of the actual excitement of them; and to prohibit the actual excitement of them, is equivalent to a prohibition of discussions having that tendency and effect; which, again, is equivalent to a protection of those who administer the government, if they should at any time deserve the contempt or hatred of the people, against being exposed to it, by free animadversions on their characters and conduct. Nor can there be a doubt, if those in public trust be shielded by penal laws from such strictures of the press, as may expose them to contempt or disrepute, or hatred, where they may deserve it, that in exact proportion as they may deserve to be exposed, will be the certainty and criminality of the intent to expose them, and the vigilance of prosecuting and punishing it; nor a doubt, that a government thus intrenched in penal statutes, against the just and natural effects of a culpable administration, will easily evade the responsibility, which is essential to a faithful discharge of its duty.  
Let it be recollected, lastly, that the right of electing the members of the government, constitutes more particularly the essence of a free and responsible government. The value and efficacy of this right, depends on the knowledge of the comparative merits and demerits of the candidates for public trust; and on the equal freedom, consequently, of examining and discussing these merits and demerits of the candidates respectively. It has been seen that a number of important elections will take place whilst the act is in force; although it should not be continued beyond the term to which it is limited. Should there happen, then, as is extremely probable in relation to some or other of the branches of the government, to be competitions between those who are, and those who are not, members of the government; what will be the situations of the competitors? Not equal; because the characters of the former will be covered by the “sedition act” from animadversions exposing them to disrepute among the people; whilst the latter may be exposed to the contempt and hatred of the people, without a violation of the act. What will be the situation of the people? Not free; because they will be compelled to make their election between competitors, whose pretensions they are not permitted by the act, equally to examine, to discuss, and to ascertain. And from both these situations, will not those in power derive an undue advantage for continuing themselves in it; which by impairing the right of election, endangers the blessings of the government founded on it.  
It is with justice, therefore, that the General Assembly hath affirmed in the resolution, as well that the right of freely examining public characters and measures, and of free communication thereon, is the only effectual guardian of every other right; as that this particular right is leveled at, by the power exercised in the “sedition act.”  
The resolution next in order is as follows:  
That this state having by its Convention, which ratified the Federal Constitution expressly declared, that among other essential rights, “the liberty of conscience and of the press cannot be cancelled, abridged, restrained or modified by any authority of the United States,” and from its extreme anxiety to guard these rights from every possible attack of sophistry and ambition, having with other states, recommended an amendment for that purpose, which amendment was, in due time, annexed to the constitution; it would mark a reproachful inconsistency, and criminal degeneracy, if an indifference were not shewn, to the most palpable violation of one of the rights, thus declared and secured; and to the establishment of a precedent, which may be fatal to the other.  
To place this resolution in its just light, it will be necessary to recur to the act of ratification by Virginia which stands in the ensuing form.  
We, the Delegates of the people of Virginia, duly elected in pursuance of a recommendation from the General Assembly, and now met in Convention, having fully and freely investigated and discussed the proceedings of the federal convention, and being prepared as well as the most mature deliberation hath enabled us, to decide thereon; DO, in the name and in behalf of the people of Virginia, declare and make known, that the powers granted under the constitution, being derived from the people of the United States, may be resumed by them, whensoever the same shall be perverted to their injury or oppression; and that every power not granted thereby, remains with them, and at their will. That therefore, no right of any denomination can be cancelled, abridged, restrained or modified, by the Congress, by the Senate or House of Representatives acting in any capacity, by the President, or any department or officer of the United States, except in those instances in which power is given by the constitution for those purposes; and, that among other essential rights, the liberty of conscience and of the press, cannot be cancelled, abridged, restrained or modified by any authority of the United States.  
Here is an express and solemn declaration by the convention of the state, that they ratified the constitution in the sense, that no right of any denomination can be cancelled, abridged, restrained or modified by the government of the United States or any part of it; except in those instances in which power is given by the constitution; and in the sense particularly, “that among other essential rights, the liberty of conscience and freedom of the press cannot be cancelled, abridged, restrained or modified, by any authority of the United States.”  
Words could not well express, in a fuller or more forcible manner, the understanding of the convention, that the liberty of conscience and the freedom of the press, were equally and completely exempted from all authority whatever of the United States.  
Under an anxiety to guard more effectually these rights against every possible danger, the convention, after ratifying the constitution, proceeded to prefix to certain amendments proposed by them, a declaration of rights, in which are two articles providing, the one for the liberty of conscience, the other for the freedom of speech and of the press.  
Similar recommendations having proceeded from a number of other states; and Congress, as has been seen, having in consequence thereof, and with a view to extend the ground of public confidence, proposed among other declaratory and restrictive clauses, a clause expressly securing the liberty of conscience and of the press; and Virginia having concurred in the ratifications which made them a part of the constitution; it will remain with a candid public to decide, whether it would not mark an inconsistency and degeneracy, if an indifference were now shewn to a palpable violation of one of those rights, the freedom of the press; and to a precedent therein, which may be fatal to the other, the free exercise of religion.  
That the precedent established by the violation of the former of these rights, may, as is affirmed by the resolution, be fatal to the latter, appears to be demonstrable, by a comparison of the grounds on which they respectively rest; and from the scope of reasoning, by which the power over the former has been vindicated.  
First.  Both of these rights, the liberty of conscience and of the press, rest equally on the original ground of not being delegated by the constitution, and consequently withheld from the government. Any construction therefore, that would attack this original security for the one must have the like effect on the other.  
Secondly.  They are both equally secured by the supplement to the constitution; being both included in the same amendment, made at the same time, and by the same authority. Any construction or argument then which would turn the amendment into a grant or acknowledgment of power with respect to the press, might be equally applied to the freedom of religion.  
  
Thirdly.  If it be admitted that the extent of the freedom of the press secured by the amendment, is to be measured by the common law on this subject; the same authority may be resorted to, for the standard which is to fix the extent of the “free exercise of religion.” It cannot be necessary to say what this standard would be; whether the common law be taken solely as the unwritten, or as varied by the written, law of England.  
Fourthly.  If the words and phrases in the amendment, are to be considered as chosen with a studied discrimination, which yields an argument for a power over the press, under the limitation that its freedom be not abridged; the same argument results from the same consideration, for a power over the exercise of religion, under the limitation that its freedom be not prohibited.  
For if Congress may regulate the freedom of the press, provided they do not abridge it: because it is said only, “they shall not abridge it”; and is not said, “they shall make no law respecting it”: the analogy of reasoning is conclusive, that Congress may regulate and even abridge the free exercise of religion; provided they do not prohibit it; because it is said only “they shall not prohibit it”; and is not said “they shall make no law respecting or no law abridging it.”  
The General Assembly were governed by the clearest reason, then, in considering the “Sedition act,” which legislates on the freedom of the press, as establishing a precedent that may be fatal to the liberty of conscience and it will be the duty of all, in proportion as they value the security of the latter, to take the alarm at every encroachment on the former.  
The two concluding resolutions only remain to be examined. They are in the words following.  
“That the good people of this commonwealth, having ever felt, and continuing to feel the most sincere affection for their brethren of the other states; the truest anxiety for establishing and perpetuating the union of all; and the most scrupulous fidelity to that constitution, which is the pledge of mutual friendship, and the instrument of mutual happiness; the General Assembly doth solemnly appeal to the like dispositions in the other states, in confidence that they will concur with this commonwealth in declaring, as it does hereby declare, that the acts aforesaid, are unconstitutional; and, that the necessary and proper measures will be taken by each, for co-operating with this state, in maintaining unimpaired, the authorities, rights, and liberties, reserved to the states respectively, or to the People.”  
“That the Governor be desired, to transmit a copy of the foregoing resolutions to the executive authority of each of the other states, with a request that the same may be communicated to the Legislature thereof; and that a copy be furnished to each of the Senators and Representatives representing this state in the Congress of the United States.”  
The fairness and regularity of the course of proceeding, here pursued, have not protected it, against objections even from sources too respectable to be disregarded.  
It has been said that it belongs to the judiciary of the United States, and not to the state legislatures, to declare the meaning of the Federal Constitution.  
But a declaration that proceedings of the Federal Government are not warranted by the constitution, is a novelty neither among the citizens nor among the legislatures of the states; nor are the citizens or the legislature of Virginia, singular in the example of it.  
Nor can the declarations of either, whether affirming or denying the constitutionality of measures of the Federal Government; or whether made before or after judicial decisions thereon, be deemed, in any point of view, an assumption of the office of the judge. The declarations in such cases, are expressions of opinion, unaccompanied with any other effect, than what they may produce on opinion, by exciting reflection. The expositions of the judiciary, on the other hand, are carried into immediate effect by force. The former may lead to a change in the legislative expression of the general will; possibly to a change in the opinion of the judiciary: the latter enforces the general will, whilst that will and that opinion continue unchanged.  
And if there be no impropriety in declaring the unconstitutionality of proceedings in the Federal Government; where can be the impropriety of communicating the declaration to other states, and inviting their concurrence in a like declaration? What is allowable for one, must be allowable for all; and a free communication among the states, where the constitution imposes no restraint, is as allowable among the state governments, as among other public bodies, or private citizens. This consideration derives a weight, that cannot be denied to it, from the relation of the state legislatures, to the federal legislature, as the immediate constituents of one of its branches.  
The legislatures of the states have a right also, to originate amendments to the constitution, by a concurrence of two thirds of the whole number, in applications to Congress for the purpose. When new states are to be formed by a junction of two or more states, or parts of states, the legislatures of the states concerned, are, as well as Congress, to concur in the measure. The states have a right also, to enter into agreements, or compacts, with the consent of Congress. In all such cases, a communication among them, results from the object which is common to them.  
It is lastly to be seen, whether the confidence expressed by the resolution, that the necessary and proper measures, would be taken by the other states, for co-operating with Virginia, in maintaining the rights reserved to the states, or to the people, be in any degree liable to the objections which have been raised against it.  
If it be liable to objection, it must be, because either the object, or the means, are objectionable.  
The object being to maintain what the constitution has ordained, is in itself a laudable object.  
The means are expressed in the terms “the necessary and proper measures.” A proper object was to be pursued, by means both necessary and proper.  
To find an objection then, it must be shewn, that some meaning was annexed to these general terms, which was not proper; and for this purpose, either that the means used by the General Assembly, were an example of improper means, or that there were no proper means to which the terms could refer.  
In the example given by the state, of declaring the alien and sedition acts to be unconstitutional, and of communicating the declaration to the other states, no trace of improper means has appeared. And if the other states had concurred in making a like declaration, supported too by the numerous applications flowing immediately from the people, it can scarcely be doubted, that these simple means would have been as sufficient, as they are unexceptionable.  
It is no less certain, that other means might have been employed, which are strictly within the limits of the constitution. The legislatures of the states might have made a direct representation to Congress, with a view to obtain a rescinding of the two offensive acts; or they might have represented to their respective senators in Congress, their wish, that two thirds thereof would propose an explanatory amendment to the constitution; or two thirds of themselves, if such had been their option, might, by an application to Congress, have obtained a convention for the same object.  
These several means, though not equally eligible in themselves, nor probably, to the states, were all constitutionally open for consideration. And if the General Assembly, after declaring the two acts to be unconstitutional, the first and most obvious proceeding on the subject, did not undertake to point out to the other states, a choice among the farther measures that might become necessary and proper, the reserve will not be misconstrued by liberal minds, into any culpable imputation.  
These observations appear to form a satisfactory reply, to every objection which is not founded on a misconception of the terms, employed in the resolutions. There is one other however, which may be of too much importance not to be added. It cannot be forgotten, that among the arguments addressed to those, who apprehended danger to liberty, from the establishment of the general government over so great a country; the appeal was emphatically made to the intermediate existence of the state governments, between the people and that government, to the vigilance with which they would descry the first symptoms of usurpation, and to the promptitude with which they would sound the alarm to the public. This argument was probably not without its effect; and if it was a proper one, then, to recommend the establishment of the constitution; it must be a proper one now, to assist in its interpretation.  
The only part of the two concluding resolutions, that remains to be noticed, is the repetition in the first, of that warm affection to the union and its members, and of that scrupulous fidelity to the constitution which have been invariably felt by the people of this state. As the proceedings were introduced with these sentiments, they could not be more properly closed, than in the same manner. Should there be any so far misled, as to call in question the sincerity of these professions, whatever regret may be excited by the error, the General Assembly cannot descend into a discussion of it. Those who have listened to the suggestion, can only be left to their own recollection, of the part which this state has borne in the establishment of our national independence; in the establishment of our national constitution; and in maintaining under it, the authority and laws of the union, without a single exception of internal resistance or commotion. By recurring to these facts, they will be able to convince themselves, that the representatives of the people of Virginia must be above the necessity of opposing any other shield to attacks on their national patriotism, than their own consciousness and the justice of an enlightened public; who will perceive in the resolutions themselves, the strongest evidence of attachment both to the constitution and to the union, since it is only by maintaining the different governments and departments within their respective limits, that the blessings of either can be perpetuated. The extensive view of the subject thus taken by the committee, has led them to report to the house, as the result of the whole, the following resolution.  
Resolved, That the General Assembly, having carefully and respectfully attended to the proceedings of a number of the states, in answer to their resolutions of December 21, 1798, and having accurately and fully re-examined and re-considered the latter, find it to be their indispensable duty to adhere to the same, as founded in truth, as consonant with the constitution, and as conducive to its preservation; and more especially to be their duty, to renew, as they do hereby renew, their protest against “the alien and sedition acts,” as palpable and alarming infractions of the constitution

the day, refolved itfeif into a committee  
of the whole houfe, on the report of the  
committee to whom was committed the  
proceedings of fundry other ftates in an-  
swer to the resolutions of the General Al-  
fenibly of the lift day of December, 1798,  
and after fome time fpent therein, mr.  
Speaker refumed thSe chair, Gc Mr. Merce;  
reported, that tlie committee of the whole  
houfe h.id, according to order, had the faid  
report under their coniideration, and had  
made an amendment thereto, which he  
r6ad in his place, and then delivered in at  
the clerks tabie, where the fame was a-  
gajp twice read, and agreed to by the  
houfe.  
  
The faid report as amended, is as fol-  
lows.  
  
Whatever room might be found in the  
proceedings of fome of the Hates, who  
have difapprbved of the resolutions of the  
General AiTembly of this commonwealth,  
paffedon the 21 It day of December, 1798,  
i&quot;&lt;&gt;r painful remarks on the fpirit fx manner  
ofthejfe proceedings, it appears to the  
committee molt Confident with the duty,  
as well as dignity of the General Affem-  
Wy, to haften an oblivion of every cir-  
pumftahce, which might be confltrued i n-  
to diminution of mutual refpect, confi-  
dence and affection, among the members  
of the union.  
  
The committee have deemed it fcnore  
t.feful tafk, to revife with a critical £! e,  
the refolutions which have met with this  
difapprobatlon ; to elamine fully the fcVe-  
hich have  
  
re exprcifr-d.  
; coniteutjn  
of the* own  
  
tnowledge and correct:.  
  
The firft of the refolutions is in tiie  
words following :  
  
Refolved, that the General affembly of  
Virginia, doth unequivocally cxprefs a  
Srin refolution to maintain and defend the  
conltitution of the United States, afkEthc  
constitution of this Hate, againft evert ag-  
grdSon either foreign or domclHc, fcud  
that they will fupport the government of  
the United States in all meafures warran-  
ted by the former.  
  
No unfavorable comments can have bee  
made on the fen time nts here ezprefled  
To maintain and defend the  
of the United States, and  
(late, againft any aggreflion both foreign  
and domeftic, and to fupport the govern-  
ment of the United States in all meafures  
warrantedby their conltitution, areduties,  
which the general affembly ought always  
to feel, and to which on fuch an occafior.  
it was evidently proper to exprels their  
fincere and firm adherence.  
  
Li their next refolution. — The genera!  
affembly moft folemnly declares a wartr.  
attachment to the union of the ftates, to  
maintain which, it pledges all its powers ;  
and that for this end, it is their duty to watch  
over and oppofe every infraction of thofe  
principles, which constitute the only balls  
of that union becaufe a faithful obfor-  
vance of them c*u. alone fecure its cxift-  
ence and the public happinefs.  
  
The obfer vn lion jtifl made is equally ap-  
plicable to ibis -fo&#x27;emn dcclatatior. 6  
.warm attachment tothe union, and thi s p.  
lemn pledge to^nainlain it ; nor can any  
qucftion arife among enlightened frieu&#x27;ls  
of the uniiMt, as to the duty cf watching o-  
v-er and oppofirig.every infrafiiori of thole  
principles which cor.Ititutc its bafis, .and  
a faithful observance -which, can tdone  
fecure its cxittencc, and rhe public happi-  
nefs thereon dt-jiending. -  
  
The third refolution is in the words WL 1  
lnwing : &quot; \
  
That this ttffet.-.biy doth explicitly and  
peremptorily declare that it views the  
powers of the federal government, as rc-  
fulting from the compact, to which the  
ftates as parties limited by the plain fenle  
and intention of the inftrument conftitu-  
ting that compact ; as no farther valid  
than they are authorized by the grants e-  
numerated in that compact ; and that in  
cafe of a deliberate, palpable and dange-  
rous cxercife of other powers, not grant-  
ed by the faid compact, the ftates who are  
parties thereto, have the i j~ht, and are in  
duty bound, to interpofe, for airrefting the  
progrefl of the evil, and For maintaining  
within their limits, the authorities, rights  
  
: and liberties appertaining to them.  
  
I On this resolution, the committee have  
be flowed all the attention wliich its im-  
portance merits. - they have fcahned it  
not merely with a Itrict, but With a fe vere  
  
■ eye ; and they feel confidence in pronoun-  
  
; cing, that in its j 11 ft and fair construction,  
it is unexecptionably true in its fevcral  
  
I pohtions, as well as conftitutronal and  
  
• ponclufive in its inferences.  
  
Tlie refblution declares&#x27; first, tint &quot; it  
views the powers of the federal govr,rn-  
  
i ment, r.s refulting from the compact to  
which the (fates are parties,&quot; in other  
  
: words, that the federal powers are deri- &#x27;  
  
; -red from the conltitution, and that the  
  
I conltitution is a compact to which the  
  
j itates are parties.  
  
; Clear as the pofition mufl ferm, that  
i the federal powers are derived, from the  
j eonititution, and from that alone, the corn.  
I mit.ee are not unapprised of a late doct-  
j l ine which opens another fou re : of fede-  
I ral powers not lefs extenfive and impor-  
tant, tiian it is new and unexpeeled.  
.The examination of this doctrirte will be  
moll conveniently connected with a re- !  
(•view of a fucceeding refolution. The  
&#x27; committee fatisfy therafe&#x27;ves here with  
briefly remarking that in all the co-tein-  
I porary difeufSoas and comments, which  
I the conltitution underwent, it was con-  
| llantly justified and recommended nr- xhf.  
I ground, that the powers not given to the  
government, were withheld from it j and  
[ that if any doubt could have exifted on  
5 this fubjce&#x27;t, under the original text of the  
t conltitution, it is removed as far as words  
can remove it, by the 12th amendment,  
now a part of the conltitution, which ex-  
prefsly declares, &quot; that the powers not de-  
legated to the United States by the con-  
Uitution nor prohibited by it to the ftates,  
are referved to the Itates refpectivelyj or  
to the people.&quot;  
  
The other pofition involved in this \
branch of the refolution namely,&quot; that  
the Itates are parties to the eonititution  
or compact,&quot; is in the judgement of the  
committee, equally free from objection.  
It is indeed true that the term &quot; Slates,&quot;  
is fotnetimes ufedinavague fcr.fc, and  
fometimes in different fenfes, according  
to the fubject to which it is applied. Thus  
it fometimes mean? the feperate fections  
of territory occupied by the political fo-  
fomettir.es the par-  
  
ral objections and arguments wtuch  
appeared againft tiiem j and to enquire, i  
whether there be any errors of fact, oi  
principle or of reafoning, which the can- cieties within eacl  
  
dor of the General Affembly ought to ac- Ticular governments eftablifhed.by thofe  
  
jrTocieties, fometimes thofe focieties as or-  
Vanized into thofe particulargovernmcnta ;  
and laltly, it means the people compoling  
thofe political focieties, in their highelt  
foveteign capacity. Although, it might be  
wiOied that the perfection of language ad-  
mitted lefs diverfity in the bonification of  
the fame words, yet little inconveuiency  
is produced by it where the true feni&#x27;e can  
be collected with certainty from the diffe-  
rent applications. In the prefent in-  
ance whatever different conftrtietions  
the term of &quot; States,&quot; in the refolu-  
tion may have been entertained, all  
at leaft concur in that lalt mention-

on was fubmitted to the &quot; States In  
that fenfe the &quot; Slates,&quot; ratified it : and  
in that fenfe of the term &quot; States,&quot; they  
arc consequently parties to the compact  
from which the powers of the federal go-  
vernment refult.  
  
The next pofition is, that the general  
affembly views the powers of the federal  
government, &quot; as limited by the plain  
fenfe and intention of the inftrument con-  
(tituting that compact,&quot; and &quot; as no far-  
ther valid than they are authorised by  
the grants therein enumerated.&quot; It  
docs not fe-cm ppflible fa&#x27;iat any iuft objec-  
tion can lie againft either cf thefe claufes.  
The firft amounts merely to • declaration  
that the compact ought tojaaVe t&#x27;h&#x27;-&#x27; inter-  
pretation, plainly inteadeiT^y the patties

led ; and if tlie granted powers r.re valid,  
Eccaiife grantee!, all other powers, not  
granted, mutt not he valid.  
  
The refirfuiion having taken this view  
of the federal coiiip#£l, proceeds, to infer,

It appears to your committee to be a  
plain principle, founded in common fer.fe,  
illulirated by common practice, and effeii-

It adds to  
tiorr, that it  
folid fbundati  
  
{lability ol the conmtu-  
cfts on this legitimate and  
n. The itates th&#x27;en, being  
the parties to the conltitutional compact,  
and in their fovereign capacity, it follows  
of liercmty, that there can be no tribunal  
above their authority, to decide in the  
lalt refort, whether the compact made by  
them be violated ; and confequeritly that  
as the paaties to it, they muft themfelves  
decide in the laft refort, fnch cuieftions as  
mav be of fufficient magnitude to require  
their interpofition.  
  
It does not fellow, however, that be-  
caufc the ftates as fovereign parties to  
their conflitutional compact, mult ulti-  
&#x27; matelv decide whether it has been viola-  
ted^hat fuch a decifion ought to be inter-  
pWll either in^a hally m.tv.r.er, or on  
doubtful and inferior occafions. Even in  
the cafe of ordinary conventions between  
different nations, whereby the Itriel rule  
of interpretation, a breach of a part may  
be deemed a breach of the whole ; every  
part being deemed a condition cf every  
other part, and of the whole, it is always  
laid down that the breach mult be both  
wilful and material to juitify an applica-  
tion of the rule. But in the cafe of an in-  
timate and conflitutional union, like that  
of the United States, it is evident that  
th*» interpofition of the parties, in their  
fovereign capacity, can be called for by  
occafions only, deeply and effentiallv af-  
fecting tiie vital principles of their politi-  
cal fyltem.  
  
The refolution has accordingly guar-  
ded again.1 any mifaprehenlion ot, its pb-  
jeel, by cxprefslv requiring for fuch an  
ItlterpotMon &quot;the cafe of a deliberate  
palpable and dangerous breach of the con-  
ftitution, by the exercife of power not  
granted by it. It muit be a cafe, not of  
a light and tranfient nature, but of a na-  
ture dmgerous to the great purpofes for  
which the conftitution was eltabliflred.  
1ft muft be a cafe moreover not obfeure  
^doubtful in its conftrui-rion, but plain  
and palpable. Laftly it muft be a cafe  
not resulting from a partial confideratipn,  
or hafty determination ; but a cafe ftampt  
with a final confideration and deliberate  
adherence. It is not neceffitry becaufe  
&quot;the refolution does not require, that the  
queftion fliould be riifcufled, how far the  
excrcife of any particular power, ungrau-  
ted by the conftitution, would juitify the  
interpofion of the parties to it. As cafes  
might eafily he dated, which none would  
contend, ought to fill within that (&#x27;el&#x27;crip-  
tion ; cafes on the other hand, might  
  
K&#x27;l  
  
cin? them \v:thin the defctiption.  
  
But^he refolution, has done &quot;more than  
&#x27; guard Igainft mofconilruition, by exprefs-  
ly referring to cafes of a deliberate, pal-  
pable zndaar.gerous nature. It fpeci&amp;es  
the ob je &#x27;1 df the i iterpofition which it  
completes, folely to the part of arrefting  
the progicfs of the evil of ufurpation, and  
of maintaining the authorities, rights and  
liberties appertaining to the Itates, as par-  
&quot; ties to the conftitution.

&quot; i. The conftitation fuppofes that the  
prefident, the conn-eft, and each of its  
lioufes, may not tfu&#x27;c barge their trufts, ei-  
ther from defect of judgement, or other  
caufes. Hence, they are all made refpon-  
fible to their cemftituents at the returning  
periods of election, and the prefident, who  
is fmgly entrufted with very great powers,  
is, a3 a further guard, fubjeeted to an inter-  
mediate impeachment.  
  
&quot; 2. Should it happen, as the conRitu-  
tion fuppofes it may happen, that either  
jf thefe branches of the government, may  
•lot have duly difcharged its truft it is  
natural and proper, that according to  
ihe caufe and degree of their faults, they  
hould be brought into contempt or difre-  
pute, and incur the hatred of the people.  
  
3.&quot;Whetherithas, in any cafe happen-  
ed, that the proceedings of either, or all  
j( thofe branches, evinces Rich a violati-  
on of their duty as tojuflify a contempt,  
a difrepute, or hatred among the people,  
can only bedetermincd by a free examina-  
tion thereof and a free communication a-  
inong the people thereon.  
  
&quot; 4. When ever it may have actually  
happened, that proceedings of this fort  
are chajrgabte on all or either of the bran-  
ches of the government, it is the duty as  
well as right of intelligent and faithful citi-  
zens to difcufs andpromulge them freely, as  
well to controul them by the cenfortlhip  
of the public opinions, as to promote a re-  
medy according tothc rules of toe conftitu-  
tion. And it cannot be avoided, that thofe  
who apply the remedy muit feel, in fome  
degree, a contempt or hatred againft the  
tranfgreffng party.  
  
&quot; 5. As the act was paffed in July 14.  
&#x27;9S, and it is to be in force until March 3,  
1801, it was of courfe, that during its  
continuance two elections of the entire  
houfe of reprcfentatives, an election of  
two thirds of the fenate, and an election  
of a prefident, were to take place.  
  
&quot; 6. That confequentiy, duringa&#x27;l thefe  
elections, intended by the conftitution to  
prcferve the purity, or to purge the faults  
of the adminiftration, the great remedial  
rights of the people were to be cxercifed,  
and the refpbnfioility of their public a-  
gents to be (kreened, uuder the penalties  
of this act.  
  
&quot; May it not be afked of every intele-  
gent friend to the liberties of his country,  
whether the power exercifed in fuch an  
act as this, ought not to produce great and  
univerfal alarm ? whether a rigid execu-  
tion of fuch an act, in time paft, would  
not have rcpreffed that information and  
communication among the people, which  
is indifpenfible to the juft exercife of  
their electorial rights ? and whether fuch  
an act, if made perpetual, and enforced  
vvith rigour, would not, in time to come,  
•ither deftroy our free fyRem of govern-  
ment, or prepare a convullion that might  
prove equally fatal to it.&quot;

reader that Mr. Spencer was at part of the expence  
of having that pamphlet re-printed and circulated ig  
this state.* It becomes our duty, therefore, to con.  
trast its leading principles, with those by whig  
Mr. Spencer now affects to be governed.  
  
Of the freedom of the Press, the report speaks  
in the following manner :—  
* The freedom of the prefs under the  
common law, is, in the detences of the  
Sedition af, made to confift in anex.  
emption trom all previdus reftraint on  
printed publications, by perfons author.  
ized to inf{peét and prohibit them, |  
appears to the committee, that this ide  
of the treedom of the prefs, can never  
be admitted to be the American idea of  
it: fincea law infliéting penalties on  
printed publicatfons, would have a fim.  
ilar efleét with a law authorizing a pre.  
  
a mockery to fay, that no law fhould  
be pailed, preventing publications from  
being made, but that laws might be pal.

And it cannot be avoided, that tirofe  
who are to apply the remedy muft feel,  
in fome degice, a contempt or hatred  
againft the tran{greffing party.”  
  
** It is obvious, that the intent to de-  
fame or bring into contempt or difre-  
pute, or hatred, which is made a con-  
dition of the olfence created by the aét ;  
cannot prevent its pernicious influence  
on the freedom of the prefs. For omit-  
ting the enquiry, how far the malice of  
the intent is an inference of the law  
trom the mere publication, it is mani-  
feftly impoflible to punith the intent to  
bring thofe who adminifter the govern  
ment into difrepute or contempt, with-  
out ftriking at the right of treely difcuf-  
fing public charaéters and meafures :  
becaufe thofe who engage in fuch dif-  
cuflions, muft expeét and intend to ex-  
cite thefe unfavorable fentiments, fo far  
as they may be thought to be deferved.  
To prohibit therefore the intent to ex-  
cite thofe unfavourable fentiments a-  
gainft thofe who adminifter the govern-  
ment, is equivalent to a prohibition of  
the a¢tual excitement of them, is e-  
quivalent to a prohibition of difcuffions  
having that tendency and effeét ; which,  
again, is equivalent to a protection of  
thofe who adminifter the government,  
if they fhould at any time deferve the  
contempt or hatred of the people, a-  
gainit being expo&#x27;ed to it, by free ani-  
madverfions on their charaéters and con.  
dué. Nor canthere be a doubt, if  
thole in public truft be fhielded by pen.  
al laws trom fuch ftrittures of the prefs  
as may expofe them to contempt and  
difrepute, or hatred, where they may  
deferve it, that in exaét proporiion as  
they may deferveto be expofed, will be  
the certainty and criminality of the in-  
tent to expofe them, and the vigilance  
of profecuting and punifling it ; NOR

had before passed the assembly of that

the other states for their approbation,  
but which were treated with contempt  
by many. He was the chairman of a  
committee to whom those resolutions  
were referred, and upon which he made  
a laboured report the next session. In  
this report, alter much sophistry and

conclusion, that whenever it happened  
that either branch of the federal govern­  
ment might not have duly discharged its  
trusty it was natural and proper, that ac­  
cording to the cause and decree of their  
  
faults, they should be brought into con­

faults or xnolations of duty as would jus­  
tify the hatred of the people are at any  
time committed, by either branch oj Con­  
gress, or the President, can only be de­  
termined by aftce examination and com­  
munication among the people : and when  
this, in fact, should be the case, it becomes  
the duty, as well as the right of intelli­  
gent, faithful citizens, to discuss &amp; pro­  
mulgate them freely, as well to control  
them by the censor ship of public opinion,  
as to promote a remedy according to the

cannot be avoided, but those who ere to  
apply the remedy must feel a contempt

pale of the constitution. Mark what she says  
through her report of 1800 : ‘  
“ It it be liaole to objection, it must be, be­  
cause. either the object, or the means, arc object!  
enable.  
“ The object being to maint&amp;iri what the con  
stihition has ordained, is in itself u laudable ob­  
ject.  
“ The mpans are expressed in the terms “ the  
necessary and proper measures.” A proper ob­  
ject was *-.o be pursued, by means bulb necessary  
and proper. . .  
“ To find an objection then, it must be shewn  
that some meaning was annexed to.theSe general  
terms, which was not proper; aiul for this pur­  
pose, either that the means used by the General  
Assembly, were an example ot improper means,  
or that there wete ho proper means to which the  
terms could ivfer.  
&quot; In the example given by the state, of (loci i  
eing the alien and sedition acts to be it iconstituti­  
on:d, and ofeommumeutingthe declaration to the  
other slates, no trace of improper means bus ..p-&#x27;  
peared. And ifthe other states bad concurred in  
making a like declaration, supported too by the  
numerous applications flowing immediately from  
the people, it can scarcely be doubted, that these  
simple means would have been as sufficient, us  
they are unexceptionable  
“ It is no less certain, that other means migh*  
have been employed, which are strictly within  
the limits of the constitution. The legislatures of  
the states might have made a direct representuu­  
ohto Congress, with a view to obtain a rescind­  
ing of the two offensive acts ; or they might have  
represented to their respective seiuto s &#x27;in Con­  
gress, their wish, that two-thirds thereof would  
propose an explanatory amendment to the consti  
ti tion ; or two-thirds of themselves, if such had  
been iheir optiofl, might, by an application to  
congress, have obtained a Convention for the  
same object.  
“ These several means,though not equally eli­  
gible in themselves, nor probably, to the states,  
were all constitutionally open for consideration.  
And it the General Assembly, after declaring the  
&#x27; two acts to.be unconstitutional, the first aiul most  
obnous proceeding on t*ie subject, did not under­

the common defence and general welfare.”  
1 lie words in the 8th section of the “ Arti­  
cles of Confederation” from which this clause  
seems chiefly to have been copied, are to  
the same effect: •• All charges of war, and  
all other expences that shall be incurred for  
the common defence and general welfare,  
and allowed bv the U. States, in Coagress  
assembled, shall be defrayed out of a com­  
mon Treasur , &amp;c.  
‘‘This similarity, says the Report, in the  
use of these phrases in thetwog&gt; eat federal  
charters, might well be considered as ren  
dering their meaning less liable to be mis­  
construed in the latier, (the Constitution ;)  
because it will scarcely ne said, that in the  
former (Art. of Coa ) they were ever un­  
derstood to be either a general grant of pow­  
er, or to authorize the requisition or appli­  
cation of money by the old Congress to the  
common defence and genera! welfare, except  
in the cases afterwads enumerated, which  
explained and limited their meaning.  
&quot; The true and fair construction of this ex­  
pression, both in the original and existing  
federal compacts, appears to the commit­  
tee too obvious to be mistaken. In both, the  
Congress is authorised to provide money  
for the common defence St general welfare.  
—In both, is subjoined to this authority, an  
enumeration of the cases, to which their pow­  
ers shall extend. Money cannot be applied  
to the general welfcre, otherwise than by  
application of it to some particular measure,  
conducive t«» the general welfare Whene­  
ver, therefore, money has been raised by the  
general authority, and is to be applied to a  
particular measure, a question arises, whe  
ther the particular measure be within the  
enumerated authorities vested in Congress,”

f the amend­  
ment, last mentioned, the principle embra­  
ced by that amendment, was esteemed by  
all parties, as a pail of the Constitution  
its If. (k)  
If, after the explicit amendment last  
mentioned, any doubts could still exist, on  
this subject, they will be dissipated by the  
most unexception ible authorities. In the  
report to the Virg nia Legislature, before  
mentioned, for example, that body has re­  
solved (l) that ** it views the powers of  
the federal government, as resulting from  
the compact to which the States are par­  
ties ; as limited by the plain sense and in­  
tention of the instrument, constituting that  
compact; and as no further valid than  
they are authorised by the giants enumer­  
ated in that compact.” Again it is resol­  
ved, (m) that “ if the powers granted be  
valid, ii is because they are granted, and  
if the granted powers are valid, because  
graxtted, all other powers not grunt d,  
must not be valid.” It is also further re­  
  
solved, ( nJ that &quot; whenever a question a­  
risi si, concerning the constitutional ty of a  
particular power, the Mr.t question is,  
whether the power he expressed in the

There is very little scope for original  
discussion on this subject.—The powers  
of the general government have been so  
often canvassed, particularly in the able  
Report of Air. Madison on the Alien and

“ That notw ithstaudingtliis remarkable  
security against uiisconstructioii, a design  
lias Se»*n indicated to expound these phia­  
I ses in the constitution, .so as to destroy

them, must havefallen under llie observa­  
tion of those who have attended to the  
course of public transac tions. Not to  
multiply proofs on this subject, it will suf­  
fice to refer to the debates of the Federal  
legislature, in which arguments have on  
different occasions been drawn, with ap­  
parent effect, from these phrases, in their  
indefinite meaning.  
“ To these indications, might be added,  
without looking farther, the official re­  
port on manufactures by the late secreta­  
ry of the treasury, made on the othof De­  
cembe-, I7!*l ; and tin* report of a com­  
mittee of Congress in January, 17i)7, on  
tie promotion of agriculture. In the first  
of these, it i&gt; expressly contended to be­  
long ‘to the discretion of the national le­  
gislature to pronounce upon the objects  
w hich concern the general welfare, ami for  
which, under that description, an appro­  
priation of money i&gt; requisite ami proper.  
And there seems to be no room forndoubt  
that whatever concerns the general inte­  
rests of LEARNING, of AG RICL&#x27;I.Tl’itK, of  
MAM KACTL RES and of COMMERCE, are  
within rise sphere oft ho national councils,  
es far as regards e , npptic&lt;ttton oj motley —  
The latter report assumes the same lati­  
tude of power in the national councils,  
and applies it to the encouragement of ag­  
riculture, by means of a society, to f&gt;e  
established at the scat of government.—  
Although neither of these reports may  
have received the sanction ofalau earn­  
ing it into effect; yet, on the other hand,  
the extraordinary doctrine contained in  
both, has passed without the slightest  
positive mark of disapprobation from the  
authority to w hich it was addressed.  
“ Now, whether the phrases in question  
he construed to authorize every measure  
relating to thecommon defence and gen­  
eral welfare, as contended by some&quot; or  
every measure only in which there might  
be an application of money, as suggested  
by the caution of others, the effect&quot; must  
substantially be the same, in destroyin&#x27;&#x27;  
the import and force of the particular enu­  
meration of powers,which follow these ge­  
neral phrases in the Constitution. For it  
is evident that there is not usingle power  
whatever, which may not liavf\some refe­  
rence lo the common defence, or the gen­  
eral welfare j nor a power of any magni­  
tude, which, in its exercise, does not in­  
volve or admit an application of money.  
  
l ne govermirocm, uterelore, w inch pos­  
sesses power in either one or other of  
these extents, is a government without  
the limitations formed by a particular c­  
niimeration of powers ; and consequent­  
ly the meaning ami effect of tins parlicu­  
h remuneration, is destroyed by the ex­  
position given to these general phrases.  
“This conclusion will not be affected  
l»y an attempt to qualify the power over  
the “ general welfare” by referring it to  
cases where the general welfare is beyond  
the reach of separate provisions by the m­  
elividua! states—and leaving to these their  
jurisdictions in eases, to which theirsepa­  
rate provisions may lie competent. For,  
as the authority of the individual states  
must in all eases he incompetent to gener­  
al regulations operating through the  
w hole, the authority of flu; l). S. would &#x27; e  
extended to every object relating to the  
general welfare, which might, bv any pos­  
sibility, he provided for by the general  
authority, rl his qualifyingconstniction,  
t herefore, would have little, if any ten­  
(lenry, to circumscribe the power claim*  
ed under the latitude of the terms, “ gen­  
eral welfare.”  
“ &#x27;I he true and fair construction oftliis  
expression, both in tlicorigiual and exis­  
ting federal compacts, appears to thecoin­  
niiltec too obvious to lie mistaken. In  
both, the Congress is authorized to pro*  
vide money for the common defence and  
general welfare. In both, is subjoined to  
this authority, an enumeration of the ca­  
ses to which their powers shall extend.  
Money cannot lie applied to the general  
welfare, otherwise than by an application  
of it to some particular measure, condu­  
cive to the general welfare. Whenever,  
therefore, money has been raised hy the  
general authority, and is to be applied to  
a particular measure, a question arises,  
whether the particular measure he within  
the enumerated authorities vested in Con­  
gress. If it be. the money requisite for  
it, may he applied to it; if it be not, no  
such application can be made. This fair  
ami obvious interpretation &lt; uir.cuh syvith

and the 10th amendment seems conclusive on this  
head. But let us recur to-original landmarks, and  
the earliest interpretations of the nature and spirit  
of our constitutien. It eannot be believed, that there  
isaman inthe United States who will venture to as-  
sert that the constitution would have been ratified, if  
ithad been understood that congress might grant mo-  
nopolies, or deprive the states of theirright to tax  
property, except as to imports and exports. In  
every other instance, the right to tax is reserved.  
Among the reasons given by Virginia for ratifying  
the constitution, were these—  
  
“that therefore no right, of any denomination, can  
be cancelled, abridged, or restrained, or modified, by  
congress, by the senate or house of representatives,  
acting in any capacity, by the president, or any de-  
partment or oflicer of the United States, except in  
those instances where power is given by thé constitution  
for those purposes.” Vhat each state in the union  
shall respectively retain every power, jurisdiction  
and right, which it not by this constitution delegat-  
ed to the congress of the United States, or the  
departments of the federai government.” «That these  
clauses which declare that congress shall not exer-  
cise certain powers, be notinterpreted in any man-  
ner whatsoever, to extend the powers of congress

The language of this commentary on this  
part of that resolution is, “ It is indeed  
true that the term ‘ states,’ is sometimes  
used in a vague sen&lt;e, and sometimes in  
different senses, according to the subject  
to which it is applied. Thus it sometimes  
means the seperate sections of territory oc­  
cupied by the political societies within  
each ; sometimes the par.icular govern­

times those societies as organized into  
those particular governments; and lastly,  
it means the people in tbeir highest sove­

I lie Kesnliition having taken this view of  
flic federal compact, proceed* to infer, •• ilut  
incase ot a deliberate, pa - ible. amt dangerous  
exercise of other power* not granted try the  
raid compact, the stales wlioare parties i Vne­  
lo, have the right, and are in duty hound in  
interpose tor uric* ting the progress of the evil,  
and tor maintaining within their respective  
limits, the authorities, rights and liberties ap­  
pertaining to them.”  
It appears to your committee to Ire a plain  
principle, founded in ronimxi sense, illustrat­  
ed by common practice, and essential to tlie  
nature ol comparts ; that where resort can  
be had to no tribunal superior to the authori­  
ty of the parties, the parties themselves must  
be the rightful judges in the last resort, v lu­  
lh» f the bargain nude, has been pursued or  
violated. The Constitution of the United  
Hlates was tunned J»y ibe sanction ol the  
Stales, given by each in its sovereign ear- te.lv  
It adds to tbe stabiljtv and dignity, as well is  
to tbe authority of tin- Comuitmiou, tin; l  
rests on this legitimate &lt;V solid found.itmu. flip  
Mates theo being thr parlies In tlieeoostit utiont

follows of necessity, Unit there can bcootrilm­  
nal above tlic-ir authority, . decide in the last  
resort, whi ther the compact marie hv them  
tic violated ; and consequently that as Hie par­  
ties to il, (lies must themselves dec tie m ilie  
last ie*nrt, such questions as may Ire of suffici­  
ent maglti! tide to reiprire their jritdposition  
ft doej not follow, however, tout *,eeaii  
  
the. States a* sovereign psitiesto flndr consti­  
tutional compact, iHuat ultimateiv decide whe­  
ther it has been violated, that such a decision  
ought to he interposed either in a hasty man­  
ner, or on doubtful and inferior occasion*.  
Even in the ea*e of ordinary conventions  
between different nation*, where by the stiict  
rule ol interpretation, a breach of &lt;t part may  
he deemed a breach of the whole ; every part  
being deemed a condition ot every othet part,  
6c ot the whole, it is al wav » laid dotsu that the  
breach must be l&gt;oth wilful and materia! to  
justify an application ot the rule. Itut m the  
rase ot an intimate and constitutional union,  
like that of the United States, it is evident  
that the interposition of the parties, in their  
.sovereign capacity, can be called fur try occa­  
*i ii* only,deeply .mil essentially atl&#x27;crting the  
vital principles ot their political sysleui.

&#x27;&quot;&#x27;f, could be required at the present

On this objection it might be observed Jirst,  
that there may be ins inure • ot usurped |&gt;o a * r  
which the Coitus ol the Constitution would ne­  
ver draw within tin- comrcol ot the judicial  
department; secondly, that ifthe decision of  
the judicial y be raised above Mir authoiity of  
theaoveieign parties to the Constitution, the I  
decisions 01 the other ilepailments.iiotr.ii­  
ried by the forms of the Comditulitm before  
the judicial y, must In- equally aulhoritative  
and final with the decisiotbof tliat depm tment.  
lint the proper answer to the objection is. that  
the resolution of thrGeurral \s‘se • bly relates  
to those gnat and extraordinary cases, in  
who h all the forms of the Constitution may  
prove ineffectual against infrsi twins dangerous  
t&lt;&gt; the essential rightsof the parties to it. Thu  
resolution supposes that dangerous powers not  
| delegated, may not only lie usurped and exe­  
cuted by the other department*, but that the  
j in! icial dcp.11 mi cut, also in jv exercise or sanc­  
tion dangerous powers beyond the grant of  
tuir Constitution; and consequently that the  
ultimate right of the paities to the Constitu­  
tion, 10 judge whether the compact h is been  
dangerously violated, must extend to violations  
by one delegated authority, as well as hj .mo­  
ther ; by the judiciary, a* well as by the ext- |  
culive, or the legislature.  
However true therefore it may be that thu !  
judicial tnietif, i% in all qitPhtion.&#x27;i .inh- I  
mined to it by the forms of the Constitution  
to decide in the last resort, this resort must  
necessarily be deemed (lie last in relation to the  
aiithonliesof the oilier departments of the go­  
vernment ; not in relation to the rights of the  
paities to tiie Constitutional compact, from  
which the judicial as well as the ..n&gt;r depart­  
ments hold their delegated trusts. Oil any oih­  
er hypothesis, the delegation ol judicial power,  
would annul the authority delegating it ; and  
the coiicimence of this department with the  
others in usurped powers, might Mibveit for  
ever, and beyond ibe possible reach of any  
riiihtl nl remedy, the verv Constitution, w hich  
all were instituted to preserve.  
Tin truth declared in thu resolution hein«­  
established, the expediency of making the  
declaration at the present day, may safely be  
le.t to the temperate coiisideiatiun and candid  
judgment ot the American public Ii win hu

• But it s objected that the judicial authority is to  
tic regarded a# the sole cx|&gt;ositor of the constitution,

sions of the other departments, not carried by tin  
fotnts of (lie constitution before the judiciary, must h&lt;  
equally authoritative and final with the decisions o

IIIV relates to those great and extraordinary eases, i&gt;  
which all the forms of the ronstitiition may prove in­  
effectual against inlrartions dangerous to the ex-veil  
lial rights ol the parties to it. The resolution siqi|&gt;os  
es that dangerous powers not delegated, m ty not unli

that the judicial department also nmy exercise 01

J&quot; •*•• application of nioiiev, as suggested liv the can- I  
.ion ol others ; the effect mast Milistuiuially be the .  
•ante, in destroying the import and force of tin- parti­  
rulat enumeration of powers which follow these ge­  
neral pit ruses in the constitution. For it is evident  
dial there is not n single power whatever, which may  
not have some reference to the nnninioii defence, or  
lie general welfare ; nor a power of auv magnitude, .  
which, in its exercise, does not involve or nvimit an  
vppheution ol money. I lie government, therefore,  
w h iclt possesses power i n either oik; or other of these  
extents, is a.government without the limitations form- i  
ad by ;t particular cminicnilion of powers ; and con- i  
  
*&lt;i|mviiiyinc meaning and chert ot tins particular  
enumeration, is destroyed by ilm exposition given to  
ibest; general phrases.  
1 lii- conclusion will not be afTi ctcd by an attempt  
10 nlm!if&gt;’ P°&quot;&#x27; •&#x27; over the “ gc neral welfare,” by  
1 elei i mg it to cases where the general welfare is be­  
yond t he reach of separate provisions by t lie individual  
•.lair , ; and leaving to these their jurisdictions in cases  
to w hich their separate prov ision* may be competent,  
r or, as the authority of ihe individual states must in  
all cases be incompetent to general regulations opera*  
ling through the whole, the authority of the United  
.■stales would lie extended to every objert 1 dating to  
the geuiiial wcliare, which might, by any possibility,  
ba provided for by the general authority. This qua­  
lifying construction, therefore, would have little, if  
any tendency, to circiiniscribc the power claimed un­  
der the latitude ol die terms “ general welfare.&quot;  
Hie H ue nnd fair construction of this expression,  
boili ill the original and existing federal compacts,  
appears to the coniniitcc too obvious to be mistake 11.  
I n laitli, the &lt; ougress is authorised to provide inmn v  
lor the common defence and general unfair. In both  
is subjoined to this authority, an ciiutneratioii of the  
cases, to which their poweis shall extend. Money  
cannot lie applied to the general welfare, otherw ise  
than by an application of it to some particular mea­  
sure), conducive to the general welfare. Whenever,  
therefore, money has been raised by the general au­  
1 horny,&#x27; ami is to be? applied to a particular rwasurt*,  
a question arises, whether the particular measure he  
within the enumerated authorities vested in Congress.  
* !* M!».money rrcpiisito fur it, may bo applied  
*&#x27;?&#x27;? &#x27;».&#x27;! il be not, no such application can he made.  
1 his lair and obvious interpretation coincides with,  
ami[is enforced by, the danse in the constitution,  
vv»iii*li declines, 1 hat** 110 money shall be drawn from  
[ treasury, but in.consequence ot appropriations hv

servance ol this constitutional injunction.’

the United St iles into a monarchy, is a point whicl

has led to Occasional investments of power in the cx

lure of the executive trust. Iii (iropoitiou as the nh  
JeCtsof legislative.care might he multiplied, would tie  
time allowed for each be dimiuisked, and the dillir.ul  
1 ty of providing uniform and particular regulations fo

- xurily ensue a greater latitude to the agency of th.i  
t department w hich is always in existence, and whicl  
could host mould regulations of a crnrial nature, s  
as to suit tin in lo the diversity of particular situation1

in such manner as the legislature thereof mat  
diiect, a number of electors, equal to the  
whole number of senators, and representatives  
  
IO which Mil! State may be entitled in the con­

I shall in the first place endeavour to as­  
certain the meaning allixed to the words used  
in this clause, hy those who adopted the con  
stitution of the United Slates. By refe.rmg  
to the justly celebrated report of the legisla­  
tion nl Viiginia in 1300, commonly called  
Madison’s report, it will he seen ‘that the  
4 term “ states” is sometimes used in a vague  
4 sense, and sum-times in different senses, ac­  
4 ending to the subject to which it is applied.  
‘Thus it sometimes means the separate sec­  
‘tinns of territoiy occupied by the political  
‘suciety within each ; sometimes the particu­  
lar governments, established by these sneie­  
4 ties ; sometimes those societies as organized  
* *nr,[ these particular governments ; and  
4 lastly, it means the people composing these  
‘political societies in their highest sovereign  
4 capacity. Although it might he. wished that  
4 the perfection of language admitted less di­  
4 versify in-the signification of the same words,  
‘yet little inconveniency is produced by \\
4 where the tiue souse can he collveted with  
‘certainly from the different applications.*’—  
In this analysis of the word “s&#x27;ufe,” it is «or­  
thy of remark that it, no where, is used in the  
samo sense as the legislature of a state ; and  
collecting the sense, in which it is used, in the  
| clause in question, by reference to that clause,  
it is -ron, that the constitution here considers  
a stnte, as a body totally different from its  
legislature.

• to expound certain general phrases copied from the

limited their meanieg. 2. Whether this exposition  
would by degrees consulidate the states into one

this consolidation would be to Iransiorin the Kepub-

1. 1 be general phrazes here rnc-ant must be those  
“of providing for the common dcleticc and genera!

In the “articles of confederation&quot; the phrases are  
used as follows, in article VIII. “All charges of war  
and all other expenses thet shall b* incurred/or the  
common defence aiul general welfare, and allowed by  
the United States in congress assembled, shall he  
defrayed out of a oommon treasury, which sl-.all be

that iu the former they were ever uiidcrstoud to be ,  
either a general grant of power, or to authorise the ,  
reqiiisiliuii or application of money by the old con- 1  
gress to the common defence and general welfare,  
except in the cases allerw ards enumerated wliich i  
explained and limited their meaning; and if siieh was  
the limited meaning attached to these phrases in the  
very instriiineut revised and remodelled by the pre-  
sent constitution, it can never be Supposed that  
when copied into this constitiilien, a different mea-  
uiug ought to be attaohed to them  
That iiotwitlislandiiig this remarkable security  
against misconstruction a design has been indicated  
to expound these phrases in the constitution so as to  
destroy the effect of the particular enumeration of  
power by which it explains and limits them, must  
have fallen under tke observation of those who Lave  
attended to the course of puMic transactions. Not  
to multiply proofs on this subject, it will suffice to  
refer to the debates in the Federal Legislature, in  
which arguments have un different occasions been  
drawn, with apparent effect, frem these phrases in  
ttieir indefinite meaning,  
  
To these indications might be added, without loo-  
king farther, th* official report on tr tiujfactures by  
the late Secretary ofthe Treasury, made on the 6lh  
of December, 1791; and the report of a committee  
of Congress in January 1797 on the promotion of ag  
riciilture. In thefi * of^ these, it is expressly con-  
tended to belong “to the discretion of the National  
legislature to pronounce upon the objects which con-  
cern general welfare, and for which under that des-  
cription au appropriation of money is requested and  
proper And there seems to he no room for »doubl  
that whatever concerns the general .interests of  
learning, of agriculture, of manufactures, and of  
commerce, are within the sphere of the national  
council as far as regards ao applicatiou of money.”  
  
I lie latter report assumes the same latitude of pow-  
er in the national councils, and applics.it to the en-  
couragement of agriculture, by means of a society  
to he established at the seat of government. Al-  
though neither af these reports may have received  
I inosaiicuo* oi -a raw vir..,., ,-ai,  
  
the other hand, the extraordinary doctrioecontained  
in both, has passed without the slightest positive  
mark of disapprobation from the anthority to which  
it was addressed. (Congress.)  
  
Now whether tlie phrases inqiiestion be constru-  
ed to authorise every measure relating to the com-  
mon defence and general welfare, as contended by  
some,* or every measure only in which there might  
be an application of money, as suggested by the  
caution of others, f the effect must substantially be  
the same, in destroying the import and force ofthe&#x27;  
particular enumeration of powers, which follow these  
general phrases in Uie constitntion. For it is evi-  
dent that there is not a liiiglo power whatever which  
may not have some reference to the common defence  
or the general welfare; not a power of any magnitude  
which in Its exercise does not involve or admit an  
application of money. The government therefore  
which possesses power in either one or other of  
tlieso extents, is a government without the limita-  
tions funned by a particular enuinei-atioD, of powers,  
andcouseiynently the meaning and effect of tins par-  
ticular enumeration, is destroyed by the exposition  
given to these general phrases.  
  
Tins conelusion will not be effected by an attempt  
to qualify tliepower over the ‘&#x27;general welfare,” bv  
referring it to cases where the general welfare is be-  
yond the reach ot separate provisions by the individ.  
ual states; and leaving to these their jurisdiction in  
cases, to wliicli their seperate provisions may be  
competent. For as the authority of the individual  
states must in all cases be incompetent ft) general  
regulations operating tlirougli the w hole, the author  
jty ofthe United States would be exlrndcd to every  
object relating to the general welfare, which might  
by any pusihilitj be provided for by the general  
authority. This qualifying construction therefore  
would have little, if any tendency, to cirdiimscribe  
the power claimed under the latitude of the terms  
••general welfare.”  
  
The true and fair construction of this expression,  
holli if) tho original and existing federal rumpar.ts,  
appears lo the committee too obvious to be mistaken,  
lit both, the congress is authorized lo provide mon-  
ey for the com &#x27;defence and gene&#x27;al welfare. In  
both, is subjoined to this authority, an enumeration  
of the cases, to which their powers shall exleiicl*  
Money cannot he applied to the general welfare, oth-  
erwise than hy an application of it to some particu-  
lar measure conducive to the general welfare.  
Whenever therefore, money has been raised by the  
general authority, and is lo he applied tea particular  
measure, a question arises, whether the particular  
measure be within .he enmnerated aiilliorities, ves-  
ted in Congress. If it be, the money reqnisile for it  
may be applied to it; if it be not, no siicli »|#plication  
can be mads. Tliis fair and ot-vioiis interpretation  
coincides .vitb, and is enforced by the clause in the  
tonstit&#x27; (ten which declares that “no money shall he  
dra&gt; v.m the treasu.-T -iitiii coiin-.iucnce of ap-  
  
diiTe.&#x27;encc of opinion. To consolidate the stale into  
one sovereignty, nothing more can bo wanted, than  
to supercede their respective sovereignties in the  
Cases reserved to them, by extoudii g the sovereignty  
of the United States to all cases oftlie “general wel-  
fare,” that is to say, to all cases whatever.  
  
3 That tlie oDvinus tendency and inevitable result  
of a consolidation of the states into one sovereignty  
would be, to transform the republican system of the  
United States into a monarchy, is a point which  
1 seems to have been sufficiently decided by the gen-  
eral sentiment of America. In almost every inslauce  
of discussion, relating to the cuiiselidatinn in ques-  
tion, its certain tendency to pave the way lo iniuiar-  
chy, seems not to bo contested. The prospect oj-  
such a consolidation has formed the only topic of con-  
troversy. It would be unnecessary therefore, for the  
committee to dwell long on the reasons which support  
the position of the General Asseiiihly. It iiiiy not  
be improper, however, to remark two consequences  
evidently flowing from an extension of the federal  
powers to every sobjeet falling witiiin the idea of the  
“geneial welfare.”  
  
One consequence must he, to enlarge the sphere  
of discretion allotted to the executive iitagisirale.  
Even williio the legislative limits properly dcliiied hy  
tho Constitution, the difficulty of accoinniodatn g le-  
gal regulations to a country su great in extent, and  
So various in its circumstances, has been niui.h felt,  
and has l«&#x27;‘, to occasional invistments of power in the  
executive which involve perhaps as laige a portion  
ef discretion, ascan be deemed cousisicnt v-ilh the  
nature oftlic executive trust. In proportion as the  
objects of legislative care uiiglit he multiplied, would  
the time allowed foreacli be diiniiiislied, ami the dif-  
ficnlly of providing uuiforra and particular regulations  
for all., be increased. From these sources would iio-  
cessarily ensue, a greater latitude to the agency of  
that department which is always in cxistaiice, and  
which could best mould regulations of a general ua.  
tore, so as to suit them to the diversity of particular  
situations. Aud it is in this latitude, as a supplement  
to the deficiency of the laws, that the dbgreo of pre-  
■&quot;-&#x27;rt »n*ij.rially consists.  
  
&#x27;I&#x27;he other consequence would be, that of an ci-  
cessive augmentation of the otiiccs, huuoiirs and eiii.  
  
oluinents depending on the executive will. Add to  
  
the preseut Icgilim’dle flock, all those of every ues-  
criplion which a consolidation of the states would  
take from them, and turn over to the federal goveiii-  
ineut, and the patronage of the executive woiilii ne-  
cessarily be as much swelled in this case, as its pre-  
rogative would b« in the otiier.  
  
Plus dfsproportioiiatu increase of prerogative and  
patronagoiiiusl, evidently, either enaole .the ciiicf  
magistrate ofthe union, by qiiict means, lo secure  
bis re-election from time to time, aud finally, to re-  
gulate the succession as he might please; or, by giv-  
ing TO transcendant an importance to the oliicc,  
would reuderthe elections to it so riulcul and cor-  
rupt, that the public voice itself miglit call fur an  
hereditary, in place of an elective succession.  
Which ever of these events iniglit follow, the trans-  
formation of the Kepublican system of the United  
Stales into a nioiutrcliy, anticipated by the fiencral  
Assembly from a consolidation of the states into one  
sovereignty, would be equally accomplished; and  
whether it would be into a mix’d or an absolute inou-  
archy miglitdcpcnd o« too many contingencies to ad- I  
mil of any certain foresight. So far Air. Atadisun.

the highest respect,entertain to the pas­  
sage of such a law.  
The doubt on this subject arises from  
the difficulty of ascertaining the precise  
import of the term “ State,” as used in  
that clause of the constitution, which  
defines the judicial power of the na­  
tional government. Some have ima­  
gined that the word, as there used, can  
only signify such a body politic as is  
entitled to representation in the Senate:  
but Mr. Madison, who was as promi­  
nent as any one in forming the consti­  
tution, says, in his celebrated report, a­  
dopted by the Legislature of Virginia  
in 1800, that the word State “ is some­  
“ times used in a vague sense, and sonic­  
“ times in different senses, acccording  
“ to the subject to which it is applied.  
“ Thus it sometimes means the sepa­  
“rate sections of territory occupied by  
“the political society within each;  
“ sometimes the particular govern­  
“ ments established by these societies;  
“ sometimes societies as organised into  
“those particular governments; and,  
“ lastly, it means the people composing  
“ those political societies in their liigh­  
“ est sovereign capacity.”  
  
But if a construction be given to the  
term “ State,” so limited as to exclude  
from its possible signification the Dis

been indicated to expound these phrases in  
the constitution to destroy the enect of the  
particular enumeration of powers by which  
it explains and limits them, must have fallen  
under the observation of those who have at­  
tended to the; course of public transactions  
Not to multiply proofs on this subject, it .will  
suffice to refer to the debates in the Federal  
Legislature, in which arguments have on dif­  
ferent; occasions v been drawn, with apparent  
effect from these phrases in their indefinite  
meaning. &#x27;&quot; -.- ;&#x27;&#x27;&quot;.&quot;.&#x27; v&#x27; &#x27;., &#x27; &#x27; - &#x27;&#x27; &#x27;y-- .  
To these indications rftight be ailded,&#x27; with­  
out loking further, the official &#x27; report on  
manufactures , by- the late , Secretary- of the  
Treasury, made on the 5th of Dec. 1791 j  
andthe report of a committee of congress in  
J une 797t on &quot;the promotion of agriculture  
In the first oftluse. it is expressly contend­  
ed, to belong &quot;to the discretion of the Na­  
tional Legislature to pronounce lipdn the ob­  
jects which concern the general ioelfare and  
for which, under that description an appro­  
priation of money is . requisite &#x27; and projjer  
And there seems toi be no roon for a doubt  
that whatever concerns the general interests  
of&#x27; fcarhing&#x27;p &#x27; ajindturr, &#x27; oi&#x27; mamtfa&#x27;ctires  
and of commerce, are within the sphere of &#x27;the.  
national councils, as far as retrards an apph  
Vtutian of money.&#x27; .The latter report assurui-s  
the same latitude of, power in the nationa  
councils, and apnlies it to the encouragemeh  
of agriculture, by means of a society to be  
established at the seat of government. AI  
though, neither of these - reports may have  
received the sanction of a law carrying it into  
effect,&quot; vet, on the otherhand,&#x27; the extraordi  
riary doctrine contained in both, has passed  
without the slightest positive markot disap.  
probaCort from the authority to which it was  
aciuresseu. , i congress, j i i  
Now whether the phrases in question be  
construed to&#x27; authorise every Mneasure reiat  
ing to the common defence and&#x27;general wel  
fare, as contended by some ;y or every mei  
svre&#x27;onlv in which there might be an apph  
cation of money, as soggt sted by the cau  
tion&#x27; of olhersi,i: the effect must substantially  
be the samtvin destroying the import-and  
force of the; particular enumeration of pow  
ers, which follow these general phrases in  
the constitution. For it is evident that there  
is iiOfc n siiiie p vcr wuicyci, w jitii may  
not have some reference tothe common de-  
feneepr the general welfare ; ; nor a power  
of any magnitude which in its exercise does  
not irtv olve or admit an application of money.  
The government therefore which possesses  
power in either one or other ot these ex­  
tents, is a government without the limitations  
lormeu oy a panicuiar enumeration pi pow  
ers : and coniequentlv, the meaning and ef  
fect of this particular enumeration, rides  
troyed by the exposition given to these ge  
neral phrases. . .&#x27; -  
This conclusion will not be etteeted by an  
attempt to quality the power over the ge  
neral welfare, by referring, it to cases where  
the general &quot;welfare is beyond the reach of se-  
parate provisions oy xne tnatvumai stales; ana  
leaving to tnese tneir jurisuicuon in cases,  
to which their separate provisions may be  
competent. For as the authority of the in  
dividual states must in cases be &quot;incompe-  
tent to general regulations operating tnrougn  
tlie whole, the authority of the. United States  
would be extended to every object relating  
to me general wenare,, wnicn .mignt Dy any  
possibility provided for by the general au  
thority. This qualifying constniction there  
fore, would, have little, if, any tendency, to  
circumsenbe the power claimed under the  
latitude .ot the terms general weltare.r . v  
The true. and. fair construction of this ex  
pression, both in the original and existing fe  
deral compacts, appears to the committee  
trio obvious to be mistaken. In -both, the  
congress is authorised to provide&quot; money for  
the common defence and jgeneral wifare,  
In both, is subjoined to this authority, an enu­

shall, extend.&#x27; Mrineyfcahndt be applied to  
the general welfare, otherwise than by ari ap  
plication; oi it, to some particular measure  
conducive , to the&#x27; general welfare. When-  
ever,! therefore, money has been raised by  
the general authority, and is to be applied to  
a particular measure, a question arises, whe­  
ther -the particular measure be ; within the  
enumerated&#x27; authorities, vested in Congress.

Proceedings in the Virginia .Is^cmbly, paved  
in December, 17with the e &#x27;ittc of the  
committee thdCon, prc.cnted Tuesday Janu­  
ary 7, I800 *  
The other questions presenting themselves,  
are — 1 Whether indications have appeared of  
a design to expound certain genet al phrases  
copied from the *• articles of confederation,”  
so as destroy tl.e effect ol the particular en tt­  
meralion explaining and limiting their mean  
ing. 2- Whether this exposition would by  
degrees consolidate the states into one sover­  
eignty. 3 Whether the tendency and result  
I of this consolidation would he to transform the  
Republican system of the United Stale-* into  
a monai rhy  
I The general phrases here meant most he  
those “of providing for the common defence  
and general welfare.”  
In the “ articles of confederation ” the phra­  
ses arc used as follows, in article VI11 “ All  
charges of war, and all other expenecs that  
shall he incurred for the common defence and  
&quot;enei til tcc.fuie ; and allowed hy the United  
States in congicss assembled, shall hedefrayed  
out of a common treasury, which &#x27;hall be slip  
plied by the several&#x27;tales, in proportion to tlic  
value of all land within each state, granted to  
or surveyed for the person, as such land and  
the buildings and improvements thereon shall  
he estimated, according to such mode as the  
United Slates in Congtqss assembled, shall  
from time to timediiect and appoint ”  
  
In the existing constitution, they make the  
following part of section 8. The congress  
shall have power to lay and collect taxes, du  
lies, imposts ar.tl excises to pay the debts, and  
provide for the common defence and general  
welfare of the United Slates  
This sinilaiity in ihe use o&#x27;the*e phrn«cs  
in the two great federal charters, might well  
he considered, as rendering their meaning less  
liable to be misconstrued in the latter, because  
if will scarcely be said that in the former they  
were ever understood to he cither a general  
grant or power, or to authorise ihe requisition  
or application of money hy the old congress  
to the common defence and general welfare,  
except in the eases afterwards enumerated  
which explained and limited their meaning;  
and if .such was the limiter^ meaning attached  
to these phrases in the very instrument revised  
and remodeled hy the present constitution, it  
mn never he supposed that when copied into  
this constitution, a different meaning ought to  
he attached to them.  
That notwithstanding this remarkable secu­  
rity against nii«consti uction, a design has  
been indicated to expound these phrases in the  
constitution so as to destroy the effect of the  
particular enumeration of poweis bv which it  
explains and limits them, must have fa’len tin­  
dci the observation of those who have attend  
cd to the course of public transactions Not  
to multiply proofs on this subject it will suf­  
fice to refer to the debates in ihe Federal !,c  
gisla&#x27;lire, in which arguments have on differ­  
ent occasion* teen drawn, with apparent ef­  
fect. from these phrases to their indefinite  
meaning  
To these, indications might he added, with­  
out ’coking further, the official report on  
manu artures hy the late .Secretary of the  
Treasury, made on the 5th of Oec 1 ?9! ; and  
the icport of a committee of Cong&#x27;css in Jan  
179. on the promotion o&#x27;&quot; agriculture In  
the first of these, it is expressly contended to  
be’ong ‘ to the discretion o&#x27; the National f.e  
gislatnreto pronounce upon the objects which  
concern the general ive.lj&#x27;uic, and for which  
under that description, an appropriation of  
money is requisite and proper And there  
seems to be no room for a doubt that whate­  
ver concerns.the general interests of learning,  
of agi itulture, of manufacturev, and of com  
mcrcc, are. witlyn^ the sphere of the national  
councils, ax fartax regardx an application of  
money &#x27; i he latter report assumes the same  
latitude of power in the national councils, and  
applies it to the encouragement of agi {culture,  
bv means of a societvjo be established at the  
seat of government* dt\ Itbough neither of  
these reports mav have received the sanction  
of a law ca rving it into effect, yet, on the  
other hand, the extraordinary doctrine eon  
mined in both, has pa«sed without the slight  
est positive matk oi disapprobation from the  
authority to which it was.addressed. ( Ccn­  
gtexs )  
  
Now whether the phrases in question he  
construed to authorise every meastre relating  
to the common defence and general welfare,  
as contended by some ;f or every measure on  
Iv in which there might he an application of  
monev as suggested hv the caution of others.^  
the effect must substantially he the same, in  
destroying the import and force of the particu­  
lar enumeration of powers, which follow these  
general phrases in the constitution For if is  
evident that there is not a single power whate­  
ver, which mav not have 9omc reference to  
the common defence, or the general welfare;  
nor a power of any magnitude which in its  
exercise does not involve or admit any appli  
cation of money. The government thereto*c  
which possesses powei in cither one or other  
of these extents, is a government without the  
limitations formed hy a particular enumera  
lion o&#x27;&#x27;powers ; and consequently the meaning  
and effect of this particular enumeration, is  
desfroved by the exposition given to these  
general phrases  
The Conclusion will not he effected hy an  
attempt to qualify the power over the • general  
welfare.&quot; hv referring it to cases where the  
central ue/fare is beyond the reach of sepa  
rate provisions hy the individual states ; and  
leaving to these their jurisdictions in rases, to  
which their separate provision* may he com­  
petent For as the authority of the indi- kin  
al states must in all ca«es hp incompetent to  
general regulations operating through the  
whole, the authority of &#x27;he United States  
would c extended to every object relating to  
the general we&#x27;fare. which might hv anv pos  
sihili&#x27;v !&gt;e provided for hy the general authori­  
ty This qualifying construction therefore  
would have little, if any tendency, to circnm  
scribe the power c&#x27;aimed tinder the latitude of  
the rrm» &#x27;general welfare ’  
The true and fair construction of this ex  
pressinn both in the original and existing  
federal compacts, appears to the committee  
too oh\ huts to he mistaken. In both the con

authorities vested in 0&#x27; ?g*ess. |f it he, the  
inoncv requisite lor it msv he applied to it, if  
it l»c not, no &#x27;such application can be made —  
This ,air and obvious interpretation coincides  
with, nnd is enforced hv, the clause in the  
constitution which tierlaics that ‘no money  
shall he drawn from the treasury, but in con  
sequence, of appropriations by law ’ An ap.  
prop,i.ition of money to the geneial well.tre,  
would hr deemed athcra mockery than an ob­  
servance of this constitutional injunrtion  
2 Whether the exposition of the general  
phrasts here combated, would not by degicc-.  
consididatc the states into one sovereignty, I­  
a question concerning which, the committee  
can perceive li&#x27;tle room for difference of opin­  
ion. To eonso&#x27;idate the states into one sovci  
eigntv. nothing mote ran he wanted, than to  
supersede their respective sovei cignties in the  
eases rcscri cd to them, hv extending the so

result of a consolidation o1 the state* into one  
sovereignty, would he, to transfoi m the repuh  
liean system of the United Slate* into a mon

of America In almost everv irv*tanee o* dis  
eossion. relating to the console at ion in qties

monarchy, seems not *o have been contested  
The prospect of such a consolidation has  
&#x27;o mod the only topic o‘ controversy. It

!t mav not he impropev however, to remark  
t wo consequences evidently (lowing from an  
extension of the federal pa we * to every snh  
ject falling within the i&lt;iea of the “ general  
welfare ”  
One consequence must he. to enlarge the  
sphere of discretion allnt’ed to the executive  
magistrate Even within the legislative lim­  
its propoily defined hv the Constitution. the  
difficulty of accommodating legal regulations  
to a country so gt cat in extent. and so various  
in ;ts circumstances, hat- v&gt;een much felt; and  
has led to occasional investments of power in  
the executive which involve perhaps a&lt; large  
a portion of di&#x27;crelioB, n« ran he deemed eon  
sislent with the nature of the executive trust  
In proportion a* the objects of legislative care  
might he multiplied, would the lime allowed  
fur each I e diminished, and the difficulty of  
providing unifni m and particular icgu&#x27;ation*  
for all, fie. increased From these *ontces  
would necessarily ensue, a greate latitude to  
• he agency of that department which i« al­  
ways in existence, and which could best  
mould i emulations of a gene*a’, natme. so a*  
to soil the rn to the diveivit v of partic ular v:tu

those of everv description which a consolida­

patronage of the executive would necessatily

the elections to it so violent anti corrupt, that  
the public voice itself might call for an heictli

and from which, I must be indulged in making the  
following extracts. “ Whether the phrases in ques­  
tion, (mem ing the words •• to provide for the com­  
mon defence and general welfare”) be construed  
to authoriso every measure telating to the common  
defence. » general welfare, as contended by some ; |  
or every measure only in which there might be an  
application of money as s iggested by the caution  
of others, the effect must substantially be the same,  
in destroying the import and force of the phrases in  
the Constitution. Korit is evident that there is not  
a -ingle power yvhatever, which may not have some  
reference to common defence, and general wel­  
fare ; nor a power of any magnitude, which m ns  
exercise, does nut involve or admit an application  
ot money. The government therefore which pos­  
sesses power in cither one, or other, of these ex­  
tents, is a government without the limitations form­  
ed bv a particular enumeration of powers ; and con­  
sequently the meaning ami effect of thi- particular  
enumeration, is destroyed by the exposition given  
to these general phrases.” “ The true and fair  
construction of this expression both in the original,  
and existing federal compacts appears to the com­  
mittee too obvious to be mistaken. In both, the  
Congress is uuthori-ed to provide money for the  
common defence and general welfare. In boffi, is  
subjoined to this authority an enumeration of the  
cases, to which tl*eir power shall ax cud. Money  
cannot le applied toth&#x27;e general welfare, otherwise  
thm by an application of it to same particular  
measure cond isive to the general welfare. When­  
ever 1 hereforc money has been applied to a particu­  
lar measure, a question arrises, whether the particu­  
lar measure, be within &#x27;he enumerated authorities  
vested in Congress. If it be, the money requisi’e  
for it, may be applied to it ; if it be not, no such  
application can be made. This fjir and obvious  
  
j clause in the Constitution hich declares that “ J\&#x27;o  
money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in  
&#x27; consequence of appropriations by law.&quot; An ap­

tigation ot the constitutions ot tiie states, as also  
ol Ute articles of confederation, and of the Consti­  
tution of the United Sla&#x27;.es, that the power to make  
an appointment, a choice or an election, and the  
power to direct the manner of this appointment are,  
by the practical statesmen of America, considered  
as powers “ substantive and distinct.”  
&quot; This similarity in the use of liic-e phrases in  
the two great federal charters, might well be con­  
sidered as rendering their meaning less liable to be  
misconstrued in the latter; because it will scarcely  
be said, thet they were ever understood to be either  
a general grant of power” [US-I to the stale legis­  
latures to choose, elect, or appoint delegates to  
the eld congress, or to vest in the legisl atuies the  
still more dangerous and formidable power of desig­  
nating those who should elect them for &quot;each  
member of the Union.” “ And if such was the  
limited meaning attaclicd to these phrases in the  
very instrument revised and ictnodcllid by tire pie­  
sent constitution, it can never tie supposed, that  
when copied into this constitution a diderent mean­

‘¢ The other questions presenting themseives, are—1. Whether  
indications have appeared of a design to expound certain general  
phrases copied from the articles of confederation, so as to destroy  
the effect of the particular enumeration explaining and limiting their  
meaning. 2. Whether this exposition would by degrees consoli-  
date the states into one sovereignty. 3. Whether the tendency  
and result of this consolidation would be to transform the republi-  
can system of the United States into a monarchy.  
  
. “]T,The general phrases here meant must be those ‘ of providing  
for the common defence and general welfare.’  
  
‘¢ In the ‘ articles of confederation’ the phrases are used as fol-  
lows, in article vin.: ‘ All charges of war and all other expenses  
that shall be incurred for the common defence and general welfare,  
and allowed by the United States in congress assembled, shall be de-  
frayed out of a common treasury, which shall be supplied by the  
several states, in proportion to the value of all land within each state  
granted to or surveyed for any person, as such land and the build-  
ings andimprovements thereon shall be estimated, according to such  
mode as the United States in congress assembled shall from time  
to time direct and appoint.’ .  
  
  
  
  
  
CONSTITUTIONAL INTERPRETATION. 267  
  
‘¢ In the existing constitution they make the following part of sec-  
tion 8 :—  
  
‘«¢ The congress shall have power to Jay and collect taxes, duties,  
imposts, and excises ; to pay the debts and provide for the common  
defence and general welfare of the United States.  
  
‘¢ This similarity in the use of these phrases in the two great fe-  
deral charters, might well be considered, as rendering their mean-  
ing less liable to be misconstrued in the latter; because it will  
scarcely be said that in the former, they were ever understood to  
be either a general grant of power or to authorize the requisition  
or application of money by the old congress, to the common de-  
fence and general welfare, except in the cases afterwards enume-  
rated, which explained and limited their meaning; and if such was  
the limited meaning attached to these phrases in the very instru-  
ment revised and remodelled by the present constitution, it can  
never be supposed that when copied into this constitution, a differ-  
ent meaning ought to be attached to them.  
  
‘¢ That notwithstanding this remarkable security against miscon-  
struction, a design has been indicated to expound these phrases in  
the constitution, so as to destroy the effect of the particular enume-  
ration of powers by which it ordains and limits them, must have  
fallen under the observation of those who have attended to the  
course of public transactions. Not to multiply proofs on this sub-  
ject, it will suffice to refer to the debates in the federal legislature,  
in which arguments have on different occasions been drawn, with  
apparent effect, from these phrases in their indefinite meaning.  
  
‘‘To these indications might be added, without looking farther,  
the official report on manufactures, by the late secretary of the trea-  
sury, made on the 5th of December, 1791; and the report of a  
committee of congress in January, 1797, on the promotion of agri-  
culture. In the first of these it is expressly contended to belong  
‘to the discretion of the national legislature to pronounce upon the  
objects which concern the general welfare, and for which, under  
that description, an appropriation of money is requisite and proper.  
Andthereseems to be no room for adoubt, that whatever concerns the  
general interests of learning, of agriculture, of manufactures, and of  
commerce, are within the sphere of the national councils, as far as  
regards an application of money.’ The latter report assumes the  
same latitude of power in the national councils, and applies it to the  
encouragement of agriculture by means of a society to be establish-  
ed at the seat of government. Although neither of these reports  
may have received the sanction of a law carrying it into effect, yet  
on the other hand, the extraordinary doctrine contained in both has  
passed without the slightest positive mark of disapprobation from  
the authority to which it was addressed.  
  
‘¢ Now whether the phrases in question be construed to autho-  
rize every measure relating to the common defence and general  
welfare, as contended by some; or every measure only in which  
there might be an application of money, as suggested by the caution  
of others, the effect must substantially be the same, in destroying  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
268 CONSTITUTIONAL INTERPRETATION.  
  
the import and force of the particular enumeration of powers  
which follow these general phrases in the constitution. For it js  
evident that there is not a single power whatever, which may not  
have some reference to the common defence or the general wel-  
fare; nor a power of any magnitude which in its exercise does not  
involve or admit an application of money. The government there-  
fore which possesses power in either one or other of these extents,  
is a government without the limitations formed by a particular enu-  
meration of powers; and consequently the meaning and effect of  
this particular enumeration is destroyed by the exposition given to  
these. general phrases.  
  
‘* This conclusion will not be affected by an attempt to qualify the  
power over the ‘ general welfare,’ by referring it to cases where  
the general welfare is beyond the reach of separate provisions by  
the zndividual states ; and leaving to these their jurisdictions in cases  
to which their separate provisions may be competent. - For as the  
authority of the individual states must in all cases be incompetent to  
general regulations operating through the whole, the authority of  
the United States would be extended to every object relating to  
the general welfare, which might by any possibility be provided for  
by the general authority. This qualifying construction, therefore,  
would have little, if any, tendency to circumscribe the power claim-  
ed under the latitude of the terms ‘ general welfare.’  
  
‘¢ The true and fair construction of this expression, both in the  
original and existing federal compacts, appears to the committee too  
obvious to be mistaken. In both, the congress is authorized to  
provide money for the common defence and general welfare. In  
both is subjoined to this authority, an enumeration of the cases to  
which their powers shall extend. Money cannot be applied to the  
general welfare, otherwise than by an application of it to some par-  
ticular measure ‘conducive to the general welfare. Whenever  
therefore money has been raised by the general authority, and is  
to be applied to a particular measure, a question arises, whether  
the particular measure be within the enumerated authorities vested  
incongress. If it be, the money requisite for it may be applied to  
it; if it be not, no such application can be made. This fair and ob-  
vious interpretation coincides with, and is enforced by the clause  
in the constitution which declares that ‘no money shall be drawn  
from the treasury, but in consequence of appropriations by law.’  
An appropriation of money to the general welfare would be es-  
teemed rather a mockery than an observance of this constitutional  
injunction.  
  
‘¢2, Whether the exposition of the general phrases here combated  
would not by degrees consolidate the states into one sovereignty, is  
a question concerning which the committee can perceive little room  
for difference of opinion. ‘To consolidate the states into one so-  
vereignty, nothing more can be wanted, than to supersede their  
respective sovereignties in the cases reserved to them, by extend-  
ing the sovereignty of the United States to all cases of the ‘ gene-  
ral welfare,’ that is to say, to all cases whatever.

‘&lt;&lt; 3, That the obvious tendency and inevitable result of a consoli-  
dation of the states into one sovereignty would be to transform the  
republican system of the United States into a monarchy, 1s a point  
which seems to have been sufficiently decided by the general senti-  
ment of America. In almost every instance of discussion, relating  
to the consolidation in question, its certain tendency to pave the  
way to monarchy, seems not to have been. contested. The pros-  
pect of such a consolidation has formed the only topic of controver-  
sy. It would be unnecessary, therefore, for the committee to dwell  
long on the reasons which support the position of the general as-  
sembly. It may not be improper however to remark two conse-  
quences evidently flowing from an extension of the federal pow-  
: a to every subject falling within the idea of the ‘ general wel-  
fare.’  
  
‘* One consequence must be to enlarge the sphere of discretion  
allotted to the executive magistrate. Even within the legislative  
limits properly defined by the constitution, the difficulty of accom-  
modating legal regulations to a country so great in extent and so  
various in its circumstances, has been much felt ; and has led to oc-  
casional investments of power in the executive which involve per-  
haps as large a portion of discretion as can be deemed consistent  
with the nature of the executive trust. In proportion as the ob-  
jects of legislative care might be multiplied, would the time allow-  
ed for each be diminished and the difficulty of providing uniform  
and particular regulations for all be increased. From these sources  
would necessarily ensue a greater latitude to the agency of that de-  
partment which is always in existence, and which would best moyld  
  
  
  
regulations of a general nature so as to suit them to the diversityzof «...  
  
particular situations. And it is in this latitude as a supplement to, +.  
the deficiency of the laws, that the degree of executive prer ae  
materially consists. ees  
  
‘* The other consequence would be, that of an excessive’  
tation of the offices, honours, and emoluments depenthn  
executive will. Add to the present legitimate stock,ath  
every description which a consolidation of the statésewe  
from them and turn over to the federal government, and the pa-  
tronage of the executive would necessarily be as‘miuch swelled in  
this case as its prerogative would be in the other.  
  
*‘ This disproportionate increase of the prerogative and patron-  
age must evidently either enable the chief magistrate of the union,  
by quiet means, to secure his re-election from time to time, and  
finally to regulate the succession as he might please ; or by giving  
so transcendent an importance to the office, would render the election  
to it so violent and corrupt that the public voice itself might call for  
an hereditary in place of an elective succession. Whichever of  
these events might follow the transformation of the republican sys-  
tem of the United States into a monarchy, anticipated by the gene-  
ral assembly from a consolidation of the states into one sovereignty,

would be equally accomplished ; and whether it would be into a  
mixtor an absolute monarchy, might depend on too many contip-  
gencies to admit of any certain foresight.” p. 10—14.  
  
The argument of all this part of the report, consists merely  
of this idea: that if the clause “to provide for the common  
‘¢defence and general welfare’’ be construed according to the  
plain and natural import of the terms, it destroys the effec

for the common defence, and general welfare’) be construed to autho-  
rize every measure relating to the common defence, and general welfare,  
as contended by some; or every measure only in which there might be an  
application of money, as suggested by the caution of others, the effect  
must substantially be the same, in destroying the import and force of the  
phrases in the Constitution. For it is evident that there is not a single  
power whatever, which may not have some reference to the common de-  
fence, and general welfare; nor a power of any magnitude, which in its ex-  
ercise, does not invoke or admit an application of money. ‘The government  
therefore which possesses power in either one, or the other, of these ex-  
tents, isa government without the limitations formed by a particular enumera-  
tion of powers; and consequently the meaning and effect of this particular enu-  
meration, is destroyed by the exposition given to these general phrases.’—  
‘The true and fair construction of this expression, both in the original and  
existing federal compacts, appears to the Committee, too obvious to be mis-  
taken. In both, the Congress is authorized to provide money for the com-  
mon defence, and general welfare. In both, is subjoined to this authority  
an enumeration of the cases, to which their power shall extend. Money

cannot be applied to the general welfare, otherwise than by an application  
of it to some particular measure, conducive to the general welfare. When-  
ever therefore money has been applied to a particular measure, a question  
arises, whether the particular measure be with.n the enumerated authorities  
vested in Congress. If it be, the money requisite for it, may be applied to  
it; if it be not, no such application can be made. This fair and obvious in-  
terpretation coincides with, and is enforced by the clause in the Constitu-  
tion, which declares that ‘No money shall be drawn from the Treasury bit  
in consequence of appropriations by law.’ An appropriation of money to the  
general welfare, would be deemed rather a mockery than an observance of  
this constitutional injunction.’  
  
“And after showing that a different exposition of those phrases, would  
inevitably transform our federal compact into one great consolidated gov-  
ernment, the Committee further say: ‘That the obvious tendency, and in-  
evitable result of a consolidation would be, to transform the republican sys-  
tem of the United States into a monarchy, is a point which seems to have  
been sufficiently decided by the general sentiment of America.’

Resolved, That the general assembly of Virginia doth  
unequivocally express a firm resolution to maintain and  
defend the constitution of the United States, and the con-  
stitution of this state, against every aggression, either  
foreign or domestic; that they will support the govern-  
ment of the United Statés in all measures warranted by  
the former; and that this assembly most solemnly declaré  
a warm attachment to the union ba the states, to main-  
tain which, it pledges all its powers... ,

mate and constitutional union, like that of the United  
States, the interposition of the parties in their sovereign  
capacity can be called for, by oceasions only, deeply and  
essentially affecting the vital principles of their political  
system—such an interposition can only be required, in  
the case of a deliberate, palpable and dangerous breach  
of the constitution, by the exercise of powers not  
granted by it. It must be a case not of a light and  
transient nature, but of a nature dangerous to the great  
purposes for which the constitution was established. It  
must be a case moreover, not obseure or doubtful in its  
construction, but plain and palpable. Lastly, it must be  
a casc, not resulting from a paral consideration, or hasty  
determination, but a ease stamped with a final considera-

“‘ Whether the phrases in question be construed to authorise every  
measure relating to the common defence or general welfare, as con-  
tended by some, or every measure only, in which there might be an  
application of money, as suggested by others, the effect must substantially  
be the same, in destroying the import and force of the phrases in the  
Constitution. For it is evident, that there is not a single power what-  
ever, which may not have some reference to the common defence and  
general welfare ; nor a power of any magnitude, which in its exercise,  
does not invoke or admit an application of money. The Government,  
therefore, which possesses power, in either one or the other of these  
extents, is a Government without the limitations formed by a particular  
enumeration of powers, and, consequently, the meaning and effect of  
this particular enumeration is destroyed by the exposition given to these  
general phrases. The true and fair construction of this expression,  
both in the original and existing federal compacts, appears to the com-  
mittee too obvious to be mistaken: In both, the Congress is authorised  
to provide money for the common defenee and general welfare. In both,  
is subjoined to this authority, an enumeration of the cases to which thei,  
power shall extend. Money cannot be applied to the general welfare.  
otherwise than by an application of it, to some particular measure con-  
ducive to the general welfare. Whenever, therefore, money has been  
applied to a particular measure, a question arises, whether the particular  
measure be within the enumerated authorities vested in Congress. If  
it be, the money requisite for it, may be applied to it. If it be not, no  
such application can be made. This fair and obvious interpretation  
coincides with, and is enforced by the clause in the Constitution, which  
declares ‘that no money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in con-  
sequence of appropriations by law.’ An appropriation of money to the  
general welfare, would be deemed rather a mockery, than an observance  
of this constitutional injunction.”

“ &#x27;*»*» similarity in the use 0f these phrases in  
the two great Federal charters, might well he  
considered as rendering their meaning less liable to  
be miscontrued in the latter, because it will scarce­  
ly be said, that in the former they were ever un­  
derstood to be cither a general grant of power, or  
to authorize the requisition or application of money  
by tbn old Congress to the common defence and  
general welfare, except in the eases afterwards e­  
numerated, which explained and limited their  
meaning; and if such was the limited meaning at  
Inched to these phrases in the very instrument,  
revised and re-modelled by the present Constitu­

to he attached to them.” Yet it is by such flip­

&quot; nnxc-.i monarchy.&quot; •• For, one consccuence  
iuust be, to enlarge the sphere of discretion  
alloited to the Executive Magistrate. Even  
within the Legislative limits properly defined by  
the Constitution, the difficulty of accommodating  
egal regulations to a country so great in extent,  
and so various in its circumstances, has been much  
tell; and has led to occasional investments of pow­  
er m the Executive, which involve perhaps as  
largo a portion of discretion, as can he deemed  
consistent with the nature of the Executive trust.  
In proportion as the objects of Legislative care  
•night he multiplied, would the time allowed for  
each he diminished, and the difficulty of provid­

as tosvit them tothe diversity of particular sittia­  
tons. And it is in this latitude, as a supplement  
to the deficiency of tlio laws, that the degree of  
Executive prerogative materially consists.  
  
‘ r!ie olfler consequence would be, that of an  
excessive augmentation of the otlices, honors and  
emoluments depending on the Executive will.—  
Ailil to the present legitimate stock, all those of o­

would take from them, aud turn over to the Fed­

his disproportionate increase of prerogative

Chief Magistrate of the Union, by quiet means  
to secure bis re-election from time to time, and fi.

to the office, would render the elections to it •*&gt;

I “ The resolution, having taken this view of the  
I Federal compact, proceeds to infer, ‘ that, in case i  
I of a deliberate, palpable and dangerous exercise ot  
other powers, not granted by the -aid compact, the  
State*, wh&lt;* are parties tdiereto, have the right and  
j are in duty IhiuiiiI to interpose lor arresting the  
progress of the evil, and lor maintaining within  
| their respective limits, the authorities, rights and  
j liberties appertaining to them.*  
  
It appears to your committee to lie a plain i  
principle, founded in common souse, illustrated by  
common practice, and essential to tlie nature of!  
compacts; i liar, where resort can b&lt;- iiad.to no tri­  
bunal, superior to the authority ot the parties, the  
parties themselves must be the rightful judges in  
flic last resort, whether the barguiu made has been  
pursued or violated. The Constitution of the U­  
nited States was funned by the sanction ol the  
States, given by each in its sovereign capacity. It  
ailds to tlie stability and dignity, as well as to the  
authority ol the Constitution, that it rests on this  
legitimate and solid foundation. The Stales then,  
being tlie parties of the con-titulional compact, and  
in their sovereign rapacity.it follows ol necessity,  
that there can be no tribunal above that authority,  
to decide in tlie last resort, whether the compact  
made by them be violated; and, consequently,  
that, as the parties to it, they must themselves de­  
cide, in tlie last resort, such questions as may be j  
ol siitiicieut magnitude to require their interposi­  
| lion.  
  
“It does not follow, however, that because the  
Stales, as sovereign parties to iheii Constitutional &#x27;  
compact, must ultimately decide whether n has  
been violated, that such a decision ought to be in­  
terposed, either iu a hasty manuei, or on doubtful  
and inferior occasions—Kven in the case of ordi­  
nary Conventions between different nation?,wher**,  
;•&gt; lit. strict title ol interpretation a breach of a  
par may he deemed a breach of the whole; every  
pait being deemed a condition ol every other part,  
ami ol the whole.it is always laid down that the  
breach must he both wilful and material, to justify  
an application ol the rule—But iu the case of an  
intimate ami Constitutional Union, like that ol the  
I United Stales, it is evident, that tile interposition of  
| the parties, in their sovereign capacity, can be  
called lor tiy occasions only, deeply and essenti­  
ally di. cling the principles of their political .sys­  
tem.  
“ I lie resolution lias accordingly guarded a­  
gainst any misapprehension of its object, by ex­  
pressly requiring lor such an interposition, the  
case ol a deliberate, palpable ft dangerous lire &gt;rh  
ot the Constitution, by the exercise of powers not  
giauted by it. it must be a case not ol a hglu  
and transient rxttuie, but Of a nature dangerous  
to the r&gt;**i&gt;«sc.s lor which the Constitution  
was established. It must tie a ease, moreover,  
notjnhsctire or doubtful in its construction,hut plain  
and palpable. Lastly, it must lie a case not re  
suiting from a partial r .nsideration, or hasty do  
termination; but a case stamp! with a final consid­  
eration ti deliberate adherence. It i« not necessary,  
because the resolution tin—• not icquire, that the  
question shoul-J •’« msettssed; bow far the exercise  
of particular power nugranted by the Consti­  
tution, would justify rhe interposition of the parties  
toil. As cases might easily he stated, which none  
would contend ought lofall within that description;  
cases on the other ham), might, with equal ease  
he staled so llagraut and so fatal, as to&#x27;unite every  
opinion iu placing them within the description.  
“But the. resolution has done more than guard  
against misconstruction, by expressly referring to  
cases ol a deliberate, palpable &amp;. dangerous nature.  
It specifies the object of the interposition which it  
contemplates, to be solely that ol arresting the pro- 1  
gress of the evil of usurpation, and of maintaining  
the authorities, lights, and liberties appertaining  
to the States, as parties to the Constitution.  
“I*rom this view of the resolution, it would seem  
inconceivable that it can incur any just disapproba­  
tion from those, who, laying aside all inomeiilary  
impressiotis, and recollecting the genuine source ix.  
object ol the Federal Coustitufion, shall candidly  
and accurately interpret the meaning of the Gen­  
eral Assembly. — It the deliberate exercise of dan­  
gerous powers, palpably withheld by the Constitu- &#x27;  
tion, could not justify the parties to it, in interpos­  
ing even so far as to arrest the progress of the evil,  
and thereby to preserve the Constitution itself, as I  
well as to pnn-ido for the safety of the parties i  
.... .v would be an end to all relief iiom u- 1  
surped power, and a direct subversion of the rights i  
specihcd or recognized under all t^e 3t«t„ rousij. j  
(ions, as well as a plain denial of the fundamental  
principles oa which our independence itself was  
declared.  
“But it is objected, that the Judicial authority is  
to lie regarded as the solo exposition of the Consti­  
tution, in the last resort; and it may be asked for  
what reason, the declaration by the Gen’l Assem­  
bly, supposing it to lie theoretically true, could lie  
required at the present day, and in so solemn a man­  
ner.  
  
“ On this objection it might be observed, first,  
that there may be instances of usurped power,&#x27;  
whirh the forma of the Constitution would never  
•raw within the control of the Judicial department:  
secondly, that if the decision of the Judiciary be  
raided above the authority of the sovereign parties  
to the Constitution, the decisions of the other do­  
departrnents, not carried by the forms of the Con  
stitution before the Judiciary, must be equally  
Authoritative and final with the decision* of that  
department. Hut the proper answer to the objec­  
tion is, that the resolution of the General Assembly  
relates to thoso great and extraordinary rases in  
which all the forms of the Constitution may prove  
ineffectual against infractions dangerous to the  
essential rights ol the parties to it. The resolution  
supposes that dangerous powers, not delegated,  
may not only bo usurped and executed by the o’  
flier departments, but that the Judicial Depart­  
ment also may exercise or sanction dangerous  
powers beyond the grant of the Constitution; and  
consequently, that tho ultimate right of the par­  
ties to the Constitution, to judge whether the  
compact has been dangerously violated, must ex­  
tend to violations by one delegated authority, as  
well as by another; by the Judiciary, as well as by  
the Executive, or the Legislature. 7  
*&#x27; true, therefore, it may bo that the  
Judicial department, i* in all question* AtiiurriMcd  
to it by the forms of dm Constitution, to decide iu !  
tin; last resort, this resort must necessarily be  
deemed the last in relation to the authorities of  
the other departments of the Government; not in  
relation fo the rights of the parties to the Consti­  
tutional compact, from which the Judicial as well  
as tho other departments hold their delegated  
trusts.—On any other hypothesis, the delegation  
of Judicial power would annul the authority del­  
egating it; and the concurrence of this department  
with the others in usurped powers, might subvert. I  
forever, and beyond the possible reach of any  
rightful remedy, the very Constitution, which all  
were instituted to preserve.”

•• In the example gicen by the State, ol d. clar- I  
ing the Alien and Sedition Acts to be unconstitu-I  
rional, and of communicating the declaration to  
the other States, no trace of impiopor means has  
•appeared. And ii the other Slates nad concurred in  
making a like declai ation,supported too hy the nu­  
merous applications flowing immediately horn Un­  
people, it can scarcely he doubted, that these situ  
plo means would have been as sufficient, as they  
are un’ xceptionable.  
« It is no less certain that other means might  
lave been employed, which ate strictl\ witliiu the  
limits of the Constitution. The Legislatures ol  
the States might have made a direct representa­  
tion to Congress, with a view to obtain u rescind­  
ing of the two offensive acts; or, they might hav*  
represented to their respective Senators in Con  
gross, their wish, that two-thirds thereol would  
propose an explanatory amendment to the Consti­  
tution: or two thirds of themselves if such had  
been their op&#x27;iou, might, by an apj licatioji to Cou  
gross, have obtained a Convention for the same  
object.  
  
r nesc several means, though not equally eli­  
gible in themselves, nor probably, to the Suites,  
were all constitutionally open for ronddciation.  
And if tbe Geneial Assembly, after declaring the  
two acts to be unconstitutional, the first and  
most obvious proceeding on the subject, did not  
undertake to point out to the other States a choice  
among the farther measures that might become  
necessary and proper, the teserve will not be inis  
construed by liberal minds into any culpable im­

doctrine, repudiated by the Republicans, and ex­  
posed in all its deforini&#x27;y, by the Report of 1799  
drawn by Mr Madi-on himself.  
It had been contended, that the Alien Act was  
unconstitutional, because the removal pf A liens  
violated (h&lt;- 9th sec. of the 1st art. Con. U. S_  
To this objection it had been an-wered, that “as  
the Constitution had given no power to the States,  
to remove Aliens during the period between the’  
adoption ol the Constitution and 1308,^in the mean  
lime, on the construction assumed, thero would b  
no authority in the country, to send away dange­  
gerous Aliens, which could r.ot be admitted.”  
To this answer to the objec.tion to the Alien  
Law, Mr. Madison, in the Report, replies, that  
the reasoning in this answer would not, in any  
view, be conclusive; because, there are [lowers

any portion of their rights, enjoyed before the a­  
doption of the Constitution of the U. S. by impli­  
cation, or without implication even,under pretence  
that otherwise the government of the U. S. could  
not promote the public happiness or the general  
welfare, U to go as far as the most heated parti­  
zans of the elder Mr. Adams would ever have  
gone in the worst of times.  
The true rule by which to test the powers of  
the Federal branch, is that which Mr. Madison  
laid down in his memorable report—“Whenever  
a question arises concerning the constitutionality  
of a particular power, the first question is, whether  
the power be expressed in the Constitution, if it  
be, the question is decided. If it be not express­  
ed, the next enquiry must be, is it properly an  
incident to an express power, and necessary to its  
execution. If it he, it may be exercised by Con­  
gress. If it be not. Congress cannot exercise it.“  
All who enquire into the powers of Congress, and  
govern themselves by this plain, simple and obvi­  
ous rule, will, w ithout doubt, arrive at the truth.  
But, if this just rule be laid aside, and we are to  
enquire, Do the States possess the power; and if

upon the solo ground of its unconstituticnality_  
His speeches in the Virginia Convention—and  
others might have been included in the list.—The  
writer thinks, it would be an act of injustice, both  
to the public and Mr. M , to stop here, and con­  
tent himself with these general references.—To  
&#x27;void such an imputation, and to do justice to both,  
the writer will present Mr. M’s principles and  
rules of interpretation in his own words—extract­  
&#x27;d from his Report of January 1800, against the  
Alien and Sedition Acts:—  
“ The ether questions presenting themselves,  
ire—1- W hether indications have appeared of a  
iesign to expon id certain ^ene-il phrases copied  
; oin !»u *4 Article of Conn-deration,’&#x27; a* lode­  
itroy the effect ol the particular enumeration ex­  
jlaining and limiting their meaning. 2 Whether  
his exposition would by degrees consolid.de the  
Rates into one sovereignty. 8 Whether the ten­  
ancy and result of (his consolidation would be to  
ransform the republican system of the Uuited  
States into a monarchy.  
“ 1 The general phrase* here meant must be  
hrwe “ of providing lor the common defence and  
general welfare.”  
44 In the 44 Articles of Confederation,” the phra  
tes are used a* follows, in art. VIII: 44 All char­  
ts of war, and all othi r expenses that shall he  
ncurred for the common defence and general  
welfare, ami allowed by the United S ate* in Con  
;rcss assembled, shall be defrayed out of a common  
reasury, which shall be supplied by the several  
Rates, in proportion to the value of all land wi-hin  
iscli State, granted to, or surveyed for any peifon,  
n such land and the buildings and improvement*  
hereon shall bo e*(imated, according to such mode  
s the United State* in Congress assembled, shall  
rotn time to time direct and appoint.”  
44 In the existing Constitution, they make the  
ollowing part of Sec. 8: 44 The Coogrcss shall  
uve power, to lay and collect taxes, duties, im­  
ostsand excises to pay the debts, and provide for  
he common defence and general welfare of (he  
Jnited States.”  
44 fhi« similarity in the use of these phrases in  
ho two great Federal charters, might well be  
onsidered, a* rendering their meaning less liable  
o be misconstrued in the latter: because it will  
carccly be faid, that in the former, they were ov­  
ii understood to be either a general grant of pow­  
r,or to authorise the requisition nr application of  
rroney by the old Congress to the common defence  
nd general welfare, except in the cases afer­  
rards enumerated, which explained and limited  
heir meaning; and if such was the limit &lt;1 m i-n­  
ng attached to these phiasesin the very in*lru­  
rrent revised and re-modelled by the pre-ent Con­  
titufion, it can never be supposed that when co«  
tied into this Constitution, a different meaning  
night to be attached to them.  
44 I hat, notwithstanding this remarkable scent i­  
y against misconstruction, a design has been inrfi  
ated to expound these phrascuiu the Constitution,  
o as to do-troy the effect of the particular en«­  
ueration i f powets by which R explain-and limi •  
hem, must have fa&#x27;lrn under the observation of  
haso wha have attended to tbe course of public  
  
transaction*. Not to multiply proofs on Uus sub.  
Ject, It will suffice to rsfer to the Debates of the  
Federal Legislature, in which arguments hare on  
different occasions been drawn, with apparent ef.  
lect, from these phrases, in their indefinite mean,  
mg.  
•* To these indications might be added, without  
looking farther, the official Report on Manufac­  
tures, by the laic Secretary of the Treasury  
made on the 5th of December, 1791; and the Re-’  
port of a Committee of Congress, in January 1797*  
on the promotion of Agriculture. In the first of  
these it is expressly contended to belong •• to the  
discretion ol the National Legislature to pro­  
nounee upon the objects which concern the gene­  
ral welfare, and for which, under that description,  
an appropriation of money is requisite ar.d proper.  
And there seems to be no room for a doubt, that  
whatever concerns the general interests of  
LEAHNISO, Ol AORICVLTUai, of MANl&#x27;fAC&#x27;  
TURKS, and ol commerce, ere within the sphere  
ol the National Councils, as far as regards an  
application of money.&quot; The Utter Report as­  
sumes (he same latitude of power in the National  
Councils, and applies it to the encouragement of  
Agticuiture, by mcansot a society to be estabiish­  
ed at the scat of government. Although neither  
ol these reports may have received the sanction of  
r “ iQto effocti °Q the other  
band, the extraordinary doctrine contained in both,  
has passed without the slightest positive mark of  
disapprobation from the authority to which it waa  
addressed.  
  
“ whether the phrases in question be con­  
strued to authorise every measure relating to the  
common defence and general welfare, as contend­  
ed by some; or every tnea-ure only in which  
there might be an application of money, as aug­  
gestedby the caution of others; the effect must  
substantially he the same, in destroying the im­  
port and *prce of the particular -numeration of  
powers which follow these general phrases in the  
Comtitut on. I* or, it is evident, that there is-not •  
single power whatever, which may not have soma  
reterence to the common defence, or the general  
welfare; nor a power of any magnitude, which,  
in its exercise, does not involve or admit an apnii.  
whirh money- 1,18 Government, therefore,  
which possesses power in either one or other ol  
these extents, is a Government without the limi­  
tations loaned by a particular enumeration of  
powers; and consequently, the meaning and effect  
of this particular enumeration, is destroyed by tko

quently adopted by the Legisla­  
ture, the whole subject was deliberately re­  
examined, and the objections urged,against  
the Virginia doctrine carefully considered.  
The result was that the Legislature of Vir­  
ginia re-affirmed all the principles laid down  
in the resolutions of 1798, and issued to the  
world that admirable report which has stamp­  
ed the character of Mr. Madison as the pre­  
server of that Constitution which he had  
contributed so largely to create and estab­  
lish. I will here quote from Mr. Madisons  
report one or two passages which bear more  
immediately on the point in controversy.  
The resolution having taken this view of the  
federal compact, proceeds to infer “ that in  
case of a deliberate, palpable, and danger­  
ous exercise of other powers, not granted  
by the said compact, the States who are  
parties thereto have the right, and are in  
duty bound, to interpose for arresting the  
progress of the evil, and for maintaining  
within their respective limits,the authorities,  
rights, and liberties appertaining to them.”  
“It appears to your committee to be a  
plain principle, founded on common sense,  
illustrated by common practice, and essen­  
tial to the nature of compacts—that, where  
resorts can be had at no tribunal superiour  
to the authority of the parties, the parties  
themselves must be the rightful judges in  
the last resort, whether the bargain made  
has been pursued or violated. The Consti­  
tution of the United States was formed by  
the sanction of the Slates, given by each in  
its sovereign capacity. It adds to the sta­  
bility and dignity, as well as to the authori­  
ty of the Constitution, that it rests on this  
legitimate and solid foundation. The States,  
then, being the parties to the Constitutional  
compact, and in their sovereign capacity, it  
follows of necessity, that there can be no  
tribunal above their authority, to decide in  
the last resort, whether the compact made  
by them be violated, and consequently, that  
as the parties to it, they must themselves  
decide, in the last resort, such questions as  
may be of sufficient magnitude to require  
their interposition.

“ The resolution has guarded against any  
misapprehension of its object, by expressly  
requiring for such an interposition, ‘ the case  
of a deliberate, palpable, and dangerous  
breach of the Constitution, by the exercise  
of powers not granted by it.’ It must be a  
case, not of a light and transient nature,  
but of a nature dangerous to the great pur­  
poses for which the Constitution was estab­  
lished.”  
“ But the resolution has done more than  
guard against misconstruction, by expressly  
referring to cases of a deliberate, palpable,  
and dangerous nature. It specifies the ob­  
ject of the interposition, which it contem­  
plates to be solely that of arresting the  
progress of the evil of usurpation, and of  
maintaining the authorities, rights, and lib­  
erties appertaining to the States, as parties  
to the Constitution.”  
  
“From this view of the resolution, it  
would seem inconceivable that it can incur  
any just disapprobation from those who, lay­  
ing aside all momentary impressions, and  
recollecting the genuine source and object  
of the federal constitution, shall candidly  
and accurately interpret the meaning of the  
general assembly. If the deliberate exer­  
cise of dangerous powers, palpably with­  
held by the Constitution, could not jus­  
tify the parties to it, in interposing even so  
far as to arrest the progress of the evil, and  
thereby to preserve the Constitution itself,  
as well as to provide for the safety of the  
parties to it, there would be an end to all  
relief from usurped power, and a direct sub­  
version of the rights specified or recognized  
under all the state coustitutions, as well as  
plain denial of the fundamental principles  
on which our independence was declared.”  
At the ensuing session of the Legislature,  
the subject was re-examined, and on the

these views, whether right or wrong, were the  
views of the fathers of the democratic party, and  
if I err, I err with the Plates and Socrates of my  
political faith. (Virg. Res. p. 8.) ; ;  
“The other position involved in this branch  
of the resolution, namely, “that the States are  
not parties to the Constitution or compact,”’ is  
in the judgment of the Committee equally free  
from objection. It is in indeed true that the  
term ‘“States’” is sometimes used in a vague  
sense, and sometlimes in different senses, accord­  
ing to the subject to which it is applied. Thu.s  
it soinetimes means the separate sectiens occupi­  
ed by the political societies within eash i some­  
times the particular governments established by~  
those societies ; sometime those secieties as or­  
ganized into those particular governments ; and  
lastly, it means the people composing those po­  
litieal societies, in their highest political sover­  
eign capacity. Altheugh it might be wished  
that the perfection of language admitted less di­  
versity in the signification of the same words,  
vet little inconveniency is produced by it, where  
the true sense can be collected with certainty  
from the different applications. In the present,  
instance, whatever different constructions of the  
term *‘States,” in the resolution may have been  
entertained, all will at lexst concur in that last  
mentioned ; because in that sense,the Constiti­  
tion was submitted to the “States ;”’ in that sense  
the “States” ratified it ;and in that sense of the  
term “States,” they are cohsequently partics  
to the compact from which the powers of tha  
Federal Government resalt.”

ari-e, not confided to the judiciary of the States  
or United States, the officers concerned in those  
questions must themselves decide them; and in  
the end, must pursue such course as their

Mr. Madison, in his report, says: “ But it is objected,  
that the judicial authority is to Ik? regarded as the sole  
expositor of the Constitution in the last resort; and it1  
may be asked, for what reason, the declaration by the  
General Assembly, supposing it to be theoretically true,  
could be required at the present day, aud in so solemn a  
manner.  
  
“Oil this objection it might bo observed, first: that  
there inay be instances of usurped power, which the  
forms of the Constitution would never draw within the  
control of the Judicial Department: Secondly, that if  
the decision of the Judiciary be raised above the au­  
thority of the sovereign parties to the Constitution, the  
decisions of the other Departments, not carried by the  
forms of the Constitution before the Judiciary, must be  
equally au&#x27;horitative nml final with the decisions of that  
Departmen*. Hut the proper answer to the objection  
is, that tlic resolution ot the General Assembly relates  
to those great and extraordinary cases in which all the  
forms of llie Constitution may prove ineffectual against  
infractions dangerous to the essential rights of the p&#x27;artics  
toil. The resolution supposes that dangerous powers  
not delegated, may not only be usurped and executed  
by the other Departments, but that lb« Judicial Depart­  
ment also, may exercise or sanction dangerous powers  
beyond the grant of the Constitution, and consequently  
that the ultimate right of the parties to the Const.tution  
to judge whether the compact has been dangerously vio­  
lated, must extend to violations by one delegated authori­  
ty, as well as by another—bv the Judiciarv, as well as  
by the Executive or legislative.  
“However *rue, therefore, it may be, that the Jndici. l  
Department, has in all q&#x27;&gt;e«tion»’suhmiu«d toil hy the  
forms of the Con titution, to decide in the last resort,this  
resort mu&lt;t necessarily he deemed the las*, in relation  
to the authorities of t lie other departments oft he gove rn­  
inent: not in relation to the rights of the parties to the  
constitutional compact, from which the judicial ns  
well as Hie ether departments hold their delegated  
trusts. On any othc r hypothesis, the delegation of ju­  
dicial power wool I annul the authority delegating it;  
and the concurrence of (his departmen*, with the oth-rs  
in usurped powers, might subvert for ever, and beyond  
the possible reach ot any rightful remedy, the very  
Constitution, which all were instituted to preserve.”

“ 0,,&quot;&#x27;r l,osi,ion involved in thin branch of the  
resolution, namely, *&#x27; that the States art; not partitas to  
the Constitution pr compact,” is in the judgment of the  
Committee, equally free from objection. It is indeed  
Into that the term “ States” i« sometimes used in a  
vague sense, anil sometimes in different senses, accord­  
ing to the subject to which it is applied. Thus it some­  
times means the separate sections occupied by the po­  
litical societies within each; sometimes the particular  
governments, established by tho*e societies; sometimes  
those societies as organized into those particular gov­  
ernments; ami lastly, it means thp people composing  
(hose political societies, in their highest political *ove­  
reign capacity. Although it might be wished that the  
perfection of language.admitted less diversity in the  
signification of the same words, yet little incoWvenirn­  
ry is produced by it. where the tru» sense can be col­  
lected with certs jti&#x27;y from the different applications

entertained, all will at least concur in that last men­

&#x27;ifkd i&#x27;; and in that sen** of the term “ Stales,” they  
are consequently parties to the compart from which the  
powers of (he Federal Government result.”  
The S&#x27;a&#x27;e* turn being one party, is it to be contend­

“The other position involved in this branch of the reso  
lution, namely, ‘that the Siatesare parties to the Cousti-  
tution, or compact,’ is, in tae judgment of the committee,  
equally free from objection” It is, indeed, true, that the  
term ‘States’ is sometimes used in a vague sense, and  
sometimes in different senses, according to the subject to  
which it is applied. Thus, it sometimes means the sepa-  
rate sections of territory occupied by the political societies  
within each; sometimes the parucular governments estab-  
ished by those societies; sometimes those societies as organ-  
ized into those particular governmeats; and, lastly, it means  
the people composing those political societies, in their highest  
sovereign capacity.” Although it might be wished that  
the perfection of Janguage admitted less diversity in the  
signification of the same words, yet little inconvenience is  
produced by it where the true sense can be collected with  
certainty from the different applications. Inthe present  
instance, whatever different constructions of the term  
‘States,’ in the resolution, may have been entertained, all  
will at least concur in that last mentioned; because, in  
hat sense, the Constitution was submitied to the ‘States’ ;  
in that sense the *States’ ratified it; and in that sense al  
the term ‘States,’ they are consequently parties to the  
compact, frem which the powers of the Federal Govern-  
ment result,”  
  
Having now established the position that the Constitu-  
tion was ac@mpact between sovereign and independent  
States, baving no common superior “it follows oT hater  
sity,” (to borrow the language of Mr. Madison) “that there  
can be no tribunal above their authority to decide in the  
last Tesort, whether the compact made by them be violat-  
ed, and consequently, that, as the parties to it, they must  
themselves decide, in the last resort, such questions as may  
be of sufficient magnitude to require their interposition.”

Mr. Madison, in his report, says witdoe3 not follow  
however, that because the States, as sovereign par­  
ties to their constitutional compact, ; must ultimately,  
decide whether it has been violated, that such a deci­  
sion ought to be interposed, either in a hasty manner,  
or on doubtful and inferior occasions. Even in the  
case of ordinary conventions between different na­  
tions, where, by the strict rule of interpretation, a  
breach of a part may be deemed a breach of the  
whole; every part being deemed a condition of every  
oiherpart, and of the whole, it is always laid down,  
that the breach must be both wilful and material to  
justify an application of the rule. But in the case of  
nn intimate and Constitutional Union, like that of the  
United States, H is evident, that the; interposition of  
the parties in their sovereign capacity, can be calkd

Whatever room might be found in the proceedingsof some of the  
States, who have disapproved of the Resolutions of the General As-  
sembly of this Commonwealth, passed on the 21st day of Decem-  
ber, 1798, for painful remarks on the spirit and manner of those  
proceedings, it appears to tlic Committee most consistent with the  
duty as well as digmty of the Gencral Assembly, to hasten an ob-  
livion of every carcumstanee, which might be construed into a dimi  
nution of mutual respect, confidence and affoct.on, among the  
bers of the Union.  
  
The Commuttee have deemed it a more useful! task, to revise with  
a critical eve, the resolutions which: have met with this disapproba-  
tion; toexamune fully the several objections and arguments wiuch  
lave appeared against them ; and, to inquire whether there be any  
errors of fact, of principle, or of reasoning, which the candor of the  
General Assembly ought to acknowledge and correct.  
  
The first of the resolutions is in the words following:  
  
“Resolved, That the General Assembly of Virguma doth uneq@i-  
vocally express a firm resolution to maintain and defend the Consti-  
tution of the United States, and the Constitution of this State,  
against every AS_Tession, either torcign or domestic, and that tix y  
will support the Government of the United States in all measures  
warranted by the former.”  
  
No unfavorable conunent can have been made on the sentanents  
nere expressed. To maintain and defend the Constitution of the  
United States, and of their own State, against evcry aggression, both  
toreggn and domestic, and to support the Government of the United  
Siates in all measures warranted by their Constitution, are dutics  
which thé General Assembly ought always to feel, and to which, on  
such an occasion, it was evidently pioper to express their sincere  
and firm adherence.  
  
In their next resolution—*The Gencral Assembly most solemnly  
  
clares a warm attachment to the Union of the States, to maintain  
which, it pledges all its powers ; and, that for this end, it 1s their  
duty to watch over and oppose every imfraction of those principles,  
tinch constitute the only basis of that Union, because a fa:thful ob-  
servance of them can alone secure its existence and the public hap-  
piness.  
  
Iiciti-  
  
The observation just made is equally applicable to this solemn de-  
claration, of warm attachment to the Union, and this solemn pledge  
to maintain it; nor can any Question arise among enligntened  
trends of the Union, as to the duty of watching over and opposing  
every infraction of those principles which constitute its basis, and a  
faithful observance of which, can alone secure its existence, and the  
puhhe happiness thereon depending.  
  
Tae third resolution is in the words following:  
  
“That this Assembly doth explicitly and peremptorily declare, that  
\ views the powers of the Fedcral Government, as resulting from the  
  
mpact, to which the States are partics, as hinted by the plain sense  
and intention of the instrument constituting that compact—as no  
turther valid than they are authorised by the grants enumerated in  
“uit Compact ; and, that in case of a dchberate, palpable and dan-  
sous exercise of olhcr powers, not granted by the sak! compact,  
‘ae States who are partics thcreto, have the mght, and are in du‘y  
bound, to interpose, for arresting the progress of the evil, and for  
  
nuntaining within their respective limits, the authorities, rights and  
erties appertaining to them.”  
  
On this resolution, the Committee have bestowed all the attention  
vhich its importance merits: They have scanned it not merely witha  
‘net, but with a severe eye: and they feel confidence im pronoune-  
ing, that, in its just and fair construction, it is unexceptionably true  
‘1 tts several positions, as well as constitutional and conclusive in its  
liferences,  
  
The resolution declares, frst, that “it views the powers of the  
Federal Government, as resulting from the compact to which the  
“ates are parties ;”’ in other words, that the Federal powers are de-  
rived from the Constitution ; and, that the Constitution is a compact  
lv which the States are parties.  
  
Clear as the position must scem, that the Federal powers are de-  
‘ved from the Constitution, and from that alone, the Committee are  
‘ot unapprised of a late doctrine, which opens another source of  
Federal powers, not less extensive and important, than it is new and  
“nexpected. ‘The examination of this doctrine will be most conve-  
Mently connected with a review of a succeeding resolution. ‘The  
Committee satisfy themselves here with briefly remarking, that in all  
‘ic contemporary discussions and comments which the Constitution  
‘inderwent, it was constantly justified and recommended, on the  
ground, that the powers not given to the Government, were withheld  
‘omit; and, that if any doubt could have existed on this subject,  
under the original text of the Constitution, it is removed, as far as  
moras could remove it, by the 12th amendment, now a part of the  
»nstitution, which expressly declares, “that the powers not dele-  
“ated to the United States, by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it  
le States, are reserved to the States respeciively, or to the peo-  
., The other position involved in this branch of the resolution, name  
*» “that the States are parties to the Constitution or compact,” is,  
s the judgment of the Committee, equally free from objection. Tt

granted powers are valil, because granted, all other powers no

The resolution having taken this view of the Pederal compact,

the States, who are purtics thereto, have the right and are in duty

foundation. The States, then, being the /rties to the Constitution-  
al compact, and in their sovereigu capacit),it follows ot Lece sity,  
that there can be no tribunal above their autgority, to decide in the  
iast resort, whether the compact made by them be violated: and,  
consequentlr, that, as the parties to it, they must themselves decide  
in the last resort, such questions as may be of sutficient magnitude  
to require their interposition. 3  
  
It docs not follow, Lowever, that because the States, as sovereign  
parties to their Consitutional compact, must ultimately decide  
whether it has been violated, that such  alecision ought to be inter-  
nosed, citherin a hasty manner, or on doubtful and inferior occa-

nations, where, by the strict rule of interpretauon, a breach of a  
part may be deemeda breach of the whole; every p.at being deem-

The resolution has, accordingly, guarded against any misapprehen- | large its powers by forced comstructions of the Constitutional  
sion of its object, by expressly requiring for such an interposition, | Charter.  
  
“the case of a deliberate, palpable and dangerous breach of the Con-  
stitution, by tire excecise of powers ust gruniea byw.” Tt must be a  
case, noi Of a lyhi and transient natur., but of a nature dangerous to  
the great purposes for which the Contiiution was established. It  
musi bea case, morever, not obscure or doubtful in its construction,  
but plain and palpeble. Lastly, it must be a case not resulting from  
4 parual consideration, or Lasty determination; but a case stampt with  
a final considcravou and deliberate adherence. Tt is not .ccessary,  
because the resolution docs not require, that the question should be  
discussed, how far the exercise of any part.cnlar power, ungranted  
by the Constitution, would justify the interposition of the parties to  
it. As cases might easily be stated, wuich none would contend ought  
to fall within Unat description ; cases, onthe other hand, might, with  
equal ease, be stated, so flagiant and so fatal, as to unite every opi-  
nion in placing them within the description.  
  
But the resolution has done more than guard against misconstruc-  
tion, by expressly referring to cases of a deliberate, palpable and dan-  
gerous nature. It specifics the object of the interposition which it  
contemplates, to be sol.ly that of arresting the progress of the evil  
of usurpation, and of maintaining the wuthoritics, mghts and liber-  
ties appertaining to the States, as parties to the Constitution.  
  
From this view of the resolution, jt would seem inconc:iveable that  
it can incur any just disapprobation from those, who, kiying aside all  
momentary impressions, and recollecting the genuine source and ob-  
ject of the Federal Constitution, shall candidly and accurately inter-  
pret the meaning of the General “Assembly. If the deliberate exer-  
cise of dangerous powers, palpubly withheld by the Constitut:on,  
could not justify the parties to it, in interposing even so far as to ar-  
rest the progress of the evil, and thereby to preserve the Constitu  
tion itself, as wéll as to provide for the safety of the partics to it ;  
there would be an end to all relief from usurped power, and a direc  
subversion of the rights specified or recognized under all the State  
Constitutions, as well as a plain denial of the fundamental principle  
on which our independence itself was declared.  
  
But it is objected, that the Judicial authority is to be regarded as  
the sole expositor of the Constitution in the last resort ; and it may  
be asked for what reason, the declaration by the’ General Assembiy,  
supposing it to be theoretically true, could be required at the present  
day arid in so solemn a manner. |  
  
On this objection it might be observed, fret: that there may be

The General Assembly having declared their opinion merely by  
regretting in general terms that forted constructions for enlarging  
the Federal powers have taken place, it does not appear to the  
Commuttee necessary to go into a specification of every instance to  
which the resolution may allude. ‘The Alien and Sedition Acts be  
ing particularly named in a succeed:ng resolution, are of course to  
be understood as included in the allusion. Omitting others which  
have less occupied public attention, or been less extensively regard-  
ed as unconstitutional, the resolution may be presumed to refer par-  
ticularly to the Bank Law, which from the circumstances of its pas.  
sage, as well as the latitude of construction on which it is founde:|,  
str:kes the attention with singular foree; and the carriage tax, &lt;is-  
unguished also by circumstances in its history having a similar ten-  
dency. ‘Those instances alone, if resulting from forced construction  
and calculated to enlarge the powers of the Federal Government, as  
the Committee cannot but conceive to be the case, sufficiently war-  
rant this part of the resolution. ‘The Committee have not thought  
it ipcumbent on them to extend their attention to laws which have  
been objected to, rather as varying the Constitutional distnbution of  
powers inthe Federal Government, than as an absolute enlargement  
of them ; because instances of tis sort, however portant m thei  
principles and tendencies, do not appear to fall strictly within the  
text under review.  
  
The other questions presenting themselves, are—1. Whether in-  
dications have appeared of a design to expound certam general  
phrases copied from the “Articles of Confede:ation” soasto destroy  
the effect of the particular enumeration explaining and hmitg their  
meaning. 2. Wether this exposidon would by degrees consoli-  
date the States into one sovereignty. 3. Whether the tendency and  
result of this consolidation would be to transform the republican  
system of the United Siates into a monarchy.  
  
1. The general phrases here meant must be those “tof providing  
for the common defence and general welfare.”  
  
In the “*Articles of Confederation,” the phrases are used as fol-  
lows, in art. VIUL. “All charges of war, and all othere ses that  
shall be incurred for the commen defenct and generat welfare, and al-  
lowed by the United States m Congress assembled, shall be dofrayed  
out of a common treasury, which shall be supplied by the sevcrat

modating legal regulations to a country so great in extent, and so} mer situation, although the highest Judicial authority should see the  
various in its circumstances, has been much felt ; and has led to oc-| most sufficient cause for it.  
casional investments of power in the Executive, which involve per- But, in the last place, it can never be admitted, that the removal  
haps as large a portion of discretion, as can be deemed consistent] of Aliens, authorised by the act, is to be considered, not as pun-  
with the nature of the Executive trust. In proportion as the objects| ishment for an offence; but as a measure of precaution and preven-

of a general nature, so as to suit them to the diversity of ow porary kind; where he enjoys under the laws, a greater share of the

where hope for, and where he may have nearly completed his proba.  
tionary title te citizenship: if, moreover, in the execution of the sep.  
tence against him, he is to be exposed, not only to the ordinary  
dangers of the sea, but to the peculiar casualties incident to a cris.  
sis of war, and of unusual licentiousness on that clement, and possi.  
bly to vindictive purposes which his emigration itself may have pro.  
voked ; if a banishment of this sort be not a punishment, and among  
the severest of punishments, it will be difficult to imagine a doon,  
to which the name can be applied. Andif itbea punishment, js  
will remain to be inquired, whether it can be constitutionally jp  
flicted, on mere suspicion, by the single will of the Executiye  
Magistrate,on persons convicted of no personal offence against th ¢  
laws of the land, nor involved in any offence against the lay  
of nations, charged on the forcign state of which they are mem  
bers.  
  
One argument offered in justification of this power exercised  
over Aliens, is, that the admission of them into the country being of  
favor, not of right, the favor is at all times revocable.  
  
To this argument it might be answered, that allowing the truth  
of the inference, it would be no proof of what is required. 4  
era would still occur, whether the Constitution had vested the  
  
iscretionary power of admitting Aliens, in the Federal governmen  
or in the State Governments.  
  
But it cannot be a true inference, that because the admission of  
an Alicn is a favor, the favor may be revoked at pleasure. A gran  
of land to an individual, may be of favor, not of right ; but the mo.  
ment the grant is made, the favor becomes a night, and must be  
forfeited before it can be taken away. To pardon a malefactoy  
may be a favor, but the pardon is not, on that account, the less irre.  
vocable. To admit an Alicn to naturalization, is as much a favor.  
as to adinit him to reside in the country, yet it cannot be pretended,  
that a person naturalized can be deprived of the benefits any mor  
than a native citizen can be disfranchised. &#x27;  
  
Again, itis said, that Aliens not being parties to the Constitution.  
the rights and privileges which it secures, cannot be at all claimed  
by them.  
  
To this reasoning also, it might be answered, that although  
Aliens are not parties to the Constitution, it does not follow that the  
Constitution has vested in Congress an absolute power over them.  
The parties to the constitution may have granted, or retained, o;  
modified the power over aliens, without regard to that particula  
consideration  
  
But a more direct reply is, that it does not follow, because Aliens  
are not parties to the Constitutions, as citizens are parties to it, tha’  
whilst they actually conform to it, they have no right to its prote:  
tion. Aliens are not more partics to the laws, than they are parties  
to the Constitution ; yet, it will not be disputed, that as they owe on  
one hand, a temporary obedience, they are entitled in return to  
their protection and advantage.  
  
If Aliens had no rights under the Constitution, they might not  
only be banished, but even capitally punished, without a jury o:  
the other incidents to a fair trial But so far hasa contrary pnneipk  
been carried, in every part of the United States, that except on  
charges of treason, an Alicn has, besides all the common privileges,  
the special one of being tried by a jury, of which one half may b:  
also Aliens.  
  
It is said, further, that by the law and practice of nations, Aliens  
may be removed at discretion, for offences against the law of na  
tions ; that Congress are authorized to define and punish such oi  
fences : and that to be dangerous to the peace of society is, in  
Aliens, one of those offences. :  
  
The distinction between Alien enemies and Alien friends, iss  
clear and conclusive answer to this argument. Alien enemies an  
under the law of nations,and lable to be punished for offenc:  
against it. Alien friends, except in the single case of public minis.  
ters, are“under the municipal law, and must be tried and punished  
according to that law only.  
  
This argument also, by referring the Alien act, to the power o!  
Congress to define and punish offences against the law gine ag  
vielde the point that the act is of a penal, not merely of a preven  
live Operation. It must, in truth be soconsidered. And if it be s  
ee act, the punishment it inflicts, must be justified by some of  
ence that deserves it.  
  
Offences for which Aliens, within the jurisdiction of a country,  
are punishable, are first, offences committed by the nation of whicl:  
they make a part, and in whose offences they are involved: Second  
ly, offences committed by themselves alone, without any charg  
against the nation to which they belong. The first isthe case of  
Alien enemies; the sccond, the case of Alien friends. In the first  
case, the offending nation can no otherwise be punished than by  
war, one of the laws of which authorises the pea 1 a of such of its  
members, as may be found within the country, against which the of  
fence has been committed. In the second case, the offence being  
committed by the individual, not by his nation, and against the mu-  
aicipal law, not against the law of nations ; the individual only, and  
not the nation, is punishable ; andthe punishment must be conducted  
according to the municipal law, not according to the law of nations  
Under this view of the subject, the act of Congress, for the remova!  
of Alien enemies, being conformable to the law of nations, is justi-  
fied by the Constitution: and the “act’’ for the removal of Alien  
frends, being repugnant to the constitutional principles of Munici-  
pal law, is unjustifiable.  
  
Nor is the act of Congress for the removal of Alien friends, more  
agreeable to the general practice of nations, than it is within th:  
purview of the law of nations. The general practice of nations, dis  
tinguishes between Alien friends and Alien enemies. The latter it  
has proceeded against, according to the law of nations, by expe!  
ling them as enemics. The former it has considered as under a  
local and temporary allegiance, and entitled to a corresponden&#x27;  
protection. If contrary imstances are to be found in barbarous  
countnes, under undefined prerogatives, or amid revolutionary dan  
gers ; they will noi be deemed fit precedents for the Governmen&#x27;  
of the United States, even, if not beyond its constitutional au-  
thority.  
  
It is said that Congress may grant letters of marque and reprisal:  
that reprisals may be made on persons, as well as property ; and  
that the removal of Aliens may be. considered as the exercise in an  
inferjor degree, of the general power of reprisal on persons.  
  
Without entering minutely into a question that does not seem to  
require it, it may be remarked, that reprisal is a scizure of foreign  
pone or property, with a view to obtain that justice for injuries  
done by one State or its members, to another State or its members :  
for which, a refusal of the aggressors requires such a resort to force  
under the law of nations. It must be considered as an abuse of  
words, to call the removal of persons from a country, a seizure or  
reprisal on them: nor is the distinction to be overlooked betweet!  
reprisals on persons within the country and under the faith of its  
laws, and on persons out of the country. But laying. aside these  
considerations, it is evidently impossible to bring the Alien act with-  
inthe power of granting reprisals : since it does not allege or im-  
ply na injury received ee any particular nation, for which this  
  
roceeding against its members was intended as a reparation.  
. The seceding is authorized against Aliens of every nation; of  
nations charged neither with any similar eeding against Amer&#x27;-  
can citizens, nor with any inrjuries for which ju j might be sought,  
in the mode prescribed by the act. Were it true, therefore, that  
good causes existed for reprisals against one or more foreign na-  
tions, and that neither the persons nor property of its members, un-  
der the faith of our laws, could plead an exemption ; the operation

of the act ought to have been limited to the Aliens among us, be-  
  
longing to such nations. To license a against ajl nations,  
for aggressions ch d on one only, would be a measuregas contrary  
to every principle o justice and public law, as to a wise policy, and  
the universal practice of nations. — . 70 Sawre  
  
It is said, that the right of removing Aliens, is an incident to the  
  
ower of war, vested in Congress by tie Constivution.  
  
This is a former argument in a new shape only; and is answered  
by repeating, that the removal of Alien enemies is an incident to  
the power of war ; that the removal of Alien friends, is not an inci-  
dent to the power of war.  
  
It is said, that Congress, are by the Constitution to protect each  
State against invasion; and that the means of preventing invasion  
are included in the power of protection against it.  
  
The power of war in general, having been before granted by  
the Constitution, this clause must either be a mere specificaton for  
greater caution and certainty, of which there are other examples in  
the instrument; or be the injunction of a duty, superadded toa  
grant of the power. Under either explanation, it cannot enlarge  
the powers of Congress on the subject. The power and the duty  
to protect each State against an invading enemy, would be the same  
under the general power, if this regard to greater caution had been  
omitted.  
  
Invasion isan operation of war. To protect against invasion is  
an exercise of the power of war. A power, therefore, not inci-  
dent to war, cannot be incident to a particular modification of war.  
and as the removal of alien friends, has appeared to be no incident  
to a general state of war, it cannot be incident to a partial state, or  
a particular modification of war.  
  
Nor can it ever be granted, that a power to act on a case when it  
actually occurs, inoliiiies a power over all the means that may send  
to prevent the occurrence of the case. Such a latitude of construc-  
tion would render unavailing, every practical definition of particu-  
lar and limited powers. Under the idea of preventing war in gene-  
ral, as well as invasion in particular, not only an indiscriminate re-  
moval of all aliens might be enforced, but a thousand other things  
till more remote from the operations and precautions appurtenant  
to war, might take place. A bigotted or tyrannical nation might  
threaten us with war, unless certain religious or political regulations  
were adopted by us ; yet it never could be inferred, if the regula-  
tions which would prevent war, were such as Congress had other-  
wise no power to make, that the power to meke them would grow  
out of the purpose they were to answer. Congress have power to  
suppress insurrections, yet it would not be allowed to follow, that  
they might employ all the means tending to prevent them: of  
which a system of moral instruction for the ignorant, and of provi-  
dent support forthe poor, might oe regarded as among the most  
efficacious.  
  
One argument for the power of the General Government to re-  
move Aliens, would have been passed in silence, if it had appeared  
ander any authority inferior to that of a report, made during the  
last session of Congress, to the House of Representatives by a Com-  
mittee, and approved by the House. The doctrine on which this  
argument is founded, is of so new and so extraordinary a charac-  
ter, and strikes so radically at the political system of America,  
that it is proper to state it in the very words of the report.  
  
“The act [concerning aliens] is said to be unconstitutional, be-  
“cause to remove aliens, is a direct breach of the Constitution,  
“which provides, by the 9th section of the Ist article: that the  
“migration or importation of such persons as any of the States  
“shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by the Con-  
“gress, prior to the year 1808.”  
  
Among the answers given to this objection to the constitutional  
ty of the act, the following very remarkable one is extracted:  
  
“ Thirdly, that as the Constitution has grven to the States, no pow-  
“er to remove aliens, during the period of the limitation under  
‘consideration, in the mean time, on the construction assumed,  
“there would be no authority in the country, empowered to send  
‘away dangerous aliens, which cannot be admitted.  
  
The reasoning here used, would not in any view, be conclusive;  
yecause there are powers exercised by most other Governments,  
which, in the United States are withheld by the people, both from  
the General Government and from the State Governments. Of  
this sort are many of the powers prohibited by the declarations of  
right prefixed to the Constitutions, or by the clauses in the Consti-  
tutions, in the nature of such declarations. Nay, so far is the po-  
itical system of the United States distinguishable from that of  
sther countries, by the caution with which powers are delegated  
and defined ; that in one very important case, even of commercial  
regulation and revenue, the power is absolutely locked up against  
the hands of both Governments. A tax on exports can be lad by  
no constitutional authority whatever. Under a system thus pecu-  
larly guarded, there could surely be no absurdity in supposing,  
hat alhen friends, who if guilty of treasonable machinations may  
% punished, or if suspected on probable grounds, may be secured  
2» pledges or imprisonment, in like manner with permanent citizens,  
were never meant to be subjected to banishment by any arbitrary  
= unusual process, either under the one government, or the  
Uuner.  
  
But, it is not the inconclusiveness of the gencral reasoning in this  
passage, which chiefly calls the attention to it. Itis the principle  
assumed by it, that the powers held by the States, are given to  
them by the Constitution of the United States ; and the inference  
‘rom this principle, that the powers supposed to be necessary which  
ae not so given to the State Governments, must reside in the Gov_  
erament of the United States.  
  
The respect which is felt for every portion of the constituted  
authorities, forbids some of the reflections which this singular para-  
graph might exite ; and they are the more readily suppressed, as at  
may be presumed, with justice perhaps, as well as candour, that  
nalvertence may have had its share in the error. It would be an  
unjustifiable delicacy, nevertheless, to pass by so portentous a claim,  
proceeding from so high an authority, without a monitery notice of  
the fatal tendencies with which it would be pregnant.  
  
Lastly, it is said, that a law on the same subject with the Alien  
  
Act, passed by this State originally in 1785, and re-enacted in 1792,  
‘proof that a summary removal of suspected Aliens, was not  
\eretofore regarded by the Virginia Legislature, as liable to the ob-  
ections now urged against such a measure.  
, This charge against Virginia vanishes before the simple remark,  
‘hat the law of Virginia relates to “suspicious persons beiug the  
‘jects of any foreign power or state, who shall have made a deela-  
{ war, or actually commenced hostilities, or from whom the Presi-  
ent shall apprehend hostile designs ;”” whereas the act of Congress  
relates to Aliens, being the subjects of foreign powers and states,  
tho have neither declared war, nor commenced hostilities, nor from  
shom hostile designs are apprehended.  
  
ll. Itis next affimed of the Alien Act, that it unites Legislative,  
  
wicial, and Executive powers in the hands of the President.  
  
However difficult it may be to mark, in every, case, with clear.  
  
ren and certainty, the line which divides Legislative power from  
  
lend cepartments of power, all will agree, that the powers re-  
ek + these departments may be so genera] and undefined, as  
nea hs a Legislative, not of an Executive or Judicial nature ; and  
  
‘ for that reason be unconstitutional. Details toa certain de-  
Tt, are essential to the nature and character of a law ; and on  
  
me subjects, it is proper, that details should leave as little as  
ie + to the discretion of those who are to apply and execute

power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any] 4  
  
sit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the  
tinited States, by citizens of another State, or by citizens or sub-  
jects of ang foreign power.” As it will not be pretended that any  
criminal proceeding could take place against a State; the terms law  
  
r equity, must be understood as appropriate to civil, in exclusion of  
  
uminal cases.  
  
From these considerations, it 1: evident that this part of the Con-  
-titution, even if it could be applied at all, to the purpose for which  
it has been cited, would not include any cases whatever of a crimi-  
nal nature; and consequently, would vot authorise the inference  
from it, that the Judicial authority extends to offences against the com-  
mon jaw, as offences arising under the Constitution.  
  
it is further to be considered, that even if this part of the Consti-  
tution could be strained into an application to every common law  
case, criminal as well as civil, it could have no effect in justifying  
the Sedition Act; which is an exercise of Legislative and not of Ju-  
dicial power: and it is the Judicial power, only, of which the extent  
  
s defined in this part of the Constitution.  
  
There are two passages in the Constitution, in which a descrip-  
tien of the law of the United States, is found. The first is con-  
tained mn Art. It. Sec. 2. in the words following: “This Constitution,  
the laws of the U.S and treaties made, or which shall be made un-| «  
this authority.” The second contained in the second | |]  
paragraph of Article VI. as follows: “This Constitution, and | ;  
the laws of the United States which shall be made in pur-|  
suance thereof, and all treaties made, ot which shall be made. |  
under the authority of the United States shall be the supreme law | \
of the land.” The first of these descriptions was meant as a guide  
to the Judges of the United States; the second as a guide to the | ,  
judges of the several States. Bothof them consist of an enumera- 7  
tion. which was evidently meant to be precise and compiete. |

would be insupportable.  
  
if with these amendments, what period is to be fixed for limiting the  
British authority over our laws?’  
  
Is it to be the date of the eldest or the youngest of the colonies?  
  
Or are the dates to be thrown together, and a medium deduced ?  
  
Or is our independence to be taken for the date?  
  
Is, again,regard to be had te the various changes in the common law |  
nade by the local codes of America’  
  
Is regard to be had to such changes, subsequent, as well as prior, to the |  
  
stablishment of the Constitution? |  
Is regard to be had to future, as well as past changes?’  
is the law to be different in every State, as differently modified by its  
  
. &gt; . . . ’ &#x27; | . . : .  
code; or are the modifications of any particular State, to be applied to all | this part of an mstrument, in opposition to the plain mean-  
  
And on the latter supposition, which among the State codes would |  
torm the standard?  
  
Questions of this sort might be multiplied with as much ease as there |  
would be difficulty in answering them.  
  
The consequences flowing trom the proposed construction, furnish |  
  
ther objections equally conclusive: unless the text were peremptory in  
its meaning, and consistent with other parts of the instrument.  
  
These consequences may be in relation to the Legislative anthori-  
ty of the United States; to the Kxecutive authority; to the Judicial  
authority; and to the Governments of the several States.  
  
if it be understood, that the common law is established by the  
Constitution, it follows that no part of the law can he altered by the  
Legislature; such of the statutes already passed, as tay be repug-  
nant thereto, would be nutlitied; particulariy the “Sedition Act”  
iself, which boasts of being a melioration of the common law; and  
the whole code, with a‘l its incongruities, barbarisms, and bloody  
maxims, would be inviolably saddled on the good peopte of the U. 5S.  
  
Should this consequence be rejected, andthe common law be heid,  
‘ike other laws, liable to revision and alteration, by the authority of  
Congress, 1t then follows, that the authority of Congress is co-exten-  
ive with the objects of common Jaw; that is to say, with every ob-  
‘ect of legislation: For, to every such object, does some branch or  
  
therof the common law extend. The authority of Congress would,  
‘herefore, be no longer under the limitations, marked out in the Con-  
stitution. They would be authorised, to legisiate in all cases what-  
soever.  
  
In the next place, as the President possesses the execu-  
‘ive powers of the Constitution, and is to see that the laws  
be faithfully executed, his authority also must be co-exten-  
-ive with every branch of the common law. rcsamte  
which this would make to his power, though not readily to|  
ve estimated, claim the most serious attention.  
  
This is not all; it will merit the most profound consider- |  
ation, how far an Indefinite admission of the common law,  
with a latitude in construing it, equal to the construction by |  
which it is deduced from the Constitution, might draw after |  
  
t the various prerogatives making part of the unwritten  
ww of Engiand. The English Constitution itself, is nothing |  
more than a composition of unwritten laws and maxims.  
  
4n the third place, whether the common law be admitted |  
as of legal or of gonstitutional obligation, it would confer on  
  
ne Judicial department, a discretion little short of a legis-|  
ative power.  
  
On the supposition of its having a constitutional obliga-  
‘ion, this power in the Judges would be permanent and ir-  
remediable by the Legislature. On the other supposition, |  
the power would not expire, until the Legislature should  
have introduced a full system of statutory provisions. Let  
‘t be observed, too, that besides all the uncertainties above  
  
numerated, and which present an immense field for judi-|  
  
al discretion, it would remain with the same department  
‘o decide what parts of the common law would, and what  
would not, be properly applicable to the circumstances of  
the United States.  
  
A discretion of this sort has always been lamented as in-  
congruous and dangerous, even in the Colonial and State  
courts; although so much narrowed by positive provisions  
in the local codes on ail the principal subjects embraced by  
the common law. Under the United States, where so few  
‘aws exist on those subjects, and where so great a lapse of  
time must happen before the vast chasm could be supplied,  
it is manifest that the power of the Judges over the law  
would, in fact, erect them into Legislators; and, that for a  
long time, it would be impossible for the citizens to con-  
jeeture, either what was, or would be law.  
  
In the last place, the consequence of admitting the com-  
  
  
  
t last added to the Constitution, de-}| mon law as the law of the  
“The Judicial} of the individual States, is as obvious as it would be fatal.  
  
be paramount to the Constitutions and laws of the States;  
the admission of it would overwhelm the residuary, sove-  
reignty of the States, and by one constructive operation,  
  
ican colonies, prior to their independence; of the effect of  
this event on their situation; of the nature and import of  
the articles of confederation; of the true meaning of the

tainties incident to the doctrine; and of its vast consequen-

most proper in their hands for the purpose. The Congress  
has power, before it happens, to pass laws for punishing  
it; and the Executive and Judiciary have power to enforce  
those laws when it does happen.  
  
It must be recoilected by many, and could be shewn to  
the satisfaction of all, that the construction here put on the  
terms “necessary and proper,” is precisely the construc.  
tion which prevailed during the discussions and ratifications  
of the Constitution. It may be added, and cannot too  
often be repeated, that it is a cénstruction absolutely ne.  
cessaryto maintain their consistency with the peculiar charac.  
ter of the government, as possessed of particular and definite  
powers only; not of the general and indefinite powers vest.  
ed in ordinary governments. For if the power to s“ppress  
insurrections, includes a power to punish libels; or if the  
power to punish, includes a power to prevent, by all the  
means that may have that tendency, such is the relation and  
influence among the most remote subjects of legislations,  
that a power over a very few, would carry with ita power  
over all. And it must be wholly immaterial, whether up.  
lumited powers be exercised under the name of unlimited  
powers, or be exercised under the name of unlimited means  
of carrying into execution, limited powers.  
  
This branch of the subject will be closed with a reflec-  
tion which must have weight with all; but more especial-  
ly with those who place peculiar reliance on the judicial  
exposition of the Constitution, as the bulwark provided  
against undue extensions of the legislative power. If it be  
understood that the powers implied in the specified pow-  
ers, have an immediate and appropriate relation to them,  
as means necessary and proper for carrying them into ex-  
ecution, questions, on the constitutionality of laws passed  
for this purpose, will be of a nature sufficiently precise  
and determinate for judicial cognizance and control. If,  
on thevther hand, Congress are not limited in the choice  
of means by any such appropriate relation of them to the  
specified powers; bu! may employ all such means they  
may deem fitted to prevent as well as to punish crimes sub-  
jected to their authority, such asmay have a tendency only  
to promole an object for which they are outhorized to pro-  
vide; every one must perceive that questions relating to  
means of this sort, must be questions for mere policy and  
expediency ; on which I cislative discretion alone can de-  
cide, and from which the judicial interposition and contro!  
are completely excluded.  
  
If. The next point which the resolution requires to be  
proved is, that the power over the press exercised by the  
Sedition Act, is pos.tively forbidden by one of the amend-  
ments to the Constitution.  
  
The amendment stands in these words—*Congress shal!  
make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or  
prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging the free-  
dom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people  
peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for  
a redress of grievances.”  
  
In the attempts to vindicate the “Sedition Act,” it has  
been contended, 1. That the “ freedom of the press ™ is to  
be determined by the meaning of these terms in the com-  
mon law. %. That the article supposes the power over th:  
press to be in Congress, and prehibits them only from  
abridging the freedom allowed to it by the common law.  
  
Although it will be shewn, on examiming the second ot  
these positions, that the amendment is a denial to Congress  
of all power over the press, it may not be useless to mak  
the following observations on the first of them.  
  
It is deemed to be a sound opinion, that the Sedition Act,  
in its definition of some of the crimes created, is an abridg-  
mentof the freedom of publication, recognized by princ!-  
ples of the common law in England.  
  
‘Lhe freedom of the press, uader the common law, is iu  
the defences of the Sedition Act, made to consist in an ex-  
emption fromal! previous restraint on printed publications,  
by persons authorised to inspect and prohibit them. It ap-  
pears to the Committee, that this idea of the freedom 0!  
the press, can never be admitted to be the American idea of  
it: since a law inflicting penalties on printed publications,  
would have a similar effect with a law authorising a previous  
restraint on them. It would seem a mockery to say, that  
no laws should be passed, preventing publications from be-  
ing made, but that laws might be passed for punishing them  
in case they should be made.  
  
The essential difference between the British Govern-  
ment, and the American Constitutions, will place this sub-  
ject in the clearest light.  
  
In the British Government, the danger of encroachments  
on the rights of the people, is understood to be confined to  
the Executive Magistrate. The representatives of the  
people in the legislature, are not only exempt themselves,  
from distrust, but are considered as sufficient guardians  
of the rights of their constituents against the danger from the  
Executive. Hence it is a principle, that the Parliament is  
unlimited in its power; or, in their own language, is omnt.  
potent. Hence, too, all the ramparts for protecting the  
rights of the people, such as their Magna Charta, their Bul  
of rights, &amp;c. are not reared against the Parliament, but  
against the royal prerogative. They are merely legislative  
precautions, against Executive usurpations. Under such  
a Government as this, an exemption of the press from pre-  
  
vious restraint by licensers appointed by the King, is all the  
freedom that can be secured to it.  
  
In the United States, the case is altogether different.---  
The People, not the Government, possess the absolute sov

United States, on the authority  
  
s this law relates to every subject of legislation, and would  
  
ew-model the whole political fabric of the country.  
From the review thus taken of the situation of the Amer-  
  
assage in the existing Constitution from which the com-  
  
es in extending the powers of the Federal Government,  
nd in superseding the authorities of the State Govern-

xpectation that the same conclusion will finally be drawn  
yy all candid and accurate inquirers into the subject. ft  
s, indeed, distressing to reflect, that it ever should have  
cen made a question, whether the Constitution, on the  
vhole face of which is seen so much labor to enumerate  
  
end to introduce in the lump, in an indirect manner, and  
»y a forced construction of a few phrases, the vast and inul-  
ifarious jurisdiction involved in the common law; a law  
  
ire field of legislation; and a law that would sap the foun-  
lation of the Constitution as asystem of limited and speci-  
ied powers. &lt;A severer reproach could not, in the opinion

They will waste but litle time on the attempt to cove!  
irary to every acknowledged rule of construction, to set up  
  
lug, expressed in the body of the instrument. A preamble  
usually contains the general motives or reasons, for the par-  
uuculur regulations or measures which follow it; and is al-  
ways understood to be explained and limited by them. In  
the present instance, a contrary interpretation would have  
the inadimissible effect, of rendering nugatory or improper,  
every part of the Consiitution which succeeds the pream-  
ble.  
  
The paragraph in Art. 1 Sec. 8, which contains the  
power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and ex-  
cises; to pay the debts, and provide for the common de-  
fence and general welfare, having been already examined,  
will also require no pariicular attention in this place. It  
will have been seen that in its fair and consistent meaning,  
it cannot enlarge the enumerated powers vested in Con-  
eress.  
  
The part of the Constitution which seems most to be  
recurred to, in delence of the “Sedition Act,” is the last  
clause of the above section, empowering Congress “to  
make all Jaws which shall be necessary and proper for  
carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all  
other powers vested by this Constitution in the Govern-  
ment of the United States, or in any d+partment or officer  
thereof.”  
  
The plain import of this clause is, that Congress shall  
have all the incidental or instrumental powers, necessary  
and proper for carrying into execution all the express  
powers; whether they be vested in the government of the  
United States, more collectively, or in the several depart-  
ments, or officers thereof. It is nota grant of new powers  
to Congress, but merely a declaration, for the removal of  
all uncertainty, that the means of carrying into execution,  
those otherwise granted, are included in the grant. |  
  
Whenever, therefore, a question arises concerning the  
constitutionality of a particular power, the first question  
is, whether the power be expressed in the Constitu-  
tion. If it be, the question is decided. If it be not ex-  
pressed, the next inquiry must be, whether it is properly  
an incident to an express power, and necessary to its ex-  
ecution. If it be, it may be exercised by Congress. If  
itbe not, Congress cannot exercise it.  
  
Let the question be asked then, whether the power over  
the press, exercised in the “Sedition Act,” be found among  
the powers expressly vested in the Congress? This is not  
pretended.  
  
Is thereany express power, for executing which, it is a  
necessary and proper power?  
  
The power which has been selected, as least remote, in  
answer to this question, is that “of suppressing imsurrec-  
tions,” which is said to imply a power to prevent insur-  
rections, by punishing whatever may lead or tend to them.  
But it surely cannot, with the least plausibility, be said,  
that the regulation of the press, and a punishment of libels,  
are exercises of a power to suppress insurrections. The  
most that could be said, would be, that the puaishment of  
libels, if it had the tendency ascribed to it, might prevent  
the occasion of passing or executing laws, necessary and  
  
proper for the Ne pa of insurrections. ereignty. The legislature, no less than the executive, is  
as the Federal Government no power then, to prevent | under limitations of power. Encroachments are ee

on the point in controv ersy. The reso­  
lution having taken this view of the fed­  
eral compact proceeds to infer “ that it  
case ot a deliberate, palpable, and dan­  
gerous exercise of other powers, not  
granted by the said compact, the States  
who are parties thereto have the right,  
and are in duty bound to interpose for  
arresting the progress of the evil, and  
for maintaining within their respective  
limits, the authorities, rights and liber­  
ties appertaining to them.”  
“ ft appears co your committee to be  
a plain principle, founded on common  
sense, illustrated by common practice,  
and essential to the nature of compacts  
—that where resort ran he had to no  
tribunal, superior to the authority of the  
parties, the parties themselves must be the  
rightful judges in the last; itisort, wheth­  
er the bargain made has been pursued  
or violated. The Constitution of the  
  
u. Males was termed by the sanction of  
the States, given by each in itsSovereign  
capacity, it adds to the stability and  
dignity, as well as to the authority of  
the Constitution, that it rests on this le­  
gitimate and solid foundation. The  
States, then, being the parties to the  
Constitutional compact, and in their  
sovereign capacity, it follows of neccssi­  
ty, that there can be no tribunal above  
their authority, to decide in the Inst re­  
sort, whether the compact made by  
them be violated, and consequently, that  
as the parties to it, they must themselves  
decide, in the last resort, such questions  
as may be of sufficient magnitude to re  
j quire their interposition.”  
| “The resolution has guarded against  
any misapprehension of its object, by  
expressly requiring for such an interpo  
sition “ the case of a deliberate, palpable  
and dangerous breach of the Constitu­  
tion, by the exercise of powers not grant­  
ed by it.” It must be a case, not of a  
light and transient nature, hut of a na­  
ture dangerous to the great purposes for  
which the Constitution was established.  
“ But the resolution has done more  
than guard against misconstruction, by  
expressly referring to cases of a deliber­  
ate, palpable, and dangerous nature.—  
It specifies the object of the interposi­  
tion, which it contemplates to be solely  
that of arresting the progress of the e­  
vil of usurpation, and of maintaining the  
authorities, rights, and liberties, apper­  
taining to the States, as parties to the  
Constitution.”  
“ Prom this view of the resolution, it  
would seem inconceivable that it can in­  
cur any just disapprobation from tnose  
who, laying aside all momentary impres­  
sions, and recollecting the genuine source  
and object of the federal constitution,  
shall candidly and accurately interpret  
the meaning of the general assembly, if  
the deliberate exercise of dangerous  
powers, palpably withheld by the con­  
stitution, could not justify the parties to  
it, in interposing even so far as to arrest  
the progress of the evil, and thereby to  
preserve the constitution itself, as well  
as to provide for the safety of tiie parties  
to it, there would be an end to all relief  
from usurped power, and a direct sub­  
version of the rights specified or recog­  
nized under ail the state constitutions,  
as well as a plain denial of the fundament

the poimt in controversy. The resolution, having taken this view of the  
fecieral compact, proceeds to infer ‘that in case of a deliberate, palpa-  
‘bie, and dangerous exercise of other powers, not granted by the said  
‘compact, the States who are parties thereto have the right, and are im  
‘duty bound, to interpose for arresting the progress of the evil, and for  
‘maintuming within their respective limits, the authorities, rights, aud  
‘liberties appertaming to them.  
  
*“** It appears to your comuaittee to be a plain principle founded in com-  
‘mon sense, ilustrated by common practice, and essential to the na-  
‘ture of compacts, that where resort can be had to no tribunal, superior  
‘to the authority of the parties, the parties themselves must be the right-  
‘ful judges in the last resort, whether the bargain made has been per-  
‘verted or violated. ‘The Constitution of the United States was formed  
‘by the sanction of the States, given by each in its sovereign capacity,  
‘It adds to the stability and dignity, as well as to the authority of the  
‘Constitution, that it rests upon this legitimate and solid foundation.  
‘The States then, being the parties to the Constitutional compact, and  
‘in their sovereign capacity, it follows of necessity, that there can be no  
‘tribunal above their authority, to decide, in the last resort, whether the  
‘compact made by them be violated; and, consequently, that, as the  
‘ parties to it, they imust themselves decide, inthe last resort, such ques-  
‘tions as may be of sufficrent maguitude to require their interposition.’  
  
“&lt;The resolution has guarded against any nusapprehension of its  
‘object, by expressly requiring tor sach an interposition, ‘the case of a  
‘ deliberate, palpable and dangerous breach of the Constitution, by the  
‘exercise of powers not granted by it Ht must be a case, not of a light  
‘and transient nature, but of a nature dangerous to the great purposes  
‘for which the Constitution was established.  
  
** But the resolution has done more than guard against misconstrue-  
‘tion, by expressly referring to cases of a deliberate, palpable and dan-  
‘gerous vature. It specifies the object of the interposition which it  
  
‘contemplates, to be solely that of arresting the progress of the evil of  
  
‘usurpation, and of maintaining the authorities, rights and liberties ap-  
‘ pertaining to the States, as parties to the Constitution.  
  
*** From this view of the resolution, it would seem inconceivable that  
‘it can ineur any just disapprobation from those, who, laying aside all  
‘momentary impressions, and recollecting the genuine source and ob-  
‘ject of the Federal Constitution, shall candidly and accurately inter-  
‘pret the meaning of the General Assembly. Uf the deliberate exercise  
‘of dangerous powers, palpably withheld by the Constitution, could not  
* justify the parties to it, in interposing even so far as to arrest the pro-  
‘gress of the evil, and thereby to preserve the Constitution itself, as  
‘well as to provide for the safety of the parties to it, there would be an  
‘end to all relief from usurped power, and a direct subversion of the  
‘rights specitied or recognized under all the State Constitutions, as well  
‘as a plain denial of the fundamental principles on which our indepen-  
‘dence itself was declared.’

The first resolution recites the scope and object of all of  
them. It contains the emphatic declaration—* that the Gene-  
neral Assembly of Virginia doth unequivocally express a firm re-  
solution to maintain and defend the Constitution of the United  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
176 Debate on Mr. Foot’s Resolution. | Aug.  
  
States, against every aggression, either foreign cr domestic, and  
that they will support the Government of the United States in all  
measures warranted by the former. Mr. Madison then remarks,  
“that no unfavourable comment can have been made on the  
sentiment here expressed. To maintain and defend the Consti-  
tution of the United States, and of their own State, against  
every aggression, both foreign and domestic, and to support  
the Government in all measures warranted by their Constitu-  
tion, are duties which the General Assembly ought always to  
feel, and to which, on such occasions, it was evidently proper to  
express their sincere and firm adherence.”  
  
The next resolution affirms that ‘the General Assembly  
most solemnly declares a warm attachment to the Union of the  
States, to maintain which, it pledges all its powers, and that, for  
this end, it 1s their duty to watch over and oppose every infrac-  
tion of those princiciples ‘which constitute the only basis of that  
Union, because a faithful observance of them can alone secure its  
existence, and the public happiness.”” Upon this resolution, Mr.  
Madison further remarks—‘* the observation just made is  
equally applicable to this solemn declaration of warm attach-  
ment to the Union, and this solemn pledge to maintain it. Nor  
can any question arise among enlightened friends of the Union,  
as to the duty of watching over and opposing every infraction  
of those principles which constitute its basis, and a faithful ob-  
servance of which, can alone secure its existence, and the pub-  
lic happiness thereon depending.”  
  
The objects then most distinctly and unequivocally recited  
in these resolutions, are, “to maintain and defend the Constitution  
of the United States and the Union of tre States.-—By what  
means ?—Let the 3d resolution answer this question: ‘ That  
this Assembly doth explicitly and peremptorily declare, that  
it views the powers of the Federal Government, as resuiting  
from the compuct to which the States are parties, as limited  
by the plain sense and intention of the instrument constitut-  
ing that compact, as no farther valid, than they are authorized by

Mr. Madison says—* It appears to your committee to be a plain  
principle founded on common sense, illustrated by common  
practice, and essential to the nature of compacts, that where a  
resort can be had to no tribunal superior to the authority of the  
parties, the parties themselves must be the rightful judges,  
the last resort, whether the bargain made, has been perverted or  
violated. ‘The Constitution of the United States was formed  
by the sanction of the States, cach in its sovereign capacity. It  
adds to the stability and dignity, as weli as to the authority of the  
Constitution, that it rests upon this legitimate and solid found-  
ation. ‘The States then, being the parties to the constitutional  
compact, aud in their sovereign capacity, it follows of necessity,  
that there can be no tribunal above their authority, to decide in  
the last resort, whether the compact made by them be violated ;  
and consequently that as parties to it, they must themselves de-  
cide, tn the last resort, such questions as may be of sufficient  
magnitude to require their interposition.”  
  
And again, in continuation, he remarks :—* The resolution  
has guarded against misconstruction by expressly referring to  
cases of a ‘deliberate, palpable and dangerous nature.’ It spe-  
cifies the object of the interposition, which it contemplates to be  
solely that of arresting the progress of the evil of usurpation,  
and of maintaining the authorities, rights and liberties apper-  
taining to the States, as parties to the Constitution.”

“ That it is objected, that the judicial authority is to be regarded as  
the sole expositor of the Constitution in the last resort ; and it may be  
asked for what reason, the declaration by the General Assembly, sup-  
posing it to be theoretically true, could be required at the present day.  
and in so solemn a manner.  
  
“On this objection it might be observed, first: that there may be  
instances of usurped power, which the forms of the Constitution would  
never draw within the control of the judicial department: secondly, that  
if the decision of the judiciary be raised above the authority of the so-  
vereign parties to the Constitution, the decisions of the other depart-  
ments, not carried by the forms of the Constitution before the judiciary,  
must be equally authoritative and final with the decisions of that depart-  
ment. But the proper answer to the objection is, that the resolution  
of the General Assembly relates to those great and extraordinary cases,  
in which all the forms of the Constitution may prove ineffectual against  
the infractions dangerous to the essential rights of the parties to it.  
The resolution supposes that dangerous powers not delegated, may not  
only be usurped and executed by the other departments, but that the  
judicial department also, may exercise or sanction dangerous powers  
beyond the grant of the Constitution, and consequently, that the ulti-  
mate right of the parties to the Constitution, to judge whether the com-  
pact has been dangerously violated, must extend to violations by  
one delegated authority, as well as by another ; by the judiciary, as  
well as by the executive, or the legislative.”

*99, to show, that thesc views, whether right or  
wrong, were the views of the fathers of the demo-  
cratic party; and if lerr, lerr with the Piatos’ and  
Socrates’ of my political faith. (Virg. Res. p. 8.)  
  
‘The other position involved in this branch of the re-  
solution, namely, ‘‘that the states are not parties to  
ihe constitution or compact,’’ is, in the judgment of  
the committee, equaliy free from objection. dt is  
indeed true that that the term ‘states’ is sometimes  
used in a vague sense, and sometimes in different  
senses, according to the subject to which it is applied.  
Thus it sometitues means the separate sections occu-  
pied by the political societies within each; some-  
times the particular governments, established by those  
societies; sometimes those societies as organized in-  
to those particular governments; and lastly, it means  
the people compvsing those politica! societies, in their  
highest political sovereign capacity. Avthough it  
might be w.shed that the perfection of* language  
admitted less diversity in the signification of the  
same word3, yetliitle inconveniency is produced by  
it, where the true sense can be collected with cer-  
tuinty from the different applications. In the present  
instance, whatever different constructions of the  
term ‘states,’ in the resolution, may have been en-  
tertuined, all will at least concur in that last mene  
tioned, because in that sense the constituuon was  
submitted to the ‘states;’ in that sense the ‘states’ ra-  
tified it; and in that sense the term ‘states,’ they are  
consequently parties to the compact from which the  
powers of the federal government result.”

both necessary and proper.  
  
‘To find an objection, then, it must be shown that some  
meaning was annexed to these general terms, which was not  
proper ; and, for this purpose, either that the means used by the  
General Assembly were an example of improper means, or that  
there were no proper means to which the terms could refer.  
  
‘In the example given by the State, of declaring the alien  
and sedition acts to be unconstitutional, and of communicating  
the declaration to the other States, no trace of improper means  
has appeared. And if the other States had concurred in making  
a like declaration, supported too by the numerous applications  
flowing immediately from the people, it can scarcely be doubted,  
that these simple means would have been as sufficient, as they  
are unexceptionable.  
  
‘It is no less certain, that other means might have been em-  
ployed, which are strictly within the limits of the Constitution.  
The Legislatures of the States might have made a direct repre-  
sentation to Congress, with a view to obtain a rescinding of the  
two offensive acts; or, they might have represented to their re-  
spective Senators in Congress, their wish, that two thirds thereof  
would propose an explanatory amendment to the Constitution ;  
or two thirds of themselves, if such had been their option, might,  
by an application to Congress, have obtained a convention for  
the same object.  
  
‘These several means, though not equally eligible in them-  
selves, nor probably, to the States, were all constitutionally open  
for consideration. And if the General Assembly, after declaring  
the two acts to be unconstitutional, the first and most obvious  
proceeding on the subject, did not undertake to point out to the  
other States, a choice among the farther measures that might be-  
come necessary and proper, the reserve will not be misconstrued  
by liberal minds into any culpable imputation.’  
  
  
  
Here we see what sort of means were contemplated. They  
were, first, declarations that the laws were unconstitutional ;  
secondly, direct representations from the Legislatures of the  
States to Congress, to obtain the repeal of the laws; thirdly

cannot be denied to it, from the relation of the Slat,

“The Legislatures of the States have a right also to

&quot; I* appears to your conuai&#x27;t’e to he a plain piinci­  
plo, founded in common s^nse, illurtrati d by common  
practice, and essential to tha na&#x27;ur# of compartr; that  
where rased can be had to no tribunal, superior to the  
authority of the parties, the parlies themselves must he  
the rightful judge* in flic last resort, whether the bar­  
gain made lias been pursued or violated. The consti­  
tution ot tho United S&#x27;atcs was formed by the (auction  
of the state*, given by- each in its sovereign rapacity.  
It adds to the stability *u4 dignity, as well ns to the au­  
thority of the constitution, Hint it rests on thi* legitimate  
and solid foundation. The state*, then, being the par­  
ties to the constitutional compact, and In their sove­  
reign capacity, it follow* of necessity, that there can  
I he no tribunal above their authority, to decide in the  
|/nsf resort, ichither the compart made by them be vio­  
luted&#x27;, *nd consequently, that, as the parties to it, they  
must thamtelves decids, in the last resort, surh qurs­  
ti. ns, a* may lie &amp;f-ufTirient magnitude to require their  
interposition.  
  
it does not billow*, however, that because llu»  
slates, ns sovereign n»rties »o their ronstiintionnl coir —  
pact, must ultimately decide whether it has been via­  
luted, that sorb a decision ought to tie interposed, ei­  
ther in a hasty manner, or on doubtful and inferior oc­  
va-ioni. Even in tlio esse cl ordinary conventions be­  
tween different nation*, where, by tho strict rule of  
interpretation, a breach of a part may be deemed a  
breach of the whole; every part being deemed a condi­  
tion of every other part, and of tho w h ile, if is always  
Inid down that the breach must be both wilful and mV  
ferial to justify an application of the rule. But in the  
case of an Intimate and constitutional union, like that  
o( the United States, it is evident that tho interposition  
of the parties, in th*ir sovereign capacity, can be celled  
(or by occasions only, deeply «nd essentially affecting  
the vital principlesol their political system.  
”1 ho resolution has accordingly guarded against any  
misapprehension ol its object, by expressly requit ir-g for  
such an interposition, •• thoca^eol a d lib, t ate. palpa­  
ble and dangerous breach of the constitution, by tho  
exercise of powers not granted by it.” It must lie a  
case, not ol a light and transient nature, but o( a nature  
dangerous to the great purposes for which the consti­  
tution was established. It must be a rase, moreover,  
not obscure or doubtful in its construction, but plain and  
palpable. I.aslly, it must be a case not resulting from  
a partial consideration, or hasty determination; but a  
case stninpt with a final consideration and deliberate  
adherence. It is not m ressary, because the resolution  
does not require, that the qtles&#x27;ion should be discussed,  
liow far the exercise of any particular power, ungrant­  
ed by the constitution, would justify tlie interposition of  
the par&#x27;ies to it. As ca«cs might easily b&gt;* stated, which  
none would contend ought to fall within ihat descrip­  
tion; esses, on the other hand, might, witji equal ease,  
be staled, so flagrant and so fatal, as to unite every opin­  
ion in placing them within the description.  
“ But the resolution has done more than guard a ■  
gainst misconstruction, by expressly referring to cases  
of a deliberate, palpable and dangerous nature. It  
specifics the object of the interposition which it con­  
templates, to be solely that ol arresting the progress oi  
Ihs evil of usurpation, and of maintaining the authori­  
ties, rights and liberties appertaining to tho slatvs, as  
parties to tho constitution.  
  
* tom mis view oi the resolution, it would seem  
inconceivable that it can incur any just disapprobation  
from those, who laying a*ide all momen&#x27;ary impres­  
sions, and reeellccting the genuine source and object  
of (bo federal constitution, shall candidly and accurate­  
ly interpret the meaning of (be General Assembly. If  
tbe deliberate exercise of dangerous power*, palpably  
withheld by the Constitution, could not justify the par­  
ties to it, in interposing even so /ar as to arrest the pro­  
gress r.f the evil, and iheitihy to preserve the constitu­  
tion itself, as we II as to provide lor the safety of the par­  
ties to It; there would be an end to all re.liel trom usurp­  
ed power, and a direct subversion of the rights speci­  
fied or recognized under all the state constitution*, as  
well a* e plain denial of the fundamental principle on  
which onr independence itself was declared  
&quot; But il is objected that tile judicial authority is to  
bo regarded as the sole expositor of the constitution, in  
the last resort; and it may be a*ked lor what reason,  
tbe declaration by the General Assembly, supposing it  
to he theoretically true, could be required at tbe pie­  
»eut day anti in so solemn a manner.  
“ On this objection it might he observed,Jfmf, that  
there may be instances of usurped power, which (ho  
forms of the constitution would never draw within the  
control ol the judicial department: teeondhf, that il the  
decision ol lliejudiciary he raised above the authority  
of the sovereign pirlte* to the constitution, the deci­  
sions of the other departments, not carried by the forms  
of the constitution before tbe judiciary must be equal­  
ly aulborata&#x27;ive and final with tbe derisions of that  
depat Intent. Hut the proper answer to the o bjsction  
is, that tbe resolut on of the General A-&#x27;.»emblv relates  
to those great and exoaerdlnary ca«e*. In which all the  
forms ol lb** constilmi n inay prove iulfecltial against  
infractions dangerous to the essential rights of (he par­  
ties lo it. The resolution supposes that dangerous  
powers not delegated, may not only be usurped  
and executed by tbe o her departments, but (bat  
the judicial department also may exercise or sanc­  
tion dangerous powers beyond Inc grant of the con­  
stitution; and consequently tlial the ultimate right of I ho  
parties to the constitution, to judge whether the com­  
pact ha* been dangerously violated, must extend to vio­  
lation1* by one delegated milhority. as well n&lt; by ano­  
ther; by tlic judiciary, as well ashy the executive, or  
llie legislature.  
“However true therefore it may lie that ths judicial  
department, is, in till questions submitted to it by the,  
I irms of the constitution, to decide in the last re sot t. this  
r ■ -or* must necessarily he deemed the last in relation to  
toe authorities of the other departments of the govern  
no lit; not in relation lolhe rights of the parlies to the  
constitutional compart, from which the judicial as well  
a* th*1 other departments hold (her delegated trusts. On

which wore generally rereivc-1 at tho adoption of the  
Constitution. Mr. Madison’s Report show* in the clear­  
«st manner the right of tho State Legislatures to inter­  
fere on all due occasions. “It cannot be forgotten,  
(says that Report,) that among tho arguments addressed  
to those who apprehended danger to liberty from the es­  
tablishment of the General Government over #o great a  
country, tho appeal was cmphatica&#x27;ly made to die inter­  
mediate existence of the State Governments, between  
the people and (hat government, to the rigilaneo with  
which they would descry the first symptoms of iinsur­  
pation, and to the promptitude with which they would  
sound tho alarm to the people. This argument was pro­  
bably not without its efFect; and if it w as a proper one  
then, to recommend the establishment of tho Constitu­  
tion, it must be a proper one now, to assist in its inter­  
pretation.&quot;—The pages of the Federalist abound with

&quot;This certainly amounts to an assertion,  
that there is no provision to expound the  
compact between the original parties,  
the States.  
  
In 1799, Mr. Madison denies that “the  
judicial authority isto be regarded as the  
sole expositor of the Constitution in the |  
last resort in relation to the rights of the  
partics to the Constitution,’ and he goes  
into his reasons atlength. As inthe case  
of ordinary treaties between different na-  
tions, he thinks, that “the interposition  
of the States in their sovereign capacity  
can only be called tor by occasions, es-  
sentially affecting the vital principles of  
their political system.”

“ dangerous powers not delegated is, that  
the ultimate right of the parties to the  
Constitution (the States) to judge whe-

mediately on the point in controversy. The resolution, having taken  
this view of the federal compact, proceeds to infer—  
  
“That, in case of a deliberate, palpable, and dangerous exercise, of  
‘other powers, not granted by the said compact, the States who are  
‘ parties thereto have the right, and are in daty bound, to interpose for  
arresting the progress of the evil, and for maintamimg, within their  
respective limits, the authorities, rights, and liberties, appertaining to  
them.  
  
“Itappears to your Committee to be a plain principle, founded in  
common sense, ilustrated by common practice, and essential to the  
nature of compacts, that. where resort can be had te no tribunal sa-  
‘ perior to the authority of the parties, the parties themselves must be the  
‘ rightful judges, in the last resort, whether the bargain made has been  
‘perverted or violated. The Constitution of the United States was  
  
formed by the sanction of the States given by each in its sovereign  
‘capacity. In adds to the stability and dignity, as well as ‘o the au-  
thority of the Constitution, that it rests apon this legitimate and solid  
‘foundation. ‘The St. ‘°s, then, being the parties to the constitutional  
compact, and in their sovereign capacity, it follows, of necessity, that  
there can be no tribunal abore their authority, to decide, in the last re-  
‘sort, whether the compact made by them be violated; and, conse-  
* quentiv, that, as the parties to it, they must themselves decide. in the  
last resort, such questions as may be of sufficient magnitude to require  
their interposition.  
  
“The resolution has guarded against any misapprehension of its  
object. by expressly requiring, for such an interposition, “ the case of  
a deliberate, palpable, and dangerous breach, of the Constitution, by  
the exercise of powers not granted by it.” It must be a case. not of a  
light and transient nature, but of a nature dangerous to the great pur-  
‘ poses for which the Constitution was established.  
  
“ Bot the resolution has done more than guard against misconstrne-  
‘ tion. by expressly referring to cases of a deltherate, palpable, aud dan-  
gerous wature. It speerfies the object of the interposition which it con-  
templates, to be solely that of arresting the progress of the evil of usur-  
pation, and of maiotaiuing the authorities, nghts, and liberties apper-  
taining to the States, as parties to the Constitution.  
  
‘* From this view of the resolation, it would seem inconceivable that  
jt can incur any just disapprobation trom those, who, laying aside all  
‘momentary impressions, and recollecting the genume source and ob-  
ject of the Federal Constitution, shall candidly and accurately inter-  
pret the meaning of the General Assembly. If the deliberate exer-  
cise of dangerous powers, palpably withheld by the Constitution,  
‘could not justify the parties to it in interposing even so far as to arrest  
‘the progress of the evil, and thereby to preserve the Constitution it-  
self. as well as to provide for the safety of the parties to it. there  
would be an end to all relief from usurped power, and a direct sub-  
version of the mgbts specitied or recognized ander all the State Con  
stitutions, as well as a plain denial of the fundamental principles ou  
which our independence itself was declared.”

‘that no unfavorable comment can have been made on the sen-  
timent here expressed. To maintain and defend the Constitu-  
tion of the United States, and of their own State, against every  
aggression, both foreign and domestic, and to support the Go-  
vernment io all measures warranted by their Constitution, are  
duties which the General Assembly ought always to feel, and  
to which, on such occasions, it was evidently proper to express  
their sincere and firm adherence.”  
  
The next resolution affirms that “the General Assembly  
most solemnly declares a warm attachment to the Union of the  
States, to maintain which, it pledges all tts powers, and that, for  
this end, it is their duty to watch over_and oppose every infraction  
of those principles which constitute the only basis of that Union,  
because a faithful observance of them can alone secure tis existence,  
and the public happiness.” Upon this resolution, Mr. Madison  
further remarks—** the observation just made is equally appli-  
cable to this solemn declaration of warm attachment to tbe  
Union, and this solemn pledge to maintain it. Nor can any  
question arise among enlightened friends of the Union, as to  
the duty of watching over and opposing every infraction of  
those principles which constitute tts basis, and a faithful ob-  
servauce of which, can alone secure its existence, and the pub-  
lic happiness thereon depending.”  
  
The objects then most distinetly and unequivocally recited  
in these resolutions, are, ‘to maintain and defend the Constiin-  
tion of the United States and the Union of the States.” By  
what means! Let the 3d resolution answer this question:  
“ That this Assembly doth erplicitly and peremptorily declare  
that it views the powers of the Federal Government, as resulting  
  
from the compact to which the States are parties, as limited by  
  
the plain sense and intention of the instrument constituting that  
compact, as no farther valid, than they are authorized by the  
grants enumerated in that compact

of our readers. Mr. Madison says—* It appears to your Com-  
mittee to be plain principle founded on commen sense, illus-  
trated by common practice, and essential to the nature of com-  
pacts, that where a resort can be had to no tribunal superior to  
the authority of the parties, the parties themselves must be the  
rightful Sedona in the last resort, whether the bargain made  
has been perverted or violated. The Constitution of the United

as to the authority of the Constitution, that it rests upon this  
legitimate and solid foundation. ‘The States, then, being the  
parties to the constitutional compact, and in their sovereigu  
capacity, it follows of necessity, that there cau be no tribunal  
  
hove their Guthority, to decide im the last resort, whether the  
compact made by them be violated; and cousequeutly, that as  
parties to it, they must themselves decide, in the last resort,  
such questions as may be of sufficient maguitude to require their  
interposiuon.  
  
Aud again. in coutinuation, he remarks: “ The resolution  
  
» guarded against misconstruction, by expressly referring to  
cases of a“ deliberate, palpable, and dangerous nature.” ty  
pecifies the object of the interposition, which it contemplates  
to be solely that of arresting the progress of the evil of usur-

“That is the object, that the judicial authority is to be re-  
garded as the sole expositor of the Constitution in the last re-  
sort; and it may be asked for what reason, the declaration by  
the General Assembly, supposing it to be theoretically true,  
could be required at the present day, and in so solemn a  
inanner.  
  
“On this objection it might be observed, first: that there may  
be instances of usurped power, which the forms of the Con-  
stitution would never draw within the control of the judicial  
department: secondly, that if the decision of the judiciary be  
raised above the authority of the sovereign parties to the Con-  
stitution, the decisions of the other departments, not carried  
by the forms of the Constitution before the judiciary, must be  
equally authoritative and final with the decisions of that depart-  
ment. ut the proper answer to the objection is, that the re-  
solution of the General Assembly relates to those great and  
extraordinary cases, in which all the forms of the Constitution  
may prove ineflectual against the infractions dangerous to the  
essential rights of the parties to it. The resolution supposes  
that dangerous powers not delegated, may not ouly be usurped  
and executed by the other departmeuts, but that the judicial  
department also, may exercise or sanetion dangerous powers  
beyond the grant of the Constitution, and consequently, that  
the ultimate right of the parties to the Constitution, to judge  
whether the compact has been dangerously violated, must ex-  
tend to violations by ove delegated authority, as well as by  
another; by the judiciary, as well as by the executive, or the  
legislative.”  
  
Nor is the authority of Mr. Jefferson less explicit, when in  
the Neutucky Resolutions, he says: * the Government, creat-  
ed by the compact, was not made the exclusive or final judge  
of the extent of the powers delegated to itself, since that would  
have made its discretion, and not the Constitution, the measure  
of its powers.’ In truth, it must be conceded, aud cannot be  
denied, if Mr. Webster’s theory of our Government be correct,  
itis a Government limited by nothing more than the discretion  
of the Supreme Court

this cardinal axiom of constitutional law, that, “‘ however true it may be,  
that the jadicial department is, in all questions submitted to it, by the  
forms of the Constitution, to decide in the last resort, this resort must  
necessarily be deemed the last in relation to the authorities of the other  
departments of the Government, not in relation té the rights of the par-  
ties to the constitutional compact.”

which it i* supported. The following are extract* from  
In* Report:  
‘‘The expression, &quot;cases in law and equity,” is ma­  
nifestly confined to caacs of a civil nature; and would  
exclude case* of criminal jurisdiction. Criminal cases  
law^ *Dl* ,**&#x27;1**^ would bo a language unknown to tlie  
&quot;The succeeding paragraph of the same aection is  
In harmony with this construction. It is in these words:  
&quot;In all cases affecting Ambassadors, other,public Min­  
uter*, and Consuls, and those in which a State shall  
bo a party, the Supreme Court shall have original ju­  
risdiction. I&#x27;l all tlie other cases [including cases in  
law and equity arising under the Constitution] the Su­  
preme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction both as to  
law and fad; with such exception*, and under sucli  
regulations, as Congress shall make.  
&quot;This paragraph, by expressly giving an appellate  
Jurisdiction, in cases ol law and equity arising under  
tha Constitution, to fact, as well as to law, clearly ex­  
clu&lt;le9 criminal caae*, whoro the trial by jury is secur­  
ed; becauso the fact, in such case*, is not a subject of  
appeal. And, although tlie appeal is liable to such ex­  
ceptions and regulations as Congress may adopt, yet it  
Is not to lie supposed that an exception of all criminal  
case* could bo contemplated; as well, becauso a discre­  
tion in Congress to make or omit the exception would  
be improper, as because it would have been unnecessa­  
ry- Tlie exception could as easily have been made by  
the Constitution itself, as referred to the Congress.  
&quot;Once more; tlie amendment last added to the Con­  
stitution, deserves attention, as throwing light on this  
subject. &quot;The Judicial power of the United States  
shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or  
«yw‘fy» commenced or prosecuted against one of the U.  
States, by citizens of another State, or by citizens or  
subjects of any foreign power.” As it wiH not he pre­  
tended that any criminal proceeding could take place  
against a State; the terms law or equity, must be un­  
derstood as appropriate to civil, in exclusion ol crimi­  
nal cases.  
  
I rom inesc considerations, it is evident, that this  
part of tho Constitution, even if it could be applied at  
all, to the purpose for which it has been cited, would  
not include any cases whatever of a criminal nature;  
and consequently, would not authorise the inference  
from It, that the Judicial authority extends to offences  
against the common law, as offences arising under the  
Constitution.”  
The ca.e of Ta«srls, therefore, cannot e?me within

properly an incident to any express power, and neces-  
siry to its execution. That, if continued and acquiesced  
in as construed by the supreme court, it raises the de-  
cision of the judiciary above the authority of the sove-  
reign parties to the constitution, may be a warrant for  
the assumption of powers not delegated in the other de-  
yartments, nor carried by the forms of the constitution  
efore the judicial department, and whose decisions  
would be equally authoritative and final with the decisions  
of that department.  
  
However, therefore, it may be admitted or denied, that  
the judicial department ot the federal government is,  
in all questions submitted to it by the forms of the con-  
stitution, to decide in the last resort in relation to the au-  
thorities of the other departments of that government,  
it can never be authorised so to decide in relation to the  
rights of the parties to the constitutional compact, from  
which the judicial, as well as the other departments,  
hold their delegated trusts; on any other hypothesis,  
the delegation of judicial power would annul the power  
delegating it, and the concurrence of this department in  
usurped powers might subvert forever, and beyond the  
possible reach of any rightful remedy, the very consti-  
tution which all were instituted to preserve.”  
  
**The aathority of constitutions over governments, |  
and the sovereignty of the people over constitutions, are |  
truths at all times necessary to be kept in mind,”* and  
itis matter of regret to the committee, that it should  
ever have been asserted, that the constitution, on whose  
face is seen so much labor to enumerate and define the  
several objects of federal power, could intend to intro-  
duce in the lump, in an indirect manner, and by a forced  
construction, the vast and multiform jurisdiction involved  
in the section of the law under consideration—a jurisdic-  
tion overshadowing the entire field of their legislation  
and adjudication—a jurisdiction that saps the foundation  
of the constitution, as a system of limited and specified  
  
  
  
  
  
powers—obliterates the sovereignty of so many repub-  
lics, renowned for their defiance of tyranny, and whos

rights) “tliat the Judicial authority is to be regard­  
ed, as the sole expositor of the Constitution; on this  
objection it might he observed, first, that there  
may be instances of usurped powers, which the  
forms ot the Constitution could never draw within  
the control of the Judicial Department; secondly,  
that it tho decision of the Judiciary he raised above  
the sovereign parties to the Constitution, the decis­  
ions of the other departments, not carried by the  
forms of the Constitution bofore the Judiciary,  
must be equally authoritative, and final with the’  
decision of that Department. Hut the proper an­  
swer to the objection is, that tho resolution of the  
General Assembly relates to those gVeat and extra­  
ordinary eases, in which all of the forms of the  
Constitution may prove ineffectual against infrac­  
tions dangerous to the essential rights of the parties  
to it. The resolution supposes, that dangerous  
powers not delegated, may not only be usurped and  
executed by the other Departments, but that tho  
Judicial Department may also exercise, or sanction  
dangerous powers beyond tho grant of the Consti­  
tution, and consequently that tho ultimate right of  
the parlies to the Constitution to judge, whether  
the compact has been dangerously violated, must  
extend to violations by one delegated authority, as  
well ns by another—by the Judiciary, as well as by  
the Executive or Legislative.”  
A gat n st these conclusive arguments, as they scorn  
to me, it is objected, that if one party has the right  
to judge of infractions of the Constitution, so has  
the other, and that consequently in eases of con­  
tested powers between a State and the General  
Government, each would have a right to maintain  
.t. opinion, ns is the ease when sovereign powers  
differ in the construction of treaties or compacts,

-The other position involved in this  
  
.branch, of the revolution namely, &quot; that

of the committee, equally free from ob

term &quot; States, U sometimes oad In a  
vague sense, and sometimes in different  
senses &#x27; according to the subject to  
Which it ia applied. Thus, it some­  
tioJM meant, the separate sections of

ticular&#x27;, ft-ove&#x27;rnmenti, established by  
those octe.ties aomcliniet those socie­

the stability and dignity, as well as to

not require., thst the question, should  
be diitcuaaed, how far the exercise of

That the General Assembly doth

by wbicb atch a law could be carried  
into operation whilst, ea tht ether  
hand, every auch inference or pretext  
ia absolutely, precluded by articlt 2,

denct, and every power, jurisdiction,  
od right, srhich tt not by hit coafedo­  
ratioa txpreaaly -Jelegtttd to tba Uni­

Thus far it appears, that not a ves­  
tige ef this extraordinary doctrio can  
be, found ia the origin or progress of  
American institutions. :kThe evidence  
aarainst U baa, on the contrary, grown  
stronger1 at tvery step, till it has a­  
mouutacl to o formal and positive ex  
dtsion, by written articles of compact  
ameog tha parties concerned. i ,  
is this exclusion revoked, and the  
coomott law. introdaced aa national  
law; by the present constitution of4he  
United States? t This is the final ques­  
tion to be examined, i f &#x27;.t  
It it readily admitted1, &quot;that particu­  
lar parts of tha eommoQ Jaw may have  
a sanction from tbe Conatitution, to far  
as they are necessarily comprehended  
io fbe technic1.! phrases which expresi  
the powera , delegated to&#x27; the&quot; govern  
ment; and so far alto, a tucb other  
pitlt -may b adopted by Cofigrets tt  
necessary and proper for tarrying into  
execution the powers expressly delegat  
ed. V But, the question, does not relate  
to either f( tbese portions of tbe com­  
mte awr -It relates to the common  
law beyond tbese limitations&#x27;; r &#x27;;, .;  
-.The only part of the Conttttttion  
which aeemt to Jitre been relied on in  
thia case, is the Sd section of Article  
HLt ! The Judicial power shall ex  
tend to all cases;&#x27; in law and equity,  
rising imrfer thi$ Corutitutiont the&#x27; laws  
of; the; United Statet, and Treaties  
made or which shall be made under  
thtirabthority.Bli-i&#x27; 1 n&#x27;;-. .  
It has, been asked, what cases,&#x27; dis  
tinct from (hose arising under the laws  
tnd treaties of the United States, can  
trite under, the Constitutionother than  
thote anting &#x27;under the ommon Jaw,  
iod it is inferred, that the common law  
itlcqordingly adopted or recognized  
by the.Cdnatitption.-y :  
f Never, perhapvuwas so broa&#x27;d a con­  
traction applied to a text to clearly  
Unsusceptible of it. If any colour for  
the inference could be found, it mutt  
be in the impossibility of finding any  
other case in law and equity, within  
the provision! , of (he Constitution to  
Satisfy tha expression; and rather than  
resort lo a construction effecting so est  
teotjally the whole character ol the go­  
vernmentlit Would perhaps&#x27;, be more  
rational to topside, the expression s t  
mere pleonasm or inadvertence. But  
it is not necessary to decide on such a  
dilemma. The expression Is fully satis  
tied, and Its accuracy justified, by two  
descriptions of caset, to which (he ju­  
dicial authority is extended, anteith­  
er ;o&quot;. which .impliet that the common  
law is the! law of , the United pl ates.  
One of these descriptions comprehend  
the Cases growing out of the restrictions  
on . the Legislative power of the Statet  
For example,&quot;&#x27; it is provided that jno  
State sluir emit, blltelof. credit-r  
&quot;make thy&#x27; thing but gold iod &#x27;silver  
coin a f under, in payment of debt:&quot;  
Should this brohibitiort be t ioUfpd: and  
a suit bttween citizen cf the same Slate  
be the,; consequence; this would - be a  
Case arising: under the Constitution be  
fore; the. Judicial power of the United  
States. -A second description compre  
hends suits between citizen and forv  
eigners, of citizens of different 8tates,  
to b decided according to the State or  
foreign laws; but Submitted by the Con-1

I objection it might be observed, first,  
that there may be instances of usurped  
powers which the forms of the Consti­

compact made by them be violated; and, consequently, that, as the par-  
ties to it, they must themselves decide, in the last resort, such questions

“ Bat it is objected, that the Judicial anthortty 1s to be reg irded as the  
sole expositor of the Constitution in the last resort ; and it may be ask-  
ed for what reason the declaration, by the General Assembly, suppos-  
ing it to be theoretically true, could be required at the present day, and  
in so solemn a manner.  
  
Oa this objection it might be observed—First, that there may be tn-  
stances of usurped power, which the forms of the Constitution would  
never draw within the control of the Judicial department.  
that, if the decision of the Judiciary be raised above the authority of the  
sovereign parties to the Constitution, the decisions of the other depart-  
ments, not carried, by the forms of the Constitution, before the Judici-  
ary, must be equally authoritative and final with the decisions of that  
department. But the proper answer to the objection is, that the resolu-  
tion of the General Assembly relates to those great and extraordinary  
cases in which all the forms of the Constitution may prove imetflectual  
against infractions dangerous to the essential rivinis of the paities to it,  
The resolution supposes that dangerous powers, not delegated, may not  
only be usurped and exeented by the other departinents, but that the  
Judicial department, also, nay exercise or sanction dangerous powers,  
beyond the grant of the Constitation ; and, consequently, that the ult  
mate right of the parties to the Constitntion, to jadge whether the com-  
pact has been dangerously vio! ited, grust extend to violations by one  
delegated authority, as well as by another—by the Judiciary as well as  
by the Executive or the Legislature.  
  
“ However true, therefore, it may be that the Jadicial department is,  
in all questions submitted to it by the forms of the Constitution, to de-  
cide in the last res ort. this resort most necessarily he deemed the last in  
relation to the authorities of the other departments of the Government—  
  
not in relation to the rights of the parties to the Constitetional Compact, |  
  
from which the Judicial, as well as the other departments, hold ther  
delegated trusts. On any other hypothesis. the delegation of Judicial

&quot;It appears to your Commit­  
tee to be a plain principle, foun­  
ded in common sense, illustra­  
ted by common practice, aud  
essential to the nature of com­  
pacts, that, where reset t can be  
had to no tribunal superior to  
the authority of the parties, the  
parties themselves must be the  
rightful judges in the last re  
sult, whether the bargain made  
las been pursued or violated.  
I&#x27;he Constitution of the United  
States was formed by the sanc  
tion of the States, given by each  
in its sovereign capacity. It  
idds to the stability and digni  
ty, as well .as to the authority, of  
the Constitution, that it rests on  
this legitimate aud solid foun­  
dation. The States, then, be  
ing the parties to the constitu­  
tional compact, and in their  
sovereign capacity, it follows,  
of necessity, that there can be  
no tribunal above their authori  
ty, to decide, in the last resort-,  
sucti questions as may be 01  
sufficient magnitude to require  
their interposition.  
&quot;Jjut it is obiectcd that the  
judicial authority is to be recur-  
una as mc sole expositor ot tne  
Constitution in the last resort;  
11 f I &quot; . t  
and it may be asked for what  
reason the declaration by the  
General Assembly, supposing  
it to be theoretically true, could  
be required at the present day,  
and in so solemn a mannerl  
&quot;On this objection it might be  
observed, first: that there may  
be instances of usurped power,  
which the forms of the Consti­  
tution would never draw within  
the control of the judicial de­  
partment: secondly, that if the  
decision of the judiciary b rai-  
  
- &#x27;  
  
scd above the authority of the  
sovereign parties to the Consti­  
tution, the decisions of the oth­  
er departments, not carried by  
the forms of the Constitution  
before the judiciary, must be  
equally authoritative and final  
with the decisions of that de­  
partment. But the proper an­  
swer is, that the resolution of  
the General Assembly relat  
to those great and extraordinary  
cases, in which all the form of  
the Constitution mav nmv in  
effectual against &quot;infractions  
dangerous to the essential rights  
of the parties to it. The reso­  
lution supposes that dangerous  
powers not delegated, mav not  
only be usurped and executed  
oy the other departments, but  
that the judicial dinavtment  
also, may exercise or sanction  
1 .  
w  
dangerous powers beyond the  
grant of the Constitution; and  
consequently, that the ulti  
mate right of the parties to the  
Constitution, to judge whether  
me compact has been danger  
ously violated, must extend to  
violations by one delegated au  
thority, as well as by another;  
by the judiciary, as well as by  
the executive, or the legislative.  
&#x27;However true, therefore, it  
may be that the judicial depart­  
ment is, in all questions submit  
ted to it hv the forms of fhn  
Constitution to decide in the  
last resort, this resort must ne­  
cessarily be deemed the last in

“The other position involved in this branch of the resolution,  
namely, that the States are parties to the Consutution, or com-  
pact, is, iu the judgment of the Committee, equally free from  
objection. If is, indeed, true, that the term * State” is some-  
times used in a vague sense, and sometimes in different senses  
according to the subject to which it is applied. ‘Thus, it some-  
times means the separate section of territory occupied by the  
political societies, sometimes the particular Government esta-  
blished by those societies as organized into those particular Go-  
vernments, and, lastly, it means the People composing those po-  
litical societies, in lheir highest sovereiga capacity.  
  
“Although it might be wished that the perfection of lan-  
guage admitted less diversity in the siguification of the same  
words, yet little inconvenience is produced by it where the true  
sense can be collected with certainty from the diferent appli  
cation. In the present instance, whatever different construc-  
tien of the term * Srate,” in the resolution, may heve been en-  
iertained, all, at least, concur in the last mentioued——because,  
in that sense the Constitution was submitted to the Stlates--in  
that sense the States ratified it—and, in that sense of the term  
“ States,” they are, consequently, parties to the compact from  
| which the powers of the Federal Government result.”

which they intended to take, and which the preceding re-1  
solutions and the reasoning therein contained, were in- |  
tended to introduce, and justify. These two resolutions,  
and the comments on them, in file report, clearly shew,  
that nothing was intended anli-ronslitiitioual in its charac­  
ter, hut that the only object was to defend the rights ot the  
States and the people, through the agency of public, opi­  
nion, as essential to preserve both the Union, and the Con­  
stitution. I n page fM» of the Report are the following pas­  
sages: “The two concluding resolutions only remain to  
he examined. They are in the words following:”  
“ 1 hat the good people of this Commonwealth, having  
ever felt, and continuing to feel the most tincere affection  
j for their brethren ot the other States; the tmnst anxiety  
for establishing and perpetuating the union of all; and the  
most scrupulous fidelity to that Constitution, which is the  
I pledge ot mutual friendship. ;Jj instrument of mu­  
  
tual happiness, tliu General A -srmlily doth volctonly appeal  
to the like disposition in itio other Stales, in confidence  
that they will concur with this Commonwealth in declar­  
ing, as it doth hereby declare, that the acts aforesaid are tin- ]  
constitutional, a/id that the necessary and proper measures  
will be taken by each, for co-operating with this State, in i  
in.but.lining unimpaired, the authorities, rights, and liber­  
ties, ^reserved.to the States respectively or to the people.”  
” &#x27;1 hat the Governor bo desired to transmit a copy -d the !  
foregoing resolutions to the Executive authority of each of  
the other Stiles, with a rc&lt;|iies( that the same may he com­  
municated to the Legislature thereof; and that a copy he  
furnished to each of the Senators and Representatives, rep­  
resenting this State in the Congress of the United States.”  
On these resolutions, the Report makes the following  
commentary:  
” I lie fairness and regularity of the proceeding here  
pursued, have not protected it against objections, even  
from sources loo respectable lobe disregarded.”  
“It has been said to belong to the Judiciary of the  
United Stales, and not to the State Legislatures, to declare  
the meaning ol the Federal Constitution.” \
“Hut, a declaration that proceedings of the Federal Go­  
veminent are not warranted by the Constitution, is a no­  
velty neither among the citizens, nor among the Legis­  
latures ol the States; nor are the citizens or the Legislature  
ol \ irginiu singular in the example of it.”  
&quot;•^ior can the declarations ot either, whether alliriniug  
or denying the constitutionality ol the measures of the  
Federal Government; or whether made before or after  
Judicial decisions thereon, he deemed, in any point ot  
view, an assumption of the ollice of the Judge. The de­  
clarations in such cases, are expressions of opinion, iiuac­  
oompsuied with any other efleet than what they may pro­  
duce on opinion, hy exciting reflection. The expositions |  
ol the Judiciary , on the other hand, are carried into imme­  
diate effect by force. The former may lead to a change  
in the legislative expression of the general will; |&gt;o—ildy j  
to a change of the opinion ot the Judiciary: ilm latter ’  
enforces the general w ill, whilst that opinion and that w ill  
continue unchanged.”  
“And if there be no impropriety in declaring the un- i  
constitutionality of proceedings iu the Federal Govern­  
ment, where can lie the impropriety of communicating  
the declaration to other Slates, ami inviting tlieir concur­  
rence in a like declaration? \\ hat is allow able for one,  
must be allowable lor all; and a free communication  
among the Stales where the Constitution imposes no re­  
straint, is as allow aide among the State Governments, as J  
among other public bodies, or private citizen-. This eon- \
••deration derives u weight that cannot be denied to it,  
from the relation of the Slate Legislatures to the Fede­  
ral Legislature, as the immediate constituent* ol one ol its  
branches.”  
  
“I lie Legislatures of the States have a right also, to ori­  
ginate amendments lo tlie Constitution, by a concurrence  
ol two-lliml* ot tiio whole number, in applications to  
Congress lor the purpose. When now States aro to be  
formed by a junction ol two or more States, or parts ol  
States, the Legislatures of the States concerned, are, as  
well as Congress, to concur in the measure. The States  
have a right also to enter into agreements or compacts  
with the assent ol (. ongress. In all such cases, a com­  
munication among them, results hum the object which is  
common to them.”  
“It is, lastly, to he seen whether the confidence expres­  
sed hy the resolution, that then tctssui y atul proper mta­  
suns would be taken hy the other Stales, lor co-operating  
with \ irginia, in maintaining the right* reserved lo the  
States, or to the people, be in any degree liable to the ob­  
jections w hich have been raised against it.”  
II it be liable to objection, it must be, bocuuse either  
the object or the means are objectionablo.”  
* 1 lio object being to maintain w h.it the Constitutior.&#x27;has  
ordained, is in itself a laudable object.”  
‘‘The means are expressed in the terms ‘the necessary  
and proper measures.’ A proper object was to be pursued,  
by means botli uccessary and proper.”  
“ 1 o lind an objection, then, it must be shewn, that some  
meaning was annexed to these general terms, which was  
not proper; and for this purpose, either that the means  
used hy the (General Assembly, were an example ol im­  
proper means, or that there were no proper means to wliiclt  
the terms could refer.”  
“ 1,1 ,l,« example given by the State, of declaring the  
Alien and Sedition Acts tube unconstitutional, and of com­  
municating the declaration to the other States, no trace of  
improper means lias appeared. And if the other State* bad  
concurred in making a like declaration, supported, loo, by  
the numerous application* flowing immediately from the  
people, it can scarcely lie doubted, that those simple means  
would have been as sufficient, as they ate unexceptiona­  
ble. *  
It is no less certain, that other means might have been  
employed, which are strictly within the limits of the Con­  
stitution. The Legislatures ot the Slates might leave  
made a direct representation to Congress, with a view lo  
obtain a rescinding ol the two offensive acts; or, they might  
have represented to their respective Senator* in Congress,  
theii wish, that two-thirds thereof would propose an ex­  
planatory amendment to the Constitution; or, two-thirds of  
themselves it such had been their option, might by an  
application to Congress, have obtained a Convention for the  
same object.”  
“ These several means, though not equally eligible iu  
themselves, nor probably, to the States, were all constitu­  
tionally open for cousideiation. And if the General As­  
sembly, alter declaring the two arts lo bo unconstitutional,  
tlie fust and most obvious proceeding on (he subject, did  
not undertake to point out to tbc other States, a choice  
among the farther measures that might become necessary  
and proper, tlie reserve will not be misconstrued by liber­  
al minds, into any culpable imputation.”  
  
“ &#x27;I hcse observations appear to form a satisfactory re­  
ply, to every abjection which is not founded on a miscon­  
ception of tho terms employed in the resolutions. There  
is one other, however, which may he of too much import­  
ancc not to be added. It cannot be forgotten, that among  
tlie arguments addressed to those, who apprehended dag­  
ger to liberty, from the establishment of the General Go­  
vernment over so great a country, the appeal was emphati­  
cally made to the intermediate existence of the State Go­  
vernments , between (he people and that government, to I  
the vigilance with which they would descry tho first syrup. |  
lomj ot usurpation, and to the promptitude with which j  
they would sound the alarm to the public. This argument ‘  
was probably not without its effect; and if it was a proper I  
one then, to recommend the establishment of the Consti- |  
tution. it must be a proper one now to assist in its iutci ore- I  
talion. *1 |  
1 lie only part ot the two concluding resolutions, (hat  
remains to be noticed, is the repetition in (he first, ol tint  
warm affection to the Union and its members, and of that  
scrupulous fidelity to the Constitution which have been in­  
variably felt hy (lie people ol (his State. As the proceed­  
ings were introduced with these sentiments, they could  
not be more properly closed than in the same manner. !  
should there bo any so far misled, as to call in ,.„es- ,  
tiou the sincerity of these professions, whatever re­  
gret may be excited by* the error, the General As.  
seinblv cannot descend into a discussion of it. Those  
who have listened to the suggestion, can only tie lett  
to their own recollection of the part which this Stale  
has borne in the establishment of our National hide- 1  
pendence; in the establishment of our National Con­  
stitution, and in maintaining under it tho authority and  
laws ol the Union, without a single exception of internal  
resistance and commotion. Hy recurring to these facts,  
they will be able to convince themselves, that the repre­  
sentatives of the. people of Virginia must be above the ne­  
cessity of opposing any other shield to (tie attacks on their  
national patriotism, than their own consciousness and the  
justice ol an enlightened public ; who will perceive in the  
resolutions themselves, the strongest evidence ol attach­  
menl both to the Constitution and to the Union, since it is  
only hy maintaining (tic different governments and de­  
partments within their respective limits, that the blessings  
of either can he perpetuated.”  
The passages quoted from the Report, exhibit w ith such  
lorce and clearness the views of the Assembly, that it  
would he presumptuous in me to attempt to make more  
clear, what are perfectly lucid in themselves.  
The topics discussed in the Ueport are of the most mo

right, and are in duty bound, to interpose for arresting the pro-  
gress of the evil, andfor maintaining, within their respective  
limits, the authorities, rights and liberties appertaining to  
them.” It appears to your committee to be a plain principle,  
founded in common sense, illustrated by common practice, and  
essential to the nature of compacts, that where resortean be had  
to no tribunal superior to the authority of the parties, the parties  
themselves must be the rightful judges in the last resort, wheth-

either side, so soon as it shall come to be mover­  
s ill v fell and ai knowledged that the S&#x27;ates do not  
stand &#x27;o the Union in the relation of degraded  
and dependant colonies, but that our bond of  
union is formed by mutual sympathies and com­  
mon iutercs&#x27;s The true answer to this objection  
has been given bv Mr. M idisoti. when he says:  
“ It does not follow, however, that because  
the Stati’9. as sovereign pirties to the coistitu  
  
tiori.il cnmpici, mum unimum uec nn* w m*im*i i  
it has been violated. tlut such a derision ought j  
tube interposed, either in a hasty manner, or on .  
doubtfui and inferior occasions. ICven in the &#x27;  
case of ordinary conventions between different na j  
linns, it is always laid down that the breach  
must be both wilful and material to jns&#x27;ify ail  
application of the rule. But in the case ot an  
intimate ami cnpxtitutional Union, like that of  
the United States, it is evident that the interpo­  
sition of the partie-*, in then* sovereign capacity,  
can be called for by occasions only, deeply and  
essentially affecting the vital principles of their (  
political system.”  
Kxpeiience demonstrates that the danger is nut  
that a S&#x27;ate will rpsort to tier sovereign rights  
too frequently or on light and trivial occasions,  
hut that she inav shrink from asserting them as  
often as mav be necessary.  
I’ is maintained by South Carolina, that, ac­  
cording to the true spirit of the Constitution, it  
becomes Congress, in all emergencies like the  
present, either to remove the evii by legislation,  
or to solicit of the S&#x27;ates the call of a Conven

** It does not follow, however, that because the States, av sov-

whether it has been violated, that such a decision ought to be inter  
posed, either in a hasty minner, or on doubtful and inferior occa-

and enormous violations” as to justify the  
dernier resort of South Carolina ?—ls the  
crisis so extreme a one as will not even per-.  
mit her to hesitate, until she-can confer and  
consult with the other States? \
2ndly, But neither has she pursued the  
Virginia Resolutions. They merely declare  
the laws unconstitutional ; but they took no  
measures to arrest their execution in Virgin­  
ia. But Mr. Madison’s Report of ’99 points  
out othe? means of redress. :  
  
“In the example given by the State of declar­  
ing thealien and sedition acts to be unconstitu­  
tional,and of communicating the declaration to the  
other States, no trace of improper means has ap­  
peared. And if the other States had econcurred  
in making a like declaration, supported too by  
the numerous applications flowing immediately  
from the people, it can scarcely be doubted that  
these simple means would have been as sufficient  
as they are unexceptionable.  
“Itis no less certain that other means might  
have been employed, which are strictly within  
the limits of the Constitution. The legislatures  
of the States might have made a direct represen­  
tation to Congress, with a view to obtain a res­  
cinding of the two offensive acts ; or they might  
have represented to their respective Senators in  
Congress, their wish, that two-thirds thereol  
would propose an explanatory.amendment to the  
Constitution; or two-thirds of themselves, if  
such had been their option, might, by an applica­  
tion to Cengress, have obtained a Convention  
{or the same object.  
  
“These several means, though not equally eli­  
gible in themselves, nor probably, to the States,  
were all constitutionally open for consideration.  
And if the General Assembly, after declaring  
the two acts to be unconstitutional, the first and  
most obvious proceeding on the subject, did not  
undertake to point out to the other States a  
choice among the further measures that might  
become necessary and proper, the reserve will  
not be misconstrued by liberal minds into any  
culpable imputation.’’ R

‘•It appears to your committee to he a plain principle,1  
founder! in common sense, illustrates! by rornmon practice,  
and essential to the nature of compart*, that, where re­  
sort can he had to no tribunal superior to the authority of  
the parties, the parties themselves must he llm right­  
ftil judges, in the last resoit, whether the bargain  
&gt; marie has been pursued or violated. The Constitu­  
tion of the United States was formed by the sanction of  
1 the fKates, given by each in its sovereign rapacity ft1  
  
«ilils to the stability ami dignity as nell as to the authori­  
ty the Constitution, (oat it rests on this legitimate anti  
solid foundllion. The Stales, then, being the parties to  
the Constitutional Compact, and In their sovereign capa­  
it follows, ol necessity, that Ihcie eon he no tribunal  
above their authority, to decide, in the last resort, whether  
the compact mode by them bo violated) and, consequent*  
ly, (hat, as the parties to it, they must themselves decide,  
in the last resort, such questions as may be of suflicient  
magnitude to require their interposition,  
“Hut it is objected, that the Judicial authority Is tube  
regarded as the sole expositor cl the Constitution In the  
last resort: and at may he ashed lor what reason the de­  
claration, by the General Assembly, supposing it to be theo­  
retically true, could be required at the present day, ami  
in so solemn a manner.  
On this objection it might be observed—First, that  
there may be In-tnncesof usurped power, which the forms  
ol ihe t ouslilutioii would never&#x27;draw within the control of  
the Judicial department. Secondly, that, if the decision  
ol the Judiciary bo raised above the authoiity oltho  
sovereign parlies to the Constitution, the decisions of tha  
oilier departments not carried, by die forms of ti e Con­  
stitution, before die Judiciary, must bo equally authorita­  
tive ami final with the decisions of that department. Hut  
ilie piopor aftswer to the objection i-, that the resolution of  
tbe (•enerul Assembly relates to those great and extraor­  
dinary cases in which all the forms ol die (’(institution  
may prove ineffectual against illliactioiisiUtlgeious to tbs  
essential rights ol the parties to it. The resolution sup­  
pa-os that dangerous powers, not delegated* may not only  
bo usurped and executed by the other departments, but  
i that the Judicial department, also, may exercise or sane­  
tion dangerous powers, beyond (ho grant ol the Constitu­  
tion; and, consequently, that the ultimate right of Ihu  
panics to the Constitution, to judge whether the compact  
has been dangerously violated, must extend to violations  
by one delegated authoiity, as well as by another—bv the  
Judiciary as well as by the Executive or the legislature.  
“However true, therefore, It may bo that (ho Judicial  
department i-, in all questions submitted to it by the forms  
ol the (ofMitution, to decide in the last lesort, this resort  
i must necessarily he deemed the hist in relation to the au­  
thorities ol the other departiiients of the Government—net  
in relation to the lights ol the parties to the Constitutional  
Compact, hum w hich the Judicial, as well as the other de­  
partments, hold their delegated trusts. On any other hy­  
pothesis, the de egaiion ot Juridinl power would annul  
the authority delegating i&lt;; and the concurrence ol this  
department with Hie others,in usurped powers, might  
subvert forever, and beyond the possible reach of any rig lit­  
lul remedy, the very t onstitution which all were instituted  
to presen e.”

of Madison’s report, ‘the deliberate exer­  
cise of dangerous powers palpably with­  
held by the Constitution, could not justify  
the parties to it, in interposing even so far  
as to arrest the progress of the evil, and  
thereby to fkeskrve the Constitdiion  
itself, as well as to provide for the safety  
of the parties to it, there would be an end  
to ail relief from usurped power, and a  
direct subversion of the rights specified or  
recognized under all the State Constitu­  
tions, as well as a plain denial of tl« fun­  
damental principle on which our indepen­  
dence itself was declared.’  
The only plausible objection that can he  
urged against this right, so indispensable  
to tho rafety of the States, is that it may  
be abused. But this danger is believed to  
be altogether imaginary. So long as our

follow however, that because the states, as so-  
vereign parties tu the constitutional compact,  
must ultimately decide whether it has been  
violate i, thatsuch a decision ought to be in-  
terposed, either in a hasty manner, or on  
doubtful and inferior vecasions. Evep in the  
case of ordinary conventions between different  
nations, it is always laid down that the breach  
must be both wilful and material to justify aa

of the United States, it is evident that the in-

demonstrates that the danger is not thata

as often as may be necessary.

In his celebrated report, he explained and vindicated  
that part of the resolutions which speaks of .‘Me neccssa­  
rU «»&lt;* proper measures,’ against the objections urged  
against them. The whole defence of the resolutions dear­  
ly shews, that the measures were to be peaceable and  
constitutional, and to lie taken hy each Slate with a view  
ta co operation with Virginia, and not to the single anti  
separate action of one Slate&#x27;unaided am! alone.&#x27; The  
report morever expressly declares, that because Virginia  
did not undertake to point out to her sister Stales, a choice  
among (he other measures that might become necessary  
and proper, the failure to do so was not to be construed  
into any culpable imputation. Let ns imagine that the,  
resolutions had been charged with asserting on the pait

&quot;A plain principle illustrated by common practice,  
and essential to the nature of compacts, that when  
resort can be had to no tribunal superior 10 the au­  
thority of the parties, the parties themselves must be  
the rightful judges in the last resort, whether the  
bargain made, has been pursued or violated.&quot; The  
Constitution, continues Mr. Madison, &quot;was formed  
by the sanction of the States, given by each in its  
sovereign capacity; the States then being parties to  
the constitutional compact, and in their sovereign ca­  
pacity, it follows of necessity, that there can be no  
tribunal above their authority, to decide in the last  
resort, whether the compact made by them be vio­  
lated; and, consequently, that as the parties to it, they  
must themselves decide in the last resort, such ques­  
x ions as may he of sufficient magnitude to require  
their interposition.&quot;  
If this riht does not exist in the several  
States, then it is clear that the discretion of Con  
  
gress, and not the Constitution, would be th

borrow the language of Madison&#x27;s report.  
&quot;The deliberate exercise of dangerous powers pal­  
pably withheld by the Constitution, could not justify  
the parties to it, in interfiosing even so fur as to arrest  
the fir ogress of the evil, and &#x27;thereby to preserve the  
Constitution itself, as well as to provide lov the safety  
of the parties to it, there would be an end to all re­  
lief from usurped power, and a direct subversion of  
the rights specified or recognized under all the State  
Constitutions, as well as a plain denial of the funda­  
mental principle on which our independence itself was  
declared.&quot;  
The only plausible objection that can be urged  
against this right, so indispensable to the safety  
of ihe States, is that it may be abused. But this  
danger is believed to be altogether imaginary.  
So long as our Union is felt as a blessing and  
this will be just so long as the Federal Govern­

cither side, so soon as it shall come to be univer­  
sally felt and acknowledged that the States do  
not stand to the Union in the relation of degraded  
and dependent colonies, but that our bond of U­  
nion is formed by mutual sympathies and com­  
mon interests. The true answer to this objec­  
tion has been given by Mr. Madison, when he  
says:  
&quot;It does not follow, however, that because the  
States, as sovereign parties to the constitutional com­  
pact, must ultimately decide whether it has been vio­  
lated, that such a decision ought to be interposed, ei­  
ther in a hasty manner, or on doubtful and inferior oc­  
casions. Even in the case of ordinary conventions  
between different nations, it is always laid down that  
the breach must be both wilful and material to justi­  
fy an application of the rule. But in the case of an  
intimate and constitutional union, like that of the Uni­  
ted States, it is evident that the interposition of the  
parties, in their sovereign capacity, can be called for  
by occasions only deeply and essentially affecting the  
vital principles of their political system.&quot;

a part of tbc argument on this famous 3d resolution. In  
• lie reporl, is this language: “ This resolution of the Gen­  
eral Assembly relates to those great and extraordinary  
cases, in which all the forms of the Constitution may  
prove ineffectual against infractions dangerous to the es­  
sential rights of the parties to it. The resolution suppo­  
ses that dangerous powers, not delegated, may not only he i  
! usurped arid executed hy the other departments, hut that j  
the judicial department also, may exercise, or sanction &#x27;  
&#x27; dangerous powers, beyond the grant of the Constitution; ;  
ami, consequently, that the ultimate right of the parties  
| to the Constitution tojndge whether the compact has been 1  
I dangerously violated, must extend to violations by one de- j  
legated authority, as well ashy another; by (he judiciary,  
j is well as hy the executive, or the legislature.” Again, !  
| m another part of the report Upon the same resolution:  
| “The Constitution of the United Stales was lormed by the j  
; sanction of the States, given by each in its sovereign ca- [  
par ity. It adds to tbc stability and dignity, as well as to  
I the authority of the Constitution, that it rests og this legi- j  
I limate and solid foundation. The States, then, being the |  
  
parties to Hie constitutional compact, anil in their sove­  
reign rapacity, it follows of necessity, that there can lie  
no tribunal above their authority, to decide in the last re- 1  
sort, whether the compart made by them he violated; and, |  
consequently, that as the parties toil, they must them-&#x27;

charter which defines them,” &amp;c. The Report,  
in commenting upon this Resolution, and in enu­  
merating the acts which emanated from this  
“ forced construction of the constitutional char­  
ter.” uses this language: “Omitting others  
which have le-s occupied public, attention, or ,  
been less extensively regarded as unconstitution­  
al, the Resolution may be presumed to refer par­  
ticularly to the Bank law, which from the cir­  
cumstances of its passage, as well as the latitude  
of construction upon which it is founded, strikes  
the attention with singular force; and the Car- |  
r/nge tux, distinguished only by circumstances  
in its history having a similar tendency. Those  
instances also, if resulting from forced construc­  
tion, and calculated to enlarge the powers of the  
Federal Government, as the Constitution cannot  
but conceive to he the case, sufficiently warrant  
this part of the Resolution.

mentioned. Thus it says, “ To find .an objection, then, it ;  
must he shewn, that some meaning was annexed to these |  
general terms, which was not proper; and, loir,tMs pur- I  
pose, either that the means used by tbo General Assem­  
bly were an example of improper means, or that there  
were no proper means to which the terms could refer.  
“In the example given by the Stale, of declaring the  
Alien and Sedition Acts to ho unconstitutional, anil of coin­  
j munirating the declaration to the other States, no truce ol  
improper means has appeared. And#/&#x27; the other States  
had concurred in making a like declaration, supported,  
| too, by (lie numcriotis applications, flowing Immediately  
Iroin the people, It can scarcely he doubted, that these  
1 simple means would have been as sufficient as they are  
| unexceptionable.  
“ It is no less certain that other means might have been  
employed, which arc strictly within the limits of the Con­  
stitution. Tho Legislatures ol the Slates might have  
made a direct representation to Congress, with a view to  
! obtain a rescinding ol the two offensive acts ; or, they  
, might have represented to their respective Senators in  
Congress, their wish, that two thirds thereof would pro­  
J pose an explanatory amendment to the Constitution ; nr  
&#x27; two thirds ol themselves, if sorb had been their option,  
might, by an application to Congress, have obtained a  
1 Convention for tbo same object.”  
We have further evidence,that tho distinguished au­  
thors did not seriously believe that a State could annul an  
, art of Congress, in the express declarations made by Mr.  
Madison ; and in the opinions expressed by Mr. Jefferson

between the peopie and tl.at Government, lo the vig,la„ce  
with which they would descry the first sjmptom.ol nanr­

hnhly not without its effect; and if it «a&lt; a proper one

the Report of’99.  
This celebrated Report declares, (in speaking j  
/•the powers of the Federal Government) “one  
°resequence must be to enlarge the sphere of I  
discretion allotted to the executive magistrate,”  
a id it is in this latitude, as a supplement to the j  
deficiency of the laws, that the degree ofpxecu-1  
tjve prerogative materially consists.” “The  
other consequence would be that of an exces­  
sive augmentation of the offices, honors and  
emoluments depending on the executive will.—  
\dd to the present legitimate stock, all those of  
every description which a consolidation of the  
States would take from them, and turn over to  
the Federal Government, and the patronage of  
the executive would necessarily be as much  
swelled in that case as its prerogative would be  
in the other. The disproportionate increase of  
prerogative and patronage must evidently, ei-;  
ther enable the Chief Magistrate of the Union,  
by quiet means, to secure his re-election from  
time to time, and finally to regulate the succes­  
sion as he might please; or by giving so trans­  
cendant an importance to the office, would  
render the election to it so violent and corrupt,  
that the public voice itself might call for an he­  
reditary in place of an elective succession.”  
With this solemn warning, mav we not ex­  
  
• press our mortification, with a class of politi­  
cians, who profess to deny to Congress every  
power, in the least degree questionable, but who  
contend for consolidating in the hand of the  
Federal Executive, so much of power and pa­  
tronage, as to be dangerous to liberty, an

“The resolution next in older U contained in the follow­  
ing term*:  
“ I hat (ho General Assembly doth particularly protest  
against the palpable ami alarming infractions of the Con­  
stitution, in the two late cases ol tlm “Alien and Sedition  
Acts,” passed at the last session of Congress; tin; first ol  
which exercise* a power no where delegat&#x27;d to the Fe­  
deral Government; and which, by uniting Legislative and  
Judicial powers In tlio-e of Executive, subvert* the gener­  
al principles ol a lire Government, as well a* the particu­  
lar organization and positive pro* Isions of the Federal Con­  
dilution; »dd the other of which Acts exercises, in like  
manner, a powor not delegated by die Constitution; but,  
en the contrary, expressly and positively forbidden by one  
ol die amendments thereto: a power, which, more than  
«my oilier, ought to produce universal alarm; because it is  
levelled against that light ol Ireely examining public  
characters and measures, and of free communication  
among die people thereon, which has ever been justly  
deemed die only effectual guardian of every other right.’’  
“ 1 lie subject of this resolution having, it U presumed  
snore particularly led tlio General Assembly info die pro­  
ceedings which diey communicated to the other States,  
ami being in itself of peculiar importance, it deserves the  
most rrhiral and faithful investigation; for the length ol  
wvhirli i;o oilier apology will br fiep^nniiry.  
“The subject divides itself into first, “The Alien Act ”  
mtcondhj. “The Sedition An &quot;  
  
•Ol die “Alien Acl,” ii is alTii meil by die Resolution, 1st.  
1 bat it exercises a power no where delegated ‘o the Fe­  
deral Government. 2d. That It unites Legislative and Ju­  
dicial powers to those ot the Fxernfhe. 8d. &#x27;Ihst Ibis  
Simon ol power,subverts the general principles rf tree go­  
werninent. 4 It. I hat it subverts the particular organize­  
Sion and positive provisions of the Federal Constitution.  
“in order to clear Ibe way for a coriecl view ol the lirst  
po-iiion, several observations will be premised.  
“In the fust place; it is to he borne in mind, (hat it be­  
ing a characteristic feature ol the Federal Constitution, as  
it was oiiginally ratified, and an amendment thereto hav­  
ing precisely declared, “I hat the powers not delegated to  
4I|* United State* by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it  
to tbe States, are reserved-lo ibe States respectively, or to  
4he People; it is incumbent in Ibis, as in every other rx­  
-errise ot power by Ibe Federal Government, to prove Irom  
the Constitution, that it grants Ibe particular power exer­  
&lt;-ised.  
“The next obiervation to be made, is, Ibal much con­  
tfuNion and fallacy have been thrown into (lie question by  
blending (lie two rases of alien*, members of a hostile  
nation; and, aliens, members of friendly nations —  
llieso (wo cases are so obviously, am) so essentially dis­  
itnci, that it occasions no little surprise (list the distinction  
wbould have been disregarded : and the surprise ismuch  
the greater, as It appears that tbe two cases are actually  
distinguished by two separate acts ol Congress, passed at  
the same session, snd comprised in the same publication;  
U»e one providing lor the case ol ••alien enemies;” the  
other “concerning aliths” indiscriminate!); ami conse­  
quently extending to aliens of every natinn in peace and  
amity With the United States. With respect lo alien ene­  
snies, no doubt has been intimated as lo tbe Frderel au­  
thority over ilicin; the Constitution having expressly de­  
leg tied to Congress the power to declare war against any  
M.itinn, sml ol course to treat it ami all its memhets ** enr­  
Mib e. With respect lo aliens, who aie not enemies, but  
sue liber* ol nations in pesCO and amity with the Untied  
Mta.es, tbe power assorted by the art ot Congress, is de­  
nied to l-c Constitutional; and It is accordingly against tins  
** &#x27;• ••&#x27;»• •&gt; • P»o mi of «•&gt;« General Assembly is expressly !  
•rnf wxclustvely directed. 1  
&quot; A ‘•&#x27;&#x27;id Observation is, that were it admitted, ss Is  
ctm&#x27;.endeil, that the‘tel concerning Aliens,’ has (or it* oh- !  
ject, not a penal, but a preventive justice; it would *tili j  
setisum to be proved that it comes within the Constitution­  
• I (rower ol Ibe federal Legislature: snd it within its  
power, that the l.rgisla ore has exsreised il in a Cohlilu­  
tiousl power.  
“In Iho administration ol preventive justice, the follow- 1  
ing piinclples have been held sacred ; that some probable j  
ground ot suspicion be exhibited before some Judicial au­  
thority; that it be supported by oath or affirmation; that  
the par&#x27;y msy avoid being (brown into confinement, by  
finding pledges or sifrefie* lor his legal conduct sufficient  
in the judgment of some Judicial authority; that he msy  
have the benefit of a writ ol haheax corpus, anil thus oh- i  
tein his Release, If wrongfully confined, and that he may [  
at any time be tlitcbsrged from his recognizance, or his  
  
confinement, and rcalorad lo hla former liberty and righ&#x27;s.  
on the order of the proper Judicial authority, n it shall s«w  
•ullieient cause.  
“All these principles of the only preventive justice  
known to American jutisprudence, are violated hy the  
Alien act. The ground ol euspicion ia to bo judged ol,  
uot by any Judicial auihoiity, but by the Executive Ma­  
gistral# aloue: no oath or affirmation is required; il Ilia su«­  
piciou be held reasonable by tlie President, he may or­  
der the suspected Alien lo depart the tenilory ol the  
United States, without the oppoiluiuty ol avoiding t|,o  
sentence, by liudtug pledgee tor his lutuie good con­  
duct; a* the President may limit the time ol depsrtuie se  
It* pleases, the benefit of Use Will of habeas eoipus may  
be suspended with respect to (lie patty, although the i on­  
slitutivir ordain*, (list il shall nol be suspended, unless  
when the public salely may require il iu case ul rebelliutt  
or invasion, neither ol which existed at the passage ot  
the act: and Hie psily being under the sentence ol ll.e  
President, either le moved It out the Uhited States, or be­  
iug punished ity imprisonment, or disqualifies! on ever lo  
become a riltzeu ou cotivic&#x27;iou of not obeying ihe order  
of removal, he raimot be discharged Irom Ihe ptoccediuga  
against him, and restore,| to the lieneliisol hi* loimer si­  
tuation, aliliuugh the highest Judtetul aulhmty should  
see the most sufficient cause lor it.  
Hut, in the Iasi place, it can never l e admitted, that  
the removal ol Aliens, authotized by Ihe ac&#x27;, is to be con­  
sidered, nol as punishment lor an olleticc, but as a mea­  
sure ul precaution and prevention. Il ihe banishment of  
tn alien born a rooniry into which be Ha* been invited,  
at the asylum most auspicious to Id* happiness; a luuutiy  
where lie may have foimed ihe most lenilei ol connec  
lions, where he may have vested Itis entire pioperty, and  
acquired property ol the real and permanent, aa well aa  
the moveable and temporary kin.’; where Ire enjoys un­  
der the laws, a greater share ol the bleating* ol personal  
security and peitonai hbeiiy, than he cau elsewhere hope  
lor, and a line Ire may have nearly &lt; ompleied Ins piuba  
tiouary title to citizenship; il, moreover, iu ihe execution  
ol the aeuteurc against III nr, lie I* to be exposed, not only  
lo the ordinary danger* of lire sea, but to lire peculiar cas­  
ualties incident lo a crisis ol war, and of unusual liceuiioue­  
ness un that element, and possibly to vindicate purposes  
which Itis emigration iisefl may have piov.ked; tl a ban­  
Uhiuent ol ibis suit be not a punishment, and among the  
•everest punishments, it w ill be difficult to imagine a doom  
to which the name can be applied.  
“ And if il be a punishment, it will remain to be enquir­  
ed, whether it rau be constitutionally inflicted, on met■  
euspicion, by tbu Mingle will of the Executive Magie­  
hale, ou perrons convicted ol no prison.I ollruce against  
Ike laws ol the laud, nor involved in auy clf.iice against  
the law ol nations, charged ou lire foreign Slate ol which  
they are member*.  
“ One arg ment oflered in justification ol this , ower  
exercised over Aliens, ia, that the eduiisti.liot them in u *  
ilie country being of lavor, uoi ol right, the favor ia at all  
times revocable.  
“To this argument it might be answered, that allow ing  
the truth of the inference, it would be no proof ol whsi is  
required. A question would etill occur, w lie liter I lie Con­  
stitution had vested the discretionary power ol admitting  
Aliena iu the Federal Government or in the State Govern­  
ment*.  
“Built cannot be a true inference, (hat because Ihe  
admission ul «n Alien is a lavor, the lavor may be revoked ul  
pleasure. A grant of land &gt;o an individual may be ol lavor,  
not ol right; but the moment the grant ia made, the lavor  
heroines a right, and muit he lorlci&#x27;ed be lore it cau be  
taken away. To pardon a inslrlactor may be a laior.but  
• he pardon is not, ou that account, the less irrevocable.  
! To admit an alien to ny uralizalion, U aa much a latoi, a*  
to admit him to reside iu the country ; yet, il couiioi be  
pretended, that a person naturalized can be deplived of the  
benefit, any more than a native citizen can be disliau­  
rhtsed.  
^“Again,it ia said,that Alien*, nol being paitiea to the  
Constitution, Ihe rights and privileges which it tecurea,  
cannot ha stall claimed by them.  
“ To ihi* reasoning also, it might be answered, that al­  
though Alien* are uot parties to lire Constitution, il doe*  
not follow that the Constitution lias vested in Coi great an  
abmlute power over them. The parlies to the Constitu­  
tion may have grsnlrd, or retained, or modtlied the power  
over Aliens, without regard to that particular considera­  
tion.  
  
** lint a more direct reply is, tint it doe» not follow, be*  
ctute Alien* are not par lea to the Constitution, a* citizen*  
are parlies lo it, tlui whilst they actually couloim jo it.  
they have no right to its pioteciion. Aliena are not more  
parlies to the l«wa, than they are parties to the Couati&#x27;u­  
tion, yet, it will not he di*puled, that as they owe oil one  
hand, a temporary obcd.euce, they are entitled in re urn  
to their piotrclioii aud advantage.  
“ It alien* had no rights under the Constitution, they  
might not only be hanUlied, but even rspiially punished,  
without a jury or Ihe other incidents to a lair trial. But  
ay tar has a ronuary principle been carried, in every part  
id the United Mi&#x27;tr, that except on charge* ol treason, an  
Allan has, beside* all the common piivileges, the sperial  
one ol being tried by a jury, ol which one hall muy be  
also Aliens.  
“ li i* said, further, that by the law and practico of na­  
tions, Aliens maybe removed at discretion, lor offences  
against the law ol uaiions; that Congress aie authoiizeii  
to define and punish such offences; aud that lo be danger*  
ous lo the peace ol society is, in A lieu*, one ol those of­  
lance*.  
“ I he distinction between Alien enemies and friend*  
is a clear and conclusive answer to this argument. Alien  
enemies are under the law ol nations, and liable to he pun­  
i-hcd lor oflenres against it. Alien friends, except in ihe  
wngle ra«e ot public minister*, are under the municipal  
law, and must be tried and punished according to that law  
only. “  
“ 1 hi* *r8,|ment *l*o, hy referring the Alien Act to ihe  
pow er of Congress lo define aud puniih offences against  
the law of nations, yields the point that (he art is of*  
penal, not merely ol a preventive, operation. 1; must  
m truth be so considered. And if it he a penal art. the  
punishment it inflict* must he justified by some ollence  
that ilesrrves it.  
•* Offences for which Aliens, within the jurisdiction of a  
country, are punishable, are firat, offence* rommilled by  
he nation ol which they make a part, ,nd in whose ol­  
ences they are involved : Secondly, rflrcres committed  
by themselves alone, without any charge against ll.e na­  
tion lo which they belong. The first i* the rnae ol Alien  
enemies; ihe second, the case of Alien friends. Imho  
lust case the offending nation can no otherwise he  
punished than by war, one of the law* of which authorize,  
the expulsion of such of i&gt;* member*, as may be found within  
the country, against which the offence has been commit*  
ted. ill the Second rase, the offence being committed by  
the individual, not by his nation, and against Hie miiniri­  
p.»l law, not against the law ol nation*; the individual only,  
and not the nation, is punishable; and the punishment  
must be conducted according to the municipal law, not ac­  
cording to ihe law ol nation*. Under this view of the sub­  
ject, the act oi Congress, for the removal ol Alien ena. -  
lines, being conformable lo the law of nations, is justified  
by the Uousiituiion; ami the ••act,” for the removal of  
Alien IriemU, being repugnant to the Constitutional piin­  
ciplef of municipal law, i* unjlistifi»file.  
“ Nor i* ihe act or Congress, for (he removal of Alien  
rien. *, more agpee.ble .o the general practice ol naiiona.  
than it Is within Ihe purview ol the law ol nations. Thu

therefore,;not Incident to wer, cannot he incident to a par­  
ticular modification of war. And aa the removal ol alien  
jiiemlt, liat appeared to be no incident to a general alate  
ol war, it cannot be incident to a partial stale, or a particu­  
lar modification ol war.  
“Nor can it ever be granted, that a power to act on a  
raae when it actually occurs, includes a |&gt;ower over all  
tlie means (bat may (etui lo prevent the occurrence of tlie  
case, fruclt e latitude ol construction would render uua­  
vailing, every practicable definition ol particular and  
limited power*. Under tlie idea of preventing war iu  
general, as well aa invasion in particular, tiot only an indis­  
criminate removal ol all alien* might be enlotred, but a  
iIhmi-and otlu r tiling* still more temoie trom tlie operation*  
slid precautions appurtenant to wsr might take place. A  
In gut led or tyrannical nation might threaten us w sits wsr.un­  
less certain religious or political tcgnlaiiou* were adopted  
l&gt;y tts; yet it never rould tie interred, it the regulation*  
which would prevent war, were swell a* Congress had  
otherwise no power to make, tha the power to make them  
would giow out ol the put pose they were to answer  
Congress have power to suppress insurrections, yet it  
would not be allowed lo lollow, that they might employ  
all tlie mean* lending to prevent them; ol winch a sys­  
tem ol moral instruction lor tlie ignorant, and of provident  
suppoit tor the poor, might be regarded aa among the most  
ellii-ariou*.  
“One argument lor tlie power ol the General Govern­  
ment to remove Aliens, would have been passed iu silence,  
it it had appeared under any authority inferior to that of a  
report, made during the last session ot Congress, to tlie  
f louse ot Hepreseulatii e* hy a committee, and approved  
by the House. The doctrine on winch thi* argument is  
loutideJ, •* ol vo new and so extraordinary a character,  
sml strike*so radically at tlie polidral system ol America,  
that it it proper lo slate it in the vety word* ol tlie re­  
port:  
I lie »cl (concerning Alien*,) is said to be unconstitu­  
tional, because to remove Aliens, i* a direct breach ot  
“ the Constitution, which provide*, by tlie 9th section, ol  
“the 1*1 article: that the migration or importation oi such  
“ person* a* any ot tlie Stale* shall think proper to admit,  
“rhillnot be prohibited by the Congress, prior to the  
“year 1808.”  
Among tlie answer* given to this objection to the con­  
stitutionality ol tlie act, tlie lollowing vety remarkable  
one ia extracted:  
“ I htrdly, that a* the Constitution haa green to the  
“ States, no power to remove Aliens, dining the period  
“ ol ilia limitation under consideration, in tha mean time,  
&#x27;*on the construction assumed, there would bv no aullto­  
“iity iu (be countty, empowered to send away dangerous  
“ Aliens, w(licit cannot be admitted ”  
“ Tlie reasoning here used, would not in any view, be  
conclusive; because ilieie are powers exercised by most  
•&quot;her Governments, which ill tlie United Slates are with­  
held tiy tlie people, both Irvin the General Government  
and fioin the State Government*. Ol tins sort are mtuy  
ol tlie powers prohibited by the declarations ol right pie­  
fixed to tha Constitution*, or hy the clause* iu the Con­  
stitutions, in tlie nature ol such declsration*. Nay, so tar  
is the political system ol tlie United States distinguishable  
tiom that ol other countiies, by the caution with which  
pow ers are delegated and defined; dial in one very impoil­  
ant case, even ol commercial regulation and revenue,  
• he power is absolutely lurked up •gainst tlie hands of both  
Government*. A lax on exports can he laid by no ctfhali­  
lution*! authority whatever. Under a system thus pe­  
culiarly guarded, there rould aurely be no absurdity in  
supposing, that Alien Iriemls, who, if guilty of treasonable  
machinations may be punished, or if suspected on pro­  
batde grounds, may be secured by pledges or imprison­  
incut, in like manner with permanent ritizeus, were ne­  
ver meant to be subjected to banishment by any arbitrary  
nml unusual process, either under the one Government or  
the oilier.  
  
“Hut it is not the iuconrlusivene** of the general rea­  
soning in this passage, which rhirMy calls (he attention  
to it. It is the principle assumed by it, lhal.Ihe poweis  
held by the Slates, are given to them by the Constitution  
ot Hie United Slates; and die inference (rum this principle,  
that the powers snppo-ed to be necessary, which are not  
so given to the Side Government*, must reside in the  
Government of the United States.  
“The respect, which is telt for every por&#x27;inn of the con­  
stituted authoiilies, lorbids some ol the reflections which  
tins singular paragraph might excite; and (hey are the  
more reaJily suppressed, as it may be presumed, with jus­  
tice, perhaps, as well as candour, that inadvertence may  
have had its share in the error. It would be an unjustifia­  
ble delicacy,-nevertheless, to pass hy so portentous a claim,  
proceeding from so high an authority, without a monitory  
notice ol ilia fatal tendencies with which it would be  
pregnant.  
“ Lastly, it is, that a law on (lie same subject with (he  
Alien Act, passed by this State otiginally in 1785, and re­  
enacted in 1782, is a prool that a summary removal ol  
suspected Aliens, was not heretofore regarded try the Vir­  
ginia Legislature, as liable to the objections now urged  
against such a measure.  
“This charge against Virginia vanishes before the sim­  
ple remark, that the law ol Virginia relate# to “suspicious  
“ persons, being the subjects ol any foreign poweror State,  
“ who shall have inculr a declaration of war, or actually  
** commenced hostilities, or horn whom the President  
“ shall apprehend hostile designs;&quot; whereas the art ol  
Congress relates to Aliens, being the subject# ol loreigu  
power* ami States, who have neither declared war, nor  
commenced hostilities, nor from whom hostile designs  
are apprehended.  
“ II. it is next affirmed ol ihe Alien Act, that it unites  
Legislative, Judicial, and Executive powers in the hands  
of the President.  
“ However ditiirnlt it msy be to mark, in every  
case, with dearness end certainty, the line which  
divides Legislative power, from the other departments  
of power; all v/ill agree, that the powers referred to  
these departments may be so general and undefined,  
as to lie ol a Legislative, not ol an Excrutive or Judi­  
cial nature; and may lor that reason be unconstitutional.—  
Details to a certain degree, are essential to the nature  
and character of a law; and on criminal subjects, it is pro­  
per, that details should leave as little as possible to (lie  
discretion ol those who are to a|&gt;ply and to execute the  
law. It nothing more were required, in exercising a  
Legislative trust, than a general conveyance ol aiiihoiily,  
without laying down any precise rules, by nljiclr the au­  
thority conveyed should be carried into effect; it would  
loilow, that Ihe w hole power ol legislation might he trans­  
ients! hy the Legislature from itself an/f proclamations  
might become substitutes lor laws. A delegation of pow­  
rr in this latitude, would not be denied to be a union of  
the different powers.  
“ 1 o determine, then, whether the appropriate powers of  
the distinct departments arc united by the act authorizing  
tbe Executive to remove Aliens, it must be enquired  
whether it contains such details, definitions and rules, as  
H|&gt;pcr(aiu to the true charade rot a law; especially, a law  
by which personal liberty is invaded, property de|&gt;rived ol  
its value to the owner, and iile itsell indirectly exposed to  
danger.  
&quot; The Alien Act declares, &quot; that it ahatl be lawful for  
(be President to order all such Aliens as lie shall judge  
dangerous to the peace and safotyol the United States, or  
shall have reasonable ground to suspect, are concerned in  
any ireasonabe, or secret machinations, against the Go­  
vet iimenl thereof, to depart,” Sir.  
“ Could a power be well given in terms leaa definife,  
less particular, and less precise f To be dangerous to  
the public sajety; to be suspected of secret machinations  
iigaiiMt the Government: these can never be mistaken lor  
l&lt; g.il rules er certain definition*. &#x27;I bey leave every tiling  
to the President. His will is the law.  
“ Hut, it is not a Legislative power only that is given to  
the Pro tilent. He is to stand in the p&#x27;ace ol Ihe Judicia­  
ry ul»o. lit* suspicion is Ihe only evidence which is to  
convict: his order, the only judgment which is to be exe­  
cuted.  
  
44 ■ I* President who*e will is to designate the  
«(Tensive conduct; it is Ins will, Hut is to • •certain the in- i  
dividual* on whom it i* charged; and it ia Ins (hat i»  
lo csitae the sentence to be executed. It ia rightly affirm­  
ed, therelote, that the act uui&#x27;ea Legislative and Judicial  
power a to tho«e ol the Executive.  
“ HI* ll i* affirmed, that »l»ie tfnlon of power subverts  
the general priucipla* of tree government.  
“It ha* become an axiom in the science of&#x27;governinent,  
• h.»l a separation of the Legislative, Executive, and Judi­  
cial departments, ia necessary to the preservation of pub­  
lic liberty. No where has thi« axiom been better under­  
stood in theory, or more eareluily pursued in practice, than  
in llie United Slates.  
“IV.. It ia affirmed that eneh a union of powers sub­  
veris the particular oiganization and positive provision* ol  
the Federal Constitution.  
“According to the p*r reular organization of Ibe Consti­  
tution, its Legislative powers sre vested in llie Congress,  
Its Executive powers in the President, and iia Judicial  
powers in a supreme and inferior tribunals. The union of  
any two ol these powers, and still more of all three, in  
niiy one ol theie departments, as lisa been shewn lobe  
dime by the Alien Art, must consequently subvert the  
constitutions! organization of thetn.  
“ I liai positive provisions, in the Constitution, securing  
lo individual* the benefit* ot lair trial, are also violated by  
tlip union ol powers in ibe Alien Arl, necessarily leeulis  
from the two tsets, that the set relaiee to Alien friend*, awl  
that Alien Mends being under tho municipal law only,  
■ re eiituleil lo its protection.”

ked more than the admission that aliens,  
u ft ether Jricnds or enemies,&quot; remain in our confedera­  
cy by the favor ot the Federal Government. I need not,  
I aui sure enter into an argument to prove the fallacy  
aye, the alarming tendency of this ultra Federal doe­  
trine, because it is studiously and conclusively refuted  
by Mr. Madisons able Report of &#x27;tty. An alien friend  
r« siding in the Mate ol V irginia, under the protection of  
oui municipal laws, can no more be removed by the Fe­  
deral Government than one of our native citizens Jo­  
on this branch of the subject, Mr. Madison&#x27;s Report ur.  
} ‘,c distinction between alien enemies and uliin  
Jricnds is a clear and conclusive answer to this argu­  
ment. Alien enemies are under the Lute of .Yativns, and  
liable to be punished lor offences against it. Alien  
Jricnds.except in the single case of public ministers, are  
under the municipal law, and must be trial and punish­  
rd according to that law only.&quot; Mr. Leigh makes no  
sueh distinction , hut subject* alien friends and alien cue­  
tntes alike,&#x27; u« did the Alien Law, to the power of tiie  
Genei.il Government, regardless of the protection of  
©late or municipal laws.  
  
iii reply to tiie argument of Mr. Leigh, that, &quot;the  
protection given aliens, whether friends o, enemies, is mat­  
ter oj Juror not ^tfjustice,” which is identically tiie ar­  
gument of the old Federalists while dVfbndi&#x27;ng tlie Alien  
Law, Mr. Madison says, “One argument offered in jus­  
riration of tins power, exercised over aliens, is, that  
their admission into the country being of furor, not of  
rMf&quot;L the favor is, at all timet*, revocable. To this  
argument it migh1 be answered, that, allowing the  
truth of the inference, it would be no proof of what is  
required. A question would still occur, whether the  
Constitution had vested tiie discretionary power of ad­  
mittingaliens in the Federal Government, or in tiie  
Mate Government*. Hut it cannot bo&#x27;a true infer­  
once, tiiat because the admission of an alien is u furor  
the lavor may be revoked at pleasure. A grant of  
land to an individual may be of furor, not of riuht •

“That the General Assembly doth also express its

¢l. The general phrases here meant must be those  
“of providing for the common defence and general wel­  
ifare.”  
“In the ¢Article of Contederation,’ the phrases are  
used as follows, in Art. VIII: &lt;All charges of war,  
and all other expenses that shall be incurred for the  
common defence and general welluwre, and allowed by  
the United States in Congress assembled, shall be de­  
frayed out of a common treasury, which shall be sup­  
plied by the several States, in proportion to the value  
of all land withia each State, granted to, or surveyed  
for, any person, as such land and the buildings and un­  
provements thereon shall be estimated, according to  
‘such mode as the United States in Congress asseniled  
shall from time to time direct and appoint.’  
““In the existing constitution, they make the follow­  
ing part of Sec. 8: *The Congress shail have power  
to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises,  
to pay the debts, and provide for the common defence  
and general welfare of the United States.’  
“T&#x27;his similarity in the use of these phrases in the  
two great feder.l charters, might well be considered  
as rendering their meaning less liable to e misconstru­  
ed in the latter; because it will scarcely be said, that  
in the former, they were ever understood to be either a  
general grant of power, or to authorize the requisition  
or application of money by the old Congress to the  
common defence and general welfave, except in cases  
afterwards enumerated, which explained and limited  
their meaning, and if such was the limited meaning  
attached to these phreses in the very instrument revis­  
ed and remudelled by the present constitution, it can  
never be supposed that when copied into this constitu­  
tion, a different meaning ought to be attached to thew.  
“That, notwithstanding this remarkable sccurity a­  
g inst mizconstruction, a design has been indicated to  
expound these phrases in the constitution, so as to de­  
stroy the effeet of the particular enumeration of pow­  
ers by which it explains and fimits them, must have  
fallen under the observation of those who have attend­  
ed to the course of public transactions. Not to multi­  
ply proofs on this subject, it will suffice to refer to the  
debates of the federal legislature, in which arguments  
have on different occasions been drawn, with apparent

?excise of such a pnwer.  
The amendments to Ihe Constitution expressly de­  
clare, that the powers granted to the Government &quot;shall  
not be construed to disparage the powers retained; and  
that the powers not granted shall be considered and ad­  
judged as reserved to the States respectively, or to tbe  
people.  
&quot;When the Constitution,&quot; 6ays Mr. Madison in his  
Report on the Alien and Sedition Laws, &quot;was under  
the discussion which preceded its ranficatiun, it is well  
. known that great apprehensions were expressed by ma­  
ny, lest the omission of some positive exciption fiom  
the powers delegated, of certain rights, might expo?e  
them to the danger of being drawn by construction within  
some of the powers vested in Congress; more especially  
of the power to make all laws necessary and proper for  
carrying (heir other powers into execution.&quot; In repl*  
to this objection |it was invariably urged to be a fun­  
damental |and characteristic principle of the Consti­  
tution, that all powers not given by it. were reserved;  
that no powers were given beyond those enurneiated in  
the Constitution, and such as were fairly incident to  
them.  
From this posture of the subject resulted the inter­  
esting question in so many of Ihe Conventions, wlie  
iher the doubts and dangers ascribed to ihe Constitu­  
tion, should be removed by any omendmcnts previous  
to the ratification, or be postponed in confidence lhat.??  
far as they might be proper, they would be introduced  
in Ihe form provided by ihe Constitution. &#x27;I lie Istlfr  
course was adopted; and in most of the States, the ra:i  
fications were followed by propositions and instruction1&#x27;  
for rendering the Constitution more explicit and mo&#x27;#  
safe to Ihe rights not meant to be delegated by it  
^In pursuance of the wishes Ihus expressed. Ihe fir?t  
Congress lhat assembled under the Constitution, p&#x27;&quot;  
posed certain amendments, which have since, by the ne­  
cessary ratifications, been made a part of it  
The proposition of amendments made by Congress,ss  
introduced in the following words:  
&#x27;&#x27;Ihe. Convention of a number of the States, hating, it  
the time of their adopting the Constitution, esprtsstd a  
desire, in order to prevent misconstruction or ah use oj its  
powers, thai further declaratory or restrictive rlnusts  
should be added; and, us extending me ground of public  
confidence in the Government, will best ensure the beneji  
cent ends of its institution &quot;  
Here is the most satisfactory and authentic proof, that  
the aeveral amendments proposed, were In be considered  
either declaratory or restrictive; and, whether the or.*  
or the other, as corresponding with a desire expre??rd  
by a number of the States, and as extending Ihe ground  
of public confidence in the Government  
Some of the acta of ratification by Ihe States expreifly  
declared, that every power noi granted by the Constit&quot;*  
tion remains with the people of the United States, aid  
at their will. And lhat no right of any denominate&quot;  
can be cancelled, abridged, restiained or modified, by

tives. by the President, or any Department or Officer of

tcil h&#x27;.nUi, and the Constitution of this State, a­  
jramst every affgresshin, either Ibueign or domestic,  
an.l t&#x27;.at they will support the Government of  
tl.e UnilcJ Slates in all measures warranted by the  
funnel.&quot;  
No unfavorable comment can have been m.J. m  
s&#x27;.M&#x27;.iitenW here expressed. To maintain and  
deii ml die Constitution of the United Slates, and  
uf their own 5taie, aiin.-t every agyiession, both  
f,rei;tn i.d domestic, &quot;and to6ii)poit the Govern­  
r..il &#x27;uf the United States in all measures warrant­  
e;l bv their Constitution, are duties which the Gen­  
eral Assembly outfit always lo feel, and to which,  
oil vieii an occasion, it was evidently proper to fx­  
puss tl.e&#x27;i&#x27; s:rece mid firm ndherenro.  
hi their nxt resolution &quot; The General Assem­  
blv mn t solemn y declares a warm attachment to  
the Union of the States, to maintain which, it  
p&#x27;Ck&#x27;jj&#x27;es all its powers ; and, that lor this md, it is  
their duty to waicti over and oppose every inliac­  
tion of th&#x27;ose iriucip&#x27;is, which cotntituto the only  
b.9 of that L&#x27;liinii, because a faithful observance  
ol t! phi en alone secure its existence and the pub­  
lic happiness.&quot;  
The observation just made is equally applicable  
to tli-s sob inn derla ration, of warm attachment to  
tl.e Union, and this solemn pledge to maintain it;  
tiur can any question arise among enlightened  
fiends of the Union, its to the duty ol watching  
over and opposing every infraction of those princi­  
ples which constitute its basis, and a faithful obser­  
ranre of which ran nlotie fecure l&#x27; existence, and  
the public happiness thereon depending.  
Tup third icsolution is in the words tallowing :  
&quot;That this Assembly doth explicitly and peuiitp­  
tori y tl clarc, that it views the powers of the red­  
era! GuuTiinienl, ns rcsit&#x27;img from the compact, to  
ii. i&#x27;ii iiie S&#x27;.au a aie parties, as limited by the plain  
!:. -ml intention of the instrument constituting  
t&#x27; il c inip.ir&#x27; as no further valid than they areau­

have ti e right, and are in duty bound, to iuterpi&#x27;se  
fr srreiti: g the progress ot tiiaevil, and for main­  
tilalcf wiibin their respective limits, the authori­  
Ki:, nghia and liberties appertaining to them.&quot;  
On this resolution the committee have bestowed  
S t! attention which its importance merits: They  
have scanned it not merely with a strict, but with a  
ewe eye ; and they feci confidence in pronoun­  
dag, that, iu iu jit and fair comitructiou, it i un­  
ftc (,tioi,al.l,&#x27; irue in its several positions, as well  
a constitutional and conclusive in its inferences :  
T&#x27;.p it solution declari s, fint; that &quot; it views the  
power ,, t,e Federal Governnieiit as resulting  
fiomthe compact to which the State) arc parties ;  
w outer woids, that the i ederal piweis are ilenveit  
fT) the Constitution; an.l that the Constitution is  
ejtnpact to which the States arc panics.  
Ciraras toe position must seem ihat the Federal  
piwers are derived from the Constitution, and from  
thit alnnc, tne committee are !ot unapprised of a  
!&#x27;!- doc&#x27;.rine, which openi another source of Fedcr­  
i powers not less extensive and important than it  
new and unexpected. The f xcniination of this  
&#x27;i&#x27;JCtnne will be most conTcniently connected with a  
fevii-itof a succeeiling resolution. The committee  
wiinfy theiosalves hcje with briefly remarking, that  
i&quot; i the op.titnporar? discusoiups and comments  
&quot;kith the Coiiotitu.ion underwent, it was con­  
fcUntiy j istiDed and recominended, on the ground

w tlilie&#x27;.J lroui it ; a.iJ that if any doubt could have  
txlste.l on this subji ct under the original text of  
&quot;e C &#x27;restitution, it is removed, as far as words  
tn&#x27;dJ lemove it, by the 12&#x27;h amendment, now a  
;-t of tlie Constitution, which expressly declares  
J: &quot; the powers not delegated to ttie United  
Sta&#x27;ps by the Cousi&#x27;ttution, nor prohibited by it to

The res.&#x27;.utii.ii l.av.i&#x27;g taken this view of the  
Federal compact, procuds t infer, &quot; that, in cn?e  
of a deliberate, p i pab&#x27;e an 1 Jai.gi roua exercise of  
other power, not gnuted by the said cotupoct, the  
Stites, who are parties thereto, have the right and  
are in dntv bound to interuo.-.- tor arresting the pro  
gress of the evil, an ! tor maintaining, within trier  
re-pmive hinits.lhe authorities, tights and hlnrliis  
apiieitalt.mg to them.&quot;  
Il apjjears to your ronnii tti e I be a plain princi­  
p&#x27;c, founded in common sense, illustrated by com­  
mon practice, and essential to the nature of com­  
puts that, where result cm be had lo no tribunal  
superior to the aothor ty of the parties, the pjilies  
themselves must be the righttul ju Igi h in the last  
lesoil, whether the bargain made has N i n put sued  
or violated. The Constitution of the Uiiiic.l States  
was firmed hy the auction of the States, given by  
each in it sovereign capacity. It add to Hie sta­  
bility and dignity, as well as to the authority of the  
Constitution, that it rests on this legitimate and solid  
louiidutioii. The Slates, then being the parlies to  
the constitutional compact, and in their novcmgn  
capacity, it follows of neceki&#x27;y, that there can be  
no tribunal above their authority, lo decide in the  
last resort, whether the compact made by them be  
violated; and, consequently, that, as the partnsto  
it, they must themselves decide iu the lust resort  
such questions as may be ol&#x27; tuflicieiit magnitude to  
nquire their interposition.  
Il does not follow, however, thai because the  
Slates, ns sovereign parties to their constitutional  
compact, must ullimtttely decide uhetl.er it has  
been violated, that such a decision i tight tj be in­  
terposed, cither in a liuiy Dimmer, or on doubtful  
arid inferior occasions. F.vrn in the case of or  
dintiry conventieiis beten dillereni nations,  
where, by the strict rule ot uiternieliitton, u btem.h  
of a putt may be deemed a breach otgr whole;  
every pint being deemed n condition of evety  
other part, and ol the whole it is always hud  
down that the brench must be both willul and ma­  
terial to justify tin application of l!.u tide. Hut  
in the case of ,an inhmmo und cotisiiluliotiiil  
Union, !.!,e llltit of tl.e I&#x27;mted Stales, it is evi­  
Jrnt (lint hip intci position of the pin lies, in theit  
soveieigu e.ijiiifity, cull be fulled lor by occa­  
sions only, deeply mid e:-.eiilini:y uHectin the  
ilal priiRiplcs ol their pi lnical s).iKiu.  
&#x27;I&#x27;he resolution has, accordingly, guarded  
against any lii.siippn hensioii of its object, by  
expressly requiring fur such an interposition,  
&quot;the case of a deliberate, palpably uud d.uigeious  
bieach of the Crtistitutton, by the cxcicise of  
power not granted by il.&quot; It must be a case  
not of u light and liansient naluie, but of n mi­  
line dangerous to the great purposes lor which  
the Constitution was cctublished. It must be a  
case, moieover, not obscure or doubtful in its  
construction, but plain and palpable. Lastly, it  
must be u case not lesulting from partial conside­  
ration or hasty determination ; but a case stamp­  
ed with a final consideration and deliberate adho  
rence. it is not necessary, because the tesolu­  
ttoti does not require that the question eliouid be  
discussed, how lur the txeicise of any particular  
power, uiigtunled by the Constitution, would jus­  
tify the intcrpoMtioii of the parties to it. A cases  
might easily be stnltd which none wuulJ contend  
ought to tail within that description; casts, on  
thu other hand, might, with equal ease, be stated,  
so flagrant and so tuial us (o unite evuy opinion  
in placing tliem within the dckcnpiioii.  
ilut thu resolution tins done moie than guard  
against misconstruction, by t-xpiesely relerrn g to  
case of a deliberate, palpable, mid dangerous  
nutuic. Il specilies the objeit of the interpooi­  
tion which it contemplates, lo be solely thai ol  
utifsling the progtcr of Iho evil of usurpation,  
and of iiiaiutaiiiing&#x27; the aulhoillitjj, tights, and lib­  
eilies appcitainiiig lo the btales, as putlics to the  
CoIlbtllUIIOII.  
From this view of the resolution, it would  
seem inconceivable that it can incur any just ui.s­  
approbation Irom lhoe who, hiyiug asido all ino­  
iiientiiiy itiipicsaiotiii, and rccolitcl.iig the gctiuiiie  
nourcu and object of the Fedeial Constitution,  
i-hull candidly uud accuiati ly inteiptct the mean­  
ing of iho Genual Assembly. Il ihu deliberate  
exercise ol dangerous power;, paliibly withheld  
by the Coiistituuoii, could not jut-lily the parties  
to it, in iiitei i&#x27;ii-oiig even so bit as lo in rest the  
progress of iho evil, and thereby lo ptesme the  
Constitution itetlt, a well a lo provide fur the  
safely of hie parties lo it, theie Mould be un ( i.d  
tu ml rehil truiii usutpc-d pon, and u direct  
subversioii of the rights ppccilied cr recognised  
under all the Stale Coustiuitions, u well as u  
plain denial of tne fundamental principle on hIiicu  
our independence itself was declared.  
Hut it is objected that the judicial authority is  
to be regarded as the sole expositr r of the Con­  
stitution in the lust resort ; uud il may be asked  
for what leason the declaration by the General  
Assembly, supposing it to be ilo orelically true,  
could be required at ihe present day, and in so  
solemn a manner.  
On (his objection, it might be observed, firtt,  
that there my be instances of usurped power,  
which Ihe forms of the Constitution would never  
draw w ithin the control of the Judicial department:  
ttcouiUu, that if the decision of Ihe Judiciary be  
raised ubove ibe authority of the sovereign par  
ties lo the Constitution, ibe decisions of the other  
deDarfments, not cariied by tbe forms of the Con  
stitution before the Judicial y, must be equally au-  
thoiitative and final with t.ie decisions ol tnatde  
paitinjpul. Bat the proper answer to the objec  
tion is, that he resolution of Ibe General Assem­  
bly relates to ;liO-.e greft svA rvrwhnmy cases.  
iu wliicti ail luc oiu.j oi i s i j ...i . im  
prove inciTectu.il a-ainst infrictt&#x27;.n danger&#x27; u lo  
die essenlip.l t;ght of ihe ptut.es to it. &#x27;1 he reso­  
lution supposes (hat dai.gerojs powers not dele­  
gated, may not only be usurped and executed bjf  
  
the other licparl.nents, but that tha Judicial Pe-  
  
parlmtnt a. si may exercise or sanction daiiir  
oi powers beyond the giant of th Constitution;  
and consequently, that the lilt mate rihtof the  
p.irttes to the l&#x27;oiilitui&#x27; in to jod;e whether the  
compact h.i been dingerousiv violated, must ex  
lend to notations bf ime driegated authority, as  
ell as by another ; by tlm Ja tieiarv, a welt as  
by the FxecuUve cir ihe Leg&#x27;slature.  
Howeer true, therefore, il maybe, that the judi  
out depaiWnent is. id all questions subtil tied to it  
hv the forms of the Constitution, to decide in the  
last resmt, this rert must ne cturiif b(leeiiid  
the last in relation to the anihoiities of the other  
departments of ihe (Internment; not in re latum lo  
the rights nf the parties to the constitutional com­  
pact. Iiom which the Judical as well as tbe oilier  
departments Imld tlie.r delegated trust. On any  
otl.ei hypothesis, the delegation of jud&#x27;Cia! powei  
would annul Ihe power delegating it; and the  
concurrence of this department with the o&#x27;hers in  
usurped lowers might subvert fuiefrr, and be­  
yond the possible ten ti nf nny nghtful leiueilv,  
the very Constitution winch all were instituted 1 1  
jitescive.

design to expound ceilain general phrasi s, (which  
luiviog been copied from the my limned grant ol

w ere the less liable lo be intseotistrued,) so as tu

the obiious tendency and inevitublo tesult of  
which would be to transform Ihe presen; Repub­  
lican system of the l uiti d Stales into nil abso­  
lute, or at best a mixed monarchy.&quot;  
Thu first question licit; lu he considered is,  
whether a spirit has in sundiy intiauccs bei u  
niniilcslcd by the Federal Government lo enlarge  
its powers by Ibrcid consti uctions of the consti­  
tutional charter.  
ThaCencril Assembly having declined llieir  
opinion uieiely by regretting in genual terms llmt  
forced consttuclion for ( uiaiguig the Fsderal  
poweis have taken place, it docs not appear lo  
Ihe conimitlee m cessary to go into u specifica­  
tion of if cry instance lu which the resolution may  
uiludu. The Alien and Sedition Actntcing par  
ticularly named in a succeeding resolution, ate of  
course lo be understood as included in the allu­  
sion. Omitting others which have Jess occupied  
public attention, or been less extensively legntd­  
cd as unconstitutional, the resolution may be pre­  
sumed to refer particularly to the 11. ink law,  
which, from the circuni-lames ol us passage, a  
well as the latitude ol coiistiuctiou on winch it i.-,  
foundud, slnkcs (he attention with s nguliir force,  
and the carriage tux, dtslingtiibhed also by cir­  
cumstances in its histoiy having a nnoi.it ten­  
dency. Those insUticts alone, if le.-olting from  
forced construction and calculated lo en lingo the  
poucis of the Federal Government, as the coin­  
inittee cannot but conceive to be the case, sufli  
cieutly warrant tins part of the tesoluiion. The  
committee have nut thought it un u.ubeiit on Ihem  
to extend their attention to laws whit h have been  
objectsd to, rather as varying the coii&#x27;litulioual  
distnbutioii of powers in tlm Fideial Govern­  
ment, ihan as un absolute enlargement (d lliem;  
because instance ol this sott, however linioi!iti,l  
iu their principles and tendencies, do not appear  
lo lull stiictly within Ibe text under u w.  
The other questions piesetiting themselves,  
are  
1. Whether indication have appeared of a do­  
Mgn to expound ceiUin gerictal pluascs, c pn d  
Iiom llie &quot; As ticles ot Confederation,&quot; so 81 to

3. &#x27; hettitr the tendency and ti sull of Una con­  
solidation would bu lo liaiisloim tue lit qiuLiiicim  
system of thu Uli.Ud States l. .to n inoimtchy.  
1. The general pbiases here incanl, must be  
those &quot;of providing lor ihe common duletice uud  
geneial wehaie.&quot;  
In Ihe &quot; Articles of Coufedeiaiion,&quot; the plnasv  
ate ued as follows, in Ail. Mil: &quot; Ail ciiatges  
of war, and aH other expenses taut eball be incur­  
led lor the common dtltucu and general wellare,  
and allowed by the United Slates iu Cougitss as­  
sembled, stall be defrayed out of a common trea­  
sury, which shall be supplied by the several  
fttatts in proportion to ihe value ol all land wilu­  
iii each State, grunted to, or suif eyed lor any per  
sou, as such laud and the buildings unci improve­  
ments liieieon shall be estimated, accuidmg to  
such mode as the United States in Uougieas  
assembled shall, Irjm time to lime, direct uud ap­  
point.&quot;In the existing Constitution they mako the fol­  
lowing pan of section :&quot; 1 he Congress shall  
have power to lay and collect tsxe, duties, im­  
posts, and excises, to pay the debts, and piovidu  
lor the common deleuce and general wellare ol  
the United States.&quot;  
This similarity in Ihe use of these phrases in  
ibe two grsat Federal charters, imgbl well be  
considered as rendering their meaning less Ita­  
lic lo U misconstrued in the latter, txtauau- it  
wni ncaiciy b .a.i ;h-t ui lie Lr.y.tt tLy  
ever understood to be tilt.tr a geneiul giant of

j m.ui di fence an.l genersl welfare, except in the  
  
cae atieiwnrds tnuineitd, which explained  
and hunted titer miauinj ; and if ur!i was the  
hunted meaning attached lo these phrases in the  
trv insl-urt&#x27;ent reused arid remodelled by the  
pre-enl Con.-titulioti, it can r.sver be supposed  
tu.it hi t ropied into ttiis C institution ad ifrr­  
eut ineiiiiitig (night to be attached to them.  
T hat. n.-U&#x27;thjianJ ng this remarkable seemty  
ngsinst nncoiis:riirlif n. a di ign ha been indi­  
cated to expound these ph-nsi-s in the Constitu­

He there contends that it is left &quot;to the discretion of the  
national legislature to pronounce upon the objects which  
concern the General ll&#x27;ilfarr, and for which, under that  
description, an appropriation of money is requisite and  
proper. And there seems to be no room for n dnuht,  
that whatever concerns the priiirut interests if learn­  
iiiis, of agriculture, of manufactures, and of commerce,

regards an application of motif if.&quot; It is a superfluous  
task to refute thi* sweeping and obnoxious doctrine?  
since Mr. Madison, in his famous Jieport of IK), has  
blown it sky-higli.  
But this movement upon the public Treasury is now  
to lie repeated. It comes in aid of Mr. Clay&#x27;s Lund  
Hill. It is the great hobby which the Whigs are now

tiiiJ faithful iuvesiiatioti ; for the length of which,  
  
no other apology will be necessary.

In order to clear ltl8 way for a correct view o  
  
Ihe first position, several observations will be pre-  
  
misi&#x27;d.  
In iIip r.rU nbire; il is to borne ill mmo. that  
  
itlicinir n .-hariirierislic featuie of the Federa  
  
Cunstihitioii at it was originally ratified, nnd an

every other exercise of power by the Fedi nil do-  
  
vfrt.inent, 10 prove, fiom the Conmiiution, ui. u  
grants l!in paiticular power exercised.  
The nexi observation to be made, is, ihal  
&#x27;Mitch confusion and fallacy have been thrown  
into ihu question, bv blending the two cases ol  
aten, mtmbm of a hotltlt nation ; nnd an,  
members f feinldlu nalion. These two cases  
  
are so nhviouly and so essentially distinct, &#x27;Vi.V,  
il occasions, no little surprise thai the tiVauiCtion  
should havo been disregarded : and th surprise  
is so much the greater as it opfecia that the two  
rises are actually dUtinctv.sh.bd by two separate  
Acts of Congresi, passed at the fame nession,  
mid comprised in the same publication ; ihe one  
providing for the case of &quot;alien enemien,&quot; ihe  
&#x27;other &quot;concerning aliens&quot; indiscriminately, and  
consequently extending to aliens of every nation  
in peco and Hinity with the foiled States. N ilh  
ft&#x27;pect to alien enemies, no doubt h is been inti­  
mated as to the Federal authority ovu them ; ihe  
t&#x27;onslitulion having expresrly delegated to C on  
gtcjs tho power to deflate war against any nation,  
ad of course lo treat it and all its members as  
ncinies. AVith respect to aliens who are not  
fnrmie. but mmbir of n itions in peace and  
  
fimiiy with the United Stales, the power assumed  
  
the Act of Congress is denied to be consii­  
biiionul; and it i? aetordingly against tins Acl  
&#x27;hut the pro!e.l of ihe Getu ral Assembly is tx­  
!&#x27;nsly nnd eSelusively directed.  
, A third ooscrvalion&#x27;is, that, were it admitted, as  
conictidntl, thai the &quot;Act concerning Aliens&quot;  
for ils objects not a ptna!, but a prtcvitire  
j&#x27;ubce, it would still remain to be proved that il  
cornet within the consliltilional power of theFe-&quot;t-.&#x27;ol  
Legislature : and, if within its power, that  
!;&#x27; Legislature has txticised it in a cotislitti­  
&#x27;i0!&#x27;..! Manner.  
In ihe administration of preventive justice, the  
  
Uiowipg principles have been held sacred ; that  
ame probable ground uf suaniciori be exhibited

CouchulrJ.  
Frnin the review thus taken of llie situ;t:m of  
the American colunics piior to theirituh-pen-il&#x27;iitej  
of th etfett of tins event on their ?itu;t­  
ftn ; of the nature ami tiiijxi: t of the Articles of  
Coiifi deration ; of the tiur meaning of the pas­  
Mge, in the existing Coiistituli&quot;ii, (ruin hu h the  
cointn.iii law has In en deduced j of llierlillieul-fit-  
and uneertainties incidi nt to the doctrine ;  
iwd of it vast consequences in extending llie  
powirs of the Feih nil (ioveriuiient, and in mi­  
wrcediiip the nutliorilios of the Stale (t&#x27;ovetn­  
iinits ; the Coinmilteo feel the utmost confi­  
dfneo in eoneludiiij; that the common law never  
win, nor by any fair construction ever can be,  
Jeeintd a law for the American People, as one  
community ; and they indulge thii 8!roiif;est tx­  
peclution thut the same conclusion will fniuily bo  
drawn by all candid and accurate inquirers into  
tU subject. It is, indeed, distressing to reflect  
tl,:! it cvPrhould have been made a question  
wh&#x27;tltcr t!io Constitution, on tho whule face of  
hi&#x27;&quot;h is seen so ntuch labour to enumerate and  
ierina tho several objects of federal power,  
e mid iiitrnd to introduce in the lump, in an indi­  
tect manner, and by a forced construction of a  
few phrases, tho vast and multifarious jurisdiction  
involved in the common law ; a law filling so ma­  
iiv aaijiic volumes ; a law overspieadiug the en­  
t iefii M of legislation ; and n law that would  
up tha found tlion of the constitution as a system  
of limited and specified powers. A severer re­  
proach could not, in the opinion of the Commit­  
tec, he thrown on the Constitution, on those who  
fumed, or on those who established it, than such  
a supposi&#x27;ion would throw on them.  
Tho argument, then, diawn frmn the common  
law, on the ground of its being a jopied or re­  
C&#x27;lfniai &#x27;d by thfl constitution, being inapplicable  
lo the Sedition Act, tho committee will proceed  
to examine the other arguments which have bcn  
founded on the constitution.  
l&#x27;lify tviil wis&#x27;e but little lane on the attempt to  
e-iter the Act by the preamble lo the constitution;  
it hr:r,g contrary lo every acknowledged rule of  
c instruction to set up thU part of an instrument in  
&#x27;piHiiion to (hv plan meaning expressed in the  
body of the instrument. A pieaiubie uiuaKy con­  
wijtlie g, neral motives or reasons for the particu­  
arn&#x27;f illations or measures whirli lolhw it; a ml is  
iliwys understood to Ite explained and limited by  
da&#x27;m. In i he present instaucf, a contrary intcriire-  
!atn would have the inadmissible i-llect of reiider-  
mi; nugatory or improper every part of the coiisl1­  
&#x27;.Uii&#x27;in which Ruree-ds the preamble.  
The paragraph in Aiticle 1, .Sections, vviiich con­  
l.iiiii the power to lay and collect taxes, unties, im­  
?istsaad excises, to pay the debts and provide for  
t.&#x27;ie common detencc and general welfare, having  
leu already examined, will also require no particu­  
lurmtcmiou in this place. It will have been seen  
&#x27;i&#x27;Jt, in h fair and consistent meaning, ii cannot  
fnjtrje t)ii enumeiated powers vested in Congress.  
The part nf the constitution Which seems most to  
recurred to in the defence of the &quot;Sedition  
Act,&quot; ti the las&#x27;, clause of the dbove section, cm­  
Pnwering Conyrcgs &quot;to make all laws which shall  
W necessary and proper for carrying into execution  
lh foregoing powers, and ail other powers vested  
by this constitution tn the Government of the Uni­  
ted States, or in any department or officer tU reof.&quot;  
The plain import of this clause is, that Congress  
tall have all the incidental or inHrwnental powers  
iioces&#x27;iry aru proper for carrying into execution al!  
Hie express powers ; whether they lie vested in the  
IWfermiient of the United States,&quot; more collectively,  
&#x27; a the several departments or officers thereof. It  
J&#x27; nt a grant of new powers toCongiess, but mere-  
a declaration, for the removal ol ail uncertainty,  
11 t Hie mentis ofcairying into execution those  
f&#x27;berwise g-aiited are included in the giant  
beiiever, therefore, a question srises concern­  
r?1hc constitutionality of a particular power, the  
lust q tesrion is whether llie ower Deexprtwed in  
constitution. If it be not expressed, the noxt  
&#x27;aqu,ry must be, w helher il n properly an incident  
j0.?&quot; express power, and necessary to its ixicution.  
if be, it nny he exercised by Congress. If il be  
! lh (-oppress cannot exercise it.  
L&#x27; t the question be asked, then, whether the povv­  
&quot;&quot;&#x27;&quot;ver the i, rest, eri rrmpil in iiie &quot; Sedition Act,&quot;  
found among the powers expressly vested in the  
- &quot;&#x27;ere r i t.t.j is not pretended.  
there any express power, for executing which,  
t is a ni cs.Sdry and p-oper power 1  
llie power which has been selected, as least re­  
&#x27;e, in answer to this question, is that &quot;of sup­

In the attempts to vindicate the &#x27;Sedition Act,&quot;  
it has been concluded, 1. That the &quot; f ied.1111 of  
the piess&quot; is 10 he delcriiiined by the nuaiiingol

uial lo Conoressof nil p.owt rover ihe pirss, it in:tv  
not be iisele-s to muke the lliilowmg oli.rrv.ilions  
on the first id&#x27; them.  
Il is deemed to be a sDim I oji.n.un, that the Se­  
dition Act, in its definition ol some ol the c limes  
created, is an abtidgurni ol the lieedoui of pubh­  
cation recognised by priueipts ol the ciii,iii,ii law  
in England.  
Tho freedom of the press, under the common  
law, is, in the deli nees ol the Sedition Act, made to  
con-!: in an ex niptiun Ironi all prrvivui restraint  
on printed puhheiilioiis, by jiersoiis autlioiii d lo in­  
spect and prohibit llit in. It appears to the com­  
mittee that tins nira of the lieedoui of the press can  
ni&#x27;vi r l e auiiiitti d to be the American idea of it,  
sine a law inll, cling penalties on piimc l pub&#x27;i a­  
tniiis would have a similar tlh ct with a law author­  
iing a previous restraint 011 then. Il would &amp; em  
a mockery to say that no law should be passi , pre­  
venting publications from being made, but that  
laws might be pas-icd lor pnnNiing them 111 case  
thev should be niRile  
The essential dilli.rei.ee between the IJiiti-li Go­  
vernment and the American Constitution will place  
this s.ihjecl in the clearest light.  
In the Uriiish Government, the danger of en­  
croaeliinents on the righls of the ople is uii.hr­  
slood to be confined to the Executive M.iu&#x27;slrale.  
The rrpiesciitiitives of the people, ill the ie.&#x27;isla­

such as tiieir Maifiia Cliarta, their Ii.il ol li.-&#x27;lus,  
ix.e., are not leafed again. I tiie I&#x27;ari.aineoi, but  
against the Hoyal pieiogative. &#x27;l&#x27;hey aie merely  
legislative precautions against Executive usurpa­  
tions. Under such a Government as this, nn ex­  
emption of the press hom previous restraint, by h­  
cetiscrs appointed by the Kinj, is ail ihc lieedoui  
that ran bo secured lo it.  
In the United States, the case is altogether (lifer­  
ent. The J&#x27;iople, not the Government, msc.H the  
absolute sovereignty. The legislature, no h ss than  
the Executive, is under limitations of power. En­  
cmaehmcnla arc regaide d as pussibie fioto lb ni.e  
as well as from the other, Hence, in the United  
iiatcs, ihe great and e-8eiilial rights of Ihe pc pie  
are se-curcd against legislative as well as executive  
ambition, &#x27;l&#x27;hey are secured, not by the laws para­  
mount to prerogative, hut by Constitutions para­  
mount 10 laws. This security of tin; free dom of  
the press requires that it slmuiel be exempt, iml on.y  
from previous resirauit by the Executive, as 111  
Great lJritain, but from legi.-lativc reslraint also,  
and ibis excnipticn, lo be tfliclual, tiuist be an ex­  
emption, not only hotn the previous insjM-e&#x27;ioii ol  
lie n-cs, but lio&#x27;ii the S&#x27;lb-etpu tit penally of laws.  
Tit st..&#x27;e el me pre -ft, theieiore, tiinler Ihe rom­  
nion irw, cannot, 111 tins punt of view, be the it.111­  
dard of its freedom in the United Sinn.  
But there is another view under which it may lie  
ne cessary to consider this subject, h may be al­  
leged thai, aillimgh Ihe security lor the freedom of  
tlie press be d.noretit in Great Diii.iiii and in this  
country, being a lejn! security in the former, and a  
coiistitui.iiat sccunty in the latter; and although  
there may be a liir her d die re nee, in an e xte n-non ol  
the free dom ol the press, here, beyond an exemption  
from previous restrain J to an exemption from sub­  
sequent jietiallics alsoj.yet that the actual legal  
freedom of the press, under the common law, must  
determine the eicgrec of freedom which is meant  
by the term&quot;, and which is constitutionally secured  
b gainst both pievious and subsequent restraints.  
The committee are not unaware of the d Miculiy  
of all general questions wi tch may turn on the  
proper boundary between the liberty and licentious­  
ness of the press. Tlcy will leave it, (here tore, lor  
ronsiileration only, how Ihr the ciillerciice ltwten

no trace of improper meant ha appeared, Ann if  
tlc otiicr State had concurred in making like t-e-  
laration, supposed, tun, by the numerous appltca­  
tiona ftowina immediately from the tK-ople, it can  
scarcely be doubled lhat these simple inetm would  
have been at sufficient at Ihey are unexceptionable.  
It is unless certain that olher means tntirht have  
been employed, which tie strictly within the limits  
ol ihe Constitution. The Legislatures of Ike Slates  
might have made a direct representation to Con­  
gress, with a view to obtain a rescinding of the  
iwooflensive Act : or, lliey rnighl h ive represented  
to their respective Scnaioie in Congress their wih  
that two tlurd thereof would propone an explanato­  
ry enierdiik-iil iiHhc Cniisiiiuiion : or two third of  
themselves, if surh had been their option, might, by  
an application lo Congress, have obtained a Conven­  
tion for the tame object.  
These several meant, though not equally eligible  
in themselves, nor probably lo the atatca. were an  
constitutionally nncn for consideration. Aad il Ihe  
General Attcrhbly, after declaring the two Acts to  
be unconstitutional, the firtt and most obvious pro  
eecsliug on the subject, did not undertake to point  
nut to the olher State a choice among the further  
measures that might become necessary and proper,  
the reserve will not be mitconiirucd by liberal minds  
into any culpable imputation.  
These observation appear to for m a satisfactory  
reply to every ohjeeiioii which in nut founded on a  
misconception of the terms employed in the resolii  
tkins. &#x27;I here is one other, however&#x27; which may be  
ol too much importance not to be added. Il cannnt  
be liirgotien, thai among ths argument addressed  
lo those who apprehend danger to liberty from the  
establishment ol the General Government over to  
great a country, the appeal was emphatically made  
to the intermediate exigence of the Stale liiivern­  
menu, between the people, and that Government, to  
the tigilance wuh which lliey would ilecry the lirst  
aymplom ol usurpation, and to ihe promptitude  
with which they would sound the alarm to the pui  
ho. This argument w;u pmbibly not without iis  
eiuci ami ii it was a pmpor one men in recom  
mend the establishment ol the Ustiluiinn, it must  
bi a proper one nmv to assist in its interpretation,  
The only part of the two concluding tesoliiiinns  
thai remains lo bo noticed, it the repetition, in the  
first, of that warm alkctinn to the Union, ami its  
members, and of ihil scrupulous fidelity to the Con  
atitutioa, which have been invariably fall by the  
People of this State. At the proeeediitgi were in  
traduced with these sentiments, they could not he  
more proH:rly closed than in the tome manner.  
Should there be any to lar misM at to call in qui t­  
tion the sincerity of these professions, whatever re­  
gret may be exciter! by ihe error. Ihe General As­  
sembly cannot descend into a discussion of&#x27;it. Thou­  
who have listened to the suggestion can only be li lt  
to iheir own recollection ol Ihe part which this  
Slate his borne in the establishment of our Nation­  
al Independence, in the establishment of our Nation­  
al Constitution, and in maintaining under it the au­  
thority and Iswt nl ihe Union, without a single ex­  
ception of internal resistance or commotion. Ily  
recurring to the fact thev will be ablu to convince  
themselves that the HeprcscnUiivct of the People  
of Virginia must be above the necessity of opposing  
any other shield to attacks on their national patriot­  
ism, than their own C&#x27;)nicirn(iJiisnt&#x27;s.s and the jus­  
tice of an enlightened public who will perceive in  
the resolutions thcrasclvet the strongetl evidence of  
attachment both to the Constitution and Ihe Union,  
since it it only by mainlaiaing the dillercnt govern­  
mentt and dermrinicnis within iheir respective lim­  
its, that the blessings of eilhcr ran be pcrpctunied.  
The extensive view ol the subject llius taken by  
the Committee has led ilicm ti report lo the House,  
at the result of the whole, the following resolution:  
Retolrtd, That the General Assembly, having  
carefully and rcspcctfullp attended to ihe proceed­  
ings of a number of the States, in Rnswer to iheir  
resolution of December 21, 199, and having ac­  
curately and fully re-examined and re-considered  
the latter, find il to be their indispensable duly to  
adhere to the came, as founded in truth, a conso­  
nant with the Constitution, and as conducive in its  
preservation ; and more especially to be their duty  
to renew, at lliey do hereby renew, their protest

force to the measures of this administration,  
upon which I have animadverted than liiose  
against which it was directed. It says:  
&#x27; That the obvious tendency and inevitable result  
of a consolidation of the Slates into one sovereignty,  
would be to transform the republican system of the  
United States into a monarchy, is a point which seeins  
to have Iteen &#x27;sufficiently decided by the genrtal sen­  
timent of America. In almost every instance of dis  
i ussion relating to the consolidation in question, its  
certain tendency to pave the way to monarchy, seems  
n.it to have been contested. The pros poet of such a  
consolidation has formed the only topic of controversy.  
It would 1m* unnecessary, therefore, for the committee  
to dwell long on the reasons which support the posi­  
tion of&#x27; the General Assembly. It may not be impro­  
|ier, however, to remark two consequences, evidently  
flowing from an extension of the fed&lt;-ral power to  
every subject fulling within the idea of the &#x27; general  
welfare.&#x27;  
One consequence must 1?\ to enlarge the sphere of  
discretion allotted to the Executive Magistrate. Even  
within the legislative limits, pro[K&#x27;rly defined by the  
Constitution, the difficulty of accommodating legal  
regulations to a country so great in extent, and so va­  
nous in its circumstances, had been much felt, and has  
led to occasional investments of power in the Execu­  
tive, which involve perhaps as large a portion of (lis  
cretion as can lie deemeo consistent with the nature  
ol&#x27; the executive trust.  
&quot;In pro|N&gt;rtion as the objects of legislative care  
might he multiplied would the time allowed for each Is­  
diminished, and the difficulty of providing uniform and  
particular regulations for all tie increased, from these  
sources would necessarily ensue a greater latitude to  
the agency qf that department which is always in e.r­  
istence, and which could best mould regulations of a  
general nature, to as to suit them to the diversity of  
particular situations. And it is in this latitude, as a  
supplement to the deficiency of the laws, that the de­  
cree of executive prerogative materially consists.&quot;  
These, fellow-citizens, are the grounds of my  
objection to the re-election of Mr. Van Buren,  
and which have determined me to opnosc it by  
:ill fair and honorable means. You will perceive  
that all have arisen siuce his election, and dur­

(3d Resolution.) Mr. Madison’s Report of ’’99-1500, in comment-  
ing upon this resolution, declares that it ‘‘relates to those great  
and extraordinary cases in which all the forms of the Constitution  
may prove ineffectual against infractions dangerous to the essen-  
| tial rights of the parties to it. The resolution supposes that dan-  
| gerous powers, not delegated, may not only be usurped and execu-  
ted by the other departments, but that the judicial department also,  
may exercise or sanction dangerous powers beyond the grant of  
| the Constitution, and consequently Ghat the ultimate right of the  
| parties to the Constitution, to judge whether the compact has been  
| dangerously violated, must extend to violations by one delegated  
| authority, 2s well as by another; by the Judiciary, as wellas by  
the Executive, or the Legislature.

The fourth resolution stands as follows:  
  
“That the General Assembly doth also express its deep regret,  
  
thata spirit has, in sundry instances, been manifested by the Fe- |  
  
decal Government, to enlarge its powers by forced constructions of  
the constitutional charter which defines them; and that indica-  
tions have appeared of a design to expound certain general phrases,  
(which, having been copied from the very limited grant of powers in  
  
the former Articles of Confederation, were the less liable to be mis- |  
  
construed,) so as te destroy the meaning and effect of the particu-  
Jar enumeration which necessarily explains and limits the general  
phrases; and so as to consolidate the States, by degrees, into one  
sovereignty, the obvious tendency and inevitable result of which  
would be to transform the present Republican system of the Uni-  
ted States into an absolute, or at best, a mixed monarchy.”  
  
“The first question here to be considered is, whether  
  
a spirit has in sundry instances been manifested by the |  
  
Federal Government to enlarge its. powers ‘by forced  
constructions of the Constitutional charter.  
  
“The General Assembly having declared their opini-  
on, merely, by regretting in general terms, that forced  
constructions for enlarging the Federal powers have  
  
taken place, it does not appear to the Committee ne- |  
  
cessary to go into a specification of every instance to  
which the resolution may allude. The Alien and Se-  
dition acts being particularly named ina succeeding  
resolution, are of course to be understood as included  
in the allusion. Omitting others which have less oc-  
cupied public attention, or been less extensively re-  
garded as unconstitutional, the resolution may be pre-  
  
sumed to refer particularly to the Bank law, which from |  
  
the circumstances of its passage, as well as the latitude  
  
of construction on which it is founded, strikes the at- |  
  
tention with singular force, and the carriage tax, dis-  
tinguished also by circumstances in its history having  
asimilartendency, Those instances alone, if resulting  
from foreed construction, and calculated to enlarge the  
  
powers of the Federal Govéfnment, as the Committee |  
  
cannot bat conceive to be the case, sufficiently warrant  
this part of the resolution. The Committee have not  
thought it incumbent on them to extend their attention  
to laws which have been objected to, rather as varying  
  
the Constitutional distribution of powers in the Fede- |  
ral Government, than as an absolute enlargement of |  
  
them; because instances of this sort, however unportant  
in their principles and tendencies, do not appear to fall  
strictly within the text under view.”

Whatever room n:Wht l?e found in the proceedings  
! of gome of tlic States, who have disapproved the  
I resolutions of the General Assembly of this Coi.inon­  
i wealth, passed on the Jisl day of December, 1 tor  
remarks on the spirit and manner of tii&gt; ? pro­  
ceedings, it appears to the Committee most co distent  
? with the doty as well as d.grniy of the General . ?t m­  
hly, tu hasten an oiiiivion &lt;?! everv circumstance iii&lt;*ii  
might bti construed into adiminution of mutual inspect,  
confidence und affection, among the members of tin­  
L n. *ii  
The Committee have di ctned it a more.useful task,  
to revise with a criiicaleye, the resolutions which have  
met with this disapprobation : tu examine fully &#x27;ho se­  
veral objections and drgumenls which have kpy a red  
against them ; and to enquire whether there b? ury rr- j  
rors &lt;,f fact, of principle, or of reasoning, v.*k\ the

Rnolretl, That the General Assembly of Virgir.i i  
111!&#x27; th unequivoe illy express a iirm resolution to tuain­  
&quot; tain and defend the Constitution of the I nitedl  
&quot;States, and tiie Constitution of this State, against)  
&quot;every aggressh either h.reign or domestic, and that  
&quot;tlj&#x27;-y will support the Government of the United  
&quot;Slates in all nu-asnres warranted bv till former. &quot;  
.No unfavorable comment can have been made on t&#x27;: ?  
sentiments here expressed. To maintain and dcleud  
the Constitution of the U. S., and of their own State,,  
against every aggression, b?tii foreign and domestic,  
and to support the Government of the I*. S. in ail mea­  
sures warranted by their Ci nstitution, arc duties which .  
the General Assembly ougft always to feel, and it  
v.iii :h,on sm ii an occasion, it was evidently proper t  
express th&lt; ir Mn-&#x27;cre and livm atllu r.&#x27;ne.*.  
in their next resolution?&quot;&#x27;J&#x27;he General Assemblvj  
&quot; most solemnly deelar ?! a warm attachment to the  
&quot; Union of the Slahto maintain which it pledges all  
&quot; its power.*-; and that, f&lt; r this end, it tin ir duty to  
&quot; watch ov&lt; ?? and oppr se every infraction &lt;?; tie:. &quot; j!r::i­  
&quot; ciples, which constitute the only basis of that I nion,  
&quot; because a faithful ol ervancc of them can al .ne se­  
&quot; cure its existence r.nd the public happiness.&#x27;&#x27;  
The observation just made equally applicable to,  
this solemn declaration, cf warm attachment to the  
i iron and this solemn pledge to maintain it; nor can any  
question aiise among enlightened friends of the Union,  
as to the duty &gt; f watching over and opposing every in-1  
fraction ?.f lit principles which constitute i s basis,  
and a faithful ob ervancc of which can alone M-eurc its  
existence, and the public happiness there-&#x27;&#x27;!! depending  
The third resolution i.-. i:i the words following:  
&quot; That th s Assembly doth explicitly an I perempto­  
?&#x27; rilv d&gt; claie, that it view &lt; the ]&gt; i*.v? rs of the Federal  
&quot; ( &#x27;? iverniiient, r. r from th- compact, to which  
?&#x27; the Slate;; are pnrtii s, a- 1:;.ii:ctl by the plain spnse &#x27;  
&quot;and intention of the iusiruiiBnt ci n-tittiling that  
&quot; impact . r.s no farther v..!.&quot;. than they are authorised  
&quot; by 1 lie &quot;rants enumerated in that compact; and th t,  
&quot; hi case of a deliberate, palpable and dangerous exer­  
&quot; cise of other powers, not granti .&#x27;I by the said com­  
&quot; pat , th&quot; States who are parties thereto, have the  
&quot; right, mid are &#x27;ii duiv hound, to interpose, for arrest­  
&quot; ir.-r ii:? progress ol&#x27;the evil, and for maintaining  
&quot; with::i tiieir respective limits, the aulhorilictT, rights  
&quot; and liberties appertaining to th&gt; in  
On this resolution, the Committee have bestowed al!  
the attention which its importance merits: They have  
st mm t! it ti ll mep&#x27;lv with a -1r11? t, but villi a severe  
i&quot;. &quot; and they fi el confidence in pronouncing that, in  
it.&gt; just and fair construction, it is unexceptionable true  
in its s veral posit&#x27; .;s, as well ;ij Constitutional an&#x27;i  
conclusive in its inferences.  
The resolution declarejirst, that &quot;it views the  
powers of the Fcdejal Government^ as resulting iron,  
the compact to whic h the Slates arc parties;&quot; in oilier  
words, that the Federal powers are derived from the  
Constitution, and that the Constitution is a compact  
to which the Stales are parties.  
Clear th~ position muFt seem, that the Federal pow-!  
ers are derived from the Cons itutiou, and from that  
alone, the Commit eeare not unnppri?&lt; d &quot;!&#x27; a late due­  
tnno which opens another source of Federal powers, j  
not less extensive and important, than ii is new and un­  
expected. &#x27;1 htf examination &lt;&gt;t this doctrine will be  
most c nvensentlv connected with a review &lt; i a sue­  
cei diii** resolution. I lie committee : itisly tliei.:-&#x27; Ives  
hep&#x27; with briefly remarking, thai in all the cotomporary  
discussions and comnu nts which tiie Constitution un­  
d. rwent, it was constantly justified and recommended,  
o:: the ground, that the powers not j-iven to the tin­  
vcrnment, were withheld from it: and th it, if any doubt  
cot.hi have existed &#x27;his subj. ct, under the original  
text of the Constituti n, it is removed, as far as words  
could remove it, by the ltitli anieinlmcnt, now a part  
of the Constitution, which expressly declares, &quot;that  
the powers not delegated to the I*. S., by the Constitu­  
tion, tmr prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to  
the Slates respectively, or to tiie people.&quot;  
The other position involved in this branch of the re­  
solution, namely, &quot;that the States are parties to the  
Constitution or compact,&quot; is, in the judgment of the ?  
Committee, equally free from objection. It is indeed  
true, that the term &quot;States,&quot;&#x27; is sometimes used in a&#x27;  
vn?ruo sense, an&lt;i sometimes in different senses, ac­  
cording to the subject to which it is applied. Thus, it  
sometimes means the separate sections of territory oc­  
cupied bv the political societies within each, sometimes  
the particular Governments, established by those so- j  
en ties; sometimes those societies as organized into  
those particular Governments; and, lastly, it means the i  
people composing those political societies, in the  
he&#x27;licst sovereign capacity] Although ii might 1?  
wished that the perfection of language admitted  
less diversity in the signification of the same words,  
vet, little inconvetiiency &#x27;? produced by i?, where  
the true sense can be collected with certainty from  
the different applications. In the present instance,  
whatever different constructions of the term &quot;States,&quot;  
in the resolution, may have been entertained, ali  
will at least concur in that last mentioned;?be­  
cause, in that sense, the Constitution was submitted i  
to the &quot;States:&quot; in that sense, the &quot;States&quot; ratified it:  
and, in that sense of the term &quot;States,&quot; they are cotise­  
tpteiillv parties to the compact, from which the powers  
of tiie Federal Government result.  
The next position is, that the General Assembly  
views the powers of Ihe Federal Government, &quot;as 1&quot;  
mile-1 bv the plain sense and intention of the instru­  
I ineiit constituting that compact.&quot; und &quot;as no farther  
i valid than they are authorised by the grants therein j  
enumerated.&quot; It dot-a not seem possible, that any ju.it  
objection can lie against either of these clauses. The&#x27;  
tirst amounts merely to a declaration, that tiie compact  
i ought to have tiie interpretation plainly inu not d by tiie  
1 parlies to it; the otle.r to a declaration, that it ought  
&#x27; to have the execution and effect intended by them. 11  
the powers granted, be v.did, it is sololy because they  
are granted ; and, ii&#x27; the granted powers are valid, be­  
: jau.se granted, nil other powers not granted, must not  
! he v;: lid.  
The resolution, having taken this view of the Fede­  
ral compact, proceeds to infer, &quot;that in case of a del;­  
1 berate, palpable and dangerous exercise of other poiv­  
! ers not granted by the said compact, the States,  
, who are parties thereto, h ivc the right and are in du&#x27;y  
] hound to interpose for arresting the progress of Ihe  
I evil, and for maintaining within their respective limits,  
the authorities, rights and liberties appertaining to  
them.&quot;  
  
Jt appears to your committee in be a plain princi­  
: pie, founded in common s&#x27;-nse, illustrated by common  
practice, and essential to tlx* nature of compacts, that,  
where resort can lie had to no tribunal, superior to the  
, authority of the parties, the parties themselves must be  
the rightful judges in the hst resort, whether the bar­  
gain made has been pursued or violated. The Con­  
! stitution of the I*. S. was formed by the sanction of th?­  
Stales, given by each in its sovereign capacity. It  
&#x27; adds to thf stability and dignity, as well as to the au­  
I tiiority of the Constitution, that it rests on this legi&#x27;i­  
&#x27; mate and solid fuindation. The Slati&#x27;s then, being  
the parties to the cn^titutional compact and in their  
! sovereign enpneitv, it follows of necessity, that there  
&#x27; can be no tribunal above their authority, to decide in  
; the last resort, whether the compact made by them be  
? violated; and, consequently, that, as the parties to it,  
they must themselie* deeide, in the last resort, such  
questions as may be cf sufficient magnitude to require  
I their interposition.  
| It does not follow, however, that beeni:?e the States,  
as sovereign parties to their Constitutional compact,  
must ultimately deeirie whether it has been violated,  
lliat such a decision ought to be interposed, either in a  
hasty manner, or on doubtful and inferior occasions.  
! Kven in the case of ordinary Conventions between dif­  
erent nations, where, by the .strict rule of interpreta­  
? ion, a breach of a part may be deemed a condition ot  
&#x27; every other part, r.nd of the whole, it is always laid  
i down that the breach must be both wilful and materia&#x27;;,  
| to justify an application of the rule. But in the case of  
an intimate and constitutional union, !&#x27;ke that of the  
  
; United Str.tcs, it is evident that the interposition of the  
? oar&#x27;ies, in their sovereign cspJiriiv, can be called tor by  
? occasions only, deeply and essentially aliecting the vital  
principles of their political system.  
The resolution has accordingly guarded against any  
misapprehension of its object, by expressly requiring  
i for such an interposition, &quot;tiie case of a deliberate, jwl­  
pubic and i(tiwjt.rous breach uf the Constitution, by the  
&#x27;?r rcise o(pnwrs not grant by it- It must be a  
c.c~., notol a light and li&#x27;aiisienl nature, but ot a nature  
:i&#x27;jir &#x27;i/i to the great purposes f&#x27;&lt; r which the Consti­  
tution was eslabl shed. It miut to a case, moreover,  
not obscure cr doubtful in its construction, but plain  
&#x27; and palpable. Lar-t.lv, it must be a case not resulting  
,i j.-irtial i?&#x27;?iisiileration, or hasty determination;  
but a case stair.pt with a final consideration and dr.hbr­  
&gt;?1&#x27; adherence. it is uot necessary, because the re­  
?lii&#x27;ion do. s n&lt;&gt;l that the should be  
dismissed, l; .tV far the /rcise .if a:-y particular powrr,  
u: anted !&gt;v tiie Constitution, would justily the inter­  
pc.-:..on of the parties to it. As cases ni ght easily he  
.&lt;1, v. lii.&#x27;li in.no would contend on/hl to fa!! witlitn  
tl.a; des. rip&#x27;.&#x27;io;}. eav s, on the other hand, might, with  
eijual ease, be stated, so tl igrar.l and ho fatal, as to  
uniteevcrv opiiyon in placing tiiem within the descrip­  
tion.  
Hut the res :uili:.i !k.j done more than guard against  
mise.nnatrociion, &gt;?. ? ..proe-iy ? -run . to cases ct a  
ilriibi riitc, pii&#x27;pn&#x27;jlc and dnit/riroas nature. It specific*

to be solelv that .if arresting the progre:-- of the rril of  
usurpation, and of maintaining the authorities, rights  
-.nil li&#x27;-rties appertaining to lite Suites, as parties to

From to&#x27;.s view of the resolution. &gt;t would seem in­

and see -Ilceting the genuine source a*id object of

ed the expediency ot making the declaration at the  
i,n s.-ntdav, imv safely he left to the temperate consi­  
der&quot; hi and caiidtil judgment cf the Xmericaii public.  
It will b.- remembered,&quot;that a frcquen! recurrence to  
fundamental principles, is t- &#x27; mnly enjoined by most  
f the State Constitutions, and particularly by our own,  
ii; a necessary safeguard almost the danger of degene­  
racy to which republics are liable, as well .&#x27;is other tio­  
vernments, though in a less d-gree tlnn others. And  
a fair comparison ot the political doctrines not uuln.­  
ouentat the present day, with those which character­  
ised the epoch of our Revolution, and which form the  
basis of our Republican Constitutions, will best deter­  
mine whether the declarator.- recurrence here made to  
those principles, ought f. be viewed as unseasonable  
and improper, or as a vigilant discharge of an unport­  
;.itt duly. The authority of Constitutions oyer Govern­  
ment&#x27;, and of the sovereignty of the people over Con­  
stitutions, are truths which are at all times necessary to  
be Kept in mind; and at no time perhaps more necessary  
than at the present.

the U. S. in Conjres-i assembled, shall from time to  
time direct and appoint.&quot;  
In the existing Constitution, they m*ke the follow­  
ing part of Sec 6: &quot;The Congress shall have power  
to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises to j  
pav the drills, and provide for the coojjnon defence and :  
general welfare of the United Suites.  
T/iis similarity in the use of these phrases in the two  
great Federal charters, might well be considered, as  
rendering their meaning less liable to be misconstrued  
in the latter; because it will scarcely be said, that in  
the former they were ever understood to be either a ge­  
neral grant of power, or to authorise the requisition or  
application of money by the old Congress to the com­  
mon defence and general welfare, except in the eases af-1  
terwards enumerated, which explained and limited j  
their meaning: and if such was the limited meaning  
attached to these phrases in the very instrument re-j  
vised and remodelled by the present Constitution, it |  
can never be supposed that when copied into this Con- J  
(dilution, a different meaning ought to be attached to j  
them.  
That, notwithstanding the remarkable security  
against misconstruction, a design has been indicated  
to expound these phrases in the Constitution, so as to  
destroy the effect of the particular enumeration of  
powers by which it explains and limits them, must  
have fallen under the observation of those who hare  
attended to the course of public transactions. Not  
to multiply proofs on this subject, it will suffice to re­  
fer to the Debates of the Federal Legislature, in which  
arguments have on different occasions been drawn,  
with apparent effect, lrom these phrases, in their inde­  
finite meaning.  
To these indications might be added, without look­  
ing farther, the official report on manufactures, by the  
late Secretary of the Treasury, made on the 5th ol  
December, I71U; and the report of a Committee of  
Congress, in January, 17!&gt;7, on the promotion of Agri­  
culture. In the first of these it is expressly contended  
to belong &quot;to the discretion of the National Legisla­  
44 turc to pronounce upon the objects which concern  
&quot; the general welfare, and for which, under that de­  
44 scription, an appropriation of money is requisite and  
&quot; proper. And there seems to be no room fur a doubt  
14 that whatever concerns the general interests ol ltar s­  
44 IXC, of AfiKICl I.TfllE, of MAM IACTIISKS, and of COM­  
44 MKRcr, are within the sphere of tii&lt;- National Conn-1  
44 ciln, us far os regards an application oj Monty. ?,  
The latter report assumes the latitude of power i  
in the National Councils, and applies it to the encour­  
apement of agriculture, by means ol&quot; a society to be J  
established at the Seat of Government. Although uei- j  
ther of these reports may have received the sanction  
of a law carrying it into effect; yet, on the other hand,  
the extraordinary doctrine contained in both, has passed  
without the slightest positive mark of disapprobation  
from the authority to which it was addressed.  
Now, whether the phrases in question be construed (  
to authorise every measure relating to the common de­  
fence and general welfare, as contended by some ; or  
every measure only in which there might be an appli­  
cation of money, as suggested by the caution of others;  
the effect must substantially be the same, in destroying  
the import and force of the particular enumeration of  
powers which follow these general phrases in the Con-1  
stitution. For, it is evident, that there is not a single i  
power whatever, which may not have some reference to j  
the common defence, or the general welfare; nor a  
power of any magnitude, which, in its exercise, does  
not involve or admit an application cf mon?y. The  
Government, therefore, which possesses power in either  
one or other of these extents, is a Government without  
the limitations formed by a particular enumeration o!  
powers; and consequently, the meaning and effect of!  
this particular enumeration, is destroyed by the expo-j  
sition given to these general phrases.  
This conclusion will not be affected by any attempt I  
to qualify the power over the &quot;general welfare,&quot; by re-!  
ferringit tocases where the general welfare is bevond  
the reach of srpurute provisions by the individual  
Stales: nnd leaving to these their jurisdictions in j  
cases, to which their separate provisions may be com­  
petent. For, as the authority of the individual States  
must in all cases be incompetent to general regulations &#x27;  
operating through the whole, the authority of the!  
United States would be extended to every object rela-!  
ting to the general welfare, which might, by any pnssi- j  
bility, be provided for by the general authority. This ]  
qualifying construction, therefore, would have&quot; little, il j  
any tendency, to circumscribe the power claimed un-1  
der the latitude of the terms &quot;general welfare.&quot;  
TI.e true and fair construction of this expression,  
both in the original and existing Federal compacts, ap- i  
pears to the committee too obvious to be mistaken. In !  
both, the Congress is authorised to provide money lor  
the common defence and general welfare. in botii, is  
subjoined to this authority, an enumeration of the  
cases, to which their powers shall extend. Money  
cannot be applied to the general welfare, otherwise than  
by an application of it to some particular measure, con­  
ducive to the general welfare. Whenever, therefore,  
money has been raised by the general authority, and is  
to be applied to a particular measure, a question arises,  
whether the particular measure be within the enume­  
rated authorities vesled in Congress. If it lie, the  
money requisite for it, may be applied to it; if it be not,  
no such application can be made. This fair and ob­  
vious interpretation coincides with, and isenforeed by,  
the clause in the Constitution, which declares, that 4,no  
money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in conse­  
quence of appropriations by law.&quot; An appropriation  
of money to the general welfare, would be deemed ra­  
ther a mockery than an observance of this Constitu­  
tional injunction.  
2. Whether the exposition ?&gt;f the general phrases  
here combatted, would not by degr. es, consolidate the  
Stotes into one sovereignty, is a question, concerning  
which the committee can perceive little room for dif­  
ference of opinion. To consul dale the Slates into one  
sovereignty, nothing more can be wanted, than to super­  
sede their respective sovereignties in the eases reserved  
to them, by extending the sovereignty of the U. S. to  
all cases of the &quot;general welfare,&quot; that is to say, to all  
  
easts uhaUrtr.  
3. That the obvious tendency and inevitable result  
of a consolidation of the States into one sovereignty,  
would be to transform the Republican system of the  
United Stnti s into a monarchy, is a point which seems  
to have been sufficiently decided by the general senti­  
ment of America. In almost every instance of dis­  
cussion, relating to the consolidation in question,  
its certain tendency ?o pave the way to monarchy,  
seems not to have been contented. The project of  
such a consolidation, has formed the only topic ?&gt;f con­  
troversy. It would be unnecessary, therefore, for the  
committee to dwell long on the reat&gt;ons which support  
the position of the General Assembly. It may not be  
improper, however, to remark two consequences, evi­  
dently flowing from an extension of the Federal powers  
lo every subject falling within the idea of the &quot;genera!  
welfare.&quot;  
One consequence must be, to enlarge the sphere of  
discretion allotted to the Executive Magistrate. Even  
Within the Legislative limits properly defined by the  
Constitution, the d-fficulty of accommodating legal re­  
gulations to a country so great in extent,and so various  
hi its circumstances, has been much felt; and has led to  
occasional investments of power in the Executive,  
which involve perhaps ns large a portion of discretion,  
as ran be deemed consistent with the nature of the  
Executive trust. In proportion as the objects of Legis­  
lative care might be multiplied, would the time allowed  
for each be diminished, and the difficulty of providing  
uniform and particular regulations tor all, be increased.  
From these sources would necessarily ensue r. greater  
latitude to the agency of that department which is al  
ways in existence, and which could best mould regula­  
tions of a general nature, so as to suit them to the di­  
versity of particular situations. And it is in this lati­  
tude, as a supplement to the deficiency of the laws,  
that the degree of Executive prerogative materially  
consists.  
The other consequence would be, that of an exces­  
sive augmentation of the offices, honors nnd emolu­  
ments depending on the Executive will. Add to the  
present legitimate stock, all those of every description  
which a consolidation of the States would take from  
them, and turn over to the Federal Government, and  
the patronage of the Executive would necessarily be as  
much swelled in this case, as its prerogative would be  
in the other.  
This disproportionate increase of prerogative and pa  
tronage, inu*t, evidently either enable the Chief Ala-1  
gistrate of the Union, by quiet means, to secure his re- J  
election from time to time, and finally, to regulate the  
succession as he might please; or, by giving so tr.ins­  
cendantan importance to the office, would render the  
elections to it so violent and corrupt, that the public  
voice itself might call for an hereditary, in place of an  
elective succession. Whichever of these events might  
follow, the transformation of the Republican system of |  
the United States into a monarchy, anticipated by the j  
General Assembly from a consolidation of the States 1  
into one sovereignty, would be equally accomplished;!  
and whether it would be into n mixed or an absolute j  
monarchy, might depend on too many contingencies to !  
admit of any certain foresight.  
The resolution next in order, is contained in the fol-!  
lowing terms:  
&quot;That the General Assembly doth particularly pre­  
?4 teat against the palpable and alarming infractions o&#x27;j  
&quot; the Constitution, in the two late cases of the &quot;Alien j  
&quot; and Sedition Acts,&quot; passed at the last session of!  
&quot;Congress; the first of which exercises a power!  
&quot; no where delegated to the Federal Government; anil  
&quot; which, by uniting Legislative and Judical powers  
&quot; to those of Executive, subverts the geneial prin­  
&quot; ciples of a free Government, as well as the par­  
&quot; ticular organization and positive provisions of the  
&quot; Federal Constitution; and the other of which acts  
&quot; exercises, in like manner, a power not delegated by  
&quot; the Constitution; but, on the contrary, exprest.ly and  
&quot; positively forbidden by one of the amendments there­  
&quot; to: a power, which, more than any other, ought to  
&quot; produce universal alarm; because it is levelled  
&quot; against that right of freely examining public cha­  
&quot; racters and measures, anil of free communication  
&quot; among the people thereon, which has ever been  
&quot;justly deemed the only effectual guardian of every  
?&#x27; other right.&quot;  
The subject of this resolution having, it is presumed, I  
more particularly led the General Assembly into the  
proceedings which they communicated to the other  
States, and being in itself of peculiar importance, it  
deserves the most critical and faithful investigation;  
  
for the length of which no other apology will bo neces­  
a*The subject divides itself into first, &quot;The Alien Act,  
second!tu &quot;The Sedition Act.&quot; .  
Of the &quot;Alien Act,&quot; it is affirmed by the Re?olutK t,  
1st. That it exercises a power now here delegae ?  
the Federal Government. 2d. Tiict it unites - ? -  
live and Judicial powers to those oi the Lxecutne.  
That this union of power subverts the genera l&gt;n&quot; &#x27;  
pies of free government. -1th. I lint it subverts thi par­  
ticular organization and positive j.rov.Mons ot the K­  
dC|n1?Ir^r lto ciear the way for a correct view of the  
first position, several observations will be rrem.iftd.  
t,, the fir-t place, it is to he borne in mind, that it  
boii.&quot; a characteristic feature of the Federal ConsUtu.  
Sofas it was originally rat.fiod and an a.nendn^nt  
thereto having precisely declared, &quot;That the powers  
notdelegated to the U. S. by the Constuution x.o^ p o­  
hibited bv it to the States are reserved to the bta is  
respectively, or to the people; it is incumbent m &#x27;h&#x27;s,  
as in everv other exercise of power by the Kderal Go­  
vernment.&#x27;to prove from the Constitution, that it grants  
&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;ThTicxt observation to be made, is, that much conKi­  
? .tllncr have been thrown into the question, by  
&#x27;ion ? and aliens, members of friendly nations. 1 /mse  
two eases are so obviously and so essentially distinct,  
that it occasions no little surprise that the distinction  
should have been disregarded: and the surprise is so  
much the ??re?iter, as it&quot; appears that the two cases are  
actually distinguished by two separate ac.a ot Con­  
irresK nassed at the same session, and comprised in  
flie same publication; the one providing for the case  
of &quot;alien enemies;&quot; the other &quot;concerning aliens in­  
discriminately; and consequently ^tend.ng to alu.ns  
of every nation in peace and amity with the United  
State9 * With respect to alien enemies, no doubt has  
been intimated as to the Federal authority over them;  
the Const&#x27;&#x27;.ution having expressly delegated to (on­  
srress the l??wer to declare war against tiny nation, end  
..f course to treat it and all its members ns encmn s.  
With respect to aliens, who are not enemies, hut mem­  
bers of nations in peace and amity with the I States,  
the power assumed by the net of Congress, is denied to  
he Constitutional; anil it is accordingly against this art,  
that the protest of the General Assembly is expressly  
and exclusively directed. I  
A third observation is, that were it admitted, as is  
contended, that the &quot;act concerning Aliens,&quot; has for  
itB object, not a ]&gt;cnnl but a jirerenlice justice; it would  
still remain to be proved that it comes within the Con­  
stitutional power of the Iederal Legislature: and if  
within its power, that the Legislature has exercised it  
&#x27; in a Constitutional manner.  
In the administration of preventive justice, the fol­  
lowing principles have been held sacred; that some pro­  
buble ground of suspicion be exhibited before some Ju­  
dicial authority: that it be supported by oath or affir­  
mation: that ihe party may avoid being thrown into  
confinement, by finding pledges or sureties for his legal  
conduct sufficient in the judgment nf some Judicial au­  
thority; that ho mav have the benefit of a writ of habeas  
corpus, and thus obtain Ins release, if wrongfully con­  
fined; and that he may at any time he discharged from  
his recoun zance, or his confinement, and restored to  
his former liberty and rights, on the order of the proper  
Judicial authority, if it shall fee sufficient cans.-.  
All these principles of the only preventive justice  
known to American jurisprudence, an* violated by the  
Alien act. The ground of suspicion is to be judged of,  
not by any Judicial authority, hut l&gt;y the Executive^  
Magistrate alone: no oath or affirmation is required; if  
the suspicion beheld reasonable by the President, or  
he mav order the suspected Alien to depart the ter­  
ritory of the U. S., without the opportunity ofavoiding  
t he sentence by finding pledges for his future good con­  
duct; as the President may limit the lime of departure  
as he pleases, the benefit of the writ of habeas corpus,  
mav be suspended with respect to the party, although  
the Constitution ordains, that it shall not be suspended,  
unless when the public safety may require it in case of  
rebellion or invasion, neither of which existed at the  
passage of the act: and the party being, under the sen­  
tence&quot;ofthe President,either removed from the U. S.,  
or I cing punished by imprisonment, or disqualification  
ever to become a citizen on conviction of not obeying  
the order of remov?l, he cannot be discharged from the  
proceedings against him, and restored to the benefits  
of his former situation, alllfough the hi^hrst Judicial  
authority should see the most sufficient cause for it.  
Cut, in the last place, it can never he admitted, that  
the removal of aliens, authorised by the act, is to he  
considered, not as punishment for an ottence; but as a  
measure of precaution and prevention. It&#x27; the banish­  
ment of an alien from a country into which he has been  
invited, ns the asylum most auspicious to his happi­  
ness; a country, where he may have formed the most  
tender of connections, where he may have vested his  
I entire property, and acquired property of the real and  
! permanent, as well as the moveable and temporary  
kind ; where he enjovs under the Iaw3, a greater share  
| of the bless:ngs of personal security and personal liber­  
I ty, than he can elsewhere hope for, and where he may  
liave nearly completed his probationary title to citi­  
zenship ; if, moreover, in the execution of the sentence  
against him, he is to be exposed, not only to the ordi­  
nary dangers of the sea, but to tlie peculiar casualties  
incident to a crisis of war, and of unusual licentious­  
I ness on that element, and possibly to vindictive pur­  
&#x27;? poses which Ins emigration itself may have provoked;  
| it&#x27; a banishment of this s-ort lie not a punishment, and  
J among the severest of punishments, it will be difficult  
&#x27; to imagine a doom to which the name can he applied.  
&#x27; And if it he a punishment, it will remain to be enquir­  
! whether it can be constitutionally inflicted, on mere  
suspicion, by the single will of the Executive Magis­  
&#x27;&#x27; trate, on persons convicted of no personal offence  
j against the laws of the land, nor involved in any of­  
1 fence aga nst the law of nations, chargcd on the foreign  
state of which they are members.  
I One argument offered in justification of this power  
j exercised over aliens, is, that the admission of them into  
. the country !-einir ot favor, not of riffbt, the l&#x27;uvor is at  
  
all times revocable.  
To this argument it might be answered, that allowing  
the truth of the inference, it would be n&lt;&gt; proof of what is  
! required. A question would still occur, whether the  
j Constitution had vt sted the discretionary power of ad­  
! mitting Alitin, in the Federal Government or in the  
I State Governments.  
13ut it cannot be a true inference, that because the ad­  
! mission of an Alien is a favor, the favor maybe revoked  
at pleasure. A grant of land to an individual, mty be  
| of favor, not ol&#x27;riixht; but the moment the grant is made,  
the favor becomes a right, and must be forfeited before  
&#x27; it can be taken away. To pardon a malefactor may be  
| a favor, but, the pardon is not, on that account, the less  
l irrevocable. To admit an Alien to naturalization, is as  
much a favor, n&lt; to admit him to reside in the country;  
yet it cannot be pretended, that a person naturalized  
|cnn be deprived of the benefit, anymore than a native  
citizen can be disfranchised.  
Again, it is said, that Aliens not being parties to the  
; Constitution, the rights and privileges which it secures,  
cannot bo at all claimed by them.  
To this reasoning also, it might be answered, that al­  
though Aliens ere not parties to the Constitution, it  
does not follow that the Constitution has vested in  
&#x27; Congress an absolute power over them. The parties to  
&#x27;the Constitution may have granted, or retained, or mo­  
dified the power o\tr Aliens, without regard to that  
: particular consideration.  
Hilt a more direct reply is, that it does not follow, he­  
cause Aliens art- not parties to the Constitution, as citi­  
zens are parties t&lt;? it, that whilst they actually conform  
to it, they have no right to its protection. Aliens are  
not more parlies to the laws, than they are parties to  
the Constitution; yet, it will not be disputed, that us  
they owe on one hand, a temporary obedience, they are  
entitled in return to their protection and advantage.  
If Aliens had no rights under the Constitution, they  
might not only be banished, but even capitally punish­  
ed, without a jury or the other incidents to a fair trial.  
But so far has a contrary principle been carried, in  
every part of the United States, that except on charges  
of treason, an Al^en has, besides all the common privi­  
leges, the special one of being tried by a jury, of which  
one half may be also Aliens.  
it is said, further, that by the laws and practice of  
nations, A liens nvey be removed at discretion, for of­  
fences against the law of nations; that Congress ore  
authorised to define and punish such offences; and that  
to be dangerous to the peace of society is, in Aliens, i  
one of those offences.  
The distinction between Alien enrmies and Alien &#x27;  
friends, is clcarand conclusive answer to this argument.  
Alien enemies are under the law of nations, and liable to  
be punished for offences against it. A1 en friends,except:  
in the single case of public ministers, are under the  
municipal law and must be tried and puuisht-d accord­  
ing to that law only.  
This argument also, hy referring the Alien act, to the  
power of Congress to define and jmnish offences against  
the law of nations, yields the point that the act is of a  
penal, not merely of a preventive operation. It must,  
in truth, be so considered. And if it be a penal act,  
the punishment it inflicts must be justified by some of­  
fence that deserves it.  
Offences for which Aliens, within the jurisdiction of  
a country, are punishable, are first, offences commit­  
ted by {lie nation of which they make a part, and in  
whose offences they are involved: Secondly, offences  
committed by themselves alone, without any charge  
against the nation to which tliej* belong. The first  
is the case of Alien enemies; the second, the case of  
Alien friends. In the fir*t ease, the offending nation  
can no otherwise be punished than by war, one of the  
laws which authorises the expulsion of such of its  
members, as may be found within the country, against  
which the offence has been committed. In the second  
case, the offence being committed by the individual,  
not bv his nation, and against the municipal law, not  
against the law of nations, the individual only, and  
not the nation, is punishable ; and the punishment  
must be conducted according to the municipal law,  
not according to the law of nations. Under this view  
of the subject, the aet of Congress, for the removal of  
Alien enemies, being conformable to the law of na­  
tions, is justified by the Constitution : and the &quot;act,&quot;  
for the removal of Alien friends, being repugnant to  
the Constitutional principles of municipal law, is un­  
justifiable.  
Nor is the act of Congress, for the removal of Alien  
friends, more agreeable to the general practice of na  
tions, than it ia within the purview of the law o^.  
  
nations The general practice of nation., distill  
I _ between Alien friends and Alien enemies.  
The latter it has proceeded against, according t? j  
ilte law of nations, by expelling them as&#x27; &#x27; I  
Tlie former it has considered os under a local and  
pnrarv allegiance, and entitled to a correspondent pro-1  
vetiu&quot;n It&#x27; contrary instances are to be found in ar  
Lrou. countries, under undefined prerogatives, or a.iud  
revolutionary dangers; they will not be deemed :it pre­  
cedents for the government of the I mled States, even,  
if not beyond its Constitutional authority.  
It is siid that Congress may grant letters of marque ,  
and reprisal; that reprisals may be made on persons, as;  
well as property; and that the removal of Aliens ma)  
be considered as the exercise in an interior degree, oi  
the ircneral power of reprisal on persons.  
Without entering minutely into a question that docs  
not seem to require it, it may be remarked, that re­  
nrUal is a seizure of foreign persons or property, with I  
a view to obtain that justice foi injuries done by one  
State ?&gt;r its members, to another Slate or its members;  
for which, a refusal of the aggressor requires such a ,  
rehort to force under the law of nations, ll must be ,  
considered as an abuse of words to call the removal nl;  
persons from a country, a seizure or reprisal on them:&#x27;  
nor is the distinction to be overlooked between reprisals  
on persons within the country and under the faith of its &lt;  
laws, and on persons out of the country. But, laying  
aside these considerations, it is evidently impossible to j  
bring the Alien act within the power of granting repri- ?  
sal-; since it does not allege or imply any injury re-,  
ccived from any particular nation, for which this pro­  
ceeding against its members was intended as a repara­  
tion. The proceeding is authorised against Aliens of \
every nation; of nations charged neither with any sum- (  
lar proceeding against American citizens, nor with:  
any injuries for w-hich justice might be sought, m the  
mode prescribed by the act. Were it true, therefore, j  
that good causes existed for reprisals against one or,  
more foreign nations, and that neither the persons nor.  
property of its members, under the faith of our law*,  
could plead an exemption; the operation of the act  
ou-&#x27;ht to have been limited to the Aliens among us,  
belonging to such nations. To license reprisals against  
all nations, for aggressions charged on oneonly, would  
be a measure as contrary to every principle of justice .  
and public law, as to a wise policy, and the universal,  
; practice of nations. # J  
&#x27; It is said, that the right of removing Aliens isnn in- j  
c:dent to the power of war, vested in Congress t&gt;\ tin*.  
Constitution. , , , j  
This is a former argument in a new shape only: ami,  
is answered bv repeating, that the removal of Alien i  
enemies is an incident to the power of war: that the |  
removal of Alien friends, is not an incident to the pow­  
er of war.  
? It is said, that Congress are by the Constitution to  
| protect each State against invasion; and that tic means j  
of prerenting invasion arc included in tl.e power of  
protection against it.  
The power of war in general, having been .&gt;eJore  
; granted by the Constitution; this clause must either he  
a mere specification for greater caution and crtaint_\,  
of which there are other examples in the instrument; j  
or be the injunction of a duty, superadded t? a grant,  
of the power. Under either explanation, it cainot en- ?  
large the powers of Congress on the subject. The t  
power and the duty to protect each State agaitst an in-1  
vadmg enemy, would be the same under the general  
| power, if this regard to greater caution had been oinit- ?  
! ted.  
i invasion is an operation of war. To protect against.  
! invasion is an exercise ol the power ot war. ^ power,.  
j therefore, not incident to war, cannot be incdent to a j  
: particular modification of war. And as the nmoval of,  
alien friends has appeared to be no incident t? a gene- j  
j ral state of war, it cannot be incident to a partial state,  
I or a particular modification of war.  
] Nor can it ever be granted, that a power t&gt; act on a  
lease, when it actually occurs, includes a pmver over j  
! ail the means that may tcml to prerent the occurrence &#x27;  
of the case. Such a latitude of construct-on would |  
render unavailing, every practicable definition of par-|  
ticular and limited powers. Under the idea of pre-j  
venting war 111 general, as well ns invasion in particu- ?  
lar, not only an indiscriminate removal ol a&#x27;l aliens,  
might be enforced; but a thousand other things still  
| more remote from the operations and precautious ap­  
! purtenant to war, might take place A bigotled or ty-&#x27;  
raniiical nation might threaten us with war, unless,  
certain religious or political regulations were adopted  
by us; yet it never could be inferred, if the regulations  
which would prevent war, were such as Congress had  
otherwise no power to make, that the power to make!  
them would grow out of the purpose they were to an­  
j swer. Congress have power to suppress insurrections,  
| vet it would not be allowed to follow, that they might  
I employ nil the means tending to prevent them; of which  
a system of moral instruction for the ignorant, and of  
i rtrovident support fcr the poor, might be regarded as  
&#x27; among the most efficacious.  
j One argument for the power of the General Covern­  
, inent to remove aliens, would have been passed in si­  
i lence, if it had appeared under any authority inferior to  
: that of a report, made durina the last session of Con­  
! gress, to the (louse of Representatives by a Committee,  
land approved by the House. The doctrine on which  
this argument is founded, is of so new and so cxtraor­  
&#x27; dinary a character, and strikes so radically at the poli*  
1 tical system of America, that it is proper to state it in  
! the very words of the report:  
i &quot;The act [concerning aliens.] Si sn&#x27;&quot;t ?? &#x27;?&lt;&quot; unnmisti­  
i &quot; tutional, because to remove aliens, is a direct breach  
j u of the Constitution, which provides, by the IHIi sec­  
&quot;tion of the 1st article: that the migration or impor­  
&quot; tation of such persons as any one of the States shall  
i&#x27; think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by the  
&quot; Congress, prior to the year 1 -Dd.&quot;  
Among the answers given to this objection to the  
constitutionality of the act, the following very reinark­  
! able one is exiracted :  
&quot;Thirdly, that as the Constitution has giren to the  
41 Mutes, no power to remove aliens, during the period  
? &quot; ot the limitation, under consideration, in the mean­  
  
&quot; time, on the construction assumed, there would be no  
&quot; authority in the country, empowered to send away  
&quot; dangerous aliens, which cannot be admitted.&quot;  
The reasoning here used, would not in any view, be  
conclusive ; because there are powers exercised by  
most oilier Governments, which, in the United States  
are withheld by the people, both from the General  
Government and from the State Governments. Of  
this sort are many of the powers prohibited by the  
declarations of right prefixed to the Constitutions,  
or by the clauses in the Constitutions, in the nature of  
such declarations Nay, so far is the political sys­  
tem of the United Slates distinguishable from that of  
other countries, by the caution with which powers are  
delegated and defined : that in one very important  
case, even of commercial regulation ar.d revenue, the  
power is absolutely locked up against the hands of  
both Governments. A tax on exports can be laid by no  
Constitutional authority whatever. Under a system  
thus peculiarly guarded: there could sure ly he no ab­  
surdity in supposing, that if alien friends, who if guilty  
of treasonable machinations may be punished, or if sus­  
pected on probable grounds, may be be cured by pledges  
i or imprisonment, in like manner with permanent citi­  
! zens, were never meant to he subjected to banishment  
! by any arbitrary and unusual proccss, either under the  
! one Government or the other.  
But, it is not the inconclusiveness of the jrenrrnl rea-1  
! soning in this passage, which chiefly calls the attention  
&#x27;o it. It is the principle assumed by it, that the powers  
held by the States, are given to them by the Constitu- j  
tifin of the U S.; and the inference from this principle,&#x27;  
that the powers supposed to be necessary which are net  
so given to the State Governments, must reside in the i  
Government of the U. S.  
The respect, which is felt for every portion of the  
constituted authorities, forbids some of the reflections  
which this singular paragraph might excite: and they  
are the more readily suppressed, as it may be presumed,  
with justice perhaps, as well as candor, that inadvert­  
ence may have had its share in the error. It would be  
an unjustifiable delicacy, nevertheless, to pass by so  
portentous a claim, proceeding from so hiyh an autho- ;  
ritv, without a monitory notice of the fatal tcndcncies ;  
with which it would be pregnant.  
Lastly, it is said, that a law on the same subject with j  
the Alien Act, passed by this State, originally in !  
and re-enacted in 17!H2, is a proof that a summary remo-1  
val of suspected Aliens, was not heretofore regarded by ,  
the Virginia Legislature, as liable to the objections now  
I urged against such a measure.  
This charge against Virginia vanishes before the sim-&#x27;  
I pie remark, that the law of Virginia relates to &quot;suspi- \
?&#x27; cious persons being the subjects of any foreign power &#x27;  
&quot; or State, who shall have made a declaration of xenr, |  
&quot; or actually commrnccd hostilities, or from whom the j  
&quot; President shall apprehend hostile designs;&quot; whereas;  
the act of Congress relates to Aliens, being the sub- j  
iects of foreign powers and States, who have neither i  
declared vur, nor commenced hostilities, nor from ichom  
hostile designs urc apprehended.  
II. It is next affirmed of the Alien Act, that it unites  
Legislative, Judicial, und Executive powers in the i  
hands of the President.  
However difficult it may be to mark, in every case,!  
with clearness and certainty, the line which divides Le- ;  
gislative power, from the other departments of power;:  
all will agree, that the powers referred to these depirt- j  
ments may be so general and undefined, as to he of a ,  
Legislative, not oi&#x27;an Executive or Judicial nature, and j  
may for that reason he unconstitutional. Details to a ;  
certain degree, are essential to the nature and character I  
of a law; and on criminal subjects, it is proper, that&#x27;  
details should leave as little as possible to the discretion !  
of those who are to apply and to execute the law. Ifj  
nothing more were required, in exercising a Legislative !  
trust, than a general conveyance of authority,&quot;without \
laying down any precise rules, by which the authority  
conveyed, should be carried into effect, it would follow, j  
that the whole power of legislation might be transferred  
by the Legislature from itself, and proclamations might  
become substitutes for laws. A delegation of power in  
this latitude, would not be denied to be a union of the  
different powers.  
To determine, then, whether the appropriate powprs  
of the distinct departments are united by the act author-!  
izing the Executive to remove Aliens, it must be en-j  
quired whether it contains such details, definitions and j  
rules as appertain to the true character of a law bv  
which personal liberty is invaded, property deprived of&#x27;  
its value to the owner, and life itself indirectly exposed I  
to danger.  
The Alien Act declares, &quot;that it shall be lawful fori  
  
the President to order nil such Aliens as lie slinll judge  
diiniicrous to the peace and safely of* the U. S., or shall  
have reasonable ground to suspect, are concerned in any  
reasonable, or sr.crd much!nations, against the govern­  
ment thereof, to depart,&quot; &amp;c  
Could a power be well given inlenns less definite,  
less particular, and less precise? To be dangerous to the  
public softly, to be suspictcd of secret muchinations  
against the government: these can never be mistaken  
for legal rules or certain definitions. They leave every  
tiling to the President. His will is the law.  
But, it is not a Legislative power only that is given  
to the President. He is to stand in the place of the  
Judiciary also. His suspicion is the only evidence  
which is to convict: his order, the only judgment which  
is to be executed.  
Thus, it is the President whose will it is to desig­  
nate the offensive conduct: it is his will that is to as­  
certain individuals on whom it is charged? and it is his  
will thai is to cause the sentence to be executed, l!  
is rightly affirmed, therefore, that the act unites Le­  
gislative and Judicial powers to those of the Execu­  
tive.  
III. It is aflirmed, that this union of power subverts  
the general principles of free Government.  
It has become an axiom in the science of Govern­  
ment, that a separation of the Legislative, Executive,  
and Judicial departments, is necessary to the preserva­  
tion of public liberty. So where has this nxiom been  
better understood in theory, or more carefully pursued  
in practice, than in the United States.  
IV. It is affirmed that such a union of powers sub­  
verts the particular organization and positive provisions  
of the Federal Constitution.  
According to the particular organization of the Con­  
stitution, its Legislative powers are vested in the Con­  
gress, its Executive powers in the President, and its  
Judicial powers in a supreme and inferior tribunals.  
The uuion of any two of these powers, and still more  
of all three, in anyone of these departments, ns has  
been shown to be done by the Alien Act, must conse­  
quently subvert the constitutional organization of them.  
That positive provisions, in the Constitution, securing  
to individuals the benefits of fair trial, are nlso violated  
by the union of powers in the Alien Act, necessarily re­  
sults from the two facts, that the ant relates to Alien  
friends, and that Alien friends being under the munici­  
pal law only, are entitled to its protection.  
The sreund object against which the resolution pro­  
test;!, i* tile Sedition Act.  
Of this act it is aflirmed, 1. That it exercises in like  
manner a power not delegated by the Constitution. &#x27;2.  
That the power on the contrary, is expressly and posi­  
tively forbidden by one of the amendments to the Con­  
stitution. :t. That this is a power, which inor*; than  
any other ought to produce universal alarm, because  
it is levelled against that right of freely examining  
public characters and measures, and of free commu­  
nication thereon, which has ever been justly deemed  
the only effectual guardian of every other right.  
1. That it exercises a power not delegated by the  
Constitution.  
Here again, it will be proper to recollect, that the  
Federal Government being composed of powers spe­  
cifically granted with a reservation of all others to the  
States or to the People, the positive authority under  
which the Sedition Act could be passed must he pro­  
duced by those who assert its constitutionality. In  
what part of the Constitution, then, is this authority  
to be found&#x27;  
Several attempts have been made to answer this  
quest.on, which will he examined in their order.?  
The Committee will begin with one, which has fill­  
ed tlein with equal astonishment and apprehension,!  
and which, they cannot but persuade themselves, must  
have the same elfect on all, who will consider it  
with coolness and impartiality, and with a reverence  
for oi,r Constitution, in the true character in which it  
issued from the sovereign authority of the people. The  
committee refer to the doctrine lately advanced as a  
sanction to the Sedition Act; &quot; that the common or un  
written law,&quot; a law of vast extent and complexity, and  
embrjeing almost every possible subject of legislation,  
both oivil and criminal, makes a part of the law of these  
Statig, in their united and national capacity.  
Ti e novelty, and in the judgment of the committee,  
the rxtravagance of this pretension, would have con­  
signed it to the silence, in which they have passed by  
otlier arguments, which an extraordinary zeal for the  
act lis drawn into the discussion: Hut, the nuspiocs,  
undtr which this innovation presents itself, have con­  
strained the committee to bestow on it an attention,  
whirft other considerations might have forbidden.  
It! executing the task, it may be of use, to look hack  
to tiie colonial state of this country, prior to the He vo­  
lutin: to trace the effect of the revolution which coii­  
ver ed the colonies into independent States; to inquire  
intr the import of the articles of confederation, the first  
instrument by which the union of the States was regu­  
larly established; and finally, to consult the Constitu­  
tion of 1788, which is the oracle that must decide the  
! important question.  
J in the State prior to the Revolution, it is certain that  
! tin common law, under different limitations, made a  
&#x27; part of the colonial codes. Hut, whether it be under­  
stiod that the original colonists brought the law with  
: theri, or made it their law by adoption, it is equally cer­  
tan, that it was the separate law of each colony within  
it? respective limits,and was unknown to them, ns a law  
pervading and operating through the whole, as one so­  
  
: nny.  
]i nouiJ not poooitily bo otherwise. The common  
! Ian- was not the same in any two of the colonies; in  
; s&lt;me, the modifications were materially anil extensively  
&lt;1 fierent. There was no common Legislature, by which  
a common will could be expressed in the form of a law;  
&#x27; n ir any common magistracy, by which such a law could  
: be carried into practice. The will of each colony,  
abne and separately, had its organs for these purposes.  
This stage of our political history, furnishes no foot­  
hrld for the patrons of this new doctrine.  
Did then the principle or operation of the great event  
wiich made the colonies independent States imply or  
in roduce the common law as a law of the Union?  
The fundamental principle of the Revolution was,  
tint the colonies were co-ordinate members with each  
! otier, and with Great Britain; of an empire, united by  
i a common Executive sovereign, but not united by any  
cnttmnn Legislative sovereign. The Legislative power  
was maintained to be as complete in eacli American  
Parliament, as in the British Parliament. And the  
rotal prerogative was in force in each colony, by virtue  
of ts acknowledging the King for its Executive Ma­  
gistrate, as it was in Great Britain, by virtue of a like  
acknowledgment there. A denial of these principles  
by Great Britain, and the assertion of them by Ameri­  
? ca iroduced the revolution.  
There was a time indeed, when an exception to the  
Legislative separation of the several component and co­  
equal part* of the empire, obtained a degree of acqui­  
escence. The British Parliament was allowed to regu­  
lar the trade with foreign nations, and between the  
I different parts of the empire. This was, however,  
me e practice without right, and contrary to the true  
j the?ry of the Constitution. The conveniency of some  
reg tlations, in both those cases, was apparent; and as  
there was no Legislature with power over the whole,  
| nor.iny constitutional pre-eminence among the Legis­  
latures of the several parts, it was natural for the Le­  
| gii!:ture of that particular part which was the eldest  
j and the largest, to assume this function, and for the  
I others to ncquiescc in it. This tacit arrangement was  
the ess criticised, as the regulations established by the  
Brit sli Parliament operated in favor of that part of the  
empre which seemed to benr the principal share of  
the :mblir burdens, and were regarded as an indemni­  
fication of its advances for the other parts. As long  
as this regulating power was confined to the two  
objects of conveniency and equity, it was not com­  
plained of, nor much enquired into. But, no sooner  
was it perverted to the selfish views of the party as­  
suming it, than the injured parties began to feel and  
to reflect; and the moment the claim to a direct and in­  
definite power waa ingrafted on the precedent of the  
regulating power, the whole charm was dissolved, and  
every eye opened to the u?urpation. The assertion by  
G. B. of a power to make laws for the other members of  
the empire in nil rases ichatsocrcr, ended in the disco­  
very that she had a right to make laws for them in no  
cases whatsoever.  
Such being the pround of our revolution, no support  
nor color can be drawn from it, for the doctrine that  
the common law is binding on these States as one so­  
ciety. The doctrine, on the contrary, is evidently re­  
pugnant to the fundamental principle of the revolution.

This articles of confederation, arc the next sotucc of  
iniorniation on this subject. V  
In the interval between the commencement of the  
revolution and t lie final ratification of these article*, t !;?.?  
nature and extent of the Union was determined J^y llie  
circumstances of the crisis, rather than by any ao&amp;uratc  
delineation of the general authority. It will tio&amp;be al­  
leged, that the &#x27;&#x27;common law&quot; could have had afey le. |  
gilimate birth us a law o(&quot; the U. S. during thatipteof  
things. If it came as such into existence at u]J, the  
charter of confederation must have been its pare?.  
Here again, however, its pretensions are absolutely  
destitute of foundation. This instrument do^s not  
contain a sentence or syllable that can be tortursd into  
a countenance of the idea, that the parties to it were,  
with respect to the objects of&quot; the common law, t$ form  
one community. No such law is named or implied, or  
a 11 tided to, or being in force, or as brought into force by  
that compact. No provision is made by which.dnch a  
law could be carried into operation: whilst, on tha&#x27;other  
hand,every such inference or pretext is absolutely pre­  
cluded by article &#x27;J.I, which declares, &quot;that each State  
retains its sovereignty, freedom and independence, and  
every power, jurisdiction and right, which is not by tins  
confederation expressly delegated to the U. S., in Con­  
gress assembled.&quot;  
Thus far it appears, that not a vestige of this extra­  
ordinary doctrine cm he found in the origin or progress  
of American institutions. The evidence against it has,  
on the contrary, grown stronger at every step, till it  
has amounted to a form il and positive exclusion, by  
written articles of compact among the parties con­  
corned.  
Is this exclusion revoked, and the common law in­  
troduced as a national law, by the present Constitution  
of the United States: This is the final question to be  
examined.  
It is readily admitted, that particular parts of the  
common law may have a sanction from the Constitution,  
so far as they are necessarily comprehended in the tech­  
nical phrases which express the powers delegated to  
the government: and s i fur also, as such other parts may  
be adopted by Congress as necessary and proper for  
carrying into execution the powers expressly delegated.  
IJut, the question does not relate to either of these por­  
tions of the common law. It relates to the common law  
beyond these limitations.  
The only part of the Constitution which seems to have  
been relied on in this case, is ihe 2d sect of Art. 111.  
&quot; The judicial power shall extend to all cases, in Inn*  
&quot; and ci/nili/t arising untlcr this Constitution, the Jaws ol  
&quot; the l&quot;. S., and Treaties made or which shall be made  
&quot; under their authority.&quot;  
It has been asked what cases, distinct from those  
arising under the laws and treaties of the U. S., can arise  
under the Constitution, other linn those arising under  
the common law; and it is inferred, that the common  
l i&#x27;.v is accordingly adopted or recognized by the Con­  
stitution.  
Never, perhaps, was so broad a construction applied  
to a text so clearly unsusceptible ot&quot; it. If any c dor  
for the inference could be found, it must lie in the isn- j  
possibility &lt; I* finding any other cases in law and equity,  
within the provision of the Constitution, to satisfy the  
expression; and rather than resort to a construction  
a fleeting so essentially the whole character ol the go­  
vernment, it would perhaps he more rational to con­  
sider the expression as a mere pleonasm or inadver­  
tence. Llut, it is not necessary to decide on such a  
dilemma. The expression is fully satisfied, and its  
accuracy justified, by two descriptions ol cases, to  
which the Judicial authority is extended, and neither of  
which implies that the common law is the law of the I .  
States. One of these descriptions comprehends the  
cases growing out of t In* restrictions on the Legislative  
power of the States. For example, it is provided that  
t;n&lt;j State shall emit lulls of credit,&quot; or &quot;make any  
thing but gold and ?ilvi r coin a tender in payment o! ]  
debts.&quot; Should Ibis prohibition be violated, and a  
:,uit bftimii citiit-iit of tlic statu State be the conse- j  
qucncc, this would be u case arising under the Consti- j  
tution before the Judicial power of the United States !  
A second description cotnprelu mis suits between ciii- (  
Z&quot;iis ami fureigm rs, or citizens ol diflcreut States, to |  
be decided according to the State or foreign laws ; but j  
submitted by the Constitution to the Judicial power ot j  
the United States ; the Judicial power being, inseve­  
ral instances, extended beyotid the Legislative power,  
of the 1. intcd States.  
To this explanation of the text, the following obsor- !  
vations may lie added :  
The expression, &quot;cases in law and equity,&quot; is tnani-1  
festly confined to cases of a civil nature; and would ex- ,  
elude cases of criminal jurisdiction. Criminal cases I  
in law and equity would be a language unknown to the j  
law.  
The succeeding paragraph of the same section is in 1  
harmony with tins construction. It is in these words: I  
&quot;In all eases aflectin^ Ambassadors,other public Minis- .  
ters, and Consuls, and those in which a State shall be a  
party, the Supreme Court shall have original jurisdic-1  
tion&quot; In all the other cases [including cases in law and ;  
equity arising under the Constitution] the Supreme j  
Court shall have appellate jurisdiction both as to law and j  
fact ; with such exceptions, and under such regula- i  
tions, as Congress shall make.  
This paragraph, by expressly giving an oppcl- j  
hitc jurisdiction, in cases ot law and equity iiris- !  
ing under the Constitution, to fact, as well as to j  
law, clearly excludes criminal cases, where the trial by i  
jury is secured ; because the fact, in such cases, is not a .  
kubject of appeal. And, although the appeal is liable to j  
such aerations and regulations as Congress may adopt, j  
yet it is not to bo supposed that an exception of all  
criminal cases could be contemplated; r.s well because  
a discretion in Congress to inal.e or omit the exception &#x27;  
would be improper, as because it would have been un- j  
nccessaryi The exception could as easily have been i  
made bv the Constitution itself, as referred to the Con- j  
  
gross.  
Once more; the amendment last added to the Con­  
stitution, deserves attention, as throwing light on this  
subject. &quot;The Judicial power of the United States  
shall not he construed to extend to any suit in luir or  
fi/iiily, commenced or prosecuted against one of the L&#x27;.  
States, by citizens of another State, or by citizens or  
subjects of any foreign power.&quot; As it will not be pre­  
tended that any criminal proceeding could take place  
against a State; the lerrns lair or ri/ui/ij, must be un­  
derstood as appropriate to ciril, in exclusion of criminal  
cases.  
From these considerations, it is evident, that ibis part  
of the Constitution, even if it could be applied it all,  
to the purpose for which it had been cited, would  
not include any cases whatever of a criminal na­  
ture: and consequently, would not authorize the infer­  
ence from&#x27;it, that tile Judicial authority extends to of­  
fcncr.i against the common law as offences arising un­  
der the Constitution.  
It is further to be considered, that even if this part  
of the Constitution could be strained into an applica­  
tion to every common law case, criminal as well as  
civil, it could have no effect in justifying the Sedition  
Act; which is an exercise of Legislative, and not of  
Judicial power: and it is the Judicial power only of  
which the extent is defined in this part of the Cousti­  
  
union.  
There arc two passages in the Constitution, in which  
a description of I he laws of the 1 . S. is found. The  
first is contained in Art. III. sec. &#x27;J, in the words fol­  
lowing: &quot;This Constitution, the laws of the U. S., and  
treaties made, or which shall he made under their au­  
thority.&quot; The second is contained in the paragraph  
of Art. VI., as follows : &quot;This Constitution and tiie  
laws of the Lr. S , which shall be made in pursuance  
thereof, and all treaties made, or which shall be made,  
under the authority of the TI. S., shall he the supreme  
law of the land.&quot; The first of these descriptions was  
meant as a guide to the Judges of the lr. S.; the se­  
cond, as a guide to the Judges in the several States.  
Both of them consist of an enumeration, which was  
evidently meant to he precise and complete. If the  
common law had been understood to be a law of the  
lr. S., it is not possible to assign a satisfactory reason  
why it was not expressed in the enumeration.  
In aid of these objections, the difficulties and con­  
fusion inseparable from a constructive introduction  
of the common law, would afford powerful reasons  
against it.  
Is itto be the common law with, or without the Bri­  
tish statutes?  
If without the statutory amendments, the vices of  
the code would be insupportable!  
If with these amendments, what period is to he fixed  
for limiting the British authority over our laws?  
Is it to he the date of the eldest or the youngest of  
the Colonies?  
Or are the dates to be thrown together, and a me­  
dium deduced r  
Or is our independence to be taken for the date ?  
Is, ajain, regard to be had to the various changes in  
the common law made by the local codes of America?  
Is regard to be had to such changes, subsequent, as  
well as prior, to the establishment of the Constitution?  
Is regard to he had to future, as well as past changes ?  
Is the law to be different in every State, as differently  
modified by its code ; or are the modifications of any  
  
particular Stale, to be applied to ail .­  
And on the latter supposition, which among the State  
codes would form the standard;  
Questions of this sort might be multiplied with as  
much case, as there would be difficulty in answering  
them.  
! The consequences flowing from the proposed con­  
struction, furnish other objections equally conclusive;  
! unless the text were peremptory in its meaning, and  
consistent with other parts of the instrument.  
These consequences may be iti relation to the Le­  
gislative authority of the 1&quot;. S.; to the Executive au­  
thority ; to the Judicial authority ; and to the Govern­  
ments of the several Slates.  
ll it he understood, that the common law is esta­  
blished by the Constitution, it follows that no part of  
the law can be altered by the Legislature; such of the  
statutes, already passed, as may be repugnant thereto,  
would be nullified; particularly the &quot;Sedition Act&quot;  
itself, which boasts of being a melioration of the com­  
mon law; anil the whole code, with all its incongrui­  
ties, barbarisms, and bloody maxims, would be invio­  
lably saddled on the good people of the U. S.  
Should this consequence Le rejected, and the com­  
mon law beheld, like other laws, liable to revision and  
alteration, by the authority of Congress, it then follows,  
that the bulh rity of Congress is co-extensive with the  
objects of common law; thai is t? say, with every object  
ol Legislation: For, to every such object, does some  
branch or other of the common law extend. The au­  
thority of Congress would, therefore, he no longer un­  
der the limitations, marked out in the Constitution.  
They woulu be authorised to legislate in all cases what­  
soever.  
In the next place, as the President possesses the ex­  
ecutive powers of the Constitution, and is to see that  
the laws be faithfully executed, his authority also must  
be co-extensive with every branch of the common law.  
The additions which this would make to his power,  
though not readily to he estimated, claim the most seri­  
| ous attention.  
This is not all; it will merit the most profound con­  
sideration, how far an indefinite admission of the com­  
mon law, with a latitude in construing it, equal to the  
construction by which it is deduced from the Constitu­  
tion, might draw after it the various prerogatives mak­  
ing part of the unwritten law of Kngland. The En­  
glish Constitution itself is nothing more than a compo­  
sition of unwritten laws and maxims.  
In the third place, whether the common law be ad­  
mitted as of legal or of constitutional obligation, it  
would confer on the Judicial department a discretion  
little short of Legislative power.  
On the supposition of its having a constitutional ob­  
ligation, this power in the Judges would be permanent  
and irremediable by tiie Legislature. On the oilier  
supposition, the power would not expire, until the Le­  
gislature should have introduced a full system of statu­  
tory provisions. Let it be observed, too, that besides  
all the uncertainties above enumerated, and which pre­  
sent an immense field for judicial discretion, it would  
remain with the same department to decide what parts  
of lite common lav.&#x27; would, and what would not, be  
properly applicable to the circumstances of the United  
States&#x27;.  
A discretion of this sort has always been lamented as  
incongruous and dangerous, even in the Colonial and  
State courts; although so much narrowed by positive  
provisions in the local codes on all the principal sub­  
jects embraced by the common law. Umler the C. S.,  
where so few laws exist on those subjects, and where so  
great a lapse of time must happen before the vast chasm  
euuM be supplied, it is manifest that the power of the  
Judges over the law would, in fact, ereel them into Le­  
gislators; and thai for a long time, it would be impossi­  
ble for the citizens to conjecture, either what was, or  
would be law.  
Li the last place, the consequence of admitting the  
common law as the law of&#x27; tile L. States, on the au­  
thor. ty of the individual States, is as obvious as it  
would be fatal. As this law relates to every subject of  
Legislation, and would be paramount to the Constitu­  
tions and laws of the States) the admission ol it would  
overwhelm the residuary sovereignty of the States, and  
by one constructive operation, new-model the whole  
political fabric of the country.  
From the review thus taken of the situation of the  
American colonies prior to their Independence; of the  
eU&#x27;ecl ol&#x27; this event on their situation: of the nature  
and import of the articles of confederation ; i&gt;f the  
true meaning of the passage in the existing Con­  
solution from wiiich the common law has been deduced;  
ol&#x27; the difllculties and uncertainties incident to the  
doctrine and of its vast consequences in extending the  
powers of the Federal Government, and in superceding  
the authorities of the Stale Governments ; the commit­  
tee feel the utmost confidence in concluding, that the  
common law never was, nor by any fair construction,  
ever can be, deemed a law for the American people as  
one community : and they indulge the strongest expec­  
tation that the same conclusion will finally be drawn,  
by all candid and accurate enquirers into the sub­  
ject. It is, indeed, distressing to reflect, that it ever  
should have been made a question, whether the Con­  
stitution, 011 the whole face of which is seen so  
much labor to enumerate and define the several ob­  
jects of Federal power, could intend to introduce  
in tiie lump, in an indirect manner, and by a forced  
construction of a few phrases, the vast and mul­  
tifarious jurisdiction involved in the common law; a law  
filling so many ample volumes; a law overspreading  
the entire field of Legislation; and a law that would  
sap the foundation of the Constitution as a system of  
limited and specified powers. A severer reproach  
could not in the opinion of the committee be thrown oil  
the Constitution, on those who framed, or on those who  
established it, than such a supposition would throw on  
  
them.  
The argument, then, drawn from the common law,on  
lite ground of 11s being adapted or rccogmzed by lh?  
Constitution, being inapplicable to the Sed.tion Art,  
the committee will proceed to examine the other argu­  
ments which have been ii/UndeJ on the Constitution.  
They will waste but lillle time on the attempt to  
cover the acl by tiie preamble to the Constitution, it  
being contrary to every acknowledged rule of con­  
struction, to set up this part of an instrument, in op­  
position to the plain meaning, expressed in the body  
of the instrument. A preamble usually contains the  
general motives or reasons, for the particular regula­  
tion.! or measures which follow it; and is always under­  
stood to be explained and limited by them. In the pre­  
sent instance, a contrary interpretation would havel.hu  
inadmissible client, of rendering nugatory or improper,  
every part of the Constitution which succeeds the pre­  
amble.  
The paragraph in Art. I, sic. which contains the  
power to lay and colli ct taxes, duties, imposts, and ex­  
cises; to pay the debts, and provide for the common de­  
fence and general welfare, having been already ex­  
amined, will also require no particular attention in this  
place. It will have been seen that in its fair and con­  
sistent meaning, it cannot enlarge the enumerated  
powers vested in Congress.  
The part of the Constitution which seems most to bo  
recurred to, in defence of the &quot;Sedition Act,&quot; is the  
l ist clause of the above section, empowering Congress  
I &quot;to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper  
j for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, ami  
j all other powers vested by this Constitution in the Go.  
! vernment of the U. States, or in any department or  
! ollicer thereof.&quot;  
j The plain import of this clause is, that Congress shall  
I have ail the incidental or instrumental powers necessary  
j and pmper for carrying into execution all the express  
I powers; whether they be vested in the Government of  
i the I&#x27;. S., more collectively, or in the several depart­  
ments, or officers thereof. It is not a grant of new  
powers to Congress, but merely a declaration, for the  
j removal of all uncertainty, that the means of carrying  
I into execution, those otherwise grunted, are included  
| in the grant.  
Whenever, therefore, a question arises concerning  
the constitutionality of a particular power, the first  
question is, whether the power be expressed in the  
Constitution. If it be, the question is decided. If  
j it be not expressed, the next enquiry must be, whether  
| it is properly an incident to an express power, and  
I necessary to its execution. II it be, it may be exer­  
cised by Congress. If it be not, Congress cannot  
exercise it.  
Let the question be asked, tiien, whether the power  
over the press exercised in the &quot;Sedition Act, be  
found among (lie powers expressly vested in the Con­  
gress? This is not pretended.  
Is there any express power, forexecuting which, it is  
a necessary and proper power?  
The power which has been selected, as least remote,  
in answer to this question, is that of &quot;suppressing in­  
surrections;&quot; which is said to imply a powc-r to iirr­  
vcut insurrections, by punishing whatever may Uad or  
I tend to them. Hut, it surely cannot, with the least  
plausibility, be said, that a regulation of tiie press, and  
| a punishment of libels, are exercises of a power to sup­  
I press insurrections. The most that could be said, would  
: be, that the punishment of libels, if it had the tendency  
[ ascribed to it, might prevent the occasion of passing or  
executing laws necessary and proper fur the suppression  
of insurrections.  
Has the Federal Government no power, then, to pre­  
I vent as well as to punish resistance to the laws.­

} have the power, which Ihe Constitution d vein­  
ed most proper, iu their hands fur the purpose- -I he  
C &gt;ngr.&#x27;s? has power, before it happens, &#x27;?? puss l?w.­  
fo puniching it: and the Executive and Judiciary  
ha/e power to enforce those laws when it does hap  
j en.  
It must be recollected by many, and could be shewn  
to the satisfaction of all, that the construction here put  
on the trrfius &quot;necessary and proper,&quot; is precisely the  
construction which prevailed during tin* discussions  
and ratifications ofthe Constitution. It miv be added,  
and cannot too often be repeated, that it is u construc­  
tion absolutely necessary to maintain their consistency  
with the peculiar character of the government, ns {as­  
sessed of particular and defined powers only; not ofthe  
general and indefinite powers vested in ordinary go­  
vernments. For, if the power to suppress insurrections,  
includes a power to punish libels; or if the power to  
punish, includes a power to preeent, by all the means  
that inoy have that tendency, such is tiie relation and  
influence among the most reinole subjects of legisla­  
tion, that a power over a very few, would carry with  
it a power over all. And it must be wholly immaterial,  
whether unlimited powers be exercised under the name  
of unlimited powers, or be exercised under the name  
of unlimited means of carrying into execution limited  
powers.  
Th is branch of the subject will be closed with a re- ,  
flection which must have weight witli all ; but more  
especially with those who place peculiar reliance on  
the judicial exposition of the Constitution, as the bul­  
walk provided against undue extensions of the Legis­  
lative pawer. Jfitbe understood that the powers im­  
plied iu the specified powers, have an immediate and  
.ippropriate relation to them, as means, necessary and  
proper for carrying them into execution, questions  
on the constitutionality of laws passed for this pur­  
posp, will be of a nature sufficiently precise and de­  
terminate for Judicial cognizance and eontroul !?  
If, on the other hand, Congress are not limited in  
Ihe choice of means by any such appropriate relation  
of them to the specified powers ; but may employ all  
such means as they may deein fitted to prevent, as well  
us to punish, crimes subjected to their authority; such  
as may have a tendency only to promote an object for  
which they are authorised to provide; every one must  
perceive, that questions relating to means of this sort  
must be questions of mere policy and expediency; on  
which, legislative discretion nlone can decide, and from  
which the judicial interposition and control are com­  
pletely excluded.  
2. The next point which the resolution requires to be  
proved, is, that the power over the press exercised by  
the Sedition Act, is positively forbidden by one of the  
amendments to the Constitution.  
The amendment stands in these words?&quot;Congress  
shall make 110 law respecting an establishment of re-i  
ligion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or ubridg-!  
ing the freedom of speech or of the press; or the right of 1  
ihe people peaceably to assemble, und to petition the  
Government for a redress of grievances.&quot;  
In the attempts to vindicate the &quot;Sedition Act,&quot; it  
has been contended, I. That the &quot;freedom of the press&quot;  
is to be determined by the meaning of these terms in  
the common law. 2 That the article supposes the  
power over the press to be in Congress, and prohibits  
them only from abridging the freedom allowed to it by |  
the common law.  
Although it will be shewn, in examining the second  
of these positions, that the amendment is a denial to  
Congress of all power over the press, it may not be  
useless to make the follow ing observations on the first  
of them.  
It is deemed to be a sound opinion, that the Sedition  
Act, in it&lt; definition of some of the crimes created, is  
an abridgment of the freedom of publication, recog­  
nized by principles of the common law in England.  
The freedom of the press under the common law,  
is, in the defences of the Sedition Act, made to con­  
sist in an exemption from all previous restraint on print­  
ed publications, by persons authorised to inspect and  
prohibit thein. It appears to the Committee, that this  
idea of the freedom of the press, can never be admit­  
ted to be the American idea of it: since a law inflict­  
ing penalties on printed publications, would have a si­  
inilnreffect with a law authorisinga previous restraint {  
on ihem. It would seem a mockery to say, that no 1  
law should be passed, preventing publications fro in be- j  
ing made, but that laws might be passed for punishing  
them in case they should be made.  
  
The essential difference between the British l.overn-.  
merit and the American Constitutions, will place this |  
subject in the clearest light. !  
In the British Government, the danger of encroach­  
ments on the right* of the People, is understood to be  
confined to the Executive Magistrate. 1 he rcpresen- |  
tatives of the People in the Legislature, are not only .  
exempt themselves, from d.stmst, but are considered as  
sufficient guardians of the rights of their constituents ,  
against the danger from the Executive. Hence it is a  
principle, that the Parliament is unlimited in its power,  
or, in their own language, is omnipotent. Hence too,  
all the ramparts for &quot;protecting the rights of the People,  
each as their Magna Clurta, their Bill of Rights, A.C.,  
are not reared against the Parliament, but against the  
royal prerogative. They are merely Legislative pre­  
cautions, against Executive usurpations I ndersuch  
a Government as this, an exemption of the  
previous restraint l?v licensers appointed by the km^,  
,s all the freedom liiat can be secured to it  
In the U.S., the case is altogether different. Hip  
people not the Government, poss.ss the absolute sove­  
reignty. The I legislature, no less than the Executive,,  
is under limitations of power. Encroachments are re­  
garded as possible from the one, as well as from the other.  
Hence in the U. S., the great and essential rights o. J  
the people are secured, against Legislative as well as ,  
against Executive ambition. They ore secured not b)  
laws paramount to prerogative, but by Constitutions  
paramount to laws. This security of the freedom of  
the press requires, that it should be exempt, not only  
from previous restraint by the Executive, as in Great  
Britain; but from Legislative restraint also; and tins  
exemption, to be effectual, must be an exemption, not  
only from the previous inspection of licensers but,  
from the subsequent penalty of the laws.  
The state of the presss, therefore, under the com­  
mon law, cannot in this point of view, be the standard  
of its freedom in the U. S. .... v.  
But there is another view, under which it may tie ne­  
cessary to consider this subject. It may be alleged,  
that although the security fur the freedom of the press,  
be diftVrent&quot;in Great Britain and in this country; being  
u legal security only in the former, and a constitutional  
security in the latter: and although there may be a further  
difference, in an extension of the freedom ot the press  
here, beyond an exemption from previous restraint, to ^  
at; exemption from subsequent penalties also; yet that  
the actual legal freedom of the press, under the com­  
mon law, must determine the degree of freedom, which  
.s meant by the terms, and which is constitutionally  
vecurcd against both previous and subsequent re­  
The Committee arc not unaware of the difficulty of  
all general questions, which may torn on the proper  
boundary between the liberty and licentiousness of the  
press. They will leave it therefore for consideration  
only, how far the difference between the nature of the  
British Government, and the nature of the American  
Governments, and the practice tinder the latter, may  
hIicw the degree of rigor in the former, to be inapplica­  
ble to, and not obligatory in the latter.  
The nature of Governments elective, limited am)  
responsible, in all their branches, may well be supposed  
to require a greater freedom of animadversion, than  
might be tolerutfd by the genius of such a Government  
a* that of Great Britain. In the latter, it is a maxim,  
ihat the King, an hereditary, not a responsible magis­  
trate, can do no wrong; and that the Legislature, which  
in two-thirds of its composition, is also hereditary, not ^  
responsible, can do what it pleases. In the U. S., the j  
Executive magistrates are not held to b? infallible, nor i  
the Legislatures to be omnipotent; and both being elec­  
tive, are both responsible. Is it not natural and  
sarv, under such different circumstances, that a diHer­  
ent degree offrecdom, in the use of the press, should be  
contemplated? , ,  
Is not such an inference favored by what is observa­  
ble in Great Britain itself? Notwithstanding the gene­  
ral doctrine of the common law, on the subject of the  
press, and the occasional punishment of those, who use  
it with a freedom offensive to the Government; it is well  
known, that with respect to the responsible members ol  
the Government, where the reasons operating here,  
become applicable there, the freedom exercised &gt;&gt;  
the press, and protected by the public opinion, jar  
exceeds the limits prescribed by the ordinary rules  
oif law. The ministry, who are responsible to im­  
peachment, arc at all times, animadverted on, by  
the press, with peculiar freedom: and during the  
elections for the House of Commons, the other respon­  
sible part of the Government, the press is employed  
with as little reserve towards the candidates.  
The practice in America must be entitled to much  
more respect. In every State, probably in the Union,  
the press has exerted a freedom in canvassing the me .  
rits and measures of public men, of every description,  
which has not been confined to the strict limits ot the  
common law. On this fooling, the freedom of the press ,  
has stood; on this footing it yet stands. And it w. I  
?ot be a breach, either of truth or of candor, to &gt;a&gt;,.  
that no persons or presses are in the habit of more un- (  
restrained animadversions on the proceedings and turn­  
nonaries of the State Governments, than the persons |  
und presses most zealous in vindicating the act ot t on­  
yress for punishing similar animadversions on the Oo- j  
vcrnment of the United States.  
The last remark will not be understood, as claiming  
for the State Governments, an immunity greater than  
they have heretofore enjoyed. Some degree of abuse is  
inseparable from the proper use of every thing; and in no  
instance is this more true, than in that of the Prc*s  
It has accordingly been derided by the practice of the  
States, that it is better to leave a few of its noxious  
branches, to their luxuriant growth, than by pruning  
them away, to injure the vigor of those yieU.ng the  
urooer fruits. And can the wisdom of this polu} be  
doubted by any who reflect, that to the press a one che­  
quered as it is with abuses, the world is indebted for  
all the triumphs which h.re been gamed by  
humanity, nrer error .nd &quot;l^^&#x27;d St.&quot;i o &quot;  
to the same beneficent source, the Lnited M^es o\.e  
much of the lights which conducted them to the rank  
, f tfree and independent nation; and which have im­  
proved their political system, into a shape so ausp.c.ous  
to their happiness. Had &quot;Sedition Acts,&#x27; forbidding j  
  
I every publication that might bring the constituted  
lugents inlo contempt or disrepute, or that might excite  
the hatred of the people against the authors ol ur.juM  
i or pernicious measures, been ut.ilurmly enforced Jiijamst  
the press, might not the I&#x27; S. have been languishing at  
this d iv, tinder the infirmities of a sickly confederation.  
Might iliey not possibly be miserable colonies, groaning  
under a foreign yoke?  
To those observation*, one tact will be added, winch  
demonstrates that the common law cannot be admitted  
Us the universal expositor of American terms, which  
inav be the same with those contained in that law.?­  
The freedom of conscience, and ui religion, are found  
in the same instruments, which assert the freedom oi  
the press. It will never be admitted, that the meaning  
of tin- former, in the common law of England, is to li­  
mit their meaning in the Uv S.  
Whatever weight inav be allowed to these considera­  
tions, the rominTttee d.&quot;&gt; not, however, by any means  
intend to rest the question on them. They contend  
that the article of amendment, instead of supposing in  
Congress a power that might be exercised over tl.e  
ores* provided its freedom was not abridged, wuj  
meant as a positive denial to Congress, of any power  
whatever on the subject.  
To demonstrate that this was the true object of the  
article it will be sufficient to recall the circumstances  
which&#x27;led to it, and to refer to the explanation accom­  
panying the article.  
When the Constitution was under the discussions  
which preceded it* ratification, it is well known, that  
&lt;rreat apprehensions were expressed by many, lest the  
omission of some positive exception from the powers  
delegated, of certain rights, and of the freedom of  
the press particularly, might expose then, to the dan­  
ger of being drawn by construction within some ot  
The powers vested in Congress; more especially ol  
the power to make nil laws necessary and proper  
for carrying their other powers into execution. In  
reply to this objection, it was invariably urged to be a  
fundamental and characteristic principle of the Consti­  
tution, that all powers not given by it were reserved ;  
that no powers were given beyond those enumerated  
in the Constitution, and such as were fairly incident  
to them; that the power over the rights in question, and  
particularly over the press, was neither among the enu­  
merated powers, nor incident to any of them; and con­  
sequently that an exercise of any such power, would  
l&gt;e a manifest usurpation. It is painful to remark,  
how much the arguments now employed in behalf ol  
the Sedition Act, are at variance with the reasoning  
which then justified the Constitution, and invited its  
ratification. .  
From this posture of the subject, resulted the inter­  
esting question in so many of the Conventions, whe­  
ther the doubts and dangers ascribed to the Constitu­  
tion, should be removed by any amendments previous  
to tlie ratification, or be postponed, in confidence that  
as far as they might be proper, they would be introduced  
in the form provided by the Constitution. 1 he latter  
course was adopted; and in most of the Stales, the rati­  
fications were followed by propositions and instructions  
for rendering the Constitution more explicit, and more  
safe to the rights, not meant to be delegated by it.  
Among those Tights, the freedom of the press, in most  
instances, is particularly and emphatically mentioned.  
The firm and very pointed manner, in which it is as­  
serted in the proceedings of the Convention ot this  
State, will be hereafter seen.  
In pursuance of the wishes thus expressed, the  
first Congress that assembled tinder the Constitution,  
proposed certain amendments, which have since, by the  
necessary ratifications, been made a part of it; among  
which amendments, is the articic containing, arnon^  
other prohibitions on the Congress, an express declara-1  
tion that they should make no law abridging the free­  
dom of the press.  
Without tracing farther the evidence on tins subject, &lt;  
it would seetn scarcely possible to doubt, that no power .  
whatever over the press, was supposed to be delegated !  
by the Constitution, as it originally stood; and that the ^  
amendment was intended as a positive and absolute re-1  
servation of it.  
Hut the evidence is still stronger. The proposition !  
of amendments made by Congress, is introduced in the j  
following terms: &quot;The Conrcnilons oj it number oj tin j  
St alts having at the time of thrir adopting the Con.&quot;It-1  
tution, expressed a desire, in urrir.r to prevent miscon- j  
St ructions or abuse of its powers, thatfurther declaratoryj  
and restrictive clauses should he added: mid as extending j  
the ground of public confidence in the Gori rnnient, will j  
best ensure the beneficent ends of its institutions.&#x27;&#x27;  
Here is the most satisfactory and authentic proof,  
that the several amendments proposed, were to be con- j  
sidered as either declaratory or restrictive; and whether  
the one or the other, as corresponding with the desire  
expressed by a number of the States, and as extending  
the ground of public confidence in the Government.  
Under any other construction of the amendment re­  
lating to the press, than that it declared the press to be  
wholly exempt from the power of Congress, the amend­  
ment could neither be said to correspond with the de­  
sire expressed by a number of the States, nor he calcu­  
lated to extend the ground of public confidencc in tiie  
Government.  
Nay, more; the construction employed to justify the  
&#x27;?Sedition Act,&quot; would exhibit a phenomenon, without  
a parallel in the political world. It would exhibit a  
number of respectable States, as denying first that any &#x27;  
powr over the press was delegated by the Constitution;  
as proposing next, that an amendment to it, should ex-,  
plicitly declare that tio such power was delegated; and  
finally, as concurring in an amendment actually recog- j  
nizing or delegating such a power.  
Is then the Federal Government, it will be asked, j  
destitute ofevery authority for restraining the licentious- j  
ness of the press, and for shielding itself against ? he li­  
bellous attacks which may be made on those who ad­  
minister it?  
The Constitution alone mn answer this question. If  
no such power be expressly delegated, and it be not  
both necessary and proper to carry into execution an  
express power; above all, il it br expressly forbidden by  
a declaratory amendment to the Constitution, the an­  
swer must be, that the Federal Government is destitute  
of all such authority.  
And might it not be asked in turn, whether it is not  
more probable, under all the circumstances which have  
been reviewed, that the authority should be withheld  
by the Constitution, than that it should be left to a  
vague and violent construction; whilst so much pains  
were bestowed in enumerating other powers, and so  
many less important powers arc included in the enu­  
  
?Deration?  
Might it not be likewise asked, whether the anxious  
circumspection which dictated so many peculiar limi­  
tations on the general authority, would he unlikely to  
exempt the press altogether from that authority&#x27; The  
peculiar magnitude of roinc r.f the powers iiecessnrily  
committed to the Federal Government; the peculiar  
duration required for the functions of some of its de­  
partments; the peculiar distance of the seat of its pro­  
ceedings from tin* great body of its constituents; and  
the peculiar dillicully of circulating an adequate  
knowledge of them through any other channel; will not  
these considerations, some or other of which produced  
other exceptions from the powers of ordinary Govern­  
ments, all together, account for the policy of binding  
the hand of the Federal Government, from touching the  
channel which alone can give efficacy to its respond­  
bility to its constituents; and of leaving those who ad­  
minister it, to a remedy for their injured reputations,  
under the same laws, and in the same tribunals, which  
protect their lives, their liberties, and their properties?  
But the question does not turn either on the wisdom  
of the Constitution, or on the policy which gave rise to  
its particular organization. It turns on the actual  
meaning of the instrument; by which it has appeared,  
that a jiower over the press is clearly excluded; from  
the number of powers delegated to the Federal Go­  
vernment.  
&#x27;A. And in the opinion of the Committee, well may it  
lie said, as the resolution concludes with saying, that  
the unconstitutional power exercised over the press by  
the &quot;Sedition Act,&quot; ought &quot;more than any other, to  
&quot; produce universal alarm: because it is levelled against  
&quot; that right of freely examining public characters and  
&quot; measures, and of free communication among the pen­  
&quot; pie thereon, which has ever been justly deemed the  
&quot; only effectual guardian of every other right.&quot;  
Without scrutinizing minutely into all the provisions  
of the &quot;Sedition Act,&quot; it will be sufficient to cite so  
much of section 2, as follows: &quot;And be it further enact­  
&quot; ed, that if any person shall write, print, utter or pub­  
&quot; lisli, or shall cause or procure to be written, printed,  
&quot; uttered or published, or shall knowingly and willing.  
&quot; assist or aid in writing, printing, uttering or publish­  
&quot; ing any false scandalous and malicious writing or  
&quot; writings against the Government of the U. S., or ei­  
&quot; llier House of the Congress of the U. Slates, or the  
&quot; I&#x27;resident of the United States, with mi intent to dc­  
&quot;fume the said Gvrernment, or cither House of the  
&quot; an id Congress, or the President, or to bring them, or  
u either of them, into contempt or disrepute; or to ex­  
&quot; cite against them, or either, or any of them, the hit­  
&quot; trcd of the good people of the L&#x27;nited Stairs, \c.  
&quot; Then such person being thereof convicted Itforc ami  
&quot; Court of the I&#x27;nited States, hacing jurisdiction thereof  
&quot; shall be punished by a Jine nut exceeding tico thousand  
&quot; dollars, and bij imprisonment not exceeding ttco i/ears.&quot;  
On this part of the act, the following observations  
present themselves :  
1. The Constitution supposes that the I&#x27;resident, the  
Congress, and each of its Houses, may not discharge  
their trusts, either from defect offjudgment, or other  
causes. Hence, they are all made responsible to their  
constituents, at the returning periods of election; and  
the 1&#x27;rvsiJent, who is singly entrusted with very great  
powers, is, as a further guard, subjected to an inter­  
mediate impeachment.  
2. Should it happen, as the Constitution supposes it  
may happen, that either of these branches of the Go­  
vernment may not have duly discharged its trust; it is  
natural and proper, that according to the cause and de­  
gree of their faults, they should be brought into con­  
tempt or disrepute, and incur the haired of the people.  
3. Whether it has, in any case, happened that the  
proceedings of cither or all of those branches, evinces  
such a violation of duty as to justify a contempt, a dis­  
repute or hatred among the people, can only be deter­  
mined by a free examination thereof, and a free com­  
munication among the people thereon.  
4- Whenever it may have actually happened, that  
proceedings of this sort are chargeable on all or either  
of the branches of the Government, it is the duty as  
well as the right of intelligent and faithful citizens, to  
discuss and proinulge them freely, as well to control  
  
them by the censorship of the public opinion, as to pro­  
mote a remedy according to the rules of the Constitu­  
tion. Ami it cannot be avoided, that those who are  
to apply the remedy must feel, in some degree, a con­  
U nipt or hatred against the transgressing party.  
3 As the art was passed on July 14, ITU*, and is to  
lie in force until March 1SW, it was of course, !hat  
during its continuance, two elections of the entire  
House of Representatives, an election of a part of the  
Senate, and an election of a President were to take  
place.  
G. Tint consequently during all these elections, in­  
tended by the Constitution to preserve the purity, or  
to pur re the faults of the administration, the great re­  
medial rights of the people were to be exercised, and  
the responsibility of their public agents to be screened,  
under the penalties of this act.  
May it not be asked of every intelligent friend to  
the liberties of his country, whether the power exer­  
cised in such an act as this, ought not to produce great  
and universal alarm? Whether a rigid execution of  
such an act, in time past, would not have repressed  
that information and communication among the people,  
which is indispensable to the just exercise of their  
electoral rights? And whether such an act, if made  
perpetual, and enforced with rigor, would not in lime  
to come, either destroy our free system of Government,  
or prepare a convulsion that might prove equally fatal  
to it ?  
In answer to such questions, it has been pleaded that  
the writings and publications forbidden by the act, are  
those only which are false and malicious, and intended  
to defame; and merit is claimed for the privilege al­  
io.\ed to authors to justify, by proving the truth of  
their publications, and for the limitations to which the  
sentence of fine and imprisonment is subjected.  
To those who concurred in the act, under the extra­  
ordinary belief, that the option lav between the passing  
of such an act, und leaving in force the common law  
of libels, which punishes truth equally with falsehood;  
and submits the fine and imprisonment to the indefi­  
nite discretion of the court, the merit of good intentions  
ought surely not to be refused. A like merit may  
perhaps be due for the discontinuance of the corporal  
punishment, which the common law also leaves to the  
discretion of the court. This merit of intention, how­  
ever, would have been greater, if the several mitiga­  
tions had not been limited to ko short a period; and the  
apparent inconsistency would have been avoided, be­  
tween justifying the act at one time, by contrasting it  
with the rigors of the common law, otherwise in force;  
and at another time by appealing to the nature of the  
crisis, as requiring the temporary rigor exerted by the  
act.  
But, whatever may have been the meritorious inten­  
tions of all or any who contributed to the Sedition Act,  
a very few reflections will prove, that its baneful ten­  
dency is little diminished by the privilege of giving in  
evidence the truth of the matter contained ir. political  
writings.  
In the first place, where simple and naked facts alone  
are in question, there is sufficient difficulty in some  
eat.es, sufficient trouble and vexation in all, of meeting  
a prosecution from the government, with the full and  
formal proof, necessary in a Court of law.  
Hut, in the next place, it must be obvious to the  
plainest minds, that opinions, and inferences, and con­  
iecte.ral observations, are not only in many cases inse­  
parable from the fuels, but may often be more the ob- j  
jectsof the prosecution than the facts themselves; or j  
may even be altogether abstracted from particular ficts; i  
and that opinions and inferences, and conjectural oh-1  
servations, cannot be subjects of that kind of proof |  
which appertains to facts before a Court of Law.  
Again: It is no less obvious, that the intent to defame J  
or brin-j into contempt or d srepnte, or hatred, which  
is made a condition of the offi-nce created by the act, j  
cannot prevent its pernicious influence, on the free-1  
doin of the press. For, omitting the enquiry, how far  
the malice of the intent is an inference of the law from j  
the mere publication; it is manifestly impossible to i  
punish the intent to bring those who administer the  
government into disrepute or contempt, without strik­  
ing at the right of freely discussing public characters  
and measures: because those who engage in such dis­  
cussions, must expect and intend to excite these unfa- j  
vorable sentiments, so far as they may be thought to be  
deserved. To prohibit, therefore, the intent to excite  
those unfavorable sentiments against those who admin-1  
ister the government, is equivalent to a prohibition  
of the actual excitement of them; and to prohibit the  
actual excitement of them, is equivalent to a prohibi­  
tion of discussions having that tendency and effect; j  
which, again, is equivalent ton protection of those who  
administer the Government, if they should at anytime  
deserve the contempt or hatred of the people, an-ainst  
being exposed to it, by free animadversions on their  
characters and conduct. Nor can there be a doubt, if  
those in public trust be shielded by penal laws from  
such strictures of the press, as may expose litem to  
contempt ??r disrepute, or hatred, where they may de-1  
serve it, that in exact proportion as they may deserve  
to be exposed, will be the certainty and criminality of  
the intent to expose them and the vigilance of prose­  
cuting and punishing it; nor a doubt, that a Govern­  
ment thus intrenched in penal statutes, against the just  
and natural effects of a culpable administration, will  
easily evade the responsibility, which is essential to a  
faithful discharge of its duty.  
  
Let it be recollected, lastly, that the right of electing  
the members of the government, constitutes more par­  
ticularly the essence of a free and responsible govern­  
ment. The value and efficacy of this right, depends  
on the knowledge of the comparative merits and deme­  
rits of &#x27;lie candidates for public trust; and on the equal  
freedom, consequently, of examining and discussing  
these merits arid demerits of the candidates respective­  
ly. It has been seen, that a number of important elec­  
tions will take place whilst the act is in force; although  
it should not be continued beyond the term to which it  
is limited. Should there happen, then, as is extremely  
probable in relation to some or other of these branch |  
of the government, to the competitions between those |  
who are, and those who are not, members of the  
government, what will be the situations of the com­  
petitors? Not equal; because the characters of the  
former will be covered by the &quot;Sedition Act&quot; from ani­  
madversions exposing them to disrepute among the  
people; whilst the latter may be exposed to the con­  
tempt of the . people, without a violation of the act.  
What will be the situation of the people? Not free;  
because they will be compelled to make their election  
between competitors whose pretensions they arc not  
permitted by the act, equally to examine, to discuss,  
and to ascertain. And from both these situations, will  
not those in power derive an undue advantage for con­  
tinuing themselves in it; which by impairing the right  
of election, endangers the blessings of the government!  
founded on it?  
It is with justice, therefore, that the General Assem­  
bly have affirmed in the resolution, as well that the j  
right of freely examining public characters and mea­  
sures, and of free communication thereon, is the only  
effectual guardian of every other right, as that this  
particular ritrht is levelled at, by the power exercised  
in the &quot;Sedition Act.&quot;  
The resolution next in order is as follows:

now shown to the  
most palpable violation of one of the rights tliusde­  
M clared and secured; and to the establishment of a  
&quot; precedent, which inav be fatal to the other.&quot;  
To place this resolution in its just light, it will be ne­  
cessary to recur to the acts of ratification by Virginia,  
which stands in the ensuing form :  
&quot; We, the delegates of the people of Virginia duly  
&quot; elected in pursuance of a recommendation from the  
41 General Assembly, and now met in Convention, hav­  
&quot; ing fully and freely investigated and discussed the  
&quot; proceedings of the Federal Convention, and being  
&quot; prepared as well as the most mature deliberation hath  
&quot; enabled us, to decide thereon; DO, in the name  
&quot; and in behalf of the people of Virginia, declare and  
&quot; make known, that the powers granted under the Con­  
&quot; stitution, being derived from the people of the  
&quot; United States, may be resumed by thein, whensoever  
&quot; the same shall be perverted to their injury or oppres­  
&quot; sion ; and that every power not granted thereby, re­  
&quot; mains with them, and at their will. That therefore,  
&quot; no right of any denomination can be cancelled,  
&quot; abridged, restrained or modified, by the Congress,  
&quot; by the Senate or House of Representatives acting in  
&quot; anv capacity, by the President, or any department or  
&quot; officer of the United States, except in those instances  
&quot; in which power is given by the Constitution for those  
&quot; purposes: and, that among other essential rights,the  
&quot; liberty of conscience and of the press, cannot be  
&quot; cancelled, abridged, restrained or modified by any  
&quot; authority of the United Slates.&quot;  
Here is an express and solemn declaration by the  
Convention of the State, that they ratified the Consti­  
tution in the sense, that no right of any denomination  
can be cancelled, abridged, restrained or modified by  
the government of the I*. S. or any part of it; except in  
tho?e instances in which power is given by the Consti­  
tution; and in the sense particularly, &quot;that among other  
essential rights, the liberty of conscience and freedom  
of the press cannot be cancelled, abridged, restrained  
or modified, by any authority of the U. S.&quot;  
Words&#x27;could not well express, in a fuller or more  
forcible manner, the understanding of the Convention,  
that the liberty of conscience and the freedom of the  
press, were equally and completely exempted from all  
authority whatever of the U. S.  
Under an anxiety to guard more efTectuallv these  
rights against every possible danger, the Convention,  
after ratifying the Constitution, proceeded to prefix to  
certain amendments proposed by thein, a declaration of  
rights, in which are nvo articles providing, the one for  
the liberty of conscience, the other for the freedom of  
speech and of the press.  
Similar recommendations having proceeded from a  
number of other States; and Congress, as has been seen,  
having in consequence thereof, arid with a view to ex­  
tend tiie ground of public confidence, proposed, among  
other declaratory and restrictive clauses, a clause ex­  
pressly securing the liberty of conscience and of the  
  
press; and Virginia having concurred in the ratifica­  
tions which made them a part of the Constitution, it  
will remain with a candid public to decide, whether it  
would not mark an inconsistency and degeneracy, if an ;  
indifference were now slienn to a palpable violation of,  
one of those rights, the freedom of the prow and to a  
precedent therein, which may be fatal to the other, the ,  
free exercise of religion. _ j  
That the precedent established by the violation of  
the former of these rights, may, as is allirmed by the ,  
resolution, be fatal to the litter, appears to be demon- j  
strablc, by a comparison of the groundsel! which they ]  
respectively rest; and from the scope of reasoning, by  
which the power over the former has been vindicated, j  
First, Both of these rights, the liberty of con-j  
science and nt&#x27; the press, rest equally on the original |  
ground of not being delegated by the Constitution, and !  
consequently withheld from the Government. Any I  
construction, therefore, that would attack this originial.  
security for the one, must have the like effect 011 the j  
other.  
Secondly. They are both equally secured by the  
supplement to the Constitution ;. being both included in I  
the same amendment, made at the name time, and by j  
the saine authority Any construction or argument,  
then, which would turn the amendment into a grant or ;  
acknowledgment of power with respect to the press,  
mi&lt;rlit be equally npplied to the freedom of religion.  
Third hi- If it be admitted that the extent of the j  
freedom of the press, secured by the amendment, is to  
be measured by the common law 011 this subject, the :  
same authority may be resorted to, for the standard  
which is to fix the extent of the &quot;free exercise of re- j  
ligion.&quot; It cannot be necessary to say what thin  
standard would be : whether the common law be ta­  
ken solely as the unwritten, or as varied by the written  
law of Kngland.  
Fourthly. If the words and phrases in the amend-&#x27;  
nicnt are to be considered as chosen with a studied!  
discrimination, which yields an argument lor a power j  
over the press, under the limitation that its freedom be 1  
not abridged, the same argument results from the same i  
consideration, for a power over the exercise of reli­  
gion, under the limitation that its freedom he not pro­  
hibited.  
For if Congress may regulate the freedom of the press, ?  
provided they do not abridge it, because it in said only, j  
&quot; they shall not abridge it,&quot; and is not said, &quot; they shall:  
make no law respecting it:&quot; the analogy of reasoning  
is conclusive, that Congress may regulate and even j  
abridg. the free exercise of religion ; provided they do j  
not firthiliit it ; because it in said only &quot;they shall not!  
prohibt it; and is nut said, &quot; they shall make no law  
rtspccltng, &lt;&gt;r no law abridging it.&quot;&#x27;  
TheGeneral Assembly were governed by the clearest  
reason then, in considering the &quot; Sedition Act,&quot; which  
legislaH&#x27;s on the freedom of the press, as establishing a  
precedent that may be fatal to tlie liberty oi conscience; |  
and it till be the duty of all, in proportion as they va-:  
lue thesecuritv of the latter, to take the alarm at every  
encroachment on llie former.  
The ,? i? concluding resolutions only remain to be ex­  
amined They are in the words following :  
&quot; Tint the good people of this Commonwealth, hav­  
&quot; ing f-vt-r felt and continuing to feel the most sincere  
&quot; affection for their brethren of the other States ; the  
&quot; truest anxiety for establishing ami perpetuating the  
&quot; I nun &lt;&gt;f all ; and the most scrupulous fidelity to  
44 tlint C&#x27;nustilution, which is tin* pledge of mutual  
&quot; frienlship, and the instrument of mutual happiness:  
&quot; the General Assembly doth solemnly appeal lo the  
&quot; like Impositions in the other States, in confidence j  
?4 that hey will concur with this Commonwealth in de­  
!l clariig, as it does hereby declare, that the acts nfore-&#x27;  
&quot; said we unconstitutional; and, that the necessary |  
&quot; and proper incisures will he taken by each, for co­  
&quot; ojieriting with this State, in maintaining unimpaired,1  
&quot; the Jnthorilies, rights, and liberties reserved in the ,  
&quot; Stat-fc respectively, or to the people.  
&quot;Tlwt the Governor be desired to transmit a copy  
&quot; of tie foregoing resolutions to the Kxecutive autho- j  
u rily of each oft he other States, with a request that  
&quot; the lime may be communicated to the Legislature!  
4i titer of; and that a copy be furnished to each of the |  
&quot; Seniors and Representatives, representing this State  
&quot; in tie Congress of the I nited Statt-s &quot;  
Thefiirness and regularity of the course of the pro­  
cecdinf, here pursued, have not protected it against  
object aos even front the sources too respectable to be  
disre&lt;jttded.  
It Ir^s been said, that itbelongs to thejudiciary ofthe  
I&#x27;uitel States, and not the State Legislatures, to de­  
clare he meaning of the Federal Constitution.  
Bu&#x27;ia declaration, that proceedings ot the Federal j  
Go veil men t are not warranted by the Constitution, is&#x27;  
a novflty neither among the citizens, nor among the !  
Legislatures of the States: nor are the citizens or the  
Legislature of Virginia, singular in the example of it i  
N&#x27;.f can the declarations of either, whether allinn:ng  
or dcaving the constitutionality of measures of tlie 1&#x27;e­  
derallfiovernment; or whether made before or after ju-:  
dicinilecisions thereon, he deemed in any point of view, J  
an assumption of the officc of the judge. The deela- j  
rntiiis, in such cases, are expressions of opinion, un­  
accompanied with any other effect than what they may j  
procicce on opinion, by exciting reflection. &#x27;1 he expo- j  
hitit/is of the judiciary, on the other hand, are carried j  
into immediate effect by force. The former may lead |  
lo a change in the legislative expression of the general  
will possibly to .1 change in the opinion of the judi-j  
cinrj; the latter enforces the general will, whilst that  
will and that opinion continue unchanged.  
Aid if there be no impropriety in declaring the un-1  
constitutionality of proceedings in the Federal Govern-j  
ment, where can he the impropriety of communica­  
tingthe declaration to other States, and inviting their 1  
concurrence in a like declaration .* What is allowable ;  
for 09c must be allowable for all ; and a freecommuni-1  
catiiQ among the Stales, where the Constitution iinpo-,  
ses m restraint, is as allowable among tlie Slate Go-&#x27;  
vernuenlsas among other public bodies or private citi-&#x27;  
zens This consideration derives a weight, that can­  
not le denied to it, from the relation of the State Le­  
gislates to the Federal Legislature, as the immediate j  
constituents of one of its branches.  
Tl* Legislatures of the States have a right also to  
oriiri:ate amendments to the Constitution, by a concur- j  
renct of two-thirds of the whole number, in applica-,  
tions to Congress for the purpose. When new States;  
are tc be formed by a junction of two or more States or j  
parts if States, the Legislatures of the States concerned j  
are, ai well as Congress, to concur in the measure.? ,  
The Hates have a right also to enter into agreements or1  
compicts, with the consent of Congress. In all such  
cases 1 communication among them results from the&#x27;  
  
object which is common to tlifin.  
It s lastly to he seen, whether the confidence ex­  
presstd by the resolution, that the necessary nntlprojtrr j  
mctisi.res would br taken by the other States lur co­  
operating with Virginia in maintaining the rights re­  
serve&quot; to the States, or (o the people, be in any decree  
liable to the objections which have been raised against  
it.  
If i: be liable to objection, it must be because either  
the obeet or the means are objectionable.  
The object being to maintain what the Constitution  
has ordained, is in itself a laudable object.  
The means are expressed in the terms &quot; the neces­  
sary aid proper measures.&quot; A proper object was to be  
pursutJ, by means both necessary and proper.  
To find an objection, then, it must be shown that  
some meaning was annexed to these general terms,  
u liich was not proper: and, for this pupose, either that  
the mrans used by the General Assembly were an ex­  
ample of improper means, or that there were no proper  
mean&gt;to which the terms could refer.  
In lac example given by the State, of declaring the  
Alien and Sedition acts to be unconstitutional, and of  
communicating the declaration to the other States, no  
trace of improper means has appeared. And if the  
other States had concurred in making a like declara­  
tion, supported too by the numerous applications flmv­  
injr immediately from the people, it can scarcely be  
doubted, that these simple means would have been as  
sufficient, as they are unexceptionable.  
It is no less certain, that other means might have  
beeti employed, which are strictly within the limits of  
the Constitution. The Legislatures of Hip States might  
have made a dirpct representation to Congress, with a  
view to obtain a rescinding of the two offensive nets;  
or, they in&#x27;cht have represented to their respective Se­  
nators in Congress, their wish, that two-thirds thereof  
would propose an explanatory amendment to the Con­  
stant on; or two-thirds of themselves, if such had been  
their option, might, by an application to Congress, have  
obtained a Convention for the same object.  
These several means,though not equally eligible in  
themselves, nor probably, to the States, were all con­  
stitutionally open f r consideration. And if the Gene­  
ral Assembly, after declaring the two acts to be un  
constitutional, the first and most obvious proceeding  
on the subject, did not undertake to point out to the  
other States, a choice among the farther measures  
that might become necessary and proper, the reserve  
will not be misconstrued by liberal minds into any cul­  
pable imputation.  
These observations appear to form a satisfactory re­  
ply to every objection which is not founded on a mis­  
conception of the terms employed in the resolutions.?  
There is one other, however, which may be of too much  
importance not to be added. It cannot be forgotten,  
that among the arguments addressed to those who appre­  
hended danger to liberty from the establishment of tlip  
General Government over so great a country, the ap­  
peal w as emphatically made to the intermediate exist­  
ence of the State Governments, between the people and  
that Government, to the vigilance with which they  
would descry the first symptoms of usurpation, and to  
the promptitude with which they would sound the alarm  
to the public. This argument was probably not with­  
out its effect; and if it was a proper one then, to recom­  
mend the establishment of the Constitution, it must be  
a proper one now, to assist in its interpretation.  
The only part of the two concluding resolutions that  
remains to be noticed, is the repetition in the first, of  
that warm affection to the Union and its members, and  
of that scrupulous fidelity to the Constitution, which  
have been invariably felt by the people of this State.  
As the proceedings were introduced with these senti­  
ments, they could not be more properly closed than in  
the sainc manner. Should there be any so fur misled  
as to call in question the sincerity of tlipse professions,  
whatever regret may be excited by the error, the Gene­  
ral Assembly cannot descend into a discussion of it.?  
Those, who have listened to the suggestion, can only  
be left to their own recollection of the part whieii this  
State has borne m the establishment of vur National la  
  
dependence, in the establishment of our National Consti­  
tution, nnd in maintaining under it tin- authority and  
laws of the In ion, u itliont a single exception of inter­  
nal resistance or commotion. 11 y recurring to these  
facts, thev will be able to convince themselves, that the  
representatives of the people of V ir&lt;rinia, must be above  
the necessity of opposing any other shield to attacks  
on their national patriotism, than their own conscious­  
ness, and the justice of an enlightened public ; who  
will perceive in the resolutions themselves, the strong­  
: est evidence of attachment both to the Constitution and  
to the Union, since it is only by maintaining the ditler­  
ent governments and departments within their respec­  
I live limits, that the blessings of either can be perpe­  
tuated.  
The extensive view of the subject thus taken by the j  
I committee, has led them to report to the House, as  
the result of the whole, the following resrl-Jtion:  
Hcsulrcd, That the General A?si?mbly, having care- i  
j fully and respectfully attended to the proceedings of u ]  
number of the States, in answer to their resolutions of  
December ^1, Iand having accurately and fully |  
re-examined and re-considercd the latter, lind it to be I  
their indispensable duty to adhere to the same, as found­  
ed in truth, an consonant with the Constitution, and as  
conducive to its preservation : nnd more especially to  
be their duty to renew,as they do hereby renew, their  
protest against &quot;the Alien and Sedition Acts,&quot; as pal­  
pable and alarming infractions of the Constitution

THE OLD LANDMARKS.  
MADISONs REPORT.  
From the Committee to whom were referred the  
Communications of various Slates, relatire to  
the Resolutions of the last General lasembly of  
this State, I Firginial concerning the Hien  
and Sedition Laws.  
Whatever room might be found in the proceed­  
ings of some of the States, who have disapproved  
of the resolutions of the General Assembly of this  
Commonwealth, passed on the 21st day of Decem­  
ber, 1798, for painful remarks on the spirit and  
manner of those proceedings, it appears to the  
Committee most consistent with the duty as well  
as dignity of the General Assembly, to hasten an  
oblivion of every circumstance which might be con­  
strued into a diminuation of mutual respect, con­  
fidence and affection, among the members of the  
Union.  
The committee have deemed it a more useful  
task, to revise with a critical eye, the resolution  
which have met with this disapprobation; to e­  
amine fully the several objections and arguments  
which have appeared against them; and to enquire  
whether there be any errors of fact, of principle,  
or of reasoning, which the candor of the General  
Assembly ought to acknowledged and correct.  
The first of the resolutions is in the words follow-  
aBesolred, That the General Assembly of Virgine  
ia doth unequivocally express a firm resointion to  
maintain and defend the Constitution of the United  
States, and the Constitution of this State, against  
every aggression, either foreign or domestic, and  
that they will support the Government of the Uni­  
ted States in all measures warranted by the for­  
mer. Taerble semment can have been made  
on the sentiments here expressed. To maintain  
and defend the Constitution of the U.S., and of  
their own State, against every aggression, both for  
eign and domestic, and to support the Government  
of the United States in all measures warranted by  
their Constitution, are duties which the General  
Assembly ought always to feel, and which, on such  
an occasion, it was evidently proper to express their  
sincere and firm adherence.  
In their next resolution.&quot;The General Assem  
bly mast solemnly declares a warm attachment to  
the Union of the States, to maintain which it pledg­  
as all its nowers and that, for this end, it is their  
duty to watch over and oppose every infraction of  
those principles, which constitute the only basls of  
that Union, because a lalnful onservanse.  
can alone secure its existence and the pumic hal  
piness.&quot;  
The observation just made is equally applicable  
to this solemn declaration, of warm attachment to  
the Union and this solemn pledge to maintain it;  
any question arise among enlightened  
     
friends of the Union, as to the duty of watching  
over and opposing every infraction of those princi­  
ples which constitute its basis, and a faithful oh-  
  
servance of which can alone secure its existence,  
and the public happiness thereon depending.  
The third resolution is in the words following:  
&quot;That this Assembly doth explicitly and perem­  
torily declare, that it views the powers of the Fed­  
eral Government, as resulting from the compact,  
to which the States are parties, as limited by the  
plain sense and intention of the instrument consti­  
tuting that compact; and that in case of a deliber­  
ate, palpable and dangerous exercise of other pow­  
ers, not granted by the said compact, the States  
who are parties thereto, have the right, and are in  
duty bound, to interpose, for arresting the progress  
of the evil, and for maintaining within their respec­  
tive limits, the authorities, rights and liberties ap­  
pertaining to them.&quot;  
On this resolutinon, the Committee have bestow­  
ed all the attention which its importance merits:  
They have scanned it not merely with a strict, but  
  
with a severe eye; and they feel confidence in pro­  
nouncing that, in its just and fair construction, it is  
unquestionably true in its several positions, as well  
as constitutional and conclusive in its references.  
The resolution declares, first, that &quot;it views the  
powers of the Federal Government, as resulting  
from the compact to which the States are parties;&quot;  
in other words, that the Federal powers are deriv-  
e eeeee  
ed from the Conslitution, and that the Constitution  
is a compact to which the States are parties.  
Clear as the position must seem, that the Federal  
powers are derived from the Constitution, and from  
that alone, the Committee are not unapprised of a  
late doctrine which opens another source of Feder-  
al powers, not less extensive and important, than  
it is new and unexpected. The examination of  
this doctrine will be most convienently connected  
with a review of a succeeding resolution. The  
committee satisfy themselves here with chiefly re-  
marking, that in all the cotemporary discussions  
and comments which the Constitution underwent,  
it was constantly justified and recommended, on  
the ground, that the powers not given to the Gov­  
ernment, were withheld from it; and that, if any  
doubt could have existed on this subject, under the  
original text of the Constitution, it is removed, as  
far as words could remove it, by the 12th amend­  
ment, now a part of the Constitution, which ex­  
pressly declares, &quot;that the powers not delegated to  
the U. S., by the Constitution, nor prohibited by  
it to the States, are reserved to the States respect­  
ively, or to the people.&quot;  
The other position involved in this branch of the  
resolution, namely, &quot;that the States are parties to  
the Constitution or compact,&quot; is, in the judgment  
of the Committee, equally free from objection. It  
is indeed true, that the term &quot;States,&quot; is some­  
times used in a vague sense, and sometimes in dif­  
ferent senses, according to the subject to which it  
is applied. Thus, it sometimes means the sepa­  
tate sections of territory occupied by the political  
societies within each, sometimes the particular  
Governments, established by those societies; some-  
times those societies as organized into those par­  
ticular Governments; and, lastly, it means the  
cople composing those political societies, in the  
highest sovereign capacity. Although it might he  
wished that the perfection of language admitted  
less diversity in the signification of the same words,  
yet, little inconviency is produced by it, where the  
true sense can be collected with certainty from the  
lifferent application. In the present instance,  
whatever different constructions of the term &quot;States&quot;  
in the resolution, may have been entertained, all  
will at least concur in that last mentioned;--he-  
eeeee e e  
cause, in that sense, the constitution was sunmnted  
to the &quot;States;&quot; in that sense, the &quot;States&quot; rati­  
fied it: and, in that sense of the term &quot;States,&quot;  
they are consequently parties to the compact, from  
which the powers of the Federal Government re­  
sull e nest positen is, thit the Genertassendly  
iews the powers of the Federal Government, &quot;as  
limited by the plain sense and intention of the in-  
strument constituting that compact,&quot; and &quot;as no  
farther valid than they are authorised by the grants  
therein enumerated.&quot; It does not seem possible,  
that any just objection can lie against either of these  
clauses. The first amounts merely to a declaration,  
that the compact ought to have the interpretation  
plainly intended by the parties to it; the other to a  
declaration, that it ought to have the execution and  
effect intended by them. If the powers granted,  
be valid, it is solely because they are granted; and,  
if the granted powers are valid, because granted,  
all other powers not granted, must not be valid.  
The resolution, having taken this view of the  
Federal compact, proceeds to infer, &quot;that in case  
of a deliberate, palpable and dangerous exercise of  
other powers not granted by the said compact, the  
States who are parties thereto, have the right and  
are in duty bound to interpose for arresting the pro­  
gress of the evil, and for maintaining within their  
respective limits, the authorities, rights and liber­  
ties appertaining to them.&quot;  
It appears to your committee to be a plain prin­  
ciple, founded in common sense, illustrated by  
common practice, and essential to the nature of  
compacts, that, where resort can be had to no in­  
bunal, superior to the authority of the parties, the  
parties themselves must be the rightful indges in  
the last resort, whether the bargain made has been  
pursued or violated. The Constitution of the C.  
S was formed by the sanction of the States, given  
by each in its sovereign capacity. It adds to the  
stability and dignity, as well as to the anthority of  
the Constitution, that it rests on this legitimate and  
solid foundation. The States then, being the par­  
ties to the constitutional compact and in their sov-  
ereign capacity, it follows of necessity, that there  
can be no tribunal above their anthority, to decide  
in the last resort, whether the compact made by  
them be violated; and, consequently, that, as the  
parties to it, they must themselves decide, in the  
last resort, such questions as may be of suflicient  
magnitude to require their interposition.  
It does not follow, however, that because the  
tates, as sovereign parties to their Constitutional  
compact, must ultimately decide whether it hes  
been violated, that such a decision ought to be in  
  
terposed, either in a hasty manner, or on doubtful  
and inferior occasions. Even in the case of ordi­  
nary Conventions between different nations, where,  
by the strict rule of interpretation, a breach of a  
part may be deemed a conditon of every other part,  
and of the whole, it is always laid down that the  
breach must be both wilful and material to justify  
an application of the rule. But in the case of an  
intimate and constitutional union, like that of the  
United States, it is evident that the interposition of  
the parties, in their sovereign capacity, can be call­  
ed for by occasions only, deeply and essentially  
affecting the vital principles of their political sys­  
 The resclation has accordingly guarded aginst  
  
any misapprehension of its object, by expressly re­  
quiring for such an interposition, &quot;the case of a  
deliberale, pelpable and dungerous breach of the  
Constitution, by the exercise of powers not grant-  
ed by it.&quot; It must be a case, not of a light and  
transient nature, but of a nature dangerous to the  
great purposes for which the Constitution was es­  
tablished. It must be a case, moreover, not ob­  
scure or doubtful in its construction, but plain and  
palpable. Lastly, it must be a case not resulting  
from a partial consideration, or hasty determina­  
tion; but a case stampt with a final consideration  
and deliberate adherence. It is not necessary, be­  
cause the resolution does not require, that the  
question should be discussed, how far the exercise  
of any particular power, ungranted by the Consti­  
tution, would justify the interposition of the parties  
to it. As cases might easily be stated, which none  
would contend ought to fall within that description;  
cases, on the other hand, might, with equal ease,  
be stated, so flagrant and so fatal, as to unite eve­  
ry opinion in placing them within the description.  
But the resolution has done more than guard  
against misconstruction, by expressly referring to  
cases of a deliberate, palpable and dangerous na­  
ture. It specifies the object of the interposition  
whih it contenplates, to te siy thal of ar  
progress of the ecil of usurpation, and of  
maintaining the authorities, rights and liberties ap­  
pertaining to the States, as parties to the Constitu­  
tio.  his wlew of the resslutin, it would acen  
inconceivable that it can incur any just disapproba­  
tion from those, who laying aside all momentary  
impressions, and recollecting the gennine source  
and object of the Federal Constitution, shall can­  
didly and accurately interpret the meaning of the  
General Assembly. If the deliberate exercise of  
dangerous powers, palpably withheld by the Con­  
stitution, could not justify the parties to it, in in­  
terposing even so far as to arrest the progress of  
the evil, and thereby to preserve the Constitution  
itself, as well as to provide for the safety of the  
parties to it; there would be an end to all relicf  
from usurped power, and a direct subversion of the  
rights specified or recognized under all the State  
Constitutions, as well as a plain denial of the fun­  
damental principle on which our independence it­  
self was declared.  
But it is objected, that the Judicial authority is  
to be regarded as the sole expositor of the Consti-  
tution, in the last resort; and it may be asked for  
what reason, the declaration by the General As­  
sembly, supposing it to be theoretically true, could  
be required at the present day and in so solemn a  
mianner.  
On this objection it might be observed, first:  
that there may be instances of usurped power, which  
the forms of the Constitution would never draw  
within the control of the Judical department: see­  
ondly, that if the decision of the Judiciary be rais-  
ed above the authority of the sovereign parties to  
the Constitution, the decivions of the other depart­  
ments, not carried by the forms of the Constitulion  
before the Judiciary, must be equally authorita-  
tive and final with the decisions of that department.  
But the proper answer to the objection is, that the  
resolution of the General Assembly relates to those  
great and extraordinary cases, in which all the  
forms of the Corstitution may prove ineffectual  
agamst infractions dangerous to the essemtil Ligils  
of the parties to it. The resolation supposes that  
dangerous powers, not delegated, may not only be  
usurped and executed by the other departments,  
but that the Judicial department also may exercise  
or sanction dangerous powers beyond the grant of  
the Constitution; and consequently, that the ulti­  
mate right of the parties to the Constitution, to  
judge whether the compact has heen dangerously  
violated, must exted to violations by one en galed  
anthority, as well as by another; by the Judiciary,  
as well as by the Executive, or the Legislature.  
However true, therefore, it may be that the Iu­  
dicial department, is, in all questions submitted to  
it by the forms of the Constitution, to decide in the  
last resort, this resort must necessarily be deemed  
the last in relation to the authorities of the other  
departments of the Government; not in relation to  
the rights of the parties to the Constitutional com­  
pact, from which the Judicial as well as the other  
slepartments hold their delegated trusts. On any  
other hypothesis, the delegation of Judicial power  
would annul the authority delegating it; and the  
concurrence of this department with the others in  
usurped powers, might subvert for ever, and be­  
yond the possible reach of any rightful remedy, the  
ery Constitution, which all were instituted to pre-  
The truth declared in the resolution being estab­  
lished, the expediency of making the declaration at  
the present day, may safely be left to the temuper­  
ate consideration and candid judgment of the Amer­  
ican public. It will be remembered, that a fre­  
quent recurrence to fundamental principles, is sol­  
emnly enjoined by most of the State Constitutions,  
and particularly by our own, as a necessary  
guard against the danger of degeneracy to which  
republies are liable, as well as other Governments,  
though in a less degree than others. And a fair  
comparison of the political doctrines not unftequent  
at the present day, with those which charncterized  
the epoch of our Revolution, and which form the  
basis of our Republican Constitutions, will best de  
termine whether the declaratory recurrence here  
made to those principles, ought to be viewed as  
unreasonable and improper, or as a vigilant dis­  
charge of an important duty. The authority of  
Constitutions over Governments, and of the soy­  
creignty of the people over Constitutions, are truths  
which are at all times necessary to be kept in mind;  
and at no time perhaps more necessary than at the  
present

and Sedition Laws.  
Con tinwed.  
The fourth resolution stands as follows:  
&quot;That the General Assenibly doth also express  
its deep regret, that a spirit has in sundry instan  
ces, been manifested by the Federal Government,  
to enlarge its powers by forced constructions of the  
Constitutional charter which defines them; and  
that indications have appeared of a design to ex-  
pound certain general phrases, (which, having been  
copied from the very limited grant of powers in the  
former articles of confederation, were the less liable  
to be misconstrued,) so as to destroy the meaning  
and effect of the particular enumeration which  
necessarily explains, and limits the general phrases;  
and so as to consolidate the States by degrees, into  
one sovereignty, the obvious tendency and inevita­  
ble result of which would be, to transform the pres­  
ent Republican system of the United States, into  
an absolute, or at best a mixed monarchy.&quot;  
The first question here to be considered is, wheth-  
er a spirit has in sundry instances been manilested  
by the Federal Government to enlarge its powers  
by forced constructions of the Constitutional char­  
 The leneral Assemldy having declared their o  
pinion merely by regretting in general terms that  
forced constructions for enlarging the F&#x27;ederal pow­  
ers have taken place, it does not appear to the  
Committee necessary to go into a specification o.  
every instance to which the resolution may allude.  
The Alien and Sedition Acts being particularly  
named in a succeeding resolution, are of course, to  
be understood as included in the allusion. Omit­  
ting others which have less occupied public atten-  
tion, or been less extensively regarded as uncon-  
stitutional, the resolution may be presumed to re-  
fer particularly to the Bank law, which, from the  
circumstances of its passage, as well as the latitude  
of construction on which it is founded, strikes the  
attention with singular force; and the carriage tax,  
distinguished also by circumstances in its history  
having a similar tendency. Those instances alone,  
if resulting from forced construction and calculated  
to enlarge the powers of the Federal Government,  
as the Committee, cannot but conceive to be the  
case, sufficiently warrant this part of the resolution.  
The Committee have not thought it incumbent on  
them to extend their attention to laws which have  
not been objected to rather as varying the Consti­  
tutional distribution of powers in the Federal Gov­  
ernment, than as an absolute enlargement of them;  
because instances of this sort, however important  
in their principles and tendencies, do not appear to  
fall strictly within the text under review.  
The other questions presenting themselves, are  
1. Whether indications have appeared of a design  
to expound certain general phrases copied from the  
&quot;Articles of the Confederation&quot; so as to destroy  
the effect of the particular enumeration explaining  
and limiting their meaning. 2. Whether this ex-  
position would by degrees consolidate the States  
into one sovereignty. 3. Whether the tendency  
and result of this consolidation would be to trans­  
form the Republican system of the U. States into a  
monarchy.  
1. The general phrases here meant must be those  
&quot;of providing for the common defence and general  
welfare.&quot;  
In the &quot;Articles of Confederation,&quot; the phrases  
are used as follows, in Art. VIII. &quot;All charges of  
war, and all other expenses that shall be incurred  
for the common defence and general welfure, and  
illowed by the U. S. in Congress assembled, shall  
be defrayed out of a common Treasury, which shall  
be supplied by the several States, in proportion to  
the value of all land within each State, granted to,  
or surveyed for any person, as such land fand the  
buildings and improvements thereon shall be estim-  
ated, according to such mode as the U. S. in Con  
gress assembled, shall from time to time direct and  
appoint.&quot;  
in the existing Constitution, they make the fol  
lowing part of See. 8: &quot;The Congress shall have  
power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and  
excises to pay debts, and provide for the common  
defence and general welfare of the U. States.  
This similarity in the use of these phrases in the  
two great Federal charters, might be wen conside  
ee a  o  
ered, as rendering their meaning less liable to be  
misconstrued in the latter; because it will scarce  
ly be said, that in the former they were ever un­  
derstood to be either a&#x27; general grant of power,  
or to authorise the requisition or application of  
money by the old Congress to the common defence  
and general welfare, except in the cases afterwards  
eee oeeo tite to  
enumerated, which explamed and limnited then  
meaning; and if such was the limited meaning at-  
tached to these phrases in the very instrument re  
vised and remodeled by the &#x27;present Constitution,  
it can never be supposed that when copied into this  
Constitution, a different meaning ought to be at-  
tached to them.  
That, notwithstanding the remarkable security  
against misconstruction, a design has been indicat  
ed to expound these phrases in the Constitution, so  
as to destroy the effect of the particular enuniera  
tion of powers by which it explains and limits them,  
must have fallen under the observation of those  
who have attended to a course of public transact  
ions. Not to multiply proofs on this subject, it  
will suffice to refer to the debates of the Federal  
Legislature, in which arguments have on different  
occasions been drawn, with apparent effect, from  
these phrases, in their indefinite meaning.  
To these indications might be added, without  
looking farther, the official report on manufactures,  
by the late Secretary of the Treasury, made on the  
5th of December, 1791; and the report of a Com­  
mittee of Congress, in January, 1797, on the pro­  
matien of Agriculture. In the first of these it is  
expressly contended to belong &quot;to the discretion of  
the National Legislature to pronounce ye   
fects which concern the gencral welfare, and for  
  
  
which, under that description, an appropriation of  
money is requisite and proper. And there seems  
to be no room for a doubt that whatever concerns  
the general interests of LEArNing, of Arrcul­  
TurE, of MAnueactures, and of CoMMtercE,  
are within the sphere of the National Councils, as  
  
fur as regards an application of money.&quot; The  
latter report assumes the same latitude of power in  
the National Councils, and applies it to the encour­  
agement of agriculture, by means of a scoiety to  
be established at the Seat of Government. Al­  
though neither of these reports may have received  
the sanction of a law carrying it into effect; yet,  
on the other hand, the extraordinary doctrine con­  
tained in both, has passed without the slightest pos­  
itive mark of disapprobation from the authority to  
which it was addressed.  
Now, whether the phrases in question be con-  
strued to authorise every measure relating to the  
common defence and general welfare, as contend­  
ed by some; or every measure only in which there  
might be on application of money, as suggested by  
the caution of others; the effect must substantially  
be the same, in destroying the import and force of  
the particular enumeration of powers which follow  
these general phrases in the Constitution. For it  
s evident, that there is not a single power what­  
ever, which may not have some reference to the  
common defence, or the general welfare; nor a  
power of any magnitude, which, in its exercise,  
does not involve ar admit an application of money.  
The Government, therefore, which possesses pow  
er in either one or other of these extents, is a Gov-  
ernment without the limitations formed by a par-  
ticular enumeration, is destroyed by the exposition  
iven to these general phrases.  
This conclusion will not be affected by any at-  
tempt to qualify the power over the &quot;general wel­  
fare,&quot; by referring it to cases where the genera!  
wcelfure is beyond the reach of separate provisions  
by the indiridual Stales; and leaving to these their  
jurisdictions in cases, to which their separate pro-  
visions may be competent. For, as the authority  
of the individual States must in all cases be incom-  
petent to general regulations operating throngh the  
whole, the authority of the United States would  
be extended to every object relating to the general  
welfare, which might, by any possibility, be provi-  
ded for by the general authority. This qualifying  
construction, therefore, would have little, if any  
tendency, to circumscribe the power claimed under  
the latitude of the terms &quot;general welfare.&quot;  
The true and fair construction of this expression,  
both in the original and existing Federal compacts,  
appears to the committee too obvious to be mista-  
ken. In both, the Congress is authorised to pro­  
vide money for the common defence and general  
welfare. In both, is subjoined to this authority, an  
enumeration of the cases, to which their powers  
shall extend. Money cannot be applied to the  
general welfure, otherwise than by an application  
of it to some particular measure, conducive to the  
general welfare. Whenever, therefore, money has  
been raised by the general authority, and is to be  
applied to a particular measure, a question arises,  
whether the particular measure be within the enu­  
merated authorities vested in Congress. If it be,  
the money requisite for it, may be applied to it; if  
it be not, no such application can be made. This  
fair and obvious interpretation coincides with, and  
is enforced by, the clause in the Constitution, which  
declares, that &quot;no money shall be drawn from the  
Treasury, but in consequence of appropriations by  
aw.&quot; An appropriation of money to the general  
welfare, would be deemed rather a mockery than  
an observance of this Constitutional injunction.  
2. Whether the exposition of the general phrases  
here combatted, would not by degrees consolidate  
the States into one sovereignty, is a question, con-  
eoooeeeeoee e  
cerning which the committee can perceive iitle  
room for difference of opinion. To consolidate the  
States into one sovereignty, nothing more can be  
wanted, than to supersede their respective sover­  
eignties in the cases reserved to them, by extend­  
ing the sovereignty of the U. S, to all cases of the  
&quot;general welfare,&quot; that is to say, to all cases what­  
 Tit the olvious tendency and incvitable re­  
sult of a consolidation of the States into one sover­  
eignty, would be to transform the Republican sys­  
tem of the United States into a monarchy, is a point  
which seems to have been sufficiently decided by  
the general sentiment of America. In almost eve­  
ry instance of discussion, relating to the consolida­  
tion in question, its certain tendency to pave the  
way to monarchy, seems not to have been contest­  
ed. The prospect of such a consolidation, has  
formed the only topic of controversy. It would be  
unnecessary, therefore, for the committee to dwell  
long on the reasons which support the position of  
the General Assembly. It may not be improper,  
however, to remark two consequences, evidently  
flowing from an extension of the Federal powers to  
every subject falling within the idea of the &quot;general  
welfare.  
One consequence must be, to enlarge the sphere  
of discretion allotted to the Executive Magistrate.  
Even within the legislative limits properly defined  
by the Constitution, the difficulty of accommoda­  
ting legal regulations to a country so great in ex­  
tent, and so vatious in its circumstances, has been  
much felt; and has led to occasional investments  
of power in the Executive, which involve perhaps  
as large a portion of discretion, as can be deemed  
consistent with the nature of the Executive trust.  
In proportion as the objects of Legislative care  
might be multiplied, would the time allowed for  
each be diminished, and the difficulty of providing  
uniform and particular regulations for all, be in­  
creased. From these sources would necessarily  
ensue a greater latitude to the agency of that de­  
partment which is always in existence, and which  
could best mould regulations of a general nature,  
so as to suit them to the diversity of particular situ­  
ations. And it is in this latitude, as a supplement  
to the deficiency of the laws that the degree of Ex­  
ecutive prerogative materially consists.

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

The other consequence would be, that of an ex­  
essive angmentation of the offices, honors and  
moluments depending on the executive will. Add  
to the present legitimate stock, all those of every  
description which a consolidation of the States  
would take from them, and turn over to the Fed­  
eral Government, and the patronage of the Execu­  
tive would necessarily be as much swelled in this  
case, as its prerogative would be in the other.  
This disproportionate increase of prerogative and  
patronage, must, evidently either enable the Chief  
Magistrate of the Union, by quiet means, to secure  
his re-election from time to time, and finally, to  
regulate the succession as he might please; or, by  
giving so transcendant an importance to the office,  
would render the elections to it so violent and cor-  
  
rupt, that the public voice itself might call for an  
hereditary, in place of an elective succession.  
Whichever of these events might follow, the trans­  
formation of the Republican system of the United  
States into a monarchy, anticipated by the General  
Assembly from a consolidation of the States into  
one sovereignty, would be equally accomplished;  
and whether it would be into a mixed or an abso­  
lute monarchy, might depend on too many contin­  
gencies to admit of any certain foresight.  
The resolution next in order, is contained in the  
following terms:  
&quot;That the General Assembly doth particularly  
protest against the palpable and alarming infractions  
of the Constitution, in the two late cases of the  
&quot;Alien and Sedition Acts,&quot; passed at the last ses­  
sion of Congress; the first of which exercises a  
power no where delegated to the Federal Govern­  
ment; and which, by uniting Legislative and Ju­  
dicial powers to those of Executive, subverts the  
general principles of a free Government, as well as  
the particular organization and pesitive provisions  
of the Federal Constitation; and the other of which  
acts exercises, in like manner, a power not dele­  
gated by the Constitution; hut, on the contrary,  
expressly and positively forbidden by one of the  
aniendments thereto: a power, which, more than  
any other, ought to produce universal alarm; be-  
cause it is levelled against that right of freely ex-  
amining public characters and mensures, and of  
free communication among the people thereon,  
which has ever been justly deemed the only eflec  
tual guardian of every other right.&quot;  
The subject of this resolution having, it is pre  
sumed, more particularly led the General ssem-  
bly into the proceedings which they communicated  
to the other States, and being in itself of peculiar  
importance, it deserves the most critical and faith-  
ful investigation; for the leagth of which no other  
pology will be necessary.  
The subject divides itself into first, &quot;The Alien  
Act,&quot; secondly, &quot;The Sedition Act.&quot;  
Of the &quot;Alien Act,&quot; it is affirmed by the Reso  
lution, 1st. That it exercises a power nowhere  
delegated to the Federal Government. 2d. That  
it unites Legislative and Judicial powers to those  
of the Executive. 3d. That this union of power  
subverts the general principles of free government.  
4th. That it subverts the particular organization  
and positive provisions of the Federal Constitution  
In order to clear the way for a correct view of  
the first position, several observations will be pre-  
mised.  
In the first place, it is to be borne in mind, that  
it being a characteristic feature of the Federal Con-  
titution, as it was originally ratified, and an amend  
ment thereto having precisely declared, &quot;That the  
powers not delegated to to U.S, by the Constitu  
tion, nor prohibited by it to the States are reserved  
to the States respectively, or to the people;&quot; it is  
incumbent in this, as in every other exercise of  
power by the Federal Government, to prove from  
the Constitution, that it grants the particular power  
xercised.  
The next observation to be made, is, that much  
confusion and fallacy, have been thrown into the  
questions, by blending the two cases of aliens, mem-  
bers of a hostile nation; and aliens, members of  
friendly nalions. These two cases are so obvi­  
ously and so essentially distinct, that it occasions  
no little surprise that the distinction should have  
been disregarded; and the surprise is so much the  
greater, as it appears that the two cases are actu­  
ally distinguished by tivo separate acts of Congress,  
passed at the same session, and comprised in the  
same publication; the one providing for the case  
of &quot;alien enemies;&quot; the other &quot;concerning aliens&quot;  
indiscriminately; and consequently extending to  
aliens of every nation in peace and amity with the  
United States. With respect to alien enemies, no  
doubt has been intimated as to the Pederalauthori-  
ty over them; the Constitution having expressly  
delegated to Congress the power to declare war  
against any nation, and of course to treat it and all  
its members as enemies. With respect to aliens,  
who are not enemies, but members of nations in  
peace and amity with the U. States, the power as­  
sumed by the act of Congress, is denied to be Con­  
stitutional; and it is accordingly against this act,  
that the protest of the General Assembly is express­  
ly and exclusively directed.  
A third observation is, that were it admitted, as  
is contended, that the &quot;act concerning Aliens,&quot;  
has for its object, not a penal but a prerentire  
justice; it would still remain to be proved that it  
comes within the Constitutional power of the Fed­  
eral Legislature; and if within its power, that the  
Legislature has exercised it in a Constitutional  
manner.  
In the administration of preventive justice, the  
following principles have been held sacred; that  
some probable ground of suspicion be exhibited be-  
fore some Judicial authority; that it be supported  
by oath or affirmation; that the party may avoid  
being thrown into confinement, by finding pledges  
or sureties for his legal conduct sufficient in the  
judgment of some Judicial authority; that he may  
have the benefit of a writ of habeas corpus, and  
thus obtain his release, if wrongfully confined; and  
that he may at any time be discharged from his re­  
cognizance, or his confinement, and restored to his  
former liberty and rights, on the order of the proper  
Judicial authority, if it shall see sufficient cause.  
All these principles of the only preventive justice  
known to American jurisprudence, are violated by  
the Alien act. The ground of suspicion is to be  
judged of, not by any Judicial anthority, but by  
the Executive Magistrate alone; no oath or affirma­  
tion is required; if the suspicion be held reasona­  
ble by the President, or he may order the suspect-  
ed Alien to depart the territory of the U. S., with­  
out the opportunity of avoiding the sentence by  
finding pledges for his future good conduct; as the  
President may limit the time of departure as he  
pleases, the benefit of the writ of habeas corpus  
may be suspended with respect to the party, al  
though the Constitution ordains, that it shall not  
be suspended, unless when the public safety may  
require it in case of rebellion or invasion, neither  
  
of which existed at the passage of the act; and the  
party being, under the sentence of the Presidemt,  
either removed from the U. S., or being punished  
by imprisonment, or disqualification ever to become  
a citizen on conviction of not obeying the order of  
removal, he cannot be discharged from the pro­  
ceedings against him, and restored to the benefits  
of his former situation, although the highest Judl­  
cial authority should see the most sufficient cause  
for it.  
But, in the last place, it can never be admitted,  
that the removal of aliens, authorised by the act,  
is to be considered, not as punishment for an of­  
fence; but as a measure of precaution and preven­  
tion. If the banishment of an alien from a country  
  
into which he has been invited, as the asylum most  
auspicious to his happiness; a country, where he  
may have formed the most tender of connections,  
where he may have vested his entire property, and  
acquired property of the real and permanent, as  
well as the moveable and temporary kind; where  
he enjoys under the laws, a greater share of the  
blessings of personal security and personal liberty,  
than he can elsewhere hope for, and where he may  
have nearly completed his probationary title to  
citizenship; if, moreover, in the execution of the  
sentence against him, he is to be exposed, not only  
to the ordinary dangers of the sea, but to the pe-  
culiar casualties incident to a crisis of war, and of  
unusual licentiousness on that element, and possi  
bly to vindictive purposes which his emigration it-  
self may have provoked; if a banishment of this  
sort be not a punishment, and among the severest  
of punishments, it will be difficult to imagine a  
doom to which the name can be applied. And if  
it be a punishment, it will remain to be enquired,  
whether it can be constitutionally inflicted, on mere  
suspicion, by the single will of the Executive Mag­  
istrate, on persons convicted of no personal offence  
against the laws of the land, nor involved in any  
offence against the law of nations, charged on the  
foreign state of which they are members,  
One argument offered in justification of this pow  
er exercised over aliens, is, that the admission of  
them into the country being of faver not of right,  
the favor is at all times revocable.  
To this argument it might be answered, that al­  
lowing the truth of the inference, it would be no  
proof of what is required. A question would still  
occur, whether the Constitution had vested the dis­  
cretionary power of admitting Aliens, in the Fed­  
eral Government or in the State Governments.  
But it cannot be a true inference, that because  
the admission of an Alien is a favor, the favor may  
be revoked at pleasure. A grant of land to an in­  
dividual, may be of favor, not of right; but the  
moment the grant is made, the favor becomes a  
right, and must be forfeited before it can be taken  
away. To pardon a malefactor may be a favor,  
but, the pardon is not, on that account, the less ir­  
revocable. To admit an Alien to naturalization,  
is as much a favor, as to admit him to reside in the  
country; yet it cannot be pretended, that a person  
naturalized can be deprived of the benefit, any  
more than a native citizen can be disfranchised.  
Again, it is said, that Aliens not being parties to  
the Constitution, the rights and privileges which it  
secures, cannot be at all claimed by them.  
To this rensoning also, it might be answered  
that although Aliens are not parties to the Consti  
tution, it does not follow that the Constitutionh  
vested in Congress an absolute power over them  
The parties to the Constitution may have granted  
or retained, or modified the power over Aliens  
without regard to that particular consideration.  
But a more direct reply is, that it does not fol  
low, because Aliens are not parties to the Consti  
tution, as citizens are parties to it, that whilst they  
actually conform to it, they have no right to its pro  
tection. Aliens are not more parties to the laws  
than they are parties to the Constitution; yet, it  
will not be disputed, that as they owe on one hand,  
a temporary obedience, they are entitled in return  
to their protection and advantage.  
If Aliens had no rights under the Constitution,  
they might not only be banished, but even capital  
y punished, without a jury or the other incident  
to a fair trial. But so far has a contrary principle  
been carried, in every part of the United States,  
that except on charges of treason, an Alien has,  
besides all the common privileges, the special one  
of being tried by a jury, of which one half may be  
also Aliens.  
It is said, further, that by the laws and practice  
of nations, Aliens may he removed at discretion,  
for offences against the law of nations; that Con  
gress are authorised to define and punish such of  
fences; and that to be dangeraus to the peace of  
society is, in Aliens, one of those offences.  
The distinction between Alien enemies and Alien  
friends, is clear and conclusive answer to this argu  
ment. Alien enemies are under the law of nations,  
and liable to be punished for offences against it.  
Alien friends, except in the single case of public  
ministers, are under the municipal law and must  
be tried and punished according to that law only.  
This argument also, by referring the Alien act,  
to the power of Congress to define and punish of  
fences against the law of nations, yields the point  
that the act is of a penal, not merely of a preven-  
tive operation. It must, in truth, be so considered  
And if it be a penal act, the punishment it inflicts  
must be justified by some offence that deserves it.  
Offences for which Aliens, within the jurisdiction  
of a country, are punishable, are first, offences  
committed hy the nation of which they make a  
part, and in whose offences they are involved:  
Secondly, offences committed by themselves alone,  
without any charge against the nation to which  
they belong. The first is the case of Alien ene­  
mies; the second, the case of Alien friends. In  
the first case, the offending nation can no otherwise  
be punished than by war, one of the laws which  
authorises the expulsion of such of its members, as  
may be found within the country, against which  
the offence has been committed. In the second  
case, the offence being committed by the individn.  
al, not by his nation, and against the mumnicipal law,  
not against the law of nations, the individual only.  
and not the nation, is punishable; and the punish.  
ment minst be conducted according to the municipal  
law, hof according to the law of nations. Under  
this viow of the suhject, the act of Congress, for  
the removal of Alien enemies, being conformable  
to the law of nations, is justified by the Constitution:  
and the tact,&quot; for the removal of Alien friends, be­  
ing repuguant to the Constitutional principles of  
municipal law, is unjustifiable.  
e  
Nor is the act of Congress, for the removal of  
Ahien friends, more agrecable to the general prac.  
  
tice of nations, than it is within the purview of the  
law of nations. The general practice of nations,  
distinguishes between Alien friends and Alien ene­  
mies. The latter it has proceeded against, accord­  
ing to the law of nations, by expelling them as ene­  
mies. The former it has considered as under a lo­  
cal and temporary allegiance, and entitled to a cor­  
respondent protection. If contrary instances are  
to be found in barbarous countries, under undefined  
prerogatives, or amid revolutionary dangers; they  
will not be deemed fit precedents for the Govern­  
ment of the United States, even, if not beyond its  
Constitutional authority.  
To be continued.

Continued.  
It is said that Congress may grant letters of  
marque and reprisal; that reprisals may be made  
on persons, as well as property; and that the re  
moval of Aliens may be considered as the exercise  
in an inferior degree, of the general power of re-  
prisal on person  
ithout entering minutely into a question that  
does not seem to require it, it may be marked, that  
reprisal is a seizure of foreign persons or property  
with a view to obtain that justice for injuries done  
by one State or its members, to another State or  
its members; for which a refusal of the aggressor  
requires such a resort to force under the law of na-  
tions. It must be considered as an abuse of words  
to call the removal of persons from a country,  
seizure or reprisal on them; nor is the distinction  
to be overlooked hetween reprisals on persons  
I  
within the country and under the faith of its laws,  
and on persons out of the country. But, laying  
aside these considerations, it is evidently impossi­  
ble to bring the Alien act within the power of grant-  
ing reprisals; since it does not allege or imply any  
injury received from any particular nation, for which  
this proceeding against its members was intended  
as a reparation. The proceeding is authorised a­  
gainst Aliens of erery aation; of nations charged  
neither with any similar proceeding against Ameri­  
can citizens, nor with any injuries for which juse  
tice might be sought, in the mode preseribed by the  
o i e  o aeee  
ct. Wereit truc, therelore, that good causes ex-  
isted for reprisais against one or more freign na-  
tions, and that neither the persons nor property of  
its members, under the faith of our laws, could  
plead an exemption; the operation of the act ought  
to have been limited to the Aliens among us, be-  
longing to such nations. To licence reprisals agains  
all nations, for aggressiens clrirged on one only,  
would be a measure as contrary to every principle  
of justice and public law, as to a wise policy, and  
the universal practice of nations.  
It is said, that the right of removing Aliens is an  
incident to the power of war, vested in Congress  
by the Constitution.  
This is a former argument in a new shape only:  
and is answered by repeating, that the removal of  
AAlien enemies is an incident to the power of war;  
that the removal of Alien friends, is not an incident  
to the power of war.  
It is said, that Congress are by the Constitution  
to protect each State against invasion; and that the  
means of prereating invasion are included in the  
power of protection against it.  
The power of war in general, having been before  
granted by the Constitutior; this clause must el­  
ther be a mere specification for greater caution and  
certainty, of which there are other examples in the  
instrument; or be the injunction of a duty, super­  
added to a grant of the power. Under either e­  
planation, it cannot enlarge the powers of Congress  
on the subject. The power and the duty to pro­  
tect each State against all invading enemy, would  
be the same under the general power, if this regard  
to greater caution had been omitted.  
Invasion is an eperation of war. To protect  
against invasion is an exercise of the power of war.  
A power, therefore, not incident to war, cannot he  
incident to a particular modification of war. And  
as the removal of alien friends has appeared to be  
no incident to a general state of war, it cannot he  
incident to a partial state, or a particular medifica­  
tion of war.  
Nor can it ever be granted, that a power to act  
on a case, when it actually occurs, includes a pow­  
er over all the means that may lend to prerent the  
occurrence of the case. Such a latitude of con-  
truction would render unavailing, every practica-  
ble definition of particular and limited nawers. I&quot;  
der the idea of preventing war in general, as well  
as invasion in particular, not only an indiscriminate  
removal of all aliens might be enforced; but a thou  
sand other things still more remote from the ope  
rations and precantions appurtenant to war, might  
take place. A higotted or tyrannical nation might  
threaten us with war, unless certain religious or  
political regulations were adopted by us; yet it  
never could be inferred, if the regulations which  
would prevent war, were such as Congress had  
otherwise no power to make, that the power to  
make them would grow out of the purpose they  
were to answer. Congress have power to suppress  
insurrections, yet it would not be allowed to fol­  
low, that they might employ all the means tending  
to prevent them; of which a system of moral in­  
struction for the ignorant, and of provident support  
for the poor, might be regarded as among the most  
efficacions.  
One argument for the power of the General Gov­  
ernment to remove aliens, would have been passed  
in silence, if it had appeared under any authority  
inferior to that of a report, made during the last  
session of Congress, to the House of Representa-  
  
tives by a committee, and approved by the House.  
The doctrine on which this argument is founded,  
is of so new and so extraordinary a character, and  
strikes so radically at the political system of Amer­  
ica, that it is proper to state it in the very words  
of the report:  
&quot;The act fconcerning aliens, ) is said to he un-  
  
constitutional, because to remove aliens, is a direct  
breach of the Constitution, which provides, by the  
9th section of the 1st article; that the migration or  
importation of such persons as any one of the States  
hall think proper to admit, shall not he prohibited  
by the Congress, prior to the year 1898.  
Among the answers given to this objection to the  
constitutionality of the act, the following very re-  
markable one is extraoted:  
&quot;Thirdly, that as the Constitution has giren to  
the Slates, no power to remove aliens, during the  
period of the limitation, under consideration, in the  
meantime, on the construction assumed, there  
would be no authority in the country, empowered  
to send away dangerous aliens, which cannot I  
admitted.&quot;  
The reasoning here used, would not in any view,  
be conclusive; because there are powers exercised  
by most other Governments, which, in the United  
States are withheld by the people, both from the  
General Government and from the State Govern  
ments. Of this sort are many of the powers pro-  
hibited by the declarations of right prefixed to the  
Constitutions, or by the clauses in the Constitutions,  
in the nature of such declarations, Nay, so far is  
the political system of the United States distin  
guishable from that of other countries, by the cau  
tion with which powers are delegated and defined;  
that in one very important case, even of commer.  
cial regulation and revenue, the power is absolute-  
ly locked up against the hands of both Govern  
ments. A tax on exports can be laid by no Con  
titutional authority whatever. Under a system  
thus peculiarly guarded; there could surely be no  
ibsurdity in supposing, that if alien friends, who if  
guilty of treasonable machinations may be punish-  
ed, or if suspected on probable grounds, may be  
ecured by pledges or imprisonment, in like man-  
ner with permanent citizens, were never meant to  
be subjected to banishment by any arbitrary and  
unusual process, either under the one Government  
or the other.  
But, it is not the inconclusiveness of the general  
reasoning in this passage, which chiesly calls the  
attention to it. It is the principle assumed by it,  
hat the powers held by the States, are given to  
them hy the Constitution of the U.S.; and the in-  
ference from this principle, that the powers sup­  
posed to be necessary which are not so given to the  
State Governments, must reside in the Government  
of the U.e.  
ho respebt, which is f it for every portion of  
constituted authorities, forbids some of the re-  
flections which this singular paragraph might ex-  
cite; and they are the more readily suppressed, as  
it may be presumed, with justice perhaps, as well  
as candor, that inadvertence may have had its share  
in the error. It would be an unjustifiable delicacy,  
nevertheless, to pass by so portentous a claim, pro­  
ceeding from so high an anthority, without a moni­  
tory notice of the fatal tendencies with which it  
would be pregnant.  
Lastly, it is said, that a law on the same subject  
with the Alien Act, passed by this State, originally  
in 1785, and re-enacted in 1792, is a proof that a  
ummary removal of suspected Aliens, was not  
heretofore regarded by the Virginia Legislature, as  
liable to the objections now urged against such a  
mncasure.  
This charge against Virginia vanishes before the  
imple remark, that the law of Virginia relates to  
&quot;suspicious persons being the subjects of any for­  
ign power er State, who shall have made a de-  
claration of war, or actually commenced hos­  
tics, or from whom the l&#x27;resident shall apprehend  
hostile designs;&quot; whereas the act of Congress re-  
lates to aliens, being the subjects of foreign powers  
and States, who have nelther declared war, nor  
commeaced hostilities, nor from whom hostile de­  
signs are apprehende!.  
H. It is next affirmed of the Alien Act, that it  
unites Legislative, Judicial and Executive powers  
 the hands of the President.  
However difficult it may be to mark, in every  
ase, with clearness and certainty, the line which  
divides Legislative power, from the other depart­  
ments of power; all will agree, that the powers  
referred to these departments may be so general  
nd undefined, as to be of a Legislative, not of an  
ecutive or Indicial nature, and may for that rea-  
son be unconstitutional. Details to a certain de­  
gree, are essential to the nature and character of a  
iw; and on criminal subjects, it is proper, that  
letails should leave as little as possible to the dis-  
cretion of those who are to apply and to execute the  
iw. If nothing nlore were required, in exercising  
aLegislative trust, than a general conveyance of  
tuthority, without laying down any precise rules,  
by which the authority conveyed, should be carried  
into effhet, it would follow, that the whole power  
of legislation might be transferred by the Legisla-  
ture from itself, and proclamations might become  
substitutes for laws. A delegation of power in this  
latitude, would not be denied to be a union of the  
different powers.  
To determine, then, whether the appropriate  
powers of the distinct departments are united by  
the act authorizing the Executive to remove aliens,  
it must be enquired whether it contains such de­  
tails, definitions and rules as appertain to the true  
character of a law by which personal liberty is in­  
aded, property deprived of its value to the owner,  
and life itself indirectly exposed to danger.  
The Alien Act declares, &quot;That it shall be law­  
ful for the President to order all such Aliens as he  
shall judge dangerons to the peace and safety of  
the U. S., or shall have reasonable ground to sus­  
pect, are concerned in any treasonable, or scere  
machinutions, against the government thereof, to  
depart,&quot; &amp;c.  
Could a power be well given in terms less defi­  
nite, less particular, and less precise? To be dan-  
  
gerous to the public safely, to be suspected of  
  
cret machinalions against the Government; these  
can never be mistaken for legal rules or certain  
definitions. They leave every thing to the Presi  
dent. His will is the law.  
But, it is not a Legislative power only that is  
given to the President. He is to stand in the place  
of the Judiciary also. His suspicion is the only  
evidence which is to convict; his order, the only  
judgment which is to be executed.  
Thus, it is the President whose will it is to de  
signate the offensive conduct; it is his will that is  
to ascertain individuals on whom it is charged; and  
it is his will that is to cause the sentence to be ex  
ecuted. It is rightly affirmed, therefore, that the  
act unites Legislative and Judicial powers to those  
of the Executive.  
II. It is affirmed, that this union of power sub  
verts the general principles of free Government,  
It has become an axiom in the science of Gove  
ernment, that a separation of the Legislative, I  
ecutive, and Judicial departments, is necessary to  
the preservation of public liberty. No where has  
this axiom been better understood in theory, or  
more carefully pursned in practice, than in the Uni  
ted States.  
IV. It is affirmed that such a union of powers  
subverts the particular organization and positive  
provisions of the F&#x27;ederal Constitution.  
According to the particular organization of the  
Constitution, its Legislative powers are vested in  
the Congress, its Executive powers in the P&#x27;resi-  
lent, and its Judicial powers in a supreme and in  
ferior tribunals. The union of any two of these  
powers, and still more of all these, in any one of  
these departments, as has been shown to be done  
by the Alien Act, must consequently subvert the  
constitutional organization of them.  
That positive provision, in the Constitution, se  
curing to individuals the benefits of fair trial, are  
ilso violated by the union of powers in the Alien  
Act, necessarily results from the two facts, that the  
act relates to Alien friends, and that Alien friends  
being under the municipal law only, are entitled to  
its protection.  
The secon! object against which the resolution  
protests, is the Sedition Aet.  
Of this act it is affirmed, 1. That it exercises in  
like manner a power not delegated by the Consti  
tution. 2. That the power on the contrary, is ex  
pressly and positively forbidden by one of the  
amendments to the Constitution. 3. That this is  
a power, which more than any other ought to pro  
duce universal alarm, because it is levelled against  
that right of freely examining public characters and  
measures, and of free communication thereon, which  
as ever hoen justly deemed the only effectual  
nardian of every other right.  
1. That it exercises a power not delegated by the  
Constitution.  
Here again, it will be proper to recollect, that  
the Federal Government being composed of pow-  
ers specifically granted with a reservation of all  
others to the States or to the People, the positive  
ruthority under which the Sedition Act could be  
assed must be produced by those who assert its  
constitutionality. In what part of the Constitutien,  
then, is this authority to be sound?  
Several attempts have been made to answer thi  
nestion, which will be examined in their order.  
The committee will begin with one, which has fill-  
them with equal astonishment and apprehension.  
and which, they cannot but persuade themselves  
must have the same effect on all, who will consid  
er it with coolness and impartiality, and with a  
reverence for our Constitution, in the true charac  
ter in which it issued from the sovereign authorit  
of the people. The committee refer to the doctrine  
lately advanced as a sanction to the Sedition Act;  
&quot;that the common or unwritien law,&quot; a law of vast  
extent and complexity, and embracing almost eve  
ry possible subject of legislation, both civil and  
criminal, makes a part of the law of these States,  
in their united and national capacity.  
The novelty, and in the judgment of the com-  
mittee, the extravagance of this pretension, would  
have consigned it to the silence, in which they have  
assed by other arguments, which an extraordinary  
seal for the act has drawn into the discussion. Lut  
the auspices, under which this innovation present  
itself, have constrained the committee to bestow on  
it an attention, which other considerations miig  
ave forhidden.  
In executing the task, it may be of use, to look  
ack to the colonial state of this country, prior to  
the Revolution; to trace the effect of the revolution  
which converted the colonics into independent  
States; to inquire into the import of the articles of  
onfederation, the first instrument by which the  
union of the States was regularly established; and  
finally, to consult the Constitution of 1788, which  
is the oracle that must decide the important ques-  
tion.  
In the State prior to the Revolution, it is certain  
that the common law, under different limitations,  
ade a part of the colonial codes. But, whether  
it be understoed that the original colonists brought  
the law with them, or made it their law by adop­  
tion, it is equally certain, that it was the separate  
law of each colony within its respective limits, and  
was unknown to them, as a law pervading and  
eperating through the whole, as one socicty.  
It could not possibly be otherwise. The com-  
mon law was not the same in any two of the colo­  
nies; in some, the modifications were materiall  
and extensively different. There was no commen  
Legislature, by which a common will could be e­  
pressed in the form of a law; nor any common  
magistracy, by which such a law could be carried  
into practice. The will of each colony, alone and  
separately, had its organs for these purposes.  
This stage of our political history, furnishes no  
foothold for the patrons of this new doctrine.  
Did then the principles or operation of the great  
event which made the colonies independent States  
imply or introduced the common laws as the law of  
the Union?  
  
The fundamental principles of the Revolution  
was, that the colonies were co-ordinate members  
with each other, and with Great Britain; of an em­  
pire, united by a common Executive soverign, but  
not united by any common Legislative sovereign.  
The Legislative power was maintained to be as  
complete in each American Parliament, as in the  
British Parliament. And the royal prerogrative  
was in force in each colony, by virtue of its ac­  
knowledging the King for its Executive Magistrate,  
as it was in Great Britain, by virtue of a like ac­  
knowledgemet there. A denial of those principles  
by Great Britain, and the assertion of them by  
America produced the revolution.  
There was a time indeed, when an exception of  
  
the several component and cocqual parts of the eme  
pire, obtained a degree of acquiescence. The Brit­  
ish Parliament was allowed to regulate the trade  
with foreign nations, and between the different  
parts of the empire. This was however, mere  
practice without right, and contrary to the true the  
ory of the Constitution. The conveniency of some  
regulations, in both those cases, was apparent; and  
as there was no Legislature with power over the  
whole, nor any constitutional pre-eminence among  
the Legislatures of the several parts, it was natural  
for the legislature of that particular part which was  
the eldest and the largest, to assume this function,  
nd for the others to acquiesce it. This tacit ar-  
rangment was the less criticised, as the regulations  
established by the British Farliament operated in  
favor of that part of the empire which seemed to  
ear the principle share of the public burdens, and  
were regarded as an indemnification of its advances  
for the other parts. As long as this regulating pow  
er was confined to the two ebjects of conveniency  
and equity, it was not complained of, nor much  
enquired into. But, no sooner was it preverted to  
the selfish views of the party assuming it, than the  
injured parties began to feel and to reflect; and the  
moment the clain to a direct and indefinate power  
ingrafted on the precedent of the regulating power,  
the whole charm was dissolved, and every eye open-  
to the usurpation. The assertion by G. B. of a  
power to make laws for the other members of the  
empire in all cases whatsoerer, ended in the disco-  
ery that she had a right to make laws for them in  
no cases whatsoever.  
Such being the ground of our revolution, no sup-  
port nor color can be drawn from it, for the doc-  
trins that the common law is binding on these States  
as one society. The doctrine, on the contrary, is  
evidently repugnant to the fundamental principle  
of the revolution.  
The articles of confederation, are the next source  
of information on this subject.  
In the interval between the commencement of  
the revolution and the final ratification of these ar­  
ticles, the nature and extent of the Union was de-  
termined by the circumstances of the crisis, rather  
than by any accurate delineation of the general an­  
thority. It will not be alleged, that the &quot;common  
aw&quot; could have had any legitimate birth as a law  
of the U. S. during that state of things. If it came  
as such into existence at all, the charter of confed-  
ration must have heen its parent.  
Here again, however, its pretensions are abso-  
lutely destitute of soundation. This instrument  
loes not contain a sentence or syllable that can he  
tortured into a countenance of the idea, that the  
arties to it were, with respect to the objects of the  
common law, to form ene community. No such  
iw is named or implied, or alladed to, or being in  
force, or as brought inlo force by that compact.  
No provision is made by which such a law could  
be carried into operation: whilst, on the other band,  
cry such inference or pretext is absolutely pre­  
luded by article 2d, which declares, &quot;that each  
State retains its sovereignty, freedom and indepen­  
dence, and every power, jurisdiction and right,  
which is not by this confederation expressly dele-  
gated to the U. S., in Congress assembled.&quot;  
Thus far it appears, that not a vestige of this ex-  
traordinary doctrine can be found in the origin or  
progress of American institutions. The evidence  
gainst it has, on the contrary, grown stronger at  
very step, till it has amounted to a formal and  
positive exclusion, by written articles of compact  
among the parties concerned.  
Is this exclusion revoked, and the common law  
introduced as a national law, by the present Cone  
titution of the U.S.? This is the final question to  
be examined.  
It is readily admitted, that particular parts of the  
common law may have a sanction from the Consti­  
tution, so far as they are necessarily comprehend­  
ed in the technical phrases which express the pow­  
ers delegated to the Government; and so far also,  
as such other parts may be adopted by Congress as  
necessary and proper for carrying into execution  
the powers expressly delegated. But, the question  
oes not relate to either of these portions of the  
common law. It relates to the common law be-  
ond these limitations.  
The only part of the Constitution which seems  
to have been relied on in this case, is the 2d sect.  
of Art. I1I. &quot;The judicial power shall extend to  
all cases, in law and eqquity, arising under this  
Constitution, the laws of the U.S., and Treaties  
made or which shall be made under their author­  
t.  ha hesa astied wint cases, distinct fiem thes  
arising under the laws and treaties of the U.S.,  
can arise under the Constitution, other than those  
arising under the common law; and it is inferred,  
at the common law is accordingly adopted or re-  
cognized by the Constitution.  
Never, pethaps, was so broad a construction ap-  
lied to a text so clearly unsusceptible of it. If  
any color for the infereace could be found, it must  
be in the impossibility of finding any other cases in  
aw and equity, within the provision of the Consti-  
tution, to satisfy the expression; and rather than  
resort to a construction affecting so essentially the  
whole character of the Government, it would per-  
ips be more rational to consider the expression an  
mere pleonasm or inadvertency. But, it is net

necessary to decide on such a dilemma. The ex  
pression is fully satisfied, and its accuracy justified  
  
by two descriptions of cases, to which the Judicial  
  
asthority is extended, and neither of which implies  
  
that the common law is the law of the U. States.  
  
One of these descriptions comprehends the cases  
growing out of the restrictions on the Legislative  
  
power of the States. For example, it is provided  
that &quot;no State shall emit bills of credit,&quot; or make  
  
any thing but gold and silver coin a tender in pay-  
  
ment of debts.&quot; Should this prohibition be viola  
  
ted, and a suit betweeen citizens of the same Slate  
  
be the consequence, this would be a case arisin  
under the Constitution before the Jadicial power  
of the United States. A second description come  
  
prehends suits between citizens and foreigners, or  
citizens of different States, to be decided according  
to the State or foreign laws; but submitted by the  
Constitution to the Judicial power of the United  
States; the Judicial power being, in several instan­  
ces, extended beyond the Legislative power of the  
United States.  
To this explanation of the text, the following ob­  
servations may be added:  
This expression, &quot;cases in law and equity,&quot;  
manifestly confined to cases of a civil nature; and  
would exclude cases of criminal jurisdiction. Crim-  
  
inal cases in law and equity would be a language  
unknown to the law.  
The succeeding paragraph of the same section is  
in harmony with this construction. It is in these  
words: &quot;In all cases affecting Amhassadors, other  
public Ministers, and Consuls, and those in which  
a State shall be a party, the Supreme Court shall  
have original jurisdiction. In all the other cases  
including cases in law and equity arising under  
the Constitution! the Supreme Court shall have  
appellale jurisdiction both as to law and fact; with  
uch exceptions, and under such regulations, as  
Congress shall make.  
This paragraph, by expressly giving an appel-  
  
Jale jurisdiction, in cases of law and equity arisin  
  
under the constitution, to fact, as well as to law,  
  
clearly excludes criminal cases, where the trial by  
  
jury is secured; hecause the fact, in such cases, is  
not a subject of appeal. And, although the appeal  
  
is liable to such exceptions and regulations as Con­  
gress may adopt, yet it is not to be supposed that  
  
an exception of all criminal cases could be con  
  
templated; as well because a discretion in Con-  
  
ress to make or omit the exception would be im­  
proper, as because it would have been unnecessary.  
The exception could as easily have been made by  
the Constitution itself, as referred to the Congress.  
Once more; the amendment last added to the  
Constitution, deserves attention, as throwing light  
on this subject. &quot;The Judicial power of the U.  
States shall not be construed to extend to any suit  
in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against  
one of the United States, by citizens of another  
State, or by citizens or subjects of any foreign  
power.&quot; As it will not be pretended that any  
criminal proceeding could take place against a  
State; the terms law or equily, must be understood  
as appropriate to ciril, in exclusion of criminal  
From these considerations, it is evident, that this  
part of the Constitution, even if it could be applied  
  
t all, to the purpose for which it had been cited,  
would not include any cases whatever of a crimi­  
nal nature; and consequently, would not authorize  
the inference from it, that the Judicial authority  
extends to offences against the common law, as of­  
fences arising under the Constitution.  
It is further to he considered, that even if thi  
part of the Constitution could be strained into an  
application to every commion law case, criminal a  
  
well as civil, it could have no effect in justifying  
  
the Sedition Act; which is an exercise of Legisla  
tive, and not of Judicial power; and it is the Ju  
  
dicial power only of which the extent is defined in  
  
this part of the Constitution.  
To be continued.)

great importance and deserving attention.

3 ToFFICE on CourT Street, over the Post Office.  
THE OLD LANDMARKS.  
MADISON&#x27;S REPORt.  
(Concluded.  
There are two passages in the Constitution, in  
hich a description of the laws of the U.S is found.  
The first is contained in Art. H1, see, 2, in the  
words following: &quot;This Constitution, the laws of  
the U. S., and treaties made, or which shall be  
made ander their authority.&quot; The second is con­  
tained in the 2d paragraph of Art. VI., as follow  
&quot;This Constitution and the laws of the U.8., which  
shall be made in pursuance thereof, and all treatie  
made, or which shall be made, under the authorit  
of the U. S., shall he the supreme law of the land.&quot;  
The first of these descriptions was meant as a guide  
to the Judges of the U. S.; the second, as a guide  
to the Judges in the several States. Both of them  
consist of an enumeration, which was evidentl  
meant to be precise and complete. If the com­  
mon law hid been understood to be a law of the  
U. S., it is not possible to assign a satisfactory rea­  
son why it was not expressed in the enumeration.  
In aid of these objections, the difficulties and  
confusion inseparable from a constructive introduc­  
tion of the common law, would afford powerful  
reasons agninst it.  
Is it to he the common law with, or without the  
British Statutes?  
If without the statutory amendments, the vice,  
of the code would be insupportable!  
If with these amendments, what period is to he­  
fixed for limiting the British authority over our  
laws?  
Is it to be the date of the eldest or the youngest  
of the Colonies  
Or are the dates to be thrown together, and a me­  
dium decided?  
Or is our independence to be taken for the date?  
Is, again, regard to be had to the various chan-  
ges in the common law made by the local codes of  
America?  
Is regard to be had to such changes, subsequent,  
is well as prior, to the establishment of the Con­  
stitution?  
Is regard to be had to future, as well as past  
Is the law to be different in every State, as dif.  
ferently modified by its code; or are the modifica­  
tions of any particular State, to be applied to all?  
And on the latter supposition, which among the  
State codes would form the standard?  
Questions of this sort might be multiplied with  
as much ease, as there would be difficuby in an­  
swering them.  
The consequences flowing from the proposed  
construction, furnish other objections equally con­  
clusive; unless the text were perempiory in its  
meaning, and consistent with other parts of the in­  
T hest consequences may be in relation to the  
Legislative authority of the U.S.; to the Executive  
authority; to the Judicial authority, and to the  
Governments of the several States.  
If it he understood, that the common law is e­  
tablished by the Constitution, it foliows that no  
part of the law can be altered by the Legislature;  
such of the statutes, already passed, as may be r­  
pugnant thereto, would be multiplied; particnlarly  
the &quot;Sedition Act&quot; itself, which boasts of being a  
melioration of the commion law; and the whole  
code, with all its incongruities, barbarisms, and  
bloody maxims, would be inviolably saddled on  
the good people of th  
Should this consequence be rejected, and the  
  
common law be held, like other laws, lible to re oe in ae o ti eon i ta o ­  
vision and alteration, by the authority of Congress, presing insurrection;&quot; which is said to imply a  
it then follows, that the anthority of Congress is cooer to e ieion be unin wa  
  
extensive with the objects of common law; that is  
to say, with every object of legislation: For, to  
every such object, does some branch or other of  
the commion law extend. The authority of Con  
gress would, therefore, be no longer under the limi-  
tations, marked ant in the Constitution. They  
would be authorised to legislate in all cases what  
soever.  
In the next place, as the President possesses the  
executive powers of the Constitution, and is to see  
  e o  eeee e e e  
thal the laws be lannfully eeeuled, his authorly  
also must be co-extensive with every branch of the  
common law. The additions which this would  
make to his power, though not readily to be esti-  
mated, claim the most serious attention.  
This is not all; it will merit the most profonnd  
consideration, how far an indefinite admission of  
the common law, with a latitude in construing it,  
equal to the construction by which it is deduced  
from the Constitution, might draw after it the va­  
rious prerogatives making part of the unwritten law  
of England. The English Constitution itself is  
nothing more than a composition of unwritten law  
and maxims.  
In the third place, whether the common law be  
admitted as of fegal or of constitutional obligation,  
it would confer on the Judicial department a dis­  
cretion little short of Legislative power.  
On the supposition of its having a constitutional  
obligation, this power in the Judges would be per-  
manent and irremediable by the Legislature. On  
the other supposition, the power would not expire,  
until the Legislature should have introduced a full  
  
system of statutory provisions. Let it be observed,  
too, that besides all the uncertainties above enn­  
merated, and which present an immense field for  
judicial discretion, it would remain with the same  
department to decide what parts of the common  
law would, and what would not, be properly ap­  
plicable to the circumstances of the U.S.  
A discretion of this sort has always been lament­  
ed as incongruous and dangerous, even in the Co-  
  
lonial and State courts; although so much narrow­  
ed by positive provisions in the local codes on all  
the principal subjects embraced by the common  
law. Under the U.S., where so few laws exist on  
those subjects, and where so great a lapse of time  
must happen hefore the vast chasm could be sup­  
plied, it is manifest that the power of the Judges  
over the law would, in fact, erect them into Legis-  
lators; and that for a long time, it would be im-  
possible for the citizens to conjecture, either what  
was, or would he law.  
In the last place, the consequence of admittin  
the common law as the law of the U. States, on the  
authority of the individual States, is as obvious as  
it would be fatal. As this law relates to every  
subject of Legislation, and would be paramount to  
the Constitutions and laws of the States; the ad­  
mission of it would overwhelm the residuary sov­  
creignty of the States, and by one constructive  
operation, new-model the whole political fabric of  
the country  
From the review thus taken of the situation of  
the American colonies prior to their Independen  
of the effect of this event on their situation; of the  
nature and import of the articles of confederation;  
of the true meaning of the passage in the existing  
Constitution from which the commion law has been  
deduced; of the difficulties and uncertainties inci  
dent to the doctrine and of its vast consequences in  
extending the powers of the Federal Government,  
and in superceding the authorities of the State Gov-  
ernments; the committee feel the utmost confidence  
in concluding, that the common law never was, nor  
by any fair construction, ever can be, deemed a  
law for the Anierican people as one community;  
and they indulge the strengest expectation that the  
same conclusion will finally be drawn, by all can­  
did and accurate enquirers into the subject. It is,  
indeed, distressing to reflect, that it ever should  
have been made a question, whether the Constitu­  
tion, on the whole face of which is seen so much  
labor to enumerate and define the several object  
of Federal power, could intend to introduce in the  
lump, in an indirect manner, and by a forced con-  
struction of a few phrases, the vast and multifari­  
ous jurisdiction involved in the commion law; a law  
filling so many ample volumes; a law overspread­  
ing the entire field of Legislation; and a law that  
would sap the foundation of the Censtitution as a  
system of limited and specified powers. A severer  
reproach could not in the epinion of the committee  
he thrown on the Constitution on those who framed,  
or on those who established it, than such a suppo­  
ition would throw on them.  
The argument, then, drawn from the common  
law, on the ground of its being adopted or reco­  
nized by the Constitution, being inapplicable to the  
Sedition Act, the committee will proceed to exam-  
ine the other arguments which have been founded  
on the Constitution.  
They will waste but little time on the attempt to  
cover the act by the meamble to the Constitution.  
it being contrary to every acknowledged rule of  
construction, to set up this part of an instrument,  
in opposition to the plain meaning, expressed in the  
body of the instrument. A preamble usually con-  
tains the general motives or reasons, for the par  
ticular regulations or measures which follow it;  
and is always understood to he explained and limi-  
ted by them. In the present instance, a contrary  
interpretation would have the inadmissible effect.  
of rendering nugatory or improper, every part of  
the Constitution which succeeds the preamibl  
The paragraph in Art. I, sec. 8, which contains  
the power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts,  
and excises; to pay the debts, and provide for the  
common defence and general welfare, having been  
already examined, will also require no particular  
attention in this place. It will have been seen that  
in its fair and consistent meaning, it cannot enlarge  
the enumerated powers vested in Congress.  
The part of the Constitution which seems most  
to he recurred to, in defence of the &quot;Sedition Act,&quot;  
is the last clause of the above section, empowerin  
Congress &quot;to make all laws which shall be neces  
ary and proper for carrying into execution the  
foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by  
this Constitution in the Government of the U.S.,  
or in any department or officer thereef.&quot;  
The plain import of this clause is, that Congre  
shall have all the incidental or instrumental power  
necessary and proper for carrying into execution  
all the express powers; whether they be vested in  
the Government of the U.S., more collectively, or  
in the several departments, or officers thereof. It  
is not a grant of new powers to Congress, but  
merely a declaration, for the removal of all uncer-  
tainty, that the means of carrying into execution,  
those otherwise granted, are included in the grant.  
Whenever, therefore, a question arises concern­  
ing the Constitutionality of a particular power, the  
first question is, whether the power be expressed  
in the Constitution. If it be, the question is deci-  
ded. If it be not expressed, the next enquiry must  
be, whether it is properly an incident to an express  
power, and necessary to its execution. If it be, it  
may be exercised by Congress. If it be not, Con­  
gress cannot exercise it.  
Let the question be asked, then, whether the  
power over the press exercised in the &quot;Sedition  
Act,&quot; be found among the powers expressly vested  
in the Congress? This is not pretended.  
Is there any express power, for executing which,  
it is a necessary and proper power?  
The power which has been selected, as least re-  
ever may lead or lend to them. But, it surely  
cannot, with the least plansibility, be said, that a  
regulation of the press, and a punishment of libels,  
are exercises of a power to suppress insurrections.  
The most that could he said, would be, that the  
punishment of libels, if it had the tendency ascribed  
to it, might prevent the occasion of passing or ex-  
ecuting laws necessary and proper for the suppres-  
sion of insurrections.  
Has the Federal Government no power, then, to  
it  to att  ttetee to the tat  
pretunt as weh as to punish resistance to tie s  
They nave the power, which the Constitution  
deemed most proper, in their hands for the purpose.  
The Congress has power, before it happens, to pass  
laws for punishing it; and the Executive and Ju-  
diciary have power to enforce those laws when it  
does happen.  
It must be recollected by many, and could be  
shown to the satisfaction of all, that the construc­  
tion here put on the terms &quot;necessary and proper,&quot;  
is precisely the construction which prevailed durin  
the discussions and ratifications of the Constitution.  
It may be added, and cannot too often be repeated,  
that it is a construction absolutely necessary to  
maintain their consistency with the peculiar charac­  
ter of the Government, as possessed of particular  
and defined powers only; not of the general and  
indefinite powers vested in ordinary governments.  
For, if the power to suppress insurrections, in­  
cludes a power to punish libels; or if the power  
to punish, includes a power to prerent, by all  
the means that may have that lendency, such is the  
relation and influence among the most remote sub-  
  
jects of legislation, that a power over a very few,  
would carry with it a power over all. And it must  
be wholly immaterial, whether unlimited powers  
he exercised under the name of unlimited powers,  
or be exercised ander the name of unlimited means  
of carrying into execution limited powers.  
This branch of the subject will be closed with a  
reflection which must have weight with all; but  
more especially with those who place peculiar re­  
liance on the judicial exposition of the Constitution,  
as the bulwark provided against undue extensions  
of the Legislative power. If it be understood that  
the powers implied in the specified powers, have  
  
an immediate and apprepriate relation to them, as  
means, necessary and proper for carrying them into  
execution, questions on the Constitutionality of laws  
passed for this purpose, will be of a nafure sufe  
ficiently precise and determinate for Judicial cog-  
hisance and control! H, on the other hand, Con­  
gress are not limited in the choice of means by any  
such appropriate relation of them to the specified  
powers; but may employ all such means as they  
may deem fitted to prerenl, as well as to punish,  
crimes subjected to their authority; such as may  
have a tendency only to promole an ohject for  
which they are authorised to provide; every one  
must perceive, that questions relating to means of  
this sort must be questions of mere policy and er­  
pediency; on which, legislative discretion alone  
can decide, and from which the judicial interposi­  
tion and contrel are completely excluded.  
2. The next point which the resolution requires  
to be proved, is, that the power over the press ex-  
ercised by the Sedition Act, is positively forhidden  
by one of the amendments to the Constitution.  
The amendment stands in these words- &quot;Con­  
gress shall make no law respecting an establish­  
ment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise  
thereof, or abrindging the freedom of speech or of  
the press; or the risht of the people peaceably to  
assemble, and to petition the Government for a re-  
dress of grievances.  
In the attempts to vindicate the &quot;edition Act,&quot;  
it has heen contended, 1. That the &quot;freedom of  
the press&quot; is to be determined by the meaning of  
these terms in the commion law. 2. That the ar­  
ticle supposes the power over the press to he in  
Congress, and prohibits them only from abridging  
the freedom allowed to it by the common law.  
Although it will be shewn, in examining the  
second of these positions, that the amendment is a  
enial to Congress of all power over the press, it  
my hot be arcless to make the following observa  
the first of them.  
It is deemed to he a sound opinion, that the Se-  
dition Act, in its delinition of some of the crimes  
created, is an abridgment of the freedom of publi­  
cation, recognized by principles of the common law  
in Lingland.  
The freedom of the press under the common law,  
is, in the defences of the Sedition Act, made to  
consist in an exemption from all preriogs restraint  
on printed publications, by persons authorised to  
inspect and prohibit them. I appears to the Com­  
mittee, that this idea of the freedom of the pri  
in never be admitted to be the American idea of  
it: since a law inflicting penalties on printed puh-  
cations, would have a similar effect with a law  
anthorising a previous restraint on them. If would  
seem a mockery to say, that no law should he pass-  
ed, preventing publications from being miade, hut  
that laws might he passed for punishing them in  
case they should be made.  
The essential difference between the British Go­  
ernment and the American Constitutions, will place  
this subject in the clearest light.  
In the British Government, the danger of en­  
croachments on the rights of the People, is under­  
stood to he confined to the Executive Magistrate.  
The representatives of the People in the Legisla­  
ture, are not only exenpt themselves, from distrust,  
hut are considered as sufficient guardians of the  
rights of their constituents against the danger from  
the Executive. Hence it is a principle, that the  
Parliament is unlimited in its power; or, in their  
own language, is omnipotent. Hence too, all the  
ramparts for protecting the rights of the c&#x27;eople,  
such as their Magna Charta, their Bill of Rights,  
&amp;c., are not reared against the Parliament, but  
against the royal prerogative. They are merely  
Legislative precautions, agaiust Executive usurpa­  
tions. Under such a Government as this, an e­  
emption of the press from previous restraint by  
licensers appointed by the King, is all the freedom  
that can he secured to it.  
In the P.S. the case is altogether different.  
The people not the Government, possess the abso­  
lute sovereignty. The Legislature, no less than  
the Executive, is under limitations of power. En­  
croachments are regarded as passible from the one,  
as well as from the other. Hence in the U.S., the  
great and essential rights of the people are secured,  
against Legislative as well as against Executive  
ambition. They are secured not by laws para­  
mount to prerogative, hut by Constitutions parn-  
mount to laws. This security of the freedom of  
the press requires, that it should be exempt, not  
only from previous restraint by the Executive, as  
in Great Britain; but from Legislative restraint al­  
o; and this exemption, to he effectual, must he an  
exemption, not only from the previous inspection  
of licensers but, from the subsequent penalty of the  
laws.  
The state of the press, therefore, under the com­  
mon law, tannol in thi point of view, be the stanr  
of its freedom in the U.  
But there is another view, under which it may  
be necessary to consider this subject. It may be  
alleged, that although the security for the freedom  
of the press, be different in Great Britain and in  
this country; being a legal security only in the  
former, and a constitutional security in the latter;  
and although there may be a further disference, in  
an extension of the freedom of the press here, be-  
yond an avemntion from urevions restraint, to an  
exemntion from subseauent penalties also, yet that  
the actual legal freedom of the press, under the  
common law, must determine the degree of free-  
dom, which is meant by the terms, and which i  
onstitutionally secured against both previous and  
subsequent restraints.  
The Commiitee are not unaware of the difficulfy  
of all general questions, which may turn on the  
proper boundary befween the liberty and hicenlious-  
ness of the press. They will leave it therefore for  
consideration only, how far the difference between  
the nature of the British Government, and the na­  
ture of the American Governments, and the prac-  
tice under the latter, may shew the degree of rigor  
in the former, to be inapplicable to, and not obli­  
gatory in the latter.  
The nature of Governments elective, limited and  
responsible, in all their branches, may well be sup­  
posed to require a greater freedom of animadver­  
sion, than might be tolerated by the genius of such  
a Government as that of Great Britain. In the lat-  
ter, it is a maxim, that the king, an hereditary, not  
a responsible magistrate, can do no wrong; and  
that the Legislature, which in two-thirds of its com­  
position is also hereditary, not responsibfd, can do  
what it pleases. In the U.S. the Executive ma­  
gistrates are not held to be infallible, nor the Leg­  
islatures to be omnipotent; and both being elective,  
are both responsible. Is it not natural and neces-  
ary, under such different circumstances, that a  
difierent degree of freedom, in the use of the press,  
should be coniemplated?,  
e  a o o eee eee e oo  
Is not such an mierence lavored by what is on­  
ervable in Great Britain itself? Notwithstandin  
the general doctrine of the common law, on the  
  
subject of the press, and the occasional punishment  
of those, who use it with a freedom offensive to the  
  
Government; it is well known, that with respect  
to the responsible members of the Government,  
where the reasons operating here, hecome applica-  
there, the freedom exercised by the press, and  
  
profected by the public opinion, far exceeds theist that any power over the pres was delegated by  
limits presctibed by the ordinary rules of law.he contituton as proposing next, that an amend­  
The ministry, who are responsible to impeachment, ment to it, should explicitly declare that no such  
are at all times, animadverted on, by the press,oer a eete an iaa oneiin  
  
with peculiar freedom; and during the elections  
for the House of Commons, the other responsible,  
part of the Government, the press is employed with  
as little reserve towards the candidates,  
The practice in America must he entitled to much  
eire respect. In eveay State, probably in the  
Union, the press has exerted a freedom in canva­  
ing the merits and measures of public men, of every  
description, which has not heen confined to the  
striet limits of the common law. On this footing,  
the freedom of the press has stood; on this footin  
it yet stands. And it will not be a breach, either  
of truth or of candor, to say, that no persons or  
presses are in the habit of more unrestramed an  
madversions on the proceedings and functionaries  
of the State Governments, than the persons and  
presses most zealous in vindicating the act of Con-  
ress for punishing similar animadversions on the  
Government of the United States.  
The last remark will not be understood, as claim  
ing for the State Governments, an immunity grea-  
ter than they have heretofore enjoved. Some de  
gree of abuse is inseparable from the proper use of  
every thing; and in no instance is this more true.  
than in that of the press. It has accordingly been  
decided by the practice of the States, that it is better  
to leave a lew of its noxious branches, to their lur­  
uriant growth, than be pruning them away, to in­  
jure the vigor of those yielding the proper frnits.  
And can the wisdom of this policy be doubted by  
any who reflect, than to the press alone, chequred  
as it is with abuses, the world is indedted for all  
the triun phs which have been gained by reason and  
humanity, over error and oppression; who reflect,  
that to the same beneficent source, the 1.S. owe  
much of the lights which conducted them to the  
rank of a free and independent natien; and which  
have improved their political system, into a shape  
so suspicious to their happiness. Had &quot;Sedition  
Acts,&quot; forbidding every publication that might  
bring the constituted agents into contempt or dis­  
repute, or that might excite the hatred of the peo­  
ple against the authors of unjust or pernicious meas­  
ures, been uniformly enforced against the press,  
might net the U.S, have been languishing at thi  
day, ander the infirmities of a sickly confederation?  
Might they not possibly be miserable colonies,  
groaning under a foreign yoke?  
To these chservations, one fact will he added,  
which demonstrates that the commen law cannot he  
admitted as the unirersal expositor of Ameriean  
terms, which may be the same with those contained  
in that law. The freedom of conscience, and of  
religion, are found in the same instruments, which  
assert the freedom of the press. It will never he  
admitted, that the meaning of the former, in the  
common law of Ingland, is to limit their meaning  
in the U.  
Whatever weight may be allowed to these con­  
iderations, the committee do not, however, by any  
means intend to rest the question on them. They  
contend that the article of amendment, instead of  
shppuing in tonaea a pawar that might be exe  
over that press, provided its frectiom wng  
not ahridgc-was iicant as a positie denial to Cone  
of any power whatever on the subject.  
To demonstrate that this was the true subject of  
the article, it will be sufficient to recall the circum­  
stances which led to it, and to refer to the explana­  
tion accompanying the article.  
When the Constitution was under the discussions  
which preceded its ratification, it is well known, that  
great apprehensions were expressed by many, lest  
the omission of some positive exception from the  
powers delegated, of certain rights, and of the free-  
dom of the press particularly, might expose them  
to the danger of being drawn by construction with­  
in some of the powers vested in Congressimore e­  
pecially of the power to make all laws necessary and  
proper for carry ing their other powers into execu­  
tion. In reply to this objection, it was invariably  
urged to be a fundamental and characteristic princi­  
ple of the Constitution, that all powers not given by  
it were reserved that no powers were given beyond  
those enumerated in the Constitution, and such a  
were fairly incident in them; that the power over  
the rights in question, and particularly over the  
press, was neither among the enumated powers,  
hor incident to any of them, and consequently that  
an exercise of any such power, would be a manl­  
fost usurpation. It is painful to remark, how much  
the arguments now employed in behalf of the sle-  
dition Act, are at variance with the reasoning which  
then justified the Constitution, and invited its rat­  
tieuti. &quot; posture of thesiljort, resikted the in­  
teresting question in so many of the Conventions,  
whether the doubts and dangers ascribed to the  
Constitution, should he removed by any amend­  
ments previons to the ratification, or be postponed,  
in confidence that as far as they might be proper,  
they would be introduced in the form provided b  
the Constitution. The latter course was adepted:  
and in most of the States, the ratifications were fol-  
lowed by propositions and instructions for render­  
ing the Constitution more explicit, and more safe to  
the rights, not meant to be delegated by it. Among  
thuse rishts, the frerdom of the press, in mot ie  
es, is particulary and emphatically mentioned.  
The firm and very pointed manner, in which it i  
asserted in the proceedings of the Convention of  
this State, will be herealter seen.  
In pursuance of the wishes thus expressed, the  
first Congress that assembled under the Constitu-  
tion, preposed certain amendments,  
osed certain amendments, which have  
since, hy the necessary ratifications, been minde a  
part of it; among which amendments, is the article  
containing other prohibitions on the Congress, an  
express declaration that they should make no law  
abridging the freedom of the press.  
ithout tracing farther evidence on this suhject,  
it would seem scarcely possible to doubt, that no  
r whatever over the press, was supposed to be  
  
lelegated by the Constitution, as it originally stood;  
and that the amendment was intended as a posi­  
itive and absolute reservation of it.  
But the exidence is still strenger. The prope  
of amendments made by Congress, is intre­  
duced in the following terms: &quot;The Corention  
of a number of the Stales haring at the lime of  
their alopting of the Constitulion, cxpressed a  
desire, in order to prerent mixconstructions or  
abese of ils powers, thal furiher decluratory and  
resdriciire clanses should be abled, and as erten­  
ding the tround of public confidence in the Gor­  
erament, will best ensare the bencficenl ends of its  
institutions.&quot;  
Here is the most satisfactory and authentic proof,  
that the several amendments proposed, were to be  
considered as either declaratory or restrictive; and  
whether the one or the other, as corresponding  
with the desire expressed by a number of the  
States, and as extending the ground of public con­  
fidence in the Government.  
Under any other construction of the amendment  
relating to the press, then that it declared the pres  
to be wholly exempt from the power of Congress,  
the amendment could neither be said to correspond  
with the desire expressed by a number of the States,  
  
nor he calculated to extend the ground of public  
confidence in the Government.  
Nay, more; the construction employed to justify  
the &quot;Sedition Act,&quot; would exhibit a phenomenon,  
without a paralled in the political world. It would  
  
exhibit a number of respectable States, as denving  
an amendment actually recognizing or delegating  
aguend power.  
Is then the Iederal Government, it will he asked,  
destitnte of every authority fur restraining the e  
entiousness of the press, and for shielding itselfae  
the libellous attacks which may be made on  
those who administer it?  
The Constitution alone can answer this question.  
If no such power be expressly delegated, and it be  
not hoth necessary and proper to carry into exeen-  
tion an express power; above all, if it be expressly  
forhidden by a declaratory amendment to the Con-  
stitution, the answer must be, that the Pederal Goy­  
ernment is destitute of all such authority.  
And might it not be asked in turn, whether it is  
not more probable, under all the circumstances  
which have been reviewed, that the authority  
should be withheld by the Constitution, than that  
it should he left to a vague and violent construe-  
tion; whilst so much pains were bestowed in en-  
umerating other powers, and so many less impor­  
tant powers are incleded in the enumeration?  
Might it not be likewise asked, whether the an­  
ious circunspection which dictated so many peeg­  
lar limitations on the general authority, would be  
unlikely to exempt the press altogether from that  
authority? The peculiar magnitude of some of the  
powers necessarily committed to the Federal Go­  
ernment; the peculiar duration required for the fune­  
tions of some of iis depariments, the per uliardis  
of the seat of its proceedings frem the great  
bady of its constituents; and the peenliar difliculty  
of circulating an adequate knowledge of them  
through any other channel; will not the censidera­  
tions, seme or other of them produced other excep-  
tions from the powers of ordinary Governments, all  
together, account for the policy of binding the hand  
of the F&#x27;ederal Government, from touchin, the chan-  
nel which alone can give efliency to its responsibil-  
ity to iis cons itue nist and of leavins those whoa  
it, no remedy for their injured reputations,  
under the same laws, and in the same tribunals,  
which protect their lives, their liberties, and their  
propertics?  
But the question does not turn either on the wis-  
lom of the Constitution or on the policy which gave  
rise to its particular organization. It turas on the  
actual meaning of the instrument; hy which it has  
appeared, that a power over the press is ciearly ey-  
cluded; from the numder of powvers delegated to the  
Federal Government.  
And in the opinion of the Comnittee, we&#x27;l  
may it he said as the resolution concludes with say­  
ing, that the unconstitutional power exercised over  
the press by the &quot;reditien Act,&quot; onght &quot;more  
than any other, to produce universal alarm; be­  
canse it is levelled against that right of freely ex-  
amining public characters and measures and of free  
communication among the people thereon, which  
has ever been justly deemed the only effectual guar­  
dian of every other right.&quot;  
Withont serutinizin minutely into all the pro­  
ision of the &quot;pedition Act,&quot; it will be suflicient  
to eite so much of section 2, as follows: &quot;And he  
it further enacted, that if any person shall write,  
print, utter or publish, or shall cause or procure to  
be written, printed, uttered or published, or shall  
knowingly and willingly assist or aid in writing,  
printing, uttering or publishing any false seandalous  
and malicious writing or writings against the tio­  
ernment of the U.S., or either House of the Con­  
gress of the U. States, or the President of the Uni­  
ted States, with an intent to defume the said tur­  
ernment, or either Hlouse of the said Congress, or  
the Presideal, or to bring them, or either of them,  
inlo conlempt or disrepute; or lo ercile ugul  
them, or either, or any of them, the haltel of the  
good people of the Unitet Shates, we. Then such  
person being thereof conricled before uny Cour!  
of the Uaitel Slalea, haring juritiction thereef,  
shall be punished hya fine not ereee ling two thou­  
sand dollurs, and by imprisonment nof erceeding  
two years.&quot;  
On this part of the act, the following observations  
present themselves;  
I. The Constitution supposes that the President,  
the Congress, and each of its Houses, may not di­  
charge their trusts, either from defect of judgment,  
or other causes. Hence, they are all made re­  
ponsible to their constituents, at the returning p  
riods of election; and the President, who is singly  
entrusted with very greal powers, is, as a further  
guard, subjected to an intermediate impeachment.  
chould it happen, as the Constitution suppos-  
es it may haupen, that either of these brauclis of  
the Government may not have duly disscharged its  
trust; it is natural and propet, that according to  
the cause and degree of their saults, they should he  
brought into contempt of disrepute, and meur the  
hatred of the people.  
3. Whether it has, in any case, happened that  
the proceedings of either or all of those branches,  
evinces such a violation of duty as to justify a con­  
tempt, a disrepute or hatred among the people, can  
only be determined by a free examination thereof,  
and a free communication among the people there­  
L. Whenever it may have actually happened,  
that proceedings of this sort are chargeable on all  
or either of the branches of the Government, it is  
the duty as well as the right of intelligent and fhith­  
ful citizens, to discuss and promulge them freely,  
as well as to control them by a censorship of the  
public opinion, as to promote a remedy according  
to the rules of the Constitution. And it cannot he  
avoided, that those who are to apply the remedy  
must feel, in some degree, a contempt or hatred  
against the transgressing party.  
3. As the act was passed on July 14, 1793, and  
is to be in force until March 3, 1801, it was of  
course, that during its continuance, two clections  
of the entire House of Representatives, an cicetion  
of a part of the Senate, and an election of a Fresl­  
dent were to take place.  
6. That censequently during all these elections,  
intended by the Constifution to preserve the purity.  
er to purge the fanlts of the administration, th  
great remcifinl rights of the pepyle wre in bee  
and the re ponsibility of their public agents  
to be screened, under the penalties of this net.  
May it notso nsked of every intelligent friend to  
the liberties of his country, whether the power ex  
ercised in such an act as this, ought not to produce  
great and universal alarm? Whether a rigid ex-  
ecution of such an act, in time past, would not  
have repassed that information and communication  
among the peeple, which is indispensable to the  
just exercise of their electoral rights? And wheth  
er such an fet, if made perpetual, and enforced  
with rigor, would not in time to come, either des  
troy our free system of Government, or prepare a  
convulsion that might prove equally lalal to it?  
In answer to such questions, it has been pleaded  
that the writings and publications ferbidden by the  
act, are those only which are false and malicious,  
and intended to defame; and mierit is claimed for  
the privilege allowed to anthors to justify, by prov­  
ing the truth of their publications, or for the limit­  
ations to which the sentence of fine and imprison­  
ment is subjected.  
  
To those who concurred in the act, under the  
extraordmnary belief, that the option lay between  
the passing of such an act, and leaving in force the  
common law of libels, which punishes truth equal­  
ly with falss hood; and submits the fine and ime  
to the indefinite discretion of the court,  
the merit of good intentions ought surely not to be  
refused. A like merit may perhaps be due for the  
discontinuance of the corporal panishment, which  
the common law also leaves to the discretion of the  
court. This merit of ialention, however, would  
  
have heen greater, if the several mitigations had  
not been limited to so short a period; and the ap­  
parent inconsistency would have heen avoided, be­  
tween justifying the act at one time, by contrasting  
it with the rigors of the common law, otherwise in  
lorce; and at another time by appealing to the na­  
ture of the crisis, as requiting the temporary rigor  
exerted by the act.  
But, whatever may have been the meritorious  
intentions of all or any who contributed to the Se­  
dition Act, a very few reflections will prove, that  
its haneful tendency is little diminished by the priv­  
ilege of giving in evidence the truth of the matter  
contained in political writings.  
In the first place, where simple and naked facts  
alone are in question, there is sufficient difficulty in  
some cases, sufficient trouble and vexation in all,  
of meeting a prosecution from the Government, with  
the full and formal proof, necessary in a Court of  
lnw.  
Fnt, in the nest place, it must he obvious to the  
plainest minds, that opinions, and inferences, and  
conjectaral observetions, are not only in many cae  
inseperable from the facts, but may often be  
more the ohjects of the prosecution than the facts  
themselves; or may even he altegether abstracted  
from particnlar facts; and that opinions and infer­  
ences, and cenjectural ohservations, cannot be sub­  
jects of that kind of proof which appertains to facts  
before a Court of Law.  
Again: It is no less obvlors, that the intent to  
defame or bring into contenpt or disrepute, or ha­  
tred, which is made a condition of the offence cre­  
ated by the act, cannot prevent its pernicions influ­  
ence, on the freedom of the press. Ior, omitting  
the enquiry, how far the malice of the intent is an  
inference of the law from the mere publication; it  
is manifestly impossible to punish the intent to  
bring these who administer the Government into  
disrepute or contempt, without striking at the right  
of freely discuseing public characters and measures:  
hecause these who engage in such discussions, must  
expect and Iten! to eveite these unfavorable sent­  
iments, so far as they may be thought to be deserv­  
ed. To prehibit, therefore, the intent to excite  
thase unfavorabte sentiments against those who ad­  
minister the Government, is equivalent to a prehi­  
bition of the acthal exeltement of them; and to  
prohil it the actual exeitement of them, is equiva­  
lent to a prohil ition of discuslong having that ten-  
dency and effect; which, again, is equivalent to a  
protection of those who ads ind ter the Government,  
if they should at any time deserve the contempt or  
hatred of the people, inst being exposed to it,  
by free animadver ions on their chatacters and con­  
duct. Nor can there be a doubt, if those in public  
trust he shielded by penal laws frem such stricture.  
of the press, as may expose them to contempt or  
dicrepute, or hatred, where they may deserve it,  
that in exact proportion as they may deserve to be  
esposed, will ba the certainty and criminality of  
the intent to expose them and the vigilance of pros­  
ecuting and punishing it; nor a doubt, that a tov­  
ernment thus intrenched in penal statutes, against  
the just and natural effects of a culpable adminis­  
tration, will easily evade the responsibility, which  
is essential to a faithful discharge of its duty.  
Let it be recollected, lastly, that the right of  
electing the members of the Government, constitutes  
mere particularly the essence of a free and respon­  
ible government. The value and efficacy of this  
right, depends on the knowledge of the compara­  
tive merits and demerits of the candidates for pub­  
lic trust; and on the equal freedom, consequently,  
of examining and disenssing these merits and de­  
merits of the candidates re-pectively. It has been  
seen, that a number of important elections will  
take place whilst the act is in force; although it  
should not be continned beyend the term to which  
it is limited. Should there happen, then, as is e­  
tremely probable in relation to some or other of  
these branches of the Government, to the competi­  
tions between those who are, and those who are  
not, members of the Government, what will be the  
situations of the competitors? Not equal; be­  
canse the characters of the former will he covered  
by the &quot;Sediion Act&quot; frem animadversions expos-  
ing them to disrepute among the people; whilst  
the latter may be exposed to the contempt of the  
people, withont a violation of the act. What will  
be the situation of the people? Not free; be-  
canse they will he compelled to make their elect-  
between competitors whose pretensions they  
re not permitted by the act, equally to examine,  
to disenss, and to ascertain. And from both these  
situations, will not these in power derive an undue  
advantage for centinaing theinselves in it; which  
by impairing the right of election, endangers the  
blessings of the Government founded on it?  
It is with justice, therefore, that the General  
Assembly have aflirmed in the resolution, as well  
that the right of freely examining public characters  
and measures, and of free conmiunication thereon,  
is the enly effectual guardian of every other right,  
as that this particulur right is levelled at, by the  
power exercised in the &quot;Sedition Act.&quot;  
The resolution next in order is as follows:

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

cannot be cancelled, abrilged, restrained or modi­  
fied by any authority of the United States.&quot;  
Here is an express and solemn declaration by the  
Convention of the State, that they ratified the Con­  
stitution in the sense, that no right of any denomi­  
nation can be cancelled, abridged, restrained or  
modified by the Government of the U.S, or any  
part of it; except in those instances in which pow­  
er is given by the Constitution;and in the sense par­  
ticularly, &quot;that among other essential rights, the  
liberty of conscience and freedom of the press can­  
not be cancelled, abridged, restrained or modified,  
by any authority of the U.S.&quot;  
Words could not well express, in a fuller or more  
forcible manner, the understanding of the Conven­  
tion, that the fiberty of conscience and the freedom  
of the press, were equally and completely exemp­  
ted from all authorits whatever of the U.S.  
Under an anxiety to guard more effectually these  
rights against every possible danger, the Conven­  
tion, after ratifying the Constitution, proceeded to  
prefix to certain amendments proposed by them, a  
declaration of rights, in which are two articles pro­  
viding, the one for the liberty of conscience, the  
other for the freedom of speech and of the press.  
Similar recommendations having proceeded from  
a number of other States, and Congress, as has  
been seen, having in consequence thereof, and with  
  
a view to extend the ground of public cofidence,  
proposed, among other declaratory and restrictive  
  
clauses, a clause expressly securing the liberty of  
  
conscience and of the press; and Virginia havin  
  
concurred in the ratifications which made them  
part of the Constitution, it will remain with a ca  
  
did public to decide, whether it would not make an  
  
inconsistency and degeneracy, if an indifferenc  
  
were now shown to a palpable violation of one of  
  
those rights, the freedom of the press;and to a pre.  
  
cedent therein, which may be fatal to the other, the  
  
free exercise of religion.  
That the precedont established by the violation  
  
of the former of these rights, may, as is affirmed by  
the resolution, be fatal to the latter, appears to be  
demonstrable, by a comparison of the grounds on  
  
which they respectively rest; and from the scope  
  
of reasoning, by which the power over the former  
  
has been vindicated.  
First. Both of these rights, the liberty of con  
science and of the press, rest equally on the origi  
  
nal ground of not being delegated by the Constitu  
tion, and consequently withheld from the Govern  
  
ment. Any construction, therefore, that would  
attack this original security for the one, must have  
  
the like effect on the other.  
  
Secondly. They are both equally secured by  
  
the supplement to the Constitution; being both in­  
cluded in the same amendment, made at the same  
  
time, and by the same authority. Any construc  
  
tion or argument, then, which would turn the  
  
amendment into a grant or acknowledgment  
  
power with respect to the press, might be equally  
  
applied to the freedom of religion.  
  
Thiradly. If it be admitted that the extent o  
  
the freedom of the press, secured by the amend  
  
ment, is to be measured by the common law on  
  
this subject, the same authority may be resorted to  
  
for the standard which is to fix the extent of the  
  
&quot;free exercise of religion.&quot; It cannot he neces  
  
sary to say what this standard would be; whether  
  
the common law be taken solely as the unwritten,  
  
or as varied by the written law of England  
  
Fourthly. If the words and phrases in the  
amendment are to be considered as chosen with a  
studied discrimination, which yields an argument  
for a power over the press, under the limitation that  
its freedom be not abridged, the same argument  
results from the same consideration, for a power  
  
over the exercise of religion, under the limitation  
  
that its freedom be not prohibited.  
  
For if Congress may regulate the freedom of the  
  
press, provided they do not abridge it, because it  
is said only, &quot;they shall not abridge it,&quot; and is not  
said, &quot;they shall make no law respecting it,&quot; the  
analogy of reasoning is conclusive, that Congress  
may regulate and even abridge the free exercise  
of religion; provided they do not prohibit it; be  
  
cause it is said only &quot;they shall not prohibit it;&quot;  
  
and is nol said, &quot;they shall make no law respect  
ing, or no law abridging it.&quot;  
  
The General AAssembly were governed by the  
  
clearest reason, then, in considering the &quot;Sedition  
Act,&quot; which legislates on the freedom of the press,  
as establishing a precedent that may be fatal to the  
liberty of conscience; and it will be the duty of all,  
  
in proportion as they value the security of the lat­  
ter, to take the alarm at every encroachment on  
  
the former.  
The two concluding resolutions only remain to  
be examined. They are in the words following:  
&quot;That the good people of this Commonwealth,  
having ever felt and continuing to feel the most  
incere affection for their brethren of the other  
States; the truest anxiety for establishing and per­  
petuating the Inion of all; and the most scrupn­  
lous fidelity to that Constitution, which is the pledge  
of mutual friendship, and the instrument of mutual  
happiness; the General Assembly doth solemul  
appeal to the like dispositions in the other States,  
in confidence thaf they will concur with this Com­  
monwealth in declaring, as it does hereby declare,  
that the acts aforesaid are unconstitutional; and,  
that the necessary and proper measures will be ta­  
ken by each, for co-operating with this State, in  
  
maintaining unimpaired, the anthorities, rights, and  
liberties reserved in the States respectively, or to  
the people.  
&quot;That the Governor be desired to transmit a  
copy of the foregoing resolutions to the Executive  
authority of each of the other States, with a request  
that the same may be communicated to the Legi­  
lature thereof; and that a copy be furnished to each  
of the Senators and Representatives, representing  
this State in the Congress of the U.S.&quot;  
The fairness and regularity of the course of the  
proceeding, here pursued, have not protected it  
against objections even from the sources too respec­  
table to be disregarded.  
it has been said, that it belongs to the judiciary  
of the United States, and not the State Legislatures,  
to declare the meaning of the Federal Constitution.  
But a declaration, that proceedings of the Federal  
Government are not warranted by the Constitution,  
is a novelty neither among the citizens, nor among  
the Legislatures of the States; nor are the citizen  
or the Legislature of Virginia, singular in the e­  
ample of it.  
Nor can the declarations of either, whether af­  
firming or denying the Constitutionality of measure  
of the Federal Government; or whether made be­  
fore or after judicial decisions thereon, be deemed  
in any point of view, an assumption of the office  
of the judge. The declarations, in such cases, are  
expressions of opinion, unaccompanied with any  
other effect than what they may produce on opin-  
ion, by exciting reflection. The expositions of the  
judiciary, on the other hand, are carried into im­  
mediate effect by force. The former may lead to  
a change in the legislative expression of the general  
will; possibly to a change in the opinion of the ja­  
diciary; the latter enforces the general will, whilst  
that will and that opinion continne unchanged.  
And if there be no imprpriety in declaring the  
unconstitutionality of the proceedings in the Fed­  
cral Government, where can be the impropriety of  
communicating the declaration to the other States  
and inviting their concurrence in a like declaration?  
What is allowable for one must be allowable for  
all; and a free communication among the States,  
where the Constitution imposes no restraint, is as  
allowable among the State Governments as among  
other public bodies or private citizens. This con  
sideration derives a weight, that cannot be denied  
to it, from the relation of the State Legislatures to  
the Federal Legislature, as the immediate constitu­  
ents of one of its branches.  
The Legislatures of the States have a right also  
to originate amendments to the Constitution, by a  
  
te o te a co the whole number,  
  
expressed by the resolution, that the necessary and  
proper measures would be taken by the other  
States for co-operating with Virginia in maintain­  
ing the rights reserved to the States, or to the peo­  
ple, be in any degree liable to the objections which  
have been raised against it.  
If it be liable to objection, it must be because  
either the object or the means are objectionable.  
The object being to maintain what the Constitu­  
tion has ordained, is in itself a laudable object.  
The means are expressed in the terms &quot;the ne­  
cessary and proper measures.&quot; A proper object  
was to be pursued, by means both necessary and  
proper.  
To find an objection, then, it must be shown that  
some meaning was annexed to these general terms,  
which was not proper; and, for this purpose, ei­  
ther that the means used by the General Assembly  
were an example of improper means, or that there  
were no proper means to which the terms could  
refer.  
In the example given by the State, of declaring  
the Alien and Sedition acts to be unconstitutional,  
and of communicating the declaration to the other  
States, no trace of improper means has appeared.  
And if the other States had concurred in making a  
like declaration, supported too by the numerous  
applications flowing immediately from the people,  
  
it can scarcely be doubted, that these simple means  
  
It is no less certain, that other means might have  
  
been employed, which are strictly within the limits  
of the Constitution. The Legislatures of the States  
might have made a direct representation to Con­  
gress, with a view to obtain a rescinding of the two  
offensive acts; or, they might have represented to  
their respective Senators in Congress, their wish,  
that two-thirds thereof would propose an explana­  
tory amendment to the Constitution; or two-thirds  
of themselves, if such had been their option, might,  
by an application to Congress, have obtained a  
Convention for the same object.  
These several means, though not equally eligible  
in themselves, nor probably to the States, were all  
constitutionally open for consideration. And if the  
General Assembly, after declaring the two acts to  
  
be unconstitutional, the first and most obvious pro-  
 aee oe oe ee ee ee  
  
ceeung on the sunject, did hot undertake to point  
out to the other States, a choice among the farther  
  
measures that might become necessacry &amp; proper,  
the reserve will not be misconstrued by liberal  
  
minds into any culpable imputation  
  
These observations appear to form a satisfactory  
  
reply to every objection which is not founded on  
  
a misconception of the terms employed in the reso-  
  
lutions. There is one other, however, which may  
be of too much importance not to be added. It  
  
cannot be forgotten, that among the arguments ad-  
  
fressed to those who apprehended danger to liber  
  
ty from the establishment of the General Govern  
  
ment over so great a country, the appeal was em-  
  
phatically made to the intermediate existence of  
  
the State Governments, between the people and  
  
that Government, to the vigilance with which they  
  
would descry the first symptoms of usurpation, and  
to the promptitude with which they would sound  
  
the alarm to the public. This argument was proba-  
 wotdtlet it ietteain t  
  
ty ot witout iis eect; and if i was a proper  
one then, to recommend the establishment of the  
  
Constitution, it must be a proper one now, to as-  
  
sist in its interprelation  
  
The only part of the two concluding resolutions  
  
that remains to be noticed, is the repetition in the  
first, of that warm affection to the Union and its  
members, and of that scrupulous fidelity to the  
Constitution, which have been invariably felt by  
  
the people of this State. As the proceedings were  
  
introduced with these sentiments, they could not  
  
e more properly closed than in the same manner.  
hould there be any so far misled as to call in ques-  
  
tion the sincerity of these professions, whatever  
regret may be excited by the error, the General  
  
Assembly cannot descend into a discussion of it.  
Those who have listened to the suggestion, can  
  
only be left to their own recollection of the part  
  
which this State has borne in the estahlishment of  
  
our National Independence, in the establishment  
of our National Constitution, and in maintaining  
under it the authority and laws of the Union, with­  
out a single exception of internal resistance or com­  
motion. By recurring to these facts, they will be  
  
able to convince themselves, that the representa-  
  
tives of the people of Virginia, must be above the  
  
necessity of opposing any other shield to attacks  
  
on their national patriotism, than their own con­  
ciousness, and the justice of an enlightened pub-  
  
;who will perceive in the resolutions themselves,  
  
the strongest evidence of attachment both to the  
  
Constitution and to the Union, since it is only by  
maintaining the different governments and depart­  
mets within their respective limits, that the bless­  
ings of either can be perpetnated.  
  
The extensive view of the subject thus taken by  
  
the committee, has led them to report to the House,  
as the result of the whole, the following resolu-  
  
tion:

in that sense in which the States are parties to the com­  
pact. If the Senate would indulge him for a moment  
He would turn to the celebrated report of Mr. Madison,  
whence,he thought, if gentlemen would take that dis­  
tinguished patriot and sage as authority, he should be  
able to derive ample support in the position which he  
occupied. In commenting upon the third resolution,  
which affirms that the States are parties to the com­  
pact, Mr. Madison uses the following emphatic lan­  
guage:?&quot;It is indeed true that the term &quot;States&quot; is  
sometimes used in a vague sense, and sometimes in dif­  
ferent senses, according to the subject to which it is ap­  
plied. Thus, it sometimes means the separate sections  
of territory occupied by the political societies within  
each ; sometimes the particular governments estab­  
lished by those societies; sometimes those societies  
as organized into those particular governments; and  
lastly, it means the people comprising those political  
societies in their highest sovereign capacity. In the  
present instance, whatever different constructions  
ofthe term &quot;States&quot; in the resolution may have  
been entertained, all will at least concur in that last  
mentioned; because, in that sense, the Constitution  
was submitted to the &quot; States&quot;?in that sense, the i  
&quot;States&quot; ratified it, and, in that sense of the term i  
&quot;States,&quot; they are consequently parties to the compact, |  
from which the powers of the Federal Government re- j  
suit&quot; Now, in this definition ofthe term &quot;States,&quot; I  
Mr. Madison had drawn a marked distinction between&#x27;  
the political government of a community of people, and j  
the same community of people, composing that politi­  
cal government, in their highest sovereign capacity, i  
He had affirmed that, whilst tlie term might be applied (  
to territory, to political governments, or to the people !  
in their highest sovereign capacity, it was in the latter j  
sense alone that the Constitution had been submitted !  
to, and ratified bv the State. If, then, the Senators in ;

cipic on which our Independence itself was de  
dared.  
But it is objected, that the Judicial authority is to  
be regarded as the sole expositor of the Constitution  
in the last resoit; and it may be asked for what  
reason, the decl.aration by the General Assembly,  
supposing it to be theoretically true, could be re-  
qtiired at the present day, and &#x27;in so solemn a man-  
ner.  
On this subject it might be observed, first: that  
there may be instances of usurped power, which  
the forms of the Constitution would never draw  
within the control of the Judicial department; Se­  
condly, that if tile decision of the Judiciary be  
raiSt&#x27;d above the authority of the sovereign parties  
  
to the Constitution, the decisions of the other de-  
may have b- en  ntertained. all will at least concur j paitments not carried by the forms of the Consti-  
in that last mentiontd; because in thj-t s nse, the j tiition before the Judiciary, must be tqually au-  
(.onstit&#x27;.ition was stibmittel to the ‘^St des,” in th d | thoritative and final with&#x27;the decisions of that de-  
pa: tmoit. But the proper answer to the objection  
is, that the resolution of the General Assembly le-  
lat( s to those great and extraordinary cases, in  
\\ hich all the forms of the Constitution may prove  
iiiefilctual against infractions dangerous to &quot;the es­  
sential rights of the parties to it. The resolutiejn  
supposes that dangerous powers not delegated, may  
not only be usurped and executed by the other de-  
prrtments, but that the Judicial departmmt, also,  
may e*xercise or sanction elangerous powe*rs beyond  
tlie grant of the Ccjnsfitution; and, consequeutly,  
that the ultimide right of the paities to the CV&gt;nsti-  
hns been dan-  
itions by one  
  
.s- nsethe ‘-Stall s&#x27;’ ratitied it: and in th:it sense of the  
term “ Slat, s” th y are consequently pa.tie&#x27;S to the  
compact from wliich the j)0\vers of the Federal  
(Jovernment result.  
7’he next position is, that tlK- C«e.neral Assembly  
views the powers of the Federal ^TOV(&#x27;rnment. “as  
limitt&#x27;d by the plain sense and intention of tho in-  
strumnit constituting that coinpact.” and “‘as no  
larther valid than they are authorized by the grants  
therein emnnernt-d.” It doe^s not S’*em possibh*.  
that any just objection can lie against either of these  
  
claust s. The liist autoimts m‘*rely to a declaration. . .

In their iTsolution—•* The General Asstm-  
bly most solemnly ibdares a warm attachm* nt to  
the union of the States, to maintain wnich, it pledges  
all its powers; and that, for this .n^l, it is their duty  
to watch over and o]ipos** every infraction of those  
principle&#x27;s, which constitute the only basis of that  
Union, because a faithful ol»servanct&#x27; of them cuii  
alone secure its e*xisleuce and the ])ublic happin* ss.”  
The observation just made is equally applicable  
to this solem dt&#x27;claration of warm attachnu nt to the  
Union, and this solemn pbelge to maintain it; nor  
can any question arise amony^ enlightened friends  
of the IJ nioii, as to the duty of watching over and  
opposing every infraction of those princijiles which  
c(mstitute its basis, and a faithful observance of  
which, can alone secure its exist* nc(\ and the pub­  
lic happiness thereon cb pen ling.  
The third resolutiim is in the words f(jllowing:  
“ That this Assembly doth explicitly and pe‘r-  
emptorily declare, that it views the powe-rs of the  
Federal (Tovernment, as resulting from the com­  
pact, to which the Stat&#x27; S arc parties, as limited by  
the plain sense and intention of the instruuient con­  
stituting that c()mpact—as no further valid than  
they are authoriseil by the grants enumerated in  
that compact; and that in case of a d liberate, ]&gt;al-  
pable- and dangerous exercise of other powers, not  
granted by the said compact, the Statts who are  
parties thereto, have th(* right, anil are in duty  
bound, to interpose, for arresting the progress of the  
evil, and for maintaining within th*ir respective  
limits, the authorities, rights and liberties aj&gt;per-  
taining to the&#x27;m.”  
On this n solution, the committee hav&#x27;e b( stowed  
all the atteritiem which its importance merits: They  
have scanned it not m*rely with a strict, but with  
a severe eye; and they feel confidence in pronoun­  
cing, in its just and fair constrvction, it is unex-  
ceptionahly true in its several positions, as well as  
Constitutio7ial and conclusive in its references.  
The resolution declares; first, that “it vi-ws the  
powers of the Federal Government, as resulting  
from the compact to which tho States are paitie&#x27;S, ’  
in other words, that the federal powers are derived  
from the Constitution; and that the Constitution is  
a compact to which the States are parties.  
Clear as the position must seem, that the Fe deral  
powers are derived from the Constitution, and from  
that alone, the committee are not tmapprisud of a late  
doctrine, which opens another source of federal  
powers, not less e&#x27;xtensive and important, than it is  
new&#x27; and unexpected. The examination of this  
doctrine w&#x27;ill be most convenie&#x27;ntly connected with a  
review of a succeeding resolution. The committee  
satisfy themselves here w&#x27;ith briefly remarking, that  
in all the contemporary discussions and comments  
which the Constitution underwent, it was constantly  
justified and recommended, on the. ground that the  
powers not given to the governmerit, were w&#x27;ithheld  
from it: and, that if any doubt could have existed  
on the subject, under the original text of the Con­  
stitution, it is removed, as far as words could re­  
move it, by the 12th amendment, now a part of  
the Constitution, which expressly declares, “that  
the powers not delegated to the United States, by  
the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the Stat^ s,  
are reserved to the States respectively, or to the  
people.”  
The other position involved in this branch of the  
resolution, namely “that the States are parties to  
the Constitution or compact, is, in the judgment of  
the committee, equally free from objection It is  
indeed true, that the term ‘ States,’ is som*jtimes used

part, and of the whob*, it is always laid down that  
the bre-ach must be both wilful and material to justi­  
fy an application of the rub*. But in the case of  
an intimate and constitutional union, like that of  
tho United Stat ss, it is evidt nt that tlie interpo-  
sitie&gt;n of the pajties, in their soven ign capacity,  
can be called for by occasions only, dt eply and i s-  
sentially allecting the vital principb s of their politi­  
cal system.  
The resolution has accordingly guarded against  
any misapju’ehension of its obji ct, by expressly re­  
quiring for such an interposition, “the case of a de-  
liherafe, palpable and dans^erorts breach of the  
Constitution, by the (‘xercise of powers not graiifed  
by it.” It must be a case, iif)t of a light and tran­  
sient nature*; but of a nature dangerous to the great  
purposes for wliich the constitution was established.  
It must be a case\ moreover, not obscure or doubtful  
in its construction, but plain and palpable. Lastly,  
it must be a cast* not re&#x27;sulting from a partial con­  
sideration: or hasty determination; but a case stampt  
with a final corisid.^ration and dcdlberate adherence*.  
It is not necessary, because the re solution dose not  
require, that the question should be discussed, how  
far the exercise* of any particular power, imgranted  
by the constitution, would justify the interpetsiton of  
the partie’S to it. As cases might easily be stated,  
which none would contend ought to fall within that  
description; cases, on the other iiand, migbt, with  
equal e^ase, be stated, so fl.igrant aivl so fital. as to  
unite every opinion in placing them within the de­

Whether the exposition of the general phra-

I oncerjiiut/ v.diich the Comaiiittee can perceive little

States into one sovereignty, nothing more can be  
wanted than to supersede their respective sovereign­  
ties in the casts reserveil to them, by extending the  
sovereignty of the. United States, to all cases of^ the

ever  
7’hat the obvious tendency and inevitable re­  
sult of a consolidation of the United States into

cis enemies. With respect to aliens who are not  
enemies, but members of nations in pe^ace and amity  
with the I nited Statrs, the power assumed by the  
act of Conirress, is denied to be constitutional; and  
it is lu&#x27;cordingly airain.st this act that the protest of  
the Creneral Assembly is expressly and exclusively  
directed.  
A thud ol,‘snrvation is, that vrere it admitt(&gt;d,as is  
contended that tho “act concerning aliens,” has for  
Its object, not a penal, but a preventive justice, it  
would still remain to be proved that it conns within  
the constitutional power of the federal legislature :  
and if Avithin its power, that the legislature has ex^

tion. It must, in truth, be so considered. And&#x27; if it  
he a penal act, the punislnnent it inflicts must be  
justified by some offence that deserves it.  
Offences for which Aliens, within the juri.sdiction  
of a country, arc punishable, art&#x27; first, oifences com­  
mitted by tlie i\ut,ion of wiiicii they make a part, and  
in whose otlences they are involwd: Secondly&#x27; of­  
fences committed by themselv&#x27;es alone, without any  
charge against the nation to which they belotir.  
The first is the case of Alien enemies; the second,  
the caf»e of Alien fricnd.s. In the first case), the ot*-  
te.nding nation can no otherwise be punished than  
by war, one of the laws which authorises the expul­  
sion of such of its members, as may be found in the  
country, against which the otlence has been com­  
mitted. In the second case, the ofl&#x27;ence being com­  
mitted by tiie individuhil, not by his nation, and  
against the municipal law, not agrinst the law of na­  
tions, the Lnilividual Oiily, and not the nation, is pun-  
isbalde; and the punishment nuist be conducted ac­  
cording to the municipal law. not according to the  
law of nations. Undtir this view of the subject., the  
act of Congress, for the removal of Alioti enemies,  
being contbimable to the law of nations, is fustified  
by the .&#x27;onstitution; and the “ ac^*&#x27; for the removal  
  
of Alien fi*iends,^,llein^repugnantto the Consiitutioii-  
al principles of municipal law, is unjustifiable.  
Nor id the act of Congress, Ibr the removal of  
Alien friends, more agreeable to the general prac­  
tice of nations, than it is within the purview of the  
law of nations. The general practice of nations,  
distinguishes ijetween Alien frientls and Alien ene­  
mies. The latter it has proceeded against, accord­  
ing to the law of nations, by expelling them as ene­  
mies. The ibrmer it has considered an under a lo­  
cal and temporary allegiance, and entitled to a cor­  
respondent protection. If contrary instiinces are to  
be tbund in barbarous countries, under undefined  
prerogative.s, or amid revohitior&gt;ary dangers; they  
will not be deemed fit precedents tor the governmeilt  
of the United Stat(;s, even, if&#x27; not beyond its Consti­  
tutional authority.  
It i.:&gt; said tliat Congress may grant letters of  
marque ami reprisal: that reprisals may be made on  
persons, as Avell as property: and that tlie removal  
of Aliens may be considerel as the exercise in an in­  
terior degree, of the general power of reprisal on  
persons.  
W^ithout entering nnnutely into a question that  
does not seem to retpiire it, it may be remarked, that  
reprisal is a seizure oi&#x27; foreign ])ersons or i)roperty,  
with a view to obtain that justice, lor injuries done  
1)}&#x27; one State or its memlx^rs, to another State or its  
members ; for wdiich, a. refusal ot’ the aggressors re-  
(juires such a resort to force under the law of nations.  
It must be considered as an abuse of wonls to call  
tlie remov^al of persons from a country, a seizure or  
i*eprisal on tliein; nor is the distinctioa to be over-  
loel^ed h(.tv,&#x27;cen reprisals on persons witjiiii tiie coun-  
ii&#x27;V aitd under t:ie fai&#x27;di of its laws, and on persons  
out of the country. IJut, laying aside these consid­  
erations, it is evidently iinpo.&#x27;^^sible to b-nng tiie Alien  
act wiiliin tlie power ol&#x27; grantiMo- r(;prisals; since it  
do(‘s not tdlege or imply any injury reci ived from  
any j)articular nation, ibr which this proccedimr  
against its members was intended as a reparation.—  
The proceeding is aufhorise&#x27;il aarainst Aliens of eve-  
nj notion ; of nations charg;d neither with any simi­  
lar proceedit*g a_rainst American citizens, nor with  
any injurie.&#x27;; for which justice might be sought, in the  
mode prescribed by the act. Wt&#x27;re it true, therefore,  
that good causes existed for reprisals against one or  
more foreign nations, and that neither the persons  
nor property of its mfunbers, umler tlie faith of our  
laws, could plead an exemption : tlu^ operation of&#x27;the  
act ought to have b(&#x27;en limited to the Aliims among  
us, belomriair to such naiions. ^I’o license reprisals  
against all nations, tor agL’^n&#x27;ssions charged on one  
only, v&gt;’ould be a measunr as contrary to every prin­  
ciple of justice anil pid)lic law, as to a wise policy,  
aiid the universal practice of nations.  
It is said, that the right of removing Alien.s is an  
incident to the })ower of war. vested in Congress by  
ilie Constitution.  
This is a Ibrmer argunient in a new tbape only;  
and is answered by repeatinu:, that the removal of  
Alien enemies is an inciiiee.t to tiie powi:r of war:  
that the rcmov:d of Alien friends, is not an iiicident  
to tiie power oi&#x27; war.  
It i; said, that (^ongre.-s an&#x27; by the Constitution to  
protect each State against invasion; and that tiic  
means o\ prcvtMtiin^&#x27; invasion are included in the j)ov,&#x27;-  
erot&#x27;protection against it.  
Tiu&#x27; pov.’er of war in gtmeral. having been Iteforc  
jxrantid t)y t!u‘ (&#x27;&#x27;oustitution; tins clause must t ither  
be a mere specitication tor jjreater ceaition and cer­  
tainty, of which there are other exam})le.s in the  
instrument; or Ik; the injunction »)l’ a duty, .superail-  
dfil to a grant of the j&#x27;ower. Under either ercplan-  
ation, it caiiiiot enlarge the ])owers of Congret&#x27;-s on  
the subject. The pow r and the duty to protect  
each jStiite against an invatlintr enemy, would be  
the same undiT tlie jjeneral power, if tliis regard to  
gi&#x27;cater caution le-id been omitted.  
Invasion is an operation ot&#x27; war. To protect  
a.srainst in\ asion is an exercise, of tlie powei* ol&#x27; war.  
A powi r. theret&#x27;ore. not incitlent to war, cannot b(&#x27;  
incident to a particular modification of Vv&#x27;ar. And  
as the removal ol‘ alien t&#x27;riemls has appe;tred to be*  
no incident to a general state of war, it cannot l)p  
incidfMit to a partial stale, or a particular modifica­  
tion of war.  
r\or can it ever be oranted. tliat tin&#x27; power to act  
on a case, v&gt;du&#x27;n it actually occurs. inclmh‘s a power  
over all the means that inrsy tend to prevent tiie oc­  
currence of the case. Sucii a latitude of construc­  
tion would render unavailing, e&#x27;.ery jiraeticabhi

However diflicull it may be to mark, m every  
case, AMtxi cIt ainess and certainty, the line which  
divides Legislative power from the other depart­  
ments of power; all will agree, that the powers re-  
ferrc&#x27;d to tin se departments may be so general and  
undelincd, as to be 01 a Legislative, not of an Ex­  
ecutive or Judicial nature; and may for tiiat reason  
be uncoiistitutional. Details to a certain degree  
a;e asseruial to the nature and character of a law;  
and on Ciiminal suijjLCts, it is proper, that details  
should leave as little as possible to the discre&#x27;tion of  
those who are to apply aiid execute the law. II  
nothing more were rt quire d, in exercising a Leg­  
islative tiiJSt, than a general convryance ol authori-

the authoiity coimyed, siiould be carrird into ef­

itself, proclamations might become substitutes Ibi

not be denied to be a union of the dili&#x27;ertnt powers.  
To determine, then, whether the appropriate pow­

The sero/rl ftbject acrainst which the rtsolution  
j&#x27;.r* t ;r?s. is the Sedititiii Act.

has ever been justly dec med :hj only etllctual guar­  
dian of every other right.  
1. &#x27;Phat it exercises a power not d-legated by the  
Constitution.

the Federal (.Jovernnifnt being composed of powers  
sp&#x27; cilically granted v/itli a reservation of all others  
to the States or to the Pt&#x27;oj h&#x27;.the positive authority  
under which the Sedition Act couM be passed must  
be pro hiced by those v/ho assert its consitutionality.  
In v.diat pirt of the Constitution, then, is this au­  
thority to be luund ?  
Several atte-;npts have been made to answer tliis  
question, which will bo examiiK&#x27;d in their order.  
&#x27;Phe (Jommitti&#x27;e will begin with one. which has

rence le»r enir (. e&gt;nslitutie)ii, jii the true character in  
which it iosuc&#x27;d from the sovereign authority of the  
People. &#x27;I’he (.&#x27;o&#x27;uiiiittej&#x27; refer to th-&#x27; doctrine late­  
ly advanc-‘d as a sanction to the Sedition Act,  
  
tiia. tne coljiiifs were co-ordinate members with  
each other, and vnth (,:frcat j^ritain : of an empire, 1  
united b^ a common Exc&#x27;cutive S&#x27;ovcrci.^Ti, but not  
united by any common L‘\gisl itive sc/errign. The  
L&#x27; gislati\e^ pouer ^vas mniatained to he 2s com-  
pl( to in eacii American Parh-unent, as in tho Bri­  
tish i ailiameiit. And tiu&#x27; royal ]M’erogative was in  
force in each coh,ny. by viiiue of its acknowledo-.  
ing the King for its P^xecutivt&#x27;&#x27; j\Ligistrnte. as it was  
m Great liiitain, by virtue of a like acknowlrdn--  
ment there. A denial of these principles by Great  
Britain, and ijie assertion of them by America pro­  
duced the revohition.  
^ X here was a time indeed, when an exception tc/  
tne Legislati\e separation to the several component  
aI1 1 co-f tpial pails of the empire, olitained a degree  
of acquiesceri&#x27;*&#x27;^. I he Jjritish Parliament was al­  
lowed to regulate the trade with forci^gn nations,  
and b; tween the difiu-rcnt parts of the empire. This  
was, however, mere practice without right, and con­  
trary to the true th(ory of the Constitution. The  
conveniency ofsomeregulatienis, in both those cases,  
V\ as apparent; and as there v.&#x27;as no Tj&#x27;&#x27;gis],itiirc  
  
One of those descriptions comprehends the case*&#x27;^  
growing otit of the restrictions on the Lcgislativo  
power of the States. For example, it is provided  
that ‘‘no State shall emit bills of credit,” or “make^  
any thing but gold and silver coin a tender in pay-  
iTfont of debts.’’ ShouH fliis prohibition be viola­  
ted, and a suit hclwceii ci.tizcKx of the same  
be the consequence, this would be a case arisin^&quot;^  
iindor the Constitution bofjre the Judicial pov.&#x27;cr of  
the United States. A sccond description compre­  
hends suits between citizens and foreigners, or citi­  
zens of difTerent States, to bo decidcd according to  
the State or foreign laws; but submitted by^fho  
Constitution to the Judicial power of the United  
States; the ,Tudicial power being, in several instan­  
ces, extended beyond the L&#x27;^gislativc power cf the  
United States.

the revolution and the final ratitlcation of these ar­  
ticles, tiic iiituic and c&#x27;xtent (&gt;f the Union v/as de­  
termined by the circumstances of the crisis, rather  
than bj any accurate dehneaiion of the general au-  
thoiit\. It Will not be alle&#x27;dged, that the ‘&quot;com­  
mon law&quot; could have had any legitimate birth as a  
law&#x27; of the United Statens during that stat3 of things.  
If it cjiiiiG Qs such into oxistciico ut all, the c]i[irtcr  
of confederation must have been its parent.  
Here again, however, its pretensions are abso­  
lutely de“Stitute of foundation. ^Phis instrument  
does not contain a sentence or syllable that can be  
tortured into a count* nance of the idea, that the  
paiiies to it were, with resjiect to tho objects of the  
common law, to form one commimity. No such  
law is named or inipli vl, or tillud.&#x27;d to. or bring in  
force, or as brought into force by that compact.  
No provision is made by which such a law could  
be carried into operation • whilst, on the riher hand,  
every such inference or pretext is a]n^ohitely pre­  
cluded by article ‘2d, which deckires, ‘-that cach  
State&gt; letains its sovereignty, fre&#x27;edoin and mdepcn-  
d. nee, and every jiower, juri.sdiction and right,  
which is not by this confederation expressly dele­  
gated to tiie United States, in Congress assoinbled.”  
&#x27;i&#x27;hus far it appears, thit not a vestirro of this  
  
that an exception of all criminal eases could le  
contemplated; as well because a discretion in Con­  
gress to make or omit the exception v/ould bo im­  
proper, as because it would liave been iinneccssay.  
The exception could as easily have born made b\^  
the Constitution itself, as referred to the Congress. &#x27;  
Once more; the amendment last addc-d to (he  
Constitution, deserves attention, as throwing light  
on this subjVct. ‘-The Judicial power of the Uni­

nou.d not include any cases whatever of a crimi­  
nal n.iture; and consequently, would not authorise  
die iniorence from it, that the Judicial authority ex­  
tends to ojenccs arising under the Constitution.  
It is further to be considered, that even if this  
pa/t of t:ie Constitution could be strained into an  
app ication to every common law case, criminal as  
no cfTect in justifyino-

There are two passages in the Constitution, in  
which a description of the laws of the U. States is  
found, dho first is contained in Art III Sec 2

it an attention, wdiich other considerations might  
have forbidden.  
In executing the task, it may be of use to look  
back to the colonial state of this country, prior to  
the Revolution : totracc theefl&#x27;ect of the revolution  
which converted the colonies into independent  
States ; to inquire into the iinixirt of the articles of  
confeKieration, the first intrimient by Avhicli the  
union of the States was regularly established; and  
finally, to constilt the Constitution of 1788, wdiich  
is the oraclc that mustde^cide, the important quc’stion.  
In the State prior to the Revolution, it is certain  
that the common law, under diflferent limitations,  
made a part of the colonial code&#x27;s. But whether it  
bo understood that the original colonists brought  
the law \vith them, or made it their law by adop­  
tion, it is equally certain, that it was the separate  
law of each colony within its respective limits, and  
Vv’as unknown to tlicm, as a law pervading and ope­  
rating through the whole, as one society.  
It could not possibly be otherwise. The com­  
mon law was not the same in any two of the colo-  
niis; m some, the moelifications were materially  
and extensively different. There was no comrron  
Legisluture, by which tlie common will could be  
e xprtssed in the form of a law ; nor any common  
magistracy, by v*diich such a lc»v/ could be carried  
into practice. The v. ill of cach colony, alone and  
St paratc ly, had its organs lor these purposes.  
This stage of our political history, furnishes no  
foothold lor the patrons of this new doctrine.  
Did then the principle or operation of the great  
event which made the colonies independent States  
  
necessary and proper for carrying ‘into execution  
the powers expressly delegated. But the question  
does not relate to either of these portions of the  
common law. It relates to the common law&#x27; be­  
yond these limitations.  
The only part of the Constitution which seems  
to have been relied on in this case, is the 21 sect. of  
Art. III. “ The judicial power shall extend to all  
eases, in law and equity, arising snider this Coasti-  
iution, the laws of the United States, and treaties  
made or wdiich shall be made under their autho­  
rity.”  
It has been asked what cases, distinct from those  
arising under the laws and treaties of the United  
States, can arise under the Constitution, other than  
those arising under the common lavr; and it is in­  
ferred, that the common l;iw is accordingly adopt­  
ed or recognized by the Constitution.  
Never, perhaps, &quot;was so broad a construction ap­  
plied to a text so clearly unsusceptible of it. If  
any color for the inference could be foimd, it must  
be in the impossibility of finding any other eases in  
law and equity, within the provision of the Consti­  
tution, to satisfy the expression; and rather than re­  
sort to a construction affecting so essentially the  
whole character of the government, it would per­  
haps be more rational to consider the expression as  
a mere pleonasm or inadvertance. But, it is not  
necessary to decide on such a dilemma. The ex­  
pression is fully satisfied, and its accuracy justified,  
by two descriptions of cases, to which the Judicial  
authority is extended, and n^&#x27;ither of which implies  
tliat the conomon law is the laiv of the U. Stitt&#x27;s.  
  
shall be the supreme law of tiie land.” The first  
of these descriptions was meant as a guide to the  
Judges of the United States; the second, as a ruid.^  
to the Ju Iges of the several States. Both of Ihem  
consi.st of an enumerntion, y.diich was evidently  
meant to bo precise and complete. If the common  
law had been undf^rstood to be a law of the United  
St ttr-s, it jS not possible to assign.&#x27;a satisfactory rea-  
Si,n w.hy i* wris not exprejsecl fn the enumeration.  
In ni.i.of th‘SO subjects-, thVdidlculties and con-  
fusion insrpaval le from a consfriictive introduction  
of the common law&#x27;, weuld aflbrd powerful rcasoiis  
against it.  
Is it to be the cammon law \rith, or whhout tlie  
British Statut&#x27;s?  
If without the statutory amendments, the vices of  
the c:xio vrould be insupportable.  
If With these amendmb’nt&#x27;Sj what period is to be  
fixed for limiting the -British authority over our  
laws?  
Is it to be the dn^y of tho eldest or the yonnf^c:t  
of the colonies ? &#x27; &#x27;• * *  
Or are the elates to be thrown together, and a m ■  
dium deduced ?  
Or is Our indoprndence to be taken for tlie d-ite .?  
Is, again, regard to bo had to the various chan­  
ges in the e^onomon law made&#x27; by the local codes of  
America 2  
Is regard to be had to such changes, suts^queiif.  
as well as priorj to the rst iblishment of the Con-:!:-  
tution ?

Is the law to be dhfcrent in every State, as differ­  
ently modified by itscodt^, or are the me&gt;di tic aliens  
of any particular. State to be: applied to all ?  
And on the latter supposition, which among the  
State codes form the standard ?  
Questions of this sort miglit be multiplied with  
as much ease as there would be ditficulty in an-  
sv/ering them.

construction, lurnish other objections equally con­

Whenever therefore, a question arises concerning  
the constitutionality of a particular power, the ques­  
tion is, whether the power be expres.sed in the con­  
stitution. If it be, the question is decided. It -it be  
not fcxprcssed, the next inquiry must be, whether it  
is properly an incident to an express power, and ne­  
cessary to its execution. If it be, it may be exer­  
cised by Congress. If it be not. Congress cannot  
exercise it.  
I^et the question be asked, then, whether the  
power over the press, exercised in the “ Sedition  
act,” be found among the powers expressly vested  
in the Congrtss ? This is not pretended.  
Is there any express power, for executing wliich,

In the next place, as the President possesses the ! lion of the press, and a punishineut ot libels, are ex-  
itution, and is to see ercises of a power to suppress insurrections. &#x27;I&#x27;he  
  
executive powers of the Constitution  
that tliQ laws be faithfully executed, his authority  
also must be co-extensive with every branch of the  
common law. The additi^ris whicli this would  
make to his power, though not readily to be estima­  
ted, claim the most serious attention.  
This is not all: it will merit the most profound  
consideration, how far an indefinet admission oi’tlie  
common .law, with a latitude in construing it, equaJ  
to the constr.uetian by which it is deduced from the  
Constitution, might draw after ii the various pri.ro-  
gatiyos, making part of the unwritten law of En-  
glajid. The English Constit«fion itself is nothing  
nipre than a composition of imwriiitn laws and  
laaxime.  
In the third place, whether the coimnan law be  
  
most that could be said, would be, that the punish-  
vnent of libels, if it had the tendency ascribed to it,  
might prevc&#x27;nt the occasion of passing or exc&#x27;cuting  
laws necessary and proper for the suppression of ui-  
surrections.  
Has the Federal Government no power then, to  
prevent as well as to punish resistimce to the laws?  
They have the power which the constitution  
ileemed most proper in their hands for the purpose.  
&#x27;I’he Congress has power, before it happens, to pass  
laws for punishing it: and the executive and judi­  
ciary have power to inforce tho.&#x27;^e laws when it  
does happen.

tho United flutes, iho great and essential rigni^i oj  
the people arc secured, against Legislative as well  
as against Executive ambition. They are secured  
not by laws paramount to prerogative, but by  
stitutions paramount to laws. The security of the  
frctsdom of the press require^:, that it should be ex­  
empt, not only from previous re straint by the &#x27;Ex­  
ecutive, as in Gr(‘at Britain; bat from Legis&#x27;lative  
restraint also; and this e^cemptioii, to be etTectual,  
must be an exemption, not only from the previous  
inspection of licensers, but from the subseqent pen­  
alty of t^ie laws.  
The state of the press, therefore, under the com­  
mon law, cannot in this point of view, be the stand­  
ard of its freedom in the United States.  
13ut there is another view, under which it may  
be necessary to consider this subject. It may be al­  
leged, that although the security for the freelom of  
the press, be different in Great Britain and in this  
country; being a legal security only in the former,  
and a constitutional security in the latter; and al­  
though there may be a further difference, in an e.x-  
tension of the freedom of the press here, beyond an  
exempt&#x27;on from previous restraint, to an exemption  
from subsequent penalties also; yet that the actual  
legal freedom of the press, under th(? common la\v,  
must determine the degree of freedom, which is  
meant by the terms, and which is constitutionally  
secured against both previous and subsequent re­  
straints.  
&#x27;rhe Committee are not unaware of the difTiculty  
of ali general questions, which may turn on the  
proper boundary betw(H&#x27;ii the liberty and licentious­  
ness of the press. They will j^eave it therefore for  
consideration only, how fiir the difi&#x27;erence between  
the nature of the British Government, and the na­  
ture of the American Governments, and the prac­  
tice imder the latter, may show the degree of ri­  
gor in the former, to be inapplicable to. and not obli­  
gatory in the latter.  
The nature of C JoveinuK&#x27;nts elective, limited and  
responsible, in their branches, may well be suppo  
sed to require a greater freedom of animadversion,  
than might be tolerated by the genius of such

’ipal subjects embraced by the common law. Un-.  
dertlie Unite’d States, where so few laws exist on  
those subjects, and where so great a lapse of time  
Tnur^t happen before the vast chasm could be suppli-  
•*d. it is mamfest&#x27;that the power ofihe judges over  
the law ■woul 1, in fact, erect them into legislators,  
and that, for a lon^ time, it would be impo^ible for  
the citlzrns to. conjccture either v.Iiat was. or wuuid  
be law.  
In the last place, the consequence of admittuig the  
common law as the law efthe United States, on the  
authority of the individual States, is as obvious as  
it would be fatal. As this law relates to every sub-  
juct of legislation, anei wonlil be paramount to the  
coriMitutiuiiii utid la\^^ of ihc Si.iies , the aJiiilssiwn  
of it would ovefwh^4m the re*siduary sovereignty  
of ihe State&#x27;s, and by one constructive operation,  
at^v-model the whole political fabric of the country.  
, From the review thus taken of the situation of  
the American colonies, prior to their independence ;  
of the eflect of this event on their situation ; of the  
nffiftrc and import the articles of confe-deration  
of the true meaning of tho passage in the exis^tincr  
constitution from which the common law has been  
• Uxluced; of the difficulties and uncenainties inci­  
dent to the doctrine; and of its vast consequences in  
extending the? powers of the Federal Government.  
ani&#x27;V in superseding the authorities of the State C4o-  
vvrnmenta; the committee feel the utmost confi-  
knte in concluding, that the common law never  
wa^, nor by any fair construction, ever can be deem­  
ed a law for the American people ae; one commu­  
nity ; and they indulge the strongest expectation that  
the same conclusion will be finally drawn by all Can­  
dida tid accurate inqviiries into the subject. &#x27; It is, in­  
deed, distressing to reflect, that it ever ehould have  
been made a question, whether the constitution, on  
•the whole face of which is seen so much labor to  
enumerate and define the several objects of Fe-deral  
power, could intend to introduce in the lump, in an  
ii^direct manner, and by a force^el construction of a  
few phraser, the vast an 1 multifarious jurisdiction in­  
volved in the coupon la\v; a law filling so many  
ample voflumns; a law overspreading the entire fie iil  
of legislation ; and a law that would sap theiomida-  
fion of the constitution as a syste m of limited and  
specified powor;;. A severer reproach could not,  
in the opinion of the committee, be thrown on the  
constitution, on those who framed, or on those who  
established it, than sucii a supposition would throw  
on them.  
The argiiment then, drawn Iroin the common  
law, on the ground of its being adopte*d or recog­  
nized by the constitutiem, being inapplicable to the  
Sedition act, the comimttce will proceed to examine  
the other ar^ments which have been founded on  
the constitution.  
They will waste but little time on the attempt to  
cover txie act by the preaniable tothe constitution, it  
being contrary to every acknowle*dged rule of con­  
struction, to set up this part of an instrument in op­  
position to the plain meaning, expressed in the body  
»f tho instrument. A preamble usually contains  
the general motives or reasons for the *partk!ular  
regulations or measures which follow it; and is al­  
ways undc&#x27;rstood to be explained and limited by  
th(?m. In the present instance, a contrary inferpre-  
tntion would have the inadmissible eflect, of render­  
ing nugatory or improper, every part of the consti­  
tution which succeeds the preamble.  
The paragraph in Art. 1, Sec. 8, which con­  
tains the power to iay and collect taxes, dutie&gt;s im­  
ports, and excises ; -to pay l]ie debts, and provide for  
the common defence and general welfare, having  
been already examined, wilil also require no par-  
ticul(^r attention in this place. It will liave .been seen  
thiU&#x27; in its fair and consistent meaning, it cannot  
enlarge the enumerated powers vested in Congress.  
The part of the constitution which «eems most  
fo be recurred to, in defence of tlie ‘‘Sclition act,”  
IS the last clause of the above section, empowering  
Congress to make “ all laws which jshaH be necessa­  
ry and proper for carrying into execution the fore­  
going p()wcp, and all other powers vested by this  
constitution in the Government of the United States,  
or in any department or official thereof”  
The plain import of this clause is, that Congress  
shall have all tixe incidental or instrumental pow­  
ers, necessary and proper for carrying into execu­  
tion all tUc (impress powers; whether they be vested  
in the Qovemmejjt of^e United States, more col-  
Iectivelj% pr iu the several departments or officers  
thereof  
It is not a grant of new pawerg .to Congress, but  
merely a. declaration for the rimoi:al of all uncer-  
  
finite powers only; not of the general and indefiiiiie  
powers vested in ordinary Governments. For if  
the power to s}/ppres. i/isifrreftion^, includes the  
power to punish llbeh; or if the power to punish, in­  
cludes a power to by all the means that may  
have that iefi&#x27;Ictict/, such is the re lation and influ­  
ence among the most remote subjt&#x27;cf.s* of legislation,  
that a power over a very few, would carry with  
it a power over all. And it must be wholly imma­  
terial, whether unlimited powers be exercis&#x27;d under  
the name of unlimitt d powers, or be exercised un-  
eler the name of unlimited me^ans of carrying into  
execution, limiteel powers.  
This branch of the subject will be closed with a  
reflectiooi which must have weight with all: but es­  
pecially with those who place peculiar reliance on  
the judicial eKposition ofthe Constitution, as the bul­  
wark provided against undue extentions ofthe Legis­  
lative power. If it be understood that the powers  
implied in tho specified powerf^, have an imnu&#x27;diate  
and appropriate relation tothem, as mean.s. ncssesary  
and proper for carrynig them into execution, ques­  
tions on the constitutionality of laws pa.ssed for this  
purpose, will be of a nature sufliciently precise and  
determinate for Judicial cognizance and control!  
If, on the other hand. Congress are not limited in  
the cV»oico of mcaiie by niiy each fippropriate reln-  
tion of them to the specified peiwers; but may em­  
ploy alljsuch means as they may deem fitted XoprercnL  
as well as to punish, crimes subjected to their autho­  
rity ; such as may have a tenden^if only to promote  
an object for which the}* are authorised to provide;  
every one must perceive, that que&#x27;stioiis relating to  
me-ans of this sort must be epiesiious of mere policy  
and expediency; oii which, legislative discretion  
alone can decide*, and from which the .Tudicial in­  
terposition and control are completely excliuled.  
‘2. The next point which the resolution requires  
to be proved, is, that the power over the press qxcr-  
cised by the Sedition Act, is positively forbidden by  
one of the [urfcndments to the Constitutic»i.  
The amendiaont stands in these words—-‘Con*  
gre.ss shall make no law respecting an establish­  
ment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise  
thereof, or abridging the freedom of speech or of  
the press; or the right of^hc people peaceably to  
assemble, and to pe tition the Guvcriiment for a re­  
dress of grievances.”  
In the attemjTts to vindicate tho &#x27;‘Sf^iiition Act,”  
it has been contended, 1. That the “frctilom of  
the press” is to be de ternnned by the meam&#x27;ng of  
these terms in the common law. 2. That tht^ ar­  
ticle sujiposes the power over llie press to be in Con­  
gress, and prohibits them only from abridging the  
freedom alloAved to it by the commmi law.  
Although it will be shewn, in examining the se­  
cond of these position^, that tlie amendment is a  
denial to Congress of all power over the j)ress, it  
may not be u:jeless to make the following observa­  
tions on the first of them.  
It is deemed to be a sound opinion, that the Sedi­  
tion Act, in its definition of some of the crimes cre­  
ated, is an abridgment of tho freedom of })ublica-  
tion, recognized by principles of the common law  
in England.  
The freedom of the press under the common  
law. is. in the defe*nces of the Sedition Act, maileto  
consist in an exemption from all previous restraint  
on printed publications, by persons autliorisenl to in­  
spect and proliiljit them. It appears to tho Com­  
mittee, that thL^ idea of the fVee&#x27;dom of the press,  
can never be admitted to be the American idea of  
it; since a law inflicting penalties on printed publi­  
cations, would have a similar eflect with a laAV au­  
thorising a previous restraint on them. It would  
seem a mockery to say, that no law should bo pass­  
ed, pre\&#x27;enting publications from being made, but  
laws might be passed for punishing them in case  
they should be made.  
I&#x27;lie es.sential difference between the British Go­  
vernment and the American Constitutions, will place  
this subject in the clearest light.  
In the British Gov&#x27;emme*nt, the danger of en­  
croachments on the fights of the People^ is under­  
stood to be confined to the Executive Magistrate.  
The re presentatives of the People hi the Legisla­  
ture, are not only exempt themselves, from distrust,  
but are considered as sufficient guardians of the  
rights of their constituents against the danger from  
the Executive. Hence it is a prhiciple, that the  
Parliament is imlimited in its power; or, in their  
own language, is omnipotent. Hence too, all the  
ramparts for protcieting the rights of the People,  
such as their Magna Charta, their B&gt;11 of Rights,  
(fee., are not reared against the I^niiament, but  
against ^e royal prerogative. They are merely  
Legislative precautions, against Executive usurpa­  
tions. Under such a government as this, an ex­  
emption of tjie press from previous restraint by li­  
censers appointeni by the King, is aU the freedom  
that can be secured to it.  
In the United States, the case is altogether difier-  
ent. The People and not the Government, pos­  
sesses the absoluted sovereignty. The Legislature,  
no less than the Executive, is under limitations of  
power. Encroachments are regarded as possible  
from the onCj as well as from the other. Hence in  
  
a  
governme&#x27;iit as that of Great Biitain. In the latter,  
it i:5 a maxim, that the King, an licreditary, not a  
resj)onsible magittrat(&#x27; can do no wrong; imd that  
the Legislature, which in two-thirds of its compo­  
sition, i.s also here&#x27;ditary. not responsible, can do  
what it pleas* s. In the United State s, the Execu­  
tive Maijistrates art.* not held te&gt; be inlallible*, nor  
the* Legislatures to be omnipotent; and both being  
ek&#x27;ctive, are both responsible. Is it not natural an  
necessary, unde-r such dilierent eiicumstance.s, that  
a ditlereiii di&#x27;j^reo at frectlom, in the use* of th  
pr«“ss, .&#x27;«hould be contemplated  
Is not such an inf&#x27;-reiice favored by what is  
observable in (ire&#x27;at 15ritain itself? Not withstand  
ing the general doctrine of the common law, on tin  
subject of the press, and the occ;isional pimishmeiit  
of those, who use it with a free^elom offensive to  
the Government; it is well known, that with res  
pect to the responsible members of the Govern  
ment. where the rea.sons operating here, heroine ap  
plicable there*, the freedom exercised by the press  
and piotecte&#x27;d by public opinion, far exceeds the  
limits prescribeel by the ordinary rules ot law  
The Mini.stry, who are responsible to impeach  
ment, are at all times animaelverted on by tlie pre^  
j with peculiar freedom; and during the elections  
for the House of Commons, the otlier responsible  
part of the ^»ovcrnine&#x27;nt, the press is employed u illi  
as little reserve towo.rd.-* Candidates.  
The practice in .Vmerica must be t&#x27;ntitled to much  
more respect. In every State probably in the  
Union, the press has exertetl a fret&#x27;dom in canvass­  
ing the merits ;uid measures of public men, of eve­  
ry description, wliich has not been confined to the  
strict limits of the common law. On this footing  
the freedom of the pre&#x27;ss has stood; on this footing  
it y» t stands. And it will not be a breach, either of  
tiUth or of c^mlor, to say, that no persons or pre.ss-  
e‘S are in the habit of more unrestraine*d animadver-  
.‘^ions on the proceedinirs and functionaries of the  
State (^ox&#x27;ernments. than the persons and presses  
most zealous in vindicating tlie act of Congress for  
punishing similar animadversions on the Govern­  
ment of the United States.  
I&#x27;he last remark vrill not be tmderstood, as claim­  
ing for the State Goveniments. an immunity greater  
than they have her»&#x27;tofore enjoye“d. Some elegree  
of abuse is inse^parable from the proper use of eve­  
ry thing; and in no instance is this more true, than  
in that of the pre ss. It has accordingly bf&#x27;en de­  
cided by the practice of the States, that it is better  
to have a few of its no.tious bnmches, to their luxu­  
rious growth, than by priming them away, to in­  
jure the vigor of those yielding the proper fruits.  
And can the wisdom of this policy be doubted by  
any ^vho reflect, that to tlie press alone, che^quere d as  
it is with abuses, the world is indebted for all the&#x27;  
triumphs which have been gained by reason and  
humanity, over error and ojipression; who refb ct.  
that to the same beneficriii source, tiie Uiutetl Stat s  
owe miich of the lights which iiductcdthem to th*^  
rank of a free and indcpende*nt nation: anl which  
have improved the*ir political system into a shape  
so auspicious to their happine.«s. Hael “ Sedition  
Acts,” forbidding every publication that might bring  
the constituted agents into conte^mpt or disrepute^, or  
that might excite the hatred of the people against  
the authors of unjust or pernicious me^asures. been  
imiformly enforced against the press: might not  
the United State&#x27;s have been languishing at this day.  
under the infirmitie*s of a sicKiy confeeleration?  
Might they not, possibly, bo miserable colonieS;  
groaning under a foreign yoke?  
To these observations, one fact will be ad­  
ded, which demonstrates that the connnon law can­  
not be admitteel as the universal expositor of Amer­  
ican terms, which maybe the Siime with those con-  
taineel in that law.—The freedom of coneieince, and  
of religion, are found in the same instruments,  
which assert the freedom of the press. It will never  
be admitted, that the meaning of the former, in  
the common law of England, is to lunit their mean  
ing in the United States.  
Whatever weight may be allowed to these con­  
siderations, the Committee do not, however, by any  
means intend to rest the question on them. They  
contend that the article of the amendment, instead  
of supposing in Congress a power that might be ex­  
ercised over the press, provided its freedom was  
not abridged, was meant as a posuive denial to Con­  
gress, of any power whatever on the subject.  
To demonstrate that this was the true object of  
the article, it will be sufficient to recall the circum­  
stances Avhich led to it, and to refer to the explana­  
tion accompaning the article.

be not both necessary and proper to carry into exe­  
cution an express power : above all, if it be expic^  
Iv forbidden, by a declaratoiy amendinent to lhc

And might it not be asked in turn, whether it is  
not more probable under all the circumstancf s hicli

it may iiap.pi n, thvsl eilinr ed tliese branches oi the  
CJovcrmnent may not hav duly dischaiged its trust;  
il is natural an 1 })ro]&#x27;»er, that accouiing to the cause  
and degree of their faults, they should be brought  
into ce&#x27;iiteinpt or disi*. pule and mcur liio nalred of  
the people.  
3. Wh. iher it has. iti any case, happened that the  
p»rocedings of litliei. or all ol laose branches e\in-  
ces such a violation of duty as to justify a contempt,  
a disrepute, or hatred among the people, can only  
bed termined by a free txannnation iheriof, and a  
free comniunica&#x27;tion among the people thereon.  
4 ^V&#x27;h&#x27;n vt:r it may have actually happened,  
that proceedmgs oi that sort arc chargealde on all  
or eiihcr uf tiie branches of the (j»oveanment, it is  
ihe&#x27; duty as w II as th&#x27;^ right of intellig nt ;uid faith­  
ful citizens to discuss and promulg&#x27;&quot; tlu m freely, as  
well to control them by the censorship of the pub­  
lic opinion. t;s to piomotc a remieiy accoidin^ to  
tlic rules of the* Constilulion. Anl it cannot be  
avoided, that those v.dio arc to apply the remedy  
miisl ft el, in some df gree, a contenq.l or hatred  
g.dnst lh(&#x27;t ansgressing paity.  
As the act wa.s nass^&#x27;d on .Tuly I L I/Ob, and  
is to be in force unt.i *&gt;l;:rch o, Ic^Ol, it \\.ts. ol  
course, that ebirmg its continuance, two elections of  
the e ntn&#x27;o Tlouse of R. j)r s^ ntati\e&#x27;S. an oiecla.^n of  
a part of the S nab&#x27;, and an election of a Piesi-lent  
vrore to take place.  
G. Tiiat conscquf mly, during all these el:ctions,  
intended by the constitution to preserve the purity,  
or to purge the faults of the administration, the great  
rcmc&#x27;lial rights of tho peeiple wxro to be (xercisrd,  
and the rcspontsibihty of their puohc ageius to be  
skrerncd, under the penalties of this act.  
?Jay it not be asked of every intellig.^nt friend to  
the hlWlesof this country, vchcthcr the power ex­  
ercised in such an act as tbi.s, ouglitnot to produce  
great and universal alarm? Whether a rigid ex­  
ecution of such an act, in time past, would not have  
repressed that i.iformation and communication among  
the neople which is mdispcnsable to the just exei-  
cise of their electoral rights? And whether such  
an act, if made povpetual, and inforced with rigour,  
would not, in tinie to come, either destroy our free  
Qf governmciit. or pieparc a coiivulsion tnat  
might prove equally filial to it?  
In answer to sucli qu- stions, it has 1 &quot;fn pieaetrd  
that the writings and publications foibidlLn by the  
act are those only which arc false and malicious,  
and intended to defame: and merit is claimed for the  
privilege allowed to authors to justify, b}&#x27;proving  
the truth of tlicir publications, and for the liinita-  
tions U) Avhicli the scntenco of fine and imprisoii-  
mcnt is subjected.  
To those who concurred in the act, under the ex­  
traordinary belief that the opinion lay betuecn the  
passin&#x27;T of such an act, and leaving m force the com­  
mon l?w of libels, which punishes truth equally  
withf^ilsehoods; and submits fmeanl imprisonment  
to the inedfinite di.screti.^n of the court, the merit of  
rood intentions ought surely not to be refused. A  
like merit may perhaps be duo for the discontin­  
uance of the corporal punishment, which the com­  
mon law also leaves to the discretion of the court.  
This merit of intention, howev&#x27;er, would have been  
oTOiiter, if the several mitigations had not been  
fimited to so short a period ; and the apparent iiy  
consistency would have been avoided between justi­  
fying the act at one time, by contrasting it with the  
rigors of the commom law otherwise in force; and  
at another time, bv appo-iling to the nature of the

the cnquir}&#x27;, how far the maliv-’/j of tho inunt is i.ri  
inference of the liw from the nv ro publication; it  
is manifestly impossible to punish ihe intent to bring  
those who adminii-ter the government into disrepnt *  
or con&#x27;empt, vrithout spiking at the right of freely  
discussing public charactcrs and measures; bccaUso  
those who engage in such discussiorvs. must expect  
and intend to excite these unfavorable scntimtnts,  
so ftr as they may be thought to be deserved, &#x27;i’vi  
prohibit, therefore, lire intent to excite those unf.iV0-  
rable sentiments against those who administer th-j  
Crovernment, is equivalent to ti prohibition of the  
actual excitement of them; and to prohibit the ac­  
tual excitement of them, is equivalent to a prohibi­  
tion of discussions having that tendency and efilct:  
which, again, is equuak nt to a proleclion of those who  
administer the Government, if they should at anv  
time deserve the contempt or hatre-d of tiic people,  
against bt ing exposed to it, by free animadversions  
on their characters and conduct. Nor can there bn  
a doubt, if those in public trust be shielded l&gt;y prii jl  
laws from such strictures of the press as may ex­  
pose the^m to contempt or disrepute, or hatred, v/here  
tiiey may deserve it, that in exact proportion as they  
may deserve to bo r-xposed, will be the certaintj&#x27;  
and criminality of the intent to expose them and  
the vigilance of prosecuting and punishing it; nor  
a doubt, that a Government (bus in&#x27;renched in penal  
statutes, against the just andnaturai eilccts of a cul-  
p-abLj administration. Avili easily evade the rrsponsi

examining and discussing theS3 merits and demerits  
of the candidates respectivei}’. It has been seen,  
that a number of important -rbctions will take pLi&#x27;Z^i  
whilst the act is in force; although it should not bo

Vv-hich by impairing the right of election, en iang-rs

It is with justice, therefore, that the Gaicral A^-  
senibly have affirmed in the rcsohttion, as we-Il tiiat  
the ri^^ht of freely examining public characters  
and imasurcs, and&#x27; of free communication thereon,  
is the only eli&#x27;ectual guardian of every other rignt,  
as that tiiis particular right is levelled at. by tiio  
power exercised in the “ &amp;editicn Act^ ^  
The resolution next in order is as loilows.  
“ Tiiat this State having by its Convention, whtcji

that among other essential rights, ••the libenv ed

abridged, restrained or modified by any authorit\ or

guard these rights from every possible attack of so­  
phistry and ambition, having with other States re-  
cominended an amendment for that purpose, v. Inch

now shown to the most palpable violation of one^of  
the ri£rhts thus declared and secured; and to tne  
establishment of a precedcn^, wliich may be fatal

Ihe fairn^^ss and regularity of the course of the  
piocet&#x27;dmur, here r.ursutd, have not protected it  
a,-am. objections cv.n from sourced too res-  
P&#x27; &#x27;’tahle to be disregarded.  
f belongs to the Judiciary  
of tho Lnittd States, and not to the State  
ture?, to dcclaro the meaning of the Federal&#x27;Con-  
stitution.  
^ Rut a decLaration, tlint proceedings of the Federal  
0-.vernmerit are not warranted by &quot;the Constitution,  
a noveity neitiier among the citizcns, nor amonrr  
pglsktures of tho States; or are the citizens  
or the Legislature of Virginia singular in the ex­  
ample ot it.  
Nor can the declarations of either, whether af-  
firniiug^r denying tho constitutions lity of measures  
of the Federal Government; or whether made be­  
fore or after judicial decisions thereon, be deemed in  
any point of view, an assumption of the office of  
the Judge. The declarations, in such cast s, are  
i.-xpressions of opinion, unaccompanied with any  
oiher^ftfCt ^han what they may produce on opi­  
nion, ^y ^ 6xcitijg reflection. The expositions of  
the Judiciary, on the other hand, are carri.^i into  
immediate rfft.&#x27;t by force. The former may lead  
  
to a cuange in the legislative expression oi tlie  
general will; possibly to a change in the opinion oi  
the Judiciary; the latter enforces the general will,  
whilst that will and that opinion continue un­  
changed.  
And if there be no impropri(ty in declaring the  
unconstitulionality Of proceedings in the F(’deral  
Government, vrhere can be the improprie&#x27;ty of com­  
municating, the declaration to the other States, and  
inviting th* ir concurrence hi a like drciarntion&#x27;/  
What is allowable for one must be allowable for  
all; and a free communication among the  
States, v.&#x27;here the Constitution imposrs no restraint,  
is as tillowable among tiie State Gove&#x27;innK&#x27;nts as  
among f)ther public bodies or private citizens. This  
consideration d( lives a weight that camiot be denial  
to it. from tli(&#x27; relation of the Staff Lngisl;it’ir s to  
the Federal L&#x27;gishiti?re, as tiie immediate constitu­  
ents of one of its bianclus.  
&#x27;J’he Iv gi^&#x27;Litun s of the Stnt s have a right al­  
so to oiiginate amrndments to th(&#x27; Constitution, by  
a concin&#x27;re nee of two-thirds of the u j}olt&#x27; n’amhvr,  
in applications to Congress for lli&#x27;^ purpose, Whm  
new States are to be foinii d l y a iunotion of two  
oi more Stntes or part of States, the L* gi&#x27;l.-jturt s of

Iso to entf!&#x27; into agreement.s or compacts. \^ith tli&#x27;-

(U&#x27;ciarntion of right*?, in Av’nich are two articles pro- cation among them results f.orn the objvCt v.dnch  
vi ling, the one for tho liberty of conscience, the ’■ ■ &#x27; —  
other fbv the freedom of spetcli ;md of the pr( ss.  
Simil i; rccomi!ien:l ;l:oni; having proceeded from  
a number ot otiier St.ites; and Congress, as has  
been set n, h.;-, hi ^ hi consvqurnce tlicreof, an.l with  
a view to ext* nd the ground of public confielencc&#x27;,

•&#x27;onsci&#x27;.nce and cf the press, and Virginia having  
• jn-’urred in rhe ratitication which made them a  
p.irt of the Ccr!.-’iit!itic*n, it v.ill remain with a c ni­  
di! public to decide, whether it would not maik an  
inconsistency and deginore.cy, if an ind:l{erence

prt&#x27;ce.ient therein, &#x27;Viich may be i&#x27;Ktal to tho other,  
the free exercise of religion.  
That the prtcc&#x27;dent estabii.-hed by the violaiien  
of the former of these rights, may, as is afiirmctl  
liy the resolution, be fat&#x27;d to the latt r, appears to

. n which they respectively Vv si; and from tlie scope  
of rea.soning. by which tlie power over the former  
ii&amp;s beenindicated.  
J&#x27;lrst. Both of these rights, the libeity of con-  
S&#x27;de&#x27;nco and of the pvf?s, rest equally on the origi-  
n^il ground of not being delegatul by the C&#x27;^-r.siitu-  
tion, and consequently withheld fVoin the Goveu:-  
laent. Any construction, thcvefbre, that would at­  
tack the original security for the one, must have the  
like efiect on the other.  
Scco?i(lly. They are bolJi equally secured by tlie  
supplement to the Con.nitution : b(hig both iiiclu-  
ded in the same amendment, made at the same time,  
an! by the same authority. Any construction or  
argument, then, which v.&#x27;ould t’li&#x27;n t!ie amendnunt  
into a grant or acknowledgme nt of power Avith res-  
pcct to the press, might bo equally applied to the  
freedom of religion.  
Thirdly. If it be admitted that the extent of the  
freedom of the press, secured by tJi^* amentlme/ir, is  
to be mcasureel by the common law on this subject,  
t*i3Sanic authority may be rcsoited to, for the stan-  
ebrd vrhich is to fix the extent of the ** free exercise  
of religion.” It cannot be nrce.v^ary to say what  
this standard would be; whether the common hv/  
bo takrn solel}^ as the unwritten, or as varied l.y  
the written law cf Engkm i.  
Fovrthly. If the words end phrases in tho  
r-ilFTidmfflit the limitation that  
iN freedom be net abii-lgfd, the same article results  
Horn the same con.sideraiion, for a power over the  
rcis&#x27;&#x27;- of religion, im ier ilie limitation that its  
Jrcedom he not prohibited.  
For if Jongress may regulate the freedom of the  
provided they do not abridge it, because it is  
sail eaily, “they shall not abridge it,” and is not  
&gt;:n], ‘-they shall make no law respecting itthe

party to pass them.  
  
It may, however, be contended that this authority to legislate  
is given to Congress by the 18th clause of sec. 8, art. 1, of the  
Constitution: “And to make all laws which shall be necessary  
and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers and  
all other powers vested by this Constitution in the govern-

ment of the United States or in any department or officer  
thereof.”’  
  
Judge Story says, in his Commentary, sec. 1238: “The plain  
import of this clause is, that Congress shall have all the incidental  
and instrumental powers necessary and proper to carry into exe-  
cution all the express powers. It neither enlarges any power  
specifically granted, nor is it a grant of any new power to Con-  
gress.””  
  
This case, then, is not embraced by the first part of the section,  
because it is not one of the “foregoing”? enumerated powers.  
Nor is it included under the other term, “all other powers vested,”  
because there is no power vested, for the learned commentator  
just alluded to, says it means express powers.  
  
Speaking of the Constitution, we are told in Hunter’s Lessee  
ad. Martin, 1 Wheat. 326, the government of the United States  
can claim no powers which are not granted to it by the

uses this language: &quot; Now, whether the phrases in  
question be construed to authorise any measure relat­  
ing to the common defence and general welfare, as con­  
tended by some, or any measure only in winch there  
might be an application of money, as suggested by the  
caution of others, the effect must subsiant.ally be the  
same in destroying the import and force of the particu­  
lar enumeration of powers which follow these  
phrases in the Constitution. For, it is evident, that  
there is not a single power whatever, which may not  
have some reference to the common defence and gene­  
ral welfare ; nor a powir of any magnitude, which, in  
its exercise, does not involve or admit an application ol  
money. The Government, therefore, which possesses  
power in either one or other of these extents, is a Go­  
vernment without the &quot;limitation formed by a particu­  
lar enumeration of powers.&quot; The power ot the Gene­

Legislature of the State, and the purchase1 of the bonds.  
The venerable James Madison, on a certain occasion, uses  
the following language :  
  
“The people, not the government, possess the absolute sovereignty.  
The Legislature, no less than the Executive, is under limitations of  
power. Encroachments are regarded as possible from one, as well  
as from the other. Hence the great and essential rights of the people  
are secured against legislative, as well as executive ambition. They  
are secured not only by laws paramount to prerogative, but by con-  
stitutions paramount to laws.”

\i hatever room might be found in the pro­  
ceedings of some of the States, who have  
disapproved of the resolutions of the Gener­  
al Assembly of this Commonwealth, passed  
on the 91st day of December, 1798, for pain­  
ful remarks on the spirit and manner of those  
proceedings, it appears to the committee most  
consistent with the duty, as well as dignity,  
u; the General Assembly, to hasten an ob­  
livion of every circumstance which might be  
construed into a diminutii a of mutual res­  
pect. confidence, and affection, among the  
members of the Union.  
The ct mmittee have deemed it a mors  
useful task to revise with a critical eye the  
resolutions which have met with this dis­  
approbation; to examine fully the several  
objections and arguments which have ap­  
peared against them ; and to inquire whether  
there be any errors of fact, ol’ principle, or  
of reasoning, which the candor of the Gen­  
eral Assembly ought to acknowledge and  
correct.  
  
FIRST RESOLUTION-.  
The first of the resolutions is in the words  
following:  
&#x27;•ficsulvcd. That the General Assembly  
o( V irginia doth unequivocally express a linn  
resolution to maintain and defend the Con­  
stitution of tlie United States, and the Con­  
stitution of this State against every aggres­  
sion, either foreign or domestic, and that they  
will support the Government of the United  
States :u all measures warranted by the for­  
mer.”  
No unfavorable comment can have been  
made on the sentiments here expressed. To  
maintain and defend the constitution of the  
United States, and of their own State, against  
every aggression, both foreign and domestic,  
mil to support the Government of the Uni­  
ted States in all measures warranted by their  
constitution, are duties which the General  
Assembly ought always to feel, and to which,  
m such tin occasion, it was evideutlv prop­  
er to express their sincere and firm ailher­  
itice.  
SECOND RESOLUTION&#x27;.  
In their next resolution—&quot;The Genera  
Assembly most solemnly declares a warm  
ittachnumt to the Union of the States, to  
maintain which,it pledges all its power; and  
feat, for this end, it is their duty to watch  
aver and oppose ever, infraction of those  
principles which constitute the only basis ol  
that Union, because a faithful observance of  
them can alone secure its existence and the  
public happiness.”  
Til ation^just made Is i tally ap­  
plicable to this solemn declaration of warm  
attachment to the I nion, and this solemn  
pledge to maintain it; nor can any question  
arise, among the enlightened friends of the  
Union, as to ilieditiv of watching over and  
opposing every infraction oi those principles  
which constitute its basis, and a faithful ob­  
servance ol which can alone seem:;: its cxi -  
tence, and the public happiness thereon de­  
ding.  
THIRD RESOLUTION’.  
The third resolutiolion is in the word­  
following :  
‘■&#x27;1 hat this Assembly’ doth exj licitlv and  
peremptorily declare, that it views the &#x27; pow­  
ers oi tin Federal Government as resulting  
from the compart to which the Slates are  
parlies, us limited by the plain sense and in­  
tention of the instrument constituting ihe  
compact—ns no further valid than they are  
atilhoiizcd by the grants enumerated in that  
compact; and that in ease of a deliberate,  
palpable, and dangerous exercise of other  
powers, not granted by the said compact, the  
.&#x27;’tarns who are parties then to have the right,  
and are in duty bound, to interpose, for ar­  
resting the progress of the evil, and for main­  
taining, within their respective limits, the  
authorities, rights, and liberlie&#x27;, appertaining  
t &gt; them.”  
On this resolution the committee have be­  
stowed all the attention w hich its importance  
merits. They have scanned it not merely5  
with a strict, but with a severe eye: and they  
feel confidence in pronouncing, that, in its  
just and fair construction, it is uucxeeption­  
itldy’ true in its several positions, as well as  
constitutional and conclusive in its inferen­  
ces.  
  
The resolution declare&#x27;, firs&#x27;, that 4*il vie wi­  
the powers of t]je Federal (iovcniment. a­  
resulting from the compact to which the  
Stales are parties;&#x27;’ in other words, that the  
Federal powers are derived from the Consti­  
tution; and that the Constitution is a compact  
to which the States tire parties.  
Clear as the position must seem, lhat the  
Federal powers are derived from the Consti­  
tution, and from that alone, the committee  
are not unapprized of a late doctrine, which  
opens another source of Federal power, not  
less extensive and important, than it is new  
ami unexpected. The examination of this  
doctrine will be most conveniently connec­  
ted with a review of a succeeding rr.-olution.  
The committee satisfy themselves here with  
briefly remarking, that in all the contempo­  
rary discussions and comments which th  
Constitution underwent, it was constantly  
justified and recommended, on the ground  
that the powers not given to the government  
were withheld from it; and that if any doubt  
could have existed on this subject, under the  
original text of the Constitution, it is re­  
moved, as far as words could remove it, by  
the 10th amendment, now a part of the Con­  
stitution, which expressly declares “that the  
powers not delegated to the l nited States, by  
tite Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the  
States, are reserved to the States respectively,  
or to the people.”  
The other position involved in this brand  
of the resolution, namely: “that the State­  
are parlies to the Constitution or compact,’  
is, in the judgment of the committee, equal­  
ly free from objection. It is indeed true tha  
the term “S.a .*3” is sometimes used in a va­  
gue sense, and sometimes in a different sense  
according to the subject to which it is ap  
plied Thus, it sometimes means the sepa  
  
rate sections of territory &lt;&gt;. w; Yd ! ■ t!w  
j political societies within each; sometime:;  
the particular Government cmi’disltcd 1  
those societies; sometimes those societies t.&lt;  
| organized into those particular Governments;  
and, lastly, it means the people composing  
those political societies, in their highest sov­  
; creign&#x27;capacity. Although it might l e wi he*i  
that thfperfection of language admitted less  
• diversity in the signification of the same  
words, yet little inconvenience is produced  
by it where the true sense ran be collected  
with&#x27;Srertaintv from the ilitii; nt application  
fn the present instance, whatever different  
constructions of die term “.State,” in the re. -  
olntion, may have been entertained, all will at  
least concur in the hist mentioned; because,  
in that sense the Constitution was submitted  
to the “States;” in that sa (he -Sta’-. &quot;  
j ratified it: and ill that sea ■ &lt;&gt;f the t; r  
“States” they&#x27; are eon: parti&quot; : t&lt;&gt;&#x27;  
| die compact from which the powers of the  
j (federal Government result.  
The next position is that the General As­  
sembly views the powers of the I\-dotal Gov­  
ernment “as limited by the plain • ., -e and  
intention of the instrument constituting that j  
compact,” and “as no farther valid than they]  
] are authorized by the grunts therein etnimer-j  
; a ted.” It does not seem pos- ilde that any |  
j jnst objection can lie against either of those  
clauses. The fir-1 amounts merely to a th e-j  
i iaration that the compact ought to have the  
] interpretation plainly intend bv the parlies to J  
i it; the other, to a declaration that it ought to  
have the execution and effect intended by  
j them. If the powers granted he valid, it is  
: solely because they are granted: and, if the  
granted powers are valid, because granted,  
till other powers not granted must not be  
| valid.  
The rcsoluti: n having taken this view &lt; f  
the Federal compact, proceeds to infer, “that,  
in ruse of a deliberate, palpable, and danger­  
ous exercise, of other powers, not granted!  
by the said compact, the States who are par-I  
ties thereto have the right, and are in dutv  
hound, to interpose for arresting the progress  
. of the evil, and for irmintai: ing, within their  
respective limits, the authorities, tY-hm, and  
liberties, appertaining to them.”  
It appears to your committee to be a plain  
principle, founded in common sense, iilu, -  
, trated by common practice, and essential to  
the nature of compacts—that where resort  
| can be had to no tribunal superior to the au­  
thority of the parties, the parties tliem.-elvea  
; must be the rightful judges, in the last resort,  
! whether the bargain made has been pursued  
| or violated. The constitution of the United  
| States was formed by the sanction of the  
State?, given by each in its sovereign cupac­  
. ity. it adds to the stability and dignity, as  
well as to the authoiity of the Constitution,  
that it t. sts on this li gitimate and solid foun:  
« . Fit States, then, being th \
to the constitutional compact, and in their  
sovereign capacity, it follows of nece-.-itv  
that there can be no tribunal above their au­  
thority, to deride, in the last resort, whether  
| the compact made hv them he violated; and  
I consequently, that, as the parties to it, they  
mu -t themselves decide, in the ho t resort,  
such questi »ns as may be of sufficient mag­  
nitude to require their interposition.  
ft does not follow, how rv *, that because  
die States, a? sovereign parties to their eon­  
: stiiutional compact, must ultimately decide  
wit deer it has beet) viola! d, that such a de­  
1 vision ought to be inlerpos &gt;d either in a has­  
ty manner or on doubtful and inferior occa­  
sions. liven in tlm case of o ... •, ct  
veutions between different tuitions, where,  
by the slii t rule of interpretation, a bleach  
of a part may be deemed a breach of the j  
whole—every part being deemed a condition  
of every other part, and of the whole—it is  
always laid down that the breach mast lm  
both wilful and material, to justify an appli­  
cation of the rule. But in the case of an in­  
timate and constitutional Union, like that of  
the United States, it is evident that the inter­  
position of the parties, in their sovereign ca­  
pacity, rail he culled for by nccash ns only,  
1 decide atld essentially* a I Ye h; or the 11 a I nrin­  
  
cipli&#x27;&#x27; of their political system.  
The resolution has, accordingly, guarded j  
against any misapprehension of its object, i  
by expressly requiring for Mich an interpo­  
sition “the case of a d lib: rale, pal pah/;•, |  
am! dangerous breach of the constitution.!  
by the exercise of powers ml granted bv it.”  
It must be a case not of a light and transient j  
nature, but of a nature dangerous to the great!  
purpose:; for which the constitution was es­  
tablished. It mil t be a ease, moreover, not.  
obscure or doubtful in its construction, but  
plain and palpable. Lastly, it must be a j  
case not resulting from a partial considers- !  
lion, or hasty determination; but a cn e  
stamped with a final consideration ami dclib-l  
irate adherence. It is not necessary, be­  
cause the resolution does not require that  
the question should he diseu-.-ed, how far  
the exercise of any particular power, mi-1  
granted by the constitution, would justify!  
the interposition of the parties to it. As ea- j  
ses might easily be stated, which none would !  
contend ought to fall within that description;!  
cases on the oilier hand might i.ilh equal)  
ease, be stated, so flagrant and so fatal, as to !  
unite every opinion in placing them within:  
the deseiiption.  
iint the resolution has done more than  
guard against misconstruction, by expressly  
reforing to eases of a deliberate, palpable, ,  
and dangerous nature. It specifies the ob­  
ject of the interposition which it contem­  
plates, to be solely that of arresting the pro­  
gress of the evil of usurpation, and of main­  
taining the authorities, rights, and liberties,  
appertaining to the States, as parties to the  
Constitution.  
From this view of the resolution, it would  
seem inconceivable that it can incur any just  
disapprobation from those who, laying aside  
all momentary impressions, and recollecting  
the genuine source and object ol the Feder­  
al Constitution, shall candidly and accurate­  
ly interpret the meaning of the General As­  
sembly. If the deliberate exercise of dan­  
gerous powers, palpably withheld by the  
constitution, could not justify the parties to  
it in interposing, even so far as to arrest the  
progress of the evil, and thereby to preserve  
the constitution itself, as well as to provide  
for the safety of the parties to it, there would  
be a;, en 1 to all relief from usurped power,  
anti a direct subversion of the rights speci­  
fied or recognized under all the State Coi­  
  
siituiior. , us well as a plain denial of the  
fundamental principle on which our inde­  
pendence itseli&#x27; was declared.  
Bui it is objected, /hat the Judicial author­  
ity 13 to he regarded as the sole expositor oh  
the constitution, in the hen resort; and it  
nitty headed lor what reason the declara­  
tion hy the General hsm mbly, supp&lt; sing it  
to hie theoretnruliy true, could be required  
at the present day, and in so solemn a man­  
ner.  
On tiii.s objection, it might he observed,  
f&#x27;!&#x27;&#x27;i!.* that there may IroB.Gances ol* usurped  
power, which the tonus ol the constitution  
would never draw within the control of the  
Judicial department: x-cond/i/, that if the de­  
cision ol tin* Judiciary be raised above the  
nulhoi ay of the sovereign parties to the con­  
stitution, the decisions of the other depart­  
ment;, not carried by the forms of the con­  
stitution before the Judiciary, must he equal­  
ly ssninritalive and iniul with the decisions  
of the department.  
But the proper answer to the objection is,  
that the resolution of the General Assembly  
relates to those great and extraordinary rases  
in which all the hunts of the constitution  
may prove itiell! etuaJ against infractions dan­  
gerous to the essential rights ol the parties  
to it. The re-olution supposes that danger­  
ous powers, not delegated, may not only be  
usurped mid executed by the “other depart­  
ments, but that the Judicial department also  
may exercise or sanction dangerous powers,  
beyond the grant of the constitution; and,  
consequently, that the ultimate right of the  
parties to the constitution to judge whether  
the compact ha ; 1 ; rn dangerous!-/ violated,  
must extend to violations by one delegated  
authority; us well as hy another; by tin;  
Judiciary, as well as by the Executive or the  
I.cgi: luture.  
I !o-.\ ever true, therefore, it may he that  
the Judicial department is, in all questions  
submitted to it by the forms of the consti­  
tution, to decide in the last resort, this resort  
1 : ce ■•Oily I •• di&#x27;ciiii ,! tin- la: l in rcla­  
lion to the authorities of the other depart­  
ments ot the Guv-mment; not in relation to  
the rights of the parlies to the constitutional  
compact, from which the Judicial as well as  
the other deputin&#x27; ms, hold their delegated  
trusts. On any other hypothesis, the dele­  
gation ot judicial power would annul the  
authority delegating it; and the concurrence  
ol this department u itli the others in usurped  
powers, might sr.bv.nl forever, and beyond  
the possible reach of any rightful remedy;  
the very Constitution which till were insti­  
tuted to preserve.  
&#x27;i he truth declared in the resolution being  
established, the expediency of making the  
declaration at the present dav may safely he  
left to the temperate consideration and can­  
d: , judgment ol the Am.-,-lean public. It  
will be remembered, that a frequent recur­  
rence to fundamental principles is rolcmnly  
enjoined by most of the Suite Constitutions,  
and particularly by our own, as a necessary  
safeguard against the danger of degeneracy  
to which Republic are liable, us well as oth­  
er Government.-, though in u less degree than  
others. And a fair Comparison of dm po­  
litical doctrines not (infrequent at the pres­  
ent day, with tho;’o which char.-ietmi/.ed the  
epoch of our Revolution, and which form  
the l&gt;a«is of our republican constitutions,  
will best determine whether the declaratory  
recurrence It re made to those principle’s  
ought to be viewed as unseasonable and im­  
prop&#x27;-r, or a vigilant discharge of an impor­  
tant duty. The authority of constitutions  
over governments, am! of the sovereignly of  
the people over constitutions are truths which  
are at all times necessary to be kept in mind;  
and at no time, perhaps, more necessary than  
at present.  
  
Foi.&#x27;irn riKsor.c rio.v.  
rJ&#x27;&#x27;• !&#x27;ourt!i iv ■ &gt;Iu;i &gt;.i stands Jim follows:  
“Tint the ( i.mi .,,1 A • -nhiy doth also  
express its deep regret that a spirit has, in  
sundry instances, been manifested bv the  
federal Government, to enlarge its powers,  
by forced constructions of the constitutional  
chatter which defines them; and that indica­  
tions have appeiuv 1 ot a de-nit to expound  
certain general plua*es which, having been  
copied from the very limited grant of powets  
itl the former Articles ui (lotdedi ration, were  
the less liable to he misconstrued,) sons to  
destroy the meaning and elii&#x27;ct of the partic­  
ular ennner lliou whielt mrcs.-arilv explains  
and limits the general phrases, and so as to  
consolidate the State ■ by degrees, into one  
stiver, i :nly; the obvious tendency and inevi­  
table result of which would he to transform  
the present Republican system of the United  
States into an absolute, or at best a mixed,  
monarchy.”  
The first question here to be considered i  
whether a spirit has, in sundry instances,  
been manifested by the Federal Government  
to enlarge its powers by forced constructions  
of the constitutional charter.  
Tho General Assembly, having declared  
their opinion merely by regretting in gene­  
ral terms that forced constructions for enlar­  
ging the federal powers have taken place, it  
does not appear to the committee necessary  
to go into a specification of every instance to  
which the resolution may allude, The Alien  
and Sedition Acts being particularly named  
. iii&#x27;.t succeeding resolution, are of course to be  
understood as included in the allusion. Omit­  
ting others which have less occupied public  
attention, or been less extensively regarded  
as unconstitutional, the resolution may be  
presumed to refer particularly to the Hank  
Raw, which, from the circumstances of its  
passage, as well as the latitude of construc­  
tion on w hj&lt; h it isfouu  
lion with singular force; and the Carriage  
Tax, distinauished also by circumstances in  
its history having a similar tendency. Those  
instances alone, if resulting from forced con­  
struction, and calculated to enlarge the pow­  
ers of the Federal Gouernment, as the com­  
mittee cannot but conceive to be the case,  
sufficiently warrant this part of the resolu­  
tion. The Committee have pot thought it in­  
eumb it on them to extend thur attention to  
laws which have been objected to, ra.her ;t­  
varying the constitutional distribution of pow­  
ers in the Federal Government, than as a:i  
absolute enlargement of th-in; becau-e in­  
stance; of this s &gt;rt. however important in  
tie ir principles and tendencies, do not ap­  
pear to fall strictly within ths text unde,  
review.

ii&#x27;i&gt;ni the “ArlicVs ()j&#x27; Oo&amp;idmxrtion,” so a.-,  
to destroy the ©licet of t&#x27;» - particular eimmc­  
ration explaining and limiting their meaning.  
2. Whether this expo- :::&gt;n Would In­  
&gt; rees consolidate the Stiles into one sm r­  
fignty. Whether the )■ uVnevand result  
of this eontKiliddfioii wr.trti! he to transform  
die Republican system of the United Slates in­  
to a monarchy.  
1. The general phrnwajiere meant, must  
he tlio-e “of providing i&#x27;oy the common do­  
fenre and general welfare.”  
In the “Articles of (Jo ti fed oral ion,” the |  
phrases are used as follows, in Article VIII:  
“All charges of war. and nil other expenses  
that shall he incurred./br /,&#x27;,&lt;• common drfener  
mid gi’urni! welfare, and. allowed hv the U.  
States in ( mngr- ^ Essemh!e.l. shall h ■ defray­  
ed out of a common ! miry, which shall  
h&quot; supplied hy the at ■ St ccs m propor­  
tion to the value of till land within each Stale,  
granted to or surveyed for unv person, as  
Mich land and the buildings nnd improve­  
ments thereon shall he estimated, according  
to such mode the United Stall , in Con­  
gress a enihh I, shall from time to time di­  
rect and appoint.&quot;1  
In the existing Constitution, they make  
the following part of Section 8: “The Con­  
gress shall have power to lav and collect  
taxc-&#x27;, duties&#x27;, impost.:, nun excises, to pe.v  
the debts and provide for the common defence  
and general welfare of the United States,”  
i his similarity in .he use of these phraser  
in the t&quot; o great federal charter::, might well  
he eon. idered as rendering their meaning less­  
liable lobe misconstrued in the latter,because  
it will scarcely be said that in the former  
they were ever understood to he either a  
general grant id power, or to authorize, the  
requisition or application of money hy the  
Congress to the common defence and general  
wi ll.ire, except in the ea e afterwards ©nu­  
merated, which explained and limited their  
uieaiiintj; and d such was the limited mean­  
ing attached to these phrases in the very in­  
strument revised and remodelled hv the pres­  
ent ( oiislitntion, it ran never he supposed  
that, when copied into this constitution, a  
dillerent meaning might to ho attached to  
  
morn.  
I Iml. notwithstanding this icmarknble se­  
curity against ini. construction, u design has  
keen indicated to expound these phrases in  
dm &lt; &#x27;(institution so its to destroy the effect  
ol the particular enum-intion of powers by  
I which it explain,; and limits them, must have  
kid1 a Hi id: r the mIimtv.i! ion of those v.&#x27;lio have  
attended to the course ol public transactions  
• &gt; oi to multiply proofs otl this {adject, it  
&quot; ill stiflin&#x27; to refer to the debates of the red­  
era! Legislature, in which arguments have on  
dilleronl octet ions been draw n, with apparent  
eiiect, from these phrases, in their indefinite  
meaning.  
&#x27;1 o these indications might he added, without  
looking farther, the oflieial Report on .Man­  
tilacttii-es, hy the late .Secretary of the Treas­  
ury, made on the oth of Decernlier, 1701;  
ianti the Report of a Committee of Congress,  
in .limitary, 1707, on the promotion of \gri­  
ctdfttre. In the first of the°e it is expres-lv  
contented to belong “to the discretion of the  
National 1.&quot;gislaturo to pronounce upon the  
I objects which concern the general ii&#x27;i l fare,  
anil for which, under that discretion, an ap­  
propriation is requisite and proper. And  
‘ there act in to he no room for a doubt that  
whatever concerns the general interests of  
I.l&#x27;.VIlM.XO, of Aonif I. I t Iltt, of MANITACT­  
i it.. ,, and of c(&gt;v,vi;;n.■are within the  
spltcrt! of the National Councils, as far as  
regards on application of mou w/.” &#x27;J’lie lat­  
ter Report as- tunes die same latitude of (low­  
er in the National Councils, and applies it  
to the cncoiitagvuient of Agricultmc, by  
means of a society to he established at the  
scat of government. Although neither ol  
the e reports may have received the sanction  
of a law carrying it into eiiect, yet, on the  
i outer hand, the extraordinary doctrine con­  
i tainc.l in both has pa in- 1 without the slight­  
est p itive mark, ol di -approbi tion from the  
authority to which it was addressed.  
Now whether the phrases in question he  
construed to authorize every measure relating  
to the common defence and general wellire,  
as contended by some—or every measure on­  
ly :n which Ilf re might he an application of  
money, as suggested by the caution of others  
—the eiiect must substantially be the Mime  
in •*’“&#x27;* lying the import and ftn * e of the par­  
ticular enumeration of powers which follow  
the.-” general phrases in the Constitution —  
for it is evident that there is not a single  
power whatever which may not have some  
reference to the common defence or the gen­  
eral wt ] arc; nor a p over of any magnitude,  
u hich, iii it; exercize, does not involve or  
admit tin application of money. The Gov­  
ernment, therefore, which possesses power  
in either one or other of these extents, is a  
government without the limitations formed hy  
a particular enumeration of power-; and, con­  
sequently, the meaning ami effect of this  
particul.ir enumeration it destroyed by the  
exposition given to these general phrases.  
This conclusion will not be affected by an  
attempt to quality the power over the ‘-gen­  
eral welfare,” by referring it to cases where  
the general v: If on.r is beyond the reach ol  
sc parole provisions by the huliriduot States,  
and leaving to the -u their jurisdictions in ru­  
; to which their separate provisions may  
Im competent. * For, as the authority of the  
individual States must in till cases be incom­  
petent to general regulations operating  
through the whole, the authority of the Uni­  
ted Suites would be extended to every ohjee  
relating to the general welfare, which might  
by any possibility, b - provided for by th;  
general authority, This qualifying construc­  
tion, therefore, would have little, if uriv, ten­  
dency to circimtst ribe the po wer claimed un­  
der the latitude of the terms •• rencral wel­  
fare”  
The true and fair construt tion of this ex­  
pression, both in the original and existing  
i eJeral compacts, appears to the Committee  
too obvious to be mistaken. In ba|h, the  
Congress is authorized to provide inortey lof  
. , t  
ft both, is subjoined to this atrhorily an enu­  
meration of the e ls&#x27;-, to which their power­  
shall extend. Money cannot be applied u

it may not he Improper, however, to remark

H properly defined by the Constitution, the  
difficulty ol accommodating I: ,11 regulations  
to a country so great in extent and so various  
in i! rirruiiisitii-,c,&#x27;-i, has h. rn much felt; and  
has led to o&lt; ea ioie.1 itivc-tinents of power  
in the Executive, which involve perhaps its  
hi ::&lt;• a portion ol discretion as can lie deemed  
consistent with the nature ol the Kxeetitiva  
trust. Irt proportion as the chji ets of legis­  
live rare might he multiplied, would the tuna  
allowed for each he diminished, and the dif­  
ficulty ol providing uniform and particular  
regulations lor r.&#x27;l he increased. From  
these soil!ecs would ncee. sat&#x27;ilv ensue a  
greater latitu le to the agency of that de­  
partment which i- always in existence, and  
which could he-1 mould re. illations of a (run­

of particular .situation;. And it is in this lati­  
tude, as a supplement tiyh1&#x27;ih h. &#x27;i&#x27;-ncv of the.

would render the (lections to it so violent  
and corrupt tli t the public voire itself might

Acts,&#x27;&#x27;1 passed at the last session of Con  
press; the first which exercises a power no  
where delegated to the Federal Government  
tnd which, by uniting Legislative and Judi  
■ial powers to those of Executive, subvert!  
he general principles of a free government  
is well as the particular organization ant  
positive provisions &lt; i the Federal Constilu  
ion ; and the other of which acts exorcises  
n like manner, a power not delegated b\
he Constitution; but, on the contrary, ex  
ircssiy and positively forbidden by one o  
he amendments thereto: a power which  
norc than any other, ought to produce uni  
.’crsal alarm; because it is levelled agains  
he right ol freely examining public character,  
md measures, and of free communicatioi  
imong the people thereon, which has eve  
teen justly deemed the only cii’eelual guar  
!ian ol every other right ”  
9 he subject of this resolution having, i  
1 presumed, more particularly led the Gen  
■ral Assembly into the proceedings w hie!  
hey communicated to the other States, am  
icing itself of peculiar importance, it de  
erves the most critical and faithful investi­  
gation ; for the length of which, no othe:  
pology will lie necessary.  
&#x27;l&#x27;lie subject divides itself into, /?/* ;/, ‘Tilt  
•lien Act;’ secondly, ‘The Sedition Act.’  
Ol the ‘Alien Act,’ it is affirmed by t!;-.  
’(&#x27;solution, 1st. &#x27;i hat it exercises a powei  
lowhere delegated to the Federal govern­  
uent. 2d. That it unites Legislative ant  
udicial powers to those of the Executive  
&#x27;d. That this union of power subverts tin  
;eneral principles of free government. -1th  
l.at it subverts the particular organir.alioi  
nd positive provisions of the Federal Con  
  
Utulion.  
In order !o clear the way for a correct view  
■I ihc iir.si position, several observations wil  
e premised.  
!:■ t!ie first place it is to be borne in mind  
hat, it being a characteristic feature of tin  
’cderal Constitution as it was originally rat  
lied, and an amendment thereto having pro  
isely declared ‘That the powt rs not dele  
;aled to the I&#x27;nited States by the Conslitu  
ion, nor prohibited by it to the Stales, ar  
eserved to the States respectively, or lo th  
&gt;eople;&#x27;’ it is. incumbent in lhi . as in ever  
&gt;ther exercise of power by the Fi lend Gov  
unment, to prove, from the Constitution  
hat it grants the particular power exer  
:i -ed.  
Tlie next observation to he made, is, the  
nuch confusion and fallacv have been tiirowi  
iito the question, by blending the two cas:  
&gt;1 aliens, members of hostile, nations; ant  
tlie it?, members dffriendly nations. The. a  
wo cases are so obviously and so e-semi.dh  
fishnet, that it occasions no little surpri  
hat the distinction should have been disi  
[aided; and the surprise is so much tin  
[renter as it appaars that the two cases ar&gt;  
ictually distinguishdd by two separate Act  
)f Congress, passed at the same session, ant  
comprised in the same publication; the om  
iroviding for the case of ‘alien enemies.’ am  
he other ‘concerningaliens’ indiscriminately  
tnd consequently extending to aliens of ev­  
try nation in peace and amity with the Uni  
ed States. With respect to alien enemies  
10 doubt has been intimated as to the Fed­  
eral authority over them; the Coasiilulioi  
laving expressly delegated to Congress th  
lower to declare war against any nation, a;u  
if course to treat it and all its members a  
enemies. With respect lo aliens w ho are no  
mutinies, but members of nations in peari  
ind amity with the United States the powe  
issumed by the Act of Congress is accor  
Jingly agaiustthis Act that the protest of tin  
General Assembly is expressly and exelu  
lively directed.  
A third observation is, that, were i. admit  
led, as is contended, that the • \ct concern  
ing Aliens’ has for its object not u penal, bu  
* preventive justice, it would slill remain t&lt;  
he proved that it comes within the conslitu  
tional power of the Federal Legislature : and  
if within its power, that the Legislature ha  
exercised it in u constitutional manner.  
In the administration of preventive justice  
the following principles have been lmld s-n  
crcd : that some probable ground of sti-pi  
cion be exhibited before some judicial an  
lliority; that it be supported by oath or al  
lirniation; that the party may avoid bain  
thrown into confinement, by (hiding pledge  
oi sureties for his legal conduct, sufficici  
in the judgment of some judicial authority  
that lie may have the benefit of a writ of ha  
boas corpus, and thus obtahi his release,  
wrongfully confined ; and that lie may i  
any time be discharged- from his recogn  
zaucc, or his confinement, and restored t  
his former liberty and rights, on the order t  
the proper judicial authority, if ii shall sc  
sufficient cause.  
  
justice known to American juiisprudenci  
are violated i&gt;y the Alien Act. The grouu  
of suspicion is to be judged ol not by an  
judicial authority, but by the Executive Mat  
istrate alone : no oatli or allinnation is rc  
quired; if the suspicion be held reasonab  
by the President, he may order t!ie suspet  
ted Alien to depart the territory of the l u  
ted States, without the opportunity of avoit  
ing the sentence by finding pledges for li  
future good conduct: as the President me  
limit the time of departure as he please  
the benefit of the writ of habeas corpus m;  
be suspended with respect to the part  
although the constitution ordains that it slu  
not be suspended unless when the pub!  
safety may require it. in ease of rebellion  
invasion, neither of which existed at t  
passage of the act: and the party being, ti  
  
tier the sentence of the President, either re­  
moved from the United States, or being pun­  
ished by imprisonment, or disqualification  
ever to become a citizen, on conviction of  
not obeying the order of remove.!, lie cannot  
be discharged from the proceedings against  
him, and restored to the benefits of his for­  
•, liter situation, although the highest judicial  
• j autforinf should see the most sufficient cause  
■ j for it  
Bin, in the last place, il can never be ad­  
mitted that the removal of alien:!, authorised  
. by the Act, is to 1-8 considered, not as pun­  
ism?!&#x27;.! for tin ofibnee, but us a measure ol  
precaution and prevention. If the bauisment  
| of an all. n from a country into v, hirh be has  
I been invited as the asylum most auspicious  
to his happiness, a country where lie may  
have formed the most leader connections,  
where he may have invested his entire proper  
ty, and acquired property of the real and per­  
manent, as well us the moveable and tempo­  
rary kind—where he enjoys, under the laws,  
a greater share of the blessings of person;,1  
security and pavsonal liberty, than lie can  
elsewhere hope for, and where lie mav have  
nearly completed his probationary title to  
citizenship : if, moreover, in the execution of  
the sentence against him, he is to be exposed,  
not only to ordinary dangers of the sea, but  
to the peculiar casualties incident to a crisis  
i of war, and of unusual licentiousness on that  
clement, and pm. ibly to vindicate purp le.;  
which his emigration itself may have pro­  
: yoked : if a banismenl of this sort be not a  
1 j punishment, it will he difficult to imagine a  
doom to which the name can be applied.—  
And il it be a punishmeet, it will remain to  
bo inquired whether it can be constitutional­  
1 ly inflicted, oil mere suspicion, by the single  
• will of the Executive Magistrate, on persons  
convicted &lt;1 no personal ofience against the  
laws ol the laud, nor involvod in any offence  
■ against the law ol nations, charged on the  
■ foreign state of which they are members.  
One argument offered in justification of  
this power exercised over aliens, is, that the  
admission of tiient into the count!y being of  
favor, not of right, the favor is at all limes  
revocable.  
To this arrangement it might be answered,  
that, allowing the truth of the inference, it  
would be no proof of what is required. A  
question would still occur, whether the Con­  
stitution had vested the discretionary power  
of admitting aliens in the federal Govern­  
ment or in the Stale Governments.  
  
win n taiiiiui. uu a u iiu uncu ui m;u7 i)t’­  
cause the admission of ail ulic:i is a favor,  
the favt r may be revoked at pleasure. A  
grant of land to an individual may be of fa­  
vor, but not of right; but the moment the  
grant is made, the favor becomes a right, and  
must be forfeited before it can be taken away.  
To pardon a malefactor, may be a favor, but  
the pardon is not on that account the h ss  
irrevocable. To admit an alien to naturali­  
zation, i t as much a favor as to admit him  
to reside in the country, yet it cannot be pre­  
tended that a person naturalized can be de­  
prived of the benefits, any more than a na­  
tive citizen can be dislYnnehisod.  
Again, it. is said that aliens not being par­  
ties to the Constitution, the rights and priv­  
t ileger which itsecures cannot be at ail claimed  
i by them.  
To this reasoning, also, it might be an­  
1 severed that, although aliens are not parties  
to the Constitution, it does not follow that  
the Constitution has vested in Congress an  
absolute power over litem. The parties to  
the Constitution may have granted, or re­  
tained, or modified the power over aliens,  
1 without regard to that particular considera­  
| lion.  
Until more direct reply is, that it does not  
follow, because aliens are parlies to the  
constitution, as citizens arc parties to it that,  
’ whilst they actually conform to it, they have  
no right to its protection. Aliens are not  
more parties to me laws than they are not  
parties to the Constitution; vet it will not  
| be disputed that, as they owe, on one hand,  
‘ it temporary obedience, they are entitled, its  
w return, to their protection and advantage.  
!l aliens had no right under the Constitu­  
tion, they might not only be banished, but  
J even capitally punished, without a jury or  
the other incidents to a fair trial. But so  
iar hat a contrary principle been carried, in  
’; every part of the United States, that, except  
; on charges of treason, an alien has, besides  
&#x27;, all ike common privileges, the special one ol  
j being tried by a jury, of which one half may  
- i be also aliens  
It is said, further, that by the law and prac­  
t tice of nations, aliens may be removed at  
&gt; discretion for oll’cnces against the law of na­  
• nations; that Congress are authorized to de­  
•&gt; fine and punish such offences: and that to  
^ be dangerous to the peace of society, is, in  
aliens, one of those oliences.  
i The distinction between alien enemies ant  
- alien friends, is a clear and conclusive an­  
- svver to this, argument. Alien enemies are  
■ under tiie law of nations, and liable to lit  
• punished for olleuces against it. Alien friend:  
l except in the single case of public ministers,  
s are under the municipal law, and nni.it lx  
1 tried rad punished according to that law on  
1 1 \T  
  
This argument by referring the alict  
Act to the power of Congress U» define ant  
punish offences against the law of nations  
yields the point that the Act is of a penal  
not merely of a preventive, operation. I  
must, in truth, be so considered. And if i  
be a penal Act, the punishment it inflict;  
must be justitieil by some ‘offence that de  
serves it.  
Offences for which aliens, within the ju  
risdictiou of a country, are punishable, are  
first, offences committed by the nation o  
which they make a part, and in whose often  
- ccs they are involved : Secondly, offence;  
e committed by themselves alone, without ani  
- charge against the nation to which they be  
i- long. The first is the case of alien enemies  
|- the second, the case of alien friends. In th  
first case, the offending nation can no other  
v ! wise he punished than by war, one of th  
5, | laws of which authorises the expulsion c  
y i such of its members as may he found with  
in the country against which the offcnc  
H has been commuted. In the second cast  
ic | the offence being committed by the ludivid  
-jv ual, not by his nation, and against the mu  
ic nicipal law, not against the law of nation;  
n-! the individual only, and not the nation, i  
  
• punishable; and the punishment must Is  
: conducted according to the municipal law  
! not according to the law of nations. I ndei  
J &gt;b&gt;s view of the subject, the Act of Congre :  
! lor the removal of Alien enemies, being con  
fonnable with the law of nations, is jusliliet  
: by the Constitution : and the ‘Act’ for tin  
I re moval oi alien Iriends, being repugn,nit u  
the constitutional principles of municipal  
i law, is unjustifiable.  
■ftor is the Act ( I Congress for the remo­  
val of nlion friends, more agioeuhlo to tin  
general practice of notions, than it is within  
&#x27;be purview of the law of nations. The  
general practice of nations distinguishes be­  
tween mien friends and alien enemies. The  
bitter it has proceeded against according ti  
il.e law ot nations, by expelling them as en­  
emies. The former it has considered as un­  
der a local and temporary allegiance, and en­  
title;!, to a c &#x27;rivf.pnm! ht prelection. If con­  
trary i; lances are to In* found in barbtuou?  
: countries, under undo.tied prerogatives, e:  
amid revolutionary dnngera, they will not hr  
deemed lii precedents lor the Government ol  
the United States, oven if not beyond its  
constitutional authority.  
It is said that Congress may grant letter.­  
ol marque and reprisal; that reprisals mav  
he made on persons an well as property:  
1 and that the removal of aliens mav lie con­  
sidered as the e.-.ercise, in an inferior degree  
id the jgeneral power of reprisals on p­  
  
\\ iihout entering- minutely into a questior  
that does not seem to require it, it may In  
remarked, that reprisal is a seizure of Ibreigi  
persons or property, with a view to obtaii  
that justice lor injuries done hv one .Stale oi  
its members; for which a refusal of the ag­  
gressors requires such a resort to force unde:  
the law of nations. It must he consideret  
as an abuse ot words to call the removal &lt;  
persons irom a country a seizure or rejni.-a&#x27;  
on them : nor is the distinction to he over­  
looked between reprisals on persons within  
the country and under the faith of its laws,  
and oil persons out of the country. But,  
laying aside these considerations, it is evi­  
dently impossible to bring the Alien An  
within the power ol &#x27;.&#x27;ranting reprisals: sine:  
it does not allege or imply any injury re­  
ceived from any particular nation, for which  
this proceeding against its members was in  
1 tended as a reparation.  
The proceeding is authorised against alien.­  
j of every nation; of nations charged neithei  
with any similar proceedings against Ameri­  
can citizen:-, nor with any injuries I’,:.- whirl  
| justice might be sought in the mode pro­  
j scribed by the Act. Were it true, therefore  
j that good cause existed for reprisals iigninsi  
one or more foreign nation:;, and tli;;i neither  
the persons nor property of its members, u­  
der the faith i 1 our law , could plead an ex­  
i emption, the operation of the Act ought t:  
have been limited to tho aliens among us  
| belonging to such nations. To license re  
: pri/als against all nations, for aggression  
I charged on one only, would he a measure a  
j contrary to every principle of justice am  
I public law, as to a wise policy and the uni  
vers-al practice of nation .  
It is said that the right of removing alien  
i- an incident to the power of war, vestei  
in Congress by the Constitution.  
This is a former argument in a new simp  
only; and is answered by repeating that tin  
removal of alien enemi is an incident t&#x27;  
the power of war; that tho removal of alio:  
friends is not an incident to the- power t  
&#x27; war.  
It is said that Congress are by the Con  
’dilution to protect each State against in  
vn don; and that the means of pn .ailing in  
vasion are included in the povrerof protect  
ing against it.  
The power of war, inj’ueneiul, having boei  
before granted by the Constitution, this rluu-s  
must either he a more spec-ideation for great  
cr caution and certainly, of which there ar  
other examples in tho instrument, or he th  
injunction of a duty, ruporudded to a gran  
of the power. I nder either explanation, i  
cannot enlarge the powers of Congress o  
the subject. The power and the duty l  
protect each State against an invading e:u  
j my, would be the same uud-r the g.mcri  
i power, if litis regard to greater caution ha  
I l»pnn nmi-lpil.  
  
jiiviiMUJijs uu operation oi war. n&gt; |&gt;rc  
&#x27; lect against invasion, is an exercise oi&#x27; t*«  
; power of war. A power, therefore, not in  
| cideiil to war, cannot Im incident to a partic  
uiar modification of war. Anil ns the mine  
val of alien friends has appeared to he n  
incident to a general state of war, it cannr  
he incident to a partial state or a particulu  
modification of war.  
Nor can it ever he granted that a powe  
to act one case when it actually occurs, ir  
eludes a power over all the means that ina  
h ml in prevent the occurrence of the ca &lt;  
Such a latitude of construction would ret  
i der unavailing every practical definition &lt;  
particular and limited powers. Under tii  
idea of preventing war in general, as well s  
an invasion in particular, not only an indi;  
criminate removal of all aliens might 1)  
enforced, but a thousand other tilings, sti  
more remote from the operations and pri  
cautions appurtenant to war, might take piaei  
A bigoted or tyrannical nation might thrente  
us with war, unless certain religious t  
political regulations were adopted by us  
; yet ii never could he inferred, if the regain  
tions which would prevent war were sue  
as Congress had otherwise no power to tnuki  
i that liic power to make them would gru&#x27;  
■ out of the purpose they were to answer.­  
Congress have power to suppress iasurrei  
lions, yet it would not be allowed to folio&#x27;  
that they might employ all the means tend u  
i to prevent them; of which a system of tnon  
■ instruction for the ignorant, and of providei  
&gt; support for the poor, might he regarded c  
&#x27; among the most efficacious.  
One argument for tlte power of die Gener;  
, Government to remove Aliens, would hat  
: been passed in silence, if it bad appear#! ui  
• der any authority inferior to that oi a llepo  
1 in . In during the last session of Congress,  
f the House of Keprc .vntalivfs, by a Commi  
-! tec, and approved by die House. The do  
2 trine on which this argument is founded,  
, of so new and so extraordinary a churaetf  
- and strikes so radically at the political sysla  
- of America, that it is proper to state it in t  
, | very words of the report.  
ij “The act {concerning Uthu] is  
  
- .T-T, -y awieara- *» . .4 :  
unconstitutional, because t&gt;&gt; remove Alien &#x27;

provide:-, i&gt;y tiie 9th section of the tin i nrti-|  
dc, that the migration or impottntiortW such!  
persons as city of the Suites shell think pro­  
per to admit, shall not be prohibited by the  
Congress, prior to the year !808.”  
Among the an.we, given to this objection  
to the constitutionality of the Act, i!te fid-!  
j lowing very remarkable one is extracted : I  
| “Thirdly, that, an the Cm:: titmiun has gin-1  
re:» /&lt;&gt; the tea no powei to remove Aliens -  
during the period of the Itmitat.on under con-&#x27;

Istruction assumed, there would be noauthor­  
tly in the country empowered to send away  
dangerous Aliens: which cnunoi bo uthuit­  
ted.”  
Tin- reasoning her u-ed would not in any  
li-w be conclusive, because there are powers  
cm&#x27;i c;. ,-i! Iiy n• - a other vl-&#x27;Veru.r.cnt.:, which

1 nevertlicle .s, to pass by so portentous a claim,  
1 proceeding from so high uu authority, with­  
out a monitory notice of the fatal tendencies  
with which it would no. b - pregnant.  
’ Lastly, it ii said that a law on the same  
&#x27; subject with the Alien Act pa- .. d by this  
■ State originally in 1/8,3, nnd rc anucted it:  
17s)2, is a proof that a summary removal of  
- i suspected Aliens was not heretofore regard­  
1&#x27; ed, by the Virginia Legislature, a- liable to!  
I die objections now urg -d myiiii .t such a mea­  
• sure.  
  
This charge agaiiiM Virginia vani-dtei be­  
. .. — hnple remark that the law of Vir-j  
ginia relates to ‘suspicion persons, being thei  
subjects of any foreign Power or Slate who!  
shall have made a dtclumtlou of war, or nc-j  
tually comiuen ed hostiles, or fom whom  
dm !’;&lt; -uU-iit .shall apprehend hostile de-l

to Aliens, being the subjects of fou-igu Pow-i  
era and States who have neither declared w.n ■  
nor commenced liostilitivnor from whom!  
hostile demons are appu hended.  
II. It i. next affirmed, of the Alien Act,  
that it unite- Legi.dntivi, Judicial, and Exe­  
cutive power., in the hands of the President.  
However difficult it may he to mark, in  
every case, with ctearne s and certainly, the  
line \\ hicli divides the Legislative power from  
the other departments of power, all v ill agree  
that the p nvi i s referred t : those departments  
may he so general and undefined as to he of  
a legislative, not of an executive or judicial,  
nature; and may for that reason he unconsti-:  
lutioinil. De tails, to a certain d&lt; gree, are os-,  
sunlial to the nature and character of a lav. ; j  
and on criminal ; uhj&lt; el ii i- proper that t!&lt; -;  
tails should have as little as po.-; hide to the |  
discretion of those who are to apply and ex­  
ecute the law. If nothing more were rcipiir-&#x27;  
ed, in exercising a legislative trust, than a  
general conveyance of authority, without lay­  
ing down any precise rules by which lheau-|  
tliority conveyed should be carried into ef­  
fect, it would follow that the whole power of  
legislation might lie transfer! cd by the legis­  
lature front itself, and proclamations might  
become substitutes for laws. A delegation of  
power in ibis latitude would not be denied  
to be a union of the different powers.  
To determine, then, whether the appropi­  
ulc powers, of tiie distinct departments are  
united by the Act authorizing the Executive  
to remove Aliens, it must be inquired wheth­  
er it contains such details, definitions, and  
rules, as appertains to the true character of  
a law; especially a law by which personal  
liberty is invaded, property deprived of its  
value to the owner, and life itself indirectly  
exposed to danger.  
The Alien Act declares ‘that it shall be  
lawful for the Pi.:.,ident to order all such Ali­  
ens as he shall judge dangerous to the peace  
and safety of the United States, or shall have  
reasonable ground to swsp -cl are concerned in  
any treasonable or secret machinations again-1

Could a power be given in terms h de­  
finite, less particular, and h - piecisc? To  
be dangerous to th &#x27; public safety; to l.: sus­  
pected of secret machinations ag dust the Co ,,  
vornmeut: these can never be mistaken for  
legal rules or certain definitions. They leave  
every tiling to the President. His will is the  
law. s*.  
But it is not a legislative power oniy that  
is given to the President. He e-; to stand in  
the place of the JudicialrV al o. 11 is su | i­  
! cion is the oniy eviJgpce which is to convict:  
his order die only judgment which is to be

Thus it is the President whose will is to

&#x27; that is to ascertain the individuals on whom

tion, ii:e n in li-umcu&#x27;. by which the union  
of the flutes wm. r. gularly e ..tbiiabed; and,  
I’m ally, to cm;, mil tho Committee of 1787,  
which is the oracle that must decide the iut­  
portant question.  
In the stale print to the Revolution, it is  
ecilaiu that the common law, under different  
limitations, made a part of the colonial codes.  
Hut whether it 1 ■ uuderstoo t that the origi­  
nal colon: ..s brought the law wiih them, or  
nc. le i: tlieir law by adoption, it is equally  
cerium, that it was the Hi pari-&#x27;.:.- law of each  
colony within it, respective limits, a, ii was  
unknown to them, a. a law pervading and  
operating through i!it: whole as one society.  
Il could not posibly be otherwise. The  
common law was not the same in anv two  
of the colonics; in some tho modifications  
were ttn&#x27;.eitally ami extensively dillerent.—  
T’iiere was no eon tamr Legislature, by which  
a common w ill cotihi be expressed in the  
form of a languor any common magistracy  
by which i itch a law could be carried into  
practice. The \&gt; ill of tacit colony, alone  
and separately, laid iu organs for these pur­  
  
Thi&#x27;S stage of our political history furnish­  
es no foothold for the ^.patrons of this uesv  
doctrine.  
Did, then, the principle or operation of the  
great event which muds the colonies imle­  
pcudenl Status, imply or introduce the com­  
mon law, as a law of the Union ?  
The fundamental principle of the’Ilevolu­  
tion \va , that the colonies were co-ordinate  
members with each other, and with Great  
Britain, of an empire, united by a common  
executive sovereign, but not united by any  
common legislative sovereign. The legisla­  
tive power was maintained to be as complete  
in each American parliament, as in the British  
! parliament. And the rival prerogative was  
! in force in each eolonv, bv virtue of its ac­  
| knowledging t!..- King for its executive magis­  
trate. as it was in Great Britain, by virtue of  
! a like uckowledgemcnt there. A denial ot  
1 these principles by Great Britain, and the  
assertion of them by America, produced tfaa  
1 Revolution.  
I There was a time, indeed, when an excfpi  
lion to the legislative separation of the sev*  
i , • i r. j component and co-equal pints of the fin  
pire, ohta ■ ’ i1 ii *

the Alien and Sedition Laws.  
This tacit arrangement was the less criticis­  
ed, as the regulations established by the British  
Parliament operated infavor of that pai l of the  
empire, which seemed to bear the principle  
share of the public burdens, and were regard­  
ed as an indemnification of its advance:- for the  
other parts. As long as this regulating power  
was confined to the two objects ofconvenien­  
cv and equity, it was not complained of, nor  
much inquired into. But. no so &gt;nrr was it  
perverted to the selfish views of the party  
assuming it, than the injured pant; be a an to  
feel and to reflect; and the inom tit ih. claim  
to a direct and indefinite power was ingrafted  
on the precedent ol the regulating power, the  
whole charm was dissolved, and everv eye  
opened to tits usurpation. The assertion by  
Great Britain of a power to make laws for the  
other members of the empire in all cases  
whatsoever, ended in the discovery, that she  
had e. right to make laws for the; a in no cases  
whatsoever.  
Such being the ground of our Revolution,  
| no support nor color can be drawn from it,  
I for the doctrine that tiic common law is biud­  
I ing on these States as one society. The doc­  
trine, on the contrary, is evidently repugnant  
to the fundamental principle of the Ilevolu­  
  
The articles of confederation are the next  
source of information on this subject.  
in the interval between the commence­  
ment ol the Revolution and the ratification of  
these at tides, the nature and extent of the  
Union was determined by the circumstances  
of the crisis, rather than by any accurate de­  
lineation of the general authority. !t will  
not be alleged, that the ‘‘common law&quot; could  
have any legitimate birth as a law of the L.  
States during that state of things. If i; came  
ns such into existence at all, the character  
of confederation must have been its parent.  
Here, again, however, its preton• ions are  
absolutely destitute of foundation. This in­  
strument does not contain a sentence or a  
syllable that can be tortured into a counte­  
nance of the idea, that the panic* to it were,  
with respect to the objects of the common  
law. to form one community. No such law  
is named, or implied, or alluded to, as being  
in force, or as brought into force by that  
compact. No provision i&lt; made by which  
such a law could be carried into operation;  
whilst,on theotlier hand,tv; rvsuch inference  
or pretext is absolutely precluded by article  
2. which declares ••that each State retains its  
sovereignty, freedom, and ind independence,  
and every power jurisdiction,and right, which  
is not by this eonfedert&#x27;.;ion expren-dy tide  
gated to the United States in Congress assem­  
bled.”  
Thus far it appears, that not a vestige of  
lids extraordinary doctrine can be found in  
the origin or progress of American in . . .  
The evidence against it !... , on the contrary,  
grown stronger at every tep; .ill it has a­  
inouiitcd to .1 formal aud positive exelo ion,  
bv written articles of romptfei among the par­  
ties concerned.  
Is this exclusion revoked, anil the com­  
mon law introduced as a national law, by  
the present Constitution of the United S atesr  
This is the final question to be examined.  
Ii is readily admitted, that particular parts  
of the common law mav have a sanction from  
the Constitution, so far a t they arc necc ai­  
rily comprehended in the technical phrases  
which express the powers delegated to the  
Government; and so far, also, as such oilier  
ptu ts mav be adopted by Congress as n. ces­  
sury an.I proper for carrying into execu­  
tion the powers expressly delegated. Rut  
the question does n 4 relate to either of these  
portions of the common law. It relates to  
the common law beyond these limitations.  
The only part of the Constitution which  
seems to have been relied on in thi; ease, is  
- the 2d section of Article 111. ‘•The Judicial  
I jiower shall extent to all ca a-s, in l nr and  
\ equity, arising under tki.t Cnivtiihi&#x27;.i tt, the  
laws of the United State-, and Treaties made  
i or which shall be made under their autiiori­  
| ty.”  
Ii has been asked, what ca&gt; • , distinct horn  
! those arising tinder the laws and treaties ol  
! the United Slates, can arise under the Con­  
stitution, other than tho. e arising under the  
I common law; and it i inferred, that theeoin­  
j imm law is accordingly adopted or recognized  
i by the Constitution.  
Never, perhaps, was so broad a con (ruc­  
tion applied to a text so clearly unsuscepti­  
ble of it. ll any color for the inference could  
; be found, it must be in the imp s-ibility oi  
| limling any other cams in law and equity,  
j within the provisions of the ConitiUilion, to  
j satisfy the expression; and rather than rcsori  
! to a construetion aliening so c.-son&#x27;tally the  
whole character of the Government, it would  
perhaps he more rational to consider the ex­  
| pression as a mere pleonasm or inadvertence.  
But it is not necessary to decide on licit a  
dilemma. The expression is fully satisfied,  
and its accuracy justified by two descriptions  
1 of cases, to which the Judicial authority ts  
1 extended, and neither of which implies that  
the common law is the law of tun United  
States. One of these descriptions compre­  
hends the cases growing out of tho restric­  
tions on the legislative power ol the State.  
For example, it is provided that ‘mo State  
shall, emit bills of credit,” or “make anything  
but gold and silver coin a tender in payment  
of debts.” Should this prohibition be viola­  
ted, and a suit between citizens of the s ane  
State, be the consequence, this would be a  
rase arising under the Constitution belorelhc  
Judicial power of the United States. A sec­  
ond description comprehends suits between  
citizens and foreigners; of citizens of diiier­  
ctn States, to be decided according to the Suite  
or foreign laws; but submitted by the Con­  
stitution to the Judicial power of the United  
Slates; the Judicial power being, in several  
instances, extended beyond tile legislative  
power of the United States.  
To this explanation of the text, the fol­  
lowing explanation may he added.  
  
1 The expression, “cases in law and equity,”  
is manifestly confined to cases of a civil na­  
ture, and would exclude cases-of criminal  
jurisdiction. Criminal cases in law and equi­  
ty would be a language unknown to the  
j la,£  
1 tie succeeding paragraph in the same sec- j  
tion is in harmony with this construction.!  
li is in these words: “In all cases aflecting  
Ambassadors, or other public ministers and  
| Consuls, and those in which a State shall be  
a party, the Supreme Court shall have origi­  
nal jurisdiction. In all the other cases [in­  
cluding cases of law and equity arising under ]  
the Constitution] the Supreme Court shall j  
have appellate jurisdiction both as to law  
and fact: with such exceptions, and under  
j such regulations as Congress shall make-”  
This paragraph, by expressly (riving an  
| appellate jurisdiction, in cases of law and  
j equity arising under the Constitution, to fact.  
| as well as to law; clearly excludes criminal  
; cases, where the trial by jury is seen., d; b&gt; -  
I cause the fact in such cases, is not a subject  
\ of appeal. And, although the appeal is liable  
to such exceptions and regulations as Coagress  
j may adopt, yet it is not to he supposed that  
; an exception of all criminal cases could be  
l contemplated: as well aceause a discretion in 1  
I Congress to make or omit the exception  
I would be improper, as because it would have  
, been unnecessary. The exception could as  
easily have been made by the Constitution it­  
self, as referred to the Congress.  
Once more: the amendment last added to  
the Constitution, deserves attention us throw­  
in light on this subject. “The Judicial pow­  
er of the United States shall not be construed  
to extend to any suit in law or equity, com­  
menced or prosecuted against one of the Uni­  
ted Stales, by citizens of another State, or by  
citizens or subjects of any foreign power.”  
As it will not be pretended that any criminal  
proceeding could take place against a State,  
the terms law or equity, must be understood  
as appropriate to civil, in exclusion of crimi­  
nal cases.  
From these considerations, it is evident  
that this part of the Constitution, even if it  
could be applied at all (he purpose for which  
it has been cited, would not include any ca­  
ses whatever of a criminal nature; agd con­  
sequently would not authorize the inference  
from it, that the Judicial authority extends to  
offences against the common law, us offences  
against the common law, as dilutees arising  
under the Constitution.  
It is further to he considered, that even if  
this part of the Constitution could be strained  
j into an application to every common law­  
case, criminal as well as civil, it could have  
no effect in justifying the Sedition Act; which  
is an act of legislative power; and it is the  
[judicial power only of which the extent is  
| defined in this part of the Constitution.  
There are two passages in the Constitution,  
iti which a description of the law of the Uni­  
ted States is found. The first contained in  
Art. 111. Sec.3, in the words following: “This  
| Constitution, the laws of the United S ntes,  
[and treaties made, or which shall he in t ie,  
under this authority.” The second is con­  
tained i:i the second paragraph of Aitiele VI.  
as follows: “This Constitution,and the laws  
of the United Slates which shall lie made in  
pursuance thereof, and all treaties made or  
whiclrshall he made, under ths authority of  
the United S ates, shall he the supreme law  
of the land.” The first of these descriptions  
was meant as a guide to the Judges of the  
several S ates. Both of them consist of an  
I ( numeration, which was evidently meant to  
he precise and complete. It&#x27; the common  
: law had been understood to hi- a law of the  
United Stales, it is not possible to a sign a  
satisfactory reason why it was not expressed  
in the enumeration.  
In aid of these objections, the difficulties  
and confusion inseparable from a con: tritc­  
i live introduction of the common law, would  
allied powerful reasons against it.  
It i; the common law with, or w ithout the  
! British Statutes.  
If without the Statutory amendment, the  
| vices of the code would he insupportable.  
If with these amendments, what period is  
! to be fixed for limiting the British authority  
i over our laws?  
Is it to be the date of the eldest or the  
youngest of the colonies?  
Orate the dates thrown together, and a  
medium deduced?  
Oris our independence to be taken for the  
date?  
.t ... l,„ !,.,.t .V  
  
* ’ 1,4 v &gt;3  
changes in the common law made by the lo­  
cal codes of America?  
Is regard to be had to such changes, sub­  
sequent, as well as prior to the establishment  
of the Constitution?  
Is regard to be had to future, as well as past  
; changes?  
1 i the law to be different in every State, as  
: differently modified by its code; or tire the  
modifications of any particular Stale to be ap­  
plied to all?  
And on the latter supposition, which  
among the State codes form the standard.  
Questions of this sort might lie multiplied  
with as much ease as there would be difficul­  
ty in answering them.  
The e consequences flowing from the pro­  
posed construction, furnish otiter objections  
equally conclusive; unless the text were per­  
emtory in its meaning, and consistent with  
other parts of tee instrument.  
These consequences may be in relation to  
tiie legislative authority of the United Slates;  
to the executive authority; to the Judicial  
authority; and to the Government ol the sev­  
eral States.  
If it he understood that the common law  
is established by the Constitution, it follows  
that no part of the law can be altered by the  
Legislature; such of the statutes already pas­  
sed as may be repugnant theteto, would lie  
; millified, particularly the “Sedition Act&#x27; it­  
self, which boasts of being a melioration ot  
the common law; and the whole code, with  
ali it - incongruities, barbarisms, and bloody  
maxims, would be inviolably saddled on the  
• goad people of the United States.  
Sh .ul.l this consequence be rejected, and  
: the common l aw be held, like other laws,  
ii.fiie to r &quot;/isiou and alteration, by the au­  
tho.i v of C -ogress, it then follows that the  
juih of Congress is co-exiensive with  
the qhj icts of the common law; that is*t &gt; s »y  
with .,bj--ei of legislation; for to every  
&gt; such objv t does some branch or other oi  
  
the common law extend The authority ot [  
Congress would, therefore be no longer un­  
der the limitations marked out in the Con­  
stitution. They would he authorized to le­  
gislate in all cases whatsoever.  
In the next place, as the President posses­  
ses the executive powers of the Constitution,  
and is to see that the laws be faithfully exe­  
cuted, his authority would also be co-exten­  
sive with every branch of the common law.  
The additions which this would make to his  
power, though nor readily to he estimate,!,  
claim the most serious attention.  
This is not all; it will merit the most pro­  
found consideration, how far an indefinite ad­  
mission of the common law, with a latitude  
in construing it. equal to the construction by  
which it ,s deduced from the Constitution,  
might draw after it the various prerogatives,  
making part of the unwritten law of England.  
The English Constitution itself is nothing  
more than a composition , unwritten laws  
and maxims.  
In tiic third place, whether the common  
law be admitted as of legal or of constitution­  
al obligation, it would confer on the judicial  
department a discretion little short of legisla­  
tive power.  
On the supposition of it - having a consti­  
tulional obligation, this power in the judges  
would be permanent and irremediable by the  
Legislature. On the other supposition, the  
power would not expire until the Leg! latme  
should have introduced a full system of: fat-j  
11 lory provisions Let it be observed, too,  
that besides all the uncertainties above enu­  
merated, and which present an immense field  
for judicial discretion, it. would remain with  
the same department to decide what part of  
the common law would, and what would not  
lie properly applicable to the circumstances of  
the (hiited States.  
A discretion of this sort liars always been  
lamented as incongruous and dangerous, even  
in the colonial and State Court:-; although so  
much narrowed by positive provisions jn die  
local codes on all the principal subjects em­  
braced by the common law. Under the Uni­  
ted States, where so few laws exist on those  
subjects, and where so great a lap. e of time  
must happen before the va -t chasm could he  
supplied, it is manifest that the power of the  
judges over the law would, in tact, erect  
them into legislators, and that, for a long  
time, it would he impossible for die citizens  
to conjecture either what was, or would be  
  
taw.  
From the review thus taken ofthe situation  
of the American &lt;• domi-s, prior to their inde­  
pendence. of the cu’ert of this event oti their  
situation; of the imtu;e ami import of the ar­  
ticles of confederation; of the true meaning  
&lt;&gt;f the passage in the existing Constitution  
from which the common law has been de­  
duced; of the difficulties and uncertainties in­  
cident to the doctrine; and of its vast conse­  
quences in extending the powers of the Fed­  
eral Government, mid iu’-uiperceding the au­  
thorities of the State Governments; the enm­  
mitte 1 feel tiie utmoM confidence in conclu­  
ding, that the common law never was, nor  
by any fair construction, ever can be deemed  
a law for the American people as one com­  
munity; and they indulge the strongest ex­  
pectation that tiie same conclusion will be  
finally drawn by all candid and acurate in­  
quiries into the subject. It i«, indeed, dis­  
tressing to reflect, that it over should have  
been made a question, whether the Constitu­  
tion, on the whole face of which is seen so  
much lab&#x27; .- to enumerate and define the sev­  
eral objects o&#x27;. Federal p aver, could intend  
to introduce in the lump, in an indirect man­  
ner, and by a forced coa Iru- iiou of a few  
phrases, the vast and multifarious jurisdic­  
tion involved in tha common law; a law till­  
ing so many ample volumes a law overspread­  
ing the entire field of legislation; and a law  
that would sap the foundation of the consti­  
tution as a system of limbed and specified  
powers. A severer reproach could not, in j  
die opinion of the committee, be thrown on i  
the Constitution, on those who framed, or  
on those who established it, than such a sup­  
position would throw oil them.  
&#x27;Flic argument then, drawn from the com­  
mon law, on the ground of its being adopted  
or recognized bv the constituti m, being in­  
applicable to the Sedition act, the committee  
will proceed to examine the other arguments  
which have been founded on the Constitu­  
tion.  
They will waste but little tunc on the at­  
tempt to cover the act by the preamble to tiie  
constitution, it being contrary to cvey ac­  
knowledged rule of construction, to set up  
ibis part of an instrument in opposi-ion to  
the plain meaning, expressed in the body of  
the instrument. A preamble usually contains  
the general motives or reason for the partic­  
ular regulations or measures which follew  
: it; and is always understood to he explained  
. by them. In the p v nt instance, a contra­  
ay interpretation would have the inadmissible  
j cficct, of rendering nugatory or improper, ev­  
ery part of the constitution which succeeds  
the preamble.  
The paragraph in A t. 1, See. 3, which  
contains the power to lay and collect taxes  
duties, impost-, and excises; to pay thedebu  
! and provide for the common defence and  
general welfare, having been already exam­  
ined, will also require no particular attention  
in this place. It will have been seen that in  
its fair and con.-i-tent meaning, it cannot  
enlarge the enumerate I powers vested in  
; Congress.  
I The part of the coastitniiom which seems  
most to be recurred t&lt;&gt;. i;i defence of the Se­  
dition act, is the last clause of the above sec­  
tion, empowering Cougre &gt; to make all laws  
which shall be necessary and proper for car­  
rying into execution the foregoing powers,  
and all other power vested by this constitu­  
tion in the Government of the I hiited States,  
or iu any department or oiiicer thereof.  
The plain import of this clause is that  
| Congress shall have all the incidental or in­  
strumental poweru, necessary and proper for  
v . .-ring into ex :u &gt;n til the expre • pow­  
, ers; whether they he vested in the Govern  
i incut of the United State.-, more collectively  
or in -the several departments or officers  
thereof.  
It is not a grant of new &#x27;powers to Con­  
gress, but merely a declaration lor the remo­  
val of all uncertainty, that th • rue ins ol c ir­  
rying into execution, those otherwise grant­  
ed, are included in tiie grant,  
j Whenever, therefore, a question arises  
  
&#x27;oncerning the constitutionality of a parlicu-l  
ar power, llie first question is, whether the,  
lower lie expressed in the constitution. If;  
t be, the question is decided. If it be not!  
expressed, the next inquiry must be. whether ■ i  
! is properly an incident to an express pow- j  
sr, and necessary to its execution. If it be,  
il may be exercised by congress. If it be not,!  
Congress cannot exercise it.  
Let .the question be asked, then whether  
die power over the press, exercised in the  
•Sedition act,” he found among the powers 1  
expressly vi-led in the Congress? This is ,  
not pretended.  
Is there any express power, for executing  
which, it is ,i necessary and proper power.  
The power which has been selected, at  
least 1 emote, in answer to this question, is  
that “of suppre.-dng in uiriccthms;” which is  
said to imply a power to prevent insurrec­  
tions, by punishing whatever may lead or  
tend to them. But it surely cannot, with the  
least plausibility , be said, that the regulation  
of the press, and a juini hnicut of lib. I . are  
exercciscs of a power to suppress insurrec­  
tions. The most that could be said, would  
be, that the punishment of libels, if it had the  
tendency ascribed to it, might prevent the  
occasion of passing or executing laws neees­  
rary and proper for the suppression of insur­  
rections.  
Has the Federal Government no power  
then, to prevent as well as to punish re - i l­  
ance to the law??  
They have the power which the constitu­  
tion deemed the most proper m their hands  
for the purpose The Congress has power,  
b« fore it happens, to pa ; laws for punishing  
il; and the executive and judiciary have  
power to enforce those laws when it does  
happen.  
it must be recollected by many,and could  
be shewn to the satisfaction of all, that the  
construction here put on the terms “uece .sa­  
ry and proper,” is precis, ly the construction  
which prevailed during the discussions and  
ratifications of the constitution. It may be  
added, and cannot too often be repeated, that  
it is a construction absolutely necessary to  
maintain their consistency with the peculiar  
character of the government, as possessed of  
particular and definite powers only; not ol j  
the general and indefinite powcis vested in j  
ordinary governments. For if the power In!  
suppress insurrections, includes the power to  
punish libels ; or if the power to punish, in­  
clude.; a power to prevent, by all the means  
that may have that tendency, such is the re­  
lation and influence among the most remote  
subjects of legislation, that a power over a  
vert few, would carry with it a power over  
all. And it must be wholly immaterial,  
whether unlimited powers be exercised under  
the name ol unlimited powers, or be exercis­  
ed under the name of unlimited means of  
carrying into execution limited powers.  
This branch of the subject will be closed  
with a reflection that must have weight with  
all; but more especially with those who  
place peculiar reliance on&#x27;the judicial expo­  
sition of the constitution as the bulwark pro­  
vided against an nndv cxlcirsion &lt;4 dm legm  
lative power. If it be understood that the  
powers implied in the specific powers, have  
an immediate and appropriate relation to tin m  
as means necessary and proper for carrying  
them into execution, quesflons, on the con­  
stitutionality of laws passed for this purpose,  
will be of a nature sufficiently precise and  
determinate for judicial cognizance and con­  
trol. It&#x27;, on the other hand. Congress is not  
limited in the choice of means by any such  
appropriate relation of them to the specified  
power.-; hut may employ all ?u -It menus they  
may deem lilted to prevent as well ns u&gt;-pun­  
ish crimes subjected to their authority ; such  
as may have a lentlnie.i/ only to promote ail  
object for which they are authorized to pro­  
vide; every one must perceive that questions  
relating to means of this sort, must be ques­  
tions of mere policy and expediency ; on  
which legislative di-entioti alone can decide,  
and from which the judicial interposition and  
control are completely excluded.  
II. The next point which the resolution  
requires to he proved is, that the power over  
the press exercised by the Sedition act, is  
positively forbidden by one of the amend­  
ments to the constitution.  
The amendment stands in these words—  
‘•Congress shall make no law resp ding an  
establishment of religion, or prohibiting the  
free exercise thereof, or abridging the free­  
dom of speech or of the press, or the right  
of the people peaceably to assemble, and to  
petition the government for a redress ol  
grievances.”  
  
Ill liurilljlv.l VI I I . 1 I &gt; . 1 ’ll i HILI&#x27;MI  
act,” it ha:; been contended, i. That the  
‘freedom of the press’ is to he determined by  
the meaning of these terms in the common i  
l.v.v. 2. That the article supposes the power  
over the press to be in Congress, and prohi­  
bits them only from abri.&lt;l&lt;;ing the freedom  
allowed to it by the common law.  
\lthough it will be shewn, on examining  
the second of these positions, that the amend­  
ment is a denial to Congress of all power  
over the press, it may not be useless to make  
the following observations on the first of  
them.  
It is deemed to be a sound opinion, that  
the Sedition act in its definition of some of  
the crimes created, is an abridgement of the  
freedom of publication, recognized by prin­  
| ciplv.; of the common law in England.  
Tim freedom of the press under the corn­  
! in on law, is in the defences of tin; Sedition  
j act, made to exist in an exemption from all  
I previous restraint or printed publications, by  
i persons authorized to inspect or prohibit  
them. It appears to the committee, that this  
idea of the freedom of the press, can never  
be admitted to be the American idea of it:  
■ since a law inflicting penalties on printed  
! publications, would have a similar eflect with  
a law authorizing a previous re nraint on them.  
It would seem a mockery to say, that nolaws  
should be passed, preventing publications  
: from being made, but that laws might be  
1 passed for punishing them in case they might  
be made.  
The essential difference between the Brit­  
ish government, and the American constitu­  
tions will place this subject 4n the clearest  
light.  
In the British government, the danger of  
enc oaeliments on the rights of the people,  
is understood to he confined to the executive  
magistrate. The representatives of the peo­  
  
&gt;!e in the legislature, am not only exempt  
heinselves, from distrust, but are considered  
is sit.lie tent guardians of the rights of their  
■onstituents against the danger from the ex­  
scutive. Hence, it is a principle, that the  
larliament is unlimited in its power : or, in  
heir own language, is omnipotent. Hence,  
no, all the ramparts for protecting the rights  
&gt;f the people, such as their Magna Charta,  
heir Rill of Rights, See. are not reared acainst  
he parliament, luit against the royal preroga­  
ivc. I hey are merely legislative precaution,  
igainst executive iisurpaiion. Under such a  
t government as this, an exemption of the  
tress from previous restraint by licensers ap­  
pointed by the king, is all the freedom that  
\in he secured to it.  
In the United States the case is altogether  
lillerent. I lie people, not the government,  
[Hisses the absolute spvc eigiitv. The legis­  
latuie, tio less than th* executive, is under  
imitations of power. U .eroaehmeiits art­  
regarded as po -ible i 0111 one, as Irn&#x27;ui the  
other. Hence, in the United States, the  
gnat and essential rights ol the people are  
secured against legislative, as well ns execu­  
tive ambition. They are secured, not by  
laws paramount to prerogative, hut l&gt;v con­  
stitutions paramount to laws. This security  
ol the lreedom ol the press requires, that it  
should he exempt, not only from previous re­  
straint by the executive, as in Great Britain ;  
hut Ironi legislative restiiiint also ; and this  
exemption, to he ellectual, must beau exemp­  
tion, not only from the previous inspection  
ot licenses, hiit ironi the subsequent penalties  
  
oi law;?.  
The state of tin&#x27; press, therefore, under  
die common law, cannot in this point of  
vow, he the standard ol its freedom in the U.  
Slates.  
lint there is anotlier view, under which it  
mu_\ he necessary to consider tliis subject.—  
It may he alleged that, although the security  
forthe Ireedom of the press, he different in  
Great Britain and in this country; being a lo­  
cal security only in the former, and a consti­  
tutional security in the latter; and although  
there may he a lurther difference, in an ex­  
tension ol the freedom of the press here, be­  
yond an exemption from subsequent ponnl­  
tu - also; yet the actual legal freedom of the  
press, unde&#x27;- the common law. must deter­  
mine the degree ol Ireedom, which is meant  
by the terms, and which is constitutionally  
secured against both previous and susexueut  
restraints.  
The committee are not unaware of the dif­  
ficulty ol nil general questions, which may  
turn on the proper boundary between the  
liberty and licentiousness of the press. They  
will leave it therefore for consideration only  
how far the diliereucc between the nature (if  
the British Government, and the nature of  
the American Government, and the practice  
under the latter, may shew the degree of rig­  
or in the former, to be inapplicable to, and  
not obligatory in the latter.  
The nature of government elective, limited  
and responsible, in till their branches, may  
well he supposed to require a greater freedom  
of animadversion, than might he tolerated by  
the genius of such a government as that ol  
Great Britinn. hi the latter, it is a maxim,  
that the king tut Itersdilury, not a responsible  
magistrate, can do no wrong; and that tin  
legislature, which in two thirds of its compo­  
sition is also hereditary, not responsible, rati  
do what it plcascsr In the United States  
the executive magistrates are not held to be  
infallible, nor the legislatures to lie omnipo­  
tent; and both being elective, are both respon­  
sible. I it not natural and necessary, ifrtdet  
i &#x27;h dilie; rut circumstances, that a different  
degree of freedom, in the use of the press,  
should he contemplated?  
Is not such tin inference favored by wha  
is observable in Great Britain itself? Not  
withstanding the general doctrine of the com  
mou law, on I lie subject of the press, and tie  
oeea-iotml punishment of those who use i  
with a freedom, offensive to the governnien  
it is well known, that with respect to tie  
measures of the Government, where the rea  
sons operating here, become applicable there  
the freedom exercised by the press, and pro  
tccled by public opinion, far exceeds thclim  
its prescribed by the ordinary rules of law  
The ministry, who are responsible to im­  
peachment, are at all times animadverted on  
by the press, with peculiar freedom; and du­  
ring the elections for thcllouse of Commons  
the other responsible part of the Government  
the press is employed with us little reserve to­  
  
w.uip me  
The practice in America must lie entitlcc  
to much more respect, fu every Stale, pro  
ably, in the Union, the press has exerted ;  
freedom in &lt; anvassing the&#x27;nunits and meas  
ures of public men. of every description  
which has not heen confined to the strict li  
mils of the common law. On this footing  
the freesom of the press has stood; on thi  
foundation it yet stands. And it will not hi  
a breach, either of truth or candor, to sa1  
that no persons or presses are in the habit o  
more unrestrained an imadversions on th  
proceedings and functionaries of the Stat  
Governments, than die persons and presse  
most zealous in vindicating the act of Con  
gross for punishing similar animadversion  
on the (iovcrnrncnt of the United Stales.  
The last remark will not be understood, a  
claiming for the State Governments, an im  
munity greater than they have heretofore en  
joyed. Some degree of abuse is inseparnb!  
from the proper use of every thing, and in n  
instance is this more true, than in that of th  
press. It has accordingly been decided b  
the practice of the Stales, dint it is better t  
leave a few of its noxious branches to i  
luxuriant growth, than by pruning them awa  
to injure the vigor of those yielding the p.-i  
per fruits. And can the wisdom of this po  
icy, be doubted by any one who reflect, t!u  
to the press alone, chequered as it is with a  
buses, the wojld is indebted for all the tri  
utnphs which have been gained by reasoi  
and humanity, over error and oppression  
who reflect that the same bcneficient source  
the 1 nitccl Suites owe much of the light  
| which conducted them to the tank of a fre  
and independent nation; and which have ini  
| proved their political system, into a shapes  
auspicious to their happiness. Had “Sedi  
j /ion Acta,” forbidding every publication thr  
might bring the constituted agents into con  
j tempt or disrepute, or that might excite th  
, hatred of the people against the authors r  
j unjust or pernicious measures, been uniform  
  
ly enforce® against the press; might not the  
United States bf, languishing at this day,  
under the infirmiliss of« sickly confederation?  
Aright they not, possihlv, be miserable col­  
onies, groaning under a foreign yoke?  
To these observations one fact will be ad­  
ded, which demonstrates that the common  
law cannot be admitted as the universal ex­  
positor of American terms, which may be the  
same with those contained in that law. The  
freedom o( conscience, and of religion are  
found in the same instruments which assert  
the freedom of the press. It wil1 never be  
admitted that the meaning of the former, in  
the common law of Knglaud, is to limit their  
meaning in the United States.  
Whatever weight may he allowed to these  
considerations the Committee do not, how­  
ever intend to rest the question on them.—■  
They contend that the article of amendment  
instead of supposing in Congress a power  
that might be exercised over the press, pro?  
vidod its freedom was not abridged, was  
as a positive denial to Congress, of any pow­  
er on the subject.  
To demonstrate that this was the object of  
the article, it will he sufficient to recall the  
circumstances which led to it, and to refer to  
the explanation accompanying the article.  
When the constitution was under the dis­  
cussion which preceded its ratification, it is  
well known that great apprehensions were  
expressed by many, lest the omission of  
some positive exception from the powers de­  
legated, of certain rights, and of the freedom  
of the pres; particulaily might expose them  
to danger of being drawn by construction  
within some of the powefs vested in Con­  
gress ; more especially of the power to make  
all laws neces-ary and proper for carrying  
their other powers into execution. In repiv  
i to this objection, it was invariably urged to  
he a fundamental and characteristic principle1  
i of the constitution, that all powers not given  
by it were reserved; that no powers were  
j given beyond those enumerated iu the con­  
! stilution, and such as were fairly incident to  
j them ; that the power over the rights in ques­  
tion, and particularly over the press, was  
neither among the enumerated powers, nor  
incident to any of them; and consequently  
that an exercise of any such power, would  
he manifest usurpation. It is painful to re­  
mark how much the arguments now employ­  
ed in behalf of the Sedition act, are at vari­  
ance will, the reasoning which then justified  
j the’constitution, and invited its ratification.  
From this posture of the subject, resulted  
the interesting question in so many of the  
conventions, whether the doubts and dangers’  
ascribed to the constitution, should be remov­  
ed liy any amendments previous to the rati­  
fication, or he postponed, in confidence that  
as far as they might he proper—they  
would he introduced in the form provided by  
the constitution. The latter course was  
adopted ; and in most of the States ratifica­  
tions were followed hv the propositions and  
instructions lor rendering the constitution  
more explicit, and more safe to the rights  
not meant to be delegated by it. Among  
those rights the freedom of the press, in most  
invmres is particularly and emphatically&#x27;  
: mentioned. The firm and very pointed man­  
ner in which it is asserted in the proceedings  
i of the convention of the state will he here­  
after seen.  
  
In pursuance of the wishes thus express­  
i&#x27;il, the first Congress assembled under the  
constitution, proposed certain amendments,  
i which have since, by&#x27;the necessary ratifica­  
tions been made a part of it; among which  
amendments is the article containing, among  
other prohibitions on the Congress, an ex­  
press declaration that they should make no  
law abridging the freedom of the press.  
FIFTH RKSOt.l TIOX.  
VV ithout tracing farther the evidence orr  
this subject, it would he scarcely possible to  
doubt that no power whatever over the press  
was supposed to he delegated hv the ennsti­  
&#x27; tulion as it originally stood, and that the  
: amendment was intended as a positive’and  
j absolute reservation of it.  
But the evidence is still stronger. The  
j proposition of amendments^ made by Con­  
gress is introduced in the following terms:  
‘•The Conventions of a number of the  
Stales, having at the time of their adopting  
the constitution, expressed a desire, in order  
• to prevent misconstructions or abuses of its  
■i powers, that further declaratory and restric­  
&#x27;! live clauses should be added; and as extend­  
t ing the ground of public confidence in the  
t j Government, will best insure the beneficent  
■ ends of its institutions.”  
Mere is the most satisfactory and authen­  
, tic proof that the several amendments pro­  
■ posed were to be consideied as either de­  
claratory or restrictive, and whether the one  
or the other, as corresponding with the de­  
dcsire expressed by a number of the Slates,,  
and as extending the ground of public con­  
fidence in the government.  
Under any other construction of tire amend­  
ment relating to the press, than that it de­  
clared the press to he wholly exempt from­  
the power of Congress, the amendment could  
neither be said to correspond with the de­  
■ sire expressed by a number of the States,  
nor be calculated to extend the ground of  
public confidence in the government.  
i Nay more; the construction employed to  
• justify the ‘-Sedition Act,” would rxhibit a  
, phenomenon without a parallel in the polit­  
i ical world. It would exhibit a number of  
respectable States, ns denying, first, that any  
power over the press was delegated bv the  
constitution; pioposing, next that an amend­  
ment to it should explicitly declare that no  
such power was delegated; and, finally, as  
concurring in an amendment actually recog­  
nising or delegating such a power.  
Is, then, the Federal Government, it will  
be asked, destitute of every authority for re­  
straining the licentiousness of the press, and  
for shielding itself against the libellous at­  
tacks which may be made on those who ad­  
minister it ?  
The constitution alone can answer this  
question. If no such power be expressly  
delegated, and if it he not both necessary  
and proper to carry into execution an ex­  
press power; above all, if it be expressly  
forbidden, by a declaratory amendment to  
the C institution, the answer innst be. that  
the Federal Government is destitute of all  
such authority.  
And might it not be asked, in turn, wheth­  
er it is not more probable, under all the c&#x27;r­  
cumstances which have been reviewed, that  
the authority should he withheld by the  
Constitution, than that it should be left to a  
vague and violent construction, whilst so  
much pains were bestowed in enumerating  
other powers, and so many .less important  
powers are included in the enumeration?  
.Might it not be likewise asked, whether  
the anxious circumspection which dictated  
so many peculiar limitations on the general  
authority, would be unlikely to exempt the  
press altogether from that authority? Toe

&quot;The fundamental principle oi the Revolution  
wa?, that the Colonics were co-ordinate membets  
witheo-iti/ier, and with Great lint/tin, of an em­  
pire united by a common executive sovereign, but  
not united bv any common legislative sovereign.  
The legislative power was maintained t&lt;&gt; be a*  
complete in suck American Parliament, as in the  
Btiti*h Parliament. And the roval prerogative  
was in forcc in car.h colony, by vinue ol its ac­  
knowledging the King lor its executive magis­  
trate, as it was in Great Britain by virtue if a  
lite acknowledgment thete. A denial of these  
principles by fJreat Britain, and the assert inn &lt;?{  
ikcm hy Aimrica, produced the Revolution.  
&quot;There was a time, indeed, when an exception  
to the legislative separation ?&gt;1 the several com­  
ponent and co-ci/uat parts ol the empire obtained a I  
degree of acquiescence. The British Parliament  
was allowed to regulate the I rude with foreign na­  
tions, and between the different pans of the Em­  
pire. This was, however, vure pra-ctic, vijtin?iit  
rn&#x27;ht. and Contrary to the true theory of the Con­  
stitution. The conveniency of some regulations  
in both those cases was apparent; and, as there

the eldest and the largest, to s.^imw !ni- tune­  
lion, and for the other- to acquiesce in it. This  
tacit agreement was the less criticised, as the re­  
gulations established b,&#x27;the Criii-h Parliament  
operated in favor ot that part of the Empire  
which seemed to bear the principal chare of the  
publiv burdens, an&#x27;i were regarded o- an indem­  
nification for its advances to the other part-. As  
long as this regulating power was confined to the  
two objects of convenience&#x27; an&lt; equity, it was not  
complained of, nor muc h enquired into. But, no  
sooner was it perverted to the selfish view-of the  
party assuming it. titan the injured parties herati

in favor of protective duties to support manufactures,  
made in 1791, he lays down the position, that it belonged  
“to the discretion of the national legislature to pronounce  
upon the objects which concern the ‘general welfare ;) and  
for which under that description, an appropriation of mo-  
ney, is requisite and proper. And there seems to be no  
room for a doubt, that whatever concerns the general in-  
terest of learning, of agriculture, of manufactures, and of  
commerce, are within the sphere of the national councils  
as far as regards an application of money.” Here is the  
origin of the doctrine of the “general welfare,” and of the  
omnipotence of Congress in appropriating money. How-  
ever promulged since by Republican Presidents, and lately  
relied on in Congress, as sound democratic doctrines—they  
are original, unadulterated, flagrant, federal heresies. Mr.  
Madison, in that great embodiment of republican state rights  
principles, his report in the Virginia legislature on the alien  
and sedition laws, meets these positions of Alexander Ham-  
ilton, in the following words:  
  
“Now whether the phrases in question, be construed to authorize  
every measure relating ‘to the common defence and general wel-  
fare,’ as contended by some; or every measure only in which there  
might be an application of money, as suggested by the caution of  
others ; the effect must substantially be the same, in destroying the  
import and force of the particular enumeration of powers which  
follows these general phrases in the constitution. For it is evident,  
that there is not a single power whatever, which may not have some  
reference to the common or the general welfare ; nor a power of an  
magnitude, which in its exercise, does not involve or admit an appli-  
cation of money. The government therefore, which possesses power  
in either one or the other of these extents, is a government without  
the limitations formed by a particular enumeration of powers; and  
consequently the meaning and effect of this particular enumeration  
is destroyed by the exposition given to these several phrases.  
  
“This conclusion wil! not be affected by an attempt to qualify the  
power over the ‘general welfare,’ by referring it to cases where the  
general welfare is beyond the reach of separate provisions by the

which the separate provisions may be competent. For as the au-  
thority of the individual states, must in all cases be incompetent to

the United States would extend to every object relating to the gene-

have little, if any tendency to circumscribe the power, claimed under  
the latitude of the term ‘general welfare.’  
  
Mr. Calhoun in the report on the Memphis proceedings,  
which we have put at the head of this article, elaborates the  
the same ideas; but with far more distinctness and force.  
  
“Your committee, after the most mature deliberation, are of the  
opinion that this power does not authorize Congress to appropriate

&quot;The true and lair construction of this ex­  
pression, both in the otiginal and existing Fe­  
deral compacts, appears to the committee too ob­  
vious to be mistaken. In both, the Congress is  
authoiized io provide money lor the common  
defence and general welfare. In both is sub­  
joined to this authority an enumeration of the  
cases to which their power shall extend. Money  
cannot be applied to the general wellarc, other­  
wise than by an application ol it to some parti­  
cular measure conducive to the general welfare.  
VV henever, theiefore, money has been applied to  
a particular measure, a question arises whether  
the particular measure is within the enumerated  
authorities vested in Congress, If it b:-, the mo­

ment. Article 5 says that amendments thereto,  
when ratified as therein specified, “shall be valid,  
to all intents and purposes, as parts of this Con-  
stitution.” At the first session of the 1st Con-  
gress, ten amendments to the Constitution were  
proposed for adoption ; and they were adopted by  
the Legislatures of three-fourths of the States—  
one of the modes pointed out in article 5. Pre-  
ceding said amendments, as recommended by Con-  
gress to the States for adoption, was the following  
preamble, adopted by Congress:  
  
“The Conventions of a number of the States  
having, at the time of their adopting the Consti-  
tution, expressed a desire, in order to prevent  
misconstruction, OY ABUSE of its powers, that fur-  
ther declaratory and restrictive clauses should be

security of personal rights against the usurpations  
of Congress. They are utterly incompatible with

tional legislation on the part of Congress, and that the  
Supreme Court of the Union ought alone to be appealed  
to. Listen to Mr Madison, who, as a lover of the Union  
and a faithful expositor of the constitution, has never  
been surpassed:  
  
&quot; If the deliberate exercise of dangerous powers, p&lt;lpa­  
|&gt;ly withheld by the constitution, could not justify the jinnies  
to It In interposing even so far as to itrrest ihe progress o( the  
evil, and thereby to preserve the constitution itself, as well  
as to provide lor the safety of the parti ?* to it, there would  
be an en I to all relief from usurped power, and u direct sub  
version of the rights specified or recognised under all the  
State constitutions, as veil as a plain dumal of the funda­  
mental principle on which our independence itself was do  
dared.  
&quot;But it is obj?&quot;Cted that tho judicial authority i. to be re­  
garded as til# Hole expositor of the constitution in tho Inst re­  
sort ; and it may be itrlced for what reason the declaration  
by the general assembly, supposing it 10 bo theoretically  
true, could be requited at the present day, and in sj solemn  
a manner.  
&quot;On this objection it might be obvjrved, lirst, that tliore  
may be iustances oi usurped power which tlio lor ins of the  
constitution would never draw wiihin the control of the ju­  
dicial department; secondly, thai, it the decision ol tin, ju­  
diciary be raised above thu authority of the sovereign par­  
ties to the constitution, the decision ol the other departinoul,  
not carried by the forms of the constitution before the judi­  
ciary, must be equally authoritative aud final with the de­  
cisions of &lt;bat department. But the proper answer to the  
objection is, that the resolution ol the general assembly re­  
lates to those great and extraordinary cases in which all  
the forms of the constitution tnay prove ineffectual against  
infractions dangerous to die essential rights of die parties to  
it The resolution supposes that dangerous powers, not  
delegated, may not only be usurped uud executeu by the  
other departments, but that the judicial department also  
may exercisu or sanction dangerous powers beyond the  
grant ol the constitution ; uud, consequently, that the itlti  
male right oi the parties to the constitution to judge wheth­  
er the compact has been dangerously violated, mint ex­  
tend to violations by one delegated authority as well as by  
another?by the judiciary as well as by the executive or the  
legislature.  
&quot;However true, therefore, it may be that the judicial de­  
partment is, in all questions submitted to it by the forms al  
the ooustitutiou, to decide in the last resort, this resort  
must necessarily be deemed tho last in relation to the au­  
thorities of the other departments ol the government; not  
in relation to the rights of the parties to the constitutional  
oompoci, from, which the judicial as well as the other iie­  
partineuts hold iheir delegated trusts. On auother hypoth­  
esis, the de&#x27;igu&#x27;ton ol judicial power would annul the  
authority delegating it; and the concurrence ol this de­  
deparunent with the others in usurped powers might snb  
ver&#x27;. forever, and beyond the possible reach of any rightful  
remedy, the very constitution which all were instituted to  
preserve.  
Mr. PHELPS. Mr. President, 1 apprehend there is  
nothing in the extract which has been read which bears  
on the course ol remark which I was pursuing. What

Congress and that the Supreme Court of the Union ought  
alone to be appealed to. Listen to Mr. Madison, who, as a  
lover of the Union, and a faithful expositor of the constitu­  
tion, has never beeu surpassed i  
?If the deliberate cxercise of dangerous power*, palpably  
withheld by the constitution, could not justify the parties to it  
in interposing evei/ so far as to arrest the progress of the evil,  
and thereby to preserve the constitution itself, as well as to  
provide for the safety of the parties to it, there would be an  
end to all relief from usurped power, awl a direct subversion  
of the rights specified or recognised under all the Stale con­  
stitutions, as well as a plain denial of ihe fundamental prin­  
ciple on which our independence itselt was declared.  
&quot; But it is objected that the judicial authority is to be re­  
garded as the sole expositor of the constitution in the last re­  
port ; and it may be asked for what reason the declaration by  
the General Assembly, supposing it to be iheoreticallj true,  
?ould be required at the present day, and in so solemn a  
&quot;&quot;??On this objection it might be observed, first, that there  
may be instances of usurped power which the forms ol ^con­  
stitution would never draw within the control ot the judicial  
department; secondly, that, if the decision ol the judiciary be  
raised above the authority of the sovereign parties to the con­  
stitution, the decision of the ofher department, not carried by  
the forms of the constiiution betore the judiciary, must be  
equally authoritative and final wilh the decisions o? that de­  
partment. But the proper answer to the objection is, that ie  
resolution of the General Assembly relates to those great. and  
extraordinary cases in which all the forms of the constitution  
mav nrove ineffectual agaiust inlractions dangerous to the es­  
sential rights of the parties to it. The resolution supposes  
that dangerous powers, not delegated, may not only be usurp­  
ed and executed by the other departments, but that thejurti­  
ci?l department also may exercise or sanction dangerous pow­  
ers beyond the grant of the constiiution ; atld, consequently,  
that the ultimate right of the parties to the constitution to  
judge whether the compact has been dangerously violated, must  
extend to violations by one delegated authority as well as by  
another?by the judiciary as well as by the executive or the  
^^However true, therefore, it may be that the judicial de­  
partment is, in all questions submitted to it by the iorras ol tue  
constitution, to decide in the last resort, ibis resort must ne­  
cessarily be deemed the last in relation to the authorities ol  
the other departments el the Government; not in relation to  
the rights of the parties to the constitutional compact, from  
which the judicial as well as the other departments hold their  
-delegated trusts. On any other hypothesis, the delegation ol  
judicial power would annul the authority delegating it; and  
the concurrence of this department with the others in usurped  
powers might subvert forever, and beyond the possible reach  
of any rightful remedy, the very constitutian which all were  
instituted to preserve.&quot;

tion of the first article. The eighth section con­  
tain eighteen distinct clauses. The first seven  
teen state grants of express power, describing so  
many particular subjects in regard to which Con  
gress may legislate. The eighteenth and last  
clause of the same section contains the grant of  
implied powers. It authorizes Congress &quot;to  
make all laws which shall be necessary and  
proper for carrying into execution the forgming  
powers, and all olher powers vested by this Cone  
atitution in the Government of the United States,  
or any department, or officer thereof.&quot; In regard  
to this clause on which are based the implied  
powers of Congress, Judge Story remarks,  
The plain import of this clause is, that Cone  
gress shall have all the incidental and snstrurmcn  
fal powers, necessary and proper to carry into  
execution all the erpress powers. It neither en  
larges any power specifically granted; nor is it a  
grant of any neur power to Congress. Whenever,  
therefore, a question arises concerning the Con  
atitutionality of a particular power, the first ques  
tion is, whether the power be expressed in the  
Constitution. If it be, the question is decided.  
if it be not expressed, the next inquiry must be,  
whether it is properly an incident to an exrpress  
porer and necessary to its execution. If it be,  
then it may be exercised by Congress. If not,  
Congress cannot exercise it.&quot; Moulton&#x27;s Consti  
tutional Guide, p. 43.  
This gives the true rule for expounding the  
grants of power made in the Constitution. If the  
power be granted in capress words, this ends the  
question. If it be not so granted, then two things  
must be shown. First, there must be shown  
somewhere in the Conatitution the grant of an  
express power to the Federal Government  
and then, secondly, it must be shown that th

&quot;General Assembly, and now met in Convention, hav­  
&quot;ing fully and freely investigated and discussed the  
&quot;proceedings of the Federal Convention, and being  
&quot;prepared, as well as the most mature deliberation  
-hath enabled us, to decide thereon, do, in the name  
&quot;and in behalf of the People of declare and  
&quot;make known, that the powers granted under the  
&quot;Constitution, being derived from the people of tie  
&quot;United Stat s, may be resumed by them whensoever  
&quot;the same shall be perverted to their injury or oppres­  
sion : and that every power not granted therein remain  
&quot;with them and at their will : that, therefore, no right of  
&quot;any denomination can he cancelled, abridged, restrained  
&quot;or modified, by Congress, by the Senate or House, of  
&quot;Represtntives, acting in any capacity, by the Presi­  
dent, or any Department, or officer of the United  
&quot;States, except in those instances in which power is  
&quot;given.by the Constitution for those purposes.&quot;  
If there yet lingers in the mind of any doubt as to the  
right of the States to withdraw from the Union, it will  
be a source of pleasure to present to such the opinion of  
one than whom none ranked higher in the estimation of  
the old fathers of the Republic as an expositor of the  
federal compact and the rights cf the States. The

The states feared that a latitudinous ambiguity existed in these clauses,  
and hence, on adopting the Constitution, expressed a desire, that further  
declaratory and restrictive clauses should be added. ‘The first Congress  
accordingly proposed, and the states subsequently ratified an amendment,  
that “ the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution,  
nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively,

But it is objee&#x27;ed that the judicial authority is  
to be regarded as the sole expositor of the Constitution  
in the last resort; and it may be asked  
for ft&#x27;hat reason the declaration by the general &#x27;  
assembly, supposing it to be theoretically true, 1  
could be required at the present day, and in so &lt;  
solemn a manner. I  
On this objection, it might be observed, first, .  
that there may be instances of usurped power,  
which the forms of the Constitution wAuld  
never draw within the control of the judicial i  
department; secondly, that if the decision of the ,  
judiciary be- raised above the authority of the  
several parties to the Constitution, the decisions  
of the other departments, not carried by the forms  
of the Constitution before the judiciary, must be t  
equally authoritative and final with the decisions .  
of that department. But the proper answer to  
the objection is, that the resolution of the general  
assembly relates to those great and ex-- &#x27;  
traordinnry eases, in which all the forms of the  
Constitution may prove ineffectual against in- ,  
fractions, dangerous to the essential rights of  
the parties to it. Theresoluth i supposes that  
dangerous powers not delegated, may not only  
lie usurped and executed by the other departments,  
but that the. judicial department also in ny  
exercise or sanction dangerous powers beyond the  
grant of the Constitution ; and, consequently,  
that the ultimate right of the parties to the  
Constitution, to judge whether the compact has  
1 been dangerously violated, must extend to vio5  
lntions by one delegated authority, as well as another?by  
the judiciary, as well as by the executive,  
or the legislature  
Here it ?ill be seen that Mr. Madison asserts

But it U objected that the judicial authority  
]  
  
is to be regarded as the Bole expositor of th&lt;  
Constitution in the last resort; and it may be  
asked for what reason the declaration by the  
general assembly, supposing it to be theoretically  
true, could be required at the present day,  
and in ao solemn a manner.  
On this objection, it might be observed, first,  
that there muy be instances of usurped power,  
which the forms of the Constitution would  
never draw within the control of the judicial department  
; secondly, that if the decision of the  
judiciary be raised above the authority of the  
several parties to the Constitution,/Ac decisions  
of the other departments, not carried by the forms  
of the Constitution before the judiciary, must he  
equally authoritative and final with the decisions  
of that department. But the proper answer to  
the objection is, that the resolution of the general  
assembly relates to those great and ex raordinary  
cases, in which fill the forme of the  
Constitution may prove ineffectual against infractions,  
dangerous to the essential rights of  
the parties to it. The resolution supposes that  
dangerous powers not delegated, may not only  
be usurped and executed by the other departments,  
but I hut the judicial department also may  
exercise or sanction dangerous powers beyond the  
grant if the Constitution; and, consequently,  
that the ultimate right of the parlies to the Con  
stitution, to judge whether the compuct bus  
been dangerously violated, must extend to violations  
by one d&#x27;l?gat-d authority, as well at an  
other?by the judiciary,as well as by the executive,

at the liberties of the people.  
The third resolution is in the words follo­  
wing:  
&quot;That this assemby doth explieltly and  
peremptorially declare, that it viows the  
powers of the Federal Government, as re­  
sulting from the compact, to which the  
states are partien, as limited by the plain  
sense andintention of the instrument conetd­  
 tuting that compact- aa no further valid than  
they are authorized by the grants enumer­  
ated in that compact; and that in case of  
a deliberate, palpable and dangerous exer.  
cise of other powers, not granted by the  
said compact, the States who are parties  
thereto, have the right, and are in duty  
bound, to interpose, for arresting the pros  
gress of the evil, and for maintaining, with.  
in their respective limits, the authoritles,  
rights, and liberties, appertaining to them.&quot;  
On this resolution the Committee have  
bestowed all the attention which its impor­  
tance merits: They have scanned it not  
merely with a strict, hut with a sovere oye,  
and they foel confidence in pronouneing,  
that, in its just and fair construction, it is  
unexceptionabily tre in its several positions,  
as well as cossstitutional and conelesive in  
its interences,  
  
the reolation ecfares ss, tont t  
 viows the powors of the Fodoral Govern  
ment as resulting from the compact to  
which the States are parties;&quot; in other  
words, that the Federal powers are derived  
from the Constitation; and that the Con­  
stitution is a compact to which the States  
are parties.  
Clear as the position must seom, that  
the Federal powors are dorived froen  
the Constitution, and from that alone,  
the Committee are unt unapprised of a late  
doctrine, which opens another source of  
Federal powors, not lees extensive and im­

76 3 saross seses sess en ser   
se room for a doubt, that whatever concerns  
the geseral intereats of learning, of agricul­  
ture, of mennfectures, and of commeree, are  
within the sphere of National Councils, as  
fer es regerds an application of monry. The  
latter report assumes the aame latitude of pow­  
ef in the National Councils, and applies it to  
the encouragement of agriculture, by means of  
a soclety to be established at the seat of Gove  
ernment. Although neithet of these reports  
may have received the sanction of a law carry.  
ing it into effect; yet, on the other hand, the  
extraordinary doctrine contained in both, has  
pasced without the alightest positive mark of  
dlespprobation from the authority to which it  
was addressed.  
  
Now, whether the phrases in question be  
construed to authorize every measure relating  
to the common defence and general welfare, as  
contended by some? or every measure only in  
whish there might be an application of money,  
as soggested by the caution of others; the ef-  
feet miust subatantially be the anme, in destroy-  
ing the import and force of the particular enn­  
meration of powers which follow these general  
phrases in the Constitution. For, it is evident,  
that there is not a single power whatever,  
which may not have some reference to the  
common defence, or the general welfare; nor  
a power of any magnitude, which, in its exer­  
elsse, does not involve or admit an application  
of money. The Government, therefore, which  
poseesses power in either one or other of these  
extente, is a Government without the limits­  
tions formed by a particular enumeration of  
powers; and consequenly, the meaning and  
effect of this particular enumeration, is des­  
troyed by the exposition given to these general  
phrases.  
This conclusion will not be affected by an  
attempt to qualify the power over the general  
welfure,&quot; by reterring it to cases where the  
general welfure is beyond the reach of the sep­  
arate provisions by the indiridual States; and  
leaving to these their jurisdictions in cases, to  
which their separate provisions may be com  
petent. For, as the authority of the individual  
States must in all cases be incompetent to gen  
eral regulations operating through the whole,  
the authority of the U. States would be exe  
totided to every object relating to the general  
welfare, which might, by any possibility, be  
provided for by the general authority. This  
qualifying construction, therefore, would have  
little, if any tendency, to circum-cribe the  
power claimed under the latitude of the terms  
&quot;general welfare.&quot;  
The true and fair construction of this expres.  
lion, both in the original and existing Federal  
sompacte, appears to the Committce too ob  
rious to be mistaken. In both, the Congress  
s authorized to provide money for the common  
lefence and general welfure. In both, is sub­  
oined to this authority, an enumeration of the  
tases, to which their power shall extend, Money  
sannot be applied to the gereral welyere, othere  
wise than by an application of it to some par-  
ticular measure, conducive to the general wel­  
fare. Whenever, therefore, money has been  
raised by the general authority, and  
applied to a particular measur,  
whether the part  
he enumerated nudhorities sested in Congress  
if it he, the mloncy requisite for it may be  
piled te it; if it be not, no sueh applica  
be made. This tair and obvions imerpeee  
tation coinciden with, and is enforced by, the  
in the Conatitation, which declares that  
no money shall be drawn frou the treasury,  
in consequence of appropriations made by  
aw.&quot; An appropriation of money to the gen-  
sral welfare, would be deemed rather a mockery  
than an obeervance of this Constitutional in­  
junction.  
2. Whether the exposition of the general  
phrasee here combatted, would not, by de-  
grees, consolidate the States into one sover­  
rignty, is a question, concerning which the  
Committee can perceive little room for differ-  
ence of opinion. To consolidate the Siates  
into one sovereignty, nothing more can be  
wanted than to supersede their respective sov-  
rreignties in the cane s reserved to them, by ex­  
tending the sovereignty of the United States, to  
all canes of the &quot;general welfare, that is to  
say, to all cases whattever,  
a. That the obvious tendency and inevitable  
result of a consolidation of the States into one  
sovereignty, would be to transform the repub.  
ican system of the United States into a mon  
archy, is a point which seems to have been suf-  
ictently decided by the general sentiment of  
America, in almost every instance of discus­  
sion relating to the consolidation in question,  
its cortsin tendency to pave the way to mon­  
archy, seems not to have been contesled. The  
proepect of such a consolidation has formed  
the only topie of controversy. It would be  
nunecessary, therefore, for the committee to  
dwell long on the reasons which support the  
psosition of the General Assembly. It may not  
be improper, however, to remark two conse  
quem es, evidently flowing from an extension of  
the Federal power to every subject falling withe  
in the idea of the &quot;general welfare.  
  
One consrquence must be to enlargs the  
aphers of discretion allotted to the Executive  
Magistrate. Even within the legislative lunits  
properly defined by the Constitution, the diff­  
culty of accommodating legal regulations to a  
country so great in estent, and so various in  
ts circumatances, has been much felt; and has  
led to occasional investments of power in the  
Executive, which involve perhaps as large a  
portion of discretion as cau be deemed conaie.  
tent with the nature of the Executive trust ln  
proportion as the objects of legislative care  
might be multiplied, would the time allowed  
for each be diminiahod, and the difficulty of pros  
viding untform and particular regulations for  
all, be increased. From these sources would  
necessarily enoue a greater latitude to the  
agency of that department which is always in  
eztatence, and which could best mould reguls  
iions of a general usture, so as to suit them to  
the diversity of particular situstions. And it  
is in this latitude, as a supplement to the deft­  
ciency of the laws, that the degese of t xecu  
tive prerogative materially consists,  
The other consequence would be, that of an  
sxcossive augmentation of the offices, honors,  
and emoiumente depending on the Eaecutive  
will. Add to the present legitimate stoch all  
these of every dearription which a consolids  
tion of the States would take from them, and  
turs over to the Federal Governtent, and the  
patronagr of the Executive would necesaarily  
be as much swelled in this case as its preroga.  
tive would be in the other  
This eproportionate increase of prerogative  
and patesangy, must evidently either enable the  
Ctef Magistents of the Union, by qulet means,  
to egpure hle ro clostion from tiee to time, and  
Eaay, to regulate the sueseasion as he migh

! 0a lms resolution the Committee hav  
test  
ow-  
ed all the attention which its importance merits:  
They have scanned it not merely with a strict, but  
with a severe eye ; and they feel confidence in  
pronouncing; that, in its just and fair construc­  
tion, it is unexceptionably true in its several posi­  
tions, as well as constitutional and conclusive ia  
its inferences.  
The resolution declares, y?rJ, that &quot; h views  
the powers of the Federal Government as re­  
sulting from the compact to which the States  
are parties ; &quot; in other words, that the Federal  
powers are derived from the Constitution ; and  
that the Constitution is a compact to which the  
States are parties.  
Clear as the position must seem, that the Fed­  
eral powers are derived from the Constitution, and  
from that alone, the Committee are not unappris­  
ed of a late doctrine, which opens another source&#x27;  
of Federal powers, not less extensive and impor­  
tant, than it is new and unexpected. The exami­  
nation of this doctrine will be most conveniently  
connected with a review of a succeeding resolu­  
tion. The Committee satisfy themselves hers  
with briefly remarking, that iu all the contempo­  
rary discussions and comments which the Consti­  
tution underwent, it was constart ly justified and  
recommended, on the ground that the powers not  
given to the Government, were withheld&quot; from it ;  
and that if any doubt could have existed on this  
subject, under the original text of the Constitu­  
tion, it is removed, as far as words could remove  
it. bv th 1 (it Ik  
! Constitution, which expressly declares &quot;that the  
P Wtrs not dH-ted to the United States, by the  
&#x27; 1 &#x27; J  
(Jonsti  
tuuon, nor prohibited by it to the States, are  
reserved to the States respectively, or to the peo­  
ple. &quot;  
The other position involved in this branch cf  
the resolution, namely, &quot;that the States are par­  
ties to this Constitution or compact,&quot; is in the  
judgment of the Committee, equally free from  
objection. It is indVed true that the term &#x27;States&#x27;  
is sometimes used in a vague sense, and some­  
times in different senses, according to the subject  
to which it ia applied. Thus, it sometimes means  
the separate sections of territory occupied by the  
political societies within each ; sometimes the par­  
ticular Governments established by those socie­  
ties ; sometimes those societies as organized int  
those particular Governments ; and lastly, it means  
the people composing those political societies, in  
their highest sovereign capacity. Although it  
might be wished that the perfection of language  
admitted less diversity in tho signification of the  
same words, yet little inconvenience, is produced  
by it where the true sense can be collected with­  
certainty from the different applications.- In the

of the term ciau.-.-, ...,v  
have been entertained, all will at least concur in  
.1. ,f i.,at mentioned: because in that sense the  
  
lUik J.i &quot;  
Constitution was submitted to the &#x27;&#x27;States;&quot; in  
that sense the &quot;States&quot; ratified it : and that sense  
of the term &quot;States,&quot; they are consequently par­  
lies to the compact from which the powers of the  
federal Government result.  
The next position is, that the General Assembly  
views the powers of the Federal Government &quot;as  
limito 1 by the plain sense and intention of the in  
  
urnment constituting that compact, and as no  
  
----- tt  
farther valid than they are authorized by the  
  
grants tnerem enumeraiea. n uoes noi crm  
possible that any just objection can lie against  
tuhcr of those clauses. The first amounts mere­  
ly to a declaration that the compact ought to have  
the interpretation plainly intended by the parties  
to it ; the other, to a declaration that it ought to  
have the execution and effect intended by them.  
If the powers granted be valid, it is solely because  
they are granted : and, if the granted powers are  
valid, because granted, all other powers not grant­  
ed must not be valid.  
The resolution having taken this view of the  
Federal compact, proceeds to infer, &quot;that, in case  
of a deliberate, palpable, and dangerous exercise,  
of other powers, not granted by the said compact,  
the Suites who are parties thereto have the right,  
  
t.nd are in duty bound, to interpose for arresting  
the progress of the evil, and fur maintaining,  
within their respective limits, the authorities,  
rights, and libeaties, appertaining to them.&quot;

eign parties to the Constitution, the decisions of  
the other departments, not carried by the forms  
of the Constitution, before the Judiciary, must be  
  
equally authoritative and final with the decisions  
  
of that department. 13ut the proper answer to  
  
the objection is that the resolution of the General  
Assembly relates to those great and extraordinary  
cases in which all the forms of the Constitution  
may prove ineffectual against infractions danger­  
ous to the essential rights of the parties to it.  
The resolution supposes that dangerous powers,  
not delegated, may not only be usurped and exe­  
cuted by the other dapartments, but that the Ju­  
dicial department also may exercise or sanction  
  
dangerous powers, beyond the grant of the Con­  
stitution ; and, consequently, that the ultimate  
right of the parties to the Constitution to judge  
whether the compact has been dangerously viola­  
ted, must extend to violations by one delegated  
authority, as well as by another ; by the Judiciary  
as well as by the Executive or the Legislature.  
  
However, true, therefore, it may be that the  
Judicial department is, in all questions submitted  
to it by the forms of the Constitution, to decide  
in the last resort, this resort must necessarily be  
  
deemed the last in relation to the authorities of  
  
the other departments of the Government ; hot  
  
in relation to the rights of the parties to the con  
  
stitutional compact, from which the Judicial as  
  
well as the other departments hold their delega  
ted trusts. On any other hypothesis, the delega  
  
tion of judicial power would annul the authority  
delegating it : and the concurrence of this depart-  
  
nu n!, with the others in usurped Movers, might  
  
subvert forever, and beyond the possible reach of

only deeply essentially affecting the vital priuci­

The resolution has, accordingly, guarded a­  
giinst any misapprehension of its object, by ex­  
l rcs-ly requiring for such an interposition &quot;the  
case of a deliberate, ialpable, and daaytrovs

a final consideration and deliberate adherence.  
Is is no 5 necessary, because the resolution does  
not require that the question should be discussed,  
how far the exercise of any particular power, 1111­  
granted by the Constitution, would justify the  
interposition of the parties to it. As cases might  
easily be stated, which none would contend ought

that there may be instances of usurped power,

cannot be cancelled, abridged, restrained, or modi­

the liberty of conscience and freedom of the press

two articles providing, the one for the liberty of  
conscience, the other for freedom of speech and of  
the press.&quot; Again:  
Both of these rights-the liberty of conscience  
and of the press--rest equally on the original ground  
of not being delegated by the constitution, and conse­  
muently withheld from the Government. Any con,­

Extract from Madison&#x27;s Report. &quot;But  
it is objected, that the Jupicial Ytenon  
ary is to be regarded as the sole clpositor  
af the Constitution in the laxt resort; and  
t may be asked for what reason, the dec  
laration by the General Assembly, suppo  
sing it to be theoretically true, couldI  
quired at the present day, and in so solemn  
a mnannen  
&quot;On this ohjection it might be ohserved,  
arst; that there may be instances of  
usurped power, which the forms of the­  
Constitution would never draw within th  
control of the judicial department: second  
ly, that if the decision of the Judiciary be­  
raised above the authority of the sovereign  
parties to the Constitution, the decisions of  
the other departments, not carried by the  
ms of the Constitution before the jus  
liciary, must be equally authoritive and  
inal with the decisions of that department  
lut the proper answer to the objection is,  
hat the resolution of the Greneral Assembly  
clates to those great and extraordmary  
ases, in which all the forms of the Con  
titution may prove ineffectual against in  
ractions dangerous the essential rights  
of the parties to it. The resolution sup  
oses that dangereus powers not delegated,  
nay not only be usurped and executed by  
other departments, but that the Judicial  
Iepartment, also, may exercise or sanction  
langerous powers beyond the grant of the  
onstitution; and, consequently, that the  
ritimate right of the parties to the Consti  
ution, to judge whether the compact has  
een dangerously violated, must extend to  
tiolations by one delegated authority as  
vell as another; by the Judiciary, as well  
as by the Executive, or the Legislature  
However true, therefore, it may be that  
he judicial department is, in all quect  
  
submitted to it by the forms of the   
tuition, to decide in the last resort I  
resort must necessarily be deemed the

ination of this doctrine will be most con  
atly connected with a review of a suc­  
ceeding resolution. The  
  
clliseives Here wih brieiy reliaril liet  
in all the contemporary discussions and  
which the Constitution under  
went, it was constantly justified and recom  
mended, on the ground that the powers not  
given to the Government, were withheld  
from it; and that if any doubt could haye  
existed on this subject, under the original  
text of the Constitution, it is remoy  
far as words could remove it, by the 1lth  
amendment, now a part of the Constitutio  
which expressly declares &quot;tha  
not dolegated to the United States, by the  
Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the  
States, arn reserved to the States:  
ly, or to the people  
I he other position involved in this branch  
of the resolution, namele, &quot;that the States  
are parties to the Constilution or compact,  
a in the judgment of the commitlee, equal  
tree from obection. It is indeed true that  
the term &quot;States&quot; is sometimes used in a  
vagne sonse, and sometimes in iflerent  
senses, accortding to the subect to which if  
is applied. Thus, it sometimes means t  
separate seclionn of territury oceupned by  
the political socnties within each  
times the partigular Governments establish  
ed by those socicties; sometimes those so  
cieties are organied tiito those particular  
Crovernmients, and, lastly, if means th  
people composing these political societies,  
in their highest sovereign capacity. Al  
though it might be wished that the pers  
tion of langunge aduntted less diversity i  
the siguification of the same words, vet  
tle inconvenience is produced by it whero  
the trne sense can be collected with certain  
ty from the different applications. In  
present instance, whatever different con  
structions of the term &quot;States, in the res-  
olution, may have been entertained, all will  
at least concur in that last mentioned;I  
canse in that sense the Constitution w  
submitted to the &quot;States;&quot; in that sense  
the &quot;States ratified it; and in that s  
of the term&quot; States, they are consequ  
parties to the compact from which I  
powers of the Federal Government resull  
The next position is, that the Gonmral  
Assembly views the powers of the Fndoral  
  
and intention of the instrument constituling  
that compact,&quot; and &quot;as no farther valid  
than they are anthorized by the grants  
therein enumerated.&quot; It does not  
possible that any just objection canI  
against either of these clanses. The first  
amounts merely to a declaration that the  
compact ought to have the mterpreta  
plainly intended by the parties to it; th  
other, to a declaration that it ought to have  
the execution and effect intended by them  
If the powers granted be valid, it is s­  
becanse they are granted; and, if the grant  
ed powers are valid, because granted, all  
  
other o   e o   
Ihe resolution having taken  
the Federal compact, proceeds to  
&quot;that, in case of a deliberate, palpable, and  
dangerous exercise, of other powers, nol  
ranted by the said compact, the  
who are parties thereto have the right, a  
are in duty bound, to interpose for arrests  
ing the progress of the evil, and for ma  
taining, within their respect  
anthorities, rights, and liberties, apperta  
ing to them  
it appears to your Committee to  
plain principle, founded in common­  
illusteated by common practice, ande­  
tial to the nature of compacts that, w  
can be had to no tribunal supertor to  
the authority of the parties, the parties  
themseives must be the righttul judges, in  
the last resort, whether the bargain mad  
has been pursned or violated. The   
titution of the United Stites was for  
by the sanction of the States, given by each  
in its sovereign capacity. It adds to  
stability and dignity, as well as to the an  
rity of the Constitution, that it rests  
this legitimate and solid foundalion. I  
States, then, being the parties to the con  
itutional compact, and in their sovereign  
capacity, it follows of necessity that there  
can be no tribunal above their authority, to  
decide, in the last resort, whether the com­  
pact made by them be violated; and con  
quently, that, as to the parties to it, they  
must themselves decide, in the last res  
such anestions as may be of suflicient ma  
nitude to require their interp  
lt does not follow, however, that becaus  
the States as sovereign parties to their o­  
stitutional compact, must ultimately decid  
whether it has been violated, that such a  
decision ought to be interposed either in a  
hasty manner or on doubtful and inferior  
necasions. Iven in the case of ordinary  
Conventions between diflerent nations  
where, by the strict rule of interpretation, a  
breach of a part may be deemed  
breach of the whole--every part bein  
deemed a condition of every other part, ain  
if the wholeit is always laid down tha  
the breach must be both willul and mnatertat,  
  
to justify an application of the rule. But  
in the case of an intimate and Constitutional  
Union, itke that of the United States, it is  
it that the interposition of the parties,  
in their sovereign capacity, can be called  
for by occasions only, deeply and essentially  
affecting the vital principles of their polin  
cal system.  
The resolution have, accordingly, guard  
ed against any misapprehension of its oh  
ject, by expressly requiring for such an in  
terposition &quot; the case of a deliberate paipa  
and dunncrons breach of the Constitn  
tion, by the exercise of powers nof grunted  
by it. It must be a case, not of a light and  
transient nature but of a nature, dungerons  
to the great purposes for which the Consti  
tution was established. It must be a case,  
moreover, not obscure or doubtful in its con  
action, but plain and palpuble. Lasthy  
it must be a case not resulting from a pars  
tial consideration, or hasty determination;  
but a case stamped with a final consideration  
and deliberale adherence. It is not neces  
sary, because the resolution does not re  
quire that the question should be discussed,  
how far the excrcise of any particular pow  
er, ungranted by the Constitution, would  
justify the interposition of the parties to it.  
As cases might easily be stated, which none  
would contend ought to fall within thatd  
scription; cases on the other hand, might,  
with equal ease, be stated, so llagrant and  
so fatal, as to unite every opinion in placing  
them within the description,  
But this resolution has done more than  
guard against misconstruction, by o  
ly referting to cases of a deliberale, puipu­  
  
ble, and dungerous nature. I specilies  
object of the interpusition which it contem  
plates, to be solely that of arresting the  
progress of the cemd, of usurpation, and of  
maintamning the authorities, rights, and lih­  
erties, appertaining to the States, as parties  
to the Constaiu!  
From this view of the resolution, if  
would seem inconceivable that it can incur  
mny just disapprobation from those who,  
lavin aside all momentary impressions, and  
recollecting the genuine source and object  
the Federal Constitution, shall candidly  
I accurately interpret the meaning of the  
General Asseibly. If the deliberate exer  
cise of dangerous powers, palpably with  
held by the Constitution, could not justity  
the parties to it in interposing, even so far  
as to arrest the progress of the evil; and  
thereby to preserve the Constitution it self,  
as well as to provide for the salety of the  
ties to it, there would be an end to all  
relief from usurped power, and a direct sub  
of the rights specilied or recognized  
al th State Constitutions, as wi  
as a plain donia&#x27; of the fundamental princi  
 which our independence itself was  
deciared.  
Bnt it is objected, that the Judicial an­  
thority is to be regarded as the sole exposi  
r of the Constitution, in the last resort.  
and it may be asked for what reason the  
by the General Assembly, sup  
posing it to be theoretically true, could be  
required at the present day, and in sos  
enilt a manner.  
On this objection it might be observed  
that there may be instances of usurns  
d power, which the forms of the Constitu  
tion would nover draw within the control  
 the Judicial department; secanairg, that  
the decision of the judiciary  
we the anthority of the sovereign pat  
ties to the Constitution, the decisions of the  
other departments, not carried by the forms  
the Conslitution before the Judiciary,  
must be equally authoritative and final w  
the decisions of that department. But th  
proper answer to the objection is, the  
 of the General Assembly relates  
to those gteat and extraordinary cases in  
which all the forms of the Constitutin may  
prove ineflectual against infractions dange  
ous to the essential rights of the parties to  
it. The resolution supposes that danger  
ous powers, not delegated, may not only be  
ustteped and executed by the other depart  
but that the Judicial department also  
ay exercise or sanction dangerous pow,  
 the grant of the Constitu­  
and, consequently, that the ultimate right  
to the Conslitulion to  
whethot the compact has been dangerously  
must extend to violations by one  
delagated anthosity, as well as by another  
by the duudiciary, as well as by the Execn  
tive or the laeuisiatul  
  
Ilowover true, therelore, it miay bd tib  
the Judicial depactment is, in all  
aubimitted to it by the forms of the Coust  
tution, to decide in the last resort, this re  
essarily be deemed the las  
relation to the authorities of the other de­  
nents of the Government,  
to the rights of the parties to the con  
 rom which  
ctal as woll as other departments hold theit  
tted trusts. On any other hypothesis,  
the delegation of judicial power would an  
d the authority delegating it; and the con  
ace of this department with the others  
in usurped powers, might subvert forev  
and beyond the possible reach of any  
omedy, the very Constitution which a  
were instituted to preserve  
The truth declared in the resolution be  
shed, the expediency of mak  
feclaration at the present day may sa  
ly be left to the temperate consideration  
candid padgment of the America  
ablic. It will be remembered, that a fre  
quent recurrence to fundamental prineig  
is solemnly entoined by most of the Stan  
Constitutions, and particularly by our own,  
is a necessary safoguard against the danger  
il degeneracy to which republics are lial  
as well as other Governments, though in a  
less degree than others. And a lair com  
parison of the pobtical doctrines not nulre  
quent at the present day, with those which  
characterised the epoch of our Revolution  
and which form the basis of our Republican  
Constitutions, will best determine whethe  
the declatory recurrence here made to those  
principles ought to be viewed as unseason  
able and improper, or as a vigilant diss  
harge of an important duty. The author  
ity of Constitutions over Governments, and  
the sovereignty of the people over ton  
stitutions, are truths which are at all times  
essary to be kept in mind; and at no  
time, perhaps, more necessary than al  
present.  
The fourth resolution stands as follows  
That the General Assembly doth also  
express its deep regret that a spirit has, in  
sundry instances, been manifested by the  
I ederal Government, to enlarge its powers,  
by forced constructions of the consbitution  
al charter which defines them; and that  
  
indications have appeared of a design to  
expound certain general phrases twhi ch,  
having been copied from the very limit ed  
grant of powers in the former Articles of  
Confederation, were the less liable to le  
misconstrued,) so as to destroy the meard­  
ing and effect of the particular enumeratio.  
which necessarily explains and limits the  
general phrases, and so as to consolidate  
the States by degrees into one sovereignty;  
the obvious tendency and inevitable result  
of which would be to transform the present  
Republican system of the United States  
into an absolute, or at best a mixed mon  
archy.&quot;  
The first quustion here to be considered  
is, whether a spirit has, in sundry instances,  
been manifested by the Federal Govern­  
ment to enlarge its powers by forced con­  
structions of the constitutional charter.  
The General Assembly having declared  
their opinion, merely by regretting in gen  
eral terms, that forced constructions for  
larging the F&#x27;ederal powers have taken  
place, it does not appear to the committee  
necessary to go into a specification of eve  
ery instance to which the resolution may  
allude. The Alien and Sedition acts bein  
particularly named in a succeeding resolu  
tion, are of course to be understood as in  
cluded in the allusion. Omitting others  
which have less occupied public attention,  
or been less extensively regarded as uncon­  
stitutional, the resolution may be presumed  
to refer particularly to the Bank Law, which  
  
from the circumstances of ds passage, as  
well as the latitude of construction on  
which it is founded, strikes the attention  
with singular force, and the carriage tax,  
distinguished also by circumstances in its  
history having similar tendency. Those  
instances alone, if resulting from forced  
coustruction, and caleulated to enlarge the  
powers of the Federal Government, as the  
committee cannot but conceive to be the  
alliciently warrant this part of the­  
resolution. The committee have not thought  
it incumbent on them to extend their atten-  
in to laws which have been objected to,  
tather as varving the constitutional distti­  
 bution of powers in the Federal Govern­  
ment, than as an absolute enlargement of  
them; becanse instances of this sort, how  
ver important in their principles and ten-  
dencies, do not appear to fall strictly within  
 the text under review.  
The other questions presenting them­  
are-I Whethsr indications have  
appeared of a design to expound certain  
ral phrases copied from the &quot;articles  
of Confederation,&quot; so as to destroy the ef  
sect of the particular enumeration explain  
 Wheth  
er this exposition would by degrees consol.  
idate the States into one sovereignty.   
Whether the tendency and result of this  
consolidation would be to transform the re  
publican system of the United States into  
a lHolatel  
1. The general phrases here meant must  
e those &quot;of providing for the common  
defence and genecal welfare  
in the &quot;Articles of Conlederation&quot; the  
are used as follows, in At VIII.  
&quot;Al charges of war, and all other expenses  
that shall be incuered tor the common de  
ad general weltare, and allowed by  
the I aited States in Congress assembled,  
 be detrayed out of a common treasus  
hich shall be supplied by the several  
tes, in proportion to the value of all  
and within each State, granted to, or sur­  
veved for any person: as such land and the  
buildings and improvements thereon shall  
estimated, according to such mode as  
the I nited States in Cnngress assembled,  
shall from time direct and appoint  
In the existing Constitution, they make  
the following part of See. : &quot;The con  
all have power, to lay and collect  
duties, imposts, and exercises, to pay  
the debts, and provide for the common de­  
I general welfare of the United  
This similarity in the use of these phrases  
in the two great I ederal charters, might  
well be considered, as rendering their mean  
ing less hable to be misconstrued in the  
latter; beenase it will scarcely be said, that  
in the former, they were ever understood to  
be either a general grant of power, or to  
authorize the requisition or application of  
oney by the old Congress to the common  
seral wellare, excapt in ea­  
  
taatle hitil ait ae.  
and limited the meaning attached to these  
phrases in the vecy instrument revised and  
remodeled by the present Conslitution, it  
can never be supposed that when copied  
 Constitution, a difterent me  
ought to be attached to them  
That, notwithstanding this remarkabl  
security against misconstruction, a design  
has been indicated to expound these  
the Constitution, so as to dastroy the­  
ect of the particular enumeration of  
wers by which it explams and limits them,  
nust have failen under the observation of  
those who have attended to the course of  
public transactions. Not to multiply proots  
on this subject, it will suffice to refer to the  
debates of the lederal Legisiature, in which  
argnments have on difforent occasions been  
drawn, with apparent effect, from these  
phrases, in their indefinite me  
To these indications might be adiled,  
without looking farther, the official report  
on manufactures by the late Secretary of  
Treasury, made on the 5th of Decenbe  
101; and the report of a Committee of  
Congress, in January, 1797, on the promo  
tion of agriculture. In the first of these  
it is expressly contended to belong &quot;tot  
diseretion of the National Legisiature  
pronounce upon the objects which concern  
the general welture, and for which, under  
that description, an appropriation of money  
is requisite and proper. And there seem to  
be no room for a doubt, that whatever e  
a the general interests of feurntag, of  
agricuiture, of munntactures, and of com  
aerce, are within the sphere of National  
Couneils, ay tur ax regards on appiicoltun  
money.&quot; The latter report assumies  
same latitude of power in the Na  
Councils, and applies it to the encou  
ment of agriculture, by means of a socicty  
to be established at the seat of Governmen  
Although neither of these reports may have  
received the sanction of a law carrving it  
into efiect; vet, on the other hand, the  
traordinary doctrine contained in both, has  
passed without the slightest positive mark  
of disapprobation from the authority  
which it was addressed  
Now, whether the phrases in quest  
construed to authorize every  
relating to the common defence and  
  
eral welfare, as contended by some; of  
every ciensure only in which there might  
be an application of money, as suggested  
by the caution of others; the effect must  
substantially be the same, in destroying the  
inport and force of the particnlar enumer  
tion of powers which follow these general  
 phrases in the Constitution. For, it is evi  
 dent, that there is not a single power what  
ever, which may not have some reference  
to the common defence, or the general wel  
fare; nor a power of any magnitude, which,  
in its exercise, does not involve or admit an  
application of money. The Government,  
t herefore, which possesses power in either  
o he or other of these extents, is a Govern  
ment without the limitations formed by a  
pagticular enumeration of powers; and  
co nsequently, the meaning and effect of  
this particular enn  
by the exposition given to these general  
phrases.  
This conclusion  
an attempt to qualify the po  
&quot;general welfare  
where the nencral  
reach of the separate provisions by  
indieidnul At  
their jurisdictions in eases, to which  
separate provisions may be competen  
For, as the authority of the individn  
States must in all  
general regulations  
whole, the authority of the U. States wou!  
be extended to every object relating to   
  
general welfare, which might,  
sibility, be provided for by the gener  
thority. This qualifving consti  
ore would have little, if any tendency,  
circumscribe the sower claimed under  
the latitude of the terms &quot;general wel  
fare.&quot;  
The true and fair construction of this  
on, doth in the orig.  
Iederal compacts, ppear to the Commits  
tee too olivious to he mistaken. In both,  
the Congress is aut isrised to provide mioney  
for the common de  
fure. In both, is subjoined to this anthori  
ty, an enumeratior of the cases, to which  
their power shall eatend. Money eannot be  
applied to the generulivclture, otherwis  
than by an application of it to some pa  
ulur measure, conducive to the general wel  
fare. Whenever, therefore, money has been  
by the general authority and is  
e applied to a palicular measure, a ques  
tion arises whether the perticular measure  
be within the enumerated authirities vested  
aConuress. If it be, the money roqnisite  
for it may be applied to it; if it be not, no  
such application can be made. This fair  
and obvions interpretalion coincides wil  
and is enforced ber the clause in the con­  
stitution, which  
shall be drawn from the treacury, but i  
consequence of appropriations mande by  
law.&quot; An appre  
general welfare, wou  
amoer tan  
stitutional injunction  
ee.  
  
grees, consolidat the States int  
eignty, 18 ad  
Commttee can  
ference of opition. To consolidate the States  
into one sovereignty nothing more can be  
wanted than to supersede their respective­  
overeignties in the cases reserved to them,  
nding the sovereignty of the United  
States, to all cases of the &quot;general wel  
fare,&quot; that is to say, to all cases whatecer.  
hat the obvious tendency and ine  
table result of a consolidation of the s  
into one sovereignty, would be to trans  
i the republiean system of the United  
States into a monarchy, is a point which  
seems to have been suffciently decided by  
the general sentiment of America. In al  
most every instance of discussion relaling  
to the consolidation in question, its certain  
tendency to oave the way to monarchy,  
seems not to have been contested.  
prospect of such a consolidation has form  
ed the only topie of controversy. It would  
unnecessary therefore, for the comiit-  
eto dwell long on the reasons which sup  
of the General Asscial  
It may not be improper, however, to remark  
two consequences, evidently flowing from  
an extension of the Federal power to every  
thin the idea of the &quot;gen­  
eral welfare  
  
s ceitialiss iust beto eidte t  
sphere of discretion allotted to the Execu  
tive Magistrate. Even within the legisla  
tive limits properly defined by the Const  
tution, the difliculty of accommodating le­  
gal regulations to a country so great in  
extent, and so various in its circumstang  
has been much felt; and has led to ocen  
sional investments of power in the Execu  
tive, which involve perhaps as large a pors  
tion of discretion as can be deemed con  
sistent with the nature of the Lxecutive  
trust. In proportion as the objects of leg  
slative care might be multiplied, would the  
time allowed for eath be diminisher  
the difficulty of providing uniform and pa  
ticular regulations for all, be inery  
From these sources would necessarily en  
sue a greater latitude to the agency of that  
artment which is always in existence,  
I which could best mould regulations of  
a general nature, so as to suit them to the  
cular sitnations. And it  
is in this latitude, as a supplement to the  
eficiency of the laws, that the degree of  
lvecutive prerogative materially consists,  
The other consequence would be, that  
of an excessive augmentation of the offices,  
honors, and emoluments depending on the  
lxecutive will. Add to the present  
mate stock all those of every descriptior  
which a consolidation of the States w  
take from them, and turn over to the led  
eral Government, and the patronage of the  
Executive would necessarily be as  
welled in this case as its prerogative wouhl  
be in the other.

slaves will be represented. The true question  
is one of property, aud the political power fol­  
lows as an incident. Let us examine the his­  
tory of this three-fifths representation.  
In the eighth article of the old confederation,  
I find the following clause:  
&#x27;&quot; All charges of war, and allother expenses that  
shall be incurred for the common defense or gen­  
?ral wel/are, and allowed by the United States in  
| Congress assembled, shall be defrayed out ofa com­  
mon treasury, which shall be supplied by the sever  
al States, in proportion to the value of all land within  
each State, granted to or surveyed for cnch per­  
son, as such land and the buildings and improve­  
ments thereon shall be estimated, according to such  
mode as the United States in Congress assembled  
shall from time to time direct and appoint.&quot;  
By this article it will be seen that the value  
of lands and improvements was made the rule  
for apportioning the public burdens and taxes  
between the States. In 1783, after the war,  
and when it was necessary to make provision  
for paying the public debt, the northern and  
eastern States moved that this rule be changed,  
aud that people, including the whites and three­  
fifths of the slaves be adopted in its stead. They  
insisted upon a greater proportion than three

Legislative power was maintnined to be as

in the British parliament. And the rovul  
pierogative w aa in fmce in each Colony, by

Executive Magistrate, -is it was in Great  
Britian, by virtue of a like acknowledgment  
there. A denial of these principles by  
Great Britain, and the assertion of them by  
America, produced the Revolution.&quot;  
Mr Madison adds, in substance, that tacitly,  
and for convenience. Great Britain was  
allowed to regulate the trade with foreign  
Nntions, and between the different parts of  
the Empire. But, when it was asserted  
that Parliament could legislate for the Col  
rnics in all cases uh oecer, it provoked  
such enquiry as sheweu :t could do so in no

The very assertion, however, of such doctrine is an  
abandonment of the argument.  
An elaborate effort has been made to establish an  
identity of relation between the colonies of Great  
Britain and a Territory to the United State.-&#x27; The  
opinion of Mr. Madison on the causes of the rev-  
  
olution is as follows. I will thank my friend to  
read it :  
&quot;The fundamental principle of the revolution  
was, that the colonies were co-ordinate members  
with each other, and with Great Britain ; of an em­  
pire, united by a common executive sovereign, but  
not united by any common legislative sovereign.  
The legislative power was maintained to be as com­  
plete in each American Parliament as in the British  
Parliament. And the royal prerogative was in force  
in each colony, by virtue of its acknowledging the  
King for its Executive Magistrate, as it was in Great  
Britain, by virtue of a like acknowledgement there.  
A denial of these principles by Great Britain, and  
the assertion of them by America, produced the  
revolution.&quot;  
Mr. Madison adds, in substance, that tacitly, and  
for convenience, Great Britain was allowed to regu­  
late the trade with foreign nation, and between the  
different parts of the empire. But when it was as­  
serted that Parliament could legislate for the colo­  
nies in all canes whatsoever, it provoked such inqui­  
ry as showed it could tlo so in no case whatsoever.  
If then, they stand in relations identical or analo-  
  
p-ons.  
what is the true condition ot tne lerritones I  
They are co ordinate members with each other, and  
with the United States of a common empire

of all the powers of the national Government, and  
that they even contemplated forcible resistance to  
Federalauthority. Mr. Madison, in his celebrated  
report in the Virginia Legislature, takes up these  
objections, and shows, to my mind most clearly,  
that the resolutions looked to no such result. That  
report shows another fact; and that is, there was  
no design then to repudiate the authority of the  
Federal judiciary to make decisions binding on the  
States in reference to a violation of State riehts.  
The report says:  
  
is now  
  
*Tt has been said that it belongs tothe judictary, and not  
to the State Legislatures, to declare the meaning of the  
Federal Constitution. But a declaration that proceedings  
ot the Federal Government are not warranted by the Con-  
stitution is a novelty neither among the citizens nor among  
the Legislatures of the States; nor are the citizens or the  
Legislature of Virginia singular in the example of it. Nor  
can the declarations of either, whether affirming or denying  
the coustitutionality of measures of the Federal Govern  
ment, or whether made before or after judicial decisions  
thereon, be deemed in any point of view an assumption of  
the office of judge. ‘The declarations in such cases are ex  
pressions of opinions, unaccompanied with any other effect  
than what they may produce on opinion, by exciting reflec  
tion. ‘The expositions of the judiciary, on the other hand,  
are carried into immediate effect by force. The former  
may lead to a change in the legislative expression of the  
general will, possibly to a change in the opiniou of the  
judiciary ; the latter enforces the general wili, whilst that  
will and that opinion continue unchanged.”’  
  
After arguing the propriety of a legislative dee-  
laration of the unconstitutionality of the alien and  
sedition law, the report then proceeds to state  
that the Legislatures of the States have a right to  
originate amendments to the Constitution by a  
concurrence of two thirds of them; and argues  
that this was one of the modes of interposition  
failing within the purview of the resolutions. The  
report theif proceeds as follows:  
  
‘It is lastly to be seen whether the confidence expressed  
by the resolution, that the necessary and proper measures  
would be taken by the other States for co. perating with  
Virginia in maintaining the rights reserved to the States or  
to the people, be in any degree liable to the objections  
raised against it. If it be liable to objection, it must be be  
cause either the object or the means are objectionable. The  
object being to maintain what the Constitution has ordained,  
is in itself a laudable object. The means are expressed in  
the terms necessary and proper. &lt;A proper object was to be  
pursued by means both necessary and proper.  
  
“To find an objection, then. it must be shown that some  
meaning was annexed to these general terns which was not  
proper; and for this purpose, either that the means used b)  
the General Assembly were an example of improper means,  
orthat there were no proper means to which the terms could  
refer. In the example given by the State, of declaring the  
alien and sedition law to be unconstitutional, and ot come  
municating the declaration to other States, no trace of im-  
proper means has appeared. And if the other States had  
concurred in making a like declaration, supported, too, by

employed which are strictly within the limits of the Con-  
stitution. ‘The Legislatures of the States might have made  
a direct representation to Congress with a view to obtain a  
rescinding of the two offensive acts; or they might have  
represented to their respeective Senators in Congress their  
wish that two thirds thereof would propose an explanatory  
amendment of the Constitution; or two thirds of them  
selves, if such had been their option, might, by an applica

object. ‘These several means, though not equally eligible  
in themselves, nor probably to the States, were all constitu

Courtis the arbiter, and that having decided, it was  
right; and they reproached the State of Virginia  
for her manly vindication of the Constitution and  
the rights of man and the liberty of speech. And  
Mr. Madison expressly, in his report in reply to

department is, in all questions submitted to it by the forms  
of the Constitution, to decide in the last resort, this resort  
must necessarily be deemed the last in relation to the au-

in relation to the rights of the parties to the constitutional  
compact, from which the judicial, as well as the other de-  
partments, bold their delegated trusts. On any other hy-  
pothesis, the delegation of judicial power would annul the  
authority delegating it; and the concurrence of this depart-

“ But it is objected that the judicial authority is to be re-  
garded a» the sole expositor of the Constitation, in the last  
resort; and it may be asked tor what reason the declara-  
tion by the General Assembly, supposing it to be theoreti-  
cally true, could be required at the present day, and in so  
solemn a manner,  
  
* On this objection it might be observed: first, that there |  
may be instances of usurped power, which the forms of |  
  
the Constitution would never draw within the control of  
the judicial department; secondly, that if the decision of  
the judiciary be raised above the authority of the sovereign  
parties to the Constitution, the decisions of the other de-  
partments, not carried by We forms of the Constitution be-  
tore the judiciary, must be equally authoritative and final  
with the decisions of that department. But the proper an-  
ewer to the objection is, that the resolution of the General  
Assembly relates to those great and extraordinary cases in  
which all the tuorins of the Constitution may prove ineffee-  
tual against infractions dangerous to the essential rights of  
the parties to it. The resolution supposes that dangerous  
powers, not delegated, may not only be usurped and exe-  
cuted by the other departinents, but that the judicial de-  
parunent also may exercise or sanction dangerous powers  
beyond the grant of the Constitution; and consequently  
that the ultimate right of the parties to the Constitution to  
judge whether the compact has been dangerously violated,  
iuust extend to violations by one delegated authority as  
well as by another—by the judiciary as well as by the Ex-  
ecutive or the Legislature.  
  
* However true, therefore, it may be that the judicial  
departinent is,in ail questions submitted to it by the torms  
of the Constitution, to decide in the last resort, this resort  
  
st necessarily be deeme &gt; fast i ‘latio 2au- || cip ’ &quot;or ; .  
must necessarily be deemed the last in relation to the au- || sir, I may havea very disagreeable neighbor, or  
  
thorities of the other departinents of the Governinent; not  
in relation to the rights of the parties to the constitutional  
  
compact, frow which the judicial, as well as the other ||  
  
departments, hold their delegated trusts. Onany other hy  
pothesis, the delegation of judicial power would annul the  
authority delegating it; and the concurrence of this de-  
parunent with the others in usurped powers might subvert  
forever, and beyond the possible reacii of any righttul rem

granted. The ratification was hnany effected, not only  
without the allowance of this condition, but in the face  
of its open denial, as being incompatible with the nature  
of the instrument, and was therefore a virtual and irre­  
vocable abandonment of this claaim as an organic or fun­  
damental right reserved to any State.  
If additional evidence in testimony of this fact were  
needed for the conviction of Virginians, we might find it  
in the very terms employed by the Convention of that

that ratification was as follows:  
&quot;We, the delegates of the people of Virginia, duly  
elected, in pursuance of a recommendation from the Gen­  
eral Assembly, and now met in Conven ion, having fully  
and freely investigated and discussed the proceedings of  
the Federal Convention, and being prepared, as well as  
the most mature deliberation hath enabled us, to decide  
thereon, do, in the name and in behalf of the people of  
Firginia, declare and make known that the powers grant  
ed under the Constitution, neing Derived FrOM the eo­  
ele oF the Unired States, may be resumed ny then  
whensoever the same shall be perverted to their injury or  
oppression; and that every power not granted thereby  
remains with them and at their will; that, therefore, no  
right of any denomination can be cancelled, abridged,  
restrained or modified by the Congress, by the Senate  
and House of Representatives acting in any capacity, by

If additional evidence in testimony of this  
fact were needed for the conviction of Vir­

employed by the Convention of that State in  
ratifying the Federal Constitution. The  
torm of that ratification was as follows:  
 We, the delegates of the people of Virgin.  
duly elected, in pursuance of a recommen­  
dation from the General Assembly, and now  
met in Convention, having fully and freely  
investigated and discussed the proceedings of  
theFederal Convention, and being prepared,

&quot; It appears to your committee to be  
a plain principle founded it) common sense,  
illustrated by common practice, and essential  
to the nature of compacts; that  
when resort can be bad to no tribunal superior  
  
to the parties, the parties themselves must be  
the judges iu the last resort, whether the bargain  
made has been preserved or violated.?  
The Constitution of the United Slates was  
formed by the sanction of the States, given by  
each in its sovereign capacity.&#x27;&#x27;  
&quot;It adds to the stability and dignity-, as well  
as to the authority of the Constitution, that it  
rests on this legitimate and solid foundation.?  
The States then, being the parties to the constitutional  
compact, and in their sovereign capacity,  
it follows of necessity, that there can  
be no tribunal above their authority, to decide  
in the last resort whether the compact made  
by them be violated ; and consequently, that,  
as the parties to it, they must themselves decide  
in the last resort, such questions as may  
be of sufficient magnitude to require their interposition.

namely; &quot;that the State are absolute sovereign  
ties; that tbey are the parties to the Federal Com  
pact, and that as parties thereto tbey bave  
right, and are in duty bound, to interpose  
arresting the progress of the evil, the Alien  
Sedition laws; and for maintaining within their  
respective limit the rights and liberties appertain  
ing to them.&quot;  
Mr, Madison thus notices the subject of  
alarming and dangerous power then claimed  
one half of the States, for the Federal Judioiary,  
and triumphantly refutes the claim. lie say :  
&quot;But it is objooted, that the Judicial authority  
is to be regarded as the sole expositor of the Con­  
stitution, in the last resort.&quot;  
&quot;On this objection it might be observed,  
that there may be instances of usurped power,  
which li.o forms of the Constitution would never  
draw within tho control of the judicial depart­  
ment: that if tbe decision if tho Judiciary  
raised above tbe authority of the sovereign parties  
to the Constitution, the decisions of the other  
not carried by tbe forms of the Consti  
tution before tbe Judiciary, must be equally  
thoritive and final with tbe decision of that  
partuieut.&quot;  
&quot;But the proper answer to tbe objeotion, is,  
the resolution of the General Assembly relate  
those areat and extraordinary cases, in which  
forms of the Constitution may prove ineffectual  
against infractions dangeruus to the essential  
rights o( the parlies to it. The resolution suppos­  
es that dangerous powers, not delegated, may  
only be usurped and exeouted by tbo other depart  
moots, but that tho Judicial department also  
exercise or sanction dangerous powers, beyond  
grant of the Constitution; and consequently,  
the ultimate right of the parties to the Constitution  
to judge whether the Compact has been dangerously  
violated, must extend to violations by one delegated  
authority as veil ashy another; by tbe Judioiary,  
aa well a by the Kxecutivo or the Legislative.&quot;  
&quot;However true, therefore, it may bo that  
Judicial department is, in all question submitted  
to it by the forms of tbe Constitution, to dsoido  
tbe Ust resort, this must necessarily be deemed  
last la relation to the authorities of the other  
of the Government; not in relation  
the right of the parties to the constitutional  
  
pact, from which the Judicial ae well a the other  
department bold their delegated trusts. On any  
other hypothesis, the delegation of Judicial pow­  
er would annul the authority defecating it ; and  
the concurrence of this department with tbe oth­  
er in usurped powers, might subvert forever, and  
beyond the possible reach of any rightful remedy,  
the very constitution which all wore instructed to  
preserve.&quot; &quot;It will be remembered,  
that a frequent recurrence to fundamental princi­  
ples is solemnly enjoined by most of the Stale  
Constitutions, as a necessary safe-guard against  
the danger of degoneracy to which Republics aro  
liable. The authority of Constitutions over Gov  
ernments, and of the sovereignty of the people over  
Constitutions, are truths which are at all limes  
necessary to be kept in mind.

no objection to this.&quot;  
And Mr. Nicholas said the same thing:  
&quot;Mr. Nicholas contended that the language  
of the proposed ratification would secure every  
thing which gentlemen desired, as it declared  
that all pewers vested in the Constitution  
were derived from the people, and might be  
resumed by them whensoever they should be  
perverted to their injury or oppression; and  
that every power not granted thereby remained  
at their will. No danger whatever could arise;  
for I says he) these expressions will become a  
part of the contract. The Constitution cannot  
be binding on Virginia but with these condi­  
tions. If thirteen individuals are about to  
make a contract, and one agrees to it, but at  
the same time declares that he understands its  
meaning, signification, and intent to bo (what

&quot;It appears to your committee to be a plain  
principle, founded in common sense, illustrated  
y common practice, and essential to the na­  
ture of compacts, that, where resort can b  
had to tribunals superior to the authority of  
the parties, the parties themselves must be the  
rightful judges, in the last resort whether the  
bargain made has been pursued or violated.  
The Constitution of the United States wa  
formed by the sanction of the States, given by  
each in its sovereign capacity. It adds to the  
stability and dignity, as well as to the author­  
ity, of the Constitution, that it rests on this  
legitimate and solid foundation. The States,  
then, being the parties to the Constitutional  
compact, in their sovereign capacity, it fol­  
lows, of necessity, that there can be no tribu­  
nal above their authority, to decide in the  
last resort, whether the compact made by them  
be violated, and consequently that, as the par­  
ties to it, they must themselves decide, in the  
last resort, such questions as may be of suff­

“Tt appears to your committee to be a plain principle,

can be had to no tribunal superior to the authority of the  
parties, the parties themselves must be the rightful judges,  
in the last resort, whether the bargain made has been pur-

Was formed by the sanction of the States, given by each in

as Well as to the authority, of the Constitution, that it rests  
on this legitimate and solid foundatien. The States, then,

solidated government, nor a confederated govern­  
ment, but a mixturo of both.&quot; This extract from  
the Review, its Editor, Dr. Hodge does not mark  
as a quotation from Mr. Madison; and I doubt, for  
two reasons, bis tanity if he ever said 80. First,  
because it is not true the Federal Constitution  
nut being a government of any kind, but the more  
power of attorney constituting a government.  
Hecond. because Mr. Madison, in his &quot;Report&quot; on  
the Virginia resolutions of 1708, shows thut he  
well understood the difference between Constitu­  
tions and Governments, when he said that &quot;l&#x27;be  
authority of Constitutions over government, and of  
the sovereignly of the people over Constitutions,  
are truths which are at all timos necessary to be  
kept in mind.&quot; If this theory le true, and it  
unquestionably is true, then the people of a State  
are a sovereign over both the Federal Constitution,  
eo far as it relates to them, as they ure over their  
State Constitution.  
Dr. Hodge thus continues to quote Mr. Madison,  
marking the extracts as quotations:  
&quot;It was not formed, he continues, by the gov­  
ernment of the component States, m the Federal  
Government, for which it was substituted.&quot; What  
did Mr. Madison mean by tbo pronoun &quot;It?&quot; It

I &quot; PfaC&#x27;.ice, and essential to the  
  
i | nature of compacts, that, where resort can b  
. I had to no tribunal, superior to the authority c  
i the parties, the parties thcmselvfcs must b  
; the rightful judges in the last resort, whethe  
the bargain made has been pursued or violated  
; The Constitution or the United States wa  
formed by the sanction of the States, given bi  
each in its sovereign capacity. It adds to tli  
stability and dignity, as well as to the authori  
ty of the Constitution, that it rests on this le  
gitimate and solid foundation. The States  
then, being the parties to the constitutiona  
compact, and in jhoir sovereign capacity, i  
follows of necessity that there can be no tri  
bunal above their authority, to dccido, in thi  
last resort, whether tho compact made b]  
them, be violated; and, consequently, that, a  
the parties to it, they must themselves decide  
in the last resort, such questions as may be o  
sufficient magnitudo to require their interposi  
tion.  
It does not follow, however, that because thi  
States, as sovereign parties to their constitu  
tional computet, must ultimately decide whe  
thcr it has been violated, that such a decisior  
ought to be interposed, cither in a hasty uiannei  
or on doubtful and inferior occasions. Ever  
in the case of ordinary conventions bctweci  
different nations, where, by the strict rule o  
interpretation, a breach of a part may be deem  
ci a breach of the.whole, it is always laiddowi  
that the breach must be ^oth wilful and mate  
rivl to justify an application of the rule. But  
in the case of an intimate and constitutiona  
Union, like that of the United States, it isevi  
dent that the interposition of the parties, ir  
their sovereign capacity, can bo called for b\
occasions only deeply and essentially affecting  
the vital principles of their political system.  
The resolution has accordingly guardei  
aghinst any misapprehension of its object, bj  
expressly requiring for such an &quot;interposition,  
&quot;the case of a deliberate, palpable and dan  
gerous breach of the Constitution by the exercise  
of potcere not granted by it It must be a  
case, moreover, not obscure or doubtful in its  
construction, but plain and palpable. Lastly,  
it must be a case, not resulting from a partial  
consideration, or hasty determination; but a  
case stamped with a linal consideration and deliberate  
adherence. It is not necessary, be  
  
uau&gt;v: me icciuiuuuu u(jc.i n?n require mui luc  
question should be discussed, how far the exercise  
ol any particular power, ungranted by the  
Constitution, would justify the interposition oi  
the parties to it. As cases might easily be stated  
which never would contain ought to fall within  
that description; cases, on the other hand,  
might, with equal ea.-e, be stated, so flagrant  
and so fatal, as to unite every opinion in placing  
them within that description.  
Now, Mr. Chairman, if Mr. Madison in the  
argument he made to sustain the position assumed  
in the third resolution, has not vindicated  
the position that the States are now sovereign  
and independent, I should like to know  
how it may be maintained. I think that the  
argument is irrefragable. I regard the position  
which Mr. Madison and Mr. Jefferson have  
taken, that the Slates have the right to judge  
of the infractions of the compact and of th

tribunal superior to the authority of the  
parties, the parties themselves must be  
the judges, in the last resort, whether  
the bargain made has been pursued or  
violated. The Constitution of the United  
States was formed by the sanction of  
the States, given by each in its sover-  
eign capacity. It adds to its stability  
and dignity, as well as to the authority  
of the Constitution, that it rests on thjs

States, then, being the parties to the

overnment, and thus a national Government  
for the first time established, the framers of the Constitution  
were chiefly desirous of putting an end to those abuses of  
power by the several States which had proved mischievous,  
and amongst which that of issuing paper money was one of  
the greatest. But it by no means follows that this power,  
prohibited to the States, was reserved to the Congress ; for it  
is a settled principle of American constitutional law that  
Congress can exercise no powers other than those enumerated  
in the Constitution.

concerning the constitutionality of a particular power, the first ques-

question is decided. If it be not expressed, the next inquiry must be  
whether it is properly an incident to an expressed power and necessary  
to its execution. If it be, then it may be exercised by Congress. If  
not, Congress cannot exercise it.

44 It cannot be a true inference, that because th

the grant is made, the favor becomes a&quot; right, and

&quot;The alien act declares &#x27;that it shall be lawful for the  
President to order all such aliens as he shall judge  
dangero us to the peace and salety of the United States,  
or shall have reasonable grounds to suspect are con­  
serned in any treasonatle or secret machinations against

&quot;Could a power be welt give in terms less definite,

to conv e; his order the only jidgment which is to  
be executed.&quot;  
(I beseech honorable members to observe how strictly  
and minutely applicable the words of the sage of Mont  
pelier are to the provisions of the act we are now con-

&quot;It is affirmed, that this union of poger subverts the

&quot;It has become an action in the science of Govern­

xecutive departments, is necessary for the preservation  
of public liberty. No where has this action been better  
inders ood in theory, or more carefully pursued in  
practice than in the United States.  
&quot;It is affirmed, that such a union of powers subverts  
he organixation and positive provisions of the federal  
onsthution.  
&quot;According to the particular organization of the  
onstitution, its legislative powers are vested in the Con­

 any one of these departments, as has been shown to

nied it. No Convention, calling itself  
Democratic, ever occupied any other

creed of the Democracy as the New  
Testament has been the creed of Chris-

of this resolution was, and is to re-  
nounce Democracy ; for, as we have  
said, the party was formed for the very  
purpose of establishing these senti-  
ments in opposition to the centralizing  
despotism of Federalism.  
  
In Mr. Madison’s report to the Vir-  
ginia House of Delegates, at the ses-  
sion of 1800, he said:  
  
“The States, then, being the parties to  
the Constitutional compact, and in their sov-  
ereign capacity, it follows of necessity that  
there can be no tribunal above their authori-  
ty, to decide, in the last resort, whether the  
compact made by them be violated ; and con-  
sequently, that as the parties to it, they must  
themselves decide, in the last resort, such  
questions as may be of sufficient magnitude  
  
to require their interposition.”

tution in the Government of the United States, or  
in any department or officer thereof.&quot;  
But, sir, this clause confers no new or  
additional power upon Congress. It simp­  
ly authorizes Congress to &quot;make all laws  
which shall be necessary and proper for  
carrying into execution&quot; the powers grant-  
ed in the Constitution.  
Mr. Madison in the Virginia Convention,  
speaking of this clause, said:  
&quot;With respect to the supposed operation of what  
is den minated the sweeping clause, the gentleman  
was mistaken; for it only extened to all enumerat­  
ed powers. Should Congress attempt to extend it to  
any power not enumerated it would not be warranted  
by the clause.&quot;  
Justice Story, in his Commentaries,  
speaking on the same subject, says:  
&quot;The plain import of this clause is, that Congress  
shall have all incidental and instrumental powers  
necessary and proper to carry into execution al ex­  
press powers. It neither enlarges any power specifi­  
cally granted, nor is it a grant of any net power  
to Congress.&quot;

&quot;Whenever, therefore, a question arises concern­

first question is, whether the power be ewpressed in  
the Constitution. If it be, the question is decided.  
If it be not expressed, the next inquiry must be  
whether it is properly an incident to an express pow­

vention, for the selfish object of obtain  
ing a preponderating influence, by com-  
  
compact, from which the powers of the

would seem inconceivable that it can  
incur any just disapprobation from those  
who, laying aside all momentary ims  
pressions, and recoilecting the genuine  
source and object of the Federal Consti­

interpret the meaning of the General

dangerous powers, palpably withheld by  
the Constitution, could not justify the  
parties to it, in interposing even so far  
as to arrest the progress of the evil, and  
thereby to preserve the Constitution it­

o  
And the Report of 1799, upon these  
Resolutions and the action of other  
States in regard to them, written by Mr  
MA dison, sald, of the third Resolution:  
&quot;The other position involved in this  
branch of the resolution, namely, &quot;that  
the States are parties to the Constitution  
or compact,&quot; is, in the judgment of the  
committee, equally free from objection,  
It is indeed true, that the term &quot;States,&quot;  
is sometimes used in a vague sense, and  
sometimes in different senses, according  
to the subject to which it is applied.  
  
Thus, it sometimes means the separate  
  
by the  
  
eee o iin  o  
  
times the paltiuulal soverhirients, etht  
lished by those societies; sometimes  
those societies as organized into  
those particular governments; and,  
lastly, it means the people com­  
posing those political societies in  
their highest sovereign capacity.  
Although it might be wished that the  
perfection of language admitted less  
diversity in the signification of the same  
words, yet little inconveniency is pro­  
duced by it, where the true sense can be  
collected with certainty from the differ-  
  
ent applications. In the present instance  
  
whatever different construction  
  
States,&quot; in the resolution, may  
  
have been entertained, all will at least  
concur in that last mentioned; because,  
in that sense, the Constitution was sub  
mitted to the States; in that sense  
the &quot;States ratified it; and, in  
that sense of the term &quot;States,&quot;  
they are consequently parties to the

The next passage, which I shall read from page 57 of  
ie volume, has an extraordinary application to the  
subject matter now before us. It is as follows?  
The Constitution supposes that the president  
of its Houses, may, not discharge their trast­  
tor other causes; hence they are all isade responsible to their  
constituents at the returning periods of election; and the President, whe  
is simply intrusted with very great pewers, is, af a further guard, subjeet  
to an intermediate liapeachment. Second: Sbould it happes, as the  
Constitution supposes it may happen, that either of these branches of  
the Government may not have duly discharged its trust, it is patural and  
proper that, according to the cause and degree of their tanlts, they  
thould be brought into contempt or disrepute, and incur the astred  
of the people. Third, whether it has in any case happened that the pro  
ceedings of either or all of those branches evluce such a violation of duty  
as to justify a contempt, a hatred or Sirepute among the people can caly  
be deiermined by a free examination Mtreof, and A free comhmuslcation  
among the people thereon. Fourth, whenever it may bave sctnally

telligent and faithfal citizens to discuss and promulgate them freely, as

the essential difference between the liritish govern  
and American constitution will place this sub  
ect in the clearest light. In the British Government  
he danger of encroachments upon the rights of the  
scople is understood to be confined to the executive  
nagistrate. The representatives of the people in the  
crin ature are not only exempt memscfees from dis  
but are considered as sufficient guardians of the  
whta of their constitucnts against the dan  
from the evecutive. Ience i it a princk  
that the rarlament is uniimited in its pow  
or, in their own language, is omnipotent.  
tence, too, all the ramparts for proiecting  
he rights of the people, such as their Magha Charta,  
heir Bill of Rights, Ac., are not reared against the  
oyal prerogative.. Thcy are merely legisintive prn  
against executive usurpations. Under such  
Government as this an exemption of the press from  
previous restraint by licensers appointed by the  
ing is all the freedom that can be secured to f. In  
he United States the case is altogether different.  
the people, not the Government, possess the  
absoluite sovereignty. The legislature, no less  
han the Executive, is under limitations of  
power. Encroachments are regarded as possiblo  
rom the one as well as from the other. Hence, in the  
inited States the great essential rights of the people  
g reesredaratinst hepimamiee as wih as aumnd iat  
ton. They are seented not th taws pari  
to prerogative, but by constitutions bara-  
nount to laws.  This security of the freedom of the  
ress requires that it should be exempt not only from  
revious restraint by the Executive, as in Great  
tritain, but from legislative restraint also; and this  
xemption, to be effectual, must be an exemption not

&quot;The essential difference between the  
British Government an.l tho American Con-  
stitution will place this subject in the clearest  
light.  
  
In the British Government the danger of  
encroachments on the rights of the people, is  
understood to be confined to the Executive  
Magistrate. The Representatives of the  
people in the Legislature are not only exempt  
themselves from distrust, but are considered  
as sufficient guardians of the rights of their  
constituents against the danger from the Exe-  
cutive. Hence it is a principle that the Parlia-  
ment is unlimited in its power, or. in their  
own language, is omnipotent. Hence, too,  
all the ramparts for protecting fho rights of  
the people — such as their Magana Charter,  
their Bill of Rights, ic.-are not reared against  
the Parliament, but against the royal prero  
gative. They are merely legislative precau  
tioris against Executive usurp itious. Under  
such a Government as this an exemption of  
the press from previous restraint, by licensers  
appointed by the king, is all the freedom  
that can be secured to it.  
  
In th» I&#x27;nited States tbe case is altogether  
different. The people, not the Government,  
  
f&gt;oss«*ss the absolute sovereignty. The Legis-  
ature. no less than the Executive, is under  
limitations of power. Encroachments are  
regarded as possible from the one as well as  
from the other. Hence, in the United States,  
the great and essential rights of the people  
are secured against legislative as well as  
against executive ambition. They are secur-  
ed, not by laws paramount to prerogative, but  
by constitutions paramount to laws. This  
security of the freedom of the press requires  
that it should be exempt not only from pre-  
vious restraint by the Executive, as in Great  
Britain, but from legislative restraint also:  
and this exemption not only from the pre-  
vious inspection of licences, but the Fubse-  
quent penalty of law  
  
One other passage on p«ge 517, which has  
an extraordinary application to the subject  
now before you  
  
The Constitution supposes that the Presi-  
dent, the Congress, and each of its House  
may not discharge their trusts, either from  
defect of judgement or other causes. Hem e  
they are ml made responsible to their consti-  
tuents at the returning periods of election ;  
and the President, who is singly intructed  
with very great powers is as a further guard,  
subjected to an intermediate impeachment  
Should it happen, as the Constitution sup-  
poses it may happen, that either of these  
branches of th&gt; Government may not have  
duly discharged its trust, it *is natural and  
proper that according to the case and degtVe  
of the faults, they should be brought into con-  
tempt or disrepute, and incur the hatred of  
the people.  
  
\\ hetber it has, in any cnuse, happened  
thnt the proceedings of either or all of these  
branches evince such a violation of duty as  
to justify a contempt, a disrepute, or hatred  
among the people, can only be determined by  
a free examination thereof, and a free com-  
munication among the people thereon.  
  
Whenever it may have actually happened  
that proceedings of this sort are chargeable  
on all or either of the branches of the Govern-  
ment, it is the duty, as well as right, of intell-  
igent faithful citizens lo discuss and promulgc  
them freely, as well to control them by the  
censorship of the public opinion as to promote  
a remedy according to the rules of the Con-  
stitution. And it cannot be avoided that  
those who are to apply the remedy must feel  
in some degree, a contempt or hatred against  
the transgressing party.&quot;  
  
These observation of Mr. Madison were  
made in respect to the freedom of the press.  
There were two views entertained at the time  
when the sedition law was passed concerning  
the power of Congress over this subject. Tbe  
one view was that when the Constitution  
spoke of freedom of the press, it referred to  
the common-law definition of the freedom  
That was tbe view which Mr. Madison was  
controverting in one of tbe passages which I  
have read to vou. The other view was that  
the common-law definition could not be deem-  
ed applicable, and that the freedom provided  
for iu the Constitution, us

the right to interpose and arrest the evil

What those principles were we have

Mr. Mapison, the father of the Federal

Mr. Manisox evidently did not hold that  
the Federal tribunals had exclusive and ar-  
bitrary power to construe the compacts of  
the Constitution.

has usurped the power which the Republi-

 the Federal Constitution. 4 Elliot’s Deb. 528. The  
resolutions upon both acts were transmitted to the legisla-  
tures of different States, and their communications in answer  
to them were referred to a committee of the general assem-  
bly of Virginia, of which Mr. Madison was a member, and  
upon them his celebrated report was made. With reference  
to the alien act, after observing that it was incumbent in this,  
as in every other exercise of power by the Federal govern-  
ment, to prove from the Constitution that it granted the par-  
ticular power exercised; and also that much confusion and  
fallacy had been thrown into the question to be considered by  
blending the two cases of aliens, members of a hostile nation,  
and aliens, members of friendly nations, he said: “ With  
respect to alien enemies, no doubt has been intimated as to  
the Federal authority over them; the Constitution having  
expressly delegated to Congress the power to declare war  
against any nation, and, of course, to treat it and all its mem-  
bers as enemies. With respect to aliens who are not enemies,  
but members of nations in peace and amity with the United  
States, the power assumed by the act of Congress is denied to  
be constitutional ; and it is accordingly against this act that  
the protest of the general assembly is expressly and exclu-  
sively directed.” 4 Elliot’s Deb. 554.  
  
“ Were it admitted, as is contended, that the ‘act concern-  
ing aliens’ has for its object, not a penal, but a preventive  
justice, it would still remain to be proved that it comes within  
the constitutional power of the Federal legislature; and, if  
within its power, that the legislature has exercised it in a con-  
stitutional manner. . . . It can never be admitted that  
the removal of aliens, authorized by the act, is to be con-  
sidered, not as punishment for an offence, but as a measure of

precaution and prevention. If the banishment of an alien  
from a country into which he has been invited as the asylum  
most auspicious to his happiness—a country where he may  
have formed the most tender connections ; where he may have  
invested his entire property, and acquired property of the real  
and permanent as well as the movable and temporary kind ;  
where he enjoys, under the laws, a greater share of the  
blessings of personal security and personal liberty, than he  
can elsewhere hope for; . . . if a banishment of this  
sort be not a punishment, and among the severest of punish-  
ments, it would be difficult to imagine a doom to which the  
name can be applied. And, if it be a punishment, it will  
remain to be inquired whether it can be constitutionally in-  
flicted, on mere suspicion, by the single will of the executive  
magistrate, on persons convicted of no personal offence  
against the laws of the land, nor involved in any offence  
against the law of nations, charged on the foreign state of  
which they are members.” 4 Elliot’s Deb. 554,555. . .  
It does not follow, because aliens are not parties to the Con-  
stitution, as citizens are parties to it, that, whilst they ac-  
tually conform to it, they have no right to its protection.  
Aliens are not more parties to the laws than they are parties  
to the Constitution; yet it will not be disputed that, as they  
owe, on one hand, a temporary obedience, they are entitled,  
in return, to their protection and advantage.  
  
If aliens had no rights under the Constitution, they might  
not only be banished, but even capitally punished without a  
jury or the other incidents to a fair trial. But, so far has a  
contrary principle been carried, in every part of the United  
States, that, except on charges of treason, an alien has,  
besides all the common privileges, the special one of being  
tried by a jury of which one-half may be also aliens.  
  
“Tt is said, further, that, by the law and practice of nations,  
aliens may be removed, at discretion, for offences against the  
law of nations; that Congress is authorized to define and  
punish such offences; and that to be dangerous to the peace  
of society is, in aliens, one of those offences.

federation in 1783, only four years earlier  
although the phraseology was slightly  
changed  
Article VIII of the Articles of Confedera­

All charges of war, and all other expenses that  
all be incurred for the common defence or general  
welfare, and allowed by the United States in Con

treacury, which shall be supplied by the several

of the States&#x27; Rights party this question was  
open to no doubt. Madison maintained in his  
report on the Virginia Resolutions that the par.  
ties to the Constitutional compact were the  
States in their sovereign capacity, from which  
postulate it followed of necessity that there  
could be no tribunal above their authority, to  
decide in the last resort whether the compact  
made by them was violated; and consequently  
that, as the parties to it, they must themselves  
decide in the last resort such questions as  
should be of sufficient magnitude to  
require their interposition. In expressin

these views, Madison wished that the  
perfection of language admitted less diversity  
in the signification of the word &quot;State,&quot; but  
  
took comfort in the thought that little incon­  
venience was produced by that diversity where  
the true sense could be collected with certainty  
from the application. In this instance it was  
clear to him that the parties to the compact  
meant by the word &quot;State,&quot; when they used it  
the people composing that political soclety. Mr.  
Scott, for his part, expresses a regret that the  
plural term&quot; peoples&quot; was not in general or even  
special use by English-speaking writers of  
that period. For, if the term &quot;&quot;States&quot; meant  
the peoples of the several States, much of the  
confusion resulting from the attempt to ascer.­  
tain who the parties to the compact were would  
have been obviated by the employment of our  
modern term &quot;peoples.&quot; The contention, fo
