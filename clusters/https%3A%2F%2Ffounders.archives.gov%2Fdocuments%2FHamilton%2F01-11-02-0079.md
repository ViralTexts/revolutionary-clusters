To the Speaker of the House of Representatives]  
In Obedience to the orders of the House of Representatives of the first &amp; second days of November last, the first directing the Secretary of the Treasury to report to the House such information as he may have obtained, respecting any difficulties which may have occurred in the execution of the Act “repealing after the last day of June next, the duties heretofore laid upon distilled spirits imported from abroad and laying others in their stead, and also upon spirits distilled within the United States, and for appropriating the same” together with his opinion thereupon; the second directing him to report to the House whether any, and what alterations in favor of the spirits which shall be distilled from articles of the growth or produce of the United States, or from foreign Articles, within the same can, in his opinion, be made in the Act for laying duties upon spirits distilled within the United States, consistently with its main design, and with the maintenance of the public faith. The said Secretary respectfully submits the following Report  
From the several petitions and memorials which have been referred to the Secretary, as well as from various representations which have been made to him, it appears that objections have arisen in different quarters against the above mentioned act; which have in some instances embarrassed its execution, and inspired a desire of its being repealed, in others have induced a wish that alterations may be made in some of its provisions.  
These objections have reference to a supposed tendency of the act; 1st. to contravene the principles of liberty; 2ndy to injure morals; 3dly to oppress by heavy and excessive penalties; 4thly to injure industry and interfere with the business of distilling.  
As to the supposed tendency of the Act to contravene the principles of liberty, the discussions of the subject which have had place in and out of the Legislature supercede the necessity of more than a few brief general observations  
It is presumed that a revision of the point cannot in this respect weaken the convictions which originally dictated the law.  
There can surely be nothing in the nature of an internal duty on a consumable commodity more incompatible with liberty, than in that of an external duty on a like commodity. A doctrine which asserts, that all duties of the former kind (usually denominated excises) are inconsistent with the genius of a free government, is too violent and too little reconcileable with the necessities of society to be true. It would tend to deprive the government of what is in most Countries a principal source of Revenue, and by narrowing the distribution of taxes, would serve to oppress particular kinds of industry. It would throw in the first instance an undue proportion of the public burthen on the merchant and on the landholder.  
This is one of those cases in which names have an improper influence, and in which certain preposessions exclude a due attention to facts.  
Accordingly the law under consideration is complained of though free from the features, which have served in other cases to render laws on the same subject exceptionable. And though the differences have been pointed out, they have not only been overlooked, but the very things, which have been studiously avoided in the formation of the law, are charged upon it, and that too from quarters where its operation would from circumstances have worn the least appearance of them.  
It has been heretofore noticed, that the chief circumstances, which in certain excise-laws have given occasion to the charge of their being unfriendly to liberty, are not to be found in the act, which is the subject of this report; namely 1st. a summary and discretionary jurisdiction in the excise officers contrary to the course of the common law, and in abrigement of the right of trial by jury; and 2ndly. a general power in the same officers to search and inspect indiscriminately all the houses and buildings of the persons engaged in the business to which the tax relates.  
As to the first particular, there is nothing in the act even to give colour to a charge of the kind against it, and accordingly it has not been brought. But as to the second, a very different power has been mistaken for it, and the Act is complained of as conferring that very power of indiscriminate search and inspection.  
The fact nevertheless is otherwise. An officer, under the Act in question, can inspect or search no house or building, or even apartment of any house or building, which has not been previously entered and marked by the possessor as a place used for distilling or keeping spirits.  
And even the power so qualified is only applicable to distilleries from foreign materials, and in cities towns and villages from domestic materials; that is only in cases in which the law contemplates that the business is carried on upon such a scale as effectually to seperate the distillery from the dwelling of the distiller. The distilleries scattered over the country, which form much the greatest part of the whole, are in no degree subject to discretionary inspection and search.  
The true principle of the objection, which may be raised to a general discretionary power of inspection and search is, that the domicil or dwelling of a citizen ought to be free from vexations inquisition and intrusion.  
This principle cannot apply to a case in which it is put in his own power to seperate the place of his business from the place of his habitation, and, by designating the former by visible public marks, to avoid all intermeddling with the latter.  
A distillery seldom forms a part of the dwelling of its proprietor, and even where it does, it depends on him to direct and limit the power of visiting and search, by marking out the particular apartments, which are so employed.  
But the requisition upon the distiller to set marks on the building or apartments which he makes use of in his business, is one of the topics of complaint against the law. Such marks are represented as a dishonorable badge. And thus a regulation, designed as much to conform with the feelings of the Citizen, as for the security of the revenue, is converted into matter of objection.  
  
It is not easy to conceive what maxim of liberty is violated, by requiring persons, who carry on particular trades, which are made contributory to the revenue, to designate by public marks the places in which they are carried on. There can certainly be nothing more harmless, or less inconvenient, than such a regulation. The thing itself is frequently done by persons of various callings for the information of Customers; and why it should become a hardship or grievance, if required for a public purpose, can with difficulty be imagined.  
The supposed tendency of the act to injure morals seems to have relation to the oaths, which are in a variety of cases required, and which are liable to the objection, that they give occasion to perjuries.  
The necessity of requiring Oaths is whenever it occurs matter of regret. It is certainly desireable to avoid them as often and as far as possible. But it is more easy to desire than to find a substitute. The requiring of them is not peculiar to the Act in question. They are a common appendage of Revenue laws, and are among the usual guards of those laws, as they are of public and private rights in courts of justice. They constantly occur in jury trials, to which the Citizens of the United States are so much and so justly attached. The same objection in different degrees lies against them in both cases. Yet it is not perceivable how they can be dispensed with in either.  
It is remarkable, that both the kinds of security to the revenue, which are to be found in the act, the oaths of parties, and the inspection of Officers, are objected to. If they are both to be abandoned, it is not easy to imagine what security there can be for any species of revenue, which is to be collected from articles of consumption.  
If precautions of this nature are inconsistent with liberty, and immoral, as there are very few indirect taxes, which can be collected without them, the consequence must be, that the entire or almost entire weight of the public burthens must, in the first instance, fall upon fixed and visible property, houses and lands, a consequence which would be found in experiment productive of great injustice and inequality and ruinous to agriculture.  
It has been suggested by some distillers, that both the topics of complaint, which have been mentioned, might be obviated by a fixed rate of duty, adjusted according to a ratio compounded of the capacity of each still and the number and capacities of the cisterns employed with it; but this and every similar method are objected to by other distillers as tending to great inequality, arising from unequal supplies of the material at different times and at different places, from the different methods of distillation practiced by different distillers, and from the different degrees of activity in the business which arise from capitals more or less adequate.  
The result of an examination of this point appears to be, that every such mode in cases in which the business is carried on upon an extensive scale, would necessarily be attended with considerable inequalities; and upon the whole would be less satisfactory, than the plan which has been adopted.  
It is proved by the fullest information, that, in regard to distilleries, which are rated in the law, according to the capacity of each still, the alternative of paying according to the quantity actually distilled is viewed in many parts of the United States as essential to the equitable operation of the duty. And it is evident, that such an alternative could not be allowed, but upon the condition of the party, rendering upon oath an account of the quantity of Spirits distilled by him, without entirely defeating the duty.  
As to the charge, that the penalties of the act are severe and oppressive, it is made in such general terms, and so absolutely without the specification of a single particular, that it is difficult to imagine where it points.  
The Secretary however has carefully reviewed the provisions of the Act in this respect, and he is not able to discover any foundation for the charge.  
The penalties it inflicts are in their nature the same with those which are common in revenue laws, and in their degree comparatively moderate.  
Pecuniary fines from fifty to five hundred dollars, and forfeiture of the article in respect to which there has been a failure to comply with the law, are the severest penalties inflicted upon delinquent parties, except in a very few cases: In two, a forfeiture of the value of the article is added to that of the article itself, and in some others, a forfeiture of the ship or vessel, and of the waggon or other instrument of conveyance, assistant in a breach of the law is likewise involved.  
Penalties like these for wilful and fraudulent breaches of an important law, cannot truly be deemed either unusual or excessive. They are less than those which secure the laws of impost, and as moderate as can promise security to any object of revenue, which is capable of being evaded.  
There appears to be but one provision in the law which admits of a question, whether the penalty prescribed may not partake of severity. It is that which inflicts the pains of paying on any person who shall be convicted of “wilfully taking a false oath or affirmation in any of the cases in which oaths or affirmations are required by the act.”  
Precedents in relation to this particular vary. In many of them the penalties are less severe, than for perjury in courts of justice; in others they are the same. The latter are generally of the latest date and seem to have been the result of experience.  
The United States have in other cases pursued the same principle as in the law in question. And the practice is certainly founded on strong reasons.  
1st. The additional security which it gives to the revenue cannot be doubted. Many who would risk pecuniary forfeitures and penalties would not encounter the more disgraceful punishment annexed to perjury.  
2. There seems to be no solid distinction between one false oath in violation of law and right and another false oath in violation of law and right. A distinction in the punishments of different species of false swearing is calculated to beget false opinions concerning the sanctity of an oath; and by countenancing an impression that a violation of it is less heinous in the cases in which it is less punished, it tends to impair in the mind that scrupulous veneration for the obligation of an oath which ought always to prevail, and not only to facilitate a breach of it in the cases which the laws have marked with less odium, but to prepare the mind for committing the crime in other cases.  
So far is the law under consideration from being chargeable with particular severity, that there are to be found in it marks of more than common attention to prevent its operating severely or oppressively.  
The 43rd. Section of the act contains a special provision (and one which it is believed is not to be found in any law enacted in this country prior to the present constitution of the United States) by which forfeitures and penalties incurred without an intention of fraud or wilful negligence may be mitigated or remitted.  
This mild and equitable provision is an effectual guard against suffering or inconvenience in consequence of undesigned transgressions of the law.  
The 38th. section contains a provision in favor of persons, who though innocent may accidentally suffer by seizures of their property (as in the execution of the revenue laws sometimes unavoidably happens) which is perhaps entirely peculiar to the law under consideration. Where there has even been a probable cause of seizure, sufficient to acquit an officer, the Jury are to assess whatever damages may have accrued from any injury to the article seized, with an allowance for the detention of it at the rate of six per centum per annum of the value, which damages are to be paid out of the public Treasury.  
There are other provisions of the act which mark the scrupulous attention of the government to protect the parties concerned from inconvenience and injury, and which conspire to vindicate the law from imputations of severity or oppression.  
The supposed tendency of the Act to injure industry, and interfere with the business of distilling, is endeavored to be supported by some general and some special reasons; both having relation to the effect of the duty upon the manufacture.  
Those of the first kind affirm generally, that duties on home manufactures are impolitic, because they tend to discourage them; that they are particularly so, when they are laid on articles manufactured from the produce of the country, because they have then the additional effect of injuring agriculture; that it is the general policy of nations to protect and promote their own manufactures; especially those which are wrought out of domestic materials; that the law in question interferes with this policy.  
Observations of this kind admit of an easy answer. Duties on manufactures tend to discourage them or not, according to the circumstances under which they are laid, and are impolitic or not, according to the same circumstances. When a manufacture is in its infancy, it is impolitic to tax it; because the tax would be both unproductive, and would add to the difficulties, which naturally impede the first attempts to establish a new manufacture, so as to endanger its success.  
But when a manufacture (as in the case of distilled Spirits in the United States) is arrived at maturity, it is as fit an article of taxation as any other. No good reason can be assigned, why the consumer of a domestic commodity should not contribute something to the public revenue, when the consumer of a foreign commodity contributes to it largely. And as a general rule it is not to be disputed, that duties on articles of consumption are paid by the consumers.  
To the manufacture itself the duty is no injury, if an equal duty be laid on the rival foreign Article. And when a greater duty is laid upon the latter than upon the former, as in the present instance, the difference is a bounty on the domestic article, and operates as an encouragement of the manufacture. The manufacturer can afford to sell his fabric the cheaper, in proportion to that difference, and is so far enabled to undersell and supplant the dealer in the foreign article.  
The principle of the objection would tend to confine all taxes to imported articles, and would deprive the government of resources which are indispensible to a due provision for the public safety and welfare; contrary to the plain intention of the constitution, which gives express power to employ those resources when necessary; a power which is found in all governments, and is essential to their efficiency, and even to their existence.  
Duties on articles of internal production and manufacture form in every country the principal sources of Revenue. Those on imported articles can only be carried to a certain extent, without defeating their object; by operating either as prohibitions; or as bounties upon smuggling. They are moreover in some degree temporary; for as the growth of manufactures diminishes the quantum of duty on imports, the public revenue, ceasing to arise from that source, must be derived from articles which the national industry has substituted for those previously imported. If the government cannot then resort to internal means for the additional supplies, which the exigencies of every nation call for, it will be unable to perform its duty or even to preserve its existence. The community must be unprotected, and the social compact be dissolved.  
For the same reasons, that a duty ought not to be laid on an article manufactured out of the produce of the country (which is the point most insisted upon) it ought not to be laid upon the produce itself, nor consequently upon the land, which is the instrument of that produce; because taxes are laid upon land as the fund out of which the income of the proprietor is drawn, or, in other words, on account of its produce. There ought, therefore, on the principle of the objection, to be neither taxes on land nor on the produce of land, nor on articles manufactured from that produce. And if a nation should be in a condition to supply itself, with its own manufactures, there could then be very little or no revenue, of course there must be a want of the essential means of national justice and national security.  
Positions like these, however well meant by those who urge them, refute themselves, because they tend to the dissolution of government, by rendering it incapable of providing for the objects for which it is instituted.  
However true the allegation that it is and ought to be the prevailing policy of nations to cherish their own manufactures, it is equally true that nations in general lay duties for the purpose of revenue on their own manufactures; and it is obvious to a demonstration that it may be done without injury to them. The most successfull nations in manufactures have drawn the largest revenues from the most useful of them. It merits particular attention, that ardent Spirits are an article, which has been generally deemed and made use of, as one of the fittest objects of revenue, and to an extent in other countries, which bears no comparison with what had been done in the United States.  
The special reasons alluded to are of different kinds.  
I. It is said, that the act in question by laying a smaller additional duty on foreign spirits, than the duty on home made spirits, has a tendency to discourage the manufacture of the latter.  
This objection merits consideration, and as far as it may appear to have foundation ought to be obviated.  
The point however seems not to have been viewed in all respects in a correct light.  
  
Before the present constitution of the United States began to operate, the regulations of the different states, respecting distilled spirits were very dissimular. In some of them duties were laid on foreign spirits only, in others, on domestic as well as foreign. The absolute duty in the former instances, and the difference of duty in the latter, was upon an average considerably less than the present difference in the duties on foreign and home made spirits. If to this be added the effect of the uniform operation of the existing duties throughout the United States, it is easy to infer that the situation of our own distilleries is in the main much better, as far as they are affected by the laws, than it was previous to the passing of any act of the United States upon the subject. They have therefore upon the whole gained materially under the system, which has been pursued by the national Government.  
The first law of the United States on this head laid a duty of no more than eight cents per gallon on those of Jamaica proof. The second encreased the duty on foreign spirits to twelve cents per gallon of the lowest proof, and by certain gradations to fifteen cents per gallon of Jamaica proof. The last act places the duty at twenty cents per gallon of the lowest proof, and extends it by the like gradations to twenty five cents per Gallon of Jamaica proof, laying also a duty of eleven Cents per Gallon on home made spirits distilled from foreign materials of the lowest proof, with a like gradual extension to fifteen cents per gallon of Jamaica proof; and a duty of nine cents per gallon on home made spirits distilled from domestic materials of the lowest proof, with the like gradual extension to thirteen cents per gallon of Jamaica proof.  
If the transition had been immediate from the first to the last law, it could not have failed to have been considered as a change in favor of our own distilleries, as far as the rate of duty is concerned. The mean duty on foreign Spirits by the first law was nine cents, by the last the mean extra duty on foreign spirits is in fact about eleven cents, as it regards spirits distilled from foreign materials, and about thirteen, as it regards spirits distilled from domestic materials. In making this computation it is to be adverted to that the four first degrees of proof mentioned in the law correspond with the different kinds of Spirits usually imported, while the generality of those made in the United States are of the lowest class of proof.  
Spirits from domestic materials derived a double advantage from the last law, that is, from the encreased rate of duty on foreign imported Spirits, &amp; from a higher rate of duty on home made spirits of foreign materials.  
But the intervention of the second law has served to produce in some places a different impression of the business, than would have happened without it. By a considerable addition to the duties on foreign Spirits, without laying any thing on those of home manufacture, it has served to give to the last law the appearance of taking away a part of the advantages previously secured to the domestic distilleries. It seems to have been over looked, that the second act ought in reality to be viewed only as an intermediate step to the arrangement finally contemplated by the Legislature; and that as part of a system, it has upon the whole operated in favour of the national distilleries. The thing to be considered is the substantial existing difference in favor of the home manufacture, as the law now stands.  
The advantage, indeed, to the distillation of spirits from the produce of the country arising from the difference between the duties on spirits distilled from foreign and those distilled from domestic materials, is exclusively the work of the last act, and is an advantage which has not been properly appreciated by those distillers of spirits from home produce, who have complained of the law, as hurtfull to their manufacture.  
Causes entirely foreign to the law itself have also assisted in producing misapprehension. The approximation of the price of home made spirits to that of foreign spirits, which has of late taken place, and which is attributed to the operation of the Act in question is in a great degree owing to the circumstances, which have tended to raise the price of Molasses in the West India market, and to an extra importation of foreign spirits prior to the first of July last, to avoid the payment of the additional duty which then took place.  
It is stated in the petition from salem, that previous to the last act the price of domestic to foreign spirits was as 1/9 to ¾, of the money of Massachusetts per Gallon, &amp; that since that act it has become as 3/3 to 4/2.  
It is evident that a rise from 1/9 to 3/3 per gallon, which would be equal to 20 cents, is not to be attributed wholly to a duty of eleven cents. Indeed if there were a concurrence of no other cause, the inference would be very different from that intended to be drawn from the fact, for it would evince a profit gained to the distiller of more than 80 ⅌ Cent on the duty.  
It is however meant to be understood, that this approximation of prices occasions a greater importation and consumption of foreign, and a less consumption of domestic spirits than formerly. How far this may or may not be the case, the Secretary is not now able to say with precision; but no facts have come under his notice officially, which serve to authenticate the suggestion. And it must be considered as possible that representations of this kind are rather the effect of apprehension than of experience. It would even be not unnatural, that a considerable enhancement of the price of the foreign article should have led to a greater consumption of the domestic article, as the cheapest of the two, though dearer itself than formerly.  
But while there is ground to believe that the suggestions which have been made on this point are in many respects inaccurate and misconceived, there are known circumstances; which seem to render adviseable, some greater difference between the duties on foreign and on home made spirits. These circumstances have been noticed in the report of the Secretary on the subject of Manufactures, and an alteration has been proposed by laying two cents in addition upon imported Spirits of the lowest proof, with a proportional increase on the higher proofs, and by deducting one cent from the duty on the lowest proof of homemade spirits, with a proportional diminution in respect to the higher proofs.  
This alteration would bring the proportion of the duties nearly to the standard, which the petitioner Hendrick Doyer, who appears likely to be well informed on the subject, represents as the proper one to enable the distillation of Geneva to be carried on with the same advantage as before the passing of the Act. He observes that the duty on home made Geneva being 9 cents the additional duty on foreign ought to have been twelve cents. By the alteration proposed the proportion will be as 10 to 8 which is little different from that of 12 to 9.  
It is worthy of remark, that the same petitioner states, that previous to the passing of the act, of which he complains, he “could sell his Geneva 16¼ ⅌ Ct under the price of Holland Geneva,” but that “he cannot do it at present, and in future lower than 14 ⅌ Cent.” If, as he also states, the quality of his Geneva be equal to that of Holland, and if his meaning be, as it appears to be, that he can now afford to sell his Geneva lower by 14 ⅌ Cent than the Geneva of Holland, it will follow that the manufacture of that article is in a very thriving train, even under the present rate of duties. For a difference of 14 ⅌ Ct. in the price is capable of giving a decided preference to the sale of the domestic article.  
II. It is objected that the duty, by being laid in the first instance upon the distiller, instead of the consumer, makes a larger capital necessary to carry on the business, and in this country, where capitals are not large, puts the national distillers under disadvantages.  
  
But this inconvenience, as far as it has foundation, in the state of things, is essentially obviated by the credits given. Where the duty is payable upon the quantity distilled, a credit is allowed, which cannot be less than six and may extend to nine months. Where the duty is charged on the capacity of the still, it is payable half yearly. Sufficient time is therefore allowed to raise the duty from the sale of the article, which supercedes the necessity of a greater capital. It is well known, that the article is one usually sold for Cash or at short credit. If these observations are not applicable to distilleries in the interior country, the same may be said in a great degree of the objection itself. The cause of the business, in that quarter, renders a considerable capital less necessary than elsewhere. The produce of the distiller’s own farm, or of the neighboring farms brought to be distilled upon shares or compensations in the article itself, constitute the chief business of the distilleries in the remote parts of the country. In the comparatively few instances, in which they may be prosecuted as a regular business, upon a large scale, by force of capital, the observations which have been made will substantially apply.  
The collection of the duty from the distiller has, on the other hand, several advantages. It contributes to equality, by charging the article in the first stage of its progress, which diffuses the duty among all classes alike. It the better secures the collection of the Revenue, by confining the responsibility to a smaller number of persons and simplifying the process. And it avoids the necessity of so great a number of Officers as would be required in a more diffuse system of collection, operating immediately upon purchasers and consumers. Besides, that the latter plan would transfer, whatever inconveniencies may be incident to the collection, from a smaller to a greater number of persons.  
III. It is alleged that the inspection of the officers is injurious to the business of distilling, by laying open its secrets or mysteries.  
Different distillers there is no doubt, practice, in certain respects, different methods in the course of their business and have different degrees of Skill. But it may well be doubted whether in a business so old and so much diffused as that of the distillation of Spirits, there are at this day secrets of consequence to the possessors.  
There will at least be no hazard in taking it for granted, that none such exist in regard to the distillation of Rum from molasses or sugar, or of the spirits from grain usually called whiskey, or of brandies from the fruits of this country. The cases in which the allegations are made with most colour, apply to Geneva, and perhaps to certain cordials.  
It is probable, that the course of the business might and would always be such, as in fact to involve no inconvenience on this score. But as the contrary is affirmed, and as it is desireable to obviate complaint as far as it can be done, consistently with essential principles and objects, it may not be unadviseable to attempt a remedy.  
It is to be presumed, that if any secrets exist, they relate to a primary process, particularly the mixture of the ingredients; this, it is supposeable, cannot take a greater time each day, than two hours. If therefore, the officers of inspection were enjoined to forbear their visits to the part of the distillery commonly made use of for such process, during a space not exceeding two hours each day to be notified by the distiller, there is ground to conclude that it would obviate the objection.  
IV. The regulations for marking of Casks and vessels, as well as houses and buildings, also furnish matter of complaint.  
This complaint as it regards houses and buildings has been already adverted to: But there is a light in which it is made that has not yet been taken notice of.  
It is said that the requiring the doors of the apartments as well as the outer door of each building to be marked, imposes unnecessary trouble.  
When it is considered how little trouble or expence attends the execution of this provision, in the first instance, and that the marks once set will endure for a great length of time, the objection to it appears to be without weight.  
But the provision, as it relates to the apartments of buildings, has for its immediate object the convenience of the distillers themselves. It is calculated to avoid the very evil of an indiscriminate search of their houses and buildings, by enabling them to designate the particular apartments, which are employed for the purposes of their business, and to secure all others from inspection and visitation.  
The complaint, as it respects the marking of casks and vessels, has somewhat more foundation. It is represented (and upon careful enquiry appears to be true) that through long established prejudice, home made spirits of equal quality with foreign, if known to be home made, will not command an equal price. This particularly applies to Geneva.  
If the want of a distinction between foreign and home made spirits were an occasion of fraud upon consumers, by imposing a worse for a better commodity, it would be a reason for continuing it, but as far as such a distinction gives operation to a mere prejudice, favorable to a foreign and injurious to a domestic manufacture, it furnishes a reason for abolishing it.  
Though time might be expected to remove the prejudice, the progress of the domestic manufacture, in the interval, might be materially checked.  
It appears therefore expedient to remove this ground of complaint by authorising the same marks and certificates, both for foreign and for home made Geneva.  
Perhaps indeed it may not be unadvisable to vest somewhere a discretionary power to regulate the forms of Certificates, which are to accompany and the particular marks which are to be set upon Casks and vessels containing spirits, generally, as may be found convenient in practice.  
Another source of objection with regard to the marking of Casks is, that there is a general prohibition against defacing, or altering the marks, and a penalty upon doing it, which prevents the using of the same Casks more than once, and occasions waste, loss and embarrasment.  
It is conceived, that this prohibition does not extend to the effacing of old marks and placing of new ones by the officers of the revenue, or in their presence and by their authority. But as real inconveniencies would attend a contrary construction, and there is some room for question, it appears desireable that all doubt should be removed, by an explicit provision to enable the officer to efface Old marks and substitute new ones, when casks have been emptied of their former contents, and are wanted for new use.  
V. The requisition to keep an account from day to day of the quantity of spirits distilled is represented both as a hardship and impossible to be complied with.  
But the Secretary is unable to perceive that it can justly be viewed either in the one or in the other light. The trouble of setting down in the evening the work of the day in a book prepared for and furnished to the party must be inconsiderable, and the doing of it would even conduce to accuracy in business.  
The idea of impracticability must have arisen from some misconception. It seems to involve a supposition that something is required different from the truth of the fact. Spirits distilled are usually distinguished into high wines, proof spirits and low wines. It is certainly possible to express each day the quantity of each kind produced, and where one kind is converted into another to explain it by brief notes, shewing in proper columns the results in those kinds of spirits which are ultimately prepared for sale.  
A revision is now making of the forms at first transmitted, and it is not doubted that it will be easy to obviate the objection of impracticability.  
On full reflection the Secretary is of opinion, that the requisition in this respect is a reasonable one, and that it is of importance to the due collection of the revenue, especially in those cases, where, by the alternative allowed in favour of Country distilleries, the oath of a party is the only evidence of the quantity produced. It is useful in every such case to give the utmost possible precision to the object which is to be attested.  
VI. It is alleged as a hardship, that distillers are held responsible for the duties on spirits which are exported, ’till certain things difficult to be performed are done, in order to entitle the exporter to the drawback.  
This is a misapprehension. The drawback is at all events to be paid in six months, which is as early as the duty can become payable, and frequently earlier than it does become payable. And the government relies on the bond of the exporter for a fulfilment of the conditions upon which the drawback is allowed.  
An explanation to the several Collectors of this point, which has taken place since the complaint appeared, will have removed the cause of it.  
The same explanation will obviate another objection founded on the supposition that the bond of the distiller and that of the exporter are for a like purpose. The latter is merely to secure the landing of the goods in a foreign Country, and will often continue depending after every thing relative to duty and drawback has been liquidated and finished.  
VII. It is an article of complaint that no drawback is allowed in case of Shipwreck when spirits are sent from one port to another in the United States.  
There does not occur any objection to a provision for making an allowance of that kind, which would tend to alleviate misfortune and give satisfaction.  
VIII. The necessity of twenty four hours notice, in order to the benefit of drawback on the exportation of Spirits, and the prohibition to remove them from a distillery after sunset, except in the presence of an officer, are represented as embarrassments to business.  
The length of notice required appears greater than is necessary. It is not perceived, that any inconvenience would arise, from reducing the time to six hours.  
But it is not conceived to be necessary or expedient to make an alteration in the last mentioned particular. The prohibition is of real consequence to the security of the revenue. The course of business will readily adapt itself to it, and the presence of an officer in extraordinary cases will afford due accomodation.  
IX. It is stated as a hardship, that there is no allowance for leakage and wastage in the case of spirits shipped from one state to another.  
The law for the collection of the duties on imports and tonnage allows two per Cent for leakage on spirits imported. A similar allowance on home made spirits at the distillery, does not appear less proper.  
X. It is mentioned as a grievance, that distillers are required to give bond with surety for the amount of the duties, and that the sufficiency of the surety is made to depend on the discretion of the chief officer of inspection.  
The requiring of sureties can be no more a hardship on distillers than on importing merchants and every other person to whom the public afford a credit. It is a natural consequence of the credit allowed; and a very reasonable condition of the indulgence, which without this precaution might be imprudent, and injurious to the United States.  
  
The party has his option to avoid it by prompt payment of the duty and is even entitled to an abatement, which may be considered as a premium if he elects to do so.  
As to the second point, if sureties are to be given, there must be some person on the part of the government to judge of their sufficiency, otherwise the thing itself would be nugatory, and the discretion cannot be vested more conveniently for the party than in the chief officer of inspection for the survey.  
A view has now been taken of most, if not all, the objections of a general nature, which have appeared.  
Some few of a local complexion remain to be attended to.  
The representation signed Edward Cook Chairman, as on behalf of the four most western counties of Pennsylvania, states, that the distance of that part of the country from a market for its produce leads to a necessity of distilling the grain, which is raised, as a principal dependance of its inhabitants; which Circumstance and the scarcity of cash combine to render the tax in question unequal, oppressive, and particularly distressing to them.  
As to the circumstance of equality, it may safely be affirmed to be impracticable to devise a tax which shall operate with exact equality upon every part of the community. Local &amp; other circumstances will inevitably create disparities more or less great.  
Taxes on consumable articles have upon the whole better pretentions to equality than any other. If some of them fall more heavily on particular parts of the community, others of them are chiefly borne by other parts. And the result is an equalization of the burthen as far as is attainable. Of this class of taxes it is not easy to conceive one which can operate with greater equality than a tax on distilled Spirits. There appears to be no article, as far as the information of the Secretary goes, which is an object of more equal consumption throughout the United States.  
In particular districts a greater use of cyder may occasion a smaller consumption of spirits; but it will not be found on a close examination that it makes a material difference. A greater or less use of Ardent spirits, as far as it exists, seems to depend more on relative habits of sobriety or intemperance than on any other cause.  
As far as habits of less moderation, in the use of distilled spirits, should produce inequality any where, it would certainly not be a reason with the legislature either to repeal or lessen a tax, which by rendering the article dearer, might tend to restrain too free an indulgence of such habits.  
It is certainly not obvious how this tax can operate particularly unequally upon the part of the country in question. As a general rule it is a true one, that duties on articles of consumption fall on the consumers, by being added to the price of the commodity. This is illustrated in the present instance by facts. Previous to the law laying a duty on home made spirits the price of whiskey was about 38 Cents it is now about 56 Cents. Other causes may have contributed in some degree to this effect, but it is evidently to be ascribed chiefly to the duty.  
Unless, therefore, the inhabitants of the counties, which have been mentioned are greater consumers of spirits, than those of other parts of the Country, they cannot pay a greater proportion of the tax. If they are, it is their interest to become less so. It depends on themselves by diminishing the consumption to restore equality.  
The argument, that they are obliged to convert their grain into spirits in order to transportation to distant markets, does not prove the point alleged. The duty on all they send to those markets will be paid by the purchasers. They will still pay only upon their own consumption.  
As far as an advance is laid upon the duty, or as far as the difference of duty between whiskey and other spirits tends to favour a greater consumption of the latter, they as greater manufacturers of the article, supposing this fact to be as stated, will be proportionably benefitted.  
The duty on home made spirits from domestic materials, if paid by the gallon, is 9 cents. From the communications which have been received, since the passing of the act, it appears, that paying the rate annexed to the capacity of the Still, and using great diligence, the duty may be in fact reduced to six cents per Gallon. Let the average be taken at 7½ cents which is probably higher than is really paid.  
Generally speaking, then, for every gallon of whiskey which is consumed, the consumer may be supposed to pay 7½ cents; but for every gallon of spirits distilled from foreign materials the consumer pays at least eleven cents, and for every gallon of foreign spirits at least twenty cents. The consumer therefore of foreign spirits pays nearly three times the duty, and the consumer of home made spirits from foreign materials, nearly 50 ⅌Cent more duty, on the same quantity, than the consumer of spirits from domestic materials, exclusive of the greater price in both cases, which is an additional charge upon each of the two first mentioned classes of consumers.  
When it is considered that 8/21 parts of the whole quantity of spirits consumed in the United States are foreign, and 7/21 parts are of foreign materials, and that the inhabitants of the atlantic and midland counties are the principal consumers of these more highly taxed articles, it cannot be inferred, that the tax under consideration bears particularly hard on the inhabitants of the western country.  
This may serve as an exemplification of a general proposition of material consequence namely that, if the former descriptions of citizens are able from situation to obtain more for their produce than the latter, they contribute proportionally more to the revenue. Numerous other examples in confirmation of this might be adduced.  
As to the circumstance of scarcity of money, as far as it can be supposed to have foundation, it is as much an objection to any other tax as to the one in question. The weight of the tax is not certainly such as to involve any peculiar difficulty. It is impossible to conceive that nine cents per gallon on distilled spirits, which is stating it at the highest, can from the magnitude of the Tax, distress any part of the Country, which has an ability to pay taxes at all, enjoying too the unexampled advantage of a total exemption from taxes on houses lands or stock.  
The population of the United states being about 4.000.000 of persons and the quantity of spirits annually consumed between ten &amp; eleven millions of gallons, the yearly proportion to each family, if consisting of six persons, which is a full ratio, would be about sixteen gallons, the duty upon which would be less than one dollar and a half. The citizen who is able to maintain a family and who is the owner or occupier of a farm, cannot feel any inconvenience from so light a contribution, and the industrious poor, whether artisans or labourers are usually allowed spirits or an equivalent in addition to their wages.  
The Secretary has no evidence to satisfy his mind, that a real scarcity of money will be found on experiment a serious impediment to the payment of the tax any where. In the quarter, where this complaint has particularly prevailed, the expenditures for the defence of the Frontier would seem alone sufficient to obviate it. To this, it is answered, that the contractors for the supply of the Army operate with goods and not with money: But this still tends to keep at home whatever money finds its way there. Nor is it a fact, if the information of the Secretary be not materially erroneous, that the purchases of the contractors of flour, meat &amp;c are wholly with goods. But if they were the Secretary can aver, that more money has in the course of the last year been sent into the western country from the Treasury, in specie &amp; Bank bills which answer the same purpose for the pay of the troops and Militia and for quarter masters supplies than the whole amount of the tax in the four western counties of Pennsylvania and the district of Kentucky is likely to equal in four or five years. Similar remittances are likely to be made in future.  
Hence the government itself furnishes and in all probability will continue to furnish the means of paying its own demands, with a surplus which will sensibly foster the industry of the parties concerned, if they avail themselves of it under the guidance of a spirit of œconomy and exertion.  
Whether there be no part of the United States, in which the objection of want of money may truly exist, in a degree to render the payment of the duty seriously distressing to the inhabitants, the Secretary is not able to pronounce. He can only express his own doubt of the fact, and refer the matter to such information as the members of any district so situated may have it in their power to offer to the legislative body.  
Should the case appear to exist, it would involve the necessity of a measure in the abstract very ineligible, that is the receipt of the duty in the article itself.  
If an alternative of this sort were to be allowed, it would be proper to make it the duty of the party paying, to deliver the article at the place in each county where the office of Inspection is kept, and to regulate the price according to such a standard, as would induce a preference of paying in Cash except from a real impracticability of obtaining it.  
In regard to the petition from the district of Kentucky, after what has been said with reference to other applications, it can only be necessary to observe that the exemption which is sought by that petition is rendered impracticable by an express provision of the Constitution, which declares, that “all duties, imposts and excises shall be uniform throughout the United States.”  
In the course of the foregoing examination of the objections which have been made to the law, some alterations have been submitted for the purpose of removing a part of them. The Secretary will now proceed to submit such further alterations as appear to him adviseable, arising either from the suggestions of the officers of the revenue or from his own ref[l]exions.  
I. It appears expedient to alter the distinction respecting distilleries from domestic materials in cities, towns and villages, so as to confine it to one or more stills worked at the same distillery, the capacity or capacities of which together do not fall short of four hundred gallons.  
The effectual execution of the present provisions respecting distilleries from home materials in cities, towns and villages would occasion an inconvenient multiplication of officers, and would in too great a degree exhaust the product of the duty in the expence of collection. It is also probable that the alteration suggested would also conduce to public satisfaction.  
II. The present provisions concerning the entering of stills are found by experience not to be adequate, and in some instances not convenient.  
It appears adviseable, that there shall be one office of inspection for each county, with authority to the supervisor to establish more than one, if he shall judge it necessary for the accomodation of the inhabitants; and that every distiller or person having or keeping a still shall be required to make entry of the same at some office of inspection for the county within a certain determinate period in each year. It will be proper also to enjoin upon every person, who residing within the county shall procure a still, or who removing into a County, shall bring into it a still, within twenty days after such procuring or removal, and before he or she begins to use the still, to make entry at the office of inspection. Every entry besides describing the still, should specify in whose possession it is, and the purpose for which it is intended, as whether for sale or for use in distilling; and in the case of removal of the person from another place into the county, shall specify the place from which the still shall have been brought. A forfeiture of the still ought in every case in which an entry is required to attend an omission to enter.  
This regulation by simplifying the business of entering stills, would render it easier to comprehend and comply with what is required, would furnish the officers with a better rule for ascertaining delinquencies, and, by avoiding to them a considerable degree of unnecessary trouble will facilitate the retaining of proper characters in the offices of Collectors.  
III. It is represented that difficulties have in some instances arisen concerning the persons responsible for the duty. The apparent, not being always the real proprietor, an opportunity for collusion is afforded; and without collusion the uncertainty is stated as a source of embarrassment.  
It also sometimes happens, that certain itinerant persons without property, complying with the preliminary requisitions of the law as to entry &amp;c. erect and work stills for a time, and before a half yearly period of payment arrives remove and evade the duty.  
It would tend to remedy these inconveniencies, if possessors and proprietors of stills were made jointly &amp; severally liable, and if the duty were made a specific lien on the still itself, if also the proprietor of the land, upon which any still may be worked should be made answerable for the duty, except where it is worked by a lawful and bona fide tenant of the land of an estate not less than for a term of one year, or unless such proprietor can make it appear, that the possessor of the still was during the whole time without his privity or connivance an intruder or trespasser on the land; and if in the last place any distiller about to remove from the division in which he is, should be required previous to such removal to pay the tax for the year, deducting any prior payments, or give bond with approved surety, conditioned for the payment of the full sum for which he or she should be legally accountable to the end of the year, to the collector of the division to which the removal shall be, rendering proof thereof under the hand of the said Collector, within six months after the expiration of the year.  
As well with a view to the forfeiture of the stills for non entry, as to give effect to a specific lien of the duty (if either or both of these provisions should be deemed elegible) it will be necessary to enjoin it upon the officers of the revenue to indentify by proper marks the several stills which shall have been entered with them.  
IV. The exemptions granted to stills of the capacity of fifty gallons and under, by the 36th. section of the law appear from experience to require revision. Tending to produce inequality, as well as to frustrate the revenue, they have excited complaint. It appears at least adviseable, that the obligation to enter, as connected with that of paying duty, should extend to stills of all dimensions, and that it should be enforced in every case by the same penalty.  
V. The 28th section of the Act makes provision for the seizure of spirits unaccompanied with marks and certificates in the cases in which they are required; but as they are required only in certain cases and there is no method of distinguishing the spirits, in respect to which they are necessary, from those in respect to which they are not necessary, the provision becomes nugatory, because an attempt to enforce it would be oppressive. Hence not only a great security for the due execution of the law is lost, but seizures very distressing to unoffending individuals must happen notwithstanding great precaution to avoid them.  
  
It would be, in the opinion of the Secretary of great importance to provide, that all spirits whatsoever, in casks or vessels of the capacity of twenty gallons and upwards should be marked and certified, on pain of seizure and forfeiture, making it the duty of the Officers to furnish the requisite certificates gratis to distillers and dealers in all cases, in which the law shall have been complied with.  
In those cases in which an occasion at recurrence to the officers for certificates might be inconvenient, blanks may be furnished to be accounted for. And it may be left to the parties themselves in the like cases to mark their own casks or vessels in some simple manner to be defined in the law. These cases may be designated generally. They will principally relate to dealers, who in the course of their business draw off spirits from larger to smaller casks, and to distillers who pay according to the capacities of their stills.  
As a part of a regulation of this sort it will be necessary to require, that within a certain period, sufficiently long to admit of time to know and comply with the provision, entry shall be made, by all dealers and distillers, of all spirits in their respective possessions, which shall not have been previously marked and certified according to law, in order that they may be marked and certified as old stock.  
The regulations here proposed though productive of some trouble and inconvenience in the outset, will be afterwards a security both to individuals and to the revenue.  
VI. At present spirits may not be imported from abroad in casks of less capacity than fifty gallons. The size of these casks is smaller than is desireable, so far as the security of the revenue is concerned, and there has not occured any good objection to confining the importation to larger casks, that is to say, to casks of not less than ninety gallons. Certainly as far as respects rum from the West Indies it may be done without inconvenience, being conformable to the general course of business. The result of examination is that the exception as to this particular in favor of Gin may be abolished. Should any alteration on this subject take place it ought not to begin to operate ’till after the expiration of a year.  
VII. There is ground to suppose, that the allowance of drawback without any limitation as to quantity has been abused. It is submitted that none be made on any less quantity than one hundred and fifty gallons.  
  
VIII. There is danger that facility may be given to illicit importations, by making use of casks which have been once regularly marked, and the certificates which have been issued with them to cover other spirits than those originally contained in such casks. Appearances which countenance suspicion on this point have been the subjects of representation from several quarters.  
The danger may be obviated by prohibiting the importation in such marked casks, on pain of forfeiture, both of the Spirits and of any ship or vessel in which they may be brought. A prohibition of this sort does not appear liable to any good objection.  
IX. The duty of sixty cents per gallon of the capacity of a Still was founded upon a computation, that a still of any given dimensions worked four months in the year, which is the usual period of country distillation, would yield a quantity of spirits which at the rate of nine cents per gallon, would correspond with sixty cents per gallon of the capacity of the still. It will deserve consideration, whether it will not be expedient to give an option to country distillers, at the annual entry of their stills, to take out a license for any portion of the year, which they may respectively think fit, and to pay at the rate of 12½ cents, per gallon of the capacity, per month, during such period. This to stand in lieu of the alternative of paying by the gallon distilled. It would obviate in this case the necessity of accounting upon oath, and would leave it in the power of each distiller to cover the precise time he meant to work his still with a license and to pay for that time only. A strict prohibition to distill at any other time, than that for which the license was given, would be of course necessary to accompany the regulation as far as regarded any such licensed distiller.  
The only remaining points which have occurred as proper to be submitted to the consideration of the Legislature respects the officers of the revenue.  
It is represented, that in some instances from the ill humour of individuals, the officers have experienced much embarrassment, in respect to the filling of stills with water, to ascertain their capacity, which upon examination is found the most simple and practicable mode. The proprietors have in some instances not only refused to aid the officers, but have even put out of their way the means by which the filling might be conveniently accomplished.  
  
It would conduce to the easy execution of the law, and to the very important purpose of retaining and procuring respectable characters as Collectors, if the proprietors and possessors of stills were required to aid them in the execution of this part of their duty, or to pay a certain sum as a compensation for the doing of it.  
The limits assigned in the law respecting compensations are found in practice essentially inadequate to the object.  
This is so far the case, that it becomes the duty of the Secretary to state, that greater latitude in this particular is indispensible to the effectual execution of the law.  
In the most productive divisions the commissions of the Collectors afford but a moderate compensation. In the greatest part of them the compensation is glaringly disproportioned to the service, in many of them it falls materially short of the expence of the officer.  
It is believed, that in no country whatever has the collection of a similar duty been effected within the limit assigned. Applying in the United States to a single article only, and yielding consequently a less total product than where many articles are comprehended, the expence of collection must of necessity be proportionally greater.  
It appears to the Secretary that 7½ per Cent of the total product of the duties on distilled spirits, foreign as well as domestic, and not less will suffice to defray the compensations to officers and other expences incidental to the collection of the duty. This is to be understood as supplemental to the present Custom house expences.  
It is unnecessary to urge to the House of Representatives, how essential it must be to the execution of the law in a manner effectual to the purposes of the Government and satisfactory to the community, to secure by competent, though moderate rewards, the diligent services of respectable and trust worthy characters.  
All which is humbly submitted

fpirits diftilled within the united ftates, confiftently with its main deiign, and with  
the maintenance of the public faith; the faid fecretary re{peCfully fubmits the  
following  
  
R E P Oo R Ze  
  
From the feveral petitions and memerials which have been referred to the fecreta-  
ty,as well as from various reprefentations which have been made to him, it ap-  
pears that objections have arifen in different quarters, againft the above-mentioned  
a@; which have in fome inflances embarrafled its execution, and infpired a defire of  
its being repealed, in others have induced a with that alterations may be made ia  
fome of its provifions.  
  
hele objections have reference to a fuppofed tendency of the a@: rft, To con-  
travene the principles of liberty: 2dly, To injure morals: 3jdiy, To oppreis by heavy  
and exeeflive penalties: 4thly, To injure indultry, and interfere with the bufinefs of  
difuilling.  
  
As to the fuppofed tendency of the a&amp; to contravene the principles of liberty, the  
difcufions of the fubje&amp; which have had place in and out of the legiflature, fuperfede  
the neceflity of more than a few brief general obfervations.  
  
It is prefumed that a revifien of the point cannot, in this refpe@t, weaken the con-  
viction which originally diated the law.  
  
There can furely be nothing in the nature of an internal duty on a sonfumable com-  
modity more incompatible with liberty, than in that ef an external duty on a like  
commodity. A doctrine which afferts, chat all duties of the former kind (ufually  
denominated excifes) are incenfiftent with the genius of a free government, is too  
violent, and toe little reconcileable with the neceflities of fociety, to be true. It  
wou d tend to deprive the government of what isin moft countries a principal fource  
of revenue, and by narrewing the diftribution of taxes, would ferve to ppprefs parti-  
cular kinds of induftry. It would throw, ia the firit inftance, an undue proportion  
of the public burthen on the merchant, and on the landholder.  
  
This is one of thofe cafes in which names have an improper influence, and in which  
certain prepoffeflions exclude a due attention to facts.  
  
Accordingly, the law under confideration is,complained of, though free from the  
features which have ferved in other cafes to render laws on the fame fubje&amp;t exce;-  
tenable. And though the differences have been pointed out, they have not only  
nen overlooked, but the very things which have been ftudioufly avoided in the fc r-  
mation of the law, are charged upon it, and that too, from quarters where ifs opera-  
tion would, from circumftances, have worn the Jeaft appearance of them.  
  
It has been heretofore noticed, that the chief carcumittances, which in certain excife  
ws have given occafion tu the charge of their being unfriendly to liberty, are not to  
ve found in the aét, which is the fubjedt of this report; namely ; rft, A fummary and  
tlcretionary jurifdiftion in the cxcife officers, contrary tethe courfe of the commen

law, and in abridgment of the right of trial by jury: and adly, A general pewer jg  
the fame officers to fearch and in{pect indi/criminately, all the heufes and buildings of  
the perfons engaged in the bufinels to which the tax relates.  
  
Asto the firit particular, there is nothing in the act, even to give colour to a charge  
of the kind againit it, and accordingly, it has not been breught. But as to the lecond,  
  
avery different ewer has been imiftaken for it, and the act is complained of as confer.  
ring that very Seni of indifcriminate fearch and infpection  
  
‘The fad, neverthelefs, isotherwife. Ar officer, under che a&amp; in queftion, can jp.  
fpect or fearch no houfe or bwiding, or even apartment of any houfe or building, which  
has not been previou/ly entered sud marked by the pofleflor, as a place ufed for diftilling  
or ke eping ipu its.  
  
And even the power fo qualified is only applicable to diftilleries from foreign mate.  
rials, and in cities, towns and villages, from domeftic materials; that is, only in cafes  
in which the law contemplates,thac the bufinefs is carried on wpes fuch a feale as ef.  
feClually tu feparate the difillery from the dwelling of the diftit The dittilleries  
{cattcred over the Country, which form much the greateit part of the whole, are in no  
degree fubject tod Gilcratinnaty infpection and fearch.  
  
‘The true principle of the objection, which may be raifed toa general difcretionary  
power of iafpeCion aud fearck is, that the domisié or dwelling of a citizen ought to be  
tree from vexatious inquifition and intrufion.  
  
This principle cannot apply to a cafe in which it is put in his own power, to feparate  
the place of his bu/ine/i from the place of his batitetion, and by defignating the former  
by vifible public marks, to avoid all intermedd!ing with the latter.  
  
A ditt lery feldom forms a part of the dzwelling of its proprietor, and even where  
it does, it depends on him to diret and limit the power of viliting and (earch, |  
marking out the particular apartment; which are fo employed,  
  
But the requifition upon the diftiller, to fet marks on the building or apartments  
which he makes ufe ofin his buiinels, is one of the topics of complaint aygainik the  
Jaw Such marks are reprefented as a dithonorable badge And thus a regulation,  
detigned as much to conferm with the feclings of the citizen, as for the fecurity a  
the revenue, is converted into matter of objection.  
  
It is not eafy to conceive what maxim of liberty is violated, by requiring perfons  
who carry on particular trades, which are made contributory to the revenue, to de  
fignate by public marks the places in which they are carriedon. There can certainly  
be nothing more harmlels or lefs inconvenient, than fuch aregulation. The thing  
itfelf is frequently dene by perfons of various callings, for the information of cultom-  
ers; aod why it fh uld become a hardthip or grievance, if required for a public pur  
pole, can with diflicuity be imagined  
  
‘The fuppofed tendency of the act to injure morals feems to have relation to the  
oaths, which are in a variety of cafes required, and which are liable to the objection,  
that they give occafion to perjurie  
  
‘The neceflity of requiring oaths, is, whenever it occurs, matter of regret. It is cer  
tainly defirabie to avoid them, as often and as far as poflible. But it is more ealy to  
écfire, than to find, a fwbititure. ‘lhe requiriny of them is not peculiar te the act a  
qucftion. “hey are a common appenc: ve of revenue jaws, and are among the ulwal  
guards of thofe lews, as they are of public and private rights im courts of juitice.  
‘They conttant!y oceur in jury trials, co which the citizens of the united Mates are lo  
much, and io yaurtly attached. The fame objection, in different degrees, lies again  
them in both cals. Yet ic ts not perceivable how they can be diipenfed with in ci  
ther.  
  
It isremarkable that dot) the kinds of fecurity to the revenug which are to be found  
in the act, the eaths of parties, and che inipedction ef officers, are ebjected to. Hi they  
are both to be abandoned, it is not ealy to imagine what fecurity there can be fer any  
{pecies of revenue, which is to be collected from articles of confumption  
  
if precautions of this mature are inconfiftent with liberty, and immoral, as there  
are very“few indirect taxes, which can be colleded without them, the confequen ¢  
mutt be, that the cntire, or almoit entire weight of the public burthens muft, in the  
firit imQance, fall npou fixed and wifible property, boufes and lands, a confequenc  
which weld be found in experiment produdtive of great injultice and inc quality, and

Ir has been fuggefted by fome diftillers, that both the topics of complaint, which  
  
have been mentioned, might be obviated by a fixed rate of duty, adjulted according to  
  
aratio compounded of the capacity of each ftill, and the number and capacities of the  
  
terns employed with it; but this and every fimilar method are objeded to by other  
  
diftillers, as tending to great inequality, arifir g from unequal fupplies of the material  
  
at different times, and at different places, from the different methods of diftillation  
  
pratifed by different diftillers, and from the different de grces of aclivity in the buti-  
ncis which arife from capitals more or lefs adequate  
  
(he refult of an examination of this point appears to be, that every fuch mode, in  
. - &#x27;s  
calesin which the bufinefs is carried on upon an ext five fcale, would neeeflarily  
  
he attended with confiderable inequalities; and upon the whole, would be lets tatis-  
faAory than the plan which has been adopted.  
  
Itis proved by the fulleft information, that, in regard to diftilleries, which are ra-  
ted inthe aw accor ling to the capacity of each ftill, the alternative of paying accor-  
  
ding to the quantity actually diftilled, is viewed in many parts of the un:ted tates as  
  
1 &gt; . » . &gt;) . }  
eflential to the equitable operation of the duty nd it is evident that fuch an alter-  
native could not be allowed, but upon the condition of the party rendering wpon oath  
  
an account of the quantiry of ipirits diltilled by him ; withowt entirely defeating the  
guy.  
  
As to the charge that the penalties of the act are fuvere and oy pref ve, it is made  
niuch general terms, and fo abfolutely, without the ipecification of a fingle particu-  
lar, that it is dithcule te imagine where it points.  
  
The fecretary, however, has carefully reviewed the provifions of the actin this re-  
  
t  
  
e&amp;,and he is not able to difcover ar y foundation for ¢ charge  
  
r  
  
Lhe penalties it inflicts are, in their nature, the fame with thofe which are common  
  
in revenue laws, and in thwir degree comparatively moderate.  
  
Pecuniary fines, from fifty to five hundred dollars, and forfeiture of the article, in  
refpe&amp; to which there has been a failure to comply with the law, are the feverett  
penalties inflicted upon delinquent parties, except in a very few cafes: In two, a for-  
feiture of the value of the article is added tu thet of the article itiell  
others, a forfeiture of the thip or veffel, and of the waygon or  
  
veyance, affiftant in a breach of the law, is likewifle involved  
  
, and in fome

Penalties like thefe, for wilful and fraudulent breaches of an important law, can-  
net truly be deemed either unufual or exceilive. ‘They are jefs than thofe which fe-  
cure the laws of impoft, and as moderate as can promife fecurity to any object of re-  
venue, which is capable of being evad  
  
Phere appears to be but one provilion in the law which admits of a queftien, whe-  
taer the penalty preicribed may not partake of feverity. It is that whick inilicis the

204 Political Reyifter.  
  
The 434 fe&amp;ion of the a&amp; contains a fpecial provifion (and one which it is believed  
is not to be found in any law enacted in this couatry, prior to the prefent conttirur, y_  
of the united fates) by which forfeitures and penaities, incurred without an intention  
of fraud or wilful negligence, may be mitigated or remitted.  
  
This mild and equitable provifion, is an effectual guard againft fuffering, or incog.  
venience, in confequence of undefigned tran{greflions of the law.  
  
The 38th fection contains a provifion in favour of perfons, who, though innoc nt,  
may accidentally fuffer by feizures of their property (as in the execution of the rey.  
nue laws femetimes unavoidably happens) which is, perhaps, entirely peculiar co tie  
law under confider.tion. Where there has even been a probable caule of feizurc, jum.  
cient to acquit an officer, the jury are to aflefs whatever damages may have accrucd,  
from any injury to the article icized, with an allowance for the detention of it, at the  
rate of fix per centum per annum, ¢f the value, which damages are to be paid out of  
the public treafury.  
  
There are other provifions of the a&amp;t, which mark the fcrupulous attention of the go-  
vernment, to proteg&amp; the parties concerned from inconvenience and injury, and which  
con{pire to vindicate the law from imputations of feverity or oppreflion.  
  
‘The fuppofed tendency of the act to injure induftry, and interfere with the bufi-  
nes of diftilling, is endeavoured to be fupperted by fome general and fome {pecial  
reafons; both having relation to the effect of the duty upon the manufacture.  
  
‘Thofe of the firft kind affirm generally, that duties on home manufactures are im.  
politic, becaufe they tend to difcourage them; that they are particularly to, when  
they are laid on articles manufactured from the produce of the country, becaufe they  
have then the additional effe&amp; ef injuring agriculture ; that it isthe general policy  
of nations to prote&amp; and promote their own manufactures, efpecially thole which  
are wrought out of domettic materials; that the law ia queition intreferes with ths  
policy.  
  
Obfervations of this kind admit of an cafy anfwer. Duties on manufadlures tend  
to difeourage them or not,according to the circumftances under which they are laid;  
and are impolitic or not, according to the fame circumftances. When a manufa-  
ture is in its infancy, it is impolitic to tax it; becaufe the tax would be both unpro-  
ductive, avd would add to the difficulties, which naturally impede the firft attempts  
to eflablith a new manufacture; fo as to endanger its fuccefs,  
  
But when a manufaéture (as in the cafe of diftilled {pirits of the united ftates) is  
arrived at maturity, it is as fitan article of taxation as any other. No yooc realon  
can be affigned, why the confumer of a domeftic commodity fhould not centribute  
fomething tothe public revenue, when the confumer of a foreign commodity cov-  
tributes to it largely. And asa general rule, it is not to be cilputed, that duties on  
articles ef coniumption are paid by the confumers.  
  
To the manufaGure itfelf, the duty is no injury, if an equal duty be laid on the rival  
forcign article. And when a greater duty is laid upoa the iatter than upon the former,  
as in the prefent infance, the difference isa bounty ow the domeftic article, and ope-  
ratcs as an encouragement of the manufacture ihe manufadiurer can afford to fell  
hisfabric the cheaper, in proportion to that difference, and is io far enabled to undeilell  
and {upplant the dealer in the foreign article.  
  
The principle of the objection would tend to confine all taxes to imported articles,  
and would deprive the government of refources which are indilpenfibie to a due pro-  
vifion for the public fafety and we.fare; contrary to the plain intention of the coniti-  
tation, which gives exprefs power to employ thote refeurces when neceflary ; a pow-  
er which is found in all goveruments, and is efleutial te their efficiency, and evea w  
their exiilence.  
  
Dutics on articles of internal production and manufacture, form in every country  
the principal fources of revenue. ‘Thofe on imported articles can only be carried to  
a certain extent, without defeating their object; by operating either as prohibitions,  
or as bounties upon imuggling. Uhey are, moreover, in feme degree, temporary;  
for as the growth of manufactures diminifhes the quantura ef duty on imports, the  
public revenue, ceafing to arife from that fource, muit be derived from articles which  
the national induitry has fubftiturcd for thote previoufly imported. If the govern  
ment cannet taen refort te internal meaus for the additional fupplies, which ‘he ear

ferve its exiftence. The community muft be unprotected, and the focial compact he  
diffolved.  
  
For the fame reafons, that a duty ought not to be laid on an article manufa@ured  
out of the produce of the country (which is the point moft infilted upon) it ought not  
tobe laid upon the produce itfelf, nor confequently upon the land, which is the inftru-  
ment of that produce ; becauic taxes are laid upon /and as the fund out of which the  
income of the proprietor is drawn, or, in other words, om account of its produce. ‘Yhere  
ought therefore, on the principle of the objedtion, to be neither taxes on land nor on  
the produce ot land, nor on articles manufactured from that produce. And if a na-  
tion fhould be in a condition to fupply itfelf, with its own manufaGures, there could  
then be very little or no revenue, of courfe there muit be a want of the eficntial means  
of national jattice and national fecurity.  
  
Politions like thefe, however well meant by thofe who urge them, refute them-  
felves, becawle they tend to the diflolution of government, by rendering it incapable  
of providing for the objects for which it was initituted.  
  
However truce the allegation, that it is and ought to be the prevailin g policy of na-  
tions to cherifh their own manufaQures, it is equally true that nations in general Jay  
duties for the purpofe of revenue on their own manufactures; and it is obvious toa  
demonftration that it may be done without injury to them. ‘The moft fuccefsiul na-  
tions in manufactures have drawn the largeft revenues from the molt ufeful of them.  
It merits particular attention, that ardent [pirits are am article which has been gene-  
rally deemed and made ufe of, as one: of the fittelt objects of revenue, and to an ex-  
tent in other countries, which bears, no comparilon with what has been done in the  
unites ftates.  
  
The fpecial reafons alluded to, are of different kinds. —  
  
I. Icis faid, that the act in quettion, by laying a {maller additional duty on foreign  
fpirits, than the duty on home-made [pirits, nas a tendency to difcourage the manu-  
facture of the latter.  
  
This objection merits confideration, and as far as it may appear to have foundation,  
ought to be obviated.  
  
The point however feems not to have becn viewed, in all refpe&amp;s, in a corre&amp;  
light.  
  
Before the prefent conftitution of the united ftates began to operate, the regulations  
of the different ftates, refpecting diftilled fpirits, were very dillimilar. In fome of  
them datics were laid on foreign fpirits only, in others, on domeftic as well as forcign.  
The abfelute duty in the former inflances, and the difference of duty in the latter,  
was, upon an average, confiderably leis than the prefent difference in the duties on  
foreignand home-made fpirits If tw this be added the effect of the uniform operation of  
the exitting duties throughout the united fates, it is eafy to infer, that the fituation of  
our own diftilleries isin the main much better, as far as they are affecled by the laws,  
than it was previousto the pafling of any act of the united ftates upon the fubjec.  
They have therefore upon the whole gained materially under the fyftem which has  
been purfued by the national government.  
  
The firft law of the united ftates on this head, laid a duty of 20 more than eight  
cents per gallon ou thofe of Jamaica proof. The fecond encreafed the duty on foreign  
{pirits to twelve cents per gallon of the loweft proof, and by certain gradations to ff-  
teen cents per gailen of Jamaica proof, The laft act places the duty at twenty cents  
per gallon of the loweft proof, and extends it by the like gradations, to twenty-five  
cents per gallon of Jamaica proof, laying alfo a duty of cleven cents per gallon on  
home-made {pirits, diftilled from foreign materials, of the lowett proof, with a like  
gradual extention to fifteen cents per gallon of Jamacia proof; anda duty of nine  
cents per gallon on home-made fpirits diftil ed from domettic materials of the lowctt  
proof, with che like gradual extenfion to thirteen cents per gallon of Jamaica prvof.  
  
lf the tranfition had been immediate from the firft to the lait law, it could net have  
failed to have been confidered as a change in favour of our own diftilleries, as far as  
the rate of duty is concerned. The mean duty on foreign /pirits by the fir law was  
hine cents, by the laft, the mean extra duty on foreign {pirits is in fa‘: about eleven  
cents, as it regards {pirits diftilled from foreign materials, and about thirteen, as it re-  
gards fpirits diltilled from domeflic materials. In making this computation it is to be  
adverted to, that the four fir degrees of proof mentioned im the law, correspond  
  
  
  
  
  
206 Political Revifter.  
  
with the different kinds of (pirits ufually imported, while the generality of thofe made  
in the united Rates are of the loweft clafs of proof.  
  
Spirits from domeflic materials derived a double advantage from the left law, that  
is, from the encreated race of ducy on foreign im ported fpirits, and from a bivher  
rate of duty on home-mac le Spirits of foreign materials.  
  
But the intervention of the fecond law has ferved to produce i in fome places a differ.  
ent impreffion of the bufiuefs, than would have hap pened without it. By a con  
derable addition to the duties on foreign {pirits, without laying any thing on thole of  
home manufaQure, it has ferved to give to the laft law the appearance of taking  
away a part of the advantayes previoufly fecured to the domeftic diltilleries. Ir me  
to have been overlooked, thac the fecond act ought in reality to be reviewed only as  
an intermediate ftep to the arrangement finally contemplated by the legiflature; ‘and  
that, as part of a fyftem, it has upan the who e operated in favour of the nattonal éif-  
tilleries. The thing | to be confidered is, the fubftamtial exilting diflerence in favour  
  
of the home manufafure a» the law now ttands  
The advantage, ay to the diftillation of {pir rits from the prod uce ef the coun-  
try, arifing from the difference between the duties on fpirits diftilled from foreign  
  
and thofe diftilled from domvitic materials, is exclufively the work of the laft aQ, a  
is an advantage which has not been properly appreciated by thofe diftillers of {pirits  
from home produce, who have complamed of the law, as hurtiulto their nianufac  
ture.  
  
Caufes entirely foreign to the law itfelf have alfo affifted in producing mifappre  
henfion. ‘The apporximation of the price of home-made fpirits, to that of foreiys  
rits, which has of late taken place, and which is attributed to the oper n of th  
in queftion, isin a great degree owing to the circumitances which have tended to  
raife the price of molafles in the Weit-India market, and to an extra importation  
foreign {pirits prior to the firit of July latt, to avoid the payment of the addiuonal  
duty which then took place.  
  
It is tated in the petition from Salem, that previous te the laft act, the price of do-  
meftic to foreign i wasas 1/9 to 3/4, of the money of Matlachufetts, per gallon  
and that fince that act, it has become as 3/3 to 4/2.  
  
It is evident that a rile from 1/9 to 3/3 per gallon, which would be equal to 20  
cents, is not tu be attributed wholly to a duty ofelevencents. Indeed if there were a  
concurrence of no other caufe, the inference would be very different from that intend  
ed to be drawn from the fact, for it would evince a profit gained to the dittiller of  
more than cighty per cent on the duty.  
  
It is however meant to be underitood, that this ap proximation of prices oce:  
  
a greater importation and confumption of foreign, and a lefs confum tion of domei-  
tic {pirits than formerly. How far this may or may not be the cafe, the fecretary is  
not now able to fay with precition ; but no facts have come woder his notice official  
iy, which ferve to authenticate the fuggeftion. And it muwft be confidcred, as pofl-  
bie, chat reprefentations of this kind are rather the effect of apprehention than oi ex-  
perience, It would even he not unnatural, that a confiderable enhancement of the  
prices of the foreign article thould have \ed to a greater confumption of the dometlic  
artic&#x27;e, as the cheapett of the two, though dearer itfelf than formerly.  
  
But ‘while there is ground to belheve “that the fuggeltions which have been made  
on this point are in many refpects inaccurate and mifconceiv ed, there are know  
circumftances, which feem to render advifeable,fome greater difference between the  
duticson foreign andon home-made [pirits. “Chefe circumftances have been noticed in  
the report of the fecretary on the fubje&amp; of manufactures, and an a&#x27;teration has been  
propofed, by laying two cents in addition upon imported {pirits of the loweft proof,  
with a proportional increafe on the higher proofs, and by deducling one cent frem  
the duty on the loweft proof of hou:c-made [pirits, with a proportional dimiaatios  
in refpect to the higher prools.  
  
This alteration would bring the proportion of the duties nearly to the ftandard,  
which the petitioner, ilendrick Doyer, whe appears likely to be well informed on the  
fubject reprefents asthe p oper one,ro enable the diftillition of geneva to be carriedon  
with the fame advantage as before the pafling yof the a&amp;t. He obferves that the duty  
on home-made geneva being 9 cents, the additional duty on foreign, « ught to have  
been a2cents. By the a&#x27;terationy ropofed, the proportion will be as 10 te 8 which  
is little different to that of ia tug.  
  
  
  
  
  
oa  
  
Political Regiffer. 207  
  
It is worthy of remark, that the fame petitioner flates, that previous to the pafling  
  
  
  
le of the act of which he complains, he “ could fel! his geneva 164 per cent. under the  
&#x27; e of Fl ind geneva, OUC that he cann C do it at preicnt, and » future, lower than  
at 14 per ent” i, as he allo itates, the quality of his geneva be equal to that of Hel-  
1 land, and if his n ning be, as it ppears to be, that he can pow afford to fell his gc-  
neva iower by I4per cent. than the geneva of Holland, it wii tullow, that the manu-  
r- facture of that article isin a very thriving train,even under the prefent rate of dutics.  
il Yor a difference of 14 per cent. in the price, is capable ol giving a decided preference  
of to the fale of che domeftic article.  
ng il. It is objecied chat the duty, by being laid in the ff nitance upon the diftiller,

ft proo! lential principles and objects, it may not be unadvifeable to attempt a remedy.

the duty IV The regulations for marking of cafkse aud veflels, as well as houfes and build-  
  
. ave  
  
ogs,alfo furuifl matter of complains  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
208 Political Regifler.  
  
This complaint, as it regards houfes and buildings, has been already adverted  
to: But there is a light in which it is made that has not yet been taken notice  
of,  
  
It is faid that the requiring the doors of the apartments as well as the outer door  
of cach building to be marked, impofes unneceflary trouble.  
  
When it is confidcred how little trouble or expence attends the execution of this  
provifion, in the firft inftance, and that the marks once fet will endure fora great  
length of time, the objection to it appears to be without weight.  
  
Lut the provifion, as it relates to the apartments of buildings, has for its immediats  
obje% the convenience of the diftillers themfelves. It is calculated to avoid the very  
evi! of an indifcriminate fearch of their houfes and buildings, by enabling them to  
defignate the particular apartments, which are employed for the purpofe of their buf.  
nefs, and to fecure all others from infpection and vifitation.  
  
The complaint, 2s it refpets the marking of cafks and veflels, has fomewhat mor:  
foundation. It is reprefented (and upon careful enquiry appears to be true) that  
through long eftablifhed prejudice, home-made fpirits of egual quality with foreign, if  
known to he home-made, will not command an equal price. This particularly ap.  
plies to geneva.  
  
If the want of a diftinGion between foreign and home-made fpirits were an occa-  
fion of fraud upon confumers, by impofing a worfe for a better commodity, it would  
be areafon for continuing it, but as far as fuch a diftinction gives operation toa  
mere prejudice, favourabie to a foreign, and injurious to a domeflic manufacture, it  
furnifhes a reaton for abolifhing ie.  
  
Though time might be expected to remove the prejudice, the progrefs of the do-  
meftic manufadclure, in the interval, might be materially checked.  
  
It appears therefore expedient to remove this ground of complaint by authorifing  
the fame marks and certificates, both for foreign and for home-made geneva.  
  
Perhaps indeed it may not be unadvifeable to veft fomewhere a diicretionary pow.  
er to regulate the forms ef certificates, which are to accompany, and the particular  
marks, which are to be fet upon cafks and veficls containing {pirits, gemerally, as may  
be found convenient in practice.  
  
Another fource of obje4tion with regard to the marking of cafks is, that there isa  
general prohibition againtt defacing, er altering the marks, and a penalty upon doing  
it, which prevents the ufing of the fame cafks more than ence, and occafions waite,  
lofs, and embarraffment.  
  
It is conceived, that this prohibition does not extend to the effacing of old marks  
and placing of new ones by the officers of the revenue, or in their prefence, and by  
their authority. But as real inconveniences would attend a contrary conftruction,  
and there is fome room for queftion, it appears defirable, that all doubt fhould be re-  
moved, by an explicit provifion to enable the officer to eflace old marks and fubltiture  
new ones, when cafks have been emptied of their former contents, and are wanted  
for new ule.  
  
V. The requifition to keep an account, from day to day, of the quantity of fpirits  
diftilled, is reprefented both asa hardfhip aud impoflible to be complied with.  
  
But the fecretary is unable to*perceive that it can juftly be viewed either in the one  
or inthe other light. ‘the trouble of fetting down, in the evening, the work  
of the day, in a book prepared for and furnifhed to the party, muft be incunfide-  
rable: and the doing of it would even conduce to accuracy in bufinefs.  
  
‘Lhe idea of impracticability muft have arifen from fome mifconception.  
  
It feems to involve a fuppotition that fomething is required different from the truth  
of the fact. Spirits diftilled are ufually diftinguifhed iuto high wines, proof {pirits,  
and low wines. It is certainly pofflible, to exprefs cach day, the quantity of each kind  
produced, and where one kind is converted into another, to explain it by brief notes,  
fhewing in proper columns the refults in thote kinds of {pirits which are ultimately  
prepared for fale.  
  
A revifion is now making of the forms at firft tranfmitted, and it is not doubted  
that it will be eafy to obviate the objection of impracticability.  
  
On full reflection, the fecretary is of opinion, that the requifition in this refped is  
a reafowable one, and that it is of importance to the due collection of the revenue,  
efpecially in thole cafes, where, by the alternative allowed in favour of country dil-  
tillcties, the oath of a party is the only evidence of the quantity produced. It is ul

ful in every fuch cafe to give the utmoft poffible previfonto the obje&amp; which is to be  
attefted.  
  
VI. It isalledged as a hardfhip, that diftillers are held refponfible for the duties on  
fpirits which are exported, till certain things diflicult tu be periormed arc Cenc in or-  
der to entitle the exporter to the drawback.  
  
Chis isa mifap prehenfion. The drawback is at all events to be paid in fix months,  
which is as early asthe d duty can become payable, and {rcquently earlier than it does  
become payable. And the government relies on the bond of the exporter for a fuliil-  
ment of the conditions upon which the drawback is allowed  
  
An explanation, to the feveral colleQors, of this 1 int, which has taken place fince  
the complaint appeared, will have removed the caule of it. ,  
  
The fame explanation will obviate another objection founded om the fuppofition  
that the bond of the diftiller and that of the exporter are for a like purpole. Lhe  
Jatter is merely to fecure the landing of the goods in a foreign country, and will of-  
ten continue depending after every thing relative to duty and drawback has been li-  
quidated and finifhed.  
  
Vil. It is an article of complaint that ne drawback is allowed in cafe.of thipwreck  
when fpirits are fent from one port to another in the united fates.  
  
There does not occur any objection to a provifion for making an allowance of that  
kind, which weuld tend to alleviate misfortune and give fatisfaction.  
  
Vill. The neceflity of twenty-four hours notice, in order to the benefit of draw-  
back on the exportation of fpirits, and the prohibition to remove them from a dittil-  
lery after fun-fet, except in the prefence of an officer, are repredented as embarraiff-  
ments to bufinefs.  
  
The length of notice required appears greater than isneceflary. It is not perceive  
ed, that any inconvenience would arife, from reducing the time to fix hours.  
  
But it is mot conceived to be neceflary or expedient to mz ke an alteration in the laft  
mentioned particular, The prohibition is of real conte: quence tu the fecurity of the  
revenue. ‘The courfe of bufinefs will rea lily adapt itfelf to it, and the siieda ofan  
  
oficer in extraordinary cafes wi&#x27;l afford due accommodatien.  
  
IX, It is ftated asa hardthip, that there is no allowance for leakage and waftage in  
the cafe of {pirits thipped from one {tate to another.  
  
The law for the callection of the duties on imports and tonnage allows two per  
  
cent. for leakage on fpirits imported. A fimilar allowance on home-made fpirits at  
difliilery, does not appear lefs proper.  
  
&quot;S. It is mentioned as a grievance, that diftillers are required to give bond twith /ure-  
ty for the amount of the duties, and that the fufliciency of the furety is made to  
pend on the difcretion of the chief officer of infpeion,  
  
The requiring of fureties can be ne more a hardthip on diftillers than on imp oe  
merchants, and every other perfou to whom the public aflorda credit. It is a natus  
confequence of the credit allowed, and a very reafonable condition of the in: lulg  
  
a  
uUce  
  
“&gt;  
  
which without this precaution might be imprudent, and injurious to the united fates.  
The party has his option to avoid it by prompt payment of the duty, and is even  
entitled to an abatement, which may be confidered as a premium if he cleels to do fo.  
Asto the fecend point, if furetics are to be given, there mult be fome perfon on the  
  
part of the gevernment to judge of their (ufliciency, otherwile the thing itlelf would  
be nugatory ; and the difcretion cannot be vefted more, conveniently tor the party  
  
in in the chief officer of int pection for the furvey

Taxes onconfumable articles have upon the whole better pretenfions to equality f  
than any other. Jf fome of them fall more heavily on particular parts of the com. h  
munity, others of them are chiefly borne by other parts. And the refult is an equa. .  
lization of the burthen as far as is attainable. Of this clafs of taxes it is not ealy to  
conceive one which can operate with greater equality than a tax on diftilled {pirits, .  
There appears to be no article, as far as the information of the fecretary goes, which h  
is an object of more equal confumption throughout the united fates. b  
  
In particular diftricls a greater ufe of cyder may occafion a fmaller confumption of :  
fpirits; but it will not be found on aclofe examination that it makes a material dif. .  
ference. A greater or lefs ufe of ardent fpirits, as far as it exifts, feems to depend pr  
maore on relative habits of fobriety or intemperance than on any other canfe, di  
  
As far as habits of lefs moderation, in the ufe of diftilled fpirits, hhould produce jp.  
equality any where, it would certainly net be a reafon with the legiflature either to a  
repeal or leflen a tax, which,by rendering the article dearer, might tend to retrain too be  
free an indulgence of fuch habits. -  
  
It is certainly not obvious how this tax can operate particularly unequally upon the »  
part of the country in quellion, As a general rulc it is atrue one, that duties onar. pe  
ticles of confumption fall on the confumers, by being added to the price of the com. -  
modity. ‘This is illuftrated in the prefent inftance by facts. Previous to the law ay. -  
ing a duty on home-made {pirits the price of whifkey was about thirty-eight cents; Bu  
it is now about fifty-fix cents. Other caufes may have contributed in fome degree to =  
this effect, but it is evidently to be afcribed chiefly to the duty. bill  
  
Unilefs, therefore, the inhabitants of the counties, which have been mentioned, are oe  
greater confumers of fpirits, than thofe of other parts of the country, they cannot pay 7  
a greater proportion of the tax. If they are, it is their intereft to become leis (0, Yi  
It depends on themfelves by diminifhing the confumption to reftore equality. t,  
  
‘he argument, that they are obliged to convert their grain into fpirits in order to re  
tranfportation to diftant markets, does not prove the point alledged. The duty oa Zs  
  
ail they fend to thofe markets will be paid by the purchafers. ‘They will fill pay ¥  
only upon their own confumption.  
  
As far as an advance is laid upon the duty, or as far as the difference of duty between ~  
whitkey and other {pirits tends to favour a greater confumption of the latter, they, # oz  
greater manufacturers of the article, fuppofing this fact to be as tated, will be pro- = p  
portionably benefited. bed ;  
  
The duty on home-made fpirits from domeftic materials, if paid by the gallon, is &lt;  
nine cents. From the communications which have been received, fince the pafling of sire  
the act, it appears, that paying the rate annexed to the capacity of the ftill, and uling ; “.  
great diligence, the duty may be in fa&amp; reduced to fix cents per gallon. Let the ave- i :  
rage be taken at feven and a half ceuts, which is probably higher than is really paid. a  
  
Generally {peaking, then, for every gallon of whifkey which is confumed, the con on  
fumer may be fuppoied to pay feven and a half cents ; but for every gallon of {piri —  
diftilled from foreign materials the confumer pays at leaft eleven cents, and for every &quot;|  
gallon of foreign fpirits at leat twenty cents. The confumer therefore of foreiga + :  
ipirits pays nearly three times the duty, and the confumer of home-made fpirits from = ~  
foreign materials nearly fifty per cent. more duty, on the fame quantity, than the —  
confumer of {pirits from domeftic materials, exclufive of the greater price in both be  
cafes, which is an additional charge upon cach of the two firft mentioned clafles of wauorr  
¢onfumers- : th  
  
When it is confidered that 8-21 parts of the whole quantity of f{pirits confumed i re  
the united ftates arg foreign, and 7-21 parts are of foreign materials, and that the i Soot  
  
4 habitants of the Atlantic and midland countries are the principal confumers of thet .—  
; : : ; - om hi  
  
more highly taxed articles, it cannot be inferred, that the tax under confideration Lt  
  
bears particularly hard on the inhabitants of the weftern country. an :  
  
This may ferve as an exemplification of a general propefition of material conf ™ a  
quence, namely, that if the former defcriptions of citizens are able from fituation fou of  
obtain more for their produce than the latter, they contribute proportionally more tv &quot; -  
the revenue. Numerous other examples in confirmation of this might be adduced. ‘ .  
  
As to the circumitance of the fearcity of money, as far as it can be fuppoled to hav ” a  
foundation, itis as much av objeétion to any other tax as to the one in queltion, Th es (

the higheft, can, from the magnitude of the tax,diftrefs any part of the country, which  
  
has an ability to pay taxes at all, en}: ying too the unexampled advaatage of a total é  
  
exemption from taxes on houfes, lands, or ftock  
Che population of the united {lates h&lt; ing about 4,000,000 of perfons, and the quan-  
  
tity of {parits annually coniumed between ten and eleven millions of gallons, the year-  
  
ly proportion to each family, if confifling of fix perfons, which is a full ratio. would  
  
be about fixteen gallons, the duty upon which would be lefs than one dollar and a half.  
  
The citizen who is abic to maintain a family, and wlio is the owner or occupier of a  
  
farm, cannot feel any inconvenience from fo light a contribution, and the induftrious  
  
poor, whether artizans or laborers, are ufually allowed {pirits or an equivalent in ad-  
dition to their wages  
  
The fecretary has no evidence to fati fy his mind, that real fcarcity of money will  
he found, on experiment, a ferious impediment to the payment of the tax any where.  
Inthe quarter where this complaint has particularly prevailed, the expenditures for  
the defence of the frontier would feem alone fufficient to obviate it. ‘To this it 1s an-  
{fwered, that the contractors for the fupply of the a1 ny operate with goods and nut  
with money. But this ftill tends to keep at home whatever moncy finds its way  
there Nor is it a fact, if the information of the fecretary be not materially errene~  
  
ae  
  
ous, that the purchaics of the contractors of flour, meat, &amp;c. are wholly with goods.  
  
But if they were, the fecretary can aver, that more money has in the courie of the  
lait year been fent into the wettern country from the treafury, in fpecic,and bank .  
bills, which anfwer the fame purpofe, for the pay of the troups and militia, and for i  
quarter-matters fupplies, than the whole amount ef the tax in the four weitern coua-  
tiesof Pennfylvania and the diftrict of Kentucky is like iy to equal in four or five : |  
years. Simularremuttances are likely to be made in future. :  
Hence the government itfe f furnishes, and in all probability will continue to fur- o  
nifh, the means of paying its own demands, with a furpius which will fenfibly folter  
the indultry of the parties concerned, if they avail themfelves of it under the gui-  
dance of a {pirit of economy and exertion.  
Whether there be no part of the united ftates, in which the objection of want of &#x27;  
  
money may truly exift, in a degrce to render the payment of the duty ferioufly dif-  
trefling to the inhabitants, the fecretary is not able to pronounce. He cam enly ex-  
pre(s his own doubt of the fact, and refer the matter to fuch information as the mem-  
bers of any diftrict fo fituated, may have it in their power to offer to the leziflative  
body.  
  
Should the cafe appear to exift, it would involve the neceflity of a meafure in the’  
adbltract very ineligible, that is the receipt of the duty in the article itfelf.  
  
If an alternative of this fort were to be allowed, it would be proper to make it the  
duty of the party paying, to deliver the article at the place in each county where the oifice  
of infpection is kept, and torezulate the price according tv fuch a ftandard, as would  
induce a preference of paying in cahh, except from a real impracticability of obtaining

In regard to the petition frem the diftric of Kentucky, after what has been faid  
with reference to other applications, it can only be neceflary to obferve, that the ex-  
emption which is fought by that petition, is rendered impracticable by an exprefs pro-  
viion of the conftitution, which declares, that all dutics,impolts, and excifes fhall be  
wiform throughout the united ftates. \
  
lathe courfe of the foregoing examination of the objections which have been made  
tothe law, fome alterations have been fubmutted for the purpofe of removing a part  
vithem, The fecretary will now proceed to fubmit fuch farther alterations as appear  
tohim advifeable, arifing either fromthe fuggeltions of the officers of the revenue or  
  
from his own reflections. ,  
1. (t appears expedient to alter the diftinction refpeAing diftilleries from domettie  
materials in cities, towns, and villages, fo as to confine it to one or more ftills worked «  
  
a the fame dittillery, the capacity or capacities of which together do not fail fhort of  
ur hundred gallons.  
  
Che effectua! execution of the prefent provifions refpecting diftileries from home  
materials in cities, towns, and villages, would occafion an inconvenient multiplica-  
tion of officers, and would in too great a degree exhautt the product of the duty in the  
apence of collection, It is alfe probable that the alteration fuggefted would  
tuducs to public fatisfaction.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
212 Political Regiftér.  
  
If. The prefent provifions concerning the entering of ftills are found by experience  
not‘to be adequate, and in fome inflances not convenient,  
  
It appears advileable, that there fhall be one office of infpeQion for each county,  
with authority to the fupervifor te eftablifh more than one, if he thal! judge it necef.  
fary for the accommodation of the inhabitants; and that every diftiller or perfon  
having or keeping a ftill, fhall be required to make entry of the fame, at fome office  
of inipection for the county, within a certain determinate period in each year. It will  
be proper aliv to enjoin upon every peifon, whe refiding within the county, fhall pro-  
cure a itill, or who removing into a county, fhall bring into it a ftill. within twent  
days after fuch procuring or removal, and before he or the begins to wfe the fill, te  
make entry at the office of infpection. Every entry befides defcribing the fill, thoulg  
fpecify in whofe poficilion it 1s, and the purpofe for which it is intended, as whether  
for fale or for vfe in diflilling ; and in the cafe of aremoval of the perfon from ano.  
ther place into the county, fhall fpecify the place from which the ftill hall have been  
brought. A forfeiture of the fill ought in every cafe in which an entry is required,  
to attend an omiflion to enter.  
  
‘This regulation, by fimplifying the bufinefs of entering ftills, would render it eafier  
to comprehend and comply with what is required, would furnith the officers with q  
better rule for afcertaining delinquencies, and, by avoiding to them a confiderable de.  
gree of unneccflary trouble, wil facilitate the retaining of preper charaéicrs in the of  
fi-es of collediors.  
  
lf. Itis reprefeated that difliculties have in fome inftances arifem concerning the  
perfons refpontible for the duty. The apparent, not being alwaysthe real proprie.  
tor, an opportunity for collufion is aflorded; and without collufion the uncertainty is  
fated as a fource of embarrafiment.  
  
It alfu fometimes happens,that certain itinerant perfons without property, complying  
with the preliminary requifitions of the law as to entry, &amp;c. cree and work flills for  
a time, aud before a half-yearly,period of payment arrives, removeand evade theduty.  
  
it would tend to remedy thefe inconveniencies, if poffeflors and proprictors of {tills  
were made jointly and feverally liable, and if the duty were made a /pecific lien onthe  
fill itfelf; af alfo the proprietor of the land, upon which any ftill may be worked,  
fhould be made anfwerable for the duty, except where it is worked by a lawful and  
bona fide tenant of the land of an eftate not leis than for a term of one year, or vnleh  
fuch proprietor can make it appear, that the pofleflor of the ftill was during the whoe  
time without his privity or connivance an intruder or trefpafler on the land: and if  
inthe Jatt place any diftilier about to remove from the divifion in which he is, hhould  
be required previous to fuch removal to pay the tax for the year, deducting any priot  
payments, or give bond with approved furety, conditioned for the payment of the full  
dum for which he or fhe thou!d be legally accountable to the end of the year, to the  
colleGor of the divifion to which the removal thall be, rendering preof thereof under  
  
the hand of the faid colle@or, within fix months after the expiration of the year.  
  
As well with a view to the forfeiture of the fills for non-entry, as to give fate  
a /pecific lien of the duty (if either or both of thele previfions thould be deemed eligible)  
it will he neceflary to enjoin it upon the officers of the revenue to identify by propet  
marks the feveral {tills which fhall have been entered with them.  
  
IV. The exemptions granted to ftills of the capac ty of filty gallons and under, by  
the 36th fection of the law, appear from experience to require revifion. ‘lending  
produce inequality, as well as to fruitrate the revenue, they have excited complait:  
peying duty, fhould extend to ftills of all dimenfions, and that it hhould be enlorced  
every cale by the fame penalty.  
  
V. The 28th feétion of the a&amp; makes provifion for the feizure of [pirits unaccom  
panied with marks and certificates in the cafes in which they are required ; but a  
they arerequired only in certain cases, and there is no method of diftinguihhing the  
{pirits, im refpett to which they are neceflary, from thofe in refpect to which they are  
not neceflary, the provifion becomes nugatery, becaufe an attempt to enforce it would  
be oppreflive. Hence not only a great fecurity for the due execution of the law is lett,  
but feizures very difirefling to unfffcnding individuals muft happen metwithitanaing  
great precaution to avoid them.  
  
It would be, in the opinion of the fecretary, of great importance to provide, that al

fhould be marked and certified, on pain of feizure and forfeiture, making it the duty  
of the officers to.furnith the requifite certificates gratis to diftiilers and dealers, in all  
cafes in which the law fhall have been complied with.  
  
la thefe cafes in which an occafion of recurrence to the officers for certificates might  
he inconvenient, dlanks may be furnifhed to be accounted for. And it may be leit co  
the parties themfelves in the like cafes to mark their own cafks or vcilels in fome lim-  
sle manner to be defined in the law. ‘Thefe cafes may be defignated generally. They  
will principally relate to dealers, who in the courfe of their bufinefs draw off {pirits  
from larger to {maller cafks, and to diltillers who pay according to the capacities of  
their ftills.  
  
Asa part of a regulation of this fort it will be neceflary to require, that within  
a certain period, fufliciently long to admit of time to know and comply with the pro-  
vilien, entry fhall be made, by ali dealers and ditlillers, of all fpirits in their refpec-  
tive poflciliens, which fhail not have been previoufly marked and certified according  
to law, in order that they may be marked and certitied as old flock.  
  
The regulations here propofed, though productive of fome trouble and inconveni-  
ence in the out-fet, will be afterwards a fecurity both to individuals and tothe revenue,  
  
Vi. At prefent fpirits may not be imported trom abroad in cafks of lefs capacity  
than fifty gallons. ‘The fize of thefe cafks is fmalier than is defirable, fo far as the fe-  
curity of the revenue is concerned, and there has not occurred any good objection to  
confining the importation to larger cafks, that isto fay, to cafks of not lefsthan nine-  
ty gallons, Certainly as far as refpecis rum from the Wefl-Indies it may be don  
without ificonvenience, being conformable to the general courle of bufinels. The re-  
fult of examination is that the exception as to this particular in favor of gin may be  
abolifhed. Should any alteration on this fubje&amp; take place it ought not io begin to  
operate till after the expiration of a year.  
  
Vil. There is ground to fuppofe, that the allowance of drawback without any li-  
mitation as to quantity has been abuied. Ir is fubmitted, that mone be made on any  
lefs quantity than one hundred and fifty gallons.  
  
  
  
Vill. There is danger that facility may be given to illicit importations, by making  
ufe of cafks which have been once regularly marked, and the certéficates which have  
been iffued with them to cover other [pirits than thofe originally contained in fuch  
caiks. Appearances which countenance fulpicion on this point have been the fubjedis  
of reprefentation from feveral quarters.  
  
The danger may be obviated by prohibiting the importation in fuch marked catks  
on pain of forfeiture, both of the fpirits and of any fhip or veflel in whicit&#x27;they may be  
brought. &lt;A prohibition of this fort does not appear liable to any good objection,  
  
IX. The duty of fixty cents per gal’on of the capacity of a ftill was founded upon a  
computation, that a {till of any given dimenfons worked fowr months in the year,  
which is the ufual period of country diftillation, would yield a quantity of fpirits which  
at the rate of nine cents per gallon, would correfpond with fixty cents per gallon of  
the capacity of the fill, It will deferve conlideration, whether it will not be expedi-  
ent togive an option to country diitillers, at the annual entry of their fills, w take  
outa licence for any portion of the year, which they may refpectively think fit, and to  
pty at the rate of 124 cents per ga&#x27;lon of the capacity, per month, during fuch period,  
histo ftand an lieu of the alternative of paying by the gallon diftilied. Jt would ob-  
viate in this cafe the accellicy of accounting upon oath, and would leave it in the  
power of cach diltiller to cover the precife time he meant to work his ftill with a li-  
gence, and to pay for chat time only. A itrict prohibition co diltil at any other time,  
than that for which the licence was given, would be of courle necellary to accumpany  
the regulation as far ag regarded any (uch heeafed difliler.  
  
‘ The only rem uning points which have occurred, as proper to be fubmitted to the  
confideration of the leyiilature, refpects the officers of the revenue.  
  
It isreprefented, that in fome inttauces, from the ill humour of individuals, the of-  
ficers have experienced much embarraiiment, in refpe to the filling of fills with  
Water, to alcertain their capacity, which upon examination is found the moft fimple  
and practicable mode. ‘The proprictors have in fome initances not only refufed to  
aid the officers, but have even put out of their way the nreans by which the hiling  
Bicht be conveniently accomplited.  
  
it would conduce to the ealy execution of the law, and to the very important pur-  
Pole of retaining and procuring refpectable characters as colleclors, if the proprietors  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
214 Intelligence.  
  
and poffeffors of ftills were required to aid them in the execution of this part of their  
duty, or to pay a certain fum as a compenfation for the doing of it.  
  
The limits afligned in the law refpecting compenfations are found in practice effen.  
tially inadequate to the objet.  
  
This is fo far the cafe, that it becomes the duty of the fecretary to flate, that great.  
er latitude in this particular is indi/pen/ible to the effeClual execution of the law.  
  
In the moft productive pivisioNns, the commitlions of the collectors afford but a mo.  
derate compenfation. In the greateft part of rmem the compenfation is glaringly  
difproportioned to the fervice, in many of them it falls materially fhort of the ex pence  
of the officer.  
  
It is believed, that in no country whatever has the colle&amp;ion of a fimilar duty been  
effeed within the limit afligned. Applying in the united ftates to a Ang/e article on.  
ly, and yielding confequently a lefs total product than where many articles are com.  
prehended, the expence of collection muft of neceflity be proportionally greater,  
  
It appears to the fecretary that 74 percent. of the total product of the duties on  
diftilled f{pirits, foreign as weilas domettic, and not lefs, will fuffice to defray the com.  
penfations to officers and other expences incidental to the collection of the duty, ‘This  
is to be underftood as fupplemental to the prefent cuftom-houfe expences.  
  
It is unneceflary to urge to the houfe of reprefentatives, how effential it mutt be  
to the execution of the law, in a manner effetual to the purpofes of the government  
and fatisfactory to the community, to fecure by competent, though moderate rewards,  
the diligent ervices of refpectable and trult-worthy charaéters.  
  
All which ts humbly fubmitted.

Read in the the House of Reprefcnta­  
tives on the 6th instant.  
IN obedience to the Orders of the House o)

from articles of the growth or produce   
the United States, or from foreign art.i  
cles, within the fame, can, in his opinion  
be made in the act for laying duties upoi  
spirits dijlilled within the United States  
confidently with its main design, ani  
with the maintenance of the public faith .  
the said Secretary rejpectfully Jubmits tk  
following  
REPORT.  
FROM the several petitions and me  
morials which have been referrec  
to the&quot; Secretary, as well as from vari  
ous representations which have beer  
made to him, it appears that objection:  
have arisen in different quarters againf  
the above mentioned a£l ; which hav&lt;  
in some instances embarrassed it&#x27;s exe  
cution, and inspired a delire of its be  
inff repealed, in others have induced 1  
wish that alterations may be made ir  
some of its provisions.  
Th?fe o&#x27;oje&amp;ions have reference to ;  
fuppoled tendency of the a£t: lft, Tt  
contravene the principles of liberty  
2dly, To injure morals : 3dly, to oppref  
by heavy and excessive penalties : 4thly  
To injure industry and interfere wit!  
the business of di ft illing.  
As to the supposed tendency of th(  
a£l to contravene the principles of lib  
erty, the discussions of the fubjeft whicl  
have had place in and out of the Legif  
lature, supersede the necessity of mori  
than a few brief general observations.  
It is presumed that a revision of th&lt;  
point cannot in this refpeft weaken th&lt;  
convittion which originally didtatec  
the law.  
There can surely be nothing in th(  
nature of an internal duty on a confuma  
ble commodity more incompatible wit!  
liberty, than in that of an external du  
ty on a like commodity. A doftrini  
which aflerts, that all duties of the for  
merkind (usually denominated excises  
are inconftftent with the genius of a fre&lt;  
government, is too violent and too lit  
tie reconcileable with the neceflities o  
society to be true. It would tend t(  
deprive the government of what is ir  
most countries a principal source of re  
venue, and by narrowing the diftribu  
ticn of taxes, would serve to oppref  
particular kinds of industry. It woulc  
throw in the firft instance an undu(  
proportion of the public burthen on th&lt;  
merchant and on the landholder.  
This is one of those cases in whicl  
names have an improper influence, anc  
in which certain prepoffeflions excludc  
a due attention to facts.  
Accordingly the law under consider­  
ation is complained of though free frorr  
the features, which have served in o­  
ther cases to render laws on the lame  
fubjeft exceptionable. And though the  
differences have been pointed out, they  
have not only been overlooked, but the  
very things, which have been studious­  
ly avoided in the formation of the law,  
are charged upon it, and that too from  
quarters where its operation would  
from circumstances have worn the least  
appearance of them.  
It has been heretofore noticed, that  
lie chief circumstances, which in cer

tain excise-laws have given occasion to  
the charge of their being unfriendly tc  
liberty, are not to be found in the act.  
which is the fubjeft of this report ;  
namely: lft, A summary and diicreti­  
onaryjurifdiftion in the excise officer;  
contrary to the course of the common  
law, and in abridgment of the right oi  
trial by jury : and 2ndly, A genera  
power in the fame officers to search am  
infpeft indiscriminately all the houses anc  
buildings of the pcrfons engaged in thf  
business to which the tax relates.  
As to the firft particular, there is no  
thing in the ast even to give colour tc  
a charge of the kind against it, and ac  
cordingly it has not been brought  
But as to the second, a very differen.  
■power has been mistaken for it, and th&lt;  
ast is complained of as conferring thai  
very power of indiscriminate search anc  
infpeftion.  
The fact nevertheless is otherwise  
An officer, under the ast in question  
can infpeft or search no house or buil­  
ding, or even apartment of any house 01  
building which has not been previoujl)  
&#x27;.ntered and marked by the poffeifor as &lt;  
place ul&#x27;ed fordiftilling or keeping spi­  
rits.  
And even the power so qualified is  
only applicable to distilleries from fo­  
reign materials, and in cities, towns and  
villages from domestic materials ; thai  
is, only in cases in which the law con  
templates that the business is carriec  
on upon such a scale as efFectually tc  
separate the dijlillery from the dwelling  
ot the distiller. The distilleries feat  
tered over the country, which forir  
much the greatest part of the whole  
are in no degree fubjeft to difcretionar)  
inspection and search.  
The true principle of the objection  
which may be raised to a general difcre  
tionary power of inspection and fearcl  
is, that the domicilor dwelling of a citizer  
ought to be free from vexatious inqui  
fition, and intrusion.  
This principle cannot apply to a  
cafe in which it is put in his own powei  
to leparate the place of his business frorr  
the place of his habitation, and b)  
designating the former by visible public  
marks, to avoid all intermeddling with  
the latter.  
A diftillerv seldom forms a part o:  
the dwelling of its proprietor, and ever  
where it does, it depends on him Jo di  
rect and limit the power of visiting anc  
icareh, by marking out the particulai  
apartments which are so employed.  
But the requisition upon the diftillei  
to set marks on the building or apart­  
ments which he makes use of in his bu­  
siness, is one of the topics of complainl  
against the law. Such marks are re­  
presented as a dishonorable badge,  
And thus a regulation, designed as much  
to conform with the feelings of the citi­  
zen, as forthe security of the revenue,  
is converted into matter ofobjection.  
It is not easy to conceive what maxim  
of liberty is violated, by requiring per­  
sons, who carry on particular trades,  
which are made contributory to the  
revenue, to designate by public marks  
the places in which they are carried on.  
There can certainly be nothing more  
harmlefsor less inconvenient, than such  
a regulation. The thing itfelf is fre­  
quently done.by persons of various call­  
ings for the information of customers ;  
and why it should become a hardship  
or grievance, if required for a public  
purpose, can with difficulty be ima­  
gined.  
The supposed tendency of the act to  
injure morals seems to have relation to  
the oaths, which are in a variety of ca­  
ses required, and which are liable to the  
objection, that they give occasion to  
perjuries.  
The necessity of requiiing oaths, is  
whenever it occurs, matter of regret.  
It is certainly defireable to avoid them  
as often and as far as possible. But it is  
more easy to desire than to find a sub­  
  
flitute. The requiring of them is not  
peculiar to the act in question. They  
are a common appendage of revenue laws,  
and are among the usual guards of thoft  
laws, as they are of public and private  
rights in courts of justice. They coti­  
ftant.yoccur injury trials,to which the  
citiz&#x27; ns of the United States arc so much  
&amp; fo\ .lily attached. The fame objection  
in different degrees lies against them in  
both cases. Yet it is not perceivable  
how they can be dispensed with in ei­  
ther.  
It is remarkable that both the kinds o&#x27;  
security to the revenue, which are tc  
be fouftd in the act, the oaths of parties  
and theinfpection of officers, are ob  
jected to. If the)&#x27;are both to be aban  
dorfed, it is not easy to imagine wha:  
fecunty there can be for any lpecies oi  
revenue, which is to be collected froir  
articles of consumption.  
If precautions of this nature are in­  
consistent with liberty, and immoral, a;  
:here are very few indirect taxes, which  
can be collected without them, the  
consequence mull be, that the entire oi  
almost entire weight of the public bur­  
thens mull, in the firft instance, fall up­  
-3n ,fixed and visible property, house.&#x27;  
md lands, a consequence which woulc  
be found in experiment productive oi  
great injustice and inequality, and ru­  
inous to agriculture.  
It has been suggested by fomc distil  
lers, that both the topics of complaint,  
which have been mentioned, might be  
obviated by a fixed rate of duty, adjuft­  
sd according to a ratio compoundec  
of the capacity of each fhill, and the  
tin!*- er and capacities of the cistern;  
employed with it ; but this and ever)  
limilar method are objected to by othei  
diftillcrs,as tending to great inequality  
irifing from unequal supplies of the  
material at different times and at dif­  
ferent places, from the different me­  
thods of distillation practised by differ  
snt distillers, and from the different de  
grees of activity in the business whicf  
arise from capitals more or less ade  
quate.  
The result of an examination of thi:  
point appears to be, that every fuel  
mode in cases in wh-ieh the business i:  
carried on upon an extensive scale.  
would necelfarily be attended wits  
considerable inequalities ; and upon the  
whole would be less latisfactory thar  
the plan which has been adopted.  
It is proved by the fulleft informati  
on, that, in regard to distilleries, whicl  
are rated in the law, according to the  
capacity ofeach still, the alternative o  
paying according to the quantity actual  
[y distilled is viewed in many parts o:  
the United States as essential to the e  
quitable operation of the duty. And il  
is evident that such an alternative  
could not be allowed, but upon the  
condition of the party rendering upon  
jath an account of the quantity of spi­  
rits distilled by him ; without entirely  
defeating the duty.  
As to the charge that the penalties of  
the ast are fevcre and oppreflive, it is  
made in such general terms, and so abso­  
lutely without the fpecification of a sin­  
gle particular, that it is difficult to ima­  
gine where it points.  
The Secretary however has carefully  
reviewed the provisions of the ast in  
this refpeft, and he is not able to disco­  
ver any foundation for the charge.  
The penalties it inflicts are in their  
nature the fame with those which are  
common in revenue laws, and in their  
degree comparatively moderate.  
Pecuniary fines from fifty to five hun­  
dred dollars, and forfeiture of the arti­  
cle in refpeft to which there has been  
a failure to comply with the law,  
are the severest penalties inflicted  
upon delinquent parties, except in a ve­  
ry few cases : In two, a forfeiture of the  
value of the article is added to that oi  
the article itfelf, and in some others a  
forfeiture cf the {hip or vessel, and of  
  
Numb. 40.  
  
:he waggon or other inflrument of con­  
veyance, assistant in a breach of the law,  
is likewise involved.  
Penalties like these for wilful and  
fraudulent breaches of an important  
aw, cannot truly be deemed either un­  
jfual or exccflive. They are less than  
hose which secure the laws of import,  
jnd as moderate as can promise fecuri­  
:y to any object of revenue, which is  
. apable of being evaded.  
There appears to be but one provifi­  
-3n in the law which admits of a quefti­  
3n, whether the penalty prescribed may  
not partake of severity. It is that  
which inflicts the pains of perjury on  
jny person who shall be convicted of  
&#x27; wilfully taking a falfe oath or affirm­  
ition in any of the cases in which oaths  
ar affirmations are required by the act.&quot;  
Precedents in relation to thisparticu­  
,ar vary. In many of them the penal­  
:ies are less severe, than for perjury in  
:ourts of juflice ; in others they are the  
ame. The latter are generally of the  
ateft date, and seem to have been the  
result of experience.  
The United States have in other caf­  
?s purlued the fame principle as in the  
law in question ; and the practice is  
certainly founded on strong reasons.  
lft. The additional security which it  
jives to the revenue cannot be doubted.  
Many who would risk pecuniary for­  
feitures and penalties, would not en­  
counter the more difgraceful punish­  
ment annexed to perjury.  
2. There seems to be no solid dif­  
tinftion between one falfe oath in vio­  
lation of law and right, and another  
!alle oath in violation of law and right.  
A diflitrciioh i.i the puiiifi.ra;nts of dif­  
ferent fpeciesof falfe swearing is calcu­  
lated to beget falfe opinions concerning  
the sanctity of an oath ; and by counte­  
nancing an impression that a violation  
of it is less heinous in the cases in which  
it is lels punished, it tends to impair in  
the mind that scrupulous veneration for  
the obligation of an oath which ought  
always to prevail, and not only to facili­  
tate a breach of it in cases which the  
laws have marked with less odium, but  
to prepare the mind for committing the  
drime in other cases.  
So far is the law under consideration  
from being chargeable with particular  
severity, that there are to be found in it  
marks of more than common attention  
to prevent its operating severely or op­  
pressively.  
The 43d section of the act contains a  
special provifior. (and one which it is  
believed is not to be found in any law  
enacted in this country prior to the pre­  
sent constitution of the United States)  
by which forfeitures and penalties in­  
curred without an intention of fraud or  
wilful negligence may be mitigated or  
remitted.  
This mild and equitable provision is  
an effectual guard against fuffering, or  
inconvenience in consequence of undc­  
figned transgressions of the law.  
The 38th section contains a provision  
in favor of persons, who though iijno­  
cent may accidentally fuffer by fei­  
£ures of their property (as in the execu­  
tion of the revenue laws sometimes una­  
voidably happens) which is perhaps en­  
tirely peculiar to the law under consid­  
eration. Where there has even been a  
;probable cause of seizure, fufficient to ac­  
quit an officer, the jury are to assess  
whatever damages may have accrued,  
from any injury to the article seized,  
with an allowance for the detention of  
it at the rate of fix per centum per an­  
num of the value, which damages are to  
be paid out of the public treasury.  
There are other provisions of the act  
which mark the scrupulous attention of  
the government, to protect the parties  
concerned from inconvenience and in­  
jury, and which conspire to vindicate  
the law from imputations of severity or  
oppression.

The fttppofed tendency of the a&amp; to injure in­  
eultry, and interfere with the business of distil­  
ling, is endeavored to be supported by some gene  
ral and some special reasons j both having rela­  
tion to the effeCt of the duty upon the manufac­  
ture*  
Those of the firft kind affirm generally, that  
duties on home manulaCiurcs are impolitic, be­  
cause they tend to discourage them j that they  
ate particularly fo} when they are laid on articles  
manufactured from the produce of the country,  
because they have then the additional effeCt of in­  
juring agriculture \ that it is rhe general policy  
of nations to proteCt and promote their own ma­  
nufaCtutes 5 efjecialiy those which are wrought  
out of domestic materials j that the law in quel­  
tion interferes with this policy.  
Observations of this kind admit of an easy an­  
swer. Duties on manufactures tend to   
them or not, According to the circuruftances un­  
der which they are laid, and are impolitic or not,  
according to the fame circumstances. When 2  
manufacture is in its infancy, it is impolitic ti  
tax it i because the tax would be both unproduc­  
tive, and would add to the difficulties, which na­  
turally impede the firft attempts to eltabliflr .1  
new manufacture; so as to endanger its success.  
But when a manufacture (as in the cafe of dil­  
tilled spirits of the United States) is arrived at  
maturity, it is as fit an article of Taxation as an)  
other. No good reason can be assigned, why tkc:  
consumer of a domestic commodity should not  
contribute fbmething to the public revenue, when  
the consumer of a foreign commodity contributes  
to it largely. And as a general rule it is not t.  
be disputed, that duties on articles of con­  
sumption are p?tid by the consumers.  
To the manufacture itfelf the duty is no inju­  
ry, if an equal duty be laid on the rival foreign  
article. And when a greater duty is laid upon the  
Jatter than upon the former, as in the prelent in­  
stance, the difference is a bounty on the domestic  
article, and operates as an encouragement of the  
manufacture. The manufacturer can afford tc  
fell his fabric the cheaper, in proportion to rhat  
difference, and is so far enabled to undersell and  
fupp&#x27;.ant the dealer in the foreign article.  
The principle of the objection would tend tc  
confine all taxes to imported articles, and would  
deprive the government of which are  
indifpenfible to a due provifionfor the public fafe­  
tv and welfare ; contrary to the plain intention  
of the constitution, which gives express power to  
employ thole resources when necessary j a power  
which is found in all governments, and is efl&#x27;ential  
to their efficiency, and even to their exigence.  
Duties on articles of internal production and  
manufacture form in every country the principal  
sources of revenue. Those on Imported articles  
can only be carried to a certain extent, without  
defeating their objeCt; by operating either as pro­  
hibitions, or as bounties upon smuggling. They  
are moreover in some degree temporary ; for as  
the growth of manufactures diminiflies the quan­  
tum of duty on imports, the public revenue, ceas­  
ing to arise from that lource, mutt be derived  
from articles which the national industry has sub­  
stituted for those previously imported. If the go­  
vernment cannot then resort to internal means  
for the additional supplies, which the exigencies  
ef every nation call for, it will be unable to   
form its duty or even to preserve its existence.  
The community mud be unprotected, and the fa­  
cial compaCt be dilTolved.  
For the fame reasons, that a duty ought not tc  
be laid on an article manufactured out of the pro­  
duce of the country (which is the point mod infill­  
ed upon) it ought not to be laid upon the produce  
itfelf, nor consequently upon the land, which i&lt;  
the instrument of that produce j because taxes  
are laid upon land as the fund out of which the  
income of the proprietor is drawn, or, in otnei  
words, on account of its produce. There oughl  
therefore, on the principle of the objection, to be  
neither taxes on land nor on the produce of land,  
nor on articles manufactured from that produce,  
And if a nation ihould be in a condition to sup­  
ply itfelf, with its own manufactures, there coulc  
then be very little or no revenue, of course ther&lt;  
must be a want of the essential means of national  
justice and national security.  
Politions like these, however well meant bj  
those who urge them, refute themselves, because  
they tend to the difiolution of government, b)  
rendering it incapable of providing for the objeCt!  
for which it was instituted.  
However true the allegation that it Is and  
ought to be the prevailing policy of nations tc  
cherish their own manufactures, it is equally true  
that nations in general lay duties for the purpose  
of revenue on their own manufactures ; and it is  
obvious to a demonstration that it may be done  
without injury to them. The mod fuccefsful na­  
tions in manufactures have drawn the largest re­  
venues from the most ufefulof them. It merits  
particular attention, that ardent spirits are an ar­  
ticle, which has been generally deemed and made  
use of, as one of the fitted objeCts of revenue, and  
to an extent in other countries, which bears no  
comparison with what has been done in the United  
States.  
The special reasons alluded to are of different  
kinds.—  
I. It is said, that the aCI in question by laying  
a smaller additional duty on foreign spirits, than  
the duty on home-made spirits, has a tendency to  
discourage the manufacture of the latter.  
This objection merits consideration, and as far  
as it may appear to have foundation, ought to be  
•bviated.  
The point however seems not to have been  
viewed in all respeCts in a correCt light.  
Before the present constitution of the United  
States began to operate, the regulations- of the  
different states, respeCting distilled spirits were ve­  
ry difiimilar. In some of them duties were laid  
on foreign spirts only, in others, on domestic as  
well as foreign. The absolute duty in the former  
instances, and the difference of duty in the latter,  
was upon an average, considerably less than the  
present difference in the duties on foreign and  
home-made spirits. If to this be added the effeCt  
of the uniform operation of the existing duties  
throughout the United States, it is easy to infer  
that the frtuation of our own distilleries is in the  
main much better, as far as they are affected by  
  
he laws, than it was previous to ibe pa (Ting of&quot;  
my att of the United States upon the fubjed  
riiey have therefore upon the whole gained m a te­  
la 11 v under the system which has been pursued by  
he national government.  
The firft law of the United States on this head  
aid a duty of no more than eight cents per gallon  
&gt;n those of Jamaica proof. The second encreafed  
he duty on foieign spirits Jto twelve cents pergal­  
an of the lowest proof, and by certain gradations  
o fifteen cents per gallon of Jamaica proof. The  
alt ad places the duty at twenty cents per gallon  
if the lowest proof, and extends it b) the like gra­  
lationsi to twenty-five cents per gallon of Jamaica  
iroof, laying also a duty of eleven cents per gal­  
on on home made spirits difttlled from foreign  
naterials of the lowest proof, with a like gradual  
xtenfion to fifteen cents per gallon of Jamaica  
jroof; and a duty of nine cents per gallon on  
iome made spirits diftilied from domestic materi­  
-11 s of the lowest proof, with the like gradual ex­  
ention to thirteen cents per gallon of Jamaica  
&gt;roof.  
If the transition had been immediate from the  
irft to the iaft law, it could not have failed to have  
&gt;een confiJered as a change in favor of our own  
liftilJerie?, as far as the race of duty is concerned.  
The mean duty on foreign spirits by the firit law  
vas nine cent?, by the last the mean extra duty  
&gt;n foreign spirits is in fad about eleven cents, a­  
t regards spirits diftiiled from foreign materials,  
ind about thirteen, as it regards spirits di(rilled  
&quot;rom domeJHc materials. In making this compu­  
ation it is to be adverted to, that the four firft  
legrees of proof mentioned in the law correspond  
vith the different kinds of spirits usually import­  
id, while the generality of those made in the Uni­  
:ed States are of the lowest class of proof.  
Spirits from domestic materials derived a dou­  
&gt;le advantage from the last law, that is, from the  
ncreafed rate of duty on foreign imported spirits,  
and from a higher rate of duty on home-made fpi  
its of foreign materials.  
But the intervention of the second law has fer­  
fed to produce in some places a different i/npreflion  
if the bufmefs, than would have happened with­  
&gt;ut it. By a considerable addition to the duties  
&gt;n foreign spirits, without laying any thing or  
hose of home manufacture, it has served to give  
o the last law the appearance of taking away z  
&gt;art of che advantages previously fecureu to the  
lomeftic distilleries. It seems to have been over­  
ooked, that the second ad ought in reality to be  
reviewed only as an intermediate step to the ar­  
rangement finally contemplate 4 by the legiftature:  
md that as part of a system, it has upon the whole  
jperated in favor of the national distilleries. ihe  
:hing to be considered is the substantial existing  
iirference in favor of the home manufacture, as  
:he law now stands.  
The advantage, indeed, to the diflillation of  
spirits from the produce of the country arising from  
:Jje difference between the duties on &gt;pirit&amp; uittilleu  
from foreign and those diftilied fr m domestic rna­  
;erials, is exclusively the werk of the ia(t ad, and  
is an advantage which has not been properly ap­  
preciated by those diftiliers of spirits from home  
produce, who have complained of the law, a*  
hurtful to their rranufadure.  
Causes entirely foreign to the law itfelf have al­  
so afiifted in producing misapprehension. Tht  
approximation of the price of home-made fpiriti  
to that of foreign fpirit3, which has of late taker  
place, and which is attributed to the operation o,  
the ad in question is in a great degree owing to tht  
circumstances, which have tended to raise tb&lt;  
price of molasses in the Weft-india market, anc  
to an extra impo:tation of foreign spirits prioi  
to the firft of July last, to avoid the payment o  
the additional duty which then took place.  
1c is stated in the petition from Salem, that pre­  
vious to the last adt, the price of domestic to fo­  
reign spirits was as 1/9 to of the money 0  
Mafifachufetts, per gallon, and that since that ad  
it has become as 3/3 to 4/2.  
It is evident that a rile from 1/9 to 3/3 per gal­  
lon, which would be equal to 20 cents, is not to bt  
attributed wholly to a duty of eleven cents. Jn  
deed if there were a concurrence of no other cause  
the inference would be very different from that in  
tended to be drawn from the fad, for it would e­  
vince a profit gained to the diliiiier of more thai  
eighty per cent on the duty.  
It is however meant to be understood, that thl:  
approximation of prices occasions a greater impor­  
tation and consumption of foreign, and a less con­  
sumption of domestic spirits than formerly. Hovi  
far this may or may not be the cafe, the Secreta­  
ry is not now able to fay with precision $ but nc  
uds have come under his notice officially, vfhicl;  
serve to authenticate the suggestion. And it mud  
be considered, as possible, that representations o  
this kind, are rather the effed of apprehenfior  
than of experience. It would even be not unna­  
tural, that a considerable enhancement of the pri  
ces of the foreign article should have led to  
greater consumption of the domestic article, as th&lt;  
cheapest of the two, though dearer itfelf than for  
merly.  
But while there is ground to believe that th&lt;  
suggestions which have been made on this poir  
are in many refpeds inaccurate and mifconceivec  
there are known circumstances, which seem t(  
render advifeable, some greater difference betweer  
the duties on foreign and on home-made spirits,  
These circumstances have been noticed in the re­  
port of the Secretary on the fubjed of manufac­  
tures, and an alteration has been proposed by lay­  
ing two cents in addition upon imported spirits ol  
the lowest proof, with a proportional increase on  
the higher proofs, and by deduding one cent from  
the duty on the lowest proof of home made spirits,  
with a proportional diminution in lefped to the  
higher proofs.  
This alteration would bring the proportion 01  
the duties nearly to the standard, which the peti­  
tioner Hendrick Doyer, who appears likely to be  
well informed on the fubjed, represents as the pro­  
per one to enable the diflillation of geneva to b;  
carried on with the fame advantage as before tht  
pafling of the ad. He observes that the duty or  
home-made geneva being 9 cents, the additiona  
duty on foreign ought to have been 12 cents. B&gt;  
the alteration proposed, the proportion will be a;  
10 to 8 which is little different to that of 12 to 9,  
It is worthy of remark, that the famepetitionej  
  
Hates, that previous to the pafling of t!,e oj  
which he complains, hr. 44 could Jell his geneva  
16 1-4 per cent, under the price of Holland gene­  
va, but that he cannot dost at present, and in iu­  
ture, lower than 14 per cent.&quot; If, lie all­  
ilatrs, the quaiity of his geneva be equal to thai  
Df Holland, and if his meaning be as it appears tc  
bp, that he can now afford to lell his geneva lower  
by 14 per cent, than the geneva of Holland, it will  
follow that the ina;jufadure of that article is in s  
very thriving trainj even under the present rateoi  
duties. For a cifference of 14 per cent* in the  
(&gt;r3ce is capable of giving a decided piefeience tc  
the sale of tiic domestic arcicle.  
11. it is obje&amp;ed that the duty, by being laid in  
the firft inlfance upon the diltiller, inffead of the  
:onfumcr, makes a larger capital neceflary to car­  
ry on the bufinefsj and in this countrv, where ca­  
pitals are not large, puts the national diltillers un­  
jer disadvantages.  
But this inconvenience, as far as it has founda­  
tion, in the state of things, is efi&#x27;entially obviated  
by the credits given. Where the duty is payable  
upon the quantity distilled, a credit is allowed,  
which cannot be less than fix, and may extend to  
line months. Where the duty is charged on the  
:apacity of the still, it is payable half yearly. Suff­  
icient time is therefore atlowed to raise the duty  
;rom the sale of the article, which fupcrfedes the  
iccefiity of a greater capital. It is well known,  
:hat the article is one ufuaiiy fold for cafii, or at  
liort credit. Ifthefe oblervations are not applica­  
&gt;le to diltilleries in the interior country, the fame  
nay be said in a great degree of the objection it­  
elf. The courf&#x27;e of the business in that quarter,  
•enders a considerable capital less neceflary than  
;lfewhere« The produce of the distiller&#x27;s own  
arm, or of the neighbouring farms, brought to be  
liltilled upon /hares or compcnlations in the arti­  
:le itfelf, constitute the chief business of the dif­  
:iHeries in the remote parts of the country. In  
:he comparatively few instances, in which they  
may be prosecuted as a regular business, upon a  
arge fcale,,by force of capital, the oblervations  
which have been made will fubffantially apply.  
The collection of the duty from the diftiJler has,  
an the other hand, several advantages. It con­  
rributes to equalitj, by charging the article in the  
Srft stage of its progress, which diffufes the duty  
imong all ciaffes alike. It the better secures the  
:olle£tion of the revenue, by confining the respon­  
sibility to a smaller number of ptifons, and fim­  
lifying the procels. And it avoids the necessity  
as to great a number of officers as would be re­  
quired in a more diffufe fyftein of colle&amp;ion, ope­  
4tlng immediately upon purchalers and confu­  
uers. Besides, that the latter plan would tranf­  
r, whatever inconveniencies may be incident to  
lie collection, from a smaller to a greater number  
&gt;f pcrfons.  
111. It is alledged that the infpe&amp;ion of the  
&gt;fiicers is injurious to the business of diftillmg, by  
aving open its secrets or myfferies.  
Dstieient diliiilers there is no doubt, pra&amp;ife,  
n certain respects, different methods in the course  
)f their bufinels, and have different degrees of  
kill. But it may well be doubted whether in a  
lulinefs so old and so much diffufeJ as that of the  
liftillation of spirits, there are at this day secrets  
&gt;f consequence to tne pollefTors.  
There will at leaff be so hazard in tak:ng ir  
or granted, that none such exist in regard to the  
iiftiilation of rum from mola(Te» or fugai,  
&gt;r of the f irits from grain usually called whif-  
Icey, or of branuies from the fruits of this  
:ountry. The cases in which the allegations are  
made w:th molt colour, apply to geneva, and pcf­  
»aps to certain cordials.  
It is probable, that the course of the business  
&quot;night and would always be such, as in fadt to in­  
volve no inconvenience on this fcote. But as the  
:ontrary is affirmed, and as it isdcfirable to obvi-  
Ke complaint as far as it can be done, consistent-  
V with essential piinciples and objedts, it may not  
E&gt;e upadvifeabJe to attempt a remedy.  
It is to be prefumrd, that if any secrets exist,  
hev relate to a primary process, particularly the  
-nixture of the ingredients j this, it is fuppofeable3  
:annot take a greater time each day, than twe  
hours. If therefore, the officers of inlpe&amp;ion  
vere enjoined to forbear their vifirs to the part ol  
he diftiliery commonly made use of for such pro­  
:efs, during a space not exceeding two iv urs each  
lay to be notified by the difti&#x27;ler, there is ground  
o conclude that it would obviate the objedtion.

Vol. I.  
  
Report of the Secretary of the Treasury on  
the Exci/e Law,  
[Continued from our la/1, &amp; concluded.]  
IV. THE regulations for marking of  
Casks and vessels, as well as houses and  
buildings,alfo furnifh matter of com­  
plaint.  
This complaint, as it regards houses  
and buildings, has been already adver­  
ted to : But there is a light in which it  
is made that has not yet been taken no­  
tice of.  
It is said that the requiring the doors  
of the apartments as well as the outei  
door of each building to be marked,  
imposes unnecessary trouble.  
When it is considered how little trou­  
ble or expence attends the execution of  
this provilion, in the firft instance, and  
that the marks once set will endure for  
a great length of time, the objection to  
it appears to be without weight.  
But the provision, as it relates to the  
apartments of buildings, has for its  
immediate object the convenience oI  
the distillers themselves. It is cal­  
culated to avoid the very evil of an in­  
discriminate search of their houses and  
buildings, by enabling them to deiignate  
the particular apartments, which are  
employed for the purpose of their bu­  
siness, and to secure all others from in­  
fpeftion and visitation.  
The complaint, as it refpefts the  
marking of casks and vessels, has some­  
what more foundation. It is repre­  
sented (and upon careful enquiry ap­  
pears to be true) that through long efla­  
blifhed prejudice, home-made spirits of  
equal quality with foreign, if known to  
be home-made, will not command an  
equal price. This particularly applies  
tO .  
ir (he want of a dittin&amp;ion between  
foreign and home-made spirits were an  
occasion of fraud upon consumers, by  
impoling a woife for a better commodi­  
ty, it would be a reason for continuing  
it ; but as far as such a diftinftion gives  
operation to a mere prejudice, favora­  
ble to a foreign, and injurious to a do­  
mestic manufacture, it furnifhes a rea­  
son for abolishing it.  
Though time might be expected to  
remove the prejudice, the progress of  
the domestic manufacture, in the, inter­  
val, might be materially checked.  
It appears therefore expedient to re­  
move this ground of complaint by au­  
thorising the fame marks and certifi­  
cates, both for foreign and for home­  
made geneva.  
Perhaps indeed it may not be unadvife­  
able to vefl lomewhere a diicretionary  
power to regulate the forms of certifi­  
cates, which are to accompany, and the  
particular marks, which are to be set upon  
casks and vessels containing spirits, gen­  
erally, as may be found convenient in  
practice.  
Another source of obje&amp;ion with re­  
gard to the marking of casks is, that  
there is a general prohibition against  
defacing, or altering the marks, and a  
penalty up on doing it, which prevents  
the using of the fame casks more than  
once, andoccafions waste, loss, and cm­  
barraffment.  
It is conceived, that this prohibition  
does not extend to the effacing of old  
marks and placing of new ones by the  
officers of the revenue, or in their pre­  
sence and by their authority. But as  
real inconveniencies would attend a  
contrary conftruttion, and there is some  
room for question, it appears defirea­  
ble that all doubt should be removed,  
by an explicit provision to enable the  
officer to efface old marks and fubfti­  
tnte new ones, when casks have been  
emptied of their former contents, and  
are wanted for new use.  
V. The requisition to keep an ac­  
count from day to day of the quantity  
of spirits diftiiled is represented both as  
a hardship, and impofFible to be com­  
plied with.

But the Secretary is unable to per­  
ceive that it can justly be viewed either  
in the one or in the other light. Ihe  
:rouble of setting down in the evening  
the work of the day, in a book prepared  
for and furnifhed to the party muff be  
nconfiderable, and the doing of it  
would even conduce to accuracy in bu­  
siness.  
The idea of impracticability mud  
have arisen from some miiconception.  
It seems to involve a supposition  
that something is required different  
from the truth of the fatt. Spirits dis­  
tilled are ufualiy distinguished into  
high wines, proof spirits, and low  
wines. It is certainly possible to ex­  
press each day the quantity of each  
kind produced, and where one kind is  
converted into another, to explain it by  
brief notes, shewing in proper columns  
the results in those kindsof spirits which  
are ultimately prepared for sale.  
A rev;(ion is now making of the  
forms at firfi transmitted, and it is not  
doubted that it will be easy to obviate  
theobjeftion of imp radii cability.  
On full reflection the Secretary is of  
opinion, that the requisition in this  
refpefcl is a reasonable one, and that it  
is of importance to the due collection of  
the revenue, ei&#x27;pecially in those cases,  
where, by the alternative allowed in  
favor of country distilleries, the oath of  
a party is theonly evidence ofthe quan­  
tity produced. It is ufeful in every  
luch cafe to give the utmofl possible  
precision to the obiedt which is to be at­  
tefled.  
VI. It is alledged as a hardship.  
that, distillers are held responsible fin  
the duties on spirits which are export­  
ed, till certain things difficult to be  
performed arc uuac, 111 order to entitlf  
the exporter to the drawback.  
This is a mifapprehenlion. Tb&lt;  
drawback is at all events to be paid ir  
fix months, which is as early as the du  
ty can become payable, and frequentl)  
earlier than it does become payable  
And the government relies on the bone  
of the exporter for a fulfilment of th&lt;  
conditions upon which the drawback i:  
allowed.  
An explanation to the several col  
lectors of this point, which has taker  
place since the complaint appeared  
will have removed the cause of it.  
The fame explanation will obviate a  
nother obje&amp;ion founded on the fuppo  
fition that the bond of the diffiller anc  
that of the exporter are for a like pur­  
pose. The latter is merely to secure th&lt;  
landing of the goods in a foreign coun­  
try, and will often continue depending  
after every thing relative to duty anc  
drawback has been liquidated and si  
nifhed.  
VII. It is an articleof complaint thai  
no drawback is allowed in cafe of ship­  
wreck when spirits are sent from one  
port to another in the United States.  
There does not occur any objeftior  
to a provision for making an allowance  
of that kind, which would tend to alie  
viate misfortune and givefatisfaftion.  
VIII. The necessity of twenty-sou:  
hours notice, in order to the benefit o  
drawback on the exportation of spirits  
and the prohibition to remove their  
from a distillery after sunset, except ir  
the presence of an officer, are repre  
fented as embarrafiments to bnfinefs.  
The length of notice required ap  
pears greater than is necefiary. It is no  
perceived, that any inconvenience  
would arise, from reducing the time te  
fix hours.  
But it is not conceived to be necefTar)  
or expedient to make an alteration ir  
the last mentioned particular. The  
prohibition is of real consequence tc  
the security of the revenue. The course  
of business will readily aelapt itfelf to it,  
and the presence of an officer in extra­  
ordinary cases will afford due accom­  
modation.  
  
IX. It is slated as a har&#x27;dfliip, that  
thei &#x27; is no allowance for leakage and  
waflame in the cafe of spirits Ihipped  
frorr one state to another.  
I he law for the collection of the du­  
ties &lt;&gt;n imports and tonnage allows two  
ner ccnt. for leakage on Ipirits import­  
ed. A similar allowance on home made  
Ipirits at the distillery, does not appeal  
less uroper.  
X* It is mentioned as a grievance,  
that distillers are required to give bond  
with furcty for the amount of the duti&quot;.  
and hat t lie fufficiency of the iurcty is  
made to depend on the difcretioti of the  
chief officcr of infpeftion.  
The requiring of sureties can be no  
more a hardship on distillers than on  
importing merchants, and every other  
person to whom the pub&#x27;tfc afford a cre­  
dit. It is a natural cohfequence of the  
rredit allowed ; and a very reasonable  
condition of the indulgence, which  
without this precaution might be im­  
prudent, and injurious to the United  
States.  
The party has his option to avoid it  
ay p/onipt payment oi the duty, and is  
iven entitled to an abatement, which  
may be confidcrcd as a premium ii he  
:!e£ts to do so.  
AC to the second point, if sureties are  
o be given, there mult be some person  
an the partof the government to jud.g­  
aft -;ir fufficiency, otherwise the thing  
tfe;f would be nugatory ; and the dif­  
ctc an cannot be veiled more conve­  
niently for the party than in the chief  
affi&gt; :r of infpeftion for the survey.  
A view has now been taken ot mod,  
if r, it of all, the objections of a general  
nati re, which have appeared.  
Some few of a local complexion re­  
rT*r to.  
The roprefentation signed Edward  
Cook, chairman, as on bchalfof thefour  
most western counties of Pennsylvania,  
states, that the distance of that part ot  
the country from a market for its pro­  
duce leads to a nece&#x27;lity of distilling the  
grain, which is railed, as a principal de­  
dendence ofits inhabitants ; which cir­  
cumstance and the scarcity of cash com­  
bine to render the tax in question une­  
qual, oppressive, and particularly dif­  
trefTing to them.  
As to the circurnftance of equality, it  
mayfafely be affirmed to be impractica­  
ble to devise a lax which fnall operate  
with exact equalitv upon every part oi  
the community. Local and other cir  
cumftances will inevitably create dif  
parities more or less great.  
Taxes on consumable articles have  
upon the whole better pretenfians tc  
equality than any other. If some o:  
them fall more heavily on particulai  
parts of the. community, others of therr  
are chiefly borne by other parts. Andth&lt;  
result is an equalization of the burther  
as far as is attainable. Of this class o  
taxes it is not easy to conceive ons  
which can operate with greater equali  
ty than a tax on distilled Ipirits. Then  
appears to be no article, as far as the in­  
formation of the Secretary goes, whicl  
is an object of more &#x27;equal confurr.ptioi  
throughout the United States.  
In particular diflri&amp;s a greater use o  
cyder may occasion a smaller confump  
tion of spirits ; but it will not be fount  
on a close examination that it makes ;  
ir:»terial difference. A greater or lef  
ule of ardent spirits, as far as it exists  
fecms to depend more on relative ha  
bits of sobriety or intemperance than or  
any other cause.  
As far as habits of less moderation, ir  
the use of distilled spirits, Ihrjuld pro  
dace inequality any where, it woulc  
certainly not be a reason the legif  
lature either to repeal or lefien a tax  
which by rendering &lt;the article dearei  
might tend to reft.ra.in too free an indul  
eence of luch habits.  
O  
It is certainly not obvious how this  
tax can operate particularly unequall)  
upon the part of the country in question,  
  
Numb. 41.  
  
As a general rule it is a true one, tha:  
duties on articles ot consumption fall or  
the confurners, by being added to tin  
price of the commodity. This is il­  
illftratc-l in the present inflance by  
fadts. Previous to the law laying a  
duty on home-made spirits the pi ice of  
whiskey was about thirty-eight cents ;  
it is now about fifty-iix cents. Other  
causes may have contributed in some  
degree to this effect, but it is evidently  
to be ascribed chiefly to the duty.  
Unlel&#x27;s, therefore, the inhabitants of  
the counties, which have been mention­  
ed are greater confurners of spirits. than  
thole of other parts of the country,  
they cannot- pay a greater proportion,  
of the tax. If they are, it is their inte­  
rest to become less In. It depends on  
thernfelves by diminishing &#x27;the con­  
sumption to restore equality.  
The argument, that they&#x27; are obliged  
:o convert their grain into spirits in °or­  
ler to transportation to difrant market?  
Joes not prove the point alledred!  
The duty on all they fend to those mar­  
kets will be paid by the purchafevs.  
I hey will still pay only upon iheir own  
conluriiption.  
As ..ir as an ac.vance is laid upon *he  
duty, or as far as the difference of duty  
between whilkey and other spirits tends  
o favour a greater consumption of the  
atter, they as. greater manufacturers of  
he article, supposing this fact to be as  
dated, will be proportionably benefit­  
id.  
The duty on home-made spirits from  
domestic materials, if paid by the gal­  
lon, is nine cents. From the comm&#x27;i­  
ii cat ions which have been received  
lince the palling of the act, it appears&#x27;  
:,iat paying the rate annexed to the ca­

gence, the duty may be in fact reduced

which is probably higher than is realiy

charge upon each of the two hrli men­

of the whole quantity of spirits confu-r­  
---ed in the United States are foreign, and  
7-21 parts are of foreign materials, and  
that the inhabitants of the Atlantic and  
mid-land countries are the principal  
confurners of these more highly taxed  
articles, it cannot be inferred, that the  
tax under confidera&#x27;tion bears particu­  
larly hard on the inhabitants of the  
western country.  
This may serve as an exemplification  
of a general proportion of material con­  
lequence, namely, that if the former  
descriptions of citizens are able from  
Situation to obtain more for their oro­  
duce than the latter, they contribute  
proportionally more to the revenue.  
Numerous other examples in coaiirma­  
tion of this m&#x27;ght be adduced.  
As to the circumstance of the scarci­  
ty of money, as far as it can be suppos­  
ed to have foundation, it is as much an  
objection to any other tax as to the ono  
in question. The weight of the tax is  
not certainly such as to involve anv pe­  
culiar difficulty. It is impofiibje to  
conceive that nine ccnts per gallon on

the tax, diftrcfs any part of ihe country, which  
has an ability to pay taxes at a)!, enjoying too the  
unexampled advantage of a total exemption from  
on houses, lands, or stock.  
The population of the United States being  
about 4,000,000 of persons, 3nd the quantity oi  
Ipirits annually consumed b-tween ten and elever  
millions of ga)ions, the yearly proportion to eac!  
family, if consisting of fix jerfons, which is s  
full ratio, would be about fixteea gallons, th&lt;  
duty upon which would be !efs than cue dollar am  
a half. The citizen who is able to maintain ;  
family, and who is the owner or occupier of ;  
farm, cannot feel any inconvenience from f  
light a contribution, and the industrious poor  
whether artizans or laborers are ulually allowec  
fjHrits «r an equivalent in addition to their wages  
The Secretary has no evidence to fatisfy hi  
mind, that a real scarcity of money -/&#x27;ill be found  
on experiment, a serious impediment to the pay  
meat of the tax any where. In the qui. &gt; &#x27;er wher&lt;  
tais complaint has particularly prevailed, tb&lt;  
expenditures for the deiencc of the tr ntier woulc  
i &#x27;em alone fuflicienc to obviate ir. I 0 this it ?  
anlwered, that the contra&amp;ors for the supply c  
the army operate with goods and not with monej  
but this still tends to keep at home whatever mo  
ney finds its way there. Nor is it a faCt, if th&lt;  
ir formation of the Secretary be not materially er  
roneous, that the purchafcs of the contractors 0  
fiour, meat, &amp;c. are wholly with goods. But i  
they were, the Secretary &lt;;an avet, that mon  
money has in the course of the last year beer  
lent into the western country from the treasury  
in specie, and bank bills which answer thefam&lt;  
purpose, for the pay of the troops and mil;  
:iand for quarter-masters supplies, than tin  
whole amount of the tax in the four western coun  
tit&#x27;S of ,lvania and the diiliiCt of Kentuclc;  
is likely to equal in four or five years. Simila  
remittances are likely to be made in future.  
Hence the government itfelf furnifhes, and ii  
all probability will continue to furnifli, the mean  
of paying its own demands, with a I&#x27;urplus whict  
will ienfibly fofter the imk»ftry of the parties con  
ccrned, if they avail themselves of it under th&lt;  
guidance of a spirit of economy and exertion.  
Whether there be no part of the ITnited States  
in which the objection of want of money m v  
Truly exist, in a degree to render the payment o  
the duty ferioully distressing to the inhabitants  
the Secretary is not able to pronounce. He car  
only express his own doubt of&quot; the faCt, and reff  
the matter to such information as the member  
of any distriCt to fituared, may have it in then  
power to offer to the legislative body.  
Should the cafe appear to exist, it would in­  
volve the neceflityof a mealure in the abftra&lt;?  
very ineligible, that is the receipt of the duty ir  
the article itfelf.  
It an alternative of this fort were to be allow,  
ed, it would be proper to make it the duty of tlx  
party paying, to deliver the article at the phc*  
in each county where the office of inspeCtion i:  
kept, and to regulate the price according to fuel  
a llandard, as would induce a preference of pay­  
ing in cattt except from a real impracticability o  
obtaining it.  
In repaid to the petition from the distriCt o  
Kentucky, after what has been said with refer­  
ence to other applications, it can only be necessa­  
ry to observe that the exemption which is foughi  
by that petition, is rendered in. &gt; a&amp;icable by ar  
express provilion of the constitution, which de­  
clares, that all duties, imports and excises fhal  
be uniform throughout the United States.  
In the course of the foregoing examination 0  
the objeCVions which have been made to the law,  
some alterations have been submitted for the pur­  
pole cf removing a part of them. The Secretary  
will now proceed to submit such farther altera­  
tions as appear to him advifeable, arising eithei  
from the suggestions of the officers of the revenue  
or from his own reflections.  
J. It appears expedient to alter the diftinCtior.  
distilleries from domestic materials in  
cities, towns and villages, so as to confine it tc  
one or more stills worked at the fame distillery,  
the capacity or capacities of which together dc  
not fall (hort of four hundred gallons.  
The effectual execution of the present provi­  
(ions respeCting diltilleries from home material*  
in cities, towns, and villages, would occasion ar  
inconvenient multiplication of officers, and would  
in too great a degree exhaust the product of the  
duty in the expence of collection. It is also pro­  
bable that the alteration suggested would also con­  
duce to public fatisfaCtion.  
11. The present provi/lon1! concerning the en­  
tering of stills are found by experience not to be  
adequate, and in some instances not convenient.  
It appears advifeabie, that there (hail be one  
office of inspeCtion for each county, with autho­  
jrity to the supervisor to eftabli(h more than one  
if he (hall judge it necefiary for the accommoda  
tion of the inhabitants ; and that every diftille;  
or person having or keeping a still, {hall be rc  
quired to make entry of the fame, at some office  
of inspeCtion for the county, within a certain de­  
terminate period in each year. It will be prope  
also to enjoin upon every person, who relidinj  
■within the county, (hall procure a still, or whe  
removing into a county, (hall bring into it a still  
within twenty days after such procuring or re­  
moval, and before he or (he begins to use the still  
to make entry at the office of infpeCtion. Ever}  
entry besides describing the still, (hould fpecify ii  
whose poffeflion it is, and the purpose for whicl&quot;  
it is intended, as whether for sale or for use ir  
distilling \ and in the cafe of a removal of th&lt;  
person from another place into the county, (hai  
fpecify the place from which the still (hall hav»  
been brought. A forfeiture of the ftili ought ir  
every cafe in which an entry is required, to at­  
tend an omiilion to enter.  
This regulation by Amplifying the -business o  
entering stills, would render it easier to compre­  
hend and comply with what is required, woulc  
furnifh the officers with a better rule for ascertain  
ing delinquencies, and, bv avoiding to them &lt;  
confiijerable degree or unnecefiary trouble will fa­  
cilitate the retaining of proper characters in the  
offices of collector .  
111. It is represented that difficulties have ir  
some instances ari/fen concerning the persons re­  
sponsible for the ci jty. The apparent, not being  
  
always the real proprietor, an opportunity so  
collusion is afforded ; and without collusion th  
uncertainty is stated as a source of embarrafimen:  
It also sometimes happens. th2t certain itine  
rant persons without property, complying wit:  
the preliminary requisitions of the law as to entiy  
&amp;c. ere&#x27;ft and work Hills for a time, and j&gt;efor  
a halr&#x27;-yearlv period of payment arrives, remo&gt;  
and evade the duty.  
It would tend to remedy these inconveniencies  
if pofieflors and proprietors of stills were math  
jointly and severally liable, and if the duty wen  
made a fpecijic lien on the still itfelf ; if also th&lt;  
proprietor of the land, upon which any dill mo;  
be worked should be made answerable for the &gt;lu­  
ty, except where it is worked by a lawful and bo  
na fide tenant of the land of an estate not lcfs thnr  
for a term of one year, or unless such proprietor  
can make it appear, that the pofTetTor of the fti!  
was during the whole time without his privity 01  
connivance an intruder or trefpaifer on the land ;  
and if in the last place any diltiJler about to re  
move from the division in which he is, (hould b.  
required previous to such removal to pay the ta.i  
for the year, deducting any prior payments, 01  
give bond with approved surety, conditioned fn  
.he payment of the full sum for which he or i&#x27;v­  
(hould be legally accountable to the end of the  
year, to the collector of the division to which th&lt;  
removal (hall be, rendering proof thereof undn  
the hand of the laid collector, within fix month  
after the expiration of the year.  
As well with a view to the forfeiture of th&lt;  
ft&gt;lis for non-entry, as to give effect to a fpecijl  
lien of the duty (if either or both of these provi  
lions lliould be deemed eligible) it will be neces­  
sary to enjoin it upon the officers of the revenue  
to identify by proper marks the several ftili:  
which lhali have been entered with them.  
IV. The exemptions granted to stills of the  
capacity of fifty gallons a d under, by the 36tl  
feftion of th# law, appear from experience to   
quire revision. Tending to produce inequality  
as vv?!&#x27; as to fruftrate the revenue, they have ex -  
cited complaint. It appears at least advileabl^  
that the obligation to enter, as connected wir t  
that of paying duty y should extend to still s of al  
dirnenlions, and that it lliould be enforced in ev-j  
ry cafe by the fame penalty.  
V. The 28th fe&amp;ion of the ast makes provi  
fion for the ftizure of spirits unaccompanied wit&#x27;  
marks and certificates in the cases in which thf  
are required \ but as they are required only :r  
certain cases, and there is no method ot diftinguiiy  
ing the spirits, in refpett to which they are n?  
celTary, from those in refpedt to which they an  
not neceflary, the proviOon becomes   
because an attempt to enforce it would be opprei  
five. Hence not only a ;reat fccurity for the dui  
execution of the law is loft, but feizurcs very dif  
treffing to unoffending individuals mult happti  
notwithstanding great precaution to avoid them.  
It would be, in the opinion of the Secretary, o  
great importance to provide, that all spirits what  
loever, in casks or veffcls of the capacity of twen  
ry gallons and upwards fliould be marked and cer  
Tiried, on pain of seizure and forfeiture, makint  
it the duty of the officers to furnilh the requite  
certificates gratis to distillers and defers iwi*  
jafes, in which the law (hall have been compact  
with.  
In those cases.in which an occasion of recur  
•ence to the officers for certificates might be in  
:onvenient, blanks may be furnilhed to be ac  
rounted for. And it may be left to the partie  
hemfelves in the like cases to mark their owr  
:afks or veiTels in some limple manner to be cic-fi-  
Ted in the law. These cases may be defignatec  
,- nerally. They will principally relate to dealers  
a ho in the course of their bulinefs draw off (nirit;  
rom larger to smaller calks, and to distillers w!k  
&gt;ay according to the capacities of their stills.  
As a part of a regulation of this fort it will b&lt;  
leceffary to require, that within a certain pc; :od:  
ufficiently long to admit of time to know anc  
omply with the provision, entry shall be m-.de.  
&gt;v all dealers and distillers, of all spirits in toei 1  
efpe&amp;ive poffefiions, which (hall not have veer  
&lt;revioufly marked and certified according to ,aw  
n order that they may be marked and certified a:  
&gt;ld stock.  
The regulations here propofcd though proouc  
ive of lome trouble and inconvenience in the out.  
et, will be afterwards a security both toindividu­  
ils and to the revenue.  
VI. At present spirits may not be imports  
:rom abroad in calks of less capacity than fitt)  
;alions. The size of these caft:s is smaller tbar  
s desirable, so far as the security of the revenue i 1  
:oncerned, and there has not occurred any t;ooc  
ibjeCiion to confining the importation to largei  
:alks, that is to fay, to calks of not less than nine­  
:y gallons. Certainly as far as refpedtsßum trorr  
he Weft-Indies it may be done without inconve­  
nience, being conformable to the general course o;  
jufinefs. The result of examination is that th&lt;  
exception as to this particular in favor o&gt; gir  
may be aboli/hed. Should any alteration or thi:  
fubjedl take place it ought not to begin to op-rate  
:il! after the expiration of a year.  
VII. There is ground to suppose, that the al­  
lowance of drawback without any limitation as tc  
quantity has been abused. It is submitted thai  
none be made on any less quantity than one hun­  
dred and fifty gallons.  
VIII. There is danger that facility may be gi­  
ven to illicit importations, by making use of calks  
which have been once regularly marked, and the  
certificates which have been issued with them to  
cover other spirits than those originally contained  
in such calks. Appearances which countenance  
fufoicion on this point have been the fubjclts ol  
representation from several quarters.  
The dangei may be obviated by prohibiting the  
importation in such marked calks on pain 0: for­  
feiture, both of the spirits and of any (hip r ves­  
sel in which they may be brought. A prohibi­  
tion of this fort does not appear liable to an;/ good  
obje&amp;ion.  
IX. The duty of sixty cents per gallon of the  
capacity of a still was founded upon a con puta­  
ci n, that a still of any given dimenf.ons vorked  
four months in the year, which is theufusi period  
of country distillation, would yield a qu*.-tity ol  
  
spirits which at the rate of nine cents per gallon,  
would correspond with lixty cents per gallon of the  
capacity of the (Kill. It will deserve considera­  
tion, whether it will not be expedient to give ar  
option to country distillers, at the annual entry oi  
theii stills, to take out a licence for any portion 01  
Hie year, which they may refpe&amp;ively think fit,  
and to pay at the rate of 12J cents per gallon oi  
the capacity, per month, during such per&#x27;»od.  
This to stand in lieu of the alternative of paying  
by the gallon distilled. It would obviate in thi:  
: afe the neceflity of accounting upon oath, anc  
would leave it in the power of each distiller to co­  
ver the precise time he meant to work his (till wit?  
1 licence, and to pay tor that time only. A ftrid  
prohibition to diftill at any other time, than tha  
for which the licence was given, would be of courfc  
nccefl&#x27;ary to accompany the regulation as far a:  
regarded any such licensed distiller.  
The only remaining points which have occur­  
ed, as proper to be (übmitted to the confideratior  
&gt;f the legislature, refpedts the officers of the reve  
t ue.  
it is represented, that in some instances, fron  
he ill humour of individuals, the officers hav&lt;  
xperienced much embarra(Tment, inrefpe&amp;to th&lt;  
illing of stills with water, to ascertain their capa­  
ity, which upon examination is found the mofl  
imple and practicable mode. The proprietor;  
iave in some instances not only refufed to aid th*  
:tficers, but have even put out ot their way th;  
neans by which the filling might be conveniently  
iccomplifhed.  
It would conduce to the easy execution of th&lt;  
awj and to the very important purpose of retain  
ng and procuring relpeOable chara&amp;ers as collec  
:ors, if the proprietors and pofTellors of stills wer­  
equired to aid them in the execution of th.  
&gt;art of their duty, or to pay a certain sum as .  
:ompenfation for the doing of it.  
rI be limits afiigned in the law refpe&amp;ing com  
?enfations are found in practice efTentiaily inade  
juate to the objett.  
This is so far the cafe, that it becomes the dut;  
&gt;f the Secretary to state, that greater latitude ii  
his particular is indifpenjible to the effectual execv  
ion of the laiu.  
In the molt productive divisions the com&gt;  
millions of the collators a::;&gt;;J but a moderan  
:ompenfation. In the greatest part of them tht  
:ompenl2tion is glaringly diiproportioned to ihi  
. rvice, in many • t them it falls materially (hor  
&gt;i&#x27; the expcnce of the otiiccr.  
It is believed, that in no country whatever ha  
he colledion of a similar duty bean effected with  
n the limit afiigned. Applying in the Unice  
states To a fngle article only, and yielding confe  
juently a lets total product than where many ar  
icles are comprehended, thecxpence of collettior  
nuft of neceflity be proportionally greater.  
It appears to the Secretary that per cent, o  
he total produ&lt;sl of the duties on distilled spirits  
&quot;oreign as well as domestic, and not less will fuf  
ice to defray the compensations to officers am  
&gt;ther expences incidental to the collection of thi  
luty. This is to be understood as fupplementa  
o the present custom-house expences.  
It is unneceflary to urge to the House of Repre  
enta&#x27;jnhow eliential it mult be to the execu  
+-.n of the iaw in a manner effe&amp;va! to the pur  
&gt;©les of the government and fatiifadtory to th­  
ommunity, to secure by competent, though mo  
lerate rewards, the diligent services of refpcdtabl  
ind trust-worthy characters.

an 2 FP Ss -F  
ROM the feveral petitions and memorials which have been referred to the  
fecretary, as well as from various reprefentations which have been made  
to him, it appears. that objections have arifen in different quarters again &amp; the

tica, and infpared a defire of its being repealed j in others haveinduced a with  
that alterations may be made in fome of its provitons  
  
Thefe objeStions have reference to a fuppofed temlency ef the a&amp;+ 28, to  
contravene the princi pies of liberty: sadly, to tojuse morala: gly, two « ppreis  
by heavy znd exceffive penalties : gthly, to injure indultry, and wmtectere with  
the bufinefs of dittiling.  
  
As to the fuppoted tendency of the a&amp; to contravene the priaciples of liber -  
ty, the difeulfions of the fubjet? which have had piace in and ont of the le.  
giflature, fupercede the neceflity of more than a tew bricl general obierva-  
tions.  
  
It is prefumed that a revifion of the point cannot in this refpect weaken the  
conviftion which originally diftated the law.  
  
There can furely be nothing in the nature of an internal duty on aconfuma-  
ble commodity more incompatible with liberty, than om that of an external  
duty on a like commodity. A dodtrine which aife. ts, t iat ail duties of the tor.  
mer kind (ufually denominated excifes) are inconfittent with the genius of a  
free government, is too violent, amd too little reconcileable with the neceflines  
of fociety, te be true. It would tend to deprive the gowe: moment of what os, un  
mot countries, a principal fource of revenue, and, by oarrowing the diitritu-  
tion of taxes, would ferve to oppre&#x27;s part.cular kinds of indultry. It would  
throw, in the firt iaftance, an undue propertien uf the public burden on the  
merchant and on the landholder.  
  
This is one of thofe cafes in which names have an improper influence, and  
in which certain prepefleffions exclude a due attention to tacts  
  
Acc rdingly, the law wr fer cont: jeration 1s complained of, though free from  
  
» f  
the features, which have {ervedin other cales to render laws en the iaqve(u.  
je&amp; exceptionable. And though the differences have been pote out, they  
have not on.y ‘een overlooked, but the very thines which have heen r drow lly  
avorded in the formation of the low, are charged upon it, aad that too from  
quarters where its ope: ation would, from cucumMances, have worm che eal ap  
pearance of them.  
  
Jt has been heretofore noticed, that the chief circum@ancer, which in certacn  
excife laws, have given ocethon to the charge of theu being unfriendly to  
liberty, are not to be found in the af, whch is the (ubett of this report ;

greateft part of the whole, are in no degree fubjedt to difcretionary infpeétion and  
fcarch.  
  
The true principles of the objef&amp;tion, which may be raifed toa general dif-  
eretionary power of infpe&amp;tion and fearch, is, that the domicil or dwelling of a  
citizen ought to be&#x27;free from vexatious inquifition and intrufion.  
  
This principle cannot apply to acafe in which it is put in his own power to  
feparate the place of his bufinefs from the place of his habitation, and, by de-  
fignating the former by vifible public marks, to avoid all intermedcling with  
the latter.  
  
A diftillery feldom forms a partof the dwelling of its proprietor ; and even  
where it does, it depends on him to direét and limit the power of vifiting and  
fearch, by marking out the particular apartments which are fo employed.  
  
But the requifition upon the diftiller to fet marks o1 the building or apart-  
ments which he makes ufe of in his bufinefs, is one of the topicsof complaint  
againft the law. Such marks are reprefented as a difhonourable badge. And  
thus a regulation, defigned as much to conform with the feelings of the ci-  
tizen, as for the fecurity of the rewnue, is converted into a matter of objec-  
tion.  
  
It is not eafy to conceive what maxim of liberty is violated, by requiring  
perfonswho carry on particular trades, which are made contributory to the re-  
venue, to defignate, by public marks, the places in which they ave carried on,  
There can certainly be ncthing more harmlefs or lefs inconvenient than fuch a  
regulation. The thing itielf is frequently done by perfons of various callings for  
the information of cuflomers ; and why it fhould become a hardhhip or griev-  
ance, if required for a public purpofe, can with difficulty be imagined.  
  
The fuppofed tendency of the a&amp; to injure morals feems to have relation to  
the oaths, whichare, in a variety of cafes, required, and which are liable to the  
objection, that they give occafion to perjuries.  
  
The neceflity of requiring oaths 1s, whenever it occurs, matter of regret. It  
is certainly defirable to avoid them as eften and as far as poffible. But it is  
more eafy to defire than to find a fubflitute. The requiring of them is not pe-  
culiar to the agt in queflion. They area common appendage of revenue laws,  
and are among the ufual guards of thofe laws, as they are of public and pri-  
vate rights in the courts of juftice. They conftantly occur in jury trials, to  
which the citizens of the united flates are fo much and fe juftly attached. The  
fame objefion in different degrees lies againft them in both cales. Yet it is not  
perceivable how they can be difpenfed with in either.  
  
It is remarkable, that both the kin&#x27;s of fecurity to the revenue, which are  
to be found in the aét, the oaths of parties, and the infpedtien of officers, are  
objeéted to, If they are both to he abandoned, it is not eafy to imagine what fe-  
curity there can be for any {pecies of revenue, which is to be colle&amp;ted from ar-  
ticles of confumption.  
  
If precautions of this nature are inconfiftent with liberty, and immoral, as  
there are very few indirect taxes, which can be colle&amp;ted without them, the con-  
fequence muft he, that the entire or almoft entire weight of the public burdens  
muft, in the firft inftance, fall «upon fixed and vifible property, houfes and  
Jands, a confequence which would be found in experiment productive of great  
injuftice and inequality, and ruinous to agriculture.  
  
It has been fuggelted by fore diftillers, that both the topics of complaint,  
which have been mentioned, might be obviated by a fixed rate of duty, adjufted  
according to a ratio compounded of the capacity of each ftill, and the number  
and capacities of the cifterns employed with it ; but this and every fimilar me-  
  
thod are objeéted to by other diftillers, as tending to great inequality, arifing  
from unequal iupplicsof the material at different times and at different placesy

from the different methods of diftillation praftifed by different diftillers, and  
from the different degrees of a€tivity in the bufinefs which arife from capitals  
more or lefs adequate.  
  
The refult of an examination of this point appears to be, that every fucla  
mode, in cafes in which the bufinefs is carried on upon an extenfive {cale,  
would neceffarily be attended with confiderable inequalities; and upon the  
whole, would be lefs fatisfa€tory thar the plan which has been adopted.  
  
It is proved by the fulleft information, that, in regard to diltulerics, which  
are rated in the law, according to the capacity of eaeh ftill, the alternative of  
paying accordingto the quantity actually diftilled is viewed in many parts of  
the united flates as effential to the equitable operation of the duty. Arnd it is evi-  
dent that fuch an alternative could not be allowed, but upon the condition of  
the party rendering upon oath an account of the quantity of {pirits diftilled by  
him, without entirely defeating the duty.  
  
As to thecharge that the penalties of the act are fevere and oppreffive, it  
is made in fuch general terms, and ( abfolutely withoyt the {pecification of a  
fingle particular, that it is difficult to imagine where it points.  
  
The fecretary, however, has caretuily reviewed the provifions of the agt  
in this re(peét, and he is not able to diicover any foundation for the charge,  
  
The penalties it infli€ts are in their nature the fame with thofe which are  
common in revenue laws, and in their degree comparatively moderate.  
  
Pecuniary fines from fifty to five hundred dollars, and torfeiture of the ar-  
ticle, in refpe&amp;t to which there has been a failure to comply with the law, are  
the fevereit penalties inflicted upon delinquent parties, except in a very few cafes:  
in two, a forfeiiare of the value of the article 1s added to that of the article  
itfelf, and in fome others, a forfeiture of the thip or veffcl, and of the waggon  
or other inftrument of conveyance, affiftant in a breach of the law, is likewife  
involved,  
  
Penalties like thefe, for wilful and fraudulent breaches of an important law,  
eannot truly be deemed either unufual or exceffive. They are lets than thote  
which fecure the laws of impof, and as moderate aS can promiie fecurity te  
any objeét of revenue, which is eapable of being evaded,  
  
There appears to be but one provifion in the law, which admits of a queftion,  
whether the penalty prefcribed may not partake of feverity. It is that which in-  
flicts the pains of perjury on any perfon who fhall be convicted of * wilfuily  
taking a falfe oath or affirmation in any of the cafes in which oaths or afirmae  
tions are required by the a&amp;.”  
  
Precedents in relation to this particular vary. In many of them the pencities  
are lefs fevere, than for perjury in courts of juftice ; in others they are the fame,  
The latter are genevally of the lateit date, and feem to have been the retult of ex-  
perience.  
  
The united ftates have, in other cafes, purfved the fame principle as in the  
law in queftion ; and the prattice is certainly founded on {trong reafons.  
  
rf. The additional fecurity which it gives to the revenue, cannot be doubted,  
  
Many who would rifk pecuniary forfeitures and penalties, would not encoun-  
ter the more difgraceful punifiment annexed to perjury.  
». 2d. There feems to be no folid diftinétion between one falfe eath in violation  
of Jaw and right, and another falfe oath in violation of law and right. A diftine-  
tion in the punifiments of different {pecies of faife wearing is calculated to bee  
get falfe opinions concerning the fantity of an oath; and by countenancing an  
impreffion that a violation of it is lefs heinous in the cafes in which it is le(s  
punithed, it tends to impair in the mind that fcrupulous veneration for the obli-  
gation of an oath, which ought always to prevail, and not only to facilitate a  
breach of it in cafes which the laws have marked with le{s odium, but to pres  
pare the mind for committing the crime in other cafes, .

So far is the law under confideration from being chargeable with particular  
feverity, ‘nat there are to be found in it, marks of more than common attention  
to prevent its operating feverely or oppreflively.  
  
The 43d feétion of the act contains a f{pecial provifion (and one which at is  
believed is not to be found in any law enacted in this country prior to the pre-  
fent conttitution of the united ftates) by which forfeitures and penalties, incurred  
without an intention of fraud or wilful negligence, may be mitigated or re-  
mitted.  
  
This mild and equitable provifion is an eff:ftual guard againf fuffering or  
inconvenience in confequence of undefigned trantgrefhions of the law.  
  
The 38th feétion contains a provifion in favour of perfons, whe, though in-  
mnocent, may accidentally fuffer by feizures of their property (as in the execu.  
tion of the revenue laws fometimes unavoidably happens) which is perhaps en-  
tirely peculiar to the law under confideration. Where there has even been a  
probable caufe of feizure, fufficient to acquit an officer, the jury are to affefs  
whatever damages may have accrued, from auy injury to the article teized, with  
an allowance for the detention of it, at the rate of fix per centum per annum of  
the value, which damages are to be paid out of oe public treaiury.  
  
There are other provilions of the aét, which mark the fcrupulous attention of  
the government, to protect the parties concermec, trom inconvenience and in-  
jury, and which con{pire to vindicate the law from imputations of feverity or  
oppreffion,  
  
‘The fuppofed tendency of the a&amp; to injure indufry, and interfere with the  
bufinefs of diftilling, is endeavoured to be tupported by fome general and fome  
{pecial reafons; both having relation to the effect of the duty upon the manu-  
facture.  
  
Thofe of the firft kind affirm generally, that duties on home manufaQures are  
smpolitic, becaufe they tend to difcourage them ; that they are particularly fo,  
when they are laid on articles manuia€tured from the produce of the country,  
becaufe they have then the additional effect of injuring agriculture; that it is  
the general policy of nations to proteét an promote their own manufactures ;  
efpeciallythofe which are wrought out of domeftic materials ; that the law in  
quettion interferes with this policy.  
  
Obfervations of this kind admit of an eafy anfwer. Duties on manufaétures  
tend to difcourage them or not, according to the circumftances under which they  
are laid, and are impolitic or not, according to the fame circumfiances. When  
a manufacture is in its infancy, itis impolitic to tax it; becaufe the tax would  
be both unprodudtive, and would add to the difficulties, which naturalJy im-  
pede the firft attempts to eftablith a new manufacture; fo as to endanger its  
fuccels.  
  
But when a manufacture (as ig the cafe of diftilled {pirits in the united ftates)  
is arrived at maturity, it is as fit™an article of taxation as any other, No good  
reafon can be afligned, why the confumer of a domettic commodity fhould not  
contribute fomething to the public revenue, when the confumer of a foreign  
commodity contributes to it largely. And as a general rule, it is not to be dif-  
puted, that duties on articles of coniumption are paid by the confumers.  
  
To the manufacture itlelf the duty is no injury, if an equal duty be laid  
en the rival foreign article. And when a greater duty is laid upon the latter,  
than upon the former, as in the prefent inftance, the difference is a bounty on  
the domeftic article, and operates as an encouragement of the manufacture. The  
manufaéturer can afford to fell his fabric the cheaper, in proportion to that dif-  
— and is fo far enabled to underfell and fupplant the dealer in the foreiga  
arucie,  
  
  
  
Part 1.1 Report of the fecretary of the treafury on the excife law. *67  
  
The principle of the objeétion would tend to confine all taxes to imported ar-  
ticles, and would deprive the government of refources which are indifpenfible  
to a due provifion for the public fafety and welfare ; contrary to the plain intens  
tion of the conftitution, which gives exprefs power toeinploy thofe refources when  
neceflary ; a power which is found in ail governments, and is effenticl to their  
efficiency, and even to their exiitence.  
  
Duties on articles of internal produ&amp;tion and manufa&amp;ture, form in every  
country the principal fources of revenue. ‘Thofe on impoited articles can only  
be carried to a certain extent, without defeating their objeét; by operating  
either as prohibitions, or as bounties ypon fmuggling. They are, moreover, in  
fome degree temporary; for as the growth of manufactures dimin thes the  
quantum of duty on imports, the public revenue, ceafing to avile from that  
fource, muft be derived from articles which the national induitry has fubftituted  
for thofe previoufly imported. If the government cannot chen refort to internal  
means for the additional fupplics, which the exigencies of every nation cail for,  
it will be unable to perform its duty, or even to pretirve its exittence,  
The community muft be unprotected, and the iccial compct be dif-  
folved.  
  
For the fame reafons that a duty ought not to be laid on an article manufactured  
out of the produce of the country (whichis the point moft infilted upon) it ought  
pot to be laid upon the produce itfelf, nor confequently upon the land, which is the  
inftrument of that produce; becaule taxes are laid upon land as the fund out cf  
which the income of the proprietor is drawn, or, in other words, on account cf  
its produce. There ought, therefore, on the principle of the objeétion, to be nei-  
ther taxes on land nor on the produce of land, nor on articles manufaétured  
from that produce. And if a nation fhould be in a condition to fupply  
itfelf, with its own manufactures, there could then be very little or no revenue 5  
of courfe there muft be a want of the elential means of national jultice and na-  
tional fecurity.  
  
Pofitions like thefe, however well meant by thofe who urge them, refute them-  
felves : becaufe they tend to the diffulution of government, by rendering it inca-  
pable of providing for the objeéts for which it was inftituted.  
  
However true the allegation, that it 1s and ought to be the prevailing policy  
“ of nations to cherifh their own manufactures, it is equally true, that nations in  
general lay duties for the purpofe of revenue, on their own manufactures ; and  
it is obvious to a demonitration, that it&#x27;may be done without injury to them.  
The moft fuccefsful nations in manufa&amp;ures have drawn the largeft revenues  
from the moft ufeful of them. It merits particular ettention, that ardent {pis  
rits are an article, which has been generally deemed and made ule of, as one of  
the fitteft objects of revenue, and to an extent in other countries, which bears  
no comparifon with what has been done in the united {tates.  
  
The f{pecial reafons alluded to, are of different kinds.—  
  
1. [tis faid, that the a&amp; in queftion, by lrying a fmaller additional duty on  
f.reign fpirits, than the duty on home-made ipiits, has a tendency to difcourage  
the manufacture of the latter. ; 7  
  
This objection me. its confideration, and, as far as it may Sppear to have foun.  
dation, ought to be obviated.  
  
The point, however, feems not to have been viewe} in all refpects i

prefent difference in the duties on foreign and home-made {pirits. If to this be  
added the effect of the uniform operation ef the exifting duties throug rout the  
united ftates, it is eafy to infer, that the fituation of our own diltilleries is in the  
maia much better, as tar as they are affected by the laws, than it was previous  
to the paffing of any a&amp; of the united ftates upon the fubject. They have, there.  
fore, upon the whoie, gained materially under the fyftem which has been pur-  
fued by the national government.  
  
The fir law of the united ftates on this head, laid a duty of no more than  
eight cents per gailon on thofe of Jamaica proof. The fecond increafed the du-  
ty on foreign fpirits to twelve cents per gallon of the leweit proof, and by cer-  
tain gradations, to fifteen cents per gallon of Jamaica proof, The laft ac&amp;  
places the duty at twenty cents per gallon of the lowelt proof, and extends it by  
the like gradations, to twenty-five cents per gallon of Jamaica proof, laying  
alfo a duty of eleven cents per gallon on home-made ipirits, diftilled from for-  
eign materials of the lowelt proof, with the jike gradual extenfion to fifteen  
cents per gallon of Jamaica proof ; and a duty of nine cents per gallon on home-  
made {pirits diltiika from domettic materials of the loweft proof, with the like  
gradual extenfion to thirteen cents per gailoiw ot Jamaica proof.  
  
If the tranfition had been immedate trom the firft to the lait law, it cculd not  
have failed to have been confidered as achange in favour of our own diftilleries,  
as far asthe rate of duty is concerned. The mean duty on foreign {pirits, by  
the fir law, was ninecents: by the laft, the mean extra duty on foreign fpi-  
rits is in faét about eleven cents, as it regards fpirits diflilled from foreign mae  
terials—and about thirteen, as it regards fpirits diftilled from domeftic materi-  
als. In maki&gt;g this computation, it is ‘o be adverted to, that the four firl de-  
grees of proof, mentioned in the law, correfpond with the different kinds of  
fpirits ufually importrd, while the generality of thofe made in the united tates  
are of the lowelt clafs of proof.  
  
Spirits from domeftic materials derived a double advantage from the laft law,  
thatis, from the increafed rate of duty on foreign imported fpirits, and from a  
higher rate of duty on home-made {pirits of foreign materials.  
  
But the intervention of the fecond law has ferved to produce in fome places  
a different imprefion of the bufnefs, than would have happened without it. By  
a confiderable addition to the duties on foreign fpirits, without laying any thing  
on thofc of home manutacture, it has ferved.to give to the lait law the appear.  
ance of taking away a partof the advantages previoufly fecured tothe domettic  
diftilleries, It feems to have been overlooked, that the fecond aét ought in reality  
to be reviewed only as an intermediate flep to the arrangement finally con-  
templated by the legiflature ; and that, as partof a fyftem, it has upon the  
whole operated in favour of the national diftilleries, The thing to be confidered  
is the fubftantial exifting difference in favourof the home manufacture, as the  
law now (tands.  
  
The advantage, indeed, to the diflillation of fpirits from the produce of the  
country, arifing from the difference between the duties on fpirits diftilled  
from foreign and thofe diftilled from domeftic materials, is exclufively the work  
of the laft aét, and is an advantage which has not been properly appreciated by  
thofe diftillers of fpirits from home produce, who have complained of the law,  
as hurtful to them manufa&amp;ure.  
  
Caufes entircly foreign to the law itfelf, have alfo affifled in producing mifap-  
prehenfion, The approximation of the price of home- made Spirits to that of fore  
eign {pirits, which has of late taken place, and which is attributed to the opera-  
tion of the aét in queltion, is in a great degree owing to the circumftances, which  
  
have tended to raife the price of melailes in the Welt India market, and to an

Parti.) Report of the feeretary of the treafury on the excifelaw.  — *by  
  
extra importation of foreign {pirits, prior to the firft of July lait, to avoid the  
payment of the additional duty which then took place.  
  
It is ftated in the petrtion from Salem, that, previous to the laft a, the price  
of domettic to foreign fpirits was as one fhilling and nine-pence to three fhil-  
lings and four- pence, of the money of Maffachufetts, per gallon, and that fince  
that aét, it has become as three fhillings and three-pence to four fhilings and  
two- pence.  
  
It is evident, that a rifefrom one fhilling and nine-pence to three hhillines  
and three-pence per gallen, which would be equal to twenty cents, is not to  
be attributed wholly to a duty of eleven cents. Iudeed, if there were a con-  
currence of no other caufe, the inference would be very different from that in-  
tended to be drawn from the faé, for it would evince a profit gained to the  
diftiller, of more thau eighty per cent. on the du&#x27;y.  
  
It is however meant to be underftood, that this approximation of prices, oc-  
éafions a greater importation and.confumption of foreign and a lefs confumption  
of domeftic fpirits than formerly. Mow far this may or may not be the cafe, :he  
fecretary is not now able to fay with precifion ; but no facts have come under  
his notice officially, which ferve to authenticate the fuggettion. And it muft be  
éonfidered, as poflible, that reprefentations of this kind, are rather the effect of  
apprehenfien than of experience. It would even be not unnatural, thata confi-  
derable enhancement of the prices of the foreign article, fhould have led to a  
greater confumption of the domettic article, as the cheapelt of the two, though  
dearer itfeif than formerly.  
  
But while there is ground to believe that the fuggeftions, which have been  
made on this point, are in many refpeéts inaccurate avd mi‘conceived, there  
are kif@wn cir¢uraftances, which feem to render advileable, fome greater differ-  
ence between the duties on foreign and on home made {pirits. ‘Thefe cireums  
ftances have been noticed in the report of the fecretary on the fubject of manu.  
faétures ; and an alteration has been propofed by luying two certs in addition  
upon imported fpirits of the loweft proof, with a propert onal inerevie on the  
higher proofs, and by deduéting one cent from the duty on the lowelt proof  
of home-made {pirits, with a proportional diminution in refpeét to the higher  
proofs.  
  
This alteration would bring the proportion of the duties nearly to the ftand-  
ard, which the petitioner Hendrick Doyer, who appears jikely to be wii! in-  
formed on the fubdje&amp;, repreients as the proper one to enable the diduisnon of  
geneva tobe carried on with the fsme advantage as before the polling ot the  
aé. He obferves, that the duty on home made geneva being mine cevts, the ad-~  
ditional duty on foreign ought to have been twelve cents. By the aterction  
propoled, the proportion will be as ten to eight, which is little Giff. ence to  
that of twelve to nine.  
  
It is worthy of remark, that the fame petitioner ftotes, that previous to the  
pafling of the a&amp;, of which he complains, he ‘* coula fell his geneva fixteen and  
one fourth per cent. under the priceot Holland geneva, but that he cannot do  
it at prefent, and in future, lower than fourteen per cent.”’ It, as he alfo Rates,  
the quality of his geneva be equal to that of Holland, and it his meaning be,  
as it appears to be, that he can now afford to fell his geneva lower by fourteen  
per cent. than the geneva of Holland, it wiil follow, that the manufacture of  
that article is in a very thriving train, even under the preent rate of duties.  
For a difference of fourteen per cent. in the price, is capable of giving a dee  
cided preierence to the fale of the domettic article.  
  
If. It is objected, that the duty, by being laid in the fir inttance upon the  
diftiller, inftead of the confumer, makes a large capital neceflary to carry om

the bufinefs; and in this country, where capitals are not large, puts the national  
diftiliers under difadvantages.  
  
But this inconvenience, as far as it has foundation, in the ftate of things, is  
effentially obviated by the credits given. Where the duty is payable upon the  
quantity diftilled, a credit is allowed, which cannet be lefs than fix, and may  
extend to nine months. Where the duty is charged on the capacity of the  
ftill, it is payable half yearly. Sufficient time is therefore allowed to raife the  
duty from the fale of the article, which fuperfedes the neceffity of a greater  
capital. It is well known, that the article is one ufually fold for cath, or at fhort  
credit. If thefe obfervations are not applicable to diftilleries in the interior  
country, the fame may be faid in a great degree of the objeétion itfelf. The  
couife of the bufine{s in that quarter, renders a confiderable capital lefs necef-  
fary than elfewhere, The produce of the diftiller’s own farm, or of the neigh.  
bouving farms, brought to be diftilled upon fhares or compenfations in the ar-  
ticle itielf, conflitute the chief bufinefs of the diftilleries in the remote parts of  
the country. In the comparatively few inftances, in which they may be pro-  
fecuted as a regular bufinefs, upon a large feale, by force of capital, the obfer-  
vations, which hove been made, will fubftantially apply.  
  
Tie colie&amp;tion of the duty from thediftiller has, on the other hand, feveral  
advantages. It contributes to equality, by charging the article, in the firft ttage  
of its progrefs, which diffufes the duty among ail claffes alike. It the better  
fecures the c }lestion of the revenue, by confining the refponfibility toa fmaller  
nuaiber of perfons, and fimplifying the procefs. And it avoids the neceflity of  
fo grea: a number of officers, as would be required in a more diffufe fyftem of  
colleétion, operating immediately upon purchafers and confumers. Befides, that  
the latter plan would transfer whatever inconveniencies may be inciden#to the  
cclie&amp;ion, from afmalier to a greater number of perfons.  
  
III. It is alleged, that the infpe&amp;tion of the officers is injurious to the bufi-  
nels of diftiliing, by laying open its fecrets or myfteries.  
  
Different diftiiters, there is no doubt, praétife, in certain refpe&amp;ts, different  
methods ia the courfe of their bufinefs, and have different degrees of {kill.  
But it may well be doubted whether in a bufinefs fo old and fo much diffuled  
as that of the diftillation of (pirits, there are at this day fecrets of confequence  
to the poll flors.  
  
There will at leaft be no hazard in taking it for granted, that none fuch ex.  
it in regard to the difillation of rum from melafles or fugar, or of the fpi-  
rits from grain ufually called whitkey, or of brandies from the fruits of this  
country. The cafes, in which the allegations are made with moft colour,  
apply to geneva and perhaps to certain cordials.  
  
It is probable, that the courfe of the bufinefs might and would always be  
fuch, as in fa&amp; to involve no inconvenience on this icore. But as the contra-  
ry is affirmed, and as it is defirable to obviate complaint as far as it can be  
done, confiftently witheffential principles and objeéts, it may not be unadvifeable  
to attempt a remedy.  
  
It is to be prefumed, thatif any fecrets exift, they relate to a primary procefs,  
particula:ly the mixture of the ingredients; this, itis fuppofable, cannot take a  
greater time in each day, than two hours. If, therefore, the officers of infpec-  
tion were enjoined to forbear their vifits to the part of the diftillery commonly  
made ule of for fuch procets, during a fpace not exceeding two hours each day,  
to be notified by the dilliller, there is ground to conclude that it would obviate  
the objeétion. ;

verted to: but there is a lightin which it is made, that has not yet been taken  
notice of.  
  
It is faid, that the requiring the doors of the apartments as well as the outer  
door of each building to be marked, impofes unneceflary trouble.  
  
When it is confidered how little trouble or expenfe attends the execution  
of this provifion, in the firft inftance, and that the maiks, once tet, will  
endure for a great length of time, the abjeGtion to it appears to be witavut  
weight.  
  
But the provifion, as it relates to the apartments of buildings, has for its  
immediate objeét the convenience of the diltillers themfelves. It is calculated  
to avoid the very evil of an indifcriminate fearch of their houfes and buildings,  
by enabling them to defignate the particular apartments which are empioyed  
for the purpofe of their bufinefs, and to fecure all others from infpection and  
vifitation.  
  
The complaint, as it refpeé&amp;ts the marking of cafks and veffels, has fomewhat  
more foundation. It is reprefented (and upon careful enquiry appears to be  
true) that through long-eftablifhed prejudice, home-made {pirits, of equal quae  
lity with foreign, if known to be home-made, will not command an equal  
price. This particularly applies to geneva.  
  
If the want of a diftin&amp;tion between foreign and home-made {pirits were aw  
eccafion of fraud upon confumers, by impofing a worfe for a better commodity,  
it would be a reafon for continuing it; but as far as fuch a diftingétion gives  
operation to a mere prejudice favourable to a foreign, and injurious to a domef-  
tic manufacture, it furnifhes a reafon for abolithing it.  
  
Though time might be expected to remove the prejudice, the progrefs of the  
domeltic manufaéture, in the interval, might be materially checked.  
  
It appears, therefore, expedient to remove this ground of complaint by au-  
thorifing the fame marks and certificates, both for foreign and for home made  
geneva.  
  
Perhaps, indeed, it may not be unadvifeable to veft fomewhere a difcretionary  
power to regulate the forms of certificates, which are to accompany, and the  
particular marks, which are to be fet upon cafks and veffels containing fpirits  
generally, as may be found convenient in practice,  
  
Another fource of objeétion, with regard to the marking of catks is, that there  
is a general prohibition againit defacing or altering the marks, and a penalty up-  
on doing it, which prevents the ufing of the fame cafks more than once, aud oce  
eafions watte, lofs, and embarraffment.  
  
It is conceived, that this prohibj:ion does not extend to the effacing of old  
marks and placing of new ones by the officers of the revenue, or in the sr elenee  
and by their authority. But as real inconveniencies would attend a contrary  
conftruction, and there is fome room for queftion, it appears defivable that ail  
doubt fhould be removed, by an explicit provilion to enabie the officer to efface  
old marks and fubftitute new ones, when cafks have been empued of their former  
contents and are wanted for aew ule.  
  
Vv. ‘The requifition to keep an account from day to day of the quantity  
of fpirits diftilled, 1s reprefented both as a hardihip and impoflibie to be comptied  
with,  
  
But the fecretary is unable to perceive that it can be ju@ly viewed either ia  
the one or in the other light. The trouble of fetting down in the evening  
the work of the day, in a book prepared for and furnithed to the party, muit  
be inconfiderable ; and the doing of it would even conduce to accuracy in bu  
  
finefs.  
  
The idea of impracticability muft have arifea from fome mifconception. It  
Gs ty invgve a fuppoiition, that fomething is required diifexent from the

trush of the fa&amp;t. Spirits diftilied are ufually diftinguifhed into high wines,  
proof fpirits, and low wines. It is certainly poffible to exprefs, each day, the  
guintity of each kind produced ; and, where one kind is converted into ano.  
ther, to explain it by brief notes, fhowing in proper colunns the refults in thofe  
kinds of fpirits which are ultimately prepared for fale,  
  
A revifion is now meking of the forms at firft tranfmitted ; and it is not  
doubted, that it will be eafy to obviate the obje&amp;tion of impraéticability.  
  
On full reflexion the fecretary is of opinion, that the requifition in this re.  
fpeét is a veafonable one, and that it is of importance te the due colleétion of  
the revenue, efpecially in thofe cafes, where, by the alternative allowed in favour  
of country ditilleries, the oath of 2 party is the only evidence of the quantity  
produced. Itis ufetal in every (uch cate to give the utmoft poffible precifion to  
the obje&amp; which is to be artefted.  
  
Vi. It is alleged as a hardthip, that diftillers are held refponfible for the du-  
ties on fpirit. which are exported, till certain things, difficult to be performed,  
are done, in order to entitle the exporter to the drawback.  
  
This is a mifapprehenfion. The drawback is, at all events, to be paid in fix  
months, which is as early as the duty can become payable, and frequently  
earlier than it does become payable. And the government relies on the bond  
of the exporter, for a fuifilmeat of the conditions upon which the drawback is  
allowed.  
  
An explanation to the feveral colleftors of this point, which has taken place  
fince the complaint appeared, will have removed the caufe of it.  
  
The fame explanation will obviate another objeétion, founded on the fuppofition  
that the bond of the diftiller and that of the exporter are for a like purpofe. The  
Jatter is merely to fecure the landing of the goods in a foreign country, and wil!  
often continue depending after every thing relative to duty and drawback has been  
liquidated and finifhed.  
  
VII. It is an article of complaint, that no drawback is allowed in cafe of  
fhipwreck, when (pirits are fent from one port to another in the united ftates,  
  
There does not occur any objection to ‘a provifion for making an allowance  
of that kind, which would tend to alleviate misfortune, and give fatisfa&amp;ion.  
  
VIII. The neceflity of twenty four hours notice, in order to the benefit of  
drawback on the exportation of fpirits, and the prohibition to remove them  
from a diftillery after funfet, except in the prefence of an officer, are reprefented  
as embarrafiments to bufinefs. *  
  
The length of notice required appears greater than is neceflary. It is not  
perceived, that any inconvenience would arife, from reducing the time to fix  
hours.  
  
But it is not conceived to be neceffary or expedient, to make an alteration  
in the laft mentioned particular, The prohibition is of real confequence to the  
fecurity of the revenue. The courfe of bufinefs will rexdily adapt itfelf to it;  
and the prefence of an officer in extraordinary cafes will afford due accommo.  
dation.  
  
IX. It is tated as a hardthip, that there is no allowance for leakage and  
waftage in the cv’e of fpirits thipped f-om one ftate to another.  
  
The Jaw for the collection of the duties on imports and tonnage allows two  
per cent. for lerkage on {pirits imported. A fimilar allowance on home-made  
{pirits at the diftilery, does not appear lef. proper.

with forety for the amount of the duties, and that the tuffix iency of the furety

credit. It is a natural confequence of the credit allowed ; and a very reafonable  
condition of the indulgence, which, without this precaution, might be impru-  
dent, and injorious to the united ftates.  
  
The party bas his option to avoid it by prompt payment of the duty, and is  
even entitled to an abatement, which may be confidered as a premium, if he  
elects to do fo.  
  
As to the fecond point, if fureties are to be given, there muft be fome  
peion on the part of the government, to judge of their fufficiency, other-  
wiie the thing itfelf would be nugatory: and the difcretion cannot be velted  
more conveniently for the party, than in the chief officer of infpe€tion for the  
furvey.  
  
A view has now been taken of moft, if not of all, the objections of a gene-  
rai nature, which have appeared.  
  
So.ne few of a local complexion remain to be attended to.  
  
The repreientation figned Edward Cook, chairman, as on behalf of the four  
moft weftern counties of Pennfylvania, ftates, that the diltance of that part of  
the country from a market for its produce, leads to a neceflity of diftilling the  
grain, which is raifed, as a principal dependence of its inhabitants; which cir-  
cumitance and the tcareity of cafh combine to render the tax in queftion unes  
qual, oppreffive, and particularly dittrefling to them.  
 Asto the circumitince of equality, it may fafely be affirmed to be impraAi-  
eabie to devife a t.x which thal) opevaie with exaét equality upon every part of  
the community. Loca! and other circumftances will inevitably create difpavities  
more or lefs great.  
  
Taxcs upon confumable articles have, upon the whole, better pretenfions to  
equality than any other. If fone of them fall more heavily on particular parts  
of the community, others are chiefly borne by other parts. And the refult is  
an equalization of the burden as far as is attainable. Of this clafs of taxes it is  
not ealy to conceive one which can operate with greater equality than a tax on  
diftilied {pirits, There appears to be no article, as far as the information of the  
fecretary goes, which is an object of more equal confumption throughout the  
united ftates.  
  
In particular difriéts, a greater ufe of cyder may occafion a finaller confumpe  
tion of fpirits; but it will not be found, on a clofe examination, that it makes  
a material difference. A greater or lefs ufe of ardent {pirits, as far as it exifts,  
feems to depend more on relative habits of fobriety or intemperance than on  
any other caufe.  
  
As far as habits of lefs moderation, in the ufe of diftilled fpirits, fhould pro-  
duce inequality any where, it would certiinly not be a reafon wi. the legifla-  
  
ture either to repeal! or leflen a tax, which, by rendering the article deaer, might  
tend to reftrain too free an indulgence of fuch habits.  
  
It is certainly not obvious how this tax can operate particularly unequally  
upon the part of the country in queftion. As a general rule, it is a true one,  
that duties on articles of confumption fall on the confumers, by being added  
  
to the price of the commodity. This is illuftrated in the prefent inftance by  
fa&amp;ts. Previous to the law laying a duty on home-made {pirits, the price of  
whitkey was about thirty eight cents; it is now about fifty-fix cents. Other  
caufes may have contribured in fome degree to this effect, but it is evidently to  
be afcribed chiefly to the duty.  
  
Unlefs, therefore, the inhabitants of the counties which have been mentioned,  
are greater confumers of {pirits than thofe of other parts of the country, they  
cannot pay a greater proportion of the tax. If they are, it is their interef to  
  
become lefs fo. It depends on themfelves, by dimiuithing the conlumption, tg  
reftore equality,  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
s” Report of the fecretary of the treafury on the excife law. {1792  
  
The argument, that they are obliged to convert their grain into fpirits, in  
  
erder to tranfportation to diftant markets, does not prove the pointalleged. The ©  
  
duty on all they fend to thole markets, will be paid by the purchalers. They  
will (till pay’only upon their own confumption.  
  
As far as an advance is laid upon the duty, or as far as the difference of  
duty between whifkey and other fpirits tends to favour a greater coufumption of  
the latter, they, as greater manufaturers of the article, {uppofing this fact to  
be as flated, will be proportionably benefited.  
  
The duty on home-made fpirits from domeftic materials, if paid by the gal-  
Jon, is nine cents. From the communications which have been received, fince the  
palling of the act, it appears, that paying the rate annexed to the capacity of the  
itill, and ufing great diligence, the duty may bein faé reduced to fix cents per  
gallon. Let the average be taken at feven and a half cents, whichis probably  
higher than is really paid.  
  
Generally fpeaking, then, forevery gallon of whifkey which is confumed, the  
eonfumer may be fuppofed to pay feven and a half cents : but for every gallon  
of fpirits, diltilled from foreign materials, the confumer pays at leatt eleven  
eents, and for every gallon of foreign {pirits, at leait twenty cents. The con.  
fuer, therefore, of foreign {pirits, pays nearly three times the duty, and the  
eonfumer of home-made fpirits from foreign materials nearly fiity per cent.  
more duty, onthe fame quantity, than the confumer of {pirits from domettic  
materials, exclufive of ths greater price, in both cafes, which is an additional  
charge upon each of the two firft mentioned clafies of confumers. ;  
  
When it is confidered that 8-a1 parts of the whole quantity of fpirits con.  
fuined in the united fates are foreign, and 7-21 parts are of foreign materials,  
and that the inhabitants of the Atlantic and mid-land countries are the princi«  
pl confumers of thefe more highly taxed articles, it cannot be inferred, that  
the tax under confideration bears particularly hard on the inhabitants of the  
weltern country. °  
  
This may ferve as an exemplification of a general propofition of material  
eonfequence, namely, that, if the former defcripiions of citizens are able, from  
fituation, to obtain more for their produce than the latter, they contribute  
proportionally more to the revenue. Numerous other examples in confirmation  
of this might be adduced.  
  
As to the circumiance of the fcarcity of money, as faras it can be fuppofed  
to have foundation, it is as much an objeétion to any other tax, as to the one  
in queftion. ‘The weight of the tax is not certainly fuch as to involve any pe-  
euliar difficulty. Itisimpeffible to conceive that nine cents per gallon on dif-  
tilled {pirits, which is ftating it at the higheft, can, from the magnitude of the  
tax, diftrefs any part of the country, which has an ability to pay taxes at all,  
enjoying teo the unexampled advantage of a total exemption from taxes on  
houfes, lands, or flock.  
  
The population of the unite! ftates being about four millions of perfons, and  
the quantity of {pirits annually confumed, between ten and eleven millions of  
gallons, the yearly proportion to each family, if confitting of fix perfons, which  
is a full :atio, would be about fixteen gallons, the duty upon which would be  
lefs than one dollar and a half. The citizen, who is able to maintain a family,  
and who is the owner or occupies of a farm, cannot feel any inconvenience  
from {tu light a contribution, and the induftrious poor, whether artizans  
er labourers are ufually allowed {pirits, or an equivalent, in addition to their  
wages.  
  
The fecretary has no evidenceto fatisfy his mind, that a real {carcity of mo-  
ney will be found, on experiment, a ferious impediment to the payment of the  
vax any where, In the quarter where this complaint has particylarly prevaileds

the expenditures for the defence of the frontier would feem alone fufficient te  
obviate it, To this it is anfwered, that the contragtors for the fupply of the  
army operate with goods and not with money: but this ftill tends to keep at  
home whatever money finds its way there. Nor is it a fact, if the information  
of the fecretary be not materially erroneous, that the purchafes of the con-  
traétors of flour, meat, &amp;c. are wholly with goods. But if they were, the fe-  
cretary can aver, that more money has, in the courfe of the lait year, been feat  
into the weftern eeuntry from the treafury, m fpecie, and bank bills wiick  
anfwer the fame purpofe, for the pay of the troops and militia, and for quarters  
mafters’ fupplies, than the whole amount of the tax, in the four weftera coun-  
ties of Pennfylvania and the diftri&amp; of Kentucky, is likely to equal in four or  
five years. Similar reinittances are likely to be made in future.  
  
Hence the government itfelf furnifhes, and in all probability wilicontinue to  
furmth, the means of paying its own demands, with a fwrplus, which will  
fenfibly fotter the indultry of the parties concerned, it they avail themicives of  
it, under the guidance of a [pirit of economy and exertion.  
  
Whither there be no part of the united fates, is which the objection of want  
of money may truly exift, in a degree torender the payment of the duty fert-  
oufly diftrefiing to the inhabitants, the fecretary is not ableto pronounce. He  
can only expreis his gwn doubt of the faét, and refer the matter to fuch informas  
tion as the members of any diftrict fo fituated, may have it in their power to  
offer to the legiflative body.  
  
Should the cafe appear to exit, it would involve the neceffity of a mea-  
fure in the abftra&amp;t very ineligible, that is, the receipt of the duty in the article  
itielf.  
  
If an alternative of this fort were to be allowed, it would be proper to make  
it the duty of the party paying, to deliver the article at the place in each county  
where the office of infpeétion is kept, and to regulate the price according to tuck  
a ftandard, as would induce a preference of paying in csfh, except from areal  
impracticabuity of obtaining it.  
  
In regard to the petition from the diftri&amp; of Kentucky, after what has heen  
faid with reference to other applications, it can only be neceflary to obferve,  
that the exemption which is fought by that petition, is rendered impractica-  
ble by an expreis provifion of the conftitution, which deciares, that ail dutics,  
impolts, and excifes fhall be uniform throughout the united ftates.  
  
In the courfe of the foregoing examination of the objeétions which have  
been made to the law, foie alterations have been fubmitted tor the purpole of  
  
“removing a pertof them. The fecretary will sow proceed to fubmit fuch far-  
ther alterations as appear to him advileable, arifine cither from the fuggettions  
et the officers ef the revenue, or from his own reflexions.  
  
I. It appears expedient to aiter the diftingtion re(pecting diftilleries from do-  
meitic materials in cities, towns, and villages, fo as to confine it to one or  
more {tills worked at the fame diltillery, the capacity or capacities of which to-  
gether do not fail fhort of four hundred gallons.  
  
The effectual execution of the prefent previlions refpeSing diftdleries from  
home materials, in cities, towns, and villages, would occalion an inconvenient  
multiplication of officers, and would, in too great a degree, exhanit the product  
et che duty in the expent:of collection, It is alia probabie, chat the alteration  
fuggefted would conduce te public fatisfaction.  
  
ll. The prefent provihoms cencerning the entering of ftiils are found by  
experience not to be adequate, and in fome inflances not convenient.  
  
It appeais acvifeable, that there thall be one office of inipection for each  
pounty, with authority to the fupervifor, to eftablith more than one, if he fhall  
judge it neceflary for the accommodation of the inhabitants ; aud tit every

diftiller, or perfon having or keeping a ftill, thall be required to make entry  
of the fame, at fome office of infpeétion for the county, within a certain de-  
terminate period in each year. It will be proper alfo to enjoin upon every perfon,  
who, refiding within the county, fhall procure a ftill, or who, removing intoa  
county, fhall bring into it a ftill, within twenty days afterfuch procuring or  
removal, and before he or fhe begins to ufe the ftill, to make entry at the of-  
fice of infpeétion. Every entry, befides defcribing the ftill, thould fpecify in  
whofe pofleffion it is, and the perpofe for which it is intended, as, whether for  
fale or for ufe in diftilling ; and, in the cafe of a removal of the perfon from another  
place into the county, hall fpecify the place from which the ftiil fhall have been  
brought. A forfeiture of the ftill ought in every cafe in which an entry is  
required, to attend an omiffion to enter.  
  
‘This regulation, by fimplifying the bufinefs of entering ftilis, would render  
it ealier to comprehend and comply with what is required, would furnith the of -  
ficers with a better rule for afcertaining delinquencies, and, by avoiding to thent  
a confwevable degree of unneceffary trouble, will facilitate the retaining of pro-  
per characters in the offices of colleétors,  
  
III. Itis reprefented, that difficulties have in fome inftances arifen concern-  
ing the perfons refponfible for the duty. The apparent, not being always the  
seal proprietor, an opportunity for collufion is afforded ; and without collufion,  
the uncertainty is ftated as a fource of embarraflment. ,  
  
It alfo fometimes happens, that certain itinerant perfons, without property,  
complying with the preliminary requifitions of the law, as to entry, &amp;c. erect  
and work ftills for a time, and before a half yearly period of payment arrives,  
remove and evade the duty.  
  
It would tend to remedy thefeinconveniencies, if poffeffors and proprietors of  
fliils were made jointly and feverally liable, and if the duty were made a {pecifie  
lien on the fill itfelf; if alfo the proprietor of the land, upon which any ftiil  
may be worked, fhould be made anfwerable for the duty, except where it is  
woiked by a lawful and bona fide tenant of the land of an eftate, not jels than  
for aterm of ene year, or unlefs fuch proprietor can make it appear, that the  
pofleffor of the ftili was, during the whole time, without his privity or conni-  
vance, an intruder or tre{pafler on the land ; and if, in the laft place, any dif-  
tiller, about to remove from the divifion in which he is, fhould be required,  
previous to fuch removal, to pay the tax for the year, deduéting any prior pay-  
ments, or give bond, with approved furety, conditioned for the payment of the  
full fum for which he or the fhould be legally accountable, to the end of the  
year, to the colleétor of the divifton to which the removal fhall be, rendering  
proof thereof under the hand of the faid colie&amp;tor, within fix months after the  
expiration of the year.  
  
As well with a view te the forfeiture of the fills for non-entry, as to give  
effect to a {pecific lien of the duty (if either or both of thefe provifions thould  
be deemed eligible) it will be neceflary to enjoin it upon the officers of the re-  
venue, to identify by proper marks the feveral ftills which fhall have been en  
tered with them.  
  
IV. The exemptions granted to ftills of the capacity of fifty gallons and un-  
der, by the 36th fection of the law, appear from experience’to require revifion.  
Tending to produce inequality, as well as to fruftrate the revenue, they have  
excited complaint. It appears at leaft advifeable, that the obligation to enter,  
as conneSted with that of paying duty, fhould extend to ftils of all dimen-  
fons, and that it thould be enforced in every cafe by the fame penalty.  
  
V. The 28th feétion of the a&amp; makes provifion for the feizure of fpirits un-  
accompanied with marks and certificates in the cafes in which they are required 5

but as they are required. orly in certain cafes, and there is no method of diftia-  
guifhing the fpirits, in refpect to which they are neceffary, from thofe in refpect  
to which they are not neceflary, the provifion becomes nugatory, becaufe an  
attempt to enforce it wouk! be oppveffive. Hence not only a great iecurity for  
the due execution of the jaw is loft, but seizures very diftreffing to unoffending  
individuals muft happen, notwithftanding great preciution to avoid them.  
  
It would be, in the opinion of the feeretary, of great importance to provide  
that all {pirits whatever, in catks or viffels of the capacity of twenty gsllons  
and upwards, fhould be maiked and certified, on pain of fiizure and forfeiture,  
‘making it the duty of the officers to furnith the requifite certificates g:atis  
to diftillers and dealers, in all cafes, in which the!) hail have been complied  
with.  
  
In thofe cafes in which an occafional recu:rence to the officers far certificates  
might he inconvenient, blanks may be furnithed, to be accounted for. And it  
may be left to the parties themielves, in the like cafes, to mark their own cufks  
or veflels in fome fimple manner, to be defined in the law. Thete cafes may be  
defignated generally. They will principally relate to dealers, who in the courfe  
of their bufinefs dvaw off {pirits from larger to {nialler cafks, and to diflillers  
who pay according to the capacities of their ftills.  
  
As apart of a regulation of this fort, it will be neceflary to require, that with ~  
in a certain period, fufficiently long to admit of time to know and comply  
with the provifion, eatry thal] be made, by all dealers and diftillers, of all ipis  
rits in their refpective poficfiions, which fhall not have been previoufly maked  
and certified according to law, in order that they may be marked and certific  
as old flock.  
  
Tae regulations here propo ed, though produ&amp;tive of fome trouble and incon-  
venience in the outfet, will be afterwards a fecurity both to indivaluais and to  
the revenue.  
  
VI. At prefent {pirits may not be imported from abroad in cafks of lefs c2-  
pacity than fifty gallons. The fize of thefe catks is fmaller than is defirable, fo  
far as the fecurity of the revenue Js concerned ; and there has not occurred any  
good obje&amp;iion to confining the importation to larger czfks, that is to fay, to  
cafks of not lefs than ninety gallons, Certainly as far as refpects rum from the  
Weft. Indies it may be done without inconvenience, being conformable to the ge-  
neral courfe of bufinefs. The refult of examination is, that the exception, as to  
this particuiar, in favour of gin, may be abolifhed. Should any alteration on this  
fubject take place, it ought not to begin to operate till after the expiration of  
year.  
  
ViI. There is ground to fuppofe that the allowance of drawback without  
any limitation as to quantity has been abufed. It is fubmitted that none be  
made on any lefs quantity than one hundred and fiity gallons.  
  
VIII, There is danger that facility may be given to illicit importations, by  
making ule of cafks which have been once regularly marked, and the certifi-  
cates which have been iffued with them to cover other {pirits than thofe crigi«  
nally contained in fuch caiks. Appearances which countenance fufpicion on this  
point, have been the fubjests of repre‘entation from feveral quarters.  
  
The danger may be obviated by prohibiting the importation in {uch marked  
cafks on pain of forfeiture, both of the fpirits and of any fhip or veffelin which  
they may be brought. A prohibition of this fort does not appear liable to any  
good objection.  
  
{X. The duty of fixty cents per gallon of the ¢apacity of a ftill was founded  
upon a computation, that a fill of any given dimen fions wo: ked jour months in  
the year, which is the ulual period of country diflillation, would yield a quanti-  
ty of fpirits, which, at the rate of nine cents per gallon, would corve!pond with

fixty cents per gallon, of the capacity of the ftill. It will deferve confideration,  
whether it will not be expedient to give an option to country diftillers, at the  
annual entry of their fills, to take out a licence for any portion of the year,  
which they may refpeétively think fit, and to pay at the rate of 124 cents per  
galon of the capacity per month, during fuch period. This to ftxnd in lieu of  
the alternative of paying by the gallon diftilled. It would obviate in this cafe  
the neceffi:y of accounting upon oeth, and would leave it in the power of each  
dift ler to cover the precile time he meant to work his ftill with a licence, and  
pay for that time only. A ftri&amp; prohibition to diftill at any other time,  
then that for w ich the lcence was given, would be of courfe neceflary to ac-  
company the regulation as tar as regarded any fuch licenfed diftiller.  
  
The only remaining poimts which hove occurred, as proper to be fub-  
mitted to the confideration of the legiflature, refpeéts the officers of the re-  
Venue,  
  
It is reprefented, that in fome inftances, from the ill-humour of individuals,  
the officers lave experienced much embarrafiment, in refpeét to the filling of  
fiiils with water, to afcertain their capacity, which upon examination is found  
the moft fimple and praGticable mode. The proprietors have, in fome inftances,  
net only retufed to aid the officers, but have even put out of their way the  
means by which the filling might be conveniently accompli fhed.  
  
It would conduce to the eafy execution of the law, and tothe very important  
purpote of retaining and procaring refpectable charagters as colleMors, if the  
proprietors and poff flors of (lills were required to aid them in the execution of  
this part of their duty, or to pay a certain fum as a compenfation for the doing  
of it.  
  
The limits affigned in the law refpefting compenfations are found in prac-  
tice eflentially inadequate to the ofjedt.  
  
This is fo far the cafe, that it becomes the duty of the fecretary to fate,  
that greater latitude inthis particular 1s indifpenfable to the effeétual execution  
of the law.  
  
In the mof produftive divifiors, the commiffions of the colle&amp;ors afford but  
a moderate compenfaion. In the greatett part of them, the cempeniation is  
glaringly difproportioned to the fervice : in many of them, it falls materially  
thortof t&#x27;ecxpentfeof the «ficer.  
  
It is believed, that in no country whatever has the colleftion of a fimilar  
duty been cf-Sed within the limit affigned. Applying in the united fates to a  
fingle article only, and yielding contequently a lefs total produ&amp; thin when  
many articles are comprehended, the expenie of collection mult of neceflity be  
p opertion:bly greater.

All these objections were fully answered. “There can surely be  
nothing,” says Hamilton, “in the nature of an internal duty on a  
consumable commodity, more incompatible with liberty, than in  
that of an external duty on a like commodity. A doctrine that  
asserts that all duties of the former kind are inconsistent with the  
genius of a free government is too evident, and too little recon-  
cilable with the necessities of society, to be true. It would tend  
to deprive the Government of what is, in most countries, a prin-  
cipal source of revenue, and, by narrowing the distribution of  
taxes, would serve to oppress particular kinds of industry. It  
would throw, in the first instance, an undue proportion of the  
public burden on the merchant and the landholder.”

remarked, they were generally used in courts of justice. It was  
remarkable, he added, that both kinds of security to the revenue,  
provided by the Act,—the oaths of parties, and the inspection of  
offices,—found opponents. If they were both abandoned, it was  
not easy to imagine what security there could be for any species  
of revenue collected from articles of consumption.  
  
Some distillers suggested that the revenue might be more satis-  
factorily collected by having a fixed rate of duty, “adjusted ac-  
cording to a ratio compounded of the capacity of each still, and the  
number and capacities of the cisterns employed with it;” but this  
method found many objectors, who contended that it would operate  
unequally, arising from unequal supplies of the materials at different  
times. and ‘places, and also from the different methods of distilla-  
tion practiced, and from the varying degrees of activity in the busi-  
ness resulting from the capital employed. Hamilton declared that  
the result of his examination was, that every mode suggested in  
cases in which the business was conducted upon an extensive scale  
would be attended with many inequalities, and upon the whole  
would be less satisfactory than the plan which had been adopted.

on the consumer, and not on the distiller; because under the mode  
adopted a larger capital was necessary to carry on the _ business,  
and in the country, where capital was not large, distillers were placed  
at a disadvantage. This inconvenience, the Secretary replied, was ob-  
viated by the credits given to them in paying their duties. On the  
other hand, the collection of the duty from the distiller had several  
advantages. It contributed to equality by charging the article in the  
first stage of its progress, which diffused the duty among all classes  
alike. It better secured the collection of the revenue by confining  
the responsibility to a smaller number of persons, and simplifying  
the process. It avoided the necessity of so great a number of of-  
ficers as would be required in a more diffuse system of collection,  
operating immediately on purchasers and consumers. Besides, Ham-  
ilton contended, such a plan would transfer whatever inconveniences  
might be incident to the collection from a smaller to a greater num-  
ber of persons.

tually distilled, as in cities and towns, he showed, in  
reply to the former, that ‘‘ Penalties like these, for will-  
ful and fraudulent breaches of an important law, cannot  
truly be deemed either unusual or excessive ;’’ and, to  
the latter, that the duty of sixty cents per gallon on the  
capacity of stills was founded on a computation that a  
stil-of any given dimensions, worked four months in the  
year, the usual period of country distillation, would yield  
a quantity of spirits which, at the rate of nine cents per  
gallon, would correspond with sixty cents per gallon of  
capacity of the still. This was in lieu of a tax on the  
quantity distilled, aad amounted practically, he stated,  
to a gallon tax of seven and a half instead of nine cents.  
It is proper to add that this latter objection came chiefly  
from Western Pennsylvania and South Carolina.
