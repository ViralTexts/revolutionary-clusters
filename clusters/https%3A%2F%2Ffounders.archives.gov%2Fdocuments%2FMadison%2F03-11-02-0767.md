March 3, 1817  
  
Having considered the bill, this day, presented to me, entitled “An Act to set apart and pledge certain funds for internal improvements” and which sets apart and pledges funds “for constructing roads and canals, and improving the navigation of water courses, in order to facilitate, promote and give Security to internal commerce among the several States, and to render more easy and less expensive the means &amp; provisions for the common defence”; I am constrained, by the insuperable dificulty I feel in reconciling the bill with the constitution of the U. States, to return it with that objection, to the House of Representatives, in which it originated.  
The legislative powers vested in Congress are specified and  
  
enumerated in the 8th. Section of the 1st article of the constitution; and it does not appear that the powers proposed to be exercise[d] by this bill is among the enumerated powers; or that it falls by any just interpretation, within the power to make laws necessary and proper for carrying into execution those or other powers vested by the constitution in the government of the U. States.  
“The power to regulate commerce among the several States,” cannot include a power to construct roads and canals, and to improve the navigation of water courses, in order to facilitate, promote, &amp; secure such a commerce, without a latitude of construction departing from the ordinary import of terms, strengthened by the known inconveniencies which doubtless led to the grant of this remedial power to congress.  
“To refer the power in question to the clause to provide for the common defence &amp; general welfare,” would be contrary to the established and consistent rules of interpretation; as rendering the special and careful enumeration of powers, which follow the clause nugatory &amp; improper. Such a view of the constitution would have the effect of giving to Congress, a general power of legislation, instead of the defined and limited one hitherto understood to belong to them; the terms “common defence and general welfare” embracing every object and act within the purview of a legislative trust. It would have the effect of subjecting both the constitution and laws of the Several States, in all cases not specifically exempted, to be superseded by laws of Congress; it being expressly declared “that the constitution of the U. States, and laws made in pursuance thereof, shall be the supreme law of the land, and the judges of every State shall be bound thereby, anything in the constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding.” Such a view of the constitution, finally, would have the effect of excluding the judicial authority of the U. States from its participation in guarding the boundary between the legislative powers of the general &amp; State governments; inasmuch as questions relating to the general welfare, being questions of expediency &amp; policy, are unsusceptible of judicial cognizance &amp; decision.  
A restriction of the power “to provide for the common defence &amp; general welfare” to cases which are to be provided for by the expenditure of money, would still leave within the legislative power of Congress, all the great and most important measures of government; money being the ordinary and necessary means of carrying them into execution.  
If a general power to construct roads &amp; canals &amp; to improve the navigation and water courses, with the train of powers incident thereto be not possessed by Congress, the assent of the states in the mode provided in the bill cannot confer the power. The only cases in which the consent and session of particular states can extend the power of Congress, are those specified and provided for in the constitution.  
  
I am not unaware of the great importance of roads and canals, and the improved navigation of water courses; and that a power in the national legislature to provide for them might be exe[r]cised with signal advantage to the general prosperity.

other powers vested by the constitution in the government of  
the United States.  
  
“ The power to regulate commerce among the several  
states,” cannot include a power to construct roads and canals,  
and to improve the navigation of water courses, in order to faci-  
litate, promote, and secure, such a commerce, without a lati-

terms, strengthened by the known inconveniences which doubt-  
less led to the grant of this remedial power to congress. To re-  
fer the power in question to the clause “ to provide for the  
common defence and general welfare,” would be contrary to  
the established and consistent rules of interpretation; as ren-  
dering the special and careful enumeration of powers which  
follow the clause, nugatory and improper. Such a view of the  
constitution would have the effect of giving to congress a gene-  
ral power of legislation, instead of the defined and limited one  
hitherto understood to belong to them; the terms ‘ common  
defence and general welfare,” embracing every object and act  
within the purview of a legislative trust. It would have the  
effect of subjecting both the constitution and laws of the several  
states, in all cases not specifically exempted, to be superseded  
by laws of congress; it being expressly declared, “ that the  
constitution of the United States, and laws made in pursuance  
thereof, shall be the supreme law of the land, and the judges of  
every state shall be bound thereby, any thing in the constitution  
or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.” Such a  
view of the constitution, finally, would have the effect of ex-  
cluding the judicial authority of the United States from its par-  
ticipation in guarding the boundary between the legislative  
powers of the general and the state governments; inasmuch as  
questions relating to the general welfare, being questions of po-  
licy and expediency, are unsusceptible of judicial cognizance  
and decision.  
  
A restriction of the power “ to provide for the common de-  
fence and general welfare,” to cases which are to be provided  
for by the expenditure of money, would still leave within the  
legislative power of congress all the great and most important  
measures of government; money being the ordinary and neces-

rislative trust. It would have the éffect of sub-  
Jecting both the constitution and laws of the several  
States, in all cases not specifically exempted, tobe  
superseded by laws of Congress ; it being express-  
ly declared, “ that the constitution of the United  
States, and laws made in pursuance’ thereof, shall  
be the supreme law of the land, and the judges of  
every State shall be bound thereby, any’ thing in  
the constitution or laws of any State to the.contra-

tution, finaly, would have the effect of excludirir  
the judicial authority of the United States from  
its participation in guarding the boundary betweén  
the legislative powers of the general and the State  
governments ; inasmuch as questions relating to

zance and decision.  
  
A restriction of the power “to provide for the  
common defence and general welfare,” to cases  
which are to be provided for by the expenditure

tant measures of government ; money being the

If a general power to construct roads and catials,  
and to improve the navigation of water coursés,

possessed by Congress, the assent of ‘the Statés,  
in the mode provided in the bill, cannot conter the

cession of particular States can exténd the power  
of Congress, are those specified and provided for  
in the constitution.  
  
I am not unaware of the great importance ‘of  
roads and canals, and the improved navigation of  
water courses ; and that a power in the national  
legislature to provide for them, might be exercised  
with signal advantage to the general prospefity.  
But, seeing that such a power is not expressly  
given by the constitution; and believing that it  
cannot be deduced from any part of it, without an  
inadmissible lattitude of construction, and a reli-  
ance on insufficient precedents; believing also,  
that the permanent suecess of the constitution  
depends’ on a definite partition of powers between  
the general and the state governments, and that no  
adequate land-marks would be left by the can-  
structive extension of the powers of Congress, «as  
proposed in the bill, I have no option but to Wwith-  
hold my signature from it: cherishing the hope,  
that its beneficial objects may be attained, by a

internal improvements ;&quot; Tind which sets  
apart and pledges funds 44 for constructing  
&quot;roads and canals;. and - improving the na­  
vigation of -water &#x27;courses, in order to fa­  
cilitate, promote, and give security to in  
-rnmtw&#x27;ercc&#x27; anions the several  
states, and to render more easy ar.d less  
expensive the means and provisions for  
the common defence ; l am constrained  
by the insuperable difficulty I feel in re­  
conciling tite bill with the constitution of  
&#x27;the United States to return it, with that  
objection, to tnv House of Representa­  
tives, in which it originated.  
The Legislative powers vested in Con­  
gress are specified and enumerated in  
the 3th section of the first article of the  
constitution and it does net appear that  
the power, proposed to be exercised by  
the bill, is among the 5 enumerated pow­  
ers ; or that it falls, by any ju?t interpre­  
tation, within the power to nake Lws  
accessary and proper for carrying into  
execution those or other powers vested  
by the constitution in the government of  
&#x27; the United States.  
44 The power to regulate commerce  
among the several States,&quot; cannot include  
a power to construct roads and canals,  
a::d to improve the navigation of water  
courses, an order to facilitate, promote  
and secure, such a commerce, without a  
latitude of construction, departing from  
the crdr-.ary import ofthe term strength­  
ened by the kt.own inconveniences which  
doubtless led to the grant of this reme­  
dial grant to Congress. To refer the  
power in question to the clause 44 to pro-.  
vide tor the common cletence ana general  
welfare,&quot; would be contrary to the estab­  
lished and consistent rules of Interpreta­  
tion ; as rendering the special and care­  
ful enumeration of powers which follow  
the clause, nugatory and improper. Such  
a view of the constitution would have  
the eiT:ct of -giving to Congress a general  
power of legislation, instead of the defin­  
ed and limited one hitherto --.understood  
to belong to them ; the terms 44 common  
defence &quot;and general welfare,&#x27; embrac­  
ing every object and act within tin pur­  
view of a iesfislativt trust. It would  
liave the effect  
t  
t  
s;foiecthiir both die  
constitution uk! lavsot ti:e several states,  
in all cases not spec ifically exempted, to  
be superseded by laws of Congress ; it  
,Jtti-g eypiessly drclared, 44 that the con­  
stitution of the United States, and laws  
made in pursuance thereof, shall be the  
supreme law ?f the land, and the judges  
of evv.r state shall be bound thereby, any  
thing in the constitution or laws of any  
state to tlie contrary notwithstanding&#x27;  
Sue t a view of the -constitution, finally,  
woid have the effect of excluding the  
judeial authority of the LTni fed States  
fro u its -narticmatton in guardinir the  
boundan between the legislative. powers  
of file general am1 thestutegovemments ;  
inasmuch: as qi;estivnsrelatihgto the gen-&#x27;j  
ertl welfare, being questions, of policy 6c  
expediency, are unsusceptible ot judicial  
cognizance and dedsim.  
A restriction ot tlioprv.ver &quot; to provide  
Congitss, all the great and most impor­  
tant measures of government ; monev  
being the ordinary iund necessary mear.s  
of -carrying them into execution.  
If a ceneral Dowtv to construct mads &#x27;  
u . : &#x27; :  
and canals, and to improve the naviga- &#x27;  
tion of water courses, with the train of j  
powers incident thereto, be not possessed !  
by Congress, the assent of the states, v  
the nicde provided in the bill, cannot con- &#x27;

states can extend the power of Congress,

l know*  
that public assistance, granted to the  
insurgents of Spanish* America would  
compromise her relations of friendship  
not only with Spain, but with all toe  
maritime powers of the Old World,  
who are united with the tnteicats which  
the futu.e late of tl.cir colonics in­  
volve, by the uniformity of the princi­  
ples which govern them, by the analo­  
gy of the misfortunes which they bavc  
so long endured,  
--  
  
Tho following is the Message cf the  
president, transmitting to the bouse of  
re&#x27;# resentatiyes his objections io the  
hank bonus bill :  
To the house of refircaertattvea of the  
United Si acts.  
Having considered the bill this day  
presented tonic, entitled “ An act  
to set apart and pledge certain  
funds for internal improvement  
and which sets apart and pledges  
funds “ for constructing roads and  
nanals, and improving the naviga­  
tion of water courses,” in order to  
facilitate, promote, and give secu­  
rity to internal commerce among  
the several states, and to render  
more easy and less expensive the  
means and provisions for the com­  
mon defence;” I am constrained,  
by the insuperable difficulty I fee)  
in reconciling the bill with the con­  
stitution of the United States to  
return it, with that objection, to the  
house of representatives, in which  
it originated.  
The legislative powers vested in  
congress are specified and enume­  
rated in the 8th section of the fust  
article of the constitution; and it  
does not appear tl&amp;it the power,  
proposed to be exercised by the  
bill, is among tAe enumerated pow­  
ers ; or that# falls, by any just in­  
terpretation, within the power to  
make laws necessary and proper  
for carrying into execution those or  
other powers vested by the consti­  
tution ir» the government of the  
United States.  
  
“ ’he power ro regulate com­  
me^e among the several states,”  
c/iinot include a power to con­  
struct roads and canals, and to im­  
prove the navigation of water  
courses, in order to facilitate, pro­  
mote,and secure such a commerce,  
without a latitude of construction,  
departing from the ordinary import  
of the terms, strengthened by the  
known inconveniences which  
doubtless led to tfre grant of this  
remedial power to congress. To  
refer the power in question to the  
clause &quot; to provide for the com­  
mon defence and general welfare,”  
would be contrary to the establish­  
ed and consistent rules of interpre­  
tation ; as rendering the special  
and careful enumeration of pow­  
ers which follow the clause, nuga  
tory and improper. Such a view  
of the constitution would have the  
effect of giving to congress a gene­  
ral power of legislation, instead of  
the defined and limited one hither­  
to understood to belong to them ;  
the term “ common defence and  
general welfare,” embracing every  
object and act within the purview  
of a legislative trust.  
It would have,the effect of sub  
jecting both the constitution and  
laws of the several states, in all  
eases not specially exempted, to be  
superseded by laws of Congress;  
it being expressly declared, that  
the constitution of the United  
States, and laws made in pursu­  
  
t  
ance thereof, shall be the supreme  
law of the land, and the judges of  
every state shall be bound thereby,  
any thing in the constitution or  
laws of any state to the contrary  
notwithstanding ” Such a view  
of the constitution, finally, would  
have the eflect of excluding the ju­  
dicial authority of the United  
States from its participation in  
guarding the boundary between the  
legislative powers of the general and  
the state governments; inasmuch as  
questions relating to the general  
welfare, being questions of policy  
ai}d expedience , are unsusceptible  
of judicial cognziance and decision.  
A restriction of the power “ to  
provide for the common defence  
and general welfare,” to eases  
winch are to be provided for by the  
expenditure of money, would still  
leave within the legislative power  
ol Congress all the great and most  
important measures ot government;  
money being the ordinary and ne­  
cessary means of carrying them inr  
to execution.  
  
a general power to construct  
roads and canals, and to improve  
the navigation of water courses,  
with the train of powers incident  
thereto, be not possessed by Con­  
gress, the asaent of the states, in  
the mode provided in the bill can­  
not confer the power. The only  
eases in which the consent anti  
cession of particular states can ex­  
tend the power of Congress, arc  
those specified and provided for in  
Uie Constitution,  
I am not unaware of the great  
importance of roads and canals, and  
the improved navigation of water  
courses; and that a power in the  
national legislature to provide for  
them, might be exercised with sig­  
nal advantage to the gene ral pros­  
perity. But seeing that such a pow.  
er is not expressly given by the con.  
stitution ; and believing that it can­  
not be deducedjfrom any pu t of it,  
without an inadmissible latitude of  
construction, and a reliance on in­  
sufficient precedents; believing,  
also,that a permanent success of the  
constitution defends on a definite  
partition of powers between the ge­  
neral and state governments, and  
that no land marks would be left,  
by the constructive extension of the  
powers of Congress, as proposed in  
the bill, I have no option but to  
withhold my signature from it;  
cherishing the hope, that its bene­  
ficial objects may be attained, by a  
resort for the necessary powers* to  
the same wisdom and virtue in the  
nation, which established the con­  
stitution in its actual form and pro­  
vidently marked out in the instru­  
ment itself, and a safe and practica­  
ble mode of improving it. as expe­  
rience might suggest.

MR. MADISON&#x27;S OPINION.  
In 1817, a bill bad passed both Houses, to se&#x27;s  
apart and pledge, as a permanent fund for Inter+  
nal Improvements, the bonus of the Nationa}  
‘Bank, and the United State&#x27;s share of its divie  
dends. The views of Mr. Madiscen will be found  
in the followipg message. :  
Message of the President, transmitting to the House  
of Represerdutives his OBIECTIONS 10 the BANE  
BONUS BILL.  
To the House of Reprcsentatives of the U. States -  
Having considered the bill this day presented  
to me, entitled ““An Act to set apart and pledge  
certain funds for internal imprevements,” and  
which sets apart and pledges funds “for com­  
structing roads and cawals, and improving the  
navigation of water courses, in order to facilitate,  
promote and give security to internal cemmerce,  
among the several States, and to render more ea­  
sy and less expensive the means and previsions  
for the common defence;’’ lam constrained, by  
the insuperable diffieulty I feel in reconciling thes  
bill with the Constitation of the United States,  
to return it, with that ebjection, to the House of  
Representatives, in which it originated.  
The legislative powers vested in Congress aze  
specified and enumerated in the Bth section es  
the first article of the Comstitution; and it does  
et appear that the-power proposed te be exercis-.  
by the bill, is among the enumerated powers ; ox  
that it falls, by a.n{ just iaterpretation, withim  
the power to make laws neeessary and proper for:  
carying intg execution those or other powers vest-.  
ed by the Constitution in the Goverament of the  
United States. :  
“The power to regulate commerce among the  
several States’” cannot include a power to con=

nary import of the terms, sirengthened by the  
Kknown inconveniencos which doubtless led to the  
grant of this yemidal power to Congress. Tore­  
fer the power in question to the clause “to pro­  
vide for the common defence and general wel­  
tare,” would be contrary to the established and  
censistent rules of interpretation, as rendering  
the special and careful enumeration of powers  
which follows the clause nugatory and improper.  
Kuch a view es the Constitution would have the  
effect of giving to Congress a gereral power of  
Legislation, instead of the defined and limited  
one hitherto understood to beloug to them—the  
terms ‘‘the common defence and general wel­  
fare,” embracing every object and act within the  
purview of a legislative tru.t. It woyld have the  
effect of subjecting both the Constitution and  
Jaws in the several States, in all cases not specifi­  
cally exempted, to be superceded by laws of Caon­  
gress; it being expressly declared, “that the Con­  
stitution of the Uunited States, and laws made in  
pursuance thereof, shall be the supreme law of  
the land, and the Judges of every State shall be  
bound thereby, any thing in the Cosstitution or  
laws of any State to the contrary notwithstand­  
ing.” Such a view of the Constitution, finally,  
would Lave the effect of excluding the judicial  
authority of the United States from its participa­  
tion in guarding the boundary between the legis­  
lative powers of the General and the State Gov­  
ernments; inasmuch as questions relating to the  
general welfare, being quéStions of policy and ex­  
pediency, are unsusceptible of judicial cognizance  
and decision. -  
A restriction of ghe power “to provide for the  
common defence and general welfare” to cases  
which are to be provided for by the expenditure  
of money, would still leave within the legislative  
power of Congress all the great and most impor­  
tant measures of government; money being the  
ordinary and necessary means of carrying them  
into execution.  
If a general power to construct roards and ca­  
nals, to improve the navigation of water courses,  
with the train of poewers incident thereto, be not  
possessed by Congress, the assent of the States,  
in the mode provided in the bill cannet confer  
the power. The only cases in which the censent  
and cession of particular States can extend the  
power of Congsess, are those specified and pro­  
vided for in the coastitution.  
I am not unaware of the great importance of  
roads and canals, and the improved navigation  
of water courses ; and thata pewer in the nation­  
al legislature to provide for them might be exer­  
cised with signal advantage te the general pros­  
perity: But, secing that such a power is not ex­  
pressly given by the Constitutien, and believing  
that it cannot be deduced from any part of it,  
without an inadmissible latitude of construection,  
and a reliance on insufficient precedents; believ­  
ing, also, that the permanent success of the Con­  
stilution depends on a definitive partition of pow­  
ers between the Generaland State Governments,  
and that no acequate Jandmarks would be left by  
the constructive extention of the powers of Con­  
gress, as proposed in the bill, I have no option  
but to withhold my signature from it; cherish­  
ing the hope, that its beneficial objects may be  
ohtained by a resort for the necessary powers to  
the same wisdom and virtue in the nation whigh  
established the Constitution in its actual form,  
and providently marked out in the instrument it­  
self a safe and practicable mode of improving it,  
as experience mighit suggest.

The legislative powers vested in

ted in the eighth section of the first  
article of the constitution; nrid it rinpj  
not appear that the power proposed to  
be exercised by the bill, is amonq tlie

The power to regulate commerce  
among the several states canno in­  
clude a power to construct roads and  
canals, and improve the navigaticn of  
water courses, in ordr to ffacili ate.  
promote, and secure, such a com­  
merce without a latitude of jconstfuc­  
tion departing from the ordinan im­  
port of the terms, strengthened b the  
known inconveniences w hiv h Huub tless  
led to the grant of this remedial power  
to Congress. V, To refer the j. powir in  
question to the clause ; &#x27;to provide j for  
the common ; defence aiid general,  
welfare,&#x27; would be contrary to the esta­  
blished and consistent rules ofi lter-  
pretation; as rendering the special  
and careful enumeration of powers  
which follow the clause, nu era ton and  
i tiproper. Such a view of the cc nsti-  
tution would have the efTect of giving  
t Congress a general power of legis­  
luion, instead of the defined and Jlimi­  
ted one hitherto understood to be­  
lig to them- the terins, ihe coniinon  
and general welfare embracing every  
object and act within the purview of a

be the supreme law of the land, ai d the  
judges of every state shall be Lotind  
thereby, any thing in the constitution

notwithstanding. Such a view of the

effect ofexcludinsr the judicial-author-ty  
of the United States from its 3arti­  
cipation in guarding theboundary-between-;  
the legislative powers o,f the

tives of the U. States, on the %d of March, 1817.  
Having considered the bill this day presented to  
me, entitled “An act to set apart and pledge cer­  
tain funds for Internal Improvement,” and which  
sets apart and pledges funds “ for constructing roads  
and canals, and improving the navigation of water  
courses, in order to facilitate, promote and give se­  
curity to internal commerce among the several  
States, and to render more easy and less expensive,  
the means and provisions for the common defence,”  
I am constrained by the insuperable difficulty I feel  
in reconciling the bill with the constitution of the  
United States, to return it, with that objection, to the  
House of Representatives, in which it originated.  
The legislative powers vested in Congress, are  
specified and enumerated in the 8th section of the  
first article of the constitution; and it does not ap­  
pear that the power proposed to he exercised by the  
bill, is among the enumerated powers, or that it  
falls, by any just interpretation, within the power to  
make laws necessary and proper for carrying into  
execution thoso or other powers vested by the con­  
stitution in the government of the United States.  
“ The power to regulate commerce among the  
several States ” cannot include a power to construct  
roads and canals, and to improve the navigation of  
watercourses, in order to facilitate, promote and se­  
cure such commerce, without a latitude of construc­  
tion departing from the ordinary import of the terms,  
strengthened by the known inconvenience which,  
doubUess, led to the grant of this remedial power to  
Congress. To refer the power in question to the  
clause “to provide for the common defence and ge­  
neral welfare,” would he contrary to the established  
and consistent rules of interpretation, as rendering  
the special and careful enumeration of powers which  
follow the clause, nugatory and improper. Such a  
view of the construction would have the effect of  
giving to Congress a general potrer of Legislation,  
instead of the defined and limited one hitherto un­  
derstood to belong to them, the tcnim &quot; common de­  
fence and general welfaie” embracing every object  
and act within the purview of a legislative trust. It  
would have the effect of subjecting both the constitu­  
tion and laws of the several States, in all rases  
not specifically exempted, to be superseded bylaws  
of Congress; it being expressly declared, ‘that the  
Constitution of the United States, and laws iuide in  
pursuance thereof, shall be the supreme law of the  
land, and the Judges of every State shall be round  
thereby, any thing in the Constitution or laws of any  
State to the contrary notwithstanding.” Sach a  
view of the Constitution, finally, would h.&#x27;re the  
effect of excluding the Judiciary authority of lie U.  
States from its participation in guarding the bninda­  
ry between the legislative powers of the General  
and State Governments, inasmuch as questions relat­  
ing to the general welfare, being questions irf policy  
and expediency, are unsusceptible of Judicial cog­  
nizance and decision.  
A restriction of the power “ to provide for the  
common defence and general welfare,” to casts  
which are to be provided for by the expenditure of  
money, would stdl leave within the legislative pov­  
er of Congress, all the great and most important  
measures of government, money being the ordini­  
ry and necessary means cf carrying them into exa­  
cution.  
  
it a general power to construct roaus ana canals,  
and to improve the navigation of water courses, with  
the train of powers incident thereto, be not possessed  
by Congress, the assent of the States in the mode  
provided by the bill cannot confer the power. The  
oidy cases in which the consent and cession of par­  
ticular States can extend the power of Congress, are  
those specified and provided for in the Constitution.  
I am not unaware of the great importance of roads  
and canals, and the improved navigation of water  
courses; and that a power in the National legislature  
to provide for them, might be exercised with signal  
advantage to the general prosperity. But seeing  
that such a power is not expressly given by the Con­  
stitution, and believing it cannot be deduced from  
unypartof it without an inadmisible latitude of ebn­  
struction, and a reliance on insufficient precedents ;  
believing also,that the permanent success of the con­  
stitution depends on a definite partition of powers  
between the General and State governments, and  
that no adequate landmarks would be left bj the  
constructive extension of the powers of Congress as  
proposed in the bill, I have no option but to withhold  
my signature from it; cherishing the hope that its  
beneficial objects may be attained by a resort for  
the necessary power, to the same wisdom and vir­  
tue in the nation which established the Constitution  
in its actual form, and providently worked out, in  
the instrument itself, a safe and practicable mode of  
improving it as experiment might suggest.

* The message of the president, in 1814, returning  
the bank bill of that year  
MR. MADISON&#x27;S VETO.  
To the House of Representatives of the United States  
Having considered the bill this day presented to&#x27;  
me, entitled &quot;an acttoset apart and pledge certain  
funds for internal improvements;&quot; and which sets  
apart and pledges funds, &quot; for constructing roads  
and canals, and improving the navigation of water  
courses, tn order to facilitate, promote and give se­  
curity to internal commerce among the several states,  
and to render more easy and less expensive the&#x27;  
means and provisions for the common defence,&quot; I am  
constrained, by the insuperable difficulty I feel in  
reconciling the bill with the constitution of the Uni­  
ted Slates, to return it, with that objection, lo the  
?&#x27; KePresenta,ivres, in which it originated.  
The Legislative powers, vested in Congress, are  
specified and enumerated in the 8ih section of the  
first article of the Constitution ; and it does not ap­  
pear that the power, proposed lo be exercised by the  
bill, is among the enumerated powers; or that it  
falls, by any just interpretation, within the power to  
make laws necessary and proper for earning Into  
execution those or other p jwers vested by the Con­  
stitution in the government of the United States.  
I he powder to regulate commerce among the se­  
veral states,&quot; cannot include a power to construct  
roads and canals, and to improve the navigation of  
water courses, in order to facilitate, promote and se­  
cure, such a commerce, without a latitude of con­  
struction, departing from the ordinary import of the  
terms, strengthened by the known inconveniences  
which, doubtless, led to Ihe grant of this remedial  
power to Congress. To refer the power, in ques­  
tion, to the clause, &quot;to provide for the common de­  
fence and general welfare,&quot; would be contrary to the  
established and consistent rules of interpretation; as  
rendering the special and careful enumeration of  
powers,-which follow the clause, nugatory and im­  
proper. Such a view of the Constitution would  
have the effect of giving to Congress a general  
power of Legislation, instead of the defined and lim­  
ited one hitherto understood to belong to them; the  
terms &quot;common defence and general welfare &quot; em­  
bracing every object and act within the purview of a  
legislative itust. It would have the efficl of sub­  
jecting, both Ihe Constitution and laws of Ihe seve­  
ral states, in all cases not specifically exempted, to be  
superseded by laws of Congress; it being expressly  
declared, that ihe Constitution of the United  
States, and laws made in pursuance thereof shall be  
(he supreme law of the land, and the judges of every  
s ate s^.&quot;1 be bound thereby, any thing in the Con  
a? laQW\?f anv s,a,p lo &#x27;hecontrary notwith­  
sta ,d ng. Such a view of the Constitution, finally  
would have the effect of excluding the Judical au­  
thority of the United States from its panic n.iHon n  
guarding .he boundary between the Legi&#x27;lMive  
powers of the general and of ihe state gov rnments  
inasmuch as quesfons relating to the general wel­  
fare, bein^ questions of policy and exnediencv are  
unsusceptible of Judical cognizancc and decision  
  
A restriction of the power &quot;to provide for the  
common defence and general welfare,&quot; locates which  
are to be provided lor by the expenditure ol money,  
would Mill leave within the Legislative power of  
Congress all the gieat and most impoitant measure*  
of government; money being the ordinary nod ne­  
cessary means o( carrying them into execution.  
If a general power ;o construct roads and canal*,  
and to improve the navigation of water courses,  
with the train of powers incident thereto, be not pos­  
sessed by Congress, the assent of the states, in the  
mode provided by the bill, cannot confer the power.  
The only cases in which (he consent and cession of  
particular stales can extend the power of Congress  
are those specified and provided for in the constitu­  
tion.  
1 am not unaware of the great importance of roads  
and canals, and the improved navigation of water  
courses; and that a power in the National Legisla­  
ture to provide for them, might be exercised with  
signal advantage to the general prosperity. Hut see­  
ing that such a power is not expressly given by the  
Constitution; and believing it cannot be deduced  
from any part of it, without an inadmissible latitude  
of construction, and a reliance tin insufficient pre­  
cedents; believing, also, that the permanent success  
of the Constitution depends on a definite partition of  
powers between the general and the state govern­  
ments, and that no adequate landmarks would be left  
by the constructive extension of the powers of Con­  
gress, as proposed in the bill, 1 have no option but to  
withhold my signature from it: cherishing ihehope,  
that its beneficial objects may be attained, by a re­

and virtue in the nation, which established the Con­  
stitution in its actual form, and providently marked  
out, in the instrument itself, a safe and practicable  
mode of improving it, as experience mignt suggest.

Such a view of the Constitution, finally,  
would have the effect of excluding the Judical authority  
of the United States from its participation in  
guarding the boundary between toe Legislative  
powers of the general and of the state governments ;  
inasmuch as questions relating to the general welfare,

A restriction of the power &quot; to provide for the

supreme law of the land; and the judges of every state shall be bound thereby, anything i in the  
Constitution orlaws of auy state t ) the c outr ur&#x27;y notwithstauding.”’ Such a view of the Constitu-  
tion, finally, would have the effect of excluding the judicial authority of the United States from  
its participation in gui irding the boundary between the general and the state governments,  
inasmuch as questions relating to the general welfare, being questions of policy and expediency,  
are unsusceptible of iudici al cognizance and decision,  
  
A restriction of the power “to provide for the common defence and general welfare” to  
cases Which are to be provided for by the expenditure of money, would still leave within the  
legislative power of congress all the great and most important measures of government—mo-  
nev being the chescorat and necess ar vy means of carrying them into execution,  
  
Ifa general power to construct roads and canals, and to improve the navigation of water courses,  
With the train of powe rs incident thereto, be not possessed by congress, the assent of the  
states, in the mode provided by the bill, cannot confer the power, The only cases in which  
he conseut and cession of particular states can extend the power of congress, are those spe-  
cilied and provided tor in the Constitution,  
  
I am not unaware of the great importance of roads and canals, and the improve -d navigation  
of water courses: and that a power in the national legislature to provide for them might be  
exercised with signal advantage tothe general prosperity, But seeing that sucha power is not  
expressly given by the constitution; and believing it cannot be deduced from any part of it,  
without an admissible latitude of construction, and a reliance on insuilicient precedents; believ-  
ing, also, that the permanent success of the Constitution depends on a definite partition of pow-  
ers between the general and the state governments, and that no adequate landmarks would be  
left by the constructive extension of the powers of congress, as proposed in the bill, [ have no  
option but to withhold my signature from it; cherishing the hope that its beneficial objects may  
be attained, by a resort for the necessary powers, to the same eer ym and virtue in the nation  
which established the Constitution in its actual form, and providently marked out in the instru-  
ment itself a safe and practicable mode of improving it, as experience might suggest.  
  
March 3, 1817, JAMES MADISON

? i&quot; &quot;*v.&#x27;nK considered the bill this day presented to me, en­  
titled &#x27; An act to set apart and pledge certain funds lor  
internal improvements,&#x27; and which sett apart and pledget  
funds for constructing roads and canals, and improving itie  
navigation of water-courses, in order to facilitato, promote  
and give security to internal commerce among the several  
Stales, and to render more easy and less expensive the  
means and provisions for the common defence, 1 ain con­  
st&#x27;sim-d. by the insuperable difficulty I feel in reconciling  
the bill with the constitution ol the United Slates, to return  
It with that objection lo &#x27;be House ol Representatives, in  
which it originated. &#x27;  
&quot;The legislative powers vested In Congress are specified  
and enumerated In the eighth section ol the first article o/  
the constitution ; and it does not appear that the power  
proposed lo be exercised by the lild is among the enumer  
or hy any just interpretation,  
within the power to make laws necessary and proper lor  
carrying into execution those &quot; or other powers vetted bv  
the constitution in the government of the United States.&quot;  
This is the point to wfeich I wish to call the attention  
ol tne oenate:  
Pow,er, ,0, &#x27;egulate commerce among the several  
States cannot Include a power to construct rosds and  
canals, and to Improve the navigation of water courses, in  
order to facilitate, promote, and secure such a commerce,  
without a latitude of construction departing Irom the ordi­  
nary Import of the terms, strengthened by tho known in­  
oonvenienoet which doubtless led to tite grant ol lius laiao­  
dial power to Congiett.&quot;  
Thus we see lhat, in the view which Mr. Madison  
takes of it, &quot;the power to regulate commerce&quot; differs es­  
sential y from the power -to facilitate-&#x27; it, and I believe  
it would be impossible to show that they are in any wav  
synonymous. 11  
He continues to say :  
, &quot; T? refor lh&quot; P?,w,er ln qu??&lt;ion to I he clauso &#x27;to provide

contrary to the established and consistent rules ol Iniernre  
ration ; as rendering ihe special and carelul enumeration of

*t the mercy of the Central Government, our system would  
lose every character t f federation, and the richts of the Statis  
be an empty mockery. We ure foi &quot;progresV&quot; oui not ror  
such as would t&lt;-ar the Constitution to pieces. As &quot;Pro j  
Patria&quot; has cited some great names in behalf of his propo  
sition, we shall content ourselves with quoting the views of  
President Madison in his me&amp;.?a&gt;. of February, 1817, vet &lt;­  
lng the bill to set apart and pledge, us a permanent fund for  
internal im provernents, the bonus of the National Bjnk and  
the United States share of its dividends.&quot;  
  
Mr. MadsoD said:  
The legislative powers vested in Congress are specified  
and enumerated in the 8th section of the lirst article uf the  
Constitution; and it dots not nppeiir that the power, pro­  
posed to be exert.i*ed by the bill, is among ihe enumerated  
powers; or that it falls, by any j&#x27;ist interpretation, within  
the power to make laws necessary and proper for cturying  
Into execution those or other powers vested by the Constitu­  
tion ia the Governmental the United States.  
The power to regulate commerce among the sev.ral  
States, cannot include a power to construct roads iiud ca­  
nals, and to improve the navigation of water course*, in or­  
der to facilitate, promote, and secure, such u commerce,  
without a latitude of construction, departing from the ordi­  
nary iinpuit of the terms, strengthened by the known incon­  
veniences which doubtless led to the grant of line remedial  
power to Congress. To refer the power in question to the  
clau&#x27;e &quot;to provide l&#x27;*&gt;r the common defence and genera! wel­  
fare,&quot; would he contrary to the established and consistent  
rules of interpretation; as rendering the special und careful  
enumeration of powers which follow the clause, nugatory  
and improper. Such a view of the Constitution would have  
the t-tfect of giving to Congress :t general power of legisla­  
tion, instead ?&gt;f the defined and limited one hitherto under­  
stood to belong &#x27;o tl&#x27;.eni, tin: tcrniH l,the common defence  
and general welfare,&quot; embracingevery object and act within  
the purview of the legislative trust. It would tmv.. the effect  
of subjecting both the Constitution and laws of the several  
States, in all cases not specifically exempted, to lie superse­  
ded by laws of Congress; it being expressly declared, &quot;that  
the Constitution of the United States, and laws made in  
pursuance thereof, shall he the supreme law of the. land, and  
the judges of every State shall be bound thereby, any thing  
in the Constitution, or laws Of any State to the contrary  
notwithstanding.&quot; Such a view of the Constitution, final­  
ly, .vould have the effect of excluding the judicial authority  
of the United States Irom its participation in guarding tl.c  
boundary between the legislative powers of the General and  
the Siate Governments; inasmuch as questions relating to the  
general welfare, being questions ol policy and expediency,  
are unsusceptible of Judicial cognizance and decision.  
A restriction of the pow.r &quot;t?&gt; provide lor the common  
defence and general welfare,&quot; to cases wltlcll aic to be  
provided lor by the expenditure of money, would still leive  
within the legislative power of Congress all itv great 11,111  
most important measures of Govi-rntm n&lt;; oioncv being the  
ordinary and necessary means ol carrying them into ex;ca­  
tion.  
If a general power to construct roads and canals, to im­  
prove the navigation of water roursrs, with tho train &quot;f  
powers incident thereto, b? not possessed by Congress, the  
assent of lite Slates, in itie in &gt;de provided in the bill, cannot  
confer the power. The only c ises in which the consent  
and ces-ilon ol particular States can extend the power of  
Congress, are those specified and provided for in the Consti­  
tution.

in which the consent and cession of particular States cap

the bill entitled 44 An act to set apart and pledge certain  
funds for internal improvements, for constructing roads  
and canals, and improving tho navigation of water­  
courses, in order to facilitate, promote, and give security  
to internal commerce among the severul States, and to  
reuder more easy aud less expensive the means and pro­  
visions for the common defence,&quot; with his objections.  
Among others, Mr. M. urged the following:  
44 The legislative powers vested in Congress are speci­  
fic, und enumerated in the eighth section of the first arti­  
cle of the Constitution ; and it does not appeur that the  
power proposed to be exercised by the bill is among the  
enumerated powers, or that it falls, by any just interpre­  
tation, within the power to make laws necessary and  
proper for carrying into execution those or other powers  
vented by the Constitution in the Government of the  
i United States.&quot;  
He did not consider that 44 the power to regulate com­  
merce among the several States&quot; included 4ia power to  
construct roads and canals,&quot; &amp;c.f nor the clause &quot; to  
! provide for the common defence and general welfare,&quot;  
as these would embrace every object and act within the  
purview of a legislative trust.  
J &quot;The constitution and laws of the several States, in all  
cases not specifically oxeuipted, might be superseded by  
laws of Congress.

44 If d general power to construct roads and canals and  
to improve the navigation of water-courses, with the train  
of powers incident thereto, be not possessed by Congress,  
the assent of the States, in tho mode provided in the bill,  
cannot confer the power. Tho only cases in which the  
content and cession of particular States can extend the  
power of Congress are those specified and provided for

Mr. Madison concluded his objections thus:  
441 am not unaware of the great importance of roads  
and canals and the improved navigation of water-courses,  
and that a power in the National Legislature&#x27;to provide  
for them might be exercised with signal advantage to the  
general prosperity. But seeing thut such a power is not  
expressly given by the Constitution, and believing that  
it cannot be deduced from any part of it without an in­  
admissible latitude of construction and a reliance on in­  
sufiicient precedents ; believing, also, that the permanent  
success of the Constitution depends on a definitive parti­  
tion of powers between the General Government and the  
State Governments, and that no adequate landmarks  
would be left by the constructive extension of the powers  
of Congress as proposed in the bill, 1 have no option but  
to withhold my signature from it, cherishing the hope  
that its beneficial objects may be attained by a resort  
for the necessary powers to the same wisdom and virtue  
in the nation which established the Constitution in its  
actual form, and providently marked out in tho instru­  
ment itself a safe and practicable mode of improving it,  
as experience might suggest.
