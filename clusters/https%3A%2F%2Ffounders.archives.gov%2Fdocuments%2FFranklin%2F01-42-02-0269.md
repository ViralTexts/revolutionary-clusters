Passy, near Paris July 18. 1784.  
  
On receipt of your Letter, acquainting me that the Archbishop would not permit you to be ordain’d unless you took the Oath of Allegiance, I apply’d to a Clergyman of my Acquaintance for Information on the Subject of your Obtaining Ordination here. His Opinion was, that it could not be done; and that if it were done you would be requir’d to Vow Obedience to the Archbishop of Paris. I next enquir’d of the Pope’s Nuncio, whether you might not be ordain’d by their Bishop in America, Powers being sent him for that purpose if he has them not already. The Answer was, The Thing is impossible, unless the Gentlemen became Catholicks.—  
This is an Affair of which I know very little, &amp; therefore I may ask Questions &amp; propose means that are improper or  
  
impracticable: But what is the necessity of your being connected with the Church of England? Would it not be as well if you were of the Church of Ireland? The Religion is the same, tho’ there is a different Set of Bishops and Archbishops. Perhaps if you were to apply to the Bishop of Derry, who is a Man of liberal Sentiments, he might give you Orders as of that Church. If both Britain &amp; Ireland refuse you; and I am not sure that the Bishops of Denmark or Sweden would ordain you unless you became Lutherans; what is to be done? Next to becoming Presbyterians, the Episcopalian Clergy of America, in my humble Opinion, cannot do better, than to follow the Example of the first Clergy of Scotland, soon after the Conversion of that Country to Christianity; who when their King had built the Cathedral of St Andrews, and requested the King of Northumberland to lend his Bishops to ordain one for them, that their Clergy might not as heretofore be obliged to go to Northumberland for Orders, and their Request was refused; they assembled in the Cathedral, and the Mitre, Crosier, &amp; Robes of a Bishop being laid upon the Altar, they, after earnest Prayers for Direction in their Choice, elected one of their own Number, when the King said to him, Arise, go to the Altar, and receive your Office at the Hand of God. His Brethren led him to the Altar, robed him, put the Crosier in his Hand, &amp; the Mitre on his Head, and he became the first Bishop of Scotland.—  
If the British Islands were sunk in the Sea, (&amp; the Surface of this Globe has suffer’d greater Changes) you would probably take some such Method as this: And if they persist in denying you Ordination, tis the same thing. An hundred Years hence,  
  
when People are more enlightend, it will be wonder’d at, that Men in America, qualified by their Learning and Piety to pray for &amp; instruct their Neighbours, should not be permitted so to do, till they had made a Voyage of 6000 Miles out &amp; home, to ask leave of a cross old Gentleman at Canterbury: Who seems, by your Account, to have as little Regard for the Souls of the People of Maryland, as King William’s Attorney General Seymour had for those of Virginia. The Reverend Commissary Blair, who projected the College of that Province, and was in England to solicit Benifactions &amp; a Charter, relates, that the Queen in the King’s Absence having ordered Seymour to draw up the Charter which was to be given with 2000 £ in Money, he oppos’d the Grant, saying that the Nation was engag’d in an expensive War, that the Money was wanted for better purposes, &amp; he did not see the least Occasion for a College in Virginia. Blair represented to him, that its Intention was to educate &amp; qualify young Men to be Ministers of the Gospel, much wanted there; and begg’d Mr Attorney would consider that the People of Virginia had Souls to be saved as well as the People of England. Souls! says he, damn your Souls. Make Tobacco!

“ Passy, near Paris, July 18, 1784.  
  
“* Gentlemen,—On receipt of your letter,  
acquainting me that the Archbishop of  
Canterbary would not permit you to be  
ordained unless you took the oath of alle-  
giance, I applied to a clergyman of my  
acquaintance for information on the subject  
of your obtaining ordination bere. His  
opinion. was that it could not be done, and  
that if it were done you would be required  
to vow obedience to the Archbishop of  
Paris. I next inquired of the Pope&#x27;s  
Nuncio, whether you might not be ordained  
by their Bishop in America, powers being  
sent him for that purpose, if he has them  
not already. The answer was, the thing is  
impossible, unless the gentlemen become  
Catholicks.  
  
“ This is an affair of which I know very  
little, and therefore I may ask questions,  
and propose means that are improper or  
impracticable. But what is the necessity  
of your being connected with the Charch of  
England? Would it not be as well if you  
were of the Church of Ireland? The re-  
ligion is the same, though there is a dif-  
ferent set of Bishops, and Archbishops.  
Perhaps if you were to apply to the Bishop  
of Derry, who is a man of liberal sentiments,  
he might give you orders as of that Church.  
If both Britain and Ireland refuse you; and  
1 am not sure that the Bishops of Denmark,  
or of Sweden, will ordain you, unless you  
become Lutheraus ; what is to be done?  
Next to becoming Presbyterians, the Epis-  
copalian Clergy of America, in my hamble  
opinion, cannot do better than to follow the  
éxample of the first Clergy of Scotland, soon  
after the conversion of that country to  
Christianity; who, when their King bad  
built the Cathedral of St. Andrews, and re-  
quesied the King of Northumberland to  
lend his Bishops to ordain one for them,  
that their clergy might not as heretofore be  
obliged to go to Northamberland for orders,  
aud the request was refased ; they assem-  
bied in the Cathedral, and the mitre, crosier,  
and the robes of a Bishop being laid:upon  
the altar, they, after earnest prayers for  
direction in their choice, elected one of  
their own number ; then the King said to  
him, Arise, go to the altar, and receive your  
office at the hand of God, His brethren

erosier in his hand, and the mitre on bis  
head, and he became the first Bishop of  
Scotland.  
  
“ If the British islands were sunk in the  
sea, (and the surface of this globe has suf-  
fered greater changes), you will probably  
take some such metbod as this; and if they  
persist in denying your ordination it is the  
same thing. An bandred years hence, when  
people are more enlightened, it will be  
wondered at, that men in America, qualificd  
by their learning and piety, to pray for, and  
instroct, their neighbours, should not be  
permitted to do it till they had made a  
voyage of 6000 miles out and home, to ask  
leave of across old gentleman at Canterbury ;  
who seems, by your account, to have as  
little regard for the souls of the people of  
Maryland, as King William’s Attorney  
General, Seymour, had for those of Virginia.  
The Rev. Commissary Blair who projected  
the College of that province, and was in  
England to solicit benefactions under  
Charter, relates that the King in the  
Queen’s absence having ordered Seymour  
to draw up the Charter, which was to be  
given with 2,000 ponnds in mouey, he op-  
posed the grant ; saying that the nation was  
engaged in an expensive war, that the  
money was wanted for better purposes, and  
he did not see the least occasion for a  
college in Virginia. Blair represented to  
him that its intention was to educate and  
qualify young men to be ministers in the  
Gospel, much wanted thcre; and begged  
Mr. Attorney would consider that the  
people of Virginia had souls to be saved as

in London. P\ms, l$ih July, 1784.  
Gentlemen—On receipt of your letter acquain­  
ting me that the Ashbishop of Canterbury would  
viki mwmit vnti to be ordained unless you took the  
  
oath of alhgiancc, I applied t &gt; a clergyman of  
mv acquaintance for information on the subject  
of vour obtaining ordination here. His opinion  
was, that it could not be done; and that if it were  
done, vou would be required to vow obedience to  
the Arch bis) lop of Pari*. I next inquired of the  
, Pope’s Nuncio whether you might not be ordained  
by the Bishop of America, powers being sent him  
for the purpose—if be has them not already.—  
The answer was, the thing \r impO&quot;ib!e, unless  
llie gentlemen become C atholics. This is an af­  
• fair of which I know but very little, andthere­  
1 fore I may ask questions and propose means that  
are iniprop* r or impracticable. But what i* the  
ncccsMtv of votir being connected with the church  
of England?&quot; Would it not do as well, if you  
were of the church of Ireland? The religion is  
the same, though there is a different set of Bishops  
and Arch-Bishops. Perhaps if you were to apply  
to the Bishop of Derry, who is a man of liberal  
1 sentiment&#x27;, lie might give you orders, as of that  
church. If both Britain and Ireland refuse you,  
1 (and 1 am not sure that the Bishop of Denmark  
or Swedt n would ordain vou unless you became  
Lutherans,) what is then to be done? Next to  
becoming Presbyterians, the Episcopalian Clergy  
’ of America, in my humble opinion, cannot do  
better than to follow the example of the fir^t  
Clergy of Scotland soon after the conversion of  
that country to Christianity, when their king had  
built the Cathedral of St. Andrews, and requested  
the king of Northumberland to lend his Bishops  
to ordain one for them, that their clergy might  
not, as heretofore, bo obliged to go to Northum­  
berland for orders, and their request was refused.  
&#x27;I l ev assembled in the Cathedral, and the mitre,  
cm/ier, and robes of a Bishop being laid upon the  
altar, they, after earnest prayers for direction in  
their choice elected ore of their own number,  
when the king said to him, “Arise, go to the Al­  
tar, and receive your office at the hand ot God.  
His brethren led&#x27;him to the altar, robed him, put  
the crozier in his hand, ihe mitre on his head,  
ami he became the E:r-1 Bishop of Scotland.  
If the British Islands w ere sunk in the &#x27;ca, (and  
the surface of the globe has suffered greater chan­  
ges,) you would probably take some such method  
as this, and, if they persist in denying you ordina­  
tion, it is the same thihg. A hundred years lienee  
when people are more enlightened, it vviii be won­  
dered at that men in America qualified by their
