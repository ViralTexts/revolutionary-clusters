		Quincy, May 9, 1809.  
				  
				At first I intended to encumber your paper with no  
Documents but such as were absolutely necessary for my  
own vindication. But as the peace with France in eighteen hundred  
was not only an event of great importance in itself, but  
produced demonstrations of the prejudices, passions, views,  
designs and systems of parties, more perhaps than any  
other; I hope you will allow me room for such other papers as may serve to throw light upon this subject. At  
present it may not be very interesting, but the cause of  
truth and justice may hereafter be promoted by having  
the facts and evidences laid together in a series. The  
future policy of the nation will not be injured by it.  
Besides the communications already published from the  
sovereign of the French nation, through their Minister of  
foreign relations, their diplomatic organ at the Hague, and  
our Minister there, another was communicated through  
the same channels in these words:—Copy of a letter dated Paris, 11th Fructidor, 6 year,  
(August 28, 1798,) from Mr. Talleyrand, as Minister of Exterior Relations, to Mr. Pichon, Secretary  
of Legation, Hague.TRANSLATION.I see with pleasure, citizen, that the intercourse of society has procured you some political conversations with Mr. Murray. I entertain an esteem for that Minister.—Like all the men at the head of the affairs of the United  
States, he has received the impressions which the British  
Cabinet has known how to give, against us. He thinks  
the measures of his government just and supports them:  
but he possesses reason, understanding, and a true attachment to his country: he is neither French nor English:  
he is ingenuously an American. I am not at all surprised  
that he has appeared to you to wish sincerely for the reconciliation of the two Republics. I will therefore cheerfully answer the questions you put to me, on different  
points, which appeared to you, not to be well established  
in his mind. I do not see, between France and the United States any clashing of interest, any cause of jealousy.  
The Americans wish to be fishermen, sailors, manufacturers, and especially husbandmen. In all these points of  
view, their success is more at the expense of England than  
us. Why should we be uneasy about them? They aspire to the consolidation of their national existence, and  
it is to our purpose that they should succeed. In fact, we  
should have decided upon very superficial views, to sustain their Independence, if the matter was to separate them  
from England, merely to leave them finally insulated among themselves, on an extensive seacoast, weak rivaling,  
and impoverished by each other, and torn by foreign intrigues. We know that Great Britain would soon have  
put together, piece by piece those scattered shreds, and  
we should have done nothing useful for ourselves, if so  
miserable a chance of it, were not daily rendered more  
remote.  
What, therefore is the cause of the misunderstanding,  
which, if France did not manifest herself more wise, would  
henceforth induce a violent rupture between the two Republics? Neither incompatible interests, nor projects of  
aggrandizement divide them. After all, distrust alone  
has done the whole. The government of the United  
States has thought, that France wanted to revolutionize it.  
France has thought that the government of the United  
States wanted to throw itself into the arms of England. It does not require much skill to divine, which is the Cabinet interested in the two events producing each other,  
and which invisibly puts in motion all the expedients calculated to make them take effect. Let us open our eyes  
on both sides. I am disposed to admit that the conduct  
of the government of the United States may be explained  
by other causes than those heretofore presumed. But let  
it on its part, understand, that the French government,  
wounded as it may be, is too wise to entertain the views  
of disturbance, which the other supposes. It concerns a  
Republic, founded on the system of Representation, to support and not to weaken similar establishments. The stability of this system abroad is a necessary example at home.  
France in fine, has a double motive as a nation and as a  
republic, not to expose to any hazard, the present existence of the United States. Therefore it never thought  
of making war against them, nor exciting civil commotions  
among them: and every contrary supposition is an insult  
to common sense.  
These fundamental principles being established, it is  
natural to ask by what fatality, a good understanding was  
not long since restored? It was because irritation being  
mingled with distrust, neither party yielded to real conciliatory inclinations. In the United States it was supposed  
that the French government was temporizing, in order to  
strike the blow with greater certainty; whence resulted a  
crowd of measures, more and more aggravating. In  
France it was supposed that the government of the United  
States, wished only the appearances of a negociation,  
whence resulted a certain demand for pledges of good faith.  
Let us substitute calmness for passion, confidence for  
suspicions, and we shall soon agree. I used my endeavors  
to enter upon a negociation in this spirit, with Mr. Gerry. My correspondence with him, until the day of his  
departure, is a curious monument of advances on my  
part, and of evasions on his. It is wrong to think that  
I confined myself to vague protestations. Among that  
series of official Letters, which will doubtless be published  
at Philadelphia, I select one of the 30th Prairial, wherein you will see that I make very positive propositions, without any mixture of preliminary conditions. This letter  
was followed by three notes upon the Articles to be discussed, and I intended to complete the others in this manner, if Mr. Gerry had not refused to answer thereto.  
When it became necessary to abandon the idea of treating with that envoy, who thought it important only to  
know how a negociation might thereafter be resumed, I  
gave him the most solemn assurances concerning the reception that a new plenipotentiary would receive. It was  
far from my thoughts to insinuate that the President  
should send one from the United States, instead of investing with his powers some one who was in Europe; far  
less that the envoy should land directly in France, instead  
of announcing it in a neighboring country. I wished  
merely to say that the Executive Directory was so decided  
for a reconciliation, that all tampering would be superfluous, that an act of confidence in it, would excite its own.  
I should be very badly understood, if there should be found  
in my expressions, a restriction on the nature of the choice  
which the President might make. I wished to encourage  
Mr. Gerry by testimonies of regard, that his good intentions merited. Although I could not dissemble that he  
wanted decision at a moment when he might have easily  
adjusted every thing. It does not thence follow that I  
designated him; I will even avow that I think him too  
irresolute to be fit to hasten the conclusion of an affair of  
this kind. The advantages that I prized in him are common to all Americans, who have not manifested a predilection for England. Can it be believed that a man who  
should profess a hatred or contempt of the French Republic, or should manifest himself the advocate of royalty,  
can inspire the Directory with a favorable opinion of the  
dispositions of the government of the United States? I  
should have disguised the truth, if I had left this matter  
ambiguous: it is not to wound the Independence of that  
government, to point out to a sincere friend of peace, the  
shoals he ought to avoid. As to the mediation of the Batavian Republic and of  
Spain, I do not know that there is any serious question  
about it, and it appears to me absolutely useless. The  
United States might hesitate, in the present state of things,  
to refer themselves to their impartiality, and besides I see  
no subject which may not be arranged directly.  
I know that the distance which separates France and the  
United States opens a vast field for incident, and there  
have been but too many of them. But the Executive  
Directory is unshaken in the conduct which may best obviate them. The excess even of provocations has deadened their effect.—The government of the United States  
surrounds itself with precautions against an imaginary attack. To stretch the hand to deluded friends, is what  
one republic owes to another, and I cannot doubt that  
the dignity of that attitude will convince the President of  
our pacific dispositions.  
The two governments ought above all to be attentive  
to indirect attempts to alienate them still more. Their  
prudence will secure this object, and I shall cite but one  
example of it. You have told Mr. Murray the truth  
respecting Dr. Logan. But I perceive, that on all hands  
it is attempted to produce a belief in America, that we  
are negociating with him. On the 7th of this month a  
very insidious paragraph was inserted in the “Bien Informé.” It is therein intimated, that guided by the citizen Thomas Paine, Dr. Logan has made application to  
the Executive Directory, in the character of secret agent.  
The Doctor has complained of it bitterly to me. He  
has no need of justifying himself concerning a matter,  
the falsity of which I know better than any body: but  
he assured me that having once met Thomas Paine, at  
the house of a third person, he found him so prejudiced  
against the United States, and so opinionative, with respect to an influence he neither possesses among them nor  
us, that he abstained from conversing any more with him.  
Moreover, to cut short all misunderstanding, I engaged  
Dr. Logan to postpone, till another time, the experiments  
he proposes to make on agriculture, and to return home. As to Mr. Hitchborn, of Massachusetts, I was even ignorant till now that he was in Europe. A single word will  
suffice for the rest.  
We want nothing but justice on the part of the United  
States: we ask it: we offer it to their government: it  
may depend upon the candor of the Executive Directory.You will not doubt, citizen, that I approve of the communications which your zeal has caused you to seek with  
Mr. Murray, since I enable you to resume them with official elucidations, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.  
Ch. Mau. TalleyrandThis and all the other communications from the French  
minister, heretofore published in my letter to you, were  
produced by my message to Congress of the 21st of June  
1798, which was in these words:Gentlemen of the Senate, and  
Gentlemen of the House of Representatives,While I congratulate you on the arrival of General  
Marshall, one of our late envoys extraordinary to the French  
republic, at a place of safety, where he is justly held in  
honor, I think it my duty to communicate to you, a letter  
received by him from Mr. Gerry, the only one of the  
three who has not received his congé. This letter, together with another from the minister of foreign relations  
to him, of the 3d of April, and his answer of the 4th,  
will shew the situation in which he remains, his intentions  
and prospects.  
I presume, that before this time he has received fresh  
instructions, a copy of which accompanies this message,  
to consent to no loans, and therefore the negociation may  
be considered at an end. I will never send another minister to France, without assurances that he will be received, respected and honored, as  
the representative of a great, free, powerful and independent  
nation.John AdamsUnited States, June 21st, 1798.In my next letter you will have the evidence of the  
compliance of the French government with the conditions  
and requisitions in my message to the Senate, nominating  
Mr. Murray and others ministers and envoys to France.

l Quincy, May 10k, 1809.  
7o the Printers of the Beflon Patriof,  
Sirs,  
; At firk T intended to encumber  
your paper with no Documents but  
such as were absolutely necessary for  
my own vindication. But as the  
| peace with France in eighteen hun­  
| dred was not only an event of great  
&#x27;ﬁ importance in itfelf, but produced de­  
monfirations of the preijudices, pai­  
fions, views, designs and systems of  
- parties, more perhaps than any other 3  
I hope you will allow me room for  
such ather papers as may serve to  
throw light wpon this fubje&amp;. At  
present it may not be very interesting,  
but the cause of truth and jultice may  
hereaftet be promoted by having the  
fa@s and evidences laid together in 2  
series. The future policy of the na­  
tion will not be injured by it.  
Besides the communications alrea­  
dy püblithed from the sovereign of  
&#x27;the French nation, through their Min­  
ilter of foreign relations, their diplo­  
matic organ at the Hague, and our  
. Minister there, another was commue  
~nicated through the fame channels in  
~ these words :~ )  
Copy of a Letssr dated Paris, 111 h  
- Fru®idor, 6 year, ( August 28, 1798,)  
from Mr. Tarzrrrans, ac Minifler  
i of Exterior Relations, to Mr. Picaon,  
- Secretary of Legation, Hagye.  
TRANSLATION.  
I fee with pleasure, citizen, that the  
-intercourse of society has procured you  
&#x27; some political conversations with Mr.  
- Murray. I entertain an esteem for  
f that Minister. L&#x27;ke all the men at  
the head of the affairs of the United  
&#x27; States, he has received the impref­  
~ fions which the Britith Cabinet hag  
&#x27; known how to giv inst us. H  
give, against us. He  
l thinks the measures of his govern­  
ment just and supports them : but he  
poffefles reason, understanding, and a  
true attachment to his country : heis  
neither French nor English : heisina  
genuoufly an American.” I am not  
at all surprised that he has appeared  
to you to wish sincerely for the recofi­  
ciliation of the two Republics. I will  
therefore cheerfully an{wer the ques­  
tions you put to me, on different  
points, which appeared to you, not to  
be well eftablithed in bhis mind. Ido  
not fee, between France and the Unit  
ed States any clashing of interest, any  
-cause of * jealonfy. The Americans  
with to be fithermen, sailors, manu­  
facturers, and especially husbandmen.  
~ In all these points of view, their fuc.  
cefs is more at the expence of Eng­  
- land thabus. Why thould we be un-  
E eafly about them ? They aspire to the  
-consolidation of . their national exis­  
tence, and it is te/ our purpose that  
r they should succeed. In fa&amp;, we  
_ {hould have decided upon very fuper­  
ficial views, to sustain their Indepen­  
_dence, if the matter was to feperate  
} them from England, merely to leave  
them finally insulated among them­  
; {elves, on an extensive feacoalt, weak  
rivaling, ‘and impoverished by each  
other, and torn by foreign intrigues.  
We know that Great Britain would  
soon have put together, piece by piece  
those scattered shreds, and we should  
&#x27;have done nothing ufeful for ourselves,  
if so miserable a chance of it, were  
‘not daily rendered more remote.  
- What, thereCre is the cause of the  
~ mifunderßanding,. which, if France  
{ did not manifelt herfelf more wife,  
would henceforth induce a violepe  
rupture between the two Republics 2  
Neither incompatible interests, nor  
| Proje@s of aggrandizement . divide  
‘them. After all, distrust alone has  
~done the whole. The goyernment

%o throw itielf into the arms of Eng- 1  
“sand. It does not require much skill  
to divine, which is the Cabinet inter­  
ested in the two events producing  
each other, and which invisibly puts  
in motion all the expegients calculated  
to make them take effe¢t. Let us  
open our eyés op both sides. [am  
disposed to admit that the conduét of  
“ the government of the United States  
may be explained by other causes  
than those heretofore presumed. But  
let it on its part, understand, that the  
French government, wounded as it  
Thay be, is too wife to entertain the  
views of disturbance, which the other  
supposes. It concerns a Republic,  
founded on the system of Representa­  
tion, to fapport and not to weaken  
similar eftablithments. The {ability  
of this {yllem abroad is a neceflary  
example at home. France in fine,  
has a double motive as a nation and  
as a republic, not to expole to any  
hazard, the prefeat existence of the  
United States. Therefore it never  
thought of making war against them,  
nor exciting civil commotions 3mong  
them : and every contrary™ fuppofi­  
‘won is an insult to common sense. .  
These fundamental principles being  
«ftablifhed, ditis matural to atk by  
© what fatality, a good under&amp;anding  
was not long -since reffored ? 1t was  
hecaufe irritatien being mingled with  
diltruft, neither party yiclded to real  
conciliatory inclinations. In the U­  
wited States it was supposed that the  
French government was temporiziog,  
in order to firike the blow with graat­  
er certainty ; whence reflulted a crewd  
of measure, more and more aggrava­  
tiny. In France-it was supposed that  
the government of the United States,  
withed only the appearances of a ne­  
gociation, whenct resulted a certain  
demand for pledges of good faith. »  
* Let us fubflitute czlmuefs for passion,  
confidence for suspicions, and we shall soon  
agree. 1 used my endeavors to enter up­  
on a pegodiation in thig {pirit, with Mr.  
Grrav, My correfpondencéwith him, un­  
til the day of his departure, is a curious  
monument of advamces on my part, and  
of evasions of his. It is wrong to think  
that I confined myfelf to vagus protesta­  
tions. Among that series of official Let.  
ters, which wiil doubtless be publithed at  
Philadelphia, I select one of the zoth Prai­  
tial, wherein you will fee that I make very  
positive propositions, without any mixture  
of preliminary conditions. This letter was  
followed by three notes upon the Articles  
to be difcutled, and I intended to complete  
the others in this manaer if Mr, Getry had  
not refuled to answer thereto.  
When it became neceflary to ahandon  
the idea of treating with that eavoy, who  
thought it important only to know how a  
negociation might thereafter be resumed, 1  
gave him the most solemn aflurances coh­  
cerning the reception that a new plenipo­  
teatiary would receive. It was far from  
my thoughts to Mhnuare that the President  
should fend one from the United States, in­  
flead of investing with his powers {fome enc  
who was in Europe ; far lefe that the envoy  
. should land dire@ly in-France, inftcad of  
wnnouacing it in a neighboring &quot;country. 1  
withed merely to fay: that the Executive  
Directory was so decided for a reconcilia­  
tion, that all tampering would be fuperflu­  
ous, that an act of confidence in it, would  
&quot; excite its own. [ should be very badly un­  
derstood, ifthere should be found in my  
exprefliens a restriction on the nature of  
the choice which the President might make,  
1 wished to encourage Mr. Gerry by tefti­  
monics of regard, that his good intentions  
merited. Aithough I could not dissemble  
that he wanted decision at a moment when  
he might have easily adjusted every thing.  
¥t does not thence follow that I designated  
him ; I wil even avow that I think him too  
“irresolute to § fit to hasten the conclusion  
of an affair of this kind. The advantages  
that I prized in him are common to all A­  
mecricans, who have not manifc{ted 2 pre­  
dile&amp;ion for England. Can it be believed  
t™t 2 man who should profefs a hatred or  
contempt of the French Repablic, or should  
manifeft himfelf the advocate of royalty,  
can in{pire the DireCtory with a favorable  
opinion of the difpofitiors of the govern­  
ment of the United States ? I {hounld have  
diiguifed the truth,if I had left this matter  
ambiguous ; it is not to wound the Inde­  
pendence of that government, to point out  
to a sincere friend” of peace, the shoals he  
ought to axoid. A o :  
As to the mediation of the Batavian Re­  
public and of Spain,l do not know that there  
is any serious question about it, and it ap­  
pears to me absolutely uleleis. The Uni­  
ted States might heiitate, in the ‘prefent  
fiate of things, to refer themielves 1o their  
itapartiality, -and -be§des’T foe 10 subject  
which mayv not be arranged dire&amp;ly. .  
1 know that the distance which separates  
France and the United States, opens a vast  
field forincident,and there have beea but too  
many of them. Butthe Exccutive Direc­  
tory is unshaken in the conduc which may  
best obviate them. The&#x27; gxecels even’ of

be atténtive to indiret attempts to alienate

eare this ﬁobit&amp;&amp; ran?‘ [ {«.ll cite but one

the United States, and [0 opinionative, with  
relpedt to an igffuence he neither poffefles -  
amﬁthem nor us, that he abstained from  
conversing any more with him. Moreover,  
to cut short all misunderstanding, I engaged  
Dr. Logan to postpone till another time,the  
experiments he proposes to make on agricul­  
ture, aand to return home. Asto Mr. Hitch-&#x27;

We want nothing but justice on the part  
of the United States : we atk it : we offer  
it to their govefnment : it&#x27;may depend up­  
on the candor of the Ezecutive DireCtory.  
You will not doubt, citizen, that [ approve

caused you to seek with Mr. Murray, since  
I enable you to resume them with official  
elucidations &amp;e. &amp;ec. &amp;c.  
CH. MAU. TALLEYRA D.  
This and all the other communications  
from the Freach minister, heretofore pub­  
lithed in my letter to you, were produced  
by my meflage to Congress of the 21st of  
june, 1798, which was in these words  
Genilemen of the Senate, and &#x27;  
&#x27; Gentlemen of the House of Representatives,  
~ While I congratulate you on the arrival  
- of General Marshall, one of our late envoys  
cxtraordinary to the French republic at a  
place of fafety, where he is juitly held in  
honor, I think it my duty to communicate  
to you, a letter reccived by him from Mr.  
Gerry, the only one of the three who has  
not reccived his&#x27; conge. This letter, to­  
~ gether with another from the minister of  
foreign relations to him, of the 3d of April,  
and his answer of the 4th, will shew the sit­  
uation in which he remains, his intentions  
and profpeé@s.  
I presume, that before this time he has  
received frefh inftrucions, a copy of which  
accompanies this&#x27;meffage, to consent to no  
loans, and thercfore the negociation may be  
considered at an end. _  
A wil] never fend another minifier to France,  
without assurances that he will be received res­  
pected and bonored, as the representative of a great,  
free, powerful, and independent nation.  
JOHN ADAMS.  
United States, fune 214, 1798.  
In my next letter you will have the evi­  
dence of the compliance of the French gov­  
ernment with the conditions and requifi­  
tionsin my meflage to the Senate nomina­  
ting Mr. Murray and others ministers and

only an event of great importance in itself, but  
produced demonstrations of the prejudices, pas­  
sions, views, designs ami systems of parties,  
more perhaps than any other; 1 hope you will  
allow me room for such other papers as may  
serve to throw light upon this subject. At pre­  
sent, it may not be very interesting, but the cause |  
of truth and justice may hereafter be promoted  
by having the facts and evidences laid together  
in a aeries. The future policy of tlis nation will  
not be injured by it.  
Besides the communications already published  
from the sovereign of the French nation, through  
their Minister of Foreign relations, their diplo­  
matic organ at the Hague, 8t our Minister there,  
another was communicated lino’ the same chan­  
nels in these words :  
Copy of a letter Ratal Paris, 11 th FmrtiJor, Gyear  
CAugust &#x27;J8, 1798,f from Mr. Talleyrand, as  
Minister &lt;f l-&#x27;.xteriur Relations, to Mr. Pichon  
Secretary of Legation, Hague.  
TRANSLATION.  
I see with pleasure, citizen, fiat the inter­  
course of society has procured you some political  
conversations with Mr. Murray. I entertain an  
esteem for that Minister.—Like a’l the men at  
the head of the a hairs of the United States, lie  
lias received the impressions which the British  
Cabinet has known how to give agu nst us. He  
thinks the measures of his government just ami  
supports them: but he possesses reason, un­  
derstanding, and a true attachment to his coun­  
try : lie is neither French nor Englidi : he is in­  
genuously an American. I am not at unsurpri­  
sed that lie lias appeared to you to wish sincere­  
ly lor the reconciliation of the two Republics._  
I will, therefore, cheerfully answer the questi­  
ons you put to me, on different points, which ap­  
peared to you, wot to be well cstablishe 1 in his  
mind. - I do not see, between France and the U­  
nited States, any clashing of interest, any cause  
of jealousy. The Americans wish to be fisher­  
men, sailors, manufacturers, and especially hus­  
bandmen. In all these points ofview, their suc­  
cess is more at the expence of England than us.  
Why should we be uhcasy about them ? They  
  
avpire in me cou*uii&lt;iauon oi uieir national exis­  
tence, and it is to our purpose that thev should  
succeed. In fact, we should have decided upon  
very superficial views, to sustain their indepen­  
dence, if the matter was to separate them from  
England, merely to leave them finally insulated a­  
mong themselves, on an extensive sea-coast,  
weak rivaling, and impoverished by each other,  
and torn &gt;iy foreign intrigues. We know that  
Great-Britain would soon have put together,  
piece by piece, those scattered shreds, anti we  
should have done nothing useful ,-for ourselves,  
if so miserable a chance of it, were not daily ten­  
dered more remote.  
Wliat, therefore, is the cause of the misunder­  
standing, which, if France did not manifest her­  
self more wise, would henceforth induce a \io­  
lent rupture between the two Republics ? Nei­  
ther incompatible interests, nor projects of ag­  
grandizement divide them. After all, distrust a­  
lone lias done the whole. The government of  
the United States has thought, that France wan­  
ted to revolutionize it. France has thought that  
the government of the United States wants to  
throw itself into the arms of England. It does  
not require much skill to divine, which is the ca­  
binet interested in the two events producing each  
I other, and which invisibly puts in motion all the  
I expedients calculated to make them take effect  
Let us open our eyes on both sides. I am dis­  
posed do admit that the conduct of the govern­  
ment of the United States may be explained by  
other causes than those heretofore presumed._  
But let it, on its part, understand,!hat the French  
government, wounded as it may be, is t«o wise  
to entertain the views of disturbance, which the  
other supposes. It concerns a republic, found­  
ed on the system of Representation, to support  
and not to ^weaken similar establishments. The  
stability oi this system abroad, is a necessary ex­  
ample at home. France in fine, lias a double mo­  
tive as a nation and as a Republic, not to expose  
to any hazard, the present existence of the Uni­  
ted States. Therefore it never thought of ma­  
king war against them, nor exciting civil commo­  
tions among them : and every contrary supposi­  
tion is ail insult to common sense.  
These fundamental principles being establish­  
ed, it is natural to ask by what fatality, a good  
understanding was not long since restored ! It  
was because irritation being mingled with dis­  
trust, neither party yielded to real conciliatory in­  
  
VIIII4UVHS. ah aim; uiuicu oiaies n was supposed  
tliat the French government was temporizing, in  
order to strike the blow with greator certainty ;  
whence resulted a crowd of measures, more and  
more aggravating. In France, it was supposed  
that the government of the United States, wish­  
ed only the appearances of a negociution, whence  
resulted a ctrtain demandfor pledges of good faith.  
Leins substitute calmness for passion, confi­  
dence for suspicions, and we shall soon agree. I  
used my endeavors to enter upon a negociation  
in this spirit, with Mr. Gerry. My co.respou­  
den**: with him, until the day of his departure,  
is a curious monument of advances on my part,  
and of evasions on lus. It is wrong to think that  
1 confined myself to vague protestations. A­  
mong that series of official Letters, w.iicli will  
doubtless be published at Philadelphia, I select  
one of the 30th Prairial, wherein you will sec  
that I make very positive propositions, without  
any mixture of preliminary conditions. This let­  
ter was followed by three notes upon the Arti­  
cles to be discussed, and I intended to complete  
die others in this manner, if Mr. Gerry had not  
refused to answer thereto.  
When it became necessary to abandoi the i­  
dea of treating with that envoy, who thought it  
important only to know how a negociation might  
thereafter be resumed, I gave him the most so­  
lemn assurances concerning the reception that a  
new plenipotentiary would receive. It was far  
from my thoughts to insinuate that^&#x27;he President  
should send one from the United States, instead  
ol investing with his powers some one who was  
in Europe; far less that the envoy should land  
directly in f ranee, instead of announcing it in  
a neighboring country. 1 wished merely to say,  
that the Executive Directory was so decided for  
a reconciliation, that all tampering would he su­  
perfluous, end an act of confidence in it, would  
excite its own. I should be very badly under­  
stood, if there should he found in my expressions  
a restriction on the nature of the choice which  
the President might make. I wished to encou­  
rage Mr. Gerry by testimonies of regard, that  
his good intentions merited. AlthoHgh 1 could not  
dissemble that lie wanted decision at a moment  
when he might have easily adjusted everything ;  
it (Iocs not thence follow that I designated him j  
I will even avow that I think him too irresolute  
to.!*: fit to hasten the conclusion of an affair of  
this kind. The advantages that 1 prized in him  
are common to all Americans, who have not  
manifested a predilection fop England. Can it  
be f&gt; -lieved that a man who should profess a  
hatted or contempt of the French Republic, or  
should manifest himself the advocate of royalty,  
cun inspire the Directory with a favorable opin­  
ion of the dispositions of the government of  
i lie United States I should have disguised  
the truth, if I had left this matter ambigu­  
ous : it is not to wound the Independence of  
mat government, to point out to a sincere  
friend ef peace, the »li&#x27;, iir he ought to avo d.  
I  
  
As ♦&gt;&gt; tlv mediation of the Batavian Republic  
and of Spain, 1 do not kno w that. there i* anv  
serious question about it, an l it appears t&lt;» n&gt;e, i  
absolutely uncles*. The United Stalls niy*h\
hesitate, in tin* present suite of things, to ij-IVm  
thctnselres to tlieiv impartiality, ami besides l  
see no subject which may not :&gt;c arranged direct­  
Iy‘  
Iknosv thst-the distance wiih sepj*r:it.-&gt;Fr.tnca  
ami the United States opens a vast ti-Ul for i!\oi&gt;  
tlent, and there have been but too in &lt;ny of them.  
Hut the Executive Directory is unshaken in the  
conduct which may best obviate them. The ex­  
cess even of provocations has deadened their ef­  
fect. The government of the United States sur­  
rounds itself with precautions against an i.uagi-!  
nary attack. To stietch the hand to deluded  
friends, isv what one Republic owes to another,  
anti I cannot doubt that, the dignity .of that atti­  
tude will convince the President of cur pacilic dis­  
positions.  
The two governments ought ahove all to b* at­  
tentive to indirect attempts to alienate them still  
more. Their prudence will secure this object)  
anti I shall cite but one example of it. You have j  
told Mr. Man ay the truth respecting Dr. 7.0­  
gun. But I perceive, that oh all hands it is at- |  
tempted to produce a belief in America, that we j  
arc ncgocialing with hitn. On the fib of this !  
month a very insidious paragraph was inserted ‘  
in the •* Bien InfortW.”. It is therein intimated, j  
I that guided by the citiren Thomas Paine, Dr.;  
Logan has made application to the Executive  
Directory, in the character of secret agent. The  
Doctor lias complained of it bitterly to me. He  
has no need of justifying himself concerning a  
matter, the falsity of winch I know better than j  
any body : but ho assured me that having once  
met Thomas Paine, at the house of a third per- j  
son, lie found him so prejudiced against the U* j  
nited States, and so opinionaltve, with resjiect!  
to an influence he neither possesses among them j  
nar us, that he abstained from conversing anv:  
more with him. Moreover, to but short all mis-1  
understanding, I engaged Dr. Logan to postpone j  
till another time, tiie experiments he proposes j  
to make on agriculture, and to return home.— I  
As to Mr. Hitchborn, of Massachusetts, l was j  
even ignorant till now that li« was in Europe, i  
A single word will suilice for the rest.  
.We want nothing blit justice on the part of r  
the United States: we ask it: ivc oiler it to  
their government: it may depend upon the can­  
dor of tlie Executive Directory.  
You will not doubt, citizen, that I approve of  
the communications which your zeal has caused  
you to seek with Mr. Murray, since 1 enable you  
to resume them with official elucidations, Stc.

The two governments ought above all to  
be uttentive to indirect attempts to alicnate  
them still more. Their prudence will secure  
this-@bject, and I shall cite but one - example  
uf it. * You have told Mr. Murray the truth  
respecting Dr. Logen. But 1 perceive, that  
on all Kands it isattempted to produce a  
belief in America, that we ‘are negociating  
with him. . Onthe 7th of this month &amp; very  
insidious paragraph was inserted _in the

Loga te postpone, ill an‘uiber time, the ex­
