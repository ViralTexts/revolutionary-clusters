.  
Having an introduction to Mr. Jefferson, I ascended his little mountain on a fine morning, which gave the situation its due effect. The whole of the sides and base are covered with forest, through which roads have been cut  
			 circularly, so that the winding may be shortened or prolonged at pleasure: the summit is an open lawn, near to the south side of which, the house is built, with its garden just descending the  
			 brow:  
			 the saloon, or central hall, is ornamented with several pieces of antique sculpture, Indian arms, Mammoth bones, and other curiosities collected from various parts of the Union. I found Mr. Jefferson tall in person, but stooping and lean with old age, thus exhibiting that fortunate mode of bodily decay, which strips the frame of its most cumbersome parts, leaving it still strength of  
			 muscle and activity of limb. His deportment was exactly such as the Marquis de Chastellux describes it, above thirty years ago: “At first serious, nay even cold,” but in a very short time relaxing into a most agreeable amenity; with an unabated flow of conversation on the most  
			 interesting topics, discussed in the most gentlemanly, and philosophical manner. I walked with him round his grounds, to visit his pet trees, and improvements of various kinds: during the walk,  
			 he  
			 pointed out to my observation a conical mountain, rising singly at the edge of the southern horizon of the landscape: its distance he said, was 40 miles, and its dimensions those of the greater  
			 Egyptian pyramid; so that it accurately represents the appearance of the pyramid at the same distance; there is a small cleft visible on its summit, through which, the true meridian of Monticello exactly passes: its most singular property, however, is, that on different occasions it looms, or alters its appearance, becoming sometimes cylindrical, sometimes square, and sometimes  
			 assuming the form of an inverted cone. Mr. Jefferson had not been able to connect this phenomenon with any particular season, or state of the atmosphere, except, that it most commonly occurred in the forenoon. He observed, that it was not  
			 only wholly unaccounted for by the laws of vision, but that it had not as yet engaged the attention of philosophers so far as to acquire a name; that of looming, being in fact, a term applied by  
			 sailors, to appearances of a similar kind at sea. The Blue Mountains are also observed to loom, though not in so remarkable a degree.  
*Vide for a more detailed account of this phenomenon in Notes on Virginia, p. 122.  
  
It must be interesting to recall and preserve the political sentiments of a man who has held so distinguished a station in public life as Mr. Jefferson. He seemed to consider much of the freedom and happiness of America, to arise from local circumstances. “Our population,” he observed, “has an elasticity, by which it would fly off from oppressive taxation.” He instanced the beneficial effects of a free  
			 government, in the case of New Orleans, where many proprietors who were in a state of indigence under the dominion of Spain, have risen to sudden wealth, solely by the rise in the value of land, which followed a change of government. Their ingenuity in mechanical inventions, agricultural improvements, and that  
			 mass of general information to be found among Americans of all ranks and conditions, he ascribed to that ease of circumstances, which afforded them leisure to cultivate their minds, after the  
			 cultivation of their lands was completed.—In fact, I have frequently been surprised to find mathematical and other useful works in houses which seemed to have little pretension to the luxury of  
			 learning. Another cause, Mr. Jefferson observed, might be discovered in the many court and county meetings, which brought men frequently together on public business, and thus gave them habits, both of thinking and of expressing  
			 their thoughts on subjects, which in other countries are confined to the consideration of the privileged few. Mr. Jefferson has not the reputation of being very friendly to England: we should, however, be aware, that a partiality in this respect, is not absolutely the duty of an American citizen; neither is it to be expected that the policy of our government should be  
			 regarded in foreign countries, with the same complacency with which it is looked upon by ourselves: but whatever may be his sentiments in this respect, politeness naturally repressed any  
			 offensive  
			 expression of them: he talked of our affairs with candour, and apparent good-will, though leaning, perhaps, to the gloomier side of the picture. He did not perceive by what means we could be  
			 extricated from our present financial embarrassments, without some kind of revolution in our government: on my replying, that our habits were remarkably steady, and that great sacrifices would be  
			 made to prevent a violent catastrophe, he acceded to the observation, but demanded, if those who made the sacrifices, would not require some political reformation in return. His repugnance was  
			 strongly marked to the despotic principles of Bonaparte, and he seemed to consider France under Louis XVI. as scarcely capable of a republican form of government; but added, that the present generation of Frenchmen had grown up with sounder notions, which would probably lead to their  
			 emancipation.

 dated 18th October, 1815, and published in the American Newspapers:  
Here follows a faithful transcription of TJ’s letter to George Logan of 15 (not 18) Oct. 1815, printed above at that date and accordingly omitted here.  
The same anxiety for his country’s independence seems to have led him to a change of opinion on the relative importance of manufactories in America. He thus expresses himself, in answer to an address from the American society for the encouragement of manufactories: “I have read with great satisfaction, the eloquent pamphlet you were so  
			 kind as to send me, and sympathise with every line of it. I was once a doubter, whether the labour of the cultivator, aided by the creative powers of the earth itself, would not produce more  
			 value  
			 than that of the manufacturer alone, and unassisted by the dead subject on which he acted; in other words, whether the more we could bring into action of the energies of our boundless territory,  
			 in  
			 addition to the labour of our citizens, the more would not be our gain. But the inventions of the latter times, by labour-saving machines, do as much now for the manufacturer, as the earth for  
			 the  
			 cultivator. Experience too, has proved that mine was but half the question; the other half is, whether dollars and cents are to be weighed in the scale against real independence. The question is  
			 then  
			 solved, at least so far as respects our own wants. I much fear the effect on our infant establishment, of the policy avowed by Mr. Brougham, and quoted in the pamphlet. Individual British merchants may lose by the late immense importations; but British commerce and manufactories, in the mass will gain, by beating down the  
			 competition of ours in our own markets, &amp;c.”  
The conversation turning on American history, Mr. Jefferson related an anecdote of the Abbé Raynal, which serves to shew how history, even when it calls itself philosophical, is written. The Abbé was in company with Dr. Franklin, and several Americans at Paris, when mention chanced to be made of his anecdote of Polly Baker, related in his sixth volume, upon which one of the company observed, that no such law as that alluded to in the story, existed in New England: the Abbé stoutly maintained the authenticity of his tale, when Dr. Franklin, who had hitherto remained silent, said, “I can account for all this; you took the anecdote from a newspaper, of which I was at that time editor, and, happening to be very short of news, I  
			 composed and inserted the whole story.” “Ah! Doctor,” said the Abbé making a true French retreat, “I had rather have your stories, than other men’s truths.”  
Mr. Jefferson preferred Botta’s Italian History of the American Revolution, to any that had yet appeared, remarking, however, the inaccuracy of the speeches. Indeed, the true history of that period seems to be generally  
			 considered as lost: A remarkable letter on this point, lately appeared in print, from the venerable Mr. John Adams, to a Mr. Niles, who had solicited his aid to collect and publish a body of revolutionary speeches. He says, “of all the speeches made in Congress, from 1774 to 1777, inclusive, of both years, not one sentence remains, except a few periods of Dr. Witherspoon, printed in his works.” His concluding sentence is very strong. “In plain English, and in a few words, Mr. Niles, I consider the true history of the American revolution, and the establishment of our present constitutions, as lost for ever; and nothing but misrepresentations, or partial accounts of it,  
			 will ever be recovered.”  
I slept a night at Monticello, and left it in the morning, with such a feeling as the traveller quits the mouldering remains of a Grecian temple, or the pilgrim a fountain in the desert. It would indeed argue great  
			 torpor, both of understanding and heart, to have looked without veneration and interest, on the man who drew up the declaration of American independence; who shared in the councils by which her  
			 freedom was established; whom the unbought voice of his fellow-citizens called to the exercise of a dignity, from which his own moderation impelled him, when such example was most salutary, to  
			 withdraw; and who, while he dedicates the evening of his glorious days to the pursuits of science and literature, shuns none of the humbler duties of private life; but, having filled a seat  
			 higher  
			 than that of kings, succeeds with graceful dignity to that of the good neighbour, and becomes the friendly adviser, lawyer, physician, and even gardener of his vicinity. This is the “still small  
			 voice” of philosophy, deeper and holier than the lightnings and earthquakes which have preceded it. What monarch would venture thus to exhibit himself in the nakedness of his humanity? On what  
			 royal  
			 brow would the laurel replace the diadem? But they who are born and educated to be kings, are not expected to be philosophers. This is a just answer, though no great compliment either to the  
			 governors or the governed.  
My travels had nearly terminated at the Rivannah, which flo

were so kind as to send me, and sympathise with every line of it. I  
was once a doubter whether the labour of the cultivator, aided by the  
creative powers of the earth-itself, would not produce more than that  
of the manufacturer alone, and unassisted by the dead subject on

‘ Having an introduction to Mr. Jefferson, I ascended his little moun:  
tain on a fine morning, which gave the situation its due effect. The  
whole of the sides and base are covered with forest, through which  
roads have been cut circularly, so that the winding may be shortened  
or proionged at pleasure: the summit is an open lawn, near to the  
south side of which, the house is built, with its garden just descending  
the brow: the saloon, or central hall, is ornamented with several pieces  
of antique sculpture, Indian arms, Mammoth bones, and other curiosi-  
ties collected from various parts of the Union. I found Mr. Jefferson  
tall in person, but stooping and lean with old age, thus exhibiting that  
fortunate mode of bodily decay, which strips the frame of its most  
cumbersome parts, leaving it still strength of muscle and activity of  
litxb. His deportment was exactly such as the Marquis de Chastellux  
describes it, above thirty years ago: “ At first serious, nay even cold,”  
but in a very short time relaxing into a most agreeable amenity; with  
an unabated flow of conversation on the most interesting topics, discus-  
sed in the most gentlemanly, and philosophical manner. I walked with  
him round his grounds, to visit his pet trees, and improvements of vari-  
ous kinds: during the walk, he pointed out to my observation a conical  
mountain, rising singly at the edge of the southern horizon of the land-  
scape: its distance he said, was 40 miles, and its dimensions those of  
the greater Egyptian pyramid; so that it accurately represents the ap-  
pearance of the pyramid at the same distance; there is a small cleft vi-  
sible on its summit, through which, the true meridian of Monticello  
exactly passes: its most singular property, however, is, that on diffe-  
rent occasions it looms, or alters its appearance, becoming sometimes  
cylindrical, sometimes square, and sometimes assuming the form of an  
inverted cone.’

sixth volume, upon which one of the company observed, that no such  
law as that alluded to in the story, existed in New Engiand: the Abbé  
stoutly maintained the authenticity of his tale, when Dr. Franklin, who  
had hitherto remained silent, said, “ I can account for alli this; you took  
the anecdote from a newspaper, of which I was at that time editor, and,

great torpor, both of understanding and heart, to have looked without

American independence; who shared in the councils by which her free-  
dom was established; whom the unbought voice of his fellow-citizens  
called to the exercise of a dignity, from which his own moderation im-  
pelled him, when such example was most salutary, to withdraw; and  
who, while he dedicates the evening of his glorious days to the pursuits  
of science and literature, shuns none of the humbler duties of private

Haying an introduction to Mr. J(?fferson  
ascended his little mountain mi a  
hae morning, which gave the situation its  
due c fleet. The whole of the sides and  
ijasel are covered with forest, through  
which roads have- been cut circularly, so  
tiliatithe, winding may be shortened or  
Prolonged at pleasure : the summit is an  
fipeii Inwn, near &#x27;to th south side of which  
the house is built&#x27;, with its- garden just de  
scending the brow ; the saloon; or cen-  
ral hall, is ornamented with several piec­  
es of antifiuey sculpture, Indian arms,  
mam&#x27;1 ..nth bone., and other, curiosities  
collected from .various parts of the Un-  
ion  
I walked with him &#x27;round his grounds  
to visit pet trees andj improvements bl va-  
rious kinds, i Daring the walk, he pointed  
oMt to my (Observation a conical mountain,  
rismg&#x27;singly !at the edge of the southern  
hori.on of the landscape ; its distanpe he  
said wias forty miles, and its dimensions  
those of the greater Egyptian pyramid at  
thei &#x27;same distance ; there is a small cleft  
visible on its summit, through: which the  
true nieridia  
1 of MoMtiaello exactly pas-  
ses : its most  
singular property, nowe  
ver, is that Ondiiie rent .occasions, Jt looms  
or alters its appearance, .becoming: some  
times cvHndrical, sometimes assuming the  
linn of an inye rted  
cone.  
Mr.  
Jeffer-  
sox, liaa not dpch auie couneci mis.  
phenomenon with any particular season  
or state of the atmospliere, except that it  
most commonly occurrediu the forenoon.  
He observed, .that it was not only who!!  
unaccounted for by the laws of vision.  
but that it has not as yet engaged the at  
tention of philosophers so far as to ac-  
&#x27; .j. i 1 . L 1 .

fact, a term apphed by sailors to appear­  
ances of a similar kind at sea. The Blue

thdugli not in so remarkable aiegree.  
It must be interesting to recal and pre­  
serve the political sentiments of a man  
who has held so distinguished a station in  
public life as Mr. Jefferson. He seemed  
to consider much of the freedom and hap  
piness of tlie American people to arise  
from local circumstances.-&quot; Our popula­  
tion,&quot; he observed, has an elasticity, by  
which it would fly off from oppressivetax­  
adon.7 He instanced the beneficial ef­  
fects of a free government, in the case of  
N. Orleans, where many proprietors, who  
were in a state of indigence under the do  
minion of Spain, have risen to a state of

-The conversation turning on American  
history, Mr. J. related an anecdote of the  
Abbe liaynal, which seryes to siiew now  
history even-when it Calls itself philoso  
phical, is written. I he Abbe wasm Com-  
nanv with Dr. tranklin, and several a-  
mericans at Paris, when mention chanced:  
to be made of his anecdote of Polly i5a-  
ker, related in his 6th volume, upon which  
one of the company observed, that no  
such law as that alluded to in the story ex-j  
isted in New England ; the Abbe stoutly  
maintained the authenticity of his tale,;  
when Dr. Franklin, who had hitherto re  
mained silent, said,&quot; I jcan account for all  
this .; you took the anecdote from a news­  
paper, of which 1 was at that lime editor :  
and, happeningo be very short ql news,l  
i( , ,,nrtor said the Abbe, making a  
f French retreat. &quot; I had rather have  
vour stories than other men&#x27;s truths.  
&quot; &#x27; Bfr. Jefferson preferred Botta&#x27;s Italian  
Historv of the American revolution to  
f any that had yet appeared, remarking how  
ever the inaccuracy of thp speeches. In  
deed the true history  
of that period seems  
to be generally considered as lost : A re  
markable letter on ims ponu laxeiy aj  
neared in print, from ! thcvenerable jVlr  
John Adams to a Mr. Niles, who had so1  
cited his aid to collect and publish a bej

in a few  
sv words, JMr, &#x27; Niles, 1 consider the  
true history of the American revolution,  
and the establishment of our present corj-.j

but misrepresentations or partial accounts

‘ I slept a night at Monticello, and left it in the morning, with  
such a feeling as the traveller quits the mouldering remains of a  
Grecian temple, or the pilgrim a fountain in the desert. It would  
indeed argue great torpor, both of understanding and heart, to have  
looked without veneration and interest, on the man who drew up the  
declaration of American independence; who shared in the councils  
by which her freedom was established ; whom the unbought voice of  
his fellow-citizens called to the exercise of a dignity, from which his  
own moderation impelled him, when such example was most salutary,  
to withdraw ; and who, while he dedicates the evening of his glori-  
ous days to the pursuits of science and literature, shuns none of the  
humbler duties of private life ; but, having filled a seat higher than  
that of kings, succeeds with graceful dignity to that of the good  
neighbour, and becomes the friendly adviser, lawyer, physician, and  
even gardener of his vicinity. This is the “ still small voice” of  
philosophy, deeper and holier than the lightnings and earthquakes  
which have preceded it. What monarch’ would venture thus to ex-  
hibit himself in the nakedness of his humanity? On what royal  
brow would the laurel replace the diadem?’ Hall, 384, 385.

a hospitable reception from Mr. Jeffer-  
son the late President of the United  
States.  
  
“1 found Mr. Jefferson tall in person,  
but stooping and Jean with old age, thus  
exhibiting that fortunate mode of bodily  
decay, which strips the frame of its.most  
cumbersome parts, leaving it stil} strength  
of muscle and activity of limb. His de-  
portment was exactly such as the Marquis  
de Chastellus describes it, above thirty  
years ago; “ At first serious, nay even

cold,” but in a very short tume relaxing  
into a most agreeable amenity; with an  
unabated flow of couversation on the most  
interesting topics, discussed in the most  
gentlemanly, and philosophical manner.  
I walked with him round his grounds, to  
visit his pet trees, and improvements of  
various kinds; during the walk, he pointed  
out to my observation a conical mountain,  
rising singly at the edge of the southern  
horizon of the landscape: its distance he  
said, was forty miles, and its dimensions  
those of the greater Egyptian pyramid ; so  
that it accurately represents the appear-  
ance of the pyramid at the same distance ;  
there is a small cleft visible ou its submit,  
through which, the true meridian of Mon-  
ticello exactly passes: its most singular  
property, however, is, that on different  
occasious it looms or alters its appearance,  
becoming sometimes cylindrical, some-  
times square, and sometimes assuming the  
form of an inverted cone. Mr. Jefferson  
had not been able to counect this pheno-  
menon with any particular season, or state  
of the atmosphere, except, that it most  
commonly concurred inthe forenoon. Ele  
observed, that it was not only wholly un-  
accounted for by the laws of vision, but  
that it had not as yet engaged the atten-  
tion of philosophers, su far as to acquire a  
name; that of looming, being in fact, a  
term applied by sailors, to appearances of  
a similar kind at sea. The blue Mountains  
are also observed to loom, though not in  
so remarkable a degree.&quot;  
  
“It must be interesting to recall and  
preserve the political sentiments of a man  
who has held so distinguished a station in  
public life as Mr. Jefferson. He seemed  
to consider much of the freedom and hap-  
piness of America, to arise from local cir-  
cumstances. “ Our population, he ob-  
served, “ has an elasticity, by which it  
would fly off from oppressive taxation.”  
He instanced the beneficial effects of a  
free government in the case of New Or-  
leans, where many proprietors who were  
in a state of indigence under the dominion  
of Spain, have risen to a sudden wealth,  
solely by the rise in the value, of land,  
which followed a change of government.

Their ingenuity in mechanical inventions,  
agricultural improvements, and that mass  
of general information to be found among  
Americans of all ranks and conditions, he  
ascribed to that ease of circumstances,  
which affords them leisure to cultivate their  
minds, after the cultivation of their lands  
was completed.—In fact, | have frequently  
been surprised to find mathematical and  
other useful works in houses which seemed  
to have little pretention to the luxury of  
learning. Another cause, Mr. Jefferson  
observed, might be discovered in the many  
court and county meetings, which brought  
men frequently together on public busi-  
ness, and thus gave them habits both of  
thinking and expressing their thoughts on  
subjects, which in other countries are con-  
fined to the consideration of the privileged  
few. Mr. Jefferson has not the reputa-  
tion of being very friendly to England:  
we should, however, be aware, that a par-  
tiality in this respect, is not absolutely the  
duty of an American citizen ; neither is it  
to be expected that the policy of our go-  
vernment should be regarded in foreign  
countries, with the same complacency with  
which it is looked upon by ourselves :  
but whatever may be his sentiments in  
this respect, politeness naturally repressed  
any offensive expression of them: he  
talked of our affairs with candour, and  
apparent good-will, though leaning, per-  
haps, to the gloomier side of the picture.  
He did not perceive by what means we  
could be extricated from our preseut finan-  
cial embarrassments, without some kind  
of revolution in our government: on my  
replying, that our habits were remarkably  
steady, and that great sacrifices would be  
made to prevent a violent catastrophe, he  
acceded to the observation, but demanded,  
if those who made the sacrifices, would  
not require some political reformation in  
return. His repugnance was_ strongly  
marked to the despotic principles of Bona-  
parte, and seemed to consider France  
under Louis XVI. as scarcely capable of  
a republican form of government; but  
added, that the present generation of  
Frenchmen had grown up with sounder  
notions, which would probably lead to  
their emancipation.”
