, 15 Dec. 1799]  
  
The following circumstantial account of the last illness and death of General Washington was noted by T. Lear, on Sunday following his death, which happened on Saturday Eveng Decr 14th 1799 between the hours of ten and eleven.  
On Thursday Decr 12th the General rode out to his farms about ten o’clock, and did not return home till past 3 oclk. Soon after he went out, the weather became very bad, rain hail and snow falling alternately, with a cold wind. When he came in I carried some letters to him, to frank, intending to send them to the Post Office in the evening. He franked the letters; but said the weather was too bad to send a Servant up to the Office that evening. I observed to him that I was afraid he had got wet, he said no, his great coat had kept him dry; but his neck appeard to be wet, and the snow was hanging on his hair. He came to dinner without changing his dress. In the Evening he appeard as well as usual.  
A heavy fall of snow took place on friday, which prevented the General from riding out as usual. He had taken cold (undoubtedly from being so much exposed the day before) and complained of having a sore throat—he had a hoarseness, which increased in the evening; but he made light of it, as he would never take anything to carry off a cold; always observing, “let it go as it came.” In  
  
the evening, the papers having come from the post Office, he sat in the room, with Mrs Washington and myself, reading them, ’till about nine o’clock, and, when he met with anything which he thought diverting or interesting, he would read it aloud. He desired me to read to him the debates of the Virginia Assembly, on the election of a Senator and Governor; which I did. On his retiring to bed, he appeared to be in perfect health, excepting the cold before mentiond, which he considerd as triffling, and had been remarkably chearful all the evening.  
About two or three o’clk Saturday Morning he awoke Mrs Washington &amp; told her he was very unwell, and had had an ague. She observed that he could scarcely speak, and breathed with difficulty—and would have got up to call a servant; but he would not permit her lest she should take cold. As soon as the day appeared, the Woman (Caroline) went into the Room to make a fire &amp; he desired that Mr Rawlins, one of the Overseers who was used to bleeding the people, might be sent for to bleed him before the Docter could arrive—And the Woman (Caroline) came to my room requesting I might go to the General, who was very ill. I got up[,] put on my Cloths as quick as possible, and went to his Chamber. Mrs Washington was then up, and related to me his being taken ill about 2 or 3 o’clk, as before stated. I found him breathing with difficulty—and hardly able to utter a word intelligibly—I went out instantly—and wrote a line to Dr Craik, which I sent off by my Servant, ordering him to go with all the swiftness his horse could carry him, and immediately returned to the General’s Chamber, where I found him in the same situation I had left him. A mixture of Molasses, Vinegar &amp; butter was prepared, to try its effect in the throat; but he could not swallow a drop, whenever he attempted it he appeard to be distressed, convulsed, and almost suffocated. Mr Rawlins came in soon after sun rise—and prepared to bleed him. When the Arm was ready—the General, observing that Rawlins appeard to be agitated, said, as well as he could speak, “don’t be afraid,” and after the incision was made, he observed “the oriface is not large enough.” However, the blood ran pretty freely. Mrs Washington, not knowing whether bleeding was proper or not in the Generals situation; beg’d that much might not be taken from him, lest it should be injurious, and desired me to stop it; but when I was about to untie the string, the general put up his hand to prevent it, and as soon as he could speak, he said “more.”  
  
Mrs W. being still uneasy lest too much blood should be taken, it was stop’d after about half a pint was taken from him. Finding that no relief was obtaind from bleeding, and that nothing would go down the throat, I proposed bathing the throat externally with Salvalaltita, which was done, and in the operation, which was with the hand, and in the gentlest manner, he observed ’tis very sore. A piece of flannel was then put round his neck His feet were also soaked in warm water. This, however, gave no relief. In the mean time, before Docter Craik arrivd, Mrs Washington requested me to send for Doctr Brown of Port Tobacco, whom Docter Craik had recommended to be called, if any case should ever occur that was seriously alarming. I dispatched a Messenger (Cyrus) to Dr Brown immediately (about nine o’clk)—Docter Craik came in soon after, and upon examining the General he put a blister of cantharides on the throat &amp; took more blood from him, and had some Vinegar &amp; hot water put into a Teapot, for the General to draw in the steam from the nozel—which he did, as well as he was able. He also orderd sage tea and Vinegar to be mixed for a Gargle. This the General used as often as desired; but when he held back his head to let it run down, it put him into great distress and almost produced suffocation. When the mixture came out of his mouth som[e] phlegm followed it, and he woud attempt to cough, which the Docter encouraged him to do as much as he could; but without effect, he could only make the attempt. About eleven o’clock Dr Dick was sent for. Docter Craik bled the General again about this time. No effect, however was produced by it, and he continued in the same state, unable to swallow anything. Docter Dick came in about 3 o’clk, and Dr Brown arrived soon after. Upon Dr Dick’s seeing the Genl &amp; consulting a few minutes with Dr Craik, he was bled again, the blood ran slowly—appeared very thick, and did not produce any symptoms of fainting. Docter Brown came into the Chamber soon after, and upon feeling the Generals pulse &amp;c. the Physicians went out together. Dr Craik soon after returned. The General could now swallow a little (about 4 o’clk)—Calomil &amp; tarter em. were administered; but without any effect. About half past 4 o’clk, he desired me to ask Mrs Washington to come to his bed side—when he requested her to go down into his room &amp; take from his desk two Wills which she would find there, and bring them to him, which she did. Upon looking at them he gave her [one] which he observed was useless,  
  
as it was superceeded by the other, and desired her to burn it, which she did, and then took the other &amp; put it away. After this was done, I returned again to his bed side and took his hand. He said to me, “I find I am going, my breath cannot continue long, I beleived, from the first attack it would be fatal, do you arrange &amp; record all my late Military letters &amp; papers—arrange my accounts &amp; settle my books, as you know more about them than anyone else, and let Mr Rawlins finish recording my other letters, which he has begun.” He asked “when Mr Lewis &amp; Washington would return”? I told him I beleived about the 20th of the month. He made no reply to it. The Physicians again came in (between 5 &amp; 6 o’clk) and when they came to his bed side, Dr Craik asked him if he could sit up in the bed. He held out his hand to me &amp; was raised up, when he said to the Physicians. “I feel myself going, you had better not take any more trouble about me; but let me go off quietly; I cannot last long.” They found what had been done was without effect—he laid down again and they retired excepting Dr Craik. He then said to him, “Docter, I die hard, but I am not afraid to go, I beleived from my first attack that I shd not survive it, my breath cannot last long.” The Docter pressed his hand but could not utter a word. He retired from the bed side—and sat by the fire absorbed in grief. About 8 o’clk the Physicians again came into the Room, and applied blisters to his legs, but went out without a ray of hope. From this time he appeared to breath with less difficulty than he had done; but was very restless, constantly changing his position to endeavour to get ease. I aided him all in my power, and was gratified in beleiving he felt it; for he would look upon me with his eyes speaking gratitude; but unable to utter a word without great distress. About ten o’clock he made several attempts to speak to me before he could effect it—at length, he said, “I am just going, Have me decently buried, and do not let my body be put into the Vault in less than two days after I am dead.” I bowed assent. He looked at me again, and said “Do you understand me”—I replied Yes, Sir, “Tis well,” said he. About ten minutes before he expired his breathing became much easier—he lay quietly—he withdrew his hand from mine &amp; felt his own pulse—I spoke to Dr Craik who sat by the fire—he came to the bed side. The Generals hand fell from his wrist—I took it in mine and laid it upon my breast—Dr Craik put his hands over his eyes and he expired without a struggle or a Sigh! While we were fixed in silent grief—Mrs Washington asked, with a firm &amp; collected Voice, “Is he gone.” I could  
  
not speak, but held up my hand as a signal that he was. “Tis well” said she, in a firm voice “Tis All now over. I have no more trials to pass through. I shall soon follow him![”]  
Occurences not noted in the preceding pages—  
The General’s servant, Christopher, attended his bed side &amp; in the room, when he was sitting up, through his whole illness. About 8 o’clk in the Morng the General expressed a wish to get up. His clothes were put on, and he was led to a Chair, by the fire. He lay down again about two hours afterwards. A glister was administerd to him, by Dr Craik’s directions, about one o’clock; but produced no effect. He was helped up again about 5 o’clock—and after sitting about an hour, he desired to be undressed and put in bed, which was done. Between the hours of 6 and nine o’clk, he several times asked what hour it was. During his whole illness, he spoke but seldom &amp; with great difficulty and distress, and in so low &amp; broken a voice as at times hardly to be understood. His patience, fortitude &amp; resignation never foresook him for a moment. In all his distress he uttered not a sigh nor a complaint, always endeavoring to take what was offered him, or to do what was desired.  
At the time of his decease Dr Craik &amp; myself were in the situation before mentioned. Christopher was standing by the Bedside. Mrs Washington was sitting near the foot of the bed. Caroline, Charlotte, and some other of the servants were standing in the Room near the door. Mrs Forbes, the House-keeper, was frequently in the Room in the day &amp; evening. In the afternoon the General observing that Christopher had been standing by his bed side for a long time—made a motion for him to sit in a chair which stood by the bedside.  
As soon as Dr Craik could speak, after the distressing scene was closed, he desired one of the servants to ask the Gentlemen below to come up stairs. When they came around the bed, I kissed the cold hand, which I had ’till then held, laid it down, went to the fire and was for some time lost in profound grief, until aroused by Christopher desiring me to take care of the General’s keys and things which he had taken out of his pockets, and which Mrs Washington directed him to give to me. I wraped them up in the General’s Handkerchief, and took them with me down stairs; About 12 o’clk the Corps was brought down and laid out in the large Room

She observed that he could hardly speak, and breathed with difficul-

would not permit her, lest she should take cold. As soonas the  
  
fire, and the girl desired that Mr. Rawhing, one of the overseers, who  
was used to bleeding the people, might be sent for to bleed him be-  
fore the Doctor could arrive. 1 was sent fur—went to the Gene-  
ral’s chamber, where Mrs. Washington was up, and related to me  
his being taken ill between two and three o’ctock, as before stated.  
{ found him breathing with difficulty, and hardly able to utter a  
word intelligibly went out instantly and wrote a line to Doctor  
Plask, and sent it with all speed. Immediately I returned to the  
General’s chumber, where I found him in the same situation I had  
lefllom. A mixture of molasses, vinegar and butter tee pe gg  
but he could not swallow #@rop; whenever he attempted, he was  
distressed, convulsed, asid almost suffocated.  
  
Mr. Rawlins came in soon after sun rise and prepared to bleed  
him ; when the asus was rcady the éseneral observing Rawlics ap  
  
peared agitated: said with difficulty * don’t be afraid,” and after  
the incision was made he observed, the orifice was not large evsough  
—however the blood ran pretty freely Mrs. Washington not kuow-  
ing whether bleeding was proper in the General’s situation, begged  
that much mighi not be taken from him, and desired me to stop it.  
When I was about to untie the string, the General put up his hand  
to prevent it, and, as soon as he could speak, said ** more.”  
  
Irs Washington being still 7 lest too much blood should be  
taken, it was stopped after about half a pint had beentaken. Find-  
ing that no relief was obtained from bleeding, and that nothing  
could be swallowed, | proposed bathing the throat externally with  
salvolatile, which was done ; a piece of flannel was then put round  
his neck. His feet were also soaked in warm water, but that gave  
no relief. By Mrs. Washington’s request, I despa:ched a messen-  
ger to Dr. Brown, at Port Tobasco. About 9 o’clock Dr Craik ar-  
rived, and rut a blister of cantharides on the throat of the General,  
and took more blood, and had some vinegar and hot water set ina  
tea pot for him to draw in steam from the nosel.  
  
He aiso had sage tea and vinegar mixed and used as a gargle, but  
when he held back his head to let it rundown, it almost produced  
suffocation.  
phlegm followed it, and he would attempt to cough, which the  
  
octur encouraged, but without effect. About 11 o’clock Doctor  
Dick was sent for. Doct. Craik bled the General again; no effect

swallow a little. Calome! and tartar emetic were administered  
without effect. Atout half past four o’clock he desired me to ask  
Mrs. Washington to come to his bed side, when he desired her to go

; »g taken ill between l2aml-3 o’clock, as before  
stated. 1 found him breathing with difficulty,  
and hardly able to utter a w&#x27;tird intelligibly. I  
went out instantly and xvrote a line to I)r. Plask,  
ft.id sent it xvith all speed. Immediately 1 returu­  
-d to the General’s chamber, xvhere 1 found him  
in the same situation I had left him. A mixture  
of molasses, vinegar and butler xvas prepared, but  
he could not swallow a drop; whenever he at­  
........* ..1 I.a u/oc ili^iru^uxl convulsed and almost  
  
zy—, -  
suffocated.  
Mr. Rawlins came in soon after son-rise and  
prepared to bleed him; when the arm was ready  
rhe General observing Rawlins appeared agitated;  
said with difficulty “dontbe afraid,” and after  
the incision was made he observed the orilicc was  
uot large enough—however the blood ran pretty  
freely. Mrs. Washington not knowing whether  
bleeding was proper in the General&#x27;s situation  
begged that much might not be taken from him,  
and desired ine to stop it. When 1 was about  
to untie the string, the General put up his band  
to prevent it, auu soon as he could speak said  
“ more.**  
Mrs. Washington still uneasy lest much blood  
should be taken, it was stopped after about half  
ft pint had been taken. Finding that no relief  
tvas obtained troin bleeding, and that nothing  
could be swallowed, I promised bathing the throat  
externally with sal volatile, which was done; a  
piece of flannel was then put round his neck.—  
His feet were also soaked in warm water but gave  
no relief By Mrs. Washington’s request 1 de­  
spatched a messenger for Doctor Blown at Port  
Tobacco. About 9 o’clock Doct. Craik arrived  
and put a blister of cantharides on the throat of  
tho General, and took more blood, and had some  
vinegar and hot water set iu a tea pot for him to  
draw in the steam from the nose!.  
He also had sage tea and vinegar mixed and  
used as a gargle, but when he held back his head  
to let it run down, it almost produced suffocation.  
When the mixture came out of his mouth some  
phlegm followed it,and he would attempt to cough  
which the Doctor encouraged, but without effect.  
About 11 o&#x27;clock, Doct. Dick was sent for, Doct.  
Craik bled the Geo. again, no effect was produc­  
ed, and he continued in the same state unable to  
swallow any thing. Doct D. came in about S  
o’clock, and Doct. Brown arrived soon after;  
v^ien, after consultation the Gen. was bled again,  
the blood ran slowly, appeared very thick and did  
not produce any symptoms of faulting. At 4 o’­  
clock the General could swallow a little, Calo- ]  
mal and tartar emetic were administered without 1  
effect Abut half pa?t 4 he desired me to ask &#x27;  
  
Mrs. Washington to come to his bedside, wiitu  
he desired her to go down to his room, and take  
from his desk two Wills which she would find &amp;  
bring them to him, which she did; upon looking  
at one, which he observed was useless, he desir­  
ed her to burn it, which she did. and then took  
the other and put it away; after this was done I  
returned again to his bed side and took his hahd:  
He said to me. “I find 1 am going—my breath  
cannot continue long: I believed from the first at­  
tack it would be fatal. Do you arrange and re­  
cord all my military letters and papers; arrange  
my accounts and settle my books, as you know  
more about them than any one else: and let Mr.  
Rawlins finish my other letters, which he has bc­  
»un.” lie asked when Mr. Lewis and Wash­  
ington would return? I told him I believed about  
the 20th of the month—He made no reply to it.  
The physicians again came in (between 5 and G  
o’clock) and when they came to his bedside. Dr.  
Craik asked him if he would sit up in the bed:  
he held out his hand to me and was raised tip, when  
he said to the physicians—“ 1 feel mysell going;  
vou had better not take any more trouble about  
me, but let me go oft quietly; I cannot last long. ’  
They found what had been done was without ef­  
fect; he laid down again and they retired except­  
ing Dr. Craik. He then said to him, “ Doctor,  
l die hard but not afraid to go; 1 believed ftom  
mv first attack 1 should not survive it; my breath  
cannot last long.” The Dr. pressed his hand but  
could not utter a word; he retired from the bed­  
side and sat by the fire, absorbed in grief. About  
8 o’clock, the physicians again came into the room,  
and applied blisters to his legs; but went out with­  
out a ray of hope.——From this time he appeared  
to breathe with less difficulty than he had done;  
but was very restless, continually changing his  
position, to endeavor to get ease. I aided him  
al! in my power, and was gratified in believing  
he felt it, for lie would look upon me wjth eyes  
speaking gratitude,but ttuable to utter a wot d with­  
out great distress. About 10 o’clock he made  
several attempts to speak to me before he could  
effect it; at length he said, “ l ant just going.—  
Have me decently buried; and do not let my bo­  
dy be put into the vault in less than two days af­  
teter l am dead.” I bowed assent. He looked  
at me again and said—“ Do you understand me?”  
i puniii&gt;it^.o Yv« sir.” t*&#x27;Tis well:” said he.—  
  
About ten minutes before he expired, his breath­  
ing became much easier—he lay quietly—he with­  
drew his hand from mine, and fell his own pulse.  
1 spoke to Dr.Craik, who sat by tlie fire: he came  
to the bed side. The General’s hand fell from  
bis wrist; 1 took it in mine and placed it on my  
breast. l)r. Craik placed his hands over his eyes;  
and he expired without a struggle or a sigh.  
While we weie fixed in silent grief, Mrs. Wash­  
ington asked, in a linn and collected voice, — *Is

INGTON, was noted by Mr. ‘l&#x27;obias Lear, on  
the Saturday evening, December 14, 1799,  
between the hours of ten and eleven: he was  
born on the 220 February, 1732.  
* On Thursday, Decciber 12th, the Gen­  
eral rode out to his farme at about 10 o&#x27;clock,  
end did not return lill past 3. Soon after he  
went out the weather was very bad; rain, hail  
end snow, falling alternately, with s cold  
wind. When he came in, | earriod some let­  
ters (o him to frank, intending to send them  
to the Post Office. He franked the letters, but  
said the weather was 100 bad to send a  
servaut to the office that evening. I observed  
10 him that be had got wet; he said no- his  
grest coat had kept him dry; but his neck  
uppeared 10 be wet—tho snow was hanging  
on his hair.  
  
Ile came to dinner without changing his  
dress. In the evening he sppeared as well  
63 usual. A Leavy fall of snow took place  
on Friday, whieh prevented the General from  
Iding out as usual, He had taken cold (un­  
doubledly from heing so much exposed the  
day before,) and complained of having a sore  
tiroat: he had o horseness, which increased  
in the evemug, but he made light of it, ue he  
would never take any thing to carry off a  
cold,—always observing, ‘letit go as it came.’  
In the evening, the papers haviag come from  
the Post Ofice, he satin the room, with Mrs.  
Washington and myself, reading them, till  
übout U o&#x27;clock: and when he met with any  
thing which he thought diverting or interest-

F:nding that no relief was obtained from

ths fegt was then soaked in warm water, but

I despatched a messenger for f)r. Biown st

arrived, and put a blister of cantharides on  
the throat of the General, and took more  
blood, and had some vinegar and hot water

bled the General again, no effect was pro­  
duced, and he continued in the same state  
unsble to swallow any thing. Dr. Dick came  
in about 3 o&#x27;clock, and Dr. Brown atriwed‘  
soon afler; when after consultation the Gen:  
eral was bled sgain, the blood ran slowly,  
appeared ve? thick and did not produce any  
symptoms of fainting. At four o’clock the  
iGcnctal could swallow a little. Calomel and  
tartar emetics were administered without ef­  
fect. About half past four o&#x27;clock he desired  
me to ask Mrs. Washington to come to his  
bed side, when he de sired her to go down to  
‘his room, and take from his desk two Wlls  
which she would find there, and bring them

Liewis and Washington would return. I told  
him 1 believed about the 20th of the month—  
he made no reply to it.  
The ph(aiciana again came in between 5

up in bed ; he held out his hand to me and

Doctor pressed his hand, but could not utter

The follow ing riinim&lt;Tantial account of tho  
last illness and death of Oimi.il Geori.e  
VY asmingtoiv, was noted by J’ohias Gear, on  
Sunday following his &lt;1&lt; atli. which happened  
on Saturday evening, Decenibei I4tb. 1729,  
between (he h-tirs often and eleven! he was  
born on the 22d February, &gt;78-2.  
“On Thursday, Pee r 12th, th&quot; General  
rode out to his lartns at about 10 o&#x27;clock,  
and did not return home till past d. Soon  
sftorhc went nut, the weather became very  
bad, rain, bail and snow falling alternately,  
with a cold wind. VYrheu he came in. I car  
rieil some letters to him to Trank, intending&#x27;  
to send them to the Post Obi, e Hu Irankfd  
the letters, but said the weather was loo |&gt;&gt;d  
to send a servant to the ofli r that evening, I  
observed to biro that I was afraid he had  
got wet; he sard no—hi* great coat had Wept  
him dry; but his neck appeared ui be wet —  
the snow was longing on his hair.  
He can.e to dinner without changing his  
dress, lu tire evening he appeared as well  
as usual. A heavy fail of snow tool, place  
eu Friday, which prevented (he General from  
riding out as usual. Ho bad i ken cold (un­  
doubtedly tioin I»«ung so much exposed the  
day before,) and complained of have g a stwe  
throat; he had a hoarseness, which increased  
in the evening, but he made light of it. as  
he would never take any thing to cany effa  
cold,—always observing, “let it g &gt; as it  
came ” In the evening, the paoers baring  
roiue from the Fost Office, he sat m ih.- ro e i,  
with Mrs. Washington and myself, rearing  
them, till about niuo o cl ick, and uh-n he  
met with any thiug which he thought diwrt  
ing or interesting he would lead it aloud.  
He desired trie to rp*d to h.m the n&lt; hat. s of  
the Ynginia Aw mbly, on the election of a  
Senator and Gotrr or, whicL | did. On his  
retiring to bed. tie appeared to he in perfect  
heal h except the colo whi. b he consider, d  
as trifling—ti« had been remarkably cheer  
ful al! the evening.  
About two or three o’clock an Saturday  
morning, he awoke Mrs Washington, and  
informed he he was very unwell, and had  
an ague. She observed that he could scarce  
l&gt; speak, and hreaihod With difficulty, ami  
she wished to get up and call a sc vanf; hut  
the General would not permit her. lest she  
should take cold. As soon as the day ap  
peaied, the woman Caroline went into the  
reom to make a fire, and the girl desired  
that Mr. Havvtins, one of the overseers, who  
i was used to hleecing tho people, might tie  
sent tor to bleed him tie/wie the Doctoi could  
arrive. I was sent for—w«nt to the Gener­  
al&#x27;s chamber, whrre Mrs YVashiogton was  
up, and related to me bis bung taken ill be  
tween 2 and 6 o clock as before stated I  
found him breathing witb difficulty and bard

and sent it with all speed Immediately I  
returned to th i General&#x27;s chamber, whern I  
found him in the same situation I had h it  
him. A mixture ®l molasses, vinegar, and  
butter was prepared, out he could nor swal  
low a drop; whenever he attempted he was  
distressed, convulsed, and almost suffocated  
, Mi liawltns came in so .a after sun rise  
and prepared to bleed him; when the arm  
was ready the Geieral, observing Haulms,  
appeared agitated: said wuh difficulty, “don’t  
be afraid,” and after the incision was mads,  
be observed, the orifice was not large enough  
—however the blood ran pretty freely Mis.  
Washington, not knowing whether bleeding  
was proper in tbe General’s situation, beg­  
ged that much might not be taken from him,  
and desirea me to stop it. When I was a  
boot to untie the string, tho General put up  
his hand to prevent it, and as soon as he  
could speak, said “more ”  
Mrs. Washington, still uneasy lest too  
much blood should be taken, it was stopped  
after about half a pint had been takeo. Find  
ing that no rebel was obtained from bleeding  
and that nothing could be swallowed, I pro­  
posed bathing tbe throat externally with sal  
volatille, which wa* done; a piee* of ilanuel  
was then put round his neck His teet were  
also soaked in warm water, but gave no re­

The followiug circumstantial account of  
the last illness and death of Gen. George  
Washington, was noted by Tobias Lear, on  
Sunday following his death, which happened  
on Saturday evening, December 14th, 1799,  
between the hours of ten and eleven: he was  
born on the 22d February, 1732.  
  
‘On Thursday, December 12th, the Gen-  
eral rode out to his farms at about 10 o’clock,  
and did not return home till past 3. Soon  
after he went out, the weather became very  
bad ; rain, hail and snow falling alternately,  
with a cold wind. When he came in, l  
carried some letters to him to frank, intend-  
ing to send them to the Post Office. He  
franked the letters, but said the weather was  
too bad to send a servant to the office that  
evening. I observed to him that I was  
afraid he had got wet; he said no—his  
great-coat had kept him dry; but his neck  
appeared to be wet—the snow was hanging  
on his hair. “He came to dinner without  
changing his dress. In the evening he ap-  
peared as well as usual. A_ heavy fall of  
snow took place on Friday, which prevented  
the General from riding out as usual. He  
had taken cold (undoubtedly from being so  
much exposed the day before,) and complain-  
ed of having a sore throat; he had a hoarse-  
ness, which increased in the evening, but he  
made light of it, as he would never take any-  
thing to carry off a cold,—always observing,  
‘let it go as it came.” In the evening, the  
papers haviug come from the Post Office, he  
sat in the room, with Mrs Washington and  
myself, reading them, till about nine o’clock ;  
and when he met with anything which he  
thought diverting or interesting, he would  
read aloud. He desired me to read to him  
the debates of the Virginia Assembly, on the  
election of a Senator and Governor, which I  
did. On his retiring to bed, he appeared to  
be in perfect health, except the cold which  
he considered as trifling—he had been re-  
markably cheerfui all the evening.  
  
About two or three o&#x27;clock on Saturday  
morning, he awoke Mrs Washington, and  
informed her he was very unwell, and had  
an ague. She observed that he could scarce-  
ly speak and breathed with difficulty, and  
she wished to get up and call a servant; but  
the General would not permit her, lest she  
would take cold. As soon as the day ap-  
peared, the woman Caroline went into the  
room to make a fire, and the girl desired  
that Mr Rawlins, one of the overseers, who  
was used to bleeding the people, might be  
sent for to bleed him before the Doctor could  
arrive. I was sent for—went to the Gene-  
ral’s chamber, where Mrs Washington was  
up, and related to me his being taken ill be-  
tween 2 and 3 o’clock, as before stated. I  
found him breathing with difficulty, and  
hardly able to utter a word intelligibly. I  
went out instantly and wrote a line to Dr  
Plask, and sent it with all speed. Immedi-  
ately I returned to the General’s chamber,  
where I found him in the same situation I  
had left him. A mixture of molasses, vine-  
gar and butter was prepared, but he could  
not swallow a drop; whenever he attempted,  
he was distressed, convulsed, and almost suf-  
focated.  
  
Mr Rawlins came in soon after sun-rise  
and prepared to bleed him; when the arm  
was ready, the General observing Rawlins  
appeared agitated, said with difficulty ‘“‘don’t  
be afraid,’’ and after the incision was made,  
he observed the orifice was not large enough,  
however the blood ran pretty freely. Mrs  
Washington, not knowing whether bleedin  
was proper in the General’s situation, basal  
that much might not be taken from him, ani  
desired me to stop it. When I was about to  
untie the string, the General put up his hand  
to prevent it, and soon as he could speak said  
“more.’’. Mrs Washington stil] uneasy lest  
too much blood should be taken, it was stop-  
ped after about half pint had been taken.  
  
Finding that no relief was obtained from the  
bleeding, and that nothing could be swallow.  
ed, I proposed bathing the throat externally  
with sai volatile, which was done; a piece of  
flannel was then put round his neck. His  
feet were also soaked in warm water, but gave  
no relief. By Mrs Washington’s request, I  
despatched a messenger for Dr Brown at Port  
Tobasco.  
  
a blister of cantharides on the throat of the  
General, and took more blood, and had some  
vinegar and hot water set in a tea pot for him  
to draw in the steam from the nosel. He  
also had sage tea and vinegar mixed aud  
used as a gargle, but when he held back’ his  
head to Jet it run down, it almost produced  
suffocation. When the mixture came out of  
his mouth some phlegm followed it, and he  
would attempt to cough, which the Doctor  
encouraged, but without effect. About 11  
o’clock, Dr Dick was sent for. Dr Craik  
bled the General again, but no effect was  
produced, and he continued in the same state,  
unable to swallow any thing. Dr Dick came  
in about 3 o’cluck, and Dr Brown arrived  
soon after; when, after consultation, the  
General was bled again, the blood ran slow-  
ly, appeared very thick and did not produce  
any symptoms of fainting. At 4 o’clock the  
General could swallow a little. Calomel and  
tartar emetic were administered without ef-  
fect. About half past 4 o’clock he desired  
me to ask Mrs Washington to come to his  
bedside, when he desired her to go down to  
his room, and take from his desk two Wills  
which she would find there, and bring them  
to him, which she did; upon looking at one,  
which he observed was useless, he desired  
her to burn it, which she did, and then took  
the other and put it away; after this was  
done I returned again to his bedside and took  
his hand. He said to me, “‘I find I am going  
—my breath cannot continue long--I believe  
from the first attack it would be fatal. Do  
you arrange and record all my military let-  
ters and papers; arrange my accounts and  
settle my books,:as you know more about  
them than any one else; and let Mr Rawlins  
finish recording my other letters, which he  
has begun.” He asked when Mr Lewis and  
Washington would return? I told him 1 be-  
lieved about the 20th of the month—he made  
no reply to it.  
  
The physicians again came in (between 5  
and 6 o’clock) and when they came to his  
bedside, Dr Craik asked him if he would sit  
up in the bed: he held out his hand to me  
and was raised up, when he said to the phy-  
sicians—‘‘I feel myself going ; you had _ bet-  
ter not take any more trouble about me, but  
let me go off quietly; I cannot Jast long.”  
They found what had been done was without  
effect ; he laid down again, and they retired,  
excepting Dr Craik. He then said to him—  
“Doctor, I die hard, but Lam not afraid to  
go; I believed from my first attack | should  
not survive it; my breath cannot Jast long.”  
The Doctor pressed his hand, but could not  
utter a word; he retired from the bedside  
and sat by the fire, absorbed in grief. About  
8 oclock, the physicians again came into  
the room, and applied blisters to his legs;  
out went out without a ray of hope. From  
this time he appeared to breathe with less  
difficulty than he had done; but was very  
res‘less, continually changing his position, to  
endeavor to get ease. [aided him all in my  
power, and was gratified in believing he felt  
it, for he would jook upon me with eyes  
speaking gratitade, but unable to utter a word  
without great distress. About 10 o’clock he  
made several attempts to speak to me before  
he could effect it; at length he said—“I am  
justa going. Have me decently buried ; and  
do not let my body be put into the vault in  
less than two days after I am dead.” I  
bowed assent. He looked at me again and  
said, “‘Do you understand me?’ I replied—  
“Yes sir.” “Tis well,” said he. About ten  
minutes. before he expired, his breatning be-  
came much easier—he lay quietly—he with-  
drew his hand from mine, and felt» his own  
pulse. I spoke to Dr Craik, who sat by the  
fire; he came to the bedside. The General’s  
hand fell from his wrist; I took it in mine  
and placed it on my breast. Dr Craik placed  
his hands over his eyes; and he expired  
without a struggle or a sigh.

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
The following circumstantial account of the lost  
illness and death of General George Washingtom,  
was noted by Tobias Lear, on Sunday following his  
death, which happened on Saturday evening, De­  
cember 14, 1799, between the hours of ten and ele­  
ven: he was born on the 22d February, 1732.  
“On Thursday, December 12, the General rotle  
out to his farms at about 10 o’clock, and did not le­  
turn home till past 3. Soon after he went out. t ie  
weather became very bad; ruin, bail, and snow full­  
ing alternately, with a cold wind. When he came  
in, I carried some letters to him to frunk, intending  
to send them to the post office, lie franked th« let­  
ters, but said the weather was too bad to send a ser­  
vant to the office that evening. I observed to him  
that I was afraid he had got wet: he said no—lis  
great-coat had kept him dry. But his neck appeir­  
ed to be wet—the snow was hanging on his hair.  
lie came to dinner without changing his dress. In  
the evening he appeared as well as usual. A hea-y  
fall of snow took place on Friday, which prevented  
the General from riding out as usual. He had taken  
cold (undoubtedly from being so much exposed tie  
day before,) and complained of having a sore tlirott;  
he had a hoarseness, which increased in the evenin&#x27;,  
hut ho made light of it, as he would never take aiy  
thing to carry off a cold,—always observing, “let It  
go ns it came.” In the evening&#x27; the papers having  
come from the post office, he sat in tne room, with  
Mrs Washington and myself, reading them, till n­  
bout 9 o’clock; and when he met with anything  
which he thought diverting or interesting, he would  
read it aloud. He desired me to read to him the de­  
bates of the Virginia Assembly, on the election of a  
Senator and Governor, which I did. On his retiring  
to bed he appeared to be in perfect health, exempt  
the cold which he considered as trifling—he had b«en  
remarkably cheerful nil the evening.  
About uvo or three o’clock on Saturday morning,  
he awoke Mrs Washington, and informed her lie  
was very unwell, and had an ague. She observed  
that he could scarcely speak, und breathed with dif­  
ficulty, and she wished to get up and call a servant;  
but the General would not permit her, lest she should  
lake cold. As soon as the day appeared, the woman.  
Caroline, went into the room to make afire, and the  
gild desired that Mr Rawlins one of the overseers,  
who was used to bleeding the people, might be sent  
for to bleed him before the Doctor could arrive. I  
was sent for—went to thewGenerafs chamber, where  
Mrs Washington was up, and related to me his be­  
ing taken ill between two and threeo’clock, as before  
stated. I found him breathing with difficulty, and  
hardly able to utter a word intelligibly. I went out  
instantly and wrote a line to Doctor Plask, and sent  
it with all speed. Immediately I returned to the Ge­  
neral’s chamber, where I found him in the same situ­  
ation I had left him. A mixture of molasses, vine­  
gar and butter, was prepared, but he could not swal­  
low a drop; whenever he attempted it, he was dis­  
tressed, convulsed, and almost suffocated.  
Mr Rawlins came in.soon after sunrise and pre­  
pared to bleed him; when the arm was ready, tlu*  
General observing Rawlins appeared agitated, said  
with difficulty “don’t he afraid,” and after the inci­  
sion was made he observed, the orifice was not large  
enough—however the blood ran pretty freely. Mrs  
Washington not knowing whether bleeding was pro­  
per in the General’s situation, begged that much  
might not be taken from him, and desired me to stop  
it. When I was about to untie the string, the Gene­  
  
ral put up his hand to prevent it, and soon as he could  
speak said “ more.”  
Mrs Washington, still uneasy lest&#x27;too much blood  
should be taken, it w as stopped, after about half a  
point had been taken. Finding that no relief was  
obtained from bleeding, and nothing could be swal­  
lowed, 1 proposed bathing the throat externally  
with sal volatile, which was done: a piece of flannel  
was then put round his neck. His feet were also  
soaked in warm water, but gave no relief. By Mrs  
Washington’s request I despatched a messenger for  
Doctor Brown at Port Tobasco. About 9 o’clock  
Doctor Craik arrived, and put a blister of canthuri­  
deson the throat of the General, and took more blood,  
and had some vinegar and hot water set in a tea pot  
for him to draw in the steam from the nosle.  
He also had tea and vinegar mixed and used as a  
gargle, but when he held back his head to let it run  
down, it almost produced suffocation. When the  
mixture came out of his mouth some phlegm follow­  
ed it, and he would attempt to cough, which the  
Doctor encouraged, but without effect. A&#x27;jout 11  
o’clock, Doctor Dick was sent for. Doctor Craik  
bled the General again; no effect was produicd, and  
he continued in the same state, unable to twallow  
any thing. Doctor Dick came in about 3 &gt;’clock,  
and Doctor Brown arrived soon after; when, after  
consultation, the General was bled again, tie blood  
ran slowly, appeared very thick, and did not produce  
any symptoms of fainting. At 4 o’clock the Gene­  
ral could swallow a little. Calomel and tartar eme­  
tic was administered without effect. About half past  
4 o’clock he desired me to ask Mrs Washington to  
come to his bed side, when he desired her to go down  
to his room, and take from his desk two Wilis which  
she would find there, and bring them to him, which  
she did; upon looking at one which he obser ed was  
useless, he desired her to burn it, which she Jid, and  
then took the other and put it away: after this was  
done I returned again to his bed side, and took his  
hand. He said 1o me, “ / find I am gome—my  
breath cannot continue long : 1 believed from the first  
attack it would be fatal. Do you arrange and record  
all my military letters and papers; arrange my ac­  
counts and settle my books, as you know more about  
them than any one else; and let Mr Rawlins fnish re­  
cording my other letters, which he has begun.” He  
asked when Mr Lewis and Washington would re­  
turn? I%.told him I believed about the 20th of the  
month.—He made no reply to it. The Physicians  
again came in (between 5 and 6 o’clock,) aiid when  
they came to his bed side, Doctor Craik asted him  
if he would set up in the bed: He held out lis hand  
to me and was raised up, when he said to tlia physi­  
cians—“ / feel myself going—you had better not take  
any more trouble about me, but let me go off quietly;  
1 cannot last long.” They found what hid been  
done Was without effect; he laid down again, and  
they retired, excepting Doctor Craik. ,He lien said  
to him—“ Doctor, I die hard, but l am not afraid to  
go: I believed from my first attack I should •wt sur­  
vive it; my breath cannot last long.” The Dotor  
pressed his hand, hut could not utter a word; he retir­  
ed from the bed side and sat by the fire, absorbed in  
grief. About 8 o’clock the physicians again came  
into the room,&#x27;and applied blisters to his legs; but  
went out without a ray of hope. From thistirnche  
appeared to breathe with less difficulty thar. he had  
done; but was very restless, continually coanging  
his position, to endeavor to get ease. I ailed him  
all in my power, and was gratified in beli«ving he  
felt it, for he would look upon me with eye# speak­  
ing gratitude, but unable to utter a word without  
great distress. About 10 o’clock he made several  
attempts to speak to me before he could effect it; at  
length he said—“ I am just going. Have me de­  
cently buried; and do not let my body be nd into the  
vault in less than two days after 1 am dead ” I bow­  
ed nssent. He looked at me again and slid—“ Do  
you understand me?” I replied—“Yes dr.” ’Tis  
well,” said he. About ten minutes before he expir­  
ed. his breathing became much easier—he lay qui­  
etly—he withdrew his hand from mine, snd felt his  
own pulse. I spoke to Doctor Craik who sat by the  
fire: he came to the bed side. The General’s hand  
fell from his wrist; I took it in mine and placed it  
on my breast. Doctor Craik pluced his hands over  
his eyes; and he expired without a struggle or a  
sigh.  
While we were fixed in silent grief, Mrs Wash­  
ington asked in a firm and collected voice—“Is he  
gone?”

despatched a messenger for Doctor Brown at Port  
Tobasco, About 9 o’clock Doct, Craik arrived,  
and puta blister of cantharides on the throat of  
the General, and took more blood, and had some  
vinegar and hot water set in the tea pot for him  
to draw in the steam from the nose.  
  
He also had sage tea and vinegar mixed and  
used asa gargle, but when he held his head to let  
it run down, it all most produced suffocation,  
When the mixture came out of his mouth some  
phlegm followed it, and he would attempt to cough  
which the Doctor encouraged, but without effect.  
About 11 o’clock, Doct. Dick was sent for. Doct,  
Craik bled the General again, no effect was pro-  
duced, and he continued in the same state, unable  
to swallow anything. Doct. Dick came in about  
3 o’clock, and Doct. Brown arrived soon after ;  
when, after consultation, the General was bled  
again, the blood ran slowly, appeared very thick  
and did not produce any symptoms of fainting.  
At 4o’clock the General could swallow a little.  
Calomel and tartar emetic were administered with-  
‘out effect. About ha!f past 4 o’clock he desired  
‘me toask Mrs Washington to come to his bed  
side, when he desired her to go down to his room,  
  
and take from his desk two Wills which she would |  
| find there, and bring them to him, which she did ;

The following circumstantial account &lt;&gt;f  
the last illness and death of General  
Gi.unur V. ashinqton, was noted by i‘0­  
, bias hear, on Sunday following his  
death, which happened on Saturday  
•veiling, December 14th, 1790, between  
the hSurs of ten and eleven: he was born  
on the 22il February, 1732;—  
On Tuesday, December 12th, the  
General rude out to his farms at about  
10 o’clock, And did not return till past  
v. Soon after he went out the weath­  
er became very bad; rain, hail and  
arc v falling alternately, with a cold  
&quot; 1 Whet: he came in, I carried  
&quot;so letters to him to frank, intendin &#x27;  
♦0 *;&gt;»»•&#x27; th*rn to the post-office. IU:  
v-&#x27;&gt; &gt;»« nut sato me weath­  
er V s »oo bad to send a servant to the  
olln-e that evening. 1 observed to him  
that 1 was afraid he had got wet; he  
said no—his great coat had kept him  
drv; buf his reck appeared to be wet—  
the snow v is hanging on his hair.  
Uc came to dinner without changing  
his dress. ]■, t|ie evening lie appeared  
as veil a - usu d, A heavv fall of snow  
took d ice &gt;n ‘Vidav, which prevented  
the General from riding out a- usual.—  
He had takeu cold (undoubtedly from1  
  
Wing so much exposed the tiny before*) j  
anti complainedot having a sore throat;  
he had a hoai sueofc, which lncreaecu in I  
i t: evening, but he made ii^i»t oi it as I  
lie would never lake any thing to cany j  
oil&#x27;a cold—ahvats obsening, &#x27;‘let it go;  
as it came.&quot; in the evening, the pa­  
pers having come Irorii the jiust-oiiice,  
he sat in the room, with Mrs. U astung­  
ton and myself* reading them, till about  
nine o’clock; and when he met with  
an} thing lie thought diverting or inter­  
esting, he would read it aloud, tie de­  
sired me to read him the debates ol the  
V irginta Assembly, on the election o! a  
Senator and Governor, winch 1 did.—  
t)n liis retiring to bed, lie appeared to  
be in perfect health, except the cold,  
which lie considered as trilling—he Mad  
been remarkably cheerhiiali the evening.  
About twoor three o’clock on Satur­  
day morning, he awoke Airs. Washing­  
ton, and informed her he was very un­  
well, and had ague. She observed mat  
he could scarcely speak, and breathed  
with difficult},and she wished to get up­  
land call a servant; but the General  
i would not permit her, lest she should  
J take cold. As soon as Use day appear­  
led, the woman Caroline went into the  
I room to make a tire, and the girl desii­  
ed that Mr. Rawlins, one of the over­  
seers, who was used to bleedingthe peo­  
ple, might be sent for to bleed him be­  
fore the doctor could arrive. 1 was sent  
lor—wefit to tiie General’s chamber,  
where Mrs. Washington was up, and t.e  
related to me his being taken ill between  
two and three o’clock, as before stated.  
I found him breathing with difficulty,  
and hardly ablc*to utter a word inteii&#x27;g,­  
bly. 1 went out instantly and wrote a let­  
ter lo l)r. Flask,and sent it withal) speed.  
Immediately 1 returned to the Gener­  
al’s chamber, where 1 found him in the  
same situation 1 had left him. A mix­  
ture of molasses, vinegar and butter was  
prepared, blit he could not swallow a  
drop; whenever he attempted he was  
distressed, cenvulsed, and almost suffo­  
cated.  
  
Mr. Rawlins came in soon after sun­  
I rise and prepared to bleed him; when  
| (he arm was ready, the General observ­  
j ing Rawlins appeared agitated, said  
vviUi difficulty, “plofi’t ue afraid,” and  
after the incision was made he observed  
die oriiice was not large enough—how­  
ever the blood run pretty freely. Mrs.  
Washington not knowing whether  
bleeding was proper in the General&#x27;s  
situation, begged that much might riot  
he taken from him, and desired me to  
stop it. When L was about to untie  
UIO omn^uiv voimmi IHoiuumj  
to prevent it, and soon as he could speak,  
said ‘‘more.5’  
Mrs. Washington still uneasy lest too  
mui i blood should be taken, it was  
stopped after about half a pint had beet)  
taken.. Finding that no relief was ob­  
tained IrotTi bleeding, and that nothing  
could be swallowed, 1 proposed bathing  
the throat externally with salvolatile,  
which was done; a piece of tlannel tv as  
then put round his neck. His feet w ere  
also soaked with w arm w ater, but gave  
no relief. Ity Mrs. Washington’s re­  
(j’lest, i despatched a messenger for  
i)r. Brown, at Port Tobasco. About 9  
o clock l)r. Graik arrived, and put a  
blister of cantharides on the throat of  
th • General, and took more blood, and  
had some vinegar and hot w ater set in a  
, tea-pot for him to draw in the steam  
from the nosel.  
  
lie also had sage tea and vinegar  
mixed,and used as a gargle, but when  
tie held back his head&quot;to let it run  
down, it almost produced suffocation._  
When the mixture came out of his  
mouth,some phlegm followed it, and he  
would attempt to cough which the J &#x27;oc­  
tor encouraged, but without effect.—  
\bout 11 o’clock Dr. Dick was sent for.  
Dr. Gruik* bled the General again, no  
effect was produced, and he continued  
n the same stale, unable to swallow  
!ul) thing. Doctor Dick came in about  
three o&#x27;clock, and Dr. Brown arrived  
soon alter; when, after consultation,  
the General was bled again, the blood  
ran slowly, appeared very thick, and  
did not produce any symptoms of faint­  
ing. At 4 o&#x27;clock the General could  
swallow a iitlIecalomcl,and tartar emet  
ic was admiaistt red without effect._  
About half past 1 o&#x27;clock he desired me  
to ask Mrs. Washington to come to  
his bed side, when he desired her to go  
down to his room, and take from liis  
desk two wills w hich she would find  
there, and bring them to him, w hich she  
dtd; upon looking nt one, which he ob­  
served was useless, he desired her to  
burn it,•which she did,and then took  
the other and pul it away; after this  
was done. I returned again to his bed­  
side and took his hand—he said to me,  
“J fit d I am going—I believed from the’  
first attack it would bo fatal. Do you  
arrange and record all my military Ict­  
teisand paper&#x27;s arrange my accounts  
and settle my books, as you know more  
about them than any one else—and let  
Mr. Rawlins finish recording m , other  
letters which he lias begun.” He asked  
when Mr. Lewis and Washington would  
retun-? I told him,I believed about the  
Uh of t he month. He made no reply  
The physicians again come in.  
-between 5 and (5 o&#x27;clock,) and when  
tnev came to bis bed side, Dr. Craik  
as cd him if he would set up in the bed?  
I.e held out hts hand to me, and was  
r.used up, when hesaid to the physician,  
  
iCI lecl tnysclf going—you ha*! boiler j  
not take any more trou. ie about me, I  
but lei me go oil quietly—i cannot last &gt;  
long.&quot; They louud v\:iat Imd been  
done was without effect—he laid down)  
again, and they retired, excepting Dr. j  
Craik. lie then said to him—“Doctor, |  
i die hard, but 1 am not afiaid to go—  
1 believed from my first attack i should  
not survive it—my breath cannot last  
tong.” The Doctor pressed his hand,  
but could not utter a word he retired  
(rom the bed side and sat by the lire,  
absorbed in grief.  
About 8 o’clock, the physicians again  
came into the room, and appliid blis­  
ters to his legs; but went out without a  
ray of hope. From this time lie appear­  
ed to breathe with less difficulty thun  
he had done; but was very restless,  
continually changing his position, en­  
deavoring to get ease 1 aided him ail  
in my power, and was gratified in be­  
lieving he felt it, for he would look upon  
me with eyes speaking gratitude, Ins  
unable to utter a word without great  
distress. About ten o’clock he made  
Iseveral attempts to speak to me before  
i he could effect it; at length he said—  
“J cun going. Have me decently buried;  
and uo not let my body be put in the vault  
m less than two d- ys after lam dead—  
i bowed assent, lie looked at me again  
and said—“Do you understand me?&quot;—  
1 replied—“\estSir.&quot;’ &quot;&#x27;ll is well&quot; said  
he. About ten minutes before he ex­  
pired, his breathing became much ta­  
sier—he lay&#x27;quietly—lie withdrew hi­  
hand from mb e and it It his owr, pulse.  
&#x27; i spoke to Dr. Craik, who sat by the lire;  
lie came to the bed side. The Gener­  
al’s hand fell from his wrist; 1 took it in  
mine,and placed it oti my breast. Dr.  
Craik placed Ids hands ov&lt; i bis eyes;  
and he expired without a struggle ora  
sigh.  
While we were fixed i.i silent grief,  
Mrs. Washington asked in a firm and  
| collected voice—“Is lie gone?”

On Thursday, Dec. 12, the general rode out to his farms at  
about ten o’clock, and did not return home till past three. Soon  
after he went out the weather became very bad ; rain, hail, and  
snow falling alternately, with a cold wind. When he came in,  
I carried some letters to him to frank, intending to send them to  
the post-office. He franked the letters, but said the weather  
was too bad to send a servant to the office that evening. I ob-  
served to him that I was afraid he had got wet; he said, no;  
his great coat had kept him dry: but his neck appeared to be  
wet—the snow was hanging on his hair,  
  
He came to dinner without changing his dress. In the even-  
  
ing he appeared as well as usual. A heavy fall of snow took  
place on Friday, which prevented the general from riding out  
as usual. He had taken cold (undoubtedly from being so much  
exposed the day before,) and complained of having a sore throat ;  
he had a hoarseness, which increased in the evening, but he  
made light of it, as he would never take any thing to carry off a  
cold,—always observing, ‘ Let it go as it came.’ In the evening,  
the papers having come from the post office, he sat in the room  
with Mrs. Washington and myself, reading them till about nine  
o’clock ; and when he met with any thing which he thought  
diverting or interesting, he would read it aloud. He desired me  
to read to him the debates of the Virginia Assembly on the elec-  
tion of a senator and governor, which I did. On his retiring to  
bed he appeared to be in perfect health, except the cold, which  
he considered as trifling—he had been remarkably cheerful all  
the evening.  
  
About two or three o’clock on Saturday morning he awoke  
Mrs. Washington, and informed her that he felt very unwell,  
and had an ague. She observed that he could scarcely speak,  
and breathed with difficulty, and she wished to get up and call  
aservant; but the general would not permit her, lest she should  
take cold. As soon as the day appeared, the woman Caroline  
went into the room to make a fire, and the general desired that  
Mr. Rawlins, one of the overseers, who was used to bleeding  
the people, might be sent for to bleed him before the doctor could  
arrive. I was sent for—went to the general’s chamber, where  
Mrs. Washington was up, and related to me his being taken ill  
between two and three o’clock, as before stated. I found him  
breathing with difficulty, and hardly able to utter a word intel-  
ligibly. I went out instantly, and wrote a line to Dr. Plask,  
and sent it with all speed. Immediately I returned to the ge-  
neral’s chamber, where I found him in the same situation I  
had left him. A mixture of molasses, vinegar, and butter was  
prepared, but he could not swallow a drop; whenever he  
attempted he was distressed, convulsed, and almost suffocated.  
  
Mr. Rawlins came in soon after sunrise and prepared to  
bleed him; when the arm was ready, the general, observing  
Rawlins appeared agitated, said, with difficulty, ‘Don’t be  
afraid;? and after the incision was made, he observed the ori-  
fice was not large enough: however, the blood ran pretty freely.  
Mrs. Washington, not knowing whether bleeding was proper in  
the general’s situation, begged that much might not be taken  
from him, and desired me to stop it. When 1 was about to untie  
the string, the general put up his hand to prevent it, and, as  
soon as he could speak, said, ‘ More.’  
  
Mrs. Washington still uneasy lest too much blood should be  
drawn, it was stopped after about half a pint had been taken.  
Finding that no relief was obtained from bleeding, and that  
nothing could be swallowed, I proposed bathing the threat exter-  
nally with sal volatile, which was done ; a piece of flannel was  
then put round his neck. His feet were also soaked in warm  
water, but this gave no relief. By Mrs. Washington’s request,  
I despatched a messenger for Doctor Brown at Port Tobacco.  
About nine o’clock, Dr. Craik arrived, and put a blister of can-  
tharides on the throat of the general, and took more blood, and  
had some vinegar and hot water set in a teapot, for him to draw  
in the stream from the spout.  
  
He also had sage-tea and vinegar mixed and used as a gar-  
gle, but when he held back his head to let it run down, it almost  
produced suffocation. When the mixture came out of his mouth  
some phlegm followed it, and he would attempt to cough, which  
the doctor encouraged, but without effect. About eleven o’clock,  
Dr. Dick was sent for. Dr. Craik bled the general again; no  
effect was produced, and he continued in the same state, urable  
to swallow any thing. Dr. Dick came in about three o’clock,  
and Dr. Brown arrived soon after; when, after consultation, the  
general was bled again: the blood ran slowly, appeared very  
thick, and did rot produce any symptoms of fainting. At four  
o’clock the general could swallow a little. Calomel and tartar  
emetic were administered without effect. About half past four  
o’clock he requested me to ask Mrs. Washington to come to his  
bedside, when he desired her to go down to his room, and take  
from his desk two wills which she would find there, and bring  
them to him, which she did. Upon looking at one, which he  
observed was useless, he desired her to burn it, which she did :  
and then took the other and put it away. After this was done, I  
returned again to his bedside and took his hand. He said to me,  
‘I find I am going—my breath cannot continue long—I believed  
  
  
  
from the first attack it would be fatal.’ Do you arfange and re-

ington would return? I told him that I believed about the twen-  
tieth of the month. He made no reply.  
  
The physicians arrived between five and six o’clock, and  
when they came to his bedside, Dr. Craik asked him if he would  
sit up in the bed: he held out his hand to me and was raised up,  
when he said to the physician—‘I feel myself going ; you had  
better not take any more trouble about me, but let me go off  
quietly ; I cannot last long. They found what had been done  
was without effect; he laid down again, and they retired, ex-  
cepting Dr. Craik. He then said to him—‘ Doctor, I die hard,  
but Iam not afraid to go; I believed from my first attack I should  
not survive it; my breath cannot last long.’ The doctor pressed  
his hand, but could not utter a word; he retired from the bed-  
side and sat by the fire, absorbed in grief. About eight o’clock,  
the physicians again came into the room, and applied blisters to  
his legs, but went out without a ray of hope. From this time he  
appeared to breathe with less difficulty than he had done, but  
was very restless, continually changing his position, to endeavor  
to get ease. I aided him all in my power, and was gratified in  
believing he felt it, for he would look upon me with eyes speak-  
ing gratitude, but unable to utter a word without great distress.  
About ten o’clock he made several attempts to speak to me be-  
fore he could effect it; at length he said, ‘lam just going. Have  
me decently buried; and do not let my body be put into the vault  
in less than two days after I am dead.’ I bowed assent. He  
looked at me again and said, ‘Do you understand me ?? I re-  
plied, ‘ Yes, sir.’ ‘Tis well,’ said he. About ten minutes be-  
fore he expired, his breathing became much easier: he lay  
quietly: he withdrew his hand from mine, and felt his own  
pulse. Ispoke to Dr. Craik, who sat by the fire ; he came to the  
bedside. The general’s hand fell from his wrist; I took it in

“On Thursday, Dec. 12, 1799, the Gene-  
ral rode out to his farms at about ten o&#x27;clock,  
and did not return till past three. Soon after  
he went out, the weather became very bad ;  
rain, hail, and snow falling alternately, with  
a cold wind. I observed to him that | was  
afraid he had got wet; he said no; his great  
coat had kept him dry: but his neck appeared  
to be wet—the snow was hanging on his  
hair.  
  
“He came to dinner without changing his  
In the evening he appeared as well  
as usual. A heavy fall of snow took place on  
Friday, which prevented the General from  
riding out as usual. He had taken cold, (un-  
doubtedly from being so much exposed the  
day before,) and complained of having a sore  
throat; he had a hoarseness, which increased  
in the evening, but he mace light of it, as he  
would never take any thing to carry off a  
cold—always observing, ‘let it go as it came.”  
In the evening, the papers having come from  
the post-office, he sat in the room with Mrs,  
Washington and myself, reading them till  
about nine o’clock; and when he met with  
any thing which he thonght diverting or in-  
teresting, he would read it aloud. He desired  
me to read to him the debates of the Virginia  
assembly on the election of a senator and  
governor, which I did. On his retiring to  
bed he appeared to be in perfect health, ex-  
cept the cold, which he considered as trifling ;  
he had been remarkably cheerful all the  
evening.

On Thursday, December 12th, the General  
rode out to his farms about ten o&#x27;clock, and  
did not return home till past three. Soon  
after he went out, the weather became very  
bad; rain, hail and snow falling alternately,  
with a cold wind. When he came in, I car­  
ried some letters to him to frank, intending  
to send them to the Post Office. He franked  
the letters, but said the weather was too bad  
to send a servant to the office that evening  
I observed to him that I was afraid he had  
got wet; he said, no--his great coat had  
kept him dry; but his neck appeared to be  
wet--the snow was hanging on his hair.  
  
He came to dinner without changing his  
In the evening he appeared as well  
as usual. A heavy fall of snow took place  
on Friday, which prevented the Generat from  
riding out as usual. He had taken cold un­  
doubtedly from being so much exposed the­  
day before and complained of having a sore  
throat; he had a hoarseness, which increased  
in the evening, but he made light of it, as he  
would never take anything to carry off a cold,  
always observing- &quot;let it go as it came.&quot;  
In the evening, the papers having come from  
the Post Office, he sat in the room with Mrs  
Washington and myself, reading them, till  
about nine o&#x27;clock; and when he met with  
anything which he thought diverting or inter­  
esting, he would read it aloud. He desired  
me to read to him the debates of the Virgin­  
in assembly, on the election of a Senator and  
Governor, which I did. On his retiring to  
bed, he appeared to be in persect health, ex­  
cept the cold which he considered as trifling  
he had been remarkably cheerful all the eve­  
ning.  
About two or three o&#x27;clock on Saturday  
morning, he awoke Mrs. Washington, and  
informed her that he was very unwell, and  
had an ague. She observed that he could  
scarcely speak, and breathed with difficulty,  
and she wished to get up and call a servant;  
but the General would not permit her, lest  
she should take cold. As soon as the day  
appeared, the woman Caroline went into the  
room to make a fire, and she desired that Mr.  
Rawlins, one of the overscers, who was used  
to bleeding the people, might be sent for to  
bleed him before the doctor could arrive. I  
was sent for--went to the General&#x27;s chamber,  
where Mrs. Washington was up, and related  
to me his being taken ill between two and  
  
three o&#x27;clock, as before stated. I found him  
breathing with difficulty, and hardly able to  
utter a word intelligibly. I went out instant­  
ly and wrote a line to Dr. Plask, and sent it  
with all speed. Immediately I returned to  
the General&#x27;s chamber, where I found him in  
the same condition I had lest him. A mix­  
ture of molasses, vinegar and butter, was pre­  
pared, but he could not swallow a drop;  
whenever he attempted, he was distressed,  
and almost suffocated.  
Mr. Rawlins came in soon after sunrise,  
and prepared to bleed him; when the arm  
was ready the General observing Rawlins,  
appeared agitated, said with difficulty, &quot;don&#x27;t  
he afraid;&quot; and after the incision was made,  
he observed, the orifice was not large enough  
-however, the blood ran pretty freely. Mrs.  
Washington not knowing whether bleeding  
was proper in the General&#x27;s situation, beg­  
ged that it might not be taken from him, and  
desired me to stop it. When I was about to  
unite the string, the General put up his hand  
to prevent it, and as soon as he could speak,  
said &quot;more.&quot;  
Mrs. Washington, still uneasy lest too  
much blood should be taken, it was stopped  
after a half a pint had been taken. Finding  
that no relief was obtained from bleeding,  
and that nothing could be swallowed, I pro­  
posed bathing the throat externally with sal  
volatile, which was done, a piece of flannel  
was then put round his neck. His feet were  
also soaked in warm water, but gave no re­  
hef. By Mrs. Washington&#x27;s request, I de­  
spitched a messenger for Dr. Brown, at  
Fort Tobasco. About nine o&#x27;clock Dr.Craik  
arrived, and put a blister of cantharides, on  
the throat of the General, and took more  
blood, and had some vinegar and hot water  
set in a tea-pot for him to draw the steam  
tom the nose  
He also had some sage tea and vinegar  
mixed and used as a gargle, but when he held  
back his head to let it run down, it almost  
produce suffocation. When the mixture  
came out of his mouth some phlegm followed  
it, and he would attempt to cough, which  
the doctor encouraged, but without leffect.  
About eleven o&#x27;clock, Dr. Dick was sent for.  
Dr. Craik bled the General again, no effect  
produced, and he continued in the same  
state, unable to swallow anything. Dr. Dick  
&quot;Ame in about three o&#x27;clock, and Dr. Brown  
  
arrived soon after, when, after consultation,  
the General was bled again; the blood ran  
slowly, appeared very thick, and did not pro­  
duce any symptoms of fainting. At four  
o&#x27;clock the Geaeral could swallow a little  
Calomel and tartar emetic were administered  
without effect.  
About half past four o&#x27;clock, he desired me  
to ask Mrs, Washington to come to his bed­  
side, when he desired her to go down to his  
room, and lake from his desk two wills which  
she would find there, and bring them to him,  
which she did; upon looking at one, which  
he observed was useless, he desired her to  
burn it, which she did and then took the oth­  
er and put it away. Aster this was done, I  
returned again to his bed-side, and took his  
hand. He said to me, &quot;I find I am going-  
breath cannot continue long. I believed  
from the first attack it would be fatal. Do  
you arrange and record all my military let­  
ters and papers; arraage accounts and settle  
my books, as you know more about them  
than any one else; and let Mr. Rawlins fin­  
ish recording my other letters, which he has  
begun.&quot;  
He asked when Mr. Lewis and Washing­  
ton would return. I told him, I believed  
about the 20th of the month. He made no  
reply to it. The physicians again came in  
(between five and six o&#x27;clock,) and when  
they came to his bedside, Dr. Craik asked  
him if he would sit up in the bed; he held  
out his hand to me and was up, when he said  
to the physicians: &quot;I feel myself going; you  
had better not take any more trouble about  
me, but let me go off quietly, I cannot last  
long.&quot; They found what had been done was  
without effect; he laid down ag ain, and they  
retired, excepting Dr. Craik. He then said  
to him: &quot;Doctor, I die hard, but I am not  
afraid to go: I believed from my first attack  
I should not survive it; my breath cannot  
last long.&quot; The Doctor pressed his hand,  
but could not utter a word; he retired from  
the bedside and sat by the fire, absorbed in  
  
grief.  
About eight o&#x27;clock, the physicians again  
came into the room, and applied blisters to  
his legs; but went out with a ray of hope.  
From this time he appeared to breathe with  
less difficulty than he had done; but was  
restless, continually changing his position, to  
endeavor to get ease. I aided him all in my  
power, and was gratified in believing he felt  
it, for he would look upon me with eyes  
speaking gratitude, but unable to utter a word  
without great distress.  
About ten o&#x27;clock, he made several at-  
tempts to speak to me before he could effect  
it; at length he said- &quot;I am just going.  
Have me decently buried; and do not let my  
body be put into the vault in less than two  
days after I am dead.&quot; I bowed assent. He  
looked at me again and said- &quot;Do you un­  
derstand me!&quot; I replied- &quot;yes, sir.&quot; &quot;Tis  
wall,&quot; he said.  
About ten minutes before he expired, his  
breathing became much easier--he lay quiet­  
ly--he withdrew his hand from mind and felt  
his own pulse. I spoke to Dr. Craik, who  
aat by the fire; he came to the bedside. The  
Generel&#x27;s hand fell from his wrist: I took it  
in mine and placed it on my breast. Doctor  
Craik placed his hands over his eyes; and he  
expired without a struggle or a sigh.  
While we were fixed in silent grief, Mrs.  
Washington asked in a firm and collected  
voice:-&quot;Is he gone!&quot; and thus closed th

On Thursday, December 12th the  
General rode out to his farms about ten  
o’cleck, and did not return home till past  
three. . Soon after he went out the  
weather became very bad ; rain, hail and  
snow falling alternatively, with a cold  
wind. V\ hen he came in, I carried i  
some letters to him to frank, intending I  
to send them to the post office. He ;  
franked the letters, but said the weath- |  
er was too Lad to send a servant to the |  
post office that evening. I observed to |  
him that I was afraid he had got wet:  
lie said no—his great coat had kept him  
dry ; but his neck appeared to bo wet—  
the snow was hanging on his hair.  
O O  
He came to dinner without changing  
C ,  
his dress. In the evening he appeared  
as well as usual. A heavy fall of snow  
took place on Friday, which prevented  
the (tenoral from riding out as usual,—  
Tie had taken cold, undoubtedly, from  
being so much exposed the day before,  
and complained of having a sore throat;  
ho had a hoarseness which increased in  
the evening, but he made light of it, as  
he never would take anything to carry  
off a cold, always observing—“let it go  
as it came.’’ In the evening the papers  
having come from the post office, lie sat  
in the room with Mrs. Washington and  
myself, and reading them, till about  
nine o’clock ; and when he met with  
anything which he thought diverting or  
interesting, he would read it aloud. He  
desired me to read to him the debates  
of the Virginia Assembly, on the elec­  
tion of a Senator and Governor, which I  
did. On his retiring to bed he appear­  
cd to be in perfect health, except the  
cold which he considered as trifling—he  
had been remarkably cheerful all the  
evening.  
About two or three o’clock on Satur­  
day morning, he awoke Mrs. Washing­  
ton, and informed her that he was very  
unwell, and had an ague. She observed  
that he could scarcely speak, and breath­  
ed with difficulty and she wished to get  
up and call a servant ; hut the General  
would not permit her, lest she should  
take cold. As soon as the day appeared,  
the woman Caroline went into Hie room  
to make a fire, and the girl desired that  
Mr. Rawlins one of the overseers, who  
was used to bleeding the people, might  
be sent for to bleed him before the doc­  
tor cojild arrive. I was sent for—went  
to the General’s chamber, where Mrs.  
Washington was up, related to me his  
being taken ill between two and three  
o’clock as above stated. I found him  
breathing with difficulty, aud hardly  
able to utter a word intelligibly. I went  
out instantly and wrote a line to Mr.  
Plash, and sent it with all speed. Im­  
mediately after, I returned to the Gen­  
eral’s chamber, when I found him in the  
condition I had left him. A mixture of  
molasses, vinegar and butter, was pre­  
pared but he could not swallow a drop ;  
w henever he attempted be was distressed,  
convulsed aud almost suffocated.  
Mr. Rawlins came in soon after sun­  
rise, and prepared to bleed him ; when  
the arm was ready, the General observ­  
ing Rawlins appeared agitated, said  
with difficulty, “don’t be afraid and  
after the incision was made, the orifice  
was not large enough—however the  
blood ran pretty freely. Mrs. Wash­  
ington, not knowing whether bleeding  
was propper in the General’s situation,  
begged that it might not bo taken from  
him, and desired me to stop. When I  
was about to untie the string, the Gen­  
eral put up his hand to prevent it, and  
as soon as he could speak said “more.”  
Mrs. Washington, still uneasy lest  
too much blood should be taken, it was  
stopped alter half u pint had been taken.  
Finding that no relief was obtained from  
bleeding, and that noting could be swal­  
lowed, 1 proposed bathing the throat ex­  
ternally with sal volatile, which was  
done, and a piece of flannel put round  
his neck. His feet were also soaked in  
hot water, but gave no relief. By Mrs.  
Washington’s request, I sent for Dr.  
Brown, at Fort Tobasco. About nine  
o’clock, Dr. Craik arrived and put

when he held back his head to let it run  
down, it almost produced suffocation.—  
When the mixture came out of his  
mouth some phlegm followed it, and he  
would attempt to cough, which the doc­  
tor encouraged, hut without effect.—  
About eleven o’clock, Dr. Dick was sent  
lor. Dr. Craik bled the General again.  
No effect was produced, and he contin­  
ued in the same state, unable to swal­

three o’clock, aud Dr. Brown arrived  
soon after, when after consultation, the  
General was bled again ; the blood ran

The following circumstautial account of  
the last illness and ileath of Gen. George  
Washington was noted by Tobias Lear ou  
the Sunday following his death, which  
happened on Saturday evening Dec. 14,  
1799, between the hours of 10 and 11:  
On Thursday, Dec. 12, the general rode  
our, to his farms at about 10 o’clock and did  
not return home till past 3 o’clock. Soon  
after he went out the weather became very  
bad, rain, liaii and spow falling alternately,  
with a cold wind. When he came in I car­  
ried some letters to him to frank, intending  
to send them to the postofflea. He franked  
the letters, but said the weather was too  
bad to send a servant to the office that  
evening.  
I observed to him that I was afraid he  
had got wet; he said no, his great-coat had  
kept Him dry. But his neck appeared to be  
wet, the snow was hanging on his hair. He  
came to dinner without changing his dress.  
In the evening he appeared as well as usual.  
A heavy fall of snow took piace on Friday,  
which prevented the general from riding  
out as usual. He had taken cold, undoubt­  
edly from being so much exposed the day  
before, and complained of haviug a sore  
throat: he bad a hoarseness, which increased  
in the evening, but lie made lignt  
of it, as he would never take  
anything to carry off a cold, always  
observing, “Let it go as it came.” In the  
evening, the papers having come from the  
postofflee, he sat in the room with Mrs.  
Washington and myself reading them till  
about 9 o’clock, and when he met with any­  
thing which he thought diverting or inter­  
esting he would read it aloud. He desired  
me to read to him the debates of tho Vir­  
ginia assembly on tbe election of a senator  
and governor, which I did. On his retiring  
to bed he appeared to bo in perfect health,  
except tbe cold, which he considered as  
trifling; he had been remarkably cheerful  
all the evening.  
About 2 or 3 o’clock on Saturday morn­  
ing he awoke Mrs. Washington and in­  
formed he was very unwell and had an  
ague. She observed that he could scarcely  
speak and breathed with difficulty, and she  
wished to get up amd caff a servant, but the  
general would not permit her lest she should  
take cold. As soon as the day appeared the  
woman, Caroline, went into the room to  
make a Are, aua the girl desired that Mr.  
Rawlins, one of the overseers, who was  
used to bleeding the people, might be sent  
for to bleed him before the doctor could  
arrive. I was sent lor, and went to the  
general’s chamber, where Mrs. Washington  
was up and related to me his being taken  
ill between 2 and 3 o’clock, as before stated.  
I found him breathing with difficulty and  
hardly aide to utter a word intelligibly. I  
went out instautly and wrote a liue to Dr.  
Plask and sent it with all speed. Imme­  
diately I returned to the general’s chamber,  
where I found him in tho same situation I  
had left him. A mixture of molasses, vine­  
gar and butter was prepared, hut be could  
not swallow a drop. Whenever he at­  
tempted it he was distressed, cou­  
vulsed and almost suffocated. Mr.  
Rawlins came in soon after sunrise  
and prepared to bleed him. When the arm  
was ready, the general observing Raw­  
lins appeared agitated, said with difficulty,  
“Don’t be afraid,&quot; ad after the incision  
was made he observed the orifice was not  
large enough. However, the blood ran  
pretty freely. Mrs. Washington, not  
knowing whether bleeding was proper iu  
the general’s condition, begged that much  
might not be taken from him, and desired  
me to stop it. When I was about to untie  
tbe string the general put up his hand to  
prevent it, and. soon as he could speak.said,  
“More.”  
Mrs. Washington being uneasy lest too  
much blood should be takeu, it was stopped  
after about half a pint had been taken.  
Finding that no relief was obtained from  
bleeding and nothing could be swallowed, I  
proposed bathing the throat externally with  
sal volatile, which was done. A piece of  
flannel was then put round his neck. His  
feet were also soaked in warm water, but it  
gave no relief. By Mrs. Washington’s re­  
quest I dispatched a messenger for Dr.  
Brown, at Port Tobacco. About 9 o’clock  
Dr. Craik arrived and put a blister of can­  
tharides on the throat of the general, and  
took more blood, and bad some vinegar and  
hot water set in a teapot for him to draw in  
the fumes from tbe nozzle. He albo bad  
tea and vinegar mixe l and jpused as  
a gargle, but when he held back his head to  
let it run down, it almost produced suffoca­  
tion. When the mixture came out of his  
mouth some phlegm followed it, and he  
would attempt to cough, which the doctor  
encouraged, but without effect. About 11  
o’clock Dr. Dick was sent for. Dr. Craik  
bled the general again; no effect was pro­  
duced, and he continued in the same state,  
unable to swallow anything. Dr. Dick  
came in about 3 o’clock and Dr. Brown ar­  
rived soon after, when, after omsultation,  
the general was bled again; the blood rati  
slowly, appeared very thick, and did not  
produce any symptoms of fainting.  
At 4 o’clock the general could swallow a  
little. Calomel and tartar emetic were ad­  
ministered without effect. About 4:30  
o’clock he de?ired me to ask Mrs. Washing­  
ton to come to his bedside, when he desired  
her to go down to his Boom and take fro a  
his desk two wills which she would find  
there and bring them to him, which she did.  
Upon looking at one, which he observed  
was useless, he desired her to buru it. which  
she did, and then took the other and put it  
away. After this was done 1 returned again  
to his bedside and took his hand. He said  
to me: “I find I am going; my breath can­  
not continue long. I helievert from the first  
attack it would be fatal. Do you arrange  
and record all my military let ers and pa­  
pers; arrange my accounts and settle my  
books, as you know more about them than  
any o se else, and let Mr. Rawlins finish re­  
cording my other letters, which he has be­  
gun.”  
He asked when Mr. Lewis would return.  
I told him I believed about tho 20th of the  
month. He made no reply to it. The phy­  
sicians again came in (between 5 and 0  
o’clock), and when they came to his bedside  
Dr. Craik asked him it he would sit up in  
the bed. He held out his hand to mo and  
was raised up, when he said to tbe physi­  
cians:  
“I feel myself going—yon had better not  
take any more trouble about me, but let me  
go off quietly; I cannot last long.”  
They found what had been done was  
without effoct; he lay down again and they  
retired, excepting Dr. Craik. He then said  
to him: “Doctor, I die hard, but lam not  
afraid to go; I believed from my first at­  
tack 1 should not survive it; my breath  
cannot last long.”  
The doctor pressed his hand, but oould  
not utter a word; tie retired from the bed­  
side and sat by the fire, absorbed in grief.  
About 8 o’clock the physiciaus again came  
into tbe room and applied blisters to his  
legs, but went out without a ray of hope.  
From this time he appeared t&lt;&gt; breathe  
with less difficulty than be had done; but  
wna very restless, continually changing his  
position to endeavor to get ease. I aid oil  
him all*in my power, and wa, gratified in  
believing he felt it, for he would look upon  
me witn eyes speaking gratitude, but was  
unable to utter a word without great dis­  
tress.  
About 10 o’clock he made several at­  
tempts to speak to me before be could effect  
it. At length be said: “I am just going.  
Have me decently buried, and do not lot  
my body be put into the vault in less than  
two days after I am dead,”  
I bowed assent. He looked at me again  
and said: “Do you und-rstauid me?” I re­  
plied: “Yes, sir.” &quot;’Tis well,” said he.  
About ten minutes beforo ho expired hii  
breathing became much easier; he lay  
quietly; he withdrew his hand from mine  
and felt his own pulse. I spoke to&#x27; I)r.  
Ci aik, who sat by the fire; he came to the  
bedside. The general’s hand fell from his  
wrist. I toes it iu mine and placed it on  
bis breast. Dr. Craik placed his hands  
over his eves, aud he expired without a  
struggle or a sigh.  
While we wore fixed in silent grief l|lrs.  
Washington asked in a firm and collected  
voice, “Is he gone?”

The following circumstantial ac  
count of the last illness and death of  
Geo. Washington was noted by To  
bias Lear on the Sunday following  
his death, which happened on Satur­  
day evening, December 1 1, 17&#x27;.!, be  
tween the hours of 10 and 11.  
On Thursday, DecemU-r 12, the  
General rode out to his farm at  
about 10 o&#x27;clock, and did not return  
home until past 3. Soon after he  
went out the weather became very  
bad, rain, hail and snow falling al­  
ternately, with a cold wind. When  
be came in I carried some letters to  
him to frank, intending to send  
them to the post office. He franked  
the letters, but said the weather was  
too bad to send a servant to t he­  
office that evening.  
I observed to him that I was  
afraid he had got wet; he said, no,  
his great coat hail kept him dry.  
But his neck appeared to be wet;  
the snow was hanging on his hair.  
He came to dinner without changing  
his dress. . In the eveniug he ap­  
peared as well as usual. A heavy  
fall of snow took place on Friday,  
which prevented the General from  
riding out as usual He had taken  
cold undoubtedly from being so  
much exposed the day before, and  
complained of having a sore throat;  
he had a hoarseness, which increased  
in the evening, but he made light i f  
it, as he would never take anything  
to carry off a cold, always observing,  
&quot;Let it go as it came.&quot; In the evi n­  
ing, the papers having come from  
the postoflice, ho sat in the room  
with Mrs. Washington and myself  
reading them till about 9 o&#x27;clock, and  
when he met with anything wlrch  
he thought diverting or iuteresiing  
he would read it aloud. He desired  
me to read to him the debates of f he  
Virginia Assembly on the election of  
a senator and governor, which I did.  
On his retiring to bed he seemed to  
be in perfect health, except the cold,  
which he considered as trifling; he  
bad been remarkably cheerful all the  
veuing.  
About 2 or 3 o&#x27;clock on Saturday  
morning he awoke Mrs. Washington  
and informed her that he was very  
unwell and had an ague. Sue ob­  
served that he could scarcely speak  
and breathed with difficulty, and  
she wished to get up and call a ser­  
vant, but the General would not per­  
mit her, lest she should take cold.  
As soon as the day appeared tho  
the woman, Caroline, went into the  
room to make a fire, and the girl de­  
sired that Mr. Rawlins, one of the  
overseers, who was used to bleeding  
the people, might Ihj sent for to

Arrive. I was sent for and went to  
the General&#x27;s chamber, where Mrs.  
&quot;Washington was up and related to  
me his being taken ill between 2 and  
3 o&#x27;clock, as before stated.  
1 found him breathing with diffi­  
culty and hardly able to utter a  
word intelligibly. I went out in­  
stantly and wrote a line to Dr. Plask  
and sent it with all speed. Imme­  
diately I returned to the General&#x27;s  
chamber, where I found lrim in the  
same situation I had left lrim. A  
mixture f molasses, vinegar and  
butter was prepared, but he could  
not swallow a drop. Whenever he at­  
tempted it he was distressed, con­  
Tulsedand almost suffocated. Mr.  
Rawlins came in soon after sunrise  
and prepared to bleed him. When  
the arm was ready the General ob­

The following circumstantial account  
)f the last illness and death of Gen.  
George Washington was noted by Tobias  
Lear on the Sunday following liis death,  
vhich happened on Saturday evening,  
Dec. 14, 1799, between the hours of 10  
ind 11:  
On Thursday, December 12, the Gen­  
ual rode out to his farms at about 10  
&#x27;clock and did not return home till past  
1. Soon after he went out the weather  
xcamo very bad, rain, liail and snow  
&#x27;ailing alternately, with a cold wind.  
iVhon he came in I carried some letters  
io him to frank, intending to send them  
the post-o.ni. He franked the let­  
iers, but said the weather was too bad to  
tend a messenger to the office that even­  
rig.I observed to him ihat I was afraid he  
lad got wet; ho ra:d no, his great coat  
lad kept him dry. But his neck appear­  
id to be wet, the snow was hanging on  
lis hair. He came to dinner without  
hanging his dress. In the evening he  
ippe.ared as well as usual. A heavy fall  
f snow took place Friday, which rre-  
fented the General from ridinsr out as  
lsual. He had taken cold, undoubtedly  
ironi being so much exposed the day be-  
oru, ii&#x27;iu compiaineu 01 naving a sore  
.hroat; he had a hoarseness, which in-  
srens&#x27;.d in the evening:, but he made  
.ight of it, as he would never take any­  
ihing to cany off a cold, always observ­  
iig, &quot;Let it go as it came.&quot; In the  
svening, the papers having come from  
lie post-office, he sat in the room with  
Mrs. Washington and mvself readinc  
;hem till about nine o&#x27;clock, and when  
ae met with an j&#x27;thing he thought divert  
ing or interesting he would read it aloud.  
tie desired me to read him the debates  
)f the Virginia Assembly on the election  
f a Senator and Governor, which T did.  
Dn his retiring t j bed he appeared to be  
In perfect health, except the cold, which  
3 .uin:ut&#x27;inun9 iiuuiifue una ueen re-  
markably cheerful all the evening.  
Aooiu z or a o clock on Saturday  
morning he awoke Mrs. Washington  
md informed her he was very unwell  
nd had an ague. She observed that  
ne could scarcely speak and breathed  
vith difficulty, and she wished to get  
ap and call a servant, but the Gen-  
srai would not permit her lest she  
should take cold. As soon a the day  
ippeared the woman, Caroline, went  
into the room to make a lire, and thn  
irl desired that Mr. Rawlins, one of the  
overseers, who was used to bleedinc the  
people, might be tent for to bleed him  
uefore the go ;tor could arrive. I was  
sent for, and went to the General &#x27;x  
chamber, where Mrs. Washington wns  
ap and related to me his being taken ill  
between. 2 and 3 o&#x27;clock, as lwfor  
tated.  
I found him breathinor with difflcultv.  
And hardly able to utter a w ord intel&#x27;li-  
ribiy. 1 went out instantly and wrote  
1 lino to lr. I&#x27;hisU and sent it with all  
speed. Immediately I returned to the  
Uenend&#x27;s cliamlier, where I found him  
in tbe wime position I had left him. A  
mixture of molasses, vinegar and butter  
was prepared, but he could not swallow  
a drop. Whenever he attempted it he  
was distressed, convulsed aud almost  
BuffocatoiL Mr. Rawlins came in soon  
after sunrise and prepared to bleed him.  
When the arm was ready the General,  
observing Rawlins apjieared agitated,  
said with difficulty, &quot;Don&#x27;t lie afraid,&quot;  
and after tho incision was made he ol-  
served the orifice was not large enough.  
However, the blood ran rather freely.  
Mrs. Washington, not knowing whether  
bleeding was proper in the General&#x27;s  
condition, begged that much might not  
le taken from him, and desired me to  
stop it. When I was aliout to untie the  
string tho General put up his hand to  
prevent it, and, soon as he could speak,  
said, &quot;More.&quot;  
Mrs. Washington, still uneasy lest too  
much blood should be taken, it was  
stopped after about half a pint had been  
taken. Finding that no relief was ob­  
tained from bleeding and nothing could  
be swallowed, I proposed bathing the  
throat externally with sal volatile, which  
Wns done. A piece of flannel was then  
put arouricl his neck. His feet were also  
s laked in w arm water, but it gave no re­  
lief. By Mrs. Washington&#x27;s request I  
despatched a messenger for Dr. Brown,  
at Port Tobacco. About 9 o&#x27;clock Dr.  
Craik arrived and put a blister of can­  
tharides on the, throat of the General,  
and took more blood, and had some vin­  
egar and hot water set in a teapot for  
him to draw in the fumes from the noz­  
zle. He also had tea and vinegar mixed  
and used as a gargle, but when he held  
back his head to let it ran down, it al­  
most produced suffocation. When the  
mixture came out of his mouth some  
phlegm followed it, and he would at­  
tempt to cough, which the doctor en­  
couraged, but without effect. About 11  
o&#x27;clock Dr. Dick was sent for. Dr. Craik  
bled the General again; no effect was  
produced, and he continued in the same  
state, unable to swallow anything. Dr.  
Dick came in about 3 o&#x27;clock and Dr.  
Brown arrived soon after, when, after  
consultation, the General was bled  
again; the blood ran slowly, appeared  
very thick, and did not produce any  
symptoms of fainting.  
At 4 o&#x27;clock the General could swal­  
low a little. Calomel and tarter, emetic  
were administered without effect. &quot;Aliout  
4.E0 o&#x27;clock he desired me to ask Mrs.  
Washington to come to his bedside,  
when he desired her to go down to his  
room nnd take from his desk two wills  
which the would find there and bring  
them to him, which she did. Upon  
looking at one which ho observed was  
useless, ho desired her to burn it, which  
she did, and then took the other and  
put it away. After this was done I re­  
turned again to his bedside and took his  
hand. He said to me: &quot;I find I am  
foing my breath cannot continue long,  
believed from tin) first, attack it would  
bo fatal. Do you arrange find record all  
my military letters nnd papers; arrange  
my accounts and settle my books, ns you  
know more about them than any one  
else, and let Mr. Rawlins finish record  
ing my other letters, which he has  
brgun.&quot;  
He as ked when Mr. Lewis would  
return. I told him I believed lib; ut  
the 29th of the month. Ho made no  
reply to it. The physicians again came  
in (between 5 and 6 o&#x27;clock), an d when  
they came to his bedside Dr. Craik  
asked him if he would sit up in the  
bed. He held out his hand to me and  
was raised up, when lie said to the phy­  
sicians:&quot;I feel myself going you had lx&#x27;tter  
not take any more trouble about me,  
but let mo go off quietly; I cannot last  
long.&quot;  
They found what had been done was  
without effect; he lay down again and  
they retired, excepting Dr. Craik. He  
then said to him: &quot;Doctor, I die hard,  
butl am iiot afraid to go; I believed  
from my first attack I should not sur­  
vive it; my breath cannot last long.&quot;  
The doctor prersed &#x27;&#x27;.is hand, but  
could not utter a word; he retired from  
the bedside and sat by the fire, absorbed  
ill grief. About 8 o&#x27;clock the physicians  
npnin came into the room and applied  
blisters to his legs, but went out with­  
out a ray of lure.  
From this tim o he appeared to breathe  
with less difficulty than he had done:  
but M as very restless, CQritiuunllychaug-  
  
ing his position to endeavor to get ease.  
I aided him in all my power, and wns  
gratified in ljolieving he felt it, for he  
would look upon me with eyes sxaking  
gratitude, but wns unable to utter a  
word without great distress.  
Aliout 10 o&#x27;clor-k he made several at­  
tempts to sj:e.ik to me before he could  
effect it. At length he said: &quot;I am just  
going. Have me decently burled, and

JRThe following circumstantial account of  
the last illness and death of General George  
Washington was noted by Tobias Lear on  
the Sunday following his death, which hap­  
pened on Saturday evening, December 14,  
1793, between the hours of 10 and 11.  
On Thursday, December 13, the General  
rode out to his farms at about 10 o&#x27;clock,and  
did not return home till past 3. Soon after  
he went out the weather became very bad,  
rain, hail and snow falling alternately, with  
a cold wind. When he came in I carried  
some letters to him to frank, intending to  
send them to the postoffice. He franked the  
letters, but said the weather was too bad to  
send a servant to the office thai evening. I  
observed to him that I was afraid he had got  
wet; he said no, his great coat had kept him  
dry. But his neck appeared to be wet; the  
snow was hanging on his hair. He came to  
dinner without changing his dress. In the  
evening he appeared as well as usual.  
A heavy fall of snow took place on Fri­  
day, which prevented the General Irom  
riding out, as usual. He had taken cold  
undoubtedly from being so much exposed  
the day before, and complained&#x27;of having a  
sore throat; he had a hoarseness, which in­  
creased in the evening, but he made light of  
it, as he wonld never take anything to carry  
on a cold, always observing, &quot;.Let it go as  
it came.&quot; In the evening, the papers  
bavin? come from the rjostoffice. he sat in  
the room with Mrs. Washington and myself  
reading them till abont 9 o&#x27;clock, and when  
he met with anything which he thought  
diverting &#x27;or interesting he would read it  
aloud. He desired me to read to him the  
debates of the Virginia Assembly on tbe  
election of a Senator and Governor, which I  
did. On bis retiring to bed he appeared to  
be in perfect health, except the cold, which  
he considered as trifling. He had been re­  
markably cheerful all -the evening.  
THE FIBST ATTACK.  
About 2 or 3 o&#x27;clock on Saturday morning  
he awoke Mrs. Washington and informed  
her that he was very unwell and had an  
ague. She observed that he could scarcely  
speak and breathed with difficulty, and she  
wished to get up and call a servant, but the  
General would not permit her lest she should  
take cold. As soon as the day appeared the  
woman, Caroline, went into the room to  
make a fire, and the girl desired that Mr.  
Bawlins, one of the overseers, who was used  
to bleeding the people, might be sent for to  
bleed him before the doctor could arrive. I  
was sent for, and went to the General&#x27;s  
chamber, where Mrs.) Washington was up,  
and related to me his being taken ill be­  
tween 2 and 3 o&#x27;clock, as before stated.  
I found him breathing with difficulty and  
hardly able to utter a word intelligibly. I  
went out instantly and wrote a line to Dr.  
Plask and sent itwith all speed. Immedi­  
ately I returned to the General&#x27;s chamber,  
where I found him in the same situation I  
had left him. A mixture of molasses, vine  
gar and butter was prepared, but he could  
not swallow a drop. Whenever he at­  
tempted it he was distressed, convulsed and  
almost suffocated. Mr. Bawlins came in  
soon after sunrise and prepared to bleed  
him. When the arm was ready the General,  
observing that Bawlins appeared agitated,  
said, with difficulty: &quot;Don&#x27;t be afraid,&quot;  
and after the incision had been made he ob  
served the orifice was not large enough.  
However, the blood ran pretty freely.  
Mrs. Washington, not knowing whether  
bleeding was proper in the General&#x27;s condi­  
tion, begged teat much might not be taken  
from him, and desired me to stop it. When  
I was about to untie the strine the General  
put up his hand to prevent it, and as soon  
as he conld speak, said: &quot;More.&quot;  
MBS., WASHINGTON&#x27;S FEAES.  
Mrs. Washington, still uneasy lest too  
much blood should be taken, it was stopped  
after about half a pint had been taken.  
Finding that no relief was obtained from  
bleeding and nothing could be swallowed, I  
proposed bathing the throat externally with  
sal volatile, which was done. A piece of  
flannel was then put,, around his neck. His  
&#x27;feet were also soaked in warm water, but i

the fumes from the nozzle. He also had tea  
and vinegar mixed and used as a gargle, H  
but when be held back his head to let it run  
down it almost produced suffocation. When  
the mixture came out of his mouth some  
phlegm followed it, and he would attempt  
to cough, which the, doctor encouraged, but  
without effect.  
About 11 o&#x27;clock Dr. DicK was sent for.  
Dr. Craik bled the General again; no effect  
was produced, and he continued in the same  
state, unable to swallow anything. Dr.  
Dick came in about 3 o&#x27;clock, and Dr.  
Brown arrived soon after, when, after con­  
sultation, the General was bled again; the  
blood ran slowly, appeared very thick,  
and did not produce any symptoms of faint  
ing.  
At 4 o&#x27;clock the General could swallow a  
little. Calomel and tartar emetic were ad­  
ministered without effect. About 4:30  
o&#x27;clock he desired me to ask Jlrs. Washing­  
ton to come to his bedside, when he desired  
her to go down to his room and take from  
his desk two wills, which she would find  
there, and bring tnem to him, which she  
did. Upon looking at one, whUh he ob­  
served was useless, he desired her to burn  
it, which she did, and then took the other  
and put it away. After this was done I  
returned again to his bedside and took his  
hand. He said to me: &quot;I hnd JL am going;  
my breath cannot continue long. I be­  
lieved from the first attack it wouldbe fatal.  
Do you arrange and record all my military  
letters and papers; arrange my accounts and  
settle my books, as yon knew more about  
them than any one else, and let Mr. Rawlins  
finish recording my other letters, which he  
has begun.&quot;  
IHE CLOSING SCENES.  
He asked when Mr. Lewis would return.  
I told him I Relieved abont the 20th of the  
month. He made no reply to it. The  
physicians acain came in (between 5 and 6  
o&#x27;clock), and when they came to his bedside  
Dr. Craik asked him if he would sit up In  
the bed. Hi held out his hand to me and  
was raised rip, when he said to the physi­  
cians:&quot;I feel myself going yon had better not  
take any more tronble about me, but let me  
go off quietly; I cannot last long.&quot;  
They found what had been done was with­  
out effect; he lay down again and they re­  
tired, excenting Dr. Craik. He then said  
to him: &quot;Doctor, I die hard, bnt I am not  
afraid to go; I believed from my first attack  
that I should not survive it; my breath can­  
not last long.&quot;  
The doctor pressed his hand,but could not  
utter a word; he retired from the bedside  
and sat by the fire, absorbed in grief. Abont

me with eyes speaking gratitude, bui was  
unable to utter a word without great dis­  
tress.Abont 10 o&#x27;clock He made several attempts  
to speak to me. At length .he said: &#x27;Tain

The following circumstantial account of  
the last illness and death of Gen. George  
Washington was noted by Tobias Lear  
on the Sunday following his death,  
which happened on Saturday evening,  
Dec. 14,1798, between the hours of 10  
and 11:  
On Thursday, Dec. 12, the General rode  
out to his farms at about 10 o&#x27;clock and  
did not return home till past 3. Soon  
after he went out the weather became  
very bad, rain, hail and snow falling  
alternately, with a cold wind, When he  
came in I carried some letters to him to  
frank, intending to send them to the  
postoffice. He franked the letters, but  
: said the weather was too bad to Bend a  
[ servant to the office that evening.  
I observed to him that I was afraid he  
had got wet; he said no, his great coat  
had kept him dry. But his neck appear?  
ed to be wet, the enow was hanging on  
his hair. He came to dinner without  
changing his dress. In the evening he  
appeared as well as usual. A heavy fall  
of snow took place on Friday, which  
prevented the General from riding out.  
as usual. He had taken cold, undoubt?  
edly from being bo much exposed the  
day before, and complained of having a  
sore throat; he had a hoarseness, which  
increased in the evening, but he made  
light of it, as he would never take any?  
thing to carry off a cold, always observ?  
ing, &quot;Let it go as it came.&quot; In the  
evening, the papers having come from  
the post office, he sat in the room with  
Mrs. Washington,* and myself, reading  
them till about nine o&#x27;clock, and when  
he met with anything w&quot;Eich he thought  
diverting or interesting he would read it  
aloud. He desired me to read to him  
the debates of the Virginia Assembly on  
the election of a Senator and Governor,  
which I did. On his retiring to bed he  
appeared to be in perfect health, except  
the cold, which he considered as trifling;  
he had been remarkably cheerful all the  
evening.  
About 2 or 3 o&#x27;clock on Saturday  
morning he awoke Mrs. Washington and  
informed her he was very unwell and had  
an ague. She observed that he could  
scarcely speak and breathed with diffi?  
culty, and she wished to get up and call  
a servant, but the General, would not  
permit her lest she should take cold. As  
soon as the day appeared the woman,  
Caroline, went into the room to make a  
fire, and the girl desired that Mr. Raw­  
I ins, one of the overseers, who was used  
to bleeding the people, might be aent for  
to bleed him before the doctor could ar?  
rive. I was sent for, and went to the  
General&#x27;s chamber, where Mrs. Washing?  
ton was up and related to me his being  
taken ill between 2 and 3 o&#x27;clock, as  
before stated.  
I found him breathing with difficulty  
and hardly able to utter a word intelli?  
gibly. I went out instantly and wrote a  
line to Dr. Flask and sent it with all  
speeed. Immediately I returned to the  
General&#x27;s chamber, where I found him  
in the same situation I had left him.&#x27; A  
mixture of molasses, vinegar and butter  
was prepared, but he could not swallow  
a drop. Whenever he attempted it he  
was distressed, convulsed and almost  
suffocated. Mr. Rawlins came in soon  
after sunrise and prepared to bleed bim.  
When the arm was ready, the General,  
observing Rawlins appeared agitated,  
Baid with difficulty, &quot;Don&#x27;t be afraid,&quot; and  
after the incision was made he observed  
the orifice was not large enough, How?  
ever, the blood ran pretty freely. Mrs.  
Washington, not knowing whether bleed?  
ing was proper in the Generali condition,  
begged that much might not be taken  
from him, and desired me to stop it.  
When I was about to prevent it, he, so  
soon as he could speak, said, &quot;More.&quot;  
Mrs. Washington, still uneasy leat  
too much blood should be taken, it was  
stopped after about half a pint had been  
taken. Finding that no relief was  
obtained from bleeding and nothing could  
be swallowed, I proposed bathing the  
throat externally with sal volatile, wh:oh  
was done. A piece of flannel was tljn  
put round his neck. His feet were also  
soaked in warm water, but it gave no re?  
lief. By Mrs. Washington&#x27;s request I  
despatched a messenger for Doctor Brown,  
at Port Tobacco. About 9 o&#x27;clock Doc?  
tor Craik arrived and put a blister of  
cantharides on the throat of the General,  
and took more blood, and had some vine?  
gar and hot water set in a teapot for him  
to draw in the fumes from the nozzle.  
He also had tea and vinegar mixed and  
used as a gargle, but when he held back  
his head to let it run down, it almost  
produced sufioca tio a. When the mixture  
came out of his mouth some phlegm fol?  
lowed it, and he would attempt to cough,  
which the doctor encouraged, but with?  
out effect. About 11 o&#x27;clock Dr. Dick  
was sent for. Dr. Craik bled the General  
again ; no effect was produced, and he  
continued in the same state, unable to  
swallow anything. Dr. Dick came in  
about 3 o&#x27;clock and Dr. Brown arrived  
soon after, when, after consultation, the  
General was bled again; the blood ran  
slowly, appeared very thick, and did not  
produce any symptoms of fainting.  
At 4 o&#x27;clock the General could swallow  
a little. Calomel and tartar emetic were  
administered without effect, About  
4.30 o&#x27;clock he desired me to aak Mrs.  
Washington to come to his bedside,  
when he desired her to go down to his

put it away. After this was done I re?  
turned again to his bedside and took his

my accounts and settle my books, aa you  
know more about them than any one else,  
and let Mr. RawlinB finish iecording my  
other letters, which he has begun.&quot;  
He asked when Mr. Lewis would re?  
turn. I told him I believed about the  
20th of tho month. He made no reply  
to it. The physicians again came in (be?  
tween 5 and 6 o&#x27;clock), and when they  
came to his bedside Dr, Crajk asked him  
  
if he would ait up in the bed. He held  
out his hand to me and was raised up,  
when he said to the physicians:  
&quot;I feel myself going?you had better  
not take any more, trouble about me,  
but let me go off quietly; I can not last  
long.&quot;  
They found what had been done was  
without effect; he lay down again and  
they retired, excepting Dr. Craik. He  
then said to him : &quot;Doctor, I die hard,  
bat I am not afraid to go; I believed  
from ray first attack I should not survive  
it; my breath can not last long.&quot;  
The doctor pressed his hand, but could  
not utter a word; he retired from the  
bedside and sat by the fire, absorbed in  
grief. About 8 o&#x27;clock the physician  
again came into the room and applied  
blisters to his legs, but went out without  
a ray of hope.  
From this time he appeared to breathe  
with less difficulty than he had done, but  
was very restless, continually changing  
his position to endeavor to get ease. I  
aided him all in my &#x27; power, and was  
gratified in believing he ielt it, for he  
would look upon me with eyes speaking  
gratitude, but wa3 unable to utter a word  
without great distress.  
About 10 o&#x27;clock he made several at?  
tempts to speak to me before he could  
effect it. At length he said: &quot;I am just  
going. Have me decently buried, and  
do not let my body be put into the vault  
in less than two days after I am dead.&quot;  
I bowed assent. He looked at me  
again and said : &quot;Do you understand  
me ?&quot; I replied, &quot;Yes, sir.&quot; &quot; &#x27;Tis well,&quot;  
said he.  
About ten minutes before he expired  
his breathing became much easier ; he  
lay quietly; he withdrew his hand .from  
mine and felt his own pulse. I spoke to  
Dr. Craik, who sat by the fire; he came  
to the bedside. The General&#x27;s hand fell  
from his wrist. I took it in mine and  
placed it on his breast, Dr. Craik placed  
his hands over his eyes, and be expired  
without a struggle or a sigh,

About 10 o&#x27;clock ho made several at­

do not let my body be put into the vault

About ten minutes before ha expired

Dr. Craik, who sat by the tire; he came  
to the liedsido. ihe Generals hand  
fell from his wrist; I took it in mine and  
placed it ou his breast. Dr. Craik  
placed his hands over his eyes, and he  
expired winiout a struggle or a sigh.

The following circumstantial ac­  
count of the last illness and death  
of Gen. George Washington was  
noted by Tobias Lear on the Sunday  
following his death, which happened  
on Saturday evening, December 14,  
1799, between the hours of 10 and  
11:  
On Thursday, December 12, the  
General, rode out to his farm at about  
10 o&#x27;clock, and did not return home  
till past 3. Soon after he went out  
the weather became very bad, rain,  
hail and snow falling alternately,  
with a cold wind. hen he came  
in I carried some letters to him to  
frank, intending to send them to the  
postoffice. He franked the letters,  
but said the weather was too bad to  
send a servant to the office that eve  
ning.  
I observed to him that I was afraid  
that he had got wet ; he said no, his  
great coat had kept him dry. But  
his neck appeared to be wet; the  
suow was hanging on his hair. He  
came to dinner without changing  
his dress. In the evening he appear  
ed as well as usual. A heavy fall of  
snow took place on Friday, which  
prevented the General from riding  
out as usual&#x27;. He had taken cold  
undoubtedly from being so much  
eiposed the day before, and com  
plained of having a sore throat ; he  
had a hoarseness, which increased  
in the evening, but he made light of  
it, as he would never take anything  
to carry off a cold, always observing,  
&quot;Let it go as it came,&quot; In the eve­  
ning, the papers having come from  
the postoffice, he sat in the room  
with Mrs. Washington and myself  
reading them till about 9 o&#x27;clock  
and when he met with anything  
which he thought diverting or inter­  
esting he would read it aloud. He  
desired me to read to him the de­  
bates of the Virginia Assembly on  
the election of a Senator and Gov­  
crner, which I did. On his retiring  
to bed he appeared to be in perfect  
health, except the cold, which he  
considered as trifling; he had been  
remarkably cheerful all the evening.  
About 2 or 3 o&#x27;clock on Saturday  
morning he awoke Mrs. Washington  
and informed her that he was very  
unwell and had an ague. She ob­  
served that he could scarcely speak  
and breathed with difficulty, and she  
wished to git up and call a servant,  
  
YOL. II. NO, 16.  
  
but the General would not permit  
her, lest she should take cold. As  
soon as the day appeared the woman,  
Caroline, went into the room to make  
a fire, and the girl desired that Mr.  
Rawlins, one of the overseerB, who  
was used to bleeding the people,  
might be sent for to bleed him before  
the doctor could arrive., I was eeut  
for and wont to the General&#x27;s cham­  
ber, where Mrs. Washington was up  
and related to me his being taken ill  
between 2 and 3 o&#x27;clock, as before  
stated.  
I found him breathing with diffi­  
culty and hardly able to utter aword  
intelligibly. I went out instantly  
and wrote a line to Dr. Plask and  
sent it with all speed Immediately  
I returned to the General&#x27;s chamber,  
where I fouad him inthe sameit  
nation I had left him. A mixture  
ef molasses, vinegar and butter was  
prepared, but he could not swallow  
a drop. Whenever he attempted it  
he was distressed, convulsed and al­  
most suffocated. Mr. Rawlins came  
m soon after sunrise and prepared to  
bl h1 him. When the arm was ready,  
the General, observing that Rawlins  
appeared agitated, said withdifficulty,-  
&quot;Don&#x27;t be afra&#x27;3,&quot; and after  
the incision was inadv he ; observed  
the orifice was r.ot arge enough.  
However, tho blood ran pretty freely.  
Mrs. Washington, not Lr owing  
whether bleeding wa3 proper in the  
General&#x27;s condition, begged that  
much might not be taken from him,  
and desired me to stop it. When I  
was about to unite the string the  
General put up his hand to prevent  
it, and as soon as he could speak he  
said, &quot;More.&quot;  
Mrs. Washington, still uneasy lust  
too much blood should be taken,  
it wa3 stopped after about half pint  
had been takeu.Finding that no re­  
lief was obtained from bleeding and  
nothing could be swallowed, I pro­  
posed bathing the throat externally  
with sal volatile, which was done.  
A piece of flannel was then put  
around his neck. His feet were also  
soaked in warm water, - but it gave  
no&quot; relief. By Mrs. Washington&#x27;s  
request I dispatched a messenger for  
Dr. Brown, at Port Tobacco. About  
o&#x27;clock Dr. Craik arrived and put  
a blister of cantharides on the throat  
of the General and took more blood,  
and had some vinegar aud hot water  
set in a teapot for him to draw in  
the fumes from the nozzle. lie  
had tea and vinegar mixed and  
used as a cargle, but when he held  
back hi3 head to let it Tim down, it  
almost produced suffocation. When  
the mixture came out of&quot; his mouth  
some phlegm followed it, aud he  
would attempt to cough, which the  
doctor encouraged, but without ef  
fect. About 11 o&#x27;clock Dr. Dick  
was sent for. . Dr. Craik bled the  
General again; no effect was pro  
duced and he continued in the same  
state, unable to swallow anything,  
Dr. Dick came in about 3 o&#x27;clock  
and Dr. Brown arrived soon after,  
when, after consultation, the General  
was bled again ; the blood ran slow  
lv, appeared very thick, and did not  
produce any symptoms of faiut  
At 4 o&#x27;clock the General could  
swallow a little. Calomel and tartar  
emetic were administered without  
effect. About 4:30 o&#x27;clock he desired  
me to ask Mrs. Washington to come  
to his bedside, when he desired her to  
go down to his room and take from  
his desk two will3 which she should  
find there and bring them to him,  
which she did. Upon looking at  
one, which he observed was useless,  
he desired her to burn it, which she  
did, and then took the other and -pat  
it away. After this was done I re  
turned again to his bedside and took  
his hand. He said to me : &quot;I find  
I am going my breath can not con  
tinue long. I believed from the  
first attack it would be fatal. Do  
you arrange and record all my nili­  
tary letters and papers ; arrange my  
accounts and settle my books, as you  
know more about them than any one  
else, and let Mr. Iiawlins finish re­  
cording my other letters, which he  
has begun.&quot;  
He asked when Mr. Lewis would  
return. I told him I believed about  
the 20th of the nionth. He made  
no reply to it. The physicians again  
came in (between 5 and 6 o&#x27;clock,)  
and when they came to his bedside  
Dr. Craik asked him if he would sit  
up in the bed. He held out bis  
hand to me and was raised up, when  
he said to the physicians :  
&quot;I feel myself going you had  
better not take any more trouble  
about me, but let me go off quietly ;  
I cannot last long.&quot;  
They found what had been done  
wa3 without effect; he lay down  
again aud they retired, . excepting  
Dr.. Craik. He then said -to him:  
&quot;Doctor, I die hard, but I am not  
afraid to go; I believed from my  
  
rn  
  
first attack I should not survive it;  
my breath cannot last long.&quot;  
The doctor pressed his hand, but  
could not utter a word; he retired  
from the bedside and sat by the fire,  
absorbed in grief. About 8 o&#x27;clock  
the physicians again, came into the  
room and applied blisters to his legs,  
but went out without a ray of hope.  
From this time he appeared to  
breathe with less difficulty than he  
had done, but was very restless, con  
tinually changing his position to  
endeavor to get ease. I aided him  
all in my power, and was gratified  
in believing he felt it, for he would  
ook upon me with eyes speaking  
gratitude, but was unable to utter  
a word without great distress.  
About 10 o&#x27;clock he made several  
attempts to speak to me before he  
could effect it. At length he said:  
&quot;I am just going. Have me decently  
buried, and do not let my body be  
put into the vault in less than two  
days after I am dead.&quot;  
I bowed assent. He looked at me  
again and said : &quot;Do you under­  
stand me ?&quot; I replied, &quot;Yes, sir.&quot;  
&#x27;Ti&#x27;o woll aaiA lio  
About ten minutes before he ex.  
pired his breathing became much  
easier: he lav quietly; he withdrew  
his hand from mine and felt his own  
pulse. I speke to Dr. Craik, who  
sat by the fire ; he canie to the bed­  
side. The General&#x27;s hand fell from  
his wrist ; I took it in mine and  
placed it on his breasL Dr. Craik  
placed his hands over his eyes, and  
he expired without a struggle or a  
sigh.  
While we were fixed in silent grief  
Mrs. Washington asked in a firm  
and collected voice, &quot;Is he gone ?

Tlie following circumstantial account of the  
lat illness and death of (Jen. George Washing­  
ton was noted by Tobias Iar on the Sunday  
following his death, which happened on Satur­  
day evenine, lec. 14, 17&#x27;Ji between the hours  
of 10 and 11:  
&quot;Oa Thursday, Dec. 12, the tjeneral rode out  
to his farms ut about 10 o&#x27;clock, and did not re­  
turn home till past 3. Soon after he went out  
the wenther became very bad, rain, hail and  
snow falling alternately, with a cold wind.  
When he came in I carried some letters to him  
to frank, intending to semi them to the ostot­  
liee. He franked the letters, but paid the  
weather was too bad to send a servant to the  
ollice that evening.  
&quot;I observed to him that I was afraid he had  
got wet. llenaid no, his great coat had kept  
him dry. Hut his neck appeared to be wet; the  
snow was hanging on his hair. He came to  
dinner without changing his dress. In the  
evening he appeared as well as usual. A heavy  
fall of snow took place on Friday, which pre­  
vented the general from riding out as usuaL  
He had taken cold undoubtedly from being so  
much exposed the day before, and complained  
of having a sore throat; he had a hoarseness,  
which increased in the evening, but he made  
litht of it, as he would never take anything to  
carry o!l a cold, always observing, &#x27;let it go as  
it came.&#x27; In the evenin?, the papers having  
come from the postofiice, he sat In the room  
with Mrs. Washington and myself reading them  
till about 9 o&#x27;clock, and when he met with any­  
thing which he thought divertingor interesting  
he would read it aloud. He desired me to read  
to him the debates of the Virginia assembly on  
the election of a senator and governor, which I  
did. On his retiring to bed he appeared to he  
in perfect health, except the cold, which he  
considered as trilling; lie had been remarkably  
cheerful all the evening.  
&quot;About 2 or 3 o&#x27;clock on Saturday morning  
he awoke Mrs. Washington and informed her  
that he was very unwell and had an ague. She  
observed that he could scarcely speak and  
breathed with difficulty, and he wuhed to get  
up and ca!l a servant, but the general would  
not permit her, lest she should take cold. As  
soon as the day appeared the woman, Caroline,  
went into the room to make a fire, and the girl  
desired that Mr. Kawlins, one of the overseers,  
who was used to bleeding the people, might be  
sent for to bleed him before the doctor could  
arrive. I was sent for and went to the gener­  
al&#x27;s chamber, where Mrs. Washington was up  
aud related to me his being taken ill between 2  
and 3 o&#x27;clock, as before stated.  
&quot;I found him breathing with difficulty and  
hardly able to utter a word intelligibly. 1 went  
out instantly and wrote a line to Ir. l&#x27;lask ami  
sent it with all speed. Immediately I returned  
to the general&#x27;s chamber, where I found him in  
the same situation I had left him. A mixture  
of molasses, vinegar and butter was prepared,  
but he could not swallow a drop. Whenever  
lie attempted it he was distressed, convulsed  
and almost su (located. Mr. Rawlins came in  
soon after sunrise and prepared to bleed him.  
When the arm was ready tlie general, observing  
that llawlins appeared agitated, said with diffi­  
culty, &#x27;Don&#x27;t be afraid,&#x27; and after the incision  
was made he observed the orifice was not lare  
enough. However, the blood ran pretty freely,  
Mrs. Washincton, not knowing whether bleed­  
ing was proper in the general&#x27;s condition,  
begged that much might not be taken from  
him, and desired me to stop it. When I was  
about to untie the string the general put up his  
hand to prevent it, aud as 60on aa he could  
rpcak saitt, &#x27;More.&#x27;  
&quot;Mrs. Washington, still uneasy lest too much  
blood should be taken, it was stopped after  
about half a pint had been taken. Finding  
that no relief was obtained from bleeding and  
nothing cou&#x27;d be swallowed, I proposed bath­  
ing the throat externally with sal volatile,  
which was done. A piece of flannel was then  
put around his neck. His feet were also soaked  
in warm water, but it gave no relief, lij Mrs.  
Washington&#x27;s request I dispatched a messenger  
for Dr. Brown at Port Tobacco. About 9  
o&#x27;clock Dr. Craik arrived and put ablister o

fumes from the nozzle. He also had tea and  
vinegar mixed and used as a gargle, but when  
he held back his head to let it run down it al­  
most produced suffocation. When the mixture

it, and he would attempt to cough, which the  
doctor encouraged, but without etlect About  
11 o&#x27;clock Dr. Dick was sent for. Dr. Craik  
bled the general again; no eifect was produced

o&#x27;clock and Dr. Brown arrived soon after, when,  
after consultation, the general was bled again;  
the blood ran slowly, appeared very thick, and  
did not produce any symptoms of fainting.

sired me to ask Mrs. Washington to come to  
his bedside, when he desired her to go down to  
his room and take from his desk two will  
which she would find there and bring them to  
him, which she did. Upon looking at one,  
which he observed was useless, he desired her  
to burn it, which she did, and then took the  
other and put it away. After this was done I  
returned agnin to his bedside ard took his  
hand. He said to me: &#x27;I find I am going my  
breath cannot continue long. 1 believed from  
the first attack it would be fatal. Do you ar­  
range and record all my military letters and  
papers; arrange my accounts and s ttle my  
books, as you know more about them than any  
one else, and let Mr. Kawlins finish recording  
my other letters, which he has begun.&#x27;  
&quot;He asked when Mr. Lewis would retnrn. I  
told hini 1 believed about the 20ih of the month,  
lie made no reply to it. The physicians again  
came in (between ö and o&#x27;clock), and when  
they came to his bedsi.ie Dr. Craik asked him  
if he would sit up in the bed. He held out his  
hand to me and was raised up, wheu he said to  
the physicians:  
&quot;&#x27;I feel myself going; you had better not  
take any more trouble about me, but let me &#x27;o  
oft&quot; quietly; I cannot last long.&#x27;  
&quot;They found what had been done was with­  
out effect; he lay down sgain and they retired,  
excepting Dr. Craik. He then said to him:  
&#x27;Doctor, I die hard, but I am not afraid to po;  
I believed from my first attack 1 should not  
survive it; my breath cannot last lng.&#x27;  
&quot;The doctor pressed his hand, but could not  
utter a word: he retired from the bedsid and  
sat by the liret phsorbed in giief. About  
o&#x27;clock the physicians aain came into the  
room and applied blisters to his legs, but went  
out without a ray of bop.  
&quot;From this time he appeared to breathe with  
less difficulty than he had dune, hut was very  
restless, continually changing his position to  
endeavor to get ease. 1 aided him in all my  
power and was gratilied in believing he felt it,  
for he would look upon me with eyes speaking  
gratitude, but was unable to utter a word with­  
out great distress.  
&quot;About 10 o&#x27;clock he made several attempts  
to speak to me before he could ellect it. At  
length he said: &#x27;I am just going. Have me  
decently buried, and do not let my body be put  
into the vault in less than two days after I am  
dead.&#x27;  
&quot;I bowed assent. He looked at me again and  
said: &#x27;Do you understand me?&#x27; I replied,  
&#x27;Yes, sir.&#x27; &#x27;Tis well,&#x27; iaid he.  
&quot;About ten minutes before he expired his  
breathing became much eaier; he lay quietly;  
he withdrew his hand from mine and felt bis  
own puls. 1 spoke to Dr. Craik. ho sat by  
the lire: he came to the bedside. The general&#x27;s  
hand fell from his wrist; I took it iu mine and  
Iilaced it on his breast. Dr. Craik plaeeJ his  
lands over his eyes, and he expired without a  
8trusri.de or a sigh.  
&quot;While we were fixed in iient grief Mrs.  
Washington asked in a firm and collected  
voice, &#x27;Is he gone?&#x27;

Vinegar &amp; Butter was prepared, to try its effect in the throat; but he could  
not swallow a drop, whenever he attempted it he appeared to be distressed,  
convulsed, and almost suffocated.—Mr. Rawlins came in soon after sun rise  
—and prepared to bleed him. When the Arm was ready—the General,  
observing that Rawlins appeared to be agitated, said, as well as he could  
speak, “ dont be afraid,” and after the incision was made, he observed,  
“ the orifice is not large enough.&quot;” However, the blood ran pretty freely.—  
Mrs. Washington, not knowing whether bleeding was proper or not in the Gen-  
eral’s situation ; beg’d that much might not betaken from him, lest it should  
be injurious, and desired me to stop it ; but when I was about to untie the  
string, the general put up his hand to prevent it, and as soon as he could  
speak, he said ‘‘ more.” —Mrs. W. being still uneasy lest too much blood  
should be taken, it was stop’d after about half a pint was taken from him.—  
Finding that no relief was obtained from bleeding, and that nothing would  
go down the throat, I proposed bathing the throat externally with Salva-  
lattita, which was done, and in the operation, which was with the hand, and  
in the gentlest manner, he observed &#x27;#s very sore. A piece of flannel was  
then put round his neck. His feet were also soaked in warm water.—This,  
however, gave no relief.—In the mean time, before Doctor Craik arrived,  
Mrs. Washington requested me to send for Doct. Brown of Port Tobacco,  
whom Doctor Craik had recommended to be called, if any case should  
ever occur that was seriously alarming.—I dispatched a Messenger  
(Cyrus) to Dr. Brown immediately (about nine o’clk)—Doctor Craik came  
in soon after, and upon examining the General he put a blister of canthardis  
on the throat &amp; took more blood from him, and had some Vinegar &amp; hot  
water put into a Teapot, for the General to draw in the steam from the nozel—  
which he did, as well as he was able.—He also ordered sage tea and Vine-  
gar to be mixed for a Gargle.—This the General used as often as desired ;  
but when he held back his head to let it run down, it put him into great dis- -  
tress and almost produced suffocation. When the mixture came out of his  
mouth some phlegm followed it, and he would attempt to cough, which the  
Doctor encouraged him to do as much as he could; but without effect, he  
could only make the attempt.—About eleven o’clock Dr. Dick was sent  
for.—Dr. Craik bled the General again about this time.—No effect, however,  
was produced by it, and he continued in the same state, unable to swallow  
anything.—Doctor Dick camein about 3 o’clk, and Dr. Brown arrived soon  
after.—Upon Dr. Dick’s seeing the Genl. &amp; consulting a few minutes with  
Dr. Craik, he was bled again, the blood ran slowly—appeared very thick,  
and did not produce any symptoms of fainting. —Doctor Brown came into  
the chamber room after, and upon feeling the General&#x27;s pulse &amp;c. the Physi-  
cians went out together.—Dr. Craik soon after returned.—The General  
could now swallow a little (about 4 o’clk)—Calomel &amp; tartar em. were ad-  
ministered ; but without any effect.—About half past 4 o&#x27;clk, he desired me  
to ask Mrs. Washington to come to his bed side—when he requested her to  
go down into his room &amp; take from his desk two wills which she would find  
there, and bring them to him, which she did.—Upon looking at them he

I cannot last long.” They found what had been done was without effect—  
he laid down again and they retired excepting Dr. Craik.—He the then said  
to him, ‘‘ Doctor, I die hard, but Iam not afraid to go, I believed from my  
Jirst attack that I&#x27;wd not survive it, my breath cannot last long.’ —The Doc-  
tor pressed his hand but could not utter a word.—He retired from the bed  
side—and sat by the fire absorbed in grief—About 8 o’clk the Physicians  
again came into the Room, and applied blisters to his legs;—but went out  
without a ray of hope.—From this time he appeared to breath with less diffi-  
culty.than he had done; but was very restless, constantly changing his  
position to endeavor.to get ease.—I aided him all in my power, and was  
gratified in believing he felt it; for he would look upon me with his eyes  
speaking gratitude; but unable to utter a word without great distress.—  
About ten o&#x27;clock he made several attempts to speak to me before he could  
effect it—at length, he said, “‘ 7 am just going, Have me decently buried,  
“and do not let my body be put into the Vault in less than two days after I  
“am dead.&quot;—I bowed assent.—He looked at me again, and said “‘ Do you  
understand me’’—I replied Yes Sir, “‘ 77s we//”’ said he.—About ten min-  
utes before he expired his breathing became much easier—he lay quietly—  
he withdrew his hand from mine &amp; felt his own pulse—I spoke to Dr. Craik  
who sat by the fire—he came to the bed side.—The General’s hand fell from  
his wrist.—I took it in mine and laid it upon my breast—Dr. Craik put his  
hand over his eyes and he expired without a struggle or a Sigh!  
  
While we were fixed in silent grief—Mrs.. Washington asked, with a firm &amp;  
collected Voice, “ Js he gone.”&quot;—I could not speak, but held up my hand as  
a signal that he was.—* Tis well” said she, in a plain voice, ‘“ All is now  
over.—I have no more trials to pass through.—I shall soon followhim !”  
  
  
  
OCCURRENCES NOT NOTED IN THE PRECEDING PAGES.

on, and he was led to a Chair, by the fire.—He lay down again about two  
hours afterwards.—A glister was administered to him, by Dr. Craik’s  
directions, about one o&#x27;clock; but produced no effect.—He was helped up  
again about 5 o’clock—and after sitting about one hour, he desired to be  
undressed and put in bed, which was done.—Between the hours of 6 and  
nine o’clk, he several times asked what hour it was.—During his whole  
illness, he spoke but seldom &amp; with great difficulty and distress, and in so  
low &amp; broken a voice as at times hardly to be understood.—His patience,  
fortitude &amp; resignation never forsook him for a moment.—In all his distress  
he uttered not a sigh nor a complaint, always endeavoring to take what  
was offered him, or to do what was desired.—  
  
At the time of his decease Dr. Craik &amp; myself were in the situation  
before mentioned.—Christopher was standing by the bed side.—Mrs. Wash-  
ington was sitting near the foot of the bed.—Caroline, Charlotte, and some  
other of the servants were Standing in the Room near the door.—Mrs.  
Forbes, the House-keeper, was frequently in the Room in the day &amp;  
evening.  
  
As soon as Dr. Craik could speak, after the distressing scene was  
closed, he desired one of the Servants to ask the Gentlemen below to come  
up stairs—When they came around the bed, I kissed the cold hand, which  
I had ’till then held, laid it down, went to the fire and was for some time  
lost in profound grief, until aroused by Christopher desiring me to take  
care of the General&#x27;s keys and things which he had taken out of his  
pockets, and which Mrs. Washington directed him to give to me.—I  
wraped them up in the General’s Handkerchief, and took them with me  
down stairs ;—About 12 o’clk the Corps was brought down and laid out in  
the large Room.

and did not return home till past 3  
o&#x27;clock. Soon after he went out the  
weather became very bad, rain, hail  
and suow falling alternately, with a  
cold wind. When he came in I carried  
some letters to him to frank, intending  
to send them to the post office in the  
evening. He franked the letters, but  
said the weather was tio bad to send a  
servant up to the otlice that evening. I  
observed to him. that I was afraid he  
had gotten wet, the snow was banging  
on his hair. He came to dinner without

&quot;About 2 or 3 o&#x27;clock on Saturday  
morning he awoke Mrs. Washington  
and told her be was very unwell and  
had an ague. She observed that he  
could scarcely sieak and breathed with  
difficulty, aud would have gotten up to  
call a servant, but ic would not permit  
her lest she should take cold. As soon  
as the day appeared the woman Caro  
line went into the room to make a tire  
and hedesired that Mrs Rawlins, one  
of the overseers who was used to bleed­  
ing the people, might be sent for to  
bleed him before the doctor could arrive.  
The wom.iu Caroline came to my room  
requesting I might go to the General,  
who was very ill. I got up, put on my  
clothes as quickly as jionnible aud went  
to bis chamber. Mrs. Washington was  
then up and related to me bis being  
taken ill aimut 2 or 3 o&#x27;clock, as before  
stated. I fouud him breathing watb  
difficulty and hardly able to utter a  
word intelligibly, I weut out instantly  
and wrote a line to Dr. Craik, which I  
wnt off by my servant, ordering him to  
  
go with all the Bwiftne his horse could  
  
carry him, and Immediately returaed to  
the-Oeneral&#x27;B chamber, where I found  
him iu the same ituatkn I had left  
him. &quot;  
&quot;A mixture of molasses, vinegar and  
Uitter was prepared to try its efiect in  
the throat, but he could not swajlow a  
drop. Whenever ha attempted it he  
appeared to I dint named, convulsed and  
almost MiH&#x27;ocated. Mr. Kawlins came  
in soon after sunrise and prepared to  
bleed him When the arm was ready  
the tieneral, observing that Rawlins  
apeared to be agitated, said, as well as  
he uld speak, &#x27;Don&#x27;t le afraid,&#x27; atid  
after the incision was made lie obsered:  
The ori lice is not large enough &#x27; I low-  
ever, the blood ran pretty freely. Mrs.  
Washington, not knowing whether  
bleediug was proper or not in the Gen  
eral &#x27;s si t uat Ion, begged that much might  
not le taken from bini let It should lie  
injurious and desired me to stop it, but  
when I was about to untie the string  
the General put up his hand to prevent  
it, and as soou as he could. speak he said:  
&#x27;More.&#x27; Mrs. Washington, leiiig still  
uneasy lest too much Mood should be  
taked, it was stopped after about half a  
pint was taken from bim.  
&quot;Finding that no relief wai obtained  
from bleeding, and that nothing would  
go down the throat. I proposed bath­  
ing the throat externally with Salvalat­  
tita, which was done, and iu the opera­  
tion, which was with the hand and in  
the gentlest manner, he observed: &#x27;Tis  
very sore.&#x27; A piece of flannel was then  
put round his neck. His feet were also  
soaked in warm water This however,  
gave no relief.  
&#x27;In the meantime, before Dr. Craik  
arrived, Mrs. Washington requested ni3  
to send for Dr. Brown, of Port Tobacco,  
whom Dr Craik had recommended to  
be called if any car- should ever occur  
that was seriously alarming. I dis­  
patched a messenger, Cyrus to Dr.  
Hrown immediately (about 9 o&#x27;clock).  
Dr. Craik canie iu soon after, and upon  
examining the General be put a blister  
of cantharides on the throat and took  
some more blood from him and had  
some vinegar and hot water put into a  
teapot for the General to draw in the  
steam from the nozzle, which he did as  
well as he was able. He also ordered  
sage tea and vinegar to lie mixed for a  
gargle.  
4 This the General used as often as  
desirable, but when he held back bis  
head to let it run down it put him into  
great distress and almost produced suf­  
focation. When the mixture came out  
of his mouth som phlegm followed it  
and he would attempt to cough, which  
the doctor encouraged him to do as  
much as he could, but without effect  
could only make the attempt, shout  
11 o&#x27;clock Dr. Dick was sent for. Dr.  
Craik tiled the General again about this  
time.  
No effect, however, was produc  
ed bv it and he continued in the same  
state, unable to swallow anything. Dr­  
Dick cams in alswt 3 o&#x27;clock and Dr.  
Rrown arrived soon after. Upon Dr.  
Dick&#x27;s seeing the General and consult­  
ing a few minutes with Dr. Craik he  
was tiled again The blood ran slowly  
and appeared very thick, but did not  
produce any symptoms of fainting. Dr.  
Brown came into the chamber room  
soon after, and upon feeling the Gener­  
al&#x27;s pi use the physicians went out to-  
could nhw swallow a r  
little (about 4 o&#x27;clock). Calomel and  
tartar emetics were administered, but  
without any effect. Alxmt half past 4  
o&#x27;clock hedesired metoask Mrs. Wash­  
ington to come to his bedside, when he  
requested her to go down into his room  
and take from his desk two wills which  
she would find there and bring them to  
him, which she did. Upon looking at  
them ha gave her one, which, he ob­  
served, was useless, as it was supersed­  
ed by the other, and desired her to burn  
it, which fcbe did, and tlien took the  
other and put it away. After this was  
done I returned again to his bedside and  
took his hand. He said to nis: &#x27;I find  
I am going My breath cannot con­  
tinue long. I believed from the first  
attack it would lie fatal. Do you ar­  
range and record all my late military  
letters and papers, arrange ruy accounts  
and settle my books, as you know more  
aliout my accounts than anyone else,  
and let Mr. Kawlins finish recording  
my other letters, which he ha.s begun  
He asked when Mr. Lewis T. Washing­  
ton would return. I told bim I be­  
lieved about the 20th of the mouth. He  
made no reply to it.  
&quot;&quot;The physicians again came iu be­  
tween and 6 o&#x27;clock, and when they  
came to his bedside Dr. Craik asked  
him if be could sit up in bed. He held  
out bis hand to me and was raised up,  
when he said to the physicians: &#x27;I feel  
myself going. You bad better not take  
any more trouble about me, but let me  
go oil&#x27; quietly. I cannot last long.&#x27;  
They found what had been done was  
without efiect. He laid down again  
and they retired, excepting Dr. Craik.  
He then said to him: &#x27;Doctor, I die

&#x27; On Thursday, December 12, the  
General rode out to his farm at about  
10 o&#x27;clock, and did not return till past  
3. Sood after he went out the weather  
? came very bad, rain, hail and enow  
tailing alternately with a cold wind.  
When he came in I carried some let?  
ters fit him to frank, intending to send  
them to tho postotlice. He franked the  
letters, but said the weather was too  
bad to seLd a servant that eveniog. I  
observed to him I wa3 afraid he had  
got wet?he so:d no, his great coat had  
kept him dry. His neck appeared to  
oe wet, suow banging on his hair. He  
came to dinner without changing hi  
dres?. In the eveniug he appeared to  
be as well as usual. A heavy  
:all of snow took place on Friday whiot  
prevented the General from riding ou  
i.- usual. He had taken cold, undoub  
ediy from being so much exposed the  
lay before, and complained of a sort  
ibroat?bad a hoarseuess which iD  
creased in the evening but be male  
liuht of it, as be would never take any?  
thing to carry otf a cold, always observ  
&gt;ng &quot;Lat it go as it came.&quot; In the even  
ig the papers having come from th;  
mstorlice, he sat in the room with Mrr  
Washington and myself reading them  
till ubjut nine o&#x27;clock, and when )i  
met with anything which he thought  
interesting he would read it aloud. He  
desired me to read to him the debates  
of the Virginia Assembly on the election  
of a Senator and Governor, which I  
did. On his retiring to bed be appeared  
to be in perfect health, except the cold  
wbich he considered as trifling?b;;tl  
been remarkably cheerful all the even  
log.  
About two or three o&#x27;clock on Satur?  
day morning he awoke Mrs. Washing?  
ton, and informed her he was very at­  
well and bad an ague. She observed  
be could scarcely speak and breathed  
with difficulty, and she wished to get  
up and call a servant, but the General  
would not permit her lest she would  
take cold. As soon as day appeared,  
[ the woman Caroline went into the room  
to make a fire, and the girl desired that  
Mr. Kawlins, one of the overseers who  
wa- used to bletdtog the people might  
be st n: for to bleed him before the doctor  
cjuld arrive. I was sent. Mr?. Wash?  
ington was up and related to mo his  
being taken ill between 2 and 3 as be?  
fore slated. I found him breathing with  
d-fliculty and hardly able to utter a  
woid intelligibly. I went out instantly  
and wrote a line to Craik, and sent it  
with all speed. Immediately I re?  
turned to the general&#x27;s chamber where  
I found him in the same situation I had  
left him. A mixture of molasses, vie­  
egarand butter was prepared, tut be  
cou!d not swallow a drop : wbenev-rhe  
attempted he was distressed, convulsed  
and almost suflocated.  
Mr. Rawlinscame in soon after sun?  
rise and prepared to bleed bim. When  
the arm was ready, the general observ?  
ing Kawlius appeared agitated said  
,vithdifficulty, &quot;oDu&#x27;t be afraid,&quot; and  
?f ei- the incision was made, he observ?  
ed the oritijn was not large enough.  
However, tee biood ran pretty freely.  
Mrs Washington not knowing that  
olei ding was proper in the generals sit?  
uation, uegged that much might not be  
taken from bim and des red me to stop  
When I was about to untie the  
striop, the ireneral put up bis band to  
prevent it, ond as sot n ss be could speak  
said &#x27;&#x27;more.&quot;  
Mrs. Washington still uneasy lest too  
mucn blood should he taken, it was  
stopped after about half a pint bad been  
taken. Fiuding that no relief was ofc­  
ained from bleeding, and nothing could  
?e swallowed, I proposed bathing the  
throat externally with eal vohtile,  
which was done, and a piece of flannel  
was then put around the neck. His  
leet were bathed in warm water but  
gave no relief. By Mrs. Washington&#x27;s

Brown, at Port Tobacco About 9

Craik bled the General again, No effect  
Aas produced and he continued in the  
same slate unable to swallow anything.  
Dr. Dick came in at 3 o&#x27;clock and Dr.  
Brown arrived soon after; when after  
consultation the General wag bled  
again, the blood ran slowly, appeared  
very thick and did not produce any  
symptoms of fainting. At 4 o&#x27;clock the  
General could swallow a little. Cilomel  
and tartar emetic were administered  
without effec .  
About half past 4 o&#x27;clock be desired

there and bring thera to him, which  
she did. Upon looking at one which  
he observed was usele-s, he desired her  
to bum it, which nhedid, and then took  
the other und put it away. After this  
was done I relumed again to bis bed?

M manner, he observed  
  
A  
 hec of flannel was the  
t. His feet were also  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
soaked in warm water. This, however, gave  
no relief  
In the meantime, before Dr. Craik arrived  
Mrs. Washington requested me to send for  
Dr. Brown of Port Tobacco, whom Dr. Craik  
had recommended to be called if any case  
should occur that was seriously alarming  
I dispatched a messenger, Cyrus, to Dr  
Brown immediately (about a o&#x27;clock). Dr  
Craik came in soon after, and upon examin­  
ing the genoral he put a blister of cantha­  
rides on the throat and took some more blood  
from him and had some vinegar and hot  
water put into a teapot for the general to  
draw in the steam from the nozzle, which he  
did as well as he was able. He also ordered  
sage tea and vinegar be mixed for a gargle  
This the general used as often as desired  
but when he held back his head to let it run­  
down it put him into great distress and al­  
most produced suffocation. When the mixt­  
ure came out of his mouth some phlegm  
followed it and he would attempt to cough  
which the doctor encouarged him to do as  
much as he could, but without effect--he  
could only make the attempt. About 11  
o&#x27;clock Dr. Dick was sent for. Dr. Craik  
bled the general again about this time. No  
effect, however, was produced by it and he  
continued in the same State, unable to swal­  
low anything. Dr. Dick came in about 3  
o&#x27;clock and Dr. Brown arrived soon after  
Upon Dr. Dick&#x27;s seeing the general and con­  
sulting a few minutes with Dr. Craik he  
was bled again. The blood ran slowly and  
appeared very thick, but did not produce  
any symptoms of fainting. Dr. Brown came  
into the chamber room soon after and upon  
feeling the general&#x27;s pulse the physicians  
went out together. Dr. Craik soon after re­  
turned  
  
The general could now swallow a little  
about 4 o&#x27;clock). Calomel and tarter emetics  
were administered, but without any effect  
About half past 4 o&#x27;clock he desired me to  
ask Mrs. Washington to come to his bedside  
when he requested her to go down into his  
room and take from his desk two wills which  
she would find there and bring them to him  
which she did. Upon looking at them he gave  
her one, which, he observed, was useless, as  
it was superseded by the other, and desired  
her to burn it, which she did, and then took  
the other and put it away. After this was  
done I returned again to his bedside and took  
his hand. He said to me: &#x27;I find I am going  
My breath can not continue long. I believed  
from the first attack it would be fatal. Do  
you arrange and record all my late military  
letters and papers, arrange my accounts and  
settle my books, as you know more about my  
accounts than anyone else, and let Mr. Raw  
lins finish recording my other letters, which  
he has begun.&quot; He asked when Mr. Lewls  
T. Washington would return. I told him I  
believed about the 20th of the month. He  
made no reply to it  
The physicians again, came in between  
5 and 6 o&#x27;clock, and when they came to his  
bedside Dr. Craik asked him if he could sit  
up in bed. He held out his hand to me and  
was raised up, when he said to the physi­  
cians: &quot;I feel myself going. You had better  
not take any more trouble about me, but let  
me go off quietly. I can not last long.&quot; They  
  
  
found what had been done was without ef­  
fect. He laid down again, and they retired  
excepting Dr. Craik. He then said to him  
Doctor, I die hard, but I am not afraid to­  
go. I believed from the first attack that I  
would not survive it. My breath can not last  
long.&quot; The doctor pressed his hand, but  
could not utter a word. He retired from the  
bedside and sat by the fire absorbed in grief  
  
.  
About 8 o&#x27;clock the physicians again came  
  
into the room and applied blisters to his  
tegs, but without a ray of hope. From this  
time he appeared to breathe with less diffi  
  
culty than he had done, but was very rest­  
less, constantly changing his position to en  
  
deavor to get ease. I aided him all in my  
power, and was gratified in believing he felt  
it, for he would look upon me with grati­  
tude, but unable to utter a word without  
great distress. About 10 o&#x27;clock he made  
several attempts to speak to me before he  
could effect it. At length he said: &quot;I am  
just going. Have me decently buried and  
do not let my body be put into the vault  
in less than two days after I am dead.&quot; I  
bowed assent. He looked at me again and  
said: &quot;Do you understand me?&quot; I replied  
  
Yes, sir.&quot; &quot;Tis well,&#x27; said he  
About ten minutes before he expired his  
breathing became much easter and he lay  
quletly. He withdrew his hand from mine  
and felt his own pulse. I spoke to Dr. Craik  
who sat by the fire. He came to the bedside  
  
The general&#x27;s hand fell from his wrist. I  
  
took it in mine and he expired without a  
struggle or a sigh. While we were fixed in  
silent grief Mrs. Washington asked with a  
firm and collected voice: &#x27;Is he gone?&quot; I  
  
could not speak, but held up my hand as a  
signal that he was. &quot;Tis well,&#x27; said she in  
a plain voice, &quot;all is now over. I have no  
more trials to pass through. I shall soon fol­  
low him  
  
In a succeeding manuscript Colonel Lear  
notes the following additional details  
The general&#x27;s servant, Christopher, at­  
tended his bedside and was in the room when  
he was sitting up through his whole illness  
About 8 o&#x27;clock in the morning the general  
expressed a wish to get up. His clothes were  
put on and he was led to a chair by the fire  
He lay down again about two hours after  
wards. A blister was administered to him  
by Dr. Cratk&#x27;s directions about I o&#x27;clock  
but produced no effect. He was helped up  
again about b o&#x27;clock, and after sitting about  
one hour he desired to be undressed and put  
in bed, which was done. Between the hours  
of 6 and 9 o&#x27;clock he several times asked  
what hour it was. During his whole illness  
he spoke but seldom and with great diff­  
culty and distress, and in so low and broken  
a voice at times hardly to be understood  
His patience, fortitude, resignation never  
forsook him for a moment. In all his dis­  
tress he uttered not a sigh nor a complaint  
always endeavoring to take what was offered  
him or to do what was desired. At the time  
of his decease Dr. Craik and I myself were  
in the situation before mentioned. Christo­  
pher was standing by near the bedside. Mrs  
Washington was sitting near the foot of the  
bed. Caroline, Charlotte and some of the  
  
other servants were standing in the room  
near the door. Mrs. Forbes, the housekeeper  
was frequently in the room in the day and  
evening  
As soon as Dr. Craik could speak, after  
the distressful scene was closed, he desired  
one of the servants to ask the gentlemen  
below to come upstairs. When they came  
around the bed I kissed the cold hand, which  
I had till then held, laid it down, went to the  
are and was for some time lost in profound  
grief, until aroused by Christophor, desiring  
me to take charge of the general&#x27;s keys and  
things which he had taken out of his poch  
ets, and which Mrs. Washington directed  
  
him to give to me. I wrapped them up in the  
  
general&#x27;s handkerchlef and took them with  
down stairs. About 12 o&#x27;clock the corpse  
was brought down and laid out in the larg
