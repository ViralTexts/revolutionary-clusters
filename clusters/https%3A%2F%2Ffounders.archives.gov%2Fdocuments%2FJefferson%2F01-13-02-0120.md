e query I had put to you about the right of direct taxation. [My first wish was that 9 states would adopt it in order to ensure what was good in it, and that the others might, by holding off, produce the necessary amendments. But the plan of Massachusets is far preferable, and will I hope be followed by those who are yet to decide. There are two amendments only which I am anxious for. 1. A bill of rights, which it is so much the interest of all to have, that I conceive it must be yielded. The 1st. amendment proposed by Massachusets will in some degree answer this end, but not so well. It will do too much in some instances and too little in others. It will cripple the federal government in some cases where it ought to be free, and not restrain it in some others where restraint would be right. The 2d. amendment which appears to me essential is the restoring the principle of necessary rotation, particularly to the Senate and Presidency: but most of all to the last.

Paris, May 27th. To Colonel Edward Carrington.—My  
first wish was that nine states would adopt it, in order to ensure  
what was good in it, and that the others might, by holding off,  
produce the necessary amendments. But the plan of Massachu-  
setts is far preferable, and will, I hope, be followed by those who  
are yet todecide. ‘There are two amendments only, which I am  
anxious for. First, a bill of rights, which it is so much the inter-  
est of all to have, that I conceive it must be yielded. The first  
amendment proposed by Massachusetts will in some degree an-  
swer this end, but not so well, it will do much in some instances  
and too little in others ; it will cripple the federal government in  
some cases where it ought to be free, and not restrain it in some  
others where restraint would be right. ‘The second amendment,  
which appears to me essential, is the restoring the principle of  
necessary rotation, particularly to the senate and presidency ;  
but most of all to the last. Reeligibility makes him an officer for  
life, and the disasters inseparable from an elective monarchy ren-  
der it preferable, if we cannot tread back that step, that we should  
go forward and take refuge in an hereditary one. Of the cor-  
rection of this article, however, I entertain no present hope, be-  
cause I find it has scarcely excited an objection in America, and  
if it does not take place ere long, it assuredly never will.  
  
The natural progress of things is for liberty to yield, and gov-  
ernment to gain ground. As yet our spirits are free, our jealousy  
is only put to sleep by the unlimited confidence we all repose in  
the person, to whom we all look as our President. After him,  
inferior characters may perhaps succeed, and awaken us to the  
danger, which his merit has led us into. For the present, how-  
ever, the general adoption is to be prayed for, and I wait with great  
anxiety for the news from Maryland and South Carolina, which  
have decided before this, and wish that Virginia, now in session,
