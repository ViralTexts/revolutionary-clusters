Department of State 25 Jany. 1806  
  
The Secretary of State, to whom the President has been pleased to refer the resolution of the Senate, dated on the 10th inst. has the honor to make the following report.  
The most important of the principles interpolated into the law of Nations, is that which appears to be maintained by the British Government, &amp; its prize Courts, that a trade opened to neutrals by a Nation at war, on account of the war, is unlawful. This principle has been relaxed, from time to time, by orders, allowing, as favors to neutrals, particular branches of trade, disallowed by the general principle; which orders, have also, in some instances, extended the modifications of the principle beyond its avowed import.  
In like manner, the last of these orders, bearing date the 24th. of June 1803, has incorporated with the relaxation a collateral principle which is itself an interpolation, namely that a Vessel on a return voyage, is liable to capture by the circumstance of her having on the outward voyage, conveyed contraband articles to an enemy’s port. How far a like penalty attached by the same order to the circumstance of a previous communication with a blockaded port, would likewise be an interpolation, may depend upon the construction under which that part of the order has been or is to be carried into execution.  
The general principle, first above stated, as lately applied to reexportations of articles imported into neutral Countries from hostile Colonies, or vice versa, by considering the reexportation in many cases, as a continuation of the original voyage, forms another interpolation, deeply affecting the trade of neutrals. For a fuller view of this and some other interpolations, reference may be had to the documents, communicated with the Message to Congress of the 17th. instant.  
The British principle, which makes a notification to foreign governments of an intended blockade, equivalent to the notice required by the law of Nations, before the penalty can be incurred, and that which subjects to capture Vessels arriving at a port, in the interval between a removal and return of the blockading force; are other important deviations from the code of public law.  
Another unjustifiable measure is, the mode of search practised by British Ships, which instead of remaining at a proper distance from the vessel to be searched, and sending their own boat with a few men for the purpose, compel the Vessel to send her papers in her own boat, and sometimes with great danger from the condition of the boat &amp; the state of the weather.  
  
To these instances, without adverting to others of an inferior or less definite character, in the practice of Great Britain, must be added the assumed right to impress persons from American Vessels, sailing under the American flag on the high seas. An explanation of this practice will be found in the extract from the instructions to Mr. Monroe, communicated with the Message of the President above referred to.  
Among the interpolations introduced by the French Government is a decree dated 6th. June 1805 (18 prairial, 13 Year) importing that every privateer of which two thirds of the crew should not be natives of England, or subjects of a power the enemy of France, shall be considered as pirates. Another is evidenced by the result of an application made by the Deputy Consul of the United States at Cadiz, through the French Consul, to Admiral Villeneuve, for the liberation of some seamen of the United States who were on board the French Fleet under his Command: The answer of the Admiral, dated the 29th. August last (11 Fructidor 13 Year) states that “a decision of his Imperial and Royal Majesty provides that every foreigner found on board the Vessels of war or of Commerce of the enemy is to be treated as a prisoner of war, and can have no right to the protection of the Diplomatic and Commercial Agents of his Nation.”  
Other unjustifiable innovations on the law of Nations are exemplified in the Decree of General Ferrand lately passed at the City of St. Domingo, a translation of which is annexed.  
The irregular mode of search above described is also practised by the Cruisers of France and Spain.  
The Cruizers of the two latter powers have harrassed the Commerce of the United States in various other forms, but as it is not known or believed that their Conduct has been prescribed or sanctioned by the public authority of their respective Nations, they are not considered as falling within the purview of the resolution of the Senate. All which is respectfully submitted.  
  
James Madison

)  
  
  
lawful, _ _ -  
The principle has been relaxed from  
time to time, by erders allowing as favors&#x27;  
to neutrals, particular branches of trade,  
disallowed by the general principle ; which,  
orders have also, in some instances, extend. !  
ed the madifications of the principle be.  
and its avowed import. ,  
—ln like manner, the last of these orders,  
bearing date the 24th of ]une, 1808, has  
incoporated with the relaxation a Collate­  
ral principle, which is itself an interpolati- -  
on, namely, that a vesselon a return voyage  
is liable to --capture by the circumstances of  
her having on-the out-ward voyage, convey- 3  
ed contrabsnd articles to an enemy&#x27;s port.  
si-How far a like penalty attached by the  
same order to the circumstance offsiass&#x27;pre-s  
xvious communication with a blockaded  
port, would likewise be an interpolation, s  
maydepend upon the constitution under:  
which that part ofthe ord-er has been, or;  
is to be carried into execution. &#x27;  
The general principle first above stated. ,  
as lately applied to re.exportations of sssiarti- :  
cles imported into neutral countries from si  
si—hostile colonies, or vice versa,siby consider­  
ing the re-exportation in many-cases, as a  
continuation of the original voyage, forms -  
another interpolation, deeply aﬀecting the  
trade of neutra&#x27;ls. For a fulle; view at&quot; this si  
and some other interpolations, references,  
may be had to the documents communicat- .  
ed with the message to-congressof the l7th  
siinst­  
The British principle, which &quot;makes a­  
-notification to-foreign governments of an  
intended blockade, equivalent tonntice re­  
-&gt;qurred by the law of nations, before the pen­  
alty can be incurred ; and that which sub­  
jects to-capture vessels arriving at a port.

turn &#x27;Of the bl-siickading iorce, si-ssare other  
ss important deviations from the ende of pub­  
silic law.  
sss Another unjustifiable measure ssssis the  
F mode of search practised bv lintsstsh ship-=.  
which inscead of remaining at &amp; Plissfþtl  
distance from the vessel to be searched  
and sending their own boat with a few me.-n  
si for the purpose, compel the vessel to send  
her papersin her own boat. and sometime a  
with great danger from the-condition ofthe  
_ boat, and the state of the weather.  
i To these instances, Without adverting  
; to others of an inferior or less desisinictte cha­  
sracter, in the practice of Great Britain,  
  
! must be added the assumed right to im  
  
I press persons-from American vessels, sail­  
cting under the American&#x27;fiag on the high  
si seas. An explanation of this practice will  
7 be &#x27;found in the extract from the instruc­

REPORT—  
Tits mod important of the principles inter­

appears to be maintained bv the Hritifh govern­  
ment and its prize courts, that a trade open to  
neutrals by a nation at war, on account of the

The principle lias been relaxed, from time to  
time, by orders, allowing, as favours to neutrals,  
particular branches of trade, difallowed by the  
general principle ; which orders have alfo, in  
fpme inftances, extended the modifications of  
the principle beyond its avowed import.  
In like manner, the lad of thcfe orders, bear­  
ing date the 21th of June, 1803, has incorpo­  
rated with the relaxation, a collateral principle,  
which is itfelf an interpolation, namely, that a  
veflel on a return voyage is liable to capture by  
the circumdances of her having on the outward  
voyage, conveyed contraband articles to an e­  
neiny’s port. How far a like penalty attached  
by the fame order to the circumftance of a pre­  
vious communication with a blockaded port,  
wouid bkewife be an intc rpolation, may de­  
pend Upon the Coaflruvlian, under which that  
part of the order has been, or is to be carried  
into execution.  
  
The general principle firft above ftatcd, as  
latcij applied to re-exportations of articles im­  
ported into neutral countries from hoftile colo­  
I&#x27;.ie j, or vice verfa, hy confidering the re-expor­  
tation in many cafes, as a continuation of the  
original voyage, forms another interpolation,  
deeply afteding the trade of neutrals. Fora  
f &gt;ller view of this and fome other interpolati­  
ons, reference may be had to the documents  
communicated with the meflage to Congrefs of  
the I 7th inft.  
1 he Britifh principle, which nrakes a notifi­  
cation to foreign governments of an intended  
block ule, equivalent to the notice required by  
the law of nations, before the penalty can be  
incurred* and that which fubjeds to capture  
ve.Telsarriving at a port, in the interval between  
a removal anil return of the blockading force,  
aie other important deviations from the code  
oF public law.  
Another unja ‘lifiable meafure is the mode of  
fe.trch prad I fed by Britifh fhips, which inftead  
«&gt;f remaining at a proper diftance from thevef­  
fej to be ic iiclir: 1. and fending their own boat  
with a few men for the purpofe, compel the  
veil&#x27;d to fend her p apers in her own boat, and  
fotnetimea with gre.&#x27;t danger from the conditi­  
on of the boat, and the ftatcof the weather.  
To thefe fuftances, without adverting to ci­  
thers of an inferior or le fs definite charader, in  
the practice of Grc it-B« tain, mutt be added the  
aflurned right to imprt l&#x27;b perfons from Ameri­  
can vcfl&#x27;de, failing under the American flagon  
the high leas. An i xplaration of this pradice  
will be found in the ext rad from the inftrudi­  
ons to Mr. Monroe, communicated with the  
meflhge of the Prefident above referred to.  
Among the interpolations introduced by the  
French government, is a decree, dated 6 June,  
1805 £l8 Prairul, 13 year] importing that eve­  
ry privateer of which two-thirds of the crew  
fhould not be natives of England, or/iibjeds of  
a power the enemy of France, flialt be confider­  
cd as pirates.  
Another is evidenced by the refult of an ap­  
plication made by the deputy conful of the U.  
S. at Cadiz, through the French conful to ad­  
miral Villeneuve, tor the liberation of fomtTea­  
men of the U. S. who were on board the French  
fleet under his command. The anfwer of the  
admiral, dated 29 Aug. laft, [i i Frudidor, J3  
year] dates, that “ adecifiou of his imperial  
and royal majclty provides, tiiat every foreign­  
er round on board the vefl&#x27;ds of war or of com­  
merce of the enemy, is to be treated as a pri­  
foner of war, and ran have no light to the pro­  
tedion of the diplomats and commercial agents  
of his nat ion.”  
Other unjnfl.ifi.ible innovations on the law of  
nations, are exemplified in the decree of gene­  
ral Fetratul, lately palled at the city of Saint  
Domingo, a traDilation of which is annexed.  
The irregular mode of fcarch above deferibed  
is alfb pradilld by the cruizvie of France and  
Spain.  
The cru&#x27;r/.ers of the t’v.. latter powers have  
harrafled the commerce of the If. S. in various  
other forms, but as it is not known, or believed  
that their corrriud has been preferibed or fanc­  
t&#x27;oned by tlie public authority of their refpec­  
tive nations, they arc r.ot conlidered a* falling  
within the purview of the refolution of tiie Se­

Jan, 27, 1806.  
  
REPORT.  
The Secretary of Stale, to whom the President has  
been //leased to refer the resolution of the Senate,  
dated on the 10ih inst. has the honour to make the  
following Report—  
The most important of the principles interpolated  
into the law of nations, is that which appears to be  
maintained by the British government and its prize  
courts, that a trade open to neutrals by a nation at  
war, on account of the war, is unlawful.  
The principle has been relaxed, from time to time,  
by orders, allowing, as favours to neutrals, particu- I  
lav branches of trade, disallowed by the general prin­  
ciple ; which orders have also, in some instances,  
extended the modifications of the principle beyond  
its avowed import.  
In like manner, the last of these orders, bearing  
date the 24th of June, 1803, has incorporated witii  
the relaxation, a collateral principle, which is itself  
an interpolation, namely, that a vessel on a return  
voyage is liable to capture by the circumstances of  
her having on the outward voyage, conveyed contra­  
band articles to an enemy’s colony. How far a like  
penalty attached by the same order to the circum­  
stance of a prev ious communication with a blockad­  
ed port, would likewise be an interpolation, may  
depend upon the construction, under which that part  
of the order has been, or is to be carried into execu­  
tion.  
The general principle first above stated, as lately  
applied to re-exportation of articles imported into  
neutral countries from hostile colonies, or vice ver- !  
sa, by considering the re-exportation in many cases, |  
as a continuation of the original voyage, forms ano- &#x27;  
ther interpolation, deeply affecting the trade of neu­  
trals. For a fuller view of tins and some other in­  
terpolations, reference may be had to the documents  
communicated with the message to Congress ot the  
J7tli lost.  
The British principle, which makes a notification  
to &#x27;foreign governments of an intended blockade, e­  
qu.ivalent to the notice required by the law of nations,  
before the penalty can be incurred ; and that which  
subjects to capture vessels arriving at a port, in the  
interval between a removal and a return of the block­  
ading force, are other important deviations from the  
code of public law.  
Another unjustifiable measure is the mode of search  
practised by British ships, which instead of remain­  
ing at a proper distance from the vessel to be search­  
ed, and sending their own boat with a few men for  
the purpose, compel the vessel to send her papers in  
her own boat, and sometimes with great danger front  
the condition of the boat, and tile state of the wea­  
ther.  
To these instances, without adverting to others of  
an inferiour or less definite character, in the prac­  
tice of Greut-Britain, must be added the assumed  
right to impress persons from American vessels, sail­  
ing under the American flag on the high seas. An  
explanation of this practice will be found in the ex­  
tract from-the instructions to Mr. Monroe, commu­  
nicated with the message of the President above re­  
ferred to.  
‘ Among the interpolations introduced by the French  
government, is a decree, dated 6th June, 1805, [18th  
Prairial, 13 year] importing that every pflvatecr of  
■which two-thirds of the crew should be natives of  
England, or subjects ef a power the enemy of France  
shall be considered as pirates.  
Another is evidenced by the result of an applicati*  
on made by the deputy consul of the United States at  
Cadiz, through the French consul to admiral Yille­  
neuve, for the liberation of some seamen of the Unit­  
ed State* who was on board the French fleet under  
his command. The answer of the admiral, dated  
29 Aug. lat, [11 Fructidor, 13 year] states, that  
“ A decision of his imperial and roval majesty pro­  
vides, that every foreigner found on board the ves­  
sel of war or of commerce of the enemy, is to be  
treated as prisoner of war, and can have no right to  
the protection of the diplomatick and commercial  
agents of his nation.”  
  
Wtlici wu wi\. •» »#» nun­  
ons, are exemplified in the decree of general Ferranti  
lately passed at the city of St. Domingo, a translati­  
on of which is annexed.  
The irregular mode of search above described is  
also practised by the cruisers of France and Spain.  
The cruizers of the two latter powers have harass­  
ed the commerce of the United States in various  
other forms, but as it is not known, or believed that  
their conduct has been prescribed or sanctioned by  
the publick authority of their respective nations, they  
are not considered as falling within the purview of  
the resolution of the Senate.

The Prefident, by Meliage,  
has communicated the following  
report of the Secretary of State, |  
in compliance with the refolu­  
tion of the Senate, of the 10th  
January.  
REPORT.  
The molt important of the  
principles, interpolated in the  
law of nations,*is that which ap  
pears to be maintained by the  
Britilh government and its prize  
courts, that a trade opened to  
neutrals by a nation at war, on  
account of the war, is unlawful.  
The principle has been relax­  
ed from time to time, by orders,  
% i  
  
allotting, as Lvors to neutrals,  
particular branches of trade, dif­  
-&gt; I lowed by the general princi­  
ples j which orders have alfo.  
in feme indances, extended the  
modifications of the principles  
beyond its avowed import.  
In like manner, the lad cf  
ikefe orders, bearing date the  
24th of June, 1803, has incor­  
porated with the relaxation, a  
colat^ral principle, which is it­  
&lt;elt an interpolation, namely,  
that a vefi&#x27;el on a return voyage  
is liable to capture, by the cir­  
cumftances of her having on  
the outward voyage, conveyed  
contraband articles to an eneuu s  
• j  
port. How far a like penairy  
attached by the fame order to  
the circumitance of a previous  
communication with a blocka­  
ded port, would likewife be an  
interpolation, may depend upon  
the conftru&amp;ion, under which  
that part of the order has been,  
or is to be carried into execution.  
The general principles, firft  
above flated, as lately applied to  
re-exportations cf articles im­  
ported into neutral countries  
&#x27;from hoflitc colonies, or vice  
verfa, by centering the re-ex  
portation in many cafes, as a  
continuation of the original vov­  
&#x27;age, forms another interpola­  
tion, deeply a Reeling the trade  
  
of neutrals, ror a further view  
5 of this and fome other interpo­  
lations, reference may be had  
to the documents communica­  
ted with the melfage to congrefs  
of the 17th inft.  
] The Britifh principle, which  
makes a notification to foreign  
governments of an intended  
blockade, epuivalent to the no­  
tice requited by the law of na­  
tions, before the penalty can be  
incurred ; and that which fub­  
jects to capture, ▼efTels arriving  
at a port, in the interval between  
a removal and return of the  
blockading force, are other im­  
portant deviations from the code  
of public law.  
Another unjufiifiabie meafure  
is the mode of fearch pradifed  
by Britifh (hips, which inflead  
of remaining at a proper dhtance  
from the veflel to be frarched,  
and fending their own boat with  
; a few men for the purpofe, com­  
pel the vefTel io4*ad hef papers  
in her own boat, and fometimes  
with great danger from thecon­  
jdition of tlie boat and the Hate  
:of the weather.  
To thefe inflances, without  
adverting to others of an inferi­  
or or lefs definite character, in  
the pra&amp;ice of Great Britain,  
mu A be added the aiiumed right  
to imprefs per Ions from Amer­  
ican veflels, failing under the  
4 American flag on the high feas.  
; An explanation of this practice  
will be found in the extract from  
the inftrudions to Mr. Munroe,  
communicated with the meddle  
of the preiident, above reterred  
to.  
  
Among the interpolations, in­  
troduced by the French govern­  
ment, is a decree, dated 6th  
June, 1805. (&quot;18 Prairial, 13  
year] importing that every pri­  
vateer of whieh two thiids of  
the crew (hould not be natives  
of England, or fubjeSs of a  
power the enemy of France,  
| fhal be confidered as pirates.  
Another is evidenced bv the  
( 4  
refult of an application made by  
the deputy consul of the United  
States at Cadiz, through the  
French conful, to admiral Vij.1  
leneuve, for the liberation of  
tome Teamen of the United States  
■ , * * *

fleet under his command. &quot;The  
anfwer of the admiral, dated

year] Itafes, that “A decifion of  
hi$ imperial and royal niajefty

cmy, is to be treated as » prii*  
oner of war, and can have io \
protection cf the diplomatics j  
and commercial agents of his j

or. the law of nations, and ex­  
emplified in the decree cf gen.  
Ferrand, lately paifed it the city  
of Sr. Domingo, a tranllation  
cf v hich is annexed.  
The irregular mode of fcarch  
above deferfbed is alfo practifed

with the resolution of the Senate, of  
the loth January. &#x27;  
&quot; REPORT. &#x27;  
THE most importaot of ihe principles  
idterpolaied in the law of naticns, is that  
which appeass so be maintained by the Bii­  
tifh government and its prize courts, that a  
trade opened to neutrals by a nation at war,  
on account of the war, is unlawfal.  
Theprinciple has been relaxed, from time  
to time, by orders, allowing, as favors ta neu.  
trals, paruicolar branches of trade, disallow­  
ed by the ge®al principle ; which orders,  
have also, in some instances, extended the  
modifications of the principle beyond its a­  
vowed import, .  
~ Io like manner, the lalt of thele orders,  
bearing date the ¢4th of June, 1803, hasin.  
corporated with Ithe relaxation, a collateral  
principle, which is itfelf an interpolation,  
namely, that a veflel on a return voyage is  
liable to capture by the circumflances of her  
kaving ob the outward voyag:, conveyed  
contraband articles to an ecnemy’s port,a—  
How far a like penalty attached by the fame  
order to the ¢ircumftances of a previous com­  
munication fwith a blockaded port, would  
likewise be an interpolation, may depend  
upon the conflrulion, ¢nder whic%_lbat part  
of the order has been, or is to be&#x27;€arrred in­  
to execution,  
The geoeral principle, firfl above slated,  
8s lately applicd 1o re-exportations ofarticles  
imported into neutral countries from hostile  
colonies, or vice-verla, by considering the  
re-exportation in maoy cases, as a continua­  
tion of the origioal vovage, forms anotherin.  
terpolation, deeply affclling the trade of nea­  
trals. For a faller view ot this and some  
other interpolations, reference may be had  
to the documents communicated with the  
mcflage to congress of the 17thinflany,  
The Britufh principle, which makes a no­  
tification to foreign governments of ao in­  
tended blockade, equivalent tq the notice re­  
quired by the law of nations, before the  
penalty cdn be incurred; and that which  
{aubjctls to caprure, veflels arriving at a port,  
in the interval betweon a removal and return  
of the blockading farce, are other important  
deviation® from the ¢ode of public law.  
Another unjuflifi:ble measure is the mode  
of search pratiled by Britith ships, which  
Inflead of remaining at a proper distance  
from the vellel to be searched, and fending  
their own&#x27;boat with a few men for the pur­  
pose, to compel the veflel to fend her pay  
pers in her own boat, and {ometimes with  
-great d®ger from the condition of the boat,  
and the state of the weather, ‘  
~ To these instances, without adverting to  
others of an inferior or less definite charatler,  
-i0 the pralice of Great Britain, must be ad­  
ded the assumed right to impress persons:  
from American veflels, lailing under ihe A­  
_merican flag on the high seas. An explan­  
ation of this praltice will be found in the  
_eXtral from the infiroftioss of Mr. Mon­

REPORT :  
  
* The most important of the principles interpolated into the  
jaw of nations, is that which appears to be maintained by the  
British government and its prize courts, ihat a trade open to  
Neutrals by a nation at war, on account of the war, is unlaw-  
ful.  
  
“ The principle haz been relaxed, from time to time, by  
orders, aliowing, as favours to neutrals, particular branches  
of trade, disajlowed by the general principle ; which orders  
have also, in some instances, extended the modifications of  
the principle beyond its avowed import.

“Tn like manner, the last of these orders, bearing date the  
24th of June, 1803, has incorporated with the relaxations, a  
coijlateral principle, which is itself an interpolation, namely,  
that a vessel on a return voyage is liable to capture by the  
circumstances of her having, on the outward voyage, con-  
veyed contraband articles to any enemy’s port. How far a  
like penalty attached by the same order to the circumstance  
of a previous communication with a blockaded port, would  
likewise be an interpolation, may depend upon the construc-  
tion, under which that part of the order has been, or is to be  
carried into execution.  
  
“ The general principle first above stated, as lately applied  
to re-exportation of articles, imported into neutral coun-  
tries from hostile colonies, or vice-versa, by considering the  
re-exportation in many cases, as a continuation of the origi-  
nal voyage, forms another interpolation; deeply affecting the  
trade of neutrals. Tora fuller view of this, and some other  
interpolations, reference may be had to the documents com-  
municated with the message to congress ofthe 17th instant.  
  
“ The British principle, which makes a notification to fo-  
  
rcign governments ofan intended blockade, equivalent to  
the notice required by the Jaw of nations, before the penalty  
can be incurred; and that which subjects to capture vessels  
arriving at a port, in the interval between a removal and re-  
turn of a blockading force, are other important deviations  
from the code of public law.  
  
“ Another unjustifiable measure is the mode of search prac-  
  
tised by British ships, which instead of remaining at a pro-  
  
per distance from the vessel to be searched, and sending their  
  
own boat, with a few men for the purpose, compel the ves-  
sel to send her papers in her own boat, and sometimes with  
rreat danger from the condition of the boat, and the siate of  
the weather.
