[31 August 1793]  
The doctrine which has been examined, is pregnant with inferences and consequences against which no ramparts in the constitution could defend the public liberty, or scarcely the forms of Republican government. Were it once established that the powers of war and treaty are in their nature executive; that so far as they are not by strict construction transferred to the legislature, they actually belong to the executive; that of course all powers not less executive in their nature than those powers, if not granted to the legislature may be claimed by the executive: if granted, are to be taken strictly, with a residuary right in the executive; or, as will hereafter appear, perhaps claimed as a concurrent right by the executive; and no citizen could any longer guess at the character of the government under which he lives; the most penetrating jurist would be unable to scan the extent of constructive prerogative.  
Leaving however to the leisure of the reader deductions which the author having omitted might not chuse to own, I proceed to the examination of one, with which that liberty cannot be taken.  
“However true it may be (says he) that the right of the legislature to declare war includes the right of judging whether the legislature be under obligations to make war or not, it will not follow that the executive is in any case excluded from a similar right of judging in the execution of its own functions.”  
A material error of the writer in this application of his doctrine lies in his shrinking from its regular consequences. Had he stuck to his principle in its full extent, and reasoned from it without restraint, he would only have had to defend himself against his opponents. By yielding the great point, that the right to declare war, tho’ to be taken strictly, includes the right to judge whether the nation be under obligation to make war or not, he is compelled to defend his argument not only against others but against himself also. Observe how he struggles in his own toils.  
He had before admitted that the right to declare war is vested in the legislature. He here admits that the right to declare war includes the right to judge whether the United States be obliged to declare war or not. Can the inference be avoided, that the executive instead of having a similar right to judge, is as much excluded from the right to judge as from the right to declare?  
If the right to declare war be an exception out of the general grant to the executive power; every thing included in the right must be included in the exception; and being included in the exception, is excluded from the grant.  
He cannot disentangle himself by considering the right of the executive to judge as concurrent with that of the legislature. For if the executive have a concurrent right to judge, and the right to judge be included in (it is in fact the very essence of) the right to declare, he must go on and say that the executive has a concurrent right also to declare. And then what will he do with his other admission, that the power to declare is an exception out of the executive power.  
Perhaps an attempt may be made to creep out of the difficulty through the words “in the execution of its functions.” Here again he must equally fail.  
Whatever difficulties may arise in defining the executive authority in particular cases, there can be none in deciding on an authority clearly placed by the constitution in another department. In this case the constitution has decided what shall not be deemed an executive authority; tho’ it may not have clearly decided in every case what shall be so deemed. The declaring of war is expressly made a legislative function. The judging of the obligations to make war, is admitted to be included as a legislative function. Whenever then a question occurs whether war shall be declared, or whether public stipulations require it, the question necessarily belongs to the department to which these functions belong—And no other department can be in the execution of its proper functions, if it should undertake to decide such a question.  
There can be no refuge against this conclusion, but in the pretext of a concurrent right in both departments to judge of the obligations to declare war, and this must be intended by the writer when he says, “it will not follow that the executive is excluded in any case from a similar right of judging &amp;c.”  
As this is the ground on which the ultimate defence is to be made, and which must either be maintained, or the works erected on it, demolished; it will be proper to give its strength a fair trial.  
It has been seen that the idea of a concurrent right is at variance with other ideas advanced or admitted by the writer. Laying aside for the present that consideration, it seems impossible to avoid concluding that if the executive has a concurrent right with the legislature to judge of obligations to declare war, and the right to judge be essentially included in the right to declare, it must have the same right to declare as it has to judge; &amp; by another analogy, the same right to judge of other causes of war, as of the particular cause found in a public stipulation. So that whenever the executive in the course of its functions shall meet with these cases, it must either infer an equal authority in all, or acknowledge its want of authority in any.  
If any doubt can remain, or rather if any doubt could ever have arisen, which side of the alternative ought to be embraced, it can be with those only who overlook or reject some of the most obvious and essential truths in political science.  
The power to judge of the causes of war as involved in the power to declare war, is expressly vested where all other legislative powers are vested, that is, in the Congress of the United States. It is consequently determined by the constitution to be a Legislative power. Now omitting the enquiry here in what respects a compound power may be partly legislative, and partly executive, and accordingly vested partly in the one, and partly in the other department, or jointly in both; a remark used on another occasion is equally conclusive on this, that the same power, cannot belong in the whole, to both departments, or be properly so vested as to operate separately in each. Still more evident is it, that the same specific function or act, cannot possibly belong to the two departments and be separately exerciseable by each.  
  
Legislative power may be concurrently vested in different legislative bodies. Executive powers may be concurrently vested in different executive magistrates. In legislative acts the executive may have a participation, as in the qualified negative on the laws. In executive acts, the legislature, or at least a branch of it, may participate, as in the appointment to offices. Arrangements of this sort are familiar in theory, as well as in practice. But an independent exercise of an executive act, by the legislature alone, or of a legislative act by the executive alone, one or other of which must happen in every case where the same act is exerciseable by each, and the latter of which would happen in the case urged by the writer, is contrary to one of the first and best maxims of a well organized government, and ought never to be founded in a forced construction, much less in opposition to a fair one. Instances, it is true, may be discovered among ourselves where this maxim, has not been faithfully pursued; but being generally acknowledged to be errors, they confirm, rather than impeach the truth and value of the maxim.  
It may happen also that different independent departments, the legislative and executive, for example, may in the exercise of their functions, interpret the constitution differently, and thence lay claim each to the same power. This difference of opinion is an inconvenience not entirely to be avoided. It results from what may be called, if it be thought fit, a concurrent right to expound the constitution. But this species of concurrence is obviously and radically different from that in question. The former supposes the constitution to have given the power to one department only; and the doubt to be to which it has been given. The latter supposes it to belong to both; and that it may be exercised by either or both, according to the course of exigencies.  
A concurrent authority in two independent departments to perform the same function with respect to the same thing, would be as awkward in practice, as it is unnatural in theory.  
If the legislature and executive have both a right to judge of the obligations to make war or not, it must sometimes happen, though not at present, that they will judge differently. The executive may proceed to consider the question to-day, may determine that the United States are not bound to take part in a war, and in the execution of its functions proclaim that determination to all the world. To-morrow, the legislature may follow in the consideration of the same subject, may determine that the obligations impose war on the United States, and in the execution of its functions, enter into a constitutional declaration, expressly contradicting the constitutional proclamation.  
In what light does this present the constitution to the people who established it? In what light would it present to the world, a nation, thus speaking, thro’ two different organs, equally constitutional and authentic, two opposite languages, on the same subject and under the same existing circumstances?  
But it is not with the legislative rights alone that this doctrine interferes. The rights of the judiciary may be equally invaded. For it is clear that if a right declared by the constitution to be legislative, and actually vested by it in the legislature, leaves, notwithstanding, a similar right in the executive whenever a case for exercising it occurs, in the course of its functions: a right declared to be judiciary and vested in that department may, on the same principle, be assumed and exercised by the executive in the course of its functions: and it is evident that occasions and pretexts for the latter interference may be as frequent as for the former. So again the judiciary department may find equal occasions in the execution of its functions, for usurping the authorities of the executive: and the legislature for stepping into the jurisdiction of both. And thus all the powers of government, of which a partition is so carefully made among the several branches, would be thrown into absolute hotchpot, and exposed to a general scramble.  
It is time however for the writer himself to be heard, in defence of his text. His comment is in the words following:  
“If the legislature have a right to make war on the one hand, it is on the other the duty of the executive to preserve peace, till war is declared; and in fulfilling that duty, it must necessarily possess a right of judging what is the nature of the obligations which the treaties of the country impose on the government; and when in pursuance of this right it has concluded that there is nothing inconsistent with a state of neutrality, it becomes both its province and its duty to enforce the laws incident to that state of the nation. The executive is charged with the execution of all laws, the laws of nations, as well as the municipal law which recognizes, and adopts those laws. It is consequently bound, by faithfully executing the laws of neutrality, when that is the state of the nation, to avoid giving a cause of war to foreign powers.”  
To do full justice to this master piece of logic, the reader must have the patience to follow it step by step.  
If the legislature have a right to make war on the one hand, it is on the other, the duty of the executive to preserve peace till war is declared.  
It will be observed that here is an explicit and peremptory assertion, that it is the duty of the executive to preserve peace, till war is declared.  
And in fulfilling that duty it must necessarily possess a right of judging what is the nature of the obligations which the treaties of the country impose on the government: That is to say, in fulfilling the duty to preserve peace, it must necessarily possess the right to judge whether peace ought to be preserved; in other words whether its duty should be performed. Can words express a flatter contradiction? It is self evident that the duty in this case is so far from necessarily implying the right, that it necessarily excludes it.  
And when in pursuance of this right it has concluded that there is nothing in them (obligations) inconsistent with a state of neutrality, it becomes both its province and its duty to enforce the laws incident to that state of the nation.  
And what if it should conclude that there is something inconsistent? Is it or is it not the province and duty of the executive to enforce the same laws? Say it is, you destroy the right to judge. Say it is not, you cancel the duty to obey.  
Take this sentence in connection with the preceeding and the contradictions are multiplied. Take it by itself, and it makes the right to judge and conclude whether war be obligatory, absolute, and operative; and the duty to preserve peace, subordinate and conditional.  
It will have been remarked by the attentive reader that the term peace in the first clause has been silently exchanged in the present one, for the term neutrality. Nothing however is gained by shifting the terms. Neutrality means peace; with an allusion to the circumstance of other nations being at war. The term has no reference to the existence or non-existence of treaties or alliances between the nation at peace and the nations at war. The laws incident to a state of neutrality, are the laws incident to a state of peace, with such circumstantial modifications only as are required by the new relation of the nations at war: Until war therefore be duly authorised by the United States they are as actually neutral when other nations are at war, as they are at peace, (if such a distinction in the terms is to be kept up) when other nations are not at war. The existence of eventual engagements which can only take effect on the declaration of the legislature, cannot, without that declaration, change the actual state of the country, any more in the eye of the executive than in the eye of the judiciary department. The laws to be the guide of both, remain the same to each, and the same to both.  
Nor would more be gained by allowing the writer to define than to shift the term neutrality. For suppose, if you please, the existence of obligations to join in war to be inconsistent with neutrality, the question returns upon him, what laws are to be inforced by the executive until effect shall be given to those obligations by the declaration of the legislature? Are they to be the laws incident to those obligations, that is incident to war? However strongly the doctrines or deductions of the writer may tend to this point, it will not be avowed. Are the laws to be enforced by the executive, then, in such a state of things, to be the same as if no such obligations existed? Admit this, which you must admit if you reject the other alternative, and the argument lands precisely where it embarked—in the position, that it is the absolute duty of the executive in all cases to preserve peace till war is declared, not that it is “to become the province and duty of the executive” after it has concluded that there is nothing in those obligations inconsistent with a state of peace and neutrality. The right to judge and conclude therefore so solemnly maintained in the text is lost in the comment.  
We shall see whether it can be reinstated by what follows—  
The executive is charged with the execution of all laws, the laws of nations as well as the municipal law which recognizes and adopts those laws. It is consequently bound, by faithfully executing the laws of neutrality when that is the state of the nation, to avoid giving cause of war to foreign powers.  
The first sentence is a truth, but nothing to the point in question. The last is partly true in its proper meaning, but totally untrue in the meaning of the writer. That the executive is bound faithfully to execute the laws of neutrality, whilst those laws continue unaltered by the competent authority, is true; but not for the reason here given, to wit, to avoid giving cause of war to foreign powers. It is bound to the faithful execution of these as of all other laws internal and external, by the nature of its trust and the sanction of its oath, even if turbulent citizens should consider its so doing as a cause of war at home, or unfriendly nations should consider its so doing, as a cause of war abroad. The duty of the executive to preserve external peace, can no more suspend the force of external laws, than its duty to preserve internal peace can suspend the force of municipal laws.  
It is certain that a faithful execution of the laws of neutrality may tend as much in some cases, to incur war from one quarter, as in others to avoid war from other quarters. The executive must nevertheless execute the laws of neutrality whilst in force, and leave it to the legislature to decide whether they ought to be altered or not. The executive has no other discretion than to convene and give information to the legislature on occasions that may demand it; and whilst this discretion is duly exercised the trust of the executive is satisfied, and that department is not responsible for the consequences. It could not be made responsible for them without vesting it with the legislative as well as with the executive trust.  
These remarks are obvious and conclusive, on the supposition that the expression “laws of neutrality” means simply what the words import, and what alone they can mean, to give force or colour to the inference of the writer from his own premises. As the inference itself however in its proper meaning, does not approach towards his avowed object, which is to work out a prerogative for the executive to judge, in common with the legislature, whether there be cause of war or not in a public obligation, it is to be presumed that “in faithfully executing the laws of neutrality” an exercise of that prerogative was meant to be included. On this supposition the inference, as will have been seen, does not result from his own premises, and has been already so amply discussed, and, it is conceived, so clearly disproved, that not a word more can be necessary on this branch of his argument.

THE do&amp;rine which has been examined, is  
pregnant with inferences and consequen­  
ces against which no ramparts in the tonftituti­  
on could defend the public liberty, or scarcely  
the forms qf government. Were  
it once established that the powers of war and  
treaty are in their nature executive ; that so far  
as they are not by &lt;onflru&lt;sion transfer­  
red to the legislature, they actually belong to  
the executive ; that of course all powers not  
less executive in their nature than those powers, 1  
if not granted to the legislature may be claim  
eel by the executive: if granted, are to be ta­  
ken flriftly, with a refuluary right in the execu­  
tive ; or,as will hereafter appear, perhaps claim­  
ed as a concurrent right by the executive ; and  
no citizen could any longer guess at the charac­  
ter of the government under which he lives ;  
the naoft penetrating jurist would be unable to  
(can conftru&amp;ive prerogative.  
r.tt&gt; the lctfurc • f the rc&amp;-  
d« r deflation« which the author having omit­  
ted might not chufe to own, I proceed to the  
examination of one, with which that liberty  
cannot be taken.  
  
&quot; However true it may be (fays he) that the  
right of the legiflatufe to declare war includes  
the right of judging whether the legiilatura be  
under obligations to make war or not, it will  
not follow that the executive is in any cafe exclu­  
ded from a [miliar rigfjt of judging *n &#x27;be execu­  
tion of its own firo&amp;icyis.&quot;  
A material error of the writer in this appli­  
cation of his doctrine lies in his Ihrinking from  
its regular consequences. Had he&#x27;ftuck to his  
principle in its f&#x27;.ill cKtjent, and reasoned from  
it without reftriiint, he would only have had to  
defend himfelf against bn opponents. By yield  
fng the great point, that the right to declare  
war, tho to be taken includes the right to  
judge whether the nation be under obligation to  
make war or not, he is compelled to defend his  
argument not only against others but against  
himfelf also. &#x27; Observe how he struggles in his  
•wn toils.  
  
He had before admitted that the right to de­  
clare war i» vetted &#x27;m rfre legislature. He here  
Admits that the right to declare war includes  
the right to judge whether the United States be  
obliged&quot; to declare war or not. Can the infe­  
rence be avoided, that the executive instead of  
having a similar right to judge, is as much ex­  
cluded from the right to judge as from the right  
to declare ?  
  
If the right to declare war be an exception  
out of the general grant to the executive power;  
every thing included in the right mufl be includ­  
ed in the exception ; and being included in the  
exception, is excluded from the -grant.  
Ke cannot diftntanglfc himfelf by consider­  
ing the right of the executive to judge as con­  
current with that of the legislature. For if the  
executive have a concurrent right to judge, and  
the right to judge be included in (it is in fa&lt;sl  
the very essence of) -the right to declare, he  
must go on and fay that the executive has a con-  
Current right, also ta dcclare. AthJ thfn what  
will he do with his other admission, that the  
power to declare is an exception out of the ex­  
ceu:-Lve power.  
  
Perhaps an attempt may be made to creep  
out of the difficulty through the words &quot; in rh&#x27;  
execution of its functions,&quot; Here again h&lt;  
mud equally fail.  
  
Whatever oifficulties may a rife in defining  
he executive i uthority in particular cases, there  
can be none in deciding on aR authority clearly  
placed by the in another depart­  
ment. In this cafe the has decided  
what (hall not be deemed an executive autho­  
rity,; tho&#x27; it may not have clearly decided in  
every cafe what {hall be so deemed. The decla­  
ring of war is expressly made alegiflative func­  
tion. &#x27;The judging; of the obligations to make  
war, is admitfed to be included as a legifla&#x27;ive  
fnn&amp;ion. Whenever then a question occurs  
whether &#x27;.var {ball be declared, or whether pub­  
lic stipulations require it, the question neccflari­  
ly belongs to the department to which those  
fun&amp;ions belong—And no other department can  
be in the execution of it* proffer fun£2iottsy it it  
Ihould undertake to dceide such a question.  
There can be no refuge against this conclu­  
sion, but in the pretext of a concurrent right in  
both to judge of the obligations to  
declare war, and this mull be intended by the  
writer when he fays, &quot; it will not follow tha*-  
the exe&lt;utive is excluded In any cafeivom a Ji  
nilar right of judging &amp;c.&quot;  
As thisis the ground on which the ultimate  
defence is to be made, and which must either  
be maintained, or the works cre&amp;ed on it, de­  
tnolifhed ; it will be proper to give its strength  
a fair trial.  
  
It has been fecn that the idea of a coneurtc*t  
right is at variance with other ideas advanced  
or admitted by the writer. laying aside for  
the present that consideration, it feetfis im­  
possible to avoid concluding that if the execu­  
tive has a concurrent right with the   
to judge of obligations to declare war, and the  
right to judge be eflentialta included in the right  
to declare, ii mnik have the fame right to dc­  
  
7.. i-  
  
dare as it has to judge; &amp;by another analogy,  
feh« fame right to judge of other cauies of war,  
as of the particular cause found in a public Sti­  
pulation. So that&#x27;whenever the execmive in the  
ctutfe of itsfunftiens shall meet wi&#x27;.h these cases,  
it mutt either infer an equal authority in all, or  
acknowledge its want of authority in any.  
If any doubt c;in remain, or rather if any  
doubt could ever have arisen, which fide of the  
&lt;the native ought to be embraced, it can be  
With those only who overlook or rcjdvSl; some of  
the mnft obviou«ajid eifemiaj (ruths in politi­  
cal ftieoce.  
  
The power &#x27;to judge of the causes of war as  
involved in the power to declare war, is exprqfs-  
Jy veiled where all uther leijiflative powers are  
vetted, that is, in theQopgrefs of the United  
State?, It is consequently determined by $he  
gonlbtution to be a Legjlativ£ fio-wer, Now  
omitting the enquiry here in what refpe&amp;s a  
compound power may be partly legislative, and  
p.artly executive, and accordingly veiled partly  
in the one, and partly in the other department,  
or* 3;r&#x27;ift!y In %oth; &lt;&#x27; v=T*ri&lt;**: uO*d on another  
occafinn is equally conclusive on this, that the  
fame power, cannot belong in the rvboh, to both  
departments, or be properly so vested as to ope­  
rate Separately in each. Still more evident is it,  
&quot;that the fame jpccific function or cannot possi­  
bly belong to the tivo departments and be fepe­  
rately exercifeable by each.  
LegislatiVe power may be concurrently vested  
indifferent legislative bodies. Executive pow­  
ers may be concurrently Vested in different exe­  
cutive magistrates. In legislative a&amp;s the exe­  
cutive may have a participation, as in the qua­  
lified negative on the laws. In executive a&amp;s,  
the legislature, or at least a branch of it, may  
participate, as in ths appointment to offices.—  
Arrangements of this fort are familiar in theo­  
ry, as well as in pra£lice. But an independent  
exercifeof ar» executive a£l% by the legislature a­  
lone, or of a legtjlaitve aftky the executive alone y  
&#x27; one or other of which mull happen in every  
cafe where the fame a&amp; i* exercifeable by each,  
and the latter of which would happen in the  
cafe urged bv t&#x27; e writer, is contrary to one of  
the firft and best maxims of a well organized  
gbvernment, andought&#x27; never to be founded in  
a forced cenllrucfiipn, much less in opposition to  
a fair one. Ir.ftances, it is true, may be disco­  
vered amohg ourselves where this maxim, has  
not been faithfully pursued ;*but being general­  
ly acknowledged to be errors, they confirm, ra­  
ther than Impeach the truth and value of the  
  
maxim.  
It may happen also that different independent  
departments, the legislative and executive, for  
example, may in the exercise of their functions,  
conllitution differently, and thence  
lay claim each to the fame power. This diffe­  
rence of opinion is an inconvenience not entire­  
ly to be avoided. It results from what may be  
called, if it bethought fit, a concurrent right to  
expound the couftitution. But this fpectes of  
concurrence is obviously and radically different  
from that in question. The former supposes the  
conrtitwtion to l&gt;ave given the power to one de­  
partment only ; and the doubt to be to which  
it has been given. The latter supposes it to be­  
long to both ; and that it may be exercised by  
either or both, according to the course of exi-  
  
gencies.  
A concurrent authority in two independent  
departments to perform the fame lun&amp;ion with  
refpeift to the fame-thing, would be as awkward  
in practice, as it is unnatural in theory.  
If the legillature and executive have both a  
right to judge of the obligations to make War  
or not, it mud sometimes happen, though not  
at present, that they will judge differently. —  
The executive may proceed to consider the ques­  
tion to-day, may determine that the United  
States are not bound to take part in a war, and  
in the execution ./ it, function, proclaim that de­  
termination to all the world. To-morrow, the  
leeiflature may follow in the confutation of  
the fame fubje&lt;ft, may determine that the obli­  
gations impose war on the United States, and  
i„ tie execution of it, funaion,, enter into a enfli­  
tutional&#x27;dtcUratio», expressly contradicting the  
conßitutional proclamation.  
In what light does this present the conlliruti­  
on to the people who it ? In what  
light would it present to the world, a nation,  
thus speaking, thro&#x27; two different organs, c­  
qually conftimtional and authentic, two eppo­  
fite languiges, on the lame fubje&amp; and under  
the fame exiftingcircumftaiices?  
But it is not with the legislative rights alone  
that this do&amp;rine interferes. The rights of the  
judiciary may be equally invaded. For ,t is  
clear that if a right declared by thecontt.tut.on  
to be legislative, and actually veiled by it in the  
Wiflature, leaves, notwithftand.ng, a similar  
right in the executive whenever a cafe for exer­  
eifing it occurs, in tie course of it, funaion,; a  
rieht declared to be judiciary and vested in that  
department may, on the fame principle, be as­  
sumed and exercised by the executive .n lie  
course of it, funaion. . and it is evident that oc­  
casion? and pie texts for the Utter interference  
may be as frequent as for the former. So again  
the judiciary department may find equal occa­  
sions in the execution of it. funft.ons, for ufuro.  
ing the authorities »f the executive : and the

legislature for flapping into the jurifdi&amp;ion of  
both. And thus all the powers of government,&#x27;  
of which a partition is so carefully made among  
the several blanches, would be thrown into ab­  
solute hotchpot, and exposed to a general fcrahi­  
ble.  
  
It is time however for the writer himfelf to  
be heard, in defence of his text. His comment  
is in the words following :  
&quot; If the legislature have a right to make war  
on the one han4, it is on the other the duty of  
the executive to:preferve peace, till war is de­  
clared ; and in fulfilling that duty, it mull ne.-  
ceffarily possess a right of judging what is the  
nature of the obligations which the treaties 6f j  
the country ijnpofc 011 the government; and  
when in pursuance of this right it has conclud­  
ed that there is nothing inconsistent with a state 1  
of neutrality, it becomes both its province and J  
its duty to enforce th&lt;? laws incident to that  
state of the nation. The executive is charged  
with the execution of&#x27;all laws, the laws ol nati­  
ons, aswe|l as the municipal law whjch recog­  
nizes and adopts those laws. It is consequently  
by faithfully executing the laws of neu­  
trality, when that is the state of the nation, to  
avoid giving a cause of war to foreign powers.&quot;  
To do full justice to this master piece of logic,  
the reader must have the patience to follow it  
step by llep.  
If the legislature have a right to make ivar on the  
one hand, it is on the other, the duty of the executive  
to preserve peace till ivar is declared.  
It will be observed that here is an explicit and  
peremptory assertion, that it is the duty of the  
executive to preserve peace, till &#x27;war is declared.  
And in fulfilling that duty it mufl neccffarily pos­  
sess. a tight of judging what is the nature of the ob­  
ligations ivhich the treaties of the country impose on  
the government : That is to fay, in fulfilling the  
dutyto preserve peace, it must necessarily possess thfe  
right to judge whether pcace ought to be preserv­  
ed; in other words ivhether its duty Jhould be per­  
formed. Can words exprels a flatter contradic­  
tion ? It is felf evident that the duty in thit cafe  
is so far from necessarily implying the rightf that it  
neccffarily excludes it.  
And ivhen in pursuance of this right it has con­  
cluded that there is nothing in them in­  
conftfent rvith a fate of neutrality, IT BECOME 4  
ooifo Us province and its duty to erjtrce the luivs in­  
cident to that fate of the nation.  
And what if it (hould conclude that there is -  
fomethitig inconsistent ? Is it or is it not the  
province and duty of the executive to enforce  
the lame laws ? Say it is, you destroy the right  
to judge. Say it is not, you cancel the duty to  
obey.  
Take this sentence in connexion with the  
preceeding and the contradictions are multipli­  
ed. Take it by itfelf, and it makes the right to  
judge and conclude whether war be obligatory,  
absolute, and operative ; and the duty to pre­  
serve peace, subordinate and conditional.  
  
It will have been remarked by the attentive  
reader that the term peace in the firfl daufe has  
been silently exchanged in the present one, for  
ths term neutrality. Nfflthlng however is gain­  
ed by fhifting the terms. Neutrality means  
peace, with an atlufion to the circumstance of  
other uations being at war. The term has no re­  
ference to the existence or non existence of trea­  
ties or alliances between the nation at peace and  
the nations at war. The laws incident to a  
state of neutrality, are the laws inc dent to a  
Hate of peace, with such circumstantial modi&lt;-  
cations only as are required by the new relati­  
on of the uations at war : Until war therefore  
be duly auihorifed by the United States they  
are as ad&#x27;ually neutral when other nations are  
at war, as they are at peace, (if such a diftinAi­  
on in the terms is to be kept up) when other  
nations are not at war. The existence of even­  
tual engagements which can only take effect on  
the declaration of the legislature, cannot, with­  
out that declaration, change the iliual state of  
the country, any more in the eye of the execu­  
tive than in the «ye of the judiciary department.  
The laws to be the guide ef both, remain the  
fame to each, and the fame to both.  
  
Nor would more be gained by allowing the  
writer to define than toihift the term neutrality*  
For fuppofc, if you please, the exifteuce of ob­  
ligations to join in war to be inconsistent with  
neutrality, the question returns upon him,  
what laws are to be inforced by the executive  
until effed (hall be given to those obligations  
by the declaration of the legislature ? Are they  
to be the laws incident to those obligations,that  
is incident to war ! However flrongiy the doc­  
trine* of deductions of the writer may tend to  
this point, it will not be avowed. Are the  
laws to be enforced by the executive, tken, in  
such a state of thin gs, to be the fame as If no such  
obligations exifttd ? Admit this, which you  
must admit if you reject the other alternative,  
and the argument lands precisely where it em­  
barked—in the polition, that it is the absolute  
duty of the executive in all cases to preserve  
peace till war is declared, not that it is &quot; tote­  
fame the province and duty of the executive&quot; af­  
ter it has concluded that there is nothing in  
those obligations inconsistent with a state of  
peace and neutrality. The right to judge and  
conclude therefore so solemnly maintained in  
the text it 101 l in the comment.  
  
[Whale No. 455.]  
  
  
We shall fee whether it can be reinstated by  
what follows—  
  
The executive it charged Ivitb the execution of ail  
la US) the taivs of nations as ivdl as the municipal  
laiv ivbicb recognizes and adopts tfyofe laxvs. It  
is CQnfequentJ% bound, by faithfully executing the  
laivs of neutrality Kvhen that is the fifktt of the nati­  
on, to a vdid giving cause of tvar to foreign powers.  
The fi&#x27;rft fgntence is a truth, hut nothing; to  
the point in quclViou. The last is partly true in  
its proper meaning, but totally untrue in the  
meaning of the writer. That the executive is  
bqund faithfully to execute the laws of neutra­  
lity, wlii Ift those laws continue unaltered by  
the competent authority, is true; but not for  
the reason here given, to wit, to avoid giving  
cause of war to foreign powers. It is bound to  
the faithful execution of these as ot all other  
laws internal and external, by the nature of it 3  
truftand the fan&amp;ion «f its oath, even if turbu­  
lent citizens (hould consider i-S so doing as a  
cause of war at home, or unfriendly nations  
should consider its so doing, as a cause of war a­  
broad. The dmy of the executive to preserve  
external peace, can fib more iufpend the force of  
external laws, than its duty to preserve inter­  
nal pcace can suspend the force of municipal  
laws.  
  
It is certain that a faithful execution of the  
laws of neutrality may tend as much in some  
cases, to incur war from one quarter, as in  
others to avoid war from other quarter*. Th«  
executive must nevertheleCs execute the laws of  
neutrality whilst in force, and leave it to the le­  
gislature to decide whether they ought to be al­  
tered or not. The executive has no othefr dif­  
qretion than to convene and give information  
to the legislature on occasions that may demand  
it ; and whilst this discretion is duly exerciied  
the trust of the executive is fatisfied,and that de­  
partment is not refpoaCble for the consequen­  
ces. Jt could not be made responsible for them  
without vesting it with the legislative as well  
as with the executive trust.  
  
These remarks are.obvious and conclusive, on  
the fuppofitiori that the cxpreflion &quot; laws of  
neutrality&quot; means simply what the words ihi­  
port, and what alone they can mean, to give  
force or colour tb the inference of the writer  
from his own premises. As the inference itfelf  
however in its proper meaning, does not ap­  
proach towards his avowed objedt, which is to  
work out a prerogative for the executive to  
judgs, in common with the legislature, whether  
cause of war or not ina public obligati­  
on, it is to be presumed that &quot; in faithfully  
executing the laws of neutrality&quot; an exercise of  
that prerogative was meant to be included. On  
this fuppoiition the inference, as will have been  
seen, does not result from his own premife3, and  
has been already so amply difcufled, and, it is  
conceived, so.clearly that not a word  
more can be necessary on this branch of his ar-
