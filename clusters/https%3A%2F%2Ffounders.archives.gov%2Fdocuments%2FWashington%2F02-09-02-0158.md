Dear Sir,  
Mount Vernon April 3d 1773.  
  
I am now set down to write to you on a Subject of Importance, &amp; of no small embarrassment to me. My Son in Law &amp; Ward, Mr Custis, has, as I have been informd, paid his Addresses to your Second Daughter, &amp; having made some progress in her Affections required her in Marriage—How far a union of this Sort may be agreeable to you, you best can tell, but I should think myself wanting in Candour was I not to acknowledge, that Miss Nellys amiable qualification’s stands confess’d at all hands; and that, an alliance with your Family, will be pleasing to his.  
This acknowledgement being made, you must permit me to add Sir, that at this, or in any short time, his youth, inexperience, and unripened Education is, &amp; will be insuperable obstacles in my eye, to the completion of the Marriage—As his Guardian, I conceive it to be my indispensable duty (to endeavour) to carry him through a regular course of Education, many Branches of which, sorry I am to add, he is totally difficient of, and, to guard his youth to a more advancd age before an Event, on which his own Peace, &amp; the happiness of another is to depend, takes place; not that I have any doubt of the warmth of his affection, nor I hope I may add, any fears of a change in them; but at present, I do not conceive that he is capable of bestowing that due attention to the Important consequences, of a Marriage State, which is necessary to be done by those who are Inclind to enter into it; &amp; of course am unwilling he should do it till he is—If the affection which they have avowd for each other is fixd upon a Solid Basis, it will receive no diminution in the Course of two or three years, in which time he may prosecute his Studies, and thereby render himself more deserving of the Lady &amp; useful to Society; If unfortunately (as they are both young) there should  
  
be an abatement of affection on either side, or both, it had better preceed, than follow after, Marriage.  
Delivering my Sentiments thus, will not, I hope, lead you into a belief that I am desirous of breaking of the Match—to postpone it, is all I have in view; for I shall recommend it to the young Gentleman with the warmth that becomes a Man of honour (notwithstanding he did not vouchsafe to consult either his Mother, or me, on the occasion) to consider himself as much engagd to your Daughter as if the indissoluble Knot was tied; and, as the surest means of effecting this, to stick close to his Studies (in which I flatter myself you will join me) by which he will, in a great measure, avoid those little Flirtation’s with other Girls which may, by dividing the attention, contribute not a little to divide the affection.  
It may be expected of me perhaps, to say something of Fortune, But, to discend to particulars, at this time, may seem rather premature—In general therefore I shall inform you, that, Mr Custis’s Estate consists of abt 15,000 Acres of Land, good part of it adjoing to the City of Wmsburg, &amp; none 40 Miles from it; sevl Lotts in the said City; between two &amp; three hundd Negroes; and about Eight or ten thousd Pounds upon Bond, &amp; in the hands of his Merchts—this Estate he now holds independant of his Mothers Dower, wch will be an acquisition to it at her Death, &amp; upon the whole such an one, as you will readily acknowledge ought to entitle him to a handsome Portion in a Wife; But, as I shd never require a Child of my own to make a Sacrafice of himself to Interest, so, neither do I think it incumbt on me, to recommend it as a Guardian; but as I know you are full able, I should hope, &amp; expect, if we were now upon the point of Settling these Preliminaries, that you would also be willing to do something genteel by your Daughter.  
At all times when you, Mrs Calvert, or the young Ladies can make it convenient to favour us with a visit we should be happy in seeing you at this place. Mrs Washington &amp; Miss Custis join me in respectful Compliments, and I am Dr Sir Yr Most Obedt Servt  
  
Go: Washington

holds, independent of his mother&#x27;s dower, which will be  
an addition to it at her death; and, upon the whole, it is  
srch an estate as you will readily acknowledge ought to  
entitle him to a handsome portion with a wife. But as I  
should never require a child of my own to make a sacrifice  
of himself to interest, so neither do I think it incumbent  
on me to recommend it as a guardian.  
At all time when you, Mrs. Calvert or the young ladies,

MOUNT VKRNOW, Aprt! 3, 1773.  
Dear sir—*l am now set dewu to -write to you  
on a subject of importance, and of no small  
t tnbarraosmer.t to me. My son-in-law, and  
vrard, Mr. Curtis, has, as i have been informed,  
p aid his r.ddrecses to your second daughter, and  
having ntade-oome progress in her affections,  
It is solicited iter hand in marriage. How far a  
union oftltisecrt may heagreeablo&#x27;to you,you  
best can tell;-but I should think myeulf wanting  
in candor, were I not to confess, tliat Miss Nol­  
ly &#x27;s amiable qualities are acknowledged on all  
ha lids, and that an alliance with your family  
will be pleasing to his.  
This acknowledgement being made, you  
must permit DK to add, sir, that ct this, or in  
any short lime, his youth, inexperience, and  
unripened education, are, and will be, insupe­  
rable obstacles, in my opinion, to the comple­  
tion of the marriage. As his guardian, I con­  
ceive it my indispensable duty to endeavor to  
carry hiin through a regular course of educa­  
tion, (many branches f which I am sorry to  
add, ho is totally deficient in) and to guard his  
youth to a more advanced age, before art event, J  
on which his own peace and the happiness oi;  
another are to depend, takes place. Not that 1  
liuve any doubt of the warmth of his affection, |  
nor, 1 hope I may add, any fears of a change  
in tliem; but at present 1 do not conceive that:  
he is capable of bestowing that attention to the  
important consequences of the marriage state,j  
which is necessary to bo given by those who!  
are about to enter it, and of course, I am un­  
willing he should doit until he is. If the affec­  
tion which they avowed for each other, is  
fixed upon a solid basis, it will receive no di­  
minution in the course of two or three years,!  
in whioii time he ntay prosecute itis studies,  
and thereby render himsolf moro doserving of  
the lady, and useful in society. If unfortunate- i  
ly, as they are both young, thero should be an 1  
abatement of affection on either side, or both,  
it had better precede than follow marriage.  
Delivering my sentiments thus freely will  
not, I hope, lead you into a belief, that I am  
anxious of breaking off the match. To post­  
pone it is all I have in view; for I shall recom- i  
mend to the young gentlemen with the warmth :  
that becomes a man of honor, (notwithstand­  
ing he did not vouchsafe to consult either his  
mother or nte on the occasion,) to consider  
himself as, much engaged to your daughter as  
if the indissoluble knot wcro tied; and as the  
surest means of effecting this, to apply himself  
closely to his studies, (and in this advice I flat­  
ter myself you will join me,) by which he will  
in a great measure avoid those little flirtations  
with other young ladies, that by dividing the  
attention, contribute not a little to divide the  
affection.  
It may be expected of nte, perhaps, to say  
something about property: hut to descend tu  
particulars at this time, must seem rather pre­  
mature. 11l general, then, 1 shall inform yon,  
that Mr. Curtis&#x27; estate consists of about fifteen  
thousand acres of land, a good part of it ad­  
joining the city of Williamsburg, and none of  
it forty miles from that place; several lots in

| Mount Vernon, April 3, 1773.  
’ Dear Sir,—l am now sct down to write  
;t() you on a subject of importanee, and of  
no small embariassment to me. My son­  
&quot;in-l:lw and ward, Mr. Curtis, has as I have  
&#x27;bm&#x27;n informed, paid | is addresses to your  
second danghter, and having made some  
\prngro-sﬁ in her affections, has solicited her  
hand in marriage. How far a union of this  
sort may be agreeable to you, you best can  
tell 5 but I should think myself wanting in  
eandor, were I not to confess; that Miss  
Nclly‘s amiable qualitics are acknowledged  
on all hands, and that an alliance with your  
family will be pleasing to his.  
This acknowledgement being made, you  
must permit me to add, sir, that at this, or  
in any short time, his youth, inexperience,  
end unripenad education, are, and will be  
insuperable obstacles in my opinion, to the  
completion of the marriage. As his guar­  
dian, T conceive it my indispensable duty  
to endeavor to carry him through a regu­  
lar course of education, (many branches of  
which T am sorry to 2dd, he is totally de­  
ficient in) and to guard his youth to a more  
advaneed age, before an event, on which  
his own peace and the happiness of another  
are to depend, takes place. Not that T  
have any doubt of the warmth of his affee­  
tion, nor I Lope I may add, any fears of a  
change in them; but at present I do not  
conceive that he is capuble of bestowing  
that attention to the important consc­  
quences of the marriage state, which is no­  
cessary to be given by those who are about  
to enter ity and of course, 1 am unwilling  
he should do it until heis. If the affection  
‘which they avowed for each other iz fixed  
upon a solid basis, it will receive no dimi­  
nution in the course of two or three years,  
in which time he may prosecute his studies  
and thereby render himself more deserving  
of the lady, and useful in society. If, un­  
fortunately, as they are both young, there  
should be an abatement of affeetion on ei­  
ther side, or both, it had better precede  
than follow marriage.  
Delivering my sentiments thus freely  
will not, I hope, lead you into a belicef,  
that I am anxious of breaking off the mateh.  
To postpone it is all T have in view ; for I  
shall recommend to the young gentleman,  
with the warmth that becomes a man of  
Lonor, (notwithstanding he did not vouch­  
cafe to consult cither his mother or me on  
the oceasion), to consider himself as much  
engaged to your daughter as if the indisso­  
luble knot were tied 3 and as the surest  
means of affeeting this, to app!y himself  
closely to his studies, (and in this advice T  
flatter myself you will join me,) by which  
he will in a great measure avoid those little  
flirtations with other young ladics, that by  
dividing the attention, contribute not a lit­  
tie to divide the affection,  
At all times when you, Mrs, Calvert or  
the young ladies, can make it convenient  
to favor us with a visit, we should be happy  
in seeing you at this place. Mrs. Wash­  
ington and Miss Curtis join me in respeet­  
ful compliments,  
I amy, dear siry your most obedient ser­  
vant,
