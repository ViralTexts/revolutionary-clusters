In answer to your obliging enquiries respecting the dress, attitude &amp;c. which I would wish to have given to the Statue in question, I have only to observe that not having a sufficient knowledge in the art of sculpture to oppose my judgment to the taste of Connoisseiurs, I do not desire to dictate in the matter; on the contrary I shall be perfectly satisfied with whatever may be judged decent and proper.

 business.  
We have no news of importance and if we had, I should hardly be in the way of learning it; as I divide my time between the superintendance of opening the navigations of our rivers and attention to my private concerns.—Indeed I am too much secluded from the world to know with certainty, what sensation the refusal of the British to deliver up the Western posts, has made on the public mind.—I fear the edge of its sensibility is somewhat blunted.—Fœderal measures are not yet universally adopted. New York, which was as well disposed a State as any in the Union is said to have become in a degree antifœderal. Some other States are, in my opinion, falling into very foolish and wicked plans of emitting paper money.—I cannot however give up my hopes and expectations that we shall’ere long adopt a more liberal system of policy. What circumstances will lead, or what misfortunes will compel us to it, is more than can be told without the spirit of prophecy.  
In the meantime the people are industrious, œconomy begins to prevail, and our internal governments are, in general, tolerably well administered.  
You will probably have heard of the death of Genl. Greene before this reaches you, in which case you will, in common with your Countrymen, have regretted the loss of so great and so honest a man. Genl. McDougall, who was a brave soldier and a disinterested patriot, is also dead. He belonged to the Legislature of his State, the last act of his life, was (after being carried on purpose to the Senate) to give his voice against the emission of a paper currency. Colo. Tilghman, who was formerly of my family, died lately and left as fair a reputation as ever belonged to a human character.—Thus some of the pillars of the revolution fall. Others are mouldering by insensible degrees. May our Country never want props to support the glorious fabrick!  
With sentiments of the highest esteem and regard, I
