Dear Sir  
  
  
  
Montpr.  
  
Decr. 23. 1832  
  
  
I have recd. yours of the 19th. inclosing some of the S. C. papers. There is in one of them some interesting  
views of the doctrine of secession; one that had occurred to me, and which for the first time I have seen in print,  
namely that if one State can at will withdraw from the others, the others can withdraw from her, and turn her, nolentem,  
volentem, out of the Union. Until of late, there is not a State that wd. have abhorred such a doctrine more than S. C., or  
more dreaded an application of it to herself. The same may be said of the doctrine of nullification which she now preaches  
as the only faith by which the Union can be saved  
I partake of the wonder that the men you name should view secession in the light mentioned. The essential  
difference between a free Govt. &amp; Govts. not free, is that the former is founded in compact, the parties to which  
are mutually and equally bound by it. Neither of them therefore can have a greater right to break off from the bargain,  
than the other or others have to hold him to it. And certainly there is nothing in the Virginia Resolutions of +98.  
adverse to this principle, which is that of common sense &amp; common justice. The fallacy which draws a different  
conclusion from them lies in confounding a single party, with the  
parties, to the Constitutional compact of the U. S. The latter having made the compact may do what they will  
with it. The former as one only of the parties, owes fidelity to it, till released by consent, or be absolved by an  
intolerable abuse of the power created. In the Virga Resolutions &amp; Report, the plural  
number, States, is in every instance used whenever reference is made  
to the authority which presided over the Govt. As I am now known to have drawn those documents, I may say as I do with a  
distinct recollection, that it was intentional. It was in fact required by the course of reasoning employed on the  
occasion. The Kentucky resolutions being less guarded have been more easily perverted. The pretext for the liberty taken  
with those of Virga. is the word respective prefixed to the &quot;rights &amp;c&quot; to be secured  
within the States. Could the abuse of the expression have been foreseen or suspected the form of it would doubtless have  
been varied. But what can be more consistent with common sense, than that all having the same rights &amp;c. should  
unite in contending for the security of them to each—  
It is remarkable how closely the nullifiers, who make the name of Mr. Jefferson the pedestal for their  
colossal heresy, shut their eyes &amp; lips, whenever his authority is ever so clearly &amp; emphatically agst.  
them. You have noticed what he says in his letters to Monroe &amp; Carrington ps. 43 &amp; 202. Vol 2d with  
respect to the power of the old Congs. to coerce delinquent States, and his reasons for preferring for the purpose a  
naval to a military force; and moreover his remark that it was not necessary to find a right to coerce, in the Federal  
Articles; that being inherent in the nature of a compact. It is hightime that the claim to secede at will should be put  
down by the public opinion; and I shall be glad to see the task commenced by one who understands the subject.  
I know nothing of what is passing at Richmond, more than what is seen in the newspapers. You were right in  
your foresight of the effect of passages in the late Proclamation. They have proved a leaven for much fermentation there,  
and created an alarm agst. the danger of consolidation, balancing that of disunion. I wish with you the Legislature may  
not seriously injure itself, by assuming the high character of Mediator. They will certainly do so if they forget that  
their real influence will be in the inverse ratio of a boastful interposition of it  
If you can fix, &amp; will name the day of your arrival at O. C. house we will have a horse there for  
you; and if you have more baggage than can be otherwise brought than on wheels, we will send such a vehicle for it. Such  
is the State of the roads produced by the waggons hurrying flour to market, that it may be impossible to send our carriage  
which would answer both purposes With cordial salutations

Montpelier, Dec; 23, 1832.  
Dear Sir : I have received yours of the i  
19th, enclosing some South Carolina papers  
There is in one of them some interesting ;  
views of the doctrine of secession, among i  
which one that had occurred to me, and i  
which for the first time I have seen in print, i  
namely, that if one State can at will with- 1  
draw from the others, the others can with- i  
draw from her, and turn her, nolcntem vo- \
lentem, out of the Union. ]  
Until of late there is not a State that j  
would have abhorred such a doctrine more  
than South Carolina, or more dreaded an j  
application of it to herself. The same may j 1  
be said of the doctrine of nullification, which i  
she now preaches as the only doctrine by ! i  
which the Union can be saved. L  
I partake of the wonder that the men you I  
name should view secession in the light j  
mentioned. The essential difference between ;  
a free Government and a Government not

free is that the former is founded in com­  
pact, the parties to which arc mutually and  
equally bound by it. Neither of them,  
therefore, can have a greater right to break  
off from the bargain than the other or others  
have to hold him to it; and certainly there  
is nothing in the Virginia resolutions of ’OB  
adverse to this principle, which is that of  
common sense and common justice.  
The fallacy which draws a dillorcnt con­  
clusion from them lies in confounding a  
single party with the parties to the consti­  
. tutional compact of the United States. The  
latter, having made the compact, may do  
what they will with it. The former, as one  
of the parties, owes fidelity to it till released  
.by consent or absolved by an intolerable  
abuse of the power created. In the Vir­  
ginia resolutions and report the plural num­  
ber (States) is in every instance used when­  
ever reference is made to the authority  
which presided over the Government.  
As I am now known to have drawn those  
documents, I may say, as I do with a dis­  
tinct recollection, that it was intentional.  
It was in fact required by the course of  
i reasoning employed on the occasion. The  
i Kentucky resolutions, being loss guarded,  
have been more easily perverted. The pre­  
text for the liberty taken with those of \ ir­  
giuia is the word “respective” prefixed to  
the “rights, &amp;c ” to be secured within the  
; States. Could the abuse of the expression  
have been foreseen or suspected, the form  
of it would doubtless have been varied. But  
what ean be more consistent with common  
sense than that all having the rights, &amp;c.  
should unite ia contending for the security  
of them to each ?  
It is remarkable how closely the nullifiers,  
who make the name of Mr. Jefferson the  
pedestal for their colossal heresy, shut their  
eyes and lips whenever his authority is ever  
so clearly and emphatically against them.  
You have noticed what he says in his letters  
to Monroe and Carrington (p. 43 and 203,  
vol. 2d) with respect to the power of the  
old Congress to coerce delinquent States;  
and his reasons for preferring for the pur­  
pose a naval to a military force ; and, more­  
over, his remark that it was not necessary  
&#x27;to find a right to coerce in the Federal ar­  
ticles, that being inherent in the nature of  
a compact. It is high time that the claim  
to secede at will should be put down by the  
public opinion, and I am glad to see the  
task commenced by one who understands  
the subject.

Montpelirr, Deo, 23, 1832.  
Dear Sir:---I have received yours of  
the 19th, enelosing some South, Carolina  
papers. There is in one of them somo  
interesting views of the dootrine of seces­  
sion, ameng which one that had occured  
to me, and whish for the first time I have  
seen in print, namely that of one State can  
at will withdraw from the others, the  
others can withdraw from her, and turn  
her nolentem volentem out of the Union.  
Until of late there is not a State that  
would have abhorred such doctrine mere  
than South Carolina, or more dreaded an  
application of it to herself. The same  
aay, be said of the dectrine of nullifica  
tion which she now preaches as the enly  
doetrine by which the Union can be saved.  
I partake of the wonder that the man  
you name should view secession in the  
mentioned. The essential differance be­  
tween a free Gevernment and a Govern  
ment not free is that the former is founded  
in compact, the parties to which are equal  
ly and mutually bound by it. Neither of  
them, therefore, can have a greater right  
to break eff from the bargain than the oth  
er or others have to hold him to it; and  
certainly there is nothing in the Virginia  
resolutions of &#x27;98 abverse to this principle  
which is that of common sense and cem-  
men justice.  
The fallacy which draws a different  
conclusion from them lios in confounding  
a single party with the parties to the con­  
stitational compact of the United States.  
The latter, having made the compact may  
do what they will with it. The former,  
as one of the parties, owes fidelity to it  
till realeased by consent or absolved by an  
intolerable abuse of the power created.  
In the Virginia resolutions and roport, the  
plural number (States) is in every instan­  
ce used when reference is made to the au­  
thority which presided over the Govern­  
me rI I am now known to have drawn,  
those decuments, I may say, as I do with  
a distinct recollection, that it, was inten­  
tional. It was in fact required by the  
course of reasoning employed on the oc­  
casion. The Kentuckey resolutions, be­  
ing less guarded have been more easily  
perverted. The pretext for the liberty  
taken with those of Virginia is the word  
respective&quot; prefixed to the &quot;rights, &amp;o,&quot;  
to be secured within the State. Could  
the abuse of the expression have been  
foreseen or suspected, the form ot it would  
doubtless have been varied. But what  
can be more consistent with common  
sense than that all having the rights e..  
should unite in contending for the security  
of them to each?  
It is remarkable how closely the nulli­  
fiers, who make the name of Mr. Jefferson  
the pedestal for their colossal heresay, shut  
their eyes and lips whenever his auther­  
ity is ever so clearly and emphatically  
against them. You have noticed what  
ho says in his letters to Monros Carring­  
ton (p.43 and 203, vol. 23) with respect  
to the power of the old Congress to co­  
erce delinquent States; and has reasons  
for preferring for the purpose a naval to a  
military force, and moreover, his remark  
that it was not necessary to find a right to  
ceerce in the Federal articles, that being  
inherrent in the nature of a compact. It  
is high time that! the claim to secede  
at will should be put down by the public  
opinion, and I am glad to see the task cem­  
menced by one who understands the sub­  
I Anow nothing of what is paseing at  
Richmond more than what is seen in the  
newspapers. You were right in your  
foresight of the effect of passages in the  
lats preclamation. They have proven a  
leaven for much fermentation thers, and  
created an alarm against the danger of  
consolidation balaneing that of disunion

thority which presided over the Government  
. As 1 am known to have drawn these documents.  
I may say, as I do with a distinct recollection, it was  
intentional. It was. in fact required by the course  
of reasoning employed on the occasion. The Ken­  
tucky resolutions, being less guarded, have been  
more easily perverted. The pretext for the liberty

It is remarkable how closely the nullifiers, who

not necessary to find a right to coerce in the Federal  
articles, that being inherent in the nature of a con­  
pact. It is high time that the claim to secede at  
Kill should be put down by the public opinion, and  
I am glad to see the task commenced by one who un­  
derstands the subject.  
I know nothing of what is passing at Richmond  
more than what is seen in the newspapers. You

Montpelisb, December 84, 1882.  
Dear Sir: I have received yours of the 19th, en­  
closing some South-Carolina papers. There is in one  
of them some interesting views of the doctrine of  
secession, among which one that had occurred to  
me, and which for the first time that I have seen in  
print namely, that if one State can at will withdraw  
from the others, the others can withdraw from her,  
and turn her, nolentem volentem, out of the Union.  
Until of late there is not a State that would have  
abhorred such a doctrine more than South-Carolina,  
or more dreaded an application of it to herself. The  
same may be said of the doctrine of nullification,  
which she now preaches as the only doctrine by  
which the Union can be. saved.  
I peruke of the wonder that the men you name  
should view secession in the light mentioned The  
essential difference between free Government and  
a Government not free is that the fomer is founded  
on compact, the parties to which are mutually and  
equally bound by it Neither of them, therefore,  
can have a greater right to break off from the bar­  
gain than the other or others have to hold him to  
it ; and certainly there is nothing in the Virginia  
resolutions of &#x27;8 adverse to this principle, which  
is that of common sense and common justice.  
The fallacy which draws a different conclusion  
from them lies in confounding a single party with  
the parties to the constitutional compact upon the  
United States. The latter, having made the com­  
pact, may do what they will with it The former,  
as one of the parties, owes fidelity to it till re&#x27;eased  
by consent, or absolved by an intolerable abuse of  
the power created. In the V lrginia resolutions and  
report the plural number (States) is in every in­  
stance used whenever reference is made to the au­  
thority which presided over the Government.  
As 1 am known to have drawn these documents.  
I may say, as I do with a distinct recollection, it was  
intentional. It was in fact required by the course  
of reasoning employed on the occasion. The Ken­  
tucky resolutions, being less guarded, have been  
more easily perverted. The pretext for the liberty  
taken with those of Virginia is the word &quot;respect  
ive,&quot; the &quot;rights, &amp;c,&quot; to be secured within the  
States. Could the abuse of the expression have been  
foreseen or suspected, the form of it would doubtless  
have been varied. But what can be more consist­  
ent with common sense than that all having the  
rights, &amp;c, should unite in contending for the secu  
! rity of them to each ?  
It is remarkable how closely the nullifiers, who  
i make the name of Mr. Jefferson the pedestal for  
j their colossal heresy, shut their eyes and lips when­  
! ever his authority is ever so clearly and emphatical-  
ly against them. You have noticed what he says in 5  
his letters to Monroe and Camngton (p. 43 and 200  
vol. 2d) with respect to the power of the old Con­  
gress to coerce the delinquent States ; and his reas­  
ons for perferring for the purpose a naval to a mili­  
tary force ; and moreover, his remark that it was  
not necessary to find a right to coerce in the Federal  
articles, that being inherent in the nature of a com­  
pact. It is high time that the claim-to secede at  
will should be put down by the public opinion, and  
Jam glad to see the task commenced by one who un­  
derstands the subject.  
1 know nothing of what is passing at Kichmond  
more than what is seen in the newspapers. You  
were right in your foresight of the effect of the pas­  
sages in the late proclamation. They have proven  
a leaven for much fermentation there and created an  
alarm against the danger of consolidation balancing  
that of disunion

Moxtfeuir, Deo. 23, 1832.  
Dear Sir: I have received yours of  
the 19th, inclosing some South Carolina  
papers. There is in one of them some  
interesting views of the doctrine ef seces  
sion, among which, one that had occur­  
red to me. and which for the first time I  
have seen in print; namely, that if one  
8tate can at all withdraw from the others,  
the others can withdraw from her, and  
tnrn her, noltntem voltnltm, out of the  
Union. Until of late there is not a State  
that wonld have abhorred such a doctrine  
more then Sonth Carolina, or more dread  
ed an application of it to herself. The  
same may be said of the doctrine of nul  
lification, which she now preaches as the  
only doctrine by which the Union can be  
saved.  
I partake of the wonder that the men  
you name should view secession in the  
light mentioned. The essential difference  
between a free government, and govern  
ments not free, is, that the former is  
founded in compact, the parties to which  
are mutually and equally bound by it.  
Neither of. them, therefore, can have a  
greater right to break off from the bar­  
gain than the others have to hold him to  
it. And certainly there is nothing in the  
Virginia resolutions of &#x27;98 adverse to  
this principle, which is that of common  
sense and common justice. The fallacy,  
which draw, a different conclnsion from  
them, lies in confounding a single party,  
with the parties to the constitutional com­  
pact of the United States. The latter  
having made a compact, may do what  
they will with it. The former, as one of  
the parties, owes fidelity to it till released  
by consent, or absolved by an intolerable  
abuse of the power created. In the Vir­  
ginia resolutions and report, the plural  
number (State.) is in every instance rued,  
whenever reference is made to the author­  
ity which presided over the government  
As I am now known to have drawn those  
documents, I may say, as I do with a  
distinct recollection; that it was intention­  
al. It was in fact reqaired by the course  
of reasoning employed on the occasion.  
The Kentucky resolutions, being less  
guarded, have been&#x27;more easily perverted.  
The pretext for the liberty taken with  
these of Virginia, is the word &quot;respect­  
ive&quot;prefixed to the &quot;right, dee.,&quot; to be  
secured -within the States. Conld the  
abuse of the expression bava been fore­  
seen or sispected, the fornj of it wonld  
doubtless have been varied. But what  
ran be more consistent with common  
sense, than all having the rights, 4c,  
should unite in contending for the secu­  
rity of them to each ?  
It is remarkable how closely the nulli  
fies, who make the name of Mr. Jefferson  
the pedestal for their colossal aeresy, shnt  
their eyes and lips whenever bis authority  
  
is ever so clearly and emphatically against  
them. Yon have noticed (1) what he  
says in his letters to Monroe and Carring­  
ton (p. 43&#x27;and 202, vol. 2d) with respect  
to the power of the old Congress to co­  
erce delinquent States; and his reasons  
for preferring for the purpose a naval to  
a military force; and-moreover, his re­  
mark that it was not necessary to find a  
right to coerce in the federal articles, that  
being inherent in the nature of a compact.  
It is high time that the claim to secede  
at will should be pat down by the pub­  
lic opinion, and I am glad to see the task  
commenced by one who nnderstsnds the  
.ubject (2). l  
1 know nothing of what is passing at  
Richmond, more than what is seen in the  
newspapers. You were right in your  
foresight of the effect of passages in the  
late proclamation. They have proved a  
leaven for much fermentation there, and  
  
created an alarm against the danger of  
consolidation balancing that of disunion.  
I wish with you the Legislature may not  
seriously injure itself by assuming the  
high character of mediator. They will  
certainly do so, if they forget that their  
real influence will be in the inverse ratio  
of a boastful incorporation of it.  
If you can fix and will namo the day  
of your arrival at Orange court house,  
we will have a horse there for you; snd  
if yon have1 more baggage than can be  
otherwise brought than on wheels, we  
will send a vehicle for it. Such is the  
state of the roads, produced by the wag­  
ons hurrying flour to market, that it may  
be impossible to send our carriage, which  
would answer both purposes.  
With cordial salutations,

Montpelier. Dec. 23. 1^32.  
“ Dear Sir: I have received yours of the 19lh.  
inclosing some South Carolina papers. There are  
in one “f them some interesting views of the doc­  
trine of secession. among which ono that had oc­  
curred to me, and which for the first time I have  
seen in print, namely : that if oue State can at will  
withdraw from the others, the others can withdraw  
from hnr. and turn her, nolentem voientem, out of  
the l&#x27;ni«n.  
*• Until f late there is not a State that would  
have abhorred such a doctrine more than South  
Carolina, or more dreaded an application of it t»  
herself. The same may be said ot the doctrine of  
nullification, which she now preaches as toe only  
doctrine by whi.-b the Union can b»* saved.  
1 partake cf the wonder that the men yon name  
should view secession in the light mentioned. The  
essential difference between a free Government and  
1 Government not free is. that the former is found­  
ed in compact, the parties to which are mutually  
and equally bound by it. Neither of then, there­  
fore. can have s gi eater to break off from the  
bargain than the other or others have to hold him  
t «it : and cert unly there is nothing in the Virginia  
ot 17:*&quot; adverse to this principle, which  
is that of common sense and common justice.  
•• The fallacy which draws a different conclusion  
from them lies iu confounding a single party with  
the parlies to the constitutional compact of the U.  
Sttaes. The latter, having made the compact. may  
do what they will with it. The former, as oue of th e  
parties, owes fidelity to it till released by c msent or  
absolved by an intolerable abuse of the power  
created. In the Virginia resolutions and report the  
plural number (States) is in every instance used  
whenever reference is made to the authority which  
presided over the Government.  
•• As I am now known to have drawn those docu­  
ment*. I may say. as 1 do with a distinct recollec­  
tion, that it was intentional. • It was in fact requir­  
ed by the course of reasoning employed on the oc­  
casion. The Kentucky resolutions, being less  
guarded, have been more easily perverted. The  
pretext for the liberty takeu with those of Virginia  
is the word * respective&#x27; prefixed to the • rights.  
Ac/&#x27; to be secured within the States. Could the  
abuse of the expression have been foreseen or sus­  
pected. the form ot it would doubtless have been  
varied. But what can be more consistent with  
common sense than that all having the rights. Ac.,  
should unite in contending tor the security ot them  
to each?  
•* It is remarkable how closely the nullificrs. who  
make the name of Mr. Jefferson the pedestal for  
their colossal heresy, shut their eyes and lips when­  
ever his authority is ever so clearly and emphati­  
cally against them. You have noticed what he  
says in his letters to Monroe and Carrington (pp.  
43* and 203. vol. 2) with respect to the power of the  
old Congress to coerce delinquent Slates ; and his  
reason for preferring for the purpose a naval to a  
military toree ; and. moreover, his remark that it  
was not necessary to find a right to coerce in the  
Federal articles, that Wing inherent in the nature  
of a compact. It &gt;.&lt; high time that the claim to se­  
cede at wiii should be put down by the public opin­  
ion. and 1 am glad to see the task commenced by  
one who understands the subject.  
•* 1 know nothing of what is passing at Rich­  
mond more than what is seen in the newspapers.  
You were right in your foresight of the effect of  
passages in the late proclamation. They have  
proven a leaven for much fermentation there, and  
created an alarm against the danger of consocia­  
tion balancing that of disunion.
