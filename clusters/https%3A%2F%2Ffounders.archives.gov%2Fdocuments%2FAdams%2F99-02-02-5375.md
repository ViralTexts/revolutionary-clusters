IN page 20, Mr. Hamilton says, my &quot;conduct in the  
office of President was a heterogeneous compound of right  
and wrong, of wisdom and error.&quot; As at that time, in  
my opinion, his principal rule of right and wrong, of  
wisdom and error, was his own ambition and indelicate  
pleasures, I despise his censure, and should consider his  
approbation as a satire on my administration.“The outset,&quot; he says, &quot;was distinguished by a speech  
which his friends lamented as temporizing. It had the  
air of a lure for the favor of his opponents at the expense  
of his sincerity.&quot; Until I read this, I never heard one objection to that speech, and I have never heard another since,  
except in a letter from a lady, who said she did not like  
it, because there was but one period in it, and that period  
was too long. I fully agreed to that lady’s opinion, and  
now thank her for her criticism. Since that time I have  
never heard nor read, except in Wood’s History, any objection or criticism.That address was dictated by the same spirit which produced my conference the next day with Mr. Jefferson, in which I proposed to him the idea of sending him to France,  
and the more serious thought of nominating Mr. Madison.  
It sprung from a very serious apprehension of danger to  
our country, and a sense of injustice to individuals, from  
that arbitrary and exclusive principle of faction which  
confines all employments and promotions to its own favorites. There is a distinction founded in truth and nature, between party and faction. The former is founded  
in principle and system, concerning the public good; the  
latter in private interest and passions. An honest party  
man will never exclude talents and virtues, and qualities  
eminently useful to the public, merely on account of a  
difference in opinion. A factious man will exclude every  
man alike, saint or sinner, who will not be a blind, passive tool. If I had been allowed to follow my own ideas,  
Hamilton and Burr, in my opinion, with submission to  
Divine Providence, would have been alive at this hour—General Muhlenburg, of Pennsylvania, would have been  
a Brigadier, under Hamilton, in the army, as long as it  
lasted; and the great body of Germans in Pennsylvania,  
instead of being disgraced with imputations of rebellion,  
would have been good friends of government. I have  
not room to develope all this at present.But I soon found myself shackled. The heads of departments were exclusive patriots. I could not name a  
man who was not devoted to Hamilton, without kindling  
a fire.The Senate was now decidedly federal. During President Washington’s whole administration of eight years,  
his authority in the Senate was extremely weak. The  
Senate was equally divided in all great constitutional  
questions, and in all great questions of foreign relations,  
and such as were the most sharply contested were brought  
to my decision as Vice-President.When I was elected, the States had been pleased to make  
an entire change in the Senate. Two thirds of that honorable body were now decidedly federal. And prosperity  
had its usual effect, on federal minds. It made them confident and presumptuous. I soon found, that if I had not the previous consent of the heads of departments, and  
the approbation of Mr. Hamilton, I run the utmost risque  
of a dead negative in the Senate. One such negative  
at least I had, after a very formal and a very uncivil remonstrance of one of their large, unconstitutional committees in secret.I have great reason to believe, that Mr. Jefferson came  
into office with the same spirit that I did—that is, with a  
sincere desire of conciliating parties, as far as he possibly  
could, consistently with his principles. But he soon  
found, as I did, that the Senate had a decided majority  
of republicans, five or six to one, a much greater majority than there was in my time, of federalists, which  
were never more than two to one.In the House of Representatives, in Mr. Washington’s  
time, the majority of federalists was very small. In my  
time, it was somewhat larger, but still small. In Mr.  
Jefferson’s time, the majority of republicans was immense,  
two or three, or four, to one. Consciousness of this  
strength had the same effect upon republicans as it had  
upon federalists in my time. It made them confident,  
exclusive, and presumptuous. Mr. Jefferson found it impossible, as I did, to follow his own inclination on many  
occasions.It may be thought presumption in me to impute errors  
to the nation; but as I have never concealed from the  
people any truth which it was important to them to know,  
nor any opinion of my own, which was material in public  
affairs, I hope to be excused if I suggest that the general  
sentiment in most parts of the continent, that all the danger to liberty arises from the executive power, and that  
the President’s office cannot be too much restrained, is an  
error.Corruption in almost all free governments has begun  
and been first introduced in the Legislature. When any  
portion of executive power has been lodged in popular or  
aristocratical assemblies, it has seldom, if ever, failed to  
introduce intrigue.—The executive powers lodged in the  
Senate are the most dangerous to the constitution and to liberty of all the powers in it. The people then ought to  
consider the President’s office as the indispensible guardian of their rights. I have ever, therefore, been of opinion, that the electors of President ought to be chosen by  
the people at large. The people cannot be too careful in  
the choice of their Presidents; but when they have chosen them, they ought to expect that they will act their  
own independent judgments, and not be wheedled nor  
intimidated by factious combinations of Senators, Representatives, heads of departments, or military officers.The exclusive principle which has been adopted, and  
too openly avowed by both our great divisions, when the  
pendulum has swung to their side, is a principle of faction,  
and not of honest party. It is intolerance! It is despotism! It destroys the freedom of the press! The freedom  
of elections! the freedom of debate! the freedom of deliberation! the freedom of private judgment! And as  
long as the Senate shall be determined to negative all but  
their own party, the President can have no will or judgment of his own. I most earnestly entreat all parties to  
reconsider their resolutions on this subject.

1N page 25, Mr. Himilton Tayt,  
my * condu&amp; s the office of Presidents  
was a heterogenious compotad of  
right &amp; wrong, of wisdom and error.”  
‘As at that time, in my opinion, his  
principal rale of right and wrong, ‘of

bition, and indelicate pleafiires, I def

idea of tending him to France, and the

It may be thougnt presumption in me to impute  
errors to the nation; but I hope to be excused if I sug­  
gest, as I have never concealed from the people any  
truth which it was important for them to know, that  
the general sentiment in most parts of the continent  
that all the danger to liberty arises from the execu­  
tive power, and that the President&#x27;s office cannot be  
too much restrained, is an error. Corruption in al­  
most all free governments has begun and been first  
introduced in the Legislature. When any portion of  
executive power has been lodged in popular or  
aristocratical assemblies, it has seldom, if ever,  
failed to introduce intrigue. The executive powers  
lodged in the Senate are the most dangerous to the  
Constitution, and to liberty of all the powers in it.  
The people, then, ought to consider the President&#x27;s  
office as the indispensable guardian of their rights  
The people cannot be too careful in the choice of  
their Presidents, but when they have chosen them  
they ought to expect that they will act their own in­  
dependent judgments, and not be wheelded or intimi­  
dated by factious combinations of Senators, Repre­  
sentatives, heads of Departments, or military officers  
The exclusive principle which has been adopted,  
and toe openly avowed by both oue great divisions,  
when the pendulum has swung to their side, is a  
principle of faction, and not of honest party. It is  
intolerance. It is depotisin! It destroys the free­  
dom of the press! the freedom of election! the  
freedom of debate! the freedom of deliberation!  
the freedom of private judgment! And as long a  
the Senate shall be determined to negative all but  
their own party the President can have no will or  
judgment of his own. I most earnestly entreat all  
parties to reconsider their resolutions on this sub­  
lect. The same article adams thus leunes the atmer­  
ence between party and faction:  
There is a distinction founded in truth and nature  
between party and faction. The former is founded  
in principle and and system, concerning the public  
good; the latter in private interest and passion. An  
honest party man will never exclude talents and  
virtues and qualities eminently useful to the public  
merely on account of a difference in opinion. A  
factious man will exclude every man alike, saint or  
sinner, who will not be a blind, passive tool.  
In 1808, in reviewing certain amendments pro­  
posed by Senator Hillhouse to the United States  
Constitution, one of which made appointments t
