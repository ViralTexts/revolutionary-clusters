[25 January 1788]  
A Fifth class of provisions in favor of the federal authority, consists of the following restrictions on the authority of the several states.  
1. “No state shall enter into any treaty, alliance or confederation, grant letters of marque and reprisal, coin money, emit bills of credit, make any

pass any bill of attainder, ex post facto law, or law impairing the obligation of contracts, or grant any title of nobility.”  
The prohibition against treaties, alliances and confederations, makes a part of the existing articles of union; and for reasons which need no explanation, is copied into the new constitution. The prohibition of letters of marque is another part of the old system, but is somewhat extended in the new. According to the former, letters of marque could be granted by the states, after a declaration of war. According to the latter, these licences must be obtained as well during war as previous to its declaration, from the government of the United States. This alteration is fully justified by the advantage of uniformity in all points which relate to foreign powers; and of immediate responsibility to the nation in all those, for whose conduct the nation itself is to be responsible.  
The right of coining money, which is here taken from the states, was left in their hands by the confederation as a concurrent right with that of congress, under an exception in favor of the exclusive right of congress to regulate the alloy and value. In this instance also the new provision is an improvement on the old. Whilst the alloy and value depended on the general authority, a right of coinage in the particular states could have no other effect than to multiply expensive mints, and diversify the forms and weights of the circulating pieces. The latter inconveniency defeats one purpose for which the power was originally submitted to the federal head. And as far as the former might prevent an inconvenient remittance of gold and silver to the central mint for recoinage, the end can be as well attained by local mints established under the general authority.  
The extension of the prohibition to bills of credit must give pleasure to every citizen in proportion to his love of justice, and his knowledge of the true springs of public prosperity. The loss which America has sustained since the peace, from the pestilent effects of paper money, on the necessary confidence between man and man; on the necessary confidence in the public councils; on the industry and morals of the people, and on the character of republican government, constitutes an enormous debt against the states chargeable with this unadvised measure, which must long remain unsatisfied; or rather an accumulation of guilt, which can be expiated no otherwise than by a voluntary sacrifice on the altar of justice, of the power which has been the instrument of it. In addition to these persuasive considerations, it may be observed that the same reasons which shew the necessity of denying to the states the power of regulating coin, prove with equal force that they ought not to be at liberty to substitute a paper medium in the place of coin. Had every state a right to regulate the value of its coin, there might be as many different currencies as states; and thus the intercourse among them would be impeded; retrospective alterations in its value might be made, and thus the citizens of other states be injured, and animosities be kindled among the states themselves. The subjects of foreign powers might suffer from the same cause, and hence the union be discredited and embroiled by the indiscretion of a single member. No one of these mischiefs is less incident to a power in the states to emit paper money, than to coin gold or silver. The power to make any thing but gold and silver a tender in payment of debts, is withdrawn from the states, on the same principle with that of striking of paper currency.  
Bills of attainder, ex post facto laws, and laws impairing the obligation of contracts, are contrary to the first principles of the social compact, and to every principle of sound legislation. The two former are expressly prohibited by the declarations prefixed to some of the state constitutions, and all of them are prohibited by the spirit and scope of these fundamental charters. Our own experience has taught us nevertheless, that additional fences against these dangers ought not to be omitted. Very properly therefore have the convention added this constitutional bulwark in favor of personal security and private rights; and I am much deceived if they have not in so doing as faithfully consulted the genuine sentiments, as the undoubted interests of their constituents. The sober people of America are weary of the fluctuating policy which has directed the public councils. They have seen with regret and with indignation, that sudden changes and legislative interferences in cases affecting personal rights, become jobs in the hands of enterprizing and influential speculators; and snares to the more industrious and less informed part of the community. They have seen too, that one legislative interference is but the first link of a long chain of repetitions; every subsequent interference being naturally produced by the effects of the preceding. They very rightly infer, therefore, that some thorough reform is wanting which will banish speculations on public measures, inspire a general prudence and industry, and give a regular course to the business of society. The prohibition with respect to titles of nobility, is copied from the articles of confederation and needs no comment.  
2. “No state shall, without the consent of the congress, lay any imposts or duties on imports or exports, except what may be absolutely necessary for executing its inspection laws, and the neat produce of all duties and imposts laid by any state on imports or exports, shall be for the use of the treasury of the United States; and all such laws shall be subject to the revision and controul of the congress. No state shall, without the consent of congress, lay any duty on tonnage, keep troops or ships of war in time of peace; enter into any agreement or compact with another state, or with a foreign power, or engage in war, unless actually invaded, or in such imminent danger as will not admit of delay.”  
The restraint on the power of the states over imports and exports is enforced by all the arguments which prove the necessity of submitting the regulation of trade to the federal councils. It is needless therefore to remark further on this head, than that the manner in which the restraint is qualified, seems well calculated at once to secure to the states a reasonable discretion in providing for the conveniency of their imports and exports, and to the United States a reasonable check against the abuse of this discretion. The remaining particulars of this clause, fall within reasonings which are either so obvious, or have been so fully developed, that they may be passed over without remark.  
The sixth and last class consists of the several powers and provisions by which efficacy is given to all the rest.

ution the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by this constitution in the government of the United States.”  
Few parts of the constitution have been assailed with more intemperance than this; yet on a fair investigation of it, as has been elsewhere shewn, no part can appear more completely invulnerable. Without the substance of this power, the whole constitution would be a dead letter. Those who object to the article therefore as a part of the constitution, can only mean that the form of the provision is improper. But have they considered whether a better form could have been substituted?  
There are four other possible methods which the convention might have taken on this subject. They might have copied the second article of the existing confederation which would have prohibited the exercise of any power not expressly delegated; they might have attempted a positive enumeration of the powers comprehended under the general terms “necessary and proper”; they might have attempted a negative enumeration of them, by specifying the powers excepted from the general definition: They might have been altogether silent on the subject; leaving these necessary and proper powers, to construction and inference.  
Had the convention taken the first method of adopting the second article of confederation; it is evident that the new congress would be continually exposed as their predecessors have been, to the alternative of construing the term “expressly” with so much rigour as to disarm the government of all real authority whatever, or with so much latitude as to destroy altogether the force of the restriction. It would be easy to shew if it were necessary, that no important power, delegated by the articles of confederation, has been or can be executed by congress, without recurring more or less to the doctrine of construction or implication. As the powers delegated under the new system are more extensive, the government which is to administer it would find itself still more distressed with the alternative of betraying the public interest by doing nothing; or of violating the constitution by exercising powers indispensably necessary and proper; but at the same time, not expressly granted.  
Had the convention attempted a positive enumeration of the powers necessary and proper for carrying their other powers into effect; the attempt would have involved a compleat digest of laws on every subject to which the constitution relates; accommodated too not only to the existing state of things, but to all the possible changes which futurity may produce: For in every new application of a general power, the particular powers, which are the means of attaining the object of the general power, must always necessarily vary with that object; and be often properly varied whilst the object remains the same.  
Had they attempted to enumerate the particular powers or means, not necessary or proper for carrying the general powers into execution, the task would have been no less chimerical; and would have been liable to this further objection; that every defect in the enumeration, would have been equivalent to a positive grant of authority. If to avoid this consequence they had attempted a partial enumeration of the exceptions and described the residue by the general terms, not necessary or proper: It must have happened that the enumeration would comprehend a few of the excepted powers only; that these would be such as would be least likely to be assumed or tolerated because the enumeration would of course select such as would be least necessary or proper, and that the unnecessary and improper powers included in the residuum, would be less forcibly excepted, than if no partial enumeration had been made.  
Had the constitution been silent on this head, there can be no doubt that all the particular powers, requisite as means of executing the general powers, would have resulted to the government, by unavoidable implication. No axiom is more clearly established in law, or in reason, than that wherever the end is required, the means are authorised; wherever a general power to do a thing is given, every particular power necessary for doing it, is included. Had this last method therefore been pursued by the convention, every objection now urged against their plan, would remain in all its plausibility; and the real inconveniency would be incurred, of not removing a pretext which may be seized on critical occasions for drawing into question the essential powers of the union.  
If it be asked, what is to be the consequence, in case the congress shall misconstrue this part of the constitution, and exercise powers not warranted by its true meaning? I answer the same as if they should misconstrue or enlarge any other power vested in them, as if the general power had been reduced to particulars, and any one of these were to be violated; the same in short, as if the state legislatures should violate their respective constitutional authorities. In the first instance, the success of the usurpation will depend on the executive and judiciary departments, which are to expound and give effect to the legislative acts; and in the last resort, a remedy must be obtained from the people, who can by the election of more faithful representatives, annul the acts of the usurpers. The truth is, that this ultimate redress may be more confided in against unconstitutional acts of the federal than of the state legislatures, for this plain reason, that as every such act of the former, will be an invasion of the rights of the latter, these will be ever ready to mark the innovation, to sound the alarm to the people, and to exert their local influence in effecting a change of federal representatives. There being no such intermediate body between the state legislatures and the people, interested in watching the conduct of the former, violations of the state constitution are more likely to remain unnoticed and unredressed.

 the supreme law of the land, and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.”  
  
The indiscreet zeal of the adversaries to the constitution, has betrayed them into an attack on this part of it also, without which it would have been evidently and radically defective. To be fully sensible of this we need only suppose for a moment, that the supremacy of the state constitutions had been left compleat by a saving clause in their favor.  
In the first place, as these constitutions invest the state legislatures with absolute sovereignty, in all cases not excepted by the existing articles of confederation, all the authorities contained in the proposed constitution, so far as they exceed those enumerated in the confederat

n the proposed constitution.  
In the third place, as the constitutions of the states differ much from each other, it might happen that a treaty or national law of great and equal importance to the states, would interfere with some and not with other constitutions, and would consequently be valid in some of the states at the same time that it would have no effect in others.  
In fine, the world would have seen for the first time, a system of government founded on an inversion of the fundamental principles of all government; it would have seen the authority of the whole society every where subordinate to the authority of the parts; it would have seen a monster in which the head was under the direction of the members.

xamination in another place, I pass them over in this.  
We have now reviewed in detail all the articles composing the sum or quantity of power delegated by the proposed constitution to the federal government; and are brought to this undeniable conclusion, that no part of the power is unnecessary or improper for accomplishing the necessary objects of the union. The question therefore, whether this amount of power shall be granted or not, resolves itself into another question, whether or not a government commensurate to the exigencies of the union, shall be established; or in other words, whether the union itself shall be preserved

observed that the same reasons which  
show the necessity of denying to thestaics  
the power ofregulnting coin prove with  
equal force that they ought not to he at  
liberty to substitute a paper medium in  
the place of coin. Had every state the  
right to regulate the value of its coin,  
there might be as many different cur­  
rencies as states, and tints the intercourse  
among them would he impeded; re­  
trospective alterations in its value mi^iit  
be made, and thus the citizens of other  
states be injured, and animosities be  
kindled among the states themselves.—  
The subjects of foreign powers might

the union be discredited and embroih ,  
by the indiscretion of a single member.  
No one of these mischiefs is less incident  
to a power in the states to emit paper  
money than to coin gold and silver. The  
power to make any thing but gold and  
silver a tender in the payment of debts,  
is withdrawn from the states, on the same  
principle with that ol striking of paper  
currency.” If this great constitutional  
lawyer has correctly delineated the rea­

these laws. And would they not naturally and necessarily  
conclude, the denunciations were equally just as regarded  
laws passed to impair the obligation of existing contracts,  
for the same reason ?  
  
The writer proceeds: “‘ Our own experience has taught  
us, nevertheless, that additional fences against these dangers  
ought not to be omitted. Very properly, therefore, have  
the Convention added this constitutional bulwark in favour  
of personal security and private rights; and | am much

that sudden changes, and legislative interferences, in cases  
affecting personal rights, become jobs in the hands of en-  
terprising and influential speculators ; and snares to the more  
industrious and less informed part of the community. They  
have seen, too, that one legislative interference is but the  
link of a long chain of repetitions; every subsequent inter-  
ference being naturally produced by the effects of the pre-  
ceding. They very rightly infer, therefore, that some tho-

We readily agree with the writers of the “ Federalist,’ that  
‘‘no important power can be executed by Congress, without  
recurring more or less to the doctrine of construction or impli-  
cation.””’ The power granted must be carried into effect by  
means subordinate, and calculated to carry the granted powe!

“Had the Convention attempted a positive enumeration of the powers  
necessary and proper, for carrying their other powers into effect, the  
attempt would have involved a complete digest of laws on every subject  
to which the Constitution relates; accommodated too, not only to the  
| and existing state of things, but to all the possible changes which futurity  
  
| may produce.”  
ier “Had they attempted to enumerate the particular power or means,  
ape not necessary or proper for carrying the general powers into execution,  
hin on the task would have been no less chimerical ; and would have been  
liable to this further objection, that every defect in the enumeration

the power of the States over imports and exports is enfore-  
ed by all the arguments which prove the necessity of sub-  
mitting the regulations of trade to the federal councils. It  
iz needless, therefore, to remark further on this head, than  
that the manner in which the restraint is qualified seems  
well ealeulated, at once, to secure to the States a reasona-

might, by convention or otherwise, separately  
nullify the proceeding or act of Congress  
&quot; If it be asked, what is to be tho conse­  
quence, in case the congress shall misconstrue  
this part of the constitution, and exercise powers  
not warranted by its true meaning, I answer the  
same as if they should misconstrue or enlarge  
any other power vested in them; as if the gene­  
ral power had been reduced to particulars, and  
any one of these were to be violated, the same,  
in short, as if the state legislatures should vio­  
late their respective constitutional authorities.  
In the first instance, the success of the usurpa­  
tion will depend on tho executive and judiciary  
departments, which arc to expound and give  
effect to legislative acts ; and in the last resort,  
a remedy must be obtained from the people, who  
can by the election of more faithful representa­  
tives, annul the acts of tho usurpers. The truth  
is, that this ultimate redress may be more con­  
fided in against unconstitutional acts of the fede­  
ral, than of the state legislatures, for this plain  
reason, that as every such act of the former will  
be an invasion of the rights of the latter, these  
will be ever ready to mark tho innovation ; to  
sound tho alarm to the people, and to exert  
their local influence in effecting a chargo of fede­  
ral representatives. There being no such in­  
termediate body between the state legislatures  
and the people, interested in watching the con­  
duct of the former, violations of the state con­  
stitution are more likely to remain unnoticed  
and unredressed.

tween government and individuals, for  
  
the ordinary purposes of society.  
The evil to be remedied in the prohi  
  
bition to the states to &quot;emit bills of  
  
credit,&quot; is most forcibly vindicated in the  
following strong language of 44th No.  
of the Federalist written by James Mad­  
ison, and sanctioned by Hamilton and  
Jay, as well as by the people.  
&quot;This prohibition says that celebrated  
state paper &quot;must give pleasure to eve­  
ry citizen in proportion to his love  
of justice, and his knowledge of the true  
springs of public prosperity.  
&quot;The loss which Amerca has sustain­  
ed since the peace, from the pestilent ef­  
fects of paper money on the necessary  
confidence between man and man; on  
on the necessary confidence in the pub­  
lic councils; on the industry and mor  
  
als of the people, and on the character  
of republican goverement, constitutes  
an enormous debt against the States,  
chargeable with this unadvised measure,  
e a  
  
which must long remain unsatisfied; or  
  
rather, an accumulation of guilt, which  
can be expiated no otherwise than by a  
  
voluntary sacrifice on the altar of justice  
  
of the power which has been the instru  
ment of it. In eddition to these per  
suasive considerations, it may be obser  
  
ved, that the same reasons which show  
the neceslity of denying to the States the  
  
regulation of coin, prove with equal  
force, that they ought not to be at liber.

 alterations in its value might be made,  
 and thus the citizens of other States be  
  
 injured, and animosities kindled amon

p2ta foreign powers might suffer from the same  
  
o cause, and hence the union be discred

 of a single member. No one of these  
 mischiefs is less incident to a power in

The spirit as well as the letter of the instrument was transcended  
when these governments, the principal one without a single sen-  
tence to warrant it, and the subordinate ones under direct and  
positive prohibition, chartered banks with the privilege of  
issuing bills or notes payable in money on demand. There can  
be no question that such things are mischievous within the intent  
and meaning of the inhibitory words used, and are truly bills of  
credit. The Federalist certainly is good authority on this  
point : one of its writers has justly said -—This prohibition must  
give pleasure to every citizen in proportion to his love of justice  
and the knowledge of the true springs of public prosperity.  
The loss which America has sustained since the peace from the  
pestilent effects of paper money on the necessary confidence  
between man and man ; on the necessary confidence in the pub-  
lic councils ; on the industry and morals of the people, and on  
the character of republican g vovernment, constitutes an enormous  
debt against the States charge able with this unadvised measure,  
  
which must long remain unsatistied ; or rather an accumulation  
of guilt, which can be expiated no otherwise than by a volun-  
tary sacrifice on the altar of justice of the power which has been  
the instrument of it. In addition to these persuasive considera-  
tions, it may be observed, that the same reasons which show the  
necessity of denying to the States the power of Ae ating coin,  
  
proved with equal force, that they ought not to be at liberty to

substitute a paper medium instead of coin. Had every State a  
right to regulate the value of its coin, there might be as many  
different currencies as States; and thus the intercourse among  
them would be impeded. Retrospective alterations in its value  
might be made, and thus the citizens of other states be injured,  
and animosities be kindled among the States themselves. The

and hence the Union be discredited and embroiled by the indis-

incident to a power in the States to emit paper money, than to  
coin gold or silver. These sayings and sentiments have been  
verified by what has since been seen and ¢ xperienced in these  
governments. Here at home the American people have suffered  
in their business relations from the very causes thus pointed out.  
The writer, conceiving it impossible for the former state of  
things to be re-enacted, since the Constitution had interposed

Madison says:  
&quot;This prohibition must give pleasure to every  
citizen, in proportion to his love of justice, and  
knowledge of the true springs of public prosperity.  
The loss which America has sustained since the  
peace from the pestilent effects of paper money on  
the necessary confidence between man and man; on  
  
 the industry and morals of the people; and on the  
  
the necessary conndence in te puobe counelle a  
character of Republican Government, constitute an  
enormous debt against the States, chargeable  
this unadvised measure, which must long remain  
unsatisfied; or rather, an accumulation of guilt,  
which can be expiated no otherwise than by a vol  
untary sacrifice on the altar of justice of the power  
which has been the instrument of it. In addition  
to these persuasive considerations, it may be oh­  
served, that the same reasons, which show the neces  
sity of denying to the States the power of regulat­  
ing coin, prove with equal force that they ought not  
to be at liberty to substitute a paper medium in­  
stead of coin. Had every State a right to regulate  
the value of its coin, there might be as many curren­  
cies as States; and thus the intercourse among them  
would be impeded. Retrospective alterations in its  
value might be made; and thus the citizens of other  
States be injured, and animosities be kindled among  
the States themselves. The subject of foreign  
Powers might suffer from the same cause; and hence  
the Union be discredited, and embroiled by the in­  
discretion of a single member. No one of these  
mischiefs is less incident to a power in the States to  
emit paper money, than to coin gold or silver.

trial by jury in criminal cases, all secure personal rights to  
everybody. The same is true of the clause in favor of the

to see plainly that, if the Convention. that framed   
the Constitution had adopted the second article of   
the Confederation, and had incorporated that in­  
cendiary word &quot;expressly,&quot; &quot;Congress would be   
continually exposed, as their predecessors had been,   
to the alternative of construing that word &#x27; ex­  
pressly&#x27; with so much rigor as to disarm the Go­  
vernment of all real authority whatever. It would   
be easy to show that no important power delegated.   
has been, or can be executed by Congress; without   
recurring more or less to the doctrine of construc­

Such are the Words of Mr. Madison, who further   
argues, that, if this word &quot;expressly&quot; had been   
incorporated into the Constitution, &quot;it would have   
furnished a pretext which might be seized on in   
critical occasions for. drawing into question the

become jobs in the hands of enterprising and influen-­  
tial speculators, and snares to the more industrious

They have seen, too, that one legislative  
interference is but the first link of a long chain of  
repetitions; every subsequent interference being  
naturally produced by the effects of the preceding.&quot;  
These facts, he states, suggested a &quot;thorough reform

inspire a general prudence and industry, and give a  
regular course to the business of society.&quot; What was

ison observes: &quot;If it be asked, what is to be the  
consequence, in case the Congress shall misconstrue  
this part of the Constitution, and exercise powers  
not warranted by its frue meaning, I answer, The same  
as if they should misconstrue or enlarge any other  
power vested in them, as if the general powers had  
been reduced to particulars, and any of these were  
to be violated; the same, in short, as if the State  
legislatures should violate their respective constitu.­  
tional authorities. In the first instance (mark the  
erpression) in the first instance, the success of the  
usurpation will depend on the executive and iudi  
ciary departments, which are to exrouxd and give  
effect to the legislative acts; and in the last resort a  
remedy must be obtained from the people, who can.  
by the election of more faithful representatives, an

of gold and silver. The spirit as well as the lettes of the in-  
strument was transcended when these governments, the princi-  
pal without a single sentence to warrant it, and the subordi-  
nate ones under direct and positive prohibition, chartered banks  
with the privilege of issuing bills or notes payable in money on  
demand. There can be no question that such things are mis-  
chievous within the intent and meaning of the inhibitous  
works used, and are truly bills of credit. The Federalist is cer-  
tainly good authority on this point: one of its writers has justly  
said: This prohibition ‘* must give pleasure to every citizen in  
proportion to his love of justice, and the knowledge of the  
time springs of public prosperity. The loss which America  
has sustained since the peace, from the pestilential effects of  
paper money on the necessary confidence between man and  
man; on the necessary confidence in the public councils; on  
the industry and morals of the people, and on the character  
  
  
  
  
  
against the States chargeable with this unadvised measure,  
which must long remain unsatisfied; or rather, an accumula-  
tion guilt, which can be expiated no otherwise than by a vol-  
untary sacrifice on the altar of justice of the power which has  
been the instrument of it. In additien to these pursuasive  
considerations, it may be observed, that the same reasons  
which show the necessity of denying to the States the power of  
regulating coin, proved with equal force that they ought not to  
be at liberty to substitute a paper medium instead of coin. Had  
every State a right to regulate the value of its coin, there might  
be as many different currencies as States; and thus the inter-  
course among them would be impeded. Retrospective  
alterations in its value might be made. and thus  
the citizens of other States be injured and _ animosi-  
ties be kindled among the States themselves. The subjects of  
foreign powers might suffer from the same cause, and hence the  
union he discredited and embroiled by the indiscretion of a  
single member. No one of these mischiefs is less incident to a  
power in the States to emit paper money than to coin gold or  
silver.” ‘The saying and sentiments have been verified by what  
has since been heard and experienced in these governments.  
tlere at home the American people have suffered in their busi-  
ness Telations from the very causes thus pointed out.

ultsl, page 242, speaking of this article, said:  
&quot;Bills of attainder, ex post facto laws, and  
laws impairing the obligation of contructs, are  
contrary to the first principles of the social  
compact and to every principle of sound legis­  
lation. The two former are expressly pro­  
hibited by the declarations prefixed to some  
of the State Constitutions, and all of them are e  
orohibited by the spirit and scope of  
these fundumentul charters.&quot; Our own  
experience has taught us, nevertheless,  
that additional fences against these dangers  
ought not to be admitted. Very properly,  
therefore, have the convention added this  
constitutional bulwark in favor of personal  
securily and private rights, and I am much  
deceived if they have not in so doing as faithi  
fully consulted the genuine sentiments as theo  
bndoubted interests of their constituents.  
The sober people of America are weary of the  
fluctuating policy which has directed the  
publie counells. Thay have seon with rogre  
  
public counclls. They have seen with regret  
nd with indignation that sudden changes  
and legislative interferences in cases affecting  
personal rights become jobs in the hands of  
enterprising and influential speculators and  
snares to the more industrious and less in­  
formed part of the community. They have  
in that one legislative interference is but  
the first link of a long chain of repetitions,  
every subsequent interference being naturally  
produced by the effects of the preceding.  
They very rightfully infer, therefore, that  
some thorough reform is wanting which will  
banish speculations on public measures, in­  
spire a general prudence and industry, and give  
a regular course to the business of society.&quot;

The opinion of the court purports to provide means for the

“to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises,” and “ to
