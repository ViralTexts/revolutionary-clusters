Sir  
Philada. May 25. 1747  
In my last I informed you that In pursuing our Electrical Enquiries, we had observ’d some particular Phaenomena, which we lookt upon to be new, and of which I promised to give you some Account; tho’ I apprehended they might possibly not be new to you, as so many Hands are daily employed in Electrical Experiments on your Side the Water, some or other of which would probably hit on the same Observations.  
The first is the wonderful Effect of Points both in drawing off and throwing off the Electrical Fire. For Example,  
Place an Iron Shot of three or four Inches Diameter on the Mouth of a clean dry Glass Bottle. By a fine silken Thread from the Ceiling, right over the Mouth of the Bottle, suspend a small Cork Ball, about the Bigness of a Marble: the Thread of such a Length, as that the Cork Ball may rest against the Side of the Shot. Electrify the Shot, and the Ball will be repelled to the Distance of 4 or 5 Inches, more or less according to the Quantity of Electricity. When in this State, if you present to the Shot the Point of a long, slender, sharp Bodkin at 6 or 8 Inches Distance, the Repellency is instantly destroy’d, and the Cork flies to it. A blunt Body must be brought within an Inch, and draw a Spark to produce the same Effect. To prove that the Electrical Fire is drawn off by the Point: if you take the Blade of the Bodkin out of the wooden Handle, and fix it in a Stick of Sealing Wax, and then present it at the Distance aforesaid no such Effect follows; but slide one Finger along the Wax till you touch the Blade, and the Ball flies to the Shot immediately. If you present the Point in the Dark, you will see, sometimes at a Foot Distance and more, a Light gather upon it like that of a Fire-Fly or Glow-Worm; the less sharp the Point, the nearer you must bring it to observe this Light: and at whatever Distance you see the Light, you may draw off the Electrical Fire, and destroy the Repellency. If a Cork Ball, so suspended, be repelled by the Tube, and a Point be presented quick to it, tho’ at a considerable Distance, tis surprizing to see how suddenly it flies back to the Tube. Points of Wood do as well as those of Metal, provided the Wood is not dry.  
To shew that Points will throw off, as well as draw off the Electrical Fire: Lay a long sharp Needle upon the Shot, and you can not electrise the Shot, so as to make it repel the Cork Ball. Fix a Needle to the End of a suspended Gun Barrel, so as to point beyond it like a little Bayonet, and while it remains there, the Gun Barrel can not be electrised (by the Tube applied to the other End) so as to give a Spark; the Fire is continually running out silently at the Point. In the Dark you may see it make the same Appearance as it does in the Case before mentioned.  
The Repellency between the Cork Ball and Shot is likewise destroy’d; 1. By sifting fine Sand on it; this does it gradually: 2. By breathing on it: 3. By making a Smoke about it from burning Wood:  
  
*We suppose every Particle of Sand, moist Breath or Smoke, being first attracted and then repelled, carries off with it its Portion of the Electrical Fire, but that it still subsists in those Particles, till they communicate it to something else, and that it is never really destroyed. So when Water is thrown on common Fire, we do not imagine the Element is thereby destroy’d or annihilated, but only dispersed; each Particle of Water carrying off in Vapour its Portion of the Fire which it had attracted and attacht to itself.  
  
4. By Candle Light, even tho’ the Candle is at a Foot Distance: These do it suddenly. The Light of a bright Coal from a Wood Fire, and the Light of a red-hot Iron do it likewise; but not at so great a Distance. Smoke from dry Rosin dropt into a little hot Letter Founders Ladle under the Shot does not destroy the Repellency; but is attracted by both the Shot and the Cork-Ball, forming proportionable Atmospheres round them, making them look beautifully; somewhat like some of the Figures in Burnets or Whiston’s Theory of the Earth.  
N.B. This Experiment should be made [in a closet] where the Air is very still.  
The Light of the Sun thrown strongly on both Shot and Cork by a Looking Glass for a long Time together does not impair the Repellency in the least. This Difference between Fire Light and Sun Light is another Thing that seems new and extraordinary to us.  
We had for some Time been of Opinion, that the Electrical Fire was not created by Friction, but collected, being an Element diffused among, and attracted by other Matter, particularly by Water and Metals. We had even discovered and demonstrated its Afflux to the Electrical Sphere, as well as its Efflux, by Means of little light Wind-Mill Wheels made of stiff Paper Vanes, fixt obliquely, and turning freely on fine Wire Axes. Also by little Wheels of the same Matter, but formed like Water Wheels. Of the Disposition and Application of which Wheels, and the various Phaenomena resulting, I could, if I had Time, and it were necessary, fill you a Sheet.  
The Impossibility of Electrising one’s self (tho’ standing on Wax) by Rubbing the Tube and drawing the Fire from it: and the Manner of doing it by passing the Tube near a Person, or Thing standing on the Floor &amp;c. had also occurred to us some Months before Mr. Watsons ingenious Sequel came to hand; and these were some of the new Things I intended to have communicated to you: But now I need only mention some Particulars not hinted in that Piece, with our Reasonings thereon; tho’ perhaps the latter might well enough be spared.  
1. A Person standing on Wax and rubbing the Tube; and another Person on Wax drawing the Fire, they will both of them (provided they do not stand so as to touch one another) appear to be electrised to a Person standing on the Floor; that is, he will perceive a Spark on approaching each of them.  
  
2. But if the Persons standing on Wax touch one another during the exciting of the Tube, neither of them will appear to be electrised.  
3. If they touch one another after exciting the Tube, and drawing the Fire as aforesaid, there will be a stronger Spark between them than was between either of them and the Person on the Floor.  
4. After such strong Spark, neither of them discovers any Electricity.  
These Appearances we attempt to account for thus. We suppose as aforesaid, That Electrical Fire is a common Element, of which every one of the three Persons abovementioned has his equal Share before any Operation is begun with the Tube. A who stands on Wax, and rubs the Tube, collects the Electrical Fire from himself into the Glass; and his Communication with the common Stock being cut off by the Wax, his Body is not again immediately supply’d. B, who stands upon Wax likewise, passing his Knuckle along near the Tube, receives the Fire which was collected by the Glass from A; and his Communication with the common Stock being likewise cutt off, he retains the additional Quantity received. To C, standing on the Floor, both appear to be electrised; for he having only the middle Quantity of Electrical Fire receives a Spark on approaching B, who has an over-quantity, but gives one to A, who has an under-quantity. If A and B touch each other, the Spark between them is stronger, because the Difference between them is greater. After such Touch, there is no Spark between either of them and C; because the Electrical Fire in all is reduced to the original Equality. If they touch while Electrising, the Equality is never destroyed, the Fire only circulating. Hence have arisen some new Terms among us. We say B (and other Bodies alike circumstanced) are electrised positively; A negatively: Or rather B is electrised plus and A minus. And we daily in our Experiments electrise Bodies plus or minus as we think proper. These Terms we may use till your Philosophers give us better. To electrise plus or minus, no more needs to be known than this; that the Parts of the Tube or Sphere, that are rub’d, do, in the Instant of the Friction, attract the Electrical Fire, and therefore take it from the Thing rubbing: the same Parts immediately, as the Friction upon them ceases, are disposed to give the Fire they have received, to any Body that has less. Thus you may circulate it, as Mr. Watson has shewn; You may also accumulate or subtract it upon, or from any Body, as you connect it with the Rubber or with the Receiver; the Communication with the common Stock being cut off. We think that ingenious Gentleman was deceived, when he imagined (Page [64] of the Sequel) that the Electrical Fire came down the Wire from the Cieling to the Gun Barrel, thence to the Sphere and so electrised the Machine, the Man turning the Wheel &amp;c. We suppose it was driven off and not brought on thro’ that Wire; and that the Machine and Man &amp;c. were electrized minus, i.e. had less electrical Fire in them than Things in common.  
As the Vessel is just sailing, I can not give you so large an Account of American Electricity as I intended. I shall only mention a few Particulars more. We find granulated Lead better to fill the Vial with than Water, being easily warmed, and keeping the Vial warm and dry in damp Air. We fire Spirits with the Wire of the Phial. We light Candles just blown out, by drawing a Spark among the Smoke between the Wire and Snuffers. We represent Lightning, by passing the Wire, in the Dark, over a China Plate, that has gilt Flowers; or applying it to gilt Frames of Looking Glasses &amp;c. We electrise a Person 20 or more Times running, with the Touch of the Finger on the Wire, thus;  
  
*The person standing on wax, holding the electrised bottle, when you touch the Hook of the bottle and receive a Spark from it, is electrified minus; a Quantity of electrical fire going out of him into the Coating of the bottle, equal to the Quantity taken from the Hook: in this state a person on the Floor touching him, will give him the quantity he has lost.  
  
He stands on Wax; give him the electrised Bottle in his Hand; touch the Wire with your Finger, and then touch his Hand or Face, there are Sparks every Time. We encrease the Force of the electrical Kiss vastly, thus; Let A and B stand on Wax; give one of them the electrised Vial in Hand; let the other take hold of the Wire; there will be a small Spark; but when their Lips approach, they will be struck and shockt. The same, if C and D (standing also on Wax) and joyning Hands with A and B, salute or shake Hands. We suspend by a fine Silk Thread a Counterfeit Spider, made of a small Piece of burnt Cork, with Legs of Linen Thread, and a Grain or two of Lead stuck in to give him more Weight. Upon the Table, over which he hangs, we stick a Wire upright, as high as the Vial and Wire, 2 or 3 Inches from the Spider: then we animate him, by setting the electrified Vial, at the same Distance on the other Side of him: he will immediately fly to the Wire of the Vial, bend his Legs in touching it, then spring off and fly to the Wire in the Table; thence again to the Wire of the Vial; playing with his Legs against both in a very extraordinary Manner, appearing perfectly alive to Persons unacquainted. He will continue this Motion an Hour or more in dry Weather.  
We electrify upon Wax, in the Dark, a Book that has a double Line of Gold round upon the Covers, and then apply a Knuckle to the Gilding; the Fire appears every where upon the Gold like a Flash of Lightning; not upon the Leather; nor if you touch the Leather instead of the Gold. We rub our Tubes with Buck Skin, and observe always to keep the same Side to the Tube, and never to sully the Tube by Handling. Thus they work readily and easily without the least Fatigue, especially if kept in tight Pastboard Cases, lined with Flannel and fitting close to the Tube. This I mention, because the European Papers on Electricity frequently speak of rubbing the Tube as a fatiguing Exercise. Our Spheres are fixt on Iron Axels, which pass thro’ them. At one End of the Axis there is a small Handle with which we turn the Sphere like a common Grind-Stone. This we find very commode; as the Machine takes up but little Room, is portable, and may be enclosed in a tight Box, when not in Use. ’Tis true the Sphere does not turn so swift as when the great Wheel is used; but Swiftness we think of little Importance, since a few Turns will charge the Vial &amp;c. sufficiently.  
I must say no more of Electricity at

his equal ſhare, before any operation is begun with the  
Tube. A, who ſtands on wax and rubs the tube collects  
the electrical fire from himſelf into the glaſs ; and his com-  
munication with the common ſtock being cut-off by the  
wax, his body is not again immediately ſupplyd. B, (who  
ſtands on wax likewiſe) paſſing his knuckle along near the  
tube, receives the fire which was collected by the glaſs  
from A; and his communication with the common ſtock: |  
being likewiſe cut off, he retains the additional quantity =  
  
received. To C, ſtanding on the floor, both appear to  
  
be cleriſed: for he having only the mil quantity of  
electrical fire, receives a ſpark upon approaching B, who  
has an over quantity; but Seen who has an un-  
der quantity. If A and B approach to touch each other,  
the ſpark is ſtronger, becauſe the difference between them  
is greater; after ſuch touch there is no ſpark between ei-  
  
ther of them and C, becauſe the electrical fire in all is re-  
duced to the original equality. If they touch while elec-  
triſing, the equality is never deſtroy d, the fire only circu-  
lating. Hence have ariſen ſome new terms among us:  
we ſay, B, (and bodies like circumſtanced) is electriſed  
  
  
A, minus. And we daily in our experiments electriſe  
bodies plus or minus as we think proper. To electriſe  
  
  
inſtant of the friction attract the electrical fire, and there-  
fore take it from the thing rubbing : the ſame parts imme-  
diately, as the friction upon them ceaſes, are diſpoſed to  
give the fire they have received, to any body that has leſs.  
Thus you may circulate it, as Mr MWatſon has ſhewn ; you  
may alſo accumulate or ſubſtract it upon or from any bod y.

wire, thus : : He ſtands on wax. Give him the electriſed  
bottle in his hand. Touch the wire with your finger, and  
then touch his hand or face; there are ſparks ever

wire; there will be a ſmall ſpark ; but when their lipsape

dark, a book that has a double line of gold round upon the  
covers, and then apply a knuckle to the gilding; the fire  
appears every where upon the gold like a flaſh of light-  
ning: not upon the leather, nor, if you touch the leather  
inſtead of the gold. We rub our tubes with buckſkin,  
  
  
dily and eaſily, without the leaſt fatigue ; eſpecially if kept  
in tight paſtboard caſes, lined with flannel, and fitting

enquiries, we had obſerved ſome particular Phznomena,  
which We. looked, upon to be. new,. and of which I pro-  
miſed to give you. ſome account, tho I apprehended they  
might poſſibly not be new to you, as ſo many hands are daily  
employ&#x27;d in electrical experiments on your fide the water,  
ſome or other of which would Pay hit on the 8  
obſervations. E HY Mo  
  
The firft is the 3 effect of pointed bodies, both in  
drawing off and throwing off the electrical fire. For example:  
  
Place an iron ſhot of three or four inches diameter, on the  
mouth of a clean dry glaſs bottle. By a fine ſilken thread  
from the cieling, right over the mouth of the bottle, ſuſ-  
pend a ſmall cork-ball, about the bigneſs of a marble ; the  
  
thread  
  
  
&quot;Raw ac rr 5 11  
  
: thread of fuch a length, as that the cork - ball ma) reſt a-  
gainlt the fide. of the ſhot.) Electrify the ſhot, and the  
ball will be repelled to the diſtance of four or five inches,  
more or/leſs,” acectding to the quantity of Electricity.  
When in this ſtate; if you pr̃eſent to the ſhot the point of  
along lender ſharp bodkin, at fix or eight inches diſtance,  
the repellency is inſtantly deſtroy d, and the cork flies to the  
ſhot. A blunt body muſt be brought within an inch, and  
draw a ſpark, to produce the fame effect. To prove that  
  
  
blade of the bodkin out of the wooden handle, and fix it  
in a ſtick of ſealing Wax, and then preſent it at the diſtance  
aforeſaid, or if you bring it very near, no ſuch effect fol-  
lows; but ſliding one finger along the wax till you touch  
the blade, and the ball flies to the ſhot immediately. If  
you preſent the point in the dark, you will ſee, ſometimes  
  
  
nearer you muſt bring it to obſerve the light; and at what-  
ever diſtance you ſee the light, you may draw off the  
electrical fire, and deſtroy the repellency.---If a cork-ball  
ſo.ſuſpended be repelled by the tube, and a point be pre-  
| ſented quick to it, tho at a conſiderable diſtance, tis ſur-  
prizing to ſee how ſuddenly it flies back to the tube.  
  
  
the wood is not dry ; for perfectly dry wood will no more  
conduct Electricity than ſealing wax, | |  
  
  
12 Mr R FPRANEEIN |  
  
To ſhew that points will throw. off a8 well as drow of  
the electrical fire; lay a long ſharp needle upon the ſhot,  
and you cannot electriſe the ſhot, {6 as to make it repel the  
cork-ball.---Or fix a needle to the end of u ſuſpended gun-  
barrel, or iron rod, ſo as to point beyond it like a little ba-  
yonet; and while it remains there, the gun- barrel, or rod,  
cannot by applying the tube to the other end be eleQuiſcd  
ſo as to give a ſpark, the fire continually running out fifatly  
at the point. In the dark you may oeiv make 6 fans  
appearance as it does in the caſe beforementioned, -  
  
| The repellency between the cork-ball and ths hors  
likewiſe deftroy&#x27;d 3 1. By ſifting fine fand on it; this  
does it gradually. 2. By breathing on it. 3. By making  
a ſmoke about it from burning wood.“ 4. By candle light,  
even tho the candle is at a foot diſtance: theſe do it ſud-  
denly The light of a bright coal from a wood fire ; and  
the light of red-hot iron do it likewiſe; but not at ſo great  
a diſtance, - Smoke from dry roſin dropt on hot iron, does  
of the figure in Bono&#x27;s ar nagen, theory ofthe ea.

cal fire was not created by friction, but collected, being re-  
ally an element diffus d among, and attracted by other  
matter, particularly by water and metals. We had even  
diſcovered and demonſtrated its afflux to the electrical  
  
  
mill wheels made of ſtiff paper vanes, fixed obliquely and  
turning freely on fine wire axes. Alſo by little wheels of  
the ſame matter, but formed like water wheels. Of the  
diſpoſition and application of which wheels, and the various  
phænomena reſulting, I could, if Thad time, fill you a ſheet.

z greater; after ſuch touch there is no ſpark between ei-  
  
ther of them and C, becauſe the electrical fire in all is re-  
  
  
triſing, the equality is never deſtroy d, the fire only circu-  
lating. Hence have ariſen ſome new terms among us:  
we fay, B, (and bodies like circumſtanced) is electriſed  
Poſttively; A; negatively. Or rather, B is electriſed plus;  
A, minus. And we daily in our experiments electriſe  
bodies plus or minus as we think proper. To electriſe  
plus or minus, no more needs to be known than this, that  
. the parts of the tube or ſphere that are rubbed, do, in the  
inſtant of the friction attract the electrical fire, and there-  
fore take it from the thing rubbing : the ſame parts imme-  
| diately, as the friction upon them ceaſes, are diſpoſed to

Thus you may circulate it, as Mr Watfon has ſhewn ; you  
may alſo accumulate or ſubſtract it upon or from any body,  
as you connect that body with the rubber or with the re-  
ceiver, the communication with the common ſtock being

ſhall only mention a few particulars more. We find gra-  
nulated lead better to fill the phial with, than water, being  
eafily warmed, and keeping warm and dry in damp air.  
We fire ſpirits with the wire of the phial. We light  
candles, juſt blown out, by drawing a ſpark among the  
  
  
plate that has gilt flowers, or applying it to gilt frames of  
looking-glaſſes, &amp;c. -— We electriſe a perſon twenty or  
more times running, with a touch of the finger on the  
wire, thus: He ſtands on wax. Give him the electriſed  
bottle in his hand. Touch the wire with-your finger, and  
  
time. We encreaſe the force of the eloctrical kiſs vaſtly,  
  
  
electriſed phial in hand; let the other take hold of the  
wire; there will be &gt; ſmall ſpark ; but when their lips ap-  
proach, they will be ſtruck and ſhock d. The fame if  
another gentleman and lady, C and D, ſtanding alſo on  
wax, and joining hands with A and B, ſalute, or ſhake  
hands. We ſuſpend by fine filk thread a counterfeit ſpi-  
der, made „ with legs of lin-  
  
  
  
_ &#x27;Lyrrans! of ELfctaidiry,” ry  
  
nen thread; and a grain or two of lead ſtuck in him to give  
him more weight. Upon the table, over which he hangs,  
we ſtick a wire upright as high as the phial and wire,  
him by ſetting the electrifſied phial at the ſame diſtance on  
the other ſide of him; he will immediately fly to the  
wire of the phial, bend his legs in touching it, then ſpring  
off, and fly to the wire in the table; thence again to the  
wire of the phial, playing with his legs againſt both in a  
very entertaining manner, appearing perfectly alive to per-  
ſons unacquainted. He will continue this motion an hour  
or more in dry weather. We electrify, upon wax in the  
dark, a book that has a double line of gold round upon the  
covers, and then apply a knuckle to the gilding ; the fire  
appears every where. upon the gold like a flaſh of light-

The firſt is the wonderful effect of pointed bodies, both in  
drawing off and throwing off the electrical fire. For example:  
Place an iron ſhot of three or four inches diameter on the

pend a ſmall cork- ball, about the bigneſs of a marble ; the

thread of ſuch a length, as that the cork- ball may reſt  
againſt the fide of the ſhot; Electrify the ſhot; and the 9. J.  
ball will be repelled to the diſtance of four or fire inches,  
more or leſs, according to the quantity of Electricity. &#x27;  
When in this ſtate, if you. ꝑreſent to the ſhot the point” of |  
a long ſlender ſharp bodkin, at ſix or eight inches diſtance,  
the repellency is inſtantly deſtroy&#x27;d; and the cork flies to  
the ſhot, A blunt body muſt be brought within an inch,  
and draw a ſpark, to produce the ſame effect. To prove  
that the electrical fire is. drawn q by the point, if you take  
the blade of the bod kin out of the wooden handle, and fix  
it in a ſtick of ſealing wax, and then preſent it at the diſ-  
tance aforeſaid, or if you bring it very near, no ſuch effect  
follows; but ſliding one finger along the wax till you  
touch the blade, and the ball flies to the ſhot immediately.  
If you preſent the point in the dark, you will ſee, ſome-  
times at a foot diſtance, and more, a light gather upon it  
like that of a fire-fly or glo- worm; the eſs ſharp- the  
point, the nearer you muſt bring it to obſerve the light;  
and at whatever diſtance you ſee the light, you may draw  
off the electrical fire, and deſtroy the repellency.— If a  
cork- ball ſo ſuſpended be repelled by the tube, and a point  
be preſented quick to it, tho“ at a conſiderable diſtance,

| cork-ball, — Or ſix a needle to the end of a ſuſpended gun-  
barrel, or iron rod, ſo as to point beyond: it like a little  
bayonet; and while it remains there, the gun · barrel, or  
rod, cannot by applying the tube to the other end be elec-  
triſed ſo as to give a ſpark, the fire continually running out  
ſilently at the point. In the dark you may ſee it make the  
ſame appearance as it does in the caſe beforementioned.  
  
The repellency between the cork-ball and the ſhot is  
likewiſe deſtroy d. 1. By ſifting fine ſand on it; this  
does it gradually. 2. By breathing on it. 3. By making  
a ſmoke about it from burning wood.“ 4. By candle light,  
even tho&#x27; the candle is at a foot diſtance: theſe do it ſud-  
denly.— The light of a bright coal from a wood fire; and  
the light of red-hot iron do it likewiſe ; but not at ſo great  
a diſtance. Smoke from dry roſin dropt on hot iron, does  
not deſtroy the repellency ; but is attracted by both ſhot  
and cork-ball, forming proportionable atmoſpheres round  
them, making them look beautifully, ſomewhat like ſome |  
of the figures in Burnet&#x27;s or Whifton&#x27;s theory of the earth.

** A perſon ſtanding on wax, and rubbing the tube, and  
  
them, (provided they do not ſtand ſo as to touch one an-  
other) appear to be electriſed, to a perſon ſtanding on the  
floor; that is, he will perceive a ſpark on 1 ere  
lk of them with his knuckle.  
  
2. But if the perſons on wax touch one scher during  
the exciting of the es neither of em wall appeer to be  
electriſed.  
  
3. If they touch one another after exciting the tube,  
and drawing the fire as aforeſaid, there will be a ſtronger  
ſpark between them, than was between either of n and  
the perſon on the floor.  
  
J. After ſuch ſtrong ſpark, neither of them diſcover any  
electricity.  
  
Theſe appearances we attempt to account for thus. We  
ſu ppoſe, as aforeſaid, that electrical fire is a common ele-  
ment, of which every one of the three perſons abovemen-  
tioned has his equal ſhare, before any operation is begun  
with the tube, A, who ſtands on wix and rubs the tube,  
collects the electrical fire from himſelf into the glaſs; and  
his communication with the common ſtock being cut off  
by the wax, his body is not again immediately ſupply&#x27;d.  
B, (who ſtands on wax likewiſe) paſſing his knuckle along  
near the tube, receives the fire which was collected by the  
2 from A; and his communication with the common  
ſtock being likewiſe cut off, he retains the additional quan-  
tit received. —To C, ſtanding on the floor, both appear

is greater; after ſuch touch there is no ſpark between ei-  
ther of them and C, becauſe the electrical fire in all is re-  
duced to the original equality. If they touch while elec-  
triſing, the equality is never deſtroy d, the fire only circu-  
lating. Hence have ariſen ſome new terms among us:  
  
  
A, minus. And we daily in our expetiments electriſe  
  
  
plus or minus, no more needs to be known than this, that  
  
  
;  
  
the parts of the tube or ſphere that are rubbed, do, in the  
  
inſtant of the friction attract the electrical fire, and there- |  
  
  
diately, as the friction upon them ceaſes, are diſpoſed to  
give the fire they have received, to any body that has lefs.  
Thus you may circulate it, as Mr Watſon has-ſhewn; you  
may alſo accumulate or ſubſtract it upon or from any body,  
as you connect that body with the rubber or with the re-  
  
  
cut off. We think that ingenious gentleman was deceived,

leſs electrical fire in them than things in common.  
  
As the veſſel is juſt upon ſailing, I cannot give you ſo  
large an account of American Electricity as I intended: I  
ſhall only mention a few particulars more, — We find gra-

eaſily warmed, and keeping warm and dry in damp air.—  
We fire ſpirits with the wire of the phial.— We light  
1 candles, juſt blown out, by drawing a ſpark among the  
ſmoke between the wire and ſnuffers. — We repreſent  
lightning, by paſſing the wire in the dark over a china  
plate that has gilt flowers, or applying it to gilt frames of  
looking-glaſſes, &amp;c. — We electriſe a perſon twenty or  
more times running, with a touch. of the finger; on the  
wire, thus : He ſtands on wax. Give him the electriſed  
bottle in his hand. Touch the wire with your finger, and  
then touch his hand or face there are ſparks every

1 thus: Let A and B ſtand on wax; give one of them the  
[ eleQriſed phial in hand; let the other take hold of the

appears every where upon the gold like a flaſh of light-

Of his plus and minus theory, Franklin thus writes to Mr.  
Collinson: ‘* To electrise plus or minus, no more needs to be  
known than this, that the parts of the tube or sphere that  
are rubbed do, in the instant of the friction, atiract the  
electrical fire, and therefore take it from the thing rubbing,  
the same parts, immediately as the friction upon them  
ceases, are disposed to give the fire they have received to  
any body that has less.”

he describes an experiment showing ‘‘ the wonderful effect of  
pointed bodies both in drawing off and in throwing off the electri-  
cal fire.’’ Moreover, it is in this first scientific letter that he pro-  
peunds his theory of electricity. ‘‘ We say B (and bodies like  
circumstanced) is electrified positinely ; A, negatively. Or, rather,  
B is electrified p/us ; A, minus. And we daily, in our experiments,  
electrize bodies p/us or minus, as we think proper. ‘To electrize  
plus or minus, no more needs to be known than this, that the parts  
of the tube or sphere that are rubbed do, in the instant of the fric-  
tion, attract the electrical fire and therefore take it from the thing  
rubbing ; the same parts, immediately as the friction upon them  
ceases, are disposed to give the fire they have received to any body

hand, and within a year he had ascertained  
a fact which went far to revolutionize the  
whole science. Discarding the idea that  
electricity was a force created by friction,  
he maintained that it was “ really an element  
diffused among, and attracted by other mat-  
ter, particularly by water and metals.” He  
proved that the Leyden jar, no matter how  
highly electrified, contained no. more elec-
