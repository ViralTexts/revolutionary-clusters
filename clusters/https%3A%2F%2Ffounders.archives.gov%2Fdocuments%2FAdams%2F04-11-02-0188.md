To be poetical is a privilege of Lovers, and to be allegorical a privilege of Poetry. When the sordid iron of oeconomical arrangements, is mingled with the pure gold of a lover’s passion, the meanness of the mixture needs to be disguised in description by some ornament of language or of Fancy. You will understand what I mean to say, and I hope you will not disapprove my intentions.  
Your letter observes that all was calm and tranquil at the time of its date. I very much doubt whether the case will be the same, when you shall receive this.
