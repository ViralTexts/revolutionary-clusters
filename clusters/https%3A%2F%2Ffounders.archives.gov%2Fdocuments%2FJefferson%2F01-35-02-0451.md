explanation necessary. My text of explanation would be  
this: The President is to have the laws executed. He

prosecution put into a train which is not lawful, he may  
order it to be discontinued and put into legal train. I  
found a prosecittion poing on apainst Dieane for an offenst

perusal,  
&quot;WASHINGToN, November 1, 18o.  
&quot;Dear Sir,- I some days ago received a  
letter from Messrs. Denniston a Chetham,  
of the most friendly kind, asking the gene-­  
ral grounds on which the nolle prosepul in  
Duane&#x27;s case ought to be presented to the  
public, which they propose to do. You are  
sensible I must avoid committing myself in  
that channel of justification, and that were I  
to do it in this case, I might be called on by  
other printers in other cases where it might  
he inexpedient to say anything. Yet, to so  
civil an application, I cannot reconcile my,­  
self to the incivility of giving no answer. I  
have thought, therefore, of laying your  
friendship under contribution, and asking  
you to take the trouble of seeing them and  
of saying to them, that the question being  
in the line of the law, I had desired you to  
give them the explanation necessary. My  
test of explanation would be this: The pree­  
sident is to have the laws executed. He may  
order an offence then to be prosecuted. If  
he sees a prosecution put into a train which  
is not legal, he may order it to be discon­  
tinued and put into lawful train. I found  
a prosccution qoing on gvainst Duadne for  
an offence aqainst the Senate, founded on  
the sedition act. I ArFIeN THAT AcT To re no  
LAw RECATSE in onPOSITION TO THe CoNsti­  
rerion, ANd I suAI Treat it as aul­  
Lity wherever it comes in the war or  
af PencTIons. I therefore directed that  
prosccation to be discontinued and a newg  
one to be commenced, founded on whatso-­  
aver other law might be in existence aquinst  
the offence. This tas done, and the grand  
jury, finding no other lano aqcinet if, de.­  
clined doing angthing under the bill. There  
appears to me to be no weale pard in any  
of these positions or inferences. There is,  
however, in the application to you to trous­  
ble yourself with the question. For this I  
owe apology, and build it on your goodness  
and friendship. Health and happiness

WAsHINGTON, Nov. 1, 1801.  
Dear SIr: I some days ago reeceived a  
letter from Messrs. Dennison &amp; Chetham,  
of the most friendly kind, asking the gen­  
eral grounds on which the nolle prosequi  
in Duanne&#x27;s case ought to be presented to  
the public, which they propose to do.  
You are sensible I must avoid committing  
myself in that channel of justification,  
and that were I to do it in this case, I  
might be called on by other printers in  
other cases where it might be inexpedient  
to say anything. Yet to so civil an appli­  
cation, I cannot reconcile myself to the  
incivility of giving no answer. I have  
thought, therefore, of laying your friend­  
ship under contribution, and asking per­  
mission of you to take the trouble of see­  
ing them and of saying to them, that the  
question being in the line of the law, I had  
desired you to give them the explanation  
necessary. My text of explanation would  
be this: The president is to have the  
laws executed. He may order an offence  
then to be prosecuted. If he sees a pros­  
ecution put into a train which is not law  
ful he may order it to be discontinued and  
put into legal train. I found a prosecu-  
  
tion going on against Duane for an offence  
o an e et oe on te e  
  
tion act. I affirm that act to be no law,  
because in opposition to the Constitution,  
and I shall treat it as a nullity wher ever  
it comes in the way of my functions  
therefore directed that prosecution to be  
discontinued and a new one to be com-  
menced, founded on whatsoever other  
law might be in existence against the of­  
fence. This was done, and the grand jury  
finding no other law against it, declined  
doing anything against the bill. There  
appears to me to be no weak part in any  
of these positions or inferences. There is,  
however, in the application to you to  
trouble yourself with the question. For  
this I owe apology, and build it on your  
goodness and friendship
