irly, candidly, and sincerely, used. If we have committed errors, and can be made sensible of them, we agree with you in opinion that we ought to correct them, and compensate the injuries which may have been consequent thereon; and we trust the French republic will be actuated by the same just and benevolent principles of national policy.We do, therefore, most sincerely approve of your determination to promote and accelerate an accommodation of our existing differences with that republic, by negotiation, on terms compatible with the rights, duties, interests, and honor, of our nation. And you may rest assured of our most cordial co-operation, so far as it may become necessary, in this pursuit.Peace and harmony with all nations is our sincere wish; but, such being the lot of humanity, that nations will not always reciprocate peaceable dispositions, it is our firm belief, that effectual measures of defence will tend to inspire that national self-respect and confidence at home, which is the unfailing source of respectability abroad, to check aggression, and prevent war.While we are endeavoring to adjust our differences with the French republic, by amicable negotiation, the progress of the war in Europe, the depredations on our commerce, the personal injuries to our citizens, and the general complexion of affairs, prove to us your vigilant care, in recommending to our attention effectual measures of defence.Those which you recommend, whether they relate to external defence, by permiting our citizens to arm for the purpose of repelling aggressions on their commercial rights, and by providing sea convoys; or to internal defence, by increasing the establishments of artillery and cavalry, by forming a provisional army, by revising the militia laws, and fortifying, more completely, our ports and harbors; will meet our consideration, under the influence of the same just regard for the security, interest, and honor, of our country, which dictated your recommendation.Practices so unnatural and iniquitous, as those you state, of our own citizens converting their property and personal exertions into the means of annoying our trade, and injuring their fellow-citizens, deserve a legal severity commensurate with their turpitude.Although the Senate believe that the prosperity and happiness of our country does not depend on general and extensive political connexions with European nations, yet we can never lose sight of the propriety as well as necessity of enabling the Executive, by sufficient and liberal supplies, to maintain, and even extend, our foreign intercourse, as exigencies may require, reposing full confidence in the Executive, in whom the Constitution has placed the powers of negotiation.We learn, with sincere concern, that attempts are in operation to alienate the affections of our fellow-citizens from their Government. Attempts so wicked, wherever they exist, cannot fail to excite our utmost abhorrence. A government chosen by the people for their own safety and happiness, and calculated to secure both, cannot lose their affections, so long as its administration pursues the principles upon which it was erected. And your resolution to observe a conduct just and impartial to all nations; a sacred regard to our national engagements; and not to impair the rights of our Government; contains principles which cannot fail to secure to your administration the support of the National Legislature, to render abortive every attempt to excite dangerous jealousies among us, and to convince the world that our Government, and your administration of it, cannot be separated from the affectionate support of every good citizen. And the Senate cannot suffer the present occasion to pass, without thus publically and solemnly expressing their attatchment to the constitution and Government of their country; and as they hold themselves responsible to their constituents, their consciences, and their God, it is their determination, by all their exertions, to repel every attempt to alienate the affections of the People from the Government, so highly injurious to the honor, safety, and independence, of the United States.We are happy, since our sentiments on the subject are in perfect unison with yours, in this public manner to declare, that we
