about a month ago Colo. Burr called on me, &amp; entered into a conversation in which he mentioned that a  
little before my coming into office I had written to him a letter intimating that I had destined him for a high employ,  
had he not been placed by the people in a different one; that he had signified his willingness to resign as V. President  
to give aid to the admn in any other place; that he had never asked an office however; he asked aid of nobody,  
but could walk on his own legs, &amp; take care of himself: that I had always used him with politeness, but nothing more:  
that he had aided in bringing on the present order of things, that he had supported the admn, &amp; that he could  
do me much harm: he wished however to be on different ground: he was now disengaged from all particular business, willing  
to engage in something, should be in town some days, if I should have any thing to propose to him.   I observed to him that  
I had always been sensible that he possessed talents which might be employed greatly to the advantage of the public, &amp;  
that as to myself I had a confidence that if he were employed he would use his talents for the public good: but that he  
must be sensible the public had withdrawn their confidence from him, &amp; that in a government like ours it was necessary  
to embrace in it’s admn as great a mass of public confidce as possible, by employing those who had a character  
with the public, of their own, &amp; not merely a secondary one through the Exve. he observed that if we believed a few  
newspapers it might be supposed he had lost the public confidence, but that I know how easy it was to engage newspapers in  
any thing. I observed that I did not refer to that kind of evidence of his having lost the public confidence, but to the  
late presidential election, when, tho’ in possn of the office of V. P. there was not a single voice heard for his  
retaining it. that as to any harm he could do me, I knew no cause why he should desire it, but at the same time I feared  
no injury which any man could do me: that I never had done a single act, or been concerned in any transaction, which I  
feared to have fully laid open, or which could do me any hurt if truly stated: that I had never done a single thing with a  
view to my personal interest, or that of any friend, or with any other view than that of the greatest public good: that  
therefore no threat or fear on that head would [ever] be a motive of action with me. he has continued in town to this time;  
dined with me this day  &amp; called on me to take leave 2. or 3. days ago. I did not commit the

 any kind was ever made to me on that occasion by Genl. Smith, nor any answer authorised by me.  
and this fact Genl. Smith affirms at this moment, for some matters connected with this see my notes of Feb. 12. &amp; 14.  
1801. made at the moment. but the following transactions took place about the same time, that is to say while the  
Presidential election was in suspense in Congress, which tho’ I did not enter at the time they made such an impression on  
my mind that they are now as fresh as to their principal circumstances as if they had happened yesterday. coming out of  
the Senate chamber one day I found Gouverneur Morris on the steps. he stopped me &amp; began a conversn on the strange  
&amp; portentous state of things then existing, and went on to observe that the reasons why the minority of states were so  
opposed to my being elected was that they apprehended that 1. I should turn all federalists out of office. 2. put down the  
Navy 3. wipe off the public debt &amp;ca.   
  
  
  
that I need only to declare, or authorise my friends to declare, that I would not  
take these steps, and instantly the event of the election would be fixed. I told him that I should leave the world to  
judge of the course I meant to pursue by that which I had pursued hitherto; believing it to be my duty to be passive &amp;  
silent during the present scene; that I should certainly make no terms, should never go into the office of President by  
capitulation, nor with my hands tied by any conditions which should hinder me from pursuing the measures which I should  
deem for the public good. it was understood that Gouverneur Morris had entirely the direction of the vote of Lewis Morris  
of Vermont, who by coming over to M. Lyon would have added another vote &amp; decided the election.   about the same time, I  
met with mr Adams walking in the Pensylva. avenue. we conversed on the state of things. I observed to him that a very  
dangerous experiment was then in contemplation, to defeat the Presidential election by an act of Congress declaring the  
right of the Senate by naming a President of the Senate, to devolve on him the govmt during any interregnum: that  
such a measure would probably produce resistance by force &amp; incalculable consequences which it would be in his power to  
prevent by negativing such an act. he seemed to think such an act justifiable &amp; observed it was in my power to fix the  
election by a word in an instant, by declaring I would not turn out the federal officers, not put down the Navy, nor  
spurge the National debt. finding his mind made up as to the usurpation of the government by the President of the Senate I  
urged it no further, observed the world must judge as to myself of the future by the past, and turned the conversation to  
some thing else.   about the same time Dwight Foster of Massachusets called on me in my room one night &amp; went into very  
long conversation on the state of affairs the drift of which was to let me understand that the fears above-mentioned were  
the only obstacles to my election, to all of which I avoided giving any answer the one way or the other. from this moment  
he became most bitterly &amp; personally opposed to me &amp; so has ever continued. I do not recollect that I ever had any  
particular conversn with Genl. Sam. Smith on this subject. very possibly I had however, as the general subject &amp; all  
it’s parts were the constant themes of conversatn in the private tete à tetes with our friends. but certain I am that  
neither he, nor any other republican ever uttered the most distant hint to me about submitting to any conditions or giving  
any assurances to any body; and still more certainly was neither he or any other person ever authorised by me to say that  
I would or would not do.   see a very exact statement of Bayard’s conduct on that occasion in a piece amon

Coming out of the Senate Chamber one day I found  
Gouvernkur Monnis on the steps. He stopped me and  
began a conversation on the strange and portentous  
state of things then existing, and went on to observe  
that the reasons why the minority of States was so op  
posed to my being elected, wers, that they apprehended

to purzue br that which I had puraued hitherto, bellev  
ing it to be my duty to be passive and silent during th

should never go into the office of President by capitula-

should hinder me from pursuing the measures which I  
should deem for the public good  
I do not recollect that I ever had any particular con  
versation with en. SAnvri Anirn on this subject. Very  
possibly I had, however, as the general subject and all  
its parts were the constant themes of conversation in  
the private tete h-tetes with our friends. But certain I­  
am that neither he nor any other Republican ever  
uttered the most distant hint to me about submitting to  
any conditions, and giving any assurances to anybody,  
and still more certainly was neither he nor any other  
person ever authorized by me to say what I would or

** Abont a month ago Col. Burr called on me  
and entered into a conversation, in which he.  
mentioned that a little before my coming inte  
ottice I had written to him a letter intimating  
that I had destined him for a hig wy + A had  
he not been placed by the people in a different  
one; that he had signified his willingness to re-  
sign as Vice President to give aid to the Admin-  
istration in any other place; that he had never  
asked an office, however; he asked aid of no-  
body, but could walk on his own legs and take  
care of himself; that I had always used him  
with politeness, but nothing more; thathe aided  
in bringing on the present order of things; that  
he had supported the Administration and that  
he could do me much harm; le wished, how-  
ever, to be on different ground; he was now  
disengaged from al) particular business, will-  
ing to engage in something, should be in town  
comme days, if I should have anything to propose  
to him.  
  
“Thad observed to him that I had always  
been sensible that he possessed talents which  
might be employed greatly to the advantage  
of the public, and that as to myself I had a con-  
fidence that if he were employed he would use  
his talents for the public goes: but that he  
must be sensible the public had withdrawn  
their confidence from him and that in a Govern-  
ment like ours it was necessary to embrace in  
its Administration as great a massof public  
contidence as possible by employing those who  
had a character withthe public of their own  
and not merely a secondary one through the  
  
Executive.  
  
“ He observed that if we believed a few news-  
papers it might be supposed he had lost the  
public confidence, but that I knew how easy it  
Was to engage newspapers to say things. I ob-  
served that I did not refer to that kind of evi-  
dence of his having lost the public confidence,  
but to the late Presidential election when,  
though in possession of the office of Vico Presi-  
dent, there was not a single voice heard for his  
retaining it; that as to any harm he could do  
me, I knew no cause why he should desire it,  
but that at the same time I feared no injury  
which any man could do me; that [ never  
had done a single act, or been connected in any  
transaction which I feared to have fully laid  
open or which could do me any hurt if traly  
stated; that l had never done a single thing wit  
a view to my personal interest or that of any  
friend, or with any other view than that of the  
greatest good; that therefore no tnreat or fear  
on that head would ever be a motive of action  
with me. He has continued in town to this  
time; dined with me this day week and called  
on me to take leave two or three days ago.”
