ey are, as you justly observe, but a palliation of an evil, the cure of which calls for all the wisdom &amp; the means of the nation. the greatest evils of populous society have ever appeared to me to spring from the vicious distribution of it’s members among the occupations called for. I have no doubt that those nations are essentially right, which leave this to individual choice, as a better guide to an advantageous distribution than any other which could be devised. but when by a blind concourse, particular occupations are ruinously overcharged, &amp; others left in want of hands, the national authorities can do much towards restoring the equilibrium. on the revival of letters, learning became the universal favorite. and with reason: because there was not enough of it existing to manage the affairs of a nation to the best advantage, nor to advance its individuals to the happiness of which they were susceptible, by improvements in their minds, their morals, their health, &amp; in those conveniencies which contribute to the comfort &amp; embellishment of life. all the efforts of the society therefore were directed to the increase of learning, &amp; the inducements of respect, ease &amp; profit were held up for it’s encouragement. even the charities of the nation forgot that misery was their object, and spent themselves in founding schools to transfer to science the hardy sons of the plough. to these incitements were added the powerful fascinations of great cities. these circumstances have long since produced an overcharge in the class of competitors for learned occupation, &amp; great distress among the supernumerary candidates; &amp; the more, as their habits of life have disqualified them for reentering into the laborious class. the evil cannot be suddenly, nor perhaps ever entirely cured: nor should I presume to say by what means it may be cured. doubtless there are many engines which the nation might bring to bear on this object. public opinion, &amp; public encouragement are among these. the class principally defective is that of agriculture. it is the first in utility, &amp; ought to be the first in respect. the same artifical means which have been used to produce a competition to learning, may be equally succesful in restoring agriculture to it’s primary dignity in the eyes of men. it is a science of the very first order. it counts, among it’s handmaids, the most respectable sciences, such as, chemistry, natural philosophy, mechanics, mathematics generally, natural history, botany. in every college &amp; university a professorship of Agriculture, &amp; the class of it’s students might be honored as the first. young men, closing their academical education with this as the crown of all other sciences, fascinated with it’s solid charms, &amp; at a time when they are to chuse an occupation, instead of crowding the other classes, would return to the farms of their fathers, their own, or those of others, &amp; replenish &amp; reinvigorate a calling now languishing under contempt &amp; oppression. the charitable schools, instead of storing their pupils with a lore which the present state of society does not call for, converted into schools of agriculture, might restore them to that branch, qualified to enrich &amp; honor themselves, &amp; to increase the productions of the nation instead of consuming them. a gradual abolition of the useless offices, so much accumulated in all governments, might close this drain also from the labors of the field, and lessen the burthens imposed on them. by these, &amp; the better means which will occur to others, the surcharge of the learned, might in time be drawn off to recruit the laboring class of citizens, the sum of industry be increased, &amp; that of misery diminished.   
Among the antients the redundance of population was sometimes checked by exposing infants. to the moderns, America has offered a more humane resource. many, who cannot find employment in Europe, accordingly, come here. those, who can labour, do well for the most part. of the learned class of emigrants, a small portion find employment analagou

ing agriculture. A century ago less than four per cent of our  
population lived in cities, while to-day, the urban population is  
nearly forty per cent. This is partly due to the defect in our  
system of education, which better qualifies our young people for  
any other work than the tillage of the earth. In 1803, Jefferson  
referred to the subject of agriculture as follows: — “It is a science  
of the very first order. It counts among its handmaids the most  
respectable sciences, such as chemistry, natural philosophy,  
mechanics, mathematics, natural history and botany. In every  
college and university a professorship of agriculture and the class  
of its students might be honored as the first. Young men closing  
their academical education with this as the crown of all other  
sciences, fascinated with its solid charms, and at a time when  
they are to choose an occupation, instead of crowding the other  
classes, would return to the farms of their fathers, their own, or
