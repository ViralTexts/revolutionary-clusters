The founders of our government understood that it was devised to  
facilitate annexation of territory ; and our past history has settled that  
question. At the time of the Louisiana purchase, Jefferson wrote to  
Gallatin : ‘“ There is no constitutional difficulty as to the acquisition of  
territory ; and whether, when acquired, it may be taken into the Union  
by the Constitution as it now stands, will become a question of expedi-  
ency.” Gouverneur Morris said at this time, that he had known since  
the day when the Constitution was adopted that all North Americ

So we find Gallatin, probably the clearest  
thinker and greatest constructive statesman of  
the old Republican party, quoting the same pass  
sage of the Constitution to justify colonlal  
power that Senator Hoar relies on to forbid it.  
In answer to this letter Jefferson wrote:

proposition; there is no constitutional difficuity
