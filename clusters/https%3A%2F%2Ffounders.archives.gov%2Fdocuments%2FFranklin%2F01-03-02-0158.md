Richard Peters, whom he considered suitable to head such an institution. Peters declined, “having more profitable Views in the Service of the Proprietors”; and Franklin “let the Scheme lie a while dormant.” He revived it in 1749 with the support of “a Number of active Friends, of whom the Junto furnished a good Part,” and gave notice of th

, a place in your paper, as it seems apropos to the design above mentioned.  
Pliny junior to Cornelius Tacitus.  
I rejoice that you are safely arrived in Rome; for tho’ I am always desirous to see you, I am more particularly so now. I purpose to continue a few days longer at my house at Tusculum, in order to finish a work which I have upon my hands: For I am afraid, should I put a stop to this design, now that it is so nearly compleated, I shall find it difficult to resume it. In the mean while, that I may lose no time, I send this letter before me, to request a favour of you, which I hope shortly to ask in person: But before I inform you what my request is, I must let you into the occasion of it. Being lately at Comum, the place of my nativity, a young lad, son to one of my neighbours, made me a visit. I asked him whether he studied, and where? He told me he did, and at Mediolanum.  
  
*Milan.  
  
And why not here? Because (said his father, who came with him) we have no masters. “No! said I, surely it nearly concerns you, who are fathers (and very opportunely several of the company were so) that your sons should receive their education here, rather than any where else: For where can they be placed more agreeably, than in their own country, or instructed with more safety, and less expence, than at home, and under the eye of their parents? Upon what very easy terms might you, by a general contribution, procure proper masters, if you would only apply towards the raising a salary for them, the extraordinary expence it costs you for your sons journies, lodgings, and whatsoever else you pay for upon account of their being abroad; as pay indeed you must in such a case for every thing? Tho’ I have no children myself, yet I shall willingly contribute to a design so beneficial to (what I look upon as a child, or a parent) my country; and therefore I will advance a third part of any sum you shall think proper to raise for this purpose. I would take upon myself the whole expence, were I not apprehensive that my benefaction might hereafter be abused, and perverted to private ends; as I have observed to be the case in several places where publick foundations of this nature have been established. The single means to prevent this mischief is, to have the choice of the masters entirely in the breast of the parents, who will be so much the more careful to determine properly, as they shall be obliged to share the expence of maintaining them: For tho’ they may be careless in disposing of another’s bounty, they will certainly be cautious how they apply their own; and will see that none but those who deserve it shall receive my money, when they must at the same time receive theirs too. Let my example then encourage you to unite heartily in this useful design, and be assured, the greater the sum my share shall amount to, the more agreeable it will be to me. You can undertake nothing that will be more advantageous to your children, nor more acceptable to your country. They will, by this means, receive their education where they receive their birth, and be accustomed, from their infancy, to inhabit and affect their native soil. May you be able to procure professors of such distinguished abilities, that the neighbouring towns shall be glad to draw their learning from hence; and as you now send your children to foreigners for education, may foreigners in their turn flock hither for their instruction.” I thought proper thus to lay open to you the rise of this affair, that you might be the more sensible how agreeable it will be to me, if you undertake the office I request. I intreat you, therefore, with all the earnestness a matter of so much importance deserves, to look out, amongst the great numbers of men of letters, which the reputation of your genius brings to you, proper persons to whom we may apply for this purpose; but without entering into any agreement with them on my part: For I would leave it entirely free to the parents to judge and choose as they shall see proper: All the share I pretend to claim is, that of contributing my care and my money: If therefore any one shall be found, who thinks himself qualified for the undertaking, he may repair thither; but without relying upon any thing but his merit.

I thought proper thus to lay open to  
you the principle upon which this scheme  
turns, that you might be the more sen-  
sible how agreeable it will be to me, if  
you undertake the office I request. I  
entreat you, therefore, with all the ear-  
pestuess a matter of so much importance  
deserves, to look out, among the great  
number of men of letters which the re-

to the force and truth of the sentiments  
of Pliny, as to the education of  
children abroad, several families in  
this colony can give their decided  
testimony. &quot; I rejoice that you are  
safely arrived in Rome ; for though I am  
always desirous to see you, I am more  
particularly so now. I purpose to  
continue a few days longer at my house  
at Tusculum, in order to finish a work  
which I have upon my hands. For I am  
afraid, should I put a stop to this  
design now that it is so nearly  
completed, I shall find it difficult to  
re-sume it. In the mean while, that I  
may lose no time, I send this letter  
before me to request a favour of you,  
which I hope shortly to ask in person.  
But before I inform you what my request  
is, I must let you into the occasion of  
it. Being lately at Comum, the place of  
my nativity, a young lad, son to one of  
my neigh-bours, made me a visit. I asked  
him whether &amp;nbsp; he studied oratory,  
and where ?—he told me he did, and at  
Mediolanum. (Milan.) And &amp;nbsp; why not  
here ? Because (said his father, who  
&amp;nbsp; came with him) we have no  
professors. &#x27; No ! (said I), surely it  
nearly concerns you who are fathers (and  
very opportunely several of the &amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp; company were so) that your sons  
should re-ceive their education here,  
rather than any &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;  
where else. For where can they be placed  
more agreeable than in their own  
country, or &amp;nbsp; instructed with more  
safety and less expense than at home  
under the eye of their parents ? &amp;nbsp;  
Upon what very easy terms might you, by  
a gene-ral contribution, procure proper  
masters, if you would only apply,  
towards the raising a salary &amp;nbsp; for  
them, the extraordinary expense it costs  
you for your sons journies, lodgings,  
and what- &amp;nbsp; ever else you pay for  
upon account of their being abroad ; as  
pay indeed you must in such a case for  
every thing. Though I have no children  
myself, yet I shall willingly contri-  
&amp;nbsp; bute to a design so beneficial to  
(what I look upon as a child or a  
parent) my country ; and therefore I  
will advance a third part of any sum you  
shall think proper to raise for this  
purpose. I would take upon myself the  
whole expense, were I not apprehensive  
that my be-nefaction might hereafter be  
abused and per-verted to private ends ;  
as I have observed to be the case in  
several places where public foun- &amp;nbsp;  
dations of this nature have been  
established. The single means to prevent  
this mischief is, to leave the choice of  
the professors entirely in the breasts  
of the parents, who will be so much the  
more careful to determine properly, as  
&amp;nbsp; they shall be obliged to share  
the expense of maintaining them. For  
though they might be &amp;nbsp; careless in  
disposing of another&#x27;s bounty, they  
&amp;nbsp; will certainly be cautious how  
they apply their own ; and will see that  
none but those who deserve it shall  
receive my money, when they must at the  
same time receive theirs too. Let my  
example, then, encourage you to unite  
heartily in this useful design ; and be  
assured the greater the sum my share  
shall amount to, the more agreeable it  
will be to me. You can undertake nothing  
that will be more advan- &amp;nbsp; tageous  
to your children, nor more acceptable to  
your country. They will by this means  
re-ceive their education where they  
received their birth, and be accustomed  
from their infancy to inhabit and affect  
their native soil. May you be able to  
procure professors of such dis-  
tinguished abilities, that the  
neighbouring towns shall be glad to draw  
their learning from hence ; and as you  
now send your children to foreigners for  
education, may foreigners in their turn  
flock hither for their instruction !&#x27; I  
thought proper thus to lay open to you  
the rise of this affair, that you might  
be the more sen-sible how agreeable it  
will be to me, if you undertake the  
office I request. I entreat you,  
therefore, with all the earnestness a  
matter of so much importance deserves,  
to look out amongst the great numbers of  
men of letters which the reputation of  
your genius brings to you, proper  
persons to whom we may apply for this  
purpose ; but without entering into any  
agreement with them on my part. For I  
would leave it entirely free to the  
parents to judge and choose as they  
shall see proper ; all the share I  
pretend to claim is, that of contri-  
buting my care and my money. If,  
therefore, any one shall be found who  
thinks himself &amp;nbsp; qualified for the  
undertaking, he may repair thither ; but  
without relying upon anything but his  
merit.—Farewell.&quot; PHILLIP WARD. — Th

posal for establishing an Academy, and at that time thinking the  
Rev. Richard Peters, who was out of employ, a fit person to super-  
intend such an institution, 1 communicated the project to him;  
but he, having more profitable views in the service of the Proprie-  
tors, which succeeded, declined the undertaking; and, not knowing  
another at that time suitable for such a trust, I let the scheme lie  
a while dormant.” Mr. Peters became, in 1749, one of the first

Pliny the Younger, in a .somewhat celebrated letter to Cornelius  
Tacitus, writes : “ Being lately at Comum, the place of my nativity,  
a young lad, son to one of my neighbors, made me a visit. I asked  
him whether he studied rhetoric, and where ? He told me ho did, and  
at Mediolanum. And why not here ? Becau.se, said his father, who  
came with him, we have no professors.” Pliny goes on to say how  
he argued with the boy’s father and others to persuade them to estab¬  
lish a home college, offering to pay one-third of the cost himself.  
“Your sons,” he says, “will by these means receive their education  
where they received their birth, and be accustomed from their in¬  
fancy to inhabit and affect their native soil. You may be able to pro¬  
cure professors of such distinguished abilities that the neighboring  
towns shall be glad to draw their learning from hence; and as you  
now send your children to foreigners for education, may foreigners in  
their turn flock hither for their instruction.”&#x27;
