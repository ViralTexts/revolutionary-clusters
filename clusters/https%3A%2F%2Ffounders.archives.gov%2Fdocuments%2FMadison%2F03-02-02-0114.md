Fellow Citizens of the Senate &amp; of the House of Representatives.  
At the period of our last meeting, I had the satisfaction of communicating an adjustment with one of the principal belligerent Nations, highly important in itself, &amp; still more so, as presaging a more extended Accommodation. It is with deep concern, I am now to inform you, that the favorable prospect has been overclouded, by a refusal of the British Government to abide by the Act of it’s Minister Plenipotentiary, &amp; by it’s ensuing policy towards the United States, as seen through the communications of the Minister sent to replace him.  
Whatever pleas may be urged for a disavowal of engagements formed by Diplomatic Functionaries, in cases where, by the terms of the engagements, a mutual ratification is reserved; or where notice at the time may have been given, of a departure from instructions; or in extraordinary cases, essentially Violating the principles of equity; a disavowal could not have been apprehended in a case, where no such notice or violation existed; where no such ratification was reserved; &amp; more especially where, as is now in proof, an engagement, to be executed without any such ratification, was contemplated by the instructions given, and where it had, with good faith, been carried into immediate execution, on the part of the United States.  
These considerations not having restrained the British Government from disavowing the Arrangement, by virtue of which it’s Orders in Council were to be revoked, &amp; the event Authorizing the renewal of commercial intercourse, having thus not taken place; it necessarily became a question, of equal urgency &amp; importance, whether the Act prohibiting that intercourse, was not to be considered as remaining in legal force. This question being, after due deliberation, determined in the affirmative, a Proclamation to that effect, was issued. It could not but happen, however, that a return to this state of things, from that which had followed an execution of the arrangement by the U. S. would involve difficulties. With a view to diminish these as much as possible, the instructions from the Secretary of the Treasury, now laid before you, were transmitted to the Collectors of the Several Ports. If in permitting British Vessels to depart, without giving bonds not to proceed to their own ports, it should appear, that the tenor of legal Authority, has not been strictly pursued, it is to be ascribed to the anxious desire which was felt, that no individuals should be injured by so unforeseen an Occurrence: And I rely on the regard of Congress for the equitable interests of our own Citizens, to adopt whatever further provisions may be found requisite, for a general remission of penalties involuntarily incurred.  
The recall of the disavowed Minister, having been followed by the Appointment of a Successor, hopes were indulged that the new Mission would contribute to alleviate the disappointment which had been produced, and to remove the causes which had so long embarrassed the good understanding of the two Nations. It could not be doubted, that it would at least, be charged with conciliatory explanations of the step which had been taken, &amp; with proposals to be substituted for the rejected arrangement. Reasonable &amp; Universal as this expectation was, it also has not been fulfil[l]ed. From the first official disclosures of the new Minister, it was found that he had received no authority to enter into explanations, relative to either branch of the Arrangement disavowed; nor any Authority to substitute proposals, as to that branch, which concerned the British Orders in Council: And finally that his proposals with respect to the other branch, the attack on the Frigate Chesapeake, were founded on a presumption, repeatedly declared to be inadmissible by the U. S., that the first step towards adjustment was due from them; the proposals, at the same time, Omitting even a reference to the Officer Answerable for the murderous aggression, &amp; asserting a claim not less contrary to the British laws, &amp; British practice, than to the principles and obligations of the United States.  
The correspondence between the Department of State &amp; this Minister will show, how unessentially the features presented in it’s commencement, have been varied in it’s progress. It will show also, that forgetting the respect due to all Governments, he did not refrain from imputations on this, which required that no further communications should be received from him. The necessity of this step will be made known to His Britannic Majesty, through the Minister Plenipotentiary of the U. S in London—and it would indicate a want of the confidence due to a Government, which so well understands and exacts, what becomes foreign Ministers near it, not to infer that the misconduct of it’s own Representative, will be viewed in the same light, in which it has been regarded here. The British Government will learn, at the same time, that a ready attention will be given to communications through any channel which may be substituted. It will be happy, if the change in this respect, should be accompanied by a favorable revision of the unfriendly policy, which has been so long pursued, towards the United States.  
With France, the other belligerent whose trespasses on our commercial rights have long been the subject of our just remonstrances, the posture of our relations does not correspond with the measures, taken on the part of the United States, to effect a favorable change. The result of the several communications made to her Government, in pursuance of the Authorities vested by Congress in the Executive, is contained in the correspondence of our Minister at Paris, now laid before you.  
By some of the other Belligerents, altho’ professing just and Amicable dispositions, injuries materially affecting our commerce, have not been duly controled or repressed. In these cases, the interpositions deemed proper on our part, have not been omitted. But it well deserves the consideration of the Legislature, how far both the safety and the honor of the American flag may be consulted, by adequate provisions against that collusive prostitution of it, by Individuals, unworthy of the American name, which has so much favored the real or pretended suspicions, under which the honest commerce of their fellow Citizens has suffered.  
In relation to the Powers on the coast of Barbary, nothing has Occurred which is not of a nature rather to inspire confidence than distrust, as to the continuance of the existing Amity. With our Indian Neighbors, the just &amp; benevolent system, continued towards them, has also preserved peace, and is more and more advancing habits favorable to their civilization and happiness.  
From a statement which will be made by the Secretary of War, it will be seen that the fortifications on our maritime frontier, are in many of the Ports compleated; affording the defence which was contemplated; &amp; that a further time will be required to render complete, the works in the Harbour of New York, &amp; in some other places. By the enlargement of the works, and the employment of a greater number of hands at the public Armories, the supply of small arms, of an improving quality, appears to be annually increasing, at a rate, that with those made on private contract, may be expected to go far towards providing for the public exigency.  
The act of Congress providing for the equipment of our Vessels of war, having been fully carried into execution, I refer to the statement of the Secretary of the Navy for the information which may be proper on that subject. To that statement is added a view of the transfers of appropriations authorized by the Act of the Session preceding the last, and of the grounds on which the transfers were made.  
Whatever may be the course of your deliberations on the subject of our military establishments, I should fail in my duty, in not recommending to your serious attention, the importance of giving to our militia, the great bulwark of our Security, and resource of our power, An Organization, the best adapted to eventual situations, for which the U. S. ought to be prepared.  
The sums which had been previously Accumulated in the Treasury, together with the receipts during the year ending on the 30th. of September last (&amp; amounting to more than nine millions of Dollars) have enabled us to fulfill all our engagements, &amp; to defray the current expenses of Government, without recurring to any loan. But the insecurity of our commerce, and the consequent diminution of the public revenue, will probably produce a deficiency in the receipts of the ensuing year, for which and for other details, I refer to the statements which will be transmitted from the Treasury.  
In the state, which has been presented, of our affairs with the great parties to a disastrous &amp; protracted War, carried on in a mode equally injurious &amp; unjust to the U. S. as a neutral nation, the wisdom of the National Legislature, will be again summoned to the important decision on the alternatives before them. That these will be met in a spirit, worthy the councils of a Nation, conscious both of it’s rectitude, &amp; of it’s rights, &amp; careful as well of it’s honor, as of it’s peace, I have an entire confidence. And that the result will be stamped by a unanimity becoming the Occasion, and be supported by every portion of our citizens, with a patriotism enlightened &amp; invigorated by experience, ought as little to be doubted.  
In the midst of the wrongs &amp; vexations experienced from external causes, there is much room for congratulation, on the prosperity &amp; happiness flowing from our situation at Home. The blessing of health has never been more universal. The fruits of the seasons, though in particular Articles &amp; districts, short of their usual redundancy, are more than sufficient for our wants &amp; our comforts. The face of our country every where presents the evidence of laudable enterprize, of extensive capital, and of durable improvement. In a cultivation of the materials, &amp; the extension of useful manufactures; more especially, in the general application to household fabrics; we behold a rapid diminution of our dependence on foreign supplies. Nor is it unworthy of reflection, that this revolution in our pursuits and habits, is in no slight degree, a consequence of those impolitic &amp; Arbitrary Edicts, by which the contending nations, in endeavoring each of them to obstruct our trade with the other, have so far abridged our means of procuring the productions &amp; manufactures, of which our own are now taking the place.  
Recollecting always, that for every advantage which may contribute to distinguish out [sic] lot, from that to which others are doomed by the unhappy spirit of the times, we are indebted to that Divine Providence whose goodness has been so remarkably extended to this rising Nation; it becomes us to cherish a devout gratitude; and to implore from the same Omnipotent Source a blessing on the consultations and measures, about to be undertaken, for the welfare of our beloved Country.

Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of  
  
Representatives,  
T the period of our laft meeting, I  
  
&amp; had the fatisfaction of communicat-  
ing an adjuftment with one of the priuci-  
  
al belligerent nations, highly important  
in itfelf, and fti!l more fo, as preiaging a  
more extendedaccommodation. Itiswith  
coucern, I am nowto inform you, that  
the favourable object has been overcloud-  
ed. by arefufal of the Britih Government  
to abide by the a&amp; of its Minifter Plenipo-  
tentiary, and by its enfuing policy towards  
the United States, as feen through the com-  
munication of the Minifter fent to replace  
them.  
  
Whatever pleas may be urged for a dif-  
avowal of engagements formed by “diplo-  
matic tunctionaries, in cafes where by the  
terms ofthe engagements a mutual ratif-  
cation 1s referved 3 or where notice of the  
tine may have been piven, of a departure  
from iniiructions; or in’ extraordinary  
cafes, eflentially violating the principl:s of  
equity; a dilavowal could not have been  
apprehended in a cafe, where no fuch no-  
tice or violation exifled; where no fuch  
ratification were referved; and more ef-  
pecially, where, as is now in proof, an en-  
gagement, to be executed without any fuch  
ratification, was contemplated by the in-  
ftructions given, and where it had, with  
good faith, been carried ito immediate ex-  
¢ecution, on the part of the United States.  
  
Thefe confiderations not having reftrain-  
ed the Britith government from difavew-  
iogthe arrangement, by vircue of which  
its Orders in Council were to be revoked,  
and the event authorifing the renewal ‘of  
commercial i tercourfe, having thus not  
taken piace ; it certainly became a queltts  
on of equal urgency and importance, whee  
ther the act prohibiting that intcrcourfe  
wasnot to be confidered as yemaining ia  
legal force. Thisqueition being, after due  
deliberation, determined in the afhrma-  
tive, a proclamation to that eff &amp;, wis  
iiucd. It could not but happen however,  
thata return to this ftate of things. froim  
that which had followed an execution of  
toe arrancement by the United States,  
would involve dificulties. With a view to  
diminifh thefe as mush as poffible, the me  
ftructions trom the Secretary of the ‘lreae  
fury, vow laid before us, were tran{mitted  
to the ColleQors of the fevcral ports, If  
in permitting Britifh vefle&#x27;s to depart, with  
giving bonds not to proceed to their own  
ports, it thould appear that the tenor of  
legal aut®ority has not been ftndly pure  
fucd, it is to be afcribed to the anxtons  
deGre which was felt, that no individuals  
  
thould be injured by fo unforefeen ay as.  
currence And I rely on the reparg of  
Congrefs for the equitable interes of oy,  
citizens, to adopt whatever further prsy;,  
fions may be found requifite, for a genera)  
remifion of penalties involuntarily incy,.  
rec.  
  
The recall of the difavowed Minifter hay.  
ing heen followed by the appointinent of g  
fucceilor, hopes were indulged that the  
new miffion would contribute to alleviate  
the difappointment which had been pro.  
duced, and to remove the caufes which  
had fo long embarratled the good under.  
ftanding of the two nations. It could not  
be doubted that it would at leaft be charg.  
ed with conciliatory explanations of the  
ftep which had been taken, and with pro.  
pofals to be fubilituted for the rejeed  
arrangement, Reafonable and univert|  
as this expectation was, it alfo has not been  
fulfilled —From the firft official difclofures  
of the new Minifter, it was found that he  
had received no authority to center into cx.  
planations relative to either branch of the  
arrangement difavowed 3 norany author.  
ty tu fubftitute propofals, as to that branch,  
which concerned the Britith Orders in  
Counci!.—And finally, that his provofals  
with refpect to the other branch, the a’.  
tack onthe frigate Chefapeake, were tound.  
ed oh a prefu:rption, r-eatedly declared  
to be iaadmiffible by the United States,  
that the firft fep towards adjuftment was  
due fromthem; the propofalsat the fame  
time, omitting even areference to the of.  
ficer anfwerable for the murderous agoref.  
fion, and afferting a claim no lefs contrary  
to the Britit: laws, and Britith practice,  
than th® principles and obligaticns of the  
United States.  
  
The correspondence between the Depart  
ment of State and this Minifler will tow,  
how uncfleatially the features prefented in  
its commencement have vericd in its  
propref. it will fhow allo, that forget  
ing the refpect due to all goverments he  
did not refrain from imputations on this  
which required that no further communt-  
cations thould be received from hin.—  
‘The neeefity of this will be made known  
to his Britannic Majefty throuchthe Min!  
fter Plenipotentiary of the United States in  
London. And it would indicate a want of  
confidence due to a goverment which fo  
well underfands andexacts what beoames  
foreion Miniffers near it, not to iofer that  
the conduct of its own reprefentatives will  
be viewed ti the iam? light, in which it  
has been regarded here. The Britifi Go-

Fellow Citizens of the Senate and S  
of the House of Representatives * 3  
At the j)eriod of our last meeting, I had the satisfaction of  
communicating; an adjustment with one of tne principal belligerent :  
nations, highly important in itself, and still more so as presaging 1  
a more extended accommodation. It is with deep concern, 1 am i  
now to inform you, that the favorable prospect has been overcloud- 1  
ed, by a refusal of the British government to abide by the act of its 1  
Minister Plenipotentiary, and by its ensuing policy towards the &lt;  
United States, as seen through the communications of the minister 1  
sent to replace him. ]  
Whatever pleas may be urged for a disavowal of engagements 1  
formed by diplomatic functionaries, in cases where by the terras  
ot the engagements a mutual ratification is reserved ; or where no- 1  
tice at the time may have been given, of a departure from instruct  
tions ; or in extraordinary cases, essentially violating the princi- c  
pies of equity ; a disavowal could not have been apprehended in a  
case, where no such notice or violation existed j where no such &lt;  
ratification was reserved ; and more.especially, where, as is now  
in proof, an engagement, to be executed without any such ratifi­  
cation, was contemplated by the instructions given, and where it t  
had, with good faith, been carried into immediate execution, on \
the part of the United States. t  
These considerations not having restrained the British go- s  
vernment from disavowing the arrangement, by virtue of which its \
Orders in Council were to be revoked, and the event authorising i  
the renewal of commercial intercourse, having thus not taken place ; i  
it necessarily became a question of equal urgency and importance, t  
whether the act prohibiting that intercourse was not to be consi- t  
dered as remaining in legal force. This question being, after due  
deliberation, determined in the affirmative, a proclamation to that &lt;  
effect was issued. It could not but happen, however, that a return j  
to this state of things, from that which had followed an execution of i  
the arrangement by the United States, would involve difficulties. &lt;  
With a view to diminish these as much as possible, the instruc- ;  
tions from the Secretary of the Treasury, now laid before you, j  
were transmitted to the Collectors of the several ports. If in per­  
mitting British Vessels to depart, without giving bonds not to ;  
proceed to their ovviuports, it should appear that the tenor of legal ]  
authority has not been strictly pursued, it is to be ascribed to the  
anxious desire which was felt, that no individuals should be injur- i  
ed by so unforeseen an occurrence : And I rely on the regard of  
Congress for the equitable interests of our own citizens, to adopt  
whatever further provisions may be found requisite, for a general  
remission of penalties involuntarily incurred.  
The recall of the disavowed Minister having been followed  
bv the appointment of a successor, hopes were indulged that the  
new mission would contribute to alleviate the disappointment  
which had been produced, and to remove the causes which had so  
lon-: embarrassed the good understanding of the two nations. It  
could not be doubted, that it would at least be charged with con­  
ciliatory explanations of the step had been taken, and with  
proposals to be substituted for the rejected arrangement. Reason­  
able and universal as this expectation was, it also has not been ful­  
filled. From the first official disclosures of the new Minister, it  
was found that he had received no authority to enter into explana­  
tions relative to either branch of the arrangement disavowed; nor  
any authority to substitute proposals, as to that branch, which con­  
cerned the British Orders in Council: And finally, that his pro­  
posals with respect to the other branch, the attack on the frigate  
Chesapeake, were founded on a presumption, repeatedly declared  
to be inadmissible by the United States, that the first step towards  
adjustment was due from them; the proposals at the same time,  
omitting even a reference to the odicer answerable for the murder­  
ous aggression, and asserting a claim not less contrary to the Bri­  
tish laws, and British practice, than to the principles and obliga­  
tions of the United States.  
The correspondence between the Department of State and this  
Minister will show, how unessentially the features presented in its  
commencement have been varied in its progress. It will show also,  
that forgetting the respect due to all governments, he did not re­  
frain Jrom imputations on this, which required that no further com­  
munications should be received from him. The necessity of this  
step will be made known to his Britannic Majesty through the Mi­  
nister Plenipotentiary of the United States in London. And it  
would indicate a want of confidence due to a government which so  
well understands and exacts what becomes foreign Ministers near  
it, not to infer that the misconduct of its own .Representative will  
be viewed in the same light, in which it has been regarded here.  
The British government w ill learn, at the same time, that a ready  
attention will be given to communications, through any channel  
which may be substituted. It will be happy, if the change in this  
respect should be accompanied by a favorable revision of the un­  
friendly policy, which has been so long pursued towards the&#x27;  
United States.

gres?? in the Executive, is contained in the correspondence of oii/  
Minister at Paris, now laid before you.  
By some of the other although professing jtisft  
and amicable dispositions, injuries materially affecting our Corn*  
merce have not been duly Controlled or repressed. In these cases*  
the interpositions deemed proper on our part have not been om ;t­  
--ted. But it well deserves ilu: consideration of the Legislature*  
how far both the safety and the holior of the American Hag ii.av K;  
consulted, by adequate provisions against that collusive prostitu­  
tion of it, by individuals, unworthy&#x27; of the American name* which,  
has so much favored the real or pretended suspicions, under whieU  
the honest commerce of their fellow-citizens hu&#x27;s suffered*  
In relation to the powers on the coast of Barbarv, nothing  
has occurred which is not of a nature rather to inspire confu  
than distrust, as to the continuance ofJtfie existing amity. &quot;V  
our Indian neighbors, the just and benevolent system, cent  
i toward them, has also preserved peace, and is more and&#x27;me &#x27;  
advancing habits favorable to their civilization and happiness.  
From a statement which will be made by the Secretin , nj  
War, it will be seen that the fortifications on our-maritime j .  
tier are uVroany of the ports completed; a Hording the del: •  
which was contemplated, and that a fur titer- time vyiil be rerui: ••  
to render complete the works in the Barber of New York, and in  
some other places. By the enlargement of the works, and the e .t­  
--ploymentof a greater number of hands at the public armories, tncT  
supply of small arms, of an improving ouailty, appejrs to be an*  
nually increasing, at a rate, that with those made on private con­  
tract, may be expected to go far towards providing for the public  
exigency.  
The act of Congress providing for the equipment of our vessel?  
of war having been fully carried into execution, [ rele; to the  
statement of the Secretary of the Navy foi the information Which  
may be proper on that subject. To that statement is added a view  
of the transfers of appropriations, authorised by the act of the  
session preceding the last, and of the grounds on which the trans­  
fers were made. ,  
Whatever may be the course of your deliberations oti the sti -  
ject of our military establishments, I should fail in my du;y in  
recommending to your serious, attention the imporiance of giv:  
to our Militia, the great bulwark ot our security, and resourc* :  
our power, an organization the best adapted to eventual   
for which the United States ought to be prepared.  
The sums which had been previously accumulated in tbc  
Treasurv, together with the receipts during the year ending on the  
30th of September last (and amounting to more than nine m liona  
of dollars) have enabled us to fulfill all our engagements, an.-&#x27; to  
defray the current expenses of government without recerrm o  
; any loan. But the insecurity of our commerce, and the conse­  
i quent diminution of the public revenue, will probably produce a  
; deficiency in the receipts of the ensuing year, for whk h, and for*  
other details. I refer to the statements which will be transmit­  
ted from the Treasury.  
In the state which has been presented of our affairs with the  
great panics to a disastrous and protracted war, carried on in SI  
mode equally injurious and unjust to the United States as a neu­  
tral nation, the wisdom of toe National Legislature will be again  
summoned to the important decision cl the alternatives before!  
them. That these will be met in a spirit, worthy the councils of  
a nation, conscious both of its rectitude and of its rights, and  
careful as well of its honor as of its peace, I have an entire con­  
fidence. And that the result will be stamped by a unanimity  
becoming the occasion, and be supported by every portion ot  
our citizens, with a patriotism enlightened and invigorated by ex­  
perience, ought as little to be doubted.  
In the midst of the wrongs and vexations experienced from  
external causes, there i 3 much room for congratulation on the  
prosperity and happiness flowing fr&lt; our. situation at home*  
i The blessing of health has never been more universal* The  
&gt; fruits of the seasons, though in particular aitides and districts  
i short of their usual redundancy, are more than sufficient foi*  
■ our wants and our comforts. The face of our country every where  
presents the evidence of laudable enterprise, of extensive capita!,  
i and of durable improvement. In a cultivation of the materials,  
and the extension of useful manufactures, more especially,  
: in the general application to household fabrics, we behold a  
&gt; rapid diminution of our dependence on foreign supplies. Nor is  
• it unworthy of reflection, that this revolution in our pursuit*  
i and habits is in no slight degree a consequence of those impoli­  
tic and arbitrary Edicts, by which the contending nations, in en­  
&#x27; deavoring each of them to obstruct our trade with the other, have?  
1 so far abridged pur means of procuring the productions and  
&#x27;&lt; nr.factures, of which our own are now taking the place,  
Recollecting always, that for every advantage which may con­  
:&#x27; tribute to distinguish our lot, from that to which others are doom*  
ed by the unhappy spirit of the times, we are indebted to that l)i­  
--• vine Providence whose goodness has been so remarkably-extern !ed  
to this rising nation, it becomes us to cherish a devout grat-kud;-,  
: and to implore from the same omnipotent source a blessing  
the consultations and measures about to be undertaken for thtf  
i welfare oi our beloved countrv.

Fellow Citizens of the Senate and  
of the House of Representatives :  
v A i the period of our last meeting, I had th&#x27;e satisfaction of  
communicating an adjustment with one of tne principal belligerent  
nations, highly important in itself, and still more so as presaging  
a more extended accommodation. It is with deep concern, 1 am  
now to inform you, that the favorable prospect has been overcloud­  
ed, by a refusal of the British government to abide by the act of its  
Minister Plenipotentiary, and by its ensuing policy towards the  
United States, as seen through the communications of the minister  
sent to replace him.  
W haiever pleas may be urged for a disavowal of engagements  
formed by diplomatic functionaries, in cases where by the terms  
ol the engagements a mutual ratification is reserved ; or where no­  
tice at the time may have been given, of a departure from instruc­  
tions ; or in extraordinary cases, essentially violating the princi­  
ples of equity ; a disavowal could not have been apprehended in a  
case, where no such notice or violation existed ; where no such  
ratification was reserved ; and more especially, where, as is now  
in proof, an engagement, to be executed without any such ratifi­  
cation, was contemplated by the instruction* given, and where it  
had, with good faith, been carried into immediate execution, on  
the part of the United States.  
These considerations not having restrained the British go­  
vernment from disavowing the arrangement, by virtue of which its  
Orders in Council vvere to be revoked, and the event authorising  
the renewal of commercial intercourse, having thus not taken place ;  
it necessarily became a question Of equal urgency and importance,  
whether the act prohibiting that intercourse was n«it to be consi­  
dered as remaining in legal force. This question being, after due  
deliberation, determined in the affirmative, a proclamation to that  
effect was issued. It could not but happen, however, that a return  
to this state ol things, from that which had followed an execution of  
the arrangement by the United States, would involve difficulties.  
With a view to diminish these as much as possible, the instruc­  
tions from the Secretary of the Treasury, now laid before you,  
were transmitted to the Collectors ol the several ports. If in per­  
mitting British vessels to depart, without giving bonds not to  
proceed to their own ports, it should appear that the tenor of legal  
authority has not been strictly puffed, it is to be ascribed to the  
anxious desire which was fslt, that no individuals should be injur­  
ed by so unforeseen an occurrence : And 1 rely on the regard of  
Congress for the equitable interests of our own citizens, to adopt  
whatever further provisions may be found requisite, for a general  
remission ol penalties involuntarily incurred.  
! The recall of the disavowed Minister having been followed  
by the appointment of a successor, hopes were indulged that the  
new mission would contribute to alleviate the disappointment  
which had been produced, and to remove the causes which had so  
long embarrassed the good understanding of the two nations. Jt  
could not be doubted, that it would at least be charged with con­  
ciliatory explanations of the step which had been taken, and wiih  
proposals to be substituted lor the rejected arrangements Teason­  
uble and universal as this expectation Was, it also has not been ful­  
filled. From the first official disclosures pi the new Minister, it  
was found that he had received no authority to enter into explana­  
tions relative to either branch of the arrangement disavowed ; nor  
any authority to substitute proposals* as to that branch, which con­  
cerned the British Orders in Council: And finally, that his pro­  
posals with respect to the other branch, the attack on the frigate  
Chesapeake, were founded on a presumption, repeatedly declared  
to be inadmissible by the United States, that the first step tow ards  
adjustment was due from them; the proposals at the same time,  
omitting even a reference to the oUicer answerable for the murder­  
ous aggression, and asserting a claim not less contrary to the Bri­  
tish idWs, and British practice, than to the principles and obliga­  
tions of the United States.  
The correspondence between the Department of State and this  
Minister will show, how unessentially the features presented in its  
commencement have been varied in its progress. It will show also,  
that forgetting the respect due to all governments, he did not re­  
frain irom imputations on this, which required that no further com­  
munications should be received from him. &#x27;1 he necessity of this  
step will be made known to his Britannic Majesty through the Mi­  
nister Plenipotentiary of the United States in London. And it  
would indicate a want of confidence due to a government which so  
. well understands and exacts what becomes foreign Ministers near  
it. not to infer thai the misconduct of its own Representative will  
be viewed in the same light, in which iihas beui regarded heie.  
The British government v\ ill learn, at the same time, that a readv  
attention will be given to communications, through any channel  
which may be substituted. It will be happy, if the change in this  
respect should be accompanied by a favorable revision of the un­  
friendly policy, which has been so long pursued towards the  
United States.  
With France, the other belligerent, whose trespasses on our  
commercial rights have long been the subject of our just remon­  
strances the posture ol our relations does not correspond with the  
measures, taken on the part ol tne United States, to electa favor­  
able change. Ihe result of the several communications made to  
her government, in pursuance ol the authorities vested by Con­  
  
gross in the Executive, is contained in the correspondence of otit  
&#x27;Minister at Paris, now laid before you.  
B\ some ol the oilier belligerents, although professing just  
and amicable dispositions, injuries materially affecting cur com­  
merce have not been duly controlled or repressed. In these eases,  
the interpositions deemed proper on our part have net been omit­  
ted. But it well destrves the consideration of the Legislature*  
how far both &#x27;he sa&#x27;.etv and the honor of the American flag may be  
consulted, b) adt 41111 te provisions against that collusive prostitu­  
tion of it, by individuals, unworthy of the American name, which  
has so n-uch favored tin real or pretended suspicions, under which,  
the 1 honest commerce of their fellow-citizens has suffered.  
* In relation to the pouers on the e &gt;ast of Barbary, nothing  
has occurred whn h is rot ol a nature rather to inspire confidence  
than distrust, as to the continuance of the existing amitj. With  
our Indian neighbors, the just and b&lt; ncvof nt system, continu­  
ed toward them, has also preserved peace, and is more and more  
advancing habits lav &gt;rab!c to their civilization and happiness.  
From a statement whicn will be nnftje by the Secretary of  
War, it will be seen that the fortifications on wur maritime fron­  
tier are in many of the ports con p.&lt; ted; affording the defence  
which was contemplated, and that a further time will be required  
to render complete the works in the harbor of New-York, and ia  
some other place?. By the cnlargenu nr 0! the works, and the em­  
ployment of a . reater number of hands at the public armories, the  
supply of small arms, of an improving quality, appears to be an­  
nually increasing, at a rate, that with those made on private con­  
tract, may be expected to go fur towards providing for the public  
exigency.  
The act of Congress providing for the equipment ol our vessels  
of war having been fully carried into execution, I refer to the  
statement 01 the Secretary of the Navy foi the information which,  
may be proper on that subject. To tiiat statement is added a view  
of the transfers of appropriations, authorised by the act ol the  
session preceding the last, and ol the grounds On which the trans­  
fers were made.  
Whatever may be the course of your deliberations on the sub­  
ject of our military establishments, 1 should fail in my duly in not  
recommending to your serious attention the importance ol giving  
to our Militia, the great bulwark ol our security, and .esourie of  
our power, an organization the best adapted to.eventual situations  
ior which the United States ought to be prepared.  
The sums which had been previously accumulated in the  
Treasury, together with the receipts during the year ending on the  
30th of September last (and amounting to more than nine millions  
of dollars) have enabled us to fulfill all our engagements, aim to  
defray the current expellees of government without recufVing to  
any loan. But the insecurity of our commerce, and the Conse­  
quent diminution of the public revenue, will probably produce a  
deficiency in the receipts of the ensuing year, for which, and for  
other details, I reler to the statements which will be transmit­  
ted from the Treasury.  
In the state Which has been presented of our affairs with the  
great parties to a disastrous and protracted war, carried on in a  
mode equally injurious and unjust to the United States as a neu­  
tral nation, the wisdom of the National Legislature will be again  
summoned to the important decision ot the alternatives before  
them. That these wiH be met in a spirit, worthy the councils of  
a nation, conscious both of its rectitude and of its rights, and  
careful as well of its honor as of its peace, I have an entire con­  
fidence. And that the result will be stamped by a unanimity  
becoming the occasion, and be supported by every portion of  
our citizens, with a patriotism enlightened and invigorated by ex­  
perience, ought as little to be doubted.  
In the midst of the wrongs and vexations experienced from  
external causts, there is much room for congratulation on the  
prospeiity and happiness flowing from our situation at home.  
The blessing of health has never been morf universal. The  
fruits ol the seasons, though 111 particular ai tides and districts  
short of their usual redundant y, are more than sufficient for  
our wants and our comforts, Thf face of otir country every where  
presents the evidence ol laudable enterprise, of extensive capital,  
and of durable improvement. In a ultivation of the materials,  
and the extension of useful ma; uiactures, more   
111 the general application to household fabrics, we behold a  
rapid diminution of our dependence on foreign supplies. Nor is  
it unworthy of reflection, that this revolution in our pursuits  
and habits is in 110 slight degree a consequence of those impoli­

Recollecting always, that for every advantage which may con­  
tribute to distinguish our lot, from that to which others are eloom­  
ed by the unhappy spirit of the times, we are indebted to that Di­  
vine Providence whose goodness has been so remarkably extended  
to this rising nation, it becomes lis to cherish a devout gratitude,  
and to implore Irom the same omnipotent source a blessing on  
the consultations and measures about to be undertaken for the  
welfare o* our beloved country.

cf the House of Representatives :  
At the^period of our last meeting, l had  
the satisKfction of communicating an adjust­  
ment with one of the principal belligerent  
nations, highly important in itself, arid still  
more so as presaging a more extended ac­  
commodation. It is with deep concern, lam  
tiow to inform you, that the favorable pros­  
pect has been overclouded, by a refusal of the  
British government to abide by the act of  
its Mihistcr Plenipotentiary, and by itif en­  
duing policy t^vards the United States, as  
s£en through the communications of the mi­  
nister sent tore-place hitii.  
Whatever pleas rtiay be urged for a disa­  
  
/cr.vai oi engagements lorimru uy  
*.c functionaries, in cases where, by the terms  
of the engagements, a mutual ratification is  
reserved ; or where notice at the time may  
have been given, of a departure from in­  
structions; or iu extraordinary cases, es­  
sentially&#x27; violating the principles of ccpiitv ;  
a disavowal could not have been apprehen­  
ded in a case, where no such notice or vio­  
lation existed ; where ho such ratification  
was reserved ; and, more especially, where,  
as is now in proof, an engagement, to be ex­  
ecuted without any such ratification, was  
contemplated by the instructions given, and  
where it had, with good faith, been carried  
Into hmnt&#x27;diate execution, On the part of the  
U Sti tcs.  
These considerations not having restrain­  
ed the British goVernmcnt from disavowing  
the arrangement, by virtue of which, Its  
Orders in Council were to be revoked, and  
the event authorising the renewal ot com­  
mercial intercourse, having thus not taken  
place ; it necessarily became a question of  
equal urgency and importance, whether the  
act prohibiting lhat,imercourse was not to be  
considered as remaining in legal torcc. This  
question bein£,-after due deliberation, deter­  
mined in the affirmative, a proclamation td  
that effect was issued. It could not hut hap­  
pen, however, that a return to this state of  
things, from that which had followed an i xe­  
tulion of the arrangement by the U. Slates,  
would involve difficulties. With a view to  
diminish these as much as possible, the in­  
structions from the Secretary oftheTreasii*  
vy, now laid before you, were transmitted to&quot;  
the Collectors of the several pot’ts. If i i  
permitting British vessels to depart, without  
giving beads not to proceed to their own  
ports, it should appear that the tenor of le­  
gal authority has not been strictly! pursued, it  
is to be ascribed totbc anxious desire which  
v. as felt, that no individuals should be injur*  
rd by so unforeseen an occurrence : And 1 re­  
ly on the regai &lt;1 of Congress for ific equitable  
interests of our own citizens, to ail ?pt what­  
ever further provision^ may be found rvqifl­  
Mte, fora general remission oi penalties in­  
voluntarily incurred.  
I lie recall of the disavowed minister ha­  
ving been followed by the appointmt nt of  
a successor, hopes were indulged, &#x27;.hat The*  
new mission would contribute&quot;^ alleviate  
the disappointment which had been produc­  
ed, r.ml to remove the pauses which hadsh  
ong embarrassed the good understandim* of  
  
’ sun nations. It could not be doubled,  
that jt would at least be cha+ged with con’  
cilia Lory explanations of tHc step which h.td  
Wwt&#x27;ii taken, ami with proposals to bt+&#x27;subkti*  
tnted for the rejected arrangement. Hea­  
tri-.ii.bJe and universal as this expectation  
&#x27;vas u also has not been fulfilled. From  
the first official disclosure of the new minis­  
tei- it was found, that he had received no  
authority to enter into explanations relative  
toother branch of the arrangement disa­  
vowed; nor any authority to substitute pro­  
pofals, as tothat branch, which concerned  
i .uW °rders in Council : And final­  
Yj fhat his proposals wi&#x27;h respect to the  
hrinfeH, thtf atL?**k on tfcc f&lt; !j i&#x27;.c CliOs*  
  
apeake, were founded on a presumption,  
repeatedly declared to be inadmissible by  
the United States, that the first step towards  
adjustment was due from them ; the propo­  
sals, at the same time, omitting even a re­  
ference to the officer answerable for the  
murderous aggression, and assenting a claim  
hot less contrary to the British laws, and  
British practice, than to the principles dud  
obligations of the United States.  
The correspondence between the depart­  
ment of State and this minister, will show  
how unessentially the features presented ih  
its commencement have been varied. in its  
progress. It will show also, that forgetting  
tlie respect due to all governments, lie did  
not refrain from imputations on this, which  
required, that no further communications  
should be received from him. The necessi­  
  
ty ot this dep will be made known to his  
Britannic majesty, through the minister ple­  
nipotentiary of the U. Suites in London.—  
Anti it would indicate a Want of confidence  
due to a government, which so well under­  
stand? and exacts what becomes foreign r.si­  
nisters neat&#x27; it* not to Inter, that the miscon­  
duct of its own representative will^he view­  
ed in the same light, in which it has bt _*n  
regarded here. The British government  
will learn, at the same time* that a ready  
attention will be givrn to communications,  
through any channel wh ich may be substi­  
tuted. It will be happy, if the change in  
this respect should be accompanied by a  
favorable revision of the unfriendly policy,  
which has been so long pursued towards the  
United States.  
Witft Franfce, the other belligerent, whose  
trespasses on our commercial rights have  
long been the subject of our just remonstrant  
ces, the posture of our relations does not cor­  
respond with the measures, taken on the pan  
of tile U. States, to effect a favorable change.  
rl he result of the several communications  
made to her government, in pursuance of  
the authorities vested by Congress in the  
Kxecuiive, is contained in the correspon­  
dence of our M inifitc**at PAriSj i4ow laid bc­  
ft)l v? ^ Oil. •  
By snore or the other belligerents. althoOgh  
professing just and amicable. dispositions, in­  
juries materially affecting our i ommerrfe  
have not been duly controlled or repressed.  
In these cases, the interpositions deemed  
proper on ottr part hat’fe not liecri omitted.  
But it well deceives the consideration of the  
Legislature, how far both the safety and the  
honor of the American flag may tie consulted,  
by adequate provisions against tliat collusive  
prostitution of it, by ind.vit^ials, unworthy r,f  
the American name, which lias somudi fa­  
vored the real or piVtended suspicions, under  
which the honest commerce of their fellow­  
ctisens has Suffered. i  
In relation to the powers bn the coast of  
tSarbary, nothing has occurred which is not  
ot ;* nature rather to inspire confidence than  
distrust, as to the continuance of the existing  
amity. With our Indian neighbors, the just  
ami benevolent system, continued toward  
tlu qi, has also preserved peace, and is fnove  
and more advancing habits favoruble to their  
civ ib/.aiou and happiness.  
  
rmni a statement which vtfj’1 be made bf  
the Secretary r.f VVar, it will J.~ u-&lt;!n that  
the forlifiCali(&gt;.*4 on ottr maritime front icf  
aie in many &lt;». the ports completed ; atfoil­  
ing the defence which was contemplated,  
and ihat a further time will be required to  
render complete the works in tfie harbor of  
New York, and in some after piece*. Jtv  
tire enlargement of the! worklf, and tin­  
ploymentufa greater number of hands at tb •  
public armories, the supply of small m ins,  
of dn improying quality, appears to be annu­  
ally increasing, at a rate, that with tlu.se  
made on private contract, may bn expected  
to go far towards providing for the public  
exigency.  
TLc dot af Cfcngrces providing fvr the c­  
  
equipment of our vessels of war liaving beeii  
tally carried into execution, l refer to the!  
statement of tlte Secretary of the Navy for  
the information which may be proper on  
that subject. To that statement is added A  
view of tJie transfers of apprdjm&#x27;atioiss, au­  
thorised by the act of the session preceding  
the last, and of the grounds on which the  
transfers were triade.  
Whatever may be the course of your de­  
liberations on the subject of our military es­  
tablishments, I should tail in my duty in not  
i ecommending to your serious attention tlw*  
importance ot&#x27; giving to our Militia, the  
great bulwark of our security, and resource  
of our power, an organization the best adap*­  
ted to eventual situations fdv which the U;  
Slates ought to be prepared.  
  
’ nc imm which had been previously ac«  
cumulated in the Treasury, together with  
the receipts during the yqar ending on the  
20th of September last (and amounting to  
more than nine millions of dollars,) have en­  
abled us to fulfil all our engagements, and  
to defray the current expences of govern­  
ment withhtit recurring to any loan, llut the  
insecurity of our commerce, and the conse­  
quent diminution of the public revenue, will  
probably produce a deficiency in the receipts  
of the ensuing year, for which, and for other  
details, I refer to the statements which will  
be transmitted from the Treasury.  
In the state which has been presented of  
&#x27;hr affairs with the great parties to a disas­  
trous and protracted war, carried on in a  
mode equally injurious and unjust to the U.

more than sufficient for our wants and out*

terials, and the extension cf useful niai.u­

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
Fellow Citizens of the Senate and  
of the House of Representatives .  
AT the period cf our Inst meeting,  
I had the satisfaction of communicat­  
ing an adjustment with one of the prin­  
cipal belligerent nation^ highly im­  
portant in itself, and still more so as  
presaging”*! more extended accommo­  
d ition. It is with deep concern, I am  
now to inform you, that the favorable  
prospect has b:-en overclouded, by a  
veiusal of the British government tOa­  
bide bv the act of its Minister Pleni  
notemiary, and by its ensuing policy  
towards the United States, as seen  
.through the communications of the mi­  
nister sent to replace him.  
Ill_ _ ♦ _ i. i r  
  
uatcv^i |;uua may uu ui iui a  
disavowal of engagements formed by  
diplomatic functionaries, in cases  
where by the terms of the engagement^  
a mutual ratification is reserved; or  
Where notice at the time may have been  
t cn. of a departure from instructi­  
ons ; or in extraordinary cases, essen­  
tially violating the principles of equi­  
ty ; a disavowal could not have been  
apprehended in a case, where no such  
notice or violation existed ; where no  
■ buch ratification was reserved ; and  
^ more especially, where, as is now in  
proof, an engagement, to be executed  
without any such ratification, was con•  
^ rm plated by the instructions given,  
V ‘an 1 where it had, with good faith, been  
^ carried into immediate execution, oil  
the part of the United States.  
These considerations not having re­  
strained the Uritish government from  
disavowing the arrangement, by virtue  
oi which us Orders in Council were to  
i’e revoked, and the event authorising  
tiie renewal of commercialintercourse,  
  
naving uius not lateen piace ; it neces­  
sarily became a question of equal ur­  
gency and importnace, whether the act  
prohibiting that intercourse was not to  
be considered as remaining in legal  
force. This question being, after due  
deliberation, determined in the affirma­  
tive, a proclamation to that effect  
■• is issued. It could not but happen,  
however, that a return to this state of  
..*!rig3, from that which had followed  
in execution of the arrangement hv the  
1 Tnited States, would involve difficul­  
Ji; 3. With a view to diminish these  
&#x27;• much as possible, the instruction^  
tin* Secretary of the Treasury,  
iow l.i,d before you, were transmitted  
It j tfie Collectors of the several ports,  
if in permitting iiritish vessels to de­  
part, without giving bonds not to pro*  
r* «d to their own ports, it should sip*  
3  
  
3Lr3cac*ix  
pear that the tenor of legal authority  
has not been strictly pursued, it is to be  
ascribed to the anxious desire which  
was felt, that no in lividuals should be  
injured by so unforeseen an occur­  
rence : And I rely on the regard of  
Cougrcss for the eiqui table interest of  
our own citizens, to adopt whatever  
further provisions may be found requi­  
site, for a general remission of penal­  
ties involuntarily incurred.  
The recall of the disavowed Minis­  
ter having been followed by the ap­  
pointment of a si^ccessor; hopes were  
indulged that the rvfcw mission would  
contrib :te to alleviate the disappoint­  
ment which had been produced, &amp; to re­  
move the causes which had so long  
embarrassed the good understanding  
of the two nations. It could not be  
doubted, that it would at least be  
charged with conciliatory explanations  
of the step which had been taken, and  
with proposals to be substituted for  
the rejected arrangement. Reasona­  
ble and universal as this expectation  
....... u.... ..i.. r.-icii .j  
  
From the first official disclosures of&#x27;  
the new Minister, it was found that he  
had received no authority to enter in­  
to explanations relative to either branch  
of the arrangement disavowed ; nor  
any authority to substitute proposals,  
as to that branch, which concerned tire  
British Orders in Council: And fi­  
nally, that his proposals with respect  
to the other branch, the attack on the  
frigate Chesapeake, were founded on  
a presumption, repeatedly declared to  
be inadmissible by the United States,  
that the first step towards adjustment  
was due from them ; the proposals at  
die same time, emitting even a refer­  
ence to the officer answerable for die  
murderous aggression, and assrting a  
claim not less contrary to the British  
laws, and British practice, than to the  
principles and obligations of the Unit*  
ed States.  
The correspondence between the  
Department of State and this M inister  
will show, bow unessentially the fea­  
tures presented in its commencement  
  
have been varied in its progress. It  
will show also, that forgetting the re­  
spect due to all governments, lie  
did not refrain from imputations on  
this, which required that no further  
communications should he received  
from him. The necessity of this step  
will he made known to his Britannic  
Majesty through the Minister Pleni­  
potentiary of the United States in  
London. And it would indicate a want  
of confidence due to a government  
which so well understands and exacts  
what becomes foreign Ministers near  
it, not to infer that the misconduct of  
its own Representative will he viewed  
in the same light, in which it has been  
regarded here. The British govern­  
ment will learn, at the same time, that  
a ready attention will he given to com­  
munication*, through any channel  
  
which may be substituted. It will be  
happy, if the change in this, respect  
should be accompanied by a favorable  
revision of the unfriendly policy, which  
has been so long pursued towards the  
United States.  
With France, the other belligerent,  
whose trespasses on our commercial  
rights have long been the snbject of  
our just remonstrances, the posture of  
our relations does not correspond with  
the measures, taken on the part of the  
United States, to effect a favorable  
change. The result of the several com­  
munications made to her government,  
in pursuance of the authorities vested  
by Congress in the Executive, is con­  
tained in the correspondence of our  
Minister at Paris, now laid before you.  
By some of theoih er belligerents, alt ho*  
professing just and amic. ble dispositions  
inju; 148 m aerially affefiling our commerce  
have not been duly con-roled or repres.  
s?d. In these cases, the intei positions  
deemed proper on our part have not been  
om i&#x27;.tid. But it well deserves (he consid­  
eration »f the L&#x27;-gisla uie how far both  
till* Li. f. I u o nr! f br.nnn o f r I, ^ A rv\ amiaam  
  
flag may be consubed, by adequate  
piovisions against that collusive prostitu­  
tion of it, by individuals, unworthy of  
the American name, which has so much  
favored the real or p’etended suspici­  
ons, under which the honest com met ce  
of &#x27;litir fellow, citizens has suffered.  
In relation to the p»we a of the coast  
of Barbary, nothing has occurred which  
is not of a nature rather to inspire con­  
fidence than distrun, as to the omtinu*  
atice of the exis ing amity. With our  
Indian neighbor*, the ju-»t and benevolent  
system, continued toward rhem. has also  
pteseived peace, and is mate and more  
advancing lrabits favorable to their civili­  
zation and happiness.  
From a statement which will be made  
b&gt; the Secretary of War, it will be seen  
that the fortifications cp our maritime fron.  
tier are in many of the ports completed ;  
affording the defence which v an content.  
pl.Ved, and that a further time will he re­  
quir&lt;d to render complete the woiks in  
the harbor of New Yoik, and in some o.  
ther places. Ily the enlargement ot the  
woiks. and the emploj menl of a greater  
number of hands at the public armories,  
the supply of small arms, of an improving  
  
iw mmuiuiy  
al a rate, that with those made c.*h pri.  
\a;e contiafcl, may he cxpc&amp;ed logo far  
to vards providing for the public cxigen.  
cy.  
1 he a£l of Congress providing far the  
equipment of our vessels of war having  
been fully carried into execution, I refer  
to the statement of the Secretary of the  
Navy for the information which may be  
proper on that subje6\. To that state­  
mem is added a vew of the transfers  
of appropriations, authorised by the ac\
of the si/sion preceding the last, and of  
the grounds on which the transfers were  
made.  
Whatever may be the course of your  
deliberations on the subject ol our military  
establishments, I should fail in my duty  
in not recommending to your serious at.  
tention the importance of giving to our  
Militia; the great bulwaik of our security,  
  
k resource of our power, in an organization • ,  
the best adapted to eventual situations for j  
which the United States ought to be pre^  
pared.  
The sums which had been previously  
accumulated in the Treaasury, together  
with the receipts during the year ending  
on the 30th of September last (and a­  
mounting to more than nine millions of  
dollars) have enabled us to fulfil all our  
engagements, and to defray the current  
expenses of government without recur,  
ring to any loan. But the insecurity olour  
commerce, and the consequent dimin uti.  
on of the public revenue, will probably  
produce a&#x27; deficiency in the receipts of  
lh« ensuing year, lor which, and lor o*  
ther details, I refer to the statements  
which will be transmitted from the Tica*  
sury.  
In the state which has been presented  
oi oUr aifairs with the great parties to %  
d sastroua and protracted war, curried on  
in a mode equally injurious and unjust to &#x27;  
the United States as a neutral nation, the  
wisdom of the National Legislature will  
be again summoned to the important de­  
• u.. ___ i_ _. _,  
  
That these will be met in a spirit, worthy  
the councils of a nation, conscious bob cf  
its rectitude and of its rights, and careful  
as well of its honor as of its peace,  
1 have an entire confidence And that  
the result will be stamped by a unanimi­  
ty becoming the occasion, and be .suppor­  
ted by every portion of our citizens, wnli  
a patriotism enlightened u.id invigotat-d  
by experience, ought as little to be donot&quot;  
ed.  
In the midst of the wrongs and vex*ti« ;  
ens experienced from external cau es, ,h.r&lt;*  
is much room for congra ula ion on the  
prosperity and happiness (lowing from our  
situation at home. The bless ing of heal.h  
has never been more universal. The  
Iruits of the seasons, though in particular  
articles and distn£ls short of their usual  
redundancy, are more than sufficient for  
our wants and our comforts. The face of  
our | country every where presen s the evu &#x27;  
dunce of laudable enterprise, of extensiva  
capital, and ot durable improvement, in  
a cultivation of the materials, and the ex­  
tension ef useful manufactures, more es­  
pecially, in the general application to  
household fabrics, we hold a lapid dimi- 1  
tiution of our dependence on foreign sup­  
plies- Nor is it worthy of reflection, that  
  
this revolution m our pursuits and habits ■  
is in no slight degree a consequence of ■

times, we are indebted to that Divine Pio*V

Fellow-Citizens of the Senate, A 2 s  
| and of the Hoyf: of Representatives, =~  
&#x27;/ At the period of our late meeting,l  
had the fatisfa&amp;ion of commu’dnic.ating  
an adjultment with one of the princi­  
pal belligerent nations, highly impor­  
tant in itfelf, and still more so, as pres.  
&quot; aging a more extended accommoda­  
tion. It is with deép concern, lam  
- now-to inform you, that the favorable  
profpe® has been overclouded, by z  
refufal of the Britith government to  
_abide by the a&amp; of its Minister Ple.  
nipotentiary, and by its ensuing policy  
towards the \United States 4s seen  
through the communications of the  
minister sent to replace him. ‘  
Whatever pleas may bé urged for  
a disavowal of engagements formed  
by diplomatic fanctionaries, in cases  
where by the terms of the engages  
ments a mutual ratification is reserv­  
ed ; or wheré noticé at the time may  
~ have been given, of a departore from  
_inftruions ; or in extraordinary ‘cafes,  
essentially violating the principles of  
i equity ; a disavowal coufd not have  
. been apprehended in a case, where no  
such notice or violation existed ;  
- where no such ratification was referv­  
- ed ; and more especially, where, as is  
&#x27; now in proof, an engagement, to be  
&#x27; executed without anvy such ratification,  
~ was contemplated by the infiru&amp;@ions  
given, and wheré it had, with good  
faith, been carried into immediate ex­  
ecution, on the part of the U. States.  
These considerations not having  
refirained the Britifr government  
from disavowiag the arrangement by  
virtue of which its Orders in Council  
were to be revoked, and the event au­  
thorifing the renewal of commerciall  
intercourse, having thus not taken  
place ; it necessarily became a quest­  
ion of equal urgency and importancey  
whether the aét prohibiting that inter«  
course was not&#x27;to be considered asre«  
maining in legal force. This questions  
being, after due deliberation, deter­  
mined in the affirmative, a proclama­  
tion ‘to that effe@ was ifflued. It  
could not but happen, however, that  
a return to this state of things, from  
that which bad followed an execution  
of the arrangement by the United  
States, would iavolve difficulties.  
With a view to diminish these as muck  
as possible, the inftu&amp;tions from the  
Sécretary - of « the- Treasury, now  
laid before yog, were tranimitted to&#x27;  
‘the Colle&amp;ormf the several ports.  
~~TIf in permitting Britith veflels to  
- depart, without giving bonds not to  
- proceed to their own ports, it should  
- appear thatthe tenor of legal avthor­  
ity bas not been firiétly pursued, it is  
to be ascribed to the anxious desire  
. which was felt, that no individuals  
fheuld be injured by so unforefeen an  
oxcurrence : And I rely on the regard  
- of Congress for the equitable intercfis  
of our awn citizens to adopt whatever  
‘further provitions may be found re­  
quisite, for a general remission of pens  
. alties involuntarily incurred. |  
. The recall of the disavowed Mini«  
f¥er having been followed by the. ap­  
pointment of a successor, hopes were  
_indulged that the new wifion would

want of confidence due to .a govern­

Viewed in the fame light, in which it™  
Bas been regarded here. The British  
fjovernment&#x27; will learn at the fame  
time, that a ready attesrition will be  
given to communications through a­

It will be happy if the change in this  
refpe@ should be accompanied by . a  
favorable regifion of the unfriendly  
policy, which has been so long ptirfu­  
ed towards the United States.  
With France, the other belligerent,  
whose trespasses on our commercial  
rights have long been the fubje&amp; of  
our jult remonfirances, the posture of  
our relations does not correspond with  
the measures taken on the part of the  
U. States, to effelt a favorable change.  
The result of the several communica­  
tions made to her government, in  
puzfuance of the authorities vested by  
Congress in the Executive, is contain­  
ed in the correspondence of our min­  
_ifter at Paris, now laid before you.  
By some of the other belligerents  
althodgh profefling jult and amieable  
dispositions, injuries materially affe&amp;-  
ing our commerce have not been duly  
controled or reprefled. In these cases  
the interpositions deemed proper on  
our part have not been omitted. Bat  
it well deserves the consideration of  
the Legislature, how far both the fafe­  
ty and the honor of the American  
flag may be consulted by adequate  
provisions against that collusive pros­  
titution of it, by individuals, unwor­  
thy of the American name which has  
so much favored the real or pretended  
suspicions, uader which the honest  
commerce of their fellow citizens has_  
fuffered.  
In relation to the powers on the coast of  
Birbary, nothing has occurred which is not  
of a nature rather to inspire confidence  
than distrust, as to the continuance of the  
existing amity, With our Indian ncigh­  
bours, the jnft and benevolent {yltem con­  
tinned toward them. has allo preserved  
peace, and is more and more advancing ha.

From a ffatement which will be made by  
~ the Secretary of war, it will be seen that the  
fortifications on our maritime frontier are  
ip many of the ports completed ; affording  
ihe defence which was contemplated, and  
that further time will be required to render  
complete the works in the harbour of New  
¥ork, and in some other places. By the en-  
Jargement of the works, and the employ­  
ment of a greater ppmber of bands at the  
public armories, the supply of small arms, of  
an improving quality,appears to be annually  
increasing, at a ratey that with thofé made

Fellow-citizene of the Senate,  
  
and of the House of Refiresentatives,  
  
At the period of our last meeting, I  
had the satisfaction of communicating an  
adjustment with one of the principal belli-  
gerent nations, highly important in itself.  
and still more so, as presaging a more ex-  
tended accommodation. It is with deep  
concern, I am now to inform you, that the  
favorable prospect has been overclouded,  
by a refusal of the British government to  
abide by the act of its Minister Plenipo-  
tentiary, and by its ensuing policy towards  
the United States, as seen through the  
communication of the minister sent to re-  
place him.  
  
Whatever pleas may be urged for a dis-  
avowal of engagements formed by diplo-  
matic functionaries, in cases where by the  
terms of the engagements a mutual ratifi-  
cation is reserved ; or where notice at the  
time may have been given, of a departure  
from instructions ; or 1a extraordinary ca-  
ses, essentially violating the principles of  
equity ; a disavowal could not have becn  
apprehended in a case, where ne such no-  
tice or violation existed ; where no such  
ratification was reserved ; and more espe-  
cially, where, as is now in proof, an engage-  
ment, to be executed without any such  
ratification, was contemplated by the in-  
structions given, and where it had, with  
good faith, been carried into immediate ex-  
ecution, on the part of the United States.  
  
These considerations not having restrain-  
ed the British government from disuvow-  
ing the arrangement, by virtue of which  
its Orders in Council were to be revoked,  
and the event authorising the renewal of  
comunercial intercourse, having thus not  
taken place; it vecessurily &#x27;s came a ques-  
tion of «qual urgency sod importance,  
whether the act probibiing that toter-  
course, was not to be considered as re-  
maining in leyal force. ‘This question be-  
ing, alter duc deliberation, determpined in  
  
  
  
the aflipmative, @ proclamation to that ef-  
  
fect was issued. It could not but happen,  
however, that a return to this state of  
things, from: that which had followed an  
execution of the arrangement by the Uni-  
ted States, would involve difficulties.—  
With a view to diminish these as much as  
possible, the instructions from the Secre-  
tary of the ‘Treasury, now laid before you,  
were transmitted to the Collectors of the  
several ports. If in permitting British  
vessels to depart, without giving bonds not  
to proceed to their own ports, it should ap-  
pear that the tenor of Iegal authority has  
not been strictly pursued, it is to be ascri-  
bed to the anxious desire which was felt,  
that no individuals should be injured by so  
unforeseen an occurrence: »And I rely  
on the regard of Congress for the equita-  
ble interests of our own citizens, to adopt  
whatever further provisions may be found  
  
requisite, for a general remission of penal- j  
  
ties involuntarily incurted.  
  
The recall of the disavowed Minister  
having been followed by the appointment  
of a successor, hopes were indulged that  
the new mission would contribute to alle-  
viate the disappointment which had been  
produced, and to remove the causes which  
had so tong embarrassed the good under-  
standing of the two nations. It could not  
be doubted, that it would at least be char-  
ged with conciliatory explanations of the  
step which had been taken, and with pro-  
posals to be substituted for the rejected ar-  
rangement. Reasonable and universal as  
this expectation was. it also kas not been  
fulfilled. From the first official disclosures  
of the new Minister, it was found that he  
had received no authority to enter into ex-  
planations relative to either branch of the  
arrangement Cisavowed ; nor any authori-  
ty to substitute proposals, as to that branch,  
which concerned the British Orders in  
Council: And finally, that his proposals  
with respect to the other branch, the attack  
on the frigate Chesapeake, were founded  
‘on a presumption repeatedly declared to be  
inadmissible by the United States, that the  
first step towards adjustment was due from  
them; the proposals at the same time, o-  
mitting even a reference to the officer an-  
swerable for the murderous aggression,  
and asserting a claim not less contrary to  
the British laws,and British practice, than  
to the principles and obligations of the U-  
nited States.  
  
The correspondence between the De-  
partment of State and this Minister will  
show how unessentially the features pre-  
sented in its commencement have been va-  
ried in its progress. It will show also,  
that forgetting the respect due to all gov-  
ernments, he did not refrain from imputa-  
tions on this, which required that no fur-  
ther communications should be reccived  
from him. The necessity ofthis step will  
be made kaown to his Britannic Majesty  
through the Minister Plenipotentiary of  
the United States in London. And it  
would indicate a want of ¢onfidence due  
to the government which so well under-  
stands aud exacts what becomes foreign  
Ministers near it; hot to infer that the:  
misconduct of its own Representative will  
be viewed inthe same light, in which it  
has been regarded here. The British  
government will learn, at the same time,  
that a ready attention wil] be given to com-  
munications, through any channel which  
may be substituted. It will be happy, if  
the change in this respect should be ac-  
companied by a favorab!e revision of the  
untriendly policy, which has been so long  
pursued towards the United States.  
  
With France, the other belligerent,  
whose trespasses op our commercial rights  
have long been the subject of our just re-  
monstrances, the posture of our relations  
does not correspond with the mcasures  
tuken on the part of the United States, to  
effect a favorable change. The result of  
the several eommunications made to her  
government im pursuance of the authori-  
ties vested by Congress in the Executive,  
is contained in the correspondence of our  
Minister at Paris, now laid before you.  
  
By some of the other belligerents, al-  
though professing just and amicable dis-  
positions, injuries materially affecting our  
commerce have not been duly controlled  
or repressed. In these cases, the inter-  
positions deemed proper on our part have  
not been omitted. But it well deserves  
the consideration of the Legislature, how  
far both the safety and honor of the A-  
merican flag may be consulted, by ade-  
quate provisions against that collusive  
prostitution of it, by individuals, unworthy  
of the American name, which has so much  
favored the real or pretended suspicions,  
under which the honest commerce of their  
fellow citizens have suffered,  
  
In relation to the powers on the coast of  
Barbary, nothing has occurred which is  
not of a nature rather to inspire confidence  
than distrust, as to the coutinuance of the  
existing amity. With our Indian neigh-  
bors, the just and benevolent system, con-  
tinued towards them, has also preserved  
peace, and is’ more and more advancing,  
habits favorable to their civilization and  
happiness.  
  
een a statemem which will be made  
by the secretary of war, it will be seen that  
the fortifications on our maritime frontier  
are in Many of the ports completed ; at-  
fording the defence which was contem-  
plated, and that further time will be re-  
quired to render complete the works in  
the harbor of New-York, and in some oth-  
er places. By the chlargement of the  
works, and the employment of a greater  
number Uf hands at the public armories  
the supply of snail aris, of an improving  
quality, appears to be unuually increasing,  
at a Pate, that with those nade on private  
contracts, may be expected to go tut tor  
wards providing for the public exigency.  
  
The act of Congress providing for the  
equipment ef our vessels of war having  
been fully catred inte executiun, 1 refer  
  
  
  
  
  
to the statement of the Secretary of the  
Navy for the information which may be,  
proper on that subject. To that. state-  
ment is added a view of the transfers of  
appropriations, authorised by the act of  
the session preceding the last and of the  
grouads on which the transfers were made.  
  
Whatever may be the course of your  
deliberations on the subject of our military  
establishments, I should fail in my duty  
in not recommending to your serious at-  
tention the importance of giving to our  
militia the great bulwark of our security,  
and resource of our power, an organiza-  
tien the best adapted to eventual situations  
for which the United Statés ought tu be  
prepared.  
  
The sums which had been previously  
accumulated in the Treasury, together  
With the receipts during the year ending  
on the 30th of September Jast (and a-  
mounting to more than nine millions of  
dollars) have enabied as to fulfil all our  
engagements, and to defray the current  
expences of government witiuut recurring  
to any loan. But the insecurity of our  
commerce, and the consequent diminu-  
tion of the public revenue, will probably  
produce a deficiency in the receipts of the  
ensuing year, fur which, and for other de-  
tails, I refer to the statements which will  
be transmitted fromthe Lreasury.  
  
In the state which has been presented  
of our affairs with the great parties to a  
disastrous and protracted war, carried on  
in a mode equally injurious and- unjust to  
the United States as a*neutral nation, the  
wisdom of the National Legislature will  
be again summoned to the important de-  
cision of the alternatives before them.—  
That these will be met in a spirit, worthy  
the councils of a nation, conscious both of  
rectitude and of its rights, and careful as  
well of its honour as of its peace, I have  
an entire confidence. And thatthe result  
will be stamped by a unanimity becoming  
the occasion and be supported by every  
portion of our citizens, with a patriotism  
enlightened and invigorated by experience,  
ought as little to be doubted.  
  
In the midst of the wrongs and vexa-  
tions experienced from external causes,  
there is much room for congratulation on  
the prosperity and happiness fowing from  
our situation at home. The blessings of  
health have never been. more universal.  
The fruits of the seasons though in par-  
ticular articles and districts short of their  
redundancy, are more than sufficient for  
our wants and our comforts. The face  
of our country every where presents the  
evidence of lsudable enterprise, of exten-  
sive capital, and of durable improvement.  
ln a cultivation of the materials, and the  
extension of useful manufactures, more  
especially, in the general application to  
household fabrics, we behold a rapid di-  
minution of our dependence on foreign  
supplies. Nor is it unworthy of reflec-  
tion, that the revolution in our pursuits  
and habits is in no slight degree a conse-  
quence of those impolitic and arbitrary e-  
dicts, by which the contending nations, in  
  
endeavoring each of them. te ebstruct our #  
  
trade with the other, have so far abridged  
our means of procuring the productions  
and manufactures, of which our own are  
now taking the place.  
  
Recollecting always, that for every ad-  
vantage which may contribute to distin-  
guish our lot from that which others are  
doomed by the unhappy spirit of the times,  
we are indebted to that Divine Providence  
whose goodness has been as remarkably  
extended to this rising nation, it becomes  
us tocherish a devout gratitude, and to  
implore from the same omnipotent source  
a blessing on the consultations and meas-  
ures about to be undertaken for the wel-  
fare of our beloved country.

maoc-cm:&#x27;;;.,,y the Senate, and ——  
of the FHouse of *mrcOMulivec,  
  
AT the period of our last r.eeting, I had  
the satisfuction of communicating an adjust­  
ment with cne of the principal belligerent  
nations, highiy important in itself, and still  
more 80, as presaging a meore extended ac­  
commniodation, It is with dee? concern, lam  
nov to inform you, that the favourable pros­  
pect has been overclouded, by a refusal’ of  
the British goverhmient to abide by the act of  
its Minister Plenipotentiary, and by its ensu­  
ing policy towards the United States, as secn  
through the communications of the Minister  
sent to replace him. Y 4  
  
Whatever pleas may be urged for a disa­  
vowal of engagements formed by diplomatick  
functioraries, in cases where by the terms of  
engagements.a mutual ratification is reserveds;.  
or where notice at the time may bave been  
given,&#x27;of a departure from insttuctions ; orin  
extraordinary cases, essentially violating the  
Krinciplcs of equity : a disayowal could- not  
ave been apprehended in ‘a case, where no  
such’ notice. or violation existed ; where no  
such ratification was reserved ; and more ¢s­  
pecially, where, as is now in proof, an ¢ c­  
ment to be executed without any such rl:gzga­  
tion, was - contemplated Ly the instructions  
gtven and where it had, with good fuith, ‘been  
carried into immediate execution, cn the part  
of the United States. &#x27; y  
  
These considerations not having rastrained  
the British government from disavowing the  
arrangement, by virtue of which its Qrders in.  
Council were to be rcvoked, and the event  
authorising the renewal of commercial inter­  
course, having thus not talen place’; it ne­  
cessarily became a question of equal urgency  
and importance, whether the act. prohibiting  
that intercourse was not to be&#x27; considered as  
remaining in legal force.—This question be­  
ing, after duc delibertion, determined in the  
aflirmative, proclamation to that effect was is-  
Sued. It could not but happen, however, that  
a rcturn to this state of things, from that  
which had followed an execution of the ar­  
rangement by the United States, would in­  
volve difficulties. - With a view to diminish  
these as much as possible, the instructions  
from the Secretary of the Treasury, now kiid  
before you, were transmitted to the Collectors  
of the several ports. If in permitting Bric­  
ish vessels to depart, without giving bondsnot  
to proceed to their own ports, it shoulduppesr  
that the tenoi of legal authority has not heen  
strictly pursued, it is to be. ascribed to - the  
anxious desire which was felt that no individ­  
uzls should be injured by so unforseen an oc­  
currence : And flrcly on the regaixl of Con­  
gress for the equitable interests of our own  
citizens,&#x27;to adopt whatever furthet provisions  
may be found requisite, for a general remhis-.  
sion of pénalties involuntafily incarred, -  
The recall of the disayowed Minister hav­  
ing been followed by the appeintmcent of @  
successor, hopes were indulged that the new  
mission would contribute to alleviate the dis­  
appointment which had been produced, and to  
remove the causes which had so long ¢mbar­  
rassed the good understanding of the two na­  
tions. It could not be doubted, that it would  
at least be charged with conciliatory explanas  
tions of the step which had been taken, and  
with proposals to be substituted for the rejec­  
ted arrangement.-——~Reasonable and wniversal  
as this expectation was, it also has&#x27;not been  
fulfilled. From the first official disclosures  
of the new Minister, it was found that he had  
received no authority to enter into ‘explana­  
tions relative to either branch of the arrange­  
ment disavowed ; nor any authority to sub­  
stitute proposals, as to that branch whick con­  
cerned the British Orders in Council : and­  
finally, that his proposals with respéct to the  
other branch, the attack on the frigate Chesa­  
peake, were founded on apresumption repeat-,  
edly declared to be inadmissible by the Uni«  
ted States, that the first step towards adjust.  
ment was due from them—the propmeu&#x27; et  
the same time, omitting even a reference to  
%the Officer answerable %or the murderous ag-.  
gression, and asserting a claim not lpss: con=  
trary to the British laws, and British practise,  
than to the principles and obligations of the  
United States. - - . ~ + « L yte  
  
The corréspondence bLetween the Depart­  
mont of State-and this Minister will show,  
how tnessentially the features presénted in its  
commencement have been varied in, its pre--  
gress, It will show jlso, that, forgeting the  
respect due to all governments, he did not re=.  
frain from imputations on this, &#x27;wm&amp;g  
ed thit no further communications s be  
received from him. The necessity. .of. this  
step will be made known to his Britannick:  
Mujesty through the Minister Plenipotentiary -  
of the United States in London. Amd it  
would indicate a want of confidence due toy  
government which so we!ll understap®; and  
cxacts what becomes Toreign minis’ eps near it;  
not to infer that the miscondvet of its own res  
presentative wiil be viewed in the mg‘ﬂ;ﬁ‘  
inwhich it has beerl regarded -here. The  
British government will learn ot the same,  
time, that a ready attention will be_ given to  
communications, through any channel which  
may be substituted. It wiil be happy, il the  
change in this respect should be accdmphn­

change. The result of thc’ several commun­  
ications made to her govefnment, in purso­  
ance of the authorities vested by Congress in  
the executive, is contained in e correspon­  
dence of vur Minister ay Paris now luid before  
you. &#x27; .  
  
By some of the other belligerents,although  
professing just an’l amicable dispositions, in­  
juries materially affecting our commerce have  
not been duly controlled or tepressed.—ln  
tl.ese cuses, the interpositions deemed proper  
on our part, bave not been omitted. But it  
wcll deserves the consideration of the legisla­  
ture, how far both the safety and *he honour of  
the American Hag may be consulted, by ade­  
quate provisions against that collusive prosti­  
tution of it, by &#x27;tnd%‘viduuh unworthy the A­  
merican name, which hasso much favoured  
the real or pretended suspicions, under which  
the honest commerce of their fellow-citizens  
has suffered. ‘  
  
In relation to the powers on the coast eof  
Barbary, nothing has occured which is pot of  
a nature rather to inspire confidence than dis­  
trust, as to the continuance of the existing  
amity. With our Indian neighbours the just  
atgd . heneyolent system continued towards  
.{hem, has also preserved peace, and is more  
‘and more advancing habits favourable to their  
civilizatiop and happiness.  
- From a statement which will: be made by  
theiSeercttry of war, it will be seen that the  
fortifications on our maratime frontice are in  
many of the ports completed : affording the  
defence which was contemplated ; and thut  
furipier time will be required to render com­  
plete the works in the barbour of New-York,  
andrin sonie other places. By the enlarge.  
ment of the works, and the employment of a  
greater numher of hands at the publick armo­  
ries, the supply of small arms of an improve­  
ing quality, appcars to be annually increasing,  
at &amp; rate, that with those made on private con­  
tract, may be expected to go far towards pro­  
vidiag for the publick exigency.  
The act of Congress providing for the e­  
quipment of our vessels of war havigg been  
fully carried into execution, I refer te the  
statement of the Secretary of the Navy for  
the information which may be proper on that  
subject. To that statement is added a vitw  
of t’he transfers of appropriations,zithorised by  
the act of the session preceeding the last, and  
of the grounds on which the transfers were  
made,  
  
Whatever may be the cburseof your delib­  
erations on the subject of our military estab­  
lishments, T should fail in my duty in not  
recommending to your serious attention thf  
importance of giving to our militia, the  
great bulwark of our security, and resourse  
of cur power, an organization the best adap­  
ted to eventual situations for which the United  
States ought to be prepared.  
“The sums which had been previously ac­  
cuninlated in the Treasury, together with the  
receipts during the year ending on the 30th  
of September last, (and amounting to more  
than pine aillions of dollars) have enabled ys  
to fulfi} all obr engagementss-and to defray  
the current expences of government without  
  
recuring te.any loan.. But the insecurity of  
our commerce, and the consequent diminu­  
tion of the publick revenve, will produce a  
deficiency in the receipts of the ensuing year,  
for which, and for other details, 1 refer to the  
statemeat which will be transmitted from the  
Treasury.  
&quot; In&#x27;the state which has been presented of  
our affuirs with the great parties to a disas­  
trous and protracted war, carried on in a mode  
equally injurious ond unjust to the United  
States as a neutral nation, the wisdom of the  
National Legislature will be again summon­  
ed to the important deg¢ision of the alterna­  
tives before them.—T hat these wiil be et in  
a spirit, worthy the councils of a nation, con­  
scious both of its rectitude and of its rights,  
and - careful as well of its honour as of its  
peace,, I bave ap entive cons lence. And that  
the resait-will be stamped by a unanimity be:  
coming the occasion, and be supported by  
every portion of eur citizens, with a prtriot­  
ism enlightened and . invigorated by experi­  
g?qo, ought as little to be doubted.  
* Inthe midst of the wrongs and vexations ex­  
petienced from external causes, there is muchi  
room for cengratulation on the prosperity and  
happiness flo from our situation at home.  
The blessing% has never been more  
_universal. - The fruits of the seasons, though  
in particular articles&#x27;and districts short of  
their usual redundancy, are more than suffi­  
ﬁ:t :r our wants and our comforts. The  
‘our country every where presents the  
evidence of laudable enterprize, of extencive  
capital,and of durable improvement. In a  
cultivation of the materials, and the extension  
of usual manufactures, more especially in the  
general appiicationte houschold fabricks, we  
behold a rapid diminution of our dependence  
on_foreign supplies.—=Nor is it unworthy of  
_refiection that the revolutien in our pursuits  
2nd habis is in no wdegr« a conse­  
quence of these im ck and arbitrary  
cdicts, by which the contending nltions, in  
endeavcuring each of them to &lt;bstruct our  
trade with the other; have so far abridged our  
m~ans of precuring th e productions and man­  
ufacturesy of which our own are now taking  
the place. ,  
  
Recallecting always, that for every advan®  
tage which may contribute to distinguish our  
lot, from that to which others are doomed by  
the %ﬁﬁ*d the dmes, we arp ine  
debted to ivine Providence whose good­  
ness has been so remarkably extended to this  
rising nation, it becomes us to cherish a de­  
vout gratitude, and to implore {rom the same  
omnipotent tource a blessing on the consulta­  
tions and measutes about to be undertaken  
tor the welfare of our beloved country.

of the IIai.c &#x27;f Jicpretcnt tivcs  
At the period o! onr last inrcting-, I  
hud the satisfaction ol commanicatiti  
an adjust, nent with o&#x27;ie of the principal  
belligerent nations, highly important in  
itself, and still more so, as prcsain a  
more extended accommodation. It is  
with deep concern, I am now to inform  
you, that the favorable prospect lias been  
overclouded, by a refusal of the British  
Government to abide by the act of its  
Minister Plenipotentiary, and by its en­  
suing policy towards the United-States,  
as seen through the communications oi  
the minister s nt to replace him.  
Whatever p!c.s may be urted for a  
disavowal of engagements formed : by  
diplomatic functionaries, in cases where,  
by the terms cf the engagements, a mu­  
tual ratification, is reserved ; or where  
notice at the lime may have ben given  
of a departure from instructions ; or in  
extraordinary cases, essentially violating  
the p.inriples ofequity ; a disavowal al  
least cotdd not have been apprehended in  
a case, where no -uch notice or violation  
existed ; where no such ratification was  
reserved ; and more especially wheie,  
as is now in proof, an engagement, to  
be executed without any such ratificati­  
on, was contemplated by the instructions  
:ivcn, and where it had, with good faith,  
been carried into immediate execution,  
on the part of the United States.  
These considerations not having re­  
strained the British Government from  
distw owing the arrangement, by virtue  
of which its Orders in Council were to  
be rcvimC&#x27;l, and the event authorising  
the t ei it . val of commercial intercourse  
having thus not taken plae ; it nec essa-  
I. Ill&#x27;  
tily became a question, ot equal urgen  
, j,,, ;iUK.(. whether the act pro-  
1  
hihitiug tbat intercourse was not to be  
considered as remaining in legal force.  
This question being, after clue delibera­  
tion, determined in the affirmative, a  
Proclamation to that effect was issued,  
could not but happen, however, that a  
icturn to this state of things, from that  
w hich had followed an execution of the  
arrangement by the United States,  
would invoke difficulties. With a view  
to diminish these as much as possible,  
the instructions from the Secretary of  
the Treasury, no v.- laid before you, were  
transmitted to the Collectors of the se­  
veral ports. If in permitting Erithh  
vessels to depart, without gi wng bonds  
not to proceed to their own ports, it  
should appear, that the tenor of legal au­  
thority has not been strictly pursued, it  
is to be ascribed to the anxious desire  
which was lelt, that no individuals  
should be injured hy so unforeseen an  
occurrence : And I rely on the regard  
of. Congress for the equitable interests  
of our own citizens, to adopt whatever  
further provisions may be found requi­  
site Tor a general remission of penalties  
involuntarily incurred.  
The recal of the disavowed Minister  
having been followed by the appoint­  
ment of a successor, hopes were indulg­  
ed that the new mission would contri­  
bute to alleviate the disappointment  
which had been produced, and to re­  
move the causes wLich had so long em­  
barrassed the good understanding of the  
two nations. It could not be doubted,  
that it would be charged with conciliato-  
  
&quot;ry explanations- of the step which Had  
.been taken, and with proposals to be  
  
substituted for the rejectedarrangement.  
Reasonable and universal as! this cxpec  
tation was it also has not been fulfilled.  
From the first ofiicial disclosures of the  
liew Minister, it was found that he had  
received no authority to enter into ex­  
planations relative to either branch of  
the arrangement disavowed ; nor any  
authority to substitute proposals, as to  
that branch which concerned the British  
Orders; &#x27;in Council: And finally, that  
his proposals with respect to the other  
branchy the attack on the frigate Che­  
sapeake, were founded on a. presump­  
tion, repeatedly declared to be inadmis  
sible by the United States, that the first  
step towards adjustment was due from  
them ; jthe proposals, at the same tme,  
omitting even a reference to the officer  
answerable for the murderous aggi es-  
.sion, and asserting a claim, not less con-  
trary to the British laws and Btuisb  
practice, than to the principles and ob-  
ligations of the united Su&#x27;es.  
partment of State and this Minister-will  
show how unessentially tie learuies  
prcntec) in its commencement have  
bees i varied in its progresss. It will  
shew aiso, that . forgetting the respect  
due to all governments, lie did not re-  
rruin irnm ni i nil-?.  
c r&#x27; - .1,.  
which  
..v.... . r ,  
r, f, ;-th,,.rnn,r.v,t, r-it  
ens should be receiveddrom him. The  
necessitvof thisstep will be made known  
tn hU! Britannic Maiestv through the  
Minister Plenipotentiary of the united  
States, in London. And it would indi  
cate a Want of; confidence; due to a go­  
vernment which so well understands Ix.  
exacts what becomes! foreign Ministers  
near it, not tjo infer that the miscon­  
duct of its own Representative will be  
viewed m tile same light hjwhich it has  
been regarded here. The British go­  
vernment will&#x27; Jearn, at the same time,  
that a ready attention will be given to  
communicatioij., through any channel  
which may be substituted. It will be  
happy, if the ch mge in this respect  
should the accompanied by a favorable  
revision of the. unftiendly policy w hich  
has been so l-ng pursued towards the  
United; States.  
With Trance, the other belligerent,  
whose ! trespasses on our commercial  
lights have long been the subject of our  
just remonstrances the posture of our  
relations docs not correspond with the  
measures taken on the part of the Um- j  
j ted States, to effect a favorable change.  
The result of the several communicati­  
ons made lo her government, in pur­  
suance of the authorities vested by Co;i­  
gre?s in the Executives, is contained in&#x27;  
the correspondence of our Minister ar  
Paris, now hud before you.  
By some of the other belligerents, al­  
though professing just and amicable  
dispositions, injuties materially aifecting  
our commerce have not been duly con­  
troled or repressed. In these cases, the  
interpositions deemed proper on ogrpa.it  
have not bcn omitted. But it well de­  
serves the consideration of the Legisla­  
ture, how far both the safety and the ho­  
nor of the American flag may be con­  
sulted, -by adequate provisions against  
that collusive prostitution of it, by indi­  
viduals unworthy of the American name  
which has so much favored the real  
or pretended suspicions, under which  
the honest commerce of theirfellow-citizens  
has suffered.  
In relation to the powers of the coast  
of Barbary, nothing has occurred which  
is not of ja nature rather to inspire con­  
fidence than distrust, as to the &#x27;continu­  
ance of the existing amity. With our  
Indian neighbors, the just and benevo­  
lent system continued towards their. lias  
also preserved peace, and :3s more  
more advancing habits favorable to their  
civilization and, happiness.  
From a statement which will be made  
by the Secretary of War, it will be seen  
that the fortifications -on our muritihu­  
frontier are in man- of the nortsxom­  
plctcd ; affording the defence which  
was contemplated, and that a further  
time will be required to render complete  
the works in the h.rbcr of New-Vork.  
and in some other places. Bv the en  
largement of the works, and the employ- j  
ment oi a greater numo:!&#x27; ot hands at  
the public armories, the. supply of small  
arms, of an improving qualitv, appeats  
lobe annuallv increasing, at a rate that  
with those made on nrivate contract.  
1 - i  
may oe expected to go iar to .varus pro­  
viding for the public exigency.  
The act of Congress providing for  
the equipment of our vessels of war,  
having been fully carri.d into execution.  
I refer tothe statement of the Secretary  
of the Navy Lr the infonna&#x27;.ion wnich  
may be proper cn that subject. To that  
statement is added a view of the trans­  
fers ot&quot; appropriations, authorised by she  
act ot the sssshn-- preceding the  
and oi the grouhds on which the trans­  
fers were madei  
What-er may hz the course of your

gerent nations, highly important in itfclf,  
and (till more fo, as prdaging a more ex­  
tended accommodation. It is with deep  
concern, 1 am ni &lt;v to infoim you, that the  
favorable piofpeA ha* been overclouded,by  
a rtfulal of the Btitilh government t&#x27;&gt; abide  
by the acfl of it* Minillcr Plenipotentiary,  
and by it* enfuing policy towards the  
U.States, a* feen through the communi­  
cation* c&gt;f the tninillcr lent to replace him.  
Whatever pita-- may be urged for a dila­  
vowal of engagements formed by diplomat- ;  
ic lundtionaiies,iti cafes where by the terms !  
of the cogagetnnits a mutual ratification is 1  
relerved ; or where notice at the time may I  
have been given, of a departure from in- (  
(tructions; or in extraordinary cafes, ef­  
faitially violating the ptinciples of equity ;  
a elil&#x27;ivowal could not have been appre­  
hended in a calc, where no fuch notice or  
violation t xifted ; where no fuch ratifica­  
tion was rtlcrved ; and tnurc cfpcc&#x27;ally,  
where, as is now in proof, an engagement,  
to be executed without any fuch ratifica­  
tion, wa , conti mplaUd by the inftruftm i«  
givtn, and where it bad, with good faith,  
been cai i ned into immediate execution, on  
the part ot flu United States.  
Thefe confulcrationi not having reftrain-1  
c l the Bii&#x27;.illi government from disavowing 1  
the arrangement by virtue of which its  
Orders in Council were to be revoked, and  
the event a tihoriling the renewal of coin-;  
nteicial iiitcicourfe, having thus not taken |  
place ; it rwciflaiily became a qucftioti of  
equal urgency and importance, whether :  
the act prohibiting that intercom Ic was not I  
to b- tor. ti. It ltd ta remaining in legal foicc  
This queftion being, after due delibera­  
tion, determined in U e affirmative, a proc­  
lamation to that elicit was rifiied. It  
cou!d net but happen, however, that a re­  
turn totUi* flateof things, from that which  
had followed an execution of the arrange­  
* merit by the United Si airs, wor.id involve  
| difficulties. With a view to diminilh thefe  
aa much as pollible, the iuftruihon* from  
I i  
  
the Sr.1 &#x27;•t.i’ y of lu ** e.»fiiry, now la: : V­  
[fnre you, wire tranfmitted to th&gt;- Collect*  
| ora of the IVvcnl puts. If in pemutii :g  
rtritlfli vrilds to depart, withou&#x27; g&#x27;v g  
inds not to&#x27;proceed to their own ports, it  
llundd appear that the t-nor of legal an  
ihonty has not been Hriflly purfued, it is  
ti&gt; l&gt;e aferib ■! to the anxi nis delire winch  
was felt, th &gt;t no individuals ihu&#x27;.id be in­  
jured by fo unforefeen an occurrance :*—  
And I rely on the regard ot Congufs toi  
ti e equitable intereHs of our own citizens,  
to adopt whatever farther provilion . may  
be found requifite, fora general reitiillion  
of penalties involuntarily incurred.  
The recall of the di fa vowed MiniRer  
having been followed by the appointment  
of a fuccefl ir, hopes wire indulged that  
the new million would contribute to alle­  
viate the difappointment a Inch had been  
produced, and to remove the ciufes which  
had fo long err. bar railed the good under­  
Randing of the two nations. It could not  
be doubted, that it would at lead bechar­  
ged with conciliatory explanations of the  
Itrp which had been taken, and with  
propofals to be fubRituted for the rejected  
arrangement. R af &#x27;liable and uuiverfal  
as this expectation was, it a!Ii» has not been  
fulfilled. From the firlt official difclofures  
of the new Mmifter, it was found that he  
had received no authority to enter into  
explanations relative to either branch of  
the arrangements dilavowed ; nor .any au­  
thority to fubltitute propofals, as to that  
branch, which concerned the Britilh Or­  
ders in Council. And finally, that his pro­  
posals with rifpetf to the other branch,  
the attack on thetngite Chcfapeake, were  
founded on a preemption, rep atcdly de­  
clared to be inadtniflible by the Umlcd  
States, that the firft Rep towards adjuft­  
mtnt was due from them ; the propofalsat  
the fame tune, omitting even a reference  
to the officer anlw rablc for the murderous  
aggreflion, and aflVting a claim not Ids  
contrary to the Britilh laws, and Biiiilh  
practice, than to the principles aud obliga­  
tions of the U. States.  
The correfpondencc between the De­  
partment of State and this Minuter will  
Ihow,how uneflentially the features prefen­  
t«d in its commencement have been vari­  
ed in its progrefs. It will Ihow alfo, that  
forgetting tne refpect due to all govern­  
ments, he did not refrain from imputations  
on this, which required that no further  
communications Ihould be received from  
him. The neceffity of this Rep will be  
made known to his Britannic Majcfty  
through the MiniRer Plenipotentiary ofihe  
United Stales in London. And if would  
indicate a want of confidence due to a  
government which fo well undentauds &amp;  
exacts what becomes foreign Miuifiers near  
it, not to infer that the mifcotuluA of its  
own Reprcfeotative will be viewc I in the  
fame light, in which it has been teg irded  
here. The Britilh government, will learn,  
at the fame time, that a ready attention  
will be given to communications through  
any channel which may be fubRituted. It  
will be happy if the change in this refpeCt  
Riould be accompanied by a favorable re­  
vifion of the unfriendly policy, which has  
been fo long purfued towards the Un.ted  
  
stares.  
With France, the other belligerent,  
whofe trefpafTri on out commercial rights  
have long been the fnbjefl of our jolt re­  
moo ft ranees, the pofture of our relations  
does not correfpond with the mealures,  
taken on the par’ of the Uritcd States, to  
effect a favorable change. The rcfult of  
the fevetaf communications made to her  
government, in purfuance of the authori­  
ties vefted by Congu-f- in the Executive,  
is contained in the correfpondence of our  
Mmifter at Paris, now laid before you.  
By foroe of the other billigetents, al­  
though prolefTing juft and amicable difpo­  
frtions, injuries initerially afftfling our  
commerce have not been duly controlled  
|or reprefTed. In thefe cafes, the interpo­  
litions deemed proper on our pa t have  
not been omi’ted. But it well deftrves  
the cor.fnlaation of the Legiflaturff, how  
tar both the l&#x27;atety and the honor of the  
American fl rg may be confultcd, by ade­  
quate provilions againft that colluiive prof  
titution of it, by individuals, unworthy of  
the American name, which Ins fo mm h la­  
voureil the real or pretended fufpi&lt; or  
under which the hom-ft commerce ot then  
fellow-citizens lias fufFered.  
In ielation ro the powers on the et sfl of  
Barbary, nothing ha» occurred which (* not  
of a nature rather to in I pi re contidenc than  
dillrufl, a« to the continuance ot the ei ft ng  
amity With our Indian neighbors, the jufl  
and benevolent fvflem continued toward them,  
has alfo preferved peace, and is more and  
more advancing habits favorable to their civ­  
ilization and hapipinefs.  
  
Crum a Itatemetic wmcii win oe maae oy  
the Secretary of War, it will be leeu that the  
fortifications on our maritime frontier are in  
many of tbe poits completed ; affording the  
defence ulmh was contemplated, and that  
further time will be required to render com­  
plete the works in the harbor of Newyork,  
and in tome other peaces By the enlarge­  
ment of the works, and the employment of a  
greater number of bauds at the public armo­  
ties, the I&#x27;upply of linall arms, of an improv­  
ing quality, appears to be annually increaiing,  
at a raie, that with thofe made on private con  
trad, may be exposed to go far towards pro­  
viding for the public exigency.  
Tli&quot; aiff of Congrefs providing for the e­  
qtiipment of our vcll&#x27;els of war, having been  
tul&gt; carried into execution, I refer to the (late­  
metit of the Secretary of the Navy for the in­  
formation which may be proper on that fub­  
jetfl.—To that ftatement is added a view of the  
transfers of appropriations, au&#x27;hnrited by the  
adt ot the feilion preceding the laft, and of  
the grounds on which the transfers were made.  
Whatever may he the courfc of your delib  
orations on the (ul&#x27;jcifl of our military eltab  
lilhmentt, I Ihculd fail in my duty in not re  
commanding to your ferious attention the im­  
portance of giving to our militia, the great

I iln v Citizens of the Senate, foul  
of the House of Representatives,  
  
AT the period of our last meeting, 1  
had the satisf. i lion of communicating  
en adjustment with one of the principal  
belli -rent nations, highly important  
i , itself, and still more so, as presaging  
a more extended accommodation. It  
is with deep concern, 1 am now to in-  
form you that the favourable prospect  
has been overcloud&#x27; d, by a refusal of  
the British government to abide by the  
act of its minister plenipotentiary, and  
by its ensuing policy towards the Uni-  
ted States, as seen through the commu-  
nications of the minister sent to replace  
him.  
  
Whatever pleas may be urged fora  
disavowal of engagements formed bv  
diplomatic functionaries, in cases where  
  
known to bis 13 titanic majesty tl.rougi‘*which the contending nations, in endeav-  
the minister plenipotentiary ol the tj . j ori i g each ot themtoo’dl ..oil our tiaile

been regarded here. The British go-

that a ready altentiomwl Jie given to-

which may he substitiSm it will be  
happy, if the change in this respect  
should be accompanied by a favourable  
revision of the unfriendly policy, which  
has so long been pursued towards the  
United States.  
  
With France, the other belligerent,  
whose trespasses on our commercial  
rights have long been the subject of our  
just remonstrances, the posture of our  
relations does not correspond with the  
measures, taken on tiip part of the U.  
fi fates, to effect a favorable change.  
  
The result of the several communica-

suance of the authorities vested by con-  
gress in the executive, is contained in

low ci z ns i-.as lufFerrd.  
  
In relation, to the powers on the coaff  
of Baibarv, nothing has occurred which  
is not ol a nature rather to inspire confi.  
deuce than diftiull, as to the con&#x27;iiiuancc  
of -he exiffing amity. With our Indian  
neighbors, ihe juff and benevolent lyftem,  
continued towards them, has alfo  
  
. state, none seems to claims more irripor-  
, , , preicrv- jtance than that which associates him in  
  
ed peace, and is more and more advancing I your legislative councils, audit&#x27;s ever with  
habits favorable to their civilization and , a proportionate degree o  
luisuiucsiuwm.uiv.eiewve happific fs. ceed to the task.— YVhils,  
  
and the event authorising Urn , * &#x27;,° m a w, &quot; ch be , madc &#x27; immediate acts of legislat  
  
v imlren &quot; e B W W «&gt; Wlllb &#x27; «*•» **»«* jrv limited, there appears to

quired to render complete the works in  
the harbor ol New- York, and in lome oth  
er places, by the enlaig&#x27;incnt of the  
works, and the employment of a greater  
  
or in extraoruinury cases  
violating the principles of equity ; a  
■ iisavovval could not have been appre-  
hended in a case were no such notice or  
violation existed ; were no such lalifi-  
catiqq was reserved ; and more especi-  
ally, where as is now in proof, an en. | dvr wjnehthe honel^con merce of their lcl-  
gagement, to be executed without any  
such ratification, was contemplated by  
the instructions given, and where it had  
with good faith been canied into im-  
mediate execution, on the part of tlu  
United States  
  
These considerations not having re-  
strained the British government from  
disavowing the arrangement, by virtue  
«f which its orders in council were to be  
rovoked  
  
rene.wal of commercial intercourse h«t,  
ing thus not taken place ; it neeessaulji  
Betaine a question, of equal urgency «*t»  
importance, whether the act prohibiting  
that intercourse was not to be consider-  
ed as remaining in legal force- This  
question being, alter due deliberatior-  
dslertnined in the affirmative, a procla-  
mation to that effect was issued.. It  
could not but hay pen, howev er, that a  
-return to this state of things, from that  
which had fallowed an execution of the  
arrangement 1 v the V. States, would  
involve diil: .tics. Wrthtiviev to di-  
  
irdiii&#x27; 1 - these as much as possible, the  
ii.-.ti cions from the secretary of the  
treasury, now laid before you, were  
t- msmiued to the collectors of the seve-  
ral ports. If in permitting B iti-.h ves-  
sels to depart, without giving bonds not  
to proceed to their own ports, it should  
appear, that the tenor of legal authority  
l.xb not been sti ictiv pursued, it is tube  
aset ibetl to the anxious desire which was  
felt, that no individuals should be inju-  
red by so unforeseen an occurrence •&#x27;  
  
And I rely on the regard of Congress  
for the equitable interests of our own ci  
tizens, to adopt whatever further provi.  
slops may be found requisite for a gen-  
eral remission of penalties involuntari-  
ly incurred.  
  
The recal of the disavowed minister  
hating been -followed by* the appoint-;  
ment of r successor, hope* were indul-  
ged that the new mission would contri*  
bntc to alleviate the disappointment  
which had been produced, and to re-  
move the causes which had so long em-  
barrassed the ; cod understanding of the

Fellow Citizens of the Senate, and af the House of Re»  
presentatives, |  
  
At the period of our last Meeting, I bad the satisfaction of  
communicating an adjustment with one of the principal belli-  
gerent nations, higily important in itself, and still more so, as  
presaging a more extended accommodation. 11 is with deep  
concern L am now to inform you, that the favourable prospect  
has been overclouded, by a refusal of the British Government  
fo abile by the act of its Minister Plenipotentiary, and by its  
ensuing policy towards the United States, as seen through the  
communications of the Minister sent ¢o replace him,  
  
Whatever pleas may be urged for a disavewal of engage-  
mints furmed by diplomatic functionaries, in cases where by  
the terms of the engagements a mutual ratification is reserved ;  
or Where notice at the time may have been given of a depar  
ture from instructions, or iu extraoréinary eases, essentially  
violating the principles of equity, a disavowal eould not have  
becn apprehended ina case where no such notice of violation  
eristed, where no such ratification was reserved, and more es-  
p: cially, where, as is now in proof, an engagement, to be ex-  
e-oted without any such ratification, was contemplated by tlre  
ij structions given, and where it had, with good faith,- been  
  
‘earried into immediate execution on the part of the United  
  
Biatcs,  
  
These considerations not having restrained the British.Go-  
vermnent from disavowiug the arrangement by virtue of which  
#ts Orders in Council were to be revoked, and the event au-  
thorizing the renewal of commercial intercourse baying thus  
  
mot taken place, Ht neccessarily became a question of equal ur- |  
geney and ishportance, whether the act prohibiting that inter--  
  
course was not to be considered as remaining in lego! force.  
  
This question being, after due deliberation, determined iv the -  
  
affirmative, a proclamation to that effect was ivaed. It could  
oot but happen, however, that a return to this state of things  
from thai which had followed an execution of the arcange-  
  
ment by the United States, would involve difficulties. With a |  
  
view to diminish these as inuch as possible, the instruetions  
from the Secretary of the Treasury, bow laid before you,  
were transmitted to the Collectors of the several ports, If in  
permitting British vessels to depart, without giving bonds not  
to proceed to their own ports, it should appear (hat the tenor  
+f Jegal astherity bas nuvi been strictly parsaed, it is to be as-  
ertbed te the anxious desire which was, felt, that no indivi-  
&lt;uals should be injured by so unforeseen an occurrence? and |  
sely an the regard pf Congress for tlie equiiable. interests of  
eur own eilizens, to adopt whatever further pravisions may -he  
sound reqwisite fur a general remission of penalties tivolumtarily  
acurred, «~  
  
The recal of the disavowed Minister having been fellowed ;  
  
by the appolatment of a suceegsor, hopes were indulged that  
the new Minister would contribute to alleviate the disappoint-  
anent which bad been produced, and to remove the causes which  
had so long embarrassed the good understanding of the two  
nations.

been taken, and with proposals io be substituted for the re-  
gected arrangement.: Reasorable and universal as this expecta-  
tiou was, it also hus vot been fulfilled. From the first, official  
disclosures of the new Minister, it was found that he had receiv-  
ed no authority to enter into explanations relative to eitier  
branch of the arrangemect disavoGeds nor any authority to  
wubstitute proposals, as to that branch, which concerned the  
British Orders ip Council: and finally, that bis proposals with  
espect to the other branch, the attack on tlhe frigéte Chesa-  
ake, were foonded on a presumption, repeatedly declared  
be inadinissible by the United States, that the first step tax

contrary to the British laws, and British practice, tj  
principles and obligations of the United States,  
  
Phe ‘correspondcace between the department of State and  
this Minister Will shew. low inessentially the features testing  
ed in its commencement have been varied in its progress lt  
will shew also, that forgetting the cesyect dad to al} Sebi  
ments, he did not refrain from imputations on this, whi  
quired that vo further commenieations should be received from  
him, The necessity of this siep will be wade known to hig  
Britannic Majesty through the Minister Plenipotentiary of the  
United States in London, And it would indicate a Want of  
confidence due to a government which 30 well understands and  
exacts what tecomes foreign Ministers near it, wor to infer that  
the misconduct of its own Representative will be veewed,in the  
same fight in which 4 has beea regarded here. The British  
Government will learn, at the same time, thata ready aiten-  
tion will be given to communications, throagh aay ehannet  
Which may be suwhstitated, It will be happy, if -he chanze  
in this respeet should be accompanied by a fayourable revision  
of the unfriendly policy whieh has been so Jong pursued to-  
wards the United States,  
  
With france, the other belligerent, whose trespasses on our  
commercial rights have long been the subject of our just re.  
monstrances, the posture of our relations dees not correspond  
with the measures taken on the part of the United States to  
effect a favetrabie change. ‘Tire result of the several commu.  
nications made to her Governmeut, inv pursaancé-of the autio-  
rities vested by Cungress in the Executive, is contained in  
the correspondence ef our Minister at Paris, now taid be-  
fore ret.  
  
By some of the other beltigerents, altthoagh professing just  
  
and amicable dispositions, injuries materially affecting our  
commerce have not beea duly coutrouled or repressed. Tu  
these cases, the.interpositions deemed proper od our part have  
not been amitted, But it well deserves the consideration of  
the Legislature, how far bgih the safety and the honour of the  
American flag may be consulted, by adequate provisions against  
that collusive prostitution of it, by individuals anworthy of the  
Américan name, which has so mach favoured the real or pre-  
tended suspicions under whirs the honest ecommerce of their  
fellow-citizens has saffered,  
- Ia relation to the powers ow the coast of Barbary, nothing  
has occurred which is not of a nature rather to inspire confidence  
than distrust, as to the continuance of the existing amity, With  
our Indian ueighbours, the just and benevolent system eonti-  
nued toward ‘them has also preserved peace, and is more and  
more advancing habits favourable to their civilization and hap-  
piness,  
  
From a statement which will be made by the Secretary of  
War, it will be seen that the fortitications on our maritime  
frontier are in umany ‘of the ports completed, | attording the de-  
fence which was contemplated, and that farther time will be  
required to. render complete the works in the harboor of New  
York, and in some other places, By the enlargement of the  
works, and the employment of a greater number of hands at  
the public armouries, the supply of small arms, of an improv~  
ing quality, appears to’ be antiwally increasing, at a rate that,  
with thuse made on private centvact, may be expected tu ga  
far towards providing for the public exigency.  
  
The Act of Congress providing for the equipment of our  
vessels of war having been fully carried into execution, T refer  
to the statement ofane Secretary of the Navy for the informa  
tion which may Le proper on:that subject. Vo that, statement

Fellow Citizens of the Senate and  
  
of the House of Representatives :  
  
At the period of our last meet-  
ing, I had the satisfaction of com-  
municating an adjustment with  
one of the principal belligerent  
nations, highly important in itself,  
and still more so as presaging a  
more extended accommodation.  
It is with deep concern, lam now  
to inform you, that the favourable  
prospect has been overclouded,  
by a refusal of the British govern-  
ment to abide by the act of its mi-  
nister plenipotentiary, and by its  
ensuing policy towards the Uni-  
ted States, as seen through the  
communications ef the minister  
sent to replace him.  
  
Whatever pleas may be urged  
for a disavowal of engagements  
formed by diplomatic functiona-  
  
ries, in cases where by the terms  
of the engagements a mutual ra-  
tification is reserved; or where  
notice at the time may have been  
given of a departure from instruc-  
tions ; or in extraordinary cases,  
essentially violating the princi-  
ples of equity ; a disavowal could  
not have been apprehended in a  
case where no such notice or vio-  
lation existed ; where no such  
ratification was reserved; and  
more especially, where, as is now  
in proof, an engagement, to be  
executed without any such ratifi-  
cation, was contemplated by the  
instructions given, and where it  
had, with good faith, been carried  
into immediate execution, on the  
part of the United States.  
  
These considerations not hay-  
ing restrained the British govern-

importance, whether the act pro-  
hibiting that intercourse was not  
to be considered as remaining in  
legal force This question being,  
after due deliberation, determined  
in the affirmative, a proclamation  
to that effect was issued. It could  
not but happen, however, that a  
return to this state of things,  
from that which had followed an  
execution of the arrangement by  
the United States, would involve  
difficulties. With a view to di-  
niinish these as muchas possible,  
the instructions fromthe secre-  
tary of the treasury, now laid be-  
fore you, were transmitted to the  
collectors of the several ports. If  
in permitting British vessels to  
depart, without giving bonds not  
to proceed to their own ports, it  
should appear that the tenor of  
legal authority has not been strict-  
ly pursued, it is to be ascribed to  
the anxious desire which was felt,  
that no individuals should be in-  
pired by so unforeseen an occur-  
rence: And I rely on the regard  
of Congress for the equitable in-  
terests of our own Citizens, to  
adopt whatever further provisions  
  
_may be found requisite, fora ge-  
  
neral remission of penalties in-  
voluntarily incurred.  
  
The recal of the disavowed  
minister having been followed by  
the appointment of a successor,  
hopes were indulged that the new  
mission would contribute to alle-  
viate the disappointment which  
had been produced, and to re-  
move the causes which had so  
long embarrassed the good un-  
derstanding of the two nations. It  
could not be doubted, that it  
would at least be charged with  
conciliatory explanations of the  
step which had been taken, and  
with proposals to be substituted  
for the rejected arrangement.—  
  
Reasonable and universal as this  
expectation was, it also has not  
been fulfilled. From the first of-  
ficial disclosures of the new mi-  
nister, it was found that he had  
received no authority to enter into  
explanations relative to either  
branch of the arrangement dis-  
avowed; nor any authority to  
substitute proposals, as to that  
branch, which concerned the Bri-  
tish orders in council. And fi-  
nally, that his proposals with re-  
spect to the other branch, the  
attack on the frigate Chesapeake,  
were founded on a presumption,  
repeatedly declared to be inad-  
missible by the United States,  
that the first step towards adjust-  
ment was due from them; the  
proposals at the same time, omit-  
ting even a reference to the offi-  
cer answerable for the murder-  
ous aggression, and asserting a  
claim not less contrary to the  
British laws, and British practice,  
than to the principles and obliga-  
tions of the United States.  
  
The correspondence between  
the department of state and this  
minister will show, how unessen-  
tially the features presented in its  
commencement have been varied  
in its progress. It will show also,  
that forgetting the respect due to  
all governments, he did not re-  
frain from imputations on this,  
which required that no farther  
communications should be re-  
ceived from him. The necessity  
of this step will be made known  
to his Britannic majesty through  
the minister plenipotentiary of  
the United States in London.  
And it would indicate a want of  
confidence due to a government  
which so well understands and  
exacts what becomes foreign mi-  
nisters near it, not to infer that  
the misconduct of its own repre-

sentative will be viewed in the  
same light, in which it has been  
regarded here. The British go-  
vernment will learn, at the same  
time, that a ready attention will be  
given to communications, through  
any channel which may be substi-  
tuted. It will be happy, if the  
change in this respect should be  
accompanied by a favourable revi-  
sion of the unfriendly policy,  
which has been so long pursued  
towards the United States.  
  
With France, the other belli-  
gerent, whose trespasses on our  
commercial rights have long been  
the subject of our just rev on-  
strances, the posture of our rela-  
tions does not correspond with  
the measures, taken on the part  
of the United States, to effect a  
favorable change. The result of  
the several communications made  
to-her government, in. pursuance  
of the authorities vested by Con-  
gress in the executive, is contain-  
tained in the correspondence of  
our minister at Paris, now izid be-  
fore you.  
  
By some of the other bellige-  
rents, although professing just  
and amicable dispositions, injuries  
materially affecting our commerce  
have not been duly controlled or  
repressed. In these cases, the  
interpositions deemed proper on  
our part have not been omitted.  
But it well deserves the consider-  
ation of the legislature, how far  
beth the safety and the honor of  
the American flag may be con-  
sulted, by adequate provisions a-  
gainst that collusive prostitution  
of it by individuals, unworthy of  
the American name, which has  
so much favored the real or pre-  
tended suspicions, under which  
the honest commerce of their  
fellow citizens has suffered,  
  
In relation to the powers on  
the coast of Barbary, nothing has  
occurred which is not of a nature  
rather to inspire confidence than  
distrust, as to the continuance o  
the existing amity. With our  
Indian neighbors, the just and be-  
nevolent system, continued to-  
ward them, has also preserved  
peace, and is more and more ad-  
vancing habits favorable to their  
civilization and happiness.  
  
From a statement which will  
be made by the secretrary of war,  
it will be seen that the fortifica-  
tions on our maritime frontier  
are in many of the ports com-  
pleted; affording the defence  
which was contemplated, and that  
a further time will be required to  
render complete the works in  
the harbor of New York, and in  
some other places. By the en-  
largement of the works, and the  
employr.ent of a greater number  
of hands at the public armories,  
the supply of small arn-s, of an im-  
proving quality, appears to be an-  
nually increasing, at a rate, that  
with those made on private con-  
tract, may be expected to go far  
towards providing for the public  
exigency.  
  
The act of Congress providing  
for the equipment of our vessels  
of war having been fully carried  
into execution, I refer to the state-  
ment of the secretary of the na-  
vy for the information which may  
be proper on that subject. To  
that statement is added a view ot  
the transfers of appropriations,  
authorised by the act of the ses-  
sion preceding the last, and ofthe  
grounds on which the transfers  
were made.  
  
Whatever may be the course  
of your deliberations on the sub-  
ject of our military establish

inents, I should fail in my duty  
in not recommending to your se-  
rious attention the importance of  
giving to our militia, the great  
bulwark of our security, and re-  
source of our power, an organiza-  
tion the best adapted to eventual  
situations for which the United  
States ought to be prepared.  
  
The sums which had been pre-  
viously accumulated in the trea-  
sury, together with the ‘receipts  
during the year ending onthe SOth  
of September last (and amounting  
to more than nine millions of  
dollars) have enabled us to fulfil  
all our engagements, and to de-  
fray the current expenses of go-  
vernment without recurring to  
any loan. But the insecurity of  
our commerce, and the conse-  
quent diminution of the public  
revenue, will probably produce a  
deficiency in the receipts of the  
ensuing year, for which, and for o-  
ther details, I refer to the state-  
ments which wiil be transmitted  
trom the treasury.  
  
In the state which has been  
presented of our affairs with the  
sreat parties to a disastrous and  
protracted war, carried on in a  
mode equally injurious and un-  
just to the United States as a neu-  
tral nation, the wisdom of the na-  
tional legislature will be again sum-  
moned to the important decision  
on the alternatives before them.  
‘That these will be met in a spi-  
rit, worthy the councils of a na-  
tion, conscious both of its recti-  
tude and of its rights, and care-  
ful as well of its honor as of its  
peace, I have an entire confidence.  
And thatthe result will be stamp-  
ed by a unanimity becoming the  
occasion, and be supported by  
every portion of our citizens,  
with a _patriotism enlightened  
  
and invigorated by experience  
ought as little to be doubted.  
  
In the midst of the wrongs and  
vexations experienced from ex-  
ternal causes, there is much  
room for congratulation on the  
prosperity and happiness flowing  
from our situation at home. The  
blessing of health has never been  
more universal. The fruits of  
the seasons, though in particular  
articles and districts short of their  
usual redundancy, are more than  
sufficient for our wants and our  
comforts. The face of our coun-  
try every where presents the evi-  
dence of laudable enterprise, of  
extensive capital, and of durable  
improvement. In a cultivation  
of the materials, and the exten-  
sion of useful manufactures, more  
especially, in the general applica-  
tion to household fabrics, we be-  
hold a rapid diminution of our  
dependence on foreign supplies.  
Nor is it unworthy of reflection,  
that this revolution in our pur-  
suits and habits is in no slight  
degree a consequence of those  
impolitic and arbitrary edicts, by  
which the contending nations, in  
endeavoring each of them to ob-  
struct our trade with the other,  
have so far abridged our means  
of procuring the productions and  
manufactures, of which our own  
are now taking the place.  
  
Recoliecting always, that for  
every advantage which may con-  
tribute to distinguish our lot,  
from that to which others are  
doomed by the unhappy spirit of  
the times, we are indebted to that  
Divine Providence whose good-  
ness has been so remarkably ex-  
tended to this rising nation, it be-  
comes us to cherish a devout  
gratitude, and to implore from  
the same omnipotent source a

Fellow Citizens of the Senate, and of  
the House of Representatives ; At the pe-  
riod of our last Mee‘iny, I had the satisfac-  
tion of communicating an adjustment with  
: one of the principal belligerent nations,  
high!y important in itself, and stil] more so,  
8s presaving a more extended accomoda-  
tion. Itis with deep concern Tam now  
to inform you, that the favourable pros-  
  
ject has becn overciouded by a refusal of  
the British Government to abide by the  
att of its Minister Ple -nipotent lary, and by  
its ensuing policy towards the United  
States, as seen throug! the communica-  
| tions of the Minister sent to replace him.

yowal of envagements formed by diplo-  
3 “Matic finctionaries, in cases where, by the  
térms of the envevgements, a mutual ratifi-  
he Cation is reserved ; or where notice at ihe

\ Cases, essentially violating the principles  
Oequity, « disavowal could not have veen

ceed to their own ports, it should appear  
that the tenor of legal authority has mot  
been strict!y ; pursued, it is to be aseribcl  
to the anxious desire which was felt, that  
no individual should be injured by so un-  
foreseen an occurrence: and I re ly on the  
regard of Congress for the equitab le in-  
terests of our own Citizens, to adopt what-  
ever further provisions may be found re-  
quisite for a general remission of penalties  
involuntarily incurred.—The recall of the  
disavowed Minister having been followed  
by the appointment of a successor, hopes  
were indulged that the new Minister would  
contribute to alleviate the disappomncment  
which had been produced, and to remove  
the causes which had so long embarrassed  
the good understanding of the two n: wer  
It could not be doubted, that it would ;  
least be charged with conciliatory ixplar a=  
nations of the step which had been taken,  
and with proposals to be substituted for the  
rejected arrangement. Reasonab&#x27;e and  
universal as this expectation was, It also  
has not been fulfilled. From the first of-_  
ficial disclosures of the new Minister, it  
was found that he had received no autho-  
rity to enter into explanations relative to  
either branch of the arrangement dis-  
avowed ; nor any authority to ee apa  
proposals, as to that branch, whi h con-  
cerned the British Orders in Coun it ; and  
finally, that his proposals with respect to  
the other branch, the attack on the frigate  
Chesapeake, were founded on a presump-  
tion, repeatedly declared to be inadmissi-  
ble by the United Stages, that the first  
step towards adjustment was due from  
them; the proposals, at ‘e same time,  
omitting even a_reference to the officer  
answerable for the murderous aggression,  
and asserting a claim, not less contrary to  
the British Jaws and British practice, than  
to the principles and obligations of the  
United States.—The currespondence be-  
tween the department of State and this  
Minister will shew how inessentially the  
features presented in its commencement  
have been varied in its progress, It will  
shew also, that forgetting the respect due  
to all Governments, he did not relrain from  
impot: itions on this, which required that  
no further communications should be re-  
ceived from him. ‘The necessity of this  
step will be made known .o bis Britannic  
Majesty through the Minister Plenipoten-  
tiary of the United Statesin London, And  
it would indicate a want of confidence due  
to a Government which so well under-  
stands and exacts what becomes foreign

ini - it, no int iS- improving  
Ministers near it, not to inferthat the mis of an | g d  
bee will be | annually mecreasing, at a rate, that, with  
  
conduct of its own representative  
viewed in the same light in which it has  
been regarded here. The British Govern-  
ment will learn, at the same time, that a  
ready attention will be given to communi-  
cations, through any channel. which may  
be substituted. It will be happy, if the  
chinge in this respect should be accom-  
panied by a favourable revision of the un-  
fricndly pol cy which has been so long  
pursued towards the United States. —W ith  
France, the other belligerent, whose tres-  
passes on our commercial rights have long  
been the subject of our just remanstances,  
the posture of our relations does not cor-  
respond wiih the measures taken on the  
part of the United Siates, to effect a fa-  
vourable chance. The result of the seve-  
ral communi ations raacde Lo her Govern-  
ment, in pursuance of the authorities vested  
hy Congvess in the executive, 1s contained  
inthe correspondence of our Minister at  
Paris, now laid before you.—By some of  
the other belligerents, although professing  
just and amicable dispositions, myuries ma-  
tevially affecting our commerce have not  
been duly controuled or repressed. In  
these cases, the interpositions deemed  
proper on our part have not been omitted.  
But it well deserves the consideration of  
the Legislature, how far both the safety  
and the honour of the American flag may  
be consulted, by adequate provisions  
ugainst that collusive prostitution of it,  
by individuals unworthy of the Amcrican  
name, which has so much favoured the  
real or pretended’ Suspicions under which  
the honest commerce of their fellow-citi-  
zens has suflered—In relation to the  
powers on the coast of Barbary, nothing  
has occurred which is not of a nature rather  
to inspire confidence than distrust, as to  
the continuance of the existing amity.  
With our Indian neighbours, the just and  
benevolent system continued toward them  
has also preserved peace, and is more and  
more advancing habits favourable to their  
civilization and happiness.—From a state-  
ment which will be made by the Secretary  
of War, it will be seen that the fortifica-  
tions on our maritime frontier are in many  
of the ports completed, affording the de-  
fence which was contemplated, and that  
further time wili be required to render  
complete the works in the harbour of New  
York, and ‘in some other places. By the  
enlargement of the works, and the employ-  
ment o&#x27; a greater number of hands at the

. . rr’ P . Y

vessels of war, having been fully carried  
  
into execution, I refer to the statement of  
  
the Secretary of the Navy for the informa-  
tion which may be proper on that subject.  
  
—&#x27;To that statement is added a view ot  
  
the transfers of appropriations, authorized  
by the Act of the Session preceding the  
last, and of the grounds on which the trans-  
fers were made.—W batever may be the  
course of your deliberations on the sub-  
  
ject of our military establishmenis, I should  
  
fail in my duty i not recommending to  
your serious attention the importance of  
civing to our militiv, the great bulwark of  
our security, and resource of our power, an  
organization the best adapted to eventual  
situations for which the Umited States  
ought to be prepared.—The sums which  
had been previously accumulated in the  
Treasury, together with the receipts dur-  
ing the year ending on the 30th of Sept.  
last (and amounting to more than nine  
millions of dollars), have enabled us to  
fulfil all our engagements, and to defray  
the current expenses of Government with-  
out recurring to any loan. But the insecu-  
rity of our commerce, and the consequent  
diminution of the public revenue, - will  
probably produce a deficiency in the re-  
ceipts of the ensuing year, for which, and  
for other details, I refer to the statements  
which will be transmitted from the Trea-  
sury.—In the state which has been present-  
ed of our affairs with the great parties to a  
disastrous and protracted war, carried on in  
a mode equally injurious and unjust to the  
United States, as a neutral nation, the  
wisdom of the National Legislature will be  
again summoned to the important decision  
of the alternatives before them. That  
these will be met in a spirit worthy the  
councils of a nation, conscious both of  
its rectitude and of its rights, and careful  
as well of its honour as of its peace, I have  
an entire confidence. And that the re-  
sult will be stamped by an unanimity be-  
coming the occasion, and be supported by  
every portion of our citizens, with a pa-  
triotism enlightened and invigorated b  
  
experience, ought as little to be doubted.  
—In the midst of the wrongs and vexations  
experienced from external causes, there is  
much room for congratulation on the pros-  
perity and happiness flowing from our

‘*rejected Arrangement. Reasonable and uni-  
‘¢ versal as this expectation was, it also has not

‘*planations relative to either branch of the  
‘* Arrangement disavowed, nor any authority to  
‘substitute proposals as to that branch which  
‘* concerned the British Orders in Council. And,  
‘*finally, that his proposals with respect to the  
‘*other branch, the attack on the frigate Chesa-  
‘* neake, were founded on a presumption, repeat-  
‘‘edly declared to be inadmissible by the United

‘¢was due from them; the proposals, at the same  
‘*time, omitting even a reference to the officer  
‘*answerable for the murderous aggression, and  
‘asserting a claim not less contrary to the  
‘* British laws and British practice than to the  
‘*pringiples and obligations of the United

‘*The correspondence between the Depart-  
‘ment of State and this Minister will show how  
‘*unessentially the features presented in its  
‘*commencement have been varied in its prog-  
‘“‘ress. It will show, also, that, —e

‘not. refrain from imputations on this, which  
‘required that no further communications  
‘should be received from him. The necessity  
‘of this step wiil be made knowr. to his Bri-  
‘*tannic Majesty, through the Minister Plenipo-
