Sir,  
						Richmond February 28. 1808.  
					  
					It appears by your letter of May 20th: 1807, which was forwarded by Mr. Purviance to Mr. Pinkney &amp; myself at London, &amp; received on the 16: July, that you had Construed several Articles of the treaty which we had Signed with the British  
						Commissioners, on the 31st. of December, 1806, in a different sense from that in which they were conceived by us. As the Course we were instructed to pursue by your letter of February 3, with regard to that treaty, which was confirmed in that of May 20th: was in no degree  
						dependent on our Construction of any of its articles, or on the political considerations which induced us to Sign it, we deem’d it unnecessary to enter into any explanation in reply, either of our Construction of its articles, or of the political Considerations alluded to. We  
						thought it more consistent with our duty to look solely, to the object of our instructions, &amp; to exert our utmost efforts to accomplish it; &amp; we acted in Conformity to that Sentiment. The result of those efforts was made Known by the documents which I had the honor to  
						present to you, when I was lately at Washington, being Copies of a Joint dispatch which Mr. Pinkney &amp; I had forwarded by Mr. Rose. We had flattered ourselves that it might have been practicable to obtain the amendments of the treaty which the President desired, as the  
						State of affairs in Europe had become more favorable to Such a Result, but in that we were disappointed. We found no difficulty in accomplishing the other object, of setting it aside, as we were instructed to do in case the proposed amendments were not acceded to.  
					At this time there is no objection to Such an explanation that I am aware of, and there are many reasons why it Should be given. You will be sensible that so far as an unfavorable estimate is entertained of that transaction, it must, in the degree  
							tend to injure those who gave it the sanction of their names; and you will be equally Sensible that if the United States are in any degree interested in it, at this time, it must consist in its being viewed in a just rather than an unfavorable light. In  
						retiring from the Station which I have lately held, this is the last act of publick &amp; private duty which I have to perform in relation to it. It is to me in many views a painful duty, but still it is one which it is highly incumbent on me to execute.  
					It is far from being my desire to compromit Mr. Pinkney in this letter in the Slightest circumstance. In the management of the business which was intrusted to us jointly, we acted with the greatest harmony, &amp; exerted our best efforts to accomplish the  
						object of our instructions. I am not aware that in Speaking of any part of the treaty, I shall give it a Construction in which he would not concur; but that presumption is founded altogether on what took place between us in the course of the negotiation. To this Communication  
						he is not a party, nor indeed does he Know that such an one will be made. In every view therefore it is improper, and would be unjust, that he should be considered as having any Concern in it.  
					The impressment of Seamen from our merchant Vessels is a topic which claims a primary attention from the Order which it holds in your letter; but more especially from Some important considerations that are connected with it. The Idea entertained by the  
						publick, is, that the rights of the United States were abandoned by the American Commissioners in the late negotiation, &amp; that their Seamen were left by tacit acquiescence if not by formal renunciation, to depend for their safety on the mercy of the British Cruisers. I  
						have on the Contrary always beleived, and still do beleive that the ground on which that interest was placed by the paper of the British Commissioners of November 8th: 1806, &amp; the explanations which accompanied it, was both honorable and advantageous to the United States:  
						that it contained a concession in their favor, on the part of Great Britain, on the great principle in Contestation, never before made by a formal &amp; obligatory act of the Government, which was highly favorable to their Interest; and that it also imposed on her the  
						obligation to conform her practice under it, ’til a more complete arrangement should be concluded, to the just Claims of the United States. To place this transaction in its true light and to do justice to the Conduct of the American Commissioners, it will be necessary to  
						enter at some length into the Subject.  
					The British paper states that the King was not prepared to disclaim or derogate from a right on which the Security of the British Navy might essentially depend, especially in a Conjuncture when he was engaged in Wars which enforced, the necessity of his  
						most vigilant attention, to the preservation and supply of his naval force: that he had directed his Commissioners, to give to the Commissioners of the United States, the most positive assurances that instructions had been given and Should be repeated &amp; enforced, to  
						observe the greatest Caution, in the impressing of British Seamen, to preserve the Citizens of the United States from molestation or injury, &amp; that immediate and prompt redress should be afforded on any representation of injury sustained by them. It  
						then proposes to postpone the Article relative to impressment on account of the difficulties which were experienced in arranging any article on that subject, and to proceed to conclude a treaty on the other points that were embraced by the negotiation. As a motive to such  
						postponement &amp; the Condition of it, it assures us that the British Commissioners were instructed still to entertain the discussion of any plan which could be devised to secure the Interests of both States without injury to the rights of either.  
					By this paper it is evident that the rights of the United States were expressly to be reserved, and not abandoned as has been most erroneously supposed, that the negotiation on the Subject of impressment was to be postponed for a limited time and for a  
						Special object only, and to be revived as soon as that object was accomplished: and in the interim that the practice of impressment was to correspond essentially with the views &amp; interests of the United States. It is indeed evident from a correct view of the Contents of  
						that paper, that Great Britain refused to disclaim or derogate only from what she called her right, as it also is, that as her refusal was made applicable to a Crisis of extraordinary peril, it authorized the  
						reasonable expectation if not the just claim that even in that, the accomodation desired would be hereafter yeilded.  
					In our letter to you of Novr. 11: which accompanied the paper under consideration and in that of January 3d: which was forwarded with the treaty these sentiments were fully confirmed In that of November 11th. we communicated one important fact which left no  
						doubt of the Sense in which it was intended by the British Commissioners that that paper Should be construed by us. In calling your attention to the passage, which treats of impressment, in reference to the practice which should be observed in future, we remarked that the  
						terms &quot;high seas&quot; were not mentioned in it, and added that we Knew that the omission had been intentional It was impossible that these terms could have been omitted intentionally with our Knowledge, for any purpose other than to admit a  
						construction that it was intended that Impressments should be confined to the Land. I do not mean to imply that it was understood between the British Commissioners &amp; us, that Great Britain Should abandon the practice of impressment on the high Seas altogether. I mean  
						however distinctly to State that it was understood that the practice heretofore pursued by her should be abandoned &amp; that no impressment Should be made on the high Seas under the obligation of that paper, except in Cases of an extraordinary nature, to which no general  
						prohibition against it could be construed fairly to extend. The cases to which I allude were described in our letter of November 14th. They suppose a British Ship of war and a merchant Vessel of the United States, lying in the Tagus or some other port the desertion of some of  
						the Sailors from the Ship of War to the merchant Vessel, and the sailing of the latter with such deserters on board, they being British Subjects. It was admitted that no general prohibition against impressment, could be construed to sanction Such Cases of injustice and fraud;  
						and to such Cases it was understood that the practice Should in future be confined.  
					It is a just claim on our part that the explanations which were given of that paper by the British Commissioners when they presented it to us, &amp; afterwards while the negotiation was depending, which we communicated to you in due order of time, should be  
						taken into view, in a fair estimate of our Conduct in that transaction. As the arrangment which they proposed was of an informal nature resting on an understanding between the parties in a certain degree confidential, it could not otherwise than happen that such explanations  
						would be given us in the Course of the business of the Views of their Government in regard to it. And if an arrangment by informal understanding is admissible in any case between nations, it was our duty to receive those explanations to give them the weight to which they were  
						justly entitled &amp; to communicate them to you with our impression of the extent of the obligation which they imposed. It is in that mode only that what is called an informal understanding between nations can be entered into. It presumes a want of precision in the written  
						documents connected with it, which is supplied by mutual explanations and Confidence. Reduce the transaction to form and it becomes a Treaty. That an informal understanding was an admissible mode of arranging this interest with Great Britain is made sufficiently evident by  
						your letter of February 3d. 1807. in reply to ours of Novr. 11th: of the preceeding year.  
					Without relying however on the explanations that were given by the British Commissioners of the import of that paper or of the course which their Government intended to pursue under it, it is fair to remark on the paper itself, that as by it the rights of  
						the parties were reserved &amp; the negotiation might be continued on this particular topic, after a treaty should be formed on the others, Great Britain was bound not to trespass on those rights, while that negotiation was depending and in case she did trespass on them in  
						any the slightest degree, the United States would be justified in breaking off the negotiation and appealing to force in Vindication of their rights. The mere circumstance of entertaining an amicable negotiation by one party for the adjustment of a Controversy, where no right  
						had been acknowledged in it by the other, gives to the latter a just Claim to such a forbearance on the part of the former. But the entertainment of a negotiation for the express purpose of securing interests sanctioned by acknowledged rights, makes Such Claim irresistible.  
						We were therefore decidedly of Opinion that the paper of the British Commissioners placed the interest of impressment on ground which it was both safe and honorable for the United States to admit: that in short it gave their Government command of the subject for every  
						necessary &amp; useful purpose. Attach’d to the treaty it was the basis or condition on which the treaty rested. Strong in its character in their favor on the great question of right, &amp; admitting a favorable construction on others, it placed them on more elevated ground  
						in those respects than they had held before, and by Keeping the negotiation open to obtain a more complete adjustment the administration was armed with the most effectual means of securing it. By this arrangment the Government possesses a power to coerce without being  
						compelled to assume the Character belonging to coercion, And it was able to give effect to that power without violating the relations of Amity between the Countries. The right to break off the negotiation and appeal to force could never be lost sight of in any discussion on  
						the Subject, while there was no obligation to make that appeal til necessity compelled it. If G Britain conformed her practice to the rule prescribed by the paper of Novr. 8o. &amp; the explanations which accompanied it, our Government might rest on that ground with  
						advantage; but if she departed from that rule &amp; a favorable opportunity offered for the accomplishment of a more complete &amp; Satisfactory arrangment, by a decisive effort, it would be at Liberty to seize such opportunity for the advantage of the Country.  
					These considerations founded on a view of the proposed arrang’ment itself furnished strong inducement to us to proceed to the other objects of the negotiation. There were other Considerations of a different character which recommended it with still greater  
						force. Had we refused to proceed in the negotiation what was the alternative which such a refusal presented to our view? The negotiation would have been at an end after having failed in all its objects, for if this interest was not arranged, none others could be. The attitude  
						which the Governments held towards each other was in a certain degree hostile. Injuries had been inflicted by one party and resentment shewn by the other, the latter having taken a step in the Case of the non importation Law, which was intended to vindicate the public rights  
						&amp; Honor by being made the means of obtaining a redress of those injuries. The measure was intended for the ministry of Mr. Pitt from which the injuries were received, but by the removal of that ministry &amp; the delay which took place in the passage of the Law, it came  
						into operation against the ministry of Mr. Fox and Lord Grenville who would not have rendered those injuries &amp; against whom of Course such a weapon would not have been raised. Nothwithstanding the existence of that Law and the attitude which still remained between the  
						Governments, it was impossible to appeal to it as a strong motive of action with the new Ministry. Such an appeal was sure to produce more harm than good. It would have lost us all claim on the generous feelings and liberal policy, which the new ministry was beleived to  
						indulge and disposed to adopt, towards the United States. The negotiation therefore with the new ministry was conducted by policy as well as by inclination on friendly &amp; Concilatory principles. Should it fail however in its object and be broken off the relation between  
						the parties, would Change in an instant. From that moment the new ministry would stand on the ground of the old one, and the nation be united in all its political parties against us. The attitude would become in fact what the exterior announced it to be, hostile, and it was  
						difficult to perceive how it could be changed, and peace be preserved, with Honor to the United States. They could not recede from the ground which they had taken, or accept by compulsion terms which they had rejected in an amicable negotiation. War therefore seemed to be the  
						inevitable consequence of such a state of things, and I was far from considering it an alternative which ought to be preferred to the arrang’ment which was offered to us. When I took into view the prosperous and happy Condition of the United States, compared with that of  
						other nations; that as a neutral power they were almost the exclusive carriers of the productions of the whole world; and that in Commerce they flourished beyond example nothwithstanding the Losses which they occasionally suffered, I was strong in the Opinion that those  
						blessings ought not to be hazarded in such a question. Many other considerations tended to confirm me in that Sentiment. I Knew that the United States were not prepared for war; that their Coast was unfortified &amp; their Cities in a great measure defenceless: that their  
						militia in many of the States was neither armed nor trained; &amp; that their whole revenue was derived from commerce. I could not presume that there was just cause to doubt which of the alternatives ought to be preferred. Had it however been practicable to terminate the  
						negotiation without such an adjustment as that proposed, and without taking any decisive measure in consequence of its failure, what was to become of the non importation Law? If suffer’d to remain in force it was sure to produce war. Great Britain it was Known would enter  
						into no arrangement by treaty which did not provide for its repeal; and there was little reason to presume, after the rupture of the negotiation by which the relation between the parties would be less friendly, that she would become more accomodating. It was on the Contrary  
						fairly to be concluded that if any arrangment whatever should be practicable it would be a less advantageous one than that which we had Sanctioned. Some disposition of it was therefore indispensably necessary in any Course which might be taken. These considerations had much  
						weight in deciding that which was pursued, and I frankly own that a sincere desire to afford to the administration an honorable opportunity for its repeal, since under existing circumstances it did not seem probable that it could be longer useful &amp; might be injurious, was  
						a strong motive with me to incur the responsibility which I took on myself in that transaction. To the arrangment proposed we gave our sanction. We undertook to submit it to the consideration of our Government taking care to inform the British Commissioners, that we had no  
						power to conclude a treaty that would be obligatory on the U: States, which did not arrange in a satisfactory manner the Interest of impressment. We agreed also to proceed in a discussion of the other objects of the negotiation &amp; eventually concluded a treaty, it being  
						understood, from what we had frequently stated, that if our Government Should disapprove the arrangment relative to impressment, the whole would fall with it. Thus the United States enjoyed the advantage of being at liberty to accept or reject the arrangment while on the  
						British Government it was binding. With one party it was a project and the other a treaty. There was in truth nothing unreasonable in this Circumstance as the British Commissioners acted in presence of the Cabinet consulted and took its instruction on every point, while our  
						distance from our Government rendered such a recurrence to it impossible. This advantage however proceeded from the nature of the transaction: it was not the effect of finesse on our part. We advanced in the negotiation &amp; concluded a treaty in a firm beleif, that altho’  
						it fell short of what we had expected to obtain, it was nevertheless in the then state of affairs such an one as the United States might adopt with Credit and advantage. I have no doubt that the British Commissioners entertained still greater confidence in such a result. The  
						circumstance of our finally agreeing to sanction the arrangment rather than break off the negotiation, at which issue we had frequently stood, in the progress of it, was calculated to make that impression. But it was much strengthened by a Knowledge that the whole arrangment  
						would expose them to very severe and probably successfull attacks from the opposition, while they had no expectation that it would be popular in the Country.  
					By your letter of Feby. 3d. 1807. in reply to ours of Novr: 11th: 1806. the Course which the Government resolved to pursue was announced. By it we were informed that the President dissapprov’d the informal arrangement proposed by the British Commissioners  
						relative to impressment &amp; was resolved to enter into no treaty with the British Government, which when limited to, or short of strict right on every other point should include in it no article on that particular one: that in case such an article could not be obtained, we  
						should terminate the negotiation without any formal Contract whatever, but with a mutual understanding, founded on friendly &amp; liberal discussions &amp; explanations, that in practice each party would entirely conform to what should be thus informally settled between them.  
						And we were authorized to give assurances in case such an arrang’ment should be satisfactory in substance, that as long as it should be respected in practice, particularly on the Subjects of Neutral trade &amp; impressment, the President would earnestly &amp; probably  
						successfully recommend it to Congress not to permit the non importation Law to go into Operation; and in the mean time that he would exercise the power vested in him by an act of Congress, if no intervening intelligence forbade it, of suspending its operation till the meeting  
						of Congress, who being in Session would have an opportunity to make due provision for the Case, and finally that if a treaty which did not provide for the interest of impressment should have been concluded, before the receipt of that letter, we should candidly apprize the  
						British Commissioners of the reasons why it would not be ratified, &amp; invite them to enter again on the business with a view to such a result as was desired.  
					By this letter the arrangment which we had sanctioned comprizing the informal one relative to impressment &amp; that by treaty on the other topicks was rejected, and in lieu of it we were instructed to enter into an informal understanding or arrangment of  
						the whole subject and as was to be inferred, from the fair import of the letter on the same Conditions. It was the more to be presumed that the Government was willing to accept in the mode which it proposed, the conditions which we might be able to obtain, in the other from  
						the Consideration, that the latter were under its view at the time the instructions were given, by the paper of the British Commissioners of Novr. 8th: and our letter of the 11: and the Certainty with which it as well as we, must have been impressed, that more favorable could  
						not be expected.   
					In defending myself against the imputation of having sacrific’d the rights of our Seamen, I shall be permitted to derive Support from the conduct of the Government itself in the same interest. Under that impression I have to remark that I consider the  
						Conduct of the Government as furnishing the most ample vindication of that of the American Commissioners. The Government was equally willing to enter into some arrang’ment, which should preserve the peace of the Country, altho’ it should not accomplish the object which had  
						been so ardently desir’d. The only difference between the plan which we Sanctioned and that which it proposed, was that the whole arrangment should be informal. Had the administration resorted to war as a preferable alternative or been willing to leave the business unsettled,  
						its policy &amp; example might have been plead against us; but in offering to accept the same conditions in an informal mode, and to withdraw, in some form, the non importation Law as a motive to it, it shewed that the Considerations which had been respected by us had as much  
						weight with it.  
					But the Conduct of the administration furnishes other strong arguments in favor of the arrangment proposed by the American Commissioners. By engaging to observe the informal arrang’ment which we were instructed to enter into, as long as Great Britain should  
						observe it, it seemed as if the United States would be deprived of the right of insisting on other terms however favorable the opportunity for it might be, while Great Britain would be at Liberty to depart from such arrang’ment whenever the events of war furnished her an  
						adequate motive for it. This was the opposite of our arrang’ment as I have stated above, by which, as we presumed, she would be bound and we free. Certainty to our merchants was all important. Any fair well defin’d rule, within which they might prosecute in safety their  
						enterprizes, altho’ it might fall short in some respects of our just Claims, might perhaps be preferable to frequent Collisions which put every thing at hazard. In any event it was an object of great importance to Keep the peace of the Country in our own hands, by retaining  
						the right to resort to war when it suited us and then only.  
					I will now proceed to the other topicks which are adverted to in your letter of May 20th 1807, and on which I shall be as concise as possible. In your examination of the treaty you notice several of primary importance, which you conceive to have been  
						improperly arranged in the articles which refer to them. I will pursue in my remarks the order which you have traced.  
					You consider the 11th: article as objectionable in having shut to our commerce important Channels which were left open to it, by the decisions of the British Courts, &amp; the principles contained in the Communication from Lord Hawkesbury to Mr. King. In  
						support of that Opinion You observe that as the article stipulates, that the United States may carry the Manufactures &amp; productions of Europe, from their own ports, to any Colony of the enemies of Great Britain, they are prohibited by it from carrying the manufactures or  
						productions of the Countries beyond the Cape of Good hope, in like manner, to such Colonies. You observe also that as the United States are authorized to Carry from their own ports the productions of Enemy-Colonies to Europe, they are prohibited from carrying those  
						productions to the Southern Coast of the Meditirean or beyond the Cape of Good hope, or to any other Enemy or Neutral Colonies in this quarter.  
					I am persuaded that you will be satisfied on further Consideration that this Construction of that Article is unfounded. It is not the object of the article to regulate the General Commerce of the Countries or to Compromit their Claims in any Case to which  
						the regulation does not explicitly extend. The regulation prescribed by it, applies to a case of Controversy between the parties in a point of immediate contact, &amp; it was the object of the article to adjust the Controversy in that point. If we advert to the issue which  
						was made up, between them, as clearly defined by the orders of the British Government, the decisions of the Courts of admiralty under them, and the discussions which took place between the Governments on the Subject, we shall find that in no view can the Construction which  
						you impute to the article, be supported.  
					The issue lately made up between the parties involved solely the question, what Circumstances or acts, to be performed in the neutral country, were necessary to break the continuity of a voyage, from the Colony of an enemy to its parent Country, or some  
						Enemy-country in Europe? This point had been settled as was presumed, by former decisions of the British Courts of admiralty &amp; explanations of the British Government in a manner which was so far satisfactory to the United States, as to justify a belief that if those  
						decisions &amp; explanations had been adhered to, the existing Controversy on this Subject would not have arisen. But in 1805, the British Courts of admiralty insisted on the performance of new acts in the United States, or what amounted to the same thing, extended by  
						construction the doctrine of former decisions in such a manner as to make the performance of new Acts, such too as were of a nature highly onerous &amp; oppressive, indispensably necessary. On this Special point the parties were at issue &amp; the Sole object of the article  
						was to adjust, by temporary arrangment, the Controversy on that point. The rights of the parties in every other instance not within the scope of the adjustment were to remain of Course untouched, and in that particular one to revive at the expiration of the term limited for  
						the duration of the article.  
					A concise analysis of the several orders of the British Government relative to the trade of neutral powers with enemy-Colonies will place in a Clear point of view the ground of the Controversy between the parties &amp; the precise object &amp; effect of the  
						regulation proposed by the article under Consideration. The first order bears date on the 6th: Novr. 1793. It directed the British Cruizers to bring in for lawful adjudication all vessels loaden with goods the produce of any Colony of France or Carrying provisions or supplies  
						for such Colony. That order amounted in express terms to a declaration of war, against the neutral powers, &amp; it was issued in that Spirit by the British Government. The policy however which dictated the order did not last long. Events soon produced a Change of Policy,  
						&amp; with it a revocation, or to use the technical phraseology of the admiralty, a relaxation of the order. The 2d: order was of the 8th: January 1794. It directed the Cruizers &quot;to bring in all vessels loaden with goods, the produce of the french west India Islands and  
						coming directly from any port of the said Islands to any port in Europe.&quot; This order being directory prescribed the case in which neutral vessels engaged in such a trade should be seized &amp; thereby confin’d the seizure to that case only. No vessel engaged in that trade  
						which did not come within the scope of the order, could be touched. Thus the effect of the order was to inhibit the direct trade of the United States between Enemy-Colonies and Europe in the productions of those Colonies. It left the trade free between the United States and  
						Enemy Colonies, &amp; between the United States &amp; Europe &amp; of course every other Country. It left it free also in the direct line, between Enemy-Colonies &amp; Africa, &amp; Asia. By confining the restriction to Europe those Countries were necessarily, exempted from  
						its operation. The 3d: order of the 25th. January 1798 directed the Cruizers to &quot;bring in all Vessels laden with Cargoes, the produce of any Island of France, Spain or Holland &amp; coming directly from any port of the said Islands or settlements to any port in Europe, not  
						being a port of Great Britain, nor of the Country to which such ships being neutral belonged.&quot; The sole effect of that order was to extend to the neutral powers of Europe the accomodation which had been yeilded to the United States by that of 8th: January 1794. The next order  
						bears date on the 24: June 1803. It directs the Cruizers not to seize any Vessel which shall be carrying on trade directly between the Colonies of enemies &amp; the neutral Country to which the Vessel belongs &amp; laden with the property of inhabitants of such neutral  
						Country: provided such Vessel shall not be supplying nor have supplied the Enemy on the outward voyage with any Articles of Contraband of War &amp;c:&quot; The sole object of this order appears to have been to introduce a new rule relative to Contraband, by subjecting a vessel to  
						seizure on that account, on her return voyage after depositing her Cargo at her place of destination. It prohibits the seizure of neutral Vessels, European as well as American, engaged in a trade between Enemy-Colonies &amp; the Neutral Countries by positive inhibition. That  
						trade had been left free before, by the restriction of the seizure to Vessels engaged in the direct trade between Enemy-Colonies &amp; the parent Country. It was now secured by positive inhibition. The right to carry on the trade from the neutral Country to other Countries  
						was left on the ground on which it stood before. That this order was not intended to affect that trade &amp; did not affect it is made sufficiently evident by many decisions of the Courts of Admiralty which have been given since the order was issued. In proof of this I refer  
						to all the Cases that were decided by the British Courts of admiralty, touching the trade of Neutrals with enemy-Colonies in the years 1805 &amp; 6. &amp; more especially to that of the William, Trefrey it being the last one &amp; Containing a summary of the whole  
						doctrine.  
					If we recur to the decisions of the Courts themselves we shall find a full Confirmation of what is here advanc’d. We shall find that in conforming their decisions to the spirit of the Orders of the Government, they inhibit the direct trade only between the  
						Colony and the parent Country or some other Country of Europe: that they do not call in question the trade between neutral powers in the productions of enemy-Colonies, after those productions were allowed to have been incorporated into the Stock of the Country; that they gave  
						recent &amp; high offence only by the new doctrines advancd. on this latter point, which, by assuming to investigate the motives of the parties engaged in the trade, &amp; to reject acts which were before deemed satisfactory by decisions the most solemn, &amp; to impose new  
						Conditions the most onerous &amp; oppressive, laid that Commerce completely at the Mercy of British tribunals. The most material Cases are those, of the Immanuel, which involved the question of a trade between Bordeaux &amp; St: Domingo, that is, the direct trade between the  
						parent Country &amp; its Colony, in which the goods were condemned on that Account, Robin: Rep: 2 Vol: page 186, &amp; of the Polly, Lasky in which the Vessel was taken on a voyage from Marblehead to Spain Charged with the productions of the Havanna, brought to Marblehead by  
						the same vessel. In this case the question of Continuity of Voyage was involved &amp; the Court decided in favor of the American Claim, on ground that gave no offence. It was admitted in Explicit terms by the judge that an American had a right to import the produce of the  
						Spanish Colonies into his Own Country &amp; to carry them on, thence to the General Commerce of Europe, &amp; that the landing of the Cargo &amp; payment of the duties would be sufficient criteria of a bona fide importation. 2 Rob: Rep: page 361. The next cases were those of  
						the Essex, Orne, of the Rowhena and some others of the same Kind in 1805, which turned on the point of Continuity of voyage in which the Court pushing its doctrine to the unjust &amp; pernicious extent Complained of produc’d the Controversy which took place between the  
						Countries.  
					The Communication between Mr. King and Lord Hawkesbury is of the same character. The advocate General admits in his report, which was adopted by Lord Hawkesbury and communicated by him to Mr. King, that by the relaxation of the general principle respecting  
						the trade with Enemy-Colonies it was distinctly understood &amp; had been repeatedly so decided by the Courts of appeal that the produce of Enemy Colonies might be imported into the neutral Country &amp; reexported thence even to the Mother  
							Country of such Colony; &amp; in like manner that the produce &amp; manufactures of the Mother Country might be Carried to its Colonies. He states that the direct Trade between the mother Country &amp; its Colonies had not been recognized as legal: that what amounted  
						to an intermediate importation into the Neutral Country might Sometimes be a question of difficulty; that the mere touching in the neutral Country to take fresh Clearances might perhaps be deemed evasive, &amp; in effect the direct trade; but that the high Court of Admiralty  
						had expressly decided (and he saw no reason to expect that the Court of Appeal would vary the rules) that landing the goods &amp; paying the duties in the neutral Country would break the Continuity of the Voyage, and was such an importation as would legalize the trade,  
						although the goods were reshipped in the same Vessel on account of the same proprietors, and were forwarded for sale to the mother Country of the Colony.  
					This Communication corresponds in every the minutest circumstance with the Spirit of the Orders and decisions of the Courts as above explained. It insists, and in terms that are far from being positive, that the direct trade only between the Mother Country &amp; the Colony, was inhibited. It admits that the trade through the Neutral Country to the Mother Country of the Colony, was lawful, &amp; fixes with great precision the acts to be performed in the Neutral Country, which would be  
						sufficient to incorporate the goods into the Stock of the Country, &amp; break the Continuity of the Voyage. In the latter part of the Report alluded to, the advocate General seems to make a Kind of reservation of the right of the Court of Appeal, to revise the decisions of  
						the high Court of Admiralty, which he represents to have settled the doctrine. But he makes that reservation if indeed it was intended as one, in such terms as to preclude the Idea, that it would ever be taken advantage of especially when it is considered that the Report was  
						adopted by the Government &amp; Communicated officially by the Secretary of State to a foreign minister. It is certain however that through the Court of Appeal, the new encroachment on the rights of the United States was made, which produc’d the controversy which ensued  
						immediately afterwards.  
					The discussion which took place between Lord Mulgrave &amp; myself, in 1805 on the Subject of the Seizures then made, treated the encroachment in that line as the Special cause of Complaint on the part of the United States. Altho’ the British pretension to  
						inhibit even the direct trade, has not been countenanc’d by the Government, yet the Commerce of the United States had been made in a certain degree to accomodate with it by the Merchants. They were Content to decline the direct trade &amp; to prosecute their enterprizes  
						through the United States, equally with the mother Country, &amp; its Colonies. It was natural in the Course of a Controversy which involved such important interests, that the rights of the parties should be taken up on principle &amp; carried to the greatest extent. To the  
						light thrown on the subject by a very able essay which I received from you, I was much indebted, &amp; I acknowledge in this Communication, the aid which it afforded me, with peculiar satisfaction. A vindication however of the cause on principle however extensive the range  
						might be, could not affect the Origin of the Controversy, nor give to the article entered into for its adjustment, a Construction different from that which by well established rules, is fairly applicable to it.  
					From this view of the several orders of the British Government &amp; from the exposition given of them by the Courts and by the Government itself, it appears that the sole object of those that were issued after that of 6. Novr. 1793 was to inhibit the  
						direct trade of the United States between Enemy Colonies &amp; Europe: that they did not touch and were not intended to interfere with the trade between the United States &amp; Europe, even the parent Country, &amp; a fortiori between the United States &amp; Asia &amp;  
						Africa. It was indeed the object of the order of Novr 6th: 1793, to suppress the Commerce of Neutral powerse with enemy Colonies altogether, but that being abandoned the next idea which occurred was to embarrass that trade, by forcing it thro’ neutral Countries. Here then  
						arose a new question which turned entirely on another principle. That a neutral power had a right to carry on trade from its own ports, in any articles tho’ of foreign produce, which had been incorporated into the Stock of the Country not contraband of war, and to all  
						Countries, was not controverted. That point otherwise Clear &amp; indisputable in itself, had long been settled in the highest tribunals &amp; by the most eminent jurists in England. The Circumstances which constituted such an incorporation of foreign Articles into the stock  
						of the Country, had also been settled by the same authorities. Still the question which now arose, turned on this latter point. In forcing this Commerce through neutral ports with a view to embarrass it, it became necessary, to give the greatest effect to that expedient to  
						increase the difficulties in those ports, which was done in the manner already stated.  
					If the instructions of the British Government did not inhibit the trade in question, the adjustment contained in the article under consideration, could not affect it. That Article supposes a difference between the parties,  
						relative to a trade with Enemy-Colonies, and the instructions which interfere with it. The Article could not operate on any trade to which the instructions did not extend &amp; concerning which there was no controversy. In the present case the  
						Conclusion is the more irresistable because there did not exist even a possibility of Controversy in regard to that trade.  
					But it is inferred, that because it is stipulated, that the produce of Enemy-Colonies may be carried to Europe from the United States, that the Ports of Asia and Africa are shut on them; and that because it is stipulated that the Manufactures of Europe may  
						be carried from the United States to the West Indies, that those of Asia and Africa are prohibited from being carried there. This objection has been already obviated. Had the instructions of the British Government inhibited that trade, &amp; a Controversy between the  
						Governments arisen from the inhibition, as the article does not extend to the case, the most that could have been inferred would have been, that it was unprovided for &amp; that the rights of the parties would remain in the same state respecting it as if the article had not  
						been entered into. It is easy to explain the Cause why the term &quot;Europe&quot; was introduc’d into the Article in reference to the ports to which Colony produce might be carried, and &quot;European&quot;, in reference to the Manufactures which might be carried to Enemy-Colonies, &amp; to  
						shew that they were adopted with a view to open on the widest scale the ports which had been at any time shut on them by the British orders. Altho’ the policy of these orders as well as of the principle on which they are founded, is more particularly applicable to the direct  
						trade between enemy-Colonies &amp; their Mother-Country, yet as the term &quot;Europe&quot; had been adopted in the modifications that were made in them, first at the instance of the United States, and afterwards at that of the Neutral European Powers, as the widest scale within which  
						the inhibition operated, it was thought best to use that term to prevent the possibility of mistake, as to the extent of the adjustment. Had terms of more extensive import been adopted, they could not have been more effectual to the object, while they might have tended to  
						enlarge the sphere of British pretension, by extending it to cases to which it would be highly improper to give a Sanction.  
					But it is supposed that altho’ the orders of the British Government may not have inhibited this trade, it is Comprized in the General inhibition of the British principle. If the British principle inhibits such a trade which I do not admit, it does not  
						follow that a Sanction to that inhibition, is given by this article, for reasons already stated. If the provision of that article does not extend to that trade, the rights of the parties cannot be affected by it. They remain equally in force against the principle, as against  
						the instructions, had they inhibited it. But the claim to an exemption from that trade from the operation of the British principle, rests on still stronger ground, admitting that it was extended to it, which, however I am far from admitting. It can be Shown that the orders  
						themselves, take it completely from within the scope of that principle. By instructing the Cruizers to seize vessels engaged in a particular trade, every other trade is allowed. It is in that mode, that what is called a relaxation of the British principle, is effected. The  
						order reduces the principle to its own standard, or in other words, becomes the principle itself. If this doctrine is not true it is impossible to designate in what mode the relaxation, which is universally admitted, of the British principle, is wrought; or to prove that  
						there has been any relaxation of it whatever. If the orders have not that effect of what avail are they? That they have that effect is proved by the decisions of the Courts, &amp; the practice under them. I am aware of the Broad doctrine held by the Courts on this subject,  
						but that doctrine, necessarily ambiguous from the dilemma in which the Courts were placed by the inconsistent orders of the Government, if not reconciliable to this Construction (as I think it is, when the whole subject is taken into view,) is contradicted by the decisions of  
						the same Courts &amp; the explanations of the Government itself.  
					I say that this trade is not inhibited by the British principle, because it supposes a trade between enemy-Colonies and the Mother Country. But a trade between the United States &amp; Asia or Africa, let the Subject of it be what it may, is not a trade of  
						that Kind. It is a trade with independent powers at peace with Great Britain, with whom we have a right to trade, by all the rules which G: Britain has at any time insisted on. It would be of dangerous tendency to admit that Great Britain had a pretention to interfere with  
						such a trade in any Case. After the goods are received into the United States, no matter of what articles they consist, or from what quarter they came, they are the property of the Country &amp; may of right be shipped to any other Country. The British principle does not  
						controvert this doctrine. It asserts in its evident range the right only to seize them on their route to the neutral Country and from it to the Mother Country of the Colony or some other Enemy-Country of Europe, provided they be not incorporated into the  
						stock of the Neutral Country. If they are they may go under the arrangment made to the Countries to which the British principle applies. But they require no Sanction, from the British Government, to go to those to which it does not apply. The destination of the vessel alone  
						would as I presume dispel every doubt of the legality of the trade, and preclude all farther enquiry Concerning it. The question of Continuity of Voyage could never arise in such a case. It is certain that the arrang’ment alluded to, gives no Sanction to it, &amp; for the  
						best of all reasons, that the trade was not admitted, or even contended to be comprized, within the range of British principle.  
					I shall close my remarks on this point by observing that as the arrangment of the Acts to break the Continuity of the Voyage from the United States to the parent Country, &amp; other enemy-Countries of Europe, in the produce of their Colonies &amp; from the  
						United States to those Colonies in the manufactures of Europe, is confin’d strictly to that object, the rights of the parties remain unimpaired in every other Circumstance relative to that trade: That as the Article contains no Stipulation against the direct trade from the  
						Colony to the parent Country, the right to carry on even that trade is not necessarily suspended by it: that if in any view, it can be considered as suspended, it is by implication arising out of the whole transaction rather than from the stipulation itself. How much Stronger  
						then is the Conclusion already drawn from other premises that nothing is to be deduc’d from that article to justify the Construction which has been imputed to it.  
					The remarks above made refer more particularly to a trade between the United States &amp; Europe in the produce of Enemy-Colonies. They are however equally applicable to the other objections stated in your letter, of a trade between the United States &amp;  
						Enemy-Colonies in the produce or manufactures of Africa or Asia. None of the orders alluded to, inhibit that Commerce, &amp; it is most certain that the article alluded to, gives no Sanction to such a pretension.  
					As to the Conditions by which it is agreed to break the Continuity of the Voyage, I have to observe that they are as favorable, as you had expected. We were authorized to stipulate if better conditions could not be obtained, that the goods should be landed the duties paid &amp; the Ship Changed. We Stipulated, only that the goods should be landed &amp; the duty paid making the duty on European Goods 1 per Cent: &amp; on Colony  
						productions two. By exempting the party from the necessity of changing the Ship, an important advantage was certainly secured. By fixing the duty at 1 per cent: in the one instance, &amp; at 2. in the other, it was not possible that the Slightest embarrassment should be  
						thrown in the way of the trade. The duty payable on manufactures consumed in the Country is about 15 Per Cent: &amp; on West India productions 25. The trifling amount made payable to the Country on the reexportation of the articles could not be felt by the Merchant. It would  
						fall on the European Consumer. It could not be felt as a heavy imposition on the trade itself. Our only Competitor in it, would be Great Britain; whose Merchants would labor under the disadvantages incident to war in a thousand Shapes, more especially, as the ports of the  
						whole continent would be shut on them, in not being able to get their goods into those ports, otherwise than by smuggling them: a mode which could not fail to be onerous, if it succeeded, but which was likely to fail in most cases. It should be remembered also, that the  
						encreased duties which would accrue to the Country would tend in the degree, to interest the whole Community in support of a Commerce, in which the Commercial part was most materially interested. It is the policy of the European powers having Colonies in the West Indies, to  
						make the parent Country the entre-pot of the productions of its Colonies. Is not that policy worthy the attention &amp; imitation of the United States in respect to the trade of the Colonies in question. The duty received would make some recompense to the nation for the  
						expences incurr’d &amp; Sums expended in Supporting our right to that trade. Besides by making the ports of the United States the &quot;entrepots&quot; for such productions the Country in general would derive some advantage from the Measure. Every ship engaged in the Commerce which  
						entered an American port, would bring something to, &amp; take Something from it. The vast amount of Asiatick, European &amp; West India Articles brought to our Markets would cheapen the price of those articles at home, and each ship while in port, and in the prosecution of  
						her voyage, would require supplies in provision &amp; other articles, which would raise the price of those Articles, to the great advantage of the general interest of the Country.  
					The limitation of the article to the term Specified, was a Condition which we presumed might prove advantageous to the United States, while it could not possibly injure them. It is expressly stipulated that the right of both parties shall revive at the  
						expiration of the term. Those of the United States therefore would then be in force &amp; to the full extent of their pretensions, in the Same manner, as if the Stipulation had not been entered into. In another war they might insist on Conditions which this stipulation did  
						not secure, &amp; if G: Britain did not yeild to their demand, they might resort to any expedient to compel her, which the wisdom of their Councils might dictate. Any encroachment on the part of Great Britain on their rights, as heretofore contended for, might be Considered  
						by their Government an act of hostility &amp; treated accordingly. The least favorable Conditions that she could Offer would be those already settled, which the United States might accept or reject as they thought best. As a youthful, prosperous &amp; rising nation it could  
						not be doubted that in the next war their situation would be more imposing than in the present one. The presumption is, that they would be able then to obtain better conditions than at present.  
					On the 3d: article I have to observe in addition to what is stated in our joint letter of January 3. 1807, that nothing would have been more easy than to have omitted any provisions on the subject of it, and to have plac’d that trade on the footing of the  
						most favored nation. To obtain better terms by treaty was utterly impossible. We were much inclin’d to omit any provision on the Subject, because we were aware that the arrangment made, would fall short of the expectation of our Government &amp; Country, &amp; most probably  
						subject us to censure. We acceded to that arrang’ment from a Conviction that it secur’d us better terms than we should be likely to enjoy, if left to depend on the pleasure of the British Government, Stimulated, as we Knew that was, to restrict us in it by the India Company,  
						&amp; other interests of the Country. It is impossible to conceive too high an idea of the jealousy which is entertained of the United States in a Commercial view by that Government and of the danger with which it thinks Great Britain is menac’d by their extry. prosperity and  
						rapid growth The boldness of the projects &amp; the activity &amp; ability with which they are prosecuted, by our Merchants &amp; Mariners, excite the admiration of Europe. Great Britain has seen that wherever our Citizens gaind a foothold, they never lost it. Without  
						distrusting her own means, or the hardiness &amp; activity of her people, she finds that our position, remote from Europe, contiguous to the West Indies &amp; the Southern Continent, and as near to India as herself, give us advantages against which she can not Cope. The  
						effort which we made &amp; persevered in for Several Months to gain admission into British India, on more favorable terms, &amp; the disposition which was shewn by the British Commissioners to yeild, excited a Sensation or more properly speaking an alarm in the Board of India  
						Directors and of the Commercial people in general, even among those who had no particular interest in the question, which was extremely obvious. Had we made no provision in the treaty to secure our admittance into India on certain Conditions, we had much reason to beleive  
						that that Commerce would have been fetter’d to an extreme degree &amp; in every form.  
					We were extremely anxious to provide that our Citizens might make their Shipments from Europe, to take Specie from Spain &amp; Portugal, goods from England &amp; c: and that they might touch at the Cape of Good hope, at the Isle of Bourbon, at the Mauritius  
						&amp;c: that they might carry on the Coasting trade in India and be permitted to pass from Calcutta to China. Those advantages were insisted on, but the pressure which we made, produc’d reports from the Board of Directors at the Instance of the Government, and from political  
						Men conversant in these topicks, which fixed the Government in its decision not to grant them. I repeat however that it would have been easy to have omitted the regulation from the treaty &amp; plac’d the trade on the footing of the most favored nation, as it would have been  
						at any time afterwards, had the state of affairs in other respects permitted it.  
					By your instructions a provision in favor of indemnity was not made an indispensable Condition of a treaty. We were authorized to Conclude one without it. We were therefore persuaded that the ground on which that Interest was plac’d could not fail to be  
						approv’d. The arrang’ment which we made authorized a just Claim to expect a dismission, of all the Causes, that were depending in the Courts of admiralty, and even to an indemnity in the Cases of Condemnation. The documents which we forwarded to you in our joint letter of  
							 give a full view of the subject &amp; to them I beg to refer.  
					Your 5th: objection applies to the 18 &amp; 19 articles of the treaty, and in the first instance to the prohibition it Contains of extending the priviledges which are made reciprocal between the parties to other nations, which is supposed to be a breach of  
						neutrality. Had I conceived that those articles were justly exposed to that imputation, I should certainly not have assented to them. But I saw no foundation for the imputation. With Spain &amp; Holland we have treaties which secure them all the rights to which they are  
						entitled. It is usual &amp; certainly proper for a nation in estimating its claims on other powers, to examine its treaties with them, &amp; not to think of setting up a pretension beyond the limit of such treaties. By treaty, neither of those powers have  
						any right in the case in question nor have we in the ports of either. By treaty, G: Britain had enjoyed those rights in the ports of the United States, as we had in her ports from the year 1794. Spain &amp; Holland, Knew the Conditions of that treaty which was in force at the  
						Commencement of the present war, &amp; sometime afterwards, &amp; would have been in force till late in the last year, had a Special Condition of the 12th. Article been carried into effect. To renew the treaty in the express terms of the former one; a treaty which deprived no  
						one power of any existing Conventional right; which subjected none to conditions to which they had not been always subjected; which allowed to Great Britain on principles of reciprocity, a priviledge which there was no reason to presume that any other power, especially Spain  
						would consent to reciprocate with the United States, did not seem to be liable to the objection stated to it. The General principle, which you advance, of extending those priviledges to as small a number of powers as possible, had also some weight in inducing us to accede to  
						the arrang’ment. France is admitted to an enjoyment of them in the same extent with Great Britain. She therefore has no cause of Complaint. I do not think that the Stipulation forbids any arrang’ment of the Government, relative to the number of Ships of War, that shall be  
						admitted into the ports of the United States at one time, or any regulation relative to their Conduct while within the ports of the United States, provided it be general &amp; equally applicable to both powers. A Stipulation that the Ships of war of each nation shall be  
						hospitably received into the ports of the other does not necessarily imply that there is to be no rule as to the numbers to be admitted into the ports to which they shall be confined, or the order they shall observe while in port. All these topicks have been at all times as I  
						have reason to beleive the object of regulation by Great Britain, and I have equal reason to beleive that the Government did not consider itself as having abandoned its right to regulate them by this article.  
					Your next objection applies to the last paragraph of the 19th: taken in Connection with the 12th. Article. By your Construction of those parts of the treaty, the United States would be bound to claim redress in favor of Great Britain of her enemies, for any  
						acts of hostility which they might Commit on her Ships of war or Merchant Vessels, within the additional limit, while she might Commit, with impunity, like acts of hostility on the ships of war &amp; merchant vessels of her enemies, in case they did not acknowledge it, &amp;  
						against their Ships of war in case they did, altho’ her own ships of war in both cases would be protected within it. I was decidedly of opinion &amp; still am, that while those Articles secure to the United States an unconditional advantage, none whatever is stipulated by  
						them in favor of Great Britain, which must not of necessity be common to her enemies, that her priviledge on the Contrary, whatever it may be, must be founded on their Consent, follow, &amp; terminate with it.  
					The 12th. Article Stipulates that G: Britain shall not stop the vessels of the United States within 5 Marine Miles of their Coast, except for the purpose of examining whether they be, American, or those of another power; and that she shall not stop the  
						unarmed vessels of other powers within the same limit, provided they acknowledge it, except to ascertain whether they belong to those, who have acknowledged it. The vessels of the powers who do not adopt the regulation are not affected by it. They remain under the ordinary  
						protection of the Law of Nations which extends to the distance of Cannon Shot or three miles from the Coast. Beyond that limit the enemies of Great Britain have a right to search &amp; seize her Vessels, without being amenable to the United States, &amp; the same right is  
						reserved to her by this article, as if it had not been entered into. Vessels of war are expressly excluded from the advantage of the regulation.  
					It is the sole object of the 12th: Article to secure to the United States an accomodation, by extending their jurisdiction on their Coast, in what concerns themselves, from 3 to 5 Miles. The stipulation is unconditional as to them, but conditional as to  
						other powers, dependant on their acknowledging the Same limit. It is made reciprocal by being extended to the British dominions Northward of the United States, a circumstance which merits attention, as it precludes the idea that any other equivalent was expected or intended  
						to be given for it. It would have been extended to the dominions of Great Britain in Europe &amp; elsewhere, had the British Commissioners desired it. They declin’d it from a fear that it might produce some innovation in the General doctrine of the law of nations on the  
						subject. This is I think fairly to be inferr’d from the instrument itself.  
					The last paragraph of the 19th. article stipulates that neither of the parties shall permit the ships or goods belonging to the Subjects or Citizens of the other, to be taken within cannon shot of the Coast, nor within the jurisdiction described in Article  
						12th: so long as the provisions of the said Article shall be in force, by the Ships of war of other powers; but in case it should so happen, the party whose territorial rights shall have been violated, shall endeavor to obtain from the offending party full &amp; ample  
						satisfaction for the vessel or vessels so taken, whether the same be vessels of war or Merchant vessels.  
					If any advantage is given to Great Britain by the arrangement proposed by the 12th: article &amp; this clause of the 19th:, to the prejudice of her enemies, or of the United States, it must be by this Clause. She can certainly claim none under the 12th.  
						article. This Clause consists of two distinct members, of very different import. The first Contains a general stipulation conformable to the law of nations, applicable to all the dominions of both parties, &amp; equally so to their ships of war &amp; merchant vessels. With  
						respect to the latter however it is conditional. The second member applies to the arrang’ment made in the 12th article, &amp; in the sense &amp; Spirit of that article. If the 12th. article is carried into effect in favor of other powers, which can only be done by their  
						consent, then the advantage which is secur’d to them by it, will accrue likewise to Great Britain. What is that advantage? Protection to their Merchant vessels within the additional two Miles, &amp; nothing else. It is obvious that the protection which is stipulated in favor  
						of ships of war is provided for, by the first member of the Clause &amp; not by the second. It cannot be by both, for the distance defined by them is different, it being 3 Miles in one, &amp; 5 in the other. It is equally obvious that the stipulation contained in the second  
						Member of the clause, relative to the 12th. article, is intended to operate in the spirit of that article &amp; to be made dependant on it. By the terms &quot;nor within the jurisdiction described in Art: 12th. so long as the provisions of the said article shall be in force&quot; the  
						stipulation Contemplated is made conditional. In force, in respect to whom? Not the United States because it was unconditional as to them. It was Conditional only with respect to other powers. Other reasons might be given to shew that the arrang’ment under Consideration is  
						not liable to the objection made to it, but I presume that those stated will be satisfactory.  
					The difficulty to obtain the accomodation which was yeilded in the 12th. article, was extreme. We labor’d most earnestly to extend it to other powers, without their Consenting, to reciprocate it in favor of Great Britain; but that could not be accomplish’d.  
						The British Commissioners urged that as Great Britain predominated at sea, &amp; must lose by the Concession in any form, it would be unjust for her to make the Concession in their favor, unless they would allow her the advantage of it. Finding that it was impossible to  
						extend the additional limit to other powers, on other terms, we thought it adviseable to adopt the arrang’ment in respect to them, conditionally, putting it in their power to accept or reject it, as they thought fit. We flatter’d ourselves that as they Could not lose by it,  
						they would not refuse their assent to an arrang’ment by which they might gain, especially as it would prove advantageous to a friendly power. We deemed it highly important to establish the additional limit in favor of the United States, from the advantage it might afford to  
						their Commerce within it, and from the effect which the Measure seemed likely to produce on the future conduct of the British Squadrons on our Coast, by whom it could not fail to be consider’d as a severe Censure on the past.  
					It is readily admitted that more suitable terms might have been adopted to accomplish the object in view. But it ought to be recollected that as the right of jurisdiction imposes of necessity the obligation of protection, without a Special exception to it,  
						there was some difficulty in making an arrang’ment, which should secure to the United States the advantage, which they desir’d, &amp; at the same time exempt them from the duty incident to it.  
					To your 6th: objection, little need be added to what is stated on the subject of it in our letter of January 3d: 1807. As the paper of the British Commissioners to which it relates, had no sanction whatever from us, as was fully shewn by that letter, the  
						objection cannot be said to apply to any part of our Conduct. The paper was produc’d by the decree of the Emperor of France of the 21st. November 1806, and was intended by the British Commissioners, to operate as a reservation of right, in their Government, not to ratify the  
						treaty, or not to be precluded, under certain Circumstances, in case it did ratify it, from adopting such measures, as it might find necessary, to counteract the restrictions imposed by that decree. The exercise of the right reserved was made dependant on the abandonment of  
						the principle of that decree by the french Government, or an assurance from the Government of the United States, or such Conduct as would be equivalent, that the pretension would not be submitted to by it. We apprized the British Commissioners that our Government would enter  
						into no engag’ment whatever, of what it would do, in any Case, with another power. Had the treaty been ratified, even without any notice being taken of that paper, it could not have imposed the slightest obligation on the United States, either to perform any act on their  
						part, or to submit to any, on the part of Great Britain. I had supposed however in the Case of ratification, that we should have been instructed to present to the British Government, with the instrument of ratification, a Counter declaration to that effect. The whole subject  
						was before our Government with our strong and decided objection to the paper. All that we could do was to transmit it to you, with a correct statement of what had occurred in the negotiation respecting it, which we did. To the Government it belonged to take the step which the  
						occasion requir’d, not to us.  
					Having notic’d the objections which are specially stated in your letter of May 20th: 1807 and given our view of the several parts of the treaty to which they relate, I shall proceed to make explanatory remarks on the other articles, in order to do justice  
						to the Conduct of the American Commissioners in regard to them.  
					Art: 5o. You admit that this article is an essential improvement of that on the same subject in the treaty of 1794. It certainly improves it in two important interests; 1st. in that of the navigation of the United States &amp; 2d. in that of duties on  
						American productions carried to the British Market. The tonnage on American ships in British ports had been raised to  sterling Per ton, while that on British ships in the ports of the United States was only 50 Cents or 2/ 3 Per ton; and  
						the duty on the bulky productions of the United States in American bottoms, had been raised to such a height, under the Countervailing regulations which the treaty allowed, as to secure in time of peace, the entire carriage of those productions to British Vessels, if indeed  
						it did not materially affect the price of the Articles themselves. What made it more unfortunate, was, that the United States could not adopt any Measure to remedy those evils without Committing a direct &amp; palpable violation of the treaty, as they were bound by it not to  
						raise the existing duties higher than they were at the time the treaty was concluded. Those evils would however have been completely done away by this Article. By it the United States would have had, a right to raise the duty on British vessels, to any height to which the  
						British Government might raise it on theirs; a check which could not fail to prove adequate to the object; while they had also a right to give what preference they thought fit, to their own vessels, which might be done by reducing the duty on them below the tonnage which was  
						imposed on those+ of Great Britain.+ This arrang’ment secur’d to the United States an advantage which Great Britain could not countervail, as the necessity she is under to avail herself of every resource, which she can command, to raise revenue for indispensable purposes,  
						renders it impossible for her to make a like discrimination in favor of her own vessels. The inhibition of all discriminating duties on the productions of the one, &amp; manufactures of the other party, whether they be carried in American or British bottoms, was a stipulation  
						which it was presumed would also prove highly advantageous to the United States. The pernicious tendency of that principle was well Known to you &amp; we were happy to be able to suppress it.  
					The objections which you urge to other parts of the Article apply to clauses in the treaty of 1794, which it was impossible for us to Change. I have however to observe that there is nothing in it to prevent the passage of a navigation act provided it be  
						adopted as a measure of general policy. Most of the nations of Europe especially France would be happy, in a general view, to see the United States resort to that expedient to counteract the restrictive system of England; and as it is one which could not essentially affect  
						them, they could find no motive of that Kind, to inspire a wish to oppose it; Nor could the United States, as I supposed, find one to exempt them from it.  
					We regretted that we could not obtain a stipulation which should Compell Great Britain to repeal the Laws which impose so high a duty on her manufactures, when exported to the United States. Our letter shew’d that we did every thing in our power to obtain  
						such a stipulation. I was however persuaded that the want of it would not expose us to all the evils which you seem to apprehend from it, admitting that the British Construction of that Clause in the former treaty was a sound one, And that nothing is contained in the 23d.  
						article of the present one, to discountenance it. It is certain that no Government will ever tax exports higher than indispensable necessity compells it; because such a tax tends in all cases essentially to check industry, and to destroy the most productive source of national  
						prosperity. The inhibition imposed by the Constitution of the United States, on the Congress, to tax, in the slightest degree, their exports, affords a strong argument, drawn, from the acknowledged wisdom of its framers, against the policy of such a tax, in the abstract; and  
						I am persuaded that the reasons against it are as strong with Great Britain, if not stronger than with any other nation. Without taking a more comprehensive view of the subject, it is sufficient to observe, that a tax on British exports must operate as a bounty in favor of  
						American Manufactures, which are already in an advanced state, in certain parts of the union. Great Britain must be sensible of this fact, and aware of the encourag’ment which the present export duty gives them, and of the Consequences attending it. I should presume that  
						there was not much cause to apprehend, that she would tax the export of her Manufactures, to the United States, to prevent their being sent thence to other Countries. The sole effect of such a tax would be to secure to her own vessels the carriage of the articles, if indeed  
						that were attainable. In both Cases the manufactures of Great Britain would be the Subject of the Commerce. The supply of the Great, the productive, and increasing markets of the United States, must be a primary object of British policy, &amp; Great Britain would doubtless be  
						cautious not to hazard it for one comparatively of much less importance.  
					Art: 6o.  
					As this article was approv’d I shall only observe, that I considered the reservation contained in it important, as it enabled the United States to counteract the British policy in respect to the trade with the West Indies, which is the object of it, by means  
						the most efficacious, whenever they should be resorted to. The trade of Great Britain with the United States is carried on principally by circuitous voyages in which her vessels pass from the ports of the United States to the W: Indies. By suspending the intercourse between  
						the United States &amp; her W: Indies, in British Vessels, the Chain would be broken, &amp; the whole Commerce in such Vessels, be, in a great measure suspended. The provision in the article obviously looks to such an object, and the time of carrying it into effect, unless  
						the trade should be plac’d on satisfactory ground, would have depended altogether on the United States.  
					Having already notic’d the subjects which are embrac’d by the following articles, I shall add but little more, on any of them, to what is said in our joint letter of January 3: 1807. The 7th: was taken literally from the treaty of 1794. The 8th: &amp; 9th:  
						amended, as you allow, the articles in that treaty on the same subject. The 10th: relative to Blockade, taken in Connection with the British paper of Decr: 31. 1806, plac’d, as I presumed, that interest on ground which would be satisfactory. The preamble cannot affect it  
						unfavorably, as it does not alter the acknowledged Law. The only effect which it could have would be to admonish the Courts to be cautious in admiting evidence of notice, on account of the distance of the United States from the blockaded ports. It was supposed to give the  
						United States a Claim to a more favorable rule in respect to evidence, than was allowed to powers more Contiguous to the Threatre of action. The doctrine contained in Mr. Merry’s note to you was not contested by the British Commissioners. It is on the Contrary maintained in  
						their note to us of Dec: 31st. 1806, in which it is asserted to be notorious &quot;that the King did not declare any ports to be in a state of blockade without alloting to that object a force sufficient to make the entrance into them manifestly dangerous.&quot; I quote the passage in  
						their note to observe that the doctrine is not made conditional on any other part of it, but is laid down as the established law. It justifies the additional remark that the preamble was not intended, and cannot be construed to alter the Law. It follows that it cannot produce  
						any other effect than that which is above imputed to it.  
					The 13th: article relates to the search of merchant Vessels and differs from the 19th: of the treaty of 1794, in the introductory sentence, which enjoins it on the Commanders of ships of war &amp; privateers, to observe in the Course of the war, which may  
						then exist, as much as possible, the acknowledged rules &amp; principles of the Law of nations; and also in the penal sum, which it increases, to be given by the Commanders of privateers before they receive their Commissions, as a security for their good conduct under them.  
						It was supposed that in this, as in the preceding case, the law remains untouch’d and that the stipulation produc’d no other effect, than to injoin it on the Governments respectively, to be particularly attentive to the Conduct of its officers in the  
						respect alluded to.  
					The 13th: article and the paper of the British Commissioners of the 31. of Dec: 1806, obviously look to the Russian Convention, as the standard of the acknowledged Law respecting the search of Merchant Vessels &amp; blockade. That instrument, was held  
						constantly in view on both sides, in every discussion on those subjects, and indeed in every other, to which it extends, and its doctrine admitted especially in those to be the establish’d law. We were extremely desirous and used our best exertions, to introduce articles to  
						the same effect, into our treaty, but it was utterly impossible to accomplish it. It must however be allowed that if engagements of the Kind alluded to, especially in regard to blockade, for which there was a Special document, would not be observed, that it would be useless  
						to stipulate them by treaty.  
					On the subject of the 17th: article I have already made some remarks under another head. I cannot think that a Stipulation to receive the ships of war of each party, hospitably into the ports of the other, restrains them from limiting the number of Ships to  
						be admitted at one time; or from designating the ports to which they shall be admitted. A Stipulation to admit them settles only, as I presume, the principle, that they shall be admitted and leaves open to arrang’ment the other points Connected with it. This opinion is  
						supported by a passage in the article itself, as to the ports, which secures, to vessels which might be driven by stress of weather &amp;c: into ports not open to them in ordinary cases, an hospitable reception in such ports. Had the right to designate the ports been given up  
						by the General Stipulation, there would have been no necessity for that contained in this passage. The remark is equally applicable to the other case, that of the number to be admitted at one time. As that, must be an affair of special &amp; strict regulation, an exception  
						which admitted more, by securing rights to them in case they enter’d, would necessarily defeat the limitation itself.  
					The stipulation which relates to the Good treatment of the officers of each party in the ports of the other, being reciprocal, contains no reflection on one, which is not applicable to the other; and I will venture to affirm that it is equally necessary in  
						regard to Great Britain as to the United States. It is well Known in respect to the latter, that the passions, which were excited by the Revolution, did not long survive the struggle, that the sword was no sooner sheathed, than the Calamities of the war were forgotten. The  
						injured are always the first to forgive. It is however just to remark that time has essentially effac’d, from the people of both nations, the hostile impression, which that arduous conflict produc’d The 23d. article was thought to contain an useful stipulation by securing to  
						the United States the advantages in navigation &amp; Commerce which Great Britain might afterwards grant to any other nation. That stipulation was obviously founded on the right of the most favor’d nation &amp; subject of Course to the Conditions incident to it. It amounts to  
						this, that if Great Britain should concede any accomodation to another power in commerce with her East or West India Colonies, or any other part of her dominions, gratuitously, the United States would be entitled to it on the same terms, but if she made such accomodation in  
						consideration of certain equivalents to be given her in return, that the United States would not be entitled to those advantages without paying the equivalents. The doctrine is the same in its application to the United States. If they should grant any priviledges in trade to  
						France or Spain for admission into their West India Colonies, Great Britain would be entitled to the same, provided she admitted the United States into her Islands also &amp; not otherwise. I could not perceive therefore how it was possible that the United States should be  
						injured by the stipulation contained in this article; while it was probable that they might derive some advantage from it. It could not restrain them from passing a navigation act to place them on an equal footing with Great Britain, especially if it was made general or  
						applied only to her &amp; the other nations having such acts. The right to pass such an act was not taken away by any other stipulation in the treaty and there was nothing in this article that had such a tendency. The terms &quot;shall Continue to  
						be on the footing of the most favored nation &amp;c&quot; refer to the principles established by the preceeding article and not to the existing Laws or regulations of either party. If the latter was the Case, it would follow, that the tonage duties, the discriminating duties  
						&amp;c: would remain as they were. The preceeding articles were intended, in the points to which they extended, to establish a standard of equality between the parties, to which the regulations of each, whether they exceeded or fell short of it, should be brought. It could  
						not be doubted that the British export duty was of the first description, that it violated the principle of the most favor’d nation. The British Commissioners admitted the fact, and did not pretend to justify it on that ground. They urged in its favor only, that the same duty  
						was imposed on exports to their own colonies in America, &amp; that if any Change was made in it, to satisfy the claim of the United States on the principle, of the right of the most favor’d nation, it would be to raise it on the goods exported to other Countries, not to  
						reduce it on those sent to the United States. The principle however established by this article being applicable to that duty, it was to be presumed that it might fairly be relied on to obtain a modification of it either by reducing the duty on exports to the United States or  
						raising it on those to other nations. There is nothing in this article to restrain the United States from adopting measures to counteract the British policy with respect to the West Indies. If that object had not been secured by a special article, from the probability of  
						being affected by the others, the principle, established by the present one, could not have affected it, otherwise than beneficially.  
					Having replied to your objections to the several articles of the treaty, &amp; the papers connected with it, and given our view of them, I shall proceed to make some remarks on the whole subject to do justice to the Conduct of the American Commissioners in  
						that transaction.  
					In every case which involved a question of neutral right, or even of commercial accomodation, G: Britain was resolved to yeild no ground which she could avoid, and was evidently prepared to hazard war, rather than yeild much. There seemed to be no mode of  
						compelling her to yeild, than that of embarking in the war with the opposite belligerent, on which great question, it belonged to the National councils to decide. We had pressed the Claims of the United States in the negotiation to the utmost limit that we could go, without  
						provoking that issue. It is most certain that better terms could not have been obtained at the time we signed the treaty than it contains.  
					The state of the war in Europe suggested likewise the propriety of caution on our part. Russia was then on the side of England, and likely to continue so; and Austria, Known to be in the same interest, was holding an equivocal attitude, &amp; ready to take  
						advantage of any favorable event that might occur. Prussia, lately powerful had been defeated, but was not absolutely subdued; her King the Ally &amp; friend of Alexander, Kept the feild with him, and made head against France. The Emperor of France far remov’d from his  
						dominions, was making the bold and dangerous experiment, of the effect which his absence might produce in the interior, &amp; in a situation to be compelled to risk every thing, if pressed by his adversary, on the precarious issue of a single battle. Those were strong reasons  
						why we should not throw ourselves too decisively into that scale.  
					The situation of the United States always a respectable one, was then less imposing than it usually was. It was Known that they were not on good terms with Spain, &amp; that France was the Ally of Spain. Their interior too was disturbed by a Conspiracy of  
						doubtful extent &amp; dangerous tendency, the consequences of which were sure to be greatly magnified by all who were unfriendly to our happy system of Government. Those Circumstances could not fail to be taken into view, by any the most friendly administration in England,  
						when pressed to make concessions which it was unwilling to make. Add to those Considerations the important one, that the British Ministry had become much impaired in its strength, especially in what concerned the United States, by the death of a very eminent &amp;  
						distinguished statesman, &amp; had not the power, or thought that it had not, to pursue a liberal policy towards the united States, and that its power was evidently daily diminishing.  
					These considerations induc’d us to sign the treaty &amp; submit it to the wisdom of our Government, after obtaining the best conditions that it was possible to obtain. We were aware that in several points it fell short of the just claims of our Country. But  
						we were persuaded that such an arrang’ment was made of the whole subject as justified us in the part which we took. In the rejection or adoption of the treaty I felt no personal interest. Having discharged my duty with integrity and zeal, I neither wished applause or dreaded  
						censure. Having the highest Confidence in the wisdom, the rectitude &amp; patriotism of the administration, I was satisfied that it would pursue the course, which an enlightened view of the publick Interest, and a just sensibility to the national honor, might dictate.  
					Our letter of January 3. was written in haste and was deficient in many of the explanations which would otherwise have been given of the treaty. I was happy when at Washington to find that you were perfectly willing to receive any explanations which I might  
						now be disposed to give of that transaction, and to allow them the weight which they might deserve. In making this Communication I have indulged the freedom which belonged to it, in full confidence that it would be approved.  
					I cannot conclude this letter without adding my most ardent wish, that the administration may succeed in conducting our affairs with every power to the happiest result. My retirement which had been long desired, &amp; delay’d only by the arduous &amp; very  
						important duties in which I was engaged, had become necessary as a releif to my mind, after much fatigue, and to the Interest of my family which had been neglected &amp; greatly injur’d by my absence in the publick service. It is still my desire to cherish retirement. Should  
						it however be our unfortunate destiny, which I most earnestly hope will not be the case, to be involved in foreign war or domestic trouble, and should my services be deemed useful, I will not hesitate, at the desire of the administration, to repair again   
					to the Standard of my Country. I have the honor to be with great Consideration, &amp; esteem Your very obed. Servt.

It appears by your lcUcr of May 20th,  
1807, which was forwarded by Mr. Purvi­  
«nce to Mr. Pinkney and mvsclf, at London,  
and received on the 16.h July, that you had  
construed several articles of the treaty,  
which wc had signed with the British com­  
missioners, &#x27;he 31st of December, 1806, in  
a different sense from that in which they  
were conceived by us. As the course we  
wet e instructed to pursue, by your letter  
of February 3d, with regard to that treaty,  
which was confirmed in that of May 20iii,  
w ts in no degree dependent on cur con­  
struction of any of its articles, or on the po­  
litical considerations which induced us to  
■dgn it, wc deemed it unnecessary to enter  
into any explanation in reply, either of our  
construction of its articles, or of the politi­  
cal considerations alluded to. YVe thought  
it more consistent with our duty, to look  
solely to the object of our instructions, and  
to exert our utmost efforts to accomplish  
it; and wc acted in conformity to that sen­  
ament. The result of those efforts was  
made .known, by the documents which 1  
had the honor to present to you, when I was  
lately at Washington, being copies of n joint  
dispatch, which Mr. Pink.iev and I had for.  
warded by Mr. Rove. YVe had flattered  
jourselves, that it might have been practi­  
I cable to obtain the amendments of the trea­  
| ty which the president desired, as the state  
of affairs in Europe had become more fa­  
vorable ro such a result; but in that we  
were disappointed. YY&#x27;t found no difficul­  
ty in accomplishing the other object, oi set­  
ting it as:de, as we were instructed to do,  
in erse the proposed amendments were not  
acceded to.  
At this time there is no objection to  
  
-‘i cxpiinitioii) tlinl a am aware an*l  
there are many reasons why it should be pi  
ven. You will be sensible that, so Ur as an  
unfavorable estimate is entertained of that  
transaction, it must, in the degree, tend  
to injure those who gave it the sanction of  
their names ; aim you tv li be equally sensi­  
&gt;le that, it the U. S. arc in any degree in­  
terested in it, at this time, it must consist  
in its being viewed in a just, rather than an  
unfavorable light. In retiring from the sta  
t on which I have lately held, this is the lust  
act of public and private duty, which I have  
to perform, in relation to it.&#x27; It is to me, in  
many y ews, a painful duty, but still it is  
one which it is highly incumbent on me to  
execute.  
It is far from being my desire to compro­  
mit Mr. Pinkney, in this letter, in the sligh­  
e*t circumstance. In the management of  
the business widen was entrusted to us joint­  
ly, we acted with the greatest harmony,  
and exerted our best efforts to accomplish  
the object of our instructions. I am not a.  
ware that, in speaking of .my part of the  
treaty, I shall give it aconsttuction in which  
he would not concur ; but that presumpti­  
on is founded altogether on what tool; pl&#x27;.cc  
between us in the course of the negot iation  
To ih!3 communication he is not a party  
nor indeed &lt;lo&lt; s he know that such a nnei  
will be made. In every view, therefore,it*  
is impioper, and would he unjust, that &#x27;he*  
should be considered as having any concern!  
in it. j  
i he impressment of seamen from our  
merchant vessels is a t. pic which claims a  
primary attention, from the order which i  
holds in your letter, but more especially  
trom some important considerations that  
are connected with it. The idea entertain­  
ed by the publm is, that the rights of the  
U. S. were abandoned by the American com­  
missioners in the tain ncgociatlcn, and that  
their seamen were left hv mri* am,i  
  
cence, if not by fornmi renunciation,  
i&gt;en&lt;l tor tlieir safety, on the mercy of the I  
British ciuizers. I have, on the contrary,I  
always believed, and still do believe, that&#x27;  
tin: ground on which that interest was pin-1  
oed by the pap - of the Britinh commissi-j  
oners of Nov. 8, 18o6, and the explanations j  
which accompanied it, was both honoi ubU *  
and advantageous to the U. S. that*it ton-1  
tallied a concession in their favor, on the I  
part of (ire t Britain, on the great princi­  
ple in contestation, never before made !»v a  
formal and obligato- y act of the government,  
which w;&gt;» highly favorable to their inf« r­  
ist , r.nd tiiat it also itnnovd on her the  
obligation to conform her practice t.ncier it,  
till a more ci mplclc arrangement should be  
concluded, to the just ctslm* of tto U. S.  
To place this transnethm hi its true light,  
and to do justice to the conduct oft bo Ame­  
rican commissioners, It will be necessary to  
cn er at some length into the subject.  
» The British paper stales that the king  
wrsnet prepared to disclaim or doror-ac  
irotn a right on which the sccUriP of the  
British navy might essentially dej* nd, e*;­  
penally In a conjuncture when he was&#x27; en­  
gaged in wars which enforced the necessi­  
ty of the most vigilant attention to he pre­  
servation and supply of his nav ,1] force ;  
that he had directed his commits mrrs to  
give to th« commissioner* of the L. States  
the most positive assurances that bstrocti­  
ons had been given, and .should be repeat­  
ed and enforced, to observe the greatest  
c-ution in the impressing of Brit sh reumeii,*  
10 preserve the citizens of the W s. from  
molt station or injury, and that im.cd&#x27;nte  
ant} prompt redress should he *fT&gt;it1rd cn  
any representation of injury susuised In  
  
them It tacn proposes to postpone the ar-&#x27;  
tide relative to impressment on account of  
the difficulties which were experienced in  
arranging any article on that subject, and  
to proceed to conclude a treaty on the other  
points that were embraced by the negnei­  
ation. As a motive to such postponement,  
and the condition of it, it assures us that  
tvic British commissioners were instructed  
still to entertain the discussion of any plan  
whlc.lt could be devised to secure the inter­  
ests of both states withjut injury to the  
rights of either.  
By this paper it is evident that the rights  
of the U. S. were expressly to be reserved,  
and not abandoned, as has been most er­  
roneously suvjposed; that the negociation  
on the subject of impressment was to be  
postponed lor n limited time, and for a spe­  
cial object only, and to be revived as soon  
as that object was accomplished; and, in  
the interim, that the practice of impress­  
ment was to correspond essentially with the  
views and interests of the U. S. It is, in­  
deed, evident, from a correct view of theI  
contents of that paper, that G. Britain re­  
Uised to disclaim or derogate only from  
what she called her right, as it also is, that  
as her refusal was made applicable to a  
crisis of extraordinary peril, i; authorised  
the reasonable expectation, if not the just  
claim, tha‘ even in that the accommodation  
ties1 red would be hereafter yielded.  
In our letter to you of Nov. 11. which  
accompanied the paper under considerati­  
on, and in that ot January 3, which was  
iorwarued with the treaty, these sentiments  
were fully confirmed. In that oi Nov 11,  
we communicated one important fact,  
which left no doubt of the sense in which it  
was intended by the British commissioners,  
that that paper should be construed by us  
In calling jour attention to the passage  
which treats cf impressment, in reference  
to the practice which should be observed  
in future, we remarked that the terms  
“ high »uas” were not mentioned in it, 5c ad­  
Jed that we knew th,.t the omission bad been  
intentional. It was impassible that those  
terms could have been omitted inhntional­  
!y with our knowledge, for any purpose o  
thrr than to admit a construction that it  
was intended that impressments should be  
confined to the land. I do not mean tnim.  
  
Ply that it was understood between th  
British commissioners and m, j. a G Bri  
tain should unundon the practice of impress­  
ment on the high se. s altogether. I mean,  
however, distinctly to state that it was un  
derstood that the. practice heretofore pur  
sued by her should be abandoned, a*.d that  
no impressment aHouTd be made od tnenip  
seas under the obligation of that p.per,* -  
ct pt in cases «t an extraordinary naturi  
to which no gtoerai prohibition against i  
could be construed fairly to extend. Tin  
cases to which I a]aide were described it  
our letter of Nov. 11 i hey suppose, a  
British ship of war and a me- ., bant vessel  
of the Vj. S lying in the Tagus or some o  
tt.er port, the desertion of some of the sailors  
from the ship of war 10 the merchant vcs_  
sel, and the sailing of the latter with such  
deserters cn board, they being British sub­  
jects. ^Jt was admitted that no ge..eral  
prohibition against impressment coukl be  
construed to sanction such cases ofinjust.ee  
and fi «iud j and to such cases it was under*  
s ond that the practice should in future be  
confined.  
It is a just claim on our part, that the ex­  
planations which were given of that paper  
by the British commissioners when they  
pi esonted it to us, and afterwards while the  
negociation was depending, which wc rnm­  
niiinica’ed to you in due order of time, should  
bctal-en into view, in a fair estimate of out  
conduct in that transaction. As ihe ar­  
rangement which they proposed, was of an  
informal nature resting on an understand­  
ing between the parties in n certain degree  
cor. it den tii*. i, it c&lt; nid not othcrw ise than hap­  
pen that such explanations would be given  
us in the course of t.ie business, of the  
views of thtir government in regard to it.  
And it an arrangement by Informal under­  
standing is admi s !j!c in any case between  
nations, it was our duty to receive those ex­  
planations, to give them the weight to which  
tlicv were ilistlv entillffl I . - ..T  
  
cate them to you, with our impression of the  
extent of the obhgation, which they impo­  
sed. It is in that mode only that what is  
culled an infi.&#x27;nul understanding between  
nations can be entered into. 11 presumes a  
V m-. of precision in the written documents  
connected with it, which is supplied by mu­  
&gt; ial explanations and confidence. V?educe  
the transaction to form and it becomes a  
&#x27;reruy. 1 hat an informs) understanding  
wns an admissible mode of arrangin&#x27; this  
interest with Great Britain is made suflivi­  
&quot;T Uy y(mr ,etter of F«i»rtiary  
3d, 1MT, in reply to ours of Nov. 11, of the  
preceding yei.r  
Vi ithou relying, however, on the cxpla­  
i.nt.ons that were given by the British com  
rniRo.oners of t.»e import cf that paper, or  
thdr tf&quot;eri»i,,£nt&#x27;in­  
tended to pursue under it, it is fair to rc­  
maig on the paper itself, that as by it the  
rigntsuf the parties were reserved, and the

it by the other,  
1?| cs to the latur a j\nt r.laim to such a  
•he °&quot; SlC *&gt;wt of *‘frrmcr. Bui  
•ntertaiomett of a ncg. t^Utioo for the  
  
1 express purpose of securing interests sanc­  
«oned by acknowledged riglrs, makes such  
claim irresistible. YVe were, therefore, de­  
cidedly of opinion, that the paper of the  
British commissioners placed the interest  
of impressment on ground which it was  
both suie and honora&#x27;de for the U. S. fo ad­  
mit: that in short it gave their govern.,  
ment the command of the subject for eve­  
ry necessary tnd useful purpose.  
Attached to the treaty it was the basis or  
condition, on which the tre .ty res ed,_  
Strong in i s character in their favor on the  
great question of right, and admitting a fa­  
vorable construction on others, it placed  
them on more elevated ground in those res­  
pects than they had held before ; and by.  
keeping the negociation open to obtain a  
more complete adjustment, the administra­  
tion was armed with the most effectual  
means of securing it. By this arrangement  
the government possessed a power to co­  
erce without being compelled to assume the  
character belonging to coercion, and it was  
l»b!c to give effect to that power without  
violating the relations of amitv between  
the countries. The right to break r.l!&#x27; the  
negociation and appeal to force, could ne­  
ver lie lost sight of in any discussion on the  
subject; while there was no obligation to  
make that appeal till necessity compelled  
it. If (it. Britain conformed her practice  
to the rule prescribed by the paper of No  
vember 8, and the explanations which ac­  
companied it, our government might rest  
on that ground with advantage; bu- if she  
departed from that i ule and a favorable op­  
portunity offered for the accomplishment  
of a more complete and satisfactory ar­  
rangement, by a decisive effort, it would  
be at liberty to seize such opportunity for  
the advantage of the country. *  
These considerations, founded cn a view  
of the proposed arrangement itself, furnish­  
“d strong inducement to us to proceed to  
die other objects of the negociation. There  
were other considerations of a different cha­  
racter, which recommended it with still  
greater force. H id we refused to proceed  
&lt;n the negociation, what was the alterna­  
:i\e which niicli a refusal presented to our  
lew ? Tile negoca&#x27;ion would have been at  
•i end, alter having failed in all its objects :  
  
»or i{ tins interest whs not arranged, none  
.I&#x27;.hers could he. The attitude which the  
governments held towards each other, was  
hi a cert &lt;in degree hos ile. Injuries had  
•ecu inflicted bv one party, and resentmen­  
hewn by the other, the latter having taken  
t step .0 the case ot the non-importation  
%v, *v o i11 virnn Jniciuloil to vindicate tilt  
naldic rights and honor by being made the  
means of obtaining a redress of those inju­  
res. Tne measure was intended for the  
ministry of Mr. Pitt, from which the inju­  
res were received, hut by the removal of  
lint ministry, and the delay which took  
! 1 ice in the passage of the law, it came  
into operation against the ministry if Mr.  
Fox and lord Grenville, who would not  
h ive rendered those injuries, and against  
whom of course such, a weapon would not  
havo been raised. Notwithstanding the ex­  
istence of that law, and the attitude which  
still remained between the governments, it  
was impossible to appeal to it as a strong  
motive of action with the new ministry.—  
Such :.n appeal was sure to produce more  
h *rm than good. It would have lost us all  
claim on the generous feelings and liberal  
policy, which the n w,ministry was believ­  
ed t&lt;&gt; indulge and disposed to adopt towards  
the United States. The ncgocatlion, there­  
fore, witii the new ministry, was conduct-I  
ed by policy, as well as by inclina i n, on  
friendly St conciliatory principles. Should J  
it fail, however, in its object, and lie !&gt;ro- j  
ken oil, (he relation between tiie parties&#x27;  
would change in an instant. From that mo-!  
ment the new ministry would stand on the1&#x27;  
ground of the old one. and the nation be u-1  
nired in all its political parties against us. &#x27;  
The attitude would become in fact, what  
the exterior announced it to be, hostile, and ,  
it was difficult to perceive how it could be !  
changed, and peace he preserved, with ho­  
nor to the Umted States. They could not i  
reci dc from the ground which they had ta­  
ken, or accept, by compulsion, terms which I  
  
incy uko rejected in an amicable ncgocia- j  
lion. War, therefore, seemed to be the in- &#x27;  
evitable consequence of such a state of!  
things, nr.d I was f. r from considering it an  
alternative, which ought to be preferred to  
the arrangement wh ch was offered to us.  
When 1 took into view the prosperous and j  
nappy condition the United States, corn- }  
pared with that of other nations ; that, as  
a neutral power, they were almost the ex- &lt;  
elusive carriers of the productions of the  
whole world ; and that m commerce they  
flourished beyond example, notwithstnnd  
mg the losses which they occasionally sufl  
fetutl, I was strong it, the opinion that  
those blessings ought r.ot to be hazarded  
in such a qut-si;on. Many other considera­  
tions tended to confirm mu in that senti­  
ment. I knew that the United States weie  
not prepared for war ; that their coast was  
u*i.unified, and their cities in a great mea­  
sure defenceless : that their militia, in ma­  
ny of the states, was neither armed nor  
trained / aiul that their whole revenue was  
derived from commerce. I could not pre­  
sume that their was just cau^e to doubt  
which of the alternatives ought to he pre  
ferred. Had it, however, been practica­  
ble to terminate the negociation, without  
such an adjustment as that proposed, and  
wi h« lit taking any decisive measure in con­  
sequence of Us failure, what was to become  
of the nondmportaiion law ? If soft. red to  
remain in force, it was sure to produce war.  
Ureat Britain, it was known, would i nter  
into no arrangement, by treaty, which did  
no- provide for its repeal; and there was  
litt.e reason to prof-umc, after the rtip&#x27;ure  
&lt; f the ncgcciation, by which the re.ation be.  
  
tween the parth s would fie loss friend It&#x27;,  
that she would become mo&gt;*e accmmnoda­  
ting. It was. on -he contrary, fairly to be  
concluded, tnat if »ny arrangement what*  
ever should be practicable, it world be a  
less advantageous one than that which wt  
had sanctioned. Some disposition of it was  
therefore indispensably necessary in any  
course which might be taken. These con­  
siderations had much weight in dec ding  
that which was pursued, and I frankly own,  
that a sincere desire -to afford to the admi­  
nistration an honorable opportunity for itt  
repeal, since, under existing circuir stance s,  
it did not seem probable tliat ft coui.i he  
•finger useful, and might lie injurious, v.asa  
strong motive with me ;o ihcifr the respon­  
sibility which I took on myself in that tran­  
saction. Io the ai-rangeiK&lt;iht proposed wo  
gave our sanction. We undertook to sub­  
mit it to the consideration of our o. vein  
ment, taking care to inform tlie 1&gt;. itt&#x27;sh com­  
missioners, that we had no power to con  
|chide ,, treaty that v.-tuld be oblfrutoryoa  
tlie U. Mates, which d-d not arrange i,x  
a satisfactory manner the intci est i&gt;l im­  
pressment. Wc agreed also to pt^ce-tl in  
a discussion of the other ..Idiots „f  
negotiation, and eventually concluded a  
treaty ; it being understood, from what we.  
had frequently sMt-d, that it our govern­  
ment should disapprove the arrangement  
relative to impressment, U.c -&lt; hole wculd  
tail with with it. Thus the V. States en.  
joyed the advantage of bei.ig tit libirtv to  
accept or reject the arrange,n«„r, while  
on the British government i; „• is binding.  
VV»tli onu party u was a project, with this

Jr the most ample vindication of that of the i  
American commissioners. The government  
w-is equally willing to enter into s.mic arrnt gc­  
ment, which siiouid preserve the peace of the  
country, abb •* it should no: accomplish the ob­  
ject which had been so ardently desired. The  
only diTerence between the plan which we  
aaucthncl and that which it proposed, was  
tb..t &#x27;be vliolc arrangement shoulil be informal.  
Ha&lt;l the administration resorted to war as a  
pr fetch i« al ewarive, or been willing to leave  
the hr ioess tiuscitted, its policy atvl example  
luiglr. have hc&lt; n-plead against us; but in of­  
fering to area* t .he same coodlti me in an in­

tiif* nnn-imporUtion law as a motive to it, it  
shew. .1 that tl&#x27;.e considerations \vtii&lt; • bad been  
rc.-.pei tc* by us had mr much weight with it  
But the conduct of tie admiv&#x27;.Ktration fur­  
r-.siu s ether strung arguments in favor of the  
Rryungcment projiosed by the American com­  
missioners. By engaging to ob ;orve the infor­

prived of the rip*htof insisting &lt;&gt;n other terms,  
however favorable the opportunity f*r it might  
be, while G. Britain would ’!&gt;• at liberty to dw-l  
p .rt from such arrangement whenever the e­  
vents of war furnished her an adequate mo iv*  
f ir it. Tins was the opposite of our st range­

several of primary importance, which you con­  
ceive to hate been improperly arranged in t .*  
articles wbiv-h refer tu them I will pursue in  
toy remarks the order which you have traced

chtuttuls which were le 11 open to i&gt;, by the  
decisions of the British courts, and the prin­  
ciple- contained in the communication from

Cape of Good Hope, to eny other enemy or neu­  
tral coknict in this quarter.  
I om pursnaded that you will he satisfied, on

that article is unfounded. It is n .t the ob­  
ject of the ardcle to regulate tile, general com­  
ir.i rcc of the countries, or to coinpretim t&#x27;l-ir

prescribed by it applies to a case of c-uirover

ate contact, and it was the object of tnc article  
to adjust the controversy in that point, if we  
advert to the issue which was inavle up bet wet n  
t’ cm. as clearly defined by the orders of tti c  
Briush government, the decisions of the courts  
of admiralty under them, and the disenssi ti  
which took place between the governments on  
tin subject, we shall find that i i no view can  
the construction which yon impute to the arti­

decisions in such aiimnwr as to mat e the pe: -  
f it nianc. of new acts, sta ll too as were of a  
nature highly onerous and oppressive, ir lii­

A concise analysis of *hc several orders  
of the British government relative to the  
trad* of neu1 ral powers with enemy cnlo  
nies, will place, in a clear point of v.ew,  
the ground of die controversy between the  
partiev, and the precise object and eiToct ol  
the regulation proposed by the article: un­  
der Consideration. The first order bears  
d te on the 6A November, 1793 It direct­  
ed the British cruisers to br.ng in for law­  
ful a judication all vciseis louden witn  
goosis, the produce of any Col ny of France,  
or cirr) ng provisions or supplies for inch  
colony. That order amounted, in expres,  
terms, to :» declaration if wav against the  
neutral powers, and it was smed in that  
spirit by he British government. The p i­  
Iicy, however, whim dictated the order,  
din not last long. Events soon produced a  
change of p diev, nud with it rev .c lion, or  
to u&gt;vi the technical phraseology of the art  
minify, a relaxation of the order Tne  
2d order was of the 8th January 1/91. It  
directed the cruisers “ to bring in ail v&lt; s  
•els loaden with jpvxls, the produce of the  
french We»t India Islands, and c.omin&lt;;  
direct.y from any port of the said Islands tn  
a .y port in Europe.&quot; This order being di  
rectory, prescribed the case irt whicn non  
tr*l ve. s&quot;li engnged Jn such a trade should  
be ..viatal, and thercor confined .he r.eisnre  
to that ca*c only. No vessel tngagod in  
that trad* whicn did not come witnin the  
scope ot ih* order, could be touched  
Thus ilie effect of the order was to inhibit  
the dli&lt;» t trade of the United States, be.  
tween Mirmy colonics and Europe, in the  
prnclui ...»«» of dto,c colonies. It left the  
trade free bet We to the United Stairs and  
Kurorn, of course every other country.  
It left It fr&lt; r aim* in the direct line, between  
enemy colonics and Africa and Asia. By  
confining the restriction to Europe, the*  
  
lies were necessarily exempted from  
ts operation. The 3d order ol the 25th  
I in. 1726, directed the cruisers to “bring  
n all vessels laden with cm goes,&#x27;the pro­  
luce of any island of France, Spain or Hol­  
land, and coming directly from any port of  
Liie said islands or settlements to any port  
in Europe, not being a port of Great Bri­  
t. in, nor of the country to which such ships  
oeing in utrnl belonged.” The sole effect  
of this order was to extend to the neutral  
powers of Europe, the accommodation  
which had been yielded to the United States  
by that of 8th January, 1724. The next  
order bears date on the 24th June, 1803.  
It direc s the cruisers r.ut to seize any ves­  
sel which shall be carrying on trsdc riir.ct­  
ly bwtwecn the colonies of enemies and the  
neutral country to which the vessel belongs,  
and laden with the proper y of inhabitants  
of such neutral country ; provided such  
vessel shall not be supplying nor have sup­  
plied the enemy on t’.ie cu ward voyage  
with any articles of contraband of war, See  
The sole object. of this order appears to  
have been to.introduce a new rule r lative  
o contraband, by subjecting a vessel to  
seizure on thrt account, on her return voy­  
age, after dep siting her cargo at h .-r place  
of destination. It prohibits the seizure ol  
neutral ve-sMs, European as well as Ame­  
rican, engaged in a trade between enemy  
colonies ami the neutral countries, by pos­  
itive inhibition. That trade had been left  
free before, by the restriction of the sei­  
zure to vessels engaged in the direct trade  
between enemy colonies and the parent  
country. It w.&#x27;s now secured by p .skive  
inhibition. The right to carry on the trade  
from the neutral country toother countries,  
was left on the ground ou which it stood  
befoie. That this order was not intended  
to affect that trade, and did not affect it, is  
made sufficiently evident by many decisions  
of the courts of admiralty, which have been  
given since the order was issued. In proof  
of this 1 refer to all the cases that were de­  
cided by the Br tish courts of admiralty,  
touching the trade of neutrals with enemy  
colonies in the years 1805 and 6. and more  
especially to that of the Willi un Trefrey,  
lit being the last one and containing a sum  
mary of the whole doctrine.  
If we recur to the decisions of the courts  
themselves we shall find a full confirmati­  
on of what is here advanced. We shall  
find that in conforming their decisions to  
the spirit of the orders of the government,  
t !lp\* mliitvtl f rlit&#x27;urf’ I mvlif Ivot oon  
  
the colony anti the parent country, or some  
other country of Europe : that they do not  
call in question the trade between neutral  
powers in the productions of enemy colo­  
nies, aiter those productions were allowed  
to have been incorporated into the stock, o!  
the country: that they gave recent ami  
high offence only by the new doctrines ad­  
vanced, on this latter point, which, hy as­  
suming to investigate the motives of the  
parties engaged in the trade, and to reject  
..cts which were before deemed s-riyfuctJ­  
ry bv decisions the most solemn, and to im­  
pose new conditions the most oner -us and  
I oppressive, laid that commerce completely  
j at the mercy of British tribunals. The  
most material cases are those ofthelmma­  
! rmel, which involved the question of a trade  
between Bourdeaux and St. 1)amir.go, that  
is, the direct trade lie tween the parent  
country ami Us cilvny, In ^ niot, th, .*-• .(li  
were condemned on that account. Robin

In this case the question of continu ty ot vo).

vor oi the American claim, on ground thni  
give no &lt;df:nce. I: w »s admit.ed in expli­  
cit terms by the judge, that an Americai  
had a right to import the produce of tin  
Spanish colonies into his own country, and  
to carry them on theuce to the general com  
mcrcc of Europe, an l that the landing o  
ihe cargo and payment of the du’ie!  
would be sufficient criteria of a bona fich  
importation. 2d Rob Rep. page 361. Tin  
next cas°s were those of the iv sex, Orne  
of the Kowliena, and fome others of tin  
same kind, in 1«0i. which turned on th&lt;  
point -if continuity of voyage, in whicli tin  
court, pushing its doctrine to the unjust 8  
perniciou-i extent complained of, prot ucei  
the controversy which took place betweet  
die countries.  
Tne r. imsm ication between Mr. Kim  
and lord H iw! e-ibu y is of the same cna&quot;  
meter. The advocate-general admits it  
his report, which w &lt;s ad-pteil hy lord H -w  
kesuuvy, and communicated by him to Mi­  
King, that by the relaxation o| the genera  
ormciole resnectinor toe trade wi:h er»e&lt;n-„  
  
ct-ionies, it w.vs distinctly understood, mii  
had been rqi -&lt;i -edly so decided bv the conr  
of appeal, that tlie produce o1 enemy colo.  
nies might be imported into the neutra  
country, and reexport&#x27;d thence even t&gt;.  
the mother country of such colony ; and ir  
lihe manner that the produce and manu  
faCtUi ej of the ’uotner country might !&gt;&lt;  
carried to its colonies. He states tha; tht  
direct tr,nde between the mother cunti j  
and its colonics had not been recognised at  
legal : that whnt amounted to an in erme  
di.itc importation into the neutral country  
-.night sometimes be a question of &lt;1 flir.nl  
ty ; that the mere touching n the neutra  
country to take fresh clearances, might j»er  
haps be deemed evasive, and in effect thi  
&#x27;lit ect trade ; but that the high court of ad  
m .rally had expressly d c.ded (and he saw  
no reason to expect that the court ofappea  
would vary the rules) that landing th&lt;  
goods and paying the duties the neutra  
c dairy would break the continuity of tht  
voyage, and was such an importation a:  
would ieg:.H*c *the trade, although th«  
go&lt;xls were re shipped m the Same vessel  
on account of the same proprietors, ant  
were forwarded for s.:le to the tnothci  
Country of the c&lt; 1 my.  
This communication cor-esponds in cvr  
ry the minute: t circumstance with the spi­  
rit of the orders and decisions of the courn  
us above explained It insists, and in ternv  
that arc I .r from being positive, that tin  
di i ect trade, only between the mother roun  
try and the colony, was inhibited. It ad  
mils thnt the trade through the neutra  
country to the mother country of the colon]  
was lawful, and fixes, with great precision  
the acts to be performed in the neutra  
country, which would be sufficient tn incur  
porate the goods into the stock of thecoun  
try, and break the continuity of the voyage  
In the latter part of the report alluded to.  
the advocate general seems to make a kind  
  
of reservation of the right of ,l»e court cf  
appeal, to revise the decisions of the high  
court of admiralty, which he represents to  
have settled the doctrine. But he makes  
that reservation, if indeed it was intended  
| as one, ia such terms as to preclude the  
idea, that it would evtr be taken advantage  
of, especially when it is considered, that the  
report was adopted by the government} and  
communicated officially, by the secretary  
of state, to a foreign minister. It is ccr.  
tain, however, that through the courtof ap­  
peal, the new encroachment on the rights  
of the United Spates was made, which pro­  
duced the controversy which ensued im­  
mediately afterwards.  
The discussion which took place be­  
tween lord Muigrave and myself in  
ib05, on the subject of the seizure  
then made, treated the encroachment  
in that line as the special cause of com­  
plaint on the part of the United States.  
Although the British pretension to  
inhibit even the direct trade, had not  
been countenanced by the government,  
yet the commerce of the U. States had  
been made in a certain degree to ac­  
commodate with it by the merchants.  
They were content to decline the di­  
rect trade, and to prosecute their en­  
terprises through the U. S. equally  
with the mother country and its colo­  
nies. It was natural, in the course of  
a controversy which involved such im­  
portant interests, that the rights of the  
parties should be taken up on principle,  
and carried to the greatest extent. To  
the light thrown on the subject by a  
very able essay, which l received from  
you, I was much indebted, and I ac­  
knowledge in this communication, the  
aid which it afforded me, with peculiar  
satisfaction. A vindication, however,  
of the cause on principle, however ex­  
tensive the range might be, could not  
affect the origin of the controversy,  
nor give to the article entered into for  
its adjustment a construction different  
lrom that which, by well established  
rules, is fairly applicable to it.

of the British government, and from  
the exposition given of them by ti**  
courts, and by the government itself,  
it appears that the sole object of those  
that were issued after that cf the 6th  
Nov. 1793, was to inhibit the direct  
trade of the U. S. between enemy co­  
lonies and Europe ; that they did not  
touch, and were not intended to inter­  
fere with the trade between the United  
States and Europe, even the parent  
country, and a fortiori between the U.  
States and Asia and Africa. It was,  
indeed, the obj-ct of the order of Nov.  
6th, 1793, to suppress the commerce  
of neutral powers with enemy colonies  
altogether: but that being abandoned,  
the next idea which occurred was to  
embarrass that trade by forcing it  
through neutral countries. Here,  
then, arose a new question, which tui n­  
ed entirely on another principle. That  
■ a neutral pojver had a right to carry on  
trade from its own ports, in any arti­  
cles, though of foreign produce, which  
had been incorporated into the stock  
of the country not contraband of war,  
and to all countries, was not controver  
ted. That point, otherwise clear and  
indisputable in itself, had been long  
settled in the highest tribunals, and by  
• the most eminent jurists in England.  
» The circumstances which constituted  
. 3U.ch an incorporation of foreign arti­  
cles into the stock of the country, had  
also been settled by the same authori­  
ties. Still the q’.n stion which now a­  
1 rose, turned on th-ii latter point. In  
forcing this commerce through neutral  
port3 with a view to embarrass it, it  
he came necessary [to give the greatest  
effect to that expedient] to increase the  
difficulties in those ports, which was  
done in the manner already stated.  
If the instructions of the British go­  
v&lt; rnment did not inhibit the trade in  
  
| question, the adjustment contained in  
I the article under consideration, could  
not affect it. That article supposes a  
difference between the parties relative  
to a trade with enemy colonies, and the  
instructions which interfeVe with it.  
The article could not operate in any  
trade to which the instructions cl id not  
i extend, and concerning which there  
^ was no controversy. In the present  
case the conclusion is the more irre­  
sistible, because there did not exist c­  
ven a possibility of controversy in re­  
gard to that trade#  
Kut it is inferred, that because it i?  
stipulated, that the produce of enemy  
: colonies may be carried to Europe  
1 from the U. S. that the ports of Asin  
and Africa are shut on them, and thni  
| because it is stipulated that the mn­  
■ nufactures of Europe may be carried  
front the U. S. to the West Indies  
that ?hof.e of Asia and Africa are pro  
hibited from being carried there. Thi­  
, objection has been alreidy obviated  
Mad the instructions of Me British go  
■ vemment inhibited that trade, and ;  
. controversy between the government!  
arisen from the inhibition, as the arti  
, cle does not extend to the case, tin  
! most that could have leen in ferret  
would have been that it was unprovi  
ded for, and that the rights of the par  
ties would remain in ths same stat&lt;  
respecting it, ns if the article had no  
  
been entered Into, it is easy to explain  
the cause why the term “ Europe1&#x27; was  
introduced into th: article, in reference 1  
to the ports, to which colony produce  
might be carried, and “ European” in  
reference to the manufactures which  
might be carried to enemy colonies,  
and to shew that they were adopted  
with a view to open on the widest scale  
the ports which had been at any time  
| shut on them by the British orders.  
Although the policy of these orders,  
as well as of the principle on which  
they are founded, is more particularly  
applicable to the direct trade between  
the enemy colonics and their mother  
country, yet as the term “ Europe”  
had been adopted in the modifications  
that were made in them, first at the  
instance of the U. S. and afterwards  
at that of the neutral European powers,  
as the widest scale within which the  
inhibition operated, it was thought best  
to use that term to prevent the pos­  
sibility of mistake, as to the extent of  
the adjustment. Had terms of more  
extensive import been adopted, they  
could not have been more effectual to  
the object, while they might have ten­  
ded to enlarge the sphere of British pre­  
tension, by extending it to cases to  
which it would be highly improper to  
give a sanction.  
But it is supposed that although the orders  
of the British government may not have inhi­  
bited this tw.de it is comprised i:i the general  
inhibit i,.n of the British principle- If the Bri­  
tish principle inhibits mch a tra. Is, which Ido  
not admit, •/ docs not follow that si sanction to  
dust inhibition is given by this article for rea­  
sons nlreaday stated; It&quot; flic provr.in i of the  
article does net extend to that trade, the rights  
of the parties cannot be al’ected bv it They  
remain equally in force agaiuts the principle  
as against the instructions, had they inhibited  
it. But the claim to an exemption from that  
trade from the operation of die British princi­  
ple, rests on still stronger ground Admitting that  
it ever extended to it, winch however j am far  
from admitting. It can bo shewn that the orders  
themselves, take it completely from within the  
  
f&#x27;w »&#x27;• Si:cvw J/ V* uv iinuiu.HW^ iliC  
cru zarslo seize vessels engaged in a par

taxation of the Bii i»:h principle, is effected  
I’lie o:dei reduces ihe prirciple to its own  
tiandmd, or, in other woids, becomes the  
piir.cij le itself. If this doc.line is rot  
true it is impassible to designa e in wl-.a;  
mode ihe relaxation, which is universally  
admitted, of t&#x27;ne British principle, is  
*viought; or to prove that there has been  
any relaxationrf it whatever* if he orders  
have not that effect, of ”ha’ avail are thev :  
1 hat they have that effect is proved by  
the decisions cf the c &gt;t:rts, and the prac  
iice under them. I am anaie of the  
btoad doctrine held by the courts on this  
subject, but that doctrine, necessarily am  
higuous from tilt: dilemma in which ihe  
courts were placed by the inconsistent or  
ders ol the government, if not reconcile­  
able to this construction (as I think it is  
when ihe whole subject is taken into view)  
is contradicted by the decisions cf the  
s.une courts and the explanations of thr  
government itself.  
I ssy that this trade is net inhibited by  
the B itish principle, because it supposes  
a trade between enemy colonies and Ihe  
in ther countiy. But a trad* between the  
United Stales and Asia or Africa, let the  
►object of it be what it may, is not a Hade  
f ihat kind It is a trad-? tvith inr&#x27;epen­

w,tb whom we have a r&#x27;;ghf to trade, by  
all the rules which Ciiva-. B i’ain has at  
any time insisted on. It would be ol .lair  
gurous tendency to admit that Great B;i  
lain had a pretension to interfere with  
such a trade in a y case. After the go^ds

trine. It asserts in its widest range tin  
light only to seize th«.m on their mute u

neutral country If «|iey are they nrjy jp»  
under the arrangement made lo the c«uiu

But they require no sanction fr.,in the Bri­  
tish government, lo go lo those lo which

try on the re-exportation ofthe article**  
could nut be felt by the merchant i!  
would fall on the European consumer.  
, It could not be felt as a heavy imposition  
on the trade iiseil. Our only coinpeti  
tor in it, would be Great Britain, whi.se  
merchants would labour under the disad­  
vantages incident to war, in a thousand  
diapes, more especially as the ports of  
the whole continent would he shut on them  
m nut being able to get their goods into  
thoae pcri3, otherwise than by smuggling  
them: a mode which could not fai? to be  
onerous, if it succeeded, but which was  
likely to tail inmost cases. It should h»  
remembered also, that the enclosed du­  
ties which would accrue to the count™  
  
wou.ct tend, in she degree, to interest the  
wnole community in support of a com­  
tnerce, in which the commercial part was  
moat materially interested. It is the pol­  
icy of the Eurrpem powers having Cj- *  
lonies in the West Itul.es, to make the  
parent country the entrepot of the pro­  
ductions of its colonies. Is not that pH.  
icy worthy the attention and imitation of  
t.it- Uni eu States, in respect to the trade  
H the cHonies in question ? The duty  
received wo«i,d make some recompense to  
tlie n^ti&lt; n for the expenses incurred and  
rums expended, in supporting our right  
to that trade. Besides, by making ihe  
poi:s of the United States lhe“enlre.  
pots” for such productions, the country  
in genetal would derive some advantage  
from the measure. Every ship engaged in  
the commerce which entered an Ameii­  
can port, would bring something to, and  
take something from it. The vasi amount  
: of Asiatic, European and West India nr*  
! t.clcs brought to our markets,-would chca­  
Jper: the price of those articles at home,  
| and each ship, while in port, and in the  
prosecution of her voyage, would require  
svipptics in provision and othei articlts,  
which would raise the price of tlmse atti­  
cles, lollie great advantage of the general  
j Interest cf the country.  
The limitation of the article to the term  
specified, was a condition which we pre­  
sumed might prove advantageous to the  
United States, while it could not possibly  
injure them. It is expressly stipulated  
hut the right of both parlies shall revive  
i-t tho expiration of the term. Those of  
• he United Stairs, therefore, would then  
iv m force, and to the full extent of their  
pretensions, in (he same manner as if the  
stipulation hod not been entered in&#x27;o. In  
anci.her war they might insist on condi­  
tions which this stipulation did not secure,  
•nd, if Great Britain did not yield to their  
dt maud, they might resort to any txpedi­  
n,, toc&lt; rope! her, which the wisdom of  
their council* might dictate. Any en­  
croachment .on the part ( f Great Britain  
on the;r rights, as heretofore contended  
for, might be considered by their govern  
  
...tu. an egi or nosiiiiy, ana treated ac«  
cr.r&lt;ii.»g!y» 1 he least favorable condition*  
that she could offer would be those alrea­  
dy st tiled, which the United States might  
accept or reject, as they thought best.—.  
As a yotuhful, prosperous, and rising na«  
•inn, it could not he doubted that in the  
next W8. their nit nation would be more  
imposing than in the p*esent one. The  
pit sumption is. that they would he able  
Mien to obtain better conditions than at

lege, no the contrary whatever it mav be, must  
he founded on their consent, loiiow, and  
tcrmina&#x27;e with it.  
The 12th article stipulates that Great  
Britain snail not stop the vessels of the U.  
States within five mar tie miles of their  
const, except for the purpose of examin­  
  
• s  
ing whether they be American, or those o  
another power ; and that she shall not stop  
the unarmed vessels of other powers with­  
in the same limit, provided they acknow­  
ledge it ,*xcept to ascertain whether they  
belong to thfsc who have acknowledged it.  
Tne vessels of the powers who do not a­  
dopt the regulation are not affected bv  
it. They remain under the ordinary pro­  
tcc’-ion of the law of nations, which extends  
to the distance or cannon shot or three  
miles from the coast. Beyond that limit  
the enemies of Great Britain have a right  
to search am&#x27; seize her vessels without be­  
ing amenable to the United States, and the  
same right is reserved to her by this arti­  
cle, as ll it had not been entered into.  
Vessels cf war are expressly excluded  
from the advantage ot the regulation.  
It is the sole object of the 12th article to  
secure to the U. States au accommoda­  
tion, by extending their jurisdiction on  
their coast, in what concerns themselves,  
from three to five miles. The stipulation  
is unconditional&#x27;as to them, but condition­  
al as to other powers, dependent on their  
acknowledging the same limit. 1. is made  
reciprocal, by being extended to the Bri­  
tish dominions, northward orthc U. States,  
a circumstance which merits attention, a*  
it precludes the idea that any other vqut­  
v.lvnt was expected or intended to be gi­  
ven jor it. It would have been extended to  
the dominions of Great Britain, in Europe  
anti elsewhere, had the British commissi­  
oners desired it. They declined it, from a  
fear that it might produce some innovation  
in the general doctrine of the law of nati­  
ons on tiie subject. This is, I think, fair­  
ly to be inferred from the instrument itself.  
The last paiagrsph of the 19th auk e won,.  
!at;s that iKi&#x27;her of c «■ paries shall permit the

p &gt;*tar ce.  
Article 6. As this article wit appro­  
j v«d, 1 shall only observe, tiisi I considered  
J the reset valicii contained in it important,  
| &#x27;**s enabled the U. S. to counteract the  
| Bri i»h policy, in respect to the trade wish  
: the West Indies, wlnclt is the object of it,  
i i»v means the most efficacious, whenever  
i they should lie resorted to. &#x27;i h« trade of  
| lire»t Britain with the U. 8. is carried on  
! principal1/ by chcmlcua voyages, in w h.rh  
j her vessels pass ft um the ports of the U. S  
j to the West Indies. By suspending the: in­  
i lercourse between the U. H. and her West  
Indies, in British vtssels, the claim would  
be broken, and the whole commerce in such  
vessets be, in a great measure, suspended.  
The P’nvis’on in the article obviously looks  
to such an object, and the time of carrying  
it into effect, unless ihu trade should be pla­  
ced on satisfactory gn nnd, would have de­  
pended altogether on the U. 8  
1 laving already n&lt;v iced the subjerts which  
are embraced by the following articles, I  
, shall add but little more, i.u any of them, ^  
what is said in oar joint letter of January  
3d, 1607 The 7lh was taken literally from  
, the treaty of 1794. The 8 b and 9tb amen­  
ded, as you allow, the articles in that trea­  
ty on the same subject. The 10th, relative  
j i to blockade, taken in connection with thr  
1 I British paper of December31, 1806, placed  
. as 1 presumed, that interest i n ground whicl  
| would be satisfactory. Tito preamble can  
. not aff, c it unfavorably, as it docs not ah  
. ter the acknowledged law The only effre  
  
which it could have, would be to admonish  
the courts to be cautious in admitting evi­  
dence of notice, on account of the distance  
ot tl.-e U. S- from the blockuded ports It  
was supposed to give the U. 15. a c:aim 10  
a more favorable rule in respect to evi­  
dence, than was allowed o powers more,  
contiguous to tl.e theatre of action. The  
doctrine contained in Mr. Mtrry’s note tn  
ycu was not contested by the British com­  
missioners. It is, on tiie contrary, main­  
tained in their note to as^f Dec. 31st, 1806,  
in which it is asserted to be notorious “ th t  
the k&#x27;!i*j did not declare any ports to be in  
a state of blockade without allotting to  
that object a force sufficient to make the  
entrance into them manifestly d iiigerous.”  
I quote the passage in their note to observe  
; that the doctrine is net made conditioul on  
any other part of it, but is laid down as the  
established law. It justifies the additional  
remark that the preamble was not intend­  
ed and cannot be construed to alter the law.  
It follows that it cannot produce any other  
effect than that which is abeve&#x27;jmputed to it.  
I’lie 13th article relates to the search of  
merchant vessels, and differs from the 19th  
of the treaty of 179», in the introductory  
sentence, which erj&#x27;&#x27;i»3 it on the comman­  
ders of ships of war and privateers, to ob­  
serve in the course of the war, which may  
then exist, ns much as possible the ac­  
knowledged rules end principles of *he law  
of nations ; and also in the penal sum rwhich  
it encreases] to he given by the comman­  
ders of privateers before they receive their  
commissions, as a security for their good  
conduct under them. It was supposed that  
in this as in the preceding ca&gt;e, the law’  
remained untouched, and that the stipulati­  
on produced no other effect, th .n .a enjoin  
it on the governments respectively, to be  
particularly attentive to the Conduct of its  
officers in the respect alluded to.  
The 13lh article and the p iper of the  
British commissioners of the 31-tot D-cem­  
ber, 1806, o’ovir.usiv look, to she Uimvian  
  
convention, ns the standard of the acknow­  
ledged law i*eip*c ting ihe search of mer  
chant vessels and blockade. That instru­  
ment was held constantly in view on both  
sides, in every discussion on those sul.j c s  
and indeed on every other to which it ex  
tends, ar.d J s doctrine ad a; tied, especial­  
ly in those, to be the established l«w. VVc  
were extremely desirous, and used &#x27; urbest  
exertions, to in trod u c articles to the saint  
effect, into cur treaty, but il was Hiterly  
impossible t*&gt; accomplish it. I*- must how­  
ever be allowed that it engagements ot the  
kind alluded to, especially in regard to  
blockade, for which there was a special  
document, would not be observed, that it  
would be useless to stipulate them by treaty.  
On the subject of ttie lfth article, i  
have already n «de some remarks under a­  
notherhead. I cumin: thick that a stipula­  
tion to receive the sh.-ps of war ot each  
party, hospitably into the ports of the other,  
restrains them from limiting the number of  
ships to be admitted at one time, or from  
designating the par s to which they sha&#x27;l  
be admit .ed. * A stipulation to admit th. ni  
settles on&#x27;}-, ns I presume, the principle, i  
that they shall be admitted, and &#x27;leaves o-:  
pen to arrangement the other points connec­  
ted with it. This opinion is supported by  
it passage in the article itself, as to the &#x27;  
ports which secures to vessels which might :  
be driven by stress of weather, See. into !  
ports not . pen to them in ordinary casts,  
and h •spitable reception In such ports._  
H *d the right to designate the ports been  
given up by the general stipulation, there  
w uId have been no necessity for that con­  
tained in this pas4&gt;-*ge. The remark is e­  
qually applicable to the other case, that of  
&#x27;he number to be admitted at one time._  
As that must he an art .ir of special and  
strict regulation, an exception which ad­  
mitted more, by securing rights .o them  
in case they entered, would n-ctssurily de­  
lta the limitation itself  
Tiie stipulatipn which relates to the gord  
treatment of the officers of each p.;r v in  
the porta of the other, being reciprocal,  
contains no reflection on one, which is not  
applicable tothe other; and I will venture  
to affirm that it is equally necessary in  
regard to threat Britain as to the Ur ted  
Suit- s Iv is well known in respect to the  
1 .tier, that the panders, which were ex.  
cited by the revolution, did not long sur­  
vive the struggle; that the sword was no  
sooner sheatln-d, than ihe c ilaniitiesof the  
■war were forgotten. Tiie injured are al­  
ways the first to forgive. It is, however,  
just to remark that time has essentially et­  
  
ifUitr&#x27; i irum uic jjct jmc ui uuiu ii.iuons, in?  
hostile impression which that arduous con­  
flict pr&lt; duccd.  
The 23d article was thought to contain  
an useful stipulation by secunug to the U.  
grates the advantages in navigation and  
commerce, which Great Britain mig t af  
terwards grant to any other nation. That  
stipulation was obviously founded on the  
right of the most favored nation, and sub­  
ject of course »o the conditions incident to it.  
It amounts to this, that if Great Bniain  
should concede any accommodation to ano­  
ther power in commerce with her East or  
West India colonies, or any other part of  
her dominions, gratuitously, the United  
States would be entitled to it on the same  
terms; but if she made such accommoda.  
turn in consideration of certain equivalents  
to be given her in reitirn, that the United  
Siates would not be entitled to those advan .  
tages without paying the equivalents. The  
docirine is the same in its applic-uion to  
the United States. If they could grant any  
privileges in trade to France or Spain for  
admission into their West India colonies,  
Great Britain Would he entitled toihe same,  
provided she admit ed the U. S. into tier  
isluiids also, and not otherwise. I could  
not perceive therefore how it was possible  
thr.t the U. S. shou d be injured by the st ..  
puiation contained in this article ; while it  
was probable that they might derive some  
advan age from It. It c juld not restrain  
them from passing a navigation net to place  
• hem on an equal footing with Great Bri­  
tain, especially if it was made general 01  
nppl ed only to her and the other nati-n?  
having such acts. The right to pass such  
an act was not taken away oy any other sti­  
pu&#x27;ation in the treaty, and thete was no  
hing in this art cle &#x27;that had such a ten­  
dency. The terms “ shall continue to be  
Ion &gt;he footing of the most,.fav«-r*d nation  
Sec ” rtf;-r to the pnnciples established bj  
the pieccdmg articles and not to the exist  
ing laws or regulations of either party —  
If the Intier.was the case, it would loilow  
t that the tonnag- riut e«, t n discr minatini  
  
duties, Sec. would remain as they were.—  
) I he preceding articles were intended, h  
the point* t* which they extended, to esta  
bli-!i a standard cf tqu.dity between tf.«  
parties, to wliieii ihe i; .if* .r * &gt;■: «?«r.h,  
whether they exceeded cr ieil rhon »■,  
should be brought. It coult ru t be d« uht­  
ed tbit the British export &lt; u:v wa*. ut the  
first description, that it violated the prin­  
ciple ot die most favored nation. The  
British commissioners admitted the fact,  
and did not pretend to justify ir &lt; n ih .t  
ground. They urged in Its favor o:.dy, ti:^t  
the same duty was imposed. on txp,»i is to  
their ®*vn colonies in America, and that it  
any change was made in it, to v&lt;» fy he  
claim &lt;4 the U. 6. on the p: incjplr- &gt;f t)t&lt;r  
right f«f the most favored Ration. it Wi.ula  
be to raise it on lie goods txportc . toot, er  
counti ies, not to reuucc it or. those sent to  
the U .S. The principle, however, esia­  
ohshed by this article, being applicable t ,  
that duty, it was to be piesumed that it  
niight fairly be relied on to ol&gt; ain a modi­  
fication of it, either by reducing the uu v  
on t xpurts to the U. S. or raising it &lt; i  
those to other nations. There is imUiing in  
thi- article to restrain the U. S from ,&gt;u«. ii  
dug measures to counteract die British po  
hey with imsptct to the West Indies. I  
thi.t cbject had r.&quot;t been secured by .. *pc

ss ctzy; Which did not provitte for the interests of  
&quot;&#x27;ct * impress-ment, should have been concmded be.  
ss fore theweceipt of that letter, we should can­  
didlyss- apprizess the British comniissioners of  
the reasons why it would not be ratified, and  
invite. them to enter age-in on the business  
with a view to such a result as was desired.  
By this letter the arrangement which we  
had sanetioned, comprising the informal one  
relative to impressment, and that by treaty on  
the other topics, wasrejec&#x27;terl, and tnat in  
lien of it we were instructed to inter into an  
informal nnderStunding or arrangement of the  
whole subject, and as was to be inferred from  
the fair import of the letter, on the same con­  
ditions. tlt was the more to be presented that  
the government was willing- to accept, in the  
* _ mode which it proposed, the conditions which  
we might be able to obtain in the other, from  
the consideration, that the latter were under  
its view at the time the instructions were gi­  
ven, by the paper of the British commission­  
ers of November 8t&#x27;n, and onr letter of the  
llth, and the certainty with which it, as well  
as we, must have been itnpressed, that more  
fart-rable could not be expected. &#x27;  
in defending myself against the imputation  
of having sncriliced the rights of our seat-nen,  
I shall be permitted to derivesnpport from  
the conduct of the government itself in the  
same interest. Under that impression, I have  
to mmarkct that I consider tne conduct of the  
vernment as furnishinzz the most: ample vin ,  
dication of tlut of the American cozzttnission­  
Wegoﬀterntnentwns e&#x27;qssnuny willing to  
enter into some arrangement, which should  
preserve&#x27; the peace of the country, although it  
should not accomplish the ohject which had  
been so artlently desired. T he only diﬀerence  
between the plan which we sancttonen andthat  
which it proposed, was that the whole arrai-igc­  
ment should be infornul. Had the at minis­  
tration resorted to war as a preferable alter­  
znative, or been willing to leave the business  
unsettled; its policy and its example might  
have been plead against us; but in oﬀering  
to accept the same conditions in an informat  
mode, and to withdraw, in some form, the  
non-importation law as a motive to it. I ,  
chewed that the considerations which hadsi  
been respected by us had as much weight with  
  
:  
lt­  
  
  
... -.-*-- ....

But the conduct of: the admlnistratton lur­  
nished other strong arguments in favour ot&#x27;the  
arrangement proposed by the Aznericsian com­  
missioners. By engaging to observe the infor­  
  
ssmassl arrangement which we were instructed to  
  
enter into, as long as Great Britsictin should oh­  
serve it, it seemed as if the U. S. would be  
deptivcd ofthe right of insisting on other  
terms, however favorable the opportunity for  
it might be, while Great Britnin would he at  
liberty to depart from such arrangement  
  
fwhenever the events of war furnishncsil her an  
  
ldequitc motive forit. This was the opposite  
of our arrrangement as I have stated above, by  
which, as we presumed, she would be bound  
and we free. Certainty to our merchants was  
all important. Any fair well defined rule,  
within which they might prosecute in safety  
their enterprizes, although it might full Short  
in some respects of our just Claims, might  
perhaps be preferable to frequent collisions  
which put every thing at hazard. In any  
event it was anssobject of great importance to  
keep the peace of our country in our own  
hands, by retaining the right to resort to war  
When it suited us and then only.  
I will now proceed to the other topics,  
which are adverted to in your letter of May  
20, 1807, and on which I shall be as eoncise  
  
as possible, In your eXamination of the trea­  
  
  
-.-si  
  
ty you notice several of primary importance, 7­  
  
Yhich you conceive to have been improperly  
amngecl in the articles. which reser to them.  
  
I will pursue in my remarks the order which  
  
you have traced.  
You consider the llth article— as objec­  
tionable in having shut to our commerce  
important Channels which were left o­  
pen to it, by the decisions of the Bri­  
had oourts, and the principles contained  
in the communication from lord Hawkeshnry  
to Mr. King. In support of that opinion you  
observe, that as the article stipulsiates, that the  
!}.S. may carrythe manufactures and produc­  
uonsiy. .ol Europe, from their own ports, to any  
  
WY Of the enemies Of Great Britain,&quot; they ]  
  
are pmhibited br it from&#x27;carrying the murm­  
factmsie}; &#x27;or pmdfictissons of sithe countries beyond  
the C&#x27;ape&#x27;os Good Hope, in like manner to  
such boionies. You ooservc also thatctas the U.  
S. are authorised to caryssy from their own  
parts the productions of enemies colqnies to  
Europe, they are prohibited from csiarrying  
those productions to the southern cdast of the  
Mcdsilterranenn, or beyond the Cape _of Good  
Hope, or to any other enemy or neuu&#x27;a} colo­  
nics in this quarter.  
  
,?11 1 ,. c_si]  
  
I am persuaded that you wm ue sausuou,  
on forther consideration, that this construe­  
tion of the articlefsi is unfounded. It is not the  
object of the article to regulate the general  
commerce of the countries, or to compromlt  
their claims in any case to whichthe siregula.  
tion does not explicitly extend. The regula­  
tion prescribetl by it applies .to a case or con­  
troversy between theparties, in a point of  
  
immediate contaet, and it was the object the ss  
  
article to adjust the controversy in that point.  
  
If we advert to the issue which was made up ;  
  
between them, as clearly defined by the or­  
ders ofsi the British government, the decisions  
of the courts of admiralty under them, and  
the discussions which took place between the  
governments on the subject, we shall find  
that in no view can the construcdons which  
you impute to this article, be supported.  
The issue lately made up between the par­  
ties involved solely the question, what cir­  
cumstances, or acts, to be performed in the  
neutral country, were necessary to break the  
continuity of the voyage from the colony of  
an enemy to its parent country or some enemy  
country in Europe? This point has been set­  
tlecl, as was prssnmed, by former decisions  
of the British courts of admiralty, and expla­  
nations of the British government, in a man­  
ner which was so far satisfactory to the U. S.  
as to justisy a belief, that if those tlecistons  
and explanations had been adhered to, the ex­  
isting controversy on this subject Would not  
have arisen. But in 1805 the British conrts  
of admiralty insisted on the pershrmsi-mce of  
new acts in the U. 5. or what amounte&#x27;sil to  
  
the same thing. extended by cottstrttctton the  
doctrine of i&#x27;om er decisiont in such it man­  
ner as to make the performance of new acts,  
such too as were of a nature highly oucrous  
  
and oppt&#x27;cssive, indispensably necessary. On  
this special point the par—los were at issue, &quot;  
  
and the sole object of the articlc was to Mi­  
judt, by temporary arrangement, the contro.  
vet&#x27;sy on that point. The rights of the par­  
ties, in every other instance, not within the  
scope of the ittijtldillsslﬂlll, were to remain, of  
course, tmtoucl&#x27;ted, and, in that particular  
one, to revive, at the expirsittion of the term  
limited for the t-l-sstr&#x27;ct&#x27;tion olct the whole.  
A conciee anaiysis of the several orders  
of the Bri i-ct-ssh g wcrnmem reiatiet- to tht  
tude of neotral powers with enemy colo­  
n&#x27;tes, will place, to a clear point of view,  
the ground of the controversy between the  
parties, and the precise object and cssecmf  
the rcgoianon proposed by the article un­  
der consideration. The fire: order bears  
date on the 6zh November, 1793. It di.  
rected the Britith :,tniZers to bring in for  
lawful adjodication ?iin&#x27;SSCiS laden With  
goods the produce of any colony of France,  
or carrying any provistons or sopplies for  
such cuiony. That order amountcd, in ex.  
p&#x27;ess terms, to a declaration ofwar against  
the noon—al pchrs, and it was iswcd in  
that spirit by the British government. The  
pulsssscy. how v r, Which dictatedthe order,  
did not iaat long. Events soon productctd  
a change of psi-licy, and with it a sCVOCsl­  
  
tion, or to use the technical phraseology -  
  
of the adnitralty, a relaxatina of the or­  
der. The second order was of the Ssh  
]anuary, 17944; It direcuzd the croizezsis  
&quot; to bring to ali vessels laden with good-3,  
the produce of the French West indta isl­  
  
  
---si- _-__... ....­  
  
ends, and coming directly from any portos;  
  
the said islands to any port in Europe.&quot;  
This order being direcrory prescribett the  
case in Which neutrai vessels engaged in  
such a tradc should be seized, and thereby  
confined the seizurc to that case only. No  
vessel eng-gcd in that trade which did not  
come Within the acope of the order, could  
be touched. Thus the eﬀect of the order  
Was to inhibit the direCt tradc of the U,  
  
S between enemy colooics and Europe, in ss  
  
the productions of those colonies. Iticft­  
the tradc f!CtZ&#x27; between the U. S. and enemy  
coionies, and between the U. S and Eu­  
rope, and of course every other country.  
  
[t left it free aiso, in a direct line, between ,  
  
  
enemy colooies siaod Africa and Asia. By -  
confining the restricrion to Europe, those ?  
countries Were necessarily exempted from si?  
  
its operation. The third order of the 25th  
  
]anuary, 1798&#x27;. directed the crutzers to&#x27;  
  
&#x27;* bring in ail vessels lsitdcn with (argues,  
the produce of any island of France, Spaiu  
or Hollaod, and coming dircc=ly from aov  
port of the said tsluods or settlcments tcto&#x27;  
any part in Earope, not being a port of  
Great Britain, nor of the country to &#x27;which  
such ships, being central, bsi&#x27;longcd.&quot; The  
  
—_  
  
sole eﬀect us this order was to rXtcnd (of  
  
the ncutral poWers of Europe, the accom­  
modation which had been yielded to tht U.  
  
S, by that of 8&#x27;.h ]ansiuary, 1794_ &#x27;l&#x27;hc&#x27;  
  
out order hears date on the 24111 of ]uuc,

and the ncutrai country to which the mussel &#x27;

? ed such vessel shau not be supplyi-zg, not  
{have supplzcd the em- ny on tht: outward  
fvoyage, with any articles contrabaod of  
-war, &amp;c. The sole object of this order  
appears to have: been to introduce: a new  
rule reiativc to contrabaud, by SUbjecttﬂg  
a vessel to Jeizurc on that account, . : her  
return voyage, after depositmg her ca-rgo ,  
at her place of deatinatiou. [: prohibtts  
the scizure of neutral vcszds, European  
as well as Amcrican, engaged in : tradc  
between enemy colunics and the neutral  
countries, by positivc inhibition. That  
  
!  
:  
  
  
the trade had been left free before by the  
restrictiou of the setzure to vessels engag  
ed in the direct trade between enemy eolo  
uies and the parent country. it was now  
accused by positive inhibitiou. The right  
to carry on the trede from the neutral  
countries to Other countries, was lest on  
the ground on which it stood before. That  
this order was not intended to aﬀect that  
tra-de, and did not aﬀect it. is made seffi.  
ciensisily evident by many decisinns of the  
cout&#x27;sis of admiralty, which have been given  
since the order was issued. in proof of  
this ( refer to all the cases that were decid.  
ed by the British courts cf anmiralty,

Li. 11 i;ri  
From Mr. Monroe to the Secretary of State, dated  
Richmond, Ecbnurv 8, 1808.  
Accompanying the message of the president of the li­  
mited, States, to congress, utt the ltd March.  
Sin,  
It appears, by your letter of Mav 2fith, 1807,  
X»hich was forwarded by Mr. Purvianre to Mr. Pink­  
ney and uivselt, at London, and received on the  
l()th Julv, that you had construed several articles  
of the treaty, w filch we had signed with the British  
commissioners, on the 3lst of December, 1806&#x27;,  
in a ditferent sense fiom that in which thej&gt; were  
conceived by us. As the course we were instructed  
to pursue, by your letter nf February 3d, with re­  
gard to that treaty, which was confirmed in that  
of May -20th, was to no degree dependent on our  
construction of any of its articles, or on the poli­  
tical considerations which induced us to sign it, we  
cl-wined it unnecessary to enter into any explanation  
iu reply, either of our construction- of its articles,  
or oi the politic il considerations alluded to. We  
thought it more consistent with our duty, to look  
solely,to the object ot our instructions, and to ex­  
ert our uimost rtiorts to accomplish it—and we art­  
cd in conformity to that sentiment. The result of  
those efforts was made known, by the documents  
whi&#x27;li l had the honour td present to you, when I  
uas lately at Washington, being copies of a joint  
dispatch, which Mr. Pinkney and 1 had forwarded  
by Mr. Rose. We had flattered onrselves thut it  
might have been practicable to obtain the amend­  
ments of the treaty which the president desired, ns  
the state of affairs in Europe had herome more&#x27;fa­  
vourable to surh a result, -but in that we were dis­  
appointed. We found no difficulty in accomplish­  
ing the other object, of SPtlmg it aside, as we wvre  
instructed to do, in case the proposed amendments  
were not acceded to.  
  
At tins limp theieis no objection to sorh an ex­  
planation, that f &lt;4m aware o!t ainJ there are many  
reasons why it should he given. You will be sensible  
that, so tar as an unfavourable estimate is enter­  
tained id that transaction, it must, in the degree,  
tend to injure those who gave it the sanrtinn ol  
their names : and you will he rquallj- sensible that,  
it the I&#x27;nited 8iatrs are tn anv degree interested in  
it. at this time, it must consist in its being viewed  
in a just, rather than an unfavourable light. In  
retiring from the station whi- b I have lately held,  
this is the last aet nt piiblick and private’ duty,  
which I have to perform, in relation to it. It is to  
me, in many views, a painful duty, but still it i»  
one which it is highly incumbent on me tn execute.  
It is far from being iny desire to compromu Mr.  
Pinknev, in this letter, in the slightest circumstance  
•w-iii the management of the business which was  
entrusted to us jointly, we acted with the greatest  
harmony, and exerted our best efforts to accomplish  
the n! ji c t of our instructions. I am not aware  
that in speaking of any part of the treaty, I shall  
give it a construction in which he would’not con­  
cur ; but that presumption is founded altogether on  
■what took place between ns in-the course nt the ne­  
gotiation. To this communication he is not a par­  
ty, nor indeed does he know that such a one will  
be made. In every view, therefore, it is improper,  
and would he unjust, that he sbouid be considered  
as having any concern in rt.  
The impressment of seamen- from our merchant  
sress&#x27;ds, is a tnpick which claims a primary atten­  
tion, Irotn the order which it holds :n your letter,  
but more especially from some important considera­  
tions that are connected with it. The idea enter­  
  
xaineri i&gt;y me puuncx is, mat tiie rights of the U­  
aiteil States were abandoned by the American com*  
missioners in the late negotiation, and that their  
Stamen were left by tacit ar;|triesrence, if not by  
formal renunciation, to depend, for their safety on  
the mercy «&gt;f tiie British cruizers. I have, on the  
contrary, always believed, and still do believe, that  
the ground on which that interest was placed bv the  
paper of the British commissioners of Nov. 8,  
180f», and the explanations which accompanied it,  
was both honourable and advantageous u the U­  
nitcd States—-that it contained a concession in their  
favour, on the part of Great Britain, on the great  
principle in contestation, never before made bv a  
formal ami obligatory act of the government, which  
was highly favourable to their interest—and that it  
also imposed on her the obligation to conform her  
practice under it, til! a more complete arrangement  
should be concluded, to the just claims of the Unit­  
ed States. To place this transaction in its true  
light, and to do justice to the conduct of the Ame­  
rican commissioners, it will be necessary to enter at  
length into the subject.  
The British paper states that the king was not  
prepared to disclaim or derogate from a right ort  
which the security of the British navy might essen­  
tially depend, especially in a conjuncture when he  
was engaged :f. wars which eufoiccd the nccessitr  
of the most vigilant attention to the preservation  
and supply of bis naval force—that he had direct­  
ed bis commissioner*to give to the commissioners  
of the United States the most positive assurances  
that instructions had been given, and should be re­  
peated and enforced, to observe the greatest cauti­  
on in the impressing of British seamen, to pre­  
serve the rititens of the United States from moles­  
tation or injury, and that immediate and prompt  
nerlress should be afforded on. any representation of  
injury sustained by them. It then proposes to  
pnetpirn# the article relative to impressment, on ac­  
count of the difficulties which were experienced in  
arranging anv article on that subject, and to pro­  
ceed to conclude a treaty on the other points that  
were embraced by the negotiation. As a motive  
to-surh. postponement, and the conditions of it, it  
assures that the British commissioners were&#x27; in­  
shoe led still toentertaiir the discussion of any plan  
which c.puld be devised to secure the in terests ol  
  
•both states, without injury to the rights of either.  
Rv this paper it is evident that the rights of the  
United States were expressly to he reserved, and not  
abandoned, as has been most erroneously suppos­  
ed—that the negotiation on the subject of impress­  
ment was to he postponed lor a limited tune, ati^  
1 lor a special object only, and to he revived as soon  
[ as that object was accomplished—and, ih the inte­  
| rim, that the practice of impressment was to cot  
respond essentially with the views and interests ol  
tlie United States. It is, indeed, evident liom a  
correct view of the contents of that paper, that  
as her refusal was made applicable to a crisis ol ex­  
traordinary peril, it authorised the reasonable ex­  
pectation, if not the just claim, that even in that  
the accommodation desired, would be herealtn  
yielded.  
In our letter to you of November n, which ac­  
companied the paper under consideration, and in  
that of January 3, which was forwarded with the  
treaty, these sentiments were fully confirmed. In  
that of November Ij, we communicated one im­  
j portant fact, which lelt no doubt of the sense in  
which it was intended by the British cnimnission­  
eis, that that paper should he construed by us. In  
calling your attention to the passage which treats  
of impressment, in reterence to the practice which  
should he observed in future, we remarked that  
the terms “ high seas” were not mentioned in it,  
and add. d, that we knew the omiS&#x27;ion had been  
intentional. It was impossible that those term­  
could have been omitted intentionally, nit A our  
I noirlrdge, for any purpose other than to admit a  
construction that it was intended that impressments  
should be confined to the land. I do not mean to  
imply that it was understood between the, British  
commissioners and us, that Great Britain slioui.i  
abandon the practice of impressment on the hfg!i  
seas altogether. I mean, however, distinctly to  
  
sidie u was unnvrstoon that the practice heretofore  
pursued by her should be abandoned, and that n.  
impressment should l.e made on the high seas un  
der the obligation ot that paper, except incases ol  
an extnoidin rv nature, to which no g neral pro  
l-ihitinn against it could ha construed I&#x27;aiily to ex­  
tend. The cases to which 1 allude were described  
in our latter if November 11. They supposed  
British ship of war and a merchant vessel ot the  
United States, lying in the Tagus or some other  
port, the desertion of some ot the sailors from the  
ship of war to the meirhant vessel, and the sailing  
of the latter with such deserters onboard, they  
Being British subjects. It was admitted that no  
general prohibition against impressment could he  
construed to sanction such cases of injustice and  
baud—and to such cases it was understood that the  
practice should in future be confined.  
It is a just claim on our part that the explanations  
1 &quot; I&#x27;irh weregu en of that paper by the British romn.h­  
[ sinners when they presented it to us, and atterwurds  
while the negotiations was depending, which we  
communicated to you in due order of time, should  
be taken into view, in a fair estimate of nor condurt  
in that transaction. As the arrangement which  
they proposed was of an informal nature resting on  
an understanding between the parties in a certain  
degree confidential, it could not otherwise than hap­  
pen that such explanations would he given us in the  
course of the business, ol the view of their govern­  
ment in regard to it. And if an arrangement by in­  
formal understanding is admissible in any case&quot; be­  
tween nations, it was our duty to receive those ex­  
planations, to give them the weight to which they  
  
[ were justly enuutfi, ana tiv communicate them to  
sou, with our impression of the extent of the obli­  
gation, which they imposed. It is in that mode  
only that what is railed an informal understanding  
between nations ran be entered into. It presumes  
j a want of precision in the written documents con­  
nected with it, which is supplied by mutual explana­  
tions and confidence. Redure the ti*ans iction Vo  
form, and it becomes a treaty. That an informal  
understanding was an admissible mode of arranging  
the interest with Greut-Britain is made sullicn ntly  
evident by your letter of February 3d, 180?, in re­  
ply to ours of November II, of the preceding year,  
j Without reiving, however, on the explanations  
j that were given by the British commissioners oi  
the import of that paper, or of the course which  
their government intended to pursue under it, it is  
fair to remark on the paper itself, that as by it the  
rights of the parties were reserved, and the negoti­  
ation might be continued on this particular topick ;  
after a treaty should he fsrrined on the others, Grcat­  
HriUm was bound not to trespass on those rights  
while that negotiation was depending, nnd in case  
&#x27;In* did trespass on them, in any the slightest degree,  
the United States would be justifiable in breaking  
off the negotiation and appealing to force in vindi­  
cation of their right. The mere circumstance-of  
er.teitaining an amicable negotiation by «ne party  
for the adjustment of a controversy, where no right  
had been acknowledged in it by the other, gives to  
the latter a just claim to such a forbearance on the  
part of the former. But the entertainment of a  
negotiation for the express purpose of securing in­  
terests sanctioned by acknowledged rights, makes  
such claim irresistible.—We were, therefore, de­  
cidedly of opinion, that the paper of the British  
commissioners placed the interest of impressment  
upon ground which it was both safe and honoura­  
ble for the United States to admit; that in short it  
gave their government the command of the subject  
lor every necessary and useful purpose.  
Attached to the treaty it was the basis or condi­  
tion, on which the treaty rested. Strong in its  
character in their favour nii the great question «yf  
nght, and admitting a favourable construction on  
others; it placed them on more elevated ground in  
1 hose respects than they had held before; and by*  
keeping the negotiation open to obtain a more com*  
, plete adjustment, the administration was armed  
  
“with the most effectual means of securing it. By  
this arrangement the government possessed a pow­  
er to coerce without being compelled to assume the  
character belonging to coercion, and it was able to  
give effect to that power without violating the rela­  
tions of amity between the countries, ‘i&#x27;he right  
to break olt the negotiation and to appeal to force,  
could never be lost sight of in any discussion on the  
subject; while there was no obligation to make  
that till necessity compelled • it. If Greut-Britain  
conformed her prartire to the rule prescribed by the  
paper ol Novembei 8, and the explanations which  
icconipanied it, our government might rest ort that  
ground with advantage, but if she departed from  
that rule, and a favourable opportunity offered for  
the accomplishment of a&#x27; more complete and satis­  
factory arrangement, by a derisive effort, it would  
be at liberty to setae such opportunity for rhe ad­  
vantage of the country, t„  
These considerations, founded on n vi*w of the  
proposed&#x27; arrangement itself, furnished strong in*1  
ducmient to U3 to proceed to the other objects of  
fbe negotiation. There were other consideration*  
oi a different character, which recommended itwith  
still greater force. Had «e refused to proceed in  
tlie negotiation, what was the alternative which  
such a refusal presented to our view ? The negotia- -  
turn would have been at an end, after having failed  
in all its objects; for if this interest was not ar^  
ranged, none others could be. The attitude which  
the governments held towards each ollict, was in a  
certain degree hostile. Injuries had been inflicted  
by one party, and resentment shewn by the other,  
the latter having taken a step in the case df the  
non-importation law, which was intended td vindi­  
cate the puolu-k rights and honour, by being made  
the means of obtaining a redress of those injuries.  
I lie measure was intended for the ministry of Mr.  
1*111, from which the injuries were received, but  
  
»y me removal of that ministry, and the dfilay  
which took place in the passage of the law, it came  
into operation against the ministry of Mr. Fox and  
loro Grenville, who would not have rendered those  
injuries, and aga usl whom of course stJMi a wea­  
pon would not hove been raised. Notwithstanding  
th existence of the law, and the attitude which still  
remained between the et&gt;vein;tient9, it was impossi­  
ble to appeal to it as a strong motive of action with  
the ne% ministry. Such an appeal was surf? to  
produce more harm than good. It would have lost  
us all claim on the geuerous feelings and liberal  
policy, winch the new ministry was believed to in­  
dulge and disposed to adopt towards the United  
States. The negotiation, therefore, with the new  
ministry, was conducted by policy, as well as by in­  
clination, on friendly and conciliatory principles_  
Should it tail, however, in its object, and be bro­  
ken oft, the relation la-tween the parties- would  
ch.mge in an instant. From that moment the new  
ministry would stand on the ground of the old one,  
and ti e nation be united in all its political parties  
against us. The attitude would heroine in fact,  
what the exterior announced it to be, hostile, and  
it was difficult to perceive how it could be changed,  
and peace be preserved, with honour to the United  
Stales. They rould not recede from the ground  
, which they had taken, or accept, by compulsion,  
terms which they had rejected in an amicable negn­  
j tialinn,&#x27; war, therefore, seemed- to be the inevita­  
! hie consequence of such a state of things, and I was  
far from considering it an alternative, which ought  
to be preferred to the arrangement which Was offer­  
ed to us. When I took into view the prosperous  
and happy condition of the United States, coiworr­  
  
ed with that of other nations; that, as a neutral  
power, they were almost the exclusive carriers of  
the productions of the whole world; and that in  
commerce they Houiished beyond example, not with­  
standing the losses which they occasionally suffer­  
ed-, I was strung in the opinion that those blessings  
ought not to he hazarded in surh a question-. Ma­  
ny other considerations te&#x27;nded to confirm me in that  
sentiment. 1 knew that&#x27; the United States were  
not prepared for war; that their roast was unforti­  
fied, and their cities in agreat measure defenceless:  
that their militia, in many of the states were neither  
armed-nor trained ; and that their whole revenue was  
derived from commerce. I could not presume that  
there was just cause to doubt which of &quot;the alterna­  
tives ought to he preferred. Had it, however, been  
1 practicable to terminate the negotiation, without  
such an adjustment as that proposed, and without  
taking any decisive measure in consequence of its  
failure, what was to become of the non-importa­  
tion Jaw ? ft suffered to remain in force, it was sure  
to produce war. Great-dlritain, it was known,  
j would enter into no arrangement, hy treaty, which  
did m»t provide for its repeal, and there vras little  
reason to presume, after the rupture ot the negotia­  
tion, by which the relations between the parties  
would be less friendly, that she would become more  
accommodating. It was on the contrary, fairly  
to he concluded, that if any arrangement whatever  
should be practicable, it would he a less advanta­  
geous dne than that which we had sanctioned.—  
Smite&#x27;disposition of it was therefore indispensably  
necessary, m any course which might be taken.  
These considcratione trad much weight in decid­  
ing that which was pursued and I frankly own, that  
a sincere desire to afford to the administration an  
honourable opportunity for its repeal, since under  
existing circumstances, it did not seem probable  
that it could lie longer useful and might be injuri­  
ous, was a strong motive with me to incur the re­  
sponsibility which I look on mvself in that transac­  
tion. &#x27;fo the arrangement proposed we gave 0m  
sanction.&#x27; We undertook tn submit it to the consf  
deration of our government, taking cate to inform  
the British commissioners, that we had no power  
to conclude a treaty that would he obligatory on the  
United States, wliwH&#x27;dld not arrange ift a satisfapto­  
; ry manner the interest «fitti£r**tMnt. agreed  
  
also to proceed in a discussion of the other object*  
of the negotiation, and eventually concluded a- trea*­  
ty; it being understood, from what we had- fr**‘  
qoently stated, that if our government should di*»  
approve the arrangement relative to impressment^?  
the whole would lull with it&#x27;.- Thus (he U. State#1&#x27;  
enjoyed the advantage of being at liberty to accept!  
or reject the arrangement, while on the British gij*#&#x27;  
vermnent it was binding. With one pasty it WM W

There was in truth nothing unhCHSoMuble Ih thi$  
rircumstawe, as the British commissioners acted iift  
presence of the cabinet, consulted and toofc its m*?  
structinn on every point, while our distance front  
our government rendered such a recurrence to it im^  
possible. This advantage however-proceeded&#x27;froif*-&#x27;1  
the nature of the transaction : it was not the MFerlf  
of finesse on our part. We advanced in the nego-f ,  
tiation, and concluded a treuiy in a firm belief, that?  
although it fell short of what we had expected t«s*  
obtain-, it was nevertheless in the then state of af- *  
fairs, such a one a* the United Suites might adrtptf  
wi|| credit and advantage.- I have no doubt that  
the British ronmiissinm-re entertained stvll gTeateiU  
confidence in such a icsuh.&#x27; The circumstance nP  
our finally agreeing to sanction the arrangement  
ther than break off the negotiation, at which- iseueT  
we had frequently stood, in the progress of it, w&#x27;fc*  
calfcnlated to make that impression.- But it&#x27; #a&lt;*  
much strengthened by a&#x27;fcnowledge, that the whole?

portunity to make due provision for the case; and  
finally, that if a treaty, winch did not&#x27; provide forT  
the interests of impressment, should have been con* •

candidly apprize the British commissioners of th#  
reasons why it would not be ratified, and itiviter  
them to enter again on the business with • view td&gt;  
such a result as was desired.  
&#x27; By this letter the arrangement which we haA  
sanctioned, comprising the informal one relative td  
impressment, and that by treaty on-the other to*  
  
picks, was ri jcripfi, and in lieu m it we were m*  
st rue ted to enter into air intormal understanding &#x27;Hr  
arrangement of the vrhule subject, and as was to be  
inferred troin- the fair import of the letter, on the  
same conditions/ It was the more to be presumed  
that the government was willing to Hccept, in thb  
inode which it proposed, the conditions which we  
might he able to obtain-rn tile other, from the con­  
sideration, that the latter were und^r its view at  
the time the instructions were given, by the paper  
of the British commissioners of November 8lh, and  
our letter of the 11th, atfe the rertainty with which  
it, as well as we, must have been impressed, that­  
more favourable could not Hr expected.  
In defending myself against the imputation of hal­  
ving saciificed the rights of our seamen, l shall b*  
permitted to derive support from the conduct ol the  
government itself in the same interest. Under that  
impression, I have to- remark, that I consider the  
conduct of the government as .furnishing the most  
ample Vindication of Out of the American commis­  
sioners. The government was .equally willing to en­  
ter into soma arrangement, which should preserve tha  
peace of the country, although it should not ac­  
complish the object which had “been so ardently de­  
sired. The only difference between the plan which  
we Sanctioned and that which it proposed, wag  
that the whole arrangement should be informal,—~  
Had the administration resorted to war as a prefer­  
able alternative, or been willing to leave the busi­  
ness unsettled, its policy aud example might have  
been plead against bs ; hut in offering to accept tha  
same conditions in an informal mode and to with­  
draw, in some I&#x27;m nr, the non-importation law as »  
motive nr*it, it shewed that the consideration*  
w hveh had been respected by us had as much weight  
with it,4 ,, - ’  
■&#x27; But the (conduct of the administration Amrisheb  
o^her strong arguments in favour of the arrangement -

ed role, within which..they might prosecute in safe­  
ty their enterprises, although it might fall short in  
•wme retpagu ef our just claims, might perhaps l&gt;e  
preferable to frequent collisions which put every  
thing at hazard. In any event it wes an object of  
great importance to keep the peace of the country  
in oor own hands, by retaining the right to resort  
to war when it suited ns and tbpp only.  
I will now proceed to the other topics, which are  
•dverled to in your letter of May 20, 1807, and on  
which I shall ha as concise as possible, lit your ex­  
amination of the treaty you notice several of pri­  
mary importance, which you conceive to have been  
•&#x27;npr.aperly arranged in the articles, which reicr to  
ttie.m. I will pursue in my remarks the order whicli  
yaw Irave traced.  
- You consider the 11th article ns objectionable in  
having shut to our commerce important channels  
which were left open to if, by the derisions of the  
British courts, and the principles contained in the  
communication from lord Ilawkesbury to Mr. King.  
I* support of that opinion you observe, that as the  
articl* stipulates, that the U iled States may carry  
the manufactures and productions yf Europe, from  
their own ports, to any colony of the enemies of  
Great Britain, they are prohibited by it from car  
tytug the manufactures or productions of the coun*  
tries beyond the C.ipe of Good Hope, in like man­  
star, (o such colonics. ‘Yon observed also that as  
the United States are authorised to carry from their  
•yrn ports the productions of enemy colonies to  
IJurope, fhey are prohibited from carrying those  
productions to the southern coast of the Mediter­  
ranean, or beyond the Cape of Good Hope, or U&gt;  
any other enemy or neutral colouies in this quarter.  
. I am persuaded that you will be satisfied, on fur­  
ther consideration, that this construction of that  
article is unfounded. It is not the object of the gr­  
ticla to regulate the general commerce of the coun­  
tries* «r to compromit their claims in any case to  
which the regulation does not explicitly extend._  
The regulation prescribed by it applies to a case or  
controversy between the parties, in a point of im­  
mediate contact, and it was the ohject of the arti­  
cle to adjust the controversy in that point: If we  
•dvjtrt to the issue which was made up between  
  
Miera, as cieariy aeiinen t&gt;y tne orders ol the British  
government, the decisions of the courts of admi­  
ralty under them, nod the discussions which took  
place between the governments on the subject, we  
shall find that in no view can the constructions  
Mtbich yap impute to this article, he supported.  
* The issue lately made up between the parties in­  
volved solely the question, wbat circumstances, or  
•Ots to be performed in the neutral country, were  
necessary to break the continuity of a voyage from  
the colony of an enemy to its parent country or some  
epemy country in Europe t This point has been set­  
tled, as was presumed, by former decisions of the  
- British courts of admiralty, and explanations of the  
British government, in a manner which was so far  
^tisfactory to the United States as to justify a be­  
lief, that if the decisions and explanations had been  
adhered tn, the existing controversy on this sub­  
ject would not have arisen. But in 1805 the Bri­  
tish courts of admiralty insisted on the performance  
«f. new acts in the United Slates, or what amounted  
to the same thing, extended by construction the  
doctrine of former decisions in such manner as to  
malp Hie performance of new acts, su-h too as were  
of. a nature highly ogerous and oppressive, indis­  
pensably neccssaiy. On this special point the par­  
ties were at issue, and the sole object of the article  
was to adjust, by temporary arrangement, the cou­  
troveisy on that point. The rights or the parties,  
in every other instance, not within the scope of the  
adjustment, wemto remain, of course, untouched,  
and, in that particuU- one, to revive at the expira­  
tion of the term limited for the duration of the ar­  
ticle.  
&#x27; A concise analysis of tlia several orders ot the  
British government relative to the trade of neutral  
pnwersjiiiilH enemy colonies, will place, in a rleur  
point of view, the ground of the controversy be­  
tween the pin tics, and the precise object and effect  
of the regulation proposed by the article under con­  
»ideration. The first order bears date on the 6‘th  
Nov. 1793. It directed the British cruiser* to  
bring in for lawful adjudication all vessels laden with  
gooijs, the produce of any colony of France, or car­  
rying provisions or supplies for such colony. That  
order amounted, in express terms, to a declaration  
of war against the neutral powers, and it was issu &#x27;  
edin that spirit by the British government. The  
policy, however, which dictated the order, did  
  
O.u I.i»i lung. r-venis soon produced a change ol&#x27;  
policy, and with it a revocation, or, to use the tech­  
nicle phraseology of the admiralty, a relaxation 0|  
the order. The,seeond order was ol the StliJau. 170J.  
It directed the cruizers “ to bring in all vessels la­  
den with goods, the produce of the French West  
India islands, and coining directly from any port of  
the said islands to any port in Europe.” This order  
being directory prescribed the case in which neutral  
vessels engaged iifsucli a trade should he seized, and  
thereby confined the seizure to that case only ’ K„  
vessel engaged in that trade which did not&#x27;eomo  
Within the scope of the order, could be touched —  
Thus the effect of the order was to inhibit the di­  
rect trade of the,United Stales, between enemy co­  
lonies and Europe, in the productions of those colo­  
nies. It left the trade free tjrtween the United  
States and enemy colonies, and between the United  
States and Europe, and ol course every other coun­  
try. It Uft it (tee also, id a direct hue, between e­  
nemy colonies and Africa and Asia. By confining  
the restriction, to Europe, those countries were ne­  
cessarily exempted from its operation. The third  
order of the 25th January, 17*18, directed the cruiz­  
ers to ‘ bring in all vessels laden with enrgoes the  
produce ol ony island of France, Spain, or Holland,

which such ships, being neutral, belonged.&quot; The  
pole effect of this order was to extend urthe neutral  
jjowers of Europe, the accommodation which had  
been yielded to the United Slates by that of 8th Ja­  
nuary, 179-1. 1 he next order bears data on the 24th  
June 18C3. It directs the cruizersnot to seize any  
vessels which shall be carrying on trafie directly be­  
|w«tji tfie colonies of enemies and the neutral coun­  
try to which the vessel belongs, and laden with the  
^property of inhabitants of such neutral country ;

on. it prohibits the leisure of neutral vessels, Eu­  
ropean as well as American, engaged in a trade be­  
tween enemy colonies and tbe neutral countries, by  
positive inhibition. That the trade had been lelt  
iree before by restriction of the seizure to vessels  
ctigageo in tbe direrl trade between enemy colonies  
ami the parent country. It was now secured by po­  
iitive inhibition. The right to carry on the trade  
Irom the neutral countries to other countries, was  
left on the ground on which itstood before. That this  
order was not lntenflrd to affect that trade, and did  
not affect it, is made sufficiently evident by many  
derisions ot the, courts of admiralty, which have  
been given since tiie order was issued. In proof of  
this 1 relei lo nil the rases that were decided by the  
British courts ol admiralty, touching the trade ol  
neutrals w ith t unny colonies in the years 1805 and  
6, and more especially to that of the William Tre­  
trey, it being the last out* and containing a summary  
of the whole doctrine.  
Il we recur to the decisions of the courts them­  
selves, we shall liud a lull confirmation ol wbat is  
here advanced. We shall find that in conforming  
their decisions to the spirit of the orders of the go­  
vernment, they inhibit tbe direct trade only between  
the colony and the parent country ol Europe ; that  
they do uot call in question the trade between neu­  
tral powers in the productions of enemy colonies,  
alter those productions were allowed to have been  
incorporated into the stock of the country : that  
they gave recent and high offence only by the new  
doctrines advanced, on this latter point, which, by  
assuming to investigate the motives of the parties  
eugaged in the trade, and to reject arts which  
were betnre deemed satisfactory by decisions the  
most solemn, and to impose new conditions the  
most onerous and oppressive, laid that commerce  
• ompleiely at the mercy of the British tribunals.—  
1 be most material rases are those of the Immanu­  
el, which involved the question of a trade between  
Bordeaux and St. Domingo, that is, the direct  
trade between tbe parent couutry and its colony ;  
  
in wnicn me goods were condemned on that ac­  
rnunt. Rubin, Rep. 2d vol. page 186&#x27;.—And of the  
Polly, Lasky, in which the vessel was taken on a  
voyage Ironi Marblehead to Spain, charged with  
the productions of the Havanna, brought to Mar­  
blehead by the same vessel. In this case the ques- &lt;  
tionof continuity of voyage was not involved, and  
the court decided in favour of the American claim,  
onground that gave no offence. It wasadmitttd  
in explicit terms by the judge, that an American  
bad a right to import the produce of the Spanish  
colonies into his own country, and to carry them on  
thence to the general commerce of Europe, and that  
the landing of the cargo aud the payment of the du­  
ties would be sufficient criteria of bona fide importa­  
tion. 2d Rob. Rep. page 36l. The next cases  
were those of the Essex, Orne, of the Ilowhcna,  
and some others of the same kind, iu 1805, which  
turned on the point of the continuity of voyage, in  
which the court, pushing its doctrine to the unjust  
and-pernicious extent complained of, produced the  
controversy which look place, between the coun­  
tries.  
The communication between Mr. King and Ix&gt;rd  
Hawkesbury is of the same character. The advo­  
cate general, admits in his report, which was adopt­  
ed by Lord Hawkesbury, and communicated by him  
to Mr. King, that by the relaxation of the general  
principle respecting the trade with enemy colonics,  
it was distinctly understood, and had been repeat­  
edly so derided by the court of appeal, that the pro­  
duce of enemy colonies might be imported into the  
neutral country, and re-exported thence even to the  
mother country of such colony ; and in like manner  
that the produce and manufactures of the mother  
epuntry might be carried to its colonies. He states  
that the direct trade between the mother country  
and its colonies had not been recognized as legal;  
that what amounted to an intermediate importation  
into the neutral country, might sometimes be a  
question of difficulty ; that the mere touching in the  
neutral country to take fresh clearances, might per­  
haps be deemed evasive, and in effect the direct  
trude; but that the high court of admiralty had ex­  
pressly derided (and he saw no reason to expect  
that the court of appeal would vary the rules) that  
landing the goods and paying the duties in the neu-1  
trnl country would break the continuity of the voy- I  
age, and was such an importation as would legalize  
the trade, although the goods were re-shipped in the  
same vessel, on account of the same proprietors,  
and were forwarded for sale to the mother country  
of.the colony.  
  
1 but communication corresponds in every the mi­  
iiulust circumstance with the spirit of the orders  
and the decisions of the rourts as alove explained.  
It insists, und in terms that are far from being po­  
sitive, that the direct trade only between the. mother  
country and the colony, was inhibited. It admits  
that the trade through the neutral country to the  
mother country of the colony was lawful, and fixes,  
with great precision, the acts to be performed in  
the neutral country, which would be sufficient to in­  
corporate the goods into the stock of the country  
and break the continuity of the voyage. In the lat­  
ter pan of the report alluded to, the advocate-gene­  
ral seems to make a kind of reservation of the right  
of the court of appeals, to revise the decisions of  
the high court ol admiralty, which he represents  
to have settled the doctrine. But he makes that re­  
servation, if indeed it was intended as one, in such  
terms, as to preclude the idea, that it would even be  
taken advantage of, especially when it is consider­  
ed, that tjie report was adopted by the government^  
and communicated officially, by the secretary of  
state, to a foreign minister. It is certain, however,  
that through the court of appeal, the new encroach­  
ment on the rights of the United States was made,  
.which produced the controversy which ensued im­  
mediately afterwards.  
The discussion which took place between lord Mulrrave  
end myself in ISOa, on the subject of the seizures then  
made, treated the encroachment iu thaf line as the special  
cause of complaint on the part of the United States. Al­  
though the British pretention to inhibit even tho direct  
trade, had uvt been countenanced by the government, vet  
the commerce of the United States had be&gt; n made, in a cer*  
tarn degree, to accommodate with it by the merchants —  
They were content to decline the direct-trade, and to prose­  
cute their enterprise* through the United States, equally  
witKthe mother country and ha colotuet. It was natural  
■o the course of a controversy which involved euch import­  
•nt interests, that the rights of the parties should be taken  
upon principle, and carried to the greatdlt eitent. To the  
tight thrown on the subject by a very able essay, which 1 re­  
ceived from you, 1 was much indebted, and 1 acknowledge,  
to Hut communication, the aid which it afforded me, wS  
’ &amp; ~  
  
tm principle, however extensive the ran*e might be, could  
Rot affect the origin of the controversy, Tior give to the arti­  
cle entered into for At adjustment a construction different:  
horn that which, by well established rules, is lairly applicable  
to it. V  
From this view of the several orders of the Briti»h govern­  
ment, and frr.m the exposition grvefi of them by the counts,  
*&#x27;«! by- the government itself it appears that the sole  
object «t those that were issued after that of the 6th Novem­  
ber, 1793, was to inhibit the direct trade of the United  
States between enemy colonies and Europe ; that they did  
ikk touch and were not intended &lt;n interfile with the trade  
between the United Stairs arid Europe, even the parent  
country, and a fortiori between the United States and Asia  
and Africa. It was, indeed, the object of the ordi*r of No­  
vember 6th, 1793* to suppress the commerce of neutral pow­  
ers with enemy colonies altogether; but that being aban­  
doned, the next idea which occurred, was to embarrass that  
trade by forcing it through neutral countries Here, then,  
arose anew question, which turned entirely on another prin­  
ciple. That a neutral power had a right to carry on trade  
from its own ports, in any articles, though of foreign produce,  
which had been incorporated into the stock of the country  
not contraband of war, and to all countries, was not &lt; &lt;&gt;nt&gt;o­  
verted That point, otherwise clear and indisputable in  
itself, had been long settled in the highest tribunals, He by tlie  
most eminent jurists in England. This circumstances which  
c&lt;j|pstituted such an incorporation of foreign articles into the  
stock of the country, had also been sott ed by the same au­  
Inonties. Still thv question which now arose, turned on  
this latter point. In forcing this commerce through neutral  
ports with a view to embarrass it, it became necessary (to  
give the greatest effect to that expedient) to increase the dif­  
ficulties in those ports, which was done in the manner al­  
ready stated  
If the instructions of the British government did not inhi­  
bit the trade in question, the adjuftment contained in the ar­  
ticle under consideration, could not affect it. That article  
supposes a difference between the patties relative to a trade  
With enemy colonies, and the instruction which interfere with  
|t. The article could net operate in any trade to which the  
instructions did not extend, and concerning which there  
was no controversy. In the present case the conclusion is  
™ore ifresistible, because there did not exist even a pcs­  
s.bility °f controversy in regard to that trade.  
But it is info red, that because it is stipulated, that the  
produce of enemy colonics may be carried to Europe from  
the United States, that the ports of Asia and Africa arc shut  
on them,^ and that because it is stipulated that the manufac­  
tures of Europe may be carried from the United States to the  
West Indies, that those of Asia and Africa arc prohibited  
from being carried there. This objection has been aheady  
. viated. Had the instructions of the British government  
inhibited that trade, and a controversy between the govern­  
ments arisen from the inhibition, as the article does not cx­  
tovid to the case, the most that could have been inferred would  
n VC ^cfn that it was unprovided for, and that the rights of  
the parties would remain in the same state respecting it, as  
if the article had not been entered into. It is easy to ox­  
plain the cause why the term “Europe&quot; was introduced in­  
to the article, in reference to the ports, to which colony  
produce might be carried, and “ European&quot; in reference to  
the manufactures which might be carried to cnctny colonies,  
and to shew that they were adopted with a view to open on  
the widest scale the ports which had been any time shut on  
them by the British orders. Although the policy of these  
  
.iaerf, as v. .*11 as of the principle on which they are founded,  
is more particularly applicable to tire d.rect trade between e­  
trenijr colonies and their mother country, yet as the term  
Europe” had been adopted in the modifications that were  
made in them, first at the instance of the United States, and  
afterwards at that of the neutral European powers, as the  
widest scale within which the inhibition operated, it was  
thought best to use that term to prevent the possibility of  
mistake, as to theextent of the adjustment Had terms of  
more extensive inn,ort been ado,ted, they could not have  
been more effectual to the olvect, while thev might have  
tended toenlarge the soiv-rc of Rrit&#x27;oh pretension, by ex  
tending it to cases to which it would be highly improper to  
give a sanction.  
Bruit is supposed that a though the orders of the British  
government may not have inhibited this trade, it is comprrs­  
ed m the general inhibition of the British principle If the  
Brili .h principle inhibits such a trade, which l do not admit,  
it does not fdlow that a sanction to til. t inhibition is given  
bythisait.de, for reasor s already stated. If the provision  
of the article does not extend to that trade, the rights of the  
parties cannot be effected by it. They remain equally in  
force agarrnt the principle, as against the instructions, had  
they inhibited .t. But the ciaim to an exemption fiotn tltat  
trade from the operation of the British principle, rests on  
still stronger ground, admitting that it ever extended toil,  
which however 1 am far front admitting. It can te shewn  
that the orders themselves, take it completely from within  
tile scope of that principle By instructing the cruizers to  
seize vessels engaged in a particular trade, every other trade  
•sallowed. It is in that mode, that what is called a relaxa  
tion of the British principle, is effected. The order reduces  
the principle to its own standard, or, in otherwords, becomes  
the principle itself. If this doctrine is not true it is impos­  
sible to designate in what mode the relaxation, wirith isun -  
versally admitted,of the British princ. pie is wrought: orto  
prove that there has been any relaxation of it whatever It  
the orders have not that effect, of what avail are they ? That  
they have that effect is proved by the decision.-, of the courts,  
and the practice under them. 1 am aware of the broad doc­  
trine held by the courts on the subject, but that doctrine  
necessarily ambiguous Horn the dilemma in which the courts  
were placed by the inconsistent orders of the government if  
not r.&#x27;concileable to this construction (as 1 think it is, when  
the whole subject is taken into view) is contradicted by tin­  
decisions of the same cuuits and the explanations of the go  
vernment itself.  
  
* 111,11 imsuaueu not inntDitefl by the British princi­  
pie because it supposes a trade between enem/cul.,nU s ami  
themothercountry. But a trade between the United State­  
and Asia and Africa, let the subject of it be what it may is  
not a trade of that kind It is a trade with the independent  
poweisat peace with Great Britain, with whom we have a  
riyht to trade, by all the rules which Great Britain has at a­  
ny time insisted on. It would be of dangerous tendency t&gt;,  
admit that Great Britain had a pretension to interfere with  
such a trade in any case. Alter the goods are received huo  
the United States, 10 matter of what articles they consist nr  
from what quarter they came, they are the property of the  
country, and may of right be shipped to any other country.  
The Biiti-h principle dues not controvert tins doctrine. It  
asserts in its w.dest range the right only to seize them on their”  
route to the neutral country, and from it to the mother coun.  
try of the colony, 01 some other enemy country of Europe  
provided they be not incorporated into the stock of the neu­  
tral country. If they aie, they may go under the arrange­  
mentmade to the countries to which the Biitish principle  
applies. But they require no sanction from the British go­  
veri.maut, to go to those to whicii it does not apply. The  
destination of the vessel alone would, as 1 presume, dispel  
every doubt of the legality of the truth-, and preclude a I fur­  
ther inquiry concerning it. The question of continuity of  
voyage could never arise in such a case. It is certain that  
the arrangement alluded togiv.s no sanction to it, and foi  
the best of all reasons, that the trade was not admitted or  
even contended to be comprised within the range of Bri  
tish principle.  
(shall close my remarks on this point by observing, that.as  
the arrangement of the acts to break the continuity of the  
voyage from theUnited Slates to the parent country, and o­  
thcr enemy couutriesnf Europe, in the produce of their colo­  
nics, and from the United States to those colonies, in the  
&#x27;manufactures of Europe, is confined strictly to that object  
the rights of the parties remain unimpaired in every other  
circumstance relative to that {jade; that as the article con­  
contains no stipulation against the direct trade from the colo­  
ny to the parent country, the right to carry on even that  
trade is not necessarily suspended by it; that if in any view  
it can be considered as suspended it is by implication arising  
out of the whole transaction, rather than from the stipulati­  
on itself. How much stronger then is the conclusion already  
drawn from other premises, that nothing is to be deduced  
from that article to justify the construction which has been  
imputed to it.

ct&#x27;ctFroﬂm this Vlcw os the several ordere- ol­  
the British government, and from the ex.  
position given of them by ihe court-s, and  
by the government itself, it appears that  
the sole object of those that were issued  
after that of the 6 [1 November, 1793, was  
to iohibit the direct trade- of the Untted  
States between enemies colonies and Eu­  
&#x27; rope ; that they did not touch, and were  
not intended to i-nterfere With the trade  
between the United Stafes and Europe e.  
ven in the parent country, and afortiori  
between the Utsitcd State: and Asia and  
Africa. It was, indeed, the objsi-ss-ct of the  
order of November 6, 1793, to suppress  
the comm-ercc of central powcssrs With coe­  
mies coloniesia altogether; but that !):ng  
abandoned, the next idea which accursed,  
was to embarrass that made bv forcing it  
through neutral countries. Here, the!),  
arose}: new question, which turned entire.  
lv on another principle. That a neutral  
power had a right to carry on trade from  
itsoWn parts, many arttcles, though of so.  
reign produce, which had been incorpo­  
rated into the stock ot&#x27;the country not con­  
traband of war, and to all countries, was  
out controverted. That point, otherwise  
clear and indispmahle in itself, had been  
long settled in the highest tribunals, and by  
the most emineotjortsts in England. The  
circumstances which constituted such an  
ineorporation of soreign articles into the  
stock of the country, had also been nettlcd  
by the same authorities. Still the question  
which now arose, turned on this latter  
point. in sZ-rsiciogthis corn qrce through

But it is i-ctsicrred, that because it is eti.  
poured, that the produce of enemy colo­  
niea may be carried to Europe from the  
U. S. that the parts of Asia and Atrica  
are shut on them, and that because it is  
azipulated that the manufacturea of Ett-ss  
rope may be carried from the U S. to the  
West indies, that those of Asia and Afri­

The remarks above mad&#x27;*, relcr more particularly  
to a trade between the United States and Europe in  
the produce of enemy colonies. They are however  
equally applicable to the other objection stated in  
your letter, of a trade between the United States  
and enemy colonies, in the produce or manufactures  
of Atrica or Asia. None ol the. orders alluded to,  
inhibit that commerce, and it is most certain in  
that the article alluded to, gives no sanction to sucL  
a pretension.  
As to the conditions by which it is agreed to  
break the continuity of the voyage, I have to ob­  
serve that thpy are as favourable as you had expert­  
ed. W’e were authorised to stipulate, if Utter con­  
ditions could not be obtained, that the goods should  
be landed, the duties paid, and the ship changed. We  
stipulated only that the goods should be landed, and  
the duty paid, making the duty on European goods  
one per cent, and on colony productions&#x27; two. By  
exempting the party from the necessity of chang­  
ing tne ship, an important advantage was certainly  
secured. By fixing the duty at one per cent, in the  
  
one instance, ana ai two in the c/.her, it# was not  
possible that the slightest embarrassment should be  
thrown in the way of the trade. The duty payable  
on manufactures consumed in the country, is about  
15 per c*nt. and on West India productions 85.—  
&#x27;Tiie; irifhna amount made payable to the country  
oij the re-exportation of the articles, could not be  
felt by the merchant, ft would fall on the Euro­  
pean consumer. It could not be felt as a heavy im­  
position on the trade itself. Qur only competitor  
in it would be Great Britain, whose merchants  
woUt&gt;l labour under the disadvantages incidtnt to  
war, in a thousand shapes, more especially as the  
pons cr the w hole continent would be shut on them  
in not t eii’g able to get their goods into those ports,  
oln.erw ise fiSU by smuggling Lhcm-v-a mode which  
.could not tail to be onerous, if h succeeded, but  
which waslittely tu fail iu most cases. It should  
b ■ remembered also, that the increased duties which  
would acciue to the country, would tend, in the de­  
gree, to interest the whole community in support of  
p commerce, in which the commercial part was  
most materially interested. It is the policy of the  
European poweis having colonies in the West In­  
ches, to make the parent country the entrepot of the  
productions of its colonies, is not that policy wor­  
thy the attention and imitation of the United States  
in respect to the trade of the colonies in question ?  
Trie duty received would make some recompense to ;  
the nation lor the expenses incurred and sums ex- 1  
pended in supporting our right to to that trade. Be­  
S.des, by unking the ports oft ha United States the  
,** entrepots&quot; lor such productions, the country in  
general w ould derive some advantage from the mea­  
sure. Every ship engaged in the commerce which  
entered an American port, would bring something  
to, and take something from it. Tha vast amount  
of Asialick, European, and West Indie articles,  
brought to our markets, would cheapen the price  
of those articles at home, and each ship, while in  
port, and in the prosecution of her voyage, would  
require supplies in provision and other articles,  
which would raise the price of those articles, to the j  
great advantage of tha general interest of the  
Country.  
  
i lie limitation of the article to the term specifi­  
ed, was a condition which we presumed might&#x27;  
prove advantageous t&lt;* the United States, while it  
could not possibly injure them. It is expressly sti­  
pulated that the right of both parties shall receive  
at the expiration of the term. Those of the United  
States, tbereiore, would then he in force, and to the  
foil extent of their pretensions, in the same manner  
as if the stipulation had not been entered into. In  
another war they might insist on conditions which  
this stipulation did not secure, and it (treat Britain  
did no: yield to their demand, they might resort to  
any expedient to con pel her, which the wisdom of  
their councils might dictate. Any encroachment  
ou the part of Great Britain on their rights, as  
heretofore contended tor, might be considered Ly  
their government an act of hostility, and treated ac­  
cordingly. The least favourable conditions thatshe  
could offer, would be those alreudy setth d, which  
the United Slates might accept or reject, as they  
thought best. As a youthful, prosperous, and rising  
nation, it could not he doubted that in the next war  
their situation would be more imposing than in the  
present one. The piesumptiou is, that they would  
he able then to obtain better conditions than be­  
fore.  
On the third aiticle l have to observe, in addition  
to what is stated in our&#x27;joint letter ot January y,  
1807, that nothing would have been more easy than  
to have omitted any provision on the subject of it,  
aud to have placed that trade on the tooting of the  
most favoured nation. To obtain better terms by  
treaty was utterly impossible. We were much in­  
clined to omit any provision on the subject, because  
\ve were aware that the arrangement made would  
fall shmt of the expectation of our government and  
couulry, and most probably subject us to censure.  
We acceded to that arrangement from a conviction  
that it secured us better term* than we should he  
likely to enjoy, if left to depend on the pleasure ot  
the British government, stimulated as we knew that  
was to restrict us in it by the India company, and  
other interests of the country. It is impossible to  
conceive too high an idea of the jealousy which is  
■ entertainedpf the United States, in a commercial  
view, by that government, and of the danger with  
.which it thinks Great Britain is menaced by their  
extraordinary prosperity *!!*! rapid growth. The  
boldness of the projects, and tbs activity tad utility  
i ... v  
  
&#x27; with which they are prosecuted by our merchants  
and mariners, excite the admiration of Europe.—  
Great Britain has seen, wherever oiir citizens gain­  
ed a looting, they never lost it. Without distrusting  
her own means, or the hardiness and activity of to r  
people, she finds that our position remote from Eu­  
rope, contigions to the West Indies and the south­  
ern continent, and as near to India as herself, give  
us advantages, against which she cannot cope. The&quot;  
effort which we made and persevered in for seveiai  
months to gain admission into British India, on  
more favourable terms, and the disposition which  
was shewn by the British commissioners to yield,  
excited a sensation, or more properly speaking, an  
alarm in the board of India directors, and of the  
commercial people in general, even umong those  
who had no particular interest in the question,  
which was extremely obvious. Hud we made no J  
provision in the treaty to secure our admittance in- I  
to India, on certain conditions, we had much rea­  
son to believe that that commerce would have |  
been fettered to an extreme degree, and iu every  
form.  
  
we were extremely anxious to provide that our  
citizens might make their shipments Horn Europe,  
to take specie from Spain and Portugal, goods from  
England, &amp;c. and that they might touch at the  
Cape of Good Ilopr, and ut the isle of Bourbon,  
at the Mauritius, txe. that they might carry on the  
coasting trade in India, and be permitted to pass  
from Calcutta ts China. These advantages were  
insisted on, but the pressure which we made pro­  
duced reports from the hoard ol directors, at ti;e  
instance of the government, and fiom political  
men conversant in these topirks. which fixed the  
government in its d*cision not to grant them.—-I  
repeat, however, that it would have been easy to  
have omitted the regulation from the treaty, and  
placed the trad* on the footing of the most favour­  
ed nation, as it would have been at any time after­  
wards,&#x27;had the state of affairs in other lesfects ner­  
nutted it.  
By your instructions, a provision in favour of in­  
demnity was not made an mdispenstMe condition ol  
a lieaty. VVe were authorised to conclude one with­  
out it. We were, therelore, persuaded that the  
ground 011 which that interest was placed, could not  
tail to be approved. The arrangement which we j  
made authorised a just claim to expect a dismiss!- &#x27;  
on of all the causes that were depending in the j  
courts of admiralty, and even to an indemmtv in  
the cases ot condemnation. The documents which !  
we forwarded to you in our joint letter of  
give a full view of this subject, and to them I bea  
to refer. ■■ ‘  
Your 5th objection applies to the 13th and 19th  
articles ot the treaty, and in the tiist insianre to  
Jlie prohibition it contains, nf extending the privw  
liges which are made reciprocal between the parties,  
to other nations, which is supposed to lie a breach  
of nrutrality. Had 1 conceived that those articles  
were justly exposed to that imputation, I should  
certainly nut have assented to them. But 1 saw­  
no foundation for the imputation. With Spain  
and Holland we have treaties which secure them  
all the rights to which they are entitled, ft is usu­  
al, and certainly proper, for a nation iu estimating  
Us claims on other powers, to examine its treaties  
with them, and nut to think r.f setting up a prrreu­  
sion beyond the limn of such treaties. By treaty,  
neither of those powers have any right in the case  
i« question, nor have we in the ports of either._  
By treaty, Great-Britain has enjoyed those rights  
in the ports of the United States, as we had hi her  
ports from the year 179*. Spain and Holland  
  
knew the- conmtwns or that treaty, which was in  
force at the commencement of the present war. and  
some time afterwards, and would have been in force  
till late in the last year, had a special condition of  
the 12th article been earned into effect. To renew  
the treaty m the express terms of the former one, a  
treaty which deprived no one power of any exist­  
ing conventional right; which subjected none to  
conditions to which they had not been always sub­  
jected { which allowed to Great-Rritam on princi­  
ples of reciprocity, a privilege which there was no  
reason to presume that any other prrwer, especially  
Spain, would consent to reciprocate with the Unit­  
ed Stales, did not seem to be liable to the objec­  
tion slated to it. The general principle which you  
advance, of extending those principles to a smaller  
number of powers as possible, had also some weight  
in inducing us to accede to the arrangement._  
France is admitted to an enjoyment of them, in the  
same extent with Great-Britain. She, therefore,  
Ims no cause of complaint. I do not think that  
the stipulation forbids any arrangement of the go­  
vernment, relative to the number of ships of war  
that shall be admitted in the ports of the United  
-States at one time, or any regulation&#x27; relative to  
their conduct while within the purls of the United  
States, provided it be general and equally applica­  
ble to both powers. A stipulation that the ships&#x27;  
of war of each nation shall be hospitably received  
into the ports of the other, does not necessarily im­  
ply that there is to be no role as to the numbers to  
be admitted into the ports to which they shall he  
confined, or the order they shall observe while in  
port. All these topics have been at all time*, as 1  
have reason to believe, the objert of regulation by  
Great-Britain, and 1 have equal reason to believe  
that her government did not consider itself aa hav­  
ing abandoned its right to regulate them hy Util-ar­  
ticle. t , ■ I  
Your nrxt objection applies to thelsst paragraph  
of the t£th, taken in connection with the l!)th ar­  
ticle. By your construction of those part* of Ujc  
treaty, the United States would be bottled to claim  
redress in favour of Great Britain of herpnemios lor  
any art* of hostility which they might commit-on­  
her ships of war or merchant vessels, within the ad-&#x27;  
ditional limit, while she might commit, With impu­  
  
nity like arts of hostility on the ships of war ami  
nerchant vessels of her enemies, in cuse they did  
not arkuowledge it, and against their ships of war  
&gt;n case they did, although her own ships of war in  
troth cases would be protected within it. 1 was de­  
cidedly of opinion, and still am, that while those !  
i articles secure to the United Slates an onconditton­  
il advantage, none whatever is stipulated by them  
in iavor of Great Britain, which must not of neces­  
sity be common to her enemies; that her privilege,  
on the contrary, whatever it may be, must be found­  
&#x27; d on their consent, follow, and terminate with it.  
The 12th article stipulates that Great Britain  
shall not stop the vessels of the United States with­  
in five maiine miles of their coast, except for the  
purpose of examining whether they be American,  
or those of another power; and that she shall not  
stop the unarmed vpsscIs of other powers within the  
same limit, provided they acknowledge it, except  
to ascertain whether they beloug to those who havp  
acknowledged it. The vessels of the powers who  
;do not adopt the regulation are not affected by it.—  
They remain under the ordinary protection of the  
  
law of nations, which extends to the distance of  
cannon shot, or three miles from the coast. Be­  
yond that limit the enemies of Great-Britain have a  
right to search and seize her vessels, without be­  
ing amenable to the United States, and the same  
right is reserved to her by this article, as if it had  
not been entered into. Veseels of war Are express­  
ly excluded from the advantage of the regulation.  
It is the sole object of the 12th article to secure  
to the United States an accommodation, by extend­  
ing their, jurisdiction on their roast, in what con­  
cerns themselves, from three to five miles. The  
Stipulation is unconditional as to them, but condi­  
tional as to the other powers, dependent on their  
acknowledging the same limit—it is made recipro­  
cal, by being extended to the British dominions,.,  
northward of the United States, a circumstance  
which .merits attention, as it precludes the idea  
that any other equivalent was expected or intended  
to be given for it. It would have been extended id  
tiie dominion of Great Britain, in Europe and else­  
where, had the British commissioners desned it.—  
t hey declined it, frmn a tear that it might produce  
some innovation in the general doctrine of Uie law  
of nations on the subject. &#x27;This is, 1 thins, fairly  
to be inferred from the instrument itself,.  
The last paragraph of the iyth article stipulates  
that neither of the parties shall permit the ships or  
goods belonging , to the subjects or citizens of the  
other, to be taken within cannon shot of the coast,  
nor within the jurisdiction described inartirle 12th,  
so long us the provisions of the said article shall be  
in force, by the ships of war of other powers t but  
in case it should sohappen, the party, whose terri­  
toiial rights shall thus have been violated, shall en­  
deavour to obtain from the offending party, full and  
ample satisfaction for the vessels so taken, whether  
the same be vessels of war nr merchant vessels.  
If any advantage is given to Gieat-Britain by  
the arrangement proposed by the 12th article, and  
this clause of the 19th, to the prejudice of her ene­  
mies or of the U. States, it niuttl&gt;e by this clause.—  
She can certainly claim none under the 12th arti-!  
cle., Tins clause consists of two distinct members,  
of very different import. The first contains a ge­  
neral stipulation, conformable to the law of nations,  
applicable to all the dominions of both parties, and  
equally so to their ship&#x27;s of War and mere ham ves­  
sels. With respect to the latter, however, it is  
conditional. The second member applies to the n  
raiigemeiii in «)e in the 12th article, and in the  
seuse and spirit of that article is carried into effort  
in favour of other powers, which can only be done  
by their consent, then the advantage which js se_ j  
cured to lliemby it, will accrue likewise to Great­  
Britain, What is that advantage? Protection to  
  
mri* lueiruuiu vt^seis wumn me additional two  
miles, ami nothing else, it is obvious that the  
protection whic h isstipu1 •• ed in favour of ships of  
&#x27;war is provided for, by the first member of the!  
i clause, and not by the second. It cannot be by ]  
I both, for the distance defined by them is diflarent,  
i it being three miles in one, and five in the other.—  
It is equally obvious, that the stipulation contained  
in the second member of the clause, relative to the  
12th article, is intended to operate in the spirit of  
that article, and to he dependent on it. l*y the!  
terms “ nor within the jurisdiction described rn ar- j  
tide 12th, so long as the provisions of the said  
article shall be in force,” the stipulation contempla­  
ted is made conditional. In force, m respect to  
whom? Not the Vuited States, because it was un­  
conditional as to them. It wds conditional only  
with respect to other powers. Other reasons might  
be given to shew that the arrangement under consi­  
deration is not liable to the objection made to it,  
but I presume that those stated will be satisfactory.  
The difficulty to obtain the accommodation which  
was yielded in the 12th article was extreme. We  
laboured most earnestly to extend it to other pow­  
ers, without their consenting to reciprocate it in  
favour of Great-Britain ; but that could not be ac­  
complished. The British commissioners urged  
that as Great-Britaia predominated at sea, and  
must lose by the Concession in any form, it would  
he unjust for her to make the concessions in their,  
favour,, unless they would allow her the advantage  
of it. Finding that it was impossible to fxternl.  
the additional limit to other powers, on other lei uw,!  
we thought it adviseable to adopt the arrangement  
iit respect to them conditionally, potting it in their!  
power to acceptor reject it, as they thought fit.i-4  
\V« battered ourselves that as they eniild hot lose by  
it, they would aotadfush their assent to an arrange-i  
wsnt by Which they might gafn, especwilly as ill  
would prove advantageous -t* a frttnrfly power.—j  
We deemed it highly&#x27;Important to establish the ad-:

To your 6th bbjectioh, little need ?£

whatever from us, as was lolly shewn by the (etteiy

to that effect. The wbpjhs suhjert was Le-lore otir

Having noticed the objection whirfr are- sspesi­  
ally stated in your letter of May 20, IS07, andgjp­  
eu our view of the several parts of the treaty,to­  
which they relate, ] shall proceed to makeexpiann­  
tory remarks on the other articles,, ia order to do  
justice to the conduct of lbs American cqnmrissi­  
©ners in regard to them, , ,* , • „&gt; ^  
Article 5. You admit that this |rticl« i* sir #s­  
sential improvement uf that on the nttne subject fa  
the treaty ol 1794. It certainly improves it in tfco  
important interests; 1st, m tHht bf thh uavigwti*a  
of the United Stales, and 2d, u&gt; that of duties an &#x27;  
American productions carried to tbeBritish inarkSt.  
The tonnage on American ships in BriUuhfw H bad  
been raised to sterling per ton, while that dm  
British ships in the ports of the United States «*»  
only 50 cents, or 3*. g,i. per ton ; ami the duty da  
the bulky productions of the United Stairs, in A.  
un-rican bottoms, bad been raised to such a height,  
under the countervailing regulations which th*  
tieaty allowed, as to secure, in time of peace, the •  
entire carriage ot those productions to British ves­  
sels, if, indeed, it did not materially affect the pries  
of the artirles themselves. W bat made it more un­  
fortunate was, Unit the United States could nob  
adopt any measure to remedy those evils without,  
committing a direct and palpable violation of lh«  
treaty, as they were bound by i| not to raise the ex­  
isting duties higher than they were at the time the  
  
treaty was rone lulled. I hose evils would, however,  
have been completely done away by this article.—  
By it the United States would have a ri^ht to raise  
the duty on British vessels to any height to which  
the British government might raise it on theirs, a  
check which could not tail to prove adequate to the  
object, while they had also a right to give what prt­  
ference they thought lit to their own vessels, which  
might be done by reducing the duty on them below  
the tonnage which was imposed on those of Great  
Britain. This arrangement secured to the United  
States an advantage which G. Britain mold not  
countervail, as the necessity she te under to avail  
herself of every resource which the ran raise to  
command to raise revenue for indispensible pur­  
poses, renders it impossible for her to make a hkf  
discrimination in favour of her own vessels. The  
inhibitions of all discriminating duties, on the pro­  
ductions of the one, and manufactures of the ether  
party, whether they be carried on in American or  
British bottoms, was a stipulation winch it was  
presumed Would also prove advantageous ft* the If.  
Stales. The pernicious tendency of that principle ,  
was known to you, and we were happy to be able to  
suppress it. . : •  
The objections whieh yon urge to other parte of  
the articles, apply to clauses in the treaty of 1754a  
which it waa impossible for as to change: f have,  
however, to observe, that there is nothing in it to

nations of Europe, especially France, would be hap­

system of England : and as it is one wfiich could  
not essentially affect them, they could find no mo­

tVon which should compel G. Drittin to refusal the  
lew* which impose to high a duty on her manufac­  
tures, when exerted.. to the U. States. Our let*  
ter shewed that we did every thing in our power to  
obtain such a stipulation., J was however, persuad­  
ed.&#x27;ihat the want of it would nut ex pose us to all  
thd ievijs whirh you teem to apprehend from it, ad­  
pdtting that the British construction of that clause  
in l|e former treaty was a sound one, and that no­  
thing Is Contained in (be 23d article of the present  
one to discountenance it. (t is certain that no go­  
vernment wilt ever lax exports higher than indis­  
pensable necessity compels it, because such a lax  
tends in all cases essentially to check iutiusiry, and  
to destroy* the most productive source of national  
-prosperity. The inhibition imposed by the ronsii­  
tution of the United States on the congress, to tax,  
&quot;In the slightest degree, their exports, affords a  
Strong argument, drawn from the acknowledged  
* wisdom of its framers, against the policy of such a  
ta*, in the abstract; and I am persuaded that the  
; reasons against it are strong with Great Britain, if  
not stronger, than with any other nation. Without  
taking a more comprehensive view of the subject,  
it is sufficient to observe, that a tax on British ex­  
ports must operate as a bounty in favour of Ameri­  
can manufactures, which are already in an advanced  
State, id certain parts of the union. Great Britain  
must be .sensible of this fact, and aware of the en­  
■&#x27;eonragement which the present export duly gives  
them, and of the consequence attending it. I should  
* presume that there was not much cauie to appre­  
hend, that she would tax the export of her rn.itiu­  
&#x27; factores to the United States, to prevent their being &#x27;  
sent thence to other countries. The sole etlect m 1  
■&#x27; such a.lax wvould be to secure to her own vessels ]  
^the carriage of the artic les, if indeed, that were at­  
* tainable. In both cases the manufactures of Great  
&#x27; Britain would be the subject of the commerce. The  
* supply of the great, the productive and increasing  
markets of&quot; the United States, must be a primary  
- ■object of British policy, and Great Britain would  
*l doubtless be cautious not to hazard it for one com­  
■paratively of much less importunce.  
Article 6. As this article was approved, I shall  
* Wily observe, that I considered the reservation con­  
tained in it important, as it enabled the United  
1 States to counteract the Britisli policy, in respect to  
the trade With the West Indies, whirh is the object&#x27;  
* «f,it, by the means the most efficacious, whenever  
  
sney snouia oe resonea 10. j ne iraae ui ureal nri­  
• Um with the United States is carried on principally  
&#x27; by circuitous voyages, in which her vessels pass  
Yroih the ports of the United States to the West In­  
di«. By suspending the intercourse between the  
• &#x27; vin»»d States and her West Indies, in&#x27; British ves­  
. &#x27; *«lsi the chain would be broken, and the whole com­  
* Bierce in such vessels V», jn a great measure, sus­  
&quot; pended. The provision in the article obviously looks  
’v&lt;osurh an object, and the lime of carrying it into ef­  
? feet, unless the trade should be placed on satisfacto­  
- ry ground, would have depended altogether ou the  
&quot; United States.  
*■ llavihg already noticed the subjects which are  
‘ embraced by the following articles, I„,shall add but !  
little more, on any of them, to what is said in our  
‘ Joint letter ofJanuary 3d, 18&lt;&gt;7. The 7th was taken  
? literally from the treaty ol 1.794. The 8th and  
j&gt;th amended* as you allow, the articles in that trea­  
ty on the same subject. The 10th relative to Llock­  
Me, taken in connexion with the British paper of  
Dec. 11, 1806, placed, as I presumed, that interest  
•n ground which woold be satisfactory. The pre­  
* amble cannot affect it unfavourably, as it does not  
niter the acknowledged law. The only effect which  
&#x27;it could have, would be to admonish the couhs to  
* be cautious in admitting evidence on notice, on ac­  
* Count of the distance of the United States from the  
blockaded ports. It was supposed to give the U.  
- State* » claim to a more favourable rule in respect  
ii to evidence, than was allowed to powers more con­  
tiguous to the theatre of action. The doctrine con­  
stained in Mr. Merfy’s note to you was not contest­  
red by the British commissioners. It is on the con­  
trary not maintained in their note to us of Der.  
, 31st, 1806, in which it ta asserted to he notorious  
w that the king did not declare any ports to be in a  
* State of blockade without allotting to that object a  
, force sufficient to make the entrance to them mani­  
festly dangerous.” 1 quote the passage in their note  
to observe that the doctrine is not made conditional  
.ten auy other part of it, but is laid down as the es­  
tablished law. It justifies the additional remark  
thut the preamble was nut intended and raunot be  
construed to alter the law. It follows that it can­  
not produce any other effect than that which is a­  
f hove imputed to it.  
  
1 be 13th article relates to the search of mcr­  
rhant vessels, and differs from the lyth of the trea­  
ty of in theentroductory sentence, which en­  
joins it on the commanders of ships of war and pri­  
&#x27;vateers, to observe in the course of the war which  
may tjien exist, as much us possible the acknow­  
ledged rules and principles of ihe law of nations ;  
and also in the penal sum [which it encreases] to be  
given by the commanders of privateers before they  
receive their commissions, as a security for then­  
good conduct under them. It was supposed that in  
this as iu the preceding case the law remained un­  
touched, and that the stipulation produced no other  
effevt, than to enjom it on the governments respec­  
. lively, to be particularly attentive to the conduct of  
‘its officers in the respect alluded to.  
The 13th article and the paper of the Dmish  
commissioners of the 31st of December, 1806, ob­  
viously look to the Russian connexion, as the  
standaid of the acknowledged law respecting the  
Search of merchant vessels and blockade. That in­  
strument wus held constantly in view on both sides,  
in every discussion on those subjects, and indeed on  
every other to which it extends, and its doctrine ad­  
mitted, especially in those, to be the established  
law. We were extremely desirous, and used our  
best exertions , to introduce articles to the same ef­  
fect, into our treaty, but it was utterly impossible to  
accomplish it. It must however be allowed that if  
engagements of the kind alluded to, especially in re-&#x27;  
gard to blockade, for which there was a special do­  
cument, would not be observed, that n would be  
useles to stipulate them by treaty.  
, - On the subject of the 17th article, I have alrea­  
dy made spine remarks under another head. I can­  
not think tbnt a stipulation to receive the ships nf  
war of each party, hospitably into the ports of the  
.Other, restrains them from limiting the mini tier of  
.•hips to be admitted at one time, or from designat­  
ing the porta to which they slut!I be.admitted. A  
-Stipulation to admit them settles only, as 1 presume,  
J*1* .PTOWihribat,. shall be admitted, anil  
leaves open to arrangement the other points connect­  
)&#x27;&lt;a. bi--, *•» | ,  
  
ed wKh it. Thi* opinion is supported by a passage  
in thejirticle itself, a» lalire porta srt^ch secure*  
to vessels whiPh might be driven bjitresa of wea­  
ther, 6tc. into ports not ooen to them in ordinary  
cases, an hospitable reception lit such pons. Had  
the right to designate the ports been giten up, by  
life general stipulation, there would have been no  
necessity iur that contained,in this passage. The  
remark is equally applicable to the other case, that  
of the number to be admitted at one time.—As that,  
must he an aftjsir of ■special and strict regulation,  
an exception which admitted morp, by securing  
rights to them in’ease they entered, would necessa­  
rily defeat the limitation itself.  
The stipulation which relates to &lt; the good treat­  
ment ot the officers of each party in the ports of  
the other, being reciprocal, contains no reflection  
on one which is not applicable to the other : and I  
will venture to uflirm that it is equally necessary in  
regard to Great Britain as to the United States. It  
is well known in respect to the latter, that the pas­  
bions, which were excited by the revolution, did  
not long survive the struggle ; that the sword was  
no sooner sheathed, than the calamities of the war  
were lorgott n. The injured are&#x27;always the first to  
forgive. It is however, just to remark that time  
has essentially eflaced, from the people of both nati­  
ons, the hostile impressions which that aurduous  
conflict produced.  
&#x27;I ho 23rt article was thought to rnntain an useful  
stipulation by securing to the United States the ad­  
vantages iu navigation and commerce, which Great  
Britain might afterwards grant to any other nati­  
on. That stipulation was obviously founded on the  
right ol the most favoured nation, and subject of  
course to the condition incident to it. It amounts  
to this, that if Great Biitain should concede any  
accommodation to another power in commerce with  
her F.ast nr West India colonies, or any other part  
of her dominions, gratuitously, the United States  
would be entitled to it on the same terms ; but if  
she made such accommodation in consideration of  
certain equivalents to be given her in return, that  
the United States would not be entitled to those ad­  
vantages without paying the equivalents. The  
doctrine is the same in its application to the Unit­  
ed States. If they could grant any privileges in  
trade to France or Spain, for admission in their  
West India colonies, Great Britain would be entit­  
  
ica to me same, provided she admitted the United  
States into her islands also, and not otherwise. I  
could not perceive therefore how it was possible that  
the Uniteo States should be injured bv the stipula­  
tion contained in this article ; while it was proba­  
ble thttl they might derive some advantage from it:  
It could not restrain&#x27; them from passing a navigati  
on act to place them on an equal tooting with G.  
Britain, especially if it was made general or appli­  
ed only to her and the other nations having such  
acts. The right to pass such an act was not taken  
away by any other stipulation in the treaty, and  
there was nothing in this article that had such a  
tendency. The terms “ shall continue to be on the  
footing of the most favoured nation, &amp;c.” refer to  
the principles established by the preceding at tides  
and qj&gt;t to the existing laws or tegulations of either  
party. If the latter was the case, it would follow,  
that the tonnage duties, the discriminating duties,  
Sic. would remain as they were. The preceding  
articles were intended, in the points to which they  
extended, to establish a standard of equality between  
ihe parties, to which the regulations of each, whe­  
ther they exceeded or fell short of it, should be  
brought. It could not be doubted that the British  
export doty was of the first description, that it vi­  
olated the principle of the most favoured nation.—  
The British commissioners admitted the fact, and  
did not pretend to justify it on that ground. They  
oiged in iis favour only, that the s ime duty was  
imposed on exports to their own colonies in Ame­  
rica, and that if any change was made in it, to sa­  
tisfy the claim of the United States on the princi­  
ple of the right of the most favoured nation, it  
would be to raise it on the goods exported to other  
countries, not to reduce it on those sent to the Unit­  
ed States. The principle, however, established by  
this article, being applicable to that duty, it was to  
be presumed that it might fairly be relied on to ob­  
tain a modification of it, either by reducing the du­  
ty on exports to the United Slates, or raising it on  
those to other nations. There is nothing in this  
article to restrain the United States from adopting  
measuies to counteract the British policy with re­  
sped to ths West Indies. If that object had not  
been secured by a special article, from the possibi­  
lity of being affected by the others, the principle,  
established by the present one, could not have af­  
fected it, othei wise than beneficially.  
Having replied til your objections to the several  
articles of the treaty, and the papers connected with  
it, and given our view i : them, I shall proceed to  
make some remarks on the whole subject, to do  
justice to the conduct of the American commissi­  
oners in that transaction.  
  
In every case which involved a question of neu­  
tral right, or even of commercial accommodation,  
t&gt;i eat-Britain was resolved to yield no ground  
which she could avoid, and was evidently prepared  
to hazard war, rather than yield much. There  
seemed to he no mode of compelling her to yield,  
than that of embarking in the war with the opposite  
belligereut, on which great question it belonged to  
the national councils to decide. We had pressed the  
claims ot the United States in the negotiation, to  
the utmost limit that we could go, without provok­  
ing the issue. It is most certain that better terms  
could not have been obtained at the time we signed  
the treaty, than it contains.  
The state of the war in Europe suggested, like­  
wise, the propriety of caution on our part. Rus­  
sia was then on the side of England, and likely to  
continue so ; and Austria, known to be in the same  
interest, was holding an equivocal attitude, and  
ready to take advantage of any favourable event  
that might occur. Prussia,-lately powerful, had  
been defeated, but was nut absolutely subdued ; her  
king, the ally and friend of Alexander kept the  
lieid with him, and made head against France._  
I’he emperor of Frauce, far removed from his do­  
minions, was muking the bold and dangerous expe­  
riment, of the effect whirls bit absence might pro­  
duce in tli* iuleriour, and in a situation to be com­  
pelled to risk every thing, if pressed by his adver­  
sary, on the precarious issue of a single battle.—  
rhese were strorg reasons why we should not throw  
ourselves, too decisively into that scale.  
I h&quot; situation ol, the United States, always a res  
&gt;ec table ope, was then less imposing that it usual­  
ly, was. .It was know* that they were not on good  
leros with Spain, no&amp;tfcnt Francs was ths »l)y ot  
■* ‘$*$**i»* * ip&gt;-mA&#x27;.k \ r\ &lt;■&#x27;-*. v. ■»  
  
Spain. Their interionr too, was disturbed by a con­  
spiracy of doubtful extent ami dangerous tendency,  
the consequences of which were surely to be greatly  
magnified by all whd- were unfriendly to our happy  
system of government. Those circumstances could  
not fail to be taken into view, by any the most  
friendly administration .in England, wheu pressed  
to make concessiuns which it was unwilling to make.  
Add to these considerations the important one, that  
the British ministry had become much impaired in  
its strength, especially in wbat concerned the Unit­  
ed States, by the death of a very eminent and dis­  
tinguished statesman, and had not the power, or  
thought it bad not, to pursue a liberable policy to­  
wards the United States, and that its power was  
evidently daily diminishing.  
These considerations induced us to sign the trea­  
ty, and submit it to the wisdom of our government,  
alter obtaining the best conditions that it was pos­  
sible to obtain. We were aware that, in several  
points, it tell short of the just claims of our coun­  
try. But we were persuaded that such an arrange­  
ment was made of the whole subject as justified us  
in the part which we took. In the rejection or  
adoption of the treaty, I felt no personal in­  
terest. Having discharged my duty with inte­  
grity and zeal, I neither wish applause nor dread  
censure. Having the highest confidence in the  
wisdom, the rectitude and patriotism of the admi­  
nistration, I was satisfied that it would pursue the  
course which an enlightened view of the publirk  
interest, and a just sensibility to the national ho­  
nour, might dictate.  
Our letter of January 3d, was written in haste,  
and was deficient in many of the explanations  
which could otherwise have been given of the treaty.  
I was happy, when at Washington, to find that you  
were perfectly willing to receive any explanations  
which I might now be disposed to give of that trans­  
action, and to allow them the weight which they  
might deserve. In making this communication 1  
have indulged the freedom which belonged to it, in  
full confidence that it would be approved.  
  
i idnnoi conclude this letter without adding my |  
most ardent wish, that the administration may  
succeed in concluding our affairs with every power,  
to the happiest result. My retirement, whirh had  
been long desired, and delayed only by the arduous  
and very important duties in which I was engaged,  
had become necessary as a relief to my mind, af­  
ter much fatigue, and to the interest of my family,  
which had been neglected and greatly injured by  
my absence in the publirk service. It is still my  
desire to cherish retirement. Should it, however,  
be our unfortunate destiny, which I most earnestly  
hope will not be the case, to be involved in foreign  
war or domestick trouble, and should my services  
be deemed useful, 1 will not hesitate, at the desire  
of the administration, to repair again to the stand­  
ard of my country.  
I have the honour to be, with great considera­  
tion and esteem, your very obedient servant,

&quot;West lndies and the southern continent, and  
as near to lndia as herself, give us advantages  
si against which&#x27;s&#x27;hc cannot cope. ,The eﬀort  
which we made and persevered in, for several  
&#x27; months, to gain admi&#x27;ssion into British lndisst,  
on more savorahle terms, and the disposition  
&quot; whichwtts shewn by the British com mission­

&#x27; perly speaking, an alarnt in the board of-lndia

general, even ssssamong those who had no parti­  
ctilar interest in the question, which was ex­  
&#x27; &#x27;t-resii&#x27;nely obvious. Hsitd we made no profision

&#x27;the government in its decision not to grant

which is supposed to be a breach of neutrali­

justly exposedto that imputationsssil should  
certainly not have assented to them. But &#x27;I  
saw no soundation for the imputation. With  
&#x27; Spain and HoHan-ssl we have treaties Which se-ss  
btu-e them all the rights to which they are  
entitled. it is usual and certainly proper, for  
a nation in estimating its claimssson other pow­

not to think of setting- up a pretenssi&#x27;ien beyond &quot;­

ofthose powers have any right in the case &quot;in

enjo) ment of them, in the. same eXtent with  
Great Britain. She, therefore, has no cause  
of complaint. I do not think that the stipula­

&quot;that shall he admitted into the ports ol the_U.

ss there is no rule as to the knimners to be ad­  
  
mitted into the .ports to which-they shall be  
confined, or the order they sh&#x27;ctiil observe while

times, as I have reason to believe, the oizject  
of regulution bysi G Britain, and] have equal  
reason to believe that her government did not  
css&#x27;lside&#x27;r itself as having ahandened its right to  
regulate them by this article.

claim none under the 12th article. This clause  
consists of two distinct members, of very dif­  
ferent-import. &#x27;The first contains &amp; general  
ctipuhttiossz, conibrmable to the law of nations,  
applicable to all the dominions of both par­  
ties, and equaliy so to their ships of war and  
merchant vessels. With respect to the lat­  
ter, however, it is conditional. The second  
member applies to the arrangement made in  
the ﬂed article, and in the sense and spirit of  
thatnticle is carried into eﬀect in favor of  
other powers, which can only be done by their  
ment,&quot; then the advantage which is secured  
W-ﬂlþm by it, will accrue filtewise to Great­  
- With. 7What is that advantage ? Protection  
wsssitheir merchant vessels within the additional  
two miles, lad bathing e se,- It is obvious  
that the protection which is stipnlated in lit­  
Vol&#x27; Of ships of War is provided for, by the first  
member-sithe clause, and not by the cecnnd.  
Its—methe in both, for the distance dectfined&#x27;  
by&#x27;them is diﬀerent, it being three miles in  
. one, and five in the other. It is equally oh- 1  
do&#x27;n, that the ssiPUlation contained in the se- !  
cond member of the clause, relative to the1  
13!!! &quot;tides is intended to operate in the spi­

The thh nrticie relates to the search of

their good conduct under them. it was  
  
=euppuaed that in this as in a preceding ease  
  
the law remained nntonched, and the sti­  
pniatiun produced no other eﬀect, than to  
enjoin it on the g-zvernments respectively.  
to be particularly attentive to the conduct  
of its officers in the respect ailuded to.

both side.-, in every discussion on those  
  
subjects, and ind-ed on every ozher to  
  
- which ttetttenda,and its doctrine admitted,  
  
especially in these, to be the establithed  
law. We were extremely desirous, and  
oaedour best exertit-na,to introduce articlee  
to the same cﬀecx, into our treaty, bw. it  
was uttersslyimposaible to accomplish it. it  
musr ho&#x27;wever be allowed that is engagct­  
  
s &#x27;mente of the ltind alluded to, especially in  
&#x27; regard to blockade, for which there was a  
  
special docwneot, would not be observed,  
  
ss that it would be useless to stipulate them  
  
by trcassy.  
On the subject osthe 17.h article ! have  
already made some temarks under another  
head. [cannot think that a atipulsittion to  
receive the ships of war of each party hoa.  
picabltsiinto the parte. of the other, restrain:  
them from limiting the number of ships to  
be admitted at one time, or from designate,  
ing the parts to which they shall be admit.  
ed. A atipulatiun to admit them settlce  
only, as ] presume, the principle, that they  
shall he admitted, and leave: open to us..  
range—ment the Olhcs points connected with  
it. This opinion is supported by a passage :  
insithc article tiself, as to the parts which]  
  
sisecures tovesaels which might be driven]  
  
by stress of Weather, &amp;c; into porta out o, :

right to designate the parts been givent  
up by the general etipulcttiouss there *  
would have been no necessity lus that cnn l  
tained in this pass-gr.. The rcmrk ial  
equally applicahle to the other case, that*

(  
  
]  
  
strict regulation, an exception which aid-l  
mitted more, by set.-using rights to them in ,  
case they entered, would necessarily deleat !  
the limitation itself. l  
The stipulafion which relates to the good ]  
treatment ofzhe officers \-l each party in the ;

- ssssedsitioct&#x27;þe no mode of eompelling her to  
ss .ield, than that? of embarkingin the war  
ith the opposite belligerent, on which  
ss great question it belonged to the national  
eouncils to decide. We had pressed the  
{lar-ma of the [] S. in the negotiatisizn, to  
&quot;the,-utmost limit that we could do, without  
siprdvoking sithe issue. it is most certain  
&#x27; that better terms could not have been ob  
?&quot; ta&#x27;in&#x27;ed at the time we signed ths treaty,  
than it- contains: .  
_ The&#x27;state of the war in Europe suggest-.  
ctcd, likewise, the propriety of caution on  
- our part. Rossia was then on the side of  
England. and likely to continue so ; and  
. Austria. known to be in the same int-rest,  
was holding an equivocal attitude, and rea­  
- dy to take advantage of any favorable e­  
vent that might occur. Prussia, lately  
powerful, had been defeated, but was not  
lbsolutely subdued ; her king the ally and  
&#x27;friend-of Alexander, kept the field with  
him. and made head against France. , The  
emperor of France, far&#x27;removed from his  
dominions, was making the hold and dan­  
&#x27; gerous experiment, of the eﬀect which his  
absence might produce in the intertor, and  
  
in a situation to be compelled to rislt every.  
  
thing, if pressed by his adversary, onsi-the  
precarious issue of a single battle. These  
&quot; Were strong reasons why we should not  
throw ourselves too decisivclysi._into that  
scale. &#x27;\ &#x27;  
The situation of the U. S. always a re.  
apectable one, was then less important than  
it usually was. it was known that they  
were not on good terms with Spain, and  
France wastbe ally of Spain. Their in-ct  
si terior too, was disturbed by a conspiracy  
&#x27;of &#x27;dodbtsifal extant and dangerous tendency,  
  
the conseduences of which are sure to be 4  
  
greatly magnified by __all_ who were unfriend­  
ly to our happy system of government.  
Those circunsstances- could not fail to be  
taken into view,bylany the mosfifriendly ad­  
ninistration in. England, when pressed to  
  
make concessions which it &quot;was unwilling  
  
to make. Add to these considerations,  
the important ones that the British minis­  
ny had become &quot;much impaired in its  
strength, especially in what concerned the  
_ Us S. by the death of a very eminent and  
&#x27;- distinguished statsiesman, and had not the  
ower, or thought it had not, to pursue a  
&#x27;beral policy towards the ,_ssU. S- and that its  
ower was evidently daily dimioishing.  
The&#x27;se&#x27;considerations induced us to sign  
the weary, and submit it to the wisdom of  
si our government, after obtaining the best  
-- conditions that it was possible to obtain.  
We were aware that,&quot; in several points, it  
._ &#x27;fell short of the just claims of &#x27;our eoun  
Z_si._sry.&#x27; But we were persuaded that such an  
arrangement was made of the whole sub­

presumed, by former decisions of the Jiritoh  
, courts of admiralty, and exph nations of the  
, Erimh sewninent In a mannerwhkh was so  
far satisfactory to the United States as to justify

- Aouncue analysis of the&#x27;sererkl ordersof  
the Brttish gweruioeut reladte to the trade of  
iteutnd powers whh enemy colonies, will place,  
in a tleaf point of rkw, the rrouod of the cov  
roreiw between the porties andthe; precise  
  
object and cEect of the regulation prrpraed by  
the ankle under cooperation. The first or­  
der bears date on the 6th Nor. 1791 ltd. rett­  
ed the British cruSiers to bring in for la w ful sd  
jodkation all vesseh laden ndUt goods, the pn  
doce of nny colony ot France, or cammspro­  
irinons or suDD&amp;es for such colony. -That or.  
  
tier amounted, in express terms, to a declar. j  
lion of war against the neutral powers, andnV  
  
wras Dtsoed in that spirit by.the Bnttsh govero­  
fnent.The policy, ho wcW, which dictated  
the order, did not last long Events soon pro­  
duced a chanre of Dolicr. arid with it revo  
  
cation, or, to use the technide Phraseology of  
  
the admtraltr. a relaxation of the order, lite  
  
second order was of the Cth Jan, 1794. It oV  
  
rected the cruizers M to briDg in all resseli la­  
den with roods, the. produce of the French  
  
&#x27; West JixSa Islands andcoromg dlrectly fronT  
  
any port of the said islands to any port in ta.  
rope.&#x27; This order being directory prescribed  
the case io which neutral ressch engaged in  
each a trade should be seized, and thereby coo­  
coed the seizure to that case only. No vend  
engaged in that trade which did not come within  
the scope cf the order, could be touched  
Thus the tflcct of the order was to inhibit the  
direct trade of the United Sutes, between ene  
  
jny colonies and Europe In tlte production! of f colony.  
  
ttTry vessels whlch&#x27;snaa ot cwrrlng ta t? lie  
irrectly between th.e colonics of etieroies and  
the Detjtral country to which the vessel belongs,  
and laden with the property of inhabitants of  
isoch neutral country provided such vessel  
hal hotbe sopplylni? nor have wppl&#x27;i.&#x27;lht  
&quot;ewr on the outward voyageiTwith any arti­  
cles contraband ofwaT, fire. 1 ne sole object  
of this ortiet; teems to tuve been to introduce a  
new rule relative to contraband, by subjecting  
a vessel to seizure on that: account, on her re­  
turn torage, after depositing her cargo at her  
pi ice of destination It prohibits &quot; the seizure  
of nettrsi vessels, , Etrropean as &#x27; well as Ame­  
rican, engaged ia a trade between enemy coh  
nlcs and the neutral countries, by positive in­  
hibition. That the trade had been left free be­  
fore by restriction of the seizure to vessels en­  
gaged m the direct trade between enemy colo.  
nies and the parent country. It was now secu­  
red by positive bhiUtioiu The right to carry  
on the trade from the neutral countries to other  
countries, was left on the ground on which it  
stood before: That this order was not Intend­  
ed to aCcct that trade, and did not affect it, is  
.rnade sufSciently evident by many decisions of  
the courts of adrotralty, which have-been gW  
ren since the order, was issued, I In proof of  
this refer to all the cases that were decided  
by the British courts of admiralty, touching  
the trade of neutrals with enemy eolon.es Ja

next cases were those of the Lwe-Orne of  
the Rowhena, and some others of the same  
  
- kind, in 1805, which turned on the pMnt of the  
  
cnotimyty of voyage, in which the court, push­  
ing itidnctrine to the unjait and pernicious  
Ttcnt icompl ilned of, produced tW contrn­  
vrrsfwhkh took place between the countries.  
The communication between Mr. King and  
Lord Ilawkesbury is of the same character.  
The advocate General, admits or his report  
whjch was adopted by Lnrd 1 1 i w keVMry, and,  
&#x27;communicated by him to Mr. Kuig, that by the  
relaxation of the general principle , mpectbg  
the trade Vith enemy cokaties, it was diitincily  
understood, and had beed repeatedly so decided  
ibythe court of a of e-  
nemy colonies mght be troported into the neu­  
tral country, and reexprted thence even 19  
the mother country of such colony ; and in like  
  
manner that the- produce and manufactures of  
  
the mother country might be Carried to its co­  
lonies, lie states that the direct trade between  
  
tuli even be taken adrtntare cf, rsrtiail  
  
when it is considered,&quot; that the repon was a  
donted by the goverument, and commtmlcatcd  
ofucially, V the Secretary of State, to a fo­  
reign minister., fit h certain, however, that  
through the court of appeal, the new encroach  
menu ondte rights of the United Su$i was  
made, which produced the controversy which  
ensued immediately afterwards. f V V  
The discussion which; took place between  
Lord Mulgrave and myself in ltsul, on the suf­  
ject of the seizures then made, treated the en­  
croachment in that line as the special cause of  
complaint on the part of the United Sutes,  
&quot;Although the British, pretensien to inhftlt even  
the direct trade, had not been countenanced by  
  
the government, yet the commerce of the Uol-  
  
to accommodate witn u ny te mercnahis.  
They were content to decline tlie direct trade,  
and to prosecute, their enterprizes tJirough the  
United States, equally with the; mother coun­  
try and its colonics. It was natural, in the  
course of a controversy which invoiced such  
important interests, that the rights of the par­  
ties should be taken upon principle, and carri­  
ed to the greatest extents To the light throws  
on the subject, by a very&#x27; able esay, hich I  
received from you, J was much indebted, and  
I acknowledge, in this communication, the aid

IcountiTi ui i fortiri bet ween the United  
  
Sutes wsd Alia and Africa.- It WaSrWWed,  
the oeet of the order tf November f th, 1793,  
to suppress the commerce cf neutral powers  
with enemy colon rs altrgether ; but that being  
abandoned, the next idea which occurred, was  
to emb-urrass that trade by forcing it through  
neutral countries Here, then, aroe a. new  
question, hich lurried eat&#x27; re y on another prin­  
ciple. -.That a neutral vrower had . a right to  
carry on trade from its ewa ports, ia any ar­  
ticles, though of retw produce, which had  
been incorporated into the stock of the country  
notjrtrabandofw4r, acd to all countries,  
wan not controverted. That jpomt, other ue  
clear and indisputable ia Itstlf, had been long  
settled in the hiehest tribunals, and by the most  
  
eminent jarisu tn England. lhe circuroxtn-,  
  
ces which constituted such an incorptratianlf  
foreign ankles into the stnek of the country,  
had also been settled by the same &#x27; authorities.  
Still the cjuestirss which now arose, tamed on  
thie latter point.- ia forcing this commerce  
through neutral ports witis a view to enJr­  
rasa it, k became oecessarr (to give the great­  
est t fleet to that expedient) to tncreaae the dif­  
ficulties in those ports, which was duse ia the  
manner already stated. , &#x27; V;  
- If the instructions of the British grtrt ment  
did not inhibit the trade sn question, the adiust­  
nsenicoouincdin the ankie uukr comsders

a trade with enemy colonies and lie inarsr­  
nVui which interfere whh lu Tht article could  
not operate in any trade to which the instruc­  
tions did not extend, and concerning lkh  
there was no controversy. . In the present case  
the conclusion is the more trreutti-ble, because  
&#x27; there dd fKt esla evert h possIIfy of CoUro­  
Tersy irt regard io that trade. &#x27;  
v Bat it is inSerrcd, that because hb stipubj­

be .carried to Europe from the United Sutes,  
that the porU cf Aju and&#x27; Africa are shut on  
them, and that because it is stipulated that the  
manufactures ot. Europe mar be carried from  
  
1 the United Sutes to the Wett-lndes, that  
  
vsose os Aua ana Axncs are rmcuuiea irom

already obviated. Had the Instructions of the

Under the 12th article. &#x27; Thit clause consists of  
two distinct members, of irery diiTercnt import.  
The first contains a general stipulation, confor­

revpect to the latter, however, it it conditional.  
The second member applies to the arrange­  
ment made in the 12th article, and ra the sense  
and spirit of that article is carried into effect in  
favor of other powers, which can duly be done  
by their consent, then the advantage which is  
&#x27;secured to them br it, will accrue likewise to  
f reat Britain, What is that advantage I Pro­  
tection to their merchant vessels within the ad­  
ditional two broils, and nothing else. - It is ob­  
vious, that the protection which is stipulated in  
favor of ships of war provided for, , by the  
first member of the clause, and not by the te­  
&#x27;trxsbdlciiaiiiiobe byr.7ne:ifil$CJ&#x27;  
defined by them is cUfferent, it being three miles  
In one, and five in the other. It is equally ob­  
vious, that the stipulation contained in (he second  
member of the clause, relative to the 12th arti­  
cle is intended to operate in the spirit of that  
article, and ti, be made dependant on it. By  
the terras noft vrHhin Jhe jurisdiction discrib

to the objection made to it, but I presume that  
those stated will be satisfactory. 1

poRcy. Klost of the naijaus of Europe ipe­

iew, to see the U. States resort to that expedi­  
ent to counteract the restrictive system of En-  
Sland and as it is one which coukl not, essen­  
. ally kffect them? they could find no&quot; motive of  
that kind to inspire a wish &quot;to oppose it, nor  
could the U. S. ax I suppose, find one to exempt  
them from it. - - -- - ,v r.k . &#x27;&#x27; v --  
3Ve regretted that we could not obtain a slip-&quot;  
elation V hich should compel G. Britain to . re­  
peal the lawi which impose so high a&#x27; dutw on  
net manufactures, when exported to the 17. S.  
Our letter sliewed that we did every thing in  
  
our power to obtain such a stipulation. Iwa  
  
however, persuaded, that the want of it would  
  
not expose us to all the evils whidi you seem to  
  
apprehend trom it, admitting that the bntisn  
construction of that clause in the former treaty  
was sound one, And that nothinr is contained  
  
m the Cod article of the present one to discoun­  
tenance ifc-Itix ceraia that no government  
win ever tax Exports higher thani indispensa­  
ble necessity compels it,because such a tax  
tends in all cases essentially to check industry,  
and ttt!eiTth&#x27;Tnri  
national prcrrtv. The inhtbition imposed by  
the consutution of the U. States on tlie Congress,  
to tax, in the slightest decree, N their exports,  
affords a strong argument, drawn from the ac­  
knowledged wisdom of its framcrs, tgainst the,  
policy cf su:h a tax in the abstract y and I am  
persuaded that .the ; reasons against itare as  
UBosfltlsJGBriuia,. not stronger&#x27;,&#x27; than  
with any other nation, Wiilit taking a Wire  
comprehensive view of the subject, it is sufS­  
cientto o&#x27;werve that a tax7 on British exports  
  
must operate as a bounty fat favor of American

not much cause to apprcheiv that she would  
tax the export of her minufactnres to the U.

would bsto secure to her own vcxls the car­  
riage of the ankles, if, indeed, that were at  
  
tainable. lis both cases the manufactures of  
  
Great Britain would be the subject of the corn­  
HKrceTlie sdpply of the great, the produc­  
tive and increasing market of the U. States,  
must be a primary object of British policy, and  
Great Britain would daiWess be cautious not  
to hAtardil for ck comparatively of much kss  
importance. . &#x27;. .

only observe, that I considered the reservatkn  
contained in it important, as it enables the U,  
  
States to counteract the Briuh policy, w  
  
w uic itmx won we est laftcs, wcuca  
is the object of it, br the means the most efSea-  
cioos, whenever they should be resorted to. I.  
The trade of Great Briuin with the (.States  
is carried on principally by circuitous voyages,  
In which her vessels pass from the ports of the  
Uuited Sates to the West Indies. By siispen­  
ding the intercourse between the Unhid States  
ard her West Indies, in British vessels, the  
chain would be broken, and the whole com­  
merce in such vessels be, in a great measure&#x27;

obviously beks to such an object, and the time of  
carrying it into effect, uaieas the trade should

engagements of the kind alluded to, especially  
in retrard to blocLidc. for whkh there was a

it &quot;would be useless to stipulate them by treaty.  
On the subject bf the 17th article, I have al­  
ready made some remarks undcr another head.  
I cannot think that k! stipulation to receive th.  
ships of war of each party, hospitlhjy into the  
ports of the other, restrains them fro.n limiting  
the number of ships to be admitted at one time,  
or from designating the ptnts to whkh they  
  
shall be admitted. A stipulation to admit the  
  
settles only; as I presume, the princh le that  
  
they shall bt admitted and Urates open to ar-  
  
rangement the other points connected witn tu  
TsU opinion is supported by a passage iu the  
article itself, as to the points which secures to  
  
yts which migtote driven b

tv caws, an hospitable reception In such ports.  
lUd the right to designate tlie ports beea gi ven

been 00 necessity far that contained in this pas­  
sage. 4 The remark, is equally applkabk to the

; molestation or iniuryv and thai immediatj and

presentation of injury sustained by whiem.ix .It  
  
( then proposes to postpone the article relative  
  
loirripressment on account ot tnccinicumc,  
which were experienced in arranging any ar  
tide on that subject, and to proceed toaii­  
cluc a treaty on the other points thatVvee  
embraced by the negotiation. js a ttitiTe  
to such postponement, andtbecoriditton to itijit  
casures us that the BritislvcoHimisioneijswpe  
Instruct still to entrrtain the , dcassjori tcf  
any plan which could be&quot; devised to sectfre tire .  
interests of both states without injury to tWV  
rights of either. &quot; - r L  
By this paper it is evident that the rights of  
the U. States were expressly to be resttoed, :  
and not abandoned, as has been most errone­  
ously supposed ; that the negotiation on the  
subject ef impressment Wi. . to be postponed  
fo: a limited time, and for a special object on-&#x27;  
ly, and to be revived as &#x27;soon Sis that object  
was accomplished ; and in the interim, that  
the practice of impressment was to corres­  
pond essential with the views arul interests of  
the U. States. It is indeed, evident from &quot;a  
eoriect view of the contents of that paper,  
that Great Britain refused co disclaim or dero­  
gate only from what she calletl hev right, fis it  
also is, lliat as her refusal was made applicable  
to a crisis of extraordinary peril, it authorised  
the reasonable expectation, if hot the just  
claim that even in that the accommodation dc  
sired would be hereafter yiel4cd.  
In our letter to you of-NoV. 11, which as  
companicd the&#x27; paper under consideration and  
in that of January 3, which was forwarded with  
the treaty, these sentimshts were fully cou­  
fiiTnTc&#x27;d.: In that of N&#x27;ovi-inber 1 1 , we commiw  
n&#x27;icattd one iniportant fact, which left no doubt  
of the sense in which it was intended by the  
British commissioners, that that papeFshould  
be construed by, us. In callingyour attention  
4oahe-)assgewhicJ4,ealsfJimpxessmenU.  
in reference to the practice which&quot; should be  
observed in future, we remarked thr; the&#x27; terms  
&quot; high seas&#x27;-were, not mentioned in It, and  
added that we knew that the omission had  
been intentional&#x27;. It was Impossible that tbost  
  
ttrrns could have been omitted intentionally  
  
wim -our knewtedgtf for an y p rpoee ot her than  
to admit a construction that it was intended  
that impressments should be, confined to the  
land. 1 do not mean to imply that.it was un­

and us, that G. Britain l1jould abandon tlte

why it would not Jie ratified, and invite them  
to enter ag&#x27;uin on, the business with a. view td .  
such a result as was&quot; desired. &quot;  
Uy this letter the arrangement which we  
haiTsancrtioncicli- comprising the informal ones &#x27;  
srelative to impressment, and that&#x27; by treaty tn  
the other topics, was rejected, and in lieu of  
it we Were&#x27; instructed to enter into an informal  
understanding or arrangement? the whole  
1 subject, and as was to be inferred from the fair  
import of the letter, on the &#x27;same conditions.  
It&#x27;ws the rtore to be presumed that the gotf-  
- vernricnt yv&amp;s willing to accept, iivtftSjj mode  
which it proposed, the conditions which we  
might be&#x27; able to obtain in the other, from the  
consideration, that the latter were under its  
view jat he. lime&#x27;ihe instructions were given,  
by the paper of Jhe British commissioners of  
Nov. 8ih and our letter of the 1 1th, and the  
certainty with which it,, as well as We, must&quot;  
haye been impressed, that&#x27; more favorable  
could not beexpected.  
In defending myself against the imputation  
of having sacrificed the rights of our seamen,  
I shall be permitted to derive support from  
, the conduct of the government itself in. the  
same interest, vender that impression I  
have to re mark , th at&#x27; I corisidg r the con d act of  
tTieovernrneiU as. furnishing the mdsj ample  
vindicaticnof that of the American coinmissi­  
oqcrs. The, government was equally willing  
to enter into some arrangement, which should  
preserve the peace of the country, although it  
should not accomplish the object which had  
1 peen.so ardently dec.ircd. The only difference  
between the plan which we sanctioned and that  
which it proposed, , was that the whole ar­  
rangement should be informal. . Had the ad­  
ministration resorted to war as a preferable  
alternative, or been willing to leave the busi­  
ness unsealed, its policy and txample might  
Ivave uecn picau , j t-t-xpringtv

thl-y lire prosecuted by our rrierchahts and ma

has seen, that wherever our citi­  
zens gained a foot hold, they never lost it.-  
Without distrusting her own mcatis, or the  
hardiness and activity nl her people, she finds&#x27;  
that our positiojivreti&#x27;iote fi-omiuror conti­  
guous to tle West. Indies and the southern  
continent, and us near to India as herself, give  
us advantages against which she cannot cope.  
Trie effort which we made and persevered n  
for several months to gain admiawon, into Briv  
tish India, on more favorable terms, and the.  
disposition which Was shewn by tlie British  
commissioners to yield, excited a sensation, or  
more properly speaking, an alarm in the board  
of India di recto is, and of the commercial pfeo­  
&#x27;pe in generaf, even among those who had lib  
particular interest an-the question, which was  
extreinely obvious. Had we made uo provi­  
sion inhe treaty to secure our admittance in­  
to India, m certain conditiins, we had miich  
reason to believe that that commerce would  
have been fettered to an extreme degree, and  
in every form.  
We were anxious to proide that our c&#x27;ui:  
zens might take their shnmu-i!ts from Europe. &#x27;  
to take specie from -Spain and Portugal, goods  
from England, Etc. and that they anight

I -repeat! however, that it &#x27;wot;kl have been

By your instructioos, a provision in favor  
oritidemnily wa1 not made aniiidispensible---condition  
of a treaty. We were authorised  
to conclude one without it- We were, there­

th.e 13th aniile. F.y your consiriictiori cf  
those: parts of the &#x27;treaty the United Slates

Great Britain of her enemies, for an act of  
hostility, which they might commit on her

their-ships bf war in case they did, though  
her bwn slips, of war. in both pases would be  
protected within it. &#x27; I was xlecukdly oi opin­  
ion and still am, that while those articles se­  
cure to the United States aft nnconditional ad­  
vantage1, none whatever is stipulated by them  
in favor of Great Britain, which must not of ,  
necessity be common to her enemies ; that  
her privilege, on the contrary whatever it may  
be, must be founded ori their consent, folio w  
and terminate with it.  
The 12th article stipulates that Great Bri­

by it they would -not&quot; refuse their assent to

- especially as it would prove advantageous to a  
friendly power. &quot; We deemed ii highly impor­  
tant to establish the additional limit in favor  
of -the United States, from the advantage it  
might afford to their commerce within it, and  
from the effect&#x27; which the measure . seemed  
likely to produce on the future conduct of the  
&#x27; &quot; British squadrons on our coast, by whom it  
  
rouui not tail to be considered as a severe

It is&#x27; readily admitted that more suitable  
terms might have been adoptedlo accomplish  
tho object in a kw. But it ouht to be recol­  
lected, that as the right of jurisdiction imposes  
of necessity the obligation of protection with­  
out a special cjcception to it, there was some  
difficulty in making an arrangement which  
shoaid secure tothe Uuited States the advan­

is said in our joint letter of January 3d,: 18Q7;  
The Tth .was taken literally from the treaty  
of.&quot; 1794; The 8th and Slh amended, as you-  
  
atfoWt the articles in that treaty oij the &quot;same  
fctiject.. The iOtbi relative &quot;4p blockade ta­  
ken in connection with the i British aper of  
December 3 1, 1806, p)aced, Uiat as I presume,  
interest on&#x27; giound which would he satisfacto  
ry. The preamble cannot affect, it unfavora  
  
bly, as it does not alter the acknowlekgetl law  
The only effect which it could have, .would be  
to&#x27; admonish the courts to be cautious in ad  
mitting evidence of notice, on account of the  
distance of the United5 States from the block­  
aded ports. It was supposed to give the U.  
States a claim to a wore favrable ride in re­  
spect te videncei than was allowed ( power?  
more contiguous to ; the . theatre t5f action.  
The doTcifine-contained m Mr Alei 1 y&#x27;s note  
to you &quot;was not contested by the British corrlt  
missioners. It rs, on the contraiy, maintain  
  
ed in their note to us of Dec, 31st, 1806, in  
which it is asserted to be notorious lk that the  
king did not declare any ports to be in a state  
of blockade without .allotting to that object a  
force sufficient to make the entrance into  
them manifestly dangerous.&quot; I quote the pas­  
sage in their note to observe that the doctrine  
is not made conditional oh any other part of it,  
hut is laid down as the established law. It jus­  
tifies the additional remark that the preamble  
.was not intended and cannot be constn ed to  
alter the law. It follows that it cannot pro­  
duce any other effect than that which is above  
imputed to it. . .&#x27; , &#x27;  
the 13th -article relates to the search of merchant vesseK,  
ami differ from lhe 19th ol tbjreaty of 1794-, 111 the intro­  
ductory sentence, which enjoins it on the comnianJeis vf  
ihips ol war and ptivateeu, to cbrervein the course 01 the  
war, whicli ma then exist; as-much as possible the acknow­  
ledged mles aud principles oT the lawol natigns, andal oin  
the penal sum, which it increases to be jiven by the  
commanders cf privateers before they receive ihtir commis­  
sion, &#x27; security foi ibeir, good conduct undet them. Jt  
was supp3ed that in ihisas in the picedingcse, the law  
riiiuiucl untouched, and that the stipulation jpr.duced no  
oiher crTtct, than to enjuin it on the fcjemmuit respect­  
ively, to be paiticularly a&#x27;ttntive to the coiidi ci ol its offi­  
cers in the respt ct alluded to.  
The 13tb article and the paper ol the British eommissiun­  
er of the 31sto&#x27;L)tember, 1S06, obviouSiyU k. to the  
Ru sian convention, as the standard of the acltiiow edgtd  
law respecting the search of meichant vessels and blockade.  
That instalment was held constat i.y tirview on both sides,&quot;  
in every di cuss ion on those -subjects, and indeed on evtry  
other to which it extends, and its d( ct ine adinitted, esj­  
cially in iho e, to be the established fiw, we woe extreme­  
ly de- irous, and used our beot exert Ums, to inircduce articles  
to the same effect, ir.to our trmty, but it was utteily iniVs­  
sible to accomplish it. It must however be allowed that if  
engagements ol the kind alluded to, especially in rtgard to  
blockade, lor which theic was a special drctfment, would  
not be (.b.-ved, that it would be ueless to stipulate them  
by tieaty.  
On the subject of the 17th article, I have already made  
Sonne remaiks under aiKthtr head. I Cannot think that a  
stipulation to receive the ships of war of each party, hospi­  
tably into the poru c&#x27; the other, jestiaifls them Ircm lirhi,­  
ing the numbei of ships to be admitted at one time, orfrcm  
designating the ports to which they shall be admitted.&#x27; A  
stipulation to admit them settles only, as I presume, the  
principle that they shall be admitted, and leaves open to  
ar.angemeht the other points connected with it. This opi­  
n oa is supported by a passsge&#x27;in the artlc itself, as to the  
  
pons which secures to vessels which might be driven by  
stress ol wca&#x27;.ber, &amp;C. int ipoi&#x27;i.not opei to them in ordina­  
ry cae, and hocpi.able reception in such p ,rts. Had the  
nght to dtsignat the ports been given up by the general sti­  
j.ulaiion thete would have been no ncco&#x27;isy lor&#x27;that con­  
tained in this parage The remark&quot; is equally applicable  
to the other cae, that of t ie number io be admitted at one  
. 1 me. As that mast be an affair ol special and strict regu­  
at ion, an exception which admitted mo e, by securing rights  
t j them in ca-e they entered, would, ncteiiarily defeat the  
limitation itsett. -  
Tlie stipulation which relates to the good treatment of the  
oificers 01 each party in the ports of the other, being reci­  
procal, contains Q3 reflection on one, which is not applica­  
ble to the other ; and I will venture to afljrm that it is equal­  
ly necessary, in regjtrd to Greai-Britain as to ,he&#x27;U. States.  
It ii well known in resj)ect to ihe latter, that the passions,  
which&#x27;weie excited by the revolution,&quot; did not long survive  
ie stiiigglc ; that the sword was no sooner heathed, than  
the calamities of the war were forgotten. The injured are  
alwiy the first to lergive. It is, however, just t remark  
t tiat time has essentially effaced from the people of b th na-  
n, the hostile imprcsskn which that aiduous conflict  
produce-l. -  
Tin m article was thought toontain an usetul stipula  
ion by securing to tritf U. Slates the advantages in na.iga­  
uo: and commerce, wlrtch Great Britain might al&#x27;teiwaxds  
s&#x27;raut to any other nation, That stipulation waj obviously  
lo.inded on the right of the moitfaVoed 1 alion, and sxitject  
:o course to the conditions incident to it. It amounts 10  
itiis, that it G.eat Ktitain sh uldcynctrde any aCcoinmodatK

iy, the Uiiited Siate wculd be entitled to it on the same  
u.-ms; but if she made such accommodation in considera­  
tion of ce taint equivalents tbegiven l.ef&#x27;in return, that the  
United States would not be entitled to th&#x27;e advantagt s  
without paying the equivaieiirsr-The ajcti tne is the same  
in i i application lb the United States. If ikey could grant

0 the samV, provided she adniiued the. U. States into her

le that the U. S. shi old be inimed by

Richmond, February 28, 1808.  
  
SIR,  
It appears by your letter of May 20th, I  
1807, which was forwarded by Mr. Purvi-j  
ance to Mr. Pinkney and myself, at London, I  
and received on the 16th July, that you had  
construed several articles of the treaty, which  
we had signed with the British commission­  
ers, on the 31st of December, 1806, in a dif­  
ferent sense from that in which they were  
conceived by us. As the course we were in­  
structed to pursue, by your letter of Februa­  
ry 3d, with regard to that treaty, which w^is j  
continued in that of May 20th, was in ho de­  
gree dependent on our construction of any of  
its articles, or oh the political considerations  
which induced us to sign it, we deemed it un­  
necessary to enter into any explanation in re­  
ply, either ofodr Construction of its articles,  
or of the political considerations alluded to.  
We thought it more consistent with our duty  
to look solely to the object of our instructions,  
and to exert our utmost efforts to accomplish  
it; and we acted in conformity to that senti­  
ment. The result of those efforts was made  
known, by the documents which I had the  
honor to present to you, when I was lately at  
Washington,being copies of a joint dispatch  
which Mr. Pinkney and I had forwarded by  
Mr. Rose. We had flattered ourselves, that  
it might have been practicable to obtain the  
amendments of the treaty which the presi­  
dent desired, as the state of affairs in Europe  
had become more favorable to such a result;  
but in that we were disappointed. We found  
no difficulty in accomplishing the other ob­  
ject, of setting it aside, as we were instruct­  
ed t« do, in case the proposed amendments  
were not acceded to.  
At this time there is no objection to such  
an explanation, that I am aware of, and there  
are many reasons why it should be given  
You will be sensible that, so tar as an unfa­  
vorable estimate is entertained of that trans­  
action, it must, in the degree, tend to injure  
those who gave it the sanction of their name*  
—and you will be equally sensible, that if  
the United States arc in any degree interes­  
ted in it, at this time, it must consist in its be­  
ing viewed in a just, rather than an unfavo­  
rable light. In retiring from the station  
which I have lately held, this is the last act  
of public and private duty, which I have to  
perform, in relation to it. It is to me, in ma­  
ny views, a painful duty, but still it is one  
which it is highly incumbent on me to exc­  
  
It is far from being my desire to compro­  
mit Mr. Pinkney, in this letter, in the slight­  
est circumstance. In the management ot the  
business which was entrusted to us jointly,  
we acted with the greatest harmony, and  
exerted our best efforts to accomplish the  
object of our instructions I am not aware,  
that in speaking of any part of the treaty, I  
shall give it a construction in which he would  
not concur ; but that presumption is founded  
altogether on what took place between us in  
the coufrse of the negociation. To this com -  
munication he is not a party, nor indeed docs  
he know that such a one will bfc made. In e­  
very view, therefore, it is improper, and  
would be unjust, that he should be consider­  
ed as having any concern in it.  
The impressment of seamen from our mer­  
chant vessels is a topic which claims a pri­  
mary attehtion, from the order which it  
holds in your letter, hut more especially from  
some important considerations that are Con­  
nected with it. The idea entertained by the  
public is, that the rights of the United States  
were abandoned by the American commissi­  
oners in the late negociation, and that their  
seamen were left by tacit acquiescence, if not  
by formal renunciation, to depend, for their  
safety, on the mercy of the British cruisers.  
I have, On the contrary, always believed. Sc  
still do believe, that the ground on which  
that interest was placed by the paper of the  
British commissioners of November 8, lKOfi,  
and the explauations which accompanied it,  
was both honorable and advantageous to the  
United States; that it contained a concessi­  
on in their favor on the partof Great&#x27;-Britain,  
on the great principle in contestation, never  
before made by a formal and obligatory act of  
the government, which was highly favorable  
to their interest; and that it also imposed on  
her the obligation to conform her practice  
under it, till a more complete arrangement  
should bio concluded, to the just claims of tho  
  
ignited States. To place this transaction in  
its true light, ami to dojustice to the conduct  
ot the American commissioners, it will be  
necessary to enter at some length into tile  
subject.  
The British paper suites, that the king  
was not prepared to disclaim ot* derogate  
from a right on which the security of the Bri­  
tish navy might essentially depend, espe­  
cially in a conjuncture when lie was en­  
gaged in wars which enforced thertcces­  
sity of the most vigilant attention to the  
preservation and supply of his naval force ;  
that he had directed his commissioners td  
give to the commissioners of the U. States  
the most positive assurances that instructi­  
ons had been given, and should be repented  
and enforced, to observe the greatest caution  
in the impressing of British seamen, to pre­  
serve the citizens of the United States from  
molestation or injury, and dial inrimediate 5c  
prompt redress should be a (forded on any re­  
presentation Of injUfy sustained by them. It  
then ptoposes to postpone die article rela­  
tive \o impressment on account of the diffi­  
culties which were experienced in arranging  
any article on that subject, and td proceed •_&gt;  
conclude a treaty oil the otlitr points taat  
were embraced by the negotiation: As a  
motive to such postponement, aijd the condi­  
tion ofit.it assures Us that the British com­  
missioners were instructed still to entertain  
the discussion of any plan which could be de •  
vise&#x27;d to secure the interests of both siates  
without injury to the rights of either.  
By this papcl* it is evident that the rights  
of the United States were expressly to be re­  
served; and not abandoned, as has been most  
erroneously supposed ; that the negociation  
on the subject of impressment was to He post­  
poned for a limited time, and for a special  
object only, anil to be revived as soon as that  
object was accomplished ; and in the interim  
that the practice of r.iipressment was to cor­  
respond essentially with the vie\Vs and inte­  
rests of the United States. It is, indeed evi­  
dent, from a correct view of the contents of  
that paper, that Great-Britain refused loclig.  
claim or derogate only from what she called  
her right, as it also is, that as her refusal was  
made applicable to a crisis of extraordinary*  
peril, it authorised the reasonable expecta­  
tion, if not the juSt claim, that even in that  
the accommodation desired, would be hereaf­  
ter yielded.  
  
In our letter toy oU of November 11, which  
accompanied the paper under consideration,  
and in that of January 3, which was forward&#x27;­  
with the treaty, these sentiments were ful­  
ly continued. In that of November 11, we  
communicated one important fact, which left  
no doubt of the sense in which it was intend­  
ed by the British commissioners, that that  
paper should be construed bv us. In calling  
your attention to the passage which treats of  
impressment, in reference to the practice  
which should be observed in future, we re­  
marked that the terms “ high seas” were not  
mentioned in it, and addded that we knew  
that the omission had been intentional. It  
was impossible that those tends could have  
been omitted intentionally &lt;with our Anow­  
edge, lor any purpose other than toadmit a  
construction that it was intended t intin.pt ess­  
ments should bo confined to the land. 1 i do  
not mean to imply that it was understood be­  
tween the loutish commissioners and us, that  
Great Britain should abandon the practice of  
impressment on the high seas altogether. I  
mean, however, distinctly to state tint it  
was understood that the practice heretofore  
pursued by her should lie abandont l, and  
that no impressment should be made on the  
high s-as under the obligation of that paper,  
except in cases of an extraordinary nature!  
to which no general prohibition against it  
could be construed fairly to extend. The  
cases to which I allude were described in out­  
letter of November 11. They suppose, a  
British ship of war and a merchant v&#x27;essei of  
tlicU. States,- lying in the Tagus or some o­  
ther port, the desertion of some of the sai­  
lors from the ship of war to the merchant  
vessel, and the sailing of the latter with stick  
descsters on board, they being British sub­  
jects. It was admitted that no general pr &gt;­  
hibition against impressment could be con­  
strued to sanction such c tvrs of injustice and  
fraud ; and to such casts it was understood  
that the practice should iii future be Confin­  
  
It is a just claim on our part, that the ex­  
planations which were given of that paocr  
I by the British cohimissisoners when thcr  
j presented it to us, and afterwards while the  
negotiation was depending, which we com­  
municated to you in due order of time, should  
be taken into view, in a fair estimate of out­  
conduct in that transaction. As the arrange­  
ment which they proposed was of an informal  
nature, resting on an iihders-andf ig Int.veed  
the parties in a certain degree confidential,  
it could not otherwise than happen that such  
explanations would bo given us in the co irs.;  
of the business, of the \ie.vs of their govern­  
ment in regard to it. And if an arrange­  
ment by informal understanding is admissi­  
ble in any case between nations, it was our  
duty to receive those exp,anations, to ri\c  
them the weight to which they were julib  
entitled, and to communicate them to yn i.  
with our impression of the extent of the ob*  
ligation, which they imposed. It js in that  
mode only that what iscalle 1 an informal un­  
derstanding between nations can bb entered  
into, It presumes a want of precision in un­  
written documents connected w ith it, which  
is supplied by mu ual explanations and con­  
fidence.- Reduce the transactino to form and  
it becomes a treaty. That an informal u*j  
derstanding was an admissible mode of ar­  
ranging this interest with (ircat Britain is  
made sufficiently evident by yonr letter of  
February 2d, 1807, in reply to ours of Nov,  
11, of the preceding year.  
Without relying, however, on the expla­  
nations that were given by the British com­  
missioners of the import of that paper,  
the course which their government intended  
to pursue under it, it is fai.t arc-mark &lt;n

vindication of their rights. The rfieve cir­  
cumstance of entertaining an amicable nego-.  
tiation by one party thr the adjustment of a  
control ers&gt; . where no right hailhccn acknow­  
ledged in it by the other, gives to tl)e latter  
a j-.ot claim to such a forbeuruncS on the  
part of the former. Hut the entertainment  
of a negotiation for the express purpose of  
securing interests sanctioned by acltnowicdg­  
fd rights, makes sucft&#x27;clivim irresistible.— ‘  
We were, therefore decidedly of opinion, that  
the paper of the British commissioners plac­  
ed the interest of impressment on ground  
which it was bo*fi safe and honorable for  
tiie United Stales to admit: that in short, it  
give their government the command of the  
subject fox* every necessary and useful pur­  
pose. Attached to the treaty it was the bu­  
tts or condition, on which the treaty rested.  
Strong in its character in their favor on the  
great question of right, and admitting afa­  
vor.d&#x27;h; construction on others, it placed  
tic :n on more elevated ground in those res­  
pects than the” It ul held before ; and by  
keeping the t rgMimion open v&gt;obtain a more  
;omp&#x27;eat adjustment, the administration was  
armed with the most effectual means of se­  
curing it. Uv tliis arrangement the govern­  
ment j.os«e*s»&#x27;d a power to coerce without  
beic&#x27;s compelled to assume the. character be­  
lr.ngi.ig to c» ercion, ar.d Was able to give ef­  
fect to that power without violating the r.ela­  
t&#x27;oos of hinitv bet-.*«_tn the countries. &#x27;I&#x27;he  
l ight to break off die negotiation and appeal  
to force, could never be lost sight of in any  
discussion on the subject; while there was no  
obligation to make th .t appeal till necessity  
compelled it. If great Britain conffirnted  
her practice to the rule prescribed by the  
paper of I&#x27;foveroher 8, and the explanations  
which acconlpabied it, our government might  
rest on that ground with advantage ; but if  
she departed from that rule and a favorable  
opporturitv offered for the accomplishment of  
a more complete and satisfactory arrange­  
ment, by a decisive effort, it would be at li­  
berty to scieo such opportunity for the ad­  
  
vantage ot the country.  
These considerations, founded or. A view of  
the proposed arrangement itself, furnished  
strong inducements to us to pr iceeu to the&#x27;  
other objects of the negotiation. There  
were, other considerations pfti ditferent cha­  
rdoter, which recommended it with still  
■gi cater force. Had we refused to proceed  
in the negotiation, what wits the alternative  
which such a refusal presented to our view ?  
The negotiation vv&#x27;„ Ul have been at an end,  
after having failed m all its objects ; for if  
this interest was not arranged, nohe others  
could lie. The attitude which the govern­  
ments held towards&#x27;each other, was in a cer­  
tain degree hostile. Injuries had been iu­  
llicted by one party, and resentment shewn  
by the other, the latter having taken a step  
»n the case of the non-importation law,  
which was intended to vindicate the public  
rights and honor by being made the means  
of/ibtainihg a redress of vhotc injuries. The  
measure w tr, intended ior the mini .-.try cfr  
Ivjr. Pitt, from which the injuries were re­  
ceived ; but by the removal of that ministry,  
and the delay which took place in the pas­  
sage of the law, It came into operation a­  
gair.st the ministry of Mr. Tox and Lord  
Tdrenville, who would not have rendered  
thfe-e injuries, and against whom of courso  
sv.eh a weapon won Id&#x27;hot have been raised.  
iN&#x27;otvvilhstanding thh existence oi that law,  
and the attitude which still remaincM be­  
tween the&#x27;government s, Tt was impossible to  
np| e&gt;.l to it as a strong motive of action with  
the new ministry, Such att appeal was sure  
t i pi cdv.ee more jiarm than good. It would  
hr vo lost us all claim on the gtmerous feelings  
u: :i liberal policy, which the new ministry  
wv:, br^v-vrd to indulge and disposed to a­  
&lt;lopt tow mils the United States. The ne­  
gotiation, thvrefni e, with the new ministry,  
was conducted by policy, as well as by in­  
c&#x27;lr.Htion, on friendly and conciliatory prin-,  
ciplcs- Should it fail, however, in its object,  
;rdbe broken oil&#x27;, the relation between the  
two pat ties would change in an instant.—  
Prom that moment the new ministry would  
stand on the ground of the old one, and the  
mu’on be united in all its political parties a­  
{vainst ns. The attitude would become in  
tact, what the exterior announced it to be,  
ho tile, and it was difficult to perceive how it  
could be changed, and peace be preserved  
with honor m the United States. They could  
o- t recede from the ground which they had  
taken., or acc&lt; or, bv compulsion, terms which  
  
they h:i:l rejected in nn amicable negotiation,  
War, therefore, seemed to be the inevitable  
ccnscqucucc of such a state of things, Vc I was  
far fro:n considering it an alternative which  
ought to he proferred to the arrangement  
which was offered to 113. When I took into  
view the prosperous and happy condition of  
United Htates compared with that ot other  
nations; that, as a neutral power, they were  
almost the exclusive carriers of the produc­  
tions of the whole \Voi ld ; and that in com­  
merce thev Nourished beyond example, not­  
withstHiding the losses which they occasion­  
ally&#x27; suffered, I was strong in the opinion  
that those blessings ought not to be hazard­  
fed in sirch a question. Many other consi­  
deration!, tended to confirm me in that sen­  
tirftent. 1 knew that the United States were  
hot prepared for war ; that their coast was  
unfortified, and their Cities in a great mea­  
sure&#x27;defenceless; that their militia, in many  
• &gt;f the states, was neither armed nor trained;  
and that their whole revenue was derived  
from comrytircc. 1 could not presume that  
i here \vh3 just cause to doubt which of the al­  
te••native*, might to he preferred. II .d it,  
however, i&gt;» imi practical)1&#x27;- to terminate the  
negotiation, without such an adjustment as  
that prephsed, and without taking any deci­  
sive measure in consequence of its failure,  
what w t» to become of the non importation

.. id *• &#x27; powet t. ...C... .t- &quot; treaty t- %t  
  
woulu b* obligatory on the United States,  
which did not arrange in a satisfactory man­  
ner the interest of impressment. We agreed  
also to proceed in a disensssion of the other  
objects of tile negotiation, and eventually cou&#x27;-,  
eluded a treaty; it being understood, from&#x27;  
what we had frequently staled, that if onr  
government should disapprove the arrange­  
ment relative to impressment, the whole  
would fall with it. Thus the United States  
enjoyed the advantage of being at liberty to  
accept or reject the arrangement, while on  
the British government it was binding.—  
With one party it was a project, with the  
other a treaty. There was in truth nothing  
unreasonable in this circumstance, as the  
British commissioners, acted in the pre­  
sence of the cabinet, consulted and took its  
instruction on every point, while our distance  
from our government rendered such a re­  
currence to it impossible. This advantage  
however proceeded from the nature of the  
transaction; it was not the effect of finesse  
on our part. We advanced in the negotia­  
tion, and concluded a treaty in a firm belief,  
that although it fell short of what we had  
expected to obtain, it was Nevertheless, in  
the then state of affairs, such a one as ihc  
United States might adopt with credit and  
advantage. I have no doubt that the Bri­  
tish commissioners entertained still greater  
confidence in such a rest-**. The circum­  
stance of our finally agreeing tosanetion^the  
arrangement rather than break off the nego­  
tiation, at which issue we had frequently  
stood, in the progress of it. was calculated to  
make that impression. But it was much  
strengthened by a knowledge, that the whole  
arrangement would expose them to very  
severe and probably successful attacks from  
the opposition, while they had no expecta­  
tion that it would he popular in the country.  
  
IW your icuer or rei). oil, 1307, in reply  
to ours of Nov. Uth, 1806, the course which  
the government resolved to pursue was an­  
nounced. By it we were informed, that the  
President disapproved the informal arrange­  
ment proposed by the British commissioners  
relative to impressment, and was resolved  
to cuter into no treaty with the British gov­  
ernment, which when limited to, or short ol  
strict right on every other point, should in­  
clude in it no article on that particular one ;  
that in case such an article could not be ob­  
tained, we should terminate the negociaticn  
without any formal compact wluitevpr, but  
with a mutual understanding, founded on  
friendly anil liberal discussions anil explana­  
tions&#x27;; that in practice each partv would en­  
tirelv conform to what should be&#x27;thus mfor­  
mally settled between them. And we were  
authorised to give assurances, in case such  
*t!i i • • • • t be sutiofaCtoi&#x27;y in sut&gt;­  
stance, that as long as it should be respected  
in practice particularly on the subjects of iicu­  
tt al iradejSc impressment the president would  
earnestly, and probably successfully, recom­  
mend it to Congress not to permit the non­  
importation law to go into operation ; and in  
the mean time, that he would exercise the  
power vested in him bv an act of congress,  
if no intervening intelligence forbade it, of  
suspending its operation till the meeting of  
congress, who, being in session, would have  
an opportunity of making due provision for  
the&#x27;ease ; Sc finally, that if a treaty, which did  
not provide for the interest of impressment,  
should have been concluded before the receipt  
of that letter, we should candidly apprize the  
British commissioners of tile reasons why it  
would not be ratified, and invite them to en­  
ter again on the busineSS with a view to such  
a de-suit as was desired.  
By this letter, the arrangement which we  
had sanctioned, comprising the informal one  
relative to impressment, and that by treaty  
on the other topics, was rejected, anil in lieu  
of it, we were instructed to enter into an in­  
formal understanding or arrangement of tlie  
whole subject, and as Was to be inferred from  
the fair import of the letter, dn the same  
conditions. Tt was the more to be presumed  
that the government was willing to Accept,  
in the mode which it proposed, the conditi­  
ons which we might be ahhe-to obtain in the  
other, from the consideration, that the latter  
were under its view at the time the instruc­  
tions were given, by the paper of thu British  
commissioners of November 8th, and our let­  
ter of the 11 tli, and the certainty with which  
it, as well as wc, must have been impressed,  
that more favorable could not be expected.  
l:i defending myself against th&#x27;c imputati­  
on of having sacrificed the rights of our sea­  
men, I shall be permitted to derive support  
from the conduct of the government itself in  
  
mt* same iiuercsi. \jnuer that impression,  
I have to lemark, that f consider the con­  
duct of the government as furnishing the  
most ample vindication of that of the Ame­  
rican commissioners. The government \vas  
equally willing to enter into xnm&gt; Arrange­  
ment which should preserve the peace of The  
country, although it should not accomplish  
the object which had beer: sc&#x27;ardently desi­  
red. The only difference between the plan  
which we sanctioned, anil that which it pro­  
posed’, was that the whole arrangement  
should he informal. Had the administration  
resorted to war as a preferable alternative,  
or been willing to leave the business unset­  
tled, its policy and example might have bfccrt  
plead against us • but in offering to accept  
ihe same conditions in an informal mode* &amp;  
to withdraw, in some form, the non-importa­  
tion law as a motive to it, it shewed that the  
considerations which had been respected by  
us, fc id as much weight with it.  
Hut the conduct of the administration fur­  
nishes other strong arguments in favor of  
the arrangement.proposed hy the American  
commissioners. By engaging to observe the  
informal arrangement which wewere instruc­  
ted to enter into, as long as Great-Britain  
should obs erve it, it seemed as if the United  
States would be deprived of the right of in­  
sisting on other terms, however favorable  
the opportunity for It might be, while Great  
Britain would be at liberty to depart from  
such ah arrangement whenever the events  
of war furnished her ah adequate motive  
for it. This was the opposite of our ar­  
rangement, as l have stated above ; by which  
ns we presumed, she would be bound and  
we free. Certainty to our merchants was all­  
imp n t.int. Any fair well-defined rule, within  
which they might prosecute in safety their  
enterprises, although it might fall short in  
some respect of our just claims, might per­  
il ips be preferable to frequent collisions  
which put every thing at hazard. In any  
event it was an oKject of great importance  
to keep the peace of the country in our own  
hands, by retaining the right to resort to  
war when it suited Us and then only

i will now proceed tp the other topics,  
which are adverted to in your letter of May  
20, 1807, and on which I shall be as concise  
as possible. In your examination of the  
treaty you notice several of primary impor­  
tance, which you conceive to have been im­  
properly arranged in the articles which re­  
fertothem. I will pursue in tny remarks the  
order which you have traced.  
You consider the 11th article as objecti­  
onable, in having shut to our commerce im­  
portant channels which were left open to it  
by the decisions of the British courts, and  
the principles contained in the communica­  
tion from Lord Hawkcsburyto Mr. King.—  
In support of that opinion you observe, that  
as the article stipulates that the United  
States may carry the manufactures and pro­  
ductions of Europe from their own ports, to  
any colony of the enemies of Great-Britain,  
they arc prohibited by it from carrying the  
manufactures or productions of the coun­  
tries beyond the cape of Good-Hope, in like  
manner, tosnch colonies. You observe also,  
that as the United States are authorised to  
carry from their own ports the productions  
of enemy colonies to Europe, thej are prohi­  
bited from carr) ing those productions to the  
southern coast of the Mediterranean, or be­  
yond the oape of Good Hope, or to any other  
enemy or neutral colonies in thistuarter.  
  
I am persuaded that you will b« satisfied,  
on further consideration, that this construc­  
tion of that article is unfounded. It is not  
the object of the article to regulate the gen­  
eral commerce of the countries, cr to com­  
proniit their claims in any case to which the  
regulation docs not explicitly extend.­  
The regulation prescribed by it applies to  
a case of controversy between the parties, in  
a point of immediate contact, aad it was the  
object of the article to adjust tht controver­  
sy in that point. If we advert to the issue  
which was made up between them, as clear­  
ly defined by the orders of the British govern­  
ment, the deerskins of the courts of admiral­  
ty under them, and the discussions which  
took place between the governments on the  
subject, we shall find that in no view can the  
construction which you impute to the article,  
be supported.  
The issue lately made up between the par­  
ties, involved solely the question, what cir­  
cumstances or acts, to be performed in the  
-.cutml ccur.trv, &quot;’crc r,cc£j5«ry tv vicnL  
the continuity of a voyage from the colony of  
an enemy to its parent country/or some ene­  
my Country ill f.urope? Tliis point hadboen  
settled, as was presumed, by former decisi­  
ons of the Hrttish courts of admiralty, and  
explanations of the British government, in a  
manner which was so far satisfactory to the  
United States, as to justify a belief, that if  
those decisions and explanations had been  
adhered to, the existing contraversy on this  
subject would not have arisen. But in 1805  
the British courts of admiralty insisted on the  
performance of new acts in the* United States  
or, what amounted to the same thing, exten­  
ded by Construction, the doctrine of former  
decisions in such a manner as to make the  
performance of new acts, such too as were  
of a nature highly onerous and oppressive,  
indispensably necessary. On this special  
point the parties were at issue, and the sole  
object of the article was to adjust, by tempo­  
rary arrangement, the pontroversy on that  
point. The rights of the parties, in every o­  
thcr instance, not within the scope of the ad­  
justment, were to remain, of course, untouch­  
ed, &amp;, in that particular one, to revive at the  
expiration of the term limited for the dura­  
tion of the article.  
  
a concise analysis ot tne several orders ot  
the British government relative to the trade  
of neutral powers with enemy colonies, will  
place, in a clear point of view, the ground of  
the controversy between the parties, and the  
precise object and effect of the regulation  
proposed by the article under consideration.  
The first order bears date on the 6th No­  
vember, 1793. It directed the British crui­  
sers to bring in for lawful adjudication all  
vessels loaded with goods, the produce of  
any colony of France, or carrying provisions  
or supplies for such colony. That order a­  
mounted, in express terms, ^Qa declaration of  
war against the neutral powers, and it was  
issued in that spirit by the British govern­  
ment. The policy, however, which dicta­  
ted the order, did not last long. Events  
soon produced a change of policy, and with  
it a revocation, or, to use the tcchnciai  
phraseology of the admiralty, a relaxation  
of the order. The 2d order was of the 8th  
of Jan. 1794. It directed the cruizers“ to  
bring in all vessels loaded with goods, the  
produce of the French W. India Islands, &amp; co­  
ming directly from any port of the said Isl­  
ands, to any port in Europe.” This order  
being directory, prescribed the case in which  
neutral vessels engaged in such a trade  
should be seized, and thereby confined the  
seizure to that ca^e only. No vessel engag­  
ed in that trade which did not come within  
the scope of the order, could be touched —  
Thus the effect of the order was to inhibit  
the direct trade of the United States, be­  
tween enemy colonics and Europe, in the  
productions of those colonies. It left the trade  
free between the United States and enemy  
colonies, and between the United States and  
Europe, and of course every other country.  
It left it free also in the direct line, between  
enemy colonies and Africa and Ashp 3y con­  
fining the restriction to Europe, those coun­  
tries were necessarily exempted from its ©­  
peration. The 3d order of the 25th January,  
1798, directed the cruizers to “ bring in all  
vessels laden with cargoes, the produce of a­  
ny island of France, Spain or Holland, and  
coming directly from any port of the said  
islands or settlements to any port in Europe,  
not being a port of Great-Britain, nor of the  
country to which such ships licing neutral  
belonged.” The sole effect of this order  
  
was to extend to the neutral powers of Eu  
rope, the accommodation which had beer  
yielded to the United States by that of 8tli  
January, 1794. The next order bears date  
on the 24th June, 1803. It directs the crui­  
zers not to seize any vessel which shall be  
carrying on trade directly between the colo­  
nies of enemies and tl.j neutral country tc  
which the vessel belongs, and laden with the  
property of inhabitants of suchifeutral coun­  
try ; provided such vessel shall not be supply­  
ing nor have supplied the enemy on the out­  
ward voyage with any articles of contraband  
of war, &amp;c. The sole object of this order  
appears to have been to introduce a new rule  
relative to contraband, by subjecting a vessel  
to seizure on that account, on her return voy­  
age, after depositing her cargo at her place  
of destination. It prohibits the seizure of  
neutral vessels, European as well as Ameri­  
can, engaged in a trade between enemy co­  
lonies and the neutral countries, by positive  
inhibition. That trade had been left free be­  
fore, by the restriction of the seizure to ves­  
sels engaged in the direct trade between en­  
emy colonies and the parent country. It was  
now secured by positive inhibition. The right  
to carry on the trade from the neutral coun­  
try to other countries, wasJeft on the ground  
on which it stood before. That this order  
was not intended to affect that trade, and did  
not affect it, is made sufficiently evident by  
many decisions of the courts of AdmiraltVj  
which have been given since the order was  
issued. In proof of this, I refer to all the ca­  
ses that were decided by the British courts  
of admiralty, touching the trade of neutrals  
with enemy colonies in the years 1805 and 6,  
and more especially to that of the William  
Trefrey, it being the lastone and containing  
a summary of the whole doctrine.  
  
If we recur to the decisions of the courts  
themselves, we shall find a full confirmation  
of what is here advanced. We shall find that  
in conforming their decisions to the spirit of  
the orders of the government, they inhibit  
the direct trade only between the colony Sc  
the parent country, or some other country  
of Europe: that they do not call in question  
the trade between neutral powers in the pro­  
ductions of pnemv colonies, after those pro­  
ductions were allowed to have been incor­  
porated into the stock of the country : that  
they gave recent and high offenfce only by  
the new doctrines advanced, on this latter  
point, which, by assuming to investigate  
the motives of the parties engaged in the  
trade, and to reject acts which were before  
deemed satisfactory by decisions the most  
solemn, and to impose new conditions the  
most onerous and oppressive, laid*that com­  
merce completely at the mercy of British  
tribunals. The most material cases are  
those of the Immanuel, which involved the  
question of a trade between Bourdeaux and  
St. Domingo, that is, the direct trade be­  
tween the Parent country and its colony, in  
which the goods were condemned on that  
accuusst. Room. Rep. id vqi. page ioc. And of  
Polly, Lasky,in which the vessel was taken  
on a voyage from Marblehead to Spain,  
charged with the productions of the Havan­  
na, brought to Marblehead by the same ves­  
sel. In this case the question of continuity  
of voyage was involved, and the court  
decided in favor of the American claim, on  
ground that gave no offence. It was admit­  
ted in explicit terms by the judge, that an  
American had a right to import the produce  
of the Spanish colonies into his own country,  
and to carry them on thence to the general  
commerce of Europe, and that the landing  
of the Cargo and payment of the duties would  
be sufficient criteria of a bona fide importa­  
tion. 2d Rob. Rep. page 361. The next  
cases were those of the Essex, Orne, of the  
Rowhena, and some others of the same  
kind, in 1805, which turned on the point of  
continuity of voyage, in which the court,  
pursuing its doctrine to the unjust and p rni-!  
ciour extent complained of, produced the  
controversy which took place between the  
countries.  
  
The communication between Mr. King  
and lord Hawksbury is of the same charac­  
ter. The advocate-general admits in his  
report, which was adopted by lord Hawkcs­  
bury, and communicated by him to Mr. King  
that by the relaxation of the general princi­  
plejrespectingthe trade with enemy-colonies,  
it was distinctly understood, and had been  
repeatedly so decided by the court of appeal  
that the produce of enemy colonies might  
be imported into the neutral country, and re­  
exported thence ex&lt;en to the mother country  
of such colony ; and in like manner that the  
produce and manufactures of the mother  
country might be carried to its colonies.—  
He states that the direct trade between the  
mother country and its colonies had not been  
recognized as legal : that what amounted to  
an intermediate importation/mto the neutral  
country, might sometimes be a question of dif­  
ficulty ; that the mere touching in the neu­  
tral country to take fresh clearances, might  
perhaps be deemed evasive, and in effect the  
direct trade ; but that the high court of ad­  
miralty had expressly decided (and he saw  
no reason to expect that the court of ap­  
peal would vary the rules) that landing the  
goods &amp; paying the duties in the neutral coun­  
try would break the continuity of the voy­  
age, &amp; was such au importation as would le­  
galize the trade, although the goods were re­  
shipped in the same vessel, on account of  
the same proprietors, and were forwarded  
for sale to the mother country of the colo­  
ny.  
&#x27;I his communication corresponds in every  
the minutest circumstance with the spirit ,  
of the orders and dicisions of the courts as i  
above explained. It insists, and in terms  
that arc far from being positive, that the di­  
rect trade only between the mother country \
and the colony, was inhibited. It admits &#x27;  
that the trade through the neutral country !  
to the mother country of the colony was &#x27;  
lawful, and fixes, with great precision, the j  
acts to lie performed in the neutral Country &#x27;  
which would be sufficient to incorporate;  
the goods into the stock of the country, and  
break the continuity of the voyage. In the &#x27;  
latter part of the report alluded to, the ,  
advocate-general seems to make a kind of  
reservation of the right of the cour» of ap­  
peal, to revise the dec’sions of the high  
court of admiralty, which he represents to  
have settled the doctrine. But he makes  
that reservation, if indeed it was intended  
as one, in such terms as to preclude the i­  
  
■ Idea, that it would evei1 l&gt;e taken advantage  
of, especially when it is considered, that  
the report was adopted by the government,  
and communicated officially, by the secretary  
of state, to u foreign minister. It is Certain,  
however,, that through the court of appeal,  
the new encroachment on the rights ot :he  
United States was made, which produced  
the controversy which ensued immediately  
afterwards.  
The discussion which took place between  
lord Mulgrave and myself in 1805, on the  
subject of the seizures then made, treated  
the encroachment in that line as the special  
cause of complaint on the part of the United  
States. Although the British pretension to  
inhibit even the direct trade, had not been  
countenanced bv the government, vet the  
commerce of the U. States had been made in  
a certain degree to accommodate with it bv  
the merchants. They were content to de­  
cline the direct trade, and to prosecute their  
enterprizes through the U. States, equal­  
ly with the mother country and its colonies.  
It was natural, in the course of a contro­  
versy which involved such important inter­  
ests, that the rights nf the parties should be  
taken up on principle, aud canned to the  
greatest extent. To the light thrown on tiie  
subject by a very able essay,&#x27; which I rcceii -  
ed from you, I was much indebted, and I ac­  
knowledge in this communication, tot: aid  
which it afforded me, with peculiar satisfac­  
tion. A vindication, however, of the cause  
on principle, however extensive the range  
might be, Could not affect the origin of the  
controversy, nor give to the articl* entered  
into for its adjustment a construction differ­  
ent from that which by well established rules  
is fairly applicable to it.  
  
X I 1)111 LI 1 IN View Of  
Lite several oraers or  
the British government, ami.from the expo­  
sition given of them by the courts, anil b&gt;  
the government itself, it appears that the  
sole object of thdse that were issued after  
that of the 6th November, 1793, was to in­  
hibit the direct trade of the U. States bej  
tween enemy colonies and Enrope ; that they  
did not touch, and were not intended to in­  
terfere with the trade between the 17. States  
and K.urnne fvn» »lw. n-i^nt .... .  
- . - -- |.. »-&#x27;»....nv, .I.IU.V  
fortiori between the United States and Asia  
and Africa. It was, indeed, the object of the  
order of November 6th, 179 !, t,&gt; suppress  
the commerce of neutral powers with tne.nv  
colonies altogether; but that being abandon­  
ed, the next idea which occurred wastoem-*  
barrass that trade by forcing it through neu­  
tral countries. Here, then, arose a ne w qut  
tion, which turned entirely on another prin­  
ciple. That a neutral power had a right to  
carry on trade from its own ports, in aar  
articles, though of foreign produce, which  
had been incorporated into the stack, of the  
country not contraband of war, and to ail  
countries, was not controverted. Tint point,  
otherwise clear and indisputable in itself, b ,d  
been long settled in the highest tribunals,  
ami uy tnc most eminent jurists in England.  
The Circumstances which constituted such  
an incorporation of foreign artic.es into the  
stock of the country, had also been settled  
by the same authorities. Skill tile question  
which now arose, turned on thisl t er point.  
In forcing this commerce through neutral  
ports with a view to embarrass it, it became  
necessary (to give the greatest effect to that  
expedient) to increase the difficulties in those  
ports, which was done in the manor alrea­  
dy stated.  
  
mu msmiu&#x27;ions oi me tir.tish govern*  
nient did not inhibit the trade in q csti&lt;&gt;:&gt;  
the adjustment contained in the article in &#x27;  
del- consideration, could n j? affect it. Tnae  
article supposes a diffci^nce be.ween the  
parties t dative to trade with cncmv Colonies,  
and the instruction? whicn interfere with it!  
The article could not operate in any trade to  
which the instructions did not extend, and  
concerning which there was no controverst  
In the present case the conclusion is tho  
more it resistable, because there did not ex­  
ist even a possibility of controversy in re ard  
to that trade.  
But it is inferred, that because it is stipu­  
lated, that the produce ot enemy colonies  
may be carried to Europe from the Lh S a‘ie -  
that the ports of Asia and Africa nr*- wi,,.»  
on them, and that because it is stipulated that  
the manufactures of Europe may be carried  
from the U. States to the Wo t ladies, tli.it  
those of Asia and Africa are prohibited from  
being carried there. This objection ha.-, been  
already obviated. Had the instructions of  
die British government inhibited that trade  
and a controversy between the gm eminent*  
arisen from the inhibition, as the ardc. e does  
not extend to the case, the most that could  
have been inferred would have been that it  
was unprovided for, and that the rights of  
the parties would remain in the saim- sU»*  
respecting it, as if the article had not been  
entered into. It iseasy to txplaintho cause  
why the term ••Europe” was introduced in  
to the article, in reference to the ports,  
which colony produce might be Carried, a.-. i  
“ European” in reference to the manufac­  
tures which might be carried to envoi v colo­  
nies, and to shew that they were adopted!  
with a view to o|ien on the widest scale the  
ports which had been at any time shot on  
them by the British orders. Although rfre  
policy of these orders as well as of the prin­  
ciple on which they are founded, is more  
particularly applicable to the direct trade  
between enemy colonies, and tlfeir mother  
country, yet as the term •• Eurojic” bad been  
adopted in the modifications that were made  
in them, first at the instance of the V. States,  
and afterwards at that of the neutral Euro­  
pean powers, as the widest si ale within  
which the inhibition operated, it was thought  
best to use that term to prevent the possibi­  
lity of mistake, as to the extent of the ad­  
justment. Had terms of more extensive im­  
port been adopted, they could trot have b m  
more effectual to the object, while they migJr  
liav-e tended to enlarge the sphere of British  
pretension, by extending if. to cases to which  
it would be highly improper to give a saned­  
But it is supposed that although the orders  
of the British government may not hue  
inhibited this trade, it is Comprised in the*  
general inhibition of tire British principle.  
If the British principle inhibits such i crui-,  
which I do not admit, it does not .allow that

trade, the right* of the parties cannot  
affected by it. They remain equally in  
trjrcc the principle, us -against the  
instructions, lmtl they inhibited&#x27;it. Hut the  
claim to an exemption front that trade-from  
&#x27;the operation oi tite British principle, vests  
on still stronger ground. admitting that it e­  
ver extended to it, which however 1 am far  
from admitting. It can he shew n that the  
orders themselves, take it complete v from  
within tite scope of that principle. By in­  
structing the cruir.ers to scire vessels enga­  
ge i in a particular trade, every other trade  
is allowed. It is in that untie, that what is  
called a relaxation of the British principle,  
•is effected. The order reduces the princi­  
~p!e to its own standard, or in ether words,  
becomes the principle itself. If this doc­  
trine is not true, it is impossible to designate  
in what mode the relaxation, which is uni­  
versally admitted, of the British principle, is  
w rought; or tetprove that there has been any  
relaxation of it whatever. If the orders have  
not that effect, of what avail are thev ? That  
they have that effect is proved by the deci­  
sions of the courts, and the practice under  
them. I am aware of the broad doctrine  
held by the courts on this subject, but that  
doctrine, necessarily ambiguous from the  
dilemma in which the courts were placed bv  
t)»c inconsistent orders of the government,  
if not reconcileable to this construction (as 1  
think it is, when the whole subject is taken  
into view) is contradicted by the decisions  
ofthe.samc courts and the explanations of  
the government itself.  
  
i say tnat mis trauc isr.ot inhibited by Ihe  
British principle, because it supposes a  
trade between enemy colonies and the mo­  
ther country. But a trade between the Uni­  
ted States and Asia or Africa, let the sub­  
ject of it be what it may, is not a trade of  
that kind. It is a trade with independent pow­  
ers at peace with Great-Britain with whom,  
wc have a right to trade, by all the rules  
which Great-Britain has at any time insist­  
ed on. It would be of dangerous tendency  
to admit that Great-Britain had a pretensi­  
on to interfere with such a trade in any  
case. After the goods are received into the  
United States, no matter of what articles  
they consist, or from what quarter they Came,  
they arc the property ot the country, and  
may of right be shipped to any other coun­  
try. The British principle does not contro­  
vert this docti inc. It asserts in its widest  
range the right only to seize them on their  
route to the neutral country, and from it  
to&#x27;lie mother Country of the colony, or some  
other enemy country of Europe, provided  
they be not incorporated into the stock of  
the neutral country. If they are, they may  
go under the arrangement made to the coun­  
tries to which the British principle applies.  
But they require no sanction from the Bri­  
tish government, to go to those to which it j  
docs not apply. The destination of the ves- j  
scl alone •would, as I presume, dispel everv  
doubt of the legality of the trade, and pre­  
clude all farther inquiry concerning it.—  
The question of continuity of voyage could  
never arise in such a case, it is certain  
that the arrangement alluded to gives no  
sanction to it, and for the best of all reasons,  
that the trade was not admitted, or even con­  
tended to be comprised within the range of  
British principle.  
I shall close my remarks on this point by­  
observing, that as the arrangement of the  
acts to break the continuity of the voyage  
from the United States to the parent coun­  
try, and other enemy countries of Europe,  
in the produce of their colonies, and from 1  
the United States to those colonies, in the j  
manufactures oi Europe, is confined strictly ;  
to that object, the rights of the parties re- &#x27;  
main unimpaired in every other circum- i  
stance relative to that trade : that as the ar- i  
*ic!p rnntviiiw no stipulation against tin* Hi- :  
rcct trade from the colony to the parent !  
country, the right to carry on even that !  
trade is not necessarily suspended by it :— !  
that if in any view it can he considered as  
suspendcd.it is by implication arising out of j  
the whole transaction, rather than tro:n the  
stipulation itself. How much stronger then  
is the conclusion already drawn from other  
premises, that nothing is to be deduced from  
that article to justify the construction which  
has been imputed to it !  
  
The remarks above made, refef more par­  
ticularly toa trade between the United States  
»J»d Europe in the produce of enemy colo­  
nies. They are however equally applicable  
to the other objection stated in your letter, j  
of a trade between the United States and cn- ;  
emy colonies, in the produce or manufac- !  
tures of Africa or Asia. None of the or- I  
ders alluded to, inhibit that commerce, and ’  
it is most certain that the article alluded to, i  
gives no sanction to such a pretension.  
As to the conditions by which it is agreed 1  
to break the continuity of the voyage, 1 have  
to observe, that they arc as favorable as you  
had expected. We were authorized to sti­  
pulate, if better conditions could not be ob­  
tained, that the goods should be landed, the  
efiifir* paid and the ship changed. We sti­  
pulated, only that the goods should be landed &#x27;  
and the duty paid, making the duty on Euro- j  
pean goods 1 per rent and on colony pro- I  
ductions two. By exempting the party from j  
the necessity of changing the ship, an iin*  
portant advantage was certainly secured, j  
By fixing the duty at 1 per cent, in the one j  
Instance, and at 2 in the other, it was not pos- •  
Bible that the slightest embarrassment should  
be thrown in the wav of the trade. Thedu-j  
tv payable on manufactures consumed in the •  
country&#x27; is alxiut 15 per cent, nntl on West­  
India productions 25. The trifling amount  
made payable to the country on the re-ex­  
portation of the articles, could not be felt by i  
the merchant. It would fall on the European &#x27;  
consumer. It could not be felt as a heavy  
imposition on the trade itself. Our only com­  
petitor in it, would be Great-Britain, whose  
merchants would labor under the disadvan­  
tages incident to war, in a thousand shapes,  
more especially ns the ports of dve whole con­  
tinent would he vhnt on them, in not being a­  
lde toget their goods into those jwirts, other­  
wise than by smuggling them : a mode which  
could not fail to be onerous, if it. succeeded,  
but which was likely to fail in most cases.  
It should be remembered also, that the en­  
c.reused duties which would accrue to the i  
country, would tend, in the degree, to into- |  
rest the whole cen.tnunity in support of a j  
Commerce, in which the commercial pan !  
was most materially interested.. It is the i  
policy of the European powers having n&gt;- j  
Jojiies in the W#-st-Indies, to make the  
parent country the entrt pot of th* producti­  
ons of its colonies. Is not that policy worthy  
the attention and Imitation of the United  
States, in respect to the trade of the r domes •  
in question? The duty received, would make !  
nornc reco up rise to the natitti fr.r the cx-|  
penses Incurred a ad sums expended, in sup-j  
j* rthijr our right to that trade. Besides, bv !  
making tile por s of the I nited Slates the!  
“•outripo; s for such pr » tactions, the coun­  
  
ti*v ;n general would derive some ndcnrttnge  
from the measure. K*cry ship engaged in  
the commerce aVliich entered xn American  
port, would bring something to, and take  
something from it. The vast amount of A­  
siatic, Kuroitexn and- West-India aruiJca  
brought to our markets, would cheapen tile  
pnre of those articles at home, Breach ship,  
while in port, and in the prosecution of her  
voyage, would require supplies in provision  
and dtlicr articles, which .would raise the  
price oi those articles, to the great advan­  
tage of the general interests of the country.  
I&#x27;he limitation of the article to the term  
specified, was a&#x27; condition wlJch vve presu­  
med might prove advantageous to the United  
States, while it could r.ot possibly injure  
them. It is expressly stipulated that the  
right of both parties,shall revive at the ex­  
piration of the term. Those of the United  
States, therefore, would then be in force, and  
to the lull extent 6f their pretetttions, in the  
same manner as if the stipulation had not  
been entered into. In another war they might  
insist on conditions which this stipulation did  
not secure, sfi.d, rf Great-Britain did not yield  
to their demand, they might resort to any ex­  
pedient, to compel her, which the wisdom of  
their councils might dictate. Any encroach­  
ment on the part of Great-Britain on their  
rights, as heretofore contended for, might ne  
Considered by their government an .act of hos­  
tility, and treated accordingly. The least  
iavorablc conditions that sue could offer,  
would be those already settled, which the U­  
111 ted States might accept or reject, as tliev  
thought best. As a youthful, prosperous, and  
rising nation, it c&#x27;ould not be’doubted that  
in the next Avar their situation would be  
more imposing than in the DVcscnt one. &#x27;I&#x27;he  
  
presumption is, that they would be able then  
to obtain better conditions than at present.  
On the third&#x27;article 1 have toobserve, &#x27;in  
addition to what is stated in our joint let­  
ter of January 3, 1807, that nothing would  
have been more easy than to have omitted  
any provision on the subject of it, and to have  
placed that trade on the footing of the most  
favored nation. To obtain better terms by  
treaty was utterly impossible. We were  
much inclined to omit any provision on the  
subject, because we were aware that the ar­  
rangement made would fall short of the ex­  
pectation of our government and country, Sc  
most probably subject us to censure. We  
acceded to that arrangement from a convic­  
tion that it secured us better terms than we  
should be likely to enjoy, if left to depend on  
the pleasure of the British government, sti­  
mulated as we knew that was to restrict us  
in it by the Indict Cojiiptiny, orwi otltcr intc­  
rests of the country. It is impossible to con­  
ceive too high an idea of the jealousy which  
is enterained of the United States, in a com­  
mercial view, by that government, and of the  
danger with which it thinks Great Britain  
is menaced by their Extraordinary prosperi­  
ty and rapid, growth. The boldness of the  
projects, and the activity and ability with  
which they are prosecuted by our merchants  
and mariners, excite the admiration of Eu­  
rope. Great-Britain has seen, that wherever  
out citizens gained a foot-h6ld, they never lost  
it. Without distrusting her own means, or the  
hardiness and activity of her people, she  
finds that our position, remote from Europe,  
contiguous to the West Indies a.idthe south­  
ern continent, and as near to India as herself,  
gives us advantages, against which she cannot  
cope. The effort which we made and perse­  
vered in for several months to gain admissi­  
on into British India, on more favorable tends  
and the disposition which was shewn by the  
British commissioners to yield, excited a sen­  
sation, or more properly speaking, an alarm  
in the board of India directors, and of the  
commercial people in general, even among  
those who had no particular interest in the  
question, which was extremely obvious. Had

our admittance into India, on certain condi­  
tions, we had much reason to believe that  
that commerce would have been fettered to  
an extreme degree, and in every form.  
  
caliciuciv uiiAiuub \.ij provide  
that our citizens might make their ship­  
ments from Europe, to take specie from  
Spain and Portugal, goods from England,  
£cc. and that that they might touch at the  
Cape of Good Hope, at the isle of Bourbon,  
at the Mauritius, £cc. that they might carry  
on the coasting trade in India, and be permit­  
ted to pass from Calcutta to China. These  
advantages wercinsistcd on, but the pres­  
sure which we made produced reports from  
the board of directors, at the instance of the  
government, and from political men conver­  
sant in these topics, which fixed the govern­  
ment in its decision not to grant them. I re­  
peat, however, that it would have been ea­  
sy to have omitted the regulation from the  
ireaty, and placed the trade on the footing  
of the most favored nation, as it would have  
been at any time afterwards,had the state of  
affairs in other respects permitted it.  
By your instructions, a provision in favor  
of indemnity was not made an indispcnsiblc  
condition of a treaty. Wc were authorized  
to conclude one without it. We were, there­  
rSiimiCu  
interest was placed, could not fail to be ap­  
proved. The arrangement which we made  
autimi i/.tu h just Claim tuex]icctn dismissi­  
on of all the causes that were depending in  
the courts of admiralty, and even to indem­  
nity in the cases of condemnation. The do­  
cuments which wc forwarded to you in our  
joint Icttet* of give a full view of  
this subject, and to them I beg to refer.  
Your fifth objection applies to the 13th and  
39th articles of the treaty, aitd in the first in­  
stance to the prohibition it contains, of ex­  
tending the priviledges which are made re­  
ciprocal between the parties, to other nati­  
ons,which ift supposed to he a breach of neu­  
trality. Had I conceived that those articles  
were justly exposed to that imputation, I  
should certainly not have assented to them.  
But I saw no foundation forth” imputation.—*•  
With Spain and Holland we have treaties  
which secure them all the rights to which  
they are entitled. It is usual, and certainly  
proper, for a nation in estimating its claims  
on other powers, to examine its treaties with  
them, and not to think of settingup a preten­  
sion beyond the ’imit of such treaties. By  
treaty, neither of titese powershav e «nv right  
in tiie Case in question, nor have we in the  
ports of either. By treaty, (ireat-Britain  
had enio; ed those rights in the ports of the  
1 nited States, as we had in her ports from  
the year 1704. Spain nmi MoPand knew the  
conditions of that treaty, which was in forte  
at th? commenct ine nt of the pi c sent war,  
nod sometime afterwards, and would have  
been in force till late in the last year, had a  
special condition r.f the 12th artir.V been &lt;-»r­  
ned intorffect. To renew the treaty in the  
expre- i terms of the former one, a treaty  
which deprived no one power&#x27;f am &lt; xisiing  
conventional right; which subjected n me to  
rand-lions to which thev had not been always  
subjer ted ; winch allowed to G. e it-llritain,  
on principles oi r&lt; eipr.vtity, a privilege which  
tliore war. no reason to presume that aiij o­  
  
thcr pv.rrr-&lt;r$|!cdaHy  
to&#x27;rcciprocate With the United States, did not  
seem to be liable to the objection stated toit.  
I 1 he general principle which you advance,  
jof extendirfg those privi ledges to ns small a  
number of powers as possible, had also softie  
j weight in inducing-u&gt; to acceue to the ar­  
rangement. France is admitted to an enjoy­  
ment of them, in tl|&lt;: same extent with Greftt­  
Britain. She, there four, has no cause of  
complaint. I do not think that the stipulati­  
on forbids any arrangement of the govern­  
ment, relative to the number bf ships bf war,  
that shall be admitted into the ports of,the  
United States at one .time, or any regulation  
i relative to their conduct while within the  
! ports ol the United States, provided it be ge­  
neral and equally applicable to both powers.  
A stipulation that the ships of war of each  
nation shall be hospitably received into the  
ports of the other, does not necessarily im­  
ply that there is to be no rule as to the num­  
bers to lie admitted ir.to the ports to which  
they shall lie confined, or the orderthey shall  
observe while in port. All these&#x27; topics have  
been at all limes, as I hive reason to believe,  
the objcct-of regulation by Great-Britain, &amp;  
I have equal reason to believe that her go­  
vernment did not consider itself as having  
abandoned its right to regulate thcih by this  
article.  
  
» our next oojecuon nppues.*o tne last pa­  
ragraph of the IDth, taken in connection with  
the 12th article. By your construction of  
those parts of the treaty, the United States  
would he bound to claim redress in favor of  
Great-Britain of her enemies, for any acts  
of hostility which they might commit on her  
ships of war or merchant vessels, within the  
additional limit, while she might commit,  
with impunity, iike acts of hostility on the  
ships of war and.,met chant vessels of her  
&#x27;cncmlfs in ca«e they did not acknowledge it,  
hnd against their ships of war in case they  
did, although her own ships of war in both  
cases would be protected within it. I was  
decidedly of opinion, and still am, that whilfe  
those articles secure tp the United States an  
unconditional advantage, none whatever is  
stipulated by them in favor of Grcat-Britain,  
which must rot of necessity be common to  
her enemies ; that her privilege, on the con­  
trary. whatever it may he. must be founded  
on their conScit, follow, and terminate with  
it.  
The 12th ardcle stipulates that Grcat-Bri­  
tain shall not itop the vessels of the United  
States within fve marine miles of their coast,  
except for the purpose of examining whe­  
ther they be American, or those of another  
power j and diat she shall not stop the un­  
armed vessel if other powers within the same  
limit, provididthey acknowledge it, except  
to ascertain whether they belong to those  
who have &#x27;acknowledged it. The vessels of  
the powers vho do not adopt the regulation  
are hot affected by It. They femain under  
the ordinary prctccticfc’cf the law of nations,  
which extends to the distance of cannbn shot  
or three miles from the coast. Beyohd that  
limit the &quot;enettiies of Great-Britain have a  
right to search and seize her vessels, with­  
out being hmcrable to the United States, and  
the same right is reserved to her by this ar­  
ticle, as if it tad not been entered into. Ves­  
sels of wah are expressly excluded from the  
advantage of the regulation.  
It is the sole object of the 12th article to  
sechre to the United States an accommoda­  
tion, by extending their jurisdiction on their  
coast, in what concerns themselves, from  
three to five miles. The stipulation is un­  
conditional as to them, but conditional as to  
other powers, dependent on their acknowled  
ging the same limit. It is made reciprocal  
by being extended to the British dominions,  
northward of the United States; a circum­  
stance which merit&#x27;s attention, as it precludes  
the idea that Any other equivalent Was ex­  
Ol* fA hit* tvitrpn ?f Tf  
would have been extended to the dominions  
of Great-Britain, in Europe and elsewhere,  
had the British commissioners desired it.—  
They declined it, from a fear that it might  
produce some innovation in the general doc­  
trine of the law of nations on the subject.—  
This is, I think, fairly to be inferred from the  
  
The last paragraph of the 19th article, sti­  
pulates that neither of the parties shall per­  
mit the ships or goods belonging to the sub­  
jects or citizens of the other, to be taken with­  
in cannon shot of the coast, nor within the ju­  
risdiction described in article 12th, so long  
as the provisions of the said article shall be  
in force, by the ships of war of other powers  
—but in case it should so happen, the party,  
whose territorial rights shall thus have been  
violated, shall endeavor to obtain front the  
attending party, full and ample satisfacti­  
on for the vessels so taken—whether the  
same be vessels of war or merchant ves­  
sels.  
If any advantage is given to Great-Bri­  
tain by the arrangement proposed by the  
12th article, and this clause of the 19th, to  
the prejudice of her enemies, or of the Uni­  
ted States, it must be by this clause. She  
can certainly claim none Under the 12th ar­  
ticle. This clause Ci&#x27;iisisis of two distinct  
members, of very different import. The  
first contains a general stipulation, conform­  
able to the iaw of nations, applicable to ail  
the dominions of both parties, and equally so  
to their ships of war and merchant Vessels.  
W ith respect to the latter, however, it is  
Conditional. The second member applies to  
the arrangement made in the 12th article, St  
in the sense and spirit of that article. If the  
12th article is carried into effect in favor of  
other powers, which can only be done by  
their consent, then the advantage which is  
secured to them by it, will accrue likewise  
toCJreat-Britain. What is that advantage?  
Protection to their merchant vessels within  
th« additional two miles, and -nothing else.  
It is obvious, that the protection which is sti­  
pulated in favor of ships of war is provided  
for, by the first member of the clause, and not  
by the second. It cannot be by both, for the  
distance defined by them is different, it be­  
ing three miles in one, and five in the other.  
It is equally obvious, that the stipulation con­  
tained in the second member of the clause,  
relative to the 12di article, is intended to o­  
perate in the spirit of that article, and tobe  
made dependent on it. lly the terms “ nor  
within the jurisdiction described in article  
J2th, so long as the provisions of the said ar­  
ticle shall he in force,” the stipulation con­  
templated is made conditional. In force, in  
respect to whom ? Not to the United States,  
bet aine It was Unconditional as to them. It  
was conditional only With respect to other  
jmwers. Other reasons might be given m  
shew that the arrangement under Considera­  
tion is not liable to the objection made to it,  
but l presume that those stated will be sa­  
tisfactory.  
The difficulty to obtain the accommodati­  
on which was yielded to tire 12th article wa.,  
efcti’eme. We laboured most earnestly toex­  
tcn.l it to miter powers, without thoir consm­  
in* to reciprocate it In f-tvnr of Great-Bri­  
tarn ; b it till&#x27;. Could not be accomplished.—  
  
The British commissioners urged thsit as d*  
Brituin predominated at sea, uiul must lose  
l»y the concession in any form, it would be un­  
just for her to make, the concession in their  
favor, unless they would allow her the ad­  
vnntnjjft of j&gt;, Finding that it was jnsnossi­  
hle to extend the additional limit to ‘other  
powers, on other terms, we thought it advi­  
sable to adopt The Arrangement in respect to  
them conditionally, putting it in their power  
to accept or reject it, as they thought fit.  
We flattered ourselves that as they could not  
lose hv it, they would not refuse their assent  
to an arrangement by which they might gain,  
especially as it would prove advantageous to  
a friendly power. We deemed it highly im­  
portant to establish the additional limit in  
favor of the United States, from the advan­  
tage it might afford to their commerce with­  
in It, and from the effect which the measure  
seemed likely to produce on the future con­  
duct of the British squadrons on our coast,  
by whom it could not fail to be considered as  
a severe censure on the past.  
Ifreadily admitted what more suitable  
terms might have been &#x27;hdopted to accom­  
plish the object in view. But it ought to he  
recollected, that as the right of jurisdiction  
imposes of necessity, the obligation of protec­  
tion, without a special exception to it, there  
was some difficulty in making an arrange­  
ment which should secure to the United  
States the advantage which they desired. Sc  
at the same tifne exempt them from the duty  
incident to it.  
  
i o ) our nth objection, little need be&#x27;addcd  
to what is stated on the subject of it, in our  
letter of January 3d, 1307. As the paper of  
the British commissioners to which it relates,  
had no sanction whatever from us, as was  
fully shewn by that letter, the objection can­  
not lie said to apply to any part of our con­  
duct. The paper was produced by the de­  
cree of the emperor of France, of the 21st  
November, 1&gt;G6, and was intended by the  
British commissioners, to operate as a reser­  
vation ot right, in their government, not to  
ratify the treaty, or not to be precluded, un­  
der certain circumstances, in case it did ra­  
tify it, from adopting such measures, as it  
might find necessary, to counteract the re­  
strictions imposed by that decree. The ex­  
^rricp of the rirrht  
*,**w “b‘*w * » *cU WmS iliSttC uc­  
pendent on the abandonment of the princi­  
ple of that decree by the French govern­  
ment, or an assurance from the government  
of the United States, or such conduct as  
would be equivalent, that the pretension  
would not be submitted to by it. We ap­  
prised the British commissioners that «&gt;ur  
government would enter into no engagement  
whatever, of what it could do, in any case  
with another power. Had the treaty been  
ratified, even without any notice being ta­  
ken of that paper, it could not have imposed  
the slightest obligation on the United States,  
either to perform any act on their part, or to  
submit to any, on the pull of Great-Britain. j  
I had supposed, however, in the case of ra­  
tification, that we should have been instruct- i  
ed tb present to the British government, with  
the instrument of ratification, a counter-de-I  
clavation to that effect. The whole subject  
was before pur government, with our strong  
and decided .objection to the paper. All :  
that we could do was to transmit it to you, i  
with a correct statement of what had occur- i  
red in the negotiation respecting it, which  
we did. To the government it belonged to  
take the step which the occasion required,  
not to us.  
Having noticed thte objection V:hich are es­  
pecially stated in your letter of May 20,  
1807, and given our view of the several parts  
of the treaty to which they relate, I shall  
proceed to make explanatory remarks on  
the other articles, in order to do justice to  
the conduct of the American commissioners  
ih regard to them.  
AliTICLE c Va.. u  
is an essential improvement of that on the  
same snbject in the treaty of 1794. It cer­  
tainly improves it in two important interests ;  
1st, in that of the navigation of the U • States,  
and 2d* in that of the duties on American  
productions carried to the British market.  
The tonnage on American ships in British  
ports had been raised to sterling  
  
per ion, wmie that on British ships in the  
ports of the United States was only 50 cents,  
or 2s. 3d. per ton; and the duty on the bul­  
ky productions of the United states, in Ame­  
rican bottoms, had been raicscd to such a  
height, under the countervailing regulations  
which the treaty allowed, as to secure, in  
time of peace, the entire carriage of those  
productions to British vessels, it indeed, it  
did not materially affect the price of the ar­  
ticles themselves. What made it more un­  
fortunate was, that the United States could  
not adopt any measure to remedy those evils  
without committing a direct and palpable vi- j  
olation of the treaty, as they were bound by  
it not to raise the existing duties higher than  
they were at the time the treaty was  
concluded. Those evils would, however,&#x27;  
have been completely done away by this ar­  
ticle. By it the United States would have  
had a right to raise the duty on British  
vessels to any height to which the British go­  
vernment might raise it on theirs, a check  
which could not fail to prove adequate to the  
object, while tncy had also a right to give  
what preference they thought fit to their own  
vessels, which might be done by reducing  
the duty on them below the tonnage which  
was imposed on those of Great Britain_1  
This arrangement secured to the U. States  
an advantage which Great Britain could not  
countervail, as the necessity she is under to  
avail herself of every resource which she  
can command to raise revenue for indispen­  
sible purposes, renders it impossible for her  
to make a like discrimination in favor of her  
own vessels. The inhibition ofall discrimina­  
ting duties, on the productions of one, and  
manufactures of the other party, whether  
they be carried in American or British but*  
toms, was a stipulation which it was presum­  
ed would also prove highly advantageous to  
the U. States. The pernicious tendency of,  
that principle was well known toyou, and wc  
were happy to be able to suppress it.  
The objections which you urge to other  
parts of the article, apply to clauses in the  
treaty of T794, which it was impossible for  
us to change. 1 have, however, to observe  
that there is nothing in it to prevent the pas­  
sage of a navigation act, provided it be adopt­  
ed as a measure of general policy. .Most of  
the nations of Europe, especially France,  
would be happy in a general view, to see.  
the U. States resort to that c&gt;:| c lient to  
counteract the rcstrictiv • system of England ;  
and as it is one which could not essentially  
affect them, they could find no motive of that  
kind, to inspire a wish to oppose it, nor could  
the United States, as 1 supposed, find one to  
exempt them from it.  
VV&#x27;c regretted that wc could not obtain a  
stipulation which should compel Great-Bri­  
tain to repeal the laws which impose so high  
a duty on her manufactures, when exported  
to the United States. Our letter &gt;hewed  
that wc did every thing in our power to ob­  
  
persuaded, that The want of it woflld hot C\­  
pcrsnadeu, that&quot;. ..  
pose us to all the evils which yo»j&#x27;seWp to ap­  
prehend from it, admitting that theBritish  
* instruction of that clause in the former trea­  
.”■&quot;*** ,a sousuS one, a ini iuat nothing is con­  
tained in the 23d article of the present one  
to discountenance . it. It is certain that no  
government will ever tax exports higher than  
uulispensible necessity compels it, because  
such a tax tends in all cases essentially to  
check industry, and to destroy the most pro­  
ductive source of national prosperity. The  
inhibition imposed by the constitution of  
the United States on the congress, to tax,in  
the slightest degree/their exports, affords a  
strong argument, drawn from the acknow­  
ledged wisdom of its framers, against th*  
policy of such a tax, in the abstract; and I  
ain persuaded that tile reasons against it  
arc as strong with Great-Britain, if hoi  
stronger, than with any other nation. With­  
out taking a more comprehensive view of  
the subject, it is sufficient to observe, that a  
tax on British exports must operate as a  
bounty m favor of American manufactures  
which are already in an advanced state, iu  
certain parts of the union. G. Britain must  
be sensible of this fact, and aware of the en­  
couragement whirfi the present export duty­  
gives tuem, and of the consequences atten­  
ding it. I should presume that there was not  
much cause to apprehend, that she would  
tax the export of her manufactures to the  
United States, to prevent their being sent  
thence to other countries. The sole effect •  
of such a tax would be to secure to her own.  
vessels the carriage of the articles, if indeed,  
that were attainable. In both cases the  
manufactures of Great-Britain would be tlu^  
subject of the eommercc. The supply of the  
great, the productive aiid cncreasing mar­  
kets of thfc United States, must be a pri­  
mary object of British policy, and Great-.  
Britain would doubtless be cautious not to  
hazard it for one comparatively of much,  
less importance. *  
  
A r TI c i. f. 6. As this article was approved,  
I shall only observe, that I considered the  
reservation contained in it important, as it  
enabled the United States to counteract the  
British policy, in respect to the trade with.  
tue »’*•«■ bodies, which is the object of it,  
by means the most efficacious, whenever  
they should lie resorted to. The trade of  
Great-Britain with the United States is car­  
ried on.principally by circuitous voyages, in  
.which her vessels pass from the ports of the  
United States to the West Indies. By sus­  
pending the intercourse between the United  
States and her West Indies, in British ves­  
sels, the chain would be broken, and the  
whole commerce in shell vessels be, in a  
great measure, suspended. The provision  
in the article obviously looks to such an ob­  
ject, and the time of carrying it into effect un­  
less the trade should he placed on satisfao  
tory ground, would have depended altoge­  
ther on the United States.  
Having already noticed the subjects which  
arc embraced by the following articles, I  
shnll hrtf lit Ho on fi p y iKom t/x  
what is said in our joint lett.v of January 3d,  
1807. The 7tli was taken literally from  
tile treaty of 1794. The 8th and9th amen­  
ded, as you allow, the articles in that trea­  
ty on the same subject: The 10th, relative to  
blockade, taken in connection with the Bri­  
tish paper of December 3i, 1805, placed,  
as I presumed that interest on ground which  
would be satisfactory. The preamble can­  
not affect it uhfavorably, as it does not alter  
the acknowledged law. The only effect  
which it could have, would tobte admonish the  
courts to be cautious in admitting evidence  
of notice, on account of the distance of the  
United States from the blockaded ports. It  
was sdpposed to give the United States a  
claim to a more favordble rule in respect to  
cimem-c, lu»n was. aiinjved to powers more  
contiguous to the theatre of action. The  
doctrine contained in Mr. Merry’s note to  
you was not contested by the British commis­  
sioners. It is, on the contrary, maintained  
jn their note to us of December 31st,- 1805,  
in which it is asserted to be notorious “that  
the king did hot declare any ports to be in  
a state of blockade without allotting to that  
object a force sufficient to make the en­  
trance into them manifestly dangerous.” I  
quote the passage in their note to observe  
that t&#x27;.ie doctrine is not made conditional on  
any other part of it. but is laid down as the  
established law. It justifies the additional  
remark that the preamble was not intended  
and cannot be construed to alter the law._  
It follows that it cannot produce any other  
effect than that which is above imputed to  
  
The 13th article relates to the search oc  
merchant vessels, and differs from the 19t!i  
of the treaty of 1794, in the introductory  
sentence, which enjoins iton the command­  
ers of ships ot war &amp; privateers, to observe  
in the course of the war, which may then  
exist, as much as possible the acknowledged  
rules and principles of the law of nations ;  
and also in the penal sum [which it encreas­  
cs] to be given by the commanders of pri­  
vateers before they receive their commissi­  
ons, as a security for. their good conduct un­  
der them. It was supposed that in this as  
in the preceding case, the law remained un-^  
touched, and that the stipulation produced  
no other effect, than to enjoin it on the go­  
vernments respectively, to be particularly  
attentive to the conduct of its officers in the  
respect alluded to.  
I he 13th article and the paper of the Bri­  
tish commissioners of the 3lstof December,  
1805, obviously looked to the Russian con­  
vention as the standard of the acknowledg­  
ed law respecting the search of merchant  
vessels and blockade. That instrument was  
held constantly in view on both sides, in  
every discussion on those subjects, and in­  
deed on every other to which it extends. Sc  
its doctrine admitted, especially in those, to  
he the established law. YVc were extreme­  
ly desirous, and used our best exertions, to  
introduce articles to the same effect, into our  
treaty* hut it was utterly impossible to ac­  
complish it. It must however be allowed  
that if engagements of the kind alluded to,  
especially in regard to blockade, for which  
there was a special document, would not be.  
observed, that it would he useless to stipu­  
late them by treaty  
On the subject of the 17th article, T have  
already made some remarks under another  
head. 1 cannot think that a stipulation t»»  
receive the ships of war of each party hos­  
pitably into the ports of the other, restrains  
them from limiting the number of ships to  
be admitted at onetime, or from designating  
the ports to which they shall be admitted.—  
A stipulation to admit them settles only, as I  
presume, the principle that they shall be ad­  
mitted, and leaves open to arrangement the  
other points connected with it. This opini­  
on is supported by a passage in thc.articic it­  
se’i, as to the ports which secures to vessels  
which might be drivenbv stress oi weather,  
&amp;c. into p &gt;rts not open to ihem in m&lt;\inary

■ven up by the stipulation, there would have  
been no necessity ter that cpnta&#x27;u.cd in this  
passage. The itmtirk is equally applicable  
to the* other case, that of the number to be  
admitted at one time. Asithut must be an  
affair of special and strict regulation, an ex­  
ception which admitted more, b&gt; securing  
rights to them in case they*entered, would ne­  
cessarily defeat the limitation in itself.  
The stipulation which relates tu the good  
treatment of the officers of each party in the  
ports of the other, being reciprocal, contains  
no reflection on one which is not applicable  
to the other; and I will \ enture to affirm that  
it is equally necessary in regard to Great  
Britain as to the United States. It is well  
known in respect to the latter, that the pas­  
sions, which were excited by the revolution,  
did not long survive the struggle; that the  
sword was no sooner sheathed, than the ca­  
lamities of the war were forgotten. The in­  
jured are always the first to forgive. It is,  
however, just to remark that time has essen­  
tially effaced, from the people of both nations,  
the hostile impression which that arduous  
conflict produced.  
The 2Sd article was thought to contain an  
useful stipulation by securing to the United  
States the advantages in navigation and com­  
merce, which Great Britain might after­  
wards grant to any nation. That stipulati­  
on.was obviously founded on the right of the  
most favored nation, and subject of course to  
the conditions incident to it. It amounts to  
this, that if Great Britain should concede a­  
nv accommodation to another power in com­  
merce with her East or West India colonies,  
or any other part of her dominions, gratuit­  
ously, the United States would be entitled to  
it on the same terms ; but if she made such  
accommodation in consideration of certain  
equivalents to be given her in return, that the  
United States would not be entitled to those  
advantages without paying the equivalents  
The doctrine is the same in its application  
to the United States. If they could grant any  
privileges in trade to France or Spain for ad­  
mission into their West India colonies, G.  
Britain would be entitled to the same, pro­  
vided she admitted the United States into  
her islands also, and not otherwise. I could  
not perceive therefore how it was possible  
that the United States should be injured by  
the stipulation contained in this article;  
while it was probable that they might derive  
some advantage from it. It cbuld not res­  
train them from passing a navigation act to  
place them on an equal footing with Great  
Britain, if it was made general or applied on­  
ly to her and the other nations having such  
acts The right to pass such an act was not  
taken awjiy by any other stipulation in the  
treaty, andtherc was nothing in this article

conthiuc to he on the footing of the most fa­  
vored nation. See.” refer to the principles  
established by the preceding articles am!  
not to tne existing laws or regulations of ei­  
therparty. Ifthe latter was the case, it would  
follow, that the tonnage duties, toe discrimina­  
ting duties, #kr. wnijlrl remain as they Were.  
The precceding aatiefes were intended, in  
the points to which they .extended, to esta­  
blish a Standard of equality between the par­  
ties, to which the regulations of each, whe­  
ther they exceeded or fell short of it, should  
be brought. It could not bedpubted that the  
B. export duty was of the first description that  
it violated the principle of the most favored  
nation. The British commissioners admitted  
the fact, and did not pretend to justify it on  
that ground. They urged in its favpr only,  
that the same duty was imposed on exports  
to their own colonics hi America, and that  
if any change was made .in it to satisfy, the  
claim of the United States on the principle  
of the right of the most favored nation, it  
would be to raise it on the goods exported to  
ythcT vOui&#x27;iti ic^ nuliu rcuuLc liuu iiiuac  
to the United States. The principle, howe­  
ver established by this article, being appli­  
cable to that duty, it was to’ be presumed  
that it might fairly be relief on to obtain a  
modification of it, either by reducing the  
duty oh exports to the United States, or rais­  
ing it on those to other nations. There is no­  
thing in tills article to restrain the U. States  
from adopting measures. to counteract the  
British, policy with respect to,the West-In­  
dies. If that object,had.not been secured by  
a special article, from the possibility of being  
affected by flic others, the principle, esta  
blished by the present one, could not have  
affected it, otherwise than beneficially.  
Having replied to your objections to the  
Several articles of the treaty, and the pa­  
pers connected with it, and given our view  
of them, I shall proceed to make some re­  
marks on the whole subject to do justice to  
the conduct of the Amei lean commissioners  
in that transaction.  
In every case which involved a question  
of neutral right, or even of commercial ac­  
commodation, Great-Britain was resolved to  
yield no ground which she could avoid, and  
was evidently prepared to hazard war, r; n  
tiler than yield much. There seemed to he  
no mode of compelling her to yield, that  
ihat of embarking in the war with the oppo­  
site belligerent, on which great question it  
belonged to the national councils to decide.  
&gt;Vc had pressed the claims of the United  
States in the negoti ition, to the utmost li­  
mit that we could go, without provoking tliat  
issue. It is most certain that better terms,  
could not have hetfn obtained at the time we  
signed the treaty, than it C( ntalns.  
  
l ne state ol toe war in Europe suggested  
likewise the propriety of caution on one part.  
Russia was then on the side of England, and  
likely to continue so ; and Austiia, known  
to be in the same interest, was fielding an  
equivocal attitude, and ready to take advan­  
tage of any favorable event that might oc­  
cur. Prussia, lately powerful, had been de­  
feated, but was not absolutely subdued ; her  
king, the ally and friend of Alexander, kept  
the field with him, and made head against  
France. The emperor of France, far remo­  
ved Irom his dominions, was making the  
bold and dangerous experiment, of the effect  
which his absence might produce in the in­  
terior, ami in a situation to be compelled,to  
risk every thing, if pressed by his adversa­  
ry i cm the precarious issue of a single battle,  
f hese were strong reas^ms why we should  
not throw ourselves too decisively into that  
scale.  
1 he situation of the United States, al­  
ways a respectable one, was then less Im­  
posing than if Usually was. li was known  
that they wete not on gt&gt;od terms with Spain,  
and that France was the &lt;t).y of Spain,_  
&#x27;I heir interior too, was disturbed by a con­  
spiracy of doubtful extent anti dangerous  
tendency, the consequences » f which were  
sure to la* greutlyj magnified by nil who  
were unfriendly to our happv system &#x27;if go­  
vernment. I hose circumstances could not  
btil to be taken into view, bv any the most  
friendly administration in England, when  
pressed so m ike eences&#x27;- nns wnic.li it was  
4hr.vdiir.£ to .nAko*. Add tothoe considtfi  
  
ntious, the in^ortant1 one, tWt the British•]  
ministry h:ul become much impaired, in its  
.strength especially in what concerned thy IT.  
S. by the dta’rl&#x27; of a verv eminent and riistin*  
guished statesman, and h-\ l not the power,  
or thought that it had not, to pursue a libe­  
ral policy - towards the United States, and  
that its power was evidently daily diminish­  
ing. . • • • ’  
These, considerations induced us to sign  
the treaty and submit it to the wisdom of  
our government, after obtaining the best  
conditions that it was possible to obtain.—  
\\ c were aware that, in several points, it  
fell short of the just claims of our country_■  
But we were persuaded that such an ar­  
range meat was made of the whole subject  
as justified us in the part which we took_  
In the rejection or adoption of the treaty, I  
felt no personal interest.. Having discharg­  
ed my duty with integrity and zeal, I neither  
wished applause nor dreaded censure. Ha­  
ving the highest confidence in the &#x27;*Visdom,  
the rectitude and putriritism of the adminis­  
tration, I was satisfied that it would pursue  
the course, which, an enlightened view of the  
public interest-, and a just sensibility to the  
national honor,, might dictate.  
Onr letter of Janhary Sd, wfas written in  
haste, and was deficient in many of the cx­  
planatibus Which would otherwise have been  
given of the treaty. I was happy when at  
W ashington to find that you were perfectly  
willing to receive any explanations which I  
might be disposed to give of that transaction;  
ana.to allow them the weight which they  
might deserve. In making this coinmmuni­  
cation I have indu’ged the freedom which  
belonged jo it, in full confidence that it will  
be approved.  
I cannot conclude this letter without add­  
“u musi aiiKui wisn, tfint the adminis­  
tration may succeed in conducting n.,r af­  
fairs with every power, to the happiest re­  
sult. My retirement*which had been long  
desired, and delayed only by the arduous £c  
very important duties in which I \vas enga­  
ged, had become necessary as a relief to my  
mind, after much fatigue, and to the interest  
of my family, which had been neglected and  
j greatly injured by my absence in the public  
service. It is still my desire to cherish re­  
tirement. Should it, however, be our unfor­  
tunate destiny, which I most earnestly hope  
will not be the case, to be involved in for­  
eign war or domestic trouble, and should my  
services be deemed useful. I will not hesi­  
tate, at the desire of the administration, to  
[repair again to the standard of my country.  
I have the honor to be  
With great consideration and esteem,  
Your very obedient servant

that the President disapproved the

enter into no treaty with the British  
h when limited to,

out any lor,  
but with a mutual uitde  
founded on friendly and ii  
cussion:; and explanations ; that ii  
party would entirely

pending its operation till the meet- .  
ing of Congj&#x27;ess, who, being in ses­  
sion, would have an opportunity to  
make due provision for the case ;  
and finally, that if a treaty, which did ,  
not provide for the inte est of impress­

before the receipt* of the letter, we  
should candidly apprize the British  
commissioner ..ns why  
it would no! , and in­  
vite them to enter again on the busi- i  
ness with a view to such a result as  
was desired.  
By this letter the arrangement j  
which we had sanctioned, comprising  
the informal one relative to impress­  
ment, and that by treaty on the e­  
ther topics, was rejected, and in lieu  
of it we were in.Utiered to enter into  
on informal understanding or arrange­  
ment of the whole subject, and as was  
to bo inferred from the fair import of  
the letter, on ihe same conditions, lt  
was the more to be presumed that the  
government was willing to accept, in  
the mode which it proposed, the  
conditions which we might be able to  
obtain in the other, from the consi­  
derations that the latter were under  
its view at the time the instructions!  
were&#x27; given, by the paper of-the Bri-j  
tish commissioners of November Bth, ;  
and our letter of the 11th and the .  
certainty with which it, as well as  
we, must have been impressed, that  
more favorable could not. be expect- j  
■• myself against the  
ii of Living sacrilied the !  
rights of our seamen, I shall be per­  
mitted to ik rive support from ihe  
conduct of the government   
in the same interest. Under that!  
impression, I have to remark, that  
conduct of the govern- I  
ment us furnishing the most ample I  
vindication of that of the American  
comi ■• The government was j  
■• to enter into some art  
■ inch should preserve;!  
ihcp- &#x27;he country, although  
■ mplish the object | ;  
which had been so ardently desired.  
The only difference between the plan &#x27; &#x27;  
whic&#x27; .. tioned, Sc that which it .  
Was that the whole arra  
lid be informal. Had the ad- i i  
.tral ion resorted to war as a pre- &#x27;  
fcrable alternative, or been&quot; willing to •  
leave the ■ unsettled, its poli- . &gt;  
ey and example might have been t  
plead arainsi; us ; but in pffering I  
to act same conditions in an &#x27;  
informal mode, and to withdraw, in | :  
some form, the non-importation law , &lt;  
as a motive to it, it shewed that the : i  
considerations which had been re- &#x27;  
spectcd by in, had as much weight t  
with it. 1  
But the conduct of the administra- t  
tion furnishes other strong arguments s  
in favor of the arrangement propos- c

from Lo. I sbury to Mr. E  
In support of that opinio.; you ob­  
serve, that as tne article stipulates  
that the linked Sates m,  
the manufactures and productions of  
Europe From their own ports, to any  
colony of the enemies of (ireat Bri­  
tain, they are prohibited by it from  
carrying the manufactures or pro­  
ductions of the countries beyond the  
cape of Good Hope, in ince manner,  
, tf) such colonies. You observe, also,  
; that as the United States are autho­  
ri seel to carry from their own ports  
the productions of enemy colonies  
lo Europe, they are prohibited from  
carrying those productions to the]  
southern coast of the Mediterranean,;  
or beyond the capo of Good Hope, or;  
to any other enemy or neutral colo­  
• nics in this quarter.  
I am persuaded that you will be  
satisfied, on further consideration, that  
this construction of that article is un­  
. founded. It is not the object  
of ihe article to regulate the ge­  
neral commerce of the countries,  
oi- to oouipromit their claims in any  
to which the regulation does not j  
i explicitly extend. The regulation  
1 prescribed by it applies to a case of&#x27;  
controversy between the parties, in a  
point of immediate contact, and it was  
the object of the article to adjust the  
; controversy in that point. If we ad­  
vert to the issue which was made up  
between them, as clearly defined by  
the, orders of the British government&#x27;,  
the decisions of the courts td&#x27; admiral­  
ty under them, and the discussions  
&#x27; which took place between the govcrn­  
j incuts on the subject, we shall iind  
that in no view can the construction  
I which you impute to the article, be  
supported.  
: The issue lately made up between  
the parties, involved solely the ques­  
tion, what circumstances or acts, to  
ihe performed in the neutral .ountry,  
J were neci ■ break the coin inn -  
; ity of a voyage from the colony of an  
enemy to its parent country, or some  
enemy country in Europe ? This point  
; had been settled, as was presumed, by  
! I&#x27;m-metdecisions of the British Courts  
;of admiralty, and explanations of the  
British government, in a manner  
! which was so far satisfactory to the U.  
, States as to justify a belief, that if  
those decisions and explanations had  
been adhered to, the existing contro­  
versy on this subject would riot have  
I arisen. . But in 180 5 the British courts  
of admiralty insisted on the pcrfomi­  
; anco of now acts in the LE States, or  
amounted to the same thing, ex­  
tended by construction the doctrine of  
former decisions in such a manner as  
to make the performance of new acts,  
such too as were of a nature highly  
onerous and oppressive, indispensably  
necessary On this special point the  
parties were at issue, and the sole ob« ,

[ parties, in every other instance, not I  
i within the scope of the adjustment,  
i were to remain, of course, untouched,  
; and, in that particular one, to revive  
i at the expiration &gt;of the term limited  
- for the durat&#x27;un of the article.  
A concise an iK&#x27;siS of the several  
i orders of the British government re­  
i lative to the trade of neutral powers  
i with enemy colonies, will place, in a  
, clear point of view, the ground of the  
■ \ controversy between the parties, and  
I the precise object and effect of the re­  
gulation proposed by the article un­  
der consideration. The first order  
bears dale on the 6th November, 1793. |  
It directed the British cruize rs lo bring j  
in for lawful (adjudication all vessels j  
with goods, the produce of any colony  
of Prance, or carrying provisions or  
supplies for such colony. That or- I  
der amounted, in express terms, to a. i  
declaration of war against the neutral i:  
powers, and it was issued in that spi- !  
rit by the British government. The t  
policy, however, which dictated the i  
order, did not last long. Events soon  
produced a change of policy, and with 1  
it a revocation, or, to use the techni- |i  
cal phraseology of the admiralty, a re- &lt;  
taxation of the order. The 2d order I  
was of the Bth January, 1794. It di- . I  
rected the cruizers &quot; to bring in all t  
vessels loaden with goods, the pro- ,t  
duce of the French W. India islands, l  
and coming directly from any port of 1  
ihe said islands to any port in Europe.&quot; t  
This order being directory prescrib- a  
ed the case in which neutral vessels i(c  
engaged in Such a trade shoulel be : c  
seized, and thereby confined the I \
seizure to that case only. No vessel j  
engaged in that trade which did not t  
come within the scope of the order, j c  
could be touched. Thus the effect of c  
tiic order was to inhibit the direct c  
trade of the U. S. between enemy co- ! 1  
lonies and Europe, in the productions t  
of those colonies. It left the trade r  
free between the U. S. and enemy co- j I  
lonies, and b.tween the CE S. and Eu- \
rope, and of course every other coun- I  
try. It left it free also in the di- s  
rect line, between enemy colonies and t  
Africa and Asia. By confining the \
restriction to Europe, those countries t  
were necessarily exempted from its I c  
operation. The 3d order of the 25th v  
January, 1798, directed the cruizers c  
&#x27;to &quot; bring in all vessels laden with &#x27;  
| cargoes, the produce of any island of &#x27; I  
; France, Spain or Holland, and com-j s  
| ing directly from any port of the said ! r  
islands or settlements to any poetifiEu- a  
rope, notbeingaportof G. Britain,nor : c  
of the country to which such ships be- &#x27; t  
ing neutral belonged.&quot; Tlie sole effect j f  
ot t his order was to extend to the neve  
tral powers of Europe, the accommo- .&#x27;c!  
dation which had been yielded to the .  
U.S. by that of Bth January, 1794. t  
The next order bears date on the 24th | I  
1 June, 1803. P directs the cruizers I a  
not to seize any vessel which shall be \ n  
carrying on trade directly between i  
the colonies of enemies and the neu- | r  
tral country to which the vessel be- r  
longs, and laden with the property of s  
inhabitants of such neutral country ;j t  
provided such vessel shall not be sup- | h  
plying nor have supplied the enemy t  
on the outward voyage with any art.i- &gt;a  
cles of contraband of war, &amp;x. The |t1  
sole object of this order appears to o  
have, been to introduce a new rule re- }ii  
lative to contraband, by subjecting aI c  
vessel to seizure on that account, on c  
her return voyage after depositing b  
her cargo at her place of destination, h  
It prohibits the seizure of neutral yes- &#x27;&#x27;  
sels, European as well as American, p  
engaged in a trade between enemy -j tl  
colonies and the neutral countries, 0  
by positive inhibition. That trade had ti  
been left iree before, by the rcstric- ai  
tion on the seizure to vessels engaged ll  
in tin* direct trade between enemy CO- b&#x27;  
loniesand die parent country. It was °  
now secured by positive inhibition. v  
The tight to carry on the trade fro.n tl  
the neutral country to other countries,  
was left on the ground on which it c  
stood before. That this order was not i|  
intended to affect that trade, and did tl  
not affect it, is made sufficiently cvi- 3J  
dent, by many decisions ol&quot; the courts ~  
of admiralty, which hare been given /;,  
die order was issued. in proof ct  
of this i refer to all the cases that   
were decided by the British courts of tc  
admiralty, touching the trade of neu vv  
trals with enemy colonies, in the years sj  
180:5 and 6, and especially to ,n,  
that of William Trefrcy, it being the Gj  
last one and containing a summary of st  
j the whole doctrine. C(  
If we recur to the decisions of the te  
| courts themselves, we shall find a lv  
  
t full confirmation of what is here ad­  
, vanced We shall iind that in r.onErm­  
, ing their decisions to the spirit oft I

&gt; j reject acts which were before deemed  
r j satisfactory by decisions the most so- ;  
• : lemn, and to impose new conditions j  
- &#x27; the most onerous and oppressive, laid j  
i that commerce completely at the  
I i mercy of British tribunals. The most  
• j material cases are those of the Imma­  
: nual, which involved the question of  
i a trade between Bourdcaux and St.  
i Domingo, that is the direct trade be­  
i tween the parent country and its colo­

ria of a bonafide importation. 2 1 t

were these of the Essex, Oroe, of the j  
Rowhena, and some others of the t  
same kind, in 1805, which turned on i  
the point of continuity of voyage, in  
which the court, pushing its doctrine &lt;  
to the unjust and pernicious extent I

; communicated by him to Mr. Kin;;, I  
&#x27; that by the relaxation of the general I  
j principle respecting the trade with I  
; enemy colonies, it was distinctly un- j !  
.&#x27;dcrstood, and had been repeatedly so ■ &lt;  
decided by the court of appeal, that j l

Of difficulty * that the mere toucl  
}in the neutral country to take fr  
, clearances, might perhaps be deemed I  
evasive, and in effect the direct trade-; I  
but that the high court of admiralty \
had expressly decided (and he saw no i  
hi to expect that the court of apt  
peal would vary the rules) that landing s  
the goods and paying tin* duties in the i  
neutral country would break the con- c  
tinuity of the voyage, and was such I t  
an importation as would legalize the 1  
trade, although the goods were re- (

of the same proprietors, and were for- c  
warded for sale to the mother coun- a

The discussion which took pi

t in that line as the special cause of

&gt; ■ course of a controversy which in volV­  
-j ed such important interests, that the  
• rights of the parties should be tt  
iiup on principle, and carried to the  
: greatest extent. To the light tin  
on the subject by a ye .say,  
which 1 received from you, I was  
much indebted, and I acfcliowii  
in this communication, the aid which  
it afforded me, with peculiar  
tion. A vindication, However, ol  
cause on principle, however extensive  
the range might be, could not al  
the origin of the controversy,*liorgiv«  
lo the article, entered into for its ad­  
justment a construction different from  
that which, by well established rules,  
is fairly applicable to it.  
Prom this view of the several or­  
ders of the British government, and  
from the exposition given of them b\
■ the court, and ov tlie government it­  
self, it appears that the sole object of  
those that were issued after that of  
the t*&gt;th November, 1793, was to in­  
hibit the direct trade of the U.S.  
colonies and Kurt  
thai they did not lou-.-.h, and were net  
intended to interfere with the trade  
between the U. S. and Europe, even  
the parent country, and a fortiori be­  
tween Ihe U. S, and Asia and Africa.  
jlt was, indeed, the object of the order  
;of November i i, to suppi  
j the commerce of neutral power:; with  
: enemy colonies altogether ; but that  
i being abandoned, the next idea which.  
occurred was to embarrass that ti  
by forcing it I  
Here, then, arose a hew q  
which turned entirely on another  
principle. Phai a lieutiv.i power had  
a right to carry on trade from its own  
ports, in any articles, though of re­  
produce, which had been incor­  
porated into the stock of the country  
not contraband of war, and to ail coun­  
iiotcontrovi rtc-C PE,t point,  
clear Stindisp  
had been long n the hi:  
tribui  
rists in England. The circumstai  
which constituted such an Ulce­  
ration of foreign into Uie  
Of tlie country, had also I  
settled by the same au|iiorkii  
the question which now arose, Lim­  
ed on this la.ter point. Ei fori  
j this commerce throng!,neutral p  
with a view to e;nba rwss it, il be­  
came necessary [to give the great-  
FfeCt to that expedient] to mi­  
i those lions,  
which was done in the maimer already  
stated.

which interfere with it. The

did not extend, and onccrt

T say thai tills 1 rnic is no! inhibited  
by ihe British principle, because it  
i iipposes a trade between enemy colo­  
nies and the mother country. But a  
trade between the U. S. and Asia or  
a, let the subject of it be what it  
may, is not a trade of that kind. It is  
a trade with independettf powers at  
&#x27;. (1. with whom we  
have a fight to trade, by all the rules  
which Ct. Britain has at any time iv-  
I on. It would be of dangerous ,  
tendency to admit that (­  
a pretension to interfere with such a  
trade lb any case. After the roods  
are received into the U. S. no matter  
bat afticles they consist, or from  
what: quarter th?y came, they arc the  
property of the country, and may of  
right be shipped to any other country*  
&#x27;i lie British principle does not contro­  
vert this doctrine; It asserts in its  
widest range the right only to seise  
them on their route to the neuual  
country, and from it to the mother  
country of the colony, or some other  
enemy&#x27;s country of Europe, provided,  
be not incorporated into the stock  
of the neutral country. If they are,  
they may go under the arrangement  
made to the countries to which the  
British principle applies. But they  
require no sanction from the British  
government, to go to those .o which  
it docs not apply. The destination of  
the Vessel alone would, as 1 presume,  
dispel every doubt of the legally of  
the trade, and preclude all farther in- i  
quiry concerning it. The epiesfion  
cf continuity of voyage could never j  
arise in such a case. It is certain  
that the arrangement alluded to gives !  
no sanction to it, and for the best of !  
all reasons, that the&#x27;, trade was not ad- |  
mitled, or even contended to be com- j  
prized within the range of British  
principle.  
1 shall close my remarks on this  
point by observing, that as the ar­  
rangeroent of the acts to break the  
iouity o\&#x27; the voyag* from the V-  
St ites, to the parent country, and o­  
ther enemy countries of EurOpe, in  
the produce of their colonies, and

i, on pro if feci­  
j- j procity, a privilege which there was  
0 j no reason to presume that any other  
n pow  
ip roc ate with the United  
,es, did not seem to be liable to the  
ited to it. The i c  
nriple which you advance, of cx­  
i- j ten ■ privileges to as small a  
iiber of powers as , Uu\
i- ■ also some weight in inducing us to uc­  
i- code to the arraa France is  
d admitted to an c I of them,  
it in the same extent with Great Britain.  
h She, therefore, has no cause of com­  
d plaint. Ido not think that the  
d lalion forbids any arrangement of the  
c govern ment, relative  
hips of war, that shall be admit­  
y led into the ports of the United  
c Stales at one time, OT any regulation i  
~ relative to their conduct while \
r the ports ofthe United States, pro- |  
r vided it be general and appli-.  
i cable lo both powers. A stipulation i  
y that the ships of war of each nation !  
- shall be hospitably received, into ihe J  
- ports of tiie other, docs not necessa-i  
- rily imply that there is to be no rule  
s as to the numbers to be admitted into  
t the, ports tO which they shall be con­  
t fined, or the order they shall observe j  
r while in port. Ail these topics have ;

, i son lo I ivri&#x27;iimenl &#x27;  
f | did not consider itself as having aban­  
-11 right to regulate them by ;  
1 this article.  
Ycuiv,next objection applies to the &#x27;  
3 i last ,  
c 12th ai dele.&#x27; By i  
i i voir iction of those parts of  
; the treaty, the United Stales would  
ess ii) favor of&#x27;  
t file: ir any !  
Ility which they migbt  
lit &#x27;&gt;n her ships of war or mer- I  
chant vessels, within the additional  
i limit, while she might commit, with  
i impunity, like aclsof hostility on the  
i ships of war and merchani vessels of j  
, her enemies, in case they did not ac­  
knowledge it, .si their ships  
pf war in case they did, although her  
own ships of w .;:• io both cases would  
within it. I was deci­  
dedly of opinion, and still au&#x27;i,  
while those articles Secure to the  
United States an unconditional advan­  
tage, none whatever is stipulated by  
them in favor of (Ireat Britain, which  
must not of necessity be common  
toher enemies; that her privilege,.  
on the contrary, whatever it may be,  
must be founded on their con  
fellow, and terminate with it.  
The 12tii article tea that  
Urcat Britain shall not stop the ves­  
sels ol the United States within live  
marine miles of their coast, except &#x27;  
for the purpose of examining whether  
they be American, or those of ano­  
ther power ; and that she shall not &#x27;  
the unarmed vessels of other |  
powers within the same limit, provi- i  
ded they acknowledge it, except to  
ascertain whether they belong to :  
those who have acknowledged it. The &lt;  
vessels of the powers &quot;who do not  
adopt the regulation are not affected &#x27;  
by it. They remain under the ordi- i  
nary protection of the law of nations, &lt;  
which extends* tothedi can- &lt;  
nou shot or three mjles from the  
. Beyond that limit the enemies &#x27;&#x27;■  
of Great Britain have a right to &#x27;  
search and seize hi , without ;  
amenable to the United States&#x27;,  
and the same right is reserved to her  
by this article, RS if it had not been !  
entered into. Vessels of war are &#x27;  
expressly excluded from the adva:i- &#x27;  
j tage of the regulation&#x27; &#x27;  
j It is the sole object of the 12th ar- &#x27;  
J tide to secure to the United States ah  
in, by extending their s  
: jurisdiction on their coast, in what &#x27;(  
| conci I -.selves, from thiec to •.  
five miles. The stipulation is tun on- (  
ditional as to them, but condition:! as .  
toother powers, dependent on I  
c limit. 11 iI (  
! reciprocal, by being&quot;&#x27;extended &#x27; (  
to the British dominions, northward  
  
t i of the United States, a circumstance  
a j which merits attention, as it pre­  
i, I chides the idea that any other eqniva­  
s lent was expelled or intended to be  
en for it. It would have been ex­  
,i&#x27; tended to the dominions of Gi eat Bri­  
if tain, in Europe and elsewhere, had  
~ the British commissioners desired it.  
y declined it, from a fear that it  
;bt produce some innovation in the  
n genera! doctrine of the law of nations  
c on the subject. This is, I think,  
I. fairly to be inferred from the instru­  
;_ ment itself.  
n The last paragraph of the 19th ar­  
e tide stipulates that neither of the  
. parlies shall permit the ships or goods j  
~ belonging to the subjects or citizens j  
,i of the other, to be taken within can­  
.. non shot of the coast, nor within the  
y jurisdiction described in article 12th,  
&#x27;;. |so long as thC provisions of the said  
c | article shall be in force, by the ships  
t] jof war of other powers ; but in case  
~ j it should en, the party, whose  
n i territorial rights shall thus have been  
v I violated, shall endeavor to obtain  
. i from the offending party, full and  
3 | ample satisfaction for the vessels so  
~ taken, Whether the same be vessels of  
. war or mereh.uit vessels.  
,| If any advantage is given to Great  
3 Britain by the arrangement proposed i  
1 by the 12th article, and this clause  
ofthe 19th, to the prejudice ol her!  
_ enemies, or of the United States, it ,&#x27;  
.] must lie by this clause. She can cer-&#x27;  
tainly claim none under the 12th ar­  
g tide. This clause consists of two  
distinct members, of very different I  
import. The first Contains a general  
I stipulation, conformable to the law of  
.ns, applicable to all the domini­  
; onsol both parties, and equally so to  
„ their ships of war and merchant ves­  
sels. With respect to the latter,  
j however, it is conditional. The se­  
j rood member applies to the arrange­  
it made in the 12th article, and in ;  
lb&#x27;; sense and spirit of that article.!  
If the 12ih article is carried into i  
! | effect in favor of other powers, which I  
j | can only be clone by their consent, then  
the advantage which is secured to  
iby it, will accrue likewise to  
at Britain. What is that advan- {  
;&#x27; Protection to their merchant !  
within the additional two !  
, &#x27; miles, and nothing else. It isobvi- \
\ • ous, that the protection which is sti- j  
! pulated in favor of ships of war is pro- &#x27;  
t : vided for, by the first member oi the I  
,o, and not by the second. It can- &#x27;  
| not he by both, for the distance de- :  
\ \ fined !&gt;y them is different, it being i  
r ] three miles in one, and five in tiie  
} other. It is equally obvious, that j  
, I the stipulation contained in the sc-  
I member of the clause, relative  
r to the 12th article, is intended to  
ite in tiie spirit of that article,  
to be made dependent on it.  
c \ By the terms &quot; nor within the jurisdic- ,  
. | tion described 12th, so long as the j  
; provisions of the said article shall j  
be in force,&quot; tiie stipulation contem­  
| plated is made conditional. In force, ,  
in respect to whom ? Not to the Unit-I  
ed, States, because it was uncondition- !  
.to them. It was conditional only  
with respect to other powers. Other  
ons might be given to shew that;  
the arrangement under consideration !  
is not Liable to the objection made to it,  
but I presume that those stated will be  
satisfactory.  
The difficulty to obtain the ac- \
-ion which was yielded in the &#x27;  
. article wan extreme. We la- &#x27;  
bored most earnestly to extend it to  
other po/vers, without their consent­  
to reciprocate it in favor of  
i Britain ; but that could not be  
accomplished. The British commis­  
sioners urged that as Great Britain  
predominated at sea, and must lose  
[by the concession in any form, it  
would he unjust for her to make the .  
concession in their favor unless they  
would allow her the advantage ofit. {  
Finding that it was impossible to !  
id the additional limit to other  
powers, on other terms, we thought  
ii advisable to adopt the arrange­  
ment in respect to them condition- ■  
ally, putting it in their power to ac- ,  
ccpt or reject it, as they thought  
We flattered ourselves that as  
they, could not lose by it, they would &lt;  
not refuse their assent to an arra.  
by Which they might gain, c  
oially as it would prove advantageous ,  
lo a friendly power. We deemed it .  
ly important to establish the ad­  
ditional limit in favor of the United &#x27;  
. from the advantage it might af­  
ford to their commerce within it, and ,  
from the effect which the measure &#x27;  
eel likely to produce on the.fu­  
ture&#x27; conduct ofthe British squadrons i  
on our coast, by whom it could not. ■  
fail to be considered as a severe cen- , (  
sure on the past. \ &#x27;  
It is readily admitted thaj; more  
suitable terms might have been a-«  
dopted to accomplish the object in &#x27;  
view. But it ought to be recollected, &#x27; .  
that as the right of jurisdiction im­  
poses of necessity the obligation of  
■ lion, without a special ex- .  
ccptiofl to it, there was some diffi­  
culty in making an arrangement  
  
c J which should secure to the United j  
. Stales the advantage which they dc-l  
. sired, and ut the same time cx­  
c empt them from the duty incident to  
. it.

“ The impressment of seamen from our  
merchant vessels is a topic, which claims a  
primary attention, from the order, which it  
holds in your letter; but more especially from  
some important considerations that are con¬  
nected with it. The idea entertained by the  
public is, that the rights of the United States  
  
were abandoned by the American commission¬  
ers in the late negotiation, and that their sea*  
men were left by tacit acquiescence, if not  
by formal renimciatioii, to depend for their  
safety on the mercy of the British ciuizei*8.  
1 have, on the c*ontrary, always believed, and  
still do believe, that tlie ground on which that  
interest was placed by the paper of the Bri¬  
tish commissioners of November 8, IWXJ, and  
the explanations wjiicli accompanied it, was  
both honourable ntul advantage mm to the Uni¬  
ted States ; that it contained a concession in  
their favour on the jmrt of (ireat Britain, on  
the great principle of contestation, never be¬  
fore made by a formal and obligatory act of  
the government, which was highly favourable  
to their intc rest; and that it also imposed on  
her the obligation to eonform her practice  
under it till a more complete arrangement  
should be concluded to the just claims of the  
United States.  
  
“ The British state, that the king was not  
prepared to disclaim, or derogate from a right,  
on which the security of the British navy might  
I essentially depend, especially in a conjuncture  
when he was engaged in wars which enforced  
the necessity of the most vigilant attention to  
the preservation aiul supply of his naval force ;  
that he had directed his commissioners to  
give to the commissioners of the United  
States the most |K)sitive assurances that in¬  
structions had lM»en given, and should he re¬  
peated and enlbrceci, to observe the greatest  
caution in the impressing British s( 5 arnen to  
preserve the citizens of the United States  
irom molestation or injury, and that immedi¬  
ate and prompt redress should l&gt;e atlorded on  
any representationof injury sustained by them.  
It then pro|&gt;oses to jKistpone the article rela¬  
tive to impressments, on account of the difti-  
cultics which were experienced in arranging  
any article on the subject, and to procecMl to  
conclude a treaty on the other {&gt;oints, that  
were embraced by the negotiation. As a mo¬  
tive to such |iostponemciit, and the condition  
of it, it assures us, that the British commis¬  
sioners were instructed still to entertain the  
discussion of any plan which could be devised  
to secure the interests of both states, without  
injury to the rights of either.  
  
“ By this paper it is evident, that the rights  
of the United States were expressly to he re¬  
served, and not abandoned, as has been most  
erroneously supposed; that Uie negotiation  
on the subject of impressment was to be post¬  
poned for a limited time, and for a special ob¬  
ject only, and to be revived as soon as that  
object was accomplished; and in the interim  
Uiat the practice of impressment was to  
correspond essentially with the views and in¬  
terests of the United States.  
  
“ In our letter to you of November 11,  
which accompanied the paper under conside¬  
ration, and in that of January 3d, which was  
forwarded with the treaty, these sentunents  
were Ihlly conlirmed.  
  
THE EXAMINER.  
  
45  
  
** lo that of Xovember 11, we communicated  
one important fact, which left no doubt of the  
sense in which it was intended by the British  
commissioners, that that paper should be con¬  
strued by us. In calling your attention to  
the passage which treats of impressment, in  
reference to the practice which should be ob¬  
served in future, we remarked, that the terms  
high seas” were not mentioned in it, and  
added, that we knew that the omission had  
been intentional. It was impossible that  
those terms could have been omitted inten¬  
tionally with, our knowUdge^ for any purpose  
other than to admit a construction that it w&#x27;as  
intended that impressments should be con-  
lined to the land. I do not mean to imply  
that it was understood between the British  
commissioners and us, that Great Britain  
should abandon the practice of impressment  
on the high seas altogether. I ine&gt;an, however,  
distinctly to state, that it was understood that  
the practice heretofore pui*sued by her, should  
he abandoned, and no impressment should be  
made on the high seas under the obligation of  
that paper, except in cases of an extraordina¬  
ry nature, to w&#x27;hich no general prohibition  
against it, could be construed fairly to ex¬  
tend. The cases to which I allude, were de-  
scril&gt;ed in our letter of November 11. They  
sui)[)ose, a British ship of war and a merchant  
vessel of the United States, lying in the Ta¬  
gus, or some other port, the desertion of some  
of the sailors from the ship of war to the  
merchant vessel, and the sailing of the latter  
with such deserters on board, they being Bri¬  
tish suldects. It was admitted that no gene¬  
ral prohibition against impressment, could be  
coiistinied to sanction such cases of injustice  
and fraud; and to such cases it was under¬  
stood that the practice should in future be  
confined.  
  
“ It is a just claim on our part, that the  
explanations which were given of that paper  
by the British commissioners w’hen they pre¬  
sented it to us, aiul afterwards while the ne¬  
gotiation was depending, which we communi¬  
cated to you in due order of time, should be  
taken into view, in a fair estimate of our con¬  
duct in that transaction. As the arrange¬  
ment which they pro^Kised, was of an informal  
nature, resting on an understanding l)etween  
the parties in a certain degree confidential, it  
could not otherwise than happen that such  
explanations won hi be given us in the course  
of the business, of the views of their govern¬  
ment in regard to it. And if an arrangement  
by informal understanding is admissible in  
any case between nations, it was our duty to  
receive those explanations, to give them the  
weight, to which they were justly entitled,  
and to communicate them to you, with our  
impression of the extent of the obligation  
which they imposed. It is in that mode only,  
that which is called an informal understand¬  
ing between nations can be entered into. It  
presumes a want of precision in the written  
doegments concerted with it, which is su|&gt;-  
  
plied by mutual explanations and confidence.  
Reduce the transaction to form and it become*  
a treaty. Tliat an informal understanding  
was an admissible mode of arranging this  
interest with Great Britain, is made sufficient¬  
ly evident by your letter, of February 3&lt;l,  
1807, in reply to ours of November 11, of the  
preceding year.  
  
“We were, therefore, decidedly of opinion,  
that the paper of the British commissioners,  
placed the interest of impressment on ground  
which it was both saj&#x27;e and honourable for the  
United States to admit; that in short it gave  
their government the command of the subject  
for every necessary and useful purpose. At¬  
tached to the treaty, it was the baisis or con¬  
dition on which the treaty rested. Strong in  
its character, in their favour, on the great ques¬  
tion of right, and admitting a favourable con¬  
struction on others, it placed them on more  
elevated ground in tliose respects than they  
had been before; and by keeping the negotia¬  
tion open, to obtain a more complete adjust¬  
ment, the administration was armed witli the  
more elfectual means of securing it.  
  
“ When I took Into view the prosperous and  
happy condition of the United JStates, compa¬  
red with that of other nations—that as a neu¬  
tral t)ower, they were almost the exclusive  
carriers of the productions of the whole world,  
and that in commerce they flourished beyond  
example, notwithstanding tJie losses which  
they occasionally suffered, I was strong in the  
opinion, that those blessings ought not to be  
hazarded in such a question. Many other con¬  
siderations tended to contirm me in that senti¬  
ment. I knew that the United States were  
not prepared for war, that their coast was  
unfortified, and their cities in a great measure  
defenceless, that their militia, in many of the  
states, was neither armed nor trained, and that  
their whole revenue was dJ^rived from com¬  
merce. I could not presume that there was  
just cause to doubt v/hich of the alternatives  
ought to be preferred.”

contained a concession in their f.,vor, on the put of  
Uircat iliitain, on tlie great principle of contestation,  
never before marie by a formal and obligatory ; cL of the  
got eminent, which was highly tUvnrablc to their inte­  
rest ; and that it also imposed on lier the obligation to  
r.onf. rm her practice under it, til! a more complete art  
rangi meiit should be concluded, to the just claims of  
I 1&#x27;f* I&#x27;ltitull Cfotno  
  
&quot; The British pnper states that the king Wus not pre­  
pared to disclaim, or derogate from a right on which  
the security of tlic British navy might essentially de­  
pend, c specially in a conjuncture when tie was engaged  
m wars which enforced the necessity of the most vie-;,  
fant attention to the preservation and supply of ids na­  
val force; that lie had directed his commissioners to  
give to the commissioners of the United States the most  
positive assurances, that instructions had been given,  
and should be reposted and enforce i, to observe the  
greatest caution in the impressing of British seamen, to  
preserve the citizens of the United States from moles­  
tation or injury, and ihat immediate and prompt re­  
dress should be afforded on any representation of injury  
sustained by them. It then proposes to postoone the  
article relative to impressments, on account of the dif­  
ficulties which were experienced in arranging any arti­  
cle on tor subject, and to proceed to conclude a treaty  
on the o&#x27;lier points, that were embraced bv ti.e negockv­  
tion. As a motive to such postponenient/amt tlie con­  
dition of it, it assures us, that the British commission­  
ers were ir.suacted stilt to entertain the discussion of  
any ph.n winch could be devised Io secure the interest  
of both states, without iqjurv to the rights of either.  
&quot; Bv this paper it is evident that the rights of the  
United Stales were expressly to he reserved, and rot s­  
bandaned, as lias iieen most erroneously supposed ; that  
tile negotiation oh the subject of impressment n.s to be  
postponed for a limited time, and for a special object  
only, and to be revised ns soon as that object was ac­  
complished ; and in the interim that the practice of im­  
pres-uTicui was to correspond essentially with the views  
and interests r,f the United States.  
“ In our le tter to you, of Nov. 11. which accompanied  
tiie paper under consideration, and in that of January  
Sd, which win forwarded with the treaty, these senti­  
ments were fully confirmed.  
&quot; I1&#x27; that! of N*ov. 31, we communicated one important  
fret, which fell no doubt of tiie sense in which it was  
intended by tiie British commissioners, that that paper  
should lie construed by us. In calling your attention to  
toe passage which treats of impressment, in reference  
to Ou practice which snculd he observed in future, we  
remarked that the terms “high seas” were not mein  
tioned hi it, and added, that we knew that tiie omis­  
sion had been intentional. It was impossible that those  
lerrr.s could have i&gt;een omitted intentionally, mcr  
htui-r.rrfye, for any purpose other than to admit a con­  
struction that it v as intended that icr.prcssujenta should  
be confined to the Jaud. I do not mean to imply that it  
was understood between tiie British commissioners and  
us, that tireat Britain should abandon tiie practice of  
impressment, oh the high seas altogether. I mean, how­  
ever, distinctly to state,,that it was understood that  
the practice heretofore pursued by her should be aban­  
doned, and ™ impressment should lie made ou the  
high sms, under the obligation of that paper, except  
in cases of sn extraordinary nature, to which no ye.  
neral prohibition against it could be construed faiiiy  
to extend. ! he Cases to which I allude, were des­  
  
^wi a a r,v\ siipjiosc* a milisii  
ship of war and a merchant vessel oi’ the United states,  
lying in the Tagus, or some other part, the desertion of  
some of the saiiors from the ship of rear to the merchant  
vessel, and the sr.iimy of the. latter with such deserters  
on hoard they beihg British subjects. It was admitted  
that no general prohibition against impressment could  
he construed to sanction such cases of injustice and  
fraud ; and to such cases it was understood that the  
pract ice should in future be confined.  
“ It is a just claim on our part, that the explanation^  
which were given of that paper liy the British commis­  
sioners when they presented it io us, and afterwards,  
while the negotiation was depending, which we com­  
municated to you in due order of time- should be taken  
intoviiw, in a fair estimate of our conduct in that trans­  
act ion. As the arrangement, which tbev proposed was  
of an informal nature, resting on an understanding be­  
tween the part tea in a certain degree confidential, it  
could not otherwise than happen that such y Xplanatinns  
would be given us in the course of busirffss, of the  
views of their government in regard to it. And if an  
arrangement, bv informal understanding, is admissible  
in any case between nations, it was cur t’utv to receive  
those explanations, to give them the weight, to which  
they wei* justly entitled, atul to communicate them to  
von, with our impression of thp extent of the obliga­  
tion, -which they imposed.&quot; It is in that mode only that  
what j» called tut .informal understanding between na­  
tions can be entered into. It presumes a want of pre­  
cision in the written documents connected with it, which  
is supplied by mutual explanations and confidence. -Se­  
duce the transaction to form and it becomes a treaty..  
Tliatan informal understanding was an admissible mode  
of arranging thi* Interest with Great Britain is made  
sufficiently evident by your letter of Keb. Pd. WOf, in  
reply to&#x27;ours of Xovcmber If, of tbe preceding veer. •  
v “ We .were, therefore, decidedly of opinion,‘ ^ist the  
paper of the British commissioners placed the interest  
bf impressment on ground which it w*s both sjda and  
honorable for the Cnitecl States to admit j that in shoit  
it gave their government the command of the subject,&quot;  
for every necessary and useful purpose, ; Attached to  
the treaty,: it was the fttsja or edm&#x27;.ition, on which tho  
treaty rested. Strong in its character in their favor ©rf  
the great qurstioti nf right, and admittlyg wfavprabie

dition of the United States compared witli that oi other

exclusive carriers of. the productions of the whole world ,  
and that in commerce they nourished beyond, example,

ft red, I wta strong in the opinion, tiiat liiose blessings  
«ug,it not to he hazarded in such a question. Many o­  
tht-r considerations tended to confirm me in that senti­  
ent. I knew that the United State* Were not prepar­  
ed lor War ; that their coast was unfortified, and their  
cities in a great measure defenceless ; that their mill­  
lia, in many of tire state*, was neither armed nor train­

Richmond, February 28, 1808.  
Sin,—it appears by your letter of May 20th, 1807,  
which was forwarded by Mr. Purviance to Mr. Pink-  
ney and myself, at London, and received on the 16th  
July, that you had construed several articles of the  
  
itreaty, which we had signed with the British com-  
  
missioners, on the 31st December, 1806, in a differ-  
ent sense from that in which they were conceived by  
us. As the course we were instructed to pursue, by  
  
which was-confirmed in that of May 20th, was in no  
degree dependent on our construction of any of H¢  
articles, or on the political considerations which in-  
duced us to sign it, we deemed it unnecessary to  
enter into any explanation in reply, either of our  
construction of its articles, or of the political con-  
, siderations alluded to. We thought it more consis-  
|tent with our duty, to look solely to the object of our  
instructions, and to exert our utmost eflorts to ac-  
complish it; and we acted in conformity to that sen-  
timent. The result of these efiorts was made known,  
by the documents which 1 had the honor to. present  
to you, when I was lately at Washington, being co-  
pies of a joint dispateh, which Mr. Pinkney and ft  
jhad forwarded by Mr. Rose. We had flattered our-  
selves, that it might have been practicable to obtain  
the amendments of the treaty which the president

come infact, what the exterior announced it tobe,  
hostile, and it was difficult to perceive how it could  
be changed, and peace be preserved, with honor to  
the United States. They could not recede from the  
ground which they had taken, or accept, by compul-

without violating the relations of amity between the |  
countries. The right to break off the negociation|  
and appeal to force, could never be lost sight of in|  
any discussion on the subject; while there was no)  
onligation to make that appeal till mecessity com-  
pelled it. If Great Britain conformed her practice |  
to the rule prescribed by the paper of November 8, |  
and the explanations which accompanied it, our go-!  
vernment might rest on that ground with advantage; |  
but if she departed fiom that rile and a favorable  
opportunity offered for the accomplishment of al  
more complete and satisfactory arrangement, by a  
decisive effort, it would be at liberty to seize such |  
opportunity for the advantage of the country.  
  
These considerations, founded on a view of the  
proposed arrangement itself, furnished strong induce- |  
ment to us to proceed to the other objects of the ne-  
fociation. There were other considerations of a dif-  
ferent character, which recommended it with still  
greater force. Had we refused to proceed in the  
negociation, what was the alternative which such a  
refusal presented to our view? The negociation  
would have been at an end, after having failed in all  
its objects; for ifthis interest was not arranged,  
none others could be. The attitude which the go-  
vernments held towards each other, was in a certain  
degree hostile. Injuries had heen inflicted by oie  
party, and resentment shewn by the other, the latter  
having taken a step in the case of the non-importati-  
on law, which was intended to vindicate the public  
rights and honor by being made the means of obtain-  
ing aredress of those injuries. The measure was  
intended forthe ministry of Mr Pitt, from which  
the injuries were ‘received, but by the removal of  
that ministry, and the delay which took place in the  
passage of the law, itcame into operation against  
the ministry of Mr. Fox and lord Grenville, who  
would not have rendered those injuries, and against  
whom ofcourse such a weapon would not have been  
raised. Notwithstanding the existence of that law,  
and the attitude which still remained between the  
  
  
  
government, it was impossible to appeal to it as a|  
strong motive of action with the new ministry

not to be hazarded in such aquestion. Many other  
considerations tended to confirm me in that senti-  
ment. Iknew that the United States were not pre-  
pared for war; that their coast was unfortified, and  
their cities in a great measure defenceless: that  
their militia, in many of the states, was neither  
armed nor trained; and that their whole revenue was  
derived from commerce. I could not presume that  
there was just cause ty doubt which of the alter-  
natives ought to be preferred. Had it, however,  
been practicable to terminate the negociation, with-  
out such an adjustment as that proposed, and with-  
out taking any decisive measure in consequence of  
its failure, what was to become of the non-importa-  
tion law? If suffered to remain in force, it was sure  
to produce war. Great Britain, it was known, would  
enter into no arrangement, by treaty, which did not  
provide for its repeal; and there was little reason to  
presume, after the rupture of the negociation, by  
which the relation between the parties would be less  
friendly, that she would become more accommodat-  
ing. It was, on the contrary, fairly to be concluded,  
that if any arrangement whatever should be practi-  
cable, it would be a less advantageous one than that  
which we had sanctioned. Some disposition of it  
was therefore indispensibly necessary, in any course  
which might be taken. ‘These considerations had  
much weight in deciding that which was pursued,  
and I frankly own, thata sincere desire to afford to  
the administration an honorable opportunity for its  
repeal, since, under existing circumstances, it did  
not seem probable that it could be longer useful,  
and might be injurious, was a strong motive with  
me to incur the responsibility which 1 took on myself  
in that transaction. Tothe arrangement proposed  
we gave our sanction. We undertook to submit it  
to the consideration of our government, taking care  
to inform the British commissioners, that we had no  
power to conclude atreaty that would be obligatory  
on the United States, which did not arrange ina sa-  
tisfactory manner the interest of impressment. We  
agreed also to proceed in a discussion of the other  
abjects of the negociation, and eyentually concluded

quently stated, that if our government should disap-  
prove the arrangement relative to impressment, the  
whole would fall with it. Thus the United States  
enjoyed the advantage of being at liberty to accept  
or reject the arrangement, while on the British go-

project with the other a treaty. There was in truth  
nothing Unreasonable in this circumstance,as the Bri-

such a recurrence to it impossivle, ‘This advantage

we had expected to oltain, it was nevertheless, in  
the then state of affairs, such a one as the United  
States might adopt with credit and advantage. 1  
have no doubt that the British commissioners enter-  
tained still greater confidence insuch a result. The  
circumstance of our finally agreeing to sanction the  
arrangement rather than break off the negociation,  
at which issue we had frequently stood, in the pro-  
gvess of it, was calculated to make that impression.  
But it was much strengthened by a knowledge, that  
the whole arrangement would expose them to very  
  
. . {  
severe and probably successtul attacks from. the op-&#x27;  
position, while they had no expectation that it would  
  
be popular in the country.  
  
By your letter of Feb. 3d, 1807, in reply to ours  
of Nov. 11th, 1806, the course which the government  
resolved to pursue was announced. By it we were  
informed, that the president disapproved the infor-  
mal arrrangement proposed by the British commis-  
sioners relative to impressment, and was resolved to  
enter intono treaty with the British goverument,  
which when limitted to, or short of strict right on  
every other point, should include in it no article on  
that particular one; that in case such an article  
could not be obtained, we should terminate the ne-  
gociation without any formal compact whatever, but  
with a mutual understanding, founded on friendly  
and liberal discussions and explanations, that in prac-  
tice each party would entirely conform to, what  
should be thus informally settled between them. And  
we were authorised to give assurances, in case such  
an arrangement should be satisfactory in substance,  
that as long as it should be respected in practice,  
particularly on the subjects of neutral trade and im-  
a aise the president would earnestly, and. pro-  
  
ably successfully, recommend it to congress not to  
permit the non-importation law to go into operation;  
and in the mean time, that he would exercise the  
power vested in him by an act of congress, if no in-  
tervening intelligence forbade it, of suspending its  
operation till the meeting of congress, who, being  
in session, would have an opportunity to make due  
provision for the case; and finally, that if a treaty,  
which did not provide for the interest of impress-  
ment, should have been concluded before the receipt  
of that letter, we should candidly apprize the British  
commississioners of the reasons why it would not he  
ratified, and invite them to enter again on the busi-  
ness with a view to such a result as was desired.  
  
By this letter the arrangement which we had sanc-  
tioned, comprising the informal one relative to im-  
pressment, and that by treaty on the other topics,  
was rejected, and lieu of it we were ifstructed to  
enter into an informal understanding or arrangement  
of the whole subject, and as was to be inferred from  
the fair import of the letter, on the same conditions.  
It was the more to be presumed that the government

ter into some arrangement, which should preserve  
| the peace of the country, although it should not ac-  
complish the object which had been so ardently de-  
isived. The only difference between the plan which  
we sanctioned and that which it proposed, was that  
| the whole arrangement should be informal. Had the  
&#x27;administration resorted to war as a preferable alter-  
/native, or been willing to leave the business unset-  
itled, its policy and example might have been plead  
against us; hut in offering to accept the same con-  
ditions in an informal mode, and to withdraw, in  
some form, the non-im, ortation law as a motive to  
it, it shewed that the considerations which had been  
respected by us had as much weight with it.  
  
But the conduct of the administration furnishes  
other strong arguments in fayor of the arrangement  
proposed by the American commissioners. By en-  
gaging to observe the informal arrangement which  
we were instructed to enter into, as long as Great  
Britain should observe it, it seemed as if the United  
States would be deprived of the right of insisting  
on otlrer terms, howeyer favorable the opportunity  
tor it might be, while Great Britain would be at li-  
_berty to depart from such arrangement whenever the  
}events of war furnished her an adequate motive tor  
it. ‘This was the opposite of our arrangement as I  
have stated above, by which, as we presumed, she  
would be bound, and we free. Certainty to our mer-  
chants was all important. Any fair well defined rule,  
&#x27;within which they might presecute in safety their  
‘enterprizes, although it might fall short in some  
‘respects of our just claims, might perhaps be pre-  
&#x27;ferable to frequent collisions which put every thing  
‘at hazard. In any event it was an object of great  
limportance to keep the peace of the country in our  
‘own hands, by retaining the right to resort to war  
| when it suited us and then only.  
| { will now proceed to the other tepics, which are  
adverted to in your letter of May 20, 1807, and on  
  
which I shall be as concise as possible. In your ex-  
‘amination of the treaty you notice several of primary  
| importance, which you conceive to have been impro-  
perly. arranged in the articles which refer to them.  
T will pursue in my remarks the order which you  
have traced.  
  
You consider the 11th article as objectionable in  
having shut to our commerce important channels  
which were left open to it, by the decisions of the  
British courts, and the principles contained in the  
communication from lord Hawkesbury to Mr. King.  
In support of that opinion you observe that as the  
article stipulates, that the United States may carry  
)the manufactures and productions of Europe, from  
|their own ports, to any colony of the enemies 0%  
Great Britain, they are prohibited by it from carry-

such treaties. By treaty, neither of those powers  
have any right in the case in question, nor have we  
in the ports of either. By treaty, Great Britain had  
enjoyed those rigiits in the ports of the United  
States, as we had in her ports from the year 1794.  
Spvin and Holland knew the conditions of that treaty,  
which was in force at the commencement of the  
present war, and some time afterwards, and would  
have been in force till Jate in the last year, had a  
special condition of the 12th article been carried into  
effect. To renew the treaty in the express terms of  
the former one, a treaty which deprived no one pow-  
er of any existing conventional right; which subjected  
none to conditions to which they had not been al-  
ways subjected; which allowed to Great Britain, on  
Principles of reciprocity, a privilege which there  
Was no reason to presume that any other power,  
especially Spain, would consent to reciprocate with  
the United States, did not seem to be liable to the  
objection stated to it. The general principle which  
you advance, of extending those privileges to as  
small a number of powers 2s possible, had also some  
Weight in inducing us to accede the arrangement.  
France is admitted to an enjoyment of them, in the  
same extent with Great Britain. She, therefore, has  
no cause of complaint. I do not think that the stipu-  
lation forbids any arrangement of the government,  
relative to the number of ships of war, that shall be  
admitted into the ports of the United States at one  
time, or any regulation relative to their conduct  
While within the ports of the United States, provided  
it be general and equally applicable to both powers.  
A stipulation that the ships of war of each nation  
shall be hospitably received into the ports of the  
other, does not necessarily imply that there is to be

three miles from the coast. Beyond that limit the  
enemies of Great Britain have a right to search and  
‘seize her vessels, without being amenable to the  
United States, and the same right is reserved to her  
by this article, as if it had not been entered into.  
Vessels of war are expressly excluded from the ad-  
\vantage of the regulation.  
  
It is the sole object of the 12th article to secure to  
the United States an accommodation, by extending  
their jurisdiction on their coast, in what concerns  
themselves, from three to five miles. The stipula-  
tion is unconditional as to them, but conditional as  
to other powers, dependent on their acknowledging  
the same limit. It is made reciprocal, by being ex-  
tended to the British daminions, northward of the  
United States, a circumstance which merits atten-  
tion as it precludes the idea that any other equiva-  
lent was expected or intended to be given for it. It  
would have been extended to the deminions of Great  
Britain, in Europe and elsewhere, had the British  
commissioners desired it. They declined it, from a  
fear that it might produce some innovation in the  
general doctrine of the law of nations on the subject.  
This is, I think, fairly to be inferred from the instru.  
ment itself. ;  
  
The last paragraph of the 19th article stipulates  
that neither of the parties shall permit the ships or  
goods belonging to the subjects or citizens of the  
other, to be taken within cannon shot of the coast,  
nor within jurisdiction described in article 12th, so  
long as the provisions of the said article shall be in  
force, by the ships of war of other powers; but in  
case it should so happen, the party whose territorial  
rights shall thus have been violated, shall endeavor

If any advantage is given to Great Britain by the  
  
arrangement proposed by the 12th article, and this|  
ciause of the 19th, to the prejudice of her enemies,  
or of the United States, it must be by this clause.—  
She&#x27;can certainly claim none under the 12th article.  
This clause consists of two distinct members of ve-  
ry different import. The first contains a general  
stipulation, conformable to the law of nations, ap-  
plicable to all the dominions of both parties, and  
equally to their ships of war and merchant vessels.  
With respect to the latter, however, it is conditional.  
The second member applies to the arrangement  
made in the 12th article, and in the sense and spirit  
of that article. If the 12th article is carried into  
effect in favor of other powers, which can only be  
done by their consent, then the advantage which is  
secured to them by it, will accrue likewise to Great  
Britain. What is that advantage? Protection to their  
merchant vessels within the additional two miles,  
and nothing else. It is obvious, that the protection  
which is stipulated in favor of ships of war is pro-  
vided for, by the first member of the claus +, and not  
by the second. It cannot be by both, for the d’s-  
tunce defined by them is different, it being three  
miles in one, and five in the other. It is equally ob-  
  
member of the clause, relative to the 12th article,  
13 intended to operate in the spirit of that article,  
and to be made dependent on it. By the terms “nor  
within the jurisdiction described in article 12th so  
long as the provisions of the said article shall be in  
force,” the stipulation contemplated is made condi-  
tional. In force, in respect to whom? Not the}  
United States, because it was unconditional as to}  
them. It was conditional only with respect to other |  
powers. Otherreasons might be given to shew that  
the arrangement under consideration is not liable to  
  
  
  
staiel will be satisfactory.  
  
The difficuity to obtain the accommodation which  
was yielded in the 12th article w:s extreme. We la-  
bored most earnestly to extend it to other powers,  
without their consentirg to reciprocate it in favor of  
Great Britain; but that could not be accomplished.  
  
Britain predomin:ied at sea, and must lose by the  
concession in any form, it would be unjust for her to  
make the concession in their favor, unless they would |  
allow her the advantage of it.” Finding that it was_|  
impossible to extend the additional limit to other  
powers, on — terms, we thought it advisable to  
adopt the arrangement in respect to them condition- |  
ally, putting it in their power to accept or reject it,  
as they thought fit. We flattered ourselves that as  
they could not lose by it, they would not refuse their  
assent to an arrangement by which they might gain,  
especially as it would prove advantageous to a friend-  
ly power. We deeined it highly important to establish  
the additional limit in favor of the United States,  
from the advantage it might afford to their com-  
merce within it, and from the effect which the mea-  
sure seemed likely to produce on the future conduct  
of the British squadrons on our coast, by whom it  
could not fail to be considered as a severe censure  
on the pist.  
  
It is readily admitted that more suitable terms  
might have beer adopted to accomplish the object  
in view. But it ought to be recoll-cted, that as the  
right of jurisdiction imposes of necessity the obli-  
gation of protection, without a special exception to  
it, there wags some difficulty in making an arrange-  
ment which should secure to the United States the  
advantage which they desired, and at the same time  
exempt them from the duty incident to it.  
  
  
  
  
  
what is stated on the subject of it, in our letter of  
January 3d, 1807. As the paper of the British com-  
missioners to which it relates, had no sanction what.  
ever from us, as was fully shewn by that letter, the  
objection cannot be said to apply to any part of our  
conduct. The paper was produced by the decree of  
the emperor of France, of the 21st November, 1806,  
and was intended by the British commissioners, to  
operate as a reservation of right, in their govern.  
ment, not to ratify the treaty, or not to be precluded,  
under certain circumstances, in case it did ratify it,  
from adopting such measures, as it might find ne-  
cessary, to counteract the restrictions imposed by  
that decree. The exercise of the right reserved was  
made dependent on the abandonment of the principle  
of that decree by the French government, or an  
assurance from the government of the United States,  
or such conduct as would be equivalent, that the  
pretension would not be submitted to by it. We  
apprized the British commissioners that our gos  
vernment would enter into no engagement whatever,  
of what it would do, in any case, with another pow-  
er. Had the treaty been ratified, even without any  
notice being taken of that paper, it could not have  
imposed the slightest obligation on the United  
States, either to perform any act on their part, or to  
submit to any, on the part of Great Britain. Ihad  
supposed, however, in the case of ratification, that  
we should have been instructed to present to the  
British governinent, with the instrument of ratifica.  
tion, a counter declaration to that effect. ‘Fhe whole  
subject was before our government, with our strong  
and decided objection to that paper. All that we  
could do was to transmit it to you, with a correct  
statement of what occurred in the negociation res-  
  
ipecting it, which we did. To the government it  
  
belonged to take the step which the occasion re-  
quired, not to us.  
  
Having noticed the objections which are especial-  
ly stated in your letter of May 20, 1807, and given  
our view of the several parts of the treaty to which  
they relate, I shall proceed to make explanatory re-  
marks on the other articles, in order to do justice to  
the conduct of the American commissioners in re-  
gard to them.  
  
Article 5. You admit that this article is an essen-  
tial improvement of that on the same subject in the  
treaty of 1794. It certainly improves it in two im-  
portant interests; Ist, in that of the navigation of  
the United States, and 2d, in that of duties on Ame-  
rican productions carried to the British market. The  
tonnage on American ships in British ports had been  
raised to sterling per ton, while that on  
  
|British ships in the ports of the United S:ates was  
  
only 50 cents, or 2s. Sd. per ton ; and the duty on  
the buiky productions of the United States, in Ame-  
rican bottoms, had been raised to such a heigth, un-  
der the countervailing regulations which the treaty  
allowed, as to secure, in time of peace, the entire  
carriage of those productions to British vessels, if,  
indeed, it did not materially affect the price of the  
articles themselves. What made it more unfortu-  
nate was, that the United States could not adopt any  
measure to remedy those evils without committing  
a direct and palpable violation of the treaty, as they  
were bound by it not to raise the existing duties high-  
er than they were at the time the treaty was conclud-  
ed. Those evils would, however, have been com:  
pletely done away by this article. By it the United  
States would have had a right to raise the duty or  
Bvitish vessels to any height to which the British  
government might raise it on theirs, a check which  
could not fail to prove adequate to the object, while  
they had also aright to give what preference they

 the United States an/tained in it important, as it enabled the United

as the necessity she is under to avail herself of every | the trade with the West Indies, which is the object  
resource Which she can command to raise revenue of it, by means the most efficacious, whenever they  
for indispensable purposes, renders it impossidle for|should be resorted to. The trade of Great Brita&#x27;n  
her to make a like discrimimation in favor of her own| with the United States is carried on-principally by  
vessels. The inhibition of all discriminating duties, | circuitous voyages, in which ber vessels pass from  
  
on the production of the one, and manufacturers of  
the other party, whether they be carried in Ameri-  
can or British bottoms, was a stipulation which it  
was presumed would also prove highly advantageous  
to the Umted States. The pernicioys tendency of  
that principle was well known to you, and we were  
happy to be able to suppress it.  
  
The objections which you urge to other parts of  
the article, apply te clauses in the treaty of 1794,  
which it was impossible for us to change. I have,  
however, to observe that there is nothing in it to  
prevent the passage of a navigation act, provided it  
be adopted as a measure of general policy. Most of  
the nations of Europe, especially France, would be  
happy, in a general view, to see the United Siates re-  
sort to that expedient to counteract the restrictive  
system of England ; and as it is one which could not  
essentially affect them, they could find no motive of  
that kind, to inspire a wish to oppose it, nor could)  
the United States, as I supposed, find one to exempt |  
them from it. |  
  
We regretted that we could not obtain a stipula-  
  
  
  
tion which should compel Great Britain to repeal the:  
  
jaws which impose so high a duty on her manufac-  
  
the ports of the United States to the West Indies.  
By suspending the intercourse between the United  
States and her West Indies, in British vessels, the  
chain would be broken, and the whole commerce in  
such vessels be, ina great measure, suspended.—  
The provision in the article obviously locks to suck  
an object, and the time of carryiig: into effect, un&lt;  
less the trade should be placed on satisfactory ground,  
would have depended altogether on the U. States.  
Having already noticed the subjects which are  
embraced by the following articles, I shall add but  
little more, on any of them, to what is said in our  
  
}joint letter of January 3d, 1807. The 7th was  
  
taken literally from the treaty of 1794. The 8h  
and 9th amended, as you allow, the articles in that  
treaty on the same subject. ‘The 10th, relative to  
blockade, taker in connection with the British paper  
of December 31, 1806, placed, as I presumed, tiat  
interest on ground which would be satisfactory.  
The preamble cannot affect it unfavorably, as it  
does not alter the acknowledged law. The only ef-  
fect which it could have, would be to admonish the  
courts to be cautious in admitting evidence of no-  
tice, on account of the distance of the U. States

tures, when exported to the United States. Our let-  
ter shewed that we did every thing in our power to  
obtain such a stipulation. I was, however, persuaded,  
that the want of it would not expose us to all the  
evils which you seem to apprehend from it, admit-  
ting that the British construction of that clause in  
the former treaty was a sound one, and that nothing  
is contained in the 23d article of the present one to  
discountenance it. It is certain that no government  
will ever tax exports higher than indispensable ne-  
cessity compels it, because such a tax tends in all  
cases essentially to check industry, and to destroy  
the most productive source of national prosperity.  
The inhibition imposed by the constitution of the  
United States on the congress, to tax, in the slight-  
est degree, their exports, affords a strong argument,  
drawn from the acknowledged wisdom of its fira-  
mers, against the policy of such a tax, in the ab-  
stract; and I am persuaded that the reasons against  
it are as strong with Great Britain, if not stronger,  
than with any other nation. Without taking a more  
comprehensive view of the subject, it is sufficient

|in respect to evidence, than was allowed to powers

|the contrary, maintained in their note to us of De-  
cember 3lst, 1806, in which it is asserted to be no-

be in astate of blockade without allotting to that  
‘object a force sufficient to make the entrance into  
them manifestly dangerous.” I quote the passage

not be entitled to those advantages without paying  
the equiyalents. The doctrine is the same in its ap-

any privileges in trade to France or Spain for ad-  
mission into their West India colonies, Great Britain  
would be entitled to the same, provided she admit-

and in a situation to be compelled to risk every  
thing, if pressed by his adversary, on the precarious  
issue of a single battle. These were strong reasons  
why we should not throw ourselves too decisively  
into that scale.  
  
The situation of the United States, always a res-  
pectable one, was then less imposing than it usually  
was. It was known that they were not on good terms  
with Spain, ard that France was the ally of Spain.  
‘Tueir interior too, was disturbed by a conspiracy of  
doubtful extent and dangerous tendency, the conse-  
quences of which were sure to be greftly magnified  
by all who were unfrieadly to our happy system of  
government. Those circumstances could not fail to  
be taken into view, by any the most friendly admi-  
nistration in England, when pressed to make con-  
cessions which it was unwilling to make. Add to  
these considerations, the inportant one, that the  
British ministry had become much impaired in its  
strength, especially in whut concerned the United |  
States, by the death of a very eminent and distin-  
guished statesman, and had not the power, or  
thought it had not, to pursue a liberal policy to-  
wards the United States, and that its power was  
evidently daily diminishing.  
  
  
  
These considerations induced us to sign the treaty,  
  
  
  
  
  
and submit it to the wisdom of our government,

the happiest result. My retirement, which had been  
long desired, and delayed only by the arduous and  
very important duties in which I was engaged, had  
become necessary as a relief to my mind, after much  
fatigue, and to the interest of my family, which had  
been neglected and greatly injured by my absence in  
the public service. It is still my desire to cherish  
retirement. Should it, however, be our unfortunate  
destiny, which I most earnestly hope will not be the  
case, to be involved in foreign war or domestic trou-  
ble, and should my services be deemed useful, I will  
not hesitate, at the desire of the administration, to  
nepair again to the standard of my country.

“ The impressment of seamen from the  
merchant vessels is a topic, which claims a  
primary attention, from the order which it  
holds in your letter; but more especially  
from some important considerations that are  
connected with it. The idea entertained  
hy the public is, that the rights of the Uni¬  
  
ted States were abandoned liy the Ameri¬  
can commissioners in the late negotiation,  
and that their seamen were left by tacit ac-  
quiesceijce, if not formal renunciation, to  
depend for their safety, on the mercy of the  
British cruisers. 1 have, on the contrary^  
always believed, and still do believe, that  
the ground on whiohthat interest placed  
  
by the paper of the British commissioners  
of Novtm »er 8, 1806, and the explana¬  
tions which accompanied it, was both ho*  
nourable and adiantageous to the United  
States; that it contained a concession in  
their favour, on the part of Great &#x27;Britain,  
on the great principle of contestation, ne¬  
ver before made by a formal and obligatory  
act of the government, which w^as highly  
favourable to their interest; and that italso

her practice under it till a more complete  
arrangement should be concluded, to the

posed, it should be ratified ; or, it may be, because it did not accom-  
plish all that he demanded ; because no provision was made in it to  
prevent the impressment of seamen. Every other matter of dispute  
between the two countries was adjusted, and some approximation was  
made towards appeasing the Joud complaints which had existed on the  
subject of impressment. Mr. Monroe says, in a letter addressed to  
Mr. Madison, after the return of the former from England,—‘* The  
idea entertained by the public is, that the rights of the United States  
were abandoned by the American commissioners in the late negocia-  
tion, and that their seamen were left, by tacit acquiescence, if not by  
formal renunciation, to depend, for their safety, on the mercy of the  
British cruisers. I have, on the contrary, always believed, and still  
do believe, that the ground on which that interest was placed by the  
paper of the British commissioners of November &amp;, 1806, and the ex-  
planations which accompanied it, was both honorable and advantageous  
to the United States ; that it contained a concession in their favor, on  
the part of Great-Britain, on the great principle in contestation, never  
before made by a formal and obligatory act of the government, which  
was highly favorable to their interest ; and that it also imposed on her  
the obligation to conform her practice under it, till a more complete  
arrangement should be concluded, to the just claims of the United  
States.”&quot;—‘&#x27; The British paper states that the king * * * had  
directed his commissioners to give to the commissioners of the United  
States the most positive assurances that instructions had been given,  
and should be repeated and enforced, to observe the greatest caution

These were the considerations which recom­
