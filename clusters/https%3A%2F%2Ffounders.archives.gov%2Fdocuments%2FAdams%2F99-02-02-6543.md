		Philadelphia, Novemr. 20th. 1815.  
				  
				I can now answer the questions in your favor of the 30th. July last, viz. Who shall write the history of the American Revolution &amp;c.?Major General James Wilkinson has written it. He commences with the battle of Bunker’s or Breed’s hill at Boston and concludes with the battle near New-Orleans on the Missisippi, a period of forty years. It will be published in three volumes large octavo, each containing about 500 pages.The General (I am informed) confines himself to military transactions, with a reference to a very few of the civil. I knew him personally near forty years ago, but have not seen or heard from him for the last seven years: I think him above mediocrity. He has been in the army during the whole time &amp; is better qualified to give a description of its proceedings than any Gentleman with whom I am acquainted.This history has been written within the last seven or eight months at Germantown about six miles from this city; tho’ I have not heard of the General being there ’till lately: he has kept himself quite retired &amp; private.I do not recollect any formal speeches, such as are made in the British Parliament and our late Congresses, to have been made in the revolutionary Congress, tho’ I was a member for eight years from 1774 until the Preliminaries of peace were signed. We had no time to hear such speeches, little for deliberation; action was the order of the day. The speech of Mr; Richard H. Lee given by the Italian, the Chevalier Botta, which I have read, may have been delivered, but I have no remembrance of it, tho’ in Congress, nor would it do any member much credit: I have no favorable opinion of the Chevalier, he appears to me a vain &amp; presuming character to have attempted such a history; perhaps the res angusta domil (poverty) impelled him.Altho’ we may not in the United States have a Thucidydis, a Tacitus, Hume, Robertson or Gibbon, who have been reckoned the best historians in Greece, Rome or Great Britain, yet we have Gentlemen of great talents and capable of writing the history of our Revolution with at least as much regard to truth as any of them has exhibited.With respect to General Wilkinson I recollect an Anecdote: he was in 1777 an Aid to General Gates, and by him sent to Congress at Yorktown in Pennsylvania with the dispatches, giving an account of the surrender of Sir John Burgoyne &amp; the British army to the Americans at Saratoga; on the way he spent a day at Reading, about fifty miles from Yorktown, with a young Lady from Philadelphia, whom he afterwards married. When the dispatches were read in Congress, propositions were made for paying a proper compliment to the Favorite of General Gates, who brought us such pleasing news.Governor Samuel Adams, with a grave &amp; solemn face, moved Congress, that the young gentleman should be presented with “a pair of spurs.”What changes in Europe have occurred since I had the pleasure of writing to you last? Lewis 18th. is again on the throne of France, the great Napoleon at the bottom of the wheel, never to rise more, a prisoner for life. The French nation miserable; Spain has re-established the tribunal of the Inquisition and restored the Jesuits. The rulers of Portugal void of common sense. South of America in a state of opposition to the government of Spain, and in all appearance will soon be independent of it. Whatever is right, said Mr; Pope, the first of poets &amp; moralists.I have nothing to do with politics, nor much with any thing else in this world, but I hear &amp; listen. It is said, that James Monro, secretary of State, John Armstrong, late secretary at war, Dewit Clinton, late Mayor of New York, &amp; perhaps Rufus King, now a Senator, will be proposed as candidates for the next Presidency. I do not think the prospect of either or any of them very encouraging.Mr; John Q. Adams has been named, but it is not known whether this may not create jealosy or injure him with the present administration, which his friends would by all means avoid.My sheet is almost finished. God bless you.Your old friend,

Philadelphia, Nov. 20, 1815.  
  
Dear Srr—I can now answer the questions in  
your favor of the 30th of July, viz. Who shall  
write the history of the American revolution,  
&amp;e.?  
  
Major general James Wilkinson has written it.  
He commences with the battle. of Bunker’s or  
Breed’s Hill, at Boston, and concludes with the  
battle near New-Orleans, on the Mississippi, a  
period of forty years. It will be published in  
three vols. large 8vo. each containing about 500  
pages. ;  
  
The General, I am informed, confines hiniself to  
military tranSactions, with a reference to a very  
  
SAPURDAY; AUGUST 2, 1817.  
  
  
  
71  
  
few of the civil. 1 knew him personally near forty  
years ago, but have not seen or heard from him  
for the last seven years : I think him above me-  
diocrity. .He has been jn the army during the  
whole time, and is better qualified to give a de-  
scription of its proceedings than any gentleman  
with whom I am acquainted.  
  
This history has been written within the last  
seven or eight months, at Germantown, about  
six-miles ‘from this city ; though I have not heard  
of the General being there until lately : he has  
kept himself quite retired and private. ;  
  
I do not recollect on 4 formal speeches, . such as  
are made in the British parliament and our late  
congresses, to have been made in the revolution-  
ary congress, though I was a member for eight  
years, from 1774 until the preliminaries of peace  
were signed. We had no time to hear such  
speeches: little for deliberation : action was the  
order of the day. The speech of Mr. Richard  
K. Lee, given by the Italian, the Chevalier Bot.  
ta, which I have read, may have been delivered,  
but I have no remembrance of it, though in con-  
gress, nor would it do any member much credit :  
I have no favorable opinion of the Chevalier, he  
appears to me a&#x27;vain and presuming character to  
have attempted such a history; perhaps the res an-  
guste domi (poverty) impelled him.  
  
Although we may not in the United States have  
a Thucidydes, a Tacitus, Hume, Robertson or  
Gibbon, who have been reckoned the best histo-  
rians in Greece, Rome or Great Britain, yet we  
have gentlemen of great talents, and capable of  
writing the history of ‘our revolution with at least  
as much regard to truth as any of them has ex-  
hibited.  
  
With respect to general Wilkinson I recollect  
an anecdote; he was in 1777 an aid to general  
Gates, and by him sent to congress at Yorktown,  
in Pennsylvania, with the despatches, giving an  
account of the surrender of Sir John Burgoyne  
and the British army to the Americans, at Sara-  
toga; on the way he spent a day af Reading, a-  
bout fifty miles from Yorktown, with a young la-  
dy from Philadelphia, whom he afterwards mar-  
ried, When the despatches were read in con-  
gress, propositions were — for paying a pro-  
per compliment to the favorite of general Gites  
who brought us such pleasing news. Governor  
Samuel Adams, with a grave and solemn face,  
moved congress that the young gentleman should  
be presented with “ a pair of spurs.”  
  
What changes in Europe have occurred since }  
had the pleasure of writing to you last! Louis  
18th is again on the throne of France, the great  
Napoleon at the bottom of the wheel, never to  
risé more, a prisoner for life. ‘The French nation  
miserable ; Spain has re-established the tribunal  
of the Inquisition and restored the Jesuits. ‘The  
rulers of Portugal void of common sense. South  
America in a state of opposition to the govern-  
ment of Spain, and in all appearance will soon be  
independent of it. Whatever is is right, said Mr.  
Pope, the first cf poets and moralists.  
  
I have nothing to do with politics, nor much  
with any thing else in this world, but { hear and  
listen. It is said that James Monroe, secretary  
of state, John Armstrong, late secretary of war,  
Dewitt Clinton, late mayor of New-York, and per-  
haps Rufus King, now a senator, will be propo-  
sed as candidates for the next presidency. I do  
  
  
  
not think the prospect of either or any of them  
very encouraging.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
¥2  
  
Mr. John Q. Adams has been named, but it is  
not known whether this may not create jealousy  
or injure him with the present administration,  
which his friends would ¢y all means avoid.
