 to the prejudice of the latter &amp; some things taken for granted as to the former which are at least questionable. Perhaps myself the first, at some expence of popularity, to unfold the true character of Jefferson, it is too late for me to become his apologist. Nor can I have any disposition to do it. I admit that his politics are tinctured with fanaticism, that he is too much in earnest in his democracy, that he has been a mischevous enemy to the principle measures of our past administration, that he is crafty &amp; persevering in his objects, that he is not scrupulous about the means of success, nor very mindful of truth, and that he is a contemptible hypocrite. But it is not true as is alleged that he is an enemy to the power of the Executive, or that he is for confounding all the powers in the House of Rs. It is a fact which I have frequently mentioned that while we were in the administration together he was generally for a large construction of th

e. Nor is it true that Jefferson is zealot enough to do anything in pursuance of his principles which will contravene his popularity, or his interest. He is as likely as any man I know to temporize—to calculate what will be likely to promote his own reputation and advantage; and the probable result of such a temper is the preservation of systems, though originally opposed, which being once established, could not be overturned without danger to the person who did it. To my mind a true estimate of Mr J.’s character warrants the expectation of a temporizing rather than a violent system.

ts that Jefferson would use. The truth is that Burr is a man of a very subtile imagination, and a mind of this make is rarely free from ingenious whimsies. Yet I admit that he has no fixed theory &amp; that his peculiar notions will easily give way to his interest. But is it a recommendation to have no theory? Can that man be a systematic or able statesman who has none? I believe not. No general principles will hardly work much better than erroneous ones.

amusing to read in the same letter from which this last extract is taken his  
opinion of Jefferson, for whom he advises his correspondent to vote in  
preference to Burr. “I admit,” he writes, “that his [Jefferson’s] politics  
are tinctured with fanaticism; . . . that he is crafty and persever-

By the time the House convened to decide the question, Hamilton&#x27;s  
efforts had been effectual, although most of the federalists were strongly  
disposed to vote for Burr, many attributing Hamilton’s course to personal  
enmity or rivalry. Than Jefferson no republican was more offensive to  
them, since to his acts and doctrines the new party mainly owed its ex-  
istence. With Burr the case was somewhat different. While he had  
always acted with the republicans, and had made the election of a repub
