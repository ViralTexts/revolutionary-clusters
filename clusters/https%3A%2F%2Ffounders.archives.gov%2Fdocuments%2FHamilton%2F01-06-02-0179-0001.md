o the Speaker of the House of Representatives]  
In obedience to the Order of the House of Representatives, of the second Instant,  
The Secretary of the Treasury Respectfully Reports,  
That in his opinion, the funds, in the first instance requisite towards the payment of interest on the debits of the individual States, according to the modifications proposed by him in his report of the ninth of January past, may be obtained from the following objects:  
An increase of the general product of the duties on goods imported, by abolishing the discount of ten per Cent allowed by the fifth Section of the Act for laying a duty on goods, wares and merchandizes imported into the United States, in respect to goods imported in American bottoms, and adding ten per Cent to the rates specified, in respect to goods imported in foreign bottoms, with certain exceptions and qualifications: This change, without impairing the commercial policy of the regulation, or making an inconvenient addition to the general rates of the duties, will occasion an augmentation of the revenue little short of two hundred thousand dollars.  
An additional duty on imported Sugars. Sugars are an object of general consumption, and yet constitute a small proportion of the expense of families. A moderate addition to the present rates would not be felt. From the bulkiness of the article, such an addition may be made with due regard to the safety of Collection. The quality of brown and other inferior kinds of Sugar imported, appears to exceed twenty two millions of pounds, which, at a half cent per pound, would produce one hundred and ten thousand dollars. Proportional impositions on foreign refined sugar, and proper drawbacks on exportation, ought of course to indemnify the manufacturers of this article among ourselves.  
Molasses, being in some of the States a substitute for Sugar, a small addition to the duty on that article ought to accompany an increase of the duty on Sugar. This, however, ought to be regulated with proper attention to the circumstance, that the same article will contribute largely in the shape of distilled spirits. Half a Cent per Gallon on Molasses would yield an annual sum of thirty thousand dollars. Our distillers of Spirits, from this material, may be compensated by a proportional extension of the duty on imported spirits.  
Snuff, and other manufactured tobacco, made within the United States: Ten Cents per pound on the Snuff, and six Cents on other kinds of manufactured tobacco, would be likely to produce annually, from ninety to one hundred thousand dollars. From as good evidence as the nature of the case will admit, the quantity of these articles, manufactured in the United States, may be computed to exceed a million and a half of pounds. The imposition of this duty would require an increase of the duty on importation, and a drawback on exportation, in favor of the manufacture. This, being an absolute superfluity, is the fairest object of revenue that can be imagined, and may be so regulated, as, in no degree, to injure either the growth or manufacture of the Commodity.  
Pepper, Pimento, Spices in general, and various other kinds of groceries. These articles will bear such additional rates, as may be estimated to yield a sum of not less than thirty thousand dollars. Computing, according to the entries in the State of New York, in 1788, the yearly quantity of pepper, and pimento brought into the United States, is not less than eight hundred thousand pounds, of which about a third is pepper. Six Cents on pepper, and four cents on pimento (with drawbacks on exportation) may, without inconvenience be laid.  
Salt. An additional duty of six cents per bushel, may, in the judgment of the Secretary, with propriety be laid on this Article. It is one of those objects, which, being consumed by all, will be most productive, and yet, from the smallness of the quantity in which it is consumed by any, and of the price, will be least burthensome, if confined within reasonable limits. If a government does not avail itself, to a proper extent, of resources like these, it must of necessity overcharge others, and particularly, give greater scope to direct taxation. The quantity of this article annually imported, being at least, a million and a half of bushels, the annual product of an additional duty of six Cents may be computed at ninety thousand dollars.  
Carriages, such as Coaches, Chariots &amp;c. These articles may certainly be the subject of a considerable duty. How productive it would be, is not easy to be estimated. But it is imagined, that it would yield not less than fifty thousand dollars per annum.  
Licences to practisers of the law. Certain law-writings, and various kinds of writings. The extent of this resource can only be determined upon trial; but the Secretary feels a strong assurance, that there may be drawn from it, yearly, not less than two hundred thousand dollars. The system for collecting a duty of this kind, would embrace playing-cards, and some other objects of luxury, which do not fall under the above descriptions, but which are estimated in the supposed product.  
Sales at Auction (exclusive of houses or lands, or of those made in consequence of legal process, or of acknowledged insolvency). One per Cent on such Sales would, probably, produce a yearly sum of forty or fifty thousand dollars.  
Wines and Spirits sold at retail. These articles are, in the opinion of the Secretary, capable of being rendered far more productive, than has been generally contemplated; and they are certainly, among the most unexceptionable objects of Revenue. It is presumed, that two hundred thousand dollars per annum may, with facility, be collected from the Retail vent of these Articles.  
The foregoing objects are those, which appear to the Secretary, preferable towards a provision for the debts of the individual States. There are others, which have occurred to him as supplementary, in case the experiment should discover a deficiency in the expected product; but which, he conceives it unnecessary now to detail. He will only add, that he entertains no doubt of it’s being practicable to accomplish the end, on the principles of his former report, without the necessity of taxing, either houses or lands, or the stock or the produce of farms.  
The Secretary, conceiving the design of the House to have been to obtain from him a general delineation only of the funds, competent in his judgment to the provision in question, has refrained from those details, which would be indispensible, if that provision were immediately to be made; and to have furnished which, would have occasioned greater delay, than would, probably, have suited with the present state of the business, or the Convenience of the House. He, with great deference, trusts, that what is now offered will be deemed a satisfactory compliance with their Order.  
The Statement required respecting the product of the duties on imports and tonnage to the last of December, as far as returns have come to hand, is contained in the Schedule herewith.  
All which is humbly submitted

An increase of the general produtt of the duties on goods im­

fifth feftion of the A6l for laying a duty on goods, wares, and mer­  
chandize, imported into the United States, in refpett to goods im­

fpecified, in refpett to goods imported in foreign bottoms, with  
certain exceptions and t qualifications : This change, without im­  
pairing the commercial policy of the regulation, or making an in­  
convenient addition to the general rates of the duties, will occasion  
an augmentation of the revenue little short of two hundred thou­  
sand dollars.  
  
An additional duty on imported sugars. Sugars arc an objett  
of general csnfumption : and yet constitute a small proportion of  
the expence of families. A moderate addition to the present rates  
would not be felt. From the bulkinefs of the article too, such an  
addition may be made with due regard to tfce fafety of collcftion.  
The quantity of brown and other inferior kinds of sugar import­  
ed, appears to exceed twenty-two millions of pounds, which at a  
half cent per pound, would produce one hundred dnd ten thou­  
sand dollars. Proportional impositions on foreign refined iugar,  
nnd proper diawbacks on exportation, ought of courfc to indem­  
nify the manufacturers of this article among ourselves.  
MolafTes, being in some of the States a substitute for sugar, a

an increase of the duty on sugar. This, however ought to be re­  
gulated with proper attention to the circumflance, that the fame  
article will contribute largely in the fliape of distilled spirits.  
Half a cent per gallon on molafle«, would yield an annual sum of  
thirty thousand dollars. Our distillers of spirits from this mate­  
rial, may be compensated, by a proportional extenfionof thedu­  
ty on imported spirits.  
Snuff, and other manufactured tobacco, made within the Uni­  
ted States : Ten cents per pound on the Snuff, and fix cents on  
other kinds of manufactured tobacco, would be likely to produce  
annually, from ninety to one hundred thousand dollars. From  
as good evidence as the nature of the cafe will admit, the quan­  
tity of these articles manufactured in the United States, may be  
computed to exceed a milion and a half of pounds. The impo­  
sition of this duty would require an increase of the duty on im­  
portation, and a drawback on exportation, in favor of the manu­  
facture. Thi* being an absolute fuperfluity, is the faireft objeCt of  
revenue that can be imagined, and maybe so regulated, as in n«  
degree, to injury either the growth, or manufacture of the com­  
modity  
  
Pepper, pimento, spices in general, and various other kinds of  
groceries. Thrfe articles will bear such additional rates, as may  
be eft i mated to yield a sum of not less than thirty thousand dollars.

Computing according to the entries in the State of New-York, in  
1788, thcyearly quantity of pepper and pimento brought into the

In obedience to the Order of the House of

the Secretary of the Treajury refpecifully

gars. Sugars are an obje&amp;t of general  
consumption : And yet constitute a  
small proportion of the expense of fa­  
milies. A moderate addition to the  
present rates would not be felt. From  
the bulkiness of the article too, such an  
addition may be made with due regard  
to the fafety of collection. The quanti­  
ty of brown and other inferior kinds of  
sugar imported, appears to exceed  
twenty-two millions of pounds, which  
at a half cent. per pound, would pro­  
duce one hundred and ten thousand  
dollars. Proportional impositions on  
foreign refined sugar, and proper draw­  
backs on exportation, ought of course  
to indemnify the manufatturers of this  
article among ourselves. A  
Molafies, being in some of the States  
a substitute for sugar, a {mall addition  
to the duty on that article, ought to  
accompany an increase of the duty on  
sugar. ‘This, however, ought to be  
regulated with proper attention to the  
circumstance, that the fame ariicle will  
contribute largely in the shape of dis­  
tilled spirits. Half a cent per galion  
on molailes, would yield an annual sum  
of thirty thousand dellars.. Our distil­  
lers of {pirits from this material, may  
be compensated, by a proportional ex­  
tension of the duty on imported spirits.  
Snuff, and other manufaétured to­  
bacco, made within the United States :  
&quot;T&#x27;en cents per pound on the Snuff, and  
fix cents on other kinds of manufactured  
tobacco, would be likely to produce an­  
nually, from ninety to one hundred  
thousand dollars. From as good evi­  
dence as the nature of the cate will ad­  
mit, the quantity of these articles ma­  
nufa&amp;ured in the United States may  
be computed to exceed a million and a  
half of pounds. The imposition of this  
duty would require anincreafe ofduty on  
importation, and a drawback on export­  
ation, in favour of the manufature.—  
This being an absolute fuperfluity, is  
the faireft obje&amp; of revenue that can be  
imagined, and may be so regulated, as  
in no degree to injure either the growth  
or manufacture of the commodity.  
Pepper, pimenta, spices in general,  
and various other kinds of groceries.  
‘Thefe articles will bear such additional  
rates, as may be estimated to yield a sum  
nnat less than thirty thousand dollars.  
Computing according to the entries in  
the State of New-York, in 1788, the  
yearly quantity of pepper and pimenta  
brought into the States, is not less than  
eight hundred thousand pounds, of  
whichabout a third is pepper. Six cents  
on pepper, and four cents on pimenta  
(with drawbacks on exportation) may  
without inconvenience be laid.  
Salt. An additional duty of fix cents  
per bushel, may in the judgment of the  
Secretary, with propriety be laid on this  
article. It is one of those obje&amp;ts which  
being consumed by all, will be most pro­  
duétive, and yet from the smallness of  
quantity in whichitis consumed by any,  
and of the price, will be least burthen­  
fome, if confined within reasonable lim­  
its. If a government does not avail it=  
felf, to a proper extent, of resources  
like these, it must of neceflity overcharge  
others, and particularly, give greater  
scope todiret taxation. The quantity  
of this article, annually imported, being  
at least a million and a haif of bushels,  
the annual produét of an additional du­  
ty of fix cents may be computed at  
ninety thousand dollars.  
- Carriages, such as coaches, chariots,  
&amp;c. These articles may certainly be  
the fubje@ of a considerable duty. How  
.grodu&amp;ive it would be, is not easily to  
e estimated. But it is imagined, that  
it would not yield less than fifty thou­  
sand dollars per annum.  
Licenses to praisers of the law.  
Certain law proceedings, and various  
kinds of writings. The extent of this  
resource can only be determined upon  
trial ; but the Secretary feels a strong  
aflurance, that there may be drawn  
from it yearly, not less than two hun­  
dred thousand dollars. The system for  
collefling a duty of the kind, would  
embrace playing cards, and some other  
objeéts of luxury, which do not fall  
under the above descriptions, but which  
are estimated in the supposed produ&amp;t,  
  
Sales at auétion (exclusive of houses  
or lands, or those made in consequence  
of legal process, or of acknowledged  
insolvency.) One per cent. on such  
sales, would, probably, produce a year­  
ly sum of forty or fitty thousand dollars.  
Wines and {pirits fold at retail. Thhefe  
articls are in the opinion of the Secre­  
tary, capable of being rendered far  
more produétive, than has been gene­  
rally contemplated ; and they are, cer­  
tainly, among the most unexceptiona­  
ble objeéts of revenue. It is presumed,  
that two hundred thousand dollars per  
annum, may, with facility be colletted  
from the retailvent of these articles.  
The foregoing objets, are those,  
which appear to the Secretary, prefer­  
able towards a provision for the debts  
of the individual States. There are  
others which have occured to him as  
supplementary, in case the experiment  
should discover a deficiency in the ex­  
pected produét : but which he conceives  
it unneceflary now to detail. He will  
only add, that he entertains no doubt  
of its being praéticable to accemplifh  
the end, on the principles of his form­  
er report, without the neceflity of tax­  
ing, either houses or lands, or the stock  
or produce of farms.  
The Secretary conceiving the design  
of the House to have been to obtain  
from him a general delineation only of  
the funds, competent in his judgment  
to the provision in question, has re­  
frained from those details, which would  
be indispensable, if that provilion were  
immediately to be made ; and to have  
furnifhed which would have occasioned  
greater delay than would, probably,  
have suited with the present state of the  
business or the convenience of the  
House. He with great defference trusts,  
that what is now offered will be deem­  
ed a fatisfaCtory compliance with their  
order. :  
The statement required refpefting  
the produ&amp; of the duties on imports  
and tonnage to the last of December,  
as far as returns have come to hand, is  
contained in the {chedule herewith pre­  
sented. )

The faid report is in the words fol*  
lowing :  
Treasury Defartment, March a.  
1790.  
In obedience to the order of the houfe of  
prefentathies, of the id infant,  
^HE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY  
Refpenfully Reports,  
That in his opinion, the funds in  
the firft inftance requifite towards  
the payment of intereft on the debts of  
the individual dates, according to the  
modifications propofed by him in his  
report of the 9th of January pad, may  
be obtained from the following ohjceds :  
An increafe of the general prodiid of  
the duties on goods imported, by abo-  
lilhing the diCcount often ()cr cent, al­  
lowed by the fiftli fedion of the aid for  
laying a duty on goods, wares, and mcr-  
chandiics, imported into the United  
States, in refped to goods imported in  
American bottoms, and adding ten per  
cent, to the rates fpcciheJ in refpecl to  
goods imported in foreign bottoms,  
W’ith certain exceptions and qualifieati-  
ons ; This change, without inipai ing  
the commercial policy of the regnlati-  
en, or making an inconvenient aildiiicn  
to the general rates of the duties, will  
occafion an augmentation of the reve  
Tiue little (hortof 200,000 dollars.  
An additional duty on imported fii-  
gars. Sugars are an objed of general  
coniumption ; and yet conllitnte a I’mall  
propoitionof the expdnce of families.  
A moderate addition to the prclent  
rates would not he felt. From the bnl ki*  
nefs of the article too, fiirh an additi­  
on may be made with due regard to the  
faiety of colledion. The quantity of  
brown and other inferior kinds of fu-  
gars imported, a])pears to exceed twen­  
ty-two millions of pounds, whirl), at  
a half cent per pound, would produce  
one hnnJi&#x27;cd and ten tlionfand dollars.  
Proportional impofitious on foreign re­  
fined fiigar, and proper d) av&#x27;hacks on  
expo) tatinn, ought of courl&#x27;e to indeni-  
nify the maaufadurers of this article  
among ourfelves.  
  
Mohdres, being in fomc dates a fub-  
llicute for lugar, a Imall addition to the  
duty on that article, ouglit to uccohi-  
pany an increafe of the duty on iugar.  
This, however, ought to be reguuied  
with pi&#x27;opcr attention to the ctreum-  
(lance, that the lame article will con­  
tribute largely in the ihape of dillilled  
fpirits. Hall a cent per gallon on nio-  
lalfes, would yield an annual fum of  
thinly thouiand dollars. Our diltillers  
of Ipirits from tins material, may be  
compenfated by a proportional extenlion  
ol the duty on imported fpirits.  
bnuff, and other mannfariured lobac-  
to, made within the United States.—  
Ten cents per pound on the fnulf, and  
fix cents on other kinds of manufaclured  
tobacco, would fie likely to produce an-  
irually, from ninety to onehundn d thou-  
fanJ dollars. I^rom its good evidence  
as tlie nature of the cafe will admit, the  
■quantity of tliefe af^ticlcs mnnutactured  
in the United States may be computed  
to exceed a million and a’half of pounds.  
1 he impoliiion of this uuty would re­  
quire an increafe of the duty on im­  
portation, and a drawback on exporta­  
tion, in faw&#x27;our ol tha manufiufliirer.  
^ his being an abfolute fupcrflnity, is the  
faireil objcift of revenue that can be  
imagined, and may be fo regulated, as  
in no degree to injure either the growth  
or manutaAure of the commodity.  
Pepper, pimento, fpiees in general,  
aftd various &quot;other kinds ol groceries.  
Thefe articles will bear luch additional  
rates as may be enimated to yield a fum  
riot lefs than thirty thoii&#x27;knd dollars.  
Completing according to the- entries in  
the (late of New-Yo-k, in 1788, the  
yearly quantity of pepper and pimento  
brought into the Uniti d Stares, is not  
lefi&gt; than eight hundred thoufand  
pounets, n| which about a thlrel is pep-  
pe-r. ^ Six cents on peppgr.and four cents  
on pimento (with drawbacks on export­  
ation) m.ty, without iiiconvcnicnce, be  
laid.  
Salt. An aiJdltional duty of fix cents  
per bufiiel,may in the judgement ol&#x27;ilie  
fecretary, with propriety belaid on this  
article. It is one of thofc objefls which,  
being confitmed by all, will bemofl pro-  
dudlive, and ye^ from the fniallnefs of  
the qu.intily in which it is coniimietl by  
any, and of the price, will be Icall bnr-  
thenfomc, if confined within rctifonttble  
limits. If a government does not avail  
itfelf, to a proper extent, of rcfonrccs  
like thefe, it mud of ncccdity,overcharge  
others, and particularly, give gitaler  
fcopc to direft taxation. The quantity  
of cltis article annually imported, hiring  
at Ictill a millirm and a half of hiifliels,  
the annual prodndl of an ;u!ditinual  
duty of lix cents, may be contptued .-it  
ninety thon.&#x27;and d .llais.  
Caniages, fuch as coaches, rharints^  
tic. Thefe articles may ccrtainlv be  
the fuhjeft of a confiderahlc duty How  
productive it would he, is not ealV to  
be eKimated. lint it is imagined, that  
it would yield not lels than fifty thou­  
fand dollars per anntim.  
Licenfes to praftifers of the law.—.  
Ccittiin law procccd!ng.s, and various  
kinds of wiiiiiigs» Tlie extent of this  
refonree can only be determined upon  
trial; but the (ecrctary feels a (Iroiig  
afTiirancc, that tliere may be drawn froin  
it, yearly, not lels than two hundred &#x27;  
thotifiind dollars. Tlie fy’flem for col-  
leftitig a duty of this kind, wonUl em­  
brace playing ctird -, and fomc other ob-  
jeCls of luxury, which do not fill under  
the above deferiptious, but which are

or lands,or of ihofe uiadc in confe(|nence

of revenue. It is prefumed that two  
hundred tliouland dollars per annum  
may, with lacility, he collected from the  
retail vent of thefe articles.

ftape of drilled (pirits. Half  
a cent per galcn on molaf-  
jes, would yield an annual  
fum thirty thoufand dollars.  
Our diuillers or Ipints from.  
th&#x27;S material, may be compen-  
iated by a proportional exten-  
tion of the duty on imported  
tpnits.

0:1 other kinds of manufactured  
tobacco, Would be likely to  
produce annually, from nine-  
ty to one hundred thoufand  
dollars. From as good evi-  
dence as the nature of the cafe  
will admit, the quantity of thele  
articles manufactured in the  
United States, may be compu-  
ted to excetd a million and an  
half of pounds. The impoh-  
tion of this duty would require  
an encfafe of the duty on  
importation, and a drawback  
on exportation, in favour of the  
.™..nuiafture. This being an ab-  
  
fojtttfe fuperfimty, is the faireft  
object of r-s venue that can be  
imagined and may be lo re-  
guiaied, as in no degree to in-  
jure eithef the gro^ih or ma-  
nifucture of the commodity.

bear fucjl add&#x27;tionaj rates, as  
may be eftimated to yield a  
fum of not lei&#x27;s than thirty  
thouland dollars. Computing  
aecoidmg to the entries in the  
ftate of New- York, in one thou-  
land feven hundred and eigh-  
ty -eight, the yearly quantity of  
pepper and p:mento brought  
into the United States, is not  
lefs than eight hundred thou  
fand pounds, for which nbout  
a third is pepper. Six cents  
on pepper, and four cents on  
pimento fwith draw backs on  
exportation^) may, without in-  
convenience, be laid.  
  
Salt. An additional duty of  
fix cents per bufaell, may, in  
the judgment of the Secieta-  
ry, with propriety be laid on  
this article, it is one of thofe  
objects which beinu; confumed  
by all, will be rrn.il productive,  
and yet from the frpalinefs of  
the quantity in which it is  
confumed by an\, and of the  
price, wif] be lea I burthen

proper extent of relources like

give greater fcope to direct  
taxation. The q-iantity of this  
article annually imported, be  
ing at ii2.it a miJtori and a half  
of bufhels, the annual product  
of an addticu ;1 duty of fix cetiti  
&quot;may be computed at ninety  
thoufand dollars  
  
CarrL&#x27;r&lt;.e«, fuch as coaclics, chairs,

be the IttbjeA of a confuierable duty.  
How prod u&lt;5l 1 vti it Would be, is not

gined, that it would yield not lefs  
than fifty the U food dollars per annum.

kmdi of writings; The extent of thi3  
tefowce can onfy be dete. mined upon  
trial i but tba Secretary feels a ftrong  
affluence, that there may be drawn  
from it, yearly not lefs than two hun-  
dred thoufand dollars. The fyfterri  
for collfefting a duty of this kind, wonldi  
embrace playing caids, 2nd fcrea othej
