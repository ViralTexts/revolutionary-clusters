Provided that none of the said duties shall be applied to any other purpose than the discharge of the interest or principals of the debts which shall have been contracted on the faith of the U.

S. in Congs. assd. alone and in case any State shall not make such appt. within  after notice given for that purpose, the appointmt may then be made by the U. S. in Congs. assd.  
That it be further recommended to the several States to establish for a like term not exceeding 25 years, and to appropriate to the discharge of the Interest &amp; principal of the debts which shall have been contracted on the faith of the U.S. for supporting the present war, substantial &amp; effectual revenues of such nature as they may respectively judge most convenient to the amount of  and in the proportions following, viz.  
That an annual account of the proceeds and application of the aforementioned revenues shall be made out &amp; transmitted to the several states distinguishing the proceeds of each of the specified articles, &amp; the amount of the whole revenue received from each State.  
the said revenues to be collected by persons appointed as aforesaid; but to be carried to the separate credit of the States within wch. they shall be collected, and be liquidated &amp; adjusted among the States according to the quotas which may from time to time be allotted to them:

S. in Congs. assembd.; provided that after the unanimous accession to all the said preceding resolutions, the proposed alteration in the 8th. of the Articles of Confederation shall not hereafter be revoked or varied otherwise than as is pointed out in the 13th. of the Said articles.  
That as a further mean[s] as well of hastening the extinguishment of the debts, as of establishing the harmony of the U. States it be recommended to the States which have passed no acts towards complying with the Resolutions of Congs. of the 6 of Sepr. &amp; 10 of Ocr. 1780, relative to territorial cessions, to make the liberal cessions therein recommended, and to the States wch. may have passed acts complying with the said resolutions in part only, to revise and complete such compliances.  
That in order to remove all objections agst. a retrospective application of the constitutional rule of proportioning to the Several States the charges &amp; expences which shall have been supplied for the common defence or general welfare, it be recommended to them to enable Congress to make such equitable exceptions and abatements as the particular circumstances of the States from time to time during the war may be f
