CHARLESTON, S. C.  
  
April 11th, 1833.  
  
  
At the period of the Revolution of the Acordada, which compelled the Congress of  
Mexico to reverse the election of Pedraza and place Guerrero in the Presidential Chair, the City was taken by assault, and  
the army of Guerrero attacked and plundered the houses of the European Spaniards, who are peculiarly odious to the native  
Mexicans. Many of these persons had taken refuge in the house of the American Ambassador, and it was pointed out to the  
exasperated soldiery as the asylum of their enemies. They rushed to attack it, and in a few minutes would have massacred  
all within its walls. At this moment, when hundreds of muskets were levelled at the windows, Mr.  
Poinsett, with his Secretary of Legation, Mr. John Mason, Jr. threw themselves into  
an open balcony which overlooked the crowd, and unfurling the STAR-SPANGLED BANNER, demanded that all persons in his house  
should be protected while the flag of his country waved over them. The scene changed as by enchantment; and the very men  
who were about to make the attack, cheered the Standard of our Union, and placed sentinels to  
guard it from outrage. The history of the world presents no parallel to such a scene: and its moral beauty and grandeur  
should be equally preserved on the page of the historian and the canvass of the painter. It is therefore proposed to raise  
by subscription a sufficient sum to have this illustrious triumph of our National Flag  
represented on canvass and afterwards engraved. The painting will be presented to some public  
institution of the State or United States.  
The minute particulars attending the unfurling of the United States Flag at Mexico, furnish materials for a  
splendid National Painting. The sectional excitements, at present existing among the States, are obliterating national  
feelings. These must be revived; the arts are powerful in their operation, and lasting in their influence. We must have  
National Paintings, National Songs, National Celebrations, to excite and perpetuate National enthusiasm. Though it is  
difficult for the mind to calculate the value of the Union, yet the hand of a master may successfully exhibit to a single  
glance, that National protection, which, like the pressure of the atmosphere, though omnipresent and powerful, is neither  
seen nor felt. The Flag of every country is its emblem. It should command respect  
abroad--adoration at home. The man who loves and reveres not his Country’s Flag, is prepared to violate her laws and  
destroy her institutions. To pourtray then the Star Spangled Banner overawing in a foreign land, an enfuriated and lawless  
soldiery, and protecting from revolutionary violence the objects of political hatred--is to spread before the eyes of our  
countrymen, and particularly of the rising generation, the unseen, but high moral protection afforded by a great, because  
a United People. The chief object however, is to have this scene engraved, that the Flag of our  
Country may wave in every house, in every cottage, even in every log-house beyond the Mountains; that our children may  
learn, before they can read, to love and reverence the emblem of their country’s power, and may realize that it is their  
guardian and protector, not only on their native soil, but in a land of strangers.

an example and a model to those who are striving to establish  
free institutions, and that whatever endangers its existence puts  
to hazard the liberties of the world. Wherever L have been I

NATIONAL PAINTING&quot;.  
Circular.  
Charleston, S. C, April 1 1th, 1833.  
At the period of the revolution of the Acordada, which  
compelled the Congress of Mexico to reverse the election  
of Pcdraza and place Guerrero in the Presidential Chair,  
the city was taken by assault, and the army of Guerrero  
attacked and plundered, the house of the European  
Spaniards, who were peculiarly odious to the native  
Mexicans. Many of thbse had taken refuge in the  
house bf the American Ambassador, and it was pointed  
out to the exasperated soldiery As the asylum of their  
enemies. They rushed to attack it, and in a few min­  
utes would have Massacred all within its walls. At  
this moment, when hundreds of muskets were levcllnrl  
at the windows, Mr. Poinsett, with his Secretary of  
Legation, Mr. Jobs Mason, jr. threw themselves into  
an open balcony which overlooked the crowd, and un  
furling the STAR SPANGLED BANNER, demanded  
that all persons lp this house Should be protected while  
the flag of his country waved over them. The scene  
changed as by enchantment, arid the very men who  
were about to make the attack cheered the Standard of  
our Union, and placed sentinels td guard it from outrage.  
The history of the world presents no parallel to such a  
scene ; and its moral beauty and grand ucr should be  
equally preserved on thfe page of the historian and the  
canvass of the painter. It is therefore proposed to raise  
by subscription a sufficient sum to have thit illustrious  
triumph of our National Flag represented on canvass and  
afterwards engraved. The painting will be presented  
to some public institution of the State or United States.  
The minute particulars attending the unfurling of the  
United States flag at Mexico, furnish mcterials for a  
splendid National Painting. The sectional excitements  
at the present existing among the States, are obliterating  
National feelings. These must be revived ; the arts  
are powerful in their operation, and lasting in their  
influence. We must have National Paintings, National  
Songs, National Celebrations,&#x27; to excite and perpetuate  
National enthusiasm. Though it is difficult for the  
mind to calculate the value of the Union, yet the hand  
of 9, mastermJ Successfully exhibit to a single glance,  
  
that national protection, which, like the pressure of the  
atmosphere, though omnipresent and powerful, is neither  
seen nor felt. The Flag of every country is its emblem.  
It should command respect abroad adoration at home.  
The man who loves and reveres not his country&#x27;s Flag,  
is prepared to violate her laws and destroy her institu­  
tions. ,. Td portray then the Star Spangled Banner  
overawing, in foreign land, an infuriated and lawless  
soldiery, and protecting from revolutionary violence the  
objects of political hatred is to spread before the eyes  
of .our countrymen; and particularly of the rising gene­  
ration, the iirlseenj but high moral protection afforded by  
a great, because a iihtted People. The chief object,  
however, is to have this Scene engraved; that the Flag  
of our Country may wave In every house; in every cot­  
tage, even every log&#x27; house beyond the mountains ; that  
our children may learrt before they canresd (0 love and  
reverence the emblerri of their country&#x27;s power) and may  
realize that it is their guardian and protector, not only  
  
on their native soil, but in a (arid of strangers.

on the smoke-dimmed air the proud form of  
the &quot;Star Spangled Banner.&quot; It was a glo­  
rious triumph of a still more glorious emblem.  
The flag of every country is its emblem. It  
commands respect abroad as well as at home.  
The man who loves and reveres not his coun­  
try&#x27;s flag is prepared to violate its laws and de­  
stroy its institutions. Hence the importance  
that the nationol banner should wave in every  
house, in every cottage, and in every log cabin,  
that our children may learn before they can  
read to love and reverence the emblem of their  
country&#x27;s power, and fully realize that it is  
their guardian and protector, not only on their  
native soil, but in the land of strangers.
