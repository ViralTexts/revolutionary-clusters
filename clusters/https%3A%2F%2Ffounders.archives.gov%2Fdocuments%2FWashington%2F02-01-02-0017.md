From your bright sparkling Eyes, I was undone;  
Rays, you have, more transparent than the sun,  
Amidst its glory in the rising Day,  
None can you equal in your bright arrays;  
Constant in your calm and unspotted Mind;  
Equal to all, but will to none Prove kind,  
So knowing, seldom one so Young, you’l Find.  
Ah! woe’s me, that I should Love and conceal,  
Long have I wish’d, but never dare reveal,  
Even though severely Loves Pains I feel;  
Xerxes that great, was’t free from Cupids Dart,  
And all the greatest Heroes, felt the smart.

the slightest comparison  
One of the original poems has recently been  
discovered to be an acrostic, which was a fash­  
lonable trick of love making in those days,  
and the initial letters of the lines form the  
name &quot;Frances Alexa&quot;- the last word evi­  
dently being intended for &quot;Alexander.&quot; But  
the poem is unfinished, the remainder

paper or magazine, perhaps from a  
book, without credit or reference to  
their authorship. But the boy who  
wrote the other two could not possibly  
have written these. One of the original  
poems has recently been discovered to  
be an acrostic, which was a fashion­  
able trick of love making in those days,  
and the Initial letter of the lines form  
the name * ’Frances Alexa * the last  
word evidently being intended for  
&quot;Alexander.” But the poem is unfin­  
ished, the remainder of the page on  
which it is written being blank. The  
muse of the youthful poet and lover  
probably became weary. It reads as  
follows;  
From your bright sparkling eyes 1 was  
undone;  
Rays, you have more transparent than  
the sun,  
A midst its glory in the rising Day,  
None can you equal in your bright ar­  
array;  
Constant in your calm and unspotted  
mind;  
Equal to all, but will to none prove  
kind.  
So, knowing, seldom One so Young,  
you’ll Find.
