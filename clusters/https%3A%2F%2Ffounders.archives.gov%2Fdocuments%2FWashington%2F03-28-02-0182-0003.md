Sir  
Salem [N.Y.] the 24th Sept. 1780.  
  
What I have as yet Said concerning myself was in the justifiable attempt to be extricated; I am too little accustomed to duplicity to have Succeeded.  
I beg your Excellency will be persuaded that no Alteration in the Temper of my Mind or Apprehension for my Safety, induces me to Take the Step of Adressing you, but that it is to rescue myself from an imputation of having assumed a mean Character for treacherous purposes or Self Interest, a Conduct incompatible with the principles that actuate me, as well as with my Condition in Life.  
It is to vindicate my Fame that I Speak and not to Sollicit Security.  
The person in your possession is Major John André Adjutant General to the British Army.  
The influence of one Commander in the Army of his Adversary is an Advantage taken in War. A Correspondence for this purpose I held; as confidential (in the present Instance) with His Excellency Sir Henry Clinton.  
To favour it I agreed to meet upon ground not within posts of either Army a person who was to give me Intelligence; I came up in the Vulture M. of War for this Effect and was fetched by a Boat from the Shore to the beach; Being there I was told that the Approach of day would prevent  my return and that I must be concealed until the next night. I was in my Regimentals and had fairly risked my person.  
Against my Stipulation my Intention &amp; without my Knowledge before hand I was conducted within one of your posts. Your Excellency may conceive my Sensations on this Occasion &amp; will imagine how much more I must have been affected, by a refusal to reconduct me back the next night as I had been brought. Thus become a prisoner I had to concert my Escape. I quitted my Uniform &amp; was passd another way in the Night without the American posts to Neutral ground, inform’d I was beyond all arm’d parties and left to press for N: York. I was taken at Tarry Town by some Volunteers.  
Thus as I have had the honour to relate was I betrayd (being Adjutant General of the B. Army) into the Vile Condition of an Enemy in disguise within your Posts.  
Having avowd my Self a British Officer I have nothing to reveal but what relates to myself which is true on the honour of an Officer and a Gentleman.  
The Request I have to make to Your Excellency and I am conscious I address myself well, is that in any rigor, policy May dictate a decency of Conduct towards me may mark that tho’ unfortunate I am branded with nothing dishonorable as no motive could be mine but the Service of my King and as I was involuntarily an impostor.  
Another request is that I may be permitted to write an Open Letter to Sir Henry Clinton and another to a friend for Clothes &amp; Linnen.  
I take the Liberty to mention the Condition of some Gentlemen at Charlestown who being either on parole or under protection were engaged in a Conspiracy against us. Tho’ their Situation is not Similar, they are objects who may be Set in Exchange for me or are persons whom the Treatment I receive might affect.  
It is no less Sir in a Confidence in the Generosity of your mind than on account of your Superior Station that I have chosen to importune you with this Letter. I have the hono⟨ur⟩ to be with great Respect Sir Your Excellencys Most obedt &amp; Most humble Servant

&lt;&lt; SIR, Salem, Sept. 24, 1720.  
WHAT I have as yet faid concerning  
myiclf, was in the juitifiable attempt to  
be extricated ; I am too little accuitomed  
to duplicity to have fucceeded.  
{ beg your Excellency will be per-  
fuaded, that no alteration in the temper  
of my mind, or apprehenfion ‘for my  
  
He-  
  
Majer Andre’s-Letter to Gen. Wathington,  
  
fafety, induces me to take the ftep. of  
addrefling you, but that it is to fecure  
myielf from an imputation of having af-  
fumed a mean charaéter for treacherous  
purpoles or Jelf-intereft ; a conduct in-  
compatible with the principles that ac.  
tuated me, as well as with my condition  
in life. b  
  
It is to vindicate my fame that I {peak,  
and not to folicit fecurity.  
  
The perfon in your poffeifion is Major  
John Andre, Adjutant-General to the  
Britith army.  
  
The influence of one Commander in  
the army of his adverfary, is an advan-  
tage taken in war. A correfpondence  
for this purpoie I held, as confidential (in  
the prefent inftance) with his Excellency  
Sir Henry Clinton.  
  
To favour it, I agreed to meet upon  
ground not with&#x27;n pofts of either army,  
a perfon who was to give me intelligence ;  
I came up in the Vulture man of war for  
this effect, and was fetched by a boat  
from the fhore to the beach: being there,  
I was told that the approach of day would  
prevent my return, and that I mutt be  
concealed until the next night, I was in  
my regimentals, and had fairly rifked  
my perfon.  
  
Again{t my ftipulation, my intention,  
and without my knowledge beforehand,  
T was conducted within one of your pofts.  
Your Excellency may conceive my fen-  
fation on this occafion, and will imagine  
how much more I muit have been affect-  
ed, by a refufal to reconduét me back the  
next night as I had been brought, Thus  
become a prifoner, I had to concert my  
efcape. I quitted my uniform, and was  
pafled another way in the night without  
the American poits to neutral ground ;  
and informed 1 was beyond all armed  
parties, and left to prefs for New York.  
I was taken at Tarry Town by fome  
volunteers,  
  
‘Thus, as I have had the honour to re-  
Jate, was I betrayed (being Adjutant-  
Genera! of the Britith Army) into the  
vile condition of an enemy within your  
polis.  
  
Having avowed myfelf a Britith Offi  
cer, I have nothing to reveal but what  
relates to myfelf, which is true upon the  
honour of an Officer and a Gentleman.  
  
The requefi | have to make to your  
Excellency, and I am confcious J addreis  
myfelf- weil, is, that in any rigour policy  
may digtate, a decency of conduct tc-  
wards me may mark, that though un-  
fortunate, I am branded with nothing

It is to vindicate my fame that I ſpeak, and not to ſolicit

Sir, Salem, 24th Sept E780.  
  
Wuatl have as yet said con-  
cerning myself, was in the justifiable  
attempt to be extricated; I am  
too little accustomed to duplicity  
to have succeeded.  
  
I beg your Excellency will be  
persuaded, that no alteration in the  
temper of my mind, or apprehen-  
sion for my safety, induces me to  
take the step of addressing you ;  
but that it is te secure myself from  
an imputation of having assumed a  
mean character for treacherous  
purposes, or self-interest: a con-  
duct incompatible with the prinei-  
ples that actuated me, as well as  
with my condition in life.  
  
It is to vindicate my fame that £  
speak, and not to solicit security.  
  
The person in your possession is  
Major John André, Adjutant-gene-  
ral to the British army.  
  
The influence ot one commander  
in the army of his adversary, is am  
advantage taken in war. A ear--  
respondence for this purpose £  
held, as confidential (in the present  
instance) with his Excellency Sir  
ilenry Clinton.  
  
To favour it, I agreed to. meet  
upon ground not within posts of  
cither army, a person who was te  
give me intelligence: I came up  
in the Vulture man of war for this  
effect, and was fetched by the boat  
from the shore to the beach: being  
there, I was told, that the approack  
of day would prevent my return.  
and that f must be concealed until  
the next night. Iwas in my regt-  
mentals, and had fairly risked my  
person.  
  
Against my stipulation, my in-  
tention, and without my knowledge  
beforehand, LI was conducted  
within one of your pests. Your  
Excellency may conceive my sen~  
sation on this occasion, and will  
imagine how much more | must  
have been affected, by a refusal to  
re-conduct me back the next night  
  
2M2  
  
  
  
  
  
871  
  
  
  
as I had been brought. Thus be-  
come a prisoner, Fk had to concert  
my escape. I quitted my uniform,  
and was passed another way in  
the night, without the American  
posts, to neutral ground; and be-  
ing informed I was beyond all  
armed parties, and left to press  
for New York, I was taken at  
Tarry-town, by some volunteers.  
  
Thus, as I have had the honour  
to relate, was I betrayed (being  
Adjutant-general of the British  
army) into the vile condition of an  
enemy within your posts.  
  
Having avowed myself a British  
officer, I have nothing to reveal!  
but what relates to myself, which  
is true on the honour of an oflicer,  
and a gentleman.  
  
The request I have made to your  
Excellency, and I am conscious  
that I address myself weil, is, that  
in any rigour policy may dictate, a  
decency of conduct towards me  
may mark, that though unfortunate,  
1 am branded with nothing dis-  
honourable ; as no motive could be  
mine, but the service of my king,  
and as I was involuntarily an im-  
postor.  
  
Another request is, that I may  
be permitted to w rite an open let-  
ter to Sir Henry Clinton, and ano-  
ther to a friend for clothes and  
linen.  
  
I take the liberty to mention the  
condition of some gentiemen a  
Charles-town, who, being either on  
parole, or under protection, were  
engaged in a conspiracy against us.  
Though their situation is not simi-  
jar, they are objects who may be  
sent in exchange for me, or are  
persons whom the treatment I re-  
ceive might affect.  
  
It is no less, Sir, in a confidence  
in the generosity of your mind,  
than on account of your superior  
station, that 1 have chosen to im-  
portune you with this letter.  
  
I have the honour to be, with the

“ Sin :—Wohat I have said concerning myself to my captors was in the justifiable  
attempt to be extricated; I am too little accustomed to duplicity to have succeeded.  
  
I beg your excellency will be persuaded, that no alteration in the temper of my  
mind or apprehension for my safety, induces me to take the step of addressing you;  
but that it is to rescue myself from an imputation of having assumed a mean charac-

It is to vindicate my fame that I speak, and not to solicit security.  
  
The person in your possession is Major John André, Adjutant General to the  
British army.  
  
The influence of one commander in the army of his adversary is an advantage  
taken in war. A correspondence for this purpose I held; as confidential (in the  
present instance) with his excellency Sir Henry Clinton.  
  
To favor it | agreed to meet upon ground not within the posts of either army, a  
person who was to give me intelligence; 1 came up in the Vulture man-of-war for  
this effect, and was fetched by a boat from the ship to the beach. Being there, I  
was told that the approach of day would prevent my return, and that I must be con-  
cealed until the next night. I was in my regimentals, and had fairly risked my  
person.  
  
Against my stipulation, my intention, and without my knowledge beforehand, I  
was conducted within one of your posts. Your excellency may conceive my sensa-  
tion on this occasion, and will imagine how much more must I have been affected  
by a refusal to reconduct me back the next night as I had been brought. Thus be-  
come a prisoner, I had to concert my escape. I quitted my uniform, and was passed  
another way in the night without the American posts, to neutral ground, and in-

formed I was beyond all armed parties, and left to press for New York. I was taken  
  
at T&#x27;arry-town by some volunteers.  
Thus, as I have had the honor to relate, was I betrayed ( being an Adjutant Gene  
  
ral of the British army) into the vile condition of an enemy in disguise within your  
posts.  
  
Having avowed myself a British officer, I have nothing to reveal but what relates  
to myself, which is true on the honor of an officer and a gentleman.  
  
The request I have to make to your excellency, and I am conscious I address my-  
self well, is, that in any rigor, policy may dictate, a decency of conduct towards me  
may mark, that though unfortunate, I am branded with nothing dishonorable, as no  
motive could be mine but the service of my king, and as I was involuntarily an  
  
impostor.  
Another request is, that I may be permitted to write an open letter to Sir Henry  
  
Clinton, and another to a friend for clothes and linen.  
I take the liberty to mention the condition of some gentlemen at Charleston who,  
  
being either on parole or under protection, were engaged in a conspiracy against us.  
Though their situation is not similar, they are objects who may be set in exchange  
  
for me, or are persons whom the treatment I receive might effect.  
It is no less, sir, in a confidence of the generosity of your mind, than on account  
  
of your superior station, that I have chosen to importune you with this letter.  
I have the honor to be with great respect, sir,  
Your Excellency’s most obedient,

Sir,— What I have as yet said concerning myself was in the justifiable  
attempt to be extricated. I am too little accustomed to duplicity to have  
succeeded. I beg your Excellency will be persuaded that no alteration in  
the temper of my mind, or apprehension for my safety, inclines me to  
take the step of addressing you, but that it is to rescue myself from an  
imputation of having assumed a mean character for treacherous purposes  
or self-interest ; a conduct incompatible with the principles that actuate  
me, as well as with my condition in life. It is to vindicate my fame that  
I speak, and not to solicit security. The person in your possession is  
Major John André, Adjutant-General to the British army. The influence  
of one commander in the army of his adversary is an advantage taken  
in war. A correspondence for this purpose I held as confidential (in the  
present instance) with his Excellency Sir Henry Clinton. To favour it I  
agreed to meet, upon ground not within the posts of either party, a  
person who was to give me intelligence. I came up in the ‘ Vulture,’  
man-of-war, for this effect, and was fetched by a boat from the ship to the  
beach. Being there I was told that the approach of day would prevent  
my return, and that I must be concealed until the next night. 1 was in  
my regimentals, and had fairly risked my person. Against-my stipulation,  
my intention, and without my knowledge beforehand, I was conducted  
within one of your posts. Your Excellency will conceive my sensation  
on this occasion, and will imagine how much more must I have been  
afflicted by a refusal to reconduct me back the next night as I had been  
brought. Thus become a prisoner, I had to concert my escape. I quitted  
my uniform and was passed another way in the night without the Ame-  
rican posts to neutral ground, and was informed I was beyond all armed
