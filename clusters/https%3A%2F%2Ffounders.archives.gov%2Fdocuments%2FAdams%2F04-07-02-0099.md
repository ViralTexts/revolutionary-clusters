who will not recollect and find that upon many occasions they have been faulty in this respect, yet must condemn it; in most instances, as a Breach of good Manners and politeness. Nor is a person let; his Learning be ever so extensive and his abilities ever so splendid; capable of rendering himself so usefull to Mankind: if at the same time, he discovers an overbearing and dogmatical disposition. The late Dr Johnson, Author of the Ramblers and compiler of the dictionary was a very striking proof of this assertion, and he plainly discovers his sentiments in an observation which he makes in his Lives of the Poets, “Whoever is apt to hope good from others is diligent to please them, but he who believes his powers strong enough to force their own Way, commonly tries only to please himself.” Pope has juster Ideas upon this Subject and discovers a Greater knowledge of Mankind, which will be best convey’d to you in his own words.  
  
“Tis not enough your counsel should be true  
Blunt Truths more Mischief than nice falshoods do  
  
Men must be taught as if you taught them not  
And things unknown, propos’d as things forgot  
Without good Breeding truth is disapprov’d  
That only makes superiour sense beloved.”
