Dear Sir,  
Mount Vernon February 16 1787  
  
Your favor of the 30th Ulto came duly to hand. To give an opinion in a caus of so much importance as that which has  
  
warmly agitated two branches of your legislature, and which, from the appeal that is made, is likely to create great, and perhaps dangerous divisions, is rather a delicate matter; but as this diversity of opinion is on a subject which has, I beleive, occupied the minds of most men; and as my sentiments thereon have been fully and decidedly expressed long before the Assembly either of Maryland or this State were convened; I do not scruple to declare that, if I had a voice in your Legislature, it would have been given decidedly against a paper emission Upon the general principles of its utility as a representative, and the necessity of it as a medium, and as, far as I have been able to understand its advocates (for the two papers you sent me were the same, and contained no reasons of the House of Delegates for the local want of it in your State, though I have seen, and given them a cursory reading, elsewhere) I should have been very little less opposed to it.  
To assign reasons for this opinion would be as unnecessary as tedious. The ground has been so often trod that a place hardly remains untouched. But, in a word, the necessity, arising from a want of specie greater than it really is, I contend that it is by the substance, not with the shadow of a thing, we are to be benefited. The wisdom of man, in my humble opinion, cannot at this time devise a plan by which the credit of Paper money would be long supported; consequently depreciation keeps pace with the quantum of the emission; and articles for which it is exchanged rise in a greater ratio than the sinking value of the money. wherein then is the Farmer, the Planter, the Artizan benefitted? The debtor may be, because, as I have observed, he gives the shadow in lieu of the substance, and in proportion to his gain, the creditor, or the body politic suffer: for whether it be a legal tender or not, it will, as hath been observed very truly, leave no alternative—it must be that or nothing. An evil equally great is, the door it immediately opens for speculation; by which the least designing, &amp; perhaps most valuable part of the community, are preyed upon by the more knowing and crafty speculators. But contrary to my intention &amp; declaration, I am offering reasons in support of my opinion—reasons too, which of all others, are least pleasing to the advocates for Paper money I shall therefore only observe, generally, that so many people have suffered by former emissions, that, like a burnt child who dreads the fire,  
  
no person will touch it who can possibly avoid it. The natural consequence of which will be, that the specie which remains unexported, will be instantly locked up. With my great esteem and regard—I am Dr Sir your most obed. Servant

Mou.FT Via* ON, Feb. 6,1787.  
  
DEAK SIR: Your favor of the 30th  
ultimo came duly to hand. To give  
an opinion in a case of so much impor­  
tance as that which has warmly agita­  
ted the two branches of your Legisla­  
ture,-and which, from the appeal that  
is made, is likely to create great, and  
perhaps, dangerous divisions, is rather  
a delicate matter but as this diversity  
of opinion is on a subject which has, I  
believe, occupied the minds of most  
men, and as my sentiments thereon  
have been fully and decidedly express­  
ed long before the Assembly either of  
Maryland or of this State was conven­  
ed, I do not scruple to declare that, if  
I had a voice in your Legislature, it  
would have been given decidedly a­  
gainst a paper emission, upon the  
general principles of its inutility as a  
representative and the necessity of it  
as a medium.  
  
To assign reasons for this opinion,  
would be as unnecessary as tedious.—  
The ground has been so eften trod, that  
hardly a place remains untouched in  
a word, the necessity arising from the  
want of specie is represented as great­  
er than it really is. I contend that it  
is by the substance, end not by the  
shadow of a thing, that we are to be  
benefitted. The wisdom of man, in  
my humble opinion, cannot, at this  
time, devise a plan by which the cred­  
it of paper money would be long  
supported consequently, depreciation  
keeps pace with the quantity of the  
emission, and articles for which it is  
exchanged rise in a greater ratio than  
the sinking value of the money.—  
Wherein, then, is the farmer, the plan­  
ter, tie artisan, benefitted? The debt­  
or may be, because, as I observed, he  
gives the shadow instead of the sub­  
stance and, in proportion to his gain,  
the creditor or the body politic suffers.  
Whether it be a legal tender or not, it  
will, as has been observed truly, leave  
no alternative. It must be that or no­  
thing. An evil equally great, is the  
door it immediately} opens for specu­  
lation, by which the least designing,  
and, perhaps, most valuable part of  
the commnnity, are preyed upon by  
  
more knowing and crafty specula-  
  
tors.  
But contrary to my intention and  
declaration, I am offering reasons in  
^support of my opinion—reasons, too,  
.which, of all others, are least pleasing  
&quot;xo the advocates for paper money. I  
&#x27;shall, tharefore, only observe general­  
ly, that so many peopl* hare

suffered  
  
by the former emissions, that, like a  
burnt child who dreads the fire, no per­  
son will touch it who can possibly a­  
void it the natural consequence of  
which will be, that the specie which  
remains unexported will be locked up.

The debtor may be, because as I have observed,  
he gives the shadow instead of the substance ;  
and in proporiion to his gain, the creditor or

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
Mount Vernon, Febuary 10 178G.  
Dear Sir : Your favor of the 30th ult.  
came duly to hand. To give an opinion in  
a cause oi so much unpoftance as that.  
which was warmly acritated ttfc two branch  
es of yuor legislature, and which from the  
appeal that is made, is likely to create great  
anu perhaps dangerous divisions, is rather  
a delicate matter; but, as this devrisity of  
opinion is on a subject, which has, 1 be­  
lieve, occupied the minds of most men, and  
as my sentiments thereon have been fully  
and decidedly expressed long before the as­  
sembly either of Maryland or this state was  
convened, I do not scruple to declare, that,  
if I had a voice in your legislature, it would  
have been given decidedly against a paper  
emission upon the general principles of its  
utility as a representative, and the necessity  
of it as a medium.  
To assign reasons for this opinion would  
be as unnecessary as tedious. The&#x27; ground  
has been so often trod that a place hardly re­  
untouched. In a word the necessity aris­  
ing from a want of specie is, represented as  
greater than it really is T I contend, that it  
is by the substance, not with the shadow of  
a thing, we are to be benefitted. The wis­  
dom of man, in my humble opinion, can­  
not at this time devise a plan, by which the  
credit of paper money would bo loug sup­  
ported; consequently depreciation keeps  
pace with the quantity of the emission, and  
articles, for which it is exchanged, rise in  
a greater ratio than the sinking value of the  
money. Wherein, then is the faamer, the  
planter, the artisan benefitted T The debtor  
may be, because, as I have observed, he  
gives the shadow in lieu of the substance;  
and, in proportion to this gain, the creditor  
or the body politic suffers. Whether it be  
a legal tender or not, it will, as has been ob­  
served very truly, leave no alternative. It  
must be that or nothing. An evil equally  
great is, the dour it immediately opens for  
speculation, by which the least designing,  
and perhaps most valuable part of the com­  
munity are preyed upon by the more know­  
ing and crafty speculators.  
But contrary to my intention and declar­  
ation, I an: offering reasons in support of  
my opinion; reason too, which of all others  
are least pleasit;g to the advocate of my pa­  
per. I shall therefore only observe gener­  
ally, that so many people have suffered by  
former emissions, that, like a burnt child  
who dreads the fire, no person will touoh  
it who can possibly avoid it. The natural  
consequence of which will be, that the spe­  
cie, which remains uncxported, will be in­  
stantly locked up. With great esteem and  
regard,

Diar bir: Your favor of the 30th uit.  
came duly to hand. To cive an opinion in  
a case of so much importance as that which  
has warmly agitated the two branches of  
the minds ol most men. and as my senti  
t--- r -  
ments thereon have been fairly and decided  
ly expressed, long before the Assembly either  
ol Maryland or of this State was convened, I  
do not scruple to declare that, if 1 had  
voice in your legislature it would have been  
given DECIDEDLY AGAINST A PAPER  
EMISSION, upon the general principlesof its  
utility as a representative, and the necessity  
of it as a mediu n.  
To assign reasons for this opinion, would  
be as unnecessary as tedious. The ground  
has been so often trod, that hardly a place  
remains untouched; in a word the vecesxily  
arising from the want of specie, is represented  
a greater than it really it. I CONTEND  
THAT IT IS BY THE SUBSTANCE  
AND NOT BY THE SIIDOWOF A  
THING. THAT WE ARE BENEFIT  
TED. The wisdom of man, in my humble  
opinon. cannot at this time, devise a plan  
by which the credit of paper would be long  
supported; consequently DEPRECIATION  
KEEPS PACE WITH THE QUANTITY  
OF THE EMISSION. AND THE ARTIC­  
LES FOR WHICH IT IS EXCHANGED.

THE SINKING VALUE OF THE MON­  
EY. WHEREIN THEN IS THE FAR­  
MER. THE PLANTER, THE ARTISAN  
BENEFITTED? The debtor may be, be  
cause, as I have observed, he gives the shad  
ow instead of the substance; and, in propor  
tion to his gain the creditor or the lody  
politic suffer. Whether it be legal tender  
or not, it will, as hs been observed truly,  
have no alternative. It must be that or noth­

opinion reasons, too, which, of all others,  
are least pleasing to the advocates of paper  
money. I sh II, therefore, only observe,  
generally, that so many people have suffered  
by the former emissions, that like a burnt

Dear Sir. Your favor of the 3 C th ultimo  
came duly to hand. To give an opinion in a  
cause of so much importance as that which  
has warmly agitated the two branches of the  
Legislature, and which, from the appeal that  
is made, is likely to create great and perhaps  
dangerous divisions, is rather a delicate mat­  
ter: but, as this diversity of opinion is on a  
subject which has, I believe, occupied the  
minds of most men, and as my sentiments  
thereon have been fully aud decidedly ex­  
pressed long before the Assembly either in  
Maryland or this State was convened, I do  
not scruple to declare, that if I had a voice in  
your Legislature, it would have been given  
decidedly aguinst a paper emission upon the  
general principles of its utility as a represen­  
tative, aud the necessity of it as amedium.  
  
To assign reasons for this would be as un­  
necessary as tedious. The ground has been  
so often trod that a place hardly remains un­  
t luched. In a word the necessity arising  
f om a want of specie is represented a3 great­  
er than it really is. I contend that it is by  
the substance, not with a shadow of a thing,  
  
we are to be benefited. The w isdom of a  
man, in my humble opinion, cannot at this  
time devise a plan by which the credit of our  
paper mot ey would be long supported, con­  
sequently depreciation keeps pace with the  
  
quantity oflhe emission, and articles for  
  
which it is exchanged rise in a greater ratio  
  
than the sinking value of the money. Where  
  
in, then, is the farmer, the planter, the artisan,  
  
benefited. The debtor inay be, because, as  
I have observed, he gives the shadow in lieu  
of the substance, and in proportion to his  
  
gain, tho creditor or the body politic sutlers  
  
Whether it be a legal tender or not, it will, as  
  
has been observed very truly, leave no alter­  
native. It must be that or nothing. An evil  
  
equally great is, the door it opens immediulr-  
  
ly lor speculation, by which the least design  
  
ing and perhaps most valuable part of the  
  
community are preyed upon by the more  
know ing and crafty speculators.  
But contrary to my intention and declara­  
tion, I am offering reasons to support my  
opinion: reasons too, which of all others are  
least pleasing to the advocates of paper money.  
I shall therefore only observe generally, that  
so many people have suflered by former emis­  
sions, that, like a burnt child dreads the lire,  
no person w ill touch it who can possibly avoid  
it. The natural consequence of which will  
be, that the specie, which remains unexpor­  
ted, will be instantly locked up.

&quot;Mr. VERNON, Feb 17, 1700.  
&quot;Dear Mir;-Your favor of the 30th  
ult, came duly to hand. To give an  
opinion in a case of so much importance  
as that which has warmly agitated the  
two branches of your legislature, and  
which from the appeal that is made, is  
ikely to create great and perhaps danger  
ous divisions, is rather a delicate matter;  
but, as this diversity of opinion is on a  
subject, which has, I believe, occupied  
the minds of most men, and as my senti­  
ments thereon have been fully and deci­  
dedly expressed long before the Assembly  
either in Maryland or this State, was con­  
vened, I do not scruple to declare, that  
if I had had a voice in your legislature, it  
would have been given decidedly against  
a paper emission, upon the general prin­  
ciples of its utility as a representative and  
the necessity of it as a medium.  
&quot;To assign reasons for this opinion,  
would be as unnecessary as tedious. The  
ground has been so often trod, that a  
place hardly remains untouched. In a  
word, the necessity arising from a want  
of specie is represented as greater than  
it really is. I contend that it is by the  
substance, not with the shadow of a thing,  
we are to be benefitted. The wisdom of  
man, in my humble opinion, cannot at  
this time devise a plan by which the cre­  
dit of paper money would be long sup­  
ported; consequently depreciation keeps  
pace with the quantity of the emission,  
and articles for which it is exchanged rise  
in a greater ratio than the sinking value  
of the money. Wherein, then, is the  
Farmer, the Planter, the Trtizan, bene­  
fitted? The debtor may be, because, as  
I have observed, he gives the shadow in  
lieu of the substance, and in proportion  
to his gain, the credit or the body politic  
suffers. Whether it be a legal tender or  
not, it will, as has been observed very  
truly, leave no alternative. It must be  
that or nothing. An evil equally great  
is, the door it immediately opens for spe­  
culation, by which the least designing,  
and perhaps most valuable port of the  
community, are preyed upon by more  
knowing and crafty speculators.  
&quot;But contrary to my intention and dec­  
laration, I am offering reasons in support  
of my opinion; reasons too, which of all  
others are least pleasing to the advocate  
for paper money. I shall therefore only  
observe generally, that so many people  
have suffered by former emissions, that  
like a burnt child who dreads the fire, no  
person will touch it who can possibly  
avoid it. The natural consequence of  
which will be, that the specie, which re  
mains unexported, will be instantly loch  
ed up.

MOUNT VERNON, Feb. 16, 1787.  
  
To THOMAS STONE  
Dear Sir—Your favor of the 30th ult.,  
came duly to hand. To give an opinion  
in a case of so much importance as that  
which has warmly agitated the two bran­  
ches of your legislature, and which from  
the appeal that is made, is likely to create  
great and dangerous divisions, is rather a  
delicate matter, but as this diversity of  
opinion is on a subject which has, I be­  
lieve occupied the minds of most men, and  
as my sentiments thereon have been fully  
and decidedly expressed, long before the  
Assembly either of Maryland or this State  
was convened, I do not scruple to declare  
that, if I had a voice in your legislature, it  
would have been given decidedly against  
a paper emission, upon the general princi­  
ples of its inutility as a representative and  
the necessity of it as a medium.  
  
To assign reasons for this opinion, would  
be as unnecessary as tedious. The ground  
ha» hecn so often trod that hardly a place  
remains untouched in a word, the neces­  
sity arising from the want of specie is rep  
resented as greater than it really is. I  
contend that it is by the substance and not  
by the shadow of a thing, that we are ben­  
efitted. The wisdom of man in my hum­  
ble opinion, cannot at this time, devise a  
plan by which the ciedit of paper money  
would be long supported consequently  
depreciation keeps pace with the quan­  
tity of emission, and the articles for  
which it is exchanged, rise in a greater ra­  
tio than the sinking value of the money.  
Wherein then, is the farmer, the planter,  
the artisan benefitted The debtor may  
be, because, as 1 have observed, he gives  
the shadow instead of the substance and  
in proportion to his gain the creditot, or  
the body politic suffers. Whether it be le­  
gal tender or not, it will, as has been ob­  
served truly, leave no alternative. It must

is the door it immediately opens for spec­  
ulation, and perhaps the most valuable

as that which has warmly agitated the two  
branches of your Legislature, and which,

ate great and perhaps dangerous divisions, is  
rather a delicate matter; but, as this diversi­

believe, occupied the minds of most men,  
and as my sentiments thereon have been ful­  
ly and dacidedly expressed long before the  
Assembly either of Maryland or this State  
was convened, I do not scruple to declare,  
that, if I had a voice in your Legislature, it  
would have been givon decidedly against a  
paper emission upon the general principles  
of its utility as a representative, and tho ne­  
cessity of it as a medium.  
&quot; To assign reasons for this opinion would  
be as unnecessary as tedious. Tho ground  
has been so often trod, that a place hardly  
remains untouched. In a word, the neces  
sity arising from a want of spscio is repre­  
sented as greater than it really is. I con­  
tend, that it is by the&#x27;substance, not the sha­  
dow of a thing, we aro to bo benefitted.  
  
Tho wisdom of man, in my humble opinion,  
cannot at this time devise a plan, by which  
tho credit of paper money would bo long  
supported; consequently depreciation keeps  
pace with tho qfuintily of the -Cmisjion, and  
articles, for which it is exchanged, riso in a  
greater ratio than the sinking value of the  
money. Wherein, then, is the farmer, the

unnecessary as tedious. The ground has been so  
often trod, that hardly a place remains untouched;  
in a word, ihe necessity arising from the want of  
specie, isrepresented as greater than it re­  
ally ii. I contend that it is by the substance and  
not by the shadow of a thing, that .we are bene­  
fited. The wisdom of man in my humble opinion,  
cannot at this time, devise a plan by which the  
credit of paper would be long supported; conse­  
quently depreciation keeps pace with the quantity  
of the emission, and the article for which it is ex­  
changed, rise in a greater ratio than the sinking  
value of the money; wherein then, it the farmer,  
the planter, the artizan benefitted? The debtor  
may be, because, as I have observed, he gives the  
shadow instead of the substance; and in proportion  
to his gain the cieditor oi the body politic sufTers.  
Whether il be a legal tender or not, it will, at hat  
been observed truly, leave no alternative. It must  
be that or nothing. An evil equally great it the  
door it immediately opens fur speculation, by  
which the least designing, aud perhaps most val­  
uable part of the community is preyed upon by the  
more knowing and crai-ty speculator.  
But contrary lo my intentions and declarations,  
I am offering reasons in support of my opinion  
reasons, too, which, of all others, are least pleat­  
ing to the advocates of paper money. I shall, there­  
fore, only observe, generally! that to many people  
have suffered by the furmer emission, that, like a  
burnt child who dreads the fire, no person will  
touch it who can possibly avoid it the natural  
consequence of which will be,&#x27; that the specie

MouNT VERNON, 16 Feb,, 1787.  
DaAr SIR,  
Your favor of the 30th ultimo came duly to  
hand. To give an opinion in a cause of so much  
importance as that, which has warmly agitated  
the two branches of your legislature, and which,  
from the appeal that is made, is likely to create  
great and perhaps dangerous divisions, is rather  
a delicate matter; but, as this diversity of opinion  
is on a subject, which has, I believe, occupied  
the minds of most men, and as my sentiments  
thereon have been fully and decidedly expressed  
long before the Assemby either of Maryland or  
this State was convened, I do not scruple to de  
clare, that, if I had a voice in your legislature, it  
would have been given decidedly against a paper  
emission upon the general principles of its utili­  
ty as a representative, and the necessity of it as  
a medium.  
To assign reasons for this opinion would be as  
unnecessary as tedious. The ground has been  
so often trod, that a place hardly remaihs un  
touched. In a word, the necessity arising from  
a want of specie is represented as greater than  
it roally is. I contend, that it is by the sub  
stance, not with the shadow of a thing, we are  
to be benefited. The wisdom of man, in my  
humble opinion, cannot at this time devise a plan  
  
NTW YE

for  
h it is exchanged, tise  
in a greater  
an  
e sinking value of the u  
artisan beacfited? The debtor may he, hecause,  
as I have observed, he gives the shadow in lien  
of the substance; and, in pronortion to his gain,  
the cred tor or the body poutie sutfers. W heth  
it be a legal tender or not, it will, as has been  
observed rery truly, leave no alternative. It  
must be that or nothing. An evil equally great  
is, the door it immediately opens for speculu  
ulation, by which the least designing, and per­  
haps most vaiuable, part of the community are  
preyed upon by the more knowing and crast  
eculator  
But, contrary to my intention and declaration,  
I am offering reasons in support of my opinion;  
reasous too, which of all others are least plea  
ing to the advocate for paper  
money. I shall  
ly, that so many  
 therefore only observe gener  
people have suffered by form  
r emissions, that,  
the fire, no person

livcrsity of opinion is on a subject which has, I believe,  
xxmpied the minds of most men, and as my sentiments , or&gt; 1

fore the assembly either of Marylund or this Statu was  
?onveiled, 1 do not octuple to declare that, if I had a voice &#x27;

Its utility as a representative and the necessity of it as a

Wherein, then, is the farmer, the planter, and artisan and

Mount Vernon, Feb. 27, 1787. I  
Dear Sir : Your favor of the 30th ult. came  
duly to hand. To give an opinion in a cause  
of so much importance as that which has warmly  
agitated the two branches of your Legislature,  
and which, from the appeal that is made,  
is likely to create great and perhaps dangerous 1  
divisions, is rather a delicate matter; but as  
this diversity of opinion is on a suhject which  
has, I believe, occupied the minds of most men,  
  
ana as my sentiments thereon have been fu&#x27;ly  
and decidedly expressed long before .the Assembly  
either of Maryland or this State was  
convened, I do not scruple to declare, that if I  
had a voice in your Legislature, it would have  
been given decidedly Against a paper emission,  
upon the general principle of its utility as a  
representative, and the necessity of it as a medium.  
To assign reasons for this opinion  
would be as unnecessary as tedious; the grouod  
has been so often trod, that a place hardly remains  
untouched; in a word, the necessity  
arising from a want of specie is represented as  
greater than it really is. I contend that it is  
by the substance, not the shadow cf a thing,  
that we are to be benefited.  
The wisdom of man, in my humble opinion,  
cannot, at this time, devise a plan by which  
the credit of paper money would be long supported  
; consequently, depreciation keeps pace  
with the quantity of emission, and articles for  
which it is exchanged rise in a greater ratio  
than the sinking value of the money. Wherein, i  
then, is the farmer, the planter, and artisan,  
benefited ? The debtor may be, because, as X  
have observed, he gives the shadow in lien of  
the substance, and in proportion to hit gain  
the creditor or body politic suffers. Whe*he?  
it be a legal tender or not, it will, as has been &#x27;  
observed very truly, leave no alternative?it  
must be that or nothing. An evil equally i  
great is the door it immediately opens for spec- |  
ulation, by which the least designing, and per- :  
haps most valuable part, of the community are !  
preyed upon by the more knowing and erafry  
speculators. But, contrary to my intention ;  
and declaration, I am offering reasons in sup- j  
port of my opinion?reasons, too, which, of all  
others, are leas pleasing to the advocates of  
paper money. I shall therefore only observe, &#x27;  
generally, that so many people have suffered  
by former emissions, that, like a burnt child  
who dreads the fire, no person will touch it who  
can possibly avoid it; the natural consequence  
of which will be, that the specie which remains  
jnexported will be instantly locked up.  
With great esteem and regard, I am, dfear  
sir, Ac., George Washington

MouNT VErNoN, Feb. 27, 1787:  
Dear Sir: Your favor of the 30th ult, came  
duly to hand. To give an opinion in a cause  
of so much importance as that which has  
warmly agitated the two branches of your  
Legislature, and which, from the appeal that  
is made, is likely to create great and perhap  
dangerous divisions, is rather a delicate mat  
ter; but as this diversity of opinion is on a  
subject which has, I believe, occupied the  
minds of most men, and as my sentiments  
thereon have been fully and decidedly ex  
pressed long before the Assembly either of  
Maryland or this State was convened, I do  
not scruple to declare that if I had a voice in  
your Legislature, it would have been given  
decidedly against a paper emission, upon the  
general principle of its utility as a represen-  
tative and the necessity of it as a mediuin  
To assign reasons for this opinion would be  
as unnecessary as tedious; the ground has  
been so often trod that a place hardly re­  
mains untouched; in a word, the necessity  
arising from a want of specie is represented  
as greater than it really is. I contend that it  
is by the substance, not the shadow of a  
thing, that we are to be benefitted.  
The wisdom of man, in my humble opin­  
ion, cannot, at this time, devise a plan by  
which the credit of paper money would be  
long supported; consequently depreciation  
keeps pace with the quantity of emission,  
and articles for which it is exchanged rise in  
a greater ratio than the sinking value of the  
money. Wherein, then, is the farmer, the  
planter and artisan benefitted? The debtor  
may be, because, as I have observed, he gives  
the shadow in lieu of the substance, and in  
proportion to his gain the creditor or body  
politic suffer. Whether it be a legal tender  
or not it will, as has beenobserved very tru­  
ly, leave no alternative-it must be that or  
nothing. An evil equally great is the door  
it immediately opens for speculation, by  
which the least designing and perhaps most  
valuable part of the community are preyed  
upon by the more knowing and crafty specu-  
lators. But, contrary to mny intention and  
 e o o  
declarations, I am offering reasons in support  
of my opinion--reasons, too, which, of all  
others, are least pleasing to the advocates for  
paper money. I shall therefore only observe.  
generally that so many people have suffered  
by former emissions, that, like a burnt child  
who dreads the fire, no person will touch it  
who can possibly avoid it; the natural con

Dear Sir :—Your favor of the 30th ult,caine

of so much importance as that wiped has warm­  
ly agitated tile two branches of your legislature,  
and which, from the appeal that is made, is like­

dedly against a paper emission, upon the gene­  
ral principle of its utility as a representative  
and the necessity of it as a medium. To asign

that a place hardly remains untouched ; in a  
wo#d, the necessity arising from a want of spe­  
cie is reprinted as greater than it really is. I  
contend-that it is bv the substance, not the

The wisdom of man, in my humble opinion,

consequently,depreciation keeps pace with the

the farmer, the planter, and the artisan benefit­

MOUNT VERNON, Feb. 27, 1785   
  
Dear Sir:—Your favor of the 80th   
lilt came duly to hand. To give an   
opinion in a cause of so much impor­  
tance as that which has warmly agita­  
ted the two branches of your legislature   
and which, from the appeal that is   
made, is likely to create great and per­  
haps clangorous divisions, is rather a   
delicate matter; but as this diversity   
;of opinion is on a subject which has, &#x27;I   
believe, occupied the minds of most men.   
&#x27; and as my sentiments long before the   
assembly either of Maryland:or this   
State was convened, I do not scruple to   
declare that in had a voles in year leg­  
islature, it would have been given deci­  
dedly against. a paper emission, upon   
the general principle of its utility as a   
representative and the necessity of it   
as a mediuzn. To assign reasons for   
this opinion would be as unnecessary   
as tedious ; the ground has been GO sago   
trod that a place hardly remains un•   
touched; in a word, the necessity aril­  
ing. from a want. of specie is represen­  
ted as greater than it really is. I con­  
tend that it is by the eubstance, not the   
shadow of a tbing,that we are to be ben­  
efited.   
Tho wisdom of man; In my humble   
nion, cannot, at this time, devise a   
• ..by which the credit of paper mo­  
tif&quot; Would be long supported ;• cense.   
AffigiW, depreciation keeps pace&#x27; with   
the q entity of emission, and articles   
&#x27;for it is &#x27;est:hanged rise in a   
greate do than the sinking value ar   
the money. Wherein, then, is the far:   
mer, the planX,eand the artisan ben*.   
fited? The r may be, beekuse,•as   
I have observed, he gives the shadow   
in lieu of the substance, and in, proper-  
Lion to his gain the .creditor or body   
politic suffer. Whether, it be s legal   
tender or not, it will, as has been ob­  
served very truly, leave no alternative   
—it mast be that or nothing. An evil   
equally great is the door it immediately   
opens for speculation, by which the   
least designing and perhaps most val­

MouNT VERNON, Feb. 27, 1787.  
Dear SIR: Your favor of the 30th  
ult, came only to hand. To give an  
opinion in a cause of so much impor­  
tance as that which has warmly agi  
tated the two branches of your Legis­  
latare, and which, from the appeal  
that is made, is likely to create great  
and perhaps dangerous divisions, is  
rather a delicate matter; but at this di­  
versity of opinion is on a subject which  
has, I believe, occupied the minds of  
most of men, and as my sentiments  
thereon have been fully and decidedly  
expressed long before the Assembly  
either of Maryland or this State was  
convened, I do not scruple to declare  
that if I had a voice in your Legisla­  
ture, it would have been given decid­  
edly against a paper emission, upon  
the general principle of its utility as a  
representative and the necessity of it  
as a medinm. To assign reasons for  
this opinion would be as a unnecessa­  
ry as tedious; the ground has been so  
often trod that a place hardly remains  
untouched; in a word; the necessity  
arising from the want of specie is rep­  
resented as greater than it really is.  
I contend that is by the substance not  
the shadow of a thing that we are to  
be benefitted. The wisdom of man, in  
my humble opinion, cannot at this time  
devise a plan by which the credit of pa­  
per money would be long supported,  
consequently depreciation keeps pace  
with the quantity of emission, and ar­  
ticles for which it is exchanged rise  
in a greater ratio than the sinking  
value of the money. Wherein, then,  
is the farmer, the planter and artisan  
benefitted? The debtor may be, be­  
cause, as I have observed, he gives  
the shadow in lien of the substance  
and in porportion to his gain the  
creditor, or body politic suffer.  
Whether it be a legal tender or not  
it will, as has been observed very tru­  
ly, leave no alternative-it may be  
that or nothing. An evil equally  
great is the door it immediately opens  
for speculation, by which the least de­  
signing and perhaps most valuable  
part of the community ase preyed up­  
on by the more knowing aid crafty  
speculators. But contrary tomy in­  
tention and declaration, I am offcring  
reasons in support of my opinion,  
reasons, too, which, of all others, are  
leust pleasing to the adrecates for  
I shall therefore only  
observe generally, that so many peo­  
ple have suffered by former emissions,  
that like a burnt child who dreads fire  
no person will touch it; the natural  
consequence of which that the specie  
which remains unexported will be, in­  
stantly locked up.  
With great esteem and regard, I am,  
dear sir, &amp;c., &amp;c.,

Modn&#x27;t Vernon-, Feb. 27, 1787.  
Dear Sir : Your favor of the 30th uit,  
came duly to hand. To give an opinion in a  
case of so much importance as that which has  
warmly agitated the two branches of your  
Legislature, and which, from the appeal that  
is made, is likely to create great and perhaps  
dangerous divisions, is rather a delicate mat­  
ter; but as this diversity of opinkm is on a  
subject which has, 1 believe occupied the  
minds of most men,and as my sentiments  
thereon have been fully and decidedly ex­  
presed long before the Assembly either of  
Maryland or this State, was convened, I do  
not scruple to declare that, if I had a voice in  
your Legislative, it would have been given  
decidedly against a paper emission, upon the  
general principle of itsTitility as a representa­  
tive and the necessity of it as a medium. To  
assign reasons for this opinion would be as un­  
necessary as tedious the gitund lias been so  
often trod that a place hardly remains un­  
touched in a word, the necessity arising  
from a want of specie is represented as great­  
er than it retlry is. I contend that it is by  
the substance, not the shadow of a thing that  
we are to be benefitted.  
The wisdom of man, in my humble opin­  
ion, cannot at this time devise a plan by which  
the credit of paper money would be long sup­  
ported ; consequently depreciation keeps pace­  
with the quantity of emission, and articles for  
which it is exchanged&#x27; rise. to a greater ratio  
than the sinking value of the money. Where­  
in, then, is the farmer, the planter and artisan  
benefitted? The debtor, may be, because, as  
I have observed, he gives the shadow in lieu  
of the substance, and in proportion to his gain  
the creditor or body politic suffers. Whether  
a legal tender or not, it will, as has been ob­  
served very truly, leave no alternative. It  
must be that or nothing. An evil equally  
great is the door it immediately opens for  
speculation, by which the least designing and  
perhaps most valuable part of the community  
are preyed upon by tho more knowing and  
crafty speculators. But, contrary to my in­  
tention and declaration, I am offering reasons  
in support of my opinion, reasons, too, which,  
of all others, are least pleasing to the advocates  
lor paper currency. 1 shall, therefore, only  
observe, generally, that so many people have  
suffered by former emissions, that, like a burnt  
child who dreads tho fire, no person will touch  
it who can possibly avoid it, the natural con­  
sequence of which will be, that the specie  
which remains unexported will be instantly  
locked up.  
With great esteem and regard, I am dear  
sir, &amp;c, GEO. WASHINGTON

Dear Sir:—Your favor of the 30ih tilt,

a case of so much importance as that which  
has warmly agitated the two branches of  
your Legislature,•and which, from the ap

cupied the minds of most men, and as my  
sentiments thereon have been Lilly and deci­  
dedly expressed long before tbe Assembly,  
either of Maryland or tliis Stale, was con­  
vened, I do not scruple to declare that if I  
bad a voice in your Legislature it would be  
given decidedly against a paper emission,  
upon the general principle of its utility as  
a representative, and the necessity of it as a  
medium. To assign reason for ibis opinion  
would be as unnecessary as tedious—the  
ground lias been so often trod that a place

only observe, generally, that so many peo­

like a burnt child that dreads the tire, no

Mr. VEENON, February 27, 1787  
Dear Sir.--Your favor of the 30th ult came  
duly to hand. To give an opinion on an issue of  
so much importance as that which has warmly  
agitated the two branches of your legislature  
and which from the appeal that is made, is likely  
to create a dangerous division, is rather a dell  
cate matter; but as this diversity of opinion is  
on a subject which has, I believe, occupied the  
minds of most men, and as my sentiments there  
on have been fully and decidedly expressed long  
before the Assembly either of Maryland or this  
tate was convened I do not seruple to declare  
that if I had a voice in your Legislature, it would  
have been given decidedly again  
idedly against the emission,  
upon the general principles of its utility as a re  
presentative and the necessity of it as a medium  
To assign reasons for this opinion would be as  
unnecessary as tedious; the ground has been so  
often trod that a place hardly remains untouched  
in a word, the necessity arising from a want of  
specie is represented as greater than it really is;  
I contend that it is by the substance, not the  
shadow of a thing that we are to be benefitted  
The wisdom of man, in my humble opinion, can  
not, at this time, devise a plan by which the  
credit of paper money would be long supported;  
consequently depreciation keeps pace with the  
quantity of emission, and articles for which it is  
exchanged rise in a greater ratio than the sink  
ing value of the money. Wherein, then, is the  
farmer, the planter, and the artisan benefitted?  
The debtor may be, because as I have observed,  
he gives the shadow in hen of the substance, and  
in proportion to his gain the creditor or body  
politic suffers. Whether it be legal tender or  
not, it will, as has been observed very truly,  
leave no other alternative--it smust be that or  
nothing.  
An evil equally great is the door it immediate  
ly opens for speculation, by which the least de  
signing and perhaps most valuable part of the  
community are preyed upon by the more know  
ing and crafty speculators. But, contrary to my  
intention and declaration, I am offering reasons  
in support of my opinion,-reasons, too, which,  
f all others, are least pleasing to the advocates  
for paper money. I shall, therefore, only ob  
serve generally, that so many people have suf  
fered by former emissions, that, like a burnt  
child  
ho dreads the fire, no person  
ill touch it  
who can  
quence of  
possibly avoid it; the natural conse  
which will be, that the specie which  
remains unexported will be instantly locked up,  
With great esteem and regard,  
I am dear sir, &amp;c.

l)KACMUj Yonr favor of the 20th tilt came  
duly to hand. To give an opinion in a rjc of  
eo much importance as that which his waruiW  
agitated the two branches of jour Ijrgfdaturv.  
and which, from tbe appeal that is made, is  
likely to cieate great and perhaps dangen.is  
divisions, is rather a delicate matter; bnt as  
this diversity t-f opinion is on a subject which  
bxs. 1 believe, occupied the minds of most men,  
and as my sentiments thereon hae txvu full)  
and decidedly expressed long before the Asseni­  
bly, either of Maryland or this State, was con  
veiled, I do not scruple to declare that, if I had  
a voice in your Legislature, it would bao been  
given decidedly against a paper emisstou, upon  
the general principle of its ntihty as a repre­  
sentative, and the necca.it of it as a medium  
To assigu reasons for this opinion would be as  
nu necessary as ttdiotis the ground has l-ceii mi  
often trod that a place hardly remains un  
touched iu a word, the necessity anting from  
a want of specie is represeute.l as greater than  
it really is. I contend that it U by the uh  
stance, not the shadow of a thing tint we are to  
liolfcncfitted.  
The wisdom of man, in my humble opinion,  
can not at this time device a plau by which the  
credit of paper money would be loug supported;  
cousefjneutly, depreciation keeps pace with the  
quantity of emissions, and articles for which it

ington from Mount Vernon, “that, if I had a  
voice in your legislature, it would have been  
given decidedly against a paper emission, upon  
the general principles of its inutility as a repre  
sentative, and the necessity of it as a medium.  
  
To assign reasons for this opinion would be  
as unnecessary as tedious. The ground has been  
so often trod, that hardly a place remains un-  
touched; in a word, the necessity arising from  
the want of specie is represented greater than it  
really is. I contend that it is by the substance,  
and not by the shadow of a thing, that we are to be  
benefited. The wisdom of man, in my humble  
opinion, cannot, at this time, devisea plan by  
which the credit of paper money would be long  
supported. An evil equally great is the door it  
immediately opens for speculation, by which  
the least designing, and perhaps the most valu-  
able part of the community, are preyed upon  
by the more knowing and crafty speculators.”’
