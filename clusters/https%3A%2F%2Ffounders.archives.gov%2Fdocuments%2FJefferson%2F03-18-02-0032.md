Monticello Dec. 11. 21.  
  
Your letter of Dec. 19. places me under a dilemma which I cannot solve but by an exposition of the naked truth. I would have wished this rather to have remained as hitherto, without enquiry. but your enquiries have a right to be answered. I will do it as exactly as the great lapse of time and a waning memory will enable me. I may misremember indifferent circumstances but can be right in substance.   At the time when the Republicans of our country were so much alarmed at the proceedings of the Federal ascendancy, in Congress, in the Executive and the Judiciary departments, it became a matter of serious consideration how head could be made against their enterprises on the constitution. the leading republicans in Congress found themselves of no use there, brow beaten as they were by a bold and overwhelming majority. they concluded to retire from that field, take a stand in their state-legislatures, and endeavor their there to arrest their progress. the Alien and Sedition laws furnished the particular occasion. the sympathy between Virginia and Kentucky was more cordial, &amp; more intimately confidential than between any other two states of republican policy. mr Madison came into the Virginia legislature. I was then in the Vice-presidency, and could not leave my station. but your father Colo W. C. Nicholas and myself happening to be together, the engaging the co-operation of Kentucky in an energetic protestation against the constitutionality of those laws was became a subject of consultation. those gentlemen pressed me strongly to sketch resolutions for that purpose, your father undertaking to introduce them to that legislature, with a solemn assurance, which I strictly required, that it should not be known from what quarter they came. I drew, and delivered them to him, and in keeping their origin secret he fulfilled his pledge of honor. some years after this Colo Nicholas asked me if I would have any objection to it’s being known that I had drawn them. I pointedly enjoined that it should not. whether he had unguardedly intimated it before to any one I know not: but I afterwards observed in the papers repeated imputations of them to me; on which, as has been my practice on all occasions of imputation, I have observed entire silence. the question indeed has never before been put to me, nor should I answer it to any other than yourself, seeing no good end to be proposed by it and the desire of tranquility inducing with me a wish to be withdrawn from public notice. your father’s zeal and talents were too well known to derive any additional distinction from the penning these resolutions. that circumstance surely was of far less merit than the proposing and carrying them thro’ the legislature of his state.   the only fact in this statement on which my memory is not distinct is the time &amp; occasion of the consultation with your father and mr Nicholas. it took place here I know; but whether any other person was present, or communicated with is my doubt. I think mr Madison was either with us, or consulted, but my memory is uncertain as to minute details.   I fear, dear Sir, we are now in such another crisis, with this difference only, that the judiciary branch is alone and single-handed in the present assaults on the constitution. but it’s assaults are more sure and deadly, as from an agent seemingly passive and unassuming. may you and your cotemporaries meet them with the same determination and effect as your father and his did the alien and sedition laws, and preserve inviolate a constitution, which, cherished in all it’s chastity &amp; purity, will prove in the end a blessing to all the nations of the earth. with these prayers accept those for your own happiness and prosperity.

MONTICELLO, December rr, ’2r.  
  
DEAR SiR: Your letter of December rg places me  
under a dilemma which I cannot solve but by an  
exposition of the naked truth. I would have wished  
this rather to have remained as hitherto without  
inquiry, but your inquiries have a right to be an-  
swered. I will do it as exactly as the great lapse of  
time and a waning memory will enable me. I may  
misremember indifferent circumstances, but can be  
right to substance. At the time when the Republi-  
cans of our country were so much alarmed at the  
proceedings of the Federal ascendancy in congress  
in the executive and the judiciary departments, it  
became a matter of serious consideration how head  
could be made against their enterprises on the con-  
stitution. Theleading Republicans of congress found  
themselves of no use there, brow-beaten as they  
were by a bold and overwhelming majority. They  
concluded to retire from that field, take a stand in  
their state legislature,and endeavor there to arrest  
their progress. The Alien and Sedition laws furnished  
the particular occasion. The sympathy between  
Virginia and Kentucky was more cordial and more  
intimately confidential than between any other two  
states of Republican policy. Mr. Madison came  
into the Virginia legislature. I was then inthe vice-  
presidency and could not leave my station ; but  
your father, Colonel W. C. Nicholas and myself,  
happening to be together, the engaging the co-  
operation of Kentucky in an energetic protestation  
against the constitutionality of those laws became a  
subject of consultation. Those gentlemen pressed  
me strongly to sketch resolutions for that purpose,  
your father undertaking to introduce them to that  
legislature, with a solemn assurance, which I strictly  
required, that it should not be known’ from what  
quarter they came. I drew and delivered them to  
him, and in keeping their original secret he fulfilled  
his pledge of honor. Some years after this Colonel  
Nicholas asked me if I would have any objection to  
it being known that I had drawn them. I pointedly  
enjoined that it should not. Whether he had un-  
guardedly intimated before to anyone I know not,  
but I afterwards observed in the papers repeated  
imputations of them to me, on which, as has been  
my practice on all occasions of imputation, I have  
observed entire silence. The question, indeed, has  
never before been put to me, nor should I answer it  
to any other than yourself, seeing no good end to be  
proposed by it, and the desire of tranquility inducing  
with me a wish to be withdrawn from public notice.  
Your father’s zeal and talents were too well known  
  
  
  
576  
  
to desire any additional distinction from the penning  
these resolutions, That circumstance surely was of  
far less merit than the proposing and carrying them  
through the legislature: of his state. The only fact  
in this statement on which my memory is not dis-  
tinct, is the time and occasion of the consultation  
with your father and Mr. Nicholas. It took place  
here I know, but whether any other person was  
present or communicated with is my doubt. I  
think Mr. Madison was either’ with us or consulted,  
but my memory is uncertain as to minute details. I  
fear, dear sir, we are now in such another crisis, with  
this difference only, that the judiciary branch is  
alone and single-handed in the present assaults on  
the constitution ; but its assaults are more sure and  
deadly, as from an agent seemingly passive and un-  
assuining. May you and your contemporaries meet  
them with the same determination and effect as your  
father and his did the ‘‘ Alien and Sedition” laws,  
and preserve inviolate a constitution which, cherished  
in all its chastity and purity, will prove in the enda  
blessing to all the nations of the earth. With these  
  
prayers, accept those for your own happiness and  
  
prosperity. TH. JEFFERSON

MONTICELLO, December 11, 1821.  
  
Dear Sir: Your letter of December the 19th  
  
laces me under a dilemma which I cannot solve  
but by an exposition of the naked truth. I  
would have wi this rather to have remained  
as hitherto, without inquiry ; but your inquiries  
have aright to be answered. I willdo it as ex-  
actly as the great lapse of time and a waning  
memory will enable me. I may misremember  
indifferent circumstances, but can be right in sub  
stance.  
  
At the time when the Republicans of our  
country were so much alarmed at the procesd-  
ings of the Federal ascendency in Congress, in  
the Executive and Judiciary Departments, it be-  
came a matter of serious consideration how head  
could be made against their enterprises on the  
Constitution. The leading Republicans in Con-  
  
found themselves of no use there, brow-  
Ccaben as they were by a bold and overwhelm-  
ing majority. They concluded to retire from  
that field, take a stand in the State Legisla-  
tures, and endeavorthere to arrest their progress.  
The alien and sedition laws furnished the  
particular occasion. The sympathy between Vir-  
ginia and Kentucky was more cordial, and more  
intimately contidential, than between any other  
two States of Republican policy. Mr. Madison  
came into the Virginia Legislature. I was then  
in the Vice-Presidency and could not leave my  
station; but your father, Col. W. C. Nichdlas,  
and myself happening to be together, the engag-  
ing the coéperation of Kentucky in an energetic  
protestation against the constitutionality of  
those laws became a subject of consultation.  
Those yy pressed me strongly to sketch  
resolutions for that purpose, your father un-  
dertaking to introduce them to that Legi-  
lature, with a solemn assurance, which I strict-  
ly required, that it should not be known from  
what quarter they came. I drew and de-  
livered them to him, and in keeping their origin  
secret he fulfilled his pledge of honor. Some  
years after this, Colonel Nicholas asked meif I
