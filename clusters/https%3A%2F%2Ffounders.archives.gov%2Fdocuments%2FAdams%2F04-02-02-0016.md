Had a Declaration of Independency been made seven Months ago, it would have been attended with many great and glorious Effects. . . . We might before this Hour, have formed Alliances with foreign States.—We should have mastered Quebec and been in Possession of Canada. . . . You will perhaps wonder, how such a Declaration would have influenced our Affairs, in Canada, but if I could write with Freedom I could easily convince you, that it would, and explain to you the manner how.—Many Gentlemen in high Stations and of great Influence have been duped, by the ministerial Bubble of Commissioners to treat. . . . And in real, sincere Expectation of this Event, which they so fondly wished, they have been slow and languid, in promoting Measures for the Reduction of that Province. Others there are in the Colonies who really wished that our Enterprise in Canada would be defeated, that the Colonies might be brought into Danger and Distress between two Fires, and be thus induced to submit. Others really wished to defeat the Expedition to Canada, lest the Conquest of it, should elevate the Minds of the People too much to hearken to those Terms of Reconciliation which they believed would be offered Us. These jarring Views, Wishes and Designs, occasioned an opposition to many salutary Measures, which were proposed for the Support of that Expedition, and caused Obstructions, Embarrassments and studied Delays, which have finally, lost Us the Province.  
All these Causes however in Conjunction would not have disappointed Us, if it had not been for a Misfortune, which could not be foreseen, and perhaps could not have been prevented, I mean the Prevalence of the small Pox among our Troops. . . . This fatal Pestilence compleated our Destruction.—It is a Frown of Providence upon Us, which We ought to lay to heart.  
But on the other Hand, the Delay of this Declaration to this Time, has many great Advantages attending it.—The Hopes of Reconciliation, which were fondly entertained by Multitudes of honest and well meaning tho weak and mistaken People, have been gradually and at last totally extinguished.—Time has been given for the whole People, maturely to consider the great Question of Independence and to ripen their Judgments, dissipate their Fears, and allure their Hopes, by discussing it in News Papers and Pamphletts, by debating it, in Assemblies, Conventions, Committees of Safety and Inspection, in Town and County Meetings, as well as in private Conversations, so that the whole People in every Colony of the 13, have now adopted it, as their own Act.—This will cement the Union, and avoid those Heats and perhaps Convulsions which might have been occasioned, by such a Declaration Six Months ago.  
But the Day is past. The Second Day of July 1776, will be the most memorable Epocha, in the History of America.—I am apt to believe that it will be celebrated, by succeeding Generations, as the great anniversary Festival. It ought to be commemorated, as the Day of Deliverance by solemn Acts of Devotion to God Almighty. It ought to be solemnized with Pomp and Parade, with Shews, Games, Sports, Guns, Bells, Bonfires and Illuminations from one End of this Continent to the other from this Time forward forever more.  
  
You will think me transported with Enthusiasm but I am not.—I am well aware of the Toil and Blood and Treasure, that it will cost Us to maintain this Declaration, and support and defend these States.—Yet through all the Gloom I can see the Rays of ravishing Light and Glory. I can see that the End is more than worth all the Means. And that Posterity will tryumph in that Days Transaction, even altho We should rue it, which I trust in God We shall not.

dom, I could eafily convince you that it would, and explain to you the  
maoner how. Many gentleinen, in high ftations, and of great in-  
fluence, have been duped by the minifteria! bubble of commiifioners  
to treat ; and, in real, fincere expectation of this event, which they  
fo tondly wilhed, they have been flow and languid in promoting  
meafures for the reduction of that province. Others there are in the  
colonies, who really wifhed our enterprize in Canada to be defeated,  
that rhe colonies might be brought into danger and diftrefs, between  
tw fires, and be thus induced to fubmit. thers really wifhed to  
defeat the expedition to Canada, lett the conquett of it thould elevate  
the minds of the people too much, to hearken to thofe terms of recon-  
ciliatiun, which they believed would be otfered us. Thefe jarring  
views, wilhes, and defigns, occafioned an oppfition to many falutary  
meafures, which were  
  
IC  
  
oropofed, for the fupport of that expedition ;  
and caufed obftructions, embarraflments, and ftudied delays, which  
have ffnally loft us the province. All thefe caufes, however, in con-  
junction, would not have difappointed us, if it had not been fora  
misturtune, whici could not have been forefeen, and perhaps could  
not have been prevented ; | mean the prevalence of the fmall-pox  
among our troops. This fatal peftilence compleated our deftruction:  
it isa frown of Providence upon us, which we ought to lay to heart.  
But, on the other hand, the delay. of this declaration to this  
tine, has many great advantages attending it. The hopes of  
reconciliation, which were fondly entertained by multitudes of  
honeit and well-meaning, tho’ thort fighted and miftaken peo-  
ple.aave been gradually, and at laft totally, extinguifhed——  
— ime has been given for the whole people maturely to confider the  
great queftion ofindependence; and to ripen their judgment, diflipate  
their fears, and allure their hopes, by difcuffing itin newipapers, and  
pamphlets, by debating it in aflemblies and conventions, in commit-  
tecs of fatety and infpection, in town and county-meetings, as well as  
in private converfations ; fo that the whole people, in every colony,  
have now adopted it as their own act. This will cement the union,  
  
and prevent thofe heats, and perhaps convulfions, which might have been  
occationed by fuch a declaration fix monthsago. sSutthe day is palt,  
  
Tne fecond day of july, 1776, will be a memorable epocha in the  
hitory of America. I am apt to believe it will be celebrated, by  
  
fucceeding generations, as the great anniverfary feftival. It ought  
  
to be commemorated, as the day of deliverance, by tolemn acts of  
devotion to almighty God. It ought to be folemnized with pomp,

Parapetrara, July 3, 1776.—Had a Declaration  
of Independence been made seven months ago, it  
might have been attended with many great and  
glorious effects: We might, before this hour, have  
formed alliances with foreign States. We should  
have mastered Quebec, and been in possession of  
Canada.  
  
You will, perhaps, wonder how such a declara-  
tion would have influenced our affairs in Canada;  
but if I could write with freedom I could easily  
convince you that it would, and explain to you the  
manner how. Many gentlemen in high stations,  
and of great influence, have been duped, by the  
ministerial bubble of Commissioners to treat. And  
in real, sincere expectation of this event, which  
they so fondly wished, they have been slow and  
languid, in promoting measures for the reduction of  
that Province. Others there are in the Colonies  
who really wished that our enterprise in Canada  
would be defeated, that the Colonies might be  
brought into danger and distress between two  
fires, and be thus induced to submit. Others really  
wished to defeat the expedition to Canada, lest t!,¢  
conguest of it should elevate the minds of the peo-  
ple too much to hearken to those terms of recon-  
ciliation which they believed wonid be offered us.  
These jarring views, wishes, and designs, occasion-  
edan opposition to many salutary measures which  
were proposed fur the support of that expedition,  
  
_ and caused obstructions, embarrassments, and stu-  
died delays, which have finally lost us the Pro-  
vince.  
  
All these causes, however, in conjunction, would  
not have disappointed us, if it had not been for a  
misfortune, which could not have been foreseen,  
and perhaps could not have been prevented; I  
mean the prevalence of the small pox among our  
troops. This fatal pestilence completed our des-  
truction. It isq frown of Providence upon us,  
which we.ought to lay to heart.  
  
But onthe other hand, the delay of this Declara-  
tion to this time, has many great advantages attend-  
ing it. The hapes of reconciliation, which were  
fondly entertainéd by multitudes of honest and well  
meaning, though short-sighted and mistaken people,  
have been gradually, and at last totally extinguish-  
ed—tTime has been given, for the whole people,  
maturely to consider the great question of Inde

1&#x27;HiLAnr&#x27;i.PHia, July 3, 177G,  
Had a Declaration of Independence, been made  
seven mifniti* ago, it would nave been attended  
w ith many great and glorious effects. V\ e might,  
belore tins hour, have formed alliances with  
foreign states. He should have mastered tiue- |  
bee, and been in posserfn&#x27;n of Caiuih.  
You will, jperhapv, wonder bow such a dwcla- j  
ration would have influenced our affairs in Cana- !  
dh—bui, if I could write with freedom, 1 could j  
easily convince you that il would, and explain  
io you the manner how. Many gentlemen in  
high stations, and of great influence, have been  
duped, by the ministerial bubble of commis­  
sioners, to treat—and, in real, sincere expecta­  
tion of this event, which they so fondly wished,  
they have been slow and languid in promoting  
measures tor the reduction of that province:—  
Otheis there are in the Colonies, who realty  
wished that our enterprise in Canada would he  
defeated—that the Colonies might be brought |  
into danger and distress between two fires,and j  
be thus induced to submit: Others really wished  
to dcfaat the expedition to Canada, lest the con­  
(piest of it should elevate the minds of the peo­  
ple too much iy hearken to those terms ot reeon.  
filiation which they believed would be offered  
us. These jarring views, wishes and designs, j  
occasioned an opposition to many salutary mea­  
sure* which weie proposed lor the support of  
itmt expedition, anil caused obstruction*, em  
larrassments, and studied delay *, which have  
finally lost us that province.  
Ah these causes, however, in conjunction,  
would not have disappointed us, if it had not  
aeen lor a misfortune which could not have been  
foreseen, and perhaps could nut have been pre­  
sented—l mean the prevalence of the stnail pnx  
unong our troops. This fatal pestilence cum  
deled our destruction. Il is a it own upon us,  
vbieti we ought to lay to heart.  
But, on tbe other hand, the delay of this de­  
ilamion to this lime, ha* many great advanta­  
ges attending it. The hopes ot reconciliation,  
fthich were loudly cuteriiancd by multitudes of  
iui»est and well meaning, though short-sighted  
uid mistaken people, have been gradually, and  
t last to,ally, extinguished. Time has been  
fiven for tbe whole people maturely to consf  
ler the great question of independence, and  
o tipen their judgment, dissipate their fears,  
ind allure their hopes, by discussing it in tbe  
lewspapersacd pamphlets—by debating it in 1  
.ssemblu-s, conventions, committee* Ot safety 1  
nd inspection—in town and country&#x27; meetrngs, |  
.j well a* in private conversations,- so that the  
vhofe people, in every colony, have now adopt­  
d if aa their own net. &#x27;This wilt cement the &lt;  
ini Oft, and avoid thosa heats, and perhaps coo- i  
uls.ons, which might have been occasions J by  
uch a declaration six months ago.  
But the day is paat. The second day of July,  
776, will be a memorable ep&#x27;-fcha in the histo- 1  
y of America. 1 am apt to believe that it will ;  
e celebrated by succeeding generations, as ,  
lie great Anniversary festival !*. ought to be ■&#x27;  
ominenioratcd, as the day of dehverance, hv ;

But, besides these “several writers of pamph-  
lets,” of whom Thomas Paine was the chief,  
there were several other writers of pamphlets  
and in newspapers, not referred to by Lord  
Mahon, who came forward “ to inform and to  
animate the people” against independence,  
which was a question that had two sides, and  
both were discussed before the people. Hear  
what John Adams says of the result of these dis-  
cussions. In a letter dated July 3, 1776, speak-  
ing of the resolution of independence, adopted  
the day before, (July 2,) he says :—  
  
Time has been given for the whole people ma-  
turely to consider the great question of independ-  
ence, and to ripen their judgment, dissipate their  
fears, and allure their hopes, by discussing it in  
newspapers and pamphlets, by debating it in  
assemblies, conventions, committees of safety  
and inspection, in town and county meetings, as  
well as private conversations, so that the whole  
vecople have now adopted it as their own act.  
This will cement the Union, and avoid those  
heats. and perhaps convulsions, which might  
have been occasioned by such a declaration six  
months ago.

Philadelphia, July 3, 1776,  
Had a declaration of Independence  
been made seven months ago, it would  
have been attended with many great  
and glorious effects. We might, before  
thiB hour, have formed alliance with  
foreign states. We should have mas­  
tered Quebec, and been in possession  
of Canada.  
You will, perhaps, wonder how such  
a declaration would have Influenced  
our affairs in Canada; but. If I could  
write with freedom, I  
convince you that it would  
explain to you the manner how. Many  
gentlemen in high stations, and of  
great Influence have been duped, by  
the ministerial bubble of commission­  
ers, to treat; and in real, sincere  
pectatlon of this event, which they  
fondly wished, they have been slow  
and languid in promoting measures for  
the reduction of that province. Others  
there are in the colonies who really  
wished that our enterprise in Canada  
would he defeated; that the colonies  
might be brought Into danger and dis­  
tress between two fires, and be thus  
induced to submit,  
wished to defeat the expedition  
Canada, lest the conquest of it should  
elevate the minds of the people too  
much to hearken to those terms of  
onciliatlon which they believed would  
be offered us. These Jarring views,  
wishes and designs occasioned  
position to many salutary  
which were proposed for the support  
of that expedition, and  
structlons, embarrassments, and stud­  
ied delays which have finally lost  
the province.  
could easily  
and  
I \ -  
si I  
Others really  
to  
rec­  
an op­  
measures  
caused ob­  
US  
All those causes, however, in  
con­  
junction, would not have disappointed  
us If it had not been for a misfortune  
which could not have been foreseen,  
and perhaps could not have been  
vented—I mean the prevalence of the  
smallpox among our troops. This fa­  
tal pestilence completed our destruc­  
tion. It Is a frown of Providence upon  
us. which we ought to lay to heart.  
But, on the other hand, the delay of  
this declaration to this time has many  
great advantages attending it. The  
hopes of reconciliation which  
fondly entertained by multitudes of  
honest and well-meaning, though  
shortsighted and mistaken  
pre­  
were  
people,  
have been gradually, and at last totally  
extinguished. Time has been given  
for the whole people maturely to con­  
sider the great question of independ­  
ence, and to ripen their judgment, dis­  
sipate their fears, and allure their  
hopes, by discussing it in newspapers  
and pamphlets—by debating it In as­  
semblies, conventions, committees of  
safety and inspection—in town  
county meetings, as well as in private  
conversations! so that the whole peo­  
ple, in every colony, have now adopted  
it as their own act. This will cement  
the union, and avoid those heats, and  
perhaps convulsions, which might  
have been occasioned by such a dec­  
laration six months ago.  
and  
But the day is past. The second day  
memorable  
of July, 1776, will be a  
epocha in the history of America. I  
am apt to believe that it will be cele­  
brated by succeeding generations,  
tbe great Anniversary Festival. It  
ought to be commemorated, as the day  
of deliverance, by solemn acts of de­  
votion to God Almighty. It ought to  
be solemnized with pomp, shows,  
games, sports, guns, belis, bonfires aud  
illuminations from one end of the con­  
tinent to the other, from this time  
forward forever.  
as  
You may think me transported with  
enthusiasm; but I am not. I am well

Philadeiphia, July 3, 1776.  
Had a declaration of independence  
been made seven months ago, it would  
have been attended with many great  
and glorious effects. We might, before  
this hour, have formed alliance with  
foreign states. We should have mas­  
tered Quebec, and been in possession  
of Canada,  
You will, perhaps, wonder how such  
a declaration would have influenced  
our affairs in Canada; but, if I could  
write with freedom, I could easily  
convince you that it would, and  
explain to you the manner how. Many  
gentlemen in high stations, and of  
great influence have been duped, by  
the ministerial bubble of commission­  
ers, to treat; and in real, sincere ex­  
pectation of this event, which they so  
fondly wished, they have been slow  
and languid in promoting measures for  
the reduction of that province. Others  
there are in the colonies who really  
wished that our enterprise in Canada  
would be defeated; that the colonies  
might be brought into danger and dis­  
tress between two fires, and be thus  
induced to submit. Others really  
wished to defeat the expedition to  
Conada, lest the conquest of it should  
elevate the minds of the people too  
much to hearken to those terms of rec­  
onciliation which they believed would  
be offered us. These jarring views,  
wishes and designs occasioned an op­  
position to many salutary measures  
which were proposed for the support  
of that expedition, and caused ob­  
structions, embarrassments, and stud­  
led delays which have finally lost us  
the province.  
All these causes, however, in con­  
sunction, would not have disappointed  
us if it had not been for a misfortune  
which could not have been foreseen,  
and perhaps could not have been pre­  
vented--I mean the prevalence of the  
smallpox among our troops. This fa­  
tal pestilence completed our destruc­  
tion. It is a frown of Providence upon  
us, which we ought to lay to heart.  
But, on the other hand, the delay of  
this declaration to this time has many  
great advantages attending it. The  
hopes of reconcfliation which were  
fondly entertained by multitudes of  
honest and well-meaning, though  
shortsighted and mistaken people,  
have been gradually, and at last totally  
extinguished. Time has been given  
for the whole people maturely to con­  
sider the great question of independ­  
ence, and to ripen their judgment, dis­  
sipate their fears, and allure their  
hopes, by discussing it in newspapers  
and pamphlets--by debating it in as­  
semblies, conventions, committees of  
safety and inspection--in town and  
county meetings, as well as in private  
conversations! so that the whole peo­  
ple, in every colony, have now adopted  
it as their own act. This will cement  
the union, and avoid those heats, and  
perbaps convulsions, which might  
have been occasioned by such a dec­  
laration six-months ago.  
But the day is past. The second day  
of July, 1776, will be a memorable  
apocha in the history of America. I  
am apt to believe that it will be cele­

enthuslasm; but I am not. I am wen

declaration, and support and defend  
these states. Yet, through all the

Philadelphia, July 3, 1773  
Had a declaration of independence  
been made seven months ago, it would  
have been attonded with many great  
and glorious effects. We might, before  
this hour, have formed alliance with  
foreign states. We should have mas  
tered Quebec, and been in possession  
of Canada  
You will, perhaps, wonder how such  
a declaration would have influenced  
our affairs in Canada; but, if I could  
write with freedom, I could easily  
convince you that it would, and  
explain to you the manner how. Many  
gentlemen in high stations, and of  
great influence have been duped, by  
the ministerial bubble of commission  
ers, to treat; and in real, sincere ex  
pectation of this event, which they so  
fondly wished, they have been slow  
and languid in promoting measures for  
the reduction of that province. Others  
there are in the colonies who really  
wished that our enterprise in Canada  
would be defeated; that the colonies  
might be brought into danger and dis  
tress between two fires, and be thus  
induced to submit. Others really  
wished to defeat the expedition to  
Canada, lest the conquest of it should  
elevate the minds of the people too  
  
much to hearken to those terms ofr  
onciliation which they believed would  
be offered us. These jarring view  
wishes and designs occasioned an op  
position to many salutary measures  
which were proposed for the support  
of that expedition, and caused ob  
structions, embarrassments, and stud  
ied delays which have finally lost us  
the province  
All these causes, however, in con­  
junction, would not have disappointed  
us if it had not been for a misfortune  
which could not have been foreseen  
and perhaps could not have been pre  
vented- I mean the prevalence of the  
smallpox among our troops. This fa­  
tal pestilence completed our destrue­  
tion. It is a frown of Providence upon  
us, which we ought to lay to heart  
But, on the other hand, the delay of  
this declaration to this time has many  
great advantages attending it. The  
hopes of reconciliation which were  
fondly entertained by multitudes of  
honest and well-meaning, though  
shortsighted and mistaken people  
have been gradually, and at last totally  
extinguished. Time has been given  
for the whole people maturely to con-­  
sider the great question of independ  
ence, and to ripen their judgment dis  
sipate their fears, and allure their  
hopes, by discussing it in newspapers  
and pamphlets--by debating it in as  
semblies, conventions, committees of  
safety and inspection--in town and  
county meetings, as well as in private  
conversations! so that the whole peo­  
ple, in every colony, have now adopted­  
it as their own act. This will cement  
the union, and avoid those heats, and  
perhaps convulsions, which might  
have been occasioned by such ad  
laration six months ago  
But the day is past. The second day  
of July, 1776, will be a memorable  
epocha in the history of America. I­  
am apt to believe that it will be cele  
hrated by succeeding generations, as  
the great Anniversary Festival. It  
ought to he commemorated, as the day  
of deliverance, by solemn acts of de  
votion to God Almighty. It ought to  
be solemnized with pomp, shows  
games, sports, guns, bells, bonfires and  
illuminations from one end of the con­  
tinent to the other, from this time  
forward forever  
You may think me transported with  
enthusiasm; but I am nof. I am well  
aware of the toil and blood and treas  
ure that it will cost us to maintain this  
declaration, and support and defend  
these states. Yet, through all the  
gloom, I can see the rays of light and  
glory; I can see that the end is more  
than worth all the means, and that  
posterity will triumph, although you

Philadelphia, July 3,1776.  
Had a declaration of Independence  
been made seven months ago, it would  
have been attended with many great  
and glorious effects. We might, before  
this hour, have formed alliance with  
foreign states. We should have mas­  
tered Quebec, and been In possession  
of Canada.  
You will, perhaps, wonder how such  
a declaration would have influenced  
our affairs In Canada; but, if I could  
write with freedom, I could easily  
convince you that it would, and  
explain to you the manner how. Many  
gentlemen in high stations, and of  
great Influence have been duped, by  
the ministerial bubble of commission­  
ers, to treat; and in real, sincere ex­  
pectation of this event, which they so  
fondly wished, they have been slow  
and languid in promoting measures for  
the reduction of that province. Others  
there are In the colonies who really  
wished that our enterprise in Canada  
would be defeated; that the colonies  
might be brought Into danger and dis­  
tress between two fires, and be thus  
Induced to submit Others really  
wished to defeat the expedition to  
Canada, lest the conquest of it should  
elevate the minds of the people too  
much to hearken to those terms of rec­  
oncillatlon which they believed would  
be offered ua. These jarring views,  
wishes and designs occasioned an op­  
position to many salutary measures  
which were proposed for the support  
of that expedition, and caused ob­  
structions, embarrassments, and stud­  
ied delays which have finally lost us  
the province.  
All these causes, however, In con­  
junction, would not have disappointed  
us If It had not been for a misfortune  
which could not have been foreseen,  
and perhaps could not have been pre­  
vented—I mean the prevalence of the  
smallpox among our troops. This fa­  
tal pestilence completed our destruc­  
tion. It Is a frown of Providence upon  
us. which we ought to lay to heart.  
But. on the other hand, the delay of  
this declaration to this time has many  
great advantages attending it The  
hopes of reconciliation which were  
fondly entertained by multitudes of  
honest and well-meaning, though  
shortsighted and mistaken people,  
have been gradually, and at last totally  
extinguished. Time has been given  
for the whole people maturely to  
aider the great question of independ­  
ence. and to ripen their Judgment, dis­  
sipate their fears, and allure their  
hopes, by discussing it in newspapers  
and pamphlets—by debating it in as­  
semblies, conventions, committees of  
safety and Inspection—in town and  
county meetings, as well as in private  
conversations! so that the whole peo­  
ple, in every colony, have now adopted  
it as their own act. This will cement  
the union, and avoid those heats, and  
perhaps convulsions, which might  
have been occasioned by such a dec­  
laration six months ago.  
But the day is past. Tha second day  
of July, 1776, will be a memorable  
epochs in the history of America. I  
am apt to believe that it will be cele­  
brated by succeeding generations,

pomp, shows,

illuminations from one end of the con­

It will be remembered that the resolution  
“for Independency&quot; was debated In the  
continental congress on the first and sec­  
ond of July, 1776, and adopted on the sec­  
ond. The ablest and most eloquent cham­  
pion of its adoption was John Adams,  
whose enthusiasm and zeal for the cause  
won him the title of &quot;the Colossus of Inde­  
pendence.&quot; His great speech has been ut­  
terly lost to posterity, for the proceedings  
of congress were not reported, but some  
Idea of it may be gained from a letter  
written by him to bis wife on the 3d of  
July. After recounting the passage of the  
resolution he says;  
The second day of July, 1776. will be the
