[New York, December 24, 1801]  
  
Had our laws been less provident than they have been, yet must it give us a very humble idea of the talents of our President as a statesman, to find him embarrassed between an absolute abandonment of revenue, and an inconvenient accumulation of treasure. Pursuing the doctrine professed by his sect, that our public debt is a national curse which cannot too promptly be removed, and adhering to the  
One of the essential principles of government, is, “the honest payment of our debts and sacred preservation of the public faith.”—Inaugural Speech.  
assurance which he has virtually given, that a sponge, the favorite instrument, shall not be employed for the purpose, how has it happened that he should have overlooked the simple and obvious expedient of using the supposed excess of income as a remedy for so great a mischief?  
After all we have heard in times past, it would ill become either the head, or any member, of the orthodox sect to contend, that a too rapid reimbursement of the debt might be attended with evils. In c[o]urtesy however, this shall be supposed to be urged by some new convert, who has not entirely shaken off the prejudices of former modes of thinking; and it shall be examined, whether this argument will afford a justification of the measure recommended.  
It shall not be denied, that the immediate payment of our whole debt, if practicable, would be likely to be injurious in various ways. It would, in the first instance, produce a money-plethora, (if the phrase may be allowed,) which experience has shewn to be inauspicious to the energies, and especially to the morality and industry of a nation. The quick efflux of this money to pay a considerable part of the debt in the hands of foreigners, and to procure from abroad the means of gratifying an increased extravagance, would, after some time, substitute a too great vacuity to a too great fulness; leaving us to struggle with the bad habits incident to the latter state, and with the embarrassments of a defective circulation. To these, other reasons might be added, which, though equally just and solid, are omitted as being more liable to dispute.  
Tho’ an extreme case is here presented, the immediate reimbursement of the entire debt; yet it must be admitted, that the same considerations are applicable in a less degree to a summary, or very rapid repayment by large instalments. But the answer to all this is, that it would have been full time to adopt precautionary measures against evils from such a source, when experience had realized the danger. Till such time it is certainly the highest wisdom to continue the employment of a fund which is already provided, and without overburdening the people, for the all important purpose of exonerating our nation from debt, and of placing it in a condition, with competent resources to meet future contingencies which may threaten its safety. On the other hand, is it not a mark of the highest improvidence and folly, to throw away an important part of this fund on the mere speculation that it may possibly be superfluous?  
But admitting it to be already ascertained, that the fund is greater than is requisite to extinguish the debt, with convenient celerity; does it follow that the excess, if retained, must be suffered to accumulate, and that no different method could have been found to employ it which would have been productive of adequate utility?  
Whatever diversity of opinion there may be with regard to military and naval preparations, for the defence and security of the country, there are some things in which all well-informed and reflecting men unite. Arsenals, founderies, dock-yards and magazines, (especially those containing materials for the construction and equipment of ships,) so that upon the breaking out of a war there may be a sufficient supply of warlike implements, and of means for the speedy creation of a navy; are by all deemed eligible objects of public care. To provide for these objects upon a competent, though moderate scale, will be attended with expence so considerable, as to leave nothing to spare from the amount of our present income. To persons unacquainted with the subject, the quantities of several articles on hand may appear ample; but to good judges there is hardly any one class of supplies which will not be thought to require much augmentation. As far as a navy is concerned, the deficiency is palpable.  
If dock-yards are to be established in earnest, they ought certainly to be well protected. For this purpose, fortifications of a substantial and durable nature, very different from the temporary shifts hitherto adopted, ought to be erected. And if the President will enquire into the cost of even these trifling constructions, in the instances where they have been managed with all practicable œconomy, he will become convinced that the erection of proper works would call for an expenditure forbidding the supposition of a superfluity of revenue.  
In addition to objects of national security, there are many purposes of great public utility to which the revenues in question might be applied. The improvement of the communications between the different parts of our country is an object well worthy of the national purse, and one which would abundantly repay to labor the portion of its earnings, which may have been borrowed for that purpose. To provide roads and bridges is within the direct purview of the constitution. In many parts of the country, especially in the Western Territory, a matter in which the Atlantic States are equally interested, aqueducts and canals would also be fit subjects of pecuniary aid, from the general Government. In France, England, and other parts of Europe, institutions exist supported by public contributions, which eminently promote agriculture and the arts: such institutions merit imitation by our government: they are of the number of those which directly and sensibly recompense labor for what it lends to their agency.  
To suggestions of the last kind, the adepts of the new-school have a ready answer: Industry will succeed and prosper in proportion as it is left to the exertions of individual enterprise. This favorite dogma, when taken as a general rule, is true; but as an exclusive one, it is false, and leads to error in the administration of public affairs. In matters of industry, human enterprize ought, doubtless, to be left free in the main, not fettered by too much regulation; but practical politicians know that it may be beneficially stimulated by prudent aids and encouragements on the part of the Government. This is proved by numerous examples too tedious to be cited; examples which will be neglected only by indolent and temporising rulers, who love to loll in the lap of epicurean ease, and seem to imagine that to govern well, is to amuse the wondering multitude with sagacious aphorisms and oracular sayings.  
What has been observed, is sufficient to render it manifest, that independent of the extinguishment of the Debt, the revenues proposed to be yielded up, would find ample and very useful employment for a variety of public purposes. Already in possession of so valuable a resource; having surmounted the difficulties, which, from the opinions and habits of our citizens, obstruct, in this, more than in any other country, every new provision for adding to our public income; certainly without a colourable pretence of there being a grievous or undue pressure on the community—how foolish will it be to resign the boon, perhaps in a short time to be compelled again to resort to it; and for that purpose to hazard a repetition of the obstacles which have been before encountered and overcome; which, however, gave birth to one insurrection, and may give birth to another? Infatuated must be the councils from which so injurious a project has proceeded!  
But admitting the position that there is an excess of income which ought to be relinquished, still the proposal to surrender the internal revenue is impolitic. It ought to be carefully preserved, as not being exposed to the casualties incident to our intercourse with foreign nations, and therefore the most certain. It ought to be preserved, as reaching to descriptions of persons who are not proportionably affected by the impost, and as tending for this reason, to distribute the public burden more equitably. It ought to be preserved, because if revenue can really be spared, it is best to do it in such a manner as will conduce to the relief or advancement of our navigation and commerce. Rather let the tonnage duty on American vessels be abolished, and let the duties be lessened on some particular articles on which they may press with inconvenient weight. Let not the merchant be provoked to attempt to evade the duties, by the sentiment that his ease or interest is disregarded, and that his capital alone is to be clogged and incumbered by the demands of the treasury.  
But who and what are the merchants when compared with the patriotic votaries of whiskey in Pennsylvania and Virginia?  
  
Lucius Crassus.

evils from such a source, when experience had rea-

the highest wisdom to continue the employment  
of a fund, which is already provided, and without

sources to meet future contingencies, which may  
threaten its safety. On the other hand, is it not  
a mark of the highest improvidence and folly, to  
throw away an important part of this fuud, on U:ie  
mere speculation that it may possibly be super-  
fluous?  
  
But admitting it to be already ascertained, that  
the fund is greater than what is requisite lo cxtin-  
guish the debt, with convenient celerity ; does it  
follow that the excess, if retained, must be suffcr-  
ed to accumulate, and that no different methed  
could have been found to employ it, which would  
have been productive of adequate utility?  
  
Whatever diversity of opinion there may ba,  
with regard to military and naval preparation, for  
the defence and security of the country, there are  
some things, in which all well-informed and reflect-  
ing men unite. Arsenals, foynderies, dock-yarcs  
and magazines, especially those containing mateti-  
als for the construction and equipment of ships, sa  
that, upon the breaking out of a war, there may  
be a sufficient supply of warlike implements, and  
of means for tle speedy creation of a navy; are  
by all deemed eligible objects of public care. To  
provide for these objects, upon a competent, though  
moderate scale, will be attended with expense so  
considerable, as to leave nothing to spare from the  
amount of our present income, ‘To persons un-  
acquainted with the subject, the quantities of se-  
veral articles on hand may appear ample; but, to  
good judges, there is hardly any one class’ of sup-  
plies, which will not be thought to require much  
augmentation. As far as a navy is concerned, the  
deficiency is palpable.  
  
If dock-yards are to be established in earnest,  
they ought certainly to be well protected. For  
this purpose, fortifications of a substantial and du-  
rable nature, very different from the temporary  
shifts hitherto adopted, ought to be erected. And  
if the president will inquire into the cost of evea  
these trifling constractions, in the instances where  
they have been managed with all practicable eco-  
nomy, he will become convinced, that the erection  
of proper works would call for an expenditure for-  
bidding the supposition of a superfluity of revenue,  
  
In addition to objects of national security, there  
are many purposes of great public utility, to  
which the reyenues in question might be applied.  
The improyement of the communications between  
the different parts of our country, js an gbject well  
worthy of the national purse, and one, which would  
abundantly repay to /adour the portion of its earn-  
ings, which may have been borrowed for that pur-  
pose. To provide roads and bridges, is within  
the direct purview of the constitution. In many  
parts of the country, especially in the Western  
Territory, a matter, in which the Atlantic states  
are equally interested, aqueducts and canals would  
also be fit subjects of pecuniary aid, from the ge-  
neral government. In France, England, and other  
parts of Europe, institutions exist supported by  
public contributions, which eminently promote  
agriculture and the arts: such institutions merit  
imitation by our government; they are of the  
number of those, which, directly and sensibly, re-  
compense labour, for what it lends to their agency.  
  
Yo suggestions df the last kind, the adepts of  
the new school have a ready answer: Jadustry will  
succeed and prosper, in proportion as ii is left to the  
exertions of individual enterprige. This vbarite  
dogma, when taken as a genefakrule, is true; but,  
as an exclusive one, it is false, and leads to erron  
in the adminjstration of public affairs. Ty muticts  
  
4  
  
of industry, human enterprise ought, doubtless, to  
be leit free in the main, not fettered by too much  
regulation ; but practical politicians know, that it  
may be beneficially stimulated, by prudent aids  
and encouragements on the partof the government.  
This is proved by numerous examples, too tedious  
to be cited: examples, which will be neglected  
only by indolent and temporising rulers, who love  
to loll in the lap of epicurean ease, and seem to  
imagine, that to govern well, is to amuse the won-  
dering multitude with sagacious aphorisms and  
oracular sayings.  
  
What has been observed, is sufficient to render  
it manifest, that, independent of the extinguish-  
mentof the debt, the revenues proposed to be yield-  
ed up, would find ample and very useful employ-  
ment, for a variety of public purposes. Already  
in possession of so valuable a resource; having  
surmounted the difficulties, which, from the opi-  
  
“nions and habits of our citizens, obstruct, in this,  
more than in any other country, every new provi-  
sion for adding to our public income; certainly  
without a colourable pretence for there being a  
grievous or undue pressure on the community...  
how foolish will it be to resign the boon, perhaps  
in a short time to be compelled again to resort to  
it; and, for that purpose, to hazard a repetition of  
the obstacles, which have been before encountered  
and overcome ; which, however, gave birth to one  
insurrection, and my give birth to another? In-  
fatuated must be the councils, from which so inju-  
rious a project has proceeded!  
  
But admitting the position, that there is an ex-  
cess of income, which ought to be relinquished,  
still the proposal to surrender the internal revenue  
is impolitic. It ought to be carefully preserved,  
as not being exposed to the casualties, incident to  
our intercourse with foreign nations, and therefore  
the most certain.....[t ought to be preserved, as  
reaching to descriptions of persons, who are not  
proportionably affected by the impost, and as tend-  
ing for this reason, to distribute the public burden  
more equitably......lt ought to be preserved, be-  
cause, if revenue can really be spared, itis best to  
do it in such a manner, as will conduce to the re-  
lief or advancement of our navigation and com-  
merce. Rather let the tonnage duty on American  
vessels be abolished, and let the duties be lessened  
on some particular articles, on which they may  
press with inconvenient weight. Let not the  
merchant be provoked to attempt to evade the du-  
ties, by the sentiment, that his easc or interest is  
disregarded, and that his capital alone is to be  
clogged and encumbered by the demands of the  
treasury.  
  
But who and what are the merchants, when com-  
pared with the patriotic votaries of whisky in  
Pennsylvania and Virginia !

MESSAGE.  
  
AD our laws been lefs provident than  
they have been, yet muft it give us a  
very--bumble idea of the talents of our Prefi-  
  
_dentas a flatefman, to find him embarrafled  
, between an abfohuie abandonment of revenue,  
_ and an inconvenient gccumulation of treafure.

&#x27; has it happened that he fhould have over.

a too rapid reimburfement of the debt might  
be attended with evils. In curtefy however,  
  
,this fhall be fuppofed to be urged by fome  
  
new convert, who has not @ntirely fhaken off  
  
the prejudices of former modes of thinking ;  
ana it fhall be examined, whether this argy.  
ment will afford a juftification of the meafure  
  
recommended.  
It fhall not be denied, that the immediate  
payment of our whole debt, if pra€ticable,  
  
would be likely to be injurious in various  
  
ways. It would, in the firft inftance, pro-  
  
duce amoney-plethora, (if the phrafe may be  
allowed,) which experience has fhewn to be  
inaufpicious to the energies, and efpecially to  
the morality and induftry of a nation.  
  
Te  
  
quick efflux of this money to pay a confidera-  
  
ble part of the debt in the hands of forcigners,  
  
and to procure from abroad the means of  
  
gratifying an increafed extravagance, would,  
  
after fome time, fubflitute atoo great vacuity  
to atoo great fulnefs; leaving us to ftruggle  
with the bad habits incident to the latter flate,  
and with the embarraflments of a defeétive  
circulation. To thefe, other reafons might  
be added, which, though equally juft and  
folid, are omitted as being more liable to dif.  
pute.- :  
  
Tho’ an extreme cafe is here prefented, the  
immediate reimburlfement of the entire debt ;  
yet it muft be admitted, that the fame confid-  
erations are applicable in alefs degree to a  
fummary, or very rapid repayment by large  
inftalments. But the anfwer to al! this ts,  
that it would have been full time to adopt  
precautionary meafures again{t evils trot tuch  
a fource, when experience had realized the  
danger. Till fuch time it is certainly the  
higheft wifdom to continue the employment  
of a fund whichis already provided, and with-  
out overburdening the peop!e, forthe all im-  
portent purpofe of exonerating our nation  
rom debt, and of placing it in a condition,  
with competent refourées to meet future con-  
tingencies which may threaten its fafety. On  
the other hand, is it not a mark of the higheit  
improvidence and folly, to throw away ail  
important part of this fund on the mere {pecu-  
lation that it may poflibly be fuperfluous’?  
But admitting it to be already afcertained,  
that the fund is greater than is requifite to ex-  
tinguifh the debt, with convenient celerity ;  
does it follow that the excefs, if retained,  
muft be fuflered to accumulate, and that no  
different method could have been found to  
employ it which would have been productive  
of adequate utility ?  
  
Whatever diverfity of opinion there may  
be with regard to military and naval pre-  
parations, for the defence and feturity of the  
counrtry, there are fume thingsin which all  
well-informed and refle€iing men unite. Ar-  
fenals, tounderies, deck-yards and magazines,  
(efpecially thofe containing materials for the  
  
-conitruétion and equipment ot {hips,) fo that

&#x27;  
’  
&#x27;  
  
upon a competent, though moderate {cale, will |  
be attended with expence fo confiderable, as |  
  
to leave nothing to {pare from the an ount of  
  
our gue income.  
  
To perfons unacquainted with the fubjeét,  
the quantities of feveral articles on hand  
may appear ample ; but to good J yur Iges there  
is hardly any one clafs of fupplies which will  
not be thoug! it to reqt ulre much augmentation.  
As far as a navy is concerned, the deficiency  
is pelpable.  
  
f dock-yards are to be eftablifhed in earn-  
eft, they ought certaiuly to be wel! protected,  
For this purpoie, fortifications of a fubftantial  
and owatys nature, very different from the  
temporary fhifts hitherto adopted, ought to be  
erected. And if the Prefident will enquire  
into the coft of even thefe trifling conftruc-  
tions, in the inftances where they have been  
managed with all praéticable economy, he  
will become convinced that the ereétion of  
proper works would call for an expenditure  
forbidding the fuppofition of a fuperflu-  
ity of revenue.  
  
In addition to objets of national fecurity,  
there are many purpofes of great public utility  
to which the revenues in queltion might be  
applied. The improvement of the commu-  
nications between the different parts of our  
country is an objeét well worthy of the na-  
tional purfe, and one which woul 4 abundant-  
ly repay ¢o labor the portion of its earnings,  
which may have been borrowed tor that pur-  
  
ofe. ‘To provide roads and bridges is with-  
in the direét purview of the fy xg

imitation by our government t they are ot  
the number of thofe which direét! y and fenfi-  
bly recompenfe /abor tor what it lends to

To {uggeftions of the laft kind, the adepts  
of the new f{chool have a ready iy : In.  
duftry will Jucceed and pro, /ber in propor-  
tion as it is left to the exertion of individu-  
al ent rprize. This favorite dogma,  
taken as a general rule, is true ; but as an ex-  
clufive one, it is falfe and leads to errors in  
the adminiftration of public affairs. In mat-  
ters of induftry, human enterprize ought,  
doubtlefs, to be left free in the main, not fet-  
tered by too much regulation ; but praétical  
politicians know that it may be beneficially  
ftimulated by prudent aids and encourage-  
ments on the part of the government. T his  
is proved by numerous examples too tedt-  
ous to be cited; examples which will be  
neglected oniy by indolent and temporifing  
rulers, who love ¢o loll in the lap of epicure.  
  
when  
  
  
  
  
  
an eafe, and feem to imagine that tg govern  
well, isto amufe the wondering muititude  
with fagacious aphorifms and oracalar fay-  
ings. What has been obferved, is fufficient  
to render it manifeft, that independ lent of the  
extincuifhment of the debt, the revenues  
propofed to be yielded up, would find ample  
and very ufeful employment for a variety of  
public purpofes. Already in polfeffion of  
fo valuable a refource ; having furmounted  
the difficulties, which, from the opinions and  
habits of our citizens, obftruét, in this, more  
than in any other country, every new provi-  
fion for adding to our public income ; cer-  
tainly without a colou rable pretence of their  
being a guevious or undue prefiure on the  
community—how foolifh will it be to refign  
the boon, perhaps in a fhort time to be com-  
pelled again to refort to it: &amp; forthat purpofe  
to hazard a repetition of the obftacles which  
have been before encountered and overcome ;  
which, however, gave birth to one infurrec-  
tion, and may give birth to another ? Infat-  
uated muft be the councils from which fo  
injurious a projeét has power:  
  
But admitting the pofition that there 1s an  
excefs of income which ought to be relin-  
quifhed, fti!l the propofal to furrender the  
internal revenue is impolitic. It ong! ht to  
be carefully preferved, as not being expofed  
to the cafualties incident to our intercourfe  
with foreign nations, and therefore the moft  
certain—It ought to be preferved as reaching  
to defcriptions of perfons who are not pro-  
portionably affetted by the impoft, and as  
tending for this reafon, to diftribute the pub-  
lic burden more equitably—lIt ought to be  
preferved, becaufe 1f ‘revenue can really be  
{pared, it is beit to do it in fuch a manner as  
will conduce to the relief or advancement of

bolifhed, and let the duties be leffened on  
fome particular articles on which they may  
prefs with inconvenient weight. Let not the  
merchant be provoked to attempt to evade  
the duties, by the fentiment that his eafe or  
intereft is dif egarded, and that his capital a-  
lone is to be clogged and incumbered by the  
demands of the treafury.

HAD our.jaws been less provident than  
\ they have&#x27; been, yet mast it give_us a  
very humble idea of the talcﬁ’;‘oﬁ our Pre­  
sident as a flatefman, to find his embarrail­  
_&amp;C betwecu an ablolute ebanconniiat of re­  
venue, and an inconvenicnt accumulation of  
treasure. Pursuing the dofirine profelied  
by his fe&amp;, that our public debt is a nation­  
al-cur/c which cannot too promptly be re­  
moved, and adhering to the assurance which  
he has virtually given, that a {ponge, t/4¢ fa­  
vorite infirument, thall not be employed for  
the purpole, how has it happened that he  
should have overlooked the simple and ob­  
vious expedient of ufling the fuppoled ex­  
cess of income asa remedy for so great a  
mifchief ¥  
Afrer all we have Hedrd in times palt, it  
would ill become either the head, or any  
member of the orthodox Jeét to contend,  
that a too rapid reimbursement of the debe  
ight be attended with evils. In curtefey  
ﬁowcvcr, this shall be fuppoled to be urged  
by some new convert, who has not entirecly  
shaken off the prejudices of former modes of  
thinking ; and it shall be&#x27;examined, whether  
this argument will afford a juftification of  
the mealure recommended.  
It shall not be denied, that the immediate  
payment of our whole debt, if prafticable,  
would be likely to be igjurious in various  
ways. It would, in the firft instance, pro­  
duce a money-plethora, (if the phrase may  
be allowed,) which experience has thewn to  
be inauspicious to the energies, and eipecial­  
}y to the morality and indufiry of a nation.  
The quick efflux of this money to pay a con­  
siderable part of the debt in the hands of fo­  
reigners, and to procure from abroad the  
means of gratifying an increaled extrava­  
gance, would, after some time, fubllitute a  
too great vacuity to a too great fuluels ;  
leaving vs to struggle with the bad habits in­  
cident to the latter {}ate, and with the em­  
barraflments of a defeftive circulation. To  
these, other reasons might be added, which,  
tho’ equally just and solid, are omitied as  
‘being more liable to dispute. _  
&quot;:l&#x27;go’ an e¢xtveme cale is here presented,  
the immediate reimbursement 6f the entire  
debt; yet it mufl @W ft_h_c,,.fw‘xe  
considerations are applicable 1n a less degree  
to a {ummary, or very rapid repayment by  
large inflalments. But the answer to all thys  
is, that it would have heen full time to a.  
dopt precautionary meaflures against evils  
from such a source, when experience had  
zealized the danger. Till such time it is cer­  
tainly the highcﬁ wisdom to continue theem­  
ployment of a fund which isalready provid­  
ed, &amp; without overburdening the people, for  
the all important purpole of exonerating  
our nation from debt, and of placingitin a  
condition, with competent resources to  
meet future contingencies which may threat­  
en its fafety. On the other hand, is it not  
a mark of the highest improvidence and fol­  
-Iy, to throw away an important part of this  
fund on the mere {peculation that it may  
poflibly be fuperfluous ?  
Bat admitting it to be already aflcertained,  
that the fund is already greater than is re­  
quisite to extinguish the debr, with conve­  
nient celerity ; does it follow that the ex­  
cess, if retained, most .be foffered to a¢cu­  
mulate, and that no different method could  
have been found to employ it which would  
have been produflive of adequate utility ?  
Whatever diversity of opinion there may  
be with regard to military and naval prepa­  
rations, for the defence and fecarity of the  
country, there are some things in which all  
well-informed and reflefting men unite.  
Arsenals, foundaries, dock-yards and maga­  
zines, (e{pecially those containing matersals  
for the conftruftion and equipment of ships, )  
so that upon;&amp;e breaking out of a war there  
amay be a {ufficient supply of warlike imple­  
ments, and of inea’ns“&amp;r the {peedy creation  
of a navy ;.are by all deemed eligibteob­  
je&amp;ts of public care. To provide for these  
abjels upon-a competent, though moderate  
scale, will be attended with expence {o con­  
siderable, as to leave nothing to {pare_from  
the amount of our prefentincome. To per­  
fags unacquainted with the [ubjeét, the quan­  
titics 6f {everal articles on hand mayappear  
ample ; butto good judges there is hardly  
any onec clafsiof ofupplies which will not be  
thought to.iqﬁmuchaugmcmation. As  
far as a navy 1s concerned, the deficiency is  
palpable. _ e  
If dock-xaffars&#x27; are to be eftablithed in earn­  
cft, they ought certainly to be well profeéi­  
ed. For this purpose, fortifications of a

_ To suggestions of the llaft kind, the adepts

ken as a general rule, is true ; but as an ex­  
clusive one, it is falfe, and leads to error in  
[ the administration of public affairs. In mat­

doubtless, to -be left free in the main, not  
fertered by too much regulation ;. but prac­

&#x27; cially stimulated by prudent aids and encous­

purpofe of exonerating our nation from debt,  
and of placing it in a condition, with compe­

which may threaten its fafety. On the other  
hand, is it not a mark of the highell improvi ,

Buc admitting it o be already afcertalr.ed,  
that the fund is already greater than is requi/ite

does it follow that the xcefs, if retained, mail  
be luff r J to accumulate, and that no differ­  
ent method could have been found to employ it  
which would have been productive of adequate  
Utility ?  
Whatever diverfity ot opinion there m’y be

In addition to «Hje£ts of national fecuruy, ,  
there are many pup &#x27;fe&gt; of great puhli- u i- ty  
to which the revenue* in q leftion might be  
applied. The improvement of the comma* i
