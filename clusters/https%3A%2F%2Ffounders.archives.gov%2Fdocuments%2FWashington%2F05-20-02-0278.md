ated in the treaty of 1791, that the boundary line is to be run and plainly marked by three persons appointed on the part of the U.S. and three Cherokees on the part of their nation: and that by the supplementary treaty of 1794 it is further stipulated, that “the Cherokee nation shall have ninety days notice of the time and place at which the commissioners of the U.S. intend to commence their operations.”  
Should the rule which is here laid down be followed, it would be late in November before the work of marking could even be commenced, which would necessarily throw its completion into the winter.  
This appeared to me an objection to entering upon it during the present year; and with other circumstances induced me to think that it might be undertaken with more propriety during the next.

tory with the office of superintendant of Indian affairs.  
So far that act divested its governor of the office. Does any other act authorise the President to appoint a superintendant or agent of Indian affairs?  
I think the act “to regulate trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes, and to preserve peace on the frontiers” passed the 19th of May ulto may be construed as having vested this power in the President.  
Granting licences to trade with the Indians or purchase articles from them are among the duties assigned to a superintendant.  
Sect. 3. of the act just quoted tho’ it contemplates two territorial districts provides nevertheless that no person shall go into any country allotted or secured by treaty to any of the Indian tribes South of the river Ohio, without a passport from the governor of some one of the U.S. or the officer of the troops of the U.S., commanding at the nearest post on the frontiers, or such other person, as the President of the U.S. may from time to time authorise to grant the same.  
  
Sect. 7. enacts that no person shall be permitted to reside at any of the towns, or hunting camps, of any of the Indian tribes as a trader, without a licence under the hand and seal of the superintendant of the department, or of such other person as the President of the U.S. shall authorise to grant licences for that purpose.  
Sect. 14. enacts, that if any Indian belonging to any tribe in amity with the U.S. shall come over or across the boundary line into any State or territory inhabited by citizens of the U.S. and there take steal or destroy any horse, horses, or other property, belonging to any citizen or inhabitant of the U.S., or of either of the territorial districts of the U.S. or shall commit any murder, violence, or outrage, upon such citizen, or inhabitant, it shall be the duty of such citizen or inhabitant, his representative attorney or agent to make application to the superintendant, or such other person as the President of the U.S. shall authorise for that purpose.  
From these and other parts of this act it appears that the President may authorise a person to reside within any of the States bordering upon Indian tribes, in amity with the U.S. and vest them with the powers and functions of superintendant of Indian affairs.  
Tenessee having become a State, and being organised, and admitted into the union as a State, the President has the same power to
