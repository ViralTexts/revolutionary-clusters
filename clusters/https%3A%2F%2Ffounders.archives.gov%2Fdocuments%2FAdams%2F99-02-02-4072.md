				While the House of Representatives contemplate the flattering prospects of abundance from the labors of the people by land and by sea, the prosperity of our extended commerce notwithstanding the interruptions occasioned by the belligerent state of a great part of the world, the return of health, industry, and trade to those cities which have lately been afflicted with disease, and the various and inestimable advantages, civil and religious, which, secured under our happy frame of Government, are continued to us unimpaired, we can not fail to offer up to a benevolent Deity our sincere thanks for these the merciful dispensations of His protecting providence.  
  
That any portion of the people of America should permit themselves, amid such numerous blessings, to be seduced by the arts and misrepresentations of designing men into an open resistance of a law of the United States can not be heard without deep and serious regret. Under a Constitution where the public burthens can only be imposed by the people themselves for their own benefit and to promote their own objects, a hope might well have been indulged that the general interest would have been too well understood and the general welfare too highly prized to have produced in any of our citizens a disposition to hazard so much felicity by the criminal effort of a part to oppose with lawless violence the will of the whole. While we lament that depravity which could produce a defiance of the civil authority and render indispensable the aid of the military force of the nation, real consolation is to be derived from the promptness and fidelity with which that aid was afforded. That zealous and active cooperation with the judicial power of the volunteers and militia called into service, which has restored order and submission to the laws, is a pleasing evidence of the attachment of our fellow-citizens to their own free Government, and of the truly patriotic alacrity with which they will support it.  
  
To give due effect to the civil administration of Government and to insure a just execution of the laws are objects of such real magnitude as to secure a proper attention to your recommendation of a revision and amendment of the judiciary system.  
  
Highly approving as we do the pacific and humane policy which has been invariably professed and sincerely pursued by the Executive authority of the United States, a policy which our best interests enjoined, and of which honor has permitted the observance, we consider as the most unequivocal proof of your inflexible perseverance in the same well-chosen system your preparation to meet the first indications on the part of the French Republic of a disposition to accommodate the existing differences between the two countries by a nomination of ministers, on certain conditions which the honor of our country unquestionably dictated, and which its moderation had certainly given it a right to prescribe. When the assurances thus required of the French Government, previous to the departure of our envoys, had been given through their minister of foreign relations, the direction that they should proceed on their mission was on your part a completion of the measure, and manifests the sincerity with which it was commenced. We offer up our fervent prayers to the Supreme Ruler of the Universe for the success of their embassy, and that it may be productive of peace and happiness to our common country. The uniform tenor of your conduct through a life useful to your fellow-citizens and honorable to yourself gives a sure pledge of the sincerity with which the avowed objects of the negotiation will be pursued on your part, and we earnestly pray that similar dispositions may be displayed on the part of France. The differences which unfortunately subsist between the two nations can not fail in that event to be happily terminated. To produce this end, to all so desirable, firmness, moderation, and union at home constitute, we are persuaded, the surest means. The character of the gentlemen you have deputed, and still more the character of the Government which deputes them, are safe pledges to their country that nothing incompatible with its honor or interest, nothing inconsistent with our obligations of good faith or friendship to any other nation, will be stipulated.  
  
We learn with pleasure that our citizens, with their property, trading to those ports of St. Domingo with which commercial intercourse has been renewed have been duly respected, and that privateering from those ports has ceased.  
  
With you we sincerely regret that the execution of the sixth article of the treaty of amity, commerce, and navigation with Great Britain, an article produced by a mutual spirit of amity and justice, should have been unavoidably interrupted. We doubt not that the same spirit of amity and the same sense of justice in which it originated will lead to satisfactory explanations, and we hear with approbation that our minister at London will be immediately instructed to obtain them. While the engagements which America has contracted by her treaty with Great Britain ought to be fulfilled with that scrupulous punctuality and good faith to which our Government has ever so tenaciously adhered, yet no motive exists to induce, and every principle forbids us to adopt, a construction which might extend them beyond the instrument by which they are created. We cherish the hope that the Government of Great Britain will disclaim such extension, and by cordially uniting with that of the United States for the removal of all difficulties will soon enable the boards appointed under the sixth and seventh articles of our treaty with that nation to proceed and bring the business committed to them respectively to a satisfactory conclusion.  
  
The buildings for the accommodation of Congress and of the President and for the public offices of the Government at its permanent seat being in such a state as to admit of a removal to that District by the time prescribed by the act of Congress, no obstacle, it is presumed, will exist to a compliance with the law.  
  
With you, sir, we deem the present period critical and momentous. The important changes which are occurring, the new and great events which are every hour preparing in the political world, the spirit of war which is prevalent in almost every nation with whose affairs the interests of the United States have any connection, demonstrate how unsafe and precarious would be our situation should we neglect the means of maintaining our just rights. Respecting, as we have ever done, the rights of others, America estimates too correctly the value of her own and has received evidence too complete that they are only to be preserved by her own vigilance ever to permit herself to be seduced by a love of ease or by other considerations into that deadly disregard of the means of self-defense which could only result from a carelessness as criminal as it would be fatal concerning the future destinies of our growing Republic. The result of the mission to France is indeed, sir, uncertain. It depends not on America alone. The most pacific temper will not always insure peace. We should therefore exhibit a system of conduct as indiscreet as it would be new in the history of the world if we considered the negotiation happily terminated because we have attempted to commence it, and peace restored because we wish its restoration. But, sir, however this mission may terminate, a steady perseverance in a system of national defense commensurate with our resources and the situation of our country is an obvious dictate of duty. Experience, the parent of wisdom and the great instructor of nations, has established the truth of your position, that, remotely as we are placed from the belligerent nations and desirous as we are, by doing justice to all, to avoid offense to any, yet nothing short of the power of repelling aggressions will secure to our country a rational prospect of escaping the calamities of war or national degradation.  
  
In the progress of the session we shall take into our serious consideration the various and important matters recommended to our attention.  
  
A life devoted to the service of your country, talents and integrity which have so justly acquired and so long retained the confidence and affection of your fellow-citizens, attest the sincerity of your declaration that it is your anxious desire so to execute the trust reposed in you as to render the people of the United States prosperous and happy

pica ling evidence of the attachment of our  
foils w citizens to their own free Government,  
and ot the tiuiy patriotic alacrity with which  
they will fupport it.  
To give due effect to the civil adminiftration  
of government, and to er.i&#x27;ure a juft execution  
&lt; f tile laws, are objedts ot inch teal magnitude  
as to fecurc a proper attention to your tecom­  
ir end.ition of a revilion and amendment ot the

Highly approving, as we do, the pacific and  
humane policy which has been invariably pro­  
ftffed snd fncerely purfued by the Executive  
authority of the United Statts, a policy which  
ottr heft interefts enjoined, and of which honor  
has permitted the obftrvance, we confider as  
tl e moft unequivocal proof of your inflexible  
pcrfcvtrance in the fame well chofen fyftcm,  
ye ur preparation to meet the tirfl indications on  
the part of the French Republic, of adifpofition  
to accommodate the exi fling differences between  
the two countries, by a nomination of Manlier?  
on certain conditions, which the honor of our  
country unqueftionably dictated, and wh&#x27;ch its  
moe&#x27;era ion haJ certainly given it a right to  
preferibe. When the affuranccs, thus required  
of rhe French Government, previous to the  
departure of our Envoys, had Ucn given  
through their Minifter of Foreign ♦Relations,  
the dii edlion that they fhould proceed on their 1  
niitlian, was on your part, a completion oi tlie j  
tneafjnre, and manifelled tic fincciity with »  
which it was comm need. We offer up our j  
  
fervent prayers to me oup-enu* ivuier ot tne  
Univeife for the fucceis &lt; f their Jtmb ifly, and  
that it may be productive ot peace and happi­  
ntf» to our common country. The uniform  
tenure ®f jour conduit through a life ufeful to  
yt ur fellow-citizens, and honorable to youtfclf,  
gives a fure pledge oi the finteiitv With which  
the avowed oljefts of the negotiation will be  
purfued on your part, end we earned v pray  
that (imilar difpofitions may be difplayed on  
the part of France. The differences which  
unfortunately fuWfift between the two nations,  
cannot fail,in &#x27;hat event, to be happily termi­  
nated. To product this end, to all fo dcdrable,  
firmnefs, moderati&#x27; n, and union at home, con­  
dilute, we are perfuaded, the furctl means.  
The chatailer of the gentlemen you have  
deputed, and dill more, the character of the  
government which deputes them, are pledges  
to their country, that nothing incompatible  
with its honor or intoed, nothing inconlident  
with our obligations of good faith or friendfh&#x27;p  
to any other nation, will be dipulated.  
We learn with pleafure, that ®ur citizens w ith  
their property, trading to thefe ports of Sc.  
Domingo with which commercial intercourle  
has teen renewed, have been duly refpeifleJ.  
and that privateering fiom ihofe ports has  
ceafeJ.  
With you, we fincerely regret that^the exe  
cution of the Vlth article of the treaty ot  
Amity. C mmerce and Navigation, with Great  
Britain, an article produced by a natural fpirit  
of amity and judice, fhould have been unavoid­  
ably interrupted. Wc doubt not that the lame  
fpiiit ol amity, and the fan e fenfe of jnfiice, in  
which it originated, will lead to fattsfa&amp;ory  
explanations 5 and we hear, with approbation  
that our Mi.iidcr at London will be inintedi­  
ately indiu&#x27;ted to obtain them. While the en­  
gagements which America has contra&amp;cd by  
her treaty with Gieat Britain, ought to be ful  
filled with that ferupuh us punctuality and good  
faith to which our government has ever lo tc.  
nacioufly adhered ; yet no motive exill* to  
induce, ami every principle forbids us to adopt  
a eondruflion which might extend them be­  
yond the irftiument by which they are created­  
We cherilh the hope that the government of

With you, fir, we deem the prefent period  
ci itical and momentous. The important clun

Experience, the patent of wifdom, and the great  
intti ut51or of n itions, has eftabhflied the truth of  
your pofition, that remotely as we are placed  
from the beligerent nations, and defirous as we

WHILE the House of Reprefentas  
tives contemplate the flattering prof­  
- pedts of abundance from the labours

-prosperity of our extended commerce,  
notwithstanding interrtiptions occa­

cities which have lately been affiicted

~eftimable advantages, civil and religi­  
ous, which, secured under our happy  
~frame of government, are continued  
&#x27;to us unimpz‘red, we canrhot fail to  
offer up to a benevolent IDeity, our  
sincere thanks, for these, the merciful  
dispensations of his prote®iog provi­  
dence.  
That any portion of the people of  
America, thould permit themselves,  
~amidft such numerous bleflings to 4¢  
Jeduced by the arts and misrepresentations  
of defingning wien into an open&#x27; resists  
ance of a law of the United ‘ States,  
cannot be heard without deep and  
serious regret- Under a constitution  
where the public burthens carn only  
be imposed by the people themselves,  
for their own benefit, and to promote  
their own objeéts, a hope might well  
have been indulged that the general  
interest would have been too well un­  
derstood and the general welfare too  
highly prized, to have produced in  
any of our citizens, a disposition to  
hazard so much felicity, by the crimi­  
nal effort of a part, to oppose, with  
lawless violence, the will of the whole.  
While we lament that depravity which  
could produce a defiance of the civil  
authority, and render indifpenfible the  
aid of the military force of the na.  
tion, real consolation is to be derived  
from the promptness and fidelity with  
which that aid was afforded.” The  
zealous and a&amp;ive co-operation with  
the judicial power, of the volunteers  
-and militia called into service, which  
has restored order and submission to  
the laws, is a pleasing evidence of the  
attachment OF our éllow-citizens to  
their own free Government, and of  
the truly patriotic alacrity with which  
they will support it. &#x27;  
To give due effe to the civil ads  
ministration of government, and to  
ensure a just execution of the laws,  
are objects of such real magnitude as  
to secure a proper attention to your  
‘recommendation of a revision and a­  
‘mendment of the judiciary system.  
Highly approving, as we do, the  
.prcific and humane policy which has  
been invariably profeffed and sincere.  
ly pursued by the Executive authori­  
ty of the United States, a policy which  
our belt interests enjoined, and of  
which honor has permitted the ob­

equivocal proof of your inflexible per­  
severance in the fame well-chosen sys:  
tem, your preparation to meet the §rit  
indications on the part of the French  
Republic, of a disposition to aceom-’  
modate theexilting differencesbetween  
the two countries, by a nomination of  
Ministers on certain conditions, which  
the honor of our country unquestion­  
ably ditated, and which its modera­

the part of the French Republic, of  
a dilpoiitiort to accommodate the  
exifting differenees between the  
two countries, by a nomination of  
Minifters on certain conditions,  
which the honour of our country  
unqueftionably dictated, and which  
its moderation had certainly given  
it a right to prefcribe. When the  
a ffu ranees thus required of the  
French Government previous to  
the departure of our Envoys, had  
been given through their Minifter  
of Foreign Relations, he direHion  
that they mould proceed on their  
million, was, on your part, a com­  
pletion of the meafure, and mani?  
feds the fincerity with which it was  
commenced. We offer-up our fer­  
vent prayers to the Supreme Ruler  
or toe umverle tor tne lucceis 01  
their embaffy, and that it mav be;  
productive of peace and happinels  
of our common country. The

jects of the negociation will be pur­  
fued on your part, and we earneflly  
pray, that fjmilar difpofitions may  
be difplayed on the part of France!  
The differences which unfortunately  
lubfi ft between the two nations  
cannot fail, in that event, to be hap  
pily terminated. To produce this  
end, to all fo dcfirable, hrmnels,  
! and moderation, and union at home,

G.entlemen you have deputed, and  
ftill more the character of the Go­  
vernment which deputes them, are  
fafe pledges to their country, that  
nothing incompatible with its honor  
or intereft, nothing inconfiftent  
witrt our obligations ot gooa iaun  
or friendfhip to any other nation  
will be llipulated.  
We learn,  
with pleafurea that  
oiir citizens,  
with their property,  
trading to thofe ports of St. Domin  
go with which commercial inter  
courfe has ben renewed, have been  
duly iefpeted, and that privateer  
ing from thofe ports has cealed.  
With you we fincerely regret that  
the execution d the iixth article ot  
the Treaty of amity, commerce and  
navigation with Great-Britain, an  
article produced by a mutual fpirit  
or amity an&#x27;d mltice, ihould have  
been unavoidably interrupted. We  
doubt not that the fame fpirit of  
amity, andthe famelfenfe of juftice  
in which it originated, will lead to  
fatis factory explanations ; and we  
hear with approbation, that our Mi­  
nifter at London will beimmediatelv  
inftructed to obtain them. While  
the engagements which America  
has contracted by her Treaty with  
Great-Britain, ought to be fulfilled&#x27;  
with that fcrupulous punctuality and  
good faith to which our Govern­  
ment has ever fo tenacioufly ad­  
hered ; yet no motive exifts to in­  
duce, and every principle forbids  
us to adopt a conftruction which  
might extend them beyond the in?  
ftrument by which they are created  
We cherifh the hope, that the Go­  
vernment of Great-Britain will dif­  
claim fuch extenfion, and by cor­  
dially uniting with that of the Tk  
States, for the removal, of all diffi­  
culties, will foon enable the Boards  
appointed under the fixth and fe­  
yen 1 h articles of our Treaty with  
that nation, &#x27; to proceed and bring  
the bufinefs committed to them, re­  
fpectively, to. a fatisfactory con­  
clufion.The buildings for the accommo­  
dation of Congrefs,&#x27;and of the Pre­  
fident, and for the public offices ot  
the Government, at its permanent  
feat, being in fuch a ftate asto ad­  
mit of a removal to that diftrict by  
the time prescribed by the acf of  
Congrefs, no obftacle, it is pre­  
fumed, will exift to a Compliance  
with the law. ; v vS  
With you, Sir, we deem the pre-:  
fent pei iod critical and momentous.  
The important changes which are  
o c curring, the new and great events  
which are every hour preparing in  
the political1 world the fpirit of  
war which is prevalent in almoft  
every nation with thofe affairs the

Un&#x27;fafe and precarious would be our  
fituation, fiiduld we neglect &#x27; the

Sir,  
  
Wulte the Houfe of Rep-  
refentatives contemplate the flat-  
tering profpects of abundance  
from the labours of the people,  
by land and by fea, the profperity  
of our extended commerce, not-  
with{tanding interruptions occa-  
fioned by the belligerent ftate of  
a great part of the world, the re-  
turn of health, induftry and trade,  
to thofe cities which have dately

not fail to offer up to a benevo-

for thefe, the merciful difpenfa-  
tions of his protecting provi-

60 THE COLUMBIAN PHENIX,  
  
the arts and mifreprefentation of  
  
defigning men into an open re-  
  
fiftance of a law. of the United  
  
States, cannot be heard without  
  
deep and ferious regret. Under  
  
a Conftitution where the public  
  
burthens can only be Re by  
the people themfelves, for their  
own benefit, and to promote their  
own objects, a hope might well  
  
have been indulged that the gen-  
eral intereft would have been too  
well underftood, and the general  
welfare too highly prized, to  
have produced in any ‘of our cit-  
izens, a difpofition to hazard fo  
much felicity, by the crimjnal ef-  
fort of a part, to oppofe, with  
lawlefs violence, the will of the  
whole. While we lament that  
depravity which could produce  
a defiance of the civil authority,  
and render indifpenfab! le the aid  
of the military force of the na-  
tion, real confolation is to be  
derived from the promptnefs and  
fidelity with which that aid was  
afforded. That zealous and ac-  
tive co-operation with the judi-  
cial power, of the volunteers  
and militia called into fervice,  
which has reftored order and  
fubmiffion to the laws, is a pleaf-  
ing evidence of the attachment of  
our .fellow-citizens to their own  
free Government, and of the  
truly patriotic alacrity with which  
they will fupport it.  
  
To give due effect to the civil  
adminiiiration of government, and  
to infure a juft execution of the  
laws, are objects of fuch real  
magnitude as to fecure a proper  
attention to your recommenda-  
tion of a revifion and amendment  
of the judiciary fyftem.  
  
Highly approving, as we do,  
the pacific and humane policy  
  
which has been invariably pro-  
  
fefled and fincerely purfued by  
  
the Executive authority of the  
United States, a policy which  
our beft interefts enjoined, and  
of which honour has permitted  
the obfervance, we confider as  
the molt unequivocal proof of  
your inflexible perfeverance in  
the fame well chofen fy{tem,  
your preparation to meet the firlt  
indications on the part of the  
French Republic, of a difpof-  
tion to accommodate the exifting  
differences between the two&lt; ‘coun-  
tries, by a nomination of Minif-  
ters on certain conditions, which  
the honour of our country up-  
queftionably digtated, and whieh  
its moderation had certainly  
given it a right to prefcribe,  
When the affurances, thus re-  
quired of the French Govern-  
ment, previous to the departure  
of our Envoys, bad been given  
through their Minifter of For-  
eign Kelations, the dire@tion that  
they fhould proceed on their  
miflion, was, on your part, a  
completion of the meafure, and  
manifefted the fincerity with  
which it was commenced. We  
offer up our feryent prayers te  
the Supreme Ruler of the Uni-  
verfe for the fuccefs of their Em-  
bafly, and that it may be produc-  
tive of peace and happinefs to  
our common country. The uni-  
form tenure of your condu¢  
through a life ufeful to your fel-  
low- citizens, and honourable to  
yourfelf, gives a fure pledge of  
the fincerity with which the  
avowed objects of the negociation  
will be purfued on your part, avd  
we carneftly pray that fimilar  
difpofitions may be difplayed on  
the part of France. The dif-

of ibe gentlemen vou have deputed, and  
ftiil more the character of the government

their country, that nothing incompatible  
with its honor or intercll, nothing incon-  
fiftent with our obligations of good faith  
or friendship to any other nation, will be  
stipulated.  
  
We learn, with pleafure, that our citi-  
gfna with their property trading to thofe  
ports of St. Domingo, with which com-  
iu • ciul intercourfe has been renewed,  
h.ive been dulv rePpec\ed, and that priva-  
teering from thofe ports has ceafed.  
  
With y &gt;u w: fmcerely regret that the  
ex cution o the 6th article of the treaty  
o&quot; amity, commerce and navigation with  
G&#x27;&quot;jat Britain, an article produced by a  
mutual fpirit of amity and juitiet, fhould  
have been unavoidably interrupted. We  
d~&gt;ubt not that the fame fpirit of amity,  
and the fame fenfe of juftice in which it  
originated, will lead to fatisfa/tory ex-  
planations ; and we hear with approbati-  
on, that ou- minifter at London will bt  
in: mediately instructed to obtain them.  
While the engagements which America  
h contracted by her treatv with Grea.  
Britain, ought to be fulfilled with thai  
fcrupulous punctuality and good faitli t  
which our government has ever fo tena  
cioufly adhered ; yet no motive exiits t  
induce, and every principle forbids us t  
adopt a conftruction which miglit extend  
tliein beyond the inftrument by which  
they are created. We cherilh the hop-  
that the government of Great Britain will  
difclaim fuch extention, and by cordially  
uniting with that of the United States for  
the removal of all difficulties, will foon  
enable the boards appointed under the 6th  
and 7th articles of our treaty with th.it  
nation, to proceed and bring the bulinels  
Committed to them refpeetively to a , la-  
tis factory conclufion.  
  
The buildings for the accommodation  
of congrefs, and of the prelident and ft r  
the public officers of the government, as  
its permanent feat, heingin fuch a date a?  
to admit of a removal to that dillriit by  
the time prffcriLuJ by the «Q of congrefs  
no obitacle it ii prefumed will exift, to a  
compliance with the law.  
  
With you, fir, we deem the prefent pe-  
riod critical Jrid momentous. The im-  
portant changes which are occurring, the  
new and great events which are every  
hour preparing in the political world, the  
fpirit of war which is prevalent in almoft  
every nation with whofe affairs the in-  
tereft of the United States have any con-  
ne lion, demonllrate howunlafe and pre-  
carious would be our fituation, fhould w e  
neglect the means of maintaining our juft  
rights. Ref petting, as we have ever done  
the rights of others, America climates  
too correctly the value of her own, and  
hai received evidence, too complete, that  
they are only to be preferved, bv her own  
vigilence, ever to permit herfelf to be fe-  
duced by a love of safe or by other con-  
fiderations, into that deadly difregard of  
the means of felf defence,&#x27; which could  
only refult from a careleffnefs as criminal  
as it would be fatal, concerning the fu-  
ture deftinies of our growing republic.  
The refult of the miffion to France is, in-  
deed fir, uncertain. It depends not on  
America alone. The moft pacific tern-  
P&quot; will not always infure peace. We  
B&amp;jld 1 hercfore exhibit a fyftem of conduct  
as indifcreet as it would be new in the hif-  
torv of the world, if we confider the nego-  
tiation happily terminated becaufe w  
have attempted to commence it, and peace  
reftored becaufe wa with its reitonttnj*.  
But, fir, however this mi.fion may termi-  
nate, a Ready perfe verance in a fyftern of na -  
tional defencccommenfurate with our re-  
sources, and the fituation of our country,  
is an obvious ditate ofduty. Experi-  
ence, the parent of wifdom, and the great  
inltruaor of nations, has eilablillieiT th  
truth of your pofition, that remotely as  
we are placed from the belligerent nations,  
and defirous as we are, by doing judice t  
all, to avoid offence to any, yet nothing  
Ihort of the power of repelling aggreffions  
will fecure to our country a rational prof  
pe tofefcaping the calamities of war o  
national degredation.  
  
In the progrefs of the feffion, we (hai!  
take into our Carious confideration the va
