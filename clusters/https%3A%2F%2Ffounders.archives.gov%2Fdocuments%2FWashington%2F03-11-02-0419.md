ear Pennibeckers Mill [Pa.] Octr 5: 1777.  
  
Having received intelligence through Two intercepted Letters, that Genl Howe had detached a part of his force for the purpose of reducing Billingsport and the Forts on Delaware, I communicated the Accounts to my Genl Officers, who were unanimously of Opinion, that a favourable Opportunity offered to make an Attack upon the Troops, which were at &amp; near German Town. It was accordingly agreed, that it should take place Yesterday morning and the following dispositions were made. The Divisions of Sullivan &amp; Wayne, flanked by Conways Brigade were to enter the Town by the way of Chesnut Hill, while Genl Armstrong with the Pensylvania Militia should fall down the Manatawny Road by Vandeerings Mill and get upon the Enemy’s left and Rear. The Divisions of Greene &amp; Stephen flanked by McDougals Brigade were to enter by taking a circuit by way of the Lime Kiln Road at the Market House &amp; to attack their Right wing, &amp; the Militia of Maryland &amp; Jersey under Genls Smalwood &amp; Foreman were to march by the Old York road and fall upon the rear of their Right. Lord Stirling with Nash &amp; Maxwell’s Brigades was to form a Corps de Reserve. We marched about Seven OClock the preceding Evening, and Genl Sullivans advanced party drawn from Conways Brigade attacked their picket at Mount Airy or Mr Allens House about Sun rise the next Morning, which presently gave way, and his Main body, consisting of the right Wing, following soon engaged the Light Infantry and Other Troops  
  
encamped near the picket which they forced from their Ground, leaving their Baggage. They retreated a considerable distance, having previously thrown a party into Mr Chews House, who were in a situation not to be easily forced, and had it in their power from the Windows to give us no small annoyance, and in a great measure to obstruct our advance.  
The Attack from our left Column under Genl Greene began about three Quarters of an Hour after that from the Right, and was for some time equally successfull. But I cannot enter upon the particulars of what happened in that Quarter, as I am not yet informed of them, with sufficient certainty and precision.  
The Morning was extremely foggy, which prevented our improving the advantages we gained so well, as we should otherwise have done. This circumstance, by concealing from us the true situation of the Enemy, obliged us to act with more caution and less expedition than we could have wished, and gave the Enemy time to recover from the effects of our first impression; and what was still more unfortunate, it served to keep our different parties in ignorance of each Others movements, and hindered their acting in concert. It also occasioned them to mistake One another for the Enemy, which, I believe, more than any thing else contributed to the misfortune which ensued. In the midst of the most promising appearances—when every thing gave the most flattering hopes of victory, the Troops began suddenly to retreat; and intirely left the Feild in spite of every effort that could be made to rally them.  
Upon the whole, it may be said the day was rather unfortunate, than injurious. We sustained no material loss of Men and brought off all our Artillery, except One peice which was dismounted; The Enemy are nothing the better by the event, and our Troops, who are not in the least dispirited by it, have gained what All young Troops gain by being in Actions. We have had however several valuable Officers killed and wounded—particularly the latter. Genl Nash is among the Wounded and his life is despaired of. As soon as it is possible to obtain a return of our loss, I will transmit it.  
In justice to Genl Sullivan and the whole right wing of the Army, whose conduct I had an Opportunity of observing, as they acted immediately under my eye, I have the pleasure to inform you, that both Officers &amp; Men behaved with a degree of Gallantry that did them the highest honor. I have the Honor to be with great respect Sir Your Most Obed. Servt  
  
Go: Washington  
  
  
  
P.S. As I have observed, I have not received a Return of ⟨our⟩ loss, but from what ⟨I have⟩ just now learnt from Genl Greene, I fear it is more considerable than I at first apprehended in Men.

the troop&#x27;i begin fmldeniy to retreat, and  
entirely left the field, in fpile of every  
eirort that could be made to rally the men.  
  
Upon the whole, it may be f.iid the  
day was rather unfortunate than injuri¬  
ous. We fultained no material lofs of  
men, and brought olf all our artillery,  
except one piece, which was difmounted.

light infantry and other troops encamped near the picket, which they forced from  
their ground. Leaving their baggage, they retreated a considerable distance, hav-  
ing previously thrown a party into Mr. Chew’s house, who were in a situation not  
to be easily forced, and had it in their power, from the windows, to give us no small  
annoyance, and in a great measure to obstruct our advance.  
  
a The attack from our left column, under General Greene, began about three  
quarters of an hour after that from the right, and was for some time equally suc-  
cessful. But I cannot enter upon the particulars of what happened in that quarter,  
as I am not yet informed of them with sufficient certainty and precision. The  
morning was extremely foggy, which prevented our improving the advantages we  
gained, so well as we should otherwise have done. This circumstance, by conceal-  
ing from us the true situation of the enemy, obliged us to act with more caution  
and less expedition than we could have wished; and gave the enemy time to recover  
from the effects of our first impression; and, what was still more unfortunate, it  
served to keep our different parties in ignorance of each other’s movements and  
hinder their acting in concert. It also occasioned them to mistake one another for  
the enemy, which I believe more than any thing else contributed to the misfortune  
that ensued. In the midst of the most promising appearances, when every thing  
gave the most flattering hopes of victory, the troops began suddenly to retreat, and  
entirely left the field, in spite of every effort that could be made to rally them.”
