Sir  
New Orleans 23d. April 1804  
  
Emboldened by the favourable mention you have been pleased to make of their order, the Nuns of St. Ursula at New Orleans, take the liberty of addressing you on a subject highly interesting to their institution! they believe that without any direct application, the treaty of cession, and the sense of Justice which marks the character of the United States, would have secured to them the property they now possess, but considering a sacred deposit, they would fail in a duty they deem essential were they to ommit requesting, that it may be formally confirmed to them, and their successors, and that you may be pleased to communicate this request to the Legislative body in such a manner as you may deem proper,—It is dictated by no wish of personal gratification or private agrandizement, secluded from the World, its luxuries and vanities, wealth and the enjoyments it brings, would to them have no attraction.—devoted to religious duties, temporal advantages are not the objects of their pursuits but bound by a solemn obligation to employ their revenue in charitable uses, &amp; their time in the education of Youth, they cannot but be anxious to know that the property which is to enable them to fulfil these duties will be secure to them,—it is not therefore their own cause but of the Publick which they plead—it is the cause of the Orphan, of the helpless child of Want, of the many who may be snatched from the paths of Vice &amp; infamy under their guidance, &amp; be trained up in the habits of Virtue &amp; religion to be happy and useful—of Society which will be spared the burthen of the indigent &amp; the depredations of Vice—of their Country itself, which cannot but acquire honour in fostering &amp; protecting such benificent purposes.   
These considerations, they know Sir, will have weight with you—they anticipate your support, because they are concious they deserve it—and they conclude with their ardent prayers for your personal happiness, &amp; the prosperity of the Country whose affairs you direct, &amp; have the honor to be, with the highest respect,

** Sir—Emboldened by the favorable mention you have been pleased to make of  
their Order, the Nuns of St. Ursula at New Orleans take the liberty of addressing  
you on a subject highly interesting to their situation. They believe that, without  
any direct application, the treaty of cession, and the sense of justice which marks  
the character of the United States, would have secured to them the property they  
how possess; but, considering it a sacred deposit, they would fail in a duty they  
deem essential, were they to omit requesting, that it may be formally confirmed to  
them ‘and their successors, and that you may be pleased to communicate this re-  
quest to the legislative body, in such a manner as you may deem proper. It is  
dictated by no wish of personal gratification or private aggrandizement; secluded  
from the world, its luxuries and vanities, wealth and the enjoyments it brings,  
would to them have no attraction. Devoted to religious duties, temporal advan-  
tages are not the objects of their pursuit, but bound by a solemn obligation to  
employ their revenue in charitable uses, and their time in the education of youth,  
they cannot but be anxious to know, that the property which is to enable them to  
fulfil these duties, will be secure to them. It is not, therefore, their own cause,  
but of the public, which they plead. It is the cause of the orphan, of the helpless  
child of want, of the many who may be snatched from the paths of vice and  
infamy, under their guidance, and be trained up in the habits of virtue and reli-  
gion, to be happy and useful—of society, which will be spared the burthen of the  
indigent and the depredations of vice—of their country itself, which cannot but  
acquire honor, in fostering and protecting such beneficent purposes.
