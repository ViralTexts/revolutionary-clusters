This great event,turned the attention, of all the Colonies to it, &amp; the Supremacy of Parliament stared all men in the face. If parliament was omnipotent, could enact what Statutes they pleased, &amp; employ Armies &amp; Navies, Governors, Councellors, &amp; Judges to interpret them, &amp; carry them into Execution, of what use could our houses of representatives be?

ame fashionable reading. Hutchinson, whose Ambition, made him as weak as water, had declared publickly in Councel, that he had no Authority over the Kings troops; that the military force had a separate command, &amp; he could do nothing without Dalrymple. Good God! said the public, is this our situation already? Is a military authority, already erected, over the civil Authority, or independent of it. Is a Lieutenant Colonel of a Regiment, Commander in Chief of the Province,? Or even independent upon him. We remember the time when Brigadier, Timothy Ruggles, Commander in Chief of massachusetts troops, was put under the Command of a British Ensign for a whole campaign. Is the whole civil Authority of the province now to be placed under the command of a Lieutenant Colonel of a British regiment? To talk or think of liberty, or Privileges, under a military government, is as idle &amp; absurd as under an Ecclesiastical Government.  
How slightly however, historians, may have passed over this event, the blood of the Martyrs, right, or wrong, proved to be the seeds of the Congregation. Not the Battle of Lexington or Bunkers Hill; not the surrender of Burgoyne, or Cornwallis, were more important Events in American history than the battle of Kingstreet, on the 5th of March 1770.  
The town of Boston instituted an Annual Oration in Commemoration of this Catastrophe, “upon the danger of standing Armies, stationed in populous Cities, in time of Peace,” and among the first Orators, were such names as Hancock, Warren, and Lovell. These Orations were read, I had almost said by every body that Could read, &amp; scarcely ever with dry eyes. They have now been continued for 45 years! Will you read them all? They were not long continued in their original design; but other gentlemen, with other views, had influence enough to obtain a change from “standing armies,” to “feelings which produced the revolution”. Of these 45 Orations, I have read as many as I have seen.  They have been made the Engine of bringing forward to public notice, young gentlemen of promising genius, whose connections &amp; sentiments, were conformably tolerable to the prevailing opinions of the moment. There is Juvenile Ingenuity in all that I have read. There are few men of consequence, among us, who did not commence their career by an Oration on the 5th of March. I have read these Orations with a
