 Committee of the Whole took up Secretary Hamilton’s report on public credit. FitzSimons submitted eight resolutions which served as a framework for the debate. The first declared “that adequate provision ought to be made for fulfilling the engagements of the United States, in respect to their foreign debt.” This passed unanimously. The second resolution called for “the payment of interest on, and the gradual discharge of the domestic debt of the United States.” Scott moved to add the words “as soon as the same is ascertaine

sed hitherto, rather to be a hearer than a speaker on the subject, and should even at this moment have continued in my seat, but that the turn which the business has taken, renders it requisite for me now, if at all, to trouble the committee with my reflections, and the opinion in which they have terminated.  
It has been said, by some gentlemen, that the debt itself does not exist in the extent, and form which is generally supposed. I confess, sir, I differ altogether from the gentleman who takes that ground. Let us consider, first, by whom the debt was contracted, and then let us consider, sir, to whom it is due. The debt was contracted by the United States, who, with respect to that particular transaction, were in a national capacity. The government was nothing more than the agent, or organ, by which the whole body of the people acted: The change in the government which has taken place, has enlarged its national capacity, but it has not varied the national obligation, with respect to the engagements entered into by that transaction: For, in like manner, the present government is nothing more than the organ, or agent, of the public. The obligation which they are under, is precisely the same with that under which the debt was contracted; although the government has been changed, the nation remains the same. There is no change in our political duty, nor in the moral or political obligation. The language I now use, sir, is the language of the constitution itself; it declares, that all debts shall have the same validity against the United States, under the new, as under their old form of government. The obligation remains the same, though I hope experience will prove that the ability has been favorably varied.  
The next question is, to what

t. Original creditors, who have never alienated their securities.  
Second. Original creditors, who have alienated.  
Third. Present holders of alienated securities.  
Fourth. Intermediate holders, through whose hands securities have circulated.  
The only principles that can govern the decision on their respective pretensions, I take to be, 1. Public justice; 2. public faith; 3. public credit; 4. public opinion.  
With respect to the first class, there can be no difficulty. Justice is in their favor, for they have advanced the value which they claim; public faith is in their favor, for the written promise is in their hands; respect for public credit is in their favor, for if claims so sacred are violated, all confidence must be at an end; public opinion is in their favor, for every honest citizen cannot but be their advocate.  
With respect to the last class, the intermediate holders, their pretensions, if they have any, will lead us into a labyrinth, for which it is impossible to find a clue. This will be the less complained of, because this class were perfectly free, both in becoming, and ceasing to be creditors; and because, in general, they must have gained by their speculations.  
The only rival pretensions, then, are those of the original creditors, who have assigned, and of the present holders of the assignments.  
The former may appeal to justice, because the value of the money, the service, or the property advanced by them, has never been really paid to them.  
They may appeal to good faith, because the value stipulated and expected is not satisfied by the steps taken by the government. The certificates put into the hands of the creditors, on closing their settlements with the public, were of less real value than was acknowledged to be due; they may be considered as having been forced, in fact, on the receivers. They cannot, therefore, be fairly adjudged an extinguishment of the debt. They may appeal to the motives for establishing public credit, for which justice and faith form the natural foundation. They may appeal to the precedent furnished by the compensation allowed to the army during the late war, for the depreciation of bills, which nominally discharged the debts. They may appeal to humanity, for the sufferings of the military part of the creditors can never be forgotten, while sympathy is an American virtue. To say nothing of the singular hardship, in so many mouths, of requiring those who have lost four-fifths or seven-eighths of their due, to contribute the remainder in favor of those who have gained in the contrary proportion.  
On the other hand, the holders by assignment, have claims, which I by no means wish to depreciate. They will say, that whatever pretensions others may have against the public, these cannot affect the validity of theirs: That if they gain by the risk taken upon themselves, it is but the just reward of that risk: That as they hold the public promise, they have an undeniable demand on the public faith: That the best foundation of public credit, is that adherence to literal engagements on which it has been erected by the most flourishing nations: That if the new government should swerve from so essential a principle, it will be regarded by all the world as inheriting the infirmities of the old. Such being the interfering claims on the public, one of three things must be done; either pay both, reject wholly one or the other, or make a composition between them on some principle of equity. To pay both, is perhaps beyond the public faculties; and as it would far exceed the value received by the public, it will not be expected by the world, nor even by the creditors themselves; to reject wholly the claims of either, is equally inadmissible; such a sacrifice of those who possess the written engagements, would be fatal to the proposed establishment of public credit; it would moreover punish those who had put their trust in the public promises and resources. To make the other class the sole victims was an idea at which human nature recoiled.  
A composition, then, is the only expedient that remains; let it be a liberal one, in favor of the present holders; let them have the highest price which has prevailed in the market; and let the residue belong to the original sufferers. This will not do perfect justice; but it will do more real justice, and perform more of the public faith, than any other expedient proposed. The present holders, where they have purchased at the lowest price of the securities, will have a profit that cannot reasonably be complained of; where they have purchased at a higher price, the profit will be considerable; and even the few who have purchased at the highest price cannot well be losers, with a well funded interest of 6 per cent. The original sufferers will not be fully idemnified; but they will receive, from their country, a tribute due to their merits, which, if it does not entirely heal their wounds, will assuage the pain of them. I am aware, that many plausible objections will lie against what I have suggested, some of which, I foresee, will be taken some notice of. It will be said, that the plan is impracticable; should this be demonstrated, I am ready to renounce it; but it does not appear to me in that light. I acknowledge that such a scale, as has often been a subject of conversation, is impracticable.  
The discrimination proposed by me, requires nothing more than a knowledge of the present holders, which will be shown by the certificates; and of the original holders, which the office documents will shew. It may be objected, that if the government is to go beyond the literal, into the equitable claims against the United States, it ought to go back to every case where injustice has been done. To this the answer is obvious: The case in question, is not only different from others in point of magnitude and of practicability, but forces itself on the attention of the committee, as necessarily involved in the business before them. It may be objected, that public credit will suffer, especially abroad: I think this danger will be effectually obviated by the honesty and disinterestedness of the government displayed in the measure, by a continuance of the punctual discharge of foreign interest, by the full provision to be made for the whole foreign debt, and the equal punctuality I hope to see in the future payments on the domestic debts. I trust also, that all future loans will be founded on a previous establishment of adequate funds; and that a situation, like the present, will be thereby rendered impossible.  
I cannot but regard the present case as so extraordinary, in many respects, that the ordinary maxims are not strictly applicable to it. The fluctuations of stock in Europe, so often referred to, have no comparison with those in the United States. The former never exceeded 50, 60, or 70 per cent: Can it be said, that because a government thought this evil insufficient to justify an interference, it would view in the same light a fluctuation amounting to seven or 800 per cent?  
I am of opinion, that were Great-Britain, Holland, or any other country, to fund its debts precisely in the same situation as the American debt, some equitable interference of the government would take place. The South-Sea scheme, in which a change, amounting to 1000 per cent. happened in the value of stock, is well known to have produced an interference, and without any injury whatever to the subsequent credit of the nation. It is true, that, in many respects, the case differed from that of the United States; but, in other respects, there is a degree of similitude, which warrants the conjecture. It may be objected, that such a provision as I propose, will exceed the public ability: I do not think the public unable to discharge honorably all its engagements, or that it will be unwilling, if the appropriations shall be satisfactory. I regret, as much as any member, the unavoidable weight and duration of the burdens to be imposed; having never been a proselyte to the doctrine, that public debts are public benefits. I consider them, on the contrary, as evils which ought to be removed as fast as honor and justice will permit, and shall heartily join in the means necessary for that purpose. I conclude with declaring, as my opinion, that if any case were to happen among individuals, bearing an analogy to that of the public, a court of equity would interpose its redress; or that if a tribunal existed on earth, by which nations could be compelled to do right, the United States would be compelled to do something not dissimilar in its principles to what I have contended for

to literal engagements on which it has been e retted by the mo ft  
flourifhing nations : that if the new government ftiould swerve  
from so eflential a principle, it will be regarded by all the world  
as inheriting the infirmities ot the old.—Such being the interfe­  
ring claims on the public, one of three things must be done ; ei­  
ther pay both, rejeCt wholly one or other, or make a compp/ition  
between them on some principle of equity ; To pay both is per­  
haps beyond the public faculties; and as it would far exceed the  
value received by the public, will not be expe&amp;ed by the world,  
rtor even by the creditors themselves. To reject wholly the claims  
of either is equally inadmiflible. Such a fa&lt; rifice ot tnofe who  
possess the written engagements, would be fatal to the proposed  
establishment of public credit. It would moreover punish thole  
who had put their trust in the public promises and resources.  
To make the other class the sole vittims, was an idea at which hu­  
man nature recoiled.  
A composition is the only expedient that remains ; let it be   
liberal one in favor of the present holders; let them have the high­  
price which has prevailed in the market; and let the residue  
belong to the original fufferers. This will not do perfedl justice ;  
but it will do more real justice, and perform more of the public  
faith, than any other expedient proposed. The present holders,  
&quot;where they have purchased at the lowest prise of the securities,  
•will have a profit that cannot reasonably be complained of ; where  
they have purchased at a higher price,the profit will be considera­  
ble ; and even the few who have purchased at the highest price,  
cannot well belofersw&#x27;th a well funded interest of fix percent.  
The original fufferers will not be fully indemnified ; but they will  
receive from their country a tribute due to their merits, if  
it does not intirely heal their wounds, will afiuage the pain of  
them. He was aware, that many plausible objections would lie  
against what he fuggeftcd ; some, which he forefaw, he would  
takefome notice of. It would be laid, that the plan was imprac­  
ticable : should this be demonstrated he was ready to renounce it;  
but it did not appear to him in that light. He acknowledged  
that such a scale as had often been a fubjett of convcrfation, was  
impracticable—  
  
The discrimination proposed by him, required nothing more  
than a knowledge of the present holders, which would be shewn  
by the certificates ; and of theoriginal holder?, which the office  
documents would shew. It may be objected, that if the govern­  
ment is to go beyond the literal into the equitable claims against  
the United States, it ought to go back to every cafe where injuflice  
had been done. To this the answer was obvious : The cafe in  
&lt;Jueflion is not only different from others in point of magnitude  
and of practicability, but forces itfelf on the attention of the com­  
mittee a? necefTarily involved in the business before them. It may  
be objected, that public credit will fuffer, especially abroad: He  
thought this danger would be effe&amp;ually obviated by the honefly  
and disinterestedness of the governnynt displayed in the measure,  
bv a continuance of the pundual discharge of foreign intercft, by  
the full provision to be made for the whole foreign debt, and the  
equal pun&amp;uality he hoped to fee in the future payments on the  
oomeftic debts. Hetrufted also, that all future loans would be  
founded on a previous establishment of adequate funds ; and that  
« situation like the present would be thereby rendered impossible.  
He could not but regard the present cafe as so extraordinary,  
m many refpc&amp;s, that the ordinary maxims were not ftriftly ap­  
plicable to it. The flufryations of stock in Europe, so often le­  
lerred to. bore no cdmparifon with those in the United States.  
The former never exceeded ,50, 60, or 70 per cent : can it be said,  
that because a government thought this evil infutficient to juflifv  
an interference, it would view in the fame light a fluctuation  
amounting to 7 or 800 per c?nt. ?  
  
He was of opinion, that were Great Britain, Holland, or any  
other country, to fund its debt precisely in the situation of the  
American debt, some equitable interference of the government  
■would take place. The South Sea scheme, in which a change a­  
mountingto 1000 per cent. happened in the value of flock, is  
&quot;well known to have produced an interference, and without any in­  
jury whatever to the subsequent credit of the nation. It was  
true that, in many refpefts, the cafe differed from that of the  
United States ; but, in other refpe&amp;s there was a degree of fimi-  
Jitude which warranted the conjecture. It may be objected, that  
such a provision as he proposed would exceed the public ability :  
He did not tinnk the public unable to discharge honorably all its  
engagemenr.% or that it would be unwilling, if the appropriations  
should be fatisfa&amp;ory. He regretted, as much as any member,  
the unavoidable weightand duration of the burdens to be imposed ;  
having never been a proselyte to the doctrine that public debts  
are public benefits. He confiderea them, on the contrary, as  
evils which ought to be removed as fail as honor and iuftice would  
permit, and should heartily join in the means neceflary for that  
purpose. He concluded with delating his opinion, that if any  
cafe were ro happen among individuals, bearing an analogy to that  
of the public, a court of equity would interpose for its rcdrefs ; or  
that if a tribunal existed on earth, by which nations could be  
compelled to do right.the United States would be compelled to do  
something not difiimilar in its principles to what he contended for.

The difcrimination propofed by him, requir­

He could not but regard the prefent cafe as

not {atisfied by the fteps taken by the government, The certificates put ia the  
hands of the creditors, on clofing their fettlements with the public, were of  
lefs real value ‘han was acknowledged to be due; they may be contlidered as  
having been forced, in fact, on the receivers. They cannot, therefore, be fairly  
adiudgei an extinguithment ot the debt. They may appeal to the mo ives for  
eftabiithing public credit, for which juitice and public faith form the natural foun-  
dation. They may appeal to the precedent furnifhed by the compeafation allowed  
tothe army during the war, for the depreciation of bills which nominally dif-  
charge the debts. They may appeal to humanity ; for the (ufferings of the mili-  
tary part of the creditors can never be forgotten, while fympathy is an Americas  
virtue. To fay nothing of the fingular hardfhip, fo often mentioned, of requiring  
thoie who have loit tour-fitths, or feven-eighths of their due, to contribute the  
remainder in favour ot thofe who have gained in the contrary proportion,  
  
On the other hand, the holders by aflignment have claims which I by no means  
with to depreciate. They will fay, that whatever pretenfions others may have a-  
gaint the public, thefe cannot affeét the validity of theirs ; that, if they gain by  
the rifk taken upon themfelves, it is but the juft reward of that rifk ; that, as they  
hold the public promife, they have an undeniable demand on the public iaith ; that  
the beft foundation of public credit is, that adherence to literal engagements, on  
which it has been erected by the moft flourifhing nations ; that if the new govern-  
ment {werve from {fo effential a principle, it will be regarded by ail the world, as  
inheriting the infirmities of the old. Such being the interfering claims on the pub-  
lic, one of three things muft be done : either pay both ; reje¢t wholly one or other ;  
or make a compofition between them on fome principle of equity. To pay both,  
is perhaps beyond the public faculties: and as it would far exceed the value re-  
eeived by the public, will not be expected by the world, nor even by the creditors  
themfelves. To rejeét wholly theclaims of either, is equally inadmiffible. Such a  
facrifice of thofe who poffefs the written engagements, would be fatal to the pro-  
poled eftablifhment of public credit. It would, moreover, punith thofe who have  
put their truft in the public promifes and refources. To make the other clafs the  
fole victims, is an idea at which human nature recoils.  
  
A compofition is the only expedient that remains. Let it be a Liberal one in fa-  
vour of the prefent holders. Let them have the higheft price which has prevailed  
in the market : and let the refidue belong to the original fuiterers. This will not  
do pertect juftice : but it will do more real juftice, and perform more of the pub-~  
lic faith, than any other expedient propofed. The prefent holders, where they  
have purchaied at the loweft price of the fecurities, will have a profit which can  
not be complained of. Where they have purchafed at a higher price, the profit  
will be confiderable : and even the few, who have purchafed at the higheft price,  
cannot well be lofers with a well-funded intereft of fix per cent. The original  
fufferers will not be fully indemnified : but they will receive from their country  
a tribute due to their merits; which, if it do not entirely heal their wounds, wil]  
affuage the pain of them.  
  
Mr. Madifon then obferved he was aware, that many plaufible objetiens would  
lie againit what he fuggetted : fome, which he toretaw, he would take fome no-  
tice of. It would be faid, that the plan was impracticable. “Should this be de-  
monitrated, he was ready torenounce it: but it did not appear to him in that  
light. He acknowledged that fucha fcale, as had often been a fubjeét of conver -  
fation, was impracticable.  
  
The difcrimination, propofed by him, required nothing more than a knowledze  
ef the prefent holders, which would be fhewn by the certificates—and of the or-

the anfwer was obvious. The eafe in queftion was not only different from others,  
in point of magnitude and of praéticability, but forced itielf on the attention of  
the committee, as neceffarily involved in the bufine(s before them. It might be  
objected, that the public credit would fuffer, efpecially abroad. He thought this  
danger would be etfeétually obviated by the honefty and difintereftednefs of the  
governinent dipiayed in the mealure—by a continuance of the pun&amp;tual difcharge  
of foreign interett—by the full provition to be made for the whole foreign debt,  
and the equal punétuality he hoped to fee inthe tuture payments on the domettic  
debts. He trufted alfo, that all future loams would be founded ona previous efta-  
blifhment of adequate funds : and that a fituation like the prefent, would be theres  
by rendered impollible.  
  
He could not but regard the prefent cafe as fo extraordinary, in many refpeéts,  
that the ordinary maxims were not ftriétly applicable to it. The fluctuations of  
ftock in Europe, fo often referred to, bore no comparifon to thofe in the united  
ftates. ‘he former never exceeded fifty, fixty, or feventy per cent. Could it be  
faid, that becaufe a government thought this evil infufficient to juitify an interfe-  
rence, it would view in the fame light a fluétuation amounting to feven or eight  
hundred per cent. ?  
  
He was of opinion, that were Great Britain, Holland, or any other country,  
to fund its debts, precitely in the fituation of the American debt, fome equitable  
interference of the government would take place. The South Sea {cheme, in which  
achange, amounting to one thoufand per cent. happened in the value of ftock,  
was well known to have produced an interference, and without any injury whatever  
to the fubfequent credit of the nation. It was true that, in many refpects, the  
cafe differed from that of the united ftates ; but, in other refpects, there was a  
degree of fimilitude which warranted the conjecture. It might be objected, that  
fuch a provifion as he propofed, would exceed the public ability. He did not  
think the public unable to difcharge honourably all its engagements, or that it  
would be unwilling, if the appropriations were fatisfattory. He regretted, as  
much as any member, the unavoidable weight and duration of the burdens to be  
impofed, having never been a profelyte to the doétrine, that public debts are pub-  
lic beuefits. He confidered them on the contrary, as evils, which ought to be re-  
moved as fait as honour and juftice would permit, and fhould heartily join in  
the means neceffary for that purpofe. He concluded with declaring his opinion,  
that ic any cafe were to happen among individuals, bearing an analogy to that  
of the public, a court of equity would interpofe its redre{s ; or that if a tribunal  
exifted on earth, by which nations could be compelled to do right, the united  
ftutes would be compelled to do fomething not diffimilar in its principles to what  
he contended for. Adiourned

to another point, favs, &quot; Let us consider firll by whom the debt  
was contracted, and then to whom it is due. The debt was con­  
tracted by the United States, who with refpeft to that particular  
tranfa&amp;ion were in a national capacity. The government was no­  
thing more than the agent or organ by which the whole body of  
the people attcd. The charigeiri the government which has taken  
place, has enlarged its national capacity, but it has not varied the  
national obligation with refpeft to the engagements entered into  
by that transition—for in like manner the present government is  
noshing more than ihe organ or agent of the public. There is
