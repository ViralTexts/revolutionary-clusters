Dear Sir,  
Camp at Cambridge Augt 29th 1775  
  
Your favour of the first Inst. by Mr Randolph came safe to hand—the merits of this young Gentleman, added to your recommendation, &amp; my own knowledge of his character, induced me to take him into my Family as an Aid de Camp in ⟨the room of⟩ Mr Mifflin who I have appointed Quarter Master Genel from a thorough perswation of his Integrety—my own experience of his activity—and finaly, because he stands unconnected with either of these Governments; or with this, that, or t’other Man; for between you and I, there is more in this than you can easily immagine.  
As we have now nearly compleated our Lines of Defence, we have nothing more, in ⟨my o⟩pinion, to fear from the Enemy provided we can keep our men to their duty and ma⟨ke⟩ them watchful &amp; vigilant; but it is among the most difficult tasks I ever undertook in my life to induce these people to believe that there is, or can be, danger till the Bayonet is pushed at their Breasts; not that it proceeds from any uncommon prowess, but rather from an unaccountable kind of stupidity in the lower class of these people, which believe me prevails but too generally among the Officers of the Massachusets part of the Army, who are ne⟨ar⟩ly of the same Kidney with the Privates; and adds not a little to my difficulties; as there is no such thing as getting Officers of this stamp to exert themselves in carrying orders into execution—to curry favour with the men (by whom they were chosen, &amp; on whose Smiles possibly they may think they may again rely) seems to be one of the principal objects of their attention.  
I submit it therefore to your consideration whether there is, or is not, a propriety in that Resolution of the Congress, which leaves the ultimate appointment of all Offices below the Rank of Generals to the Governments wher⟨e⟩ the Regiments originated, now the Army is become Continental? To me it appears imp⟨ro⟩per in two points of view; first, it is giving that power and weight to an Individual Colony, which ought, of right, to belong ⟨only⟩ to the whole, and next it damps the spirit &amp; ardour of Volunteers fro⟨m⟩ all but the four new England Governments as none but their people have the least chan⟨ce⟩ of  
  
getting into Office—Would it not be better therefore to have the Warrants which the Commander in Chief is authorizd to give Pro tempore, approved or disapproved, by the Continental Congress, or a Committee of their body, which I should suppose in any l⟨ong⟩ recess must always Sit? In this ca⟨se every⟩ Gentleman will stand an equal chance of being promoted, according to his merit; in the other, all offices will be confined to the Inhabitants of the 4 New England Governmts which in my opinion is impolitick to a deg⟨ree.⟩  
I have made a pretty good Slam among such kind of officers as the Massachusets Government ⟨a⟩bound in since I came to this Camp, having Broke one Colo. and two Captains for Cowardly beh⟨aviour in⟩ the action on Bunker’s Hill—Two captains for drawing more provisions and pay than they had men in their Company—and one for being absent from his Post when the Enemy appeared there, and burnt a House just by it. Besides these, I have at this time one Colo., one Major, one Captn, &amp; two Subalterns under arrest for tryal—In short I spare none &amp; yet fear it will not all do, as these Peeple seem to be too inattentive to every thing but their Interest.  
I have not been unmindful of that part of your Letter respecting point Alderton—before the receipt of it, it had become an object of my particular enquiry, but the Accts of its situation differ exceedingly in respect to the command it has of the Ship Chan⟨nel⟩ but my k⟨no⟩wledge of this matter would not have been confined to enquiries only if I had ever been in a condition, since my arrival here, to have taken possession of such a Post; but you well know my good Sir; that it becomes the duty of an Officer to consider some other matters, as well as a Situation. namely, what number of men are necessary to defend a place—how it can be supported—&amp; how furnished with Ammuniton.  
In respect to the first I conceive our defence of this place (point Alderton) m⟨ust⟩ be proportioned to the Attack of Genl Gage’s whole force, leaving him just enough to man his Lines on Boston &amp; Charles Town Necks—&amp; with regard to the Second, and mos⟨t⟩ important, as well as alarming object, we have only 184. Barls of Powder in all (including the late supply from Philadelphia) wch is not sufficient to give 25. Musket Cartridges to each man, and scarcely to serve the Artillery in any brisk Action  
  
one single d⟨ay⟩—under these Circumstances I daresay you will agree with me, that it would not be ver⟨y⟩ eligable to take a post 30 Miles distant (by Land) from this place, when we have already a line of Circumvalation round Boston of at leas⟨t⟩ 10 Miles in extant to defend any part of which ma⟨y⟩ be attacked without our having (if the Enemy will keep their own Council) an hours previous notice of it; and that, it would not be prudent in me, to attempt a measure which would necessarily bring on a consumption of all the Ammunition we have, thereby leaving the Army at the Mercy of the Enemy, or to disperse; and the Country to be ravaged and lai⟨d⟩ waste at discretion—to you Sir I may acct for my conduct, but I cannot declare the motives of it to every one, notwithstanding I know by not doing of it, that I shall stand in a very unfavourable light in the opinion of those who expect much, &amp; will find little done, without understanding, or perhaps giving themselves the trouble of enquiring into the caus⟨e⟩—such however is the fate of all those who are obliged to act the part I do, I must therefore submit to it, under a consciousness of having done my duty to the best of my Abilitie⟨s.⟩  
On Saturday night last we took ⟨possession⟩ of a Hill advanced of our own Lines &amp; within point blank shot of the Enemy on Charles Town Neck—we worked incessantl⟨y⟩ the whole Night with 1200 Men, &amp; before Mor⟨n⟩ing got an Intrenchment in such forwardness as to bid defiance to their Cannon; abou⟨t⟩ nine Oclock on Sunday they began a heavy Cannonade which continued through the day without any injury to our work, and with the loss of four Men only, two of which were killed through their ⟨own fo⟩lly—The Insult of the Cannonade however we were obliged to submit to with impunity, not daring to make use of Artillery on Acct of the consumption of powder, except with one Nine pounder placed on a point, with which we silenced, &amp; indeed sunk, one of their Floating Ba⟨t⟩teries.  
This move of ours, was made to prevent the Enemy from gaining this Hill, and we thought was giving them a fair Challeng⟨e⟩ to dispute it (as we had been told by various people who had just left Boston, that they were preparing to come out) but instead of accepting of it, we learn that it has thrown them into great consternation which mig⟨ht⟩ be improved ⟨if we had⟩ the  
  
means of doing it—Yesterday afternoon they began a Bombardment without any effect, as yet.  
There has been so many great, and capital errors, &amp; abuses to rectify—so many examples to make—&amp; so little Inclination in the Officers of inferior Rank to contribute their aid to accomplish this work, that my life has been nothing else (since I ⟨came here) b⟩ut one continued round of a⟨nnoyance⟩ &amp; f⟨at⟩igue; in short no pecuniary r⟨ecompense⟩ could induce me to undergo what I ha⟨ve espe⟩cially as I expect, by shewing so little Co⟨unte⟩nance to irregularities &amp; publick abus⟨es to⟩ render myself very obnoxious to a gre⟨ater⟩ part of these People. But as I have alrea⟨dy⟩ greatly exceeded the bounds of a Letter I will not trouble you with matters relative to my own feelings.  
As I expect this Letter will meet you in Philadelphia I must request the favour of you to present my Affecte &amp; respectful Compliments to Doctr Shippen, his lady, and Family, my Brothers of the Deligation, and any other enquiring friends—&amp; at the same time do me the justice to believe that I am with a sincere regard Yr Affecte friend &amp; Obedt Servt

CANe AT CANBRIDGE, Aug. 29h, 1775.  
Dear Sir. Your favor of the first inst., by  
Mr. RAndoipr, came safe to hand--the merits  
of this young gentleman, added to your re­  
commendation and my own knowledge of his  
character, induced me to take him into my  
family as an Aid-de-Camp, in the room of  
Major Mieelin, who I have appointed Quarter-  
master Gsneral, from a thorough persuasion  
of his integrity, my own experience of his ac-  
tivity, and finally, because he stands uncon­  
nected with elther of these Governments; or  
with this, that, or &#x27;tother man; for, between  
you and I, there is more in this than you can  
easily imagine.  
As we have new cearly completed our lines  
of defence, we have nothing more, in my opin­  
ion, to fear from the enemy, provided we can  
keep our men to their duty, and make them  
watchful and vigilant; but it is among the  
most difficult tasks I ever u adertook in my  
life to induce these people to believe that  
there is or can be danger, till the bayonet is  
pushed at their breasts; not that it proceeds  
from any uncommon prowess, but rather from  
an unaccountable kind of stupidity in the  
lower class of these people, which, believe  
me, prevails but too generally among tise  
officers of the Massachusetts part of the army,  
who are nearly of the same itidney with the  
privates, and adds not a litsle to my dif­  
ficulties, as there is no auch thing as get­  
ting officers of this stamp to exert them­  
selves in carrying orders into execution.  
To curry favor with the men tby whom  
they were chosen, and on whose smtles possi­  
bly they may think they may again rely,)  
seems to be one of the principal objects of their  
attention. I submit it, therefote, to your con­  
sideration, whether there is, or is not, a pro­  
priety in that resolution of the CCongress which  
leaves the ultimate appointme at of all officers  
beloww the rank of General to the Govern­  
ments where the regiments originated, now  
the army is become Continent al? To me, it  
appears improper in two points of view--first,  
it is giving that power and weight to an  
individual Colony which oright of right  
to belong to the whole. Then, it dampe the  
spirit and ardor of volunteerss from all but  
the four New England Govern rents, as none  
but their people have the least schance of get­  
ting into office. Would it notb a better, there­  
fore, to have the warrants which the Com­  
mander-in Chief is authorioed to give pro  
tempore, approved or disappr oved by the Con-  
tinental Congress, or a co mmittee of their   
body, which I should suppe se in any long re­  
cess must always set? In this case, every  
gentleman will stand an eqnal chance of be­  
ing promoted, according to his merit; in the  
other, all offices will be confbied to the in­  
habitants of the four Nerw Enland Govern­  
ments, which, in my opin ion, isd impolitic to a  
degree. I have mado a prenity good slam  
among such kind of offiters as the Massachu­  
setts Government abou ads in ince I came to  
this camp, having brosken one Colonel and  
two Captains for cowardly behw vior in the ac­  
tion on Bunker&#x27;s Hill, two Capt ains for draw­  
ing more provisions and pay than they had  
men in their comparly, and om for being ab­  
sent from his post wthen the en emy appeared  
there and hurnt a house just by it. Besides  
these, I have at ths time ont Colonel, one  
Major, one Captain, and two sulalterns ander  
arrest for trial. Im short, I syare none, and  
yet fear it will not all do, as the se people seem  
to be too inattentive to everyth ing but their  
interest.  
I have not been anmindful of that part of  
  
your letter respacting Point Al iderton. Be­  
fore the receipt of it, it had b scome an oh­  
ject of my particular inquiry; bur t the accounts  
of its situation differ exceeding ily in respect  
to the command it has of the a hip channel.  
But my knowledge of this matt ar would not  
have been confined to inquiriesonly if I had  
ever been in a condition, since my arrival here,  
to have taken possession of such a post; but  
you well knowr, my good sir, that it becomes  
the duty of an officer to consideg some other  
matters as well as situation, nan tely: what  
number of men are necessary 3o defend a  
place; how it can be supported, alad how fur­  
nished with ammunitioa.  
In respect to the first, I coneseitre our de­  
fence of this place, (Point Alderton ) must be  
proportioned to the attack of Ga a. Gaon&#x27;s  
whole force, leaving him just onoug h to man  
his lines on Boston and Charlestow N Necks.  
And with regard to the second and i aoat im­  
portant, as well as alarming object,we have  
only 154 barrels of power in all, Ga cluding  
the late supply from Philadedphia,) w hich is  
not augicient to give 25 musket cartri dges to  
each man, and scarcely to sorve the as thilery  
in any brisk action one single day. Under  
these cfronmstances, I dare say you welll agres  
with me that it would not be very eligt ble to  
take a post 30 miles distant, cy land, from  
this place, whon we have alsay a line of  
communication round Boton of at feast 10  
miles in extent to dafend any part oof which  
may be attacked without our having tif the  
enemy will koop their own oemnsel,)an hour&#x27;s  
previous notice of it, and that it woald not  
  
be prudent in me to sttempt a measure which  
would necessarily bring on a consumptionI  
of all the ammunition ws have, theree  
by leaving the army at the mercy of the  
enemy, or to disperse and the country to be   
ravaged and laid waste at discretion  
To you, sir, I may account for my conduct;  
but I cannot declare the motives of it to every  
one, notwithstanding I know, by not doing it,  
that I shall stand in a very unfavorable light  
in the opinion of those who expect much, and  
will find little done, without understanding  
or perhaps giving themselves the trouble of  
inquiring in to the cause. Such, however, is  
the fate of all those who are obliged to act the  
part I do. I must, tharefore, submit to it,  
under a conscionsuess of having done my  
duty to the best of my abilities.  
On Saturday night last, we took possession  
of a hill advanced of our own lines, and   
in point blank shot of the enemy on Charies­  
town Neck. We worked incessantly the whole  
night with 1,200 men, and before morning got  
an entrenchment in such forwardness as to  
bid daflance to their cannon. About 90&#x27;clok  
on Sunday they begen a heavy cannonade,  
which continued through the day without I  
any injury to our work, and with the loss of  
four men only, two of which were killed  
through their own folly. The insult of the  
cannonade, ho wever, we were obliged to aubmit  
to with impunity, not daring to make use of I  
artiilery, on account of the consumption of  
powder, except with oue nine-pounder, p&#x27;aced  
on a point, with which we silenced, and in-  
sunk, one of their foating batteries.  
This move of ours was made to prevent the  
enemy from gaining this hilf, and we   
was giving them a fair challenge to dispute  
it, (as we had been told by various people,  
who had just left Boston, that they were  
preparing to come out;) but, instead of ac-  
cepting of it, we learn that it has thrown them  
into great consternation, which might be im­  
proved had we the means of doing it. Yes­  
terday afternoon they began a bombardment,  
without any effect as yet.  
There have been so many great and capital  
errors and abuses to rectle--so many aram­  
ples to make, and so little inclination in the  
officers of inferior rank to contribute their aid  
to accomplish this work, that my life has  
been nothing else (since I came here,) but one  
continualround of vexation and fatigne. In  
short, no pecuniary recompense could induce   
me to undergo what I have; especially, as I  
expect, by showing so little countonance to  
irregularities and public abuses as to render  
myself very obnoxious to a great part of these  
people. But as I have already greatly ex­  
ceeded the bounds of a letter, I will not  
trouble you with matters relative to my own  
feelings.  
As I expect this letter will meet you in  
Philadelphia, I must requsst the favor of  
you to presont my affectionale and respectul  
compliments to Dr. Shieeer, his lady and  
family, my brothers of the Dsiegation, and  
any other enquiring friend;- and at the same  
time, do me the justice to helieve that I o,  
with a sincere regard,  
Your affect&#x27;ate friend and ob&#x27;t servet,

CAMe AT CAMerIdGe, Ang. 29th, 1775  
Dear Sir Your favor of the first inst., by  
Mr. Randolph, came safe to hand--the mer­  
its of this young gentleman, added to your  
recommendation and my own knowledge of  
his character, induced me to take him into  
my family as an Aid-de-Camp, in the room  
of Major Mifflin, who I have appointed Quar­  
termaster General, from a thorough persua­  
sion of his integrity, my own experience of  
his activity, and finally, because he stands  
unconnected with either of these Govern­  
ments; or with this, that, or &#x27;tother man; for,  
between you and 1, there is more in this  
than you can easily imagine.  
As we have now nearly completed our  
lines of defence, we have nothing more, in my  
opinion, to fear from the enemy, provided we  
can keep our men to their duty, and make  
them watchful and vigilant; but it is among  
the most difficult task I ever undertook in  
my life to induce these people to believe that  
there is or can be danger, till the bayonet is  
pushed at their breasts; not that it proceeds  
from any uncommon prowess, but rather from  
an unaccountable kind of stupidity in the  
lower class of these people, which, believe  
me, prevails but too generally among the  
officers of the Massachusetts part of the ar­  
my, who are nearly of the same kidney with  
the privates, and adds not a little to my dif  
ficulties, as there is no such thing as getting  
officers of this stamp to exert themselves in  
carrying orders into execution. To curry  
favor with the men, (by whom they were  
chosen, and on whose smiles possibly they  
may think they may again rely,) seems to be  
one of the principal objects of their attention.  
I submit it, therefore, to your consideration,  
whether there is, or is not, a propriety in  
that resolution of the Congress which leaves  
the ultimate appointment of all officers below  
the rank of General to the Governments  
where the regiments originated, now the ar  
my is become Continentalf To me, it ap­  
pears improper in two points of view--first,  
it is giving that power, and weight to an in  
dividual Colony which ought of right to be  
long to the whole. Then it damps the spirit  
and ardor of volunteers from all but the four  
New England Governments, as none but their  
people have the least chance of getting into  
office. Would it not be better, therefore, to  
have the warrants which the Commander-in-  
Chief is authorized to give pro fempore, ap  
proved or disapproved by the Continental  
Congress, or a committee of their body,  
which I should suppose in any long recess  
must always set? In this case, every gentle­  
man will stand an equal chance of being pro  
moted, according to his merit, in the other,  
all offices will be confined to the inhabitants  
f the four New England Governments,  
which, in my opinion, is impolitic to a de­  
gree. I have made a pretty good slam among  
such kind of officers as the Massachusetts  
Government abounds in since I came to this  
camp, having broken one Colonel and two  
Captains for cowardly behavior in action on  
Bunker&#x27;sHill, two Gaptains for drawing  
more provisions and pay than they had men  
in their company, and one for being absent  
from his post when the enemy appeared there  
and burnt a house just by it. Besides these,  
I have at this time one Colonel, one Major,  
one Captain and two subalterns under arrest  
for trial. In short, I spare none, and yet  
fear it will not all do, as these people seem  
to be too inattentive to everything but their  
interest   ee e ao  
I have not been unmindful of that part of  
your letter respecting Point Alderton. Be  
fore the receipt of it, it had become an onee  
of my particular inquiry; but the accounts of  
its situation differ exceedingly in respect to  
the command it has of the ship channel. But  
my knowledge of this matter would not have  
been confinad to inquiries only if I had ever  
been in a condition, since my arrival here, to  
have taken possession of such a post; but  
you well know, my good sir, that it becomes  
the duty of an officer to consider some other  
matters as well as situation, namely: what  
number of men are necessary to defend a  
place; how it can be supported, and how  
furnished with ammunition.  
In respect to the first, I conceive our de­  
fence of this place, (Point Alderton,) must be  
proportioned to the attack of Genr Gage&#x27;s  
whole force, leaving him just enough to man  
his lines to Boston and Charlestown Necks.  
And with regard to the second and most im­  
portant, as well as alarming object, we have  
only 185 barrels of powder in all, (ineluding  
the late supply from Philadelphia, which is  
not sufficient to give 25 musket cartridges to  
each man, and scarcely to serve the ariillery  
in any brisk action one single day. Under  
these circumstances, I dare say you will  
agree with me that it would not be very eli­  
gible to take a post 30 miles distant, tby  
land,) from this place, when we have already  
a line of communication round Boston of at  
least 10 miles in extent to defend it, any part  
of which may be attacked without having  
(if the enemy will keep their own counsel,)  
an hour&#x27;s previous notice of it, and that it  
would not be prudent in me to attempt a  
measure which would necessarily bring on a  
consumption of all the ammunition we have,  
thereby leaving the army at the mercy of  
the enemy, or to disperse and the country to  
se ravaged and laid waste at discretion. To  
you, I sir, may account for my conduct; but  
I cannot declare the motives of it to every  
one, notwithstanding I know, by not doing  
it, that I shall stand in a very unfavorable  
light in the opinion of those who expect  
much, and will find little done, without un­  
derstanding, or perhaps giving themselves  
the trouble of inquiring into the cause.  
Such, however, is the fate of all those who  
are obliged to act the part I do. I must,  
therefore, submit to it, under a consciousness  
of having done my duty to the best of my  
abilities.  
On Saturday night last, we took possession  
of a hill advanced of our own lines, and  
within point blank shot of the enemy on  
Charlestown Neck. We worked incessantly  
the whole night with 1,200 men, and before  
morning got an entrenchment in such for­  
wardness as to bid defiance to their cannon.  
About 9 o&#x27;clock on Sunday they began a  
heavy cannonade which continued through  
the day without any injury to our work, and  
with the loss of four men only, two of which  
were killed through their own folly. The  
insult of the cannonade, however, we were  
obliged to submit to with impunity, not dar­  
ing to make use of artillery, on account of  
the consumption of powder, except with one  
nine pounder, placed on a point, with which  
we silenced, and indeed, sunk, one of their  
floating batteries. This move of ours was  
made to prevent the enemy from gaining this  
hill, and we thought was giving them a fair  
thallenge to dispute it, (as we had been told  
by various people, who just left Boston, that  
say were preparing to come out;) but in-  
of accepting it, we learn that it has  
thrown them inte great consternation, which  
might be improved had we the means of do  
ing it. Yesterday afternoon they began  
bombardment, without any effect as yet.  
There have been so many great and capital  
errors and abuses to rectify---so many ex­  
amples to make, and so little inclination in  
the officers, of inferior rank to contribnte  
their ald to accomplish this work, that my  
life has been nothing else (since I came here,)  
  
  
tigue. In short, no pecuniary recompense  
could induce me to undergo what I have;  
especially, as I expect, by showing so little  
countenance to irregularities and public  
abuses as to render myself very obnoxious  
to a great part of these people. But as I  
have already greatly exceeded the bounds of  
a letter, I will not trouble you with matters  
relative to my own feelings.  
As I expect this letter will meet you in  
Philadelphia, I must request the favor of you  
to present my affectionate and respectful  
compliments to Dr. Shippen, his lady and  
family, my brothers of the Delegation, and  
any other equiring friends,-and at the same  
time, do me the justice to believe that I am  
with a sincere regard,  
Your affectionate friend,  
and obedient servant,  
GEO. WASHINGTON

favorable light in the opinion of those who ex­  
pect much, and will find little done, without  
understanding, or perhaps giving themselves  
the trouble ol&#x27;inquiring into the cause. Such,  
I however, is the late of all those who are obliged  
! to act the parti do. 1 must, therefore, submit  
to it, under a consciousness of having done my  
duty to the best of my abilities.  
On Saturday night last, we took possession  
of a bill in advance of ourown lines, and within  
point blank shot of the enemy on Charlestown  
Neck. We worked incessantly the whole night  
with 1,200 men, and before morning got an en­  
trenchment in such forwardness as to bid deli­  
ance to their cannon. About !) o&#x27;clock on  
Sunday t he v.began a heavy cannonade, which  
continued through the day without any injury  
to our work, and with the loss ot four men only,  
two of which were killed through their own  
follv. The insult of the cannonade, however,  
we were obliged to submit tom &#x27;■ impunity, not  
daring to make use of artillery account of  
the consumption of powder, « &#x27; ith one  
nine-pounder, placed on a point, with which  
we silenced, and indeed, sir; their float­  
ing batteries. This move ol made to  
prevent the enemy from gain &gt; hill, and  
we thought was giving them a nu hallenge to  
dispute it.(as we had been told by various peo­  
ple, who had left Boston, that they were prepa­  
ring to come out;) but, instead of accepting it,  
we learn that it has thrown them into great  
consternation, which might lie improved had  
we the means of doing it. Yesterday afternoon  
they began a bombardment, without any effect  
as yet.  
  
i here have been so many great ana capital  
errors and abuses to rectify—so many exam­  
ples to make, and so little inclination in the  
officers of inferior rank to contribute their aid  
to accomplish this work, that my life has been  
else (since 1 came here,)but one continual  
round of vexation and fatigue. In short, no  
pecuniary recompense could induce me to un­  
dergo what I have; especially, as I expect, by  
showing so little countenance to irregularities  
and public abuses as to render myself very ob­  
noxious to a great part of these people. But  
as I have already greatly exceeded the bounds  
of a letter, I will not trouble you with matters  
relative to my own feelings.  
As I expect this letter will meet you in Phil­  
adelphia, I must request the favor of you to  
present iny affectionate and respectful compli­  
ments to I &gt;r. Shippen, his lady and family, my  
brothers of the delegation, and any other enqui­  
ring friends—and at the same time, do me the  
justice to believe that I am, with a sincere re­  
gard, _ . , , .  
Your affect&#x27;ate friend and ob t. ser vf,

&quot;DEAR SIR: * * * * As we  
have now nearly completed our lines  
of defence, we have nothing more, in  
my opinion, to fear from the enemy,  
provided we can keep our men to  
their duty, and make them watchfid  
and vigilant; but it is among the most  
difficult tasks I ever undertook in my  
life to induce these people to believe  
that there is or can be danger till the  
bayonet is pushed at their breasts;  
not that it proceeds from any uncom?  
mon prowess, but rather from an un­  
J accountable kind of stupidity in the  
lower class of these people, which,  
I believe me, prevails too generally  
among the officers of the Massachu?  
setts part of thc army, who are  
nearly all of Jthe same kidney with the  
privates, and adds not a little to my  
difficulties, as there is no such thing  
as getting officers of this stamp tc  
exert themselves in carrying orders  
iuto execution. To curry favor wit!  
the men (by whom they were chosen,  
and whose smiles possibly they maj  
think they may again rely) seems tr  
be one of the principal objects o:  
their attention. I submit it, there  
fore, to your consideration, whethei  
there is, or is not, a propriety in tba  
resolution of the Congress whicl  
leaves the ultimate appointment o  
all officers below the rank of Gene  
ral to the Governments where th&lt;  
regiments originated, now the arrm  
is become Continental? To me, i  
appears improper in two points o  
view. First, it is giving that powe  
and weight to an individual Colony  
which ought of right to belong to tb  
whole. Then it damps the spirit am  
ardor of volunteers from all but th  
1 four New England Governments, a  
none but their people have the leas  
chance of getting iuto office. WouL  
it not be better, therefore, to hav  
the warants, which the Commander  
in-Chief is authorized to give, pr,  
tempore, approved, or disapproved b;  
the Continental Congress, or a cona  
mittee of their body, which I ghoul  
suppose in any long recess mus  
always sit? In this case every gentle  
man will stand an equal chance o  
being promoted, according to hi  
merit; in tho other all offices will b  
confined to the inhabitants of th  
four New England Governments  
which in my opinion is impolitic to  
degree. I have made a pretty goo?  
show among such kind of officer  
as the Massachusetts Governmer  
abounds in, since I came to this camj  
having broken one Colonel and tw  
Captains for cowardly behavior in th  
action on Bunker&#x27;s Hill; twoCaptair  
for drawing more provisions and pa  
than they had men in their company  
and one for being absent from h:  
post when the enemy appeared thei  
and burnt the house just by it. B&lt;  
sides these, I have at this time on  
Colonel, one Major, one Captain an  
two subalterns under arrest for tria  
j In short, I spare none, and yet I fe?  
I it will not all do, as these people seei  
j to be too inattentive to evcrythin  
but their interest. * * * * *  
There have been so many great ari  
capital errors and abuses to rectify­  
so many examples to make, and s  
little inclination in the officers &lt;  
inferior rank to contribute the  
aid] to accomplish this work, that n  
life has been nothing else (since  
came here) but one continual rout  
of vexation and fatigue. In shor  
no pecuniary recompense could indu  
me to undergo what I have, especial  
as I expect, by showing so little cou  
teuance to irregularities and pub!  
abuses as to render myself ve:  
obnoxious to a greatj&gt;artof these pe

and make them watchful and vigilant; but it is among the most difficult

cipline of his army, Washington said, “ There is no such thing as get-

with the men by whom they were chosen seems to be one of the  
principal objects of their attention. I have made a pretty good weed-
