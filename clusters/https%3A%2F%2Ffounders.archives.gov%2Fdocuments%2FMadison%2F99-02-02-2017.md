ities of the Constitution are 1st. the mode of its formation, 2d. the division of  
the Supreme powers of Government between the States in their United capacity, and the States in their individual  
capacities.  
1st. It was formed not by the Governments of the component States, as the Federal Government for which it was  
substituted was formed; nor was it formed by a majority of the people of the United States, as a single community, in the  
manner of a consolidated Government.  
It was formed by the States, that is by the people of each State, acting in their highest sovereign capacity,  
and formed consequently by the same authority, which formed the State Constitutions were formed;  
with this characteristic and essential difference, that the Constitution of the United States being a compact among the  
States, that is, the people thereof the parties to the compact, making them even one people for specified objects, cannot  
be revoked or changed at the will of any State within its limits; as the Constitution of a State may be changed at the  
will of the State, that is the people who compose the State and are the parties to its Constitution. The idea of a compact  
between the Governors and the Governed was exploded with the Royal doctrine, that Government was held by some tenure  
independent of the people.  
The constitution of the United States is therefore, within its prescribed

wers of war and taxation, that is the sword and the purse, of commerce and treaties, &amp;ca. vested in the  
Government of the United States, being of as high a character as any of the powers reserved to the State Governments.  
If we advert to the Government of the United States, as created by the Constitution, it is found also to be a  
Government in as strict a sense of the term, within the sphere of its powers, as the governments created by the  
Constitutions of the States are within their respective spheres. It is like them organized into a Legislative,  
Executive and Judicial department. It has, like them, acknowledged cases, in which the powers of those Departments are to  
operate. And the operation is to be the same in both; that is directly on the persons and  
things submitted to their power. The concurrent operation in certain cases, is one of the features constituting the  
peculiarity of the system.  
Between these two Constitutional Governments, the one operating in all the States, the others operating in  
each respectively; with the aggregate powers of Government divided between them, it could not escape attention, that  
controversies concerning the boundary of jurisdiction would arise, and that without some adequate provision for deciding  
them, conflicts of physical force might ensue. A political system that does not provide for a peaceable and authoritative  
termination of occurring controversies, can be but the name and shadow of a Government; the very object and end of a  
real Government being the substitution of law and order, for uncertainty confusion and violence.

3. The last resort within the purview of the Constitution is the process of amendment provided for by itself,  
and to be executed by the States.  
Whether these provisions taken together be the best that might have been made; and if not, what are the  
improvements that ought to be introduced, are questions altogether distinct from the object presented by your  
communication, which relates to the Constitution as it stands.  
In the event of a failure of all these Constitutional resorts against usurpations and abuses of power, and of  
an accumulation thereof rendering passive obedience and non resistance a greater evil, than resistance &amp;  
revolution, there can remain but one resort, the last of all, the appeal from the cancelled obligations of the  
Constitutional compact, to original rights and the law of self-preservation. This is the ultima ratio, under all  
governments, whether consolidated, confederated, or partaking of both those characters. Nor can it be doubted, that in  
such an extremity, a single State would have a right, tho’ it would be a natural not a Constitutional Right, to make the app

n the occasion, which were ably conducted, and  
are understood to have been, for the most part at least, revised by the Speakers; the tenor of them does not disclose any  
reference to a Constitutional right in an individual State, to arrest by force, the operation of a law of the United  
States. Concert among the States for redress against the Alien and Sedition laws, as acts of usurped power, was a leading  
sentiment, and the attainment of a concert, the immediate object of the course adopted, which was an invitation to the  
other States to concur in declaring the acts to be unconstitutional, and to co-operate by the necessary and proper measures in maintaining unimpaired &quot;the authorities  
rights and liberties reserved to the States respectively or to the people.&quot; That by the necessary and proper measures to  
be concurrently and co-operatively taken, were meant measures known  
to the Constitution, particularly the controul of the Legislatures and people of the States over the Congress of the  
United States, cannot well be doubted.  
It is worthy of remark, and explanatory of the intentions of the Legislature, that the words &quot;and not law, but utterly null void and of no force or effect&quot; * which in the Resolution before  
the House followed the word unconstitutional were, near the close of the Debates, stricken out by common consent. It  
appears that the words had been regarded as only surplusage by the friends of the Resolution; but lest they should be  
mis-construed into a

 after such a lapse of time. I certainly never dis=approved the erasure of them.  
Another and still more conclusive evidence of the intentions of the Legislature is given in their address to  
their Constituents, accompanying the publication of their Resolutions. The address warns them against the encroaching  
spirit of the General Government; argues the unconstitutionality of the Alien and Sedition laws; enumerates the other  
instances in which the Constitutional limits had been overleaped; dwells on the dangerous mode of deriving power by  
implication; and in general presses the necessity of watching over the consolidating tendency of the Federal policy. But  
nothing is said that can be understood to look to means of maintaining the rights of the States beyond the regular ones  
within the forms of the Constitution.  
If any further lights on the subject could be needed, a very strong one is reflected from the answers given  
to the Resolutions by the States who protested against them. Their great objection, with a few undefined complaints of the  
spirit and character of the Resolutions, was directed against the assumed authority of a State Legislature to declare a  
law of the United States to be unconstitutional, which they considered an unwarrantable interference with the exclusive  
jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the United States. Had the Resolutions been regarded as avowing and maintaining a  
right, in an individual State, to arrest by force, the execution of a law of the United States, it must be presumed that  
it would have been a pointed and conspicuous object of their denunciation.  
In this review I have not noticed the idea entertained by some, that disputes between the Government of the  
United States and those of the I

 and unanimously adopted as a whole; it being a part of the  
Constitution, that not less than three fourths should be competent to make any alteration in what had been unanimously  
agreed to. So great is the caution on this point, that in two cases, where peculiar interests were at stake, a majority  
even of three fourths are distrusted, and a unanimity required to make any change affecting those cases.  
When the Constitution was adopted as a whole, it is certain there are many of its parts, which if proposed by  
themselves would have been promptly rejected. It is far from impossible, that every part of a whole would be rejected by a  
majority, and yet the whole be unanimously accepted. Constitutions will rarely, probably never, be formed without mutual  
concessions; without articles conditioned on and balancing each other. Is there a Constitution of a single State out of  
the twenty four, that would bear the experiment of having its component parts, submitted to the people separately, and  
decided on according to their insulated merits?  
What the fate of the Constitution of the United States would be, if a few States could expunge parts of it  
most valued by the great majority, and without which the great majority would never have agreed to it– can have but one  
answer.  
The difficulty is not removed by limiting the process to cases of construction. How many cases of that sort,  
involving vital texts of the Constitution, have occurred? How many now exist? How many may hereafter spring up! How many  
might be plausibly created, if entitled to the privilege of a decision in the mode proposed.  
Is it certain that the principle of that mode may not reach much farther than is contemplated? If a single  
State can of right require three fourths of its co-States, to over rule its exposition of the Constitution, because that  
proportion is authorised to amend it; is the plea less plausible, that as the Constitution was unanimously formed, it  
ought to be unanimously expounde
