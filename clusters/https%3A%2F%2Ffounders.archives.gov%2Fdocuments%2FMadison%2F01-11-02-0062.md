ny dangerous and unnecessary powers be given to the general legislature, let them be plainly demonstrated, and let us not rest satisfied with general assertions of dangers, without examination. If powers be necessary, apparent danger is not a sufficient reason against conceding them. He has suggested, that licentiousness has seldom produced the loss of liberty; but that the tyranny of rulers has almost always effected it. Since the general civilization of mankind, I believe there are more instances of the abridgment of the freedom of the people, by gradual and silent encroachments of those in power, than by violent and sudden usurpations: but on a candid examination of history, we shall find that turbulence, violence and abuse of power, by the majority trampling on the rights of the minority, have produced factions and commotions, which, in republics, have more frequently than any other cause, produced despotism. If we go over the whole history of ancient and modern republics, we shall find their destruction to have generally resulted from those causes. If we consider the peculiar situation of the United States, and what are the sources of that diversity of sentiments which pervades its inhabitants, we shall find great danger to fear, that the same causes may terminate here, in the same fatal effects, which they produced in those republics. This danger ought to be wisely guarded against. Perhaps in the progress of this discussion it will appear, that the only possible remedy for those evils, and means of preserving and protecting the principles of republicanism, will be found in that very system which is now exclaimed against as the parent of oppression. I must confess, I have not been able to find his usual consistency, in the gentleman’s arguments on this occasion: he informs us that the people of this country are at perfect repose; that every man enjoys

tatives of this state should carry on their deliberations under the control of any one member of the union? If any state had the power of legislation over the place where congress should fix the general government; this would impair the dignity, and hazard the safety of congress. If the safety of the union were under the control of any particular state, would not foreign corruption probably prevail in such a state, to induce it to exert its controling influence over the members of the general government? Gentlemen cannot have forgotten the disgraceful insult which congress received some years ago.

erties.)  
The power of raising and supporting armies is exclaimed against, as dangerous and unnecessary. I wish there were no necessity of vesting this power in the general government. But suppose a foreign nation to declare war against the United States, must not the general legislature have the power of defending the United States? Ought it to be known to foreign nations, that the general government of the United States of America has no power to raise or support an army, even in the utmost danger, when attacked by external enemies? Would not their knowledge of such a circumstance stimulate them to fall upon us. If, sir, congress be not invested with this power, any powerful nation, prompted by ambition or avarice, will be invited, by our weakness, to attack us; and such an attack, by disciplined veterans, would certainly be attended with success, when only opposed by irregular, undisciplined militia. Whoever considers the peculiar situation of this country; the multiplicity of its excellent inlets and harbours, and the uncommon facility of attacking it, however much he may regret the necessity of such a power, cannot hesitate a moment in granting it

y remarks, till we hear the supplement which he has informed us, he intends to add to what he has already said.  
Give me leave to say something of the nature of the government, and to shew that it is safe and just to vest it with the power of taxation. There are a number of opinions; but the principal question is, whether it be a federal or consolidated government: in order to judge properly of the question before us, we must consider it minutely in its principal parts. I conceive myself, that it is of a mixed nature: it is in a manner unprecedented: we cannot find one express example in the experience of the world: it stands by itself. In some respects, it is a government of a federal nature; in others it is of a consolidated nature. Even if we attend to the manner in which the constitution is investigated, ratified, and made the act of the people of America, I can say, notwithstanding what the honorable gentleman has alledged, that this government is not completely consolidated, nor is it entirely federal. Who are parties to it? The people —but not the people as composing one great body—but the people as composing thirteen sovereignties: were it as the gentleman asserts, a consolidated government, the assent of a majority of the people would be sufficient for its establishment, and as a majority have adopted it already, the remaining states would be bound by the act of the majority, even if they unanimously reprobated it: were it such a government as it is suggested, it would be now binding on the people of this state, without having had the priviledge of deliberating upon it: but, sir, no state is bound by it, as it is, without its own consent. Should all the states adopt it, it will be then a government established by the thirteen states of America, not through the intervention of the legislatures, but by the people at large. In this particular respect the distinction between the existing and proposed governments is very material. The existing system has been derived from the dependent derivative authority of the legislatures of the states; whereas this is derived from the superior power of the people. If we look at the manner in which alterations are to be made in it, the same idea is in some degree attended to. By the new system a majority of the states cannot introduce amendments; nor are all the states required for that purpose; three-fourths of them must concur in alterations; in this there is a departure from the federal idea. The members to the national house of representatives are to be chosen by the people at large, in proportion to the numbers in the respective districts. When we come to the senate, its members are elected by the states in their equal and political capacity; but had the government been completely consolidated, the senate would have been chosen by the people in their individual capacity, in the same manner as the members of the other house. Thus it is of a complicated nature, and this complication, I trust, will be found to exclude the evils of absolute consolidation, as well as of a mere confederacy. If Virginia were separated from all the states, her power and authority would extend to all cases: in like manner were all powers vested in the general government, it would be a consolidated government: but the powers of the federal government are enumerated; it can only operate in certain cases: it has legislative powers on defined and limited objects, beyond which it cannot extend its jurisdiction.  
But the honorable member has satirized with peculiar acrimony, the powers given to the general government by this constitution. I conceive that the first question on this subject is, whether these powers be necessary; if they be, we are reduced to the dilemma of either submitting to the inconvenience, or, losing the union. Let us consider the most important of these reprobated powers; that of direct taxation is most generally objected to. With respect to the exigencies of government, there is no question but the most easy mode of providing for them will be adopted. When therefore direct taxes are not necessary, they will not be recurred to. It can be of little advantage to those in power, to raise money in a manner oppressive to the people. To consult the conveniences of the people, will cost them nothing, and in many respects will be advantageous to them. Direct taxes will only be recurred to for great purposes. What has brought on other nations those immense debts, under the pressure of which many of

uld be given to the general government.  
But it is urged, that its consolidated nature, joined to the power of direct taxation, will give it a tendency to destroy all subordinate authority; that its increasing influence will speedily enable it to absorb the state governments. I cannot think this will be the case. If the general government were wholly independent of the governments of the particular states, then indeed usurpation might be expected to the fullest extent: but, sir, on whom does this general government depend? It derives its authority from these governments, and from the same sources from which their authority is derived. The members of the federal government are taken from the same men from whom those of the state legislatures are taken. If we consider the mode in which the federal representatives will be chosen, we shall be convinced, that the general will never destroy the individual governments; and this conviction must be strengthened by an attention to the construction of the senate. The representatives will be chosen, probably under the influence of the members of the state legislatures: but there is not the least probability that the election of th

d to the interests of their constituent states. Have not those gentlemen who have been honored with seats in congress, often signalized themselves by their attachment to their states? I wish this government may answer the expectation of its friends, and foil the apprehensions of its enemies. I hope the patriotism of the people will continue, and be a sufficient guard to their liberties. I believe its tendency will be, that the state governments will counteract the general interest, and ultimately prevail.

gress rarely ever sat the first session be­  
yond what is now the usual period of  
the termination of our labors.”  
Mr. M adison, who wasone of the del­  
egates from Virginia that framed the  
Constitution, thus expressed himseltj as  
to the mixed nature of the Federal Gov­  
ernment:—  
“ The principal question is, whether  
it be a federal or consolidated govern­  
ment. in order to judge properly ol  
the question before us, we must consid­  
er it minutely in its principal parts. I  
conceive myself that it is oi a mixed na­  
ture—it is in a manner unprecedented;  
we cannot find one express example in  
the experience of the world; it stands by  
itself. In some repects it is a govern­  
ment of a federal nature; in others it is  
of a consolidated nature; even if we at­  
tend to the manner in which the Con­  
stitution is investigated, ratified and  
made the actDf the people of America,  
1 can say, notwithstanding what the hon­  
orable gentleman has alleged, that this  
government is not completely consolida­  
ted—nor is it entirely federal. Who  
are parties to it,? The people—but not  
the people as composing one great body  
—but the people as composing thirteen  
sovereignties: were it, as the gentleman  
asserts, a consolidated government, the  
assent of a majority ot the people ivouid  
be sufficient for its establishment, and  
as a majority have adopted it already,  
the remaining states would lie hound  
by the act of the majority, even if they  
unanimously reprobated it: was it such  
a governmentas is suggested,it would be  
now binding on the people of the State,  
without their having had the privilege  
of deliberating on it; but, sir, no state is  
bound by it, as it is, without its own con­  
sent. Should all the States adopt it, it  
will be then a government established  
by the thirteen States oi America,  
not through the intervention of the le­  
gislatures, but by the people at large.  
In tills particular respect the distinction  
between the existing ami the proposed  
government, i» »erv material. The ex­  
isting system has been derived from the  
dependent derivative authority of the  
legislatures of the States; whereas this  
is derived from the superior power of the  
people. If we look at the manner in  
which alterations arc to he made i’ &#x27;t.  
1 the same idea is in some degree attended  
  
to. By the new* system a majority of (he  
slates cannot introduce amendments j  
nor are ail the states rcq ui red for that p ur­  
j»ose j tiiree/ourUia of them must concur  
m alterations; in this there is a depar­  
ture irons the federal idea: the members  
to uie national House of Representa­  
tives are to be chosen by the people at  
large, in proportion to the numbers in  
the respective districts—when we come  
to the (Senate, its members are elected  
hy the states in their equal and politi­  
cal capacity; but had the government  
been completely consolidated, the $gpa£e  
would have been chosen by the people  
in their individual capacity, in the . same  
manner as the members of the House­  
l bus it is of a complicated nature, and  
this complication, 1 trust, w ill be found  
to.exclude the evils of absolute consoli­  
dation, as well us of a mere confedera­

to the formation of a federal government. The people  
have no right to enter into leagues, alliances, or confe-  
derations; they are not the proper agents for these pur-  
poses; states and sovereign powers are the only proper  
agents for this kind of government.”  
  
Mr. Madison, who was one of the delegates from Vir-  
ginia that framed the constitution, thus expresssed him-  
self, as to the mixed nature of the federal government:—-  
  
‘*The principal question is, whether it bea federal or  
consolidated government. In order to judge properly  
of the question before us, we must consider it minutely  
in its principal parts. I conceive myself that it is of a  
mixed nature—it is ina manner unprecedented; we can-  
not find one express example in the experience of the  
world; it stands by itself. In some respects it is a go-  
vernment of a federal nature: in others it is of a consoli-  
dated nature. Even if we attend to the manner in which  
the constitution is investigated, ratified, and made the  
act ofthe people of America, l can say, notwithstanding  
what the honorable gentleman has alleged, that this go-  
vernment is not completely consolidated—nor is it entire-  
ly federal.—Who are parties to it? The people-—-but  
not the people as composing one great body—but the  
people as composing thirteen sovereignties: were ‘it, as  
the gentleman asserts, a consolidated government, the  
assent of a majority of the people would be sufficient for  
its establishment, and as a majority have adopted it alrea-  
dy, the remaining states would be bound by the act of  
the majority, even if they unanimously reprobated it:  
was it sucha government as is suggested, it would be  
now binding on the people of this state without their  
having had the privilege of deliberating on it; but sir, no  
state is bound by it, as it is, without its own consent.  
Should all the states adopt it, it will be then a govern-  
ment established by the thirteen states of America, not  
through the intervention of the legislatures, but by the  
people at large. In this particular respect, the distinc-  
tion between the existing and the proposed government  
is very material, The existing system has been derived  
from the dependant derivative authority of the legisla-  
tures of the states; whereas this is derived from the su-  
perior power of the people. If we look at the manner  
in which alterations are to be made in it, the same idea is  
in some degree attended to. By the new system, a ma-  
  
jority of the states cannot introduce amendments; nor  
  
are all the states required for that purpose; three fourths  
of them must concur in alterations; in this, there is a de-  
parture from the federal idea: the members to the na-  
tional house of representatives are to be chosen by the  
people at large, in proportion to the numbers in the re-  
spective districts—when we come to the senate, its mem-  
bers are elected by the states in their equal and political  
capacity; buthad the government been completely con-  
solidated, the senate would have been chosen by the peo-  
ple in their individual capacity, in the same manner as  
the members of the other house. ‘hus it is of a com-  
plicated nature, and this complication, I trust, will be  
found to exclude the evils of absolute consolidation, as  
well as of a mere confederacy.”  
  
Mr. Nicholas on the same side, remarked:  
  
*‘In my opinion the expression ‘‘we the people” is  
highly proper—it is submitted to the people because on

with it, as lor the distinguished abilities and virtues ol (lie  
man. He says:  
“The pnncip.il question is, whether it he a Jeiteral or  
a consolidated government. In order to judge properly  
of the question before us, we must consider it minutely in  
its principal parts. 1 conceive, myself, that it is of a mix­

Kven if we attend to the manner in which the constitu­  
tion is investigated, ratified, and made the act oj the peo­  
ple of America, I can say, notwithstanding what the ho­  
norable gentleman has alleged, that this government is  
not completely consolidated ; nor is it entirely federal.— j  
Who are parties to it ?■ The People—bul not the people  
a* composing- one great bod if—but the people as compo­  
sing thirteen sovereignties. Were it, as that gentleman as­  
serts, a consolidated government, the assent of a majority of  
the people would be sufficient for its establishment; and, as  
the majority have adopted it already, the remaining S ates  
would bo hound by the act ol the* majority, even il they  
unanimously reprobated it: were it such a government as  
It is suggested, it would he now binding on the people of  
this State, without having had the privilege of deliberating

Its own consent. Should all the Slates adopt it, it will bo  
then a government established by the thirteen States of  
America, not through the intervention of the legislatures,  
but by the people at large. In this particular respect, the  
distinction between the existing and proposed govern­  
ments is very material. The existing system (confedera­  
tion) has been detived fiom the dependent, derivative au­  
thority ol the Legislatures of the Slate-; whereas this is  
derived from the superior power ot the people. If we  
look *1 (lie manner in which alterations an: to be made in  
it, the same idea, is, in some degree, attended to. By  
the new system a majority of the States cannot intro­  
duce amendments; nor arc all the States required for that  
purpose; three-fourths of (liem must concur in amend­  
ments—in this there is a departure from the federal idea.  
The members to the tuition&#x27;ll House of Representatives  
tire to he chosen by the people at large in proportion to  
the numbers in the respective districts. When we conic  
to the Senate, its members are elected by the States in  
their equal and political capacity. But had the govern­  
ment been completely consolidated, the Senate would have  
been chosen by the people in their individual capacity, in  
the.simc manner as the members of the other House.  
Thus, it is of a complicated nature, and this complication,  
1 trust, will lie found to exclude the evil* of absolute con­  
solidation, as well as of a more confederacy. If Virginia •  
Were separated Iroio all the Slates, her power and audio- j  
rity would extend to all cases : In like manner were all i  
the powers vested in the general government, it would be  
a consolidated government. Hut the powers of the fede- 1  
ral government are enumerated; it can only operate in  
■certain cases: it has legislative powers oti defined and!  
limited objects, beyond which, it cannot inten t its juris- I  
diction.

There may be one further extract permitted from Mr.  
Madison’s speech in the Vitginu Convention: &quot;In some  
respects,” says he, &quot;it is a government ol a federal nature;  
in others, it is ol a consolidated nature. Kven if tve at­  
tend to the manner in which the Constitution is investiga­  
ted, ratified and made the act of the people of America, I  
can say, (hat this government is not completely consolida­  
ted; not is it entirely federal. The members to the ua  
tional House ol Representatives arc to bo cho*en hy the  
people at large, in ptoporlioti lo the numbers in the re­  
spcctivc districts. \\ hen we come to the Senate, its  
members are elected by the State*, in their equal and  
political capacity. But had the government been com­  
pletely consolidated, the Senate could have been chest n •  
hy the people in their individual capacity, in the same  
manner as the other house. Thu* it is ol&#x27; a complicated  
nature,and in this complication, I trust, will he found to  
exclude the evils of absolute consolidation, as well as of a j  
mere confederacy. II Virginia were separated from alf (  
the States, hot power would extend lo all cases. In like  
manner were all the powers vested in the Ucncral Clo­

the constitution of the United States. He said : &quot;Give  
me leave to say something of the nature of the govern­  
merit, and to show that it ja safe and just to vest it with  
&#x27;he power of taxation. There arc a number of opin­  
ions ; but the priucipal questiou is, whether it be a fed­  
eral or consolidated government; in order to judge  
properly of the question before us, we must consider it  
minutely in its principal parts. I conceive myself that  
it i3 of a mixed nature ; it is in a manner unprecedented;  
we cannot find one express example in the experience  
ol&#x27; the world. It sUnds by itself. In some respects it  
h a government of a federal nature ; in others it is of  
a consolidated nature. Even if we attend to the man­  
ner in which the constitution is investigated, ratified and  
made the act of the people of America, I can sav, not­  
withstanding what the honorable gentleman has alleged,  
that this government is not completely consolidated,  
nor is it entirely federal. Who are partie- to it? The  
People?but not the people as composing one great  
&#x27;xidv, but the people as composing thirteen sovereign  
ties: were it as the gentleman asserts, a consolidated  
government, the assent of a majority of the pcoph  
would be sufficient for its establishment, and as a ma­  
jority have adopted it already, the remaining Statef  
would be bound by the act of the majority, even if they  
unanimously reprobated it; -s-ere it such a government  
.is it is suggested, it would be now biuding on the peo­  
ple of this State, without having had the privilege ot  
&#x27;it-liberating upon it; but, sir, no State is bound by it,  
s it is, without its own consent. Should all the States  
idopt it, it will be then a government established by  
the thirteen States of America, not through the inter­  
vention of the legislature, but by the peoDle at large.  
In this particular respect, the distinction between the  
existing and proposed governments is very material  
The existing system has been derived from the depend­  
ent derivative authority of the legislatwres of the States  
whereas this is derived from the superior power of the  
people. If we look at the manner in which alteration?  
are to be made in it, the same idea is in some degree at­  
tendeu to. By the new system, a majority of the States  
cannot introduce amendments ; nor are all the States re­  
quired for that purpose ; three-fourths of them must  
concur in alterations: in this there is a departure from  
ihe federal idea. The members of the national House  
..f Representatives are to be chosen by the people at  
:arge, in proportion to the numbers in the respective  
Jistricts. When we come to the Senate, its members  
are elected by the States in their political capacity ; but  
had the government been completely consolidated, the  
Senate would have been chosen by the people in their  
individual capacity, in the same manner as the members  
nf the other house. Thus it is of a complicated nature,  
and this complication, I trust, will be found to excludc  
the evils of absolute consolidation, as well as of a new  
confederacy. If Virginia was separated from all the.  
States, her power and authority would extend to all ca­  
ses: in like manner were all powers vested in the gen­

He said : &quot; Give me leave to say some­  
thing of the nature of the government,  
and to show that it is safe and just to vest  
it with the power of taxation. There are  
| a number of opinions ; but the principle  
question is, whether it be a federal or  
consolidated government. Iu order to  
judge properly of the question before us,  
we must consider it minutely in all its  
principal parts.. I conceive myself that  
it is of a mixed nature ; it is in a manner  
unprecedented ; we cannot find one ex­  
press example in the experience of the  
world. It stands by itielt. In some re­  
spects it is a government of a federal na­  
ture ; in others it is of a consolidated na­  
ture. Even if we attend to the manner  
in which the constit ution is investiga ed,  
ratified and made the a?t of the people of

the honorable gentleman has alleged,  
that this government is not completely

federation ; it is, otherwise, most clearly a consolidated Government. The  
whole question turns, Sir, om that poor little thing, the expression We,

It wae upon the first of these occasions that Madison replied in the  
Words quoted by Mr Spence. But this gentleman does not commence  
his quotaticn soon enough, and ends ittoo soon. We will give it nearly

osity, exclusive of my anxious solici-  
tude for the public welfare, leads me  
to ask who authorized them to speak  
the language of, we the people, instead of  
we the States? States are the charac-  
teristic and the soul of a confedera-

of this compact, it must be one great  
consolidated national Government of  
the people of all the States.”—Ellioti’s  
Debates, p. 22.  
  
Now, listen to the answer of Mr.  
Madison, to this question. “ Whoare  
the parties to it? The people—but

not the people, as composing one great  
body; but the people as composing  
thirteen sovereignties, Were it, as the  
gentleman asserts, a consolidated gov-  
ernment, a consent of a majority of  
the people would be sufficient for its  
establishment ; and as a majority have  
adopted it already, the remaining  
States would be bound by the act of  
the majority, even if they unanimously  
reprobated it. Were it such a goy-  
ernment as is suggested, it would now  
be binding on the people of this State,  
without their having the privilege of  
deliberating upon it. But, sir, no  
State is bound by it as it is, without its  
own consent. Should all the States  
adopt it, it will then be a government  
established by the thirteen States of  
America, not through the intervention  
of the legislatures, but by the people of  
each State at large.” (p. 94.)  
  
This statement places the subject in  
its true light. And yet, men within  
the last thirty years, in their sapience,  
put on the cast-off garment of Patrick  
Henry, and have strutted before the  
public as the expounders of the Consti-  
tution! Patrick Henry was satisfied  
with this statement of Mr. Madison;  
at least he made no reply at the time  
and no objection in his speech after-  
wards. Others ought to be satisfied

fair discussion. If powers be necessary, apparent danger is not a sufficient  
reason against conceding them. Since the general civilization of mankind  
there had been more instances of the abridgment of the freedom of the  
people, by the gradual and silent encroachments of those in power, than by  
violent and sudden usurpation. The history of ancient and modern repub-

ation of the peculiar situation of the United States, and the causes of the  
diversity of sentiment which pervaded their inhabitants, there is great dan-  
ger that the same causes may terminate in the same fatal effects they had

the only possible remedy for those evils, and the means of protecting and

THE CONVENTION OF VIRGINIA, 1788 571  
  
  
  
respects it is of a federal nature, in others of a consolidated nature. In the  
manner in which the Constitution is investigated, ratified, and made the act  
of the people of America, it is not completely consolidated nor entirely  
federal, Who are the parties to it? The people, but not the people as com-  
posing our great body, but the people as composing thirteen sovereignties.  
No State is bound by it without its own consent. Should all the States  
adopt it, it will be a government established by the thirteen States of  
America, not through the intervention of legislatures, but by the people at  
large. In this respect, the distinction between the existing and proposed  
system is very material; that, was created by the dependent, derivative power  
of the legislatures of the States, this, will be by the superior power of the  
people. This same idea is in some degree attended to in the provision for  
alterations. A majority of the States cannot introduce amendments, nor  
are all required for that purpose. Three-fourths must concur. In this  
there is a departure from the federal idea. The members of the House of  
Representatives are to be chosen by the people at large in proportion to  
the numbers in the respective districts. The Senate is elected by the  
States in their equal and political capacity. Had the government been  
completely consolidated the Senate would have been elected by the people  
in their individual capacity. Thus it is of a complicated nature, and the  
complication may be hoped to exclude the evils of an absolute consolidated  
government, as well as those of a mere confederacy. If Virginia was  
separated, her power and authority would extend to all cases; if all powers  
were vested in the general government, it would be a consolidated govern-  
ment, but the powers of the general government are enumerated. It has  
legislative powers on defined and limited objects, beyond which it cannot  
extend its jurisdiction. If any of those powers be necessary, inconvenien

be not the agents of this compact, it must be one great consolidated,

This view of the nature of the new government he continually referred  
to, and insisted on. Mr. Madison in reply said: “ 1 conceive myself that it
