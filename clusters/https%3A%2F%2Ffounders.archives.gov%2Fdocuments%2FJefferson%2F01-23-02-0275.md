as been the Highest punishment allowed by the laws.  
  
To most minds it is next to death: to many beyond it.  
The Fugitive indeed is not of the latter: he must estimate it somewhat less than death.  
It may be said that to some, as Foreigners, it is no punishment.  
Answ. these cases are few. Laws are to be made for the mass of cases.  
  
The object of a Convention then in other cases would be that the Fugitive might not avoid the difference between Exile, and the legal punishment of the Case.  
Now in what case would this Difference be so important as to overweigh even the single Inconvenience of multiplying compacts?  
  
1st. Treason. This, when real, merits the highest punishment.  
  
But most Codes extend their definitions of treason to acts not really against one’s country.  
  
They do not distinguish between acts against the government, and acts against the oppressions of the Government.  
The latter are virtues: yet have furnished more victims to the Executioner than the former.  
  
Because real Treasons are rare: Oppressions frequent.  
  
The unsuccessful strugglers against Tyranny have been the chief martyrs of Treason laws in all countries.  
  
Reformation of government with our neighbors, as much wanting now as Reformation of religion is or ever was anywhere.  
  
We should not wish then to give up to the Executioner the Patriot who fails, and flies to us.  
  
Treasons then, taking the simulated with the real, are sufficiently punished by Exile.  
  
  
2nd. Crimes against Property.

All who now oppose the opinions of the Ad-  
ministration are calied traitors, and all who  
know enough to distinguish between govern-  
ment and the illegal acts of government are  
called Copperheads. Just such a Copperhead  
was Jefferson, for he declared that “ ‘l&#x27;reason,  
when real, merits the highest punishment. But  
codes extend definitions of treason to acts not  
really against one’s country. They do not dis-
