gMEMORIALTo their High Mightinesses, the States General of the United Provinces of the Low Countries.High and Mighty Lords,The subscriber has the honour, to propose to your High Mightinesses, that the United States of America, in Congress assembled, have lately thought fit to send him a Commission (with full powers and instructions) to confer with your H. M. concerning a treaty of amity and commerce, an authentic copy of which he has the honour to annex to this Memorial.At the times when the treaties between this republic and the crown of Great Britain were made, the people, who now compose the United States of America, were a part of the English nation; as such, allies of the republic, and parties to those treaties; entitled to all their benefits, and submitting cheerfully to all their obligations.It is true, that when the British administration, renouncing the ancient character of Englishmen for generosity, justice and humanity, conceived the design of subverting the political systems of the colonies; depriving them of the rights and liberties of Englishmen, and reducing them to the worst of all forms of government, starving the people by blockading the ports, and cutting off their fisheries and commerce; sending fleets and armies to destroy every principle and sentiment of liberty, and to consume their habitations and their lives; making contracts for foreign troops, and alliances with savage nations to assist them in their enterprise; casting formally, by act of parliament, three millions of people at once out of the protection of the crown; then, and not till then, did the United States of America, in Congress assembled, pass that memorable act, by which they assumed an equal station among the nations.This immortal declaration, of the 4th of July, 1776,  
when America was invaded by an hundred vessels of war, and, according to estimates laid before parliament, by 55,000 of veteran troops, was not the effect of any sudden passion, or enthusiasm; but a measure which had been long in deliberation among the people, maturely discussed in some hundreds of popular assemblies, and by public writings in all the states: it was a measure which congress did not adopt until they had received the positive instructions of their constituents in all the states: it was then unanimously adopted by congress, subscribed by all its members, transmitted to the assemblies of the several states, and by them respectively accepted, ratified and recorded among their archives; so that no decree, edict, statute, placart or fundamental law of any nation was ever made with more solemnity, or with more unanimity or cordiality adopted, as the act and consent of the whole people, than this: and it has been held sacred to this day by every state, with such unshaken firmness, that not even the smallest has ever been induced to part from it: although the English have wasted many millions, and vast fleets and armies, in the vain attempt so invalidate it. On the contrary, each of the thirteen states has instituted a form of government for itself under the authority of the people; has erected its legislature in the several branches; its executive authority with all its offices; its judiciary department and judges; its army, militia, revenue, and some of them their navy: and all those departments of government have been regularly and constitutionally organized under the associated superintendency of congress, now these five years, and have acquired a consistency, solidity and activity equal to the oldest and most established governments. It is true, that in some speeches and writings of the English it is still contended, that the people of America are still in principle and affection with them: but these assertions are made against such evident truth and demonstration, that it is surprising they should find at this day one believer in the world. One may appeal to the writings and recorded speeches of the English for the last seventeen years, to shew, that similar misrepresentations have been incessantly repeated through that whole period, and that the conclusion of every year has in fact confuted the confident assertions and predictions of the beginning of it. The subscriber begs leave to say from his own knowledge of the people of America, (and he has a better right to obtain credit, because he has better opportunity to know, than any Briton whatsoever) that they are unalterably determined to maintain their independence. He confesses, that notwithstanding his confidence through his whole life in the virtuous sentiments and uniformity of character among his countrymen, their unanimity has surprised him: that all the power, arts, intrigues and bribes, which have been employed in the several states, should have seduced from the standard of virtue so contemptible a few, is more fortunate than could have been expected. This independence stands upon so broad and firm a bottom of the people’s interests, honour, consciences and affections, that it will not be affected by any successes the English may obtain either in America, or against the European powers at war, nor by any alliances they can possibly form; if indeed in so unjust and desperate a cause they can obtain any. Nevertheless, although compelled by necessity, and warranted by the fundamental laws of the colonies, and of the British constitution, by principles avowed in the English laws, and confirmed by many examples in the English history, by principles interwoven into the history and public right of Europe, in the great examples of the Helvetic and Belgic confederacies, and many others; and frequently acknowledged and ratified by the diplomatic body, principles founded in eternal justice, and the laws of God and nature, to cut asunder forever, all the ties which had connected them with Great Britain: yet the people of America did not consider themselves as separating from their allies, especially the republic of the United Provinces, or departing from their connexions with any of the people under their government; but, on the contrary, they preserved the same affection, esteem and respect for the Dutch nation, in every part of the world, which they and their ancestors had ever entertained.When sound policy dictated to congress the precaution of sending persons to negotiate natural alliances in Europe, it was not from a failure in respect that they did not send a Minister to your High Mightinesses, with the first whom they sent abroad: but instructed in the nature of the connections between Great Britain and the republic, and in the system of peace and neutrality, which she had so long pursued, they thought proper to respect both so far, as not to seek or embroil her with her allies, to excite divisions in the nation, or lay embarrassments before it. But, since the British Administration, uniform and persevering in injustice, despising their allies, as much as their colonists and fellow subjects; disregarding the faith of treaties, as much as that of royal charters; violating the law of nations, as they had before done the fundamental laws of the colonies and the inherent rights of British subjects, have arbitrarily set aside all the treaties between the crown and the republic, declared war and commenced hostilities, the settled intentions of which they had manifested long before; all those motives, which before restrained the congress, cease: and an opportunity presents of proposing such connections, as the United States of America have a right to form, consistent with the treaties already formed with France and Spain, which they are under every obligation of duty, interest and inclination to observe sacred and inviolate; and consistent with such other treaties, as it is their intention to propose to other sovereigns.If there was ever among nations a natural alliance, one may be formed between the two republics. The first planters of the four northern states found in this country an asylum from persecution, and resided here from the year one thousand six hundred and eight to the year one thousand six hundred and twenty, twelve years preceding their migration. They ever entertained and have transmitted to posterity, a grateful remembrance of that protection and hospitality, and especially of that religious liberty they found here, having sought it in vain in England.The first inhabitants of two other states, New-York and New-Jersey, were immediate emigrants from this nation, and have transmitted their religion, language, customs, manners and character: and America in general, until her connections with the house of Bourbon, has ever considered this nation as her first friend in Europe, whose history, and the great characters it exhibits, in the various arts of peace, as well as achievements of war by sea and land, have been particularly studied, admired and imitated in every state.A similitude of religion, although it is not deemed so essential in this as in former ages to the alliance of nations, is still, as it ever will be thought, a desirable circumstance. Now it may be said with truth, that there are no two nations, whose worship, doctrine and discipline, are more alike than those of the two republics. In this particular therefore, as far as it is of weight, an alliance would be perfectly natural.A similarity in the forms of government, is usually considered as another circumstance, which renders alliances natural: and although the constitutions of the two republics are not perfectly alike, there is yet analogy enough between them, to make a connection easy in this respect.In general usages, and in the liberality of sentiments in those momentous points, the freedom of enquiry, the right of private judgment and the liberty of conscience, of so much importance to be supported in the world, and imparted to all mankind, and which at this hour are in more danger from Great Britain and that intolerant spirit which is secretly fomenting there, than from any other quarter, the two nations resemble each other more than any others.The originals of the two republics are so much alike, that the history of one seems but a transcript from that of the other: so that every Dutchman instructed in the subject, must pronounce the American revolution just and necessary, or pass a censure upon the greatest actions of his immortal ancestors: actions which have been approved and applauded by mankind, and justified by the decision of Heaven.But the circumstance, which perhaps in this age has stronger influence than any other in the formation of friendships between nations, is the great and growing interest of Commerce; of the whole system of which through the globe, your High Mightinesses are too perfect masters, for me to say any thing that is not familiarly known. It may not however be amiss to hint, that the central situation of this country, her extensive navigation, her possessions in the East and West-Indies, the intelligence of her merchants, the number of her capitalists, and the riches of her funds, render a connection with her very desirable to America:—and on the other hand, the abundance and variety of the productions of America, the materials of manufactures, navigation and commerce; the vast demand and consumption in America of the manufactures of Europe, of merchandises from the Baltic, and from the East-Indies, and the situation of the Dutch possessions in the West-Indies, cannot admit a doubt, that a connection with the United States would be useful to this republic. The English are so sensible of this, that notwithstanding all their professions of friendship, they have ever considered this nation as their rival in the American trade; a sentiment which dictated and maintained their severe act of navigation, as injurious to the commerce and naval power of this country, as it was both to the trade and the rights of the colonists.—There is now an opportunity offered to both, to shake off this shackle forever. If any consideration whatever could have induced them to have avoided a war with your High Mightinesses, it would have been the apprehension of an alliance between the two republics: and it is easy to foresee, that nothing will contribute more to oblige them to a peace, than such a connection once completely formed. It is needless to point out particularly, what advantages might be derived to the possessions of the republic in the West Indies from a trade opened, protected and encouraged between them and the continent of America; or what profits might be made by the Dutch East-India Company, by carrying their effects directly to the American market; or how much even the trade of the Baltic might be secured and extended by a free intercourse with America, which has ever had so large a demand, and will have more for hemp, cordage, sail-cloth and other articles of that commerce: how much the national navigation would be benefited by building and purchasing ships there: how much the number of seamen might be increased, or how much advantages to both countries, to have their ports mutually opened to their men of war and privateers and their prizes.If therefore an analogy of religion, government, original, manners, and the most extensive and lasting commercial interests, can form a ground and an invitation to political connections, the subscriber flatters himself, that in all these particulars the union is so obviously natural, that there has seldom been a more distinct designation of providence to any two distant nations to unite themselves together.It is further submitted to the wisdom and humanity of your High Mightinesses, whether it is not visibly for the good of mankind, that the powers of Europe, who are convinced of the justice of the American cause, (and where is one to be found that is not?) should make haste to acknowledge the Independence of the United States, and form equitable treaties with them, as the surest means of convincing G. Britain of the impracticability of her pursuits?—whether the late marine treaty concerning the rights of neutral vessels, noble and useful as it is, can be established against Great Britain, who will never adopt it, nor submit to it, but from necessity, without the independence of America? whether the return of America,  
with her nurseries of seamen and magazines of materials for navigation and commerce, to the domination and monopoly of Great Britain, if that were practicable, would not put the possessions of other nations beyond seas wholly in the power of that enormous empire, which has been long governed wholly by the feeling of its own power at least without a proportional attention to justice, humanity, or decency. When it is obvious and certain, that the Americans are not inclined to submit again to the British government, on the one hand, and that the powers of Europe ought not and could not with safety consent to it, if they were, on the other; why should a source of contention be lest open, for future contingencies to involve the nations of Europe in still more bloodshed, when, by one decisive step of the maritime powers, in making treaties with a nation long in possession of sovereignty by right and in fact, it might be closed?The Example of your High Mightinesses would, it is hoped, be followed by all the maritime powers, especially those which are parties to the late marine treaty; nor can apprehension, that the independence of America would be injurious to the trade of the Baltic, be any objection. This jealousy is so groundless, that the reverse would happen. The freight and insurance in voyages across the Atlantic are so high, and the price of labor in America so dear, that tar, pitch, turpentine and ship timber never can be transported to Europe at so cheap a rate, as it has been and will be afforded by countries round the Baltic. This commerce was supported by the English before the revolution with difficulty, and not without large Parliamentary bounties. Of hemp, cordage and sail cloth there will not probably be a sufficiency raised in America for her consumption in many centuries, for the plainest of all reasons, because these articles may be imported from Amsterdam, or even from Petersburg and Archangel, cheaper than they can be raised at home. America will therefore be for ages a market for these articles of the Baltic trade.Nor is there more solidity in another supposition, propagated by the English to prevent other nations from pursuing their true interests, that the colonies of other nations will follow the example of the United States. Those powers, who have as large possessions as any beyond seas, have already declared against England, apprehending no such consequences. Indeed there is no probability of any other power of Europe following the example of England, in attempting to change the whole system of the government of colonies, and reducing them by oppression to the necessity of governing themselves: and without such manifest injustice and cruelty on the part of the metropolis, there is no danger of colonies attempting innovations. Established governments are founded deep in the hearts, the passions, the imaginations and understanding of the people; and without some violent change from without, to alter the temper and character of the whole people, it is not in human nature to exchange safety for danger, and certain happiness

which they assumed an equal station among  
the nations, . &#x27;  
This immortal Declaration, of the 4th of

an hondred veflels of war, and, according to  
estimates laid before Parliament, by 55,000  
‘of veterantroops, was not the effect or any  
sudden passion, or enthusiasm ; but a mea­  
sure which had been long in deliberation  
‘;monﬁ the people, maturely discussed in  
some hundreds of popular assemblies, and by  
public writings in all the Sates : It was a  
meifure which Congress did not adopt until  
;ge ‘had reccived the positive instructions of  
tb:{r confituents in all the Statee 1&lt; It waa  
then unanimously adopted by Congrels, sub­  
scribed by all its membe:s, tranimitted 10  
the assemblies of the several States, and  
by them respectively accepted, ratified and  
recorded among their archicves : fothat no  
decree, edict, flatute, placart or fundamental  
Jaw of any Nation was ever made with  
more folemoity, or with more unanimity  
or cordiality adopted, asthe zét and con­  
sent of the whole people, than this :  
and it has been held sacred to this day by  
every State, with such vnfhaken firmnefs,  
that not even the smallest has ever been in­  
duced to depart from it ; although the En­  
glith have waftsd many millions, and vast

&quot;R similarity in the forms of government,  
¢ usually canfidered as anocher circumttance,  
which renders alliances natural : And alktho’  
the comftiturions of the two * Republicks  
wre not perfeétly aliks, there is yet analogy  
enough between them,to make a connection  
iy in this respect.  
In general ulages, and in the liberality of  
sentiments in those m-mentous points, the  
freedom of inquiry,the right of private judg -  
ment and the liberty ot conscience, of 10  
much imporiance to be fuppoited in the  
world, and imparted to 2!l mmankind, and  
which at this hour are in more danger from  
Great Britain and that intolerant {pirit which  
is secretly fomenting there than trom afy  
other quarter, the twe Nations reiembled  
each other more than any others. ‘  
THe originals of the two Republicks are so  
much alike, that the hiflory of one {eems  
but a transcript from that of the other : So  
that every Dutchman infiructed in the tub-  
Jecls, muflt pronounce the American revolu­  
tion j 1t and necessary, or pass a &amp; afure up­  
on the greatest actions of his immortal an­  
ceflors : Aftions which have been approved  
and applauded by manKkind, and juitified By:‘f  
the decision of Heaven. &#x27;  
But the circumstance, which perhaps in  
this age has fironger influence than any other  
in che tormation of friendthips between na­  
tions, is the great and growing interefl of  
commerce ; ot the whole {yftem of which  
through the globe, your High Mightinefius  
are too perfeét masters for me tofay any thing  
that is not familiar!; Known, It may not  
hows=ver bs amiss to hint, that the central  
fituatian of this country, her extensive navi­  
fa‘c&#x27;-i-&#x27;vn,%hcr pﬂ&#x27;cz{lpns in the East and Weft  
ndies, the is(eiligence of her merchants,the  
number of her capitalists, and the riches of  
her tunds, render a conneétion with her very  
desirable thAmerica : And on the other hand,  
the abundance and variety of the productions  
ot America, the materiais of manufaétures,  
navigagion ‘and commerce: the vast demaad  
and confumiption in America of the manu­  
factures in Europe, of merchandises from the  
Baitic, and from the East Indies;, and the  
fi:uation of the Dutch pofféflions in the Weit  
ludies, cannot admit of a doubt that a con­  
nection with the United States would be ufe­  
ful to this Republic. The Engiifth are so  
fenfib&#x27;e of this chat notwithstanding all their  
protefiions of friendfhip,they have ever confi­  
d=red this nation as their rival in theAmeri­  
&amp;an trad=;a sentiment which di¢tated&amp; main­  
tained their severe aét of navigation, as in­  
jurcus to the commerce and naval power of  
this country, as it was both to the trade and  
the rights of the Colonifls. There is now  
an opportunity offered to both, to thake off  
this thackle forever, If any consideration  
whatever could have induced them to bave  
avoided a 2 war with your High Mightinefies,  
it would have been the apprehension of an  
Alliance between the two Republics: and  
it is easy to forfee, that nothing will con­  
tribute more to oblige them to a peace, than  
such 2 conneftion once completely formed.  
It is needless to point eut particularly, what  
‘advantages might be derived to the possessi­  
ons of the Republic in the Weft Indies from  
a trade opened, proteted and encouraged be­  
tween them and the Continent of America;  
or what profits might be made by theDuatch  
East India company, by carrying their eff:&amp;s  
dir=&amp;ly to the American marketgor how  
much even the trade of the Bailtic mightbe  
secured and extended by a free intercourse  
with America, which has ever had so large  
a demand, and will have more for hemp,  
«€ordage, fail- cloth, and other articles of that  
esmmerce : how much the. national navi­  
gation would be benefited by building and  
purchasing thips there : how much the num­  
ber of seamen mighi be encreafed, or how  
much advantages 1o both countries, to bave.  
their ports mutually opened to their men of  
war and privateers and their prizes. s  
- _lf therefore an analogy of- religion, go­  
vernment, original manners, and the most  
extensive and laiting commercial. interests,  
can form a ground and an invitation to po­  
litical conne&amp;ions, the subscriber flatters  
bimfelf, that in all&#x27;thefe pasticulars the Uni­  
o= [o obviously natural, that there has fel­  
#4&lt; ieen a 2 more diftinét designation of Pro­  
w7z eto any two distant nations to unite  
“hon elves together, 2t B L  
i+ further submitted to the wisdom and  
% . fry of your High Mightinesses, whe­  
¢ .21 isnot visibly forthe good of mankind,  
‘7. Ilie powers of Europe, who are convin­

méans oﬂ’!ﬁﬁvi’nﬂing‘ Great-Britain’ of the­  
impracticability of her pursuits ? Whethee  
the late Marine treaty concerning the rights  
of neutral veflels, noble and uferul’ as it iBS,  
can be eftablithed against Great Britain wha  
will never adopt it, nor tubmit to it, but fromne  
necetiity, without the Independence of Ame­  
rica ? whether the return of America, with  
her nurseries of seamen and magazines of  
materials for navigation and commerce, to  
the domtination and monopoly of Great Bri=  
tain, if that were praéticable would not put  
the pofleflions of other nations beyond seas  
wholly in the power of that enormous Em=  
pire, which has been long governed whollg  
by the feeling of its own power, at leafk  
without a proportional attention to juflice,  
humanity or decency. When it is cbvious  
and certain, that the Americans are not in=  
clined te {ubmit again to the Biitith Govern­  
ment, on the one iand, and ghat the powers  
of Europe ought not and couid not wich fafe­  
ty conlent to ir, if they were on the other,  
why should a fourfe of contention be left open  
for future eontingencies to involve the nati=  
.ens of Europe in still more bloodthed, when;  
by one decisive flep of the maritime powers,  
in making treaties with 2 nation long in  
pofleiiion of sovereignty by right and in faék,  
it might be closed ? ,  
The example of your High Mightinesses  
would, it is hoped, be followed by all the  
ma:itime powers, especially those which are  
parties to the late marine treaty : nor can  
apprehenfion,that the Independence of Ame­  
rica would be injurious to the trade of the  
Baltic, be any objection. This jealousy is f@  
groundless, that the reverse would happen,  
‘T&#x27;he freignt and insurance in voyages across  
the Atlantic are ¢ high, and che price of la­  
bour in America {o dear. that tar, pitch, ture  
pentine and ship timber never can be trans­  
ported to Burope ar so cheap a rate, as it has  
been and will be ass rded by countries round  
the Baltic, This commerce was supported  
by the Englith betore the revoluifon with  
difficulty, and not without large Parliamens  
tary bounties. Ot hemp, co&#x27;dag: and fuil­  
cloth rhere will not probably be a tufficiency  
raised in America for her own consumption  
in many centuries, for the plainefl of all rea­  
sons, becaute thele articles may be import=  
ed irom Amflerdam, or even from Peterf­  
burgh and Archangel, cheaper than can be  
raited at home. America will therefore be  
for ages a market for these articles of the  
B:liic trade,  
Nor is there more solidity in another fup=  
position, propagated by the Erglifh to pre­  
vent other natisns from pursuing Iheir true  
interest, that the Colonies of other nations  
will follow the example of the United Srates.  
Those powers who have as large pcfleflions  
as any beyond seas, have already declared  
against England, apprehending no such con­  
sequences, lndeed there is no probability  
ot any other power of Europe following the  
example of England,inattempting tochange  
the whole system of government of Colonies,  
and reducing them by oppreflion to the ne­  
ceflity of governing themielves; and with­  
out such manifeft injustice and cruelty on the  
part of the Metropolis, there is no danget of  
Qolonies attempting innovations. Eftablith­  
ed governments are founded deep in the  
hearts, the passions, the imaginations and un­  
derstandings

t Britain and the Republic,  
and in the ſyſtem of peace and neutrality, which ſhe had  
  
  
far, as not to ſeek to embroil her with her allies, to excite  
diviſions in the nation, or lay embarraſſments before it.  
  
  
ſevering in injuſtice, deſpiſing their allies, as much as  
  
  
of treaties, as much as that of royal charters ; violatin  
  
the law of nations, as they had before done the funda-  
mental laws of the Colonies and the inherent rights of  
Britiſh ſubje&amp;s, have arbitrarily ſet aſide all the treaties  
  
  
they had manifeſted long before; all thoſe motives, which  
before reſtrained the Congreſs, ceaſe : and an opportunity  
  
eſents itſelf of propoſing ſuch connections, as the United  
States of America have a right to form, conſiſtent with  
  
  
they are under every obligation of duty, intereſt and in-  
  
  
to other ſovereigns. | | |  
  
If there was ever among nations a natural alliance,  
one — formed between the two Republics. The  
firſt planters of the four northern States found in this  
8 aſylum from perſecution, and reſided here  
from the year 1608 to the year 1620, twelve years pre-  
ceding their migration. They ever entertained and have  
tranſmitted to poſterity, a grateful remembrance of that  
protection and hoſpitality, and eſpecially of that religious  
  
  
E  
liberty they found here, having ſought it in vain in  
England. |  
  
The firſt inhabitants of two other States, New-York  
and New-Jerſey, were immediate emigrants from this  
nation, and have tranſmitted their religion, language,  
cuſtoms, manners and character: And America in ge-  
neral, until her connections with the Houſe of Bourbon,  
has ever conſidered this nation as her firſt friend in  
Europe, whoſe hiſtory, and the great characters it ex-  
hibits, in the various arts of peace, as well as atchieve-  
ments of war by ſea and land, have been particularly  
ſtudied, admired and imitated in every State.  
  
A ſimilitude of religion, although it is not deemed ſo  
eſſential in this as in former ages to the alliance of nations,  
is ſtill, as it ever will be thought, a deſirable circum-  
| ſtance, Now it may be ſaid with truth, that there are no  
two nations, whoſe worſhip, doctrine and diſcipline, are  
more alike than thoſe of the two Republics. In this par-  
ticular therefore, as far as it is of weight, an alliance  
would be perfectly natural. | |  
  
A ſimilarity in the forms of government, is uſually  
conſidered as another circumſtance, which renders al-  
liances natural: And although the conſtitutions of the  
two Republics are not perfectly alike, there is yet analogy  
—_ between them, to make a connection eaſy. in this  
reſpect.  
  
n general uſages, and in the liberality of ſentiments in  
thoſe momentous points, the freedom of enquiry, the  
right of private judgment and the liberty of conſcience, of  
| ſo much importance to be ſupported in the world, and  
imparted to all mankind, and which at this hour are in  
more danger from Great Britain and that intolerant ſpirit  
which is ſecretly fomenting there, than from any other  
quarter, the two nations reſemble each other more than  
any others.  
  
The originals of the two Republics are ſo much alike,  
that the hiſtory of one ſeems but a tranſcript from that of  
the other: ſo that every Dutchman inſtructed in the  
ſubject, muſt pronounce the American revolution juſt and  
neceſſary, or paſs a cenſure upon the greateſt actions of  
Tus immortal anceſtors: actions which have been approved

But the circumſtance, which perhaps in this age has  
ſtronger influence than any other in the formation of  
friendſhips between nations, is the great and growing  
intereſt of commerce; of the whole ſyſtem of which  
through the globe, your High Mightineſſes are too perfect  
maſters for me to ſay any thing that is not familiarly  
known. It may not, however, be amiſs to hint, that  
  
  
gation, her poſſeſſions in the Eaſt and Weſt Indies, the  
intelligence of her merchants, the number of her capi-  
taliſts, and the riches of her funds, render a connection  
with her very deſirable to America: and, on the other  
hand, the abundance and variety of the productions of  
America, the materials of manufactures, navigation and  
commerce; the vaſt demand and conſumption in Ame -  
  
  
the Baltic, and from the Eaſt Indies, and the ſituation of  
the Dutch poſlefions in the Weſt Indies, cannot admit of  
a doubt, that a connection with the United States would  
be uſcful to this Republic. The Engliſh are fo ſenſible  
of this, that notwithſtanding all their profeſſions of irzend-  
ſhip, they have ever conſidered this nation as their rival in  
  
  
maintained their ſevere act of navigation, as injurious to  
the commerce and naval power of this country, as it was  
both to the trade and the rights of the Coloniſts. There  
is now an opportunity offered to both, to ſhake off this  
ſhackle for ever. If any conſideration Whatever could  
  
  
Mightineſſes, it would have been the apprehenſion of an  
alliance between the two Republics: and it is eaſy to  
foreſee, that nothing will contribute more to oblige them  
to a peace, than ſuch a connection once completely  
tormed. It is needleſs to point out, particularly, what  
advantages might be derived to the poſleſſions of the Re-  
public in the Weſt Indies from a trade opened, protected  
and encouraged, between them and the Continent of  
  
  
Eaſt India Company, by carrying their effects directly to  
the American market; or how much even the trade of  
| | the  
  
| [ WW 1  
  
the Baltie might be ſecured and extended by a free inter-  
courſe with America, which has ever had fo large a de-  
mand, and will have more for hemp, cordage, ſail-cloth,  
and other articles of that commerce : how much the  
national navigation would be benefited by building and  
purchaſing ſhips there : how much the number of ſeamen  
might be increaſed, or how much more adyantageous it  
would prove to both countries, to have their ports mutuaily  
opened to their men of war and privateers, and to their  
prizes. ö |  
  
If, therefore, an analogy of religion, government,  
origin, manners, and the moſt extenſive and laſting com-  
mercial intereſts, can form a ground and an invitation to  
political connections, the ſubſcriber flatters himſelf that,  
in all theſe particulars, the union is ſo obviouſly natural,  
that there has ſeldom been a more diſtinct deſignation of  
  
  
together. | | |  
  
It is further ſubmitted to the wiſdom and humanity of  
your High Mightineſſes, whether it is not viſibly for the  
good of mankind, that the powers of Europe, who are  
convinced of the juſtice of the American cauſe, (and  
where is one to be found that is not?) ſhould make haſte  
to acknowledge the independence of the United States,  
and form equitable treaties with them, as the ſureſt means  
of convincing Great Britain of the impracticability of her  
purſuits? Whether the late marine treaty concerning the  
rights of neutral veſſels, noble and uſeful as it is, can be  
eſtabliſhed againſt Great Britain, who will never adopt it,  
nor ſubmit to it, but from neceſſity, without the inde-  
  
  
with her nurſeries of ſeamen and magazines of materials  
for navigation and commerce, to the domination and  
  
  
would not put the poſſeſſions of other nations beyond ſeas  
wholly in the power of that enormous empire, which has  
been long governed wholly by the feeling of its own  
power, at leaſt without a proportional attention to juſtice,  
humanity, or decency. When it is obvious and certain  
that the Americans are not inclined to ſubmit again to the  
Britiſh government, on the one hand, and that the powers  
of Europe ought not and could not with ſafety conſent to

full Powers and Inſtructions) to confer with your  
H. M. concerning a Treaty of Amity and Commer-  
  
  
to annex to this Memorial,  
  
At the times when the Treaties between this Re-  
publick and the Crown of Great-Britain were made,

America, were a Part of the English Nation; as  
ſuch, Allies of the Republick , and Parties to thoſe  
Treaties ; entitled to all their Benefits, and ſubmit-  
ting chearfally to all their Obligations.  
  
It is true, that when the British Adminiſtration,  
renouncing the ancieat Character of Epnglishmen  
for Generoſity, Juſtice and Humanity , conceived  
the deſign of ſubverting the political Syſtems of the  
  
  
ties of Englishmen, and reducing them to the worſt  
of all Forms of Government, ſtarving the People  
by blockading the Ports, and cutting off their Fishe-  
ries and Commerce ; ſending Fleets and Armies to  
deſtroy every principle and ſentiment of Liberty,  
and to conſume their Habitations and their Lives;  
making Contracts for foreign Troops, and Alliances

This immortal Declaration, of the a of July 1776,

but a meaſure which had been long in deliberation  
among the People, maturely discusſed in ſome hun-

greſs did not adopt until they had received the  
poſitive Inſtruftions of their Conſtituents in all the  
States: it was then unanimously adopted by Con-  
greſs, ſubſcribed by all its Members, transmitted

A Similitude of Religion, although it is not dee-  
med ſo eſſential in this as in former Ages to the  
Alliance of Nations, is ſitill, as it ever will be  
thought, a deſirable Circumſtance. Now it may be  
ſaid with Truth, that there are no two Nations,  
whoſe Worship, Doctrine and Diſcipline, are more  
alike than thoſe of the two Republicks. In this  
particular therefore , as far as it is of weight, an  
Alliance would be perfeQiy natural.  
  
A Similarity in the Forms of Government , is  
uſually. conſidered as another Circumſtance , which  
renders Alliances natural: and although the Conſti-  
tutions of the two Republicks are not perfectly ali-  
ke, there is yet Analogy enough between them ,  
  
  
In general Uſages, and in the Liberalicy of Sen-  
timents in thoſe momentous Points, the Freedom  
of Enquiry , the Right of private Judgment and  
the Liberty of Conſcience, cf ſo much [mportan-  
ce to be ſupported in the World, and imparted to  
all Mankind, and which at this Hour are in more  
danger from Great Britain and that intolerant ſpirit  
which is ſecretly fomenting there, than from any  
other cuarter, the two Nations reſemble each other  
more than any others.  
  
The Originals of the two Republicks are ſo much  
alike, that the Hiſtory of one ſeems but a Tran-  
ſcript from that of che other: ſo that every Dutch-  
man inſtructed in the ſubject, muft pronounce the  
American Revolution juſt and neceſſary , or paſs

a Cenſure upon the greateſt Actions of his immor-  
tal Anceſtors: Actions which have been approved  
and applauded by Mankind, and juſtified by the  
Deciſion of Heaven.  
  
But che Circumſtance&#x27;, which perhaps in this  
Age has ſtronger influence than any other in the  
formation: of Friendships between Nations, is the  
great and growing Intereſt of Commerce ; of the  
whole ſyſtem of which chrough the Globe , your  
High-Mightinesſes are too perfect Maſters , for me  
to ſay any thing that is not familiary known. It  
may not however be amiſs io hint, chat the cen-  
tral ſituation of this Country, her extenſive Navi-  
gation, her Poſſeſſions in the Eaſt- and Weſt - In-  
dies, the Intelligence of her Merchants, the Num-  
ber of her Capitaliſts , and the Riches of her Funds,  
render a Connection with her very deſirable to  
America: and on the other Hand, the Abundance  
and Variety of the Productions of America, the  
Materials of Manufactures, Navigation and Com-  
merce ; the vaſt Demand and Conſumption in  
America of the Manufactures of Europe, of Mer-  
chandiſes from the Baltic, and from the Eaſt · In-  
dies, and the fituation of the Dutch Poſſeſſions in  
the Weſt · Indies, cannot admit of a doubt, that  
a Connection with the United States would be uſe-  
ful to this Republic. The English are ſo ſenſible  
of this, that notwithſtanding all their Profeſſions  
of Friendship, they have ever conſidered this Na-  
tion as their Rival in the American Trade; a Sen-  
timent which dictated and maintained their ſevere  
Act of Navigation, as injurious to the Commerce  
and Naval Power of this Country, as it was both  
to the Trade and the Rights of the Coloviſts.  
There is now an Opportunity offered to both, to  
ſhake off this ſhackle for ever. If any Conſiders  
  
As tion  
  
  
(10 N  
  
tion whatever could have induced them to have  
avoided&#x27;a War with your High - Mightinesſes, it  
would have been the Apprehenſion of an Alliance  
between the two Republicks : and it is eaſy to  
foreſee, that nothing will contribute more to obli-  
ge them to a Peace, than ſuch a ConneQion once  
completely formed. It is needleſs to point out  
particularly , what Advantages might be derived to  
the poſſeſſions of the Republick in the Weſt Indies  
from a Trade opened, protected and encouraged  
between them and the Continent of America; or  
what Profits might be made by the Dutch Eaſt-  
India Company, by carrying their Effects directly  
to the American Market; or how much even the  
Trade of the Baltie might be ſecured and extended  
by a free Intercourſe with America, which has  
ever had ſo large a demand, and will have more  
for Hemp, Cordage, Sail-Cloth and other Articles  
of that Commerce : how much the national navi-  
gation would be beneficed by building &amp; purchaſing  
ſhips there: how much the number of ſeamen might  
be increaſed, or how much advantages to both  
Countries, to have their Ports mutually opened to  
their men of war &amp; privateers &amp; their Priſes.  
  
If therefore an Analogy of Religion, Govern-  
ment, Original, Manners, and the moſt extenſive  
and laſting commercial Intereſts, can form a  
Ground and an Invitation to political Connections,  
the Subſcriber flatters himſelf, that in all theſe Par-  
ticulars the Union is ſo obviously natural, that  
there has ſeldom been a more diſtinct Deſignation  
of Providence to any two diftant Nations to unite  
themſelves together.  
  
It is further ſubmitted to the Wisdom and Huma-  
nity of your High -Mightineſſes, whether it is not  
viſibly for the good of Mankind, chat the FO

cability of her purſuits ? whether the late Marine  
Treaty concerning the Rights of neutral Veſſels,  
noble and uſeful as it is, can be eſtablished againſt  
Great - Britzin, who will never adopt it, nor ſubmit  
to it, but from Neceſſity , without the lndependen-  
ce of America? whether the Return of America,  
with her Nurſeries of Seamen and Magazines of  
Materials for Navigation and Commerce, to the  
Domination and Monopoly of Great - Britain, if  
that were practicable, would not put the Poſſeſſions  
of other Nations beyond ſeas wholly in the Power  
of that enormous Empire, which has been long go-  
verned wholly by the feeling of its own Power, at  
leaſt without a proportional attention to Juſtice,  
Humanity, or Decency. When it is obvious and  
certain, that the Americans are not inclined to ſub-  
mit again to the British Government, on the one  
hand, and that the Powers of Europe ought not  
and could not with ſafety conſent to it, if they we-  
re, on the other; why ſhould a Source of Con-  
tention be left open, for future contingencies to  
involye the Nations of Europe in ſtill more blood-

Powers, in making Treaties with a Nation long in

Trade of the Baltick, be any ObjeCtion. This Jea-

rope at ſo cheap a Reste, as it has been and will  
be afforded by Countries round the Baltick. This  
Commerce was ſupported by the English before the  
Revolution with difficulty, and not without large  
Parlimentary Bounties. Of Hemp, Cordage and  
Sail-Cloth there will not probably be a Sufficiency
