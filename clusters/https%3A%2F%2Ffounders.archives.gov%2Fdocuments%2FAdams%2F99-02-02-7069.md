I have received your polite favour of the 3d: of this month. I am afraid that you are engaged in speculations that will never be profitable to you. The age of sculpture &amp; painting have not yet arrived in this country and I hope it will not arrive very soon. Artists have done what they pleased with my face &amp; eyes head &amp; shoulders, stature &amp; figure and they have made of them monsters as fit for exhibition as Harlequin or Punch. They may continue to do so as long as they please. I would not give a sixpence for a picture of Raphael or a statue of Phidias.
