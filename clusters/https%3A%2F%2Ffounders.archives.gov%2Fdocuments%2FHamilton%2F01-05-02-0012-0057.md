[New York, July 8, 1788]  
My Dear Sir  
I felicitate you sincerely on the event in Virginia; but my satisfaction will be allayed, if I discover too much facility in the business of amendment-making. I fear the system will be wounded in some of its vital parts by too general a concurrence in some very injudicious recommendations. I allude more particularly to the power of taxation. The more I consider requisition in any shape the more I am out of humour with it.  
We yesterday passed through the constitution. To day some definitive proposition is to be brought forward; but what we are at a loss to judge. We have good reason to believe that our opponents are not agreed, and this affords some ground of hope. Different things are thought of—Conditions precedent, or previous amendments; Conditions subsequent, or the proposition of amendments upon condition, that if they are not adopted within a limited time, the state shall be at liberty to withdraw from the Union, and lastly recommendatory amendments. In either case constructive declarations will be carried as far as possible. We will go as far as we can in the latter without invalidating the act, and will concur in rational recommendations. The rest for our opponents.  
  
We are informed, There has been a disturbance in the City of Albany on the 4th of July which has occasioned bloodshed. The antifœderalists were the aggressors &amp; the Fœderalists the Victors. Thus stand our accounts at present. We trust however the matter has passed over &amp; tranquillity been restored.

definite proposition is to be brought forward, but  
what, we are at a loss to judge. We have good  
reason to believe that our opponents are not agreed,  
and this affords some ground of hope. Different  
things are tboughtof condition precedent, or pre­  
vious amendments ; condition subsequent, or the  
proposition of amendments, upon condition that if  
tlayaronot adopted within a limited time, the  
State shall be at liberty to withdraw from the

In either case, constructive dtclaration will be

tings of these Conventions?the one at Richmond,  
the other at Poughkeepsie?they kept up an al­  
? most daily correspondence. From this correspond­  
ence we find that the party opposed to ratification  
in New York contended thatthe Constitution would  
too greatly restrict the liberties of the people, and  
they therefore insisted on amendments, either be­  
fore or after ratification. Then follow the annexed  
letters, written just after the result in Virginia, and

Ml Dear Sir : I felicitate you sincerely on the event  
in Virginia, but my satisfaction will he alloyed if 1 dis­  
cover too much facility in the business of atr.eudment­

very injudicious recommendations. I allude more par­  
ticularly to the power of taxation. The more I cons.d­

tion. I’o-day seme definite ptoposilion is to be brought  
forward, hut what, we are at a loss to judge. \Ve have  
good reason to believe that our opponents are not agreed,  
and this aflords some ground ot hope. Diflerent tilings  
are thought ol-—conditions precedent, or previous  
amendments; conditions subsequent,or the proposition  
ot amendments, upon condition that if they are not  
adopted within a limited time,the Stateshali heat liber­  
ty to withdraw twin the Union; and lastly, recommen­  
datory amendments. In either case, constructive de­  
clarations will be carried as far as possible. We will  
go as far as we can in the latter without invalidating the  
act, and will concur in rational recommendations._  
The rest for our opponents. We are informed there has  
been a dibtuibar.ee in the city ot Albany, on the 4th of  
July, which has occasioned blood-shed. The Anti- j  
Federalists were the aggressors, and the Federalists the !

Congress, a correspondence betw een him  
and Mr. Madison, which throws much  
light on this very movement in the New  
York Cunvention, and is most conclusive  
against this doctrine.  
Mr. Hamilton writes to Mr. Madison  
of date July 3, 1789, slating that in the  
New York Convention the opponents of  
the consitlion &quot; had proposed amend­

My Dear Sir: 1 felicitate yon sincerely on the event  
in Virginia, hut my satisfaction will be alloyed il l dis­  
cover too much facility in the business ol amendment  
making. 1 fear the system will be wounded in some,  
of its vital parts by too general n concurrence in  
very injudicious recommendations. 1 .allude more par  
ticularly to tho power of taxation. The more 1 consider  
requisition in any shape, the mo ro I am out of humor  
with it. We yesterday passed through the Constitution.  
To day some definite proposition is to bo brought for­  
ward, hut what we are at a loss to judge We have,  
good reason to bolievo that our opponents are not  
agreed, anti this affords some ground of hope. D fl&#x27;ar­  
ent things are thought of— conditions precedent, or  
previous amendments, conditions subsequent, or the  
proposition of amendment*, upon condition that if tliev  
aro not adopted within a limited time, lire State shall  
bo at liberty to withdraw irom tho Union; and lastly  
recommendatory amendmments. In either case  
constructive DECLARATIONS will bn carried as  
far ns possible. We will go ns far as we can  
in tho latter without invalidating the act, and  
will concur in rational recommendations. Tho rest  
for our opponents. Wo arc informed there lias been  
a dislurbancc in the city ot Albany, on the 4 h of.lu­  
ly, which lias occasioned bloodshed. Tho Anti  
Federalists were tho aggressors, and the Federalists  
tho victors. Thus stand our accounts at present.—  
we trust, however, tho matter has passed over, and  
and tranquillity been restored. Yours affectionately,

My Dear Sir: l felicitate you sincerely on  
the event in Virginia, but my satisfaction will  
be alloyed if 1 discover too much facility in the  
business of amendment making. I fear the  
system will be wounded iu some of its vital  
parts by too general a concurrence in very

particularly to tbe power of taxation. The  
more 1 consider requisition in any shape, the  
more I am out of humor with it. We yester­  
day passed through the Constitution. To-day  
some definite proposition is to be brought for­  
ward, but what we are at a loss to judge. We  
have good reason to believe that our opponents  
are not agreed, and this affords some ground of  
hope. Different things are thought of—conditions  
precedent, or previous amendments, conditions  
subsequent, or the proposition of amendments,  
upon condition that if they are not adopted with­  
in a limited lime, the State shall be at liberty to  
withdraw from the Union; and lastly recom­  
mendatory amendments. In either case con­  
structive declarations will be carried as far as  
possible. We will go as far as we can in the  
latter without invalidating the act, and will  
concur in rational recommendations. The rest  
for our opponents. We are informed there has  
been a disturbance in the city of Albany, on the  
4th of July, which has occasioned bloodshed.  
The Anti-Federalists were the aggressors, and  
the Federalists the victors. Thus stand our ac­  
counts at present. We trust, however, the

JuLY 8th, 1788,  
My Dean Sin: I selicitate you sincere  
ly on the event in Virginia, but my satis  
faction will be alloyed if I discover too  
much facilty in the business of amendment  
making. I fear this subject will be  
wounded in some of its vital parts by too  
general a concurrence in very injudicious  
recommendations. I allude more particu­  
larly to the power of taxation. The more  
I consider reguisition in any shape, the  
more I am out of humor with it. We  
yesterday passed through the Constitution.  
To day some definite proposition is to be  
brought forward, but what we are at a  
loss to judge. We have good reason to  
believe that our opponents are not agreed,  
and this affords some ground of hope.  
Different things are thought of--conditions  
precedent, or previous amendments, condi­  
tions subseguent, or the proposition of a­  
mendments, upon condition that if they  
are not adopted within a limited time, the  
State shall be at liberty to wichdran  
from the Union; and lastly recommenna­  
Tory AMendMents. In either case cox­  
STructive deCLArations will be carried  
as far as possible. We will go as far as  
we can in the latter without invalidating  
the act, and will concur in rational recom­  
mendations. The rest is for our opponents.  
We are informed there has been a distur­  
hance in the city of Albany, on the 4th of  
July, which has occasioned bloodshed.  
The AntiFederalists were the aggressors,  
and the Federalists the victors. Thus
