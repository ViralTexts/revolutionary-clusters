			 Pendulum near the center of motion—had made a great quantity of wheels and that were to be worked by his Pendulum power, and that many persons had conceived that this person had accomplished a very important discovery. But after all, this Man can do nothing with all his labour and  
			 expence—  
I have very often in like manner spent my time, &amp; labour &amp; expence to no rail advantage, except that of amusing myself very innocently. It brings to my mind a sentiment I meet with last evening in reading the Memoirs of a young Lady, her words are, “happiness is a very common plant, an a native of every soil; yet is some skill required in gathering it; for many poisonous weeds look like it, and deceive the unwary to their ruin.” I wish you every happiness that can fall to the lot of man, and believe your Phalosophy Philosophy give you the powers to disreguard the blame or sensure, or even applause of the multitude; an approving mind gives a sourse of perfect content.  
I once more thank you for your desire to serve me and others by the example you desire me to make.

nstant, fervent prayer  
Be, ‘‘ Father, give us light!”  
  
  
  
O, grant to us thy mercy, Lord,  
  
To save us from our loss;  
\ Thy power, and thy quickening word,  
  
With faith to bear the cross,—  
  
O, leave us not, when storms arise,  
Dark clouds heave up in sight;  
  
But guide us in thy way so wise,  
To light, more perfect light.  
  
If we should err, or go astray,  
Or thy least law forget,  
O, point us to the narrow way,  
Thy truth hath wisely set.  
Then, in thy temple, while we&#x27;ve breath,  
We&#x27;ll praise thee with delight;  
That thou hast raised our souls from death,  
To light, effulgent light.
