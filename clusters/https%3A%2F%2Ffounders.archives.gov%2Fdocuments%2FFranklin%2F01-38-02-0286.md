[November 30, 1782]  
Articles agreed upon, by and between Richard Oswald Esquire, the Commissioner of his Britannic Majesty, for treating of Peace with the Commissioners of the United States of America, in behalf of his said Majesty, on the one part; and John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, John Jay, and Henry Laurens, four of the Commissioners of the said States, for treating of Peace with the Commissioner of his said Majesty, on their Behalf, on the other part. To be inserted in, and to constitute the Treaty of Peace, proposed to be concluded, between the Crown of Great Britain, and the said United States; but which Treaty is not to be concluded, untill Terms of a Peace shall be agreed upon, between Great Britain and France; and his Britannic Majesty shall be ready to conclude such Treaty accordingly.  
Whereas reciprocal Advantages, and mutual Convenience are found by Experience, to form the only permanent foundation of Peace and Friendship between States; It is agreed to form the Articles of the proposed Treaty, on such Principles of liberal Equity, and Reciprocity, as that partial Advantages, (those Seeds of Discord!) being excluded, such a beneficial and satisfactory Intercourse between the two Countries, may be establish’d, as to promise and secure to both perpetual Peace and Harmony.

New Hampshire, Massachusetts Bay, Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia, to be free Sovereign and independent States; That he treats with them as such; And for himself, his Heirs and Successors, relinquishes all Claims to the Government, Propriety, and territorial Rights of the same, and every part thereof; and that all Disputes which might arise in future, on the Subject of the Boundaries of the said United States, may be prevented, It is hereby agreed and declared that the following are, and shall be their Boundaries Vizt.

Degree of North Latitude; from thence by a Line due West on said Latitude, untill it strikes the River Iroquois, or Cataraquy; thence along the middle of said River into Lake Ontario; through the middle of said Lake, untill it strikes the Communication by Water between that Lake and Lake Erie; thence along the middle of said Communication into Lake Erie, through the middle of said Lake, untill it arrives at the Water Communication between that Lake and Lake Huron; thence along the middle of said water communication into the Lake Huron; thence through the middle of said Lake to the Water Communication between that Lake and Lake Superior; thence through Lake Superior northward of the Isles Royal &amp; Phelipeaux, to the Long Lake; thence through the middle of said Long Lake, and the water Communication between it and the Lake of the Woods, to the said Lake of the Woods, thence through the said Lake to the most Northwestern point thereof, and from thence on a due west Course to the River Missisippi; thence by a Line to be drawn along the middle of the said River Missisippi, untill it shall intersect the northernmost part of the 31st.

which is here quoted, and the exclusive stipulatien im-  
mediately preceding it, were drawn up, the sources of  
the Mississippi were still supposed to be within the  
British territory; and, at the same time, there was in  
force a treaty between Great Britian and the United  
States declaring that “the navigation of the river Missis-

selves to the eastward of the St. Croix, and higher  
up in the bay, can possibly be considered as such.”  
  
This reasoning is far from being conclusive. In both the  
instances in which the Bay of Fundy is named in connexion  
with the river St. Croix, it is not for the purpose of more de-  
finitely indicating the river intended, but for the purpose of  
indicating a specific point, namely, the mouth of the river. In  
one instance, the Eastern boundary line, is directed to be ‘‘a  
line drawn along the middle of the river St. Croix, from  
its mouth, in the Bay of Fundy.” In the other, it is pro-  
vided, that all islands within twenty leagues of the shore,  
‘¢lying between lines to be drawn due east from the points  
where the aforesaid boundaries, between Nova Scotia on the  
one part, and East Florida on the other, shall respectively  
touch the Bay of Fundy, and the Atlantic Ocean ”’ shall be-  
long to the United States. It is sufficiently evident, that  
the description of a line to be drawn from the mouth of the  
river St. Croix in the Atlantic Ocean, and of the point  
where the said boundary shall touch the Atlantic Ocean,  
would be much less definite and intelligible, than the language  
used above ; for, although the river St. Croix as surely flows  
into the ocean, as it flows into the Bay of Fundy, yet the  
middle of the channel where it enters the ocean could not b

By the first article of the treaty of peace of 1783, his Britannic Maj-  
esty acknowledges the independence of the United States, including,  
with the rest of the States, Massachusetts Bay, and in express terms  
‘“‘ relinquishes all claims to the government, propriety, and territorial  
rights of the same, and every part thereof.” Had the treaty stopped here,  
it would have left no reasonable doubt of the construction which should  
have been given to it. It will hardly be denied, that the territorial

ties have been oonstantly arising from attempts by the  
British ooionies and authorities to prohibit American fish­  
ing vessels from visiting the bays, creeks, and harbors of  
Nova Scotia.  
By the treaty of 1783 Great Britain recognised the right  
of the people of the United State* &quot; to take fish of every  
kind on the Grand Bank, and on all other hanks of New­  
foundland ; also in the Golf of 8t. Lawrence, and all other

settled bays, harbors, and creeks of Nova Scotia, Magda­

main unsettled.&quot;  
Under this liberal provision, the fishermen of our country  
had been in the habit of,oatehing fish on the coasts of the  
British possessions, and curing them upon uninhabited

By the third article of the treaty of peace between  
the United States and Great Britain, in 1783, it was  
provided as follows:That the people of the United  
States shall continue to enjoy, unmolested, the right  
to take fish of any kind on the Grand Bank, and on  
all other banks of Newfoundland; also, in the Gulf  
of St. Lawrence, and af all other places in the sea  
where the inthabitants of both cotntrieg tased at any  
time to fish; that the inhabitants of the United  
States shall have liberty to take fish of any kind on  
such part of the coast of Newfoundland as the British  
shall use (but not to cure and dry them on the  
iland), and also on the coasts, bays and creeks of  
all other of his Britannic Majestys dominion in  
America; and that the American fishermen shall  
have liberty to dry and cure fish in any of the un  
settled bays, harbors and creeks of Nova Scotia,  
Magdalen Islands, and Labrador, so long as the same  
shall remain unsettled, but so soon as the same or  
either of them shall be settled, it shall not be lawful  
for the said fishermen to dry or cure fish at such set  
tement, without a previous agreement for that pur­  
pose with the inhabitants, proprietors or possessors  
of the grounds.&quot;  
It will be seen that by the provisions of this treaty  
the Americans secured the important privileges of  
the shore fishing. It was while we enjoyed these  
privileges that our fisheries attained their highest  
prosperity.  
The British Government regarded these privileges  
as forfeited by the war of 1812. By the Convention  
of 1818, it was agreed &quot;that the inhabitants of the

French considered their transatlantic fisheries  
more valuable than the mines of Mexico. In all  
the old treaties-such as those of 1718, 1763 and  
1782-these fisheries were made leading features  
in the negotiations between France and England.  
and were afterwards, in 1814 and 1815, referred

Paris in the last mentioned years.

after the conquest of Canada, the whole country  
was ceded to England, excepting two small  
islands, St. Pierre’s and Miquelon on the south  
  
side of Newfoundland. Subsequently England  
ceded to France the exclusive right to fish from  
Cape Ray to Cape St. John.  
  
After the United States had gained their in-  
dependence, and the peace of 1783 was con-  
cluded, the treaty between the two countries  
stipulated the right of the Americans “ to take  
fish on the Grand Bank and all other banks of
