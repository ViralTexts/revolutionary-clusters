time, and if we have done Wrong, the Congress will do right, after hearing us, to

y to all our Friends.  
I ought not however to conceal from you that one of my Colleagues is of a very different Opinion from me in  
these Matters. He thinks the French Minister one of the greatest Enemies of our  
Country, that he would have straitned our Boundaries to prevent the Growth of our  
People, contracted our Fishery to obstruct the Increase of our Seamen, &amp; retained  
the Royalists among us to keep us divided; that he privately opposes all our  
Negociations with foreign Courts, and afforded us during the War the Assistance we  
received, only to keep it alive, that we might be so much the more weaken’d by it:  
That to think of Gratitude to France is the greatest of Follies, and that to be  
influenc’d by it, would ruin us. He makes no Secret of his having these Opinions,  
expresses them publickly, sometimes in presence of the English Ministers; and speaks of hundreds of Instances which he could produce in Proof of them,  
none however have yet appear’d to me, unless the Conversations &amp; Letter  
abovementioned are reckoned such. If I were not convinced of the real Inability of  
this Court to furnish the farther Supply’s we asked, I should suspect these Discourses of a Person  
in his Station, might have influenced the Refusal; but I think they have gone no  
farther than to occasion a Suspicion, that we have a considerable Party of  
Antigallicans in America, who are not Tories, and consequently to produce some Doubts  
of the continuance of our Friendship. As such Doubts may hereafter have a bad Effect,  
I think we cannot take too much Care to remove them; and it is therefore I write this  
to put you on your guard, (believing it my Duty, tho’ I know that I hazard by it a  
mortal Enmity) and to caution you respecting the Insinuations of this Gentleman  
against this Court, &amp; the Instances he supposes of their Ill-Will to us, which I  
take to be as imaginary as I know his Fancies to be, that Count de V. and myself are  
continually plotting against him &amp; employing the News Writers of Europe to  
depreciate his Character, &amp;ca. but as Shakespear says, “Trifles light as Air,  
&amp;ca.” I am persuaded however  
that he means well for his Country, is always an honest Man, often a Wise One, but  
sometimes and in some things, absolutely out of his Senses.

ment you make of the Conduct of France in the Peace, and the greater Glory  
acquired by her Moderation than even by her Arms,  
appears to me perfectly just. The  
Character of this Court and Nation seems of late Years to be considerably changed. The  
Ideas of Aggrandisement by Conquest, are out of Fashion; &amp; those of Commerce are  
more enlightened, and more generous than heretofore. We shall soon, I believe, feel  
something of this, in our being admitted to a greater Freedom of Trade with their

the Congress will do right, after hearing us, to

ceeds to square accounts with Adams: &quot;I  
ought not, however, to conceal from you that  
one of my colleagues is of a very different  
opinion from me, in these matters. He thinks  
the French Minister one of the greatest ene­  
mies of our country; that he would have strait­  
ened our boundaries, to prevent the growth of  
our people; contracted our fishery, to obstruct  
the increase of our seamen; and retain the  
royalists among us, to keep us divided; that he  
privately opposes all our negotiations with  
foreign courts, and afforded us, during the war.  
the assistance we received, only to keep it  
alive, that we might be so much the more  
weakened by it; that to think of gratitude to  
France is the greatest of follies, and that to  
be influenced by it would ruin us. He makes  
no secret of his having these opinions, e­  
presses them publicly, sometimes in pres­  
ence of the English Ministers, and speaks  
of hundreds of instances which he could pro­  
duce in proof of them. None, however, have  
yet appeared to me, unless the conversations  
and letter above mentioned are reckoned such.  
If I were not convinced of the real inability of  
this Court to furnish the further supplies we  
asked, I should suspect these discourses of a  
person in his station might have influenced the  
refusal; but I think they have gone no further  
  
than to occasion a suspicion that wo have a  
considerable party of anti-Gallicans in Amer­  
ica who are not Tories, and, consequently, to  
produce some doubts of the continuance of  
our friendship. As such doubts may here­  
after have a bad effect, I think we cannot  
take too much care to remove them; and  
it is therefore I write this, to put you on  
your guard (believing it my duty, though I  
know I hazard by it a mortal enmity), and to  
caution you respecting the insinuations of this  
gentleman against this Court, and the instances  
he supposes of their ill will to us, which I take  
to be as imaginary as I know his fancies to be.  
that Count de Vergennes and myself are con­  
tinually plotting against him and employing  
the news writers of tEurope to depreciate his  
character. &amp;o. But, as Shakespeare says,  
&quot;Trifles light as air,&quot; Ac. I am persuaded, how­  
ever, that he means well to his country, is al­  
ways an honest man, often a wise one, but  
sometimes and in some things absolutely out of  
his senses.&quot;
