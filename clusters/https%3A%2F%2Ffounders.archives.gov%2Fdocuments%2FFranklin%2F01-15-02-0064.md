]  
I have met with much invective in the papers for these two years past, against the hard-heartedness of the rich, and much complaint of the great oppressions suffered in this country by the labouring poor. Will you admit a word or two on the other side of the question? I do not propose to be an advocate for oppression, or oppressors. But when I see that the poor are by such writings exasperated against the rich, and excited to insurrections, by which much mischief is done, and some forfeit their lives,  I could wish the true state of things were better understood, the poor not made by these busy writers more uneasy and unhappy than their situation subjects them to be, and the nation not brought into disrepute among foreigners by public groundless accusations of ourselves, as if the rich in England had no compassion for the poor, and Englishmen wanted common humanity.  
In justice then to this country, give me leave to remark, that the condition of the poor here is by far the best in Europe, for that, except in England and her American colonies, there is not in any country of the known world, not even in Scotland or Ireland, a provision by law to enforce a support of the poor. Everywhere else necessity reduces to beggary. This law was not made by the poor. The legislators were men of fortune. By that act they voluntarily subjected their own estates, and the estates of all others, to the payment of a tax for the maintenance of the poor, incumbering those estates with a kind of rent charge for that purpose, whereby the poor are vested with an inheritance, as it were, in all the estates of the rich. I wish they were benefited by this generous provision in any degree equal to the good intention with which it was made, and is continued: But I fear the giving mankind a dependance on any thing for support in age or sickness, besides industry and frugality during youth and health, tends to flatter our natural indolence, to encourage idleness and prodigality, and thereby to promote and increase poverty, the very evil it was intended to cure; thus multiplying beggars, instead of diminishing them.  
Besides this tax, which the rich in England have subjected themselves to in behalf of the poor, amounting in some places to five or six shillings in the pound of the annual income, they have, by donations and subscriptions, erected numerous schools in various parts of the kingdom, for educating gratis the children of the poor in reading and writing, and in many of those schools the children are also fed and cloathed. They have erected hospitals, at an immense expence, for the reception and cure of the sick, the lame, the wounded, and the insane poor, for lying-in women, and deserted children. They are also continually contributing towards making up losses occasioned by fire, by storms, or by floods, and to relieve the poor in severe seasons of frost, in times of scarcity, &amp;c. in which benevolent and charitable contributions no nation exceeds us. Surely there is some gratitude due for so many instances of goodness!  
Add to this, all the laws made to discourage foreign manufactures, by laying heavy duties on them, or totally prohibiting them, whereby the rich are obliged to pay much higher prices for what they wear and consume, than if the trade was open: These are so many laws for the support of our labouring poor, made by the rich, and continued at their expence; all the difference of price between our own and foreign commodities, being so much given by our rich to our poor; who would indeed be enabled by it to get by degrees above poverty, if they did not, as too generally they do, consider every encrease of wages, only as something that enables them to drink more and work less; so that their distress in sickness, age, or times of scarcity, continues to be the same as if such laws had never been made in their favour.  
Much malignant censure have some writers bestowed upon the rich for their luxury and expensive living, while the poor are starving, &amp;c. not considering that what the rich expend, the labouring poor receive in payment for their labour. It may seem a paradox if I should assert, that our labouring poor do in every year receive the whole revenue of the nation; I mean not only the public revenue, but also the revenue, or clear income, of all private estates, or a sum equivalent to the whole. In support of this position I reason thus. The rich do not work for one another. Their habitations, furniture, cloathing, carriages, food, ornaments, and every thing in short that they, or their families use and consume, is the work or produce of the labouring poor, who are, and must be continually, paid for their labour in producing the same. In these payments the revenues of private estates are expended, for most people live up to their incomes. In cloathing and provision for troops, in arms, ammunition, ships, tents, carriages, &amp;c. &amp;c. (every particular the produce of labour) much of the publick revenue is expended. The pay of officers civil and military, and of the private soldiers and sailors, requires the rest; and they spend that also in paying for what is produced by the labouring poor. I allow that some estates may increase by the owners spending less than their income; but then I conceive that other estates do at the same time diminish, by the owner’s spending more than their income, so that when the enriched want to buy more land, they easily find lands in the hands of the impoverished, whose necessities oblige them to sell; and thus this difference is equalled. I allow also, that part of the expence of the rich is in foreign produce or manufactures, for producing which the labouring poor of other nations must be paid; but then I say, that we must first pay our own labouring poor for an equal quantity of our manufactures or produce, to exchange for those foreign productions, or we must pay for them in money, which money, not being the natural produce of our country, must first be purchased from abroad, by sending out its value in the produce or manufactures of this country, for which manufactures our labouring poor are to be paid. And indeed if we did not export more than we import, we could have no money at all. I allow farther, that there are middle men, who make a profit, and even get estates, by purchasing the labour of the poor and selling it at advanced prices to the rich; but then they cannot enjoy that profit or the incomes of estates, but by spending them and employing and paying our laboring poor, in some shape or other, for the products of industry. Even beggars, pensioners, hospitals, and all that are supported by charity, spend their incomes in the same manner. So that finally, as I said at first, our labouring poor receive annually the whole of the clear revenues of the nation, and from us they can have no more.  
If it be said that their wages are too low, and that they ought to be better paid for their labour, I heartily wish any means could be fallen upon to do it, consistent with their interest and happiness; but as the cheapness of other things is owing to the plenty of those things, so the cheapness of labour is, in most cases, owing to the multitude of labourers, and to their underworking one another in order to obtain employment. How is this to be remedied? A law might be made to raise their wages; but if our manufactures are too dear, they will not vend abroad, and all that part of employment will fail, unless by fighting and conquering we compel other nations to buy our goods, whether they will or no, which some have been mad enough at times to propose. Among ourselves, unless we give our working people less employment, how can we, for what they do, pay them higher than we do? Out of what fund is the additional price of labour to be paid, when all our present incomes are, as it were, mortgaged to them? Should they get higher wages, would that make them less poor, if in consequence they worked fewer days of the week proportionably? I have said a law might be made to raise their wages; but I doubt much whether it could be executed to any purpose, unless another law, now indeed almost obsolete, could at the same time be revived and enforced; a law, I mean, that many have often heard and repeated, but few have ever duly considered. Six days shalt thou labour. This is as positive a part of the commandment as that which says, the Seventh day thou shalt rest. But we remember well to observe the indulgent part, and never think of the other. St. Monday is generally as duly kept by our working people as Sunday; the only difference is, that, instead of employing their time, cheaply, at church, they are wasting it expensively at the alehouse. I am, Sir, &amp;c.

SIR,  
  
Have met with much inveétive in  
  
the papers for thefe two years paft,  
againft the hard-heartednefs of the rich,  
and much complaint of the great op-  
preffions fuffered in this country by the  
labouring poor. Will you admit a  
word or two on the other fide of the  
queftion ? I do not propofe to be an ad-  
vocate for oppreffion, or oppreffors.  
But when I fee that the poor are by fuch  
writings exafperated againft the rich,  
and excited to infurreétions, by which  
much mifchief is done, and fome for-  
feit their lives, I could wifh the true  
ftate of things were better underftooa,  
the poor not made by thefe bufy wri-  
ters more uneafy and unhappy tkan their  
fituation fubjeéts them to be, and the  
nation not brought into difrepute among  
foreigners by public groundlefs accu-  
fations of ourfelves, as if the sich in  
England had no compaffion for the poor,  
and Englifhmen wanted common hu-  
manity.  
  
In jultice then to this country, give  
me leave to remark, that the condition  
of the poor here is by far the beft in  
Europe, for that, except in England and  
her American colonies, there 1s not in  
any country of the known world, not  
even in Scotland or Ireland, a provifion  
by law to enforce a fupport of the poor.  
Every where elfe neceflity reduces to  
beggary. ‘This law was not made by  
the poor. The legiflators were men of  
fortune. By that aét they voluntarily  
fubje&amp;ted their own ettates, and the ef-  
tates of all others, to the payment of a  
tax for the maintenance otf the povr,  
incumbering thofe eftates with a kind of  
rent charge for that purpefe, whereby  
the poor are vefted with an inheritance,  
as it were, in all the eftates of the rich.  
I with they were benefited by this ge-  
nerous provifion in any degree equal to  
the good intention with which it was  
made, and is continued: But F fear the  
giving mankind a dependance on any  
tuing for fupport in age or ficknefs, be-  
jides induftry and frugality during youth  
and health, tends to flatter our natural  
indolence, to encourage idlenefs and  
prodigality, and thereby to promote and

Hardbeartednefs to the Poor confidered.  
  
increafe poverty, the very evil it was in-  
tended to cure; thus multiplying beg-  
gars, infead of diminifhing them.  
  
Befides this tax, which the rich in  
England have fubjeéted themfelves to  
in behalf of the poor, amounting in  
fome places to five or fix fhillings in the  
pound of the annual income, they  
have, by donations and fubfcriptions,  
erected numerous fchools in various parts  
of the kingdom, for educating gratis  
the children of the poor in reading and  
writing, and in many of thofe tchools  
the children are alfo fed and cloathed.  
They have ereéted hofpitals, at an im-  
menfe expence, for the reception and  
cure of the fick, the lame, the wound-  
ed, and the infane poor, for lying-in  
women, and deierted children. They  
are alfo continually contributing to-  
wards making up loffes occafioned by.  
fire, by ftorms, or by floods, and to re-  
lieve the poor in fevere feafons of frot,  
in times of fcarcity, &amp;c. in which be-  
nevolent and charitable contributions  
no nation exceeds us. Surely there  
is fome gratitude due for fo many in-  
ftances of goodnefs !  
  
Add to this, al] the laws made to  
difcvurage foreign manufaétures, by  
laying heavy duties on them, or totally  
prohibiting them, whereby the rich are  
obliged to pay much higher prices for  
what they wear and confume, than if  
the trade was open: Theie are fo many  
laws for the fupport of our labouring  
poor, made by the rich, and continued  
at their expence; all the difference of  
price between our own and foreign com-  
modities, being fo much given by our  
rich to our poor; who would indeed he  
enabled by it to get by degrees above  
poverty, if they did not, as too general-  
ly they do, confider every increafe of  
wages: only as fomething that enables  
them to drink more and work lefs; {fo  
that their diftrefs in fickneis, age, or  
times of f{carcity, continues to te the  
fame as if fuch laws had never been  
made in their favour.  
  
Much malignant cenfure have fome  
writers bettowed upon the rich for their  
luxury and expentive living, while the  
poor are ftarving, &amp;c. not confidering  
that what the rich expend, the labouring  
poor receive in payment for their iabour.  
It may feem a paradox if I fhould af-  
fert, that our labouring poor do in every  
year receive the whole revenue of the  
nation; 1 mean not only the public re-  
venue, but alfo the revenue, or clear  
income, of all private eftates, or a fun  
equivalent to the whole. In fupport of  
this pofition I reafon thus. The rich  
  
do  
  
  
  
  
  
IN OPINED  
  
peers  
  
  
  
  
  
Tenderne/s of the Laws in their favour.  
  
do not work for one another. Their  
habitations, furniture, cloathing, car-  
riages, food, ornaments, and every  
thing in fhort that they, or their fami-  
lies ufe and confume, is the work or  
produce of the labouring poor, who  
are, and muft be, continually paid for  
their labour in producing the fame. In  
thefe payments the revenues of private  
eftates are expended, for moft people  
live up to their incomes. In cloathing  
and provifion for troops, in arms, am-  
munition, fhips, tents, carriages, &amp;e.  
&amp;c. (every particular the produce of  
labour) much of the publick revenue  
is expended. The pay of officers civil  
and military, and of the private {fol-  
diers and failors, requires the reft; and  
they {pend that alfo in paying for what  
is produced by the labouring poor. I  
allow that fome eftates may increafe by  
the owners {pending lefs than their in-  
come; but then I conceive that other  
eftates do at the fame time diminifh, by  
the owner’s {pending more than their  
income, fo that when the enriched want  
to buy more land, they eafily find lands  
in the hands of the impoverifhed, whofe  
neceffities oblige them to fell; ang thus  
this difference is equalled. I allow  
alfo, that part of the expence of the  
rich is in foreign produce or manufac-  
tures, for producing which the labour-  
ing poor of other nations muft be paid ;  
but then I fay, that we muft firit pay  
our own labouring poor for an equal  
quantity of our manufaétures or pro-  
duce, to exchange for thofe fereign pro-  
duétions, or we muft pay for them in  
money, which msney, not being the na-  
tural produce of our country, mutt firft  
be purchafed from abroad, by fending  
outits value in the produce or manu-  
fa&amp;tures of this country, for which ma-  
nufaétures our labouring poor are to be  
paid. And indeed if we did not export  
more than we import, we could have no  
money at all. I allow farther, that  
there are middle men, who make a  
profit, and even get eftates, by purchaf-  
ing the labour of the poor and felling it  
at advanced prices to the rich; but  
then they cannot enjoy that profit or  
the incomes of eftates, but by fpend-  
ing them in employing and paying  
our labouring poor, in fome fhape or  
other, for the produéts of induftry—  
Even beggars, penfioners, hofpitals, and  
all that are fupported by charity, {pend  
their incomes in the fame manner. So  
that finally, as I faid at firft, our /abour-  
ing poor receive annually the whole of  
  
157  
the clear revenues of the nation, and  
from us they can have no more.  
  
If it be faid that their wages are too  
low, and that they ought to be better  
paid for their labour, I heartily with  
any means could be fallen upon to da  
it, confiftent with their intereft and hap-  
pinefs; but as the cheapnefS of other  
things is owing to the plenty of thofe  
things, fo the cheapnefs of labour is,  
in moft cafes, owing to the multitude of  
labourers, and to their underworking  
one another in order to obtain employ-  
ment. How is this to be remedied?  
A law might be made to raife their wa-  
ges; but if our manufactures are too  
dear, they will not vend abroad, and  
all that part of empleyment will fail,  
unlefs by fighting and conquering we  
compel other nations to buy our goods,  
whether they will or no, which fome  
have been mad enough at times to pro-  
pofe. Among ourfelves, unlefs we give  
our working people lefs employment,  
how can we, for what they do, pay them  
higher than we do? Out of what fund  
is the additional price of labour to be  
paid, when all our prefent incomes are,  
as it were, mortgaged to them? Should  
they get higher wages, would that make  
them lefs poor, if in confequence they  
worked fewer days of the week propor-  
tionably? I have faid alaw might be  
made to raife their wages; but I doubt  
much whether it could be executed to  
any purpofe, unlefs another law, now  
indeed almoft obfolete, could at the fame  
time be revived and enforced; a law, E  
mean, that many have often heard and  
repeated, but few have ever duly con-  
fidered. SIX days fhalt thou labour.  
‘This is as pofitive a part of the com-  
mandment as that which fays, the SE-  
VENTH day thou fhalt reff; but we re-  
member well to obferve the indulgent  
part, and never think of the other. St  
Monday is generally as duly kept by  
our working people as Sunday; the  
only difference is, that, inftead of em-  
ploying their time, cheaply, at church,  
they are wafting it expenfively at the  
  
alehoufe. I am, Sir, &amp;e.

those who evade their fair and legal share of such contribu-  
tions only add so much to the impositions on the rest of the  
community.  
  
In one of his papers on general politics, Dr. F. makes  
an assertion which, at first sight, appears very paradoxical ;  
that ‘our labouring poor do in every year receive the whole  
revenue of the nation.’ The ingenious writer thus supports  
this extraordinary position: (p. 134.)  
  
¢ The rich do not work for one another. Their habitations, fur-  
niture, clothing, carriages, food, ornaments, and every thing, in  
short, that they or their families use and consume, is the work or  
produce of the labouring poor, who are and must be continually  
paid for their labour in producing the same. In these payments  
the revenues of private estates are expended, for most people live  
up to ‘their incomes. In clothing and provision for troops, in  
arms, ammunition, ships, tents, carriages, &amp;c. &amp;c. (every parti-  
cular the produce of labour,) much of the public revenue is  
expended. The pay of officers civil and military, and of the  
private soldiers and sailors, requires the rest ; and they spend that  
also in paying for what is produced by the labouring poor. ° I  
allow that some estates may increase by the owners spending less  
than their income ; but then I conceive that other estates do, at  
the same time, diminish by the owners spending more than their  
income, so that when the enriched want to buy more land, they  
easily find lands in the hands of the impoverished whose necessities  
oblige them to sell ; and thus this difference is equalled. I allow  
also that part of the expense of the rich is in foreign preduce or  
manufactures, for producing which the labouring poor of ether  
nations must be paid ; but then I say we must first pay our own  
labouring poor for an equal quantity of our manufactures or pro-  
duce to exchange for those foreign productions. or we must pay  
for them in money, which money not being the natural produce of  
our country, must first be purchased from abroad, by sending out  
its value in the produce or mianufactures of this country, for which  
manufactures our labouring poor are to be paid. And -indeed it

THE WEEKLY: ENTERTAINER. 55?  
SINGULAR OPINION OF DR. B. FRANKLIN.  
  
TENMUF rich do not work for one ancther.. Their habitations, fur-  
niture, clothing, carriages, food, ornaments, and every thing, in  
short, that they or their families use and consume, is the work or  
produce of the labouring poor, who are and must be continually paid  
for their labour in producing the same. In these payments the  
revenues of private estates are expended, for most people live up to  
their incomes. In clothing and provision for troops, in arms, ammuni-  
tion, ships, tents, carriages, &amp;c. &amp;c. every particular the produce ef  
labour, much of the public revenue is expended. The pay of officers  
civil and military, and of the private soldiers and sailors, requires  
the rest ; and they spend that also in paying for what is produced  
by the labouring poor. I allow that some estates may increase by  
the owners spending less than their income ; but. then I conceive.  
that other estates do, at the same time, diminish by the owners  
spending more than their income, so that when the enriched want to  
buy more land, they easily find lands in the hands of the impoverished  
whose necessities oblige them to sell ; and thus this diilerence. is  
equalled. I allow also that part of the expense of the tich is ia  
forcign produce or manufactures, for producing which the labouring  
poor of other nations must be paid, but when I say we must first  
pay our own labouring poor for an equal quantity of our manufactures  
or produce, to exchange for those foreign production,or we must pay  
for them in money, which money not being the. natural produce of  
our country, must first be purchased from abroad, by sending out  
its value in the produce or manufactures of this country, for which  
manufactures our labouring poor are to be paid.. Aud indeed if we  
did not export more than we import, we could have no money at all.  
I allow, farther, that there are middle men who make a profit, and  
even get estates by purchasing the labour of the poor, and selling it  
at advanced prices to the rich ; but then they cannot enjoy that  
profit or the incomes of estates, but by spending them in employing  
and paying our labouring poor in some shape or other for the pro-  
ducts of industry. Fen beggars, pensioners, hospitals, and all that  
are supported by charity, spend their incomes in the same manner.  
So that finally, our labouring poor receive annually the whole of t  
clear revenues of the nation, and from us they can have no more.’

ishing the pay of the workmen. A good workman spoils  
fewer tools, wastes less material, and works faster than one  
of inferior skill; and thus the profits of the manufacturer are  
increased still more.”  
  
It would be idle to look for a scientific law of wages in  
Franklin’s writings. Franklin very seldom formulated laws.  
In the article Ox the Laboring Poor’ he stated incidentally  
that “ as the cheapness of other things is owing to the plenty  
of those things, so the cheapness of labor is in most cases  
owing to the multitude of laborers and to their underwork-  
ing one another in order to obtain employment.” It is in  
this article also that Franklin made the oft-quoted statement  
that “our laboring poor receive annually the whole of the  
clear revenues of the nation.”
