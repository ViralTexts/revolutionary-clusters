Song[c. 1742]  
  
Of their Chloes and Phillisses Poets may prate  
I sing my plain Country Joan  
Now twelve Years my Wife, still the Joy of my Life  
Blest Day that I made her my own,  
My dear Friends  
Blest Day that I made her my own.  
  
  
2  
Not a Word of her Face, her Shape, or her Eyes,  
Of Flames or of Darts shall you hear;  
Tho’ I Beauty admire ’tis Virtue I prize,  
That fades not in seventy Years,  
My dear Friends  
  
  
3  
In Health a Companion delightfull and dear,  
Still easy, engaging, and Free,  
In Sickness no less than the faithfullest Nurse  
As tender as tender can be,  
My dear Friends  
  
  
4  
In Peace and good Order, my Houshold she keeps  
Right Careful to save what I gain  
Yet chearfully spends, and smiles on the Friends  
I’ve the Pleasures to entertain  
My dear Friends  
  
  
  
5  
She defends my good Name ever where I’m to blame,  
Friend firmer was ne’er to Man giv’n,  
Her compassionate Breast, feels for all the Distrest,  
Which draws down the Blessing from Heav’n,  
My dear Friends  
  
  
6  
Am I laden with Care, she takes off a large Share,  
That the Burthen ne’er makes [me] to reel,  
Does good Fortune arrive, the Joy of my Wife,  
Quite doubles the Pleasures I feel,  
My dear Friends  
  
  
7  
In Raptures the giddy Rake talks of his Fair,  
Enjoyment shall make him Despise,  
I speak my cool sence, that long Experience,  
And Enjoyment have chang’d in no wise,  
My dear Friends  
  
  
[Some Faults we have all, and so may my Joan,  
But then they’re exceedingly small;  
And now I’m us’d to ’em, they’re just like my own,  
I scarcely can see ’em at all,  
My dear Friends,  
I scarcely can see them at all.]  
  
  
8  
Were the fairest young Princess, with Million in Purse  
To be had in Exchange for my Joan,  
She could not be a better Wife, mought be a Worse,  
So I’d stick to my Joggy alone  
My dear F

In health a companion, delightful and just,  
Sull easy, engaging and free ;  
  
In sickness no less than the tenderest nurse,  
She ’s teader as tender can he.  
  
She defends my geod name, e’en when I’ m to

Friend firmer to man ne&#x27;er was given ;  
Her compassionate breast feels for all the distress’d  
Which draws down new blessings from heaven.  
  
Small faults we have all — and so may my Joao,  
3ut then they ’re exceedingly small ;  
  
And now I&#x27;m used to them, they ’re so like my own

Was the fairest young princess, with millions in |

To ‘a had in exchange for my Joan,  
She could not he a better, she might he a worse,  
So I ‘deen be content with my orn.

wife.  
MY PLAIN COUNTRY JOAN; A SONG.  
  
Of their Chloes and Phyllises poets may prate,  
I sing my plain country Joan,  
  
These twelve years my wife, still the joy of my life,  
Blest day that I made her my own.

Some faults have we all, and so has my Joan,  
But then they ’re exceedingly small,  
And, now I’m grown used to them, so like my  
own  
I scarcely can see them at all.  
  
Were the finest young princess, with millions in

To be had in exchange for my Joan,  
I could not get better wife, might get a worse,  
So I&#x27;ll stick to my dearest old Joan.
