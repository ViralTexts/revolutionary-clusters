Dr Sir  
Aug. 4 1822  
  
I recd. some days ago your letter of June 30, and the printed Circular to which it refers.  
The liberal appropriations made by the Legislature of Kentucky for a general System of Education can not be too much applauded. A popular Government, without popular information, or the means of acquiring it, is but a prologue to a Farce or a Tragedy; or perhaps both. Knowlege will for ever govern ignorance: and a people who mean to be their own Governours, must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives.  
I have always felt a more than ordinary interest in the destinies of Kentucky. Among her earliest settlers were some of my particular friends and neighbours. And I was myself among the foremost advocates for submitting to the will of the “District,” the question and the time of its becoming a separate member of the American family. Its rapid growth &amp; signal prosperity in this character have aforded me much pleasure; which is not a little enhanced by the enlightened patriotism which is now providing for the State a plan of Education embracing every class of Citizens, and every grade &amp; department of knowlege. No error is more certain than the one proceeding from a hasty &amp; superficial view of the subject, that the people at large have no interest in the establishment of Academies, Colleges, and Universities, where a few only, and those not of the poorer classes can obtain for their sons the advantages of superior education. It is thought to be unjust that all should be taxed for the benefit of a part, and that too the part least needing it.  
If provision were not made at the same time for every part, the objection would be a natural one. But, besides the consideration when the higher Seminaries belong to a plan of general education, that it is better for the poorer classes to have the aid of the richer by a general tax on property, than that every parent should provide at his own expence for the education of his children, it is certain that every Class is interested in establishments which give to the human mind its highest improvements, and to every Country its truest and most durable celebrity.  
Learned Institutions ought to be favorite objects with every free people. They throw that light over the public mind which is the best security against crafty &amp; dangerous encroachments on the public liberty. They are nurseries of skilful Teachers for the schools distributed throughout the Community. They are themselves Schools for the particular talents required for some of the public Trusts, on the able execution of which the welfare of the people depends. They multiply the educated individuals from among whom the people may elect a due portion of their public  
  
agents of every description; more especially of those who are to frame the laws; by the perspicuity, the consistency, and the stability, as well as by the just &amp; equal spirit of which the great social purposes are to be answered.  
Without such Institutions, the more costly of which can scarcely be provided by individual means, none but the few whose wealth enables them to support their sons abroad, can give them the fullest education; and in proportion as this is done, the influence is monopolized which superior information every where possesses. At cheaper &amp; nearer seats of Learning parents with slender incomes may place their sons in a course of Education putting them on a level with the sons of the richest, Whilst those who are without property, or with but little, must be peculiarly interested in a System which unites with the more Learned Institutions, a provision for diffusing through the entire Society the education needed for the common purposes of life. A System comprizing the Learned Institutions may be still further recommended to the more indigent class of Citizens by such an arrangement as was reported to the General Assembly of Virginia in the year 1779, by a Committee  
*the report was made by Mr. Jefferson, Mr. Pendleton &amp; Mr. Wythe  
appointed to revise the laws in order to adapt them to the genius of Republican Government. It made a part of a “bill for the more general diffusion of knowledge” that wherever a youth was ascertained to possess talents meriting an education which his parent could not afford, he should be carried forward at the public expence from Seminary to Seminary, to the completion of his studies at the highest.  
But why should it be necessary in this case, to distinguish the Society into classes according to their property? When it is considered that the establishment and endowment of Academies, Colleges, and Universities are a provision not merely for the existing generation, but for succeeding ones also; that in Governments like ours a constant rotation of property results from the free scope to industry, and from the laws of inheritance, and when it is considered moreover, how much of the exertions and privations of all are meant not for themselves, but for their posterity, there can be little ground for objections from any class, to plans of which every class must have its turn of benefits. The rich man when contributing to a permanent plan for the education of the poor, ought to reflect that he is providing for that of his own descendants; and the poor man who concurs in a provision for those who are not poor that at no distant day it may be enjoyed by descendants from himself. It does not require a long life to witness these vicisitudes of fortune.  
It is among the happy peculiar[it]ies of our Union, that the States composing it derive from their relations to each other and to the whole, a salutary emulation, without the enmity involved in competitions among States alien to each other. This emulation, we may perceive, is not without its  
  
influence in several important respects; and in none ought it to be more felt than in the merit of diffusing the light and the advantages of public Instruction. In the example therefore which Kentucky is presenting, she not only consults her own welfare, but is giving an impulse to any of her Sisters who may be behind her in the noble career.  
Throughout the Civilized World, nations are courting the praise of fostering Science and the useful arts, and are opening their eyes to the principles and the blessings of Representative Government. The American people owe it to themselves, and to the cause of free Government, to prove by their establishments for the advancement and diffusion of Knowlege, that their political Institutions, which are attracting observation from every quarter, and are respected as Models, by the new-born States in our own Hemisphere, are as favorable to the intellectual and moral improvement of Man, as they are conformable to his individual &amp; social Rights. What spectacle can be more edifying or more seasonable, than that of Liberty &amp; Learning, each leaning on the other for their mutual &amp; surest support?  
The Committee, of which your name is the first, have taken a very judicious course in endeavouring to avail Kentucky of the experience of elder States, in modifying her Schools. I inclose extracts from the laws of Virginia on that subject; though I presume they will give little aid; the less as they have as yet been imperfectly carried into execution. The States where such Systems have been long in operation will furnish much better answers to many of the enquiries stated in your Circular. But after all, such is the diversity of local circumstances, more particularly as the population varies in density &amp; sparseness, that the details suited to some may be little so to others. As the population however, is becoming less &amp; less sparse, and it will be well in laying the foundation of a good System, to have a view to this progressive change, much attention seems due to examples in the Eastern States, where the people are most compact, &amp; where there has been the longest experience in plans of popular education.  
I know not that I can offer on the occasion any suggestions not likely to occur to the Committee. Were I to hazard one, it would be in favour of adding to Reading—Writing—&amp; Arithmetic—to which the instruction of the poor is commonly limited, some knowledge of Geography; such as can easily be conveyed by a Globe &amp; Maps, and a concise Geographical Grammar. And how easily &amp; quickly might a general idea even be conveyed of the Solar System, by the aid of a Planetarium of the Cheapest Construction. No information seems better calculated to expand the mind and gratify curiosity than what would thus be imparted. This is especially the case, with what relates to the Globe we inhabit, the Nations among which it is divided, and the characters and customs which distinguish them. An acquaintance with foreign Countries in this mode, has a kindred effect  
  
with that of seeing them as travellers, which never fails, in uncorrupted minds, to weaken local prejudices, and enlarge the sphere of benevolent feelings. A knowledge of the Globe &amp; its various inhabitants, however slight, might moreover create a taste for Books of Travels and Voyages; out of which might grow a general taste for History, an inexhaustible fund of entertainment &amp; instruction. Any reading, not of a vicious species, must be a good substitute for the amusements too apt to fill up the leisure of the labouring classes.  
I feel myself much obliged Sir by your expressions of personal kindness, and pray you to accept a return of my good wishes, with assurances of my great esteem &amp; respect  
  
J.M.  
  
  
P.S. On reflection I omit the extracts from the laws of Virga. which it is probable may be within your reach at home. Should it be otherwise, and you think them worth the transmission by mail, the omission shall be supplied.

&#x27; Montpdur Aug.L, lVU. ,  
Dear Sir, I received some  
days ago, vour letter of JuneOjh,  
and the printed circular to, which  
it refers. &#x27; . .  
The liberal appropriations  
made by the legislature of Kentuc­  
ky for a general system of .educa­  
tion, cannot be too much applaud­  
ed. A popular governmentvwithout  
popular information, or the means  
of a quiring it, is but a prologue  
to a farce or a tragedy, or perhaps  
both. Knowledge will ever gov­  
ern ignorance ; and a people who  
mean to be their own governors  
must arm themselves with the pow­  
er which luibwledge gives.  
I have always felt a more than  
ordinary interest in the destinies  
of Kentucky. Among herearlie t  
settlers were some of my particu­  
lar friends and neighbors ; and  
I was myself among the foremost  
advocates for submitting to the  
Will of the l; District, the question  
and the time of its becoming a  
separate member of the American  
family Its rapid growth and sig  
nal prosperity in this character  
have afforded me much pleasure,  
which is not a little enhanced by  
the, enlightened patriotigun which  
is how ptoviding for the State a  
plan of education embracing  
every class of citixens, and, every  
grde and department of knowl­  
edge. No error is more certain  
than the one proceeding from a  
hasty and superficial view of the  
subject, that t &#x27;e establishment of  
Academic Colleges and Univer­  
sities, wh-re a few only, and those  
not of the poorer classes, can ob­  
tain for their sons the advantage  
of superior education It Is tboght  
to bg unjust that all should be  
taxed for the benefit of a part, nd  
that too the part ieast needing it.  
If provisions were not made, at  
the same time, for every part, the  
objection would be a natural one;  
but, besides the consideration,  
when the higher seminaries belong  
to a &#x27;plan of general education,  
that it is better for the poorer  
classes .oh:ive the aid of the rich­  
er by a general tax on property  
than that every parent should  
provide at hi own expense for the  
education of his children, it is cer­  
tain tha every class is interested  
in establishments which give to  
the human mind its highest im­  
provements, and to every coun­  
try its truest and most -durable  
celebrity.  
Learned institutions ought to  
be favorite objects which every

is the best security igain&amp;t crafty  
and dangerous encroachments ou

the Schools disfibu Jed throughout  
the community. They are them­  
selves schools for the particular  
talents , required for some of tht  
puoitc trusts, on me aoie execu

people dejepds. Tney multiply  
the educated individuals from a­  
mong whom the people may ele t  
a due portion ot their public a­  
gents of every description, more.  
especially, of those who tire to  
frame the laws, by the perspicuity: J  
tne consistenfcy and the stability  
as welf as by the just and equ 1  
spirit o wliict), the, great social  
purposes are to be answered.  
WitKout .such institations, the  
.more costly of which can scarcely  
none but the few whose wealth  
enables them to support theirsons  
abroad, can give them the fullest  
education ; and in proportion as  
this is done, the &#x27;influence is : mo­

Mont^lier, Aug. 4, 182 -,  
Dear Sir ,—I received some days ago, yourl-7.  
of June SOtli, and the printed circular t?  
refers.  
The liberal appropriations made hy the legisl  
ol Kentucky, for a general system of etlucài  
cannot be too much applauded. A popular Pov  
ment without popular information, or the meati&quot;!i  
acquiring it, is but a prologue to a farce or a traiv  
or perhaps both. Knowledge will ever govern |  
norance; and a people who mean to be tlteiroM  
governors, must arm themselves with fl 1e &quot;  
which knowledge gives.  
1 have always felt a more than ordinary  
in the destinies of Kentucky. Among herc at |J  
settlers were some of my particular friends J  
neighbors ; and I was myself among the fo rei J  
advocates for submitting to the will of the --U t  
trict,&quot; the question and the time of its becoming  
parate mendier of the American family. i ls J  
growth and signal prosperity in this character I*,  
adoi ded me much pleasure, which is not alittle&#x27;en&#x27;  
hancetl by the enlightened patriotism which is r v  
pro» .ding for the State a plan of education emir,  
cing every class of citizens, and every gradatj  
department of knowledge. No error is more ett­  
tain, than the one proceeding Iront a hasty amis&#x27;,,  
perficial view of the subject, that the people at l It »,  
luve no nuere-t in the establishment of Aradeirtt,  
Colleges and Universities, where a lew only,,&#x27;,&#x27;  
those not of the poorer t lasses, can obtain for their  
sons the advantage of superior education, lu  
thought to be unjust that all should be taxed for tb e  
beneli: ol a part, and that too the part least neediw  
it It provisions were not made, at the same timt  
lor every part, the objection would he a natural«*-&#x27;  
but, besides the consideration, when the highet  
seminaries belong tu a plan ot general education,  
that it ii better for the poorer classes to have the aid,  
of the richer hy a genet al tax on pioperty, than ihr  
every parent should provide at his own expense le­  
hr education ol his children, it is certain &#x27;hat cvm  
Mass is interested in establishments which give to  
• lie human mind its highest improvements, audio  
every country its truest and most durable celebrity.  
Learned institutions ought to be favorite objects  
with every free people. They throw that lightmer  
the public mind which is tbe best security again«  
cralty and dangerous encroachments on the puhlfc  
liberty. They are nurseries of skilful teachers, for  
the schools disuibuted throughout the conimuniij  
1 bey are themseUes schools for the pat ticular ta|.  
ents required for some ol the public trusts, on tfo  
able execution of Which the welfare of the people  
depends. 1 hey multiply the educated indivulutlt  
bom among whom the people may elect adtiepor­  
Itnn of their public age ts ol every description,mors

ho are to frame the laws,by  
the perspicuity, the consistency and the stability at  
well as h; the just and equal spit it of whi h tht  
gied social purposes are to be answered.  
Without such institutions, the moie rosily cl  
winch t ;,t »rat rely be provided by individual mean!,  
none nut (be Itw wliuse wealth enables them to-up­  
port their sons abroad, can give them the lullest  
education ; and  
. , topoitioti as this is done,tlitis­  
tluence is monopolized which superior inlnrmatici  
cvety where possesses. At cheaper and nearer sei»  
of learning, parents with slender incunies may place  
their sons in a course ol etlucation putting them on  
a level with the sons of the richest ; whilst those  
who are without property,or with bu&#x27; little, tmistbe  
peculiaily interested in a system which unites with  
the more learned institutions, a provision for diffa­  
stng through the entire society, the education need­

comprising the learned institutions, may be still fur­

to be their own governors, must arm themselves  
with the power which knowledge gives.  
  
I have always felt a more than ordinary interest  
in the destinies of Kentucky. Among her earliest  
settlers were some of my particular friends and  
neighbors; and I was myself amongst the foremost  
advocates for submitting to the will of the “district,”  
the question and the time of its becoming a sepa-  
rate member of the American family. Its rapid  
growth and signal prosperity, in this character,  
have afforded me much pleasure, which is nota  
little enhanced by the enlightened patriotism which  
is now providing for the state a pian of education  
embracing every class of citizens, and every grade  
and department of knowledge. No error is more  
certain, than one proceeding from a hasty and su-  
perficial view of the subject, that the people at  
large have no interest in the establishment of acade  
mies, colleges and universities, where a few only,  
  
their sons the advantages of superior education.—  
It is thougbt to be unjust that all should be taxed  
for the benefit of a part, and that too the part  
least needing it. If provisions were not made, at  
the same time, for every part, the objection would  
be a natural one; but, besides the consideration,  
when the higher seminaries belong to a plan of ge-  
neral education, that it is better for the poorer  
classes to have the aid of the richer, by a general  
tax on property, than that every parent should pro-  
vide, at his own expense, for the education of his  
children, it is certain that every class is interested  
in establishments, which give to the human mind  
the highest improvements, and to every country its  
truest and most durable celebrity.  
  
Learned institutions ought to be favorite objects  
with every free people. They throw that light  
over the public mind, which is the best security  
against crafty and dangerous encroachments on the  
public liberty. They are nurseries of skilful teach-  
ers, for the schools distributed throughout the com  
munity. They are themselves schools for the par-  
ticular talents required for some of the public  
trusts, on the able execution of which the welfare  
of the people depends. They multiply the educat-  
ed individuals, from among whom the people may  
elect a due portion of their public agents of every  
description, more especially, of those who are to  
frame the laws, by the perspicuity, the consistency  
and the stability, as well as by the just and equal  
spirit of which the great social purposes are to be  
answered,  
  
Without such institutions, the more costly of  
which can scarcely be provided by individual means,  
none buta few, whose wealth enables them to sup-  
pert their sons abroad, can give them the fullest  
education; and, in proportion as this is done, the in.  
fluence is monopolized, which superior information  
every where possess. At cheaper and nearer seats  
of learning, parents, with slender incomes, may  
place their sons in a course of education putting  
them on a level with the sons of the richest; whilst  
those who are without property, or with but little,  
must be peculiarly interested in a system, which  
unites with the more learned institutions, a provi-  
sion for diffusing through the entire society, the  
education needed for the common purposes of life.  
A system comprising the learned institutions, may  
be still further recommended to the more indigent  
class of citizens; by such an arrangement as was re-  
ported tothe general assembly of Virginia in the

*The report was made by Mr. Jefferson, Mr, Pen-

laws, in order to adapt them to the genius of repub-  
  
lican government. It made a part of a “bill for  
the more general diffusion of knowledge,” that,  
wherever a youth was ascertained to possess talents,  
meriting an education which his parents could not  
afford, he should be carried forward, at the public  
expense, from seminary to seminary, to thé com-  
pletion of his education, at the highest.  
  
But why should it be necessary in this case to  
distinguish the society into classes according to  
their property? When it is considered that the  
establishment and endowment of academies, col-  
leges an universities, are a provision not merely for  
the existing generation, but for succeeding ones  
also; that, in governments like ours, a constant rota-  
tion of property results from the free scope to in-  
dustry and from the laws of inheritance, and when  
it is considered, moreover, how much of the exer-  
tions and privations of all are meant, not for them-  
selves, but for their posterity, there can be little  
ground for objections from any class, to plans of  
which every class must have its turn of benefit.  
The rich man, when contributing to a permanent  
plan for the education of the poor, ought to reflect  
that he is providing for that of his own descendants;  
and the poor man, who concurs in a provision for  
those who are not poor, that, at no distant day, it  
may be enjoyed by descendants from himself. It  
does not require a long life to witness these vicissi-  
tudes of fortune.  
  
It is among the happy peculiarities of our union,  
that the states composing it derive from their rela-  
tions to each other, and to the whole, a salutary emu-  
lation, without the enmity involved in competitions  
among states alien to each other. This emulation,  
we may perceive, is not without its influence in se-  
veral important respects; and in none ought to be  
more felt, than in the merit of diffusing the light  
and the advantages of public instruction. In the  
example, therefore, which Kentucky is presenting,  
she not only consults her own welfare, but is giving  
an impulse to many of her sisters who may be behind  
her in the noble career.  
  
Throughout the civilized world, nations are court-  
ing the praise of fostering science and the useful  
arts, and opening their eyes to the principles and  
the blessings of representative government. The  
American people owe it to themselves and to the  
cause of free government, to prove, by their estab-  
lishments for the advancement and diffusion of  
knowledge, that their political institutions, which  
are attracting observations from every quarter, and  
are respected as models of the new born states in  
our own hemisphere, are as favorable to the intel-  
lectual and moral improvement of man, as they are  
comfortable to his individual and social rights.  
What spectable can be more edifying or more rea-  
sonable, than that of liberty and learning, each lean-  
ing on the other for mutual and surest support?  
  
The committee, of which your name is the first,  
have taken a very judicious course, in endeavoring  
to avail Kentucky of the experience of elder states  
  
in modifying her schools. I enclose extracts from  
the laws of Virginia on that gubject, though | pre-  
  
sume they will give little aid; the less, as they have  
as yet been imperfectly carried into execution.—  
The states where such systems have been long in  
operation, will furnish much better answers to ma-  
  
ny of the inquiries stated in your circular. But  
afterall, such isthe diversity of local circumstances,  
particularly as the population varies in density and

is becoming less and less sparse, and it may be well,  
  
in laying the foundation of a good system, to have  
  
a view to this progressive change, much attention  
  
seems due to examples in the eastern states, where  
  
the people are most compact, and where there has  
  
been the longest experience in plans of popular  
, education.  
  
1 know not that I can offer, on the occasion, any  
suggestion not likely to occur to the committee.—  
Were I to hazard one, it would be in favor of add-  
ing to reading, writing and arithmetic, to which the  
instruction of the poor is commonly limited, some  
knowledge of geography, such as can easily be  
conveyed by a globe and map, and a concise geo-  
graphical grammar. And how easily and quickly  
might a general idea even be conveyed of the so-  
lar system, by the aid of a planetarian of the cheap-  
est construction. No information seems better cal-  
culated to expand the mind and gratify curiosity  
than what would thus be imparted. This is espe.  
‘cially the case with what relates to the globe we  
inhabit, the nations among which it is divided, and  
the characters and customs which distinguish them.  
An acquaintance with foreign countries in this  
mode, has a kindred effect’ with that of seeing  
them as travellers; which never fails, in uncorrupt-  
ed minds, to weaken local prejudices and enlarge  
the sphere of benevolent feelings. A knowledge  
of the globe and its various inhabitants, however  
slight, might moreover create a taste for history, an  
inexhaustible fund of entertainment and instruction.  
Any reading, not of a vicious species, must be a  
good substitue for the amusements too apt to fill  
up the leisure of the laboring classes.  
  
I feél myself much obliged, sir, by your expres-  
sions of personal kindness, and pray you to accept  
a return of my good wishes, with assurances of my  
  
eat esteem and respect. JAMES MADISON.  
  
P. S. On reflection, f omit the extracts from the  
Virginia laws, which, it is probable, may be within  
your reach at home. Should it be otherwise, and  
you think them worth the transmission by mail, the

mity involved in competition among States,  
alien to each other.  
may perceive, is not without its  
several important respects: and im none  
ought it to be more felt, than in the merit  
of diffusing the light and the advantages o%  
ublic instruction. In the example, there-  
ore, which Kentucky 1s presenting, she not  
only consults her own welfare, but 1s giving  
an impulse to any of her sisters, who may  
be behind her in the noble career.  
Throughout the civilized world, nations  
are courting the praise of fostering science  
and the useful arts; and are opening their  
eyes to the principles and the blessings of  
representative government.—The Ameri-  
can people owe it to themselves, and to the  
cause of free government, to prove by their  
establishments for the advancement and dif-  
fusion of knowledge, that their political m-  
stitutions, which are attracting observation  
from every quarter, and are respected as  
models by the new born States im our own  
hemisphere, are as favourable to the intel-  
lectual and moral improvement of man, as  
they are conformable to his individual and  
social rights. What spectacle can be more  
edifying or more seasonable, than that or  
Liberty and Learning, each leaning on the  
other for their mutual and surest support ?  
The cemmittee, of which your name Is the  
first, have taken a very judicious course, i  
endeavouring to avail Kentucky of the ex-  
perience of elder States in modifying her  
schools. I enclose extracts from the laws  
of Virginia on that subject ; though I pre-  
sume they will give little aid; the less, as  
they have as yet been imperfectly carried  
into execution—The States where such sys-  
tems have been long in operation, will fur-  
nish much better answers to many of the  
inquiries stated in your Circular. But after  
all, such is the diversity of local circum-  
stances, particularly as the population varies  
in density and sparseness, that the details  
suited to some, may be little so to others.  
S| As the population, however, is becoming  
less and less sparse, and it may be well, in

“ A popular government,” says Madison, “ without pop-

error is more certain than the one proceeding from a  
hasty and superficial view of the subject: that the peo-

academies, colleges, and universities, where a few only,  
and those not of the poorer classes, can obtain for their  
sons the advantages of superior education. It is thought  
to be unjust that all should be taxed for the benefit of  
a part, and that, too, the part least needing it.

MR. ALDRICH’S LECTURE.  
  
. for the poorer classes to have the aid of the richer by a  
general tax of property, than that every parent should  
provide, at his own expense, for the education of his  
children, it is certain that every class is interested in  
establishments which give to the human mind its high-  
est improvement, and to every country its truest and  
most durable celebrity.  
  
“ Learned institutions ought to be favorite objects with  
every free people. They throw that light over the public  
mind which is the best security against crafty and dan-  
gerous encroachments on the public liberty.  
  
“ But why should it be necessary, in this case, to dis-  
tinguish society into classes according to their property ?  
When it is considered that the establishment and en-  
dowment of academies, colleges, and universities are a  
provision, not merely for the existing generation, but  
for succeeding ones also, — that in governments: like  
ours, a constant rotation of property results from the  
free scope to industry, and from the laws of inheritance ;  
and when it is considered, moreover, how much of the  
exertions and privations of all are meant, not for them-  
selves but for their posterity, — there can be little  
ground for objections from any class to plans of which  
every class must have its turn of benefits. The rich  
man, when contributing to a permanent plan for the  
education of the poor, ought to reflect that he is provid-  
ing for his own descendants; and the poor man, who  
concurs in a provision for those who are not poor, that  
at no distant day it may be enjoyed by descendants  
from himself. It does not require a long life to witness  
these vicissitudes of fortune.”  
  
The views of Jefferson upon the same subject may be  
found clearly expressed in a bill early prepared by him  
for the Legislature of Virginia. It provided for a sys-

Unfortunately for that great State, this ‘comprehensive  
system of schools for the education of its people in the  
lower and higher branches of knowledge was not adopted  
at the time; and was only in part realized

realize more and more every year. “A popular government  
without popular information or the means of acquiring it,”  
said Mr. Madison, “is but a prologue to a farce or a tragedy,  
or perhaps to both.” We are now brought face to face with  
a danger which Mr. Madison thus tersely placed before the  
American people, by putting the ballot in the hands of a  
million uneducated negroes in the Southern States, and the  
troublesome question is how to dispose of it so as to avoid  
or at least lessen its evil consequences. It requires the high-  
est type of statesmanship to grapple and deal with the ques-  
tion, and yet it is practically left to the negro himself to work  
out the remedy for his own ignorance, if he can, a paradox

over the public mind which is the best  
security against crafty and dangerous en­  
croachments on the public liberty. They  
are nurseries of skillful teachers for the  
schools distributed throughout the com­

some of the public trusts, on the able exe­
