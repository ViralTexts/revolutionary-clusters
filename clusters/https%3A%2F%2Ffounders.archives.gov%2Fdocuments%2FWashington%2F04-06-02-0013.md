pposed to the Constitution, and have favoured the public with their opinions, quadrate with each other? Are they not at varience on some of the most important points? If the opponants in the same State cannot agree in their principles what prospect is there of a coalescence with the advocates of the measure when the different views, and jarring interests of so wide and extended an Empire are to be brought forward and combated.  
To my Judgement, it is more clear than ever, that an attempt to amend the Constitution which is submitted, would be productive  
  
of more heat, &amp; greater confusion than can well be conceived. There are somethings in the new form, I will readily acknowledge, wch never did, and I am persuaded never will, obtain my cordial approbation; but I then did conceive, and now do most firmly believe, that, in the aggregate, it is the best Constitution that can be obtained at this Epocha; and that this, or a dissolution of the Union awaits our choice, &amp; are the only alternatives before us—Thus beliving, I had not, nor have I now any hesitation in deciding on which to lean.

“There are some things,” he wrote, “in this

A spirit of compromise and concession pre-  
yailed, and the Constitution was adopted by al!  
the States. All eyes were now turned to Wash-
