Gentlemen of the Senate  
[4 Mch. 1797]  
  
Entering on the duties of the office to which I am called, I feel it incumbent on me to apologize to this honourable house for the insufficient manner in which I fear they may be discharged. At an earlier period of my life, and through some considerable portion of it, I have  been a member of legislative bodies, and not altogether inattentive to the forms of their proceedings; but much time has elapsed since that, other duties have occupied my mind, and in a great degree it has lost it’s familiarity with this subject. I fear that the house will have but too frequent occasion to percieve the truth of this acknowledgment. If a diligent attention however will enable me to fulfill the functions now assigned me, I may promise that diligence and attention shall be sedulously employed. For one portion of my duty I shall engage with more confidence, because it will depend on my will and not on my capacity. The rules which are to govern the proceedings of this house, so far as they shall depend on me for their application, shall be applied with the most rigorous and inflexible impartiality, regarding neither persons, their views or principles, and seeing only the abstract proposition subject to my decision. If in forming that decision I concur with some and differ from others, as must of necessity happen, I shall rely on the liberality and candour of those from whom I differ to believe that I do it on pure motives.  
I might here proceed, and with the greatest truth, to declare my zealous attachment to the constitution of the United States, that I consider the Union of these states as the first of blessings, and as the first of duties the preservation of that constitution which secures it; but I suppose these declarations not pertinent to the occasion of entering into an office whose primary business is merely to preside over the forms of this house, and no one more sincerely prays that no accident may call me to the higher and more important functions which the constitution eventually devolves on this office. These have been justly confided to the eminent character which has preceded me here, whose talents and integrity have been known and revered by me thro’ a long course of years; have been the foundation of a cordial and uninterrupted friendship between us; and I devoutly pray he may be long preserved for the government, the happiness, and prosperity of our common country.

ENT’ RING on the duties of the office to which T am called, I feel it  
  
incumlent an me to apologize to this honorable house for the insufficient man-  
wer in which I fear they may be discharged. At an earlier period of mp  
life, and through some considerable portion of it, I have been a member of  
legislative bodies, and not altogether inattentive to the forms of their pro-  
ceedings; but much time has elapsed since that other duties have yet 844  
my.mind, and in a great degree it has lost its familiarity with this subjeé?.  
I fear that the house will have but teo frequent occasion to perceive the truth  
of this acknowledgment. If a diligent attention, however, will enable mé  
to fulfil the functions now assigned’ me, 1 may promise that diligence and  
attention shall be sedulously employed. For one portion of my duty I shall  
engage with more confidence, because it will depend on my will and not on  
my cafactty. :  
  
The rules which are to govern the proceedings of this house, so far as they  
tha]l depend on me for their application, shall be applied with the most ri-  
gorous and inflexible wnpartiality, regarding neither persons, their vitwsy  
ow frincifles, and seeing only the abstrad proposition subject to my dectsion.  
Tf in forming that opinion I concur with some and differ from orhers, as  
must of necessity happen, I shall rely on the liberality and candour of those  
From whom I differ, to believe that I do it on pure motives.  
  
I might here &quot;eet and with the greatest truth, to declare my zealous  
attachment to the constitution of the United States; that I consider the union  
of these states as the first of blessings, and as the first of duties the preser-  
vation of that constitution which secures it: but I suppose these declarations  
not pertinent to the occasion of entering into an office whose primary business  
ts merely .to preside over the forms of this house ;* and no one more sincerely  
frays that no accident may call me tothe higher and more important funétions  
which the constitution eventually devolves on this office. These have been  
justly confided to the eminent charaéter which has preceded me here; whose  
talents and integrity have been known and revered by me through a long course  
of years; have been the foundation of a cordial and uninterrupted friend-  
shift between us; and I devoutly pray he may be long preserved for the go-  
  
wernment, the happ iness and prosperity of our common country

House, for the infufficient manner in which  
1 fedr they may be discharged. Actan ear.

I {hall engage with more confidence, be­  
cause it will depend on my will and not

The rules which are to govern the pro­

be applied ‘with the most rigorous and in­  
flexible imparuality, regarding neither per­

only the abftra&amp;t proposition {ubjeft to my  
decision. If, in forming that opinion, I  
concur with some and differ from others,  
as must of neceflity happen, I shall rely on  
the hiberality and candor of those from  
whom 1 differ, to believe that I do iton  
pure motives. I might here proceed, and  
with the greateft.truth, to declare my zea­  
lous attachment to the Conflitution of the  
United States, that I confider the union of  
these slates as the fisft of bleflings, and as  
the firlt of duties, the preservation of that  
constitution which {ecures it : But I sup­  
pose thele declarations not pertinent to the  
occasion of entering into an office whole  
primary bufine{s@s merely to preside over  
the forms of this house : And no one more  
sincerely prays, that no accident may call
