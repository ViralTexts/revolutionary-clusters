HE Pennsylvania Hospital  
About the End of the Year 1750, some Persons, who had frequent Opportunities of observing the Distress of such distemper’d Poor as from Time to Time came to Philadelphia, for the Advice and Assistance of the Physicians and Surgeons of that City; how difficult it was for them to procure suitable Lodgings, and other Conveniences proper for their respective Cases, and how expensive the Providing good and careful Nurses, and other Attendants, for want whereof, many must suffer greatly, and some probably perish, that might otherwise have been restored to Health and Comfort, and become useful to themselves, their Families, and the Publick, for many Years after; and considering moreover, that even the poor Inhabitants of this City, tho’ they had Homes, yet were therein but badly accommodated in Sickness, and could not be so well and so easily taken Care of in their separate Habitations, as they might be in one convenient House, under one Inspection, and in the Hands of skilful Practitioners; and several of the Inhabitants of the Province, who unhappily became disorder’d in their Senses, wander’d about, to the Terror of their Neighbours, there being no Place (except the House of Correction) in which they might be confined, and subjected to proper Management for their Recovery, and that House was by no Means fitted for such Purposes; did charitably consult together, and confer with their Friends and Acquaintances, on the best Means of relieving the Distressed, under those Circumstances; and an Infirmary, or Hospital, in the Manner of several lately established in Great Britain, being proposed, was so generally approved, that there was Reason to expect a considerable Subscription from the Inhabitants of this City, towards the Support of such an Hospital; but the Expence of erecting a Building sufficiently large and commodious for the Purpose, it was thought would be too heavy, unless the Subscription could be made general through the Province, and some Assistance could be obtained from the Assembly; the following Petition was therefore drawn, and presented to the House on the 23d of January, 1750–51.  
  
To the Honourable House of Representatives of the Province of Pennsylvania,  
The Petition of sundry Inhabitants of the said Province.  
Humbly sheweth,  
That with the Numbers of People the Number of Lunaticks, or Persons distemper’d in Mind, and deprived of their rational Faculties, hath greatly encreased in this Province.  
That some of them going at large, are a Terror to their Neighbours, who are daily apprehensive of the Violences they may commit; and others are continually wasting their Substance, to the great Injury of themselves and Families, ill disposed Persons wickedly taking Advantage of their unhappy Condition, and drawing them into unreasonable Bargains, &amp;c.  
That few or none of them are so sensible of their Condition as to submit voluntarily to the Treatment their respective Cases require, and therefore continue in the same deplorable State during their Lives; whereas it has been found, by the Experience of many Years, that above two Thirds of the mad People received into Bethlehem Hospital, and there treated properly, have been perfectly cured.  
Your Petitioners beg Leave farther to represent, that tho’ the good Laws of this Province have made many compassionate and charitable Provisions for the Relief of the Poor, yet something farther seems wanting in Favour of such whose Poverty is made more miserable by the additional Weight of a grievous Disease, from which they might easily be relieved, if they were not situated at too great a Distance from regular Advice and Assistance, whereby many languish out their Lives, tortur’d perhaps with the Stone, devour’d by the Cancer, depriv’d of Sight by Cataracts, or gradually decaying by loathsome Distempers; who, if the Expence in the present Manner of nursing and attending them separately when they come to Town, were not so discouraging, might again, by the judicious Assistance of Physick and Surgery, be enabled to taste the Blessings of Health, and be made in a few Weeks useful Members of the Community, able to provide for themselves and Families.  
The kind Care our Assemblies have heretofore taken for the Relief of sick and distemper’d Strangers, by providing a Place for their Reception and Accommodation, leaves us no Room to doubt their shewing an equal tender Concern for the Inhabitants. And we hope they will be of Opinion with us, that a small Provincial Hospital, erected and put under proper Regulations, in the Care of Persons to be appointed by this House, or otherwise, as they shall think meet, with Power to receive and apply the charitable Benefactions of good People towards enlarging and supporting the same, and some other Provisions in a Law for the Purposes abovementioned, will be a good Work, acceptable to God, and to all the good People they represent.  
We therefore humbly recommend the Premises to their serious Consideration.  
On the second Reading of the Petition, January 29, the House gave Leave to the Petitioners to bring in a Bill, which was read the first Time on the first of February. For some Time it was doubtful whether the Bill would not miscarry, many of the Members not readily conceiving the Necessity or Usefulness of the Design; and apprehending moreover, that the Expence of paying Physicians and Surgeons, would eat up the whole of any Fund that could be reasonably expected to be raised; but three of the Profession, viz. Doctors Lloyd Zachary, Thomas Bond, and Phineas Bond, generously offering to attend the Hospital gratis for three Years, and the other Objections being by Degrees got over, the Bill, on the seventh of the same Month, passed the Hous

 and in May following it received the Governor’s Assent, and was enacted into a Law, as follows.  
An Act to encourage the Establishing of an Hospital for the Relief of the Sick Poor of this Province, and for the Reception and Cure of Lunaticks.  
Whereas the saving and restoring useful and laborious Members to a Community, is a Work of publick Service, and the Relief of the Sick Poor is not only an Act of Humanity, but a religious Duty; and whereas there are frequently, in many Parts of this Province, poor distemper’d Persons, who languish long in Pain and Misery under various Disorders of Body and Mind, and being scattered abroad in different and very distant Habitations, cannot have the Benefit of regular Advice, Attendance, Lodging, Diet and Medicines, but at a great Expence, and therefore often suffer for want thereof; which Inconveniency might be happily removed, by collecting the Patients into one common Provincial Hospital, properly disposed and appointed, where they may be comfortably subsisted, and their Health taken Care of at a small Charge, and by the Blessing of God on the Endeavours of skilful Physicians and Surgeons, their Diseases may be cured and removed. And whereas it is represented to this Assembly, that there is a charitable Disposition in divers Inhabitants of this Province to contribute largely towards so good a Work, if such Contributors might be incorporated with proper Powers and Privileges for carrying on and compleating the same, and some Part of the Publick Money given and appropriated to the Providing a suitable Building for the Purposes aforesaid.  
Therefore, for the Encouragement of so useful, pious and charitable a Design, we pray that it may be enacted, And be it enacted by the Honourable James Hamilton, Esquire, Lieutenant-Governor under the Honourable Thomas Penn, and Richard Penn, Esquires, true and absolute Proprietaries of the Province of Pennsylvania, and Counties of New-Castle, Kent and Sussex, upon Delaware, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Representatives of the Freeman of the said Province in General Assembly met, and by the Authority of the same, That it shall and may be lawful to and for all Persons, each of whom shall have contributed or subscribed the Sum of Ten Pounds or more, towards founding an Hospital, for the Reception and Relief of Lunaticks, and other distemper’d and sick Poor within this Province, or as many of them as shall think fit to assemble and meet on the first Day of the Month called July next; and for all Persons who shall thereafter contribute the like Sum of Ten Pounds or more (together with the said first Subscribers) or so many of them as shall think fit to assemble and meet on the second Day of the first Week, in the Month called May, yearly for ever, at some convenient Place in the City of Philadelphia, then and there to elect by Ballot, twelve fit and suitable Persons of their own Number to be Managers of the said Contribution and Hospital, and one other Person to be Treasurer of the same, until the next Election; and farther, to make such Laws, Rules and Orders, as shall appear to them the said Contributors met, or the major Part of them, to be good, useful and necessary, for the well governing, ordering and regulating the said Hospital, and for the Regulation of the future Elections of Managers, Treasurer, and other necessary Officers and Ministers thereof, and for limiting and appointing their Number, Trust, and Authority, and generally for the well ordering all other Things concerning the Government, Estate, Goods, Lands, Revenues, as also all the Business and Affairs of the said Hospital: All which Laws, Rules and Orders, so to be made as aforesaid, shall be from Time to Time inviolably observed by all concern’d, according to the Tenor and Effect of them, provided they be not repugnant to the Laws of England or this Government, and are approved by the Chief Justice, the Speaker of the Assembly, and the Attorney-General of this Province for the Time being, under their Hands and Seals. And the said Contributors shall be, and are hereby made a Body Corporate in Law, to all Intents and Purposes, and shall have perpetual Succession, and may sue, or be sued, plead, or be impleaded, by the Name of The Contributors to the Pennsylvania Hospital, in all Courts of Judicature within this Province, and by that Name, shall and may receive and take any Lands, Tenements, or Hereditaments, not exceeding the yearly Value of One Thousand Pounds, of the Gift, Alienation, Bequest, or Devise of any Person or Persons whomsoever; and of any Goods or Chattels whatsoever; and the said Contributors are hereby impower’d to have and use one common Seal in their Affairs, and the same at their Pleasure to change and alter.  
Provided nevertheless, That no General Meeting of the said Contributors, nor any Persons acting under them, shall employ any Money or other Estate, expresly given or added to the Capital Stock of the said Hospital, in any other Way than by applying its annual Interest or Rent towards the Entertainment and Care of the sick and distemper’d Poor, that shall be from Time to Time brought and placed therein, for the Cure of their Diseases, from any Part of this Province, without Partiality or Preference.  
And for the further Encouragement of this beneficent Undertaking, Be it enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That when the said Contributors shall have met and chosen their Managers and Treasurer as aforesaid, and shall have raised by their Contributions, a Capital Stock of Two Thousand Pounds Value (the yearly Interest or Rent of which is to be applied to the Accommodating of the Sick Poor in the said Hospital, free of Charge for Diet, Attendance, Advice and Medicines) and shall make the same appear to the Satisfaction of the Speaker of the Assembly for the Time being; that then it shall and may be lawful for the said Speaker of the Assembly, and he is hereby required to sign an Order or Orders on the Provincial Treasurer, or Trustees of the Loan-Office, for the Payment of Two Thousand Pounds, in two yearly Payments, to the Treasurer of the said Hospital, to be applied to the Founding, Building, and Furnishing of the same.  
And be it further enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That the Accounts of the Disbursements of the said Two Thousand Pounds, so ordered by the Speaker of the Assembly aforesaid, or any Part thereof that shall be hereafter expended, as the Case may be, and of the Rents, Products, and Interests of any real or personal Estates or Sums of Money charitably given to the Use of the said Hospital, together with a List of such Donations, shall be fairly drawn out and published annually in the Gazette, or other Newspapers: And the Managers of the said Hospital shall at all Times, when required, submit the Books, Accounts, Affairs, and Œconomy thereof, to the Inspection and free Examination of such Visitors as may from Time to Time be appointed by the Assembly of this Province, to visit and inspect the same.  
Provided always, and it is hereby further enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That if at any Time hereafter, there should not be a constant Succession of Contributors to meet yearly and chuse Managers as aforesaid, then the said Hospital, and the Estate and Affairs thereof, shall be in the Management, and under the Direction of such Persons as shall be from Time to Time appointed by Act of General Assembly of this Province for that Purpose.

fore the movement of Pinel—the Pennsylvania Hospital,

the care and treatment of the insane established; in  
which the system afterwards advocated by Pinel, in  
France, was anticipated, and the barbarous method of  
treatment to which the insane were then exposed, was  
abandoned. In the preamble to an act of the Provin-  
cial Assembly, there are these noble words: “ Whereas,  
there are frequently, in many parts of this province,  
poor distempered persons, who languish long in pain  
and misery, under various disorders of body and mind  
—and being scattered abroad in different and very dis-  
tant habitations, cannot have the benefit of regular  
advice, attendance, lodging, diet and medicine, but at a  
great expense; and, therefore, often suffer for want  
thereof; which inconveniency might be happily re-  
moved by collecting the patients into one common  
Provincial Hospital, properly disposed and appointed,  
where they may be comfortably subsisted, and their  
health taken care of at a small charge, and by the bless-  
ing of God on the endeavors of skilful physicians and

Province, which Humbly Sheweth—  
  
“That with the Numbers of People, the  
Number of Lunatics or Persons distempered  
in Mind and deprived of their rational Facul-  
ties hath greatly increased in this Province.  
  
“That some of them going at large are a  
Terror ta their Neighbors, who are daily appre-  
hensive of the Violences they may commit;  
And others are continually wasting their Sub-  
stance, to the great Injury of themselves and  
Families; ill-disposed Persons wickedly taking  
Advantage of their unhappy Condition, and  
drawing them into unreasonable Bargains,  
etc.; That few or none of them are so sen-  
sible of their Condition as to submit volun-  
tarily to the Treatment their respective Cases  
require, and therefore continue in the same  
deplorable State during their Lives: whereas  
it has been found by the Experience of many  
Years that above Two-Thirds of the Mad

People received into the Bethlehem Hospital,  
and there treated properly, have been per-  
fectly cured,  
  
‘Your Petitioners beg Leave farther to rep-  
resent, That the good Laws of this Province  
have made many compassionate and charita-  
ble Provisions for the Relief of the Poor, yet  
something farther seems wanting in favor of  
such, whose Poverty is made more miserable  
by the additional Weight of a grievous Dis-  
ease, from which they might easily be relieved  
if they were not situated at too great a Dis-  
tance from regular Advice and Assistance,  
whereby many languish out their Lives, tor-  
tured perhaps with the Stone, devoured by the  
Cancer, deprived of sight by Cataracts, or  
gradually decaying by loathsome Distempers,  
who, if the Expense in the present Manner of  
Nursing and Attending them separately when  
they come to Town were not so discouraging,  
might again, by the judicious Assistance of  
Physic and Surgery, be enabled to Taste the  
Blessings of Health, and be made in a few  
Weeks useful Members of the Community,  
able to provide for themselves and Families.  
  
“‘ The kind Care our Assemblies have here-  
tofore taken for the Relief of sick and distem-  
pered Strangers, by providing a Place for  
their Reception and Accommodation, leaves  
us no room to doubt their showing an equal  
tender Concern for the Inhabitants. And we  
hope they will be of Opinion with us, that a  
small Provincial Hospital, erected and put  
under proper Regulations in the Care of Per-  
sons to be appointed by this House or other-  
wise, as they shall think meet, with Power  
to receive and apply the charitable Benefac-  
tions of good People towards enlarging and  
Supporting the Same and Some other Provis-  
ions in a Law for the Purposes above men-

God and to all the good People they repre-
