Indented servants formed a considerable supply. These were poor Europeans who went to America to settle themselves. If they could pay their passage it was well. If not, they must find means of paying it. They were at liberty therefore to make an agreement with any person they chose, to serve him such a length of time as they agreed on, on condition that he would repay to the master  of the vessel the expences of their passage. If being foreigners unable to speak the language, they did not know how to make a bargain for themselves the captain of the vessel contracted for them with such person as he could. This contract was by deed indented, which occasioned them to be called indented servants.

Thus it appears that the 200 millions of Dollars emitted by Congress were worth to those who received them but about 36. millions of silver dollars. If we estimate at the same value the like sum of 200 millions supposed to have been emitted by the states, and state the Federal debt, foreign and domestic, at about 43. Millions, and the state debts at about 25 millions, it will form an amount of 140. millions of Dollars, or 735 millions of livres Tournois, the total sum which the war has cost the inhabitants of the U.S. It continued 8. years from the battle of Lexington to the cessation of hostilities in America. The annual expence then was about 17,500,000 Dollars, while that of our enemies was a greater number of guineas.  
It will be asked How will the two masses of Continental and of State money have cost the people of the U.S. 72. millions of dollars, when they are to be redeemed now with about six millions? I answer that the difference, being 66. millions has been lost on the paper bills separately by the successive holders of them. Every one thro whose hands a bill passed, lost on that bill what it lost in value, during the time it was in his hands. This was a real tax on him;  and in this way the people of the united states actually contributed those 66. millions of dollars during the war, and by a mode of taxation the most oppressive of all, because the most unequal of all.

.The uneasiness excited by this institution had very early caught the notice of General Washington. Still recollecting all the purity of the motives which gave it birth, he became sensible that it might produce political evils which the warmth of these motives had masked. Add to this that it was disapproved by the mass of the citizens of the Union. This alone was reason strong enough in a country where the will of the majority is the law, and ought to be the law. He saw that the objects of the institution were too light to be opposed to considerations as serious as these; and that it was become necessary to annihilate it absolutely. On this therefore he was decided. The first annual meeting at Philadelphia was now at hand. He went to that, determined to exert all his influence for it’s suppression. He proposed it to his fellow officers, and urged it with all his powers. It met an opposition which was observed to cloud his face with an anxiety that the most distressful scenes of the war had scarcely ever produced. It was canvassed for several days, and at length it was no more a doubt what would be it’s ultimate fate. The order was on the point of receiving it’s annihilation by the vote of a very great  majority of it’s members. In this moment their envoy arrived from France, charged with letters from the French officers accepting with cordiality the proposed badges of union, with sollicitations from others to be received into the order, and with notice that their respectable sovereign had been pleased to recognise it, and to permit his officers to wear it’s badge. The prospect was now changed. The question assumed a new form. After the offer made by them, and accepted by their friends, in what words could they clothe a proposition to retract it which would not cover themselves with the reproaches of levity and ingratitude? Which would not appear an insult to those whom they loved? Federal principles, popular discontent, were considerations whose weight was known and felt by themselves. But would foreigners know and feel them equally? Would they so far acknolege their cogency as to permit without any indignation the eagle and ribbon to be torn from their breasts by the very hands which had placed them there? The idea revolted the whole society. They found it necessary then to preserve so much of their institution as might continue to support this foreign branch, while they should prune off every other which could give offence to their fellow citizens; thus sacrificing on each hand to their friends and to their country. The society was to retain it’s existence, it’s name, it’s meetings, and it’s charitable funds; but these last were to be deposited with their respective legislatures; the order was to be no longer hereditary, a reformation which had been even pressed from this side the Atlantic; it was to be communicated to no new members; the general meetings instead of annual were to be triennial only. The eagle and ribbon indeed were retained; because they were worn, and they wished them to be worn, by their friends who were in a country where they would not be objects of offence; but themselves never wore them. They laid them up in their bureaus with the medals of American independance, with those of the trophies they had taken and the battles they had won. But through all the United states no officer is seen to offend the public eye with the display of this badge. These changes have tranquilised the American states. Their citizens do justice to the circumstance which prevented a total annihilation of the order. They feel too much interest in the reputation of their officers, and value too much whatever may serve to recall to the memory of their allies the moments wherein they formed but one people. Tho they are obliged by a prudent foresight to keep out every thing from among themselves which might pretend to divide them into orders, and  to degrade one description of men below another, yet they hear with pleasure that their allies whom circumstances have already placed under these distinctions, are willing to consider it as one to have aided them in the establishment of their liberties, and to wear a badge which may recall them to their remembrance; and it would be an extreme affliction to them if the domestic reformation which has been found necessary, if the censures of individual writers, or if any other circumstances should discourage the wearing their badge, or lessen it’s reputation.  
This short but true history of the order of the Cincinnati, taken from the mouths of persons on the spot who were privy to it’s origin, and progress, and who know it’s present state, is the best apology which can be made for an institution which appeared to be, and was really, so heterogeneous to the governments in which it was erected. It should be further considered that, in America, no other distinction between man and man had ever been known, but that of persons in office exercising powers by authority of the laws, and private individuals. Among these last the poorest labourer stood on equal ground with the wealthiest Millionary, and generally on a more favoured one whenever their rights seemed to jar. It has been seen that a shoemaker, or other artisan, removed by the voice of his country from his work bench into a chair of office, has instantly commanded all the respect and obedience which the laws ascribe to his office. But of distinctions by birth or badge they had no more idea than they had of the mode of existence in the moon or planets. They had heard only that there were such, and knew that they must be wrong. A due horror of the evils which flow from these distinctions could be excited in Europe only, where the dignity of man is lost in arbitrary distinctions, where the human species is classed into several stages of degradation, where the many are crouched under the weight of the few, and where the order established can present to the contemplation of a thinking being no other picture than that of God almighty and his angels trampling under foot the hosts of the damned. No wonder then that the

.  
As to the question then, Whether any evil can proceed from the institution as it stands at present, I am of opinion there may. 1. From the meetings. These will keep the officers formed into a body; will continue a distinction between civil and military which it would be for the good of the whole to obliterate as soon as possible; and military assemblies will not only keep alive the jealousies and the fears of the civil government, but give ground for these fears and jealousies. For when men meet together, they will make business if they have none; they will collate their grievances, some real, some imaginary, all highly painted; they will communicate to each other the sparks of discontent; and these may engender a flame which will consume their particular, as well as the general, happiness.2. The charitable part of the institution is still more likely to do mischeif, as it perpetuates the dangers apprehended in the preceding clause. For here is a fund provided of permanent existence. To whom will it belong? To the descendants of American officers of a certain description. These descendants then will form a body, having a sufficient interest to keep up an attention to their description, to continue meetings, and perhaps, in some moment, when the political eye shall be slumbering, or the firmness of their fellow-citizens relaxed, to replace the insignia of the order, and revive all it’s pretentions. What good can the officers propose which may weigh against these possible evils? The securing their descendants against want? Why afraid to trust them to the same fertile soil, and the same genial climate which will secure from want the descendants of their other fellow-citizens? Are they afraid they will be reduced to labour the earth for their sustenance? They will be rendered thereby both honester and happier. An industrious farmer occupies a more dignified place in the scale of beings, whether moral or political, than a lazy lounger, valuing himself on his family, too proud to work, and drawing out a miserable existence by eating on that surplus of other mens’ labour which is the sacred fund of the helpless poor. A pitiful annuity will only prevent them from exerting that industry and those talents which would soon lead them to better fortune.  
How are these evils to be prevented? 1. At their first general meeting let them distribute the funds on hand to the existing objects of their destination, and discontinue all further contributions.  2. Let them declare at the same time that their meetings general and particular shall thenceforth cease. And 3. let them melt up their eagles and add the mass to the distributable fund that their descendants may have no temptation to hang them in their button holes.  
These reflections are not proposed as worthy the notice of M. de Meusnier. He will be so good as to treat the subject in his own way, and no body has a better. I will only pray him to avail us of his forcible manner to evince that there is evil to be apprehended even from the ashes of this institution, and to exhort the society in America to make their reformation complete; bearing in mind that we must keep the passions of men on our side even when we are persuading them to do what they ought to do.

to consider it as one, to have aided them in   
the establishment of their liberties and to   
wear a badge which may recall them to   
their remembrance; and it would be an ex­  
treme affliction to them, if the domestic re­  
formation which has been found necessary,   
if the censures of individual writers, or if   
any other circumstance should discourage   
the wearing of their badge, or lessen &#x27;its

&quot;Thin short but true history of the order   
of the Cincinnati, taken from the mouths or   
persons on the spot, who were privy to its   
origin and progress, and who know its pre-   
sent state, is the best apology which can be   
made for an institution, which appehred to   
bei-and-was really, so heterogenous to the   
governments in which it was erected.

&quot;As to the question, then whether any   
evil can proceed from,the institution, as it   
stands at present, I am of opinion there may.   
1. From the meetings. These will keep   
the officers formed into a body; will contin­  
ue a distinction between the civil and mili­  
tary assemblies will not only keep alive the   
jealousies and fears ofthe civilgovernment,   
but give ground for these fears and jeal­  
ousies. For when men meet together, they   
will Make business, .if they have none; they   
will collate their grievances, some real,   
some imaginary, all highly painted; they   
will communicate to each other the sparks   
of discontent; and- these may- engender a   
flame, which will consume their particular,   
as well as the general happiness. 2. The   
charitable part of the institution is still more   
likely to do mischief, as it perpetuates the   
dangers apprehended. in the preceding   
clause.- For here is a fund provided, of   
  
entexistenee.   
  
long? t he decendants of American (AI   
cers, of a, certain description. These de­  
scendants, then, will form a body, having a   
sufficient interest to keep up an attention to   
their description, to continue meetings, and   
perhaps, in some moment when the political   
eye shall be slumbering, or the firmness of   
their fellow citizens relaxed, to replace the   
insignia of the order and revive all its pre-   
tensions. What good can the officers. pro­  
apose,_whichnitty_weigh agejalitiheie pos­  
ble evils? The securing their descendants   
against, want? Why afraid to trust them   
to the same fertile soil, and the same gen­  
ial climate, which will secure from want   
the descendants of their other fellow -citi­  
zens? Are they afraid they will be reduc­  
ed to labour the earth for their sustenance?   
They will be rendered thereby both more   
honest and happy. An industrious farmer   
occupies a more dignified place in the scale   
of beings, whether moral or political, than   
a lazy lounger, valuing himself on his farni­  
ly,too proud to work, and drawing out a   
miserable existence,. Isy eating en that sur­  
plus of other men&#x27;s labor, which is the sa­  
cred fund of the helpless poor.. A pitiful   
annuity will only prevent them from exert­  
ing that industry and those talents, which   
would soon lead them to better fortune.   
  
How are these evils to be prevented? 1.   
At their first general meeting; let them dis­  
tribute their funds on hand to the existin   
  
objects of their destination, an, iscontinue   
all•furtileT contributions 2.. Let them de­  
clare, at. the itir e time, that their meetings,

cease. 3. Let them: melt up their eagles,   
and add the. mass to the distributable fund,

These reflections are not&#x27; proposed as   
worthy the notice of M. de Meusuie r. He   
will be so good as to treat the subject in hie

s, in Philadelphia, the hereditary principle and  
the power of adopting honorary members were abolished ; but  
the society, in all other respects, was preserved. According to  
Mr. Jefferson, General Washington used his influence at the  
meeting in Philadelphia, for its suppression, and the society  
would probably have been dissolved but for the return of the  
envoy whom they had dispatched to France for the purpose of  
providing badges for the order, and of inviting the French offi­  
cers to become members. As they could not well retract, it  
was determined that the society should retain its existence, its  
meetings, and its charitable funds. The order was to be no  
‘longer hereditary ; it was to be communicated to no now mem­  
bers ; the general meeting, Instead of being annual, was to  
be triennial only. The badges were now publicly worn in  
America, but it was wished that the Frenchmen who were en­
