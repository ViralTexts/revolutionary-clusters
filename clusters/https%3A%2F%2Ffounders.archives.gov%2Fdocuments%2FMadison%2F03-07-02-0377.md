The Secretary of State to whom was referred several Resolutions of the Senate of the 2d Feby and 9 March last, has the honor to submit to the President the following report:  
Altho’ these resolutions are of different dates, and refer to subjects in some respects distinct in their nature, yet as they are connected in others of considerable importance which bear essentially on the conduct of both parties in the present war, it is thought proper to comprize them in the same report.  
The first of these resolutions calls for the names of the individuals who were selected from the American prisoners of War and sent to G. Britain for trial; their places of residence in the United States; the times when, and the Courts by which they were admitted to become citizens, the regiments to which they belong, when and where they were taken, with copies of any official correspondence respecting the treatment of prisoners of war, and of any orders for retaliation on either side.  
The other resolutions request information of the conduct of Great Britain towards her native subjects, taken in arms against her, and of the general practice of the nations of Europe relative to naturalization, and the employment in war, each, of the subjects of the other; of the cases, with their circumstances, in which any civilized nation has punished its native subjects taken in arms against it, for which punishment retaliation was inflicted, by the nation in whose service they were taken. And lastly  
Under what circumstances and on what grounds G. Britain has refused to discharge native citizens of the United States impressed into her service, and what has been her conduct towards American seamen on board her ships of war, at, and since the commencement of the present war with the United States.  
The paper marked A contains the names of the American prisoners who were sent to England for trial by the British Commander in Canada; of the Corps to which they belong; of the times when, and of the places where, they were taken. Of their places of residence in the United States; of the times and the courts in which they were admitted to become citizens, there is no evidence in this Department, nor is there any to show whether they were naturalized or native citizens of the United States. This paper contains also a copy of the orders of both Govts for retaliation and of the correspondence between their respective Commissaries, concerning the treatment of prisoners.  
The paper marked B states various grounds on which the British Government has refused to deliver up American seamen, impressed into the  
  
British service on the application of the Agents of the United States, regularly authorized to demand them, with the correspondence relating to the same. It communicates also such information as this Department has been able to obtain, of the conduct of the British Govt. towards American seamen on board British ships of war, at, and since the commencement of the present war. Among the causes assigned for their detention, the following are the most deserving of notice.  
  
1 That they had no documents, or that their documents were irregular.  
2 That they were released from prison in Gottenburg.  
3 That they were exchanged as British subjects.  
4 Were said to be impostors.  
5 To have married in England.  
6 Did not answer the descriptions given of them in their protections.  
7 Had attempted to desert.  
8 Were sent into the service for smuggling.  
9 Were not to be found on board of the ship stated.  
10 Had voluntarily entered into the British service.  
11 Were natives of foreign Countries, Prussia Sweden, Italy &amp;c.  
  
It is possible that some of the seamen whose discharges were demanded, may not have been native Citizens of the United States, but very presumable that the greater part were. Indeed the pretext assigned for their detention seems to admit it. Had they been native subjects of England, being there, their origin might have been traced. But that is the ground in few instances only. In urging that some had no protections or that their protections were irregular; that others had been exchanged as British prisoners; were impostors; had attempted to desert; did not answer the protections given them; were natives of Prussia, Sweden &amp;c it is fairly to be inferred that the public authority in England, to whom this duty is assigned, sought rather to evade the application, than to justify the refusal. The pretext that some were natives of Prussia, Sweden &amp;c deserves particular attention. On this circumstance the Secretary will remark only, that in extending impressment, in American vessels, to persons who could not be mistaken for British subjects, and refusing to surrender them, on application, to the voluntary service from which they were taken, it is evident that the recovery of British seamen, has not been the sole object of the practice.  
By the report of the American Commissary of prisoners in England it appears that a considerable number of our seamen have been transferred from British ships of war, to prisons; that their exchange for British seamen taken in battle was demanded, in the first instance; but that that claim seems to have been since waved. It might have been expected that the British Govt, on being satisfied, that these men, or that any of them, were American citizens, would have liberated and sent them home, at its  
  
own charge. They are however, still held prisoners in confinement. That many of them, if not all, are native citizens, cannot be doubted, for had the proof not been irresistible, it cannot be presumed, while so many others are detained on board British ships of war, that these would have been exempted from that service. That many are still detained on board British ships of war may be fairly inferred, even without other evidence, from the indiscriminate manner of British impressment; from the distant service in which the men thus impressed are often necessarily employed, depriving their friends of an opportunity to communicate with them; and from the inconsiderable number discharged, compared with that which has been demanded. Without relying altogether, on the reports heretofore made to Congress, by this Department, the letter of Commodore Rogers, hereunto annexed, affords data from which an estimate may be formed. On this point, the correspondence between Genl Taylor and the Captain of the British ship the Dragon, and Commre. Decatur and Comre. Capel, deserve also particular attention. If the British Govt. would order a strict search to be made, thro’ the British Navy, for American seamen, it would then be seen how many of our native citizens have participated in the lot of the unfortunate men mentioned in the correspondences referred to.  
The contrast which these documents present, in the pretensions and conduct of G. Britain, with the pretensions and conduct of the United States, cannot fail to make a deep impression in favor of the latter. The British Govt. impresses into its Navy native citizens of the United States, and compels them to serve in it, and in many instances, even to fight against their country, while it arrests as traitors and menaces with death, persons suspected to be native British subjects, for having fought under our standard, against British forces, altho’ they had voluntarily entered into our army, after having emigrated to the United States, and incorporated themselves into the American society. The United States, on the other hand, have forced no persons into their service, nor have they sought, nor are they disposed to punish any, who, after having freely emigrated to any part of the British dominions and settled there, may have entered voluntarily into the British army.  
The remaining enquiries relate to objects, other than the immediate conduct of the parties in the present war. They demand information of the conduct of G. Britain, and of other powers in past times, without limitation in the retrospect, in circumstances, bearing on the question of retaliation. The information required relates to the following points.  
  
1 The conduct of G. Britain and the other nations of Europe as to naturalization, and the employment in war, each, of the subjects of the other.  
2 As to the punishment of their native subjects taken in arms against them, in the service of other powers.  
  
3 Examples of retaliation, by the latter in such cases.  
  
These enquiries necessarily involve an extensive research into the history and jurisprudence of the nations of Europe. For so important a task, the other duties of the Secretary of State, have altogether disqualified him, since the call was made. The approaching close of the Session does not leave him time for more than the following observations:  
That all the nations of Europe naturalize foreigners:  
That they all employ in their service the subjects of each other, and frequently against their native countries, even when not regularly naturalized:  
That they all allow their own subjects to emigrate to foreign Countries:  
That altho’ examples may be found of the punishment of their native subjects taken in arms against them, the examples are few, and have either been marked by peculiar circumstances, taking them out of the controverted principle, or have proceeded from the passions or policy of the occasion. Even in prosecutions &amp; convictions having the latter origin, the final act of punishment, has, with little exception, been prevented by a sense of equity and humanity, or a dread of retaliation. It is confidently believed that no instance can be found in which the alleged purposes of the enemy against the 23 prisoners in question, under all the circumstances which belong to their case, even should any of them not have been regularly naturalized, are countenanced by the proceedings of any European nation:  
That if no instances occur of retaliation, in the few cases requiring it, or in any of them, by the Govts employing such persons, it has been, as is presumed, because the punishment which had been inflicted by the native Country, might be accounted for on some principle other than its denial of the right of emigration and naturalization. Had the Government, employing the persons so punished by their native country retaliated in such cases, it might have incurred the reproach either of countenancing acknowledged crimes, or of following the example of the other party in acts of cruelty, exciting horror, rather than of fulfilling its pledge to innocent persons in support of rights fairly obtained, and sanctioned by the general opinion, and practice of all the nations of Europe, ancient and modern. All which is respectfully submitted.

cans*-* assigned for their detention, th*  
following are the most deserving c&gt;f no­  
tice—  
1. Th*t they had no documents^ or that  
‘h*-ir documents were irregular.  
2 ’ t&gt;s&#x27; &#x27;h*y were released from prison  
&gt;n Go&#x27; enbnrg.

10. Mad voluntarily entered into the Bri­

IV W ore natives of foreign countries  
Hr s i r, Sweden, Italy, &amp;c.  
It is probabl that some of the seermn,  
whose discharges were demanded, may not  
hove bee &gt; native citiz ns of the V. Stat-s,  
but verv p vtuioshlt that ill? ore ter par  
were. Indre 1 the p-etorc* assigned for their  
detention seems toa. n it it. Ii d they he •  
n t ve subjects of boglan**, being there,  
their origin might have been traced. But  
that is he grounJ in few instance-. ohlv. In  
urging that som&lt;* hod no pr tectiotis»or tlia&#x27;  
th^-ir protections were irregular; that others  
had been exchanged as British pris&#x27; tiers ;  
wer imuo p rM ; had a&#x27;tempted to desert :  
did not answer the protections given them ;  
were natives of Hruasia, Sweden, ir is  
fairly *d be inferred that the i ublic author  
i*y in England, to whom this dutv is assign  
rd, sought rather to evade the application,  
than to justify the refusal Xhe pretext that j  
some were natives of Prussia. Sweden, &amp;c  
deserves particular attentirn. On his tir  
Tiims&#x27;ance the Secretary v*ill remark n y. j  
that in «*x&#x27;tnding impressment, in A . er* |  
I c m vessel*. to persons who could not b.  
mist, k&#x27;-n for British subjects and refuiny  
itovu render th. m, - n application. to rhe  
| voluntary serv ee from \vh ch they weretn- j  
k°n, ir is evident thar»he re-overy cf British !  
seaxten has not been the v&gt;lu object of tht j  
prarMCe.  
By the rencr* of the American commis  
s?ry of privoners in F.nrlflnd, it appears  
t&gt;r\t a considerble number of our sr&#x27;mir I  
had been transferred from F&gt;rit&#x27;&quot;h ‘hips of  
&quot;a.r:&#x27;° prison - ; that their exchange h,r  
British seamen taken in battle w ;sdemand­  
ed* m the first instance, bu th-.&#x27; that rlh-m 1  
seems to have b*.en since waved It migh*  
have he&lt;»n expected that the British govetr­  
ment, on being satisfied that th-e men or  
any of them, were America ci * ns, would  
have liber ■ d Ct sen&#x27; them iinm&lt;* at its own  
charge. They are, however, s ill held pri  
‘■oners in confinement. Tha many of them  
f not r.M, are native citizen* &#x27; .tnnnc b

of w r, &#x27;hat thc*&gt;e would hfVM been exemp

he fairly inferred, even without o her evi­  
nr. -, from the indis riminam manner of  
B it’s imoivRsmenr ; from the distant se­

REPORT:  
Although these Resolutions are of  
different dates, uml rder to suojecU in some  
respects distinctm their n.tore, yet, as they are  
connected in others of considerable importance,  
which bear essentially oh the conduct of the  
parties in the present war, it ia/mought proper  
to comprise them in the same report  
I’he first of those Resolutions calls for the  
nnmes of the individuals who were selected  
from the Arne ican prisoners of war and sent  
to Great Britain for trial; their places of rcsi„  
■ ence in the United States ; the time when and  
the courts by which they were admitted to  
become Citizens ; the regiments to which they  
belong; when and where they were taken ;  
with copies ol uny official correspondence re*  
specting the treatment of prisoners of war, and  
of any orders for retaliation on either side.  
The other resolutions request information  
of the conduct of t«. Britain towards her native  
subjects, t.ken in armsagainst her, and of th*  
general practice of the nations of Europe, reia*  
Live to naturalization, and the employment ir»  
war, each, of the subjects o. the other; ol th.j ,  
ja-es, wPh their circumstances, in which any *  
:ivihz‘d nation has punished its native sub­  
jects taken in arms against it, for which pun­  
sUinem retaliation v\as inflicted hy the nation  
n whose service they were taken. And fogi.

tncrv ir no evidence in this department, nor is  
there any to shew whether they were nalurali.

paper contains also a copy of the orders of both  
governments Tor retaliation, and of the corres*  
pondonce between their respective Commissa  
ries, concerning the treatment of pri.-oaers.  
Tito paper marked U. states various grounds  
on which the British government has refused  
to deliver up American seamen, impressed into  
the British service, on the application nf the  
agents of the U. States, reguiaily authorized  
to demand them, with the correspondence re­  
lating to the s inie. It communicates also such  
information ns this department has heen able to  
obtain ol the conduct of the British govern,  
ment towards American seamen on board Bri­  
tish ship* of war, at and since the commence­  
ment of the present war. Among the causes  
assigned lor their detention, the following are  
^the most deserving of notice—  
1. Tiiat they had no documeh’s, or that their  
documents were irregular.  
2. That they were released from prisons in­  
Gottcnburg­  
S. That they were exchanged as British sub.  
jects.  
4. Were said to be impostors.  
5. To have married in England.  
6. Did not answer the descriptions given of  
them in their protections.

8. Were sent imo the service fer smug*  
gling.  
9- Were not to be found on board of the ship  
stated.  
10. Had voluntarily entered into the Dritish  
service.  
11. Were natives of foreign countries, Prus­  
sia, Sweden, Italy, &amp;.c.  
It is probable that some of the seamen, whose j  
discharges were demanded, may not have been j  
native citizens of the U. States, but very pre- i  
sumahle that the greater part were. Indeed the  
pretext assigned for their detention seems to  
admit it. Hud they been native subjects of  
England, being there, their origin might have  
been traced, llut that is the ground in lew in  
stances only. In urging that some had no pro*  
tections or that their protections were irregu­  
lar ; that others had been exchanged as British  
prisoners ; were impostors ; had attempted to  
desert ; did not answer th« protections given  
them ; were natives of Prussia, Sweden, &amp;c. it  
is fairly to be inferred that the public authoril}  
in England, to whom this duty is assigned,  
sought rather to evade the application, titan to  
justify the refusal. The pretext that some  
were natives of Prussia, Sweden, &amp;c. deserves  
particular attention. On this circumstance the  
Secretary will remark only, that in extending  
impressment, in American vessels, to persons  
who could not be mistaken for British stibj&lt;cis,  
and refusing to surrender them, on application,  
to the voluntary service from which they were  
taken, it is evident that the recovery of Bri­  
tish seamen has not been the sole object of the  
practice.  
By the report of the American commissary  
ot prisoners in England, it appears that a con­  
siderable number of our seamen had been  
transfi rred from Br.tith shins of war, to pri­  
sons; that their exchange for British seamen  
taken in battle w.is demanded, in the first in­  
stance, hut that that claim seems to have been  
since w veil. It might have been expected that  
the British government, on being satisfied that  
these mr;:, or that any of them, were American  
citizens, would have liberated and sent them  
home at its own charge. They arc, however,  
still held prisoners in confinement. That many  
of them, if not all, are native citizens, cannot  
be doubted, for had the proof not been irresis­  
twble, it cannot be presumed, while so many  
others are detained on board British ships of  
war, that these would have been exempted from  
that service.  
* That many are still detained on board Bri­  
tish ships of war rnay be fairly inferred, even  
•without other evidence, from the indiscrimi­  
nate manner of British impressment ; from  
the distant service in which the men thus  
impressed are often necessarily employed,  
depriving their friends of tin opportunity to  
communicate with them ; and from the in­  
considerable number discharged, compared  
with that which has been demanded. With  
out relying altogether on the reports hereto­  
  
v iiuvaw mi uy yiu» j/i-jMiimnii,  
the letter of Commodore Rodgers, hereunto  
annexed, affords data from which an esti­  
mate may be formed. On this point, the  
correspondence between Genera! Taylor &amp;  
the Captain of the British ship tlie Dragon,  
and Commodore Decatur and the comman*  
der Capel, deserve also particular attenti­  
on. If the British Government would order  
a strict search to be made, through the Bri*  
tish navy, for American seamen, it would  
then be seen how many of our native citizens  
have participated in the lot of the unfortu­  
nate men mentioned in the correspondence  
referred to.  
The contrast which these documents p v  
sent, In the pretensions and conduct of(ir:ut  
Britain, with the pretensions ar.d conduct cf  
the United States, cannot fail to make a deep  
impression in favor of the latter. The Bri­  
tish Government impresses into its Navy,  
native citizens of the United Slates, and com­  
pels them to serve in it, and in many fustan  
ccs even to fight against their c ur.try, while  
it arrests as traitors and menaces with death  
persons suspected to be native British sub  
jects, for having fought under our h andard  
• against British forces, although they had  
voluntarily entered intootif army, after hfu  
ving emigrated to the United States and in­  
corporated themselves into the American  
society. The United Stater, on the other  
hand, have forced no persons into their set­  
vice, nor have they sought, nor aretheydls  
posed to punish any, who, after having i&#x27;rte  
iy emigrated to any part of the British domi­  
nions and settled there, may have entered  
voluntarily into the British army.  
The remaining enquiries relate to objects  
other than the immediate conduct of the pnr  
ties in the present war. They demand in­  
formation of the conduct of Great Britain, flt  
of other powers in past times, without limi­  
tation in the retrospect, in circumstances  
beating on the quest&#x27;r n of retaliate n. The  
information required relates to the folio whig  
Jpoints :  
1. The crndoc&#x27; of Great Britain and the  
other na&#x27;.ions of Europe, as to nauiralizati**  
on, and the employment in war, each, of the  
subjects of the other.  
2. * As to the punishment of their native  
subjects taken in arms against them, in the  
service of other powers  
3. Kxamp&#x27;esof retaliation by the latter in  
such case**.  
These enquiries necc«sar&#x27;:ly involve an ex  
tensive research info the history and jut is­  
prudence of the nations of Europe, lot so  
j important r&gt; task the other duties of the Se­  
, cretarv of State l ave altogether disqualified  
him, since the call whs made. The approach­  
ing close of the session does not leave him  
  
time for more than the following observati­  
ons:  
That all the nations of Europe naturalize  
foreigner* ;  
That they all employ in their service the  
subjects of each other, anti frequently against  
their native countries, even when not regu­  
larly naturalized ;  
That they all allow their own subjects to  
emigrate to foreign countries;  
That altho* examples may he found of the  
punishment of their native subjects taken in  
arms against them, the examples are few,  
and have either been marked by* peculiar  
circumstances, taking them out of toe con­  
troverted principle, or have proceeded from  
the passions or policy of the occasion. Even  
in prosecutions and convictions having the  
latter origin, the final act of punishment has,  
with little exception, been prevented by a  
s-nse of equity and humanity, or a dread of  
retaliation. It is confidently believed that  
no instance can be found in which the al­  
leged purposes of the enemy against the  
twenty three prisoners in question, under all  
the circumstances which belong to their  
cusc, even &#x27;tho* any of them may not have  
been regularly naturalized, are countenan­  
ced by the proceedings of any European na­  
tion ;  
  
1 hat it no instances occur of retaliation in  
the lew cases requiring it, or in any of them,  
!&gt;y the governments employing such per*  
sons, it has been, as is presumed, because  
the punishment which had been inflicte* by  
the native country, might be accounted for  
on some principle o&#x27;her than its denial of  
the right of emigiation and naturalization.  
Had the government employing the persons,  
so punished by their native country, retalia­  
ted in such cases, it might have incurred the  
reproach either of countenancing acknow­  
ledged crimes, or of follow! ig the example  
of the other party in acts of cruelty, exciting  
horror, rather than of fulfilling its pledge  
to innocent persons in support of rights fair  
ly obtained, and sanctioned by the general o­  
pinion and practice of all the nations of Eu­  
rope, ancient and modern.  
Ail which is respectfully submitted.

The Secretary of State, to whom was  
referred several Resolutions of the  
Senate of the 22d of February and 9th  
‘ of March last, ha* the honor to sub­  
mit to the President the following  
REPORT: , f  
Although these Resolutions are ot  
different dates, and refer to subjects in  
tonfe respects di tinct in their nature,  
yet, us they are connected in others of  
considerable importance, which bear es­  
sentially on the conduct of the parties in  
the present war, it is thought proper to  
comprize them in the same report.  
The first of those Resolutions calls for  
the names of the individuals who were  
selected from the American prisoners of  
w:.r and sent to Oreat-Britain for trial;  
their places o! residence in the U.States;  
t,f.e times when and the • arts by which  
they were admitted to become citizen* ;  
tns regiment*&#x27; to which they belong ;  
* when and ‘there they were taken ; with  
copies of any official correspondence re­  
specting the treatment of prisoners of  
war,and of any order* for retaliation on  
*:ther ski**.  
The other resolution* request infor­  
mation, of the conduct of G. Britain to­  
wards her native subjects, token in arms  
against her, and ot the general practice  
o the nations of Europe relative to na  
totalization, 8c the employments in war.  
each, of the subjects of the other; of  
«K&gt; with their circutosiances, in  
  
which any civilized nation has punished  
its native subjects taken in arms against  
it, for which punishment retaliation was  
inflicted by the nation in whose service  
they were taken. And, lastly,  
Under what circumstances &amp; *n what  
grounds G. Britain hai refused to dis­  
charge native citizens of the U. States  
impressed into her service ; and what  
has been her conduct towards American  
teamen on board her ships of war, at and  
since the commencement of tbe present  
war with the United States.  
The paper marked A contains the  
names of the American prisoners who  
were sent to England for trial by the Bri­  
tish Commander in C aoada ; ol the coi ps  
to which they belong j of the times when  
and of the places w here, they were taken  
Of iheir places of residence in the Unit­  
ed Slates ; of the times and the courts in  
which they were admitted to become ci­  
tizens, there i* no evidence in this de­  
partment, nor is there any to shew whe­  
ther they were naturalized or native ci­  
tizens of the United States. 1 his pa«*er  
contains also a copv of the orders ot b«.tb  
governments for retaliation, and ot the  
correspondence between their respec­  
tive commissaries, concerning the treat*  
roent ol prisoners. -  
The paper marked B states various  
grounds on which the British govern­  
ment has refused to deliver up Ameri­  
can seamen, impressed into the Biilish  
service, on the application ot the agents  
of the U States, regularly authorized to  
demand the*, with the correspondence  
relating to the same. It communicates  
also such information as this department  
v baa been able to obtain of the conduct of  
the British government towards Ameri­  
can seamen on board British ships or  
war, at and since the commencement of  
the present war. Among the causes as­  
signed for their detention, the following  
*re the most deserving of notice—  
  
I That they had no documents, or  
« that their documents were irregular,  
3. That they were released trom pri­  
son in Gottenhursf. ,  
S. That they were exchanged aa Bri­  
tish subjects.  
4. Were said to be imposters;  
5. To have married in England. .  
6. T&gt;id not answer the descriptions  
giver* of them in their protections.  
7. Had attempted to desert.  
* 8. Were sent into the service for  
smuggling- . , . , r  
9. Were not to be found on board o,  
tbe ship stated.  
10. Had voluntarily entered into the  
British service.  
H. Wert j atives of foreign countries,  
Prussia, Sweden, Italfy &amp;c­  
It is piotuble that some of the seamen,  
whose discharges were demanded, may  
not have been native citizens of the  
States, but very presumable that the  
greater part were. Indeed the pretext  
assigned for their detention seems to ad­  
roit it Had they been native subject*  
•f England, being thare, their origin  
might have been traced. But that is the  
ground in lew instance* only. In urging  
that some had no protections orthat their  
protection* were irregular ; that others  
had been exchanged as British prison­  
er* ; were imposter!; had attempted to  
dosert ; did not answer the protections  
given the**; nerc natives of Prussia,  
Sweden, Sec it is fairly to be inferred  
that the public authority in Eogrand, &lt;c  
Whom thi* du‘f *• awigned, sought ra­  
ttier to evade the application, t*an to jut­  
tifv the refusal. The pretext thr.* sc^e  
wer* native* of Prussia, Sweden, fcc. de­  
serves particular attention. On this cir­  
cumstance the Secretary will remark  
only, that in extending impressment, in  
American vessels, te persons who ceuld  
J,„; U&#x27; Oiiukw for Bntufe wbjes*, u&gt;d  
  
refuting to tuiretide? them, tn applica­  
tion, to tbe voluntary service from  
which they were taken, it is evident that  
recover? of British seamen has not  
been the sole object of the practice.^  
By the report of the American  
commissary of prisoners in England,  
it appears that a considerable num­  
ber ot our seamen had been transfer­  
red from British ships of war, to j  
prisoners ; that their exchange for  
British seamen taken in battle was  
demanded, in the Srst instance, but  
that claim seems to have been since  
waved. It might have been expect­  
ed that the British government, on  
being Ratified that these men, or that  
any of them, were American citizens*  
would have liberated and sent them  
home at ist on charge. They are,  
however, still held prisoners in con­  
finement. That many of them, ii  
not all, are native citizens, cannot be  
doubted, for bad tbe proof not been  
irresistible, it ennnot be presumed,  
while so many others are deiaiued on  
board British ships of war, that  
these would have been exempted  
from that service. That many are  
still detained on board British ships  
of war may be fairly inferred, eveu  
without other evidence, from the in* j  
discriminate manner nt British im­  
pressment ; from the distant sevioe  
in which the men thus impressed ace  
often necessarily employed, depriving  
their friends of an opportunity to  
communicate with them ; and from  
the inconsiderable number discharg­  
ed, compared with that which hai  
been demanded. Without reiving  
altogether on the reports heretofore  
made to Congress by this Depart- .  
  
ment, the letter of CoiuniiWore  
Rodgers* hereunto annexed, affords  
data from which an estimate may be  
formed. On this point, the, corns­  
pondence between Gen. Taylor and j  
the Captain of the British ship the j  
&gt; llragou, and Com. Decatur and the j  
commander Capel, deserve also par. i  
tieular attention. If the British 1  
Governmeut would order a strict j  
aemli to be made, thro* the British  
navy, for American seamen, it would  
then he seen how many of onr native  
citizens have participated in the lot  
of the unfortunate men mentioned in  
tlie eonespomlece referred to.  
The contrast which these documents  
present, in the pretensions and con­  
duct of Great Britain, with the pro­  
tensions and conduct ot the United  
States, cannot fail to make a deep  
impression in favor of the la&#x27;ter.  
The British Government impresses  
into its \avy native citizens of the  
U. 8. and compels them to serve in  
it. and in many instances even to  
fight against their country, while it  
arrests as traitors and menaces with  
death persons suspected to he native  
British subjects, for having fought  
under our standard against British  
forces, although they had voluntari­  
ly emigrated to the United States A  
incorporated themselves into our ar­  
my, after having emigrated them­  
selves into the American society.  
! The United States, on the ether hand  
have, forced no persons into their  
service, nor have they sought, nor  
are disposed to punish any whs alter  
having freely emigrated to any part  
of the British dominions an^ settled  
Uintxi r»5*w Imvp entered voluntarily  
  
vy -- —  
into the British army.  
The remaining enquiries relate to  
objects other than the immediate con­  
duct of the parlies in thr present war.  
They demand information of live con­  
duct* of Great Britain, and of other  
powers in past times, without limita­  
tion. The information required re­  
lates to the followiwg points : .  
1. The conduct of Great Britain  
and other nations ot Europe, as to  
naturalization, sad the employment  
in war, each, of ihc subjects of the  
cflhcr. *  
2. As to the punishment ol their  
native subjects taken in arms against  
them, ifi the service of other powers.  
S. Examples of retaliation by the  
latter in such cases.  
These enquiries necessarily involve  
an cxten*ivc research into the history  
and jurisprudence of the nations of  
Europe For so important a task  
the other duties of th. Secretary  
of State have altogether disqualified  
him, since the call was made. The  
approaching close of the session does  
not leave him tin* for more tban  
the following obsrvations:  
That all the nations of Europe  
naturalize foreigners; •  
That they all employ in their ser­  
vice the subjects of each other, and  
frequently against their native coun­  
tries, even when not regularly natu­  
ralized ;  
That they all dlow their own sub­  
ject* to emigrate to foreign coun­  
tries ;  
Thatnltbo* examples may be found  
oftbe jjuuwJuttcai wf their native  
  
subject* taken in its arms agaiwt  
them, the examples afe few, and  
have either been marked by peeuliat  
oircumsfnnees, taken them nut of the  
controverted principle, or have pro-^  
ceded from the passions or policy of  
the occasions. Even in prosecutions  
and convictions having the latter  
original, the final act of punishment  
•has, with little exception, been pre­  
vented by a sense of equity and hu­  
manity, or a dread of retaliation,  
ft is confidently beleived that no in­  
stances can be found in which the  
alledged purposes of the cnemyagain9t  
the twenty three prisoners in question,  
under all tin? circumstances which  
belong to their ease, even tho’ any  
of them may have been regalarly  
naturalized, are countenanced by the  
proceeding of any European nation,  
That if no instances occur of reta­  
liation in the few eases requiring it,  
or in any of them, by the goverment  
employing such persons, it has been,  
ns is presumed, because the punish*  
ment which had been inflicted by the  
native eonntry,might be accounted for  
i o i some principle other than its denial  
uf the right of emigration &amp; natu­  
ralize ion. Had the government em­  
«,loyingthoper9ons punished by their  
native country,retaliated in such ca­  
ses, it might have incurred the ap­  
proach either of countenance of ac­  
knowledged crimes, or of following  
the example of the other party in  
arts of cruelty, exciiing horror, ra­  
ther than of fulfilling it* pledge to  
inuoeent persons in support of rights  
fairly obtained, and sanctioned by  
general opinion and praoticc of all  
the nations of Europe, ancient and  
ninilui.n

The Secretary of State, to whom were re­  
ferted several resolutions of the Senate of  
the 2d of February and 9th of March  
last, has the honor to fubwmit to the Prefi­  
_deat, the following™ -~ :  
.~ REPORT : ,  
Although these resolutions are of differ.  
ent dates, and refer to_fubje@s in some re­  
fpe&amp; diftin&amp; in their nature, yet as they  
are conne€ed in ethers of considerable im­  
portance, which bear :éﬂentia;&#x27;l:l:tn the con­  
duét of the parties-in the present war, it is  
thought proper te comprise them in the  
Bmereport, ©2 i e  
- The firlt of these réfolutions calls for the  
riames of the individuals who were feleGted  
from the American prisoners of war and  
sent to G. Britain for trial ; their places of  
residence in the U. States ; the times&#x27; when  
and the coutts by which they wete aditied  
thoy belosg 5 when and where thep were  
Pet SAE g e £ NTi g i  
  
taker ; with copies of any official corres­  
pondence refpe&amp;ing the treatment of prison.  
ers of war, and of any orders for retaliation  
on either fide. -  
The other resolutions request informa.  
tion of the condu@ of G. Britain towards  
her native fubje@s, taken in armns agaiaft  
her ; and of the general pralice of the na­  
tions of Earope relative to naturalization,  
and the employment in war, each of the  
fubjeéts ; the other ; of the cases with their  
circumstances in which any civilized nation  
has punithed its native {ubjes taken in arms  
agaianft it, for which pumfhment retaliation  
was infliCted by the nation in whose service  
they were taken, And lattly—  
Uander what circumstances and on what  
grounds G. Britain has refufed to discharge  
native citizens of the United States impres­  
sed into her service ; and what has beén her  
conduét towards A merican seamen on board  
her ships of war, at and since the commenc.  
m the present war with the United  
- &#x27;The&quot; paper- marked. A, - eontains “the’  
names of the American prisoners &#x27;whao were  
sent to Eogland fortrial by the Britith com­  
mander in Canada ; ¢f the corps to wbjﬁl  
they belong ; of the times when, and of the  
places where they were taken. Of their  
places of refidénce.in the United States ; of  
the times and the courts in which they were  
-admitted to become citizens, there is no. ev­  
idence in this department, nor is there any  
to thew whether they naturalized or  
native citizens of the U%:atcs. This pa-&#x27;  
per contains also 2 copy of the orders of both  
governments for retaliation, and of the cor­  
respondence between their refpeétive com­  
missaries concerning the treatment of prif­  
‘oners. . i  
The paper marked B, fates various  
grounds on which the British government  
bas refufed to deliver up American seamen; &#x27;  
imprefled inte the British service on the ap­  
plication of the agents of the U. States,i  
regularly autherifed to demand them, with  
the correspondence relating to the fame. It  
communicates also f{uch information as this |  
department has been able to obtain of the  
condu&amp; of the British government, towards  
American seamen on board Britifth ships of  
war, at and since the commencemeat of the  
present war, Among the causes afligne- for  
their detention, the fo!lowing are the most  
deserving of notice.:— ’ ‘  
- 1. That they had no documents. or that  
their documents were irregular. ; ‘  
. 2. That they were released from prifon’  
io Gottenburg,” : : ]  
8. That they were exchanged as British  
{ubjefls.  
4. Were {aid to be impostors: &#x27;  
5. To have married in England.  
6. Did not answer the descriptions given  
of them in their prote&amp;ions.  
7. Had attempted to desert.  
8. Were sent into the service for smug­  
gling. &#x27;  
9. Were not to be found on board of the  
ship stated. :  
- 10. Had voluntarily - entered into the  
British service. -  
1. Were natives of foreign countries,  
Prussia, Sweden, Italy, &amp;c.  
~ It 1s probable that some of the seamen  
whose discharges were demanded. may not  
have been native citizens of the U. States,  
but very presumable that the greater part  
were. Indeed the pretext assigned for their  
detention seems to admit it. Had they been  
native fubje@s of England, being there,  
their origin might have been traced. But  
that is the ground in few instances only. In  
urging that {ome had no prote&amp;ion, or that  
their prote®ions were irregular ; that others  
had been exchangedas Britith prisoners ;  
were impostors ; had “attempted to desert ;  
did oot an{wer the protections given them ;  
were natives of Prussia,” Sweden, &amp;c.. it 1»  
fairly to be inferred that the public authori­  
ty in England, to whom this duty 13 aﬂ&#x27;{gn-‘  
ed, fought rather to evade the application,  
thao to jultify the refufal. The pretext that  
some were natives of Prussia, Sweden. &amp;c.  
deserves particular attention. On this cir.  
cumftance the Secretary will remark only,  
that in extending imprefiment, in American  
vessels, to persons who could not be mistak­  
en for Britith fubje@s, and refufing to fur.  
render them, on application, to the volunta-;  
ry service from which they were.taken, it is  
evident that the recovery of British seamen,  
‘has ot been the sole objeét of the pradtice.  
&quot;By the repor ofthe. America comaril  
fary of prisoners in England, it appears that  
a considerable nuniber of our seamen haqd  
been transferred from British thips of war,  
% prifous ; that their exchange for Britith  
seamen taken in battle was demauded, in  
the firft instance, but that that claim seems:  
‘to have been fince’ waved. ~Tt.might have  
been expeéted that the British government,  
on being fatisfied that these men, or that any­  
of them were Amcric;n Eoneel ww‘d&#x27;bﬂ;&amp;  
liberated and sent them home. at its own  
charge. ~They are’ however flill held prif;  
l ‘oners u;foﬁml ‘That many of ‘h“&quot;;  
ifnot. all, are native cjtizens, _snoot be  
doubted, oad the oo ben i

the indiferiminate manner of Britith imprefl.  
ment ; from the distant {eryice in which the  
men thus impressed, are Acn vecetlarilv em­  
ployed, depriving their frieids of an oppor­  
tunity to communicaté with them ; and from  
the inconsiderable number difcha: ged, com­  
pared with that which has been demanded.  
Without relying altogether on the rejorts  
heretofore made to Congress by this depart.-  
ment, the letter of Commodore Rodgers  
hcreunto annexed, affords data from which  
an estimate may be formed. On this point,  
the correlpoidence between Gen. Tavler  
and the Capraincof the British ship the Dra­  
gon, and Com. Decatur and the commander  
Capel deserve also particular attention. If  
the British government would ordera ftrid  
search to be made, through the Britith navy  
for /A merican seamen, it would then be seen  
how maay of our mative citizens have par­  
ticisated in the lot of the wifortunate men  
meitionedin the correfpoi-éence . ferred to.  
* ‘ibeﬁemraﬂ which these documents pre­  
+.in-the pretensions and condu&amp; of G.  
grrt}m, witiy ‘the pretensions and condu&amp; of  
the United States, cannot fail to make a  
deep impression in favor of the fatter. The­  
- gevernment ~impreffes into its navy  
native citizens. of the U. States, and com­  
pels ‘them to serve in it, andn many in=  
stances even to fight against their country,  
while it arefts as traitors and menaces with  
death, persons fufpe@ed to be native British  
fubjeéts, for having fought under our #and.-  
and against Bririfh forces, although they had  
voluntarily entered into our aimy, after hav­  
iag emigrated to the United States and in­  
corporated themselves into the American  
Saciety. The United States oy the other  
hand have forced no person into their ser­  
vice, nor have they fought, nor are they  
disposed to.punifh any, who, after having  
freely emigrated to any part of the Britith  
deminions and fettled there, may have en.  
tered volumtarily into the Britith army,  
The remaining enquiries relate to obje&amp;ts  
other than the immediate condu&amp; of the  
parties in the present war. They demand  
information of the condu&amp; of G. Britain, &amp;  
of other powers in palt times, without limi.  
tation in the retrofpe, in circumstances,  
bearing on the question of retaliation. The  
information reqaired relates to the follow.  
ing pornts : | ;  
1. The condu@ of Great Britain and the  
‘other nations of Europe, as to naturalization  
and the employment of war, each of the  
fubje&amp;s of the other. -  
. 2. Asto the punifiment of their native  
fubje@ts taken’in ‘arms against them in the  
{ervice of other powers.  
t 8. Examples of retaliation by the latter  
} in {uch cases. I  
~ These enquiries necessarily involve an ex.  
‘tenfive research into the hitory and juri{pru.  
dence of the nations of Europe. For o im­  
portant a task, the other duties of the Sec.  
retary of State, bave altegether disqualificd  
him, since the call was made. The ap­  
proaching close of the {effion does not leave  
him time for more than the following obfers  
vations : : .  
That all the pations of Europe nituralize  
foreigners 3 | TR :  
- That they all employ in their service the  
fubje@s of each other, and frequently a.  
gainft their native countries, even when ot  
regularly naturalized ; / .. |  
That they all allow their own fubjeéts to  
emigrite to foreign eountries ;  
That althongh examples may be found  
of the punishment of their native fubjeéis  
taken in arms against them, the examples  
are few, and have either been marked by pe.  
culiar circumstances, taking them out of the  
controverted principle, or having proceeded  
from the passions or policy of the occafioa,  
Even in prosecution ; and conviétions have  
ing the latter origin, the fm;{l a&amp; of pun.  
ifhment, ha gy with little exception, been pre.  
veuted by a ieafe of equity and humaniey,  
or a dread of retaliation.— It is confidently  
believed that no instance can be found in  
‘which the alledged purpoles of the enemz

IThe secretary of state^ to whom was referred  
several resolutions qf&#x27;lhe senate of the second  
of Felrruaryy and ninth (f March lust^ has  
the honour to suhmit to tlu president the fol¬  
lowing report :  
  
Although [these resolutions are of different  
dates, and rjefe.r to subjects in some respects  
distinct in tfieir nature, yet as they are con¬  
nected in others of considerable importance,  
which bear essentially on the conduct of the  
parties in the present war, it is thought pro¬  
per to comprise them in the same report.  
  
The first of these resolutions calls for the  
names of the individuals who were selected  
from the American prisoners of ivar, and sent  
Ho Great Britain for trial; their places of re-  
«ideucc in the United States; the-times when,

to become citizens; the regiments to which  
they belong ;. w hen and where they were ta¬  
ken ; with copies of any official correspon¬  
dence respecting the treatment of prisoners  
of war, and of any orders for retaliation on  
either side.  
  
The other resolutions request information of  
the conduct of Great Britain towards her ac¬  
tive subjects, taken in arms against her, and  
of the general practice of the nations of Eu¬  
rope, relative to naturalization, and the em¬  
ployment in war, each of the subjects of the  
other : of the cases, witli their circumstances,  
ill which any civilized nation has punished its  
uative subjects, taken in arms against it for.  
yrhich punishment retaliation was inflicted by  
ihe nation in whose service they were taken,  
^d lastly.  
  
Under what circumstances, and on what  
{grounds; Great-Britain has refused to dis¬  
charge native citizens of the United States  
impressed into her service ; and what has  
Aieen her conduct&#x27; towards American seamen  
on board her ships of war, at and since the  
commencement of the present war with the  
United States.  
  
The paper marked A, contains the names  
of the American prisoners, who were sent  
^ to England for trial, by the British com¬  
  
mander in Canada; of the corps to whicli  
they belong; of the times when, and of the  
places where, they were taken. Of their  
places of residence in the United States : of  
the times, and the courts in which tliey.werc  
admitted to become citizens there is no evi¬  
dence in this department, nor is there any to  
1 show whether they were naturalized, or iia-  
I tive citizens of the United .States. This pa¬  
per contains also, a copy of the orders of both  
governments for retaliation, and of the corres¬  
pondence between their respective commis¬  
saries concerning the treatment of prisoners.  
  
The paper marked B, states various grounds  
on whicli tile British government has refused  
to deliver up American seamen, impressed  
into the British serviee, on the ap[»!iratioii of  
the agents of the United Stales, regularly au¬  
thorized to demand them, with the eorrespon-  
I dftiicc relating to the same. It communicates  
also, such information as this department has  
been able to obtain of the conduct of the Bri¬  
tish government, towards American seamen  
on board Birtish ships of war, at and since  
the commencement of the present war.  
.\mong the causes assigned for their detention,  
the following are the most deserving of no¬  
tice :  
  
1. That they Iiad no documents, or that  
their documents were irregular.  
  
2. That they were released from prison in  
Gottenhurg.  
  
3. That they were exchanged as British  
subjects.  
  
4. Were said to be impostors.  
  
ft. To have married in Kiigland.  
  
C. Did not answ^er the diseriptions given of  
them in their protections.  
  
7. Ifad attempted to desert.  
  
8. Were sent into tlie service for smug-  
gling.  
  
9. Were not to be found on board of the  
ship stated.  
  
10. Had voluntarily entered into the Bri¬  
tish service.  
  
11. Were natives of foreign countries,  
Prussia, Sweden, Italy, &amp;c.  
  
It is probable, that some of the seamen  
whose discharges were demanded, may not  
have been native citizens of the United States,  
but very presumable the greater part were.  
Indeed the pretext assigned for their deten¬  
tion seems to admit it. Had they been na¬  
tive subjects of England, being there, their  
origin might have been traced. But that is  
the ground in a few instances only. In urging  
that some had no protections, or that their  
protections were irregular; that others had  
been exchanged as British prisoners; were  
impostors; had attempted to desert; did not  
answer the protections given them ; were na¬  
tives of Prussia, Sweden, &amp;c. it is fairly to be  
inferred that the public authority in England,  
to whom this duty &quot;is assigned, sought rather  
to evade the application, than to justify the  
refusal* The pretext that some were natlYOi
