And if he be also a proficient in the Greek, let that too be stated in his Diploma, the intention being that the reputation of the University shall not be committed but to those who, to an eminence in some one or more of the sciences taught in it, add a proficiency in these languages which constitute the basis of good education, and are indispensable to fill up the character of a “well educated man.”

.  
The major punishments of expulsion from the University, temporary suspension of attendance and presence there, or interdiction of residence or appearance within it’s precincts, shall be decreed by the professors themselves. Minor cases may be referred to a board of six Censors, to be named by the Faculty, from among the most discreet of the Students, whose duty it shall be, sitting as a Board, to enquire into the facts, propose the minor punishment which they think proportioned to the offence, and to make report thereof to the Professors for their approbation, or their commutation of the penalty, if it be beyond the grade of the offence. These Censors shall hold their offices until the end of the session of their appointment, if not sooner revoked by the Faculty.  
Inattendance on school, inattention to the exercises prescribed, and misbehavior or indecorum in school shall be subject to any of the minor punishments; and the professor of the school may singly reprove, impose a task, or dismiss from the room for the day.  
Habits of expence, of dissoluteness, dissipation, or of playing at games of chance, being obstructive to the acquisition of science by the student himself and injurious, by example to others, shall be subject, in the first instance, to admonition and reproof to the offender, and to communication &amp; warning to the parent or guardian; and, if not satisfactorily corrected, to a refusal of further continuance at the University.  
No Student shall make any festive entertainment within the precincts of the University, nor contribute to, or be present at them there or elsewhere, but with the consent of each of the Professors whose school he attends, on pain of a minor punishment.  
No Student shall admit any disturbing noises in his room, or make them any where within the precincts of the University, or fire a gun or pistol within the same, on pain of such minor sentence as the faculty shall decree or approve, but the proper use of musical instruments, shall be freely allowed in their rooms, and in that appropriated for instruction in music.  
Riotous, disorderly, intemperate or indecent conduct of any student within the precincts shall be punished by interdiction of a residence within the precincts; and repetitions of such offences, by expulsion from the University.  
Fighting with weapons which may inflict death, or a challenge to such fight, given or accepted, shall be punished by instant expulsion from the University, not remissible by the Faculty; and it shall be the duty of the Proctor to give information thereof to the civil magistrate, that the parties may be dealt with according to law.  
Offences cognisable by the laws of the land shall be left to the cognisance of the civil magistrate, if claimed by him, or otherwise to the judgment of  
  
the Faculty: all others to that of the Faculty, and such of these as are not specially designated in the enactments of the Visitors may be subjected by the Faculty to any of the minor punishments permitted by these enactments.  
Sentences of expulsion from the University (except in the case of challenge or combat with arms) shall not be final until approved by the board of Visitors or, when they are not in session, by a majority of them, separately consulted. But residence within the precincts, and attendance on the schools may be suspended in the mean time.

When a Professor knocks at the door of a student’s room, any person being within, and announces himself, it shall be opened, on pain of a minor punishment; and the Professor may, if refused, have the door broken open; and the expences of repair shall be levied on the Student, or Students within.  
At the hour appointed for the meeting of every school, the roll of the school shall be called over, the absentees, and those appearing tardily, shall be noted, and if no sufficient cause be offered, at the rising of the school, to the satisfaction of the Professor, the notation shall stand confirmed, and shall be given in to the Faculty, the presiding member of which for the time being shall, on the 15th. days of May, August and December, or as soon after each of these days as may be, transmit by mail a list of these notations to the parent or guardian of each delinquent.  
When testimony is required from a Student, it shall be voluntary, and not on oath, and the obligation to give it shall be left to his own sense of right.  
Should the religious sects of this state, or any of them, according to the invitation held out to them, establish within, or adjacent to, the precincts of the University, schools for instruction in the religion of their sect, the students of the University will be free, and expected to attend religious worship at the establishment of their respective sects, in the morning, and in time to meet their school in the University at it’s stated hour.  
The Students of such religious school, if they attend any school of the University, shall be considered as Students of the University, subject to the same regulations, and entitled to the same rights and privileges.
