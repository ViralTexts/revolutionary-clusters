States March 30th 1796.  
Gentlemen of the House of Representatives.  
  
With the utmost attention, I have considered your resolution of the twenty fourth instant, requesting me to lay before your House, a copy of the instructions to the Minister of the United States, who negociated the treaty with the king of Great Britain, together with the correspondence and other documents relative to that treaty, excepting such of the said papers, as any existing negociation may render improper to be disclosed.  
In deliberating upon this subject, it was impossible for me to lose sight of the principle, which some have avowed in its discussion, or to avoid extending my views to the consequences, which must flow from the admission of that principle.  
I trust, that no part of my conduct has ever indicated a disposition to withhold any information, which the constitution has enjoined upon the President, as a duty, to give, or which could be required of him by either House of Congress, as a right; and with truth, I affirm, that it has been, as it will continue to be, while I have the honor to preside in the government, my constant endeavor to harmonize with the other branches thereof; so far as the trust, delegated to me by the people of the United States, and my sense of the obligation it imposes “to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution,” will permit.  
The nature of foreign negociations requires caution; and their success must often depend on secrecy: and even when brought to a conclusion, a full disclosure of all the measures, demands, or eventual concessions, which may have been proposed or contemplated, would be deemed impolitic; for this might have a  
  
pernicious influence on future negociations, or produce immediate inconveniences, perhaps danger and mischief, in relation to the other powers. The necessity of such caution and secrecy was one cogent reason for vesting the power of making treaties, in the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate; the principle, on which that body was formed, confining it to a small number of members. To admit, then, a right in the House of Representatives, to demand, and to have, as a matter of course, all the papers respecting a negociation with a foreign power, would be, to establish a dangerous precedent.  
It does not occur, that the inspection of the papers asked for can be relative to any purpose under the cognizance of the House of Representatives, except that of an impeachment; which the resolution has not expressed. I repeat, that I have no disposition to withhold any information, which the duty of my station will permit, or the public good will require to be disclosed; and, in fact, all the papers affecting the negociation with Great Britain were laid before the Senate, when the treaty itself was communicated for their consideration and advice.  
The course, which the debate has taken, on the resolution of the House, leads to some observations on the mode of making treaties under the constitution of the United States.  
Having been a member of the general convention, and knowing the principles, on which, the constitution was formed, I have ever entertained but one opinion on this subject; and from the first establishment of the government, to this moment, my conduct has exemplified that opinion, that the power of making treaties is exclusively vested in the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate; provided two thirds of the Senators present concur; and that every treaty so made, and promulgated, thenceforward became the law of the land. It is thus, that the treaty-making power has been understood by foreign nations; and in all the treaties made with them, we have declared, and they have believed, that, when ratified by the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate, they became obligatory. In this construction of the constitution, every House of Representatives has heretofore acquiesced, and, until the present time, not a doubt or suspicion has appeared to my knowledge, that this construction was not the true one. Nay, they have more than acquiesced; for, till now, without controverting the obligation of  
  
such treaties, they have made all the requisite provisions for carrying them into effect.  
There is also reason to believe, that this construction agrees with the opinion entertained by the State conventions, when they were deliberating on the constitution, especially by those who objected to it; because there was not required, in commercial treaties, the consent of two thirds of the whole number of the members of the Senate, instead of two thirds of the Senators present; and because, in treaties respecting territorial and certain other rights and claims, the concurrence of three fourths of the whole number of the members of both Houses, respectively, was not made necessary.  
It is a fact declared by the General Convention, and universally understood, that the constitution of the United States was the result of a spirit of amity and mutual concession. And it is well known, that under this influence, the smaller States were admitted to an equal representation in the Senate, with the larger States; and that this branch of the government was invested with great powers: for, on the equal participation of those powers, the sovereignty and political safety of the smaller States were deemed essentially to depend.  
If other proofs than these, and the plain letter of the constitution itself, be necessary to ascertain the point under consideration, they may be found in the journals of the General Convention, which I have deposited in the office of the department of State. In these journals, it will appear, that a proposition was made, “that no treaty should be binding on the United States, which was not ratified by a law”: and that the proposition was explicitly rejected.  
As, therefore, it is perfectly clear to my understanding, that the assent of the House of Representatives is not n[e]cessary to the validity of a treaty: as the treaty with Great Britain exhibits, in itself, all the objects requiring legislative provision, and on these, the papers called for can throw no light; and as it is essential to the due administration of the government, that the boundaries, fixed by the constitution between the different departments, should be preserved: a just regard to the constitution, and to the duty of my office, under all the circumstances of this case, forbid a compliance with your request.  
  
Go. Washington

“ With the utmost attention I have  
considered your resolution of the e4th

any existing negouation may render im­  
proper to be disclosed.  
«¢ In deliberating on this fubje&amp;, it was  
impossible for me to lose fight of the prin­  
ciple which some have avowed in its dif­  
cuflion, or to avoid extending my views to  
‘the consequences which mu%i flow- from  
the admifgon of that principle.

has ever indicated a disposition to withhold  
any information which the Constitution  
has enjoined upon the&#x27;Prefident as a duty  
to give, or which could be required of him  
by either House of Congress as a right ;  
and with truth 1 affirm, that it has been,  
as it will continue to be, while 1 have the  
honour to preside in the Government, my  
constant endeavour to harmonize with the  
other branches thereof, {o far as the trust  
delegated to me by the people of the Uni­  
ted g(ates, and my sense of the obligation  
it imposes, to *¢ preferve—prote&amp;, and  
defend the Conflitution” will permit.  
¢ The nature of foreign negotiations  
requires caution ; and their fuccels must  
often depend upon secrecy, and even when  
brought to a conclusion, a full disclosure  
of all the mealures, demands, or eventual  
conceflions which may have been propo­  
sed or contemplated, would be extremely  
impolitic ; for this might have a perni­  
cious influence ¢n future negotiations, or  
produce immediatc inconveniencies ; per­  
haps danger and milchief, in relation to  
oither powers. The necessity of such cau­  
tion and secrecy, was one cogent reason for  
vesting the power of making treaties in the  
President, with the advice and consent of  
the Senate ; the principle on which that  
body was formed, confining it to a {mall  
pumber of members. To admit then, a  
right in the Houle of Representatives to  
demand, and to have, as a matter of course,  
all the papers relpefting a negatiation with  
a foreign power, would be to eftablith a  
dangerous precedent. . siae FHE TR

disposition to withhold any information’  
which the duty of my fation will permit,

be extremely impolitic ; for this might have a  
pernicious influence on future nrgociations ;

erof making treaties in the PieGdent, witnthe  
advice aikd con icnt ot the Senate, the principle  
on which ihit body was toimed confining it to  
a fmall number of members. To admit, then,  
a right in the Houle ot Rerelentatives to de  
mand, and to hve as a maitei of courfe, all  
the papers, refpecliog a negotiation with a fo  
reign power, would be to eltabhlh a dangerous  
piecedent.

and with the advice and confent of the Senate,  
provided two thirds, of the Senators preleni  
concur ; and that every treaty fo made and

Jentatives of the United States.,  
Gentlemen +f the House of Representatives,  
- With the utmost attention ‘1 have  
considered your resolution of the g4th  
inst. requelting me to lay before your  
House a copy of the inftrutions” to the  
Minister of the United States, who nego­  
tiated the treaty with the King of Great-  
Britain, together with the correspondence  
and other documents relative to that trea­  
ty, excepting such of the said papers as  
any existing negotiation may render im­  
proper to be difclofed.# |  
* In deliberating on this fubje®®, it was  
impofiiblz for me to lose fight of the prin:  
ciple which some have avowed in its dist  
cuflion, or to avoid.extending my views to  
the consequences which- muﬁ flow&#x27; from  
the admil?xon of that principle. &#x27; {9  
¢ I trust that no part of my conduét  
bls ever indicated a disposition to withhold  
any information which the Constitution”  
has enjoined upon the President as a duty  
to give, or which could be required of hirn  
by either House of Congrels as a right ;  
and with truth 1 afßrm, that it has béen,  
as 1t will continue t 0 be, while 1 have the  
honour to preside ia the Government, my  
-constant endeavoar to harmonize with the  
other branches thereof, so far as the trust  
dclegated to me by the people of the Uni­  
ted States, and my fenfc of the obligation  
itimpofes, to ¢¢ prelerve—prote&amp;, and  
defend the Constitution” will permit.  
¢ The nature of foreign negotiations  
requires caution ; and their fuccels must  
often depend upon secrecy, and even when  
brought to 2 conclusion, a full difciofure  
. of all the measures, demands, or eventual  
conceflions which may bave been propo­  
- {ed or contemplated, would be extremely  
impolitic ; for this might have a perm­  
cious influence on future negotiations, or  
produce immediate inconveniencies ; per­  
haps danger and mifchief, in relation to  
other powers. The sieceflity of such cau­  
tion and {ecrecy, was one cogent realon for  
vesting the power of making treaties in the  
President, with the advice and consent of  
the Senate ; the principje on which that  
. ‘body was formed, confining it to a small  
number of members. To admit then, a  
night in the House of Representatives to  
demand, and to have, as 2 matter of course,  
all the papers relpefling anegotiation with  
a foreign pewer, would be to eflablith a  
~dangerous: precedent. . . -  
.** Lt does not occur, that the infpeftion  
“of the papers asked for, can be reiative ta­  
any purpose under the cognizanee of the  
House of Reprelentatives, except that of  
an impeachment, which the resolution has  
not exprefled, I repear, that I have no  
difpolition to withhold any information  
which the duty of my flatica will permit,  
or.the pubiic good shall tequire, to be dif­  
‘¢lofed ; and in fa&amp;, all the papers affec­  
ting the negotiation. with-Grreat Britain,  
were laid before the- Senate, when the  
treaty itfelf was commupicated® for their  
- conlideration and advite. e  
“The ¢courfe which the debate has ra­  
ken, oo the refolutipn of the Houle, leads  
to some obfervations.on the mode of ma-.  
king treaties under the conflitution of the  
United States. - ot ‘  
_““Maving been a member of the Genegal  
Convention, and ktiowing the principles o  
which the conflitution was formed, I have  
- ever entertained but ove opinion on this  
fubje&amp;t ; and from the ﬁ‘:g‘ eftablithment  
of the government to this thoment; my  
éqﬁuéﬁas. excmpﬁﬁtﬂ’lﬁm that  
the power of making treaties is exclusively.  
vested in the Prelident, by and with the  
advice of the Senate, provided two thirds  
-of the Sm«;u present o and that  
cvery ticaty o madeg and promulgated,  
thence forward became tbcl’w:‘:bf thc’gland;  
1t is thus that the treaty making power has  
beea underfiood by foreign nations ; and  
  
in all treaties made with them, we have  
- declared, and they have believed, that  
- when ratified by the President, with the  
I advice and coafent of the Senate, tbgy be­  
came obligatory. In this conftruftion of  
the conflitution, every Houle of Repre­  
sentatives has heretofore acquielced ; and  
until the present timey not a doubt or ful­  
picion has appeared to my knowlege,  
that this’ coniftruftion was not the true  
one. Nay, they have mare than acquiel-,  
ced ; for until now, without controver­  
ting the obligation of such -treaties, they  
have made all the requisite. provisions for  
carrying them into effeét. =  
- ¢ THere is also reason to believe that  
this canftrultion agrees, with the opinions  
entertained by the State Conventions,  
when they were deliberating on the consti­  
tution ; especially by thole who objefted  
to ity becaule there was _not required in  
commercial treaties, the consent of two  
thirds of the whole number of the Senate,  
.instead of two thirds of the Senators pre­  
sent ; and because n treaties relpelting  
territorial .and certain other rights and  
claims, the concurrence of three fourths of  
the whole number of the members of both  
houses refpettively was not made neceffa-  
IY.  
B Itisa salt declared by the general  
‘convention, and universally understood,  
that the constitution of the United States  
was the result of a {pirit of amity and mu­  
tual conceflion. And it is well known  
that under this influence, the smaller states  
: were admitted to an equal representation  
in the Senate, with the larger States ; and  
that this branch of the government was  
nvefled with great powers, for on the e­  
qual participauon of those powers the so­  
vereignty and polinical fafety of the {mall­  
er States were deemed eflentially to depend.  
. ¢¢ 1f other proofs than these, and :the  
plain letter of the conflitution itfelf,” be  
neceflary to alcertain the point under con­  
sideration, they may be found in the jour­  
nals of the general convention which I  
have deposited in the office of the depart­  
ment of Siate. In thole journals it will  
appear, that a proposition was made, *‘that  
no treaty should be bioding on the Uaited  
States which was not ratufied by a law ;  
‘¢ and that the proposition” was explicitly  
rejetted.  
¢ As, theréfore, 1t is perfellly clear of  
- my understanding, that the aflent of the  
- House of Reprelentatives is not neceflary  
&#x27; to the vahidity of atreaty, as the treaty with  
~ &amp;reat Britain exhibits in itfelf, all the ob­  
je&amp;t requiring legislative provision ; and  
- on thele the papers called for can throw  
no light ; andasitis eflfcnual to the.due  
administration of the government, that  
the boundaries fixed by the constitution,  
- between the- different departments should  
be prelerved—a just regard to the conili­  
tution, and to the duty of my office, under,  
all the circumstances of this case, forbid a  
compliance with your request.” .

¢ To the Houle of Repreientatives, Wed-  
nefday, the 30th March.  
  
© Gentlemen of the Houle of Reprefen-  
  
tatives,  
  
¢ With the utmoft attention I have con-  
fidered your refolution of the 24th inft. re-  
quefting me to lay before your houle, a  
copy of the inftruétions to the mimiter of  
the United States, who negociated the  
treaty with the king of Great Britain, to-  
gether with the correfpondence, and other  
documents relative to that treaty, excepting  
fuch of the faid papers as any exiiting ne-  
gociation may render improper to be dif-  
cloled.  
  
* In deliberating on this fubje&amp;, it was  
impoffible for me to lofe fight ef the prin-  
ciple which fome have avowed in its ditcuf-  
fion, or to avoid extending my views to the  
confequences which mult flow from the ad-  
miffion of that principle.  
  
© I truft, that no part of my conduét has  
ever indicated a difpofition to withhold any  
information which the conititution has en-  
joined upon the prefident as a duty to give,  
or which could be required of him by either  
houfe of congrefs as a sight; and, with  
be  
  
truth, I affirm, that it has been, as it will  
continue to be, while I have the honour to  
prefide in the government, my conftant en-  
deavour to harmonize with the other  
branches thereof, fo far as the truft dele-  
gated to me by the people of the United  
States, and my fente of the obligation it  
impofes to ‘* preferve, protect, and defend  
the conftitution,” will permit.  
  
* The nature of foreign negociations ree  
quires caution ;° and their fuccefs mutt of-  
ten depend on fecrecy; and even when  
brought to a conclufion, a full difclofure  
of all the meafures, demands, or eventual  
conceffions, which may have been propofed  
or contemplated, would be extremely im-  
politic ; for this might have a pernicious  
influence on future negociations, or pro-  
duce immediate inconveniencies ;_ perhaps,  
danger and mifchief, in relation to other  
powers. The neceflity of fuch caution  
and fecrecy was one cogent reafon for  
vefting the power of making treaties in the  
prefident, with the advice and confent of  
the fenate; the principle on which that  
body was formed, confining it to a fmall  
number of members. To admit then a  
right in the houfe of. reprefentatives to de-  
mand, and to have as a matter of courfe,  
all the papers refpeéting a negociation with  
a foreign power, would be to eftablifh a  
dangerous precedent.  
  
* It does not occur, that the infpection  
of the papers afked for, can be relative to  
any purpofe under the cognizance of the  
houte of reprefentatives, except that of an  
impeachment, which the refolution has not  
exprefied. T repeat, that I have no difpo-  
fition to withhold any information which  
the duty of my tation will permit, or the  
public good fhall require to be difclefed s  
  
  
  
  
  
358  
  
and, in fa&amp;, all the papers affe&amp;ting the  
negociation with Great Brita, were laid  
before the fenate, when the treaty itfeif  
was communicated for their confideration  
and advice.  
  
* The courfe which the debate has taken  
on the retoluticn of the houfe, leads to fome  
obfervation, on the mode of making treaties  
under the coniftitution of the United States.  
  
* Having been a anember of the general  
convention, and knowing the principles on  
which the conftitution was formed, I have  
never entertained but one opinion on this  
fubje&amp; ; and from the firit eftablifhment of  
the government to this moment, my con-  
dué has exemplified that opinion, that the  
power of making treaties is exchutively  
vefted in the prefident, by and with the ad-  
vice of the fenate, provided two-thirds of  
the fenators prefent concur ; and that every  
treaty fo made and promulgated, thence-  
forward became the law of the land. It is  
thus, that the treaty-making power has  
been underftood by foreign nations; and  
in all treaties made with them, we have  
declared, and they have believed, that  
when ratified by the prefident, with the ad-  
vice and content of the fenate, they became  
obligatory. In this conitruétion of the  
conttitution, every houfe of reprefentatives  
has heretofore acquiefced’; and until the  
prelent time, not a doubt or fufpicion has  
appeared to my knowledge, that this con-  
ftrugtion was not the true one. Nay, they  
have more than acquiefced; for, until now,  
without controverting the obligation of  
fuch treaties, they have made all the re-  
quilite provifions for carrying them into  
effect.  
  
* There is alfo reafon to believe, that  
this conftruétion agrees with the opinions  
entertained by the itate conventions, when  
they were deliberating on the conititution,  
eipecially by thofe who objected to it, be-  
caule there was not required in commeicial  
treaties the confent of two-thirds of the  
whole fenate, inftead of two-thids of the  
fenators prefent; and becaufe in treaties  
refpetting territorial and certain other rights  
and claims, the concurrence of three-  
fourths of the whole number of the mem-  
bers of both houtes refpeétively was not  
made necefflary.  
  
* It isa faét, declared by the general  
convention, and univerfally underitood,  
that the conftitution of the United States  
was the refult of a {pirit of amity and mu-  
tual conceflion. And it is well known,  
that under this influence, the fmaller ttates  
were admitted to an equal reprefentation in  
the fenate with the larger ftates ; and that  
this branch of the government was invefed  
  
THE UNIVERSAL MAGAZINE.  
  
with great powers, for, on the equal par,  
ticipation of thoté powers, the fovereignty  
and political fitety of the fimaller {tates  
were deemed effentially to depend.  
  
© If other proofs than thefe, and the  
p&#x27;ain letter of the conftitution itfelf, be ne-  
ceffary to afcertain the point under conti-  
deration, they may be found in the jour-  
nals of the general convention, which {  
have — in the office of the depart-  
ment of ftate. In thole journals it will  
appear, that a propofition was made, * that  
no treaty fhould be binding on the United  
States which was not ratified by a law,&quot;  
and that the propofition was explicit!  
rejetted. prop: ony  
  
‘ As, therefore, it is perfcétly clear to  
my underitanding, that the affent of the  
houfe of reprefentatives is not neceffary to  
the validity of a treaty; as a treaty with  
Great Britain exhibits im itfelf all the ob-  
jets requiring legiflative provifion, and on  
which thefe papers called forcan throw no  
light ; and as it is effential to the due ad-  
miniftration of the government, that the  
boundaries fixed by the conitituton be-  
tween the different departments fhould be  
prefer ved —a juft regard to the conftitution,  
and to the duty of my office, under all the  
circumftances of this cafe, forbid a com-  
pliance with your requeft.

•&#x27; Gentlemen ofthe House of Repre­  
sentatives,  
11 With the utmoft attention I have  
confidered your refolution of the twenty  
fourth inftant, requesting me to lay be­  
y vi Houfe, a copy of the inftiudi­  
ona, to the. inifter of the United  
Stats, who negotiated the treaty with  
the King of Great-Biitain, together  
with In- correfpondence and other docu­  
ments relative to that treaty, excepting  
fuch of the laid papers, as any exifting  
negotiation may render improper to be  
difclofed. In deliberating upon this  
-&#x27;-bjed, i: wns impoffible for me to life  
in.-ple, which lone Have  
avow-d in it, difcufli &gt;n, or to avoid ex­  
tending my v ews to the confi qu.-nct s  
which mull flow from the ad million of  
that pi)  
&quot; I Tuft tint no part of my conduct  
has ever indicated a difpofjti.n to with­  
hold any i- formation which the confti­  
tution has enj ined upiii the Prefident  
  
required of him by either Houfe of  
C &lt;ngrefß as a right ; and- with truth I  
.(Firm, that it ba. been, as it will con-  
X: to be while 1 have the honour to  
cie in the government my confi.nt  
avour to harmonize with the other  
ches thereof; fo far as the truft de­  
ted to me by the people of the Uni-  
Jtates, and my fenfe of the obligati­  
: impoles, to prefcrve, protect and  
defend the conftitution, will permit.  
&quot; The nature of foreign negotiations  
requires caution ; and their fuccefs muft  
often depend on fecrecy : and even  
when brought to a conclufion, a full  
I difclofure of all the meafures, demands,  
!or eventual conceflions which may have  
been .propofed or contemplated, would  
be extremely impolitic : tor this might  
have a pernicious influence on future  
negotiations&#x27;, or produce immediate in­  
conveniences; perhaps danger and mii­  
cbief, in relation to other powers. The  
j neceflity of fuch caution and fecrecy  
■ cogent reafon for veiling the  
making treaties in the Prcfi­  
h the advice and confent ofthe  
;fte principle on which that body  
ed confining it to a lui-11 num­  
mbers. To admit then a right  
oufe of Reprefentatives, to de­  
mand and to have as a matter of courfe,  
all the papers, refpe__ing a negotiation, ,  
with a f reign power, would be to ef­  
tablifi) a dangerous precedent.  
&quot; It does not occur, that the infpec­  
tioo of the papers afked for, can be re­  
lative to any purpofe tinder the cogni­  
zance of the Houfe of Reprefentatives,  
except that of an impeachment ; which  
the re(oltition has not exprefled.—l re­  
peat that I have no difpofition to with­  
hold any information which the duty of  
Imy ftation will permit, or the public  
good fliiill requite to be difdofed ; and  
m fact all the papers affecTing the nego­  
tiation with Great Britain were laid be­  
fore the Senate, when the treaty itfelf  
I was communicated for their confiderati­  
on and advice,  
j M The courfe which the d:br,t- has  
tken, on the refolution ofthe Houfe,  
leads to fome obfervations on the mode  
&lt;)f making treaties under the conftituti­  
on of the Unit.-d States.  
v Having been a member of the ge­  
neral convention, and knowing the prin-  
I ciples on which the conflitution was  
formed, I have ever entertained but one  
opinion on this fubjedt ; and from the  
£ift eftabli fiiment of the government to  
this moment, my conduct has exemplifi­  
ed that opinion, that the power of mak­  
ing treaties is exclusively ye lied in the  
Pn fident, by and with the advice and  
confer.t of the Senate, provided that  
two thirds of the Senators prefent con­  
cur ; and that every treaty fo made, mid  
promulgated, thenceforward becomes the  
law of the land. It is thus that the  
treaty making power has been under­  
flood by foreign nations ; and in all the  
treaties, made with them, we have de­  
clared and they have believed, that  
when ratified by the Prefident, with the  
advice and confent of the Senate, th&#x27;-y  
became obligatory. In this con.trU-.ion  
nf Sdie conflitution, every Houfe of Re­  
prefentatives has heretofore acqutefced,  
and until the prefent time, rrot a doubt  
or luipicioii has appeared to my know­  
ledge, that this conf.iuc~.ion was not the  
true one. Nay, they have more than  
acquiefced ; for till now, without con­  
troverting the obligation of fuch trea­  
ties, they have made all the requilite  
provifions for carrying them into ef­  
&quot; There is alfo reafon to believe, that  
this conftrucYion agrees with the opini­  
ons enteita&#x27;ned by the ftate conventi­  
ons, when they were deliberating on the  
conftitution, efpecially by thofe who ob­  
jected to it, becaufe there wa. not re­  
quired, in commercial treaties the con­  
f-ntof two thirds of the whole number  
of the members of the Senate, inftead  
of two thirds of the Senators prefent,  
and becaufe in treaties refpetli-ig terri­  
torial and certain other rights and  
claims, the concurrence ef three fourths  
ot the whole number of the members of |  
both houfes respectively, was not made  
neceffary, is a fa_l declared by the ge­  
j neral convention, and univerfally under­  
that the conflitution ofthe Uni­  
ted States was the refult of a fpirit of  
amity and mutud conteft,ion —-And it is  
well known that under this influence the  
.mailer flutes were admittd to an ec ual  
repi &gt; it.-ii tat ion in the Senate, with the  
larger ftates, and that this branch of the  
government was invelted with great  
powers, for on the equal participation of I  
thofe nowers, the fovereignty and politi­  
cal fafety of the fmaller ftates were  
deemed effentially to depend.  
&quot; If other proofs than thefe, and tbe  
plain letter of the conflitution itfelf, be  
neceffary to afcertain the point under  
cmifideration, they may be found in the  
journals of the general convention,  
which I have depofited in the office of  
the department of ftate. In thofe jour­  
nals it will appear that a propofition  
was made, tnat no treaty fhould be bind­  
ing em the United States which was not  
ratified by a law : and that the propofi- \
tion was explicitly rejected.  
il As, theretoie, it is perfectly clear  
to my undei(landing, that the afTent of  
the Houfe of Reprefentatives is not ne­  
ccflaiy to tlv* validity of a tr-aty, as the  
treaty with Cieat-Britain exhibit? in it-  
  
provilion, and en thele the papers called  
for can tiirow no light, an_ as it is ef­  
fe-utial to the due adminiftration of* the  
government, that the boundaries fixed  
by the conftitution between tbe diffe­  
rent departments fl.#Uld be pr.-feived :  
a juft regard to the conftitution and to  
the duty of my office, under all the cir­  
cumft-iice.of this cafe, forbid a compli­  
ance with ye ur requdt.

We will here insert an extract from the answer ol  
General Washington refusing the papers, which  
most satisfy every one of the fully of the demand

“ crecy was one cogent reason for vesting the povv­

“ advice and consent of the Senate; the principle  
“ on which that body was formed confining it to a  
“ small number of members. To admit then a  
right in the house of lepresenlativcs to demand,

bearing on the question, now about to be decided,  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
&#x27; and which he should proceedyg submit to them.  
**The course which the’  
resolution of the house, 16a  
on the mode of making treat  
tion of the United States. © are  
  
“Having been a member of the general assembly  
and knowing the principles on which the constitit-  
  
Some observations  
mder the constitu-  
  
tion was formed, T have ever entertained but one .  
  
pinion on this subject; and from the first estabijs,  
ment ofthe government to this moment, my Pity  
duct has exemplified that opinion: that the power of  
making treaties is exclusively vesied in the pres;  
dent, by and with the advice and consent of the sey.  
ate; and that every treaty so made and promulgated  
  
thenceforward became the law of the Land. -  
“Tt is thus the treaty making power has been up,  
derstood by foreign nations, and in all the treaties  
made with them, we have declared, and they hare  
believed, that when ratified by the president, wis),  
the advice and consent of the senate, they became  
obligatory. In this construction of the constitution,  
every house of representatives has heretofore aequi.  
esced, and until the present time, not a doubt op  
suspicion has appeared to my knowledge, that this  
construction Was not the true one; nay, they have  
more than acquiesced—for till now, without contro.  
verting the obligation of such treaties, they have  
made all the requisite provisions for carrying them  
into effect. ‘  
  
“There is also reason to believe, that this con.  
struction agrees with the opinions entertained by  
the state conventions, when they were deliberating  
on the constitution; especially by those who obice-ed  
to it, because there was not required, in commercial  
treaties, the consent of two-thirds of the whole num.  
ber of the members of the senate, instead of: two.  
thirds of the senators present, and because in trea.  
ties respecting senatorial, and certain other rigs  
and claims, the concurrence of three-fourths of the  
whole number of the members of both houses, re-  
spectively, was not made necessary.  
  
It is a fact, declared by the general convention,  
and universally understood, that the constitution of  
the United States was the result of aspirit of amity  
and mutual concession; and it is well known, thet  
under this influence, the smaller states were admitted  
into an equal representation in the senate with the  
larger states; and that this branch of the govern.  
ment was invested with great powers—for on the  
equal participation of those powers, ‘lie  
  
:  
soverenenty  
  
‘and political situation of the smaller states were  
  
deemed essentially to depend.  
“If other proofs than these, and the pl«in letter of  
the constitution itself, be necessary to useertain the  
point under consideration, they may be found in the  
journals of the general convention, which I hare de  
posited in the office of the department of state. In  
thove journals it will appear, thst a proposition was  
made, that no treaty should be binding on the United  
States, which was not ratified by a law; and that the  
proposition was explicitly rejected.  
‘Ax, therefore, ic is perfectly clear to my under-  
standing, that the consent of the house of representa-  
tives is not necessary to the validity of the treaty, &amp;¢.  
a just regard to the constitution, and to the duty oi  
my office, &amp;e. forbid a compliance with your re  
quest.

the President, by and with the advice  
and consent of the Senate, provided two­  
thirds of the Senators present concur;  
and that every treaty so made and pro­  
mulgated, henceforward became the law  
of tiie land. It is thus that the treaty­  
making power I13S been understood by  
foreign nations ; and, in all the treaties  
made with them, vie have declared, and  
they have believed, that when ratified by  
the President, with the advice and con­  
sent of the Senate, they became obliga­  
tory. In thi» construction of the consti­  
tution, every House of Representatives  
has heretofore acquiesced, and until the  
present time, not a doubt or suspicion  
has appeared, to my knowledge, that this  
construction was not the true one. Nay,  
they have ipore than acquiesced; for,  
till now, without controverting the obli­  
gation of aucK treaties, they have made j  
all the requisite provieions for carrying  
them into effect.”  
And, in conclusion, he adds*-*  
“ As, therefore, it is perfectly clear to  
my understanding, that the assent oG  
the House of Representatives is not no  
cessary, the validity of a treaty ; as1  
the treaty with Great Britain exhibits  
within .itself all the objects requiring le­  
gislative provision ; and oq tbesc the pa- ;  
pers called Tor can throw no light; and  
as it ia essential to the due adrninistra­  
  
(ion of the government, that the bounda­  
ries fixed by the constitution, between  
the different departments, should be pre­  
served, a just regard to the constitution,  
and to the duty of my office, under all  
the circumstances of this case, forbid a  
compliance with your request.

That the power of maloing treatles is exciusively  
vested in the President, by and with the advice  
and consent of the Senate, provided two thirds  
of the Senators present concur, and that every  
treaty so made and promulsated thenceforward  
became the law of the land. It is thus that the  
treaty-making power has been understood by  
foreign nations, and in all the treaties made with  
them we have declared and they have believed  
that when ratified by the President, by and with  
the advice and consent of the Senate, they be

to the Minister of the United States (John Jay)  
who had recently negotiated the treaty with&#x27;  
Great Britain. Aftor remarking that the course  
which the debate had taken on the resolution  
in the House naturally led to some observa­  
tions on the mode of making treaties under the  
Constitution of the United States, Washing  
proceeds as follows: &quot;Having been a member  
of the General Convention (at Philadelphia),  
and knowing the principles on which the Con­  
stitution was formed, I have ever entertained  
but one opinion on this subject; and, from the  
first establishment of the Government to this  
moment, Hhy conduct has exemplified that  
opinion--that the power of making treaties  
is exclusively vested in the President,  
by and with the advice and consent of  
the Senate, provided two-thirds of the Senators  
present concur; and that every treaty so made  
and promulgated thenceforward becomes the  
law of the land. It is thus that the treaty­  
making power has been understood by foreign  
nations, and in all the treaties made with them  
wo have declared and they have believed that,  
when ratified by the President, with the advice  
and consent of the Senate, they became obliga­  
tory. In this construction of the Constitution  
every House of Ropresentatives has heretofore  
acquiesced, and, until the present time, not a  
doubt or suspicion has appeared, to my knowl­  
edge, that this construction was not the true  
one. Nay, they have more than acquiesced;  
for without controverting the obligation of  
such treaties, they have made all the requisite  
provisions for carrying them into effect.  
&quot;There is also reason to believe that this con­  
struction agrees with the opinions entertained  
by the State Conventions when they were delib­  
erating on the Constitution, especially by those  
who objected to it because there was not re­  
quired in commercial treaties the consent of two­  
thirds of the whole number of the members of  
the Senate, instead of two-thirds of the Senators  
present, and because in treaties respecting terri­  
torial and certain other rights and claims the  
concurrence of three-fourths of the whole num­  
ber of the members of both Houses, respect­  
ively, was not made necessary. It is a fact de­  
clared by the General Convention, and uni­  
versally understood, that the Constitution of  
the United States was the result of a spirit  
of amity and mutual concession; and it i  
well known that under this influence the  
maller States were admitted to an equal  
representation in the Senate with the larger  
States, and that this branch of the Govern­  
ment was invested with great powers, for on  
the equal participation of those powers the  
sovereignty and political safety of the smaller  
States was deemed essentially to depend. If  
other proofs than these and the plain letter of  
the Constitution itself be necessary to ascertain  
the point under consideration, they may be  
found in the journals of the General Conven­  
tion, which I have deposited in the office of the  
Department of State. In those journais it will  
appear that a proposition was made that no  
treaty should be binding on the United States  
which was not ratified by a law,&quot; and that the  
proposition was explicitly rejected.&quot;  
IV.  
It was in his eighth annual address that  
Washington distinctly announced that he  
would not be a candidate for a third torm of the  
Presidenoy. In the responsive address of th

asure. The debate  
lasted three weeks, at thi end of which  
tlmo the House, by a vote of 62 to 37, adopt­  
ed a resolution calling on the President  
for his Instructions to Jay and other pa­  
pers relating to the treaty. Washington  
consulted his Cabinet, and they decided  
unanimously that the House had right  
to make such a call and that It was an  
unfounded claim of power on the part of  
the House to interfera with the privileges  
of the President. He therefore replied in  
a rpecla.1 message, respectfully declining  
  
tb comply with the ealL. The message,  
calm and moderate, but firm, concluded as  
fellows:  
As. therefore. It is perfectly clear to my  
understanding that tho assent of the House  
of Representatives is not ncessary to the  
validity of a treaty: as the treaty with  
Great Britain exhibits In Itself all the ob­  
jects requiring legislative provision and on  
these the papers called for can throw no  
light: and as it Is essential to the due ad­  
ministration of the government that the  
iKMindaries fixed by the Constitution be­  
twwn the different departments should, be  
preserved, a just regard to the Constitu­  
tion and to the duty of my office, under

opinion in writing. During the progress of the debate, Chief-Justice Ells-  
worth drew up an argument, showing that the papers could not be consti-  
tutionally demanded by the House of Representatives. A message was  
therefore framed and sent to the House on the 30th of March, at the con-  
clusion of which the President said, ‘‘ A just regard to the constitution,
