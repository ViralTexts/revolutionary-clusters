The Hills, the Dales, and the delightful Woods,  
The flowry Plains, and Silver-streaming Floods,

And cringe beneath a supercilious Brow;

At Baseness, and his Blood too highly boils.  
A Courtier must be supple, full of Guile,  
  
Must learn to praise, to flatter, to revile  
The Good, the Bad; an Enemy, a Friend;  
To give false Hopes, and on false Hopes depend.

The Winter spent, Joe feels the Poet’s Fire,  
The Sun advances, and the Fogs retire:  
The genial Spring unbinds the frozen Earth,  
Dawns on the Trees, and gives the Prim-rose Birth.  
Loos’d from their Friendly Harbours, once again,  
  
Our floating Forts assemble on the Main;  
The Voice of War the gallant Soldier wakes;  
And weeping Cloe parting Kisses takes.

Man only knows the Cunning of his Kind;  
With equal Wit can counter-work his Foes,

Man only from himself can suffer Wrong;  
His Reason fails as his Desires grow strong:  
Hence, wanting Ballast, and too full of Sail,  
He lies expos’d to every rising Gale.  
From Youth to Age, for Happiness he’s bound;  
He splits on Rocks, or runs his Bark aground;  
Or, wide of Land a desart Ocean views,  
And, to the last, the flying Port pursues.

er hath xxx days.  
  
The Reverse.  
Studious of Ease, and fond of humble Things,  
Below the Smiles, below the Frowns of Kings:  
Thanks to my Stars, I prize the Sweets of Life,  
No sleepless Nights I count, no Days of Strife.  
I rest, I wake, I drink, I sometimes love,  
I read, I write, I settle, or I rove;  
Content to live, content to die unknown,  
Lord of myself, accountable to none.  
  
  
You will be careful, if you are wise;  
How you touch Men’s Religion, or Credit, or Eyes.  
  
  
After Fish,  
Milk do not wish.  
  
Heb Dduw heb ddim, a Duw a digon.  
They who have nothing to trouble them, will be troubled at nothing.  
VIII Mon. October hath xxxi days.  
  
On him true Happiness shall wait  
Who shunning noisy Pomp and State  
Those little Blessings of the Great,  
Consults the Golden Mean.  
In prosp’rous Gales with Care he steers,  
Nor adverse Winds, dejected, fears,  
In ev’ry Turn of Fortune bears  
A Face and Mind serene.  
  
Against Diseases here, the strongest Fence,  
Is the defensive Virtue, Abstinence.  
  
  
Fient de chien, et marc d’argent,  
Seront tout un au jour du jugement.  
  
  
If thou dost ill, the joy fades, not the pains;  
If well, the pain doth fade, the joy remains.  
  
IX Mon. November hath xxx days.  
  
Celia’s rich Side-board seldom sees the Light,  
Clean is her Kitchen, and her Spits are bright;  
Her Knives and Spoons, all rang’d in even Rows,  
No Hands molest, nor Fingers discompose:  
A curious Jack, hung up to please the Eye,  
Forever still, whose Flyers never fly:  
Her Plates unsully’d, shining on the Shelf;  
For Celia dresses nothing,—but herself.  
  
To err is human, to repent divine, to persist devilish.  
  
Money and Man a mutual Friendship show:  
Man makes false Money, Money makes Man so.  
  
Industry pays Debts, Despair encreases them.  
  
Bright as the day and as the morning fair,  
Such Cloe is, and common as the air.  
  
X Mon. December hath xxxi days.  
  
Among the Divines there has been much Debate,  
Concerning the World in its ancient Estate;  
Some say ’twas once good, but now is grown bad,  
Some say ’tis reform’d of the Faults it once had:  
I say, ’tis the best World, this that we now live in,  
Either to lend, or to spend, or to give in;  
But to borrow, to beg, or to get a Man’s own,  
It is the worst World that ever was known.

Courts.  
Honest Men often go to Law for their Right; when Wise Men would sit down with the Wrong, supposing the first Loss least. In some Countries the Course of the Courts is so tedious, and the Expence so high, that the Remedy, Justice, is worse than, Injustice, the Disease. In my Travels I once saw a Sign call’d The Two Men at Law; One of them was painted on one Side, in a melancholy Posture, all in Rags, with this Scroll, I have lost my Cause. The other was drawn capering for Joy, on the other Side, with these Words, I have gain’d my Suit; but he was stark naked.

h an exact Quantity as the Constitution of thy Body allows of, in reference to the Services of the Mind.  
They that study much, ought not to eat so much as those that work hard, their Digestion being not so good.  
The exact Quantity and Quality being found out, is to be kept to constantly.  
Excess in all other Things whatever, as well as in Meat and Drink, is also to be avoided.  
Youth, Age, and Sick require a different Quantity.  
And so do those of contrary Complexions; for that which is too much for a flegmatick Man, is not sufficient for a Cholerick.  
The Measure of Food ought to be (as much as possibly may be) exactly proportionable to the Quality and Condition of the Stomach, because the Stomach digests it.  
That Quantity that is sufficient, the Stomach can perfectly concoct and digest, and it sufficeth the due Nourishment of the Body.  
A greater Quantity of some things may be eaten than of others, some being of lighter Digestion than others.  
The Difficulty lies, in finding out an exact Measure; but eat for Necessity, not Pleasure, for Lust knows not where Necessity ends.  
  
Wouldst thou enjoy a long Life, a healthy Body, and a vigorous Mind, and be acquainted also with the wonderful works of God? labour in the first place to bring thy Appetite into Subjection to Reason.  
  
  
Rules to find out a fit Measure of Meat and Drink.  
If thou eatest so much as makes thee unfit for Study, or other Business, thou exceedest the due Measure.  
If thou art dull and heavy after Meat, it’s a sign thou hast exceeded the due Measure; for Meat and Drink ought to refresh the Body, and make it chearful, and not to dull and oppress it.  
If thou findest these ill Symptoms, consider whether too much Meat, or too much Drink occasions it, or both, and abate by little and little, till thou findest the Inconveniency removed.  
Keep out of the Sight of Feasts and Banquets as much as may be; for ’tis more difficult to refrain good Cheer, when it’s present, than from the Desire of it when it is away; the like you may observe in the Objects of all the other Senses.  
If a Man casually exceeds, let him fast the next Meal, and all may be well again, provided it be not too often done; as if he exceed at Dinner, let him refrain a Supper, &amp;c.  
A temperate Diet frees from Diseases; such are seldom ill, but if they are surprised with Sickness, they bear it better, and recover sooner; for most Distempers have their Original from Repletion.  
Use now and then a little Exercise a quarter of an Hour before Meals, as to swing a Weight, or swing your Arms about with a small Weight in each Hand; to leap, or the like, for that stirs the Muscles of the Breast.  
A temperate Diet arms the Body against all external Accidents; so that they are not so easily hurt by Heat, Cold or Labour; if they at any time should be prejudiced, they are more easily cured, either of Wounds, Dislocations or Bruises.  
But when malignant Fevers are rife in the Country or City where thou dwelst, ’tis adviseable to eat and drink more freely, by Way of Prevention; for those are Diseases that are not caused by Repletion, and seldom attack Full-feeders.  
A sober Diet makes a Man die without Pain; it maintains the Senses in Vigour; it mitigates the Violence of Passions and Affections.  
  
It preserves the Memory, it helps the Understanding, it allays the Heat of Lust; it brings a Man to a Consideration of his latter End; it makes the Body a fit Tabernacle for the Lord to dwell in; which makes us happy in this World, and eternally happy in the World to come, through Jesus Christ our Lord and Savio
