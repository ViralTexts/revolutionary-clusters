without any reasons being offered. The dissent of New-York and Rhode-Island frustrated a most important measure. The gentleman says, he was for granting the impost; yet he acknowleges, he could not agree to the mode recommended. But it was well known, that Congress had declared, that they could not receive the accession of the states, upon any other plan than that proposed. In such case, propositions for altering the plan amounted to a positive rejection. At this time, Sir, we were told it was dangerous to grant powers to Congress. Did this general argument indicate a disposition to grant the impost in any shape? I should myself have been averse to the granting of very extensive powers: But the impost was justly considered as the only means of supporting the union.

on from their conduct or their reasonings.  
Sir, with respect to the subject of revenue, which was debated yesterday, it was asserted that in all matters of taxation, except in the article of imposts, the united and individual states had a concurrent jurisdiction; that the state governments had an independent authority, to draw revenues from every source but one. The truth of these positions will appear on a slight investigation. I maintain, that the word supreme imports no more than this; that the constitution, and laws made in pursuance thereof, cannot be controuled or defeated by any other law. The acts of the United States therefore will be absolutely obligatory, as to all the proper objects and powers of the general government. The states as well as individuals are bound by these laws. But the laws of Congress are restricted to a certain sphere, and when they depart from this sphere, they are no longer supreme or binding. In the same manner the states have certain independent powers, in which their laws are supreme: For example, in making and executing laws concerning the punishment of certain crimes, such as murder, theft, &amp;c. the states cannot be controuled. With respect to certain other objects, the powers of the two governments are concurrent, and yet supreme. I instanced, yesterday, a tax on any specific article. Both might lay the tax; both might collect it without clashing or interference. If the individual should be unable to pay both, the first seizure would hold the property. Here the laws are not in the way of each other; they are independent and supreme. The case is like that of two creditors: Each has a distinct demand; the debtor is held equally for the payment of both. Their suits are independent; and if the debtor cannot pay both, he who takes the first step, secures his debt. The individual is precisely in the same situation, whether he pays such a sum to one, or to two. No more will be required of him to supply the public wants, than he has ability to afford. That the states have an undoubted right to lay taxes in all cases in which they are not prohibited, is a position founded on the obvious and important principle in confederated governments, that whatever is not expressly given to the federal head, is reserved to the members. The truth of this principle must strike every intelligent mind. In the first formation of government by the association of individuals, every power of the community is delegated, because the government is to extend to every possible object; Nothing is reserved, but the unalienable rights of mankind: But when a number of these societies unite for certain purposes, the rule is different, and from the plainest reason: They have already delegated their sovereignty, and their powers to their several governments; and these cannot be recalled, and given to another, without an express act. I submit to the committee whether this reasoning is not conclusive. Unless therefore we find that the powers of taxation are exclusively granted, we must conclude, that there remains a concurrent authority. Let us then enquire if the constitution gives such exclusive powers to the general government. Sir, there is not a syllable in it, that favours this idea: Not a word importing an exclusive grant, except in the article of imposts. I am supported in my general position, by this very exception. If the state

burthens of government. The nature of our union requires, that we should give up our state impost: The amendment would forfeit every other advantage. This part of the constitution should not be touched. The excises were designed as a recompence to the importing states, for relinquishing their imposts.

question most lucidly, as follows :  
&#x27;Sir, with respect to the subject of revenue,  
which was debated yesterday, it was asserted that  
in all matters of taxation, except in the article of  
imposts, the united and individual states had a con  
current jurisdiction ; mat tne state governments  
had an independent authority, to draw revenues  
from every source but one. The truth of these  
positions will appear on a slight investigation. I  
maintain, that the word supreme imports no more  
than this : that the constitution, and laws made in  
pursuance thereof, cannot be controlled or defeat­  
ed by any other law. The acts of the U. States,  
therefore, will be absolutely obligatory, as to all  
the proper objects and powers of the general go­  
vernment. The states, as well as individuals, are  
bound by these laws but the laws of Congress  
are restricted to a certain sphere, and when they  
depart from this sphere, they are no longer supreme  
or binding. In the same manner the states have  
certain independent powers, in which their la ws are  
supreme ; for example, in making and executing  
laws concerning the punishment of certain crimes  
such as murder, theft, &amp;c, the states cannot be  
controlled. With respect to certain other objects,  
the power s of the two governments are concurrent,  
and yet supreme. I instanced, yesterday, a tax  
on any specific article. Both might lay the tax ;  
both might collect it without clashing or interfe­  
rence. If the individual should be unable to pay  
both, the first seizure would hold the property.  
Here the laws are not in the way of each other ;  
they are independent and supreme. The case is  
like that of two creditors : each has a distinct de­  
mand ; the debtor is held equally for the payment  
of both. Their suits are independent : and, if the  
debtor cannot pay both, he who takes the first step,  
secures his debt. The individual is precisely in the  
same situation, whether he pays such a sum to one  
or to two. No more will be required of him to sup­  
ply the public wants, than he has ability to afford.  
That the states have an undoubted right to lay  
taxes in all cases in which they are not prohibited,  
is a position founded en the obvious and impejrtant  
principle in confederated governments, that, what­  
ever is not expressly given to the federal head, is
