re at present; of course, allowing your observation (as it respects myself) to be founded, personal influence would be of no avail.  
Let that party set up a broomstick, and call it a true son of Liberty, a Democrat, or give it any other epithet that will suit their purpose, and it will command their votes in toto! Will not the Federalists meet, or rather defend their cause, on the opposite ground? Surely they must, or they will discover a want of Policy, indicative of weakness, &amp; pregnant of mischief; which cannot be admitted. Wherein then would lye the difference between the present Gentleman in Office, &amp; myself?  
It would be matter of sore regret to me, if I could believe that a serious thot was turned towards me as his successor; not only as it respects my ardent wishes to pass through the vale of life in retiremt, undisturbed in the remnant of the days I have to sojourn here, unless called upon to defend my Country (which every citizen is bound to do)—but on Public ground also; for although I have abundant cause to be thankful for the good health with whh I am blessed, yet I am not insensible to my declination in other respects. It would be criminal therefore in me, although it should be the wish of my Country men, and I could be elected, to accept  
  
an Office under this conviction, which another would discharge with more ability; and this too at a time when I am thoroughly convinced I should not draw a single vote from the Anti-federal side; and of course, should stand upon no stronger ground than any other Federal character well supported; &amp; when I should become a mark for the shafts of envenomed malice, and the basest calumny to fire at; when I should be charged not only with irresolution, but with concealed ambition, which wants only an occasion to blaze out; and, in short, with dotage and imbicility.  
All this I grant, ought to be like dust in the balance, when put in compet[it]ion with a great public good, when the accomplishment of it is apparent. But as no problem is better defined in my mind than that principle, not men, is now, and will be, the object of contention; and that I could not obtain a solitary vote from that Party; that any other respectable Federal character would receive the same suffrages that I should; that at my time of life, (verging towards three score &amp; ten) I should expose myself without rendering any essential service to my Country, or answering the end contemplated: Prudence on my part must arrest any attempt at the well meant, but mistaken views of my friends, to introduce me again into the Chair of Government.

republican party. To make him, in the light  
of all j.bis experience, again its standard-bear­  
er and the exponent of its principles, whatever  
temporary success might be gaiued by it,  
would ultimately bury it iu an infamy so deCp

Among the scraps of history brought jo light

great straits through the failure of the Adams  
administration:
