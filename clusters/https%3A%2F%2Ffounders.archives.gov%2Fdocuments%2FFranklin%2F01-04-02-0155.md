ught to have wrote to you long since, in Answer to yours of Oct. 16. concerning the Water Spout: But Business partly, and partly a Desire of procuring further Information by Inquiry among my Seafaring Acquaintance, induc’d me to postpone Writing from time to time, till I am now almost asham’d to resume the Subject, not knowing but you may have forgot what has been said upon it.  
Nothing certainly can be more improving to a Searcher into Nature, than Objections judiciously made to his Opinions, taken up perhaps too hastily: For such Objections oblige him to restudy the Point, consider every Circumstance carefully, compare Facts, make Experiments, weigh Arguments, and be slow in drawing Conclusions. And hence a sure Advantage results; for he either confirms a Truth, before too slightly supported; or discovers an Error and receives Instruction from the Objector.  
In this View I consider the Objections and Remarks you sent me, and thank you for them sincerely: But how much soever my Inclinations lead me to philosophical Inquiries, I am so engag’d in Business public and private, that those more pleasing pursuits are frequently interrupted, and the Chain of Thought necessary to be closely continu’d in such Disquisitions, so broken and disjointed, that it is with Difficulty I satisfy myself in any of them. And I am now not much nearer a Conclusion in this Matter of the Spout, than when I first read your Letter.  
Yet hoping we may in time sift out the Truth between us, I will send you my present Thoughts with some Observations on your Reasons, on the Accounts in the Transactions, and other Relations I have met with. Perhaps while I am writing some new Light may strike me—for I shall now be oblig’d to consider the Subject with a little more Attention. I agree with you, that by means of a Vacuum in a Whirlwind, Water cannot be suppos’d to rise in large Masses to the Region of the Clouds: For the Pressure of the surrounding Atmosphere could not force it up in a continu’d Body or Column to a much greater Height than thirty feet: But if there really is a Vacuum in the Center or near the Axis of Whirlwinds, then I think Water may rise in such Vacuum to that Height or to less Height as the Vacuum may be less perfect.  
I had not read Stuart’s Account in the Transactions for many Years before the receipt of your Letter and had quite forgot it; but now, on Viewing his Drafts, and considering his Descriptions, I think they seem to favour my Hypothesis; For he describes and draws Columns of Water of various Heights, terminating abruptly at the Top, exactly as Water would do when forc’d up by the Pressure of the Atmosphere into an exhausted Tube.  
I must, however, no longer call it my Hypothesis, since I find Stuart had the same Thought tho’ somewhat obscurely express’d, where he says, “he imagines this Phaenomenon may be solv’d by Suction (improperly so call’d) or rather Pulsion, as in the Application of a Cupping Glass to the Flesh, the Air being first voided by the kindled Flax.”  
In my Paper, I supposed a Whirlwind and a Spout, to be the same Thing, and to proceed from the same Cause; the only Difference between them being, that the one passes over Land, the other over Water. I find also, in the Transactions, that Mr. de la Pryme was of the same Opinion; for he there describes two Spouts as he calls them, which were seen at different Times at Hatfield in Yorkshire, whose Appearances in the Air were the same with those of the Spouts at Sea, and Effects the same with those of real Whirlwinds.  
Whirlwinds have generally a progressive as well as a circular Motion; so had what is called the Spout at Topsham; See the Account of it in the Transactions; which also appears by its Effects described to have been a real Whirlwind. Water Spouts have likewise a progressive Motion. Tho’ this is sometimes greater and sometimes less, in some violent, in others barely perceivable. The Whirlwind at Warrington continu’d long in Acrement Close.  
Whirlwinds generally arise after Calms and great Heats: The same is observ’d of Water Spouts, which are therefore most frequent in the warm Latitudes. The Spout that happen’d in Cold Weather in the Downs, describ’d by Mr. Gordon, in the Transactions, was for that reason thought extraordinary, but he remarks withal, that the Weather tho’ cold when the Spout appeared, was soon after much colder; as we find it commonly less warm after a Whirlwind.  
You agree that the Wind blows every way towards a Whirlwind from a large Space round; An intelligent Whaleman of Nantucket, informed me, that three of their Vessels which were out in search of Whales, happening to be becalmed lay in Sight of each other at about a League distance if I remember right nearly forming a Triangle; after some time a Water Spout appeared near the Middle of the Triangle, when a brisk Breeze of Wind also sprang up; and every Vessel made Sail and then it appeared to them all by the Setting of the Sails and the Course each Vessel stood, that the Spout was to Leeward of every one of them, and they all declar’d it to have been so when they happen’d afterwards in Company and came to confer about it. So that in this Particular likewise, Whirlwinds and Waterspouts agree.  
But if that which appears a Water Spout at Sea, does sometimes in its progressive Motion, meet with and pass over Land, and there produce all the Phenomena and Effects of a Whirlwind, it should thence seem still more evident that a Whirlwind and Spout are the same. I send you herewith a Letter from an ingenious Physician of my Acquaintance, which gives one Instance of this, that fell within his Observation.  
A Fluid moving from all Points horizontally towards a Center, must at that Center either ascend or descend. Water being in a Tub, if a Hole be open’d in the Middle of the Bottom, will flow from all Sides to the Center, and there descend in a Whirl. But Air flowing on and near the Surface of Land or Water from all Sides toward a Center, must at that Center ascend; the Land or Water hindering its Descent.  
If these concentring Currents of Air be in the upper Region, they may indeed descend in the Spout or Whirlwind; but then when the united Current reach’d the Earth or Water it would spread and probably blow every way from the Center: There may be Whirlwinds of both kinds, but from the common observ’d Effects, I suspect the Rising one to be the most common; and that when the upper Air descends, tis perhaps in a greater Body, extending wider and without much whirling as in our Thunder Gusts. When Air descends in a Spout or Whirlwind, I should rather expect it would press the Roof of a House inwards, or force in the Tiles, Shingles or Thatch; force a Boat down into the Water, or a Piece of Timber into the Earth than that it would lift them up and carry them away.  
It has so happen’d that I have not met with any Accounts of Spouts, that certainly descended. I suspect they are not frequent. Please to communicate those you mention. The apparent dropping of a Pipe from the Clouds towards the Earth or Sea, I will endeavour to explain hereafter.  
The Augmentation of the Cloud, which, as I am inform’d is generally if not always the case during a Spout, seems to show an Ascent rather than a Descent of the Matter of which such Cloud is composed. For a descending Spout one would expect should diminish a Cloud. I own, however, that descending cold Air, may by Condensing the Vapours of a lower Region form and increase Clouds, which I think is generally the Case in our common Thunder Gusts, and therefore do not lay great Stress on this Argument.  
Whirlwinds and Spouts are not always tho’ most commonly in the Day-time. The terrible Whirlwind which damag’d a great Part of Rome June 11. 1749 happen’d in the Night of that Day. The same was supposed to have been first a Spout, for it is said to be beyond doubt that it gathered in the neighbouring Sea, as it could be tracked from Ostia to Rome. I find this in Pere Boschovich’s Account of it, as abridg’d in the Monthly Review for December 1750.  
In that Account the Whirlwind is said to have appear’d as a very black long and lofty Cloud, (discoverable notwithstanding the Darkness of the Night by its continually lightning or emitting Flashes on all Sides) pushing along with a surprizing Swiftness, and within 3 or 4 feet of the Ground. Its general Effects on Houses, were stripping off the Roofs, blowing away Chimneys, breaking Doors and Windows, forcing up the Floors, and unpaving the Rooms: [Some of these Effects seem to agree well with a supposed Vacuum in the Center of the Whirlwind;] and the very Rafters of the Houses were broke and dispersed, and even hurled against Houses at a considerable Distance, &amp;c.  
It seems by an Expression of Pere Boschovich’s as if the Wind blew from all sides towards this Whirlwind for having carefully observ’d its Effects he concludes of all Whirlwinds “that their Motion is circular, and their Action attractive.”  
He observes on a Number of Histories of Whirlwinds &amp;c. “that a common Effect of them is to carry up into the Air, Tiles, Stones and Animals themselves, which happen to be in their Course, and all kinds of Bodies unexceptionally, throwing them to a considerable Distance, with great Impetuosity.” Such Effects seem to show a rising Current of Air.  
I will endeavour to explain my Conceptions of this Matter, by Figures, representing a Plan and an Elevation of a Spout or Whirlwind.  
  
I would only first beg to be allowed two or three Positions mentioned in my former Paper.  
1st. That the lower Region of Air is often more heated and so more rarified, than the upper; consequently specifically lighter. The Coldness of the upper Region is manifested by the Hail which sometimes falls from it in a hot Day:  
2dly. That heated Air may be very moist, and yet the Moisture so equally diffus’d and rarified, as not to be visible, till colder Air mixes with it, when it condenses and becomes visible. Thus our Breath, invisible in Summer, becomes visible in Winter.  
Now let us suppose a Tract of Land or Sea of perhaps 60 Miles square unscreen’d by Clouds and unfann’d by Winds during great Part of a Summer’s Day, or it may be for several Days successively till ’tis violently heated, together with the lower Region of Air in Contact with it, so that the said lower Air becomes specifically lighter than the superincumbent higher Region of the Atmosphere, in which the Clouds commonly float. Let us suppose also, that the Air surrounding this Tract has not been so much heated during those Days, and therefore remains heavier. The Consequence of this should be, as I imagine that the heated lighter Air being press’d on all Sides must ascend, and the heavier descend; and as this Rising cannot be in all Parts or the whole Area of the Tract at once, for that would leave too extensive a Vacuum, the Rising will begin precisely in that Column that happens to be the lightest or most rarified; and the warm Air will flow horizontally from all Points to this Column, where the several Currents meeting and joining to rise, a Whirl is naturally formed, in the same Manner as a Whirl is formed in the Tub of Water by the descending Fluid flowing from all Sides of the Tub to the Hole in the Center.  
And as the several Currents arrive at this central rising Column with a considerable Degree of horizontal Motion, they cannot suddenly change it to a vertical Motion, therefore as they gradually in approaching the Whirl decline from right to curve or circular Lines, so having join’d the Whirl they ascend by a spiral Motion; in the same Manner as the Water descends spirally thro’ the Hole in the Tub before-mentioned.  
Lastly, as the lower Air and nearest the Surface, is most rarified by the Heat of the Sun, that Air is most acted on by the Pressure of the surrounding cold and heavy Air which is to take its Place, consequently its Motion towards the Whirl is swiftest, and so the force of the lower Part of the Whirl or Trump strongest, and the Centrifugal Force of its Particles greatest; and hence the Vacuum round the Axis of the Whirl should be greatest near the Earth or Sea, and be gradually diminish’d as it approaches the Region of the Clouds, till it ends in a Point, as at A in Fig II. forming a long and sharp Cone.  
In Fig I. which is a Plan or Ground Plot of a Whirlwind, the Circle V represents the central Vacuum.  
Between aaaa and bbbb I suppose a Body of Air condens’d strongly by the Pressure of the Currents moving towards it from all sides without, and by its Centrifugal Force from within; moving round with prodigious Swiftness, (having as it were the   Momenta of all the Currents → → → → united in itself) and with a Power equal to its Swiftness and Density.  
It is this whirling Body of Air between aaaa and bbbb that rises spirally. By its Force it tears Buildings to Pieces, twists up great Trees by the Roots, &amp;c. and by its spiral Motion raises the Fragments so high till the Pressure of the surrounding and approaching Currents diminishing can no longer confine them to the Circle, or their own centrifugal Force encreasing grows too strong for such Pressure, when they fly off in Tangent Lines as Stones out of a Sling, and fall on all Sides and at great Distances.  
If it happens at Sea, the Water between aaaa and bbbb will be violently agitated and driven about, and parts of it raised with the spiral Current, and thrown about so as to form a Bushlike Appearance.  
This Circle is of various Diameters, sometimes very large.  
If the Vacuum passes over Water the Water may rise in it in a Body or Column to near the Height of 32 feet. If it passes over Houses, it may burst their Windows or Walls outwards, pluck off the Roofs and blow up the Floors, by the Sudden Rarefaction of the Air contain’d within such Buildings, the outward Pressure of the Atmosphere being suddenly taken off; So the stop’d Bottle of Air bursts under the exhausted Receiver of the Air Pump.  
Fig II. is to represent the Elevation of a Water Spout; wherein I suppose PPP to be the Cone, at first a Vacuum till WW the rising Column of Water has fill’d so much of it. SSSS the Spiral Whirl of Air surrounding the Vacuum and continu’d higher in a close Column after the Vacuum ends in the Point P. till it reach the cool Region of the Air. B.B. the Bush describ’d by Stuart, surrounding the Foot of the Column of Water.  
Now I suppose this Whirl of Air will at first be as invisible as the Air itself tho’ reaching in reality from the Water to the Region of cool Air in which our low Summer Thunder Clouds commonly float; but presently it will become visible at its Extremities. At its lower End by the Agitation of the Water, under the Whirling Part of the Circle, between P and S. forming Stuart’s Bush, and by the Swelling and Rising of the Water in the beginning Vacuum, which is at first a small low broad Cone whose Top gradually rises and sharpens as the Force of the Whirl increases. At its upper End, it becomes visible by the Warm Air brought up to the cooler Region, where its Moisture begins to be condens’d into thick Vapour by the Cold, and is seen first at A. the highest Parts, which being now cool’d, condenses what rises next at B. which condenses that at C; and that condenses what is rising at D. The Cold operating by the Contact of the Vapours faster in a right Line downwards, than the Vapours themselves can climb in a spiral Line upwards; they climb however, and as by continual Addition they grow denser and consequently their centrifugal Force greater, and being risen above the concentrating Currents that compose the Whirl, they flie off, spread and form a Cloud.  
It seems easy to conceive, how by this successive Condensation from above the Spout appears to drop or descend from the Cloud, tho’ the Materials of which it is composed are all the while ascending.  
The Condensation of the Moisture contain’d in so great a Quantity of warm Air as may be suppos’d to rise in a short Time in this prodigiously rapid Whirl, is perhaps sufficient to form a great Extent of Cloud, tho’ the Spout should be over Land as those at Hatfield; and if the Land happens not to be very dusty, perhaps the lower Part of the Spout will scarce become visible at all; Tho’ the upper or what is commonly call’d the descending Part be very distinctly seen.  
The same may happen at Sea, in case the Whirl is not violent enough to make a high Vacuum and raise the Column, &amp;c. In such Case the upper Part ABCD only will be visible, and the Bush perhaps below.  
But if the Whirl be strong, and there be much Dust on the Land, or the Column WW be rais’d from the Water; then the lower Part becomes visible, and sometimes even united to the upper Part. For the Dust may be carried up in the Spiral Whirl till it reach the Region where the Vapour is condens’d, and rise with that even to the Clouds. And the Friction of the Whirling Air on the Sides of the Column WW may detach great Quantities of its Water, break it into Drops and carry them up in the Spiral Whirl mix’d with the Air; the heavier Drops may indeed fly off, and fall in a Shower round the Spout; but much of it will be broken into Vapour, yet visible; and thus in both Cases, by Dust at Land, and by Water at Sea, the whole Tube may be darkned and render’d visible.  
  
As the Whirl weakens, the Tube may (in Appearance) separate in the Middle; the Column of Water subsiding, and the superior condens’d Part drawing up to the Cloud. Yet still the Tube or Whirl of Air may remain entire, the middle only becoming invisible, as not containing visible Matter.  
Dr. Stuart says, “it was observable of all the Spouts he saw, but more perceptible of the great One; that towards the End it began to appear like a hollow Canal, only black in the Borders but white in the Middle, and tho’ at first it was altogether black and opaque, yet now one could very distinctly perceive the Sea Water to fly up along the Middle of this Canal, as Smoak up a Chimney.” And Dr. Mather describing a Whirlwind says, “a thick dark small Cloud arose, with a Pillar of Light in it, of about 8 or 10 foot Diameter and passed along the Ground in a Tract not wider than a Street, horribly tearing up Trees by the Roots, blowing them up in the Air like Feathers, and throwing up Stones of great Weight to a considerable Height in the Air, &amp;c.”  
These Accounts, the one of Water Spouts, the other of a Whirlwind, seem in this particular to agree; what one Gentleman describes as a Tube black in the Borders, and white in the middle; the other calls a black Cloud with a Pillar of Light in it; the latter Expression has only a little more of the marvellous, but the Thing is the same. And it seems not very difficult to understand. When Dr. Stuarts Spouts were full charg’d; that is, when the whirling Pipe of Air was filled, between aaaa and bbbb [Fig. I], with Quantities of Drops and Vapour torn off from the Column WW [Fig. II], the whole was render’d so dark as that it could not be seen thro’, nor the spiral ascending Motion discover’d; but when the Quantity ascending lessen’d, the Pipe became more transparent, and the ascending Motion visible. For by Inspection of this Figure in the Margin representing a Section of our Spout with the Vacuum in the Middle, it is plain, that if we look at such a hollow Pipe in the Direction of the Arrows, and suppose opacous Particles to be equally mix’d in the Space between the two circular Lines, both the Part between the Arrows a and b and that between the Arrows c and d, will appear much darker than that between b and c; as there must be many more of those opaque Particles in the Line of Vision across the Sides than across the Middle. It is thus, that a Hair in a Microscope evidently appears to be a Pipe, the Sides shewing darker than the Middle. Dr. Mather’s Whirl was probably fill’d with Dust; the Sides were very dark, but the Vacuum within rendering the Middle more transparent he calls it a Pillar of Light. It was in this more transparent Part between b and c that Stuart could see the spiral Motion of the Vapours, whose Lines on the nearest and farthest Side of this transparent Part crossing each other, represented Smoke ascending in a Chimney; for the Quantity being still too great in the Line of Sight thro’ the Sides of the Tube, the Motion could not be discover’d there, and so they represented the solid Sides of the Chimney.  
When the Vapours reach in the Pipe from the Clouds near to the Earth, it is no Wonder now to those who understand Electricity, that Flashes of Lightning should descend by the Spout, as in that at Rome.  
But you object, If Water may be thus carried into the Clouds, why have we no salt Rains? The Objection is strong and reasonable; and I know not whether I can answer it to your Satisfaction. I never heard but of one salt Rain, and that was where a Spout passed pretty near a Ship, so I suppose it to be only the Drops thrown off from the Spout by the centrifugal Force, (as the Birds were at Hatfield) when they had been carried so high as to be above or to be too strongly centrifugal for the Pressure of the concurring Winds surrounding it. And indeed I believe there can be no other kind of Salt Rain; for it has pleased the Goodness of God so to order it, that the Particles of Air will not attract the Particles of Salt; tho’ they strongly attract Water. Hence tho’ all Metals, even Gold, may be united with Air and render’d volatile, Salt remains fix’d in the Fire, and no Heat can force it up to any considerable Height or oblige the Air to hold it; Hence when Salt rises as it will a little Way into Air with Water, there is instantly a Separation made; the Particles of Water adhere to the Air, and the Particles of Salt fall down again, as if repell’d and forc’d off from the Water by some Power in the Air: Or as some Metals dissolv’d in a proper Menstruum will quit the Solvent when other matter approaches, and adhere to that, so the Water quits the Salt and embraces the Air but Air will not embrace the Salt and quit the Water. Otherwise, our Rains would indeed be salt, and every Tree and Plant on the Face of the Earth be destroy’d, with all the Animals that depend on them for Subsistence. He who hath proportioned and given proper Qualities to all Things, was not unmindful of this. Let us adore him with Praise and Thanksgiving!  
By some Accounts of Seamen, it seems the Column of Water WW sometimes falls suddenly, and if it be as some say 15 or 20 Yards Diameter it must fall with great Force, and they may well fear for their Ships. By one Account in the Transactions of a Spout that fell at Coln in Lancashire one would think the Column is sometimes lifted off from the Water, and carried over Land, and there let fall in a Body; but this I suppose happens rarely.  
Stuart describes his Spouts as appearing no bigger than a Mast! and sometimes less: but they were at a League and half Distance.  
I think I formerly read in Dampier, or some other Voyager, that a Spout in its progressive Motion went over a Ship becalmed on the Coast of Guinea: and first threw her down on one Side, carrying away her Foremast; then suddenly, whipt her up, and threw her down on the other Side, carrying away her Mizen Mast; and the whole was over in an Instant. I suppose the first Mischief was done by the foreside of the Whirl, the latter by the hinder Side, their Motion being contrary.  
I suppose a Whirlwind or Spout may be stationary when the concurring Winds are equal; but if unequal, the Whirl acquires a progressive Motion, in the direction of the Strongest Pressure.  
Where the Wind that gives the progressive Motion becomes stronger below than above, or above than below, the Spout will be bent, and the Cause ceasing, straiten again.  
Your Queries towards the End of your Paper, appear judicious and worth considering. At present I am not furnish’d with Facts sufficient to make any pertinent Answer to them. And this Paper has already a sufficient Quantity of Conjecture.  
Your manner of accommodating the Accounts to your Hypothesis, of descending Spouts, is I own ingenious; and perhaps that Hypothesis may be true: I will consider it farther; but as yet I am not satisfy’d with it, tho’ hereafter I may be. Here you have my Method of Accounting for the principal Phaenomena, which I submit to your candid Examination. If my Hypothesis is not the Truth itself, it is least as naked: For I have not with some of our learned Moderns disguis’d my Nonsense in Greek, cloth’d it in Algebra, or adorn’d it with Fluxions. And as I now seem to have almost written a Book instead of a Letter, you will think it high time I should conclude, which I beg Leave to do with assuring you that I am

SIR,  
  
Ought te have written to you, long  
  
fince, in anfwer to yours, concerning  
the water-fpout ; but bufinefs partly, and  
partly a defire of procuring further infor-  
mation, by inquiry among my fea- faring  
acquaintance, induced me to poftpone  
writing, from time to time, till 1 am now  
almoft afhamed to refume the fobjeét, not  
knowing but you may haye forgot what  
has been faid upon ir.  
  
I agree with you, that, by means of a  
vacuum in a whirlwind, water cannot be  
fuppofed to rife in large mafles to the region  
of the clouds; for the preffure of the fur-  
rounding atmofphere could not force itup.,  
in a continued body, or column, to a much  
greater height than thirty feet. But, if  
there really is a vacuum in the center, ©  
near the axis of whirlwinds, then, J think,  
water may rife in fuch vacuum to thag  
height, or to lefs height, as the vacuum  
may be lefs perfeét.  
  
Thad not read Stuart&#x27;s account in the  
Tranfaétions, for many years, before the  
receipt of your letter, and had quite for-  
got it; but now, on viewing his draughts,  
and confidering his defcriptions, I think  
they feem to favour my hypothefis ; for he  
defcribes and draws columns of water of  
various heights, terminating abruptly at  
the top, exaétly as water would do, when  
forced up by the preflure of the atmofphere  
into an exhaufted tube.  
  
I muft, however, no longer call it my  
hypothefis, fince 1 find Stuart had the fame  
thought, though fomewhat obfcurely ex-  
prefled, where he fays, * he imagines this  
phznomenon may be folved by fuétion (:m-  
properly fo called) or rather pulfion, as in  
the application of a cupping-glafs to the  
flefh, the air being firlt voided by the kin-  
dled flax.”  
  
In my paper, I fuppofed a whirlwind  
and a {pout to be the fame thing, and to  
proceed from the fame caufe ; the only dif-  
ference between them being, that the one  
paffes over land, the other over water, I  
find, alfo, in the Tranfaétions, that M.  
de la Pryme was of the fame opinion ; for  
he there defcribes two fpouts, as he calis  
them, which were feen.at different times,  
at Hatfield in Yorkthive, whofe appear-  
ances in the air were the fame with thofe  
of the fpouts at fea, and effeéts the fame  
with thofe of rea) whirlwiods.  
  
Whirlwinds have, generally, a progref-  
  
five, as well as a circular motion. Water-  
fpouts have, alfo, a progreflive motion 5  
this is fometimes greater, and fometimes  
Jefs ; in fome vielent, in others barely per-  
ceivable,  
  
Whirlwinds generally arife after calms  
and great heats: The fame is obferved of  
water-fpouts, which are, therefore, moft  
frequent in the warm latitudes, The fpout  
  
‘that happened in cold weather, in the  
  
Downs, defcribed by Mr. Gordon in the  
Tranfaétions, was, for that reafon, thought  
extraordinary ; but he remarks withal,  
that the weather, though cold when the  
{pout appeared, was foon after much cold-  
er; a8 we find it, commonly, lefs warm  
after a whirlwind.  
  
You agree, that the wind blows every way  
towards a whirlwind, from a large ‘pace  
round, Abn intelligen¢ whaleman of Nan-  
tucket informed me, that three of their  
veffzels, which were out in fearch of whales,  
happening to be becalmed, lay in fight of  
each other, at about a league diftance, if I  
remember right, nearly forming a triangle +  
After fome time, a water {pout appeared  
near the middle of the triangle, when a  
brifk breeze of wind {prung up, and every  
veflc] made fail; and then it appeared to  
them all, by the fetting of the fails, and  
the courfe each veffel ftood, that the fpout  
was to the leeward of every one of them;  
and they all declared it to have been fo,  
when they happened afterwards in compa-  
ny, and came to confer aboutit. So that,  
in this particular likewife, whirlwinds and  
water-{pouts agree.  
  
But, if that. which appears a water-  
fpout at fea does fometimes, in its pro-  
greffive motion, meet with and_ pafs over  
land, and there produce all the phenomena  
and effects of a whirlwind, it fhould thence  
feem ftill more evident, that a whirlwind  
and a fpout are the fame,  
  
A fluid, moving from all points hori-  
zontally, towards a center, muft, at that  
center, either afcend or defcend. Water  
being in atub, if a hole be opened in the  
middle of the bottom, will flow from all  
fides to the center, and there defcend ina  
whirl, But air flowing on and near the  
furface of land or water, from all fides,  
towards a center, muft, at that center, af-  
cend, the land or water hindering its de-  
fcent.  
  
If thefe concentring currents of air be  
in the upper region, they may, indeed,  
  
defcend  
  
  
  
  
  
359  
  
defcend in the fpout or whirlwind; but  
then, when the united current reached the  
earth or water, it would f{pread, and, pro-  
bably, blow every way from the center.  
There may be whirlwinds of both kinds,  
but, from the commonly obferved effeé&amp;s,  
¥ fufpeé the rifing one to be the moft com-  
mon : When the upper air defcends, it is,  
perhaps, in a greater body, extending  
wider, as in our thunder- gufts, and with-  
ovt much whirling ; and, when air de-  
feends in a fpout or whirlwind, I fhould  
rather expect it would prefs the roof of a  
houfe inwards, or force in the&#x27;tiles, fhin,  
gles, or thatch, force a boat down into th  
  
water, or a piece of timber into the earth,  
than that it would lift them up, and carry  
them away.  
  
It has fo happened, that [ have not met  
with any account of fpouts that certainly  
defcended ; I fufpeé they are not frequent,  
Pleafe to communicate thofe you mention.  
  
The augmentation of the cloud, which,  
as I am informed, is generally, if not al-  
ways the cafe, during a fpout, feems to  
fhew an afcent, rather than a defcent of  
the matter of which fuch cloud is com-  
pofed ; for a defcending fpout, one would  
expeét, fhould diminifh a cloud. I own,  
however, that cold air defcending may,  
by condenfing the vapours in a lower re-  
gion, form and increafe clouds; which, I  
think, is generally the cafe in our com-  
mon thunder gufts, and, therefore, do not  
Jay great firefs upon this argument.  
  
Whirlwinds and fpouts are not always,  
though moft commonly, in the day-time.  
The terrible whirlwind which damaged a  
great part of Rome, June 11, 1749, hap-  
pened in the night of that day. The fame  
was fuppofed to have been firft a fpout,  
for it is faid to be beyond doubt, that it  
gathered in the neighbouring fea, as it  
could be tracked from Oftia to Rome. I  
find this in Pere Bofchovich’s account of it.  
  
In that account, the whirlwind is faid to  
have appeared as a very black, long, and  
lofty cloud, difcoverable, notwithftanding  
the darknefs of the night, by its continu-  
ally lightning or emitting flafhes on all  
fides, pufhing along with a furprifing fwift-  
nefs, and within three or four feet of the  
ground, Its general effeé&amp;ts on houfes,  
were, ftripping off the roofs, blowing a-  
way chimneys, breaking doors and win-  
dows, forcing up the floors, and unpaving  
the rooms, ({ome of thefe effects feem to  
agree well with a fuppofed vacuum in the  
¢enter of the whirlwind) and the very raf-  
ters of the houfes were bioke and difperfed,  
and even hurled againft houfes at a confi-  
derable diftance, &amp;c.  
  
&#x27;  
  
  
  
  
  
THE UNIVERSAL MAGAZINE  
  
It feems, by an expreffion of Pere Bof-  
chovich’s, 3s-if the wind blew from ai}  
fides towards the whirlwind ; for, having  
carefully obferved its effeéts, he concludes  
of all whirlwinds, * that their motion is  
circular, and the aétion attraétive,”  
  
He obferves, on a number of hiftories of  
whirlwinds, &amp;c. © that a common eff-é&amp;  
of them is to carry up into the air tiles,  
ftones, and animals themfelves, which hap-  
pen to be in their courle, and all kinds of  
bodies unexceptionably, throwing them to  
a confiderable diftance, with great impe-  
tuofity.” Such effeéts feem to thew a ri-  
fing current of arr.  
  
I will endeavour to explain my concep-  
tions of this matter by figures, reprefent-  
ing a plan and an elevation of a fpout or  
whirlwind.  
  
I would only firft beg to be allowed two  
or three pofitions.  
  
1. That the lower region of air is often  
ore heated, and fo more rarified, than  
the upper ; confequently, fpecifically light  
ee. Phe coldnefs of the upper region is  
manifefted by the hail which fometimes  
falls from it in a hot day.  
  
“a. That heated air may be very moift,  
and yet the moiftyre foequally diffufed and  
rarifed, as not to be vifible, till colder  
air mixes with it, when it condenfes, and  
becomes vifible. Thus our breath, invi-  
fible in fummer, becomes vifible in winter.  
  
Now, let us fuppofe a treét of land, or  
fea, of perhaps fixty miles fquare, un-  
{creened by clouds, and unfanned by winds,  
during great part of a fummer’s day, or, it  
may be, for feveral days fucceffively, till  
it is violently heated, together with the  
lower region of air in contaé&amp; with it, fo  
that the faid lower air becomes fpecifically  
lighter than the fuperincumbent higher re-  
gion of the atmofphere, in which the clouds  
commonly float: Let us fuppofe, alfo,  
that the air furrounding this traé&amp; has not  
been fo much heated during thofe days,  
and, therefore, remains heavier. The con-  
fequence of this fhould be, as I conceive,  
that the heated lighter air, being preffed  
on all fides, muit afcend; and the hea-  
vier defcend ; and, as this rifing cannot  
be in all parts, or the whole area of the  
tract at once, for that would leave too ex-  
tenfive a vacuum, the rifing will begin pre-  
cifely in that column that happens to be  
the ighteft, or moft rarified ; and the warm  
air will flow horizontally from a&#x27;l points  
tothiscolumn, where the feveral currents  
—— and joining to rife, a whirl is  
naturaily formed, in the fame manner as a  
whirl is formed in the tub of water, b  
the defcending fluid flowing from all  
  
fides

fides of the tub to the hole in the cen-  
ter.  
  
And, as the feveral currents arrive at  
this central rifing. column, with a confi-  
derable degree of horizontal motion, they  
cannot fuddenly change it to a vertical mo-  
tion ; therefore, as they gradually, in ap-  
proaching the whirl, decline from right  
td curve or cifcular lines, fo, having join-  
éd the whirl, they afcend by a fpiral mo-  
tion; in the fame manner as the water  
defcends fpirally through the hole in the  
tub before- mentioned.  
  
Laftly, as the lower air, and néareft the  
furface, is moft rarified by the heat of the  
fun, that air is moft a&amp;ted on by the pref-  
fure of the furrounding cold and heavy  
air, which is to take its place; confe-  
quently, its motion towards the whirl is  
{wifteft, and fo the force of the lower part  
of the whirl, ortrump, ftrongeft, and the  
centrifugal force of its particles greateft ;  
and hence the vacuum round the axis of  
the whirl thould be greateft near the earth  
or fea, and be gradually diminifhed as it  
Approaches the region of the clouds, till  
it ends in a point, as at A in fig. I]. form-  
ing a long and fharp cone.  
  
In Fig. I. which is a plan or ground«  
plot of a whirlwind, the circle V. repre-  
fents the central vacuum.  
  
Between aaaaand bbbb1 fuppofe a  
body of air condenfed ftrongly by tbe pref-  
fure of the currents moving towards it,  
from all fides without, and by its centri-  
fugal force from within; moving round  
with prodigious fwiftnels, (having, as it  
were, the momenta of all the currents u-  
nited in itfelf ) and with a power equal to  
its fwiftnefs and denfity.  
  
It is this whirling body of air between  
aaaa and 6566 that rifes fpirally ; by its  
force it tears buildings to pieces, twifts up  
great trees by the roots, &amp;c,. and, by {pi-  
tal motion, raifes the fragments fo high,  
till the preffure of the furrounding and  
approaching currents diminifhing, can no  
longer confine them to the circle; or  
thetr own centrifugal force increafing,  
grows too ftrong for fuch preffure, when  
they fly off in tangent lines, as ftones out  
of a fling, and fall on all fides and at  
great diftances.  
  
If it happeos at fea, the water under  
and between aaaa and bb bb will be vio-  
lently agitated and driven about, and parts  
of it raifed with the fpiral current, and  
thrown about, foas to form a buth like  
appearance.  
  
This circle is of various diameters,  
fometimes very large.  
  
If the vacuum pafles over water, the  
  
5  
  
FOR MARCH, 1769:  
  
  
  
rst  
water may tife in it in a body, or column,  
to near the he:ght of thirty-two feet.  
  
If it paffes over houfes, it may burt  
their windows or walls outwards, pluck  
off the roofs, and pluck up the floors, by  
the fudden rarefaction of the air contained  
within fuch buildings ; the outward pref-  
fure of the atmofphere being fuddenly  
taken off: So the ftopped bottle of air  
burfts upder the exhaufted receiver of the  
air-pump,.  
  
Fig. II. is to reprefent the elevation of  
a watet-fpout, wherein, I fuppofe PP P  
to be the cone, at firft a vacuam, till W W,  
the rifing column of water, has filled fo  
much of it. SSSS, the fpiral whirl of  
air furrounding the vacuum, and cont&#x27;nus  
ed higher in a clofe column after the va-  
cuum ends in the point P, till it reaches  
the cool region of the air. BB, the buth  
defcribed by Stuart, furrounding the foot  
of the column of water.  
  
Now, I fuppofe this whirl of air will,  
at firft, be as invifible as the air itfelf,  
though reaching, in reality, from the wa-  
ter, to the region of cool air, in which our  
low fummer thunder-clouds commonly  
float ; but prefently it will become vifible  
at its extremities. At its lower end, by  
the agitation of the water, under the whirl-  
ing part of the circle, between P and S,  
form:ng Stuart’s bufh, and by the {welling  
and rifing of the water, in the beginning  
vacuum, which is, at firft, a fmali, low,  
broad cone, whofe top gradually rifes and  
fharpens, as the force of the whirl in-  
creafes. At its upper end it becomes vi-  
fible, by the warm air brought up to the  
cooler region, where its moifture begins to  
be condenfed into thick vapour by the  
cold, and is feen firft at A, the higheft  
part, which, being now cooled, condenfes  
what rifes next at B, which condenfes that  
at C, and that condenfes what is rifing at  
D, the cold operating by the contaé&amp; of the  
vapours fafter in a right line downwards,  
than the vapours themfelves can climb in  
a fpiral line upwards; they climb, how-  
ever, and as, by continual addition they  
grow denfer, and, confequently, their cen-  
trifugal force greater, and, being rifen a-  
bove the concentrating currents that com-  
pofe the whirl, they fly off, ipread, and  
form a cloud.  
  
It feems eafy to conceive, how, by this  
facceffive condenfation from above, the  
{pout appears to drop or defcend from the  
cloud, though the materials of which it 1s  
compofed are all the while afcending.  
  
The condenfation of the moifture con-  
tained in fo great a quantity of warm air as  
may be fuppefed to rite in a thhert time if  
this  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
152  
  
this pfodigioufly rapid whirl, is, perhaps,  
fufficient to form a great extent of cloud,  
though the fpout fhould be over land; as  
thofe at Hatfield; and, if the land happens  
not to be very dufty, perhaps the lower  
  
rt of the fpout will fcarce become vifi-  
Fic at all; though the upper, or what is  
commonly called the defcending part, be  
very diftinAly feen.  
  
The fame may happen at fea, in cafe the  
whirl is not violent enough to make a high  
vacuum, and raife the column, &amp;c. In  
fuch caie, the upper part ABCD only  
will be vilible, and the bufh, perhaps, be-  
low.  
  
But if the whirl be ftrong, and there be  
much duft on the land, and the column  
WW be raifed from the water, then the  
Jower part becomes vifivle, and fometimes  
even united to the upper part. For the  
duft may be carried up in the fpiral whirl,  
till it reach the region where the vapour is  
condenfed, and rife with that even to the  
  
clouds: And the friétion of the whirling  
  
air, on the fides of the column W W, may  
detach great quantities of its water, break  
it into drops, and carry them up in the  
Spiral whirl mixed with the air ; the hea-  
vier drops may, indeed, fly off, and fall,  
in a fhower, round the {pout ; but much  
of it w li be broken into vapour, yet vifi-  
ble; and thus, in both cafes, by duft at  
Jand, and by water at iea, the whole  
tube may be darkened and rendered vifible,  
  
As the whirl weakens, the tube may (in  
appearance) feparate in the middle; the  
column of water fubfiding, and the fupe-  
rior condenléd part drawing up to the  
cloud. Yet ftil! the tube, or whirl of air,  
may remain intire, the middle only be-  
coming iovifible, as not containing vifible  
matte:.  
  
Dr. Stuart fays, ‘ It was obfervable of  
all the fpouts he faw, but more percepti-  
ble of the great one; that, towards the  
end, it began to appear like a hollow ca-  
nal, only black in the borders, but white  
in the middle ; and, though at firft it was  
altogether black and opaque, yet, how,  
one could very diitinétly perceive the fea-  
water to fly up along the middle of this ca-  
na), as fmoak up a chimney.”  
  
And Dr, Mather, defcribing a whirl-  
wind, fays, § a thick dark fmall cloud a-  
rofe, witha pillar of light in it, of about  
eight or ten feet diameter, and paffed a-  
long the ground in a traét not wider thana  
treet, horribly tearing up trees by the  
roots, blowing them up in the air like  
feathers, and throwing up ftones of great  
a to a confiderable height in the ay,  
  
¢.”  
  
  
  
  
  
THE UNIVERSAL MAGAZINE  
  
Thefe accounts, the one of water-fpout?,  
the other of a whirlwind, feem, in this par+  
ticular, to agree ; what one Gentleman de-  
fcribes as a tube, black in the borders, and  
white in the middle, the other calls a black  
cloud, with a pillar of light in it; the lat-  
ter expreffion has only a little more of the  
marvellous, but the thing is the fame,  
and it feems not very difficult to be under-  
ftood. When Dr. S:uart’s fpouts were  
full charged, that is, when the whirling  
pipe of air was filled between aaaa and  
6 bb4, fig. I. with quantities of drops, and  
vapour torn off from the column W W,  
fig. II. the whole was rendered fo dark,  
as that it could not be feen through, nor  
the fpiral afcending motion difcovered;  
but when the quantity alcending leflened,  
the pipe became more tran{parent, and the  
afcending motion vifible. Dr. Mather’s  
whirl was probably filled with duft, the  
fides were very dark, but the vacuum with-  
in rendering the middle more traniparent,  
he calls it a pillar of light.  
  
It was in this more tranfparent part, that  
Stuart could fee the fpiral motion of the  
vapours, whofe lines on the neareft and  
fartheft fide of the tran{parent part, crofling  
each other, reprefented fmoke afcending in  
achimney; for, the quantity being ftill too  
great in the line of fight through the fides  
of the tube, the motion could not be dif-  
covered there, and fo they reprefented the  
folid fides of the chimney.  
  
When the vapours reach in the pipe  
from the clouds rear to the earth, it is no  
wonder now to thofe who underftand e-  
lectricity, that flafhes of lightning fhoutd  
defcend by the fpout, asin that at Rome.  
  
But you objet, If water may be thus  
carried into the clouds, why have we no  
falt rains? The objeétion is ftrong and  
reafonable, and I know not whether I can  
an{wer it to your fatisfaction. I never heard  
but of one faltrain, and that was where a  
fpout paffed pretty near a thip, fo I fuppofe  
it to be only the drops thrown off from the  
{pout by the centrifugal force (as the birds  
were at Hatfield) when they had been car-  
ried fo h gh as to be above, or,to be too  
ftrongly centrifugal for, the preflure of  
the concurring winds furrounding it: And  
I believe there can be no other kind of fale  
rain; for it has pleafed the goodoefs of  
God fo to order it, that the particles of air  
will not attraé the particles of falt, though  
they ftrongly attra&amp; water.  
  
Hence, though all metals, even gold,  
may be united with au, and rendered vo-  
latile, fait remains fixt in the fire, and no  
heat can force it up to any confiderable  
height, oi oblige the air to bod it. Hence,

@hen falt rifes, as it will a little way, in-

off from the water by fome power in the

that, fo the watet quits the falt, and em-  
braces the air; but air will not embrace

aod plant on the face of the earth be de-

water, and carried over land, and there let  
fall in a body ; but this, I fuppofe, hap-  
pens rarely.  
  
Stuart defcribes his foouts as appearing  
no bigger than a maft, and fometimes  
lefs; byt they were feen at a league and  
a half diftance.  
  
I think I formerly read in Dampier, or  
fome other voyager, that a fpout in its pro-  
greffive motion went over a thip becalmed  
on the coaft of Guinea, and firft threw  
her down on one fide, carrying away her  
fore maft, then fuddeoly whipped her up,  
and threw her down onthe other fide, car-  
rying away her m zen -maft, and the whole  
was over in an inftant. I fuppofe the firft  
mifchief.was done by the fore-fide of the  
whirl, the latter by the hinder fide, their  
motion being contrary.  
  
I fuppofe a whirlwind, or fpout, may  
be ftationary, when the concurring winds  
are equal; but, if unequal, the whirl ac-  
quires a progreffive motion, in the direc-  
tion of the ftrongeft pre ffure.  
  
When the wind that gives the progref-  
five motion, becomes ftronger below than  
above, or above than below, the fpout  
will be bent, and, the caufe ceafing, ftrait-  
en again.

mot much nearer e eonclufion,  
im this matter of the f, out, than  
when I firft read your letter.  
  
Yet, hoping we may, in time,  
Gf eut the truth between us, I  
will fend you my prefent thot’s,  
with fome obfervations on your  
reafons, on the accounts in the  
tranfactions, and on other re

haps, while I am writing, fome  
mew light may firike me, for!  
fhall now be obliged to confides  
the fubjett with a little more  
attention.  
  
I sgree with you, that, by  
means of a vacuum in a whiri  
wind, water cannet be fuppofed  
to rife in large mafles to the  
region of the clouds ; fer the  
preffure of the furrounding at-  
mofphere could net foree it up  
in acontineed body, or column,  
to a muck greater height than  
thirty feet. But, if there really  
is a vacuum in the center, or  
pear the axis of whirlwinds,  
then, I think, water may rife in  
fuch vacuum to that height, or  
to a lefs height, as the vacuom  
may be lefs perfect.  
  
1 had not read Siuart’s account  
in the tranfadions, for many  
years, before the receipt of  
your letter, and had quite fer.  
got it ; but now, on viewing his  
draughts, and confidering his  
defcriptions, I think they feem  
to favour my hypothefis ; for  
hie defcribes and draws columns  
of water, of various keights, ter-  
minating abruptly at the top,  
exadtly as water would do, when  
forced up by the preffure of the  
atmofphere, into an exhaufted  
tube.

“« cupping glafS .o the fleth, the

in my paper, J fappofed J  
whi:lwind and a {pout to be the  
jame thing, and to proceed from  
the fame eaufe ; the only difter-  
ence between them being, that  
the one pafies over land, the  
other over water. | find, alfo,  
in the tranfactiens, that M. de Ja  
Pryme was of the fame opinion ;  
for he there deicribes two {pouts,  
as he ealls them, which were  
jeen at different times, at Hat-  
field in Yorkfhire, whote appear-  
ances in the air were the iame  
with thofe of the {pouts at fea,  
and effects the fame with thofe  
of real whirlwinds.  
  
Whirlwinds have, generally, a  
pregreflive, as weil as a circular  
motion ; fo had what is called  
the fpout, at Toptham. (See the  
account of it in the tranfactions)  
which alfo appears, by its effects  
deicribed, to have been a real  
whirlwind. Water-{pouts have,  
alfo, a progretiive motion ; this  
is fometimes greater, and fome-  
times leis; in fome violent, in  
others barely perceivable. The  
whirlwind at Warrington con-  
tinued leng in Acrement.-clofe.  
  
Whirlwinds generally arife  
after calms and great heats;  
The fame is cbhierved of water  
{pouts,which are, therefore, moft  
frequentin the warm latitudes.  
The fpeut that happened in cold  
weather, in the Downs, defcribed  
by Mr Gordon in the traniacti-  
ons, was, for that reafon, tho&#x27;s

For  
  
extraordinary ; but he remarks  
withal, that the weather though  
cold when the fpout sppeared,  
was foon after much colder, as  
we find it, commonly, lefs warm  
after a whiriwind.  
  
You agree, that the wind  
blows every way towards a whirl.  
wind, from a large {pace round.  
An intelligent whaleman of Nan  
tucket, informed me, that three  
of their veffels, which were out  
in fearch of whales, happening  
to be beealmed, lay in fight of  
éach other, at about a league  
diftance, if I remember right,  
nearly forming a triangle’: After  
fometime,a water {pout appeared  
near the middle of the triangle,  
when a brifk breeze of wind  
fprung up, and every veff-!  
made fail ; and then it appeared  
to them all, by the fetting of  
the fails, and the courfe each  
vellel ftood, that the fpout was  
to the leeward of every one of  
them ; and they all declared it  
to have been fo when they hap-  
pened afterwards in company,  
and came to confer about it,  
$o that in this particular likewife  
whirlwinds and water fpouts  
agree.  
  
But, if that which appears a  
water-(pout at fea, does fome  
times, in its progreffive motion,  
rocet with and pafs over land,  
and there produce all the pha-  
nomena and effects of a whirl.  
wind, it fhould thence feem {til  
more evident, that a whirlwind  
and a fpout are the fame. I fend  
you, herewith, a letter from an  
ingenious phyfician of my ac-  
quaintance, which gives one in  
ftance of this, that fell within  
his obfervation.  
  
A fluid, moving from all points  
horizontajly, towards a center,

ordefcend. Water being in at ub,if  
a hole be opened in the middle of  
the bei tom, willflew from all fides,  
towards a center, and there de«  
fcend ina whirl. But, air how.  
ing on and near the furface of  
lend or water, from all fides, tas  
wards a center, mult, at that cen-  
ter, afcend , the land or water  
hindering its defcent.  
  
Ifthefe cencentring currents  
of air be in the upper region,  
they may. indeed, defcend im  
the fpout or whirlwind ; bat  
then, when the united current  
reached the earth or water, ig  
would {pread, and probably, biow  
every way from the eenter.  
There may be whirlwinds of  
both kinds, but, frem the com-  
monly obferved effects, i fufpr&amp;  
the rifing one to be the moft  
common : When the upper air  
defeends, it is perhaps, in #  
greater body, extending wider,  
as in our thunder-guits, and  
without muel whirling ; and,  
when air d-feends in « fpour, or  
whirlwind, { thould rather exp &amp;  
it would prefs the roof ofa houfe  
inwads, or force in the tiles,  
fhingles, or thatch, force a boat  
dewn inte the warer, or a piece  
of timber im’ che earth, than  
that it w-nald lift them wp, and  
catry them away.  
  
It has fo happened, that I have  
not met with avy asecounts  
of fpouts, that certainly de-  
fcended ; 1 fufpect they are not  
frequent, Pleafe to communi-  
cate thofe, you mention, The  
apparent dropping of a pipe  
from the clouds towards the  
earth or fea, I will endeavour to  
explain hereafter.  
  
The augmentation of the  
cloud, which, as I am informed,  
is generally, if not always the  
cafe, during a fpout, feems to

ya4 The Rovan AMERICAN MAGAZINE,  
  
fhew an afcent rather than a de.  
fcent of the matter of which  
fuch cloud is compofed ; for a  
defeending fpout, one would ex.  
pect, fhould diminifh a eloud. 1  
own, however, that cold air def-  
cending, may, by condenfing the  
vapours in a lower region, form  
and increafe clouds ; which, !  
think, is generally the cafe in  
eur common thunder-gufls, and  
therefore, +!o not lay great flref:  
en this argument  
  
Whirlwinds aud fponts, are not  
elways, though moft commonly,  
in the day time. The terrible  
whirlwind which domeged a  
great part of Rome, Juve 11,  
1749. happened in the night of  
thatday. The fime was fuppof  
ed to have been fir(t a fpout, fos  
it is fiid to be beyond doub ,that  
it gathered in the neighbouring  
fea, as it could be tracked from  
O&#x27;tiato Rome. I find this in  
Pere Boichovich’s account of i‘,  
15 abridged ip the Mon hly Ke-  
view for December, 1750  
  
In that account, the whirl  
wind is faid to have appeared as  
a very black, long, and lofiy  
cloud, difcoverable, not with-  
ftanding the darknefs of the  
night, by its continually ligkin  
ing or emitting flufhes on all  
fides, puthing along with a tur-  
prifing fwiftnefs,and within three  
or four feet of the ground. Its  
general cff-cts on houfes, were,  
{tripping off the roofs blowing  
away chimneys, breaking doors  
and windows, forcing up the  
floors, and unpaving the reoms,  
(fome of thefe effects f2em to  
agree well with a fuppofed va.  
cuum in the center of the whirl.  
wind) and the very rafters of  
the houfes were broke and dif  
perfed, and even hurled againft  
houfes at a confiderable djf-  
tance, kc.  
  
  
  
It f-ems, by an expreffion of  
Pere Bofchovich’s, as if the  
wind blew from all fides towards  
the whirlwind ; far, boving care-  
fully obferved its eff. &amp;s, he cow-  
cludes of all whirlwinds, * thet  
‘ their motion is circular, and  
‘© their aclion attractive,”  
  
Hic obfiives, on a vunber of  
hiftori s of whir&#x27;winds &amp;c. “shat  
‘* a common eflect of them is, te  
‘ carry up into the air tiles,  
*€ ftones and animals themfelves  
‘s which happen to be in their  
** courfe, and all kinds of bodies  
* unexceptionabie, throwing  
‘© them to a confiderable dii-  
* tance, with great impetuofi-  
‘* ty.” Such efiecis feem to (hew  
a rifiog current of air,  
  
I wiilendeavour to explain my  
conceptions of this matter by  
figures, reprefanting a plan and  
in elevation of a {peut or whirl-  
wind.  
  
I would only firlt beg to be  
allowed two or three politions,  
  
1. That the lower region of  
air is often more heated and fo  
more rarified than the upper;  
confequently ,fpecifically lighter.  
The coldnefs of the upper region  
is manif-fted by the hail which  
fomctimes falls trom it in a het  
day.  
  
2 That heated air may be very  
moilt, and yet the moiiture fe  
equally diffufed and rarified, as  
not to be vifible till colder air  
inixes with it, when it condenfes,  
and becomes vifible. Thus our  
breath, invifible in fummer, be-  
comes vifibl. ia winter.  
  
Now, let us fuppofe a tract of  
land, or fa, of perhaps, fixty  
miles fquare,unfcreened by clouds  
and untanned by wiods, during  
great part of a fummer&#x27;s day, or,  
ic may be, for feveral doys fuc-  
ceflively, till it is violently heat,

For S EPT E  
  
ed, together with the lower re-  
gion of air in contact with it,  
fo, that the faid lower air be-  
comes fpeeifically lighter than  
the fuperincumbent higher re-  
gion of the atmofphere, in which  
the clouds commonly fieat: Let  
us fuppofe, alfo, that the air fur-  
rounding this tract has mot been  
fo much heated during thofe  
days, and, therefore, remains  
heavier. The conftquener of  
this fhould be, as 1 conceive, that  
the heated lighter air, being  
preffed on all tides, muft afcend,  
and the heavier defcend ; and,  
as this rifing cannot be in all  
parts, or the whole area of the  
tract at once, for that would  
leave too extenfive a vacuum,  
the rifing will begin precifely  
in that column that happens to  
be the lightett, or moft rarified ;  
and the warm air will flow hori  
zontally from all points to this  
column, where the feveral cur-  
rents meeting, and joining to  
rife, a whirl is naturally formed,  
in the fame manner as a whirl is  
formed in the tub of water, by  
the defcending fiuid flowing  
from all fides of the tub, to the  
hole in the center.  
  
And, as the feveral currents  
atrive at this central rifing co-  
jumn, with a contiderable degree  
of horizontal motion, they can-  
not {uddenly change it toa ver-  
tical motion ; therefore, as they  
gradually, in approaching the  
whirl, decline from right to  
curve ercircular lines, fo, having  
  
‘ joined the whirl, they aicend by  
  
a {piral motion; in the fame  
manner as the water defcends  
fpirally through the hole in the  
tub before. mentioned.  
  
Laftly, as the lower air, and  
neareft the furface, is moft rari-  
fied by theheat that of the fun,  
  
  
  
M BE R, 1774. 346  
thatair is moft oct d on by the pref-  
fure of the furrounding cold and  
heavy air, which is to take its  
place ; confeqnently, its motion  
towards the whirl is (wifie, and  
fo the force of the lower part of  
the whiri, or tramp, ftror geft,  
and the centrifugal fo ce of its  
particles preateft ; and hence  
the vacuum round the axis of  
the whirl fhould be greateft near  
the earth or fea, and be gradual-  
ly diminifhed «ss it approaches  
the region of the clouds, till it  
ends in a point, as at A in Fig.  
ll. forming a long and fharp  
cone.  
  
In Fig. I, which is a plain or  
groand-plat of a whirlwind, the  
circle V. reprefints the central  
vacuum.  
  
Between aaaa and bbbbI fup-  
pofe a body of air condenfed  
itrongly by the preflure of the  
currents moving towards it,  
from all fides without, and by  
its centrifugal force from with.  
in; moving round with predi-  
gious {wiftnefs, (having, as it  
were,the momenta of a}] the cur-  
rents united in itfelf) and with  
a power equal to its fwiftnefs  
and denfity.  
  
Itis this whirling body of air  
between aaaa and bbbb that rifes  
fpirally ; by its force it tears  
buildings to pieces, twifls up  
pre at tr™s by the roots, Ke, and,  
by its fpiral motion, raifes the  
fragments fo high, till the pref-  
fure of the furrounding and ap-  
proaching currents diminifhing,  
can no longer confine them to

If it happens at fea, the water  
énder and between aaaa and bbbb  
will be violently agitated and  
driven about, and parts of it  
raifed with the fpiral current,  
and thrown about, fo as to form  
a but like appearance.  
  
This circle is of various di-  
ameters, fometimes very large.  
  
If the vacuum pafles over  
water, the water may rife in i  
in a body, or column, to near  
the height of thirty two feet,  
  
If it paffes over houfes, it may  
burft their windows or walls out  
wards, pluck off the roots, and  
plack up the floors, by the fud  
den rarefaction of the air con-  
tained within fuch buildings ;  
the outward preflure of the at.  
mofphere being fuddenly taken  
off : So the ftopped botile oi  
air burits underthe exhaufted re-  
eciver of the air pump.  
  
Fic. Il. Is to repreient the ele-  
vation of a water {pout wherein,  
I fuppofe PPP to be the ceone, at  
firft a vacuum, till WW, the  
rifing column of water has filled  
fo much of it. SSSS, the {piral  
whirl of air furrounding the va-  
cuum, and contineed higher in  
a clofe cclamn afier the va-  
cuum ends in the point P, till it  
reaches the ceol region of the  
air. BB, the buth de(cribed by  
Stuart, furrounding the toot of  
the column of water.  
  
Now, I fuppofe this whirl of  
air will, at firft, be as invifible  
as the air itfelf, though reaching  
in reality, from the water, to  
the region of cool air, in which  
our low fummer thunder clouds  
commonly float ; but prefently  
it will become vifible at its ex.  
tremities. At itslower end, by  
the agi‘ation of the water, under  
the whirling part of the circle,  
bstweem P and S, ferming Stu-  
  
  
  
art’s bufh, and by the fwelling  
and rifing of the water, in the  
b-ginning vacuum, which is, at  
fii(t, a fimall, low, broad cone,  
whofe top gradually trifes and  
fharpens, as the force of the whirl  
encreof+s. At its upper end it  
becom&lt;s vifible, by the warm ait  
brought up (0 the cooler region,  
where its moifture begius to be  
condenfed into thick vapour, by  
the cold; and is feen firit at A,  
the higheft part, which being  
now cooled, condentes what rifes  
next at B, which condenfes that  
at C, and that condenfes what  
is rifing at D, the cold operating  
by the contact of the vapours  
fatter in ar&#x27;ght line downwards,  
than the vapours themtelves can  
climb ina fpiral line upwards ;  
tuey climb, however, and as by  
continual addition they grow  
denier, and, conquently, their  
centrifugal force preater, and  
being rifen above the concen-  
trating currents that compofe  
the wihitl, they fly off, {pread,  
and form a cloud.  
  
It feems eafy to conceive, bow,  
by this fucceflive condenfation  
from above, the fpout appears to  
drop or defcend fiom the cloud,  
through the materials of which it  
is compofed, are all the while  
afcending.  
  
The condenfation of the moif-  
ture contained in fo preat a  
quantity of warm air as may be  
fuppofed to rife ina ihort time  
in this prodigion@ly rapid whirl,  
is, perhaps, fufficieut to form a  
great extent of cleud, though  
the {pout fhould be over land, as  
thofe at Matfield ; and if the  
land happens not to be very dufty,  
perhaps the lower part of the  
fpout will fcarce become viiible  
at all; though the upper, or  
what isyéeumonly called, the  
  
dcicending

Jy feen.  
  
The fame may happen at fea,  
in cafe the whirl is not violent  
enough to make a high vacuum,  
and raife the eolumn, kc. In  
fuch cafe, the upper part A BC  
only will be vifible, and the buth,  
perhaps, below.  
  
But if che whirl be ftrong, and  
there be much duft on the lard,  
and the solumm W W be raifed  
from the water, then the lowe:  
part becomes vifible, and {ome.  
times even united to the upper  
part. For the duft may be car  
ried up in the fpiral whirl. cill it  
reach the region where the va  
pour is coudenfed, and rile with  
that even to the clouds : And  
the friction of the whirling air,  
on the fides of the column W W,  
may detach great quantities of  
its water, break it into drops.and  
earry them up ia the (piral whirl  
mixed with the air ; the heavier  
dropsmay, inded, fly off, and  
fall in a fhower round the {pout ;  
bat much of it wilbe broek n  
into vapour, yet vifible ; and thus  
in both cafes by duit at land,and  
by water at fea, the whole tubc  
may be darkened and rendered  
vifible.  
  
As the whirl weakens, the tube  
may {in appearance: ) (cparate in  
the middle ; the column of water  
fubfidiag, and the faperior con  
denftd part drawing wp ta the  
gloud. Yet (till the tube or whirl  
ef air may remain intire, the  
middle only becoming invifible,  
as not containing vifible matter.  
  
Dr. Stuart fays, * It was ob  
¢ fervable of all the f{pouts he  
faw, but more preceptible of  
¢‘ the great one; that towards  
é the end it brgan to appear like

‘ was altogether black and oga-  
* qu’, yet, now, one could very  
‘ diftindt!y perceive the fea- wat-  
‘ er to fly up along the middle  
‘ of this canal, as fmoak upa  
‘ chimney.’  
  
And Dr. Mather, deferibing a  
whirlwind, fays, ‘a thick dark  
‘ fmall cloud arofe, with a pillar  
‘ of light in it, of about eight or  
‘ten feet di:meter, and pailed  
* along the ground in a tract not  
‘ wider than a ftreet, horribly  
‘ tearing up trees by the roots,  
‘ blowing them up in the air  
‘ like feathers, and throwing  
‘ up flones of great weight te uw  
‘ confiderable height in the air,  
6 ke.  
  
Thefe accounts, the one of  
water-fpouts,the other of a whirl-  
wiud, feem in this particular, ta  
agree ; what one gentleman de-  
icribes as a tube,black in the bor-  
ders, and white in the middle,  
the ether calls a black cloud,  
with a pillar of light in it: the  
latter expr¢flion has only a little  
more of the marvellous, but the  
hing is the fame ; aud it feems  
not very difficult te underitand,  
When Dr. Stuart’s f{pouts were  
fuil charged, that is, when the  
whitling pipe of air was filled

that between the arrows ¢ and d,  
will appear much darker than  
that between 4 and c, as there  
muft be many more of thofe opa-  
que particles in the line of vifion  
acrofs the fides, than acrofs the

na microfcope evidently appears  
to be a pipe, the fides fhhewing  
darker than the middle. Dr.  
Mather’s whitl was probably fill  
ed with dull, the fides were very  
dark, but the vacuom within  
rendering themiddle more tranf  
  
parent, he calls it a pillar of  
  
Nigh,

When the vapours reach in the  
pipe from the clouds near to the  
earth, it is no wonder now to  
thofe who underftand Electricity,  
thac flathes of lightning fhould  
deicend by the {pout as ip that at  
Rome.  
  
But you obje&amp;, If water may  
be thus carried into the clouds,  
whv have we no falt rains ? The  
objection is ftrong and reafonable,  
and | know not whether I can  
antweritto your fatisfaction. I  
  
never heard of but one ialt rain, |

and that was where a fpont paff-  
ed pretty near a (hip,fo I fuf pole  
it to be only the drops thrown  
eff from the fpout, by the centii-  
fugal force (as the birds were at  
Ha&#x27;fie&#x27;d) when they hed been  
carried to high as to be above, or  
to be too ttrongly centrifugal ter  
the preflure of the concurring  
winds furrounding it: And, in-  
deed believe there canbe noothrr  
kind of faltrain; for it has ploaf-  
ed the goodue{s of God fo to ord-  
er it,that the particles of air will  
not attract the particles of fair,  
though they ttrongly attract wat-  
er.  
  
Hence, though al! metals, even  
gold, may be united with air,  
and rendered volatile, tilt re-  
mains fixedin the fire, aud no  
heat can force it up io any con-  
fiderable heighr, or oblige the air  
to hold it. Hence, when falc  
rifes, as it will a Jittle way, into  
air with water, there is inttant-  
ly 2 feparation mede; the par-  
ticles ot water adhere to the air  
and the particies of fale fall  
down again, as if repelled and  
forced off from the water by  
fome power in the air; or, ag  
fone metals ditfolved in a proper  
menflruum, will quit the fol-  
vent when other matter ap-  
proaches, and adhere to that, fo  
the water quits the falt, and em-  
braces the air; but air will not  
embrace the falt, and quit the  
water, otherwife our rains would  
indeed be falt, and every tree  
and plant on the face of the  
earth be deltroyed, with all the  
animals that depend on them for

By fome accounts of feamen, it  
eems the column of water,W W,  
fometimes falls fuddenly ; andif  
at be,as (ome fay, fifteen or twen-  
ty yards diameter, it muft fall  
with great foree, and they may  
Well fear for their thips. By one  
account in the tranfactions of a  
{pout that fell at Colne in Lan-  
cafhire, one woald think the co.  
Jumn is fometimes lifted off from  
the waver, and carried over Jand,  
and there let fall in a body ; but  
this, I fuppofe, happens rarely.  
  
Stuart defcribes his f{pouts as  
appearing no bigger than a matt  
and fometimes lefs ; but they  
were fcenat a league and an half  
dittance,  
  
I think J formerly read in  
Dampier, or fome other voyager,  
that a fpeuc, in irs progreflive  
motion, went over a thip becalm  
ed,on the coaft of Guinea, and  
firit threw her down on one Gde,  
carrying away her forematt,then  
‘faddenly whipped her up, and  
threw her down on the other  
fine, carrying away her misen-  
malt, and the whole was over in  
an inflant. [ fuppofe the firft  
mifchief was done by the forefide  
of the whirl, the latter by the  
hinder fide, their motion being  
contrary.  
  
i fuppofe a whirlwind,or fpout,  
may be ftationary, when the  
concurring winds are equal ; but  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
if unequal, the whirl acquires a  
progreflive motion, in the diree-  
tion of the frongeft preffure.  
  
When the wind that gives the  
progreflive motien, becomes  
frouger below, or above than  
below, the fpout will be bent  
and the caufe ceafing, firaiten  
again.  
  
Your queries, towards the end  
of your paper, appear judicious,  
and worth eonfidering. At pre-  
fent lam not furnifhed with fads  
iuilicient to make any pertinent

has already a fufficient quantity  
of conjecture.  
  
Your manner of 2ceommodat-  
ing the accounts to your hypo-

own, ingenious ; and perhaps  
that hypothefis may be true. [

The terrible whirlwind which damaged a great part of Rome  
in June 11, 1749, was supposed to be originally a spout, as it  
could be traced from Ostea to Rome.  
  
In that account the whirlwind is said to have appeared as a  
very black, long and lofty cloud, which was rendered visible,
