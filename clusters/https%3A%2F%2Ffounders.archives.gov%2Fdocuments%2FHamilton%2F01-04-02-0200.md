 a more particular examination of the several parts of the government. I shall begin with the House of Representatives.  
The first view to be taken of this part of the government, relates to the qualifications of the electors and the elected. Those of the former are to be the same with those of the electors of the most numerous branch of the State Legislatures. The definition of the right of suffrage is very justly regarded as a fundamental article of republican government. It was incumbent on the Convention therefore to define and establish this right, in the Constitution. To have left it open for the occasional regulation of the Congress, would have been improper for the reason just mentioned. To have submitted it to the legislative discretion of the States, would have been improper for the same reason; and for the additional reason, that it would have rendered too dependent on the State Governments, that branch of the Fœderal Government, which ought to be dependent on the people alone. To have reduced the different qualifications in the different States, to one uniform rule, would probably have been as dissatisfactory to some of the States, as it would have been difficult to the Convention. The provision made by the Convention appears therefore, to be the best that lay within their option. It must be satisfactory to every State; because it is conformable to the standard already established, or which may be established by the State itself. It will be safe to the United States; because, being fixed by the State Constitutions, it is not alterable by the State Government,

Under these reasonable limitations, the door of this part of the Fœderal Government, is open to merit of every description, whether native or adoptive, whether young or old, and without regard to poverty or wealth, or to any particular profession of religious faith.

the States might attempt to break up the govern-­  
ment by not sending representatives, and then only  
for national self-preservation. But the question of  
suffrage was wisely put beyond the control of Con­  
gress, and it was provided that &quot;the electors in  
each State shall have the qualification requisite  
for electors of the most numerous branch of  
the State Legislature.&quot; This settlement of the  
right of suffrage was regarded &quot;as a fun-­  
damental article of republican government.&quot;  
The question of suffrage is thus withdrawn irom  
the capricious or more dangerous interterence of  
Congress. It is not left to legislative discretion in  
the States, but is fixed by the State constitutions:

served by Mr. Madison in the “ Federalist,”

lation of such laws, and their names shall be re-  
ceived and registered by the various buards of  
registration at the time and in the manner re-

** The definition of the right of suftrage is  
very justly regarded as a fundamental  
article of Republican government.”
