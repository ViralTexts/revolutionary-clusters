Courteous Reader,  
I might in this place attempt to gain thy Favour, by declaring that I write Almanacks with no other View than that of the publick Good; but in this I should not be sincere; and Men are now a-days too wise to be deceiv’d by Pretences how specious soever. The plain Truth of the Matter is, I am excessive poor, and my Wife, good Woman, is, I tell her, excessive proud; she cannot bear, she says, to sit spinning in her Shift of Tow, while I do nothing but gaze at the Stars; and has threatned more than once to burn all my Books and Rattling-Traps (as she calls my Instruments) if I do not make some profitable Use of them for the good of my Family. The Printer has offer’d me some considerable share of the Profits, and I have thus begun to comply with my Dame’s desire.  
Indeed this Motive would have had Force enough to have made me publish an Almanack many Years since, had it not been overpower’d by my Regard for my good Friend and Fellow-Student, Mr. Titan Leeds, whose Interest I was extreamly unwilling to hurt: But this Obstacle (I am far from speaking it with Pleasure) is soon to be removed, since inexorable Death, who was never known to respect Merit, has already prepared the mortal Dart, the fatal Sister has already extended her destroying Shears, and that ingenious Man must soon be taken from us. He dies, by my Calculation made at his Request, on Oct. 17. 1733. 3 ho. 29 m. P.M. at the very instant of the ♂ of ☉ and ☿: By his own Calculation he will survive till the 26th of the same Month. This small difference between us we have disputed whenever we have met these 9 Years past; but at length he is inclinable to agree with my Judgment; Which of us is most exact, a little Time will now determine. As therefore these Provinces may not longer expect to see any of his Performances after this Year, I think my self free to take up the Task, and request a share of the publick Encouragement; which I am the more apt to hope for on this Account, that the Buyer of my Almanack may consider himself, not only as purchasing an useful Utensil, but as performing an Act of Charity, to his poor Friend and Servant  
R. Saunders

More nice than wise.  
Old Batchelor would have a Wife that’s wise,  
Fair, rich, and young, a Maiden for his Bed;  
Not proud, nor churlish, but of faultless size;  
A Country Houswife in the City bred.  
He’s a nice Fool, and long in vain hath staid;  
He should bespeak her, there’s none ready made.  
  
Never spare the Parson’s wine, nor the Baker’s pudding.  
  
Visits should be short, like a winters day,  
Lest you’re too troublesom hasten away.  
  
A house without woman and Firelight, is like a body without soul or sprite.  
Kings and Bears often worry their keepers.  
XII Mon. February hath xxviii days.  
N. N. of B---s County, pray don’t be angry with poor Richard.  
Each Age of Men new Fashions doth invent;  
Things which are old, young Men do not esteem:  
What pleas’d our Fathers, doth not us content;  
What flourish’d then, we out of fashion deem:  
And that’s the reason, as I understand,  
Why Prodigus did sell his Father’s Land.  
Light purse, heavy heart.  
He’s a Fool that makes his Doctor his Heir.  
Ne’er take a wife till thou hast a house (and a fire) to put her in.  
  
He’s gone, and forgot nothing but to say Farewel—to his creditors.  
Love well, whip well.  
I Mon. March hath xxxi days.  
  
My Love and I for Kisses play’d,  
She would keep stakes, I was content,  
But when I won she would be paid;  
This made me ask her what she meant:  
Quoth she, since you are in this wrangling vein,  
Here take your Kisses, give me mine again.  
Let my respected friend J. G.  
Accept this humble verse of me. viz.  
Ingenious, learned, envy’d Youth,  
Go on as thou’st began;  
Even thy enemies take pride  
That thou’rt their countryman.  
Hunger never saw bad bread.  
II Mon. April hath xxx days.  
Kind Katharine to her husband kiss’d these words,  
“Mine own sweet Will, how dearly I love thee!”  
If true (quoth Will) the World no such affords.  
And that its true I durst his warrant be;  
For ne’er heard I of Woman good or ill,  
But always loved best, her own sweet Will.  
Beware of meat twice boil’d, and an old foe reconcil’d.  
Great Talkers, little Doers.  
A rich rogue, is like a fat hog, who never does good til as dead as a log.  
Relation without friendship, friendship without power, power without will, will witho[ut] effect, effect without profit, and profit without vertue, are not worth a farto.  
  
III Mon. May hath xxxi days.  
Mirth pleaseth some, to others ’tis offence,  
Some commend plain conceit, some profound sense;  
Some wish a witty Jest, some dislike that,  
And most would have themselves they know not what.  
Then he that would please all, and himself too,  
Takes more in hand than he is like to do.  
Eat to live, and not live to eat.  
March windy, and April rainy,  
Makes May the pleasantest month of any.  
The favour of the Great is no inheritance.  
Fools make feasts and wise men eat ’em.  
Beware of the young Doctor and the old Barber.  
He has chang’d his one ey’d horse for a blind one.  
The poor have little, beggars none, the rich too much, enough not one.  
IV Mon. June hath xxx days.  
“Observe the daily circle of the sun,  
And the short year of each revolving moon:  
By them thou shalt forsee the following day,  
Nor shall a starry night thy hopes betray.  
When first the moon appears, if then she shrouds  
Her silver crescent, tip’d with sable clouds,  
Conclude she bodes a tempest on the main,  
And brews for fields impetuous floods of rain.”  
After 3 days men grow weary, of a wench, a guest, and weather rainy.  
To lengthen thy Life, lessen thy Meals.  
The proof of gold is fire, the proof of woman, gold; the proof of man, a woman.  
After feasts made, the maker scratches his head.  
  
V Mon. July hath xxxi days.  
“Ev’n while the reaper fills his greedy hands,  
And binds the golden sheafs in brittle bands:  
Oft have I seen a sudden storm arise  
From all the warring winds that sweep the skies:  
And oft whole sheets descend of slucy rain,  
Suck’d by the spungy clouds from off the main;  
The lofty skies at once come pouring down,  
The promis’d crop and golden labours drown.”  
Neither Shame nor Grace yet Bob.  
Many estates are spent in the getting,  
Since women for tea forsook spinning and knitting.  
He that lies down with Dogs, shall rise up with fleas.  
A fat kitchin, a lean Will.  
Distrust and caution are the parents of security.  
Tongue double, brings trouble.  
VI Mon. August hath xxxi days.  
“For us thro’ 12 bright signs Apollo guides  
The year, and earth in sev’ral climes divides.  
Five girdles bind the skies, the torrid zone  
Glows with the passing and repassing sun.  
Far on the right and left, th’extreams of heav’n,  
To frosts and snows and bitter blasts are giv’n.  
Betwixt the midst and these, the Gods assign’d  
Two habitable seats for humane kind.”  
Take counsel in wine, but resolve afterwards in water.  
He that drinks fast, pays slow.  
Great famine when wolves eat wolves.  
A good Wife lost is God’s gift lost.  
A taught horse, and a woman to teach, and teachers practising what they preach.  
He is ill cloth’d, who is bare of Virtue.  
  
VII Mon. September hath xxx days.  
  
Death is a Fisherman, the world we see  
His Fish-pond is, and we the Fishes be:  
His Net some general Sickness; howe’er he  
Is not so kind as other Fishers be;  
For if they take one of the smaller Fry,  
They throw him in again, he shall not die:  
But Death is sure to kill all he can get,  
And all is Fish with him that comes to Net.  
The heart of a fool is in his mouth, but the mouth of a wise man is in his heart.  
Men and Melons are hard to know.  
He’s the best physician that knows the worthlessness of the most medicines.  
Beware of meat twice boil’d, and an old Foe reconcil’d.  
A fine genius in his own country, is like gold in the mine.  
There is no little enemy.  
VIII Mon. October hath xxxi days.  
Time was my spouse and I could not agree,  
Striving about superiority:  
The text which saith that man and wife are one,  
Was the chief argument we stood upon:  
She held, they both one woman should become;  
I held they should be man, and both but one.  
Thus we contended daily, but the strife  
Could not be ended, till both were one Wife.  
He has

is pleasing tongue,  
Hath won a Girl that’s rich, wise, fair and young;  
The Match (he saith) is half concluded, he  
Indeed is wondrous willing; but not she.  
And reason good, for he has run thro’ all  
Almost the story of the Prodigal;  
Yet swears he never with the hogs did dine;  
That’s true, for none would trust him with their swine.  
Where bread is wanting, all’s to be sold.  
There is neither honour nor gain, got in dealing with a vil-lain.  
The fool hath made a vow, I guess,  
Never to let the Fire have peace.  
Snowy winter, a plentiful harvest.  
Nothing more like a Fool, than a drunken Man.  
X Mon. December hath xxxi days.  
She that will eat her breakfast in her bed,  
And spend the morn in dressing of her head,  
And sit at dinner like a maiden bride,  
And talk of nothing all day but of pride;  
God in his mercy may do much to save her,  
But what a case is he in that shall have her.  
God works wonders now and then;  
Behold! a Lawyer, an honest Man!  
He that lives carnally, won’t live eternally.  
Innocence is its own Defence.  
Time eateth all things, could old Poets say;  
The Times are chang’d, our times drink all away.  
Never mind it, she’l be sober after the Holidays.  
  
The Benefit of going to Law.  
Dedicated to the Counties of K—t and H-n–––rd-n.  
  
Two Beggars travelling along,  
One blind, the other lame,  
Pick’d up an Oyster on the Way  
To which they both laid claim:  
The Matter rose so high, that they  
Resolv’d to go to Law,  
As often richer Fools have done,  
Who quarrel for a Straw.  
A Lawyer took it strait in hand,  
Who knew his Business was,  
To mind nor one nor t’other side,  
But make the best o’ th’ Cause;  
As always in the Law’s the Case:  
So he his Judgment gave,  
And Lawyer-like he thus resolv’d  
What each of them should have:  
Blind Plaintiff, lame Defendant, share  
The Friendly Laws impartial Care,  
A Shell for him, a Shell for thee,  
The Middle is the Lawyer’s Fee

Whenever (says the author of ‘* Modern Pilgrims’’)  
you see a woman who receives with avidity tales  
of seandal, who has, in one word, a poor opinion of  
her sex, then be sure you have in your presence one  
whose heart is the home of sensuality. One single  
glance of her eye stamps her as dark and dishonest.  
  
A wife once kissed her husband and said,  
‘“‘ My own sweet Will, how dearly I love thee.”’  
Who ever knew a lady, good or ill,  
Who did not love her own sweet will ?  
This is good, but ‘‘alas it was borrowed’’ from  
‘¢ Poor Richard,’’ who says in April 1733-+  
Kind Katharine to her husband kiss’d these words,  
‘«‘ Mine own sweet Will, how dearly I love thee !”’  
  
“Tf true,’’ quoth Will, ‘‘the world no such man  
affords.’’  
  
And that it’s true I durst his warrant be ;  
For ne’er heard I of woman good or ill,  
But always loved best her own sweet will.

Couvteons Reader, )  
i Might tn this place attempt to gain thy Favour,  
by declaring that I write Almanacks with no

fays, to fit {pinning in her Shift of Tow, while I  
do nothing bur gaze at the Stars , and has threatned  
more than once to burn all my Books and Rattling-

my Family The Printer has offer’d me fome con-  
fiderable are of the Profits, and I have thus be-  
gun ro comply with my Dame&#x27;s Defire.  
  
Indeed this Motive would have had Force enough  
to have made me publifh an Almanack many Years

for my good Friend and Fellow Student Mr. Titra  
Leeds, whote Intereft I was extreamly unwilling to

tal Sifter has already extended her a Shears,  
and that ingenious Man mutt foon be taken from us.  
He dies, by my Calculation made at his Requett,  
on Of 17. 1733. 3h. 29m. P &amp;. at the very in-  
Gant of the ¢ of Gand § : By his own Calcula-  
tion he will furvive till the 26th of the fame Month.  
This {mall Difference between us we have difputed

‘*Courteous Reader,* I might in this place at-  
tempt to gain thy favour by declaring that I write  
Almanacks with no other view than that of the  
publick good, but in this I should not be sincere ;  
and men are now-a-days too wise to be deceiv&#x27;d  
by pretences, how specious soever. The plain  
truth of the matter is, I am excessive poor, and  
my wife, good woman, is, I tell her, excessive  
proud ; she can not bear, she says, to sit spin-  
ning in her shift of tow, while I do nothing but  
gaze at the stars; and has threatened more than  
once to burn all my books and rattling-traps (as  
she calls my instruments), if I do not make some  
profitable use of them for the good of my family.  
The printer has offer’d me some considerable  
  
share of the profits, and I have thus began to  
comply with my dame’s desire.

** Indeed, this motive would have had force  
enough to have made me publish an Aimanack  
many years since, had it not been overpowered by  
my regard for my good friend and fellow-student,  
Mr. 7%/an Leeds, whose interest I was extreamly  
unwilling to hurt. But this obstacle (I am far from  
speaking it with pleasure) is soon to be removed,  
since inexorable death, who was never known to  
respect merit, has already prepared the mortal dart,  
the fatal sister has already extended her destroy-  
ing shears, and that ingenious man must soon be  
taken from us. He dies, by my calculation, made  
at his request, on Oct. 17, 1733, 3 ho. 29 m., P.M.,  
at the very instant of the 6 of © and %. By his  
own calculation he wil! survive till the 26th of the  
same month. This small difference between us  
we have disputed whenever we have met these  
nine years past ; but at length he is inclinable to  
agree with my judgment. Which of us is most  
exact, a little time will now determine. As, there-  
fore, these Provinces may not longer expect to  
see any of his performances after this year, I  
think myself free to take up my task, and request  
a share of publick encouragement, which I am  
the more apt to hope for on this account, that the  
buyer of my Almanack may consider himself not  
only as purchasing an useful utensil, but as per-  
forming an act of charity to his poor

Ingenious, learned, envy&#x27;d Youth,  
Go on as thou’st began ;  
  
Even thy Enemies take pride  
That thou&#x27;rt their Countryman.

Relation without friendship, friendship

He that lies down with Dogs, shall rise

A fat kitchen, a lean will.  
  
Distrust and caution are the parents of  
Security.  
  
Tongue double, brings trouble.  
  
Take counsel

He that drinks fast, pays slow.  
Great famine when wolves eat wolves.  
A good wife lost, is God&#x27;s gift lost  
  
A taught horse, and a woman to teach,
