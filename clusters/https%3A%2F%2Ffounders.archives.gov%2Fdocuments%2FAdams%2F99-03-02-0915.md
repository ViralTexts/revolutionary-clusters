7. March. 1801  
  
I have promised in this letter to give you some account of the institutions in the province of Silesia, for the education of youth. The university at Breslau, and the academy of nobles at Liegnitz, I need not mention, having noticed them in my letters at the time when we visited those places. Besides these, there are what we call grammar schools, where latin is taught in almost every town in the province, &amp; usually in connection with some church or convent. But the arrangments and regulations of the trivial schools, as they are here called, Schools destined for that elementary instruction, which ought to be diffused over the whole mass of the people particularly deserve your attention, because you may perhaps as a new Englander entertain the prejudice, that your own country is the only spot on earth, where this object is rightly understood, &amp; where the arts of reading &amp; writing are accomplishments almost universally possessed.  
Probably no country in Europe could so strongly contest our superiority in this respect as Germany, &amp; she for this honorable distinction is indebted principally to Frederic the second. To the zeal, with which he pursued the purpose of spreading useful knowledge among all classes of his subjects, &amp; to the influence of his example &amp; of his success, even beyond the limits of his own dominions. To enter upon this topic with the details of which it is susceptible might perhaps not amuse you, &amp; would lead me too far from my subject. I shall therefore confine myself to the measures he adopted, &amp; the system he introduced, in this regard in Silesia.  
At the time of his conquest, education had seldom made an object of the concern of Governments, &amp; Silesia, like the rest of Europe, was but wretchedly provided either with schools, or teachers. In the small towns &amp; villages the schoolmasters were so poorly paid, that they could not subsist without practicing some other trade, besides their occupation as instructors, &amp; they usually united the character of the village school master, that of the village fiddler. Even of these, there were so few, that the children of the peasants in general, throughout the province were left untaught. This was especially the case in Upper Silesia. Frederic issued an ordinance, that a school should be kept in every village, &amp; that a competant subsistance should be provided for the school master, by the joint contribution of the Lord of the village, &amp; of the tenants themselves. The superintendance of the schools was prescribed as the duty of the clergy. But in order, that this ordinance might have its due execution, it was necessary to form the teachers themselves, properly qualified to give useful instruction. This was effected by the persevering intelligence of a man by the name of Felbiger, an Augustine Monk, belonging to a convent at Sagan; a man, says a Silesian historian, whom a great part of Germany must thank for a revolution not less important, though of slower progress, &amp; milder character, than that, which two centuries &amp; a half earlier was accomplished by another monk of the same order—by Luther.  
Felbiger after spending some years at Berlin, to obtain a perfect knowledge of the best method of instruction practised in the schools there, returned to Sagan, &amp; made the convent, to which he belonged, a seminary for young ecclesiastics and candidates as schools masters to acquire the knowledge of the improved mode of teaching. Several other institutions of the same kind were in due time established at Breslau, Glatz, &amp; other places, upon his principles, and conducted by persons, whom he had formed. To defray the expences necessary for the support of these seminaries, a fund is raised consisting of one quarter’s salary, which every catholic curate is obliged to pay upon being first settled in a parsonage.  
With each of these seminaries are connected certain schools, where the young candidates for the clerical, or teaching office, are obliged to attend, &amp; observe the practice of the method, the theory of which they learn at the seminaries themselves. The clergy are required no less than the teachers to go through this process, because the superintendence over the teachers is intrusted to them—No young man can be admitted to either of the offices, without an attestation of his qualities from one of the seminaries.  
After all these preparatory measures had been carried into effect, an ordinance was published in the year 1765, prescribing the mode of teaching as adopted in the seminaries, &amp; the manner, in which the clergy should superinted the efficacious establishment of the system. The regulations of this ordinance prove the earnestness with which the king of Prussia labored to spread the benefits of useful knowledge among all his subjects. The teachers are directed to give plain instruction, &amp; upon objects applicable to the ordinary concerns of life. Not merely to load the memory of the scholars with words, but to make things intelligible to their understanding. To habituate them to the use of their own reason, by explaining every object, so that the children themselves may be able to explain it, upon examination. The candidates for school keeping, must give specimens of their ability, by teaching at one of the schools connected with the seminary, in presence of the professors of the seminary, that they may remark &amp; correct any thing defective in the candidate’s method. If one school suffices for more than one village, neither of them must be more than half a german mile distant from it in the flat country, nor more than a quarter of a mile, in the mountanous parts. The school tax must be paid by the lord &amp; tenants without distinction of religions—In the towns the schools must be kept, the whole year round—It is expected, that one month shall suffice to make a child know the letters of the alphabet—that in two it shall be able to join them, &amp; in three to read—The boys must all be sent to school, from their 6th: to their 13th: year, whether their parents are able to pay the school tax, or not—For the poor, the school money must be raised by collections. Every parent, or guardian, who neglects to send his child, or pupil to school without sufficient cause, is obliged to pay a double school tax, for which the guardian shall have no allowance. Every curate must examine weekly the children of the school in his parish. A general examination must be had annually by the deans, of the districts within their respective precincts, &amp; a report of the condition of the schools, the talents, &amp; attention of the school masters, the state of the buildings, &amp; of attendance by the children, made to the office of the vical general, who must transmit all these reports to the royal domain offices. From these, orders are issued to the respective Land raths, to correct the abuses, &amp; supply the deficiences indicated in the reports. This system was at first prepared only for the Roman catholic schools, but it was afterwards adopted for the most part by the Lutheran consistories. Its truly respectable author Felbiger, was in the sequel, with the consent of Frederic, invited to Vienna by the Empress Maria Theresa, and her son Joseph the Second, who appointed him director of the Normal Schools, or seminaries in all the Austrian dominions. His regulations have introduced &amp; practised upon, in almost all the catholic schools of Germany.  
In Silesia, they had at first, many old prejudices to contend with—The indolence of the catholic clergy was averse to the new troublesome duty imposed on them. Their zeal was alarmed at the danger arising from this dispersion of light, to the stability of their church. They considered alike the spirit of innovation, &amp; the spirit of enquiry as their natural enemies. Besides this, the system still meets resistance from the penurious parcimony, &amp; stubborn love of darkness prevailing in some parts of the province. Many villages neglect the support of their schools; many individuals, upon false pretexts forbear sending their children to school, for the sake of saving the tax. The compulsive measures, and the penalties prescribed by the ordinance are used seldom, and with reluctance. The benevolent design has not been accomplished to the full extent of which it was capable; but as far as it has been accomplished, its operation has been a blessing. That its effects have been very extensive, is not to be doubted, when we compare the number of schools throughout the province in the year 1752, when they amounted only to 1552, with that in the year 1798, when they were more than 3500. The consequences of a more general diffusion of knowledge are attested by many other facts equally clear. Before the seven year’s war, there had scarcely even been more than one periodical journal, or gazettes published in the province at one time. There are now no less than seventeen newspapers, &amp; magazines, that appear by the day, the week, the month, or the quarter many of them upon subjects generally useful, &amp; containing valuable information and instruction for the people. At the former period there were but three booksellers, and these all at Breslau. There are now six in that capital, and seven dispersed about in the cities. The number of printing presses, &amp; of book binders has increased in the same proportion.  
Dr. Johnson in his life of Watts has bestowed a just and exalted encomium upon him for not disdaining to descend from the pride of genius &amp; the dignity of science, to write for the wants &amp; the capacities of children. “Every man, acquainted (says he) with the common principles of human actions, will look up with veneration on the writer, who is at one time combating Locke &amp; at another time making a Catecism for children in their fourth year.”—But how much greater still, is the tribute of admiration irresistably drawn from us, when we behold an absolute monarch, the greatest general of his age, eminent as a writer in the highest departments of literature, descending in a manner to teach the alphabet to the children of his kingdom, bestowing his care, his persevering assiduity, his influence &amp; his power, in diffusing plain and useful knowledge among his subjects, in opening to their minds the first &amp; most important pages of the book of science, in filling the whole atmosphere they breathed with that intellectual fragrance, which had before been imprisoned in the vials of learning, or enclosed within the gardens of wealth. Immortal Frederic! When seated on the throne of Prussia with kneeling millions at thy feet, thou wert only a king. On the fields of Leuthen, of Zorndorf, of Rosback, of so many other scenes of human blood &amp; anguish, thou wert only a hero. Even in thy rare &amp; glorious converse with the Muses and with science, thou wert only a Philosopher, an Historian, a Poet—but in this generous ardor, this active and enlighthened zeal for the education of thy people, thou wert truly Great—the father of thy country—the benefactor of mankind.  
There I shall perhaps close the series of

Berlin, .7th Lerch, 1801.  
  
I have promised in,this letter to give you  
sme account of the institutions in the province  
of Silesia, for the education of youth. ‘The uni-  
versity at Breslau, andthe academy of nobles,  
at Leignitz, I need not mention, having noticed  
them in my letters, at the time when we visited  
those places. Besides these, there are what we  
all grammar schools, where Latin is taught, in  
most every town Of the province, and usually  
in connexion with some church’ or convent.  
but the arrdngements and regulations of the) t77-  
vial schools, as they are here called, schools des-  
ined for that elementary instruction, which  
ought to be diffused over the whole mass.of the  
people, particularly deserve your attention; be-  
quse you may, perhaps, as a New Englander,  
mtertain the prejudice, that your own country  
isthe only spot on earth where’ ‘this‘object is  
tightly managed, and where the arts ‘of reading  
  
und writing .are accomplishments, almost, uni-  
  
versally possessed.  
  
Probadly, no country in Europe could. so  
strongly contest our pre-eminence .in this res-  
rect as Germany, and she, for this honourable  
distinction, is indebted principally to lrederic  
thesecond. To the zeal, with which he pursued  
the purpose Of spreading’ useful knowledge  
among all classes of his subjects; and to the  
influence of his example; and oi ‘hts ‘success,  
even beyond the limits of hiss own dominions.  
To enter upon this topic, with the details of  
which it is susceptible, might perhaps notamuse  
you, and- would lead me too. far, from my sub-  
ject; I shall therefore.confine. myself to the  
measures he adopted, and the system he intro-  
duced, m this regard into Silesia.  
  
At the time of his.conquest, education had  
ldom made an object of the concern of go-  
vernments, and Silesia, like the rest of Europe,  
was but wretchedly provided, either-with schools  
or teachers.  
the schoolmasters were so poorly paid, that they  
tould not subsist without practising some other  
trade, besides their occupation as instructors,  
ind they usually united the character of the vil-  
hge-fdier with that of the village schoolmaster.  
Even of these there were so few, that the chil-  
cren of the peasants in general, throughout the  
frovince;-werecletr ~-“Fhis-was-espe-

In the small towns and villages, ’  
  
perintendance of the $chodis&#x27;was prescribed as  
  
the duty of the clergy. .  
  
But, in order that this ordinance might have  
its due execution, it was necessary to form the  
teachers, theniselves, properly qualified to give  
useful instruction. This was ‘effected by the  
  
_ persevering intelligencejand, zeal of a man, by  
  
the name, of Jedhicer, an Augustine,monk, be-

earlier,/was ‘acconiplishdd by another monk &#x27;of  
the same ‘order—-by Luther. i  
  
Felbiger, after spending some years at Bers  
din, to obtain’a perfect knowledge of the best me-  
thod of instructidn,*practised ‘in the &quot;schools  
there, returned to Sagan, atid ‘made the convent  
to which he belongéd) a Seminary for ‘young éc-  
clesiastics, and candidates ss&#x27;schoolmasters, to  
acquire the knowledge of the improved mode of  
teaching. Several other institutions of the  
same kind were ‘in; duc; time established, at  
Breslau, Glatz, and other places, upon his prin-  
ciples;*and&#x27; contiueted*by persons whom he had  
formed, To defray the expenses necessaryfor  
the support OF these sciuluaries, a fund io  
raised, consisting of,one quarter’s salary, which  
every catholic curate cis obliged to pay, upon  
being first settled in a parsonage.  
  
With each of these seminaries are connected  
certain schools, where the young candidates for  
the clerical or teaching office, are obliged to at-  
tend, and observe the practice of the method,  
  
themselves.

After all these preparatory measures had been  
carried into effect, ani ordinance-was published,  
in the year-1765, présctibing the mode of teach-

ner in which the’clergy should superintend the

been accomplished, its operation has been a bles-  
sing. That its effects have been very extensive  
isnotto be doubted, when we co mpare the nuit  
ber of schools throughout the province, in the  
year 1752, when they amounted only to 1552,  
with that inthe year 1798, whenthey were more  
than 3500. ‘The consequences of a more gene-  
ral diffusion of knowledge are attested by manj  
other facts equally clear. Before the seven  
‘years war, there had scarcely ever been more  
  
than one periodical journal or gazette published  
in the province at one time. ‘There are now no  
less than seventeen newspapers and magazines,  
that appear by the day, the weck, the month, or  
the quarter, many of them upon subjects gener-  
ally useful, and containing valuable information  
and instruction for the people. At the former  
period, there were but three books sellers, and  
these all at Breslau. There are now six inthat  
  
capital, and seven dispersed about in the other  
cities. The number of printing presses and of  
bock-binders has increased in the same propor-  
tion.  
  
Doctor Johnson, in his life of Watts, has bes-  
towed a justand exalted encomium upon Higt  
for not disdaining to descend from the prid de of  
genius and the dignity of science, to write for  
the wants and the capacities of children. ** Every  
mau, acquainted (says he) with the common prin-  
ciples of human actions, will look with vcenera-  
tion on the writer, who is at one time combating  
Locke, and at another tune making a catechism  
for children in their fourth year.” But how  
much greater still is the tribute ofadmiration, ir-  
resistibly drawn from us, when we behold an  
absolute monarch, the greatest general of his  
  
age, eminent as a writer, in the highest depart-  
ments of literature, descending, in a manner, to  
teach the alphabet to the children of his king-  
dom; bestowing his care, his persev ering assi-  
duity, his influence and his power, in diffusing  
p lain ‘and useful knowledge among his subjects ;  
  
in opening to their minds the first and most im-  
portant pages of the book of science, in filling  
the whole atmosphere they breathed, with that  
intellectual fragrance, which had before been im-  
prisoned in the vials of learning, or enclosed  
within the gardens of wealth. Immortal Fre-  
deric! when seated on the throne of Prussia,  
with kneeling millions at thy feet, thou wert on-  
ly aking. On the fields of Leuthen, of Zorn-  
dorf, of Rosbach,  
human blood and anguish, thou wert only a he  
ro. Even in thy rare and glorious converse  
with the Muses and with science, thou wert  
only a philosopher, an historian, a poet; but in  
this generous ardour, this active and enlightened  
zeal for the education of thy people, thou  
wert truly great—the father of thy country—  
the benefactor of mankind.

‘ Besides the university at Breslau, and the Academy of Nobles at  
Liegnitz, there are what we call Grammar-Schools, where Latin is  
taught in almost every town of the province, and usually in connexion  
with some church or convent. But the arrangements and regulations of  
the trivial schools, as they are here called,schools destined for that ele-  
mentary instruction which ought to be diffused over the whole mass of  
the people, particularly deserve your attention; because you may per-  
haps, as a native of New-England, entertain the prejudice, that your own  
country is the only spot on earth where this object is rightly managed,  
and where the arts of reading and writing are accomplighments almost  
universally possessed.  
  
‘ Probably, no country in Europe could so strongly contest our pre-  
eminence in this respect as Germany ; and she, for this honourable di-  
stinction is indebted principally to Frederick II. to the zeal with which  
he pursued the purpose of spreading useful knowledge among all classes  
of his subjects; and to the influence of his example, and of his success,  
even beyond the limits of his own dominions. To enter upon this topic,  
with the details of which it is susceptible, might perhaps not amuse  
you, and would lead me too far from my subject; I shall, therefore,  
confine myself to the measures he adopted, and the system he introdu-  
ced, in this particular, into Silesia.  
  
‘At the time of his conquest, education had seldom been made an ob-  
ject ofthe concern of governments ; and Silesia, like the rest of Europe,  
was but wretchedly provided either with schools orteachers. In the  
small towns and villages, the schoolmasters were so poorly paid, that  
they could not subsist without practising some other trade besides their  
occupation as instructors ; and they usually united the character of the  
village-fiddier with that of the village-schoolmaster. Even of these  
there were so few, that the children of the peasants in general through-  
out the province,were left untaught. This was especially the case in  
Upper Silesia. Frederick issued an ordinance, that a school should be  
kept in every village, and that a competent subsistence should be pro-  
vided for the schoolmaster, by the joint contribution of the lord of the  
village and of the tenants themselves. &#x27;The superintendance of the schools  
was prescribed as the duty of the clergy.  
  
‘ But, in order that this ordinance might have its due execution, it  
was necessary to form the teachers themselves, properly qualified to  
give useful instruction, This was effected by the persevexing intelli-  
gence and zeal of a man, by the name of Felbiger, an Augustine monk,  
belonging to a convent at Sagan ;a man, says a Silesian historian, whom  
a great partof Germany must thank for a revolution, not less important,  
though of slower progress and milder character, than that which, two  
  
centuries and a half earlier, was accomplished by another monk of the  
same order—by Luther.

‘ Felbiger, after spending some years at Berlin, to obtain a perfect  
knowledge of the best methed of instruction practised in the schools  
there, returned to Sagan, and made theconvent to which he belonged  
aseminary for young ecclesiastics, and candidates as schoolmasters, to  
acquire the knowledge of the improved mode of teaching. Several  
other institutions of the same kind were, in due time, established at  
Breslau, Glatz, and other places, upon his principles, and conducted  
by persons whom he had formed. To defray the expences necessary  
for the support of these seminaries, a fund is raised, consisting of one  
quarter’s salary, which every Catholic curate is obliged to pay upon being  
first settled in a parsonage.  
  
¢ With each of these seminaries are connected certain schools, where  
the young candidates for the clerical or teaching office are obliged to  
attend, and observe the practice of the method, the theory of which  
they learn at the seminaries themselves. The clergy are required, no  
less than the teachers, to go through this process; because the super-  
intendance over the teachers is entrusted to them. No young man can  
be admitted to either of the offices, without an attestation of his quali-  
fications from one of the seminaries.  
  
¢ After all these preparatory measures had been carried into effect,  
an ordinance was published in the year 1765, prescribing the mode of  
teaching, as adopted in the seminaries, and the manner in which the  
clergy should superintend the efficacious establishment of the system.  
‘The regulations ofthis ordinance prove the earnestness with which the  
King of Prussia laboured to spread the benefits of useful knowledge a-  
mong his subjects. The teachers are directed to give plain instruction,  
and upon objects applicable to the ordinary concerns of life : not mere-  
ly to load the memory of their scholars with words, but to make things  
intelligible to their understanding ; to habituate them to the use of their  
own reason, by explaining every object of the lesson, so that the child-  
ren themselves may be able to explainit, upon examination. The can-  
didates for school-keeping must give specimens of their ability, by teach-  
ing at one of the schools connected with the seminary, in the presence  
of the professors at the seminary, that they may remark and correct any  
thing defective in the candidate’s method. If one school suffices for  
more than one village, neither of them must be more than half a Ger-  
man mile distant from it, in the flat country ; nor more than a quarter  
of a mile in the mountainous parts. The school-tax must be paid by  
the lord and tenants, without distinction of religions. In the towns,  
the school must be kept the whole year round. It is expected that one  
month shall suffice to make a child know the letters of the alphabet ;  
that in two it shall be able to join them; and in three, toread. The  
boys must all be sent to school, from their sixth to their thirteenth year,  
whether the parents are able to pay the school-tax or not. For the  
poor, the school-money must be raised by collections. Every parent  
or guardian who neglects to send his child or pupil to school, without  
sufficient cause, is obliged to pay a double school-tax, for which the

their respective precincts ; and a report of the condition of the schools,  
the talents and attention of the schoolmasters, the state of the buildings,  
and of attendance by the children, made to the office of the vicar-gene-  
ral, who must transmit all these reports to the royal domain offices.  
From these, orders are issued to the respective landraths, to correct the  
abuses, and supply the deficiencies indicated in the reports. This sys-  
tem was at first prepared only for the Catholic schools ; but it was af-  
terwards adopted, for the most part, by most of the Lutheran consisto-  
ries. Its truly respectable author, Felbiger, was, in the sequel, with

accomplished to the full extent of which it was susceptible ; but, as fat  
as it has been accomplished, its operation has been a blessing. That its  
effects have been very extensive, is not to be doubted, when we com-«  
pare the number of schools throughout the province, in the year 1752,  
when they amounted only to one thousand five hundred and fifty-two,  
with that in the year 1798, when they were more than three thousand:  
five hundred. ‘The consequences of a more general diffusion of know-  
ledge are attested by many other facts equally clear. Before the Seven-

been accomplifhed to the full extent of which it was fufceptible; but,  
asfar as it has been accomplifhed, its operation has been a bleffing.  
That its effe€ts have been very extenfive, is not to be doubted, when  
we compare the number of f{chools throughout the province, in the  
year 1752, when they amopnted only to one thoufand five hundred  
and fifty-two, with that in the year 1798, when they were more than  
three thoufand five hundred. ‘The confequences of a more general  
difufion of knowledge are artefted by many other fa¢ts equally clear.  
Betore the feven years war, there had fcarcely ever been more than one  
iodical journal or gazette publifhed in the province at one time.  
te are now no Iefs than feventeen newfpapers and magazines,  
which appear by the day, the week, the month, or the quarter, many  
of them upon fubjeéts generally ufeful, and containing valuable infor-  
mation and inftruction for the people. At the former period there  
were but three bookfellers, and all thefe at Breflau. There are now  
fix in that capital, and feven difperfed about in the other cities. The  
number of printing-preffes and of book-binders has increafed in the  
faine proportion,” P, 366, .

oil Silesia written during a &#x27;our through that  
country, in the year 1800, 1801, an interesting  
account of the state of education in part of the  
Prussian Dominions.—Kilt.  
* Ilesides thp university at Dreslau, and the  
Academy of Nobles at l.iegnitz, there are what  
wee II Grammar-Schools, where Latin is taught  
in almost every town of the province, and usu­  
ally in connexion with some church or convent. 1  
Hut the arrange ments and regulations of the tri- I  
vial schools, as they are here called, schools des­  
tined for &#x27;hat elementary instruction which ought  
to he diffused over the whole mass of the peopt &gt;,  
particularly deserve your attention ; bee use you  
May perhaps, as a native of New-Kngland, enter­  
tain the prejudice, that your own country is the  
only spot on earth where this object is rightly  
managed, and where the arts of reading ami writ­  
ing are accomplishments almost universally pos­  
sessed.  
  
• Probably, no country in Europe could so |  
strongly contest our pre-eminence in this respect  
as German)-; and she, for this honorable distinct!  
on is indebted principally to Frederick II. to the  
.zeal will! which he pursued die purposeof spread­  
ing useful knowledge among all classes of his  
subjects; anil to the influence of his example, and  
of his success, even beyond the limits of his own  
dominions. To enter upon this topic, with the  
details of which it is susceptible, might perhaps  
not amuse you, and would iead me too far from  
my subject ; I shall, therefore, confine myself to  
the measures lie adopted, and the system he in­  
troduced, in this particular, into Silesia.  
‘ At the time of his conquest, education had  
seldom been made the object of the concern of  
governments ; And Selrsia, like the rest of Eu­  
rope, was but wretchedly provided with schools  
or teachers, lu the small towns anil villages, the  
schoohn sters were so poorf pai l,-hat they could  
not -ubsist without practising some otliei trade  
besides their occupation as instructors; and they  
usually united the character of the village fidler  
with that of the village schoolmaster. Even of  
these, there were so few, that the children of the  
peasaivs, m general, throughout the province,  
were left untaught. This was especially the case  
in Upper Silesia. Frederick issued an ordinance  
diat a school should be kept in every village, and  
tiiat i competent subsistence should be provided  
for the schoolmaster, by the joint contribution  
of the lord of the village and the tenants them­  
selves. The superiniendance of the schools was  
prescribed as die duty of the clergy,  
j ‘ Hut, in order that this ordinance might have  
its due execution, it was necessary to form the  
(teachers themselves, properly qualified to give  
useful instruct ion. This was eff ected by the per  
severing intelligence and zeal of a man, by the  
name of Felbiger, an Augustine monk, belonging  
to a convent at Sagan ; a man, says a Silesian  
historian, whom great part of Germany must  
thank fora revolution,not less important, though  
of slower progress and ni lder character, than that  
which two centuries and a half earlier, was ac­  
complished by another monk of die same order—  
by Luilier.  
* Felbiger, after spending some years at Berlin,  
to obtain a perfect knowledge of die best method  
of instruction practised in the schools there, re­  
turned to Sagan, and made the convent to which  
lie belonged a seminary for young ecclesiastics,  
and candidates as schoolmasters, to acquire the  
knowledge of the unproved mode of cacli.ng.—  
Several other institutions of the same kind were,  
in due tune, e» abiishe 1 at Breslau, Glatz, and o­  
ther places, upon Ins principles, and conducted  
by persons \i horn lie had formed To fief ay the  
expences necessary for the support of these se­  
minaries, a hind is raised, consisting of one quar­  
ter’s salary, winch every Catholic curate is oblig­  
ed to pay upon being firs set led in a parsonage.  
“ With each of these s- mi lanes are connec ed  
certain schools, where )oung candidates for the  
cler.cal or teaching office are obliged to attend,  
and observe thepmct.ee of the method, the the­  
ory of which they learn at the seminaries them  
selves. The clergy are required, no less than the  
seacliers, to go through dns process ; because the  
luperintendunce over tiie teachers is entrusted  
to them. No young man can he admitted to ei­  
ther of the offices, without an attestation of his  
qualifications from one of the sein.naries.  
‘ After all these preparatory measures had  
been carried into eff ect, an ordinance wa^ pub­  
lished in the year 1795, prescribing the mode of  
teaching, as adopted in the seminaries, and the  
manner in which the clergy should superintend  
the efficacious establishment of the system. The  
regulations of this ordinance prove the earnest­  
ness with which the King of Prussia laboured to  
spread the benefits of useful knowledge among  
lus subjects. The teachers are directed to give  
plain instruction, and upon objects applicable to  
the ordinary concerns of life; not merely to load  
the memory of their scholars with words, but to  
make tilings ntelligihle to their understanding ;  
to liabiiua&#x27;.e them to the use of their own reason  
by explaining every object of tbe lesson, so that  
the children themselves may be able to explain  
it, upon examma ion. The candidates for school­  
keep.ng must give specime sof the r ability, by  
teaching at one of the schools connected with  
the seminary, in the presence of the professors at  
the seminary, that they may remark and correct  
  
all} uniif, in me uunumuie » IIK&#x27;lllOll  
If one school suffices for more than one village,  
neither of them must be more than half a Qer|  
man mdc distant from it, in the Hat country ; nor  
more than a quarter of a mile in the mountainous  
parts. These tool tax must be paid by the lord  
and tenants, without distinction of religions._  
In the towns, the school must be kept the whole  
year round. It is expected that one month shall  
suffice to make a child know the letters of the  
alphabet; that in two it shall be able to join  
them { and in three, to read. The boys must  
all be sent to school, from their sixth to their  
thirteenth year, whether the parents are able to  
pay the school tax or not. For the poor, the  
school-money must he raised by collections. Eve­  
ry parent or guardian who neglects to send hie  
child or pupil to school, without sufficient cause  
is obliged to pay a double school tax, for winch the  
guardians shall have no allowance. Every (Ju­  
rate must examine, weekly, the children of the  
school in his parish. A general examination  
must be held annually, by the deans of the dis­  
tricts, of the schools within then-respective pre­  
cincts; and a report i.fthe cond (ion of the :cho a  
the talents and attention of the schoolmasters  
the state of the buildings, &amp; of a etndance by the  
children, made to the office of the Vicar general  
who must transmit all these reports to the royal  
domain offices. From these, orders are issued  
to the respective landraths, to correct the abus­  
es, and supply tt e deficiencies indicated in the  
\ ■ &#x27;  
  
reports. This system w.-** at first only prepared  
for the Catholic schools ; but it was afterwi-ds  
ulopted, f..r the most part.by most of the Lu he­  
• ui c &lt;ns-stories. Its truly respectable authir,  
FelHiger, was, in the sequel with tbe consent of  
Frederick invited to Vienna by the Empress Ma­  
ri t Then sa and he.- son Joseph It, who appo til­  
ed him director of the normal sch ols or semin­  
aries in all the Austrian dominions. Histvgula*  
I turns have hern introduce., and are ac cd noon,  
in almost a&#x27;l the Catholic countries in Germany.  
* In Silesia, t ey itad :-.t first nuny old prejudi­  
ces to contend with. The indolcnc* of the Ca­  
tholic clergy was averse to the new and trouble­  
some duty imposed upon them. Their zeal was  
alarmed at the danger arising from this disper­  
sion of light to the stability of their church.—  
They considered alike the spirit of innovation,  
and the spirit of enquiry as their natt.rul enemies.  
Besides this, the system still meets resistance  
from &#x27;he |&gt;cnur.ou« parsunony an&lt;lstubborn love  
of darkness, prevailing in some pari of the pro­  
vince. .Many villagers neglect the support of  
their schools; many ind v.duals from false pre­  
text, forbear sending their children to school,  
for the sake of saving the tax The compulsive  
measures, and the penalties, prescribed by the  
ordinance, are used seldom and with reluctance.  
The benevolent design lias not been ccomplishe.l  
to the full extent of wh&gt;ch it was susceptible ;—  
hut, as far as it beenaccompl.sli d, its opera u&gt;ti  
has been a blessing. That its ellccts have been  
very extensive, is not to be doubted, w hen we  
compare the nunioer of schools through-out the  
province, m the year 1752. when tliev amounted  
only to one thousand five hundred and fifty.two,  
with that in the year 1798, when they were more  
than three thousand live hundred. The conse­  
quences of a more general diffusion of knowledge  
are a&lt; tested by many other facts equally clear.  
Before the seven-years war, there lud scarcely  
ever been more than one periodical journal or  
gazette published in the province at one time.—  
There are,now no less than seventeen newspa­  
pers and magazines, which appeir by the day,  
the week, the month, or the quarter, many of  
them upon subjects generally useful, and contain­  
ing valuable information and instruction for tuc  
peopie. At a former period there were but  
three booksellers, and all these at Breslau._  
There aretiow six in that capital, anil seven dis­  
persed aboii in the other c.l.es The number

education within the reach of all classes of his subjects. The  
late President of the United States, John Quincy Adams, has, in  
his Letters on Silesia, given a very full and interesting account of  
the Seminaries which Frederick caused to be established in every  
village of Silesia, and which have since been copied in other states,  
in consequence of the experience of their good effects. We are sure  
we shall gratify our readers by laying before them a few extracts  
from Mr Adams’s valuable and interesting work.  
  
‘ At the time of the conquest of Silesia, education had seldom  
been made an object of the concern of governments ; and Silesia,  
like the rest of Europe, was but wretchedly provided either with  
schools or teachers. In the small towns and villages, the school-  
masters were so poorly paid, that they could not subsist without  
practising some other trade besides their occupation as instruc-  
ters; and they usually united the character of the village fiddler  
with that of the village schoolmaster. Even of these, there were  
so few, that the children of the peasants in general, throughout  
the province, were left untaught. This was especially the case  
in Upper Silesia. Frederick issued an ordinance, that a school  
should be kept in every village, and that a competent subsistence  
should be provided for the schoolmaster, by the joint contribution  
of the lord of the village and of the tenants. The superinten-  
dence of the schools was prescribed as the duty of the clergy.  
  
‘Frederick derived important aid in the prosecution of this  
meritorious plan, from Felbiger, an Augustine monk, who travel-  
led to different countries to obtain an acquaintance with the best  
modes of teaching, and under whose superintendence, pattern  
schools were established at Breslau, Glatz, and other places,  
which all the candidates for the situation of schoolmaster are  
obliged to attend.  
  
‘ After all these preparatory measures had been carried into  
effect, an ordinance was published in the year 1765, prescribing  
the mode of teaching as adopted in the seminaries, and the man-  
ner in which the clergy should superintend the efficacious estab-  
lishment of the system. The regulations of this ordinance prove  
the earnestness with which the King of Prussia laboured to spread  
the benefits of useful knowledge among his subjects. The teach-  
ers are directed to give plain instruction, and upon subjects  
applicable to the ordinary concerns of life ; not merely to load the  
memory of their scholars with words, but to make things intelli-  
gible to their understanding, and to habituate them to the use of  
their own reason, by explaining every object of the lesson, so that  
the children themselves may be able to explain it, upon examina-  
tion. ‘The candidates for school-keeping must give specimens of  
their ability, by teaching at one of the schools connected with the

seminary, in presence of the professors, that they may remark  
and correct any thing defective in the candidate’s method.  
  
The school tax must be paid by the lord and tenants, without  
distinction of religions. The boys must all be sent to school  
from their sixth to their thirteenth year, whether the parents are  
a able to pay the school tax or not. For the poor, the school money  
i must be raised by collections. Every parent or guardian who  
neglects to send his child or pupil to school, without sufficient  
cause, is obliged to pay a double tax, for which the guardians shall  
have no allowance. Every curate must examine, weekly, the  
children of the school in his parish. A general examination must  
be held annually by the deans of the districts of the schools  
within their respective precincts; and a report of the condition  
of the schools, the talents and attention of the schoolmasters, the  
8 state of the buildings, and the attendance of the children made  
¥. to the office of Vicar General, who is bound to transmit all these  
Q reports to the royal domain offices, from which orders are issued  
to supply the deficiencies in the schools. This system was at  
first prepared only for the Catholic schools; but it was afterwards  
adopted by most of the Lutheran consistories.  
  
The system had at first many difficulties to contend with. The  
indolence of the Catholic clergy was averse to the new and  
troublesome duty imposed upon them. Their zeal was alarmed  
at the danger arising from this diffusion of light to the stability  
of their church; they considered alike the spirit of innovation,  
and the spirit of inquiry as their natural enemies. But the firm-  
ness of the government overcame every obstacle. There ar

Berit, March Tth, 1801.  
  
I nave promised in this letter to give you some account of the institu-  
tions in the province of Silesia for the education of youth. The university  
at Breslau and the academy of nobles at Liegnitz I need not mention,  
having noticed them in my letters at the time when we visited those  
places. Besides these, there are what we call grammar schools, where  
Latin is taught in almost every town of the province, and usually  
in connection with some church or convent. But the arrangements and  
regulations of the trivial schools, as they are here called—schodls des-  
tined for that elementary instruction which ought to be diffused over the  
whole mass of the people—particularly deserve your attention, because  
you may, perhaps, as a native of New England, entertain the prejudice,  
that your own country is the only spot on earth where this object is  
rightly managed, and where the arts of reading and writing are accom-  
plishments almost universally possessed.  
  
Probably no country in Europe could so strongly contest our pre-  
éminence in this respect as Germany, and she, for this honorable dis-  
tinction, is indebted principally to Frederick II.; to the zeal with which  
he pursued the purpose of spreading useful knowledge among all classes  
ofthis subjects, and to the influence of his example and of his success  
even beyond the limits of his own dominions. To enter upon this topic,  
with the details of which it is susceptible, might, perhaps, not amuse  
you, and would lead me too far from my subject, I shall, therefore, con-  
fine myself to the measures he adopted and the system he introduced in  
this particular into Silesia.  
  
At the time of his conquest education had seldom been made an object -  
of the concern of governments, and Silesia, like the rest of Europe, was  
but wretchedly provided either with schools or teachers. In the small  
towns and villages the schoolmasters were so poorly paid, that they

could not subsist without practicing some other trade besides their occu-  
pation as instructors, and they usually united the character of the village  
fiddler with that of the village schoolmaster. Even of these there were  
80 few, that the children of the peasants in general, throughout the  
province, were left untaught. This was epecially the case in Upper Si-  
lesia. Frederick issued an ordinance, that a school should be kept in  
every village, and that a competent subsistence should be provided for  
the schoolmaster, by the joint contribution of the lord of the village and  
of the tenants themselves. The superintendence of the schools was pre-  
scribed as the duty of the clergy.  
  
But in order that this ordinance might have its due execution, it was  
necessary to form the teachers themselves properly qualified to give use-  
ful instruction. This was effected by the persevering intelligence and  
zeal of a man by the name of Felbiger, an Augustine monk, belonging to  
a convent at Sagan; a man, says a Silesian historian, whom a great part  
of Germany must thank for a revolution, not less important, though of  
slower progress and milder character, than that which, two centuries and  
a half earlier, was accomplished by another monk of the same order—  
by Luther.  
  
Felbiger, after spending some years at Berlin to obtain a perfect  
knowledge of the best method of instruction practiced in the schools  
there, returned to Sagan, and made the convent to which he belonged a  
seminary for young ecclesiastics and candidates as schoolmasters to ac-  
quire the knowledge of the improved mode of teaching. Several other  
institutions of the same kind were, in due time, established at Breslau,  
Glatz, and other places, upon his principles, and conducted by persons  
whom he had formed. To defray the expenses necessary for the support  
of these seminaries, a fund is raised, consisting of one quarter’s salary,  
which every Catholic curate is obliged to pay upon being first settled in  
a@ parsonage.  
  
With each of these seminaries are connected certain schools, where  
the young candidates for the clerical or teaching office are obliged to at-  
tend and observe the practice of the method, the theory of which they  
learn at the seminaries themselves. The clergy are required, no less  
than the teachers, to go through this process, because the superintend-  
ence over the teachers is intrusted to them. No young man can be ad-  
mitted to either of the offices without an attestation of his qualification  
  
from one of the seminaries.  
  
“After all these preparatory measures had been carried into effect, an  
ordinance was published in the year 1765 prescribing the mode of teach-  
ing as adopted in the seminaries, and the manner in which the clergy  
should superintend the efficacious establishment of the system. The  
regulations of this ordinance prove the earnestness with which the king  
of Prussia labored to spread the benefits of useful knowledge among his  
subjects. The teachers are directed to give plain instruction, and upon  
objects applicable to the ordinary concerns of life; not merely to load

the memory of their scholars with words, but to make things intelligible  
to their understanding; to habituate them to the use of their own reason,  
by explaining every object of the lesson so that the children themselves  
may be able to explain it upon examination. The candidates for school-  
keeping must give specimens of their ability, by teaching at one of the  
schools connected with the seminary, in the presehce of the professors at  
the seminary, that they may remark and correct any thing defective in  
the candidate’s method. If one school suffices for more than one village,  
neither of them must be more than halfa German mile distant from it  
in the flat country, nor more than a quarter of a mile in the mountain-  
ous parts. The school tax must be paid by the lord and tenants without  
distinction of religions. In the towns the school must be kept the whole  
year round. It is expected that one month shall suffice to make a child  
know the letters of the alphabet ; that in two it shall be able to join them;  
and in three to read. The boys must all be sent to school, from their  
sixth to their thirteenth year, whether the parents are able to pay the  
school tax or not. For the poor, the school money must be raised by  
collections. Every parent or guardian who neglects to send his child or  
pupil to school, without sufficient cause, is obliged to pay a double  
school tax, for which the guardians shall have no allowance. Every cu-  
rate must examine weekly the children of the school.in his parish. A  
general examination must be held annually, by the deans of the districts,  
of the schools within their respective precincts; and a report of the con-  
dition of the schools, the talents and attention of the schoolmasters, the  
state of the buildings, and of attendance by the children, made to the  
office of the vicar-general, who must transmit all these reports to the  
royal domain offices. From these, orders are issued to the respective  
landraths to correct the abuses and supply the deficiencies indicated in  
the reports. This system was at first prepared only for the Catholic  
schools; but it was afterwards adopted, for the most part, by must of  
the Lutheran consistories. Its truly respectable author, Felbiger, was,  
in the sequel, with the consent of Frederick, invited to Vienna by the  
Empress Maria Theresa, and her son Joseph II., who appointed him  
director of the normal schools or seminaries in all the Austrian domin-  
ions, His regulations have been introduced and are acted upon in almost  
all the Catholic countries of Germany.  
  
In Silesia they had at first many old prejudices to contend with. The  
indolence of the Catholic clergy was averse to the new and troublesome  
duty imposed on them. Their zeal was alarmed at the danger arising  
from this dispersion of light to the stability of their church. They con-  
sidered alike the spirit of innovation and the spirit of inquiry as their  
natural enemies. Besides this, the system still meets resistance from the  
penurious parsimony and stubborn love of darkness prevailing in some  
parts of the province. Many villages neglect the support of their schools;  
many individuals, upon false pretexts, forbear sending their children to  
school for the sake of saving the tax. The compulsive measures and the

penalties prescribed by the ordinance are used seldom and with reluc-  
tance. The benevolent design has not been accomplished to the full  
extent of which it was susceptible; but as far as it has been accom-  
plished its operation has been a blessing. That its effects have been  
very extensive is not to be doubted, when we compare the number of  
schools throughout the province in the year 1752 when they amounted  
only to one thousand five hundred and fifty-two, with that in the year  
1798 when they were more than three thousand five hundred. The  
consequences of a more general diffusion of knowledge are attested by  
many other facts equally clear. Before the seven years’ war, there had  
scarcely ever been more than one periodical journal or gazette published  
in the province at one time. There are now no less than seventeen news-  
papers and magazines which appear by the day, the week, the month, or  
the quarter, many of them upon subjects generally useful, and containing  
valuable information and instruction for the people. At the former pe-  
riod there were but three booksellers, and all these at Breslau. There  
are now six in that capital, and seven dispersed about in the other cities.  
The number of printing-presses and of bookbinders has. increased in the  
same proportion.  
Dr. Johnson, in his Life of Watts, has bestowed a just and exalted en-  
comium upon him for not disdaining to descend from the pride of genius  
‘and the dignity of science to write for the wants and the capacities of  
children. ‘Every man acquainted,” says he, “‘ with the common princi-  
ples of human actions, will look with veneration on the writer, who is at  
one time combating Locke, and at another time making a catechism for  
children in their fourth year.” But how much greater still is the tribute  
of admiration irresistibly drawn from us, when we behold an absolute  
monarch, the greatest general of his age, eminent as a writer in the high-  
est departments of literature, descending, in a manner, to teach the  
alphabet to the children of his kingdom; bestowing his care, his perse-  
vering assiduity, his influence and his power, in diffusing plain and use-  
ful knowledge among his subjects; in opening to their minds the first .  
and most important pages of the book of science; in filling the whole  
atmosphere they breathed with that intellectual fragrance which had  
before been imprisoned in the vials of learning, or inclosed within the  
gardens of wealth! Immortal Frederick! when seated on the throne of  
Prussia, with kneeling millions at thy feet, thou wast only a king. On  
the fields of Leuthen, of Zorndorf, of Rosbach, of so many other scenes  
of human blood and anguish, thou wast only a hero. Even in thy rare  
and glorious converse with the muses and with science, thou wast only a  
philosopher, an historian, a poet; but in this generous ardor, this active  
and enlightened zeal for the education of thy people, thou wast truly  
great—the father of thy country—the benefactor of mankind.  
Yours, &amp;.
