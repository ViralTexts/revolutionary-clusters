privilege and of civil and religious des­  
  
potlsm. On the other hand, many of the  
republicans turned pale when the tidings  
reached them that William J. Bryan was  
president of the United States. Both the  
pulpit and the press had taught them  
that he was the incarnation of all evil—  
an infidel, an atheist, a scoffer at all  
things sacred; a leveler, a revolutionist,  
an advocate of mob government. The  
political principles of Mr. Bryan now  
swept the country and Mr. Bryan sway­  
ed an Influence which was never exceed­  
ed by Washington. Mr. Bryan’s retiring  
words were as follows:  
Nature Intended me for the tranquil  
pursuits of science by rendering them my  
supreme delight, but the enormities of  
the times in which I have lived have  
forced me to take a part In resisting them  
and to commit myself on the boisterous  
ocean of political passions. I thank God  
for the opportunity of retiring, then,  
without censure, and carrying with me  
the most consoling proofs of public ap­  
probation.”
