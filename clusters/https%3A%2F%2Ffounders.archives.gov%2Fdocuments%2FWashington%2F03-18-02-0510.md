How far the latter is the case does not become me to pronounce but as their can be no harm in a pious wish for the good of ones Country I shall offer it as mine that each State wd not only choose, but absolutely compel their ablest Men to attend Congress—that they would instruct them to go into a thorough investigation of the causes that have produced so many disagreeable effects in the Army &amp; Country—in a word that public abuses should be corrected—&amp; an entire reformation worked without these it does not, in my Judgment, require the spirit of divination to foretell the consequences of the present Administration, nor to how little purpose the States, individually, are framing constitutions—providing laws—and filling Offices with the abilities of their ablest men.

e I shall soon return.  
I have seen nothing since I came here (on the 22d Instt) to change my opinion of Men or meas[u]r[e]s but abundant reason to be convinced, that our Affairs are in a more distressed, ruinous—&amp; deplorable condition than they have been in Since the commencement of the War—By a faithful labourer then in the cause. By a Man who is daily injuring his private Estate without even the smallest earthly advantage not common to all, in case of a favourable Issue to the dispute—By one who wishes the prosperity of America most devoutly and sees or thinks he sees it, on the brink of ruin, you are beseeched most earnestly my dear Colo. Harrison to exert yourself in endeavouring to rescue your Country by (let me add) sending your ablest &amp; best Men to Congress—these characters must not slumber, nor sleep at home, in such times of pressing danger—they must not content themselves in the enjoyment of places of honor or profit in their own Country while the common interests of America are mouldering &amp; sinking into irretrievable (if a remedy is not soon applied) ruin, in which theirs also must ultimately be involved. If I was to be called upon to draw A picture of the times—&amp; of Men—from what I have Seen, heard, &amp; in part know I should in one word say that idleness,    
  
  
  
dissipation &amp; extravigance seems to have laid fast hold of most of them. That speculation—peculation—&amp; an insatiable thirst for rishes seems to have got the better of every other consideration and almost of every order of Men. That party disputes &amp; personal quarrels are the great business of the day whilst the momentous concerns of an empire—a great &amp; accumulated debt—ruined finances—depreciated money—&amp; want of credit (which in their consequences is the want of every thing) are but secondary considerations &amp; postponed from day to day—from week to week as if our affairs wore the most promising aspect—after drawing this picture, which from my Soul I beleive to be a true one I need not repeat to you that I am alarmed and wish to see my Country men roused. I have no resentments, nor do I mean to point at any particular characters, this I can declare upon my honor for I have every attention paid me by Congress that I can possibly expect &amp; have reason to think that I stand well in their estimation but in the present situation of things I cannot help asking—Where is Mason—Wythe—Jefferson[—]Nicholas—Pendleton—Nelson—&amp; another I could name—&amp; why, if you are sufficiently impressed with your danger, do you not (as New Yk has done in the case of Mr Jay) send an extra Member or two for at least a certain limited time till the great business of the Nation is put upon a more respectable &amp; happy establishmt. Your Money is now sinking 5 pr Ct a day in this City and I shall not be surprized if in the course of a few months a total stop is put to the currency of it. And yet an assembly—a Concert—a Dinner, or Supper (that will cost three or four hundred pounds) will not only take Men off from acting in but even from thinking of this business while a great part of the Officers of yr army from absolute necessity are quitting the Service and the more virtuous few rather than do this are sinking by sure degrees into beggery &amp; want. I again repeat to you that this is not an exagerated acct—that it is an alarming one I do not deny, &amp; confess to you that I feel more real distress on acct of the pres[en]t appearances of things than I have done at any one time since the commencem&lt;ent&gt; of the dispute—but it is time to bid you, once more adieu. Providence has heretofore taken us up when all other means &amp; hope seemed to be departing from us in this I will confide. Yrs &amp;ca

very period the affairs of the United States were  
in the most distressed, ruinous, and deplorable  
condition. Idleness, dissipation, and extrava-  
gance, seemed to have laid fast hold of the  
generality; and peculation, speculation, and an  
insatiable thirst for riches, to have gotten the  
better of every other consideration, and almost  
of every order of men. Party disputes and per-

day, while the momentous concerns of the Em-

Father of his country, “it is not a sufficient cause for general lamentation, my  
misconception of the matter, impresses it too strongly upon me, that the States,  
separately, are too much engaged in their local concerns, and have ‘too many of their  
ablest men withdrawn from the general council, for the good of the common weal. In

attention, on the part of the States to the interests of the general cause, he adds:—  
«“ Without this, it does not in my judgment require the spirit of divination to fore-  
tell the consequences of the present administration; nor to how little purpose the

The Next Congress.  
In 1778, when our first great struggle for indepen­  
dence was at its height, Washington addressed a letter  
to Benjamin Harrison, of Virginis, in which he gave the  
following impressive counsel: &quot;As there can be no  
at hari in o nens wish for the good of one&#x27;s countey I  
  
&quot;shall offer it as mine that each State would not only  
&quot;choose but absolutely compel their ablest men to at­

To LnLin Morr oNes  
Dean SiR: I have seen nothing since I  
came here, on th $24 inst, to change my  
opinion of mer or measures, but abundant.  
reasons to be coarinsed, that our affairs are  
in a more distreege, rdinous, and deplors­  
ble condition than they have been since the  
commencement of the war. By a faithful  
laborer in the rause; by a man who is daily  
expending his private estate, nnot even  
the smallest ecridvantages not commo­  
to ull in case of arable isue to the dis  
pute, by one shs wishes the prosperity of  
America most derowsly, but sees it, or thinks  
he sees it, on the lrink of ruln, you are be­  
sought most caruestly, my dear Col Hare­  
son, to exert yourself in endeavoring to res­  
cue your country by sending your best and  
ablest men t3 Congress. These characters  
must not slumber nor sleep at home in quch  
a time of pressing danger. They must not  
content themselves with the enloyment of  
places of honor or fofit in their own State,  
while the common interests of America are  
miouldering and sinking in irreparable ruins­  
if a remedy is not soon applied, and in which  
these alse must ultimntely be involved.  
If I could be called uipon to draw a mieture  
of the times and of mnchgfrom what Thate  
seen, heard, and in part know, I should, in  
one word, say, that idleness, dissipation and  
extravagance seem to have laid fast hold of  
most of them; that speenlation, peculation, und  
oin insatiable thirst for riches, seem to have got  
the better of every other consideration, and al  
most of every order if mien; that party dis­  
putes and personal quarrels on the great busi  
ness of the day, while the momentous cor­  
cerns of an empire, a great and aecummulat  
ing debt, ruined finanees, depreciated money  
and want of credit, which, in its conse  
quences, is the want of everything, are but  
secondary considerations, and postponed  
from day to day and week to week, as if our  
affairs wore the most promising aspect. A­  
ter orawing the picture, which from my soul  
I believe to be a true ones I need not now re  
peat to you that I amn alarmed, and wish to  
see my countrymen aronsed. I have no re  
sentinents, nor do I mean to point at par­  
ticnlar characters. This I can declare to  
you, upon honor, for I have every attention  
paid to me by Congress that I can poss­  
bly expect, and I have reason to think that  
I stand well in their estimation. But in the  
present situation of things, I cannot help  
asking where are Mason, Wythe, Jefferson,  
Nicholas, Pendleton, Nelson, and another  
I could name? And why, if you are suff­  
ciently impressed with your danger, do you  
not, as New York has doné in the case of  
Mr. Jay, send an extra member or two for at  
least a certain limited time, till the great  
business of the mation is put upon a more  
respectable and happy establishment? Our  
money is now sinking lifty per eent, a day in  
this city, and I shall not be surprised in the  
course of a few months if a total stop is put  
to the currency of it; and yet an assembly, a  
concert, a dinner, or supper that will cost  
three or four hundred pounds will not only  
take men off from acting, but even from  
thinking of it, while a great part of the offf­  
cers of the army, from absolute necessity, are  
quitting the service; and the more virtuous  
few, rather than do this, art sinking by sure  
degrees into beggary and want. I again re­  
peat to you this is not an exaggerated ac­  
count. That it is an alarming one I do not  
deny; and I confess to you that I feel more  
real distress on account of the present ap­  
pearance of things than I have at any one  
time since the commencement of the dis  
pute. But it is time to bid you adieu. Provi  
dence has heretofore taken us up when all  
other means and hopes seemed to be depart  
ing from us.  
I am yours, &amp;c

DeeR SI:-I have seen nothing sirce I  
came here, on the 224 inst., to change my  
ooinion of men or measares, but abundant  
reasons to be convinced that our affairs are in  
a more distressed, rutnous and deplorable con­  
dition than ther have taen since the come  
of the war. By a taithful laberer  
  
in the cause; by a man who is daily extend..  
ing his privase estate, lor not even the small  
t earthly advantages, not common to all in  
case of a favorable issue to the dispute; by  
one who wishes the prosperity of America  
most devoutly, but sees it, or thinks he sees it.  
on the brink of ruin, you are besought most  
earnestly, my dear Col Harrison, to exert  
yourself in endeavoring to rescue your country  
y sending your ablest men to Congress.  
These characters must not slumber nor sleep  
at home in such a time of pressing danger.  
They must not content themselves with the  
enjoyment of places of honer or profit in their  
own State, while the common interests of  
America are smould ring and sinking in ir­  
reparable ruins, if a reniedy is not soon ap  
plied, and in which these also must ultimately  
be involved.  
If I could be called upon to draw a picture  
of the times and of nich, from wha I nave  
seen, heard, and in part known, I should, it  
one word, say, that idleness, dissipatin and  
extravagance seemn to have laid fast held o  
most of them; that speculation and an itsa­  
tiable thirst for riches, seem to have got the  
better part of every other co sideration, and  
almost of every order of men; t at party dis­  
putes and personal quarrels are the great bus  
siness of the day, wulle the moment us con­  
cerns of an empire, a great and accumulating  
debt, and want of credit, which, in its conse­  
quences, is the want of everything, are bur  
sccondary considerations, and postponed frour  
day to day, and from week to week, as if our  
affairs were the most promising aspect. After  
drawing the picture, which, froia my soul, I  
believe to be a true one, I need not now re  
peat to you that I am alarmed, and wish to  
see my couutremen arotsed. I have no re­  
sentments, nor do I wish to point at particu­  
lar characters. This I can declare to you,  
upon honor, for I have every attention paid  
me by Congress that I can possibly expect.  
and I have reasn to think that I stand well  
in their estimation. But, in the present situ­  
ation of things, I cannot help asking where  
are Mason, Wy the, Jefferson, Nicholas, Pen­  
dleton, Nelson, and another I could name  
And why, if you are sufficiently impressed  
with danger, do you not, as New York nas  
done in the case of Mr. Jay, send an extra  
member or two for at le st a certain limited  
time, till the great business of the nation is  
put upon a more respectable and bappy es­  
tablishment? Our money is now sinking  
fitty per cent a aay in this city, and I shall  
not be surprised, in the course of a few  
months, if a total stop is put to the carrency  
of ir; and yet an assembly, a dinter or sup  
er that will cost three or four funred  
pounds, wil not only t ke men ff from acting,  
but even from thinking o&#x27; it, weile a great  
part of the efficers of the army, trom absolite  
necessity, are quisting the service, and the  
more virtuous few, rather than do this, are  
sinking by sure degres-into leggary and want.  
I again repeat to you this is het an exagser  
account. That it is an alarming one, Id­  
net deny, and I confess to you that I feel more  
real distress on account of the present appear­  
ance of things than I have at any time since  
the commencement of the dispute. But it is

ican officers, to order the disposition of the forces,  
and to give his attention to all the suggestions of  
plans for action. He was greatly concerned that  
Congress should be growing weak and _ ineffi-  
cient. Here was a man, whom some had foolishly  
supposed to be aiming at supreme power, only  
  
anxious that the civil government should be  
strengthened. He saw very clearly that while the  
  
separate States were looking after their several  
affairs, the Congress which represented the whole  
country was losing its influence and power. ‘‘I  
think our political system,” he wrote, ‘‘ may be  
  
compared to the mechanism of a clock, and that  
we should derive a lesson from it; for it answers  
no good purpose to keep the smaller wheels in  
order, if the greater one, which is the support and  
prime mover of the whole, is neglected.”  
  
He was indignant at the manner in which Con  
gressmen, and others who were concerned in the  
affairs of the country, spent their time in Phila-  
delphia. ‘‘ An assembly,” he said, ‘‘a concert, a  
dinner, a supper, that will cost three or feur hun-

shall offer it as mine that each State  
would not only choose but absolutely  
compel their ablest men to attend Con­  
gress, and that they would instruct  
them to go into a thorough investigation  
of the causes that have produced so many  
disagreeable effects.
