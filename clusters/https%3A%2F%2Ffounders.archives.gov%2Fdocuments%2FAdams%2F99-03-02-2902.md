s consequences of the War, I wish to believe will be that of having disclosed to the observation of the  wise and virtuous men in our public Councils, who can rise above the smoke and vapour of party Spirit, the strength and the weakness of our public Institutions—I hope that the War has removed a strong and pernicious prejudice against the Navy—That it has proved how powerful a weapon it is, not only for the protection of our Commerce, and the annoyance of an European Enemy; but for the defence of our own territory—That it has inspired us not only with due Confidence in our own capacity of strength upon the Ocean, but with the full conviction that a developement of that Strength proportioned to that of our National growth, is among our most important interests and duties—That it has shewn us the principal defects of our Military Establishment, and pointed us to the remedies necessary to its improvement. That it has indicated the insufficiency of our system for the management of our finances, and pointed out to us the resources upon which in times of emergency the strongest  reliance may be placed—That it has weaned the friends of the present Administration from their fondness for embargoes, non intercourse, and commercial restrictions—And above all, I would hope that its tendency has been ultimately to cement the bonds of our National Union—That when the discordant Passions which have been excited by the conflicting opinions of National Interest for the last nine or ten years shall have subsided, both Parties will have learnt lessons of experience which may be improved to the general benefit of the whole.The termination of the War with Great–Britain has opened a new field of honour to our navy, which has already added to the rich harvest of their and their Country’s glor

I scarcely know whether you will find George’s hand–writing more legible than the press–copy—I had always thought that the saying of the Clown in Shakespear—that “to be well favoured is the gift of Fortune, but to write and read comes by Nature”—was a joke—George’s handwriting almost convinces me that the Clown is right—I am afraid he will never write a tolerable hand—He and his brothers are taking lessons not only of that elegant accomplishment but of the essential qualifications of dancing and fencing.

wish to believe will be that of having dis­  
closed to the observation of the wise and  
virtuous men in our public councils, who  
can rise above the smoke and vapour of  
party spirit, the strength or weakness of  
our public institutions. 1 hope that the

prejudice against the Navy—that it has  
proved how powerful a weapon it is, not  
only for the protection of our commerce  
and the annoyance of an European enemy,  
but for the defence of our territory. That  
it has inspired us not only with due confi­  
dence in our own capacity and strength up­  
on the ocean, but with the full conviction  
that a development of that strengh pro­  
portioned to that of our national erowtli is  
  
among our moot important interests and  
duties. That it has shewn us the princi­  
pal defects of our military establishments  
and pointed us to remedies. That it has  
indicated the insufficiency of our system for  
the management of our finances, and point­  
ed out to ns the resources upon which in
