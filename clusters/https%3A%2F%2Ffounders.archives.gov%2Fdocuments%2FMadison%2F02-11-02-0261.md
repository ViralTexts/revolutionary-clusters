artment of State, March 5. 1806.  
  
The Secretary of State, in Compliance with the order of the House of Representatives of the 6th of January, directing him to lay before it, “A Return of the number of American Seamen, who have been impressed or detained by the Ships of War or Privateers of Great Britain, whose names have been reported to the Department of State since the statement was made to the House, at the last session of Congress; mentioning the names of the persons impressed, with the names of the Ships or vessels by which they were impressed, and the time of the Impressment; together with any facts and Circumstances in relation to the same, which may have been reported to him: stating, also, the whole number of American seamen impressed, from the Commencement of the present war, in Europe, and including in a separate Column the number of passengers, if any, who may have been taken out of American vessels coming to the United states from Europe,” has the Honor to transmit herewith the names of Nine hundred and thirteen persons, who appear to have been impressed from American vessels and whose names have been reported to the Department of State since the last statement was made to Congress, together with a discrimination in the particulars required by the order except as hereafter mentioned.  
The aggregate number of Impressments into the British service since the Commencement of the present war in Europe is found to be Two thousand two hundred &amp; seventy three.  
It is not easy to distinguish, with accuracy, how many of these persons were really not Citizens of the United states; but the Column of Remarks added to the list in lieu of this discrimination will exhibit some ground for judging of the fact.  
It has not been deemed necessary to make a separate Column for Impressed Passengers, as this Description of Persons have been reported to be impressed but in the few Cases subjoined.  
It is proper to observe, that a small part only of the period since the last statement there was an Agent for Seamen for the Leeward Islands at Jamaica; the Gentleman who then held the Charge having resigned it; and another, who had been appointed to succeed him having declined accepting it. The Agent appointed for Antigua having been absent from that Island since his appointment in May    last, no Returns have been received from the Windward Islands. From these Circumstances, it is very probable that many Impressments have been made in the West Indian Seas, which, though of a recent date, are not included in the present Report. All which is respectfully submitted.

The Secretary of State, in&#x27;compli­  
ance with the order of the Houle of

direéing him to lay before it “ a re­

rate column, the number of passen­  
gers, if any who may have been tak­  
en out of American vellels coming to

the Lonor to transmit herewith the  
names of nine hundred and thirteen  
persons who appear to have been re­  
ported to the department of state since  
the last statement was made to Con.  
grefs ; together with difciimination in  
the particulars required by the order,  
except as hereafter mentioned.  
  
The aggregate number of imprefl­  
ments into the British service, since  
the commencement of the present war  
in Europe, is found to be two hundred  
and seventy taree. |  
It is not easy to distinguish with ac­  
curacy, how many of these persons  
were really not citizens of the United  
States, but the column of remarks,  
added to the lilt in lieu of this dist  
crimination, will exhibit some ground  
for judging of the fat.  
It has not been deemed necessary to  
make a separate column for impressed  
paflengers, as this description of per­  
sons have been reported to be imprefl  
ed but in the few cases {ubjoined.  
It is proper to observe, thata small  
part only of the period since the last  
statement there was an agent for sea­  
men for the leeward islands at Jamai­  
ca, the gentleman who then held the  
charge having resigned it, and another  
who had been appoiated to succeed  
him, having declined accepting it.—  
The agent appointed for Antigua hav­  
ing been ablent from that Iflund since  
his appointment in May laft,no returns  
have been received from the windward  
islands: From these circumf@tances it is  
very probable that many impreflments  
have beén made in the Welt Indian  
seas, which though of a recent datg,  
are not included in the present report.  
All which is refpeétfully submitted.
