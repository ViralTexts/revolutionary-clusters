shall be prov’d when it comes to the Test, which I believe we are upon the Border’s off.  
There is nothing Sir (I believe) more certain than that the Officer’s on the Canada Expedition had British pay allowd, whilst they were in the Service, Lieutt Wag[gene]r Captn Trent, and several other’s whom I have conversed with on tht Head, and were engagd in it, affirm it for truth: therefore Honble Sir, as this can’t be allow’d; suffer me to serve a Volunteer which I assure you will be the next reward to British pay, for As my Services, so far as I have knowledge will equal those of the best Officer, I make it a point of Honr to serve for less and accept a medium.

I would not have your Honour imagine from this, that I have said all these things to have the Pay encreas’d—but to justify myself, and shew your Honour that our complaints are not frivolous, but are founded upon strict Reason: for my own part, it is a matter almost indefferent whether I serve for full pay, or as a generous Volunteer; indeed, did my circumstances corrispond with my Inclination, I shd not hesitate a moment to prefer the Latter: for the motives that lead me here were pure and Noble I had no view of acquisition but that of Honour, by serving faithfully my King and Country.

.  
Now Sir, as I have answer’d your Honour’s Letter I shall beg  
  
leave to acqt you with what has happen’d since I wrote by Mr Gist; I then acquainted you that I had detach’d a party of 75 Men to meet with 50 of the French who we had Intelligence were upon their March towards us to Reconnoitre &amp;ca[.] Abt 9 Oclock the same Night, I receivd an express from the Half King who was Incampd with several of His People abt 6 Miles of, that he had seen the Tract of two French Men xing the Road and believ’d the whole body were lying not far off, as he had an acct of that number passing Mr Gist—I set out with 40 Men before 10, and was from that time till near Sun rise before we reach’d the Indian’s Camp, havg Marched in small path, &amp; heavy Rain, and a Night as Dark as it is possible to concieve—we were frequently tumbling one over another, and often so lost that 15 or 20 Minutes search would not find the path again.  
When we came to the Half King I council’d with him, and got his assent to go hand in hand and strike the French. accordingly, himself, Monacatoocha, and a few other Indians set out with us, and when we came to the place where the Tracts were, the Half King sent Two Indians to follow their Tract and discover their lodgment which they did abt half a mile from the Road in a very obscure place surrounded with Rocks. I thereupon in conjuction with the Half King &amp; Monacatoocha, formd a disposion to attack them on all sides, which we accordingly did and after an Engagement of abt 15 Minutes we killd 10, wounded one and took 21 Prisoner’s, amongst those that were killd was Monsieur De Jumonville the Commander, Principl Officers taken is Monsieur Druillong and Monsr Laforc, who your Honour has often heard me speak of as a bold Enterprising Man, and a person of gt subtilty and cunning with these are two Cadets—These Officers pretend they were coming on an Embassy, but the absurdity of this pretext is too glaring as your Honour will see by the Instructions and summons inclos’d: There Instructions were to reconnoitre the Country, Roads, Creeks &amp;ca to Potomack; which they were abt to do, These Enterpriseing Men were purposely choose out to get intelligence, which they were to send Back by some brisk dispatches with mention of the Day that they were to serve the Summon’s; which could be through no other view, than to get sufficient Reinforcements to fall upon us imediately after. This with several  
  
other Reasons induc’d all the Officers to beleive firmly that they were sent as spys rather than any thing else, and has occasiond my sending them as prisoners, tho they expected (or at least had some faint hope of being continued as ambassadors) They finding where we were Incamp’d, instead of coming up in a Publick manner sought out one of the most secret Retirements; fitter for a Deserter than an Ambassador to incamp in—s[t]ayd there two or 3 days sent Spies to Reconnoitre our Camp as we are told, tho they deny it—Their whole Body movd back near 2 Miles, sent off two runnors to acquaint Contracoeur with our Strength, and where we were Incamp’d &amp;ca now 36 Men wd almost have been a Retinue for a Princely Ambassador, instead of Petit, why did they, if there design’s were open stay so long within 5 Miles of us witht delivering his Ambassy, or acquainting me with it; his waiting cd be with no other design than to get Detachts to enforce the Summons as soon as it was given, they had no occasion to send out Spy’s; for the Name of Ambassador is Sacred among all Nations; but it was by the Tract of these Spy’s they were discoverd, and we got Intilligence of them—They wd not have retird two Miles back witht delivering the Summons and sought a sculking place (which to do them justice was done with gt Judgment) but for some especial Reason: Besides The Summon’s is so insolent, &amp; savour’s so much of Gascoigny that if two Men only had come openly to deliver it. It was too great Indulgence to have sent them back.  
The Sense of the Half King on this Subject is, that they have bad Hearts, and that this is a mere pretence, they never designd to have come to us but in a hostile manner, and if we were so foolish as to let them go again, he never would assist us in taking another of them[.] Besides, looseing La Force I really think wd tend more to our disservice than 50 other Men, as he is a person whose active Spirit, leads him into all parlys, and brought him acquainted with all parts, add to this a perfect use of the Indian Tongue, and gt influence with the Indian He Ingenuously enough confessd that as soon as he saw the commission &amp; Instructions that he believd and then said he expected some such tendency tho he pretends to say he does not believe the Commander had any other but a good design.  
In this Engagement we had only one Man killd, and two or  
  
three wounded, among which was Lieutt Waggener slightly—a most miraculous escape, as Our Right Wing was much exposd to their Fire and receivd it all.

“ Now, sir, as I have answered your letter, I shall beg leave to  
acquaint you with what has happened since I wrote by Mr. Gist.  
I then informed you, that I had detached a party of seventy-five  
men to meet fifty of the French, who, we had intelligence, were  
upon their march towards us. About nine o’clock the same night,  
I received an express from the Half-King, who was encamped with  
several of his people about six miles off, that: he had seen the tracks  
of two Frenchmen crossing the road, and that, behind, the whole  
body were lying not far off, as he had an account of that number  
passing Mr. Gist’s.

search would not find the path again.

with us; and when we came to the place where the tracks were,  
  
the Half-King sent two Indians to follow their tracks, and discover  
their lodgement, which they did at a half a mile from the road,  
in a very obscure place surrounded with rocks. I thereupon, in  
conjunction with the Half-King and Monacawacha, formed a  
disposition to attack them on all sides, which we accordingly did,  
and, after an engagement of about fifteen minutes, we killed ten,  
wounded one, and took twenty-one prisoners. Amongst those  
killed was M. de Jumonville, the commander. The principal  
officers taken are M. Drouillon, and M. La Force of whom your  
Honor has often heard me speak, as a bold enterprising man,  
and a person of great subtlety and cunning. With these are two  
cadets.  
  
“ These officers pretend they were coming on an embassy ; but  
the absurdity of this pretext is too glaring, as you will see by the  
instructions and summons enclosed. ‘Their instructions were to  
reconnoitre the country, roads, creeks, and the like, as far as the  
Potomac, which they were about to do. These enterprising men  
were purposely chosen out to procure intelligence, which they  
were to send back by some brisk despatches, with the mention of  
the day that they were to serve the summons; which could be  
with no other view, than to get a sufficient reinforcement to fall  
upon us immediately after. This, with several other reasons,  
induced all the officers to believe firmly, that they were sent as  
spies, rather than any thing else, and has occasioned my detaining  
them as prisoners, though they expected, or at least had some faint  
hope, that they should be continued as ambassadors.  
  
“They, finding where we were encamped, instead of coming  
up in a public manner, sought out one of the most secret retire-  
ments, fitter for a deserter than an ambassador to encamp in, and  
stayed there two or three days, sending spies to reconnoitre our  
camp, as we are told, though they deny it. Their whole body  
moved back near two miles, and they sent off two runners to  
acquaint Contrecceur with our strength, and where we were en-  
camped. Now thirty-six men would almost have been a retinue  
for a princely ambassador, instead of a petit. Why did they,  
if their designs were open, stay so long within five miles of us,  
without delivering their message, or acquainting me with it?  
Their waiting could be with no other design, than to get detach-  
ments to enforce the summons, as soon as it was given. They  
had no occasion to send out s spies, for the name of an ambassador  
is sacred among all nations; but it was by the track of those  
spies, that they were discovered, and that we got intelligence of  
them. They would not have retired two miles back without de-  
livering the summons, and sought a skulking-place (which, to do  
them justice, was done with great judgment, ) but for some special  
reason. Besides, the summons is so insolent, and savors so much

 me notice of  
the summons, or any thing that related  
to their embassy? ..... They pretend  
that they called to us as soon as we were  
discovered, which is absolutely false; for I  
was at the head of the party approaching  
them, and I can affirm that as soon as  
they saw us, they ran to their arms with-  
out calling, which I should have heard  
had they done so.”  
  
The short and simple account given by  
Washington to Governor Dinwiddie is  
this: “I set out with forty men before ten,  
and it was from that time until near sun-  
rise before we reached the Indians’ camp,  
having marched in small paths, through a  
heavy rain, and a night as dark as it is  
possible to conceive. We were frequently  
tumbling one over another, and often so  
lost that fifteen or twenty minutes’ search  
would not find the path again.  
  
“When we came to the Half-king, I  
counselled with him, and got his assent to  
go hand-in-hand and strike the French.  
Accordingly he, Monacawacha, and a few  
other Indians, set out with us, and when  
we came to the place where the troops  
were, the Half-king sent two Indians to  
follow the tracks and discover their lodg-  
ment, which they did, at a very obscure  
place, surrounded with rocks. I thereupon,  
in conjunction with the Half-king and  
Monacawacha, formed a disposition to at-  
tack ‘them on all sides, which we accord-  
ingly did, and after an engagement of  
fifteen minutes, we killed ten, wounded one,  
and took twenty-one prisoners. Amongst  
those killed was M. Jumonville, the com-  
mander. The principal officers taken are  
  
Washington&#x27;s Early Days.  
  
133  
  
M. Drouillon and M. La Force, of whom  
your Honor has often heard me speak, as  
a bold enterprising man, and a person of  
great subtlety and cunning. These officers  
  
retend they were coming on an embassy ;  
  
ut the absurdity of this pretext is too  
glaring, as you will see by the Instructions  
and Summons inclosed. Their instructions  
were to reconnoitre the country, roads,  
creeks, and the like, as far as the Poto-  
mac, which they were about to do. These  
enterprising men were purposely chosen  
out to procure intelligence, which they  
were to send back by some brisk de-  
spatches, with the mention of the day  
that they were to serve the summons,  
which could be with no other view than  
to-get a sufficient reinforcement to fall  
upon us immediately after.”
