The principal feature in the tribune, after the  
precedent of several of the early Christian  
churches, is the colossal figure of our Lord,  
with the signs of the Apocalypse.  
  
The subjects in the apse windows are those  
combined in that verse of the Litany, “ By thine  
agony and bloody sweat: by thy cross and  
passion : by thy precious death and burial: by  
thy glorious resurrection and ascension: and by  
the coming of the Holy Ghost: Good Lord,

are the figures of angels in the spandrels of the  
clearstory windows of the choir, bearing the  
‘‘elements of the Passion,”—such as the Cross  
and Scourge, the Crown of Thorns, &amp;c.  
  
The pavement in the apse is of choice marbles,  
forming part of the original construction ; but  
the pilasters and parts of the walls were painted  
as mentioned in the “ Parentalia,” “ to serve the  
present occasion.” It is now proposed to sub-
