e me Sir when I add, that this proof of your holding me in remembrance, is most pleasing &amp; acceptable.  
Our conflict is not likely to cease so soon as every good man would wish. The measure of inequity is not yet filled—and unless we can return a little more to first principles, &amp; act a little more upon patriotic ground, I do not know when it will—or—what may be the issue of the contest—Speculation—peculation—engrossing—forestalling—with all their concomitants, afford too many melancholy proofs of the decay of public virtue; and too glaring instances of its being the interest &amp; desire of too many, who would wish to be thought friends, to continue the War.  
Nothing I am convinced but the depreciation of our currency proceding in a great measure from the foregoing causes—aided by stock jobbing &amp; party dissentions—has fed the hopes of the enemy &amp; kept the Arms of Briton in America untill now. They do not scruple to declare this themselves—and add that, we shall be our own conquerors. Cannot our common Country (America) possess virtue enough to disappoint them? Is the consideration of a little dirty pelf, to individuals, to be placed in competition with the essential rights &amp; liberties of the present generation, &amp; of millions yet unborn? shall a few designing men for their own aggrandizement, and to gratify their own avarice, overset the goodly fabric we have been rearing at the expence of so much time, blood, &amp; treasure? and shall we at last become the victems of our own abominable
