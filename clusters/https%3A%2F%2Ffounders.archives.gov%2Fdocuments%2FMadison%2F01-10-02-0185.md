[30 November 1787]  
We have seen the necessity of the union as our bulwark against foreign danger, as the conservator of peace among ourselves, as the guardian of our commerce and other common interests, as the only substitute for those military establishments which have subverted the liberties of the old world, and as the proper antidote for the diseases of faction, which have proved fatal to other popular governments, and of which alarming symptoms have been betrayed by our own. All that remains, within this branch of our enquiries, is to take notice of an objection, that may be drawn from the great extent of country which the union embraces. A few observations on this subject will be the more proper, as it is perceived that the adversaries of the new constitution are availing themselves of a prevailing prejudice, with regard to the practicable sphere of republican administration, in order to supply by imaginary difficulties, the want of those solid objections, which they endeavour in vain to find.  
  
The error which limits republican government to a narrow district, has been unfolded and refuted in preceding papers. I remark here only, that it seems to owe its rise and prevalence chiefly to the confounding of a republic with a democracy: And applying to the former reasonings drawn from the nature of the latter. The true distinction between these forms was also adverted to on a former occasion. It is, that in a democracy, the people meet and exercise the government in person; in a republic they assemble and administer it by their representatives and agents. A democracy consequently must be confined to a small spot. A republic may be extended over a large region.  
To this accidental source of the error may be added, the artifice of some celebrated author

at the same time wholly on that principle. If Europe has the merit of discovering this great mechanical power in government, by the simple agency of which, the will of the largest political body may be concentred, and its force directed to any object, which the public good requires: America can claim the merit of making the discovery the basis of unmixed and extensive republics. It is only to be lamented, that any of her citizens should wish to deprive her of the additional merit of displaying its full efficacy in the establishment of the comprehensive system now under her consideration.  
As the natural limit of a democracy is that distance from the central point, which will just permit the most remote citizens to assemble as often as their public functions demand; and will include no greater number than can join in those functions; so the natural limit of a republic is that distance from the centre, which will barely allow the representatives of the people to meet as often as may be necessary for the administration of public affairs. Can it be said, that the limits of the United States exceed this distance? It will not be said by those who recollect that the Atlantic coast is the longest side of the union; that during the term of thirteen years, the representatives of the states have been almost continually assembled; and that the members from the most distant states are not chargeable with greater intermissions of attendance, than those from the states in the neighbourhood of Congress.  
That we may form a juster estimate with regard to this interesting subject, let us resort to the actual dimensions of the union. The limits, as fixed by the treaty of peace are on the East the Atlantic, on the South the latitude of thirty one degrees, on the West the Mississippi, and on the North an irregular line running in some instances beyond the forty-fifth degree, in others falling as low as the forty-second. The Southern shore of lake Erie lies below that latitude. Computing the distance between the thirty-first and forty-fifth degrees, it amounts to nine hundred and seventy three common miles; computing it from thirty one to forty two degrees to seven hundred, sixty four miles and an half. Taking the mean for the distance, the amount will be eight hundred, sixty eight miles and three fourths. The mean distance from the Atlantic to the Mississippi, does not probably exceed seven hundred and fifty miles. On a comparison of this extent, with that of several countries in Europe, the practicability of rendering our system commensurate to it, appears to be demonstrable. It is not a great deal larger than Germany, where a diet, representing the whole empire is continually assembled; or than Poland before the late dismemberment, where another national d

ain, we find that in Great Britain, inferior as it may be in size, the representatives of the Northern extremity of the island, have as far to travel to the national council, as will be required of those of the most remote parts of the union.  
Favourable as this view of the subject may be, some observations remain which will place it in a light still more satisfactory.  
In the first place it is to be remembered, that the general government is not to be charged with the whole power of making and administering laws. Its jurisdiction is limited to certain enumerated objects, which concern all the members of the republic, but which are not to be attained by the separate provisions of any. The subordinate governments which can extend their care to all those other objects, which can be separately provided for, will retain their due authority and activity. Were it proposed by the plan of the convention to abolish the governments of the particular states, its adversaries would have some ground for their objection, though it would not be difficult to show that if they were abolished, the general government would be compelled by the principle of self preservation, to reinstate them in their proper jurisdiction.  
A second observation to be made is, that the immediate object of the federal constitution is to secure the union of the Thirteen primitive States, which we know to be practicable; and to add to them such other states, as may arise in their own bosoms, or in their neighbourhoods, which we cannot doubt to be equally practicable. The arrangements that may be necessary for those angles and fractions of our territory, which lie on our north-western frontier, must be left to those whom further discoveries and experience will render more equal to the task.  
Let it be remarked in the third place, that the intercourse throughout the union will be daily facilitated by new improvements. Roads will every where be shortened, and kept in better order; accommodations for travellers will be multiplied and meliorated; an interior navigation on our eastern side will be opened throughout, or nearly throughout the whole extent of the Thirteen States. The communication between the Western and Atlantic districts, and between different parts of each, will be rendered more and more easy by those numerous canals with which the beneficence of nature has intersected our country, and which art finds it so little difficult to connect and complete.  
A fourth and still more important consideration is, that as almost every state will on one side or other be a frontier, and will thus find in a regard to its safety, an inducement to make some sacrifices for the sake of the general protection; so the states which lie at the greatest distance from the heart of the union, and which of course may partake least of the o

ve less benefit therefore from the union in some respects, than the less distant states, they will derive greater benefit from it in other respects, and thus the proper equilibrium will be maintained throughout.  
I submit to you my fellow citizens, these considerations, in full confidence that the good sense which has so often marked your decisions, will allow them their due weight and effect; and that you will never suffer difficulties, however formidable in appearance or however fashionable the error on which they may be founded, to drive you into the gloomy and perilous scenes into which the advocates for disunion would conduct you. Hearken not to the unnatural voice which tells you that the people of America, knit together as they are by so many cords of affection, can no longer live together as members of the same family; can no longer continue the mutual guardians of their mutual happiness; can no longer be fellow citizens of one great respectable and flourishing empire. Hearken not to the voice which petulantly tells you that the form of government recommended for your adoption is a novelty in the political world; that it has never yet had a place in the theories of the wildest projectors; that it rashly attempts what it is impossible to accomplish. No my countrymen, shut your ears against this unhallowed language. Shut your hearts against the poison which it conveys; the kindred blood which flows in the veins of American citizens, the mingled blood which they have shed in defence of their sacred rights, consecrate their union, and excite horror at the idea of their becoming aliens, rivals, enemies. And if novelties are to be shunned, believe me the most alarming of all novelties, the most wild of all projects, the most rash of all attempts, is that of rending us in pieces, in order to preserve our liberties and promote our happiness. But why is the experiment of an extended republic to be rejected merely because it may comprise what is new? Is it not the glory of the people of America, that whilst they have paid a decent regard to the opinions of former times and other nations, they have not suffered a blind veneration for antiquity, for custom, or for names, to overrule the suggestions of their own good sense, the knowledge of their own situation, and the lessons of their own experience? To this manly spirit, posterity will be indebted for the possession, and the world for the example of the numerous innovations displayed on the American theatre, in favour of private rights and public happiness. Had no important step been taken by the leaders of the revolution for which a precedent could not be discovered, no government established of which an exact model did not present itself, the people of the United States might, at this moment, have been numbered among the melancholy victims of misguided councils, must at best have been labouring under the weight of some of those forms which have crushed the liberties of the rest of mankind. Happily for America, happily we trust for the whole human race, they pursued a new and more noble course. They accomplished a revolution which has no parallel in the annals of human society: They reared the fabrics of governments which have no model on the face of the globe. They formed the design of a great confederacy, which it is incumbent on their successors to improve and perpetuate. If their works betray imperfections, we wonder at the fewness of them. If they erred most in the structure of the union, this was the work most difficult to be executed, this is the work which has been new modelled by the act of your convention, and it is that act on which you are now to deliberate and to decide

side in 1783 must have had, and we  
shall have no difficulty whatsoever in  
running the line according to the  
terms and provisions of the treaty.  
Besides, we will shew you, to begin  
with, on the authority of one of your  
own much-vaunted statesmen and  
atriots, Madison, that it is ridicu-  
ous to look for those highlands  
north of the St. John’s river, where  
= pretend they are to be found.  
fadison, writing as a contributor to  
The Federalist,a work carried on by  
him in conjunction with Hamilton  
and Jay, wrote thus. It was in the  
year 1788, five years after the con-  
clusion of the treaty. Speaking of  
the “actual dimensions” of the  
Union, he says :—  
  
“The limits, as fixed by the treaty of  
peace are, on the east side, the Atlantic ;  
on the south, the latitude of thirty-one  
degrees ; on the west, the Mississippi ;  
and on the north, an irregular line run-  
ning in some instances beyond the forty  
fifth degree, in others, falling as low as  
the forty-second. ‘The southern shore of  
Lake Erie lies below that latitude. Com-  
puting the distance between the thirty-  
fourth and forty-fifth degrees, it amounts  
to nine hundred and seventy-three com-  
mon miles, computing it from thirty-one  
to forty-two degrees, to seven hundred  
and sixty-four miles and a half. Taking  
the mean for the distance, the amount  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
1843.]  
  
will be eight hundred and sixty-eight  
miles and three-fourths. ‘The mean dis«  
tance from the Atlantic to the Mississippi  
does not probably exceed seven hundred  
and fifty miles.—Federalist, p. 63. O

arise, or admonishing what they might be?&quot; I submit to  
veil, my fellow-cltiseni, these considerations in full confi­  
dence that the good tense that has so often merited your de  
cinona, will allow tUein their due weight and etfeoi, and that  
you wiU never suffer difficulties, however formidable in ap­  
pearance, or however fashionable the error in which they  
may be founded, to drive you into the gloomy and perilous  
scenes Into whioh the advocate for disunion would conduct  
you. Hearken not to the unnatural voice which tells you  
that tbe people of Amrrica, knit together as they are by so  
many cords of affection, can no longer live together as inein­  
bara of the same family?can no longer oontinue tbe mutual  
guardians of their mutual bappinest?can no longer be fi l­  
low-citnceus of one great, respectable, and flourishing em­  
pire. Hearken not to the voice whioh petulantly Mils you  
that tbe form of government recommended for your adop­  
tion is a novelty Tn the political world?that It has neve&amp;yet  
had a place in the theories of the wildest projectors?that it  
rasbly attempts what it is impossible to accomplish. No,  
i?y countrymen, shut your ears against this unhallowed  
language. Shut your hearts against the poison which it  
conveys. The kindred blood which flows in the veins of  
American citizens, the mingled blood which tbey have  
shed in defence of their sacred rights, consecrate their union,  
and excite horror at the idea of their becoming aliens, ri­  
vals, enemies. And if novelties ate to be shunned, believe  
me the most alarming of all novelties, the mouwildof all  
projects, the most rasli ol all attempts, is that of roiidingus  
in pieces, in order to preserve our liberties and promote our  
happiaass.

ject&quot; of the Federal Constitution :  
&quot;A second observation to be made is, that the  
  
immediate object of the Federal Constitution is to  
secure the Onion of the thirtem primitive States,  
which we know to be practicable; and to add to  
them such other States as may arise in their own  
bosoii.s or in their neighborhoods, which we  
cannot doubt to be equally practicable. The  
arrangements that may be necessary for those  
angles and fractions of our territory, which lie  
on our northwestern frontier, must be left to  
those whom further discoveries and experience  
will render more equal to the task.&quot;  
In the same number, in speaking of the im­  
portance of the Union and the evils and absurd­  
ity of disunion, that wise man used this language,  
which is as applicable now as ihen:  
&quot;I submit to you, my fellow-citizens, these  
considerations in full confidence that the good  
sense which has so often marked your decisions  
will allow them their due weight and effect j and  
that you will never suffer difficulties, however  
formidable in appearance, or however fashiona­  
ble the error on which they may be founded, to  
drive you into the gloomy and perilous scenes  
into which the advocates for disunion would  
conduct you. Hearken not to the unnatural  
voice, which tells you that the people of Ameri­  
ca, knit together as they are by so many chords  
of affection, can no longer live together as mem­  
bers of the same family ; can no longer continue  
the mutual guardians of their mutual happiness;  
can no longer be fellow-citizens of one great, res­  
pectable and flourishing empire.  
&quot;Hearken not to the voice, which petulently  
tells you, that the form of government recom­  
mended for your adoption, is a novelty in the  
political world; that it has never yet had a place  
in the theories of the wildest projectors ; that it

merican citizens, the mingled blood which they  
have shed in defence of their sacred rights, con­  
secrate their union, and excite horror at the idea  
of their becoming aliensT rivals, enemies.  
&quot;And if novelties are tobe shunned, believe me,

not the glory of the people of America, that whilst they have  
paid a decent regard to the opinions of former times and other  
nations, they have not suffered a blind veneration for antiquity,  
for custom, or for names, to overrule the suggestions of their  
own good sense, the knowledge of their own situation, and the  
lessons of their own experience? Zo this manly spirit poster-  
aty will be indebted for the possession, and the world for the ex-  
ample, of the numerous innovations on the American theatre,  
in favor of private rights and publichappiness. Had no im-  
portant step been taken by the leaders of the revolution, for  
which a precedent could not be discovered; no government of  
which an exact model did not present itself, the people of the  
United States might, at this moment, have been numbered  
among the melancholy victims of misguided councils; must  
have, at best, been laboring under the weight of some of those  
Jorms which have crushed the liberties of the rest of mankind.  
Happily for America, happily, we trust, for the whole human  
race, they pursued a new and more noble course. They-accom-  
plished a revolution which has no parallel in the annals of hu-  
man society. They reared the fabrics of governments which  
have no model on the face of the globe. They formed the de-  
sign of a great confederacy, which it is incumbent on their  
successors to improve and perpetuate. If their works betray  
imperfections, we wonder at the fewness of them.’

radical vice, of all the legislation of the eighteenth century
