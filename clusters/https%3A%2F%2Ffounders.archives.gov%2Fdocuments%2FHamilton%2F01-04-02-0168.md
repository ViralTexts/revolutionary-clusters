a complication of dangers to which you would be exposed should you permit that sacred knot which binds the people of America together to be severed or dissolved by ambition or by avarice, by jealousy or by misrepresentation. In the sequel of the inquiry, through which I propose to accompany you, the truths intended to be inculcated will receive further confirmation from facts and arguments hitherto unnoticed. If the road, over which you will still have to pass, should in some places appear to you tedious or irksome, you will recollect, that you are in quest of information on a subject the most momentous which can engage the attention of a free people: t

In pursuance of the plan, which I have laid down for the discussion of the subject, the point next in order to be examined is the “insufficiency of the present confederation to the preservation of the Union.” It may perhaps be asked, what need is there of reasoning or proof to illustrate a position, which is not either controverted or doubted; to which the understandings and feelings of all classes of men assent; and which in substance is admitted by the opponents as well as by the friends of the New Constitution? It must in truth be acknowle

 that there are material imperfections in our national system, and that something is necessary to be done to rescue us from impending anarchy. The facts that support this opinion are no longer objects of speculation. They have forced themselves upon the sensibility of the people at large, and have at length extorted from those, whose mistaken policy has had the principal share in precipitating the extremity, at which we are arrived, a reluctant confession of the reality of those defects in the scheme of our Fœderal Government, which have been long pointed out and regretted by the intelligent friends of the Union.  
We may indeed with propriety be said to have reached almost the last stage of national humiliation. There is scarcely any thing that can wound the pride, or degrade the character of an independent nation, which we do not experience. Are there engagements to the performance of which we are held by every tie respectable among men? These are the subjects of constant and unblushing violation. Do we owe debts to foreigners and to our own citizens contracted in a time of imminent peril, for the preservation of our political existence? These remain without any proper or satisfactory provision for their discharge. Have we valuable territories and important posts in the possession of a foreign power, which by express stipulations ought long since to have been surrendered? These are still retained, to the prejudice of our interests not less than of our rights. Are we in a condition to resent, or to repel the aggression? We have neither troops nor treasury nor government.  
  
I mean for the Union.  
  
Are we even in a condition to remonstrate with dignity? The just imputations on our own faith, in respect to the same treaty, ought first to be removed. Are we entitled by nature and compact to a free participation in the navigation of the Mississippi? Spain excludes us from it. Is public credit an indispensable resource in time of public danger? We seem to have abandoned its cause as desperate and irretrievable. Is commerce of importance to national wealth? Ours is at the lowest point of declension. Is respectability in the eyes of foreign powers a safe guard against foreign encroachments? The imbecility of our Government even forbids them to treat with us: Our ambassadors abroad are the mere pageants of mimic sovereignty. Is a violent and unnatural decrease in the value of land a symptom of national distress? The price of improved land in most parts of the country is much lower than can be accounted for by the quantity of waste land at market, and can only be fully explained by that want of private and public confidence, which are so alarmingly prevalent among all ranks and which have a direct tendency to depreciate property of every kind. Is private credit the friend and patron of industry? That most useful kind which relates to borrowing and lending is reduced within the narrowest limits, and this still more from an opinion of insecurity than from the scarcity of money. To shorten an enumeration of particulars which can afford neither pleasure nor instruction it may in general be demanded, what indication is there of national disorder, poverty and insignificance that could befal a community so peculiarly blessed with natural advantages as we are, which does not form a part of the dark catalogue of our public misfortunes?  
This is the melancholy situation, to which we have been brought by those very maxims and councils, which would now deter us from adopting the proposed constitution; and which not content with having conducted us to the brink of a precipice, seem resolved to plunge us into the abyss, that awaits us below. Here, my Countrymen, impelled by every motive that ought to influence an enlightened people, let us make a firm stand for our safety, our tranquillity, our dignity, our reputation. Let us at last break the fatal charm which has too long seduced us from the paths of felicity and prosperity.  
It is true, as has been before observed, that facts too stubborn to be resisted have produced a species of general assent to the abstract proposition that there exist material defects in our national system; but the usefulness of the concession, on the part of the old adversaries of fœderal measures, is destroyed by a strenuous opposition to a remedy, upon the only principles, that can give it a chance of success. While they admit that the Government of the United States is destitute of energy; they contend against conferring upon it those powers which are requisite to supply that energy: They seem still to aim at things repugnant and irreconcilable—at an augmentation of Fœderal authority without a diminution of State authority—at sovereignty in the Union and complete independence in the members. They still in fine seem to cherish with blind devotion the political monster of an imperium in imperio. This renders a full display of the principal defects of the confederation necessary, in order to shew, that the evils we experience do not proceed from minute or partial imperfections, but from fundamental errors in the structure of the building which cannot be amended otherwise than by an alteration in the first principles and main pillars of the fabric.  
The great and radical vice in the construction of the existing Confederation is in the principle of LEGISLATION for STATES or GOVERNMENTS, in their CORPORATE or COLLECTIVE CAPACITIES and as contradistinguished from the INDIVIDUALS of whom they consist. Though this principle does not run through all the powers delegated to the Union; yet it pervades and governs those, on which the efficacy of the rest depends. Except as to the rule of apportionment, the United States have an indefinite discretion to make requisitions for men and money; but they have no authority to raise either by regulations extending to the individual citizens of America. The consequence of this is, that though in theory their resolutions concerning those objects are laws, constitutionally binding on the members of the Union, yet in practice they are mere recommendations, which the States observe or disregard at their option.  
  
It is a singular instance of the capriciousness of the human mind, that after all the admonitions we have had from experience on this head, there should still be found men, who object to the New Constitution for deviating from a principle which has been found the bane of the old; and which is in itself evidently incompatible with the idea of GOVERNMENT; a principle in short which if it is to be executed at all must substitute the violent and sanguinary agency of the sword to the mild influence of the Magistracy.  
There is nothing absurd or impracticable in the idea of a league or alliance between independent nations, for certain defined purposes precisely stated in a treaty; regulating all the details of time, place, circumstance and quantity; leaving nothing to future discretion; and depending for its execution on the good faith of the parties. Compacts of this kind exist among all civilized nations subject to the usual vicissitudes of peace and war, of observance and non observance, as the interests or passions of the contracting powers dictate. In the early part of the present century, there was an epidemical rage in Europe for this species of compacts; from which the politicians of the times fondly hoped for benefits which were never realised. With a view to establishing the equilibrium of power and the peace of that part of the world, all the resources of negotiation were exhausted, and triple and quadruple alliances were formed; but they were scarcely formed before they were broken, giving an instructive but afflicting lesson to mankind how little dependence is to be placed on treaties which have no other sanction than the obligations of good faith; and which oppose general considerations of peace and justice to the impulse of any immediate interest and passion.  
If the particular States in this country are disposed to stand in a similar relation to each other, and to drop the project of a general DISCRETIONARY SUPERINTENDENCE, the scheme would indeed be pernicious, and would entail upon us all the mischiefs that have been enumerated under the first head; but it would have the merit of being at least consistent and practicable. Abandoning all views towards a confederate Government, this would bring us to a simple alliance offensive and defensive; and would place us in a situation to be alternately friends and enemies of each other as our mutual jealousies and rivalships nourished by the intrigues of foreign nations should prescribe to us.  
But if we are unwilling to be placed in this perilous situation; if we will still adhere to the design of a national government, or which is the same thing of a superintending power under the direction of a common Council, we must resolve to incorporate into our plan those ingredients which may be considered as forming the characteristic difference between a league and a government; we must extend the authority of the union to the persons of the citizens,—the only proper objects of government.  
Government implies the power of making laws. It is essential to the idea of a law, that it be attended with a sanction; or, in other words, a penalty or punishment for disobedience. If there be no penalty annexed to disobedience, the resolutions or commands which pretend to be laws will in fact amount to nothing more than advice or recommendation. This penalty, whatever it may be, can only be inflicted in two ways; by the agency of the Courts and Ministers of Justice, or by military force; by the COERTION of the magistracy, or by the COERTION of arms. The first kind can evidently apply only to men—the last kind must of necessity be employed against bodies politic, or communities or States. It is evident, that there is no process of a court by which their observance of the laws can in the last resort be enforced. Sentences may be denounced against them for violations of their duty; but these sentences can only be carried into execution by the sword. In an association where the general authority is confined to the collective bodies of the communities that compose it, every breach of the laws must involve a state of war, and military execution must become the only instrument of civil obedience. Such a state of things can certainly not deserve the name of government, nor would any prudent man choose to commit his happiness to it.  
There was a time when we were told that breaches, by the States, of the regulations of the fœderal authority were not to be expected—that a sense of common interest would preside over the conduct of the respective members, and would beget a full compliance with all the constitutional requisitions of the Union. This language at the present day would appear as wild as a great part of what we now hear from the same quarter will be thought, when we shall have received further lessons from that best oracle of wisdom, experience. It at all times betrayed an ignorance of the true springs by which human conduct is actuated, and belied the original inducements to the establishment of civil power. Why has government been instituted at all? Because the passions of men will not conform to the dictates of reason and justice, without constraint. Has it been found that bodies of men act with more rectitude or greater disinterestedness than individuals? The contrary of this has been inferred by all accurate observers of the conduct of mankind; and the inference is founded upon obvious reasons. Regard to reputation has a less active influence, when the infamy of a bad action is to be divided among a number, than when it is to fall singly upon one. A spirit of faction which is apt to mingle its poison in the deliberations of all bodies of men, will often hurry the persons of whom they are composed into improprieties and excesses, for which they would blush in a private capacity.  
In addition to all this, there is in the nature of sovereign power an impatience of controul, that disposes those who are invested with the exercise of it, to look with an evil eye upon all external attempts to restrain or direct its operations. From this spirit it happens that in every political association which is formed upon the principle of uniting in a common interest a number of lesser sovereignties, there will be found a kind of excentric tendency in the subordinate or inferior orbs, by the operation of which there will be a perpetual effort in each to fly off from the common center. This tendency is not difficult to be accounted for. It has its origin in the love of power. Power controuled or abridged is almost always the rival and enemy of that power by which it is controuled or abriged. This simple proposition will teach us how little reason there is to expect, that the persons, entrusted with the administration of the affairs of the particular members of a confederacy, will at all times be ready, with perfect good humour, and an unbiassed regard to the public weal, to execute the resolutions or decrees of the general authority. The reverse of this results from the constitution of human nature.

f popular assemblies; who have seen how difficult it often is, when there is no exterior pressure of circumstances, to bring them to harmonious resolutions on important points, will readily conceive how impossible it must be to induce a number of such assemblies, deliberating at a distance from each other, at different times, and under different impressions, long to cooperate in the same views and pursuits.  
In our case, the concurrence of thirteen distinct sovereign wills is requisite under the confederation to the complete execution of every important measure, that proceeds from the Union. It has happened as was to have been foreseen. The measures of the Union have not been executed; and the delinquencies of the States have step by step matured themselves to an extreme; which has at length arrested all the wheels of the national government, and brought them to an awful stand. Congress at this time scarcely possess the means of keeping up the forms of administration; ’till the States can have time to agree upon a more substantial substitute for the present shadow of a fœderal government. Things did not come to this desperate extremity at once. The causes which have been specified produced at first only unequal and disproportionate degrees of compliance with the requisitions of the Union. The greater deficiencies of some States furnished the pretext of example and the temptation of interest to the complying, or to the least delinquent States. Why should we do more in proportion than those who are embarked with us in the same political voyage? Why should we consent to bear more than our proper share of the common burthen? These were suggestions which human selfishness could not withstand, and which even speculative men, who looked forward to remote consequences, could not, without hesitation, combat. Each State yielding to the persuasive voice of immediate interest and convenience has successively withdrawn its support, ’till the frail and tottering edifice seems ready to fall upon our heads and to crush us beneath its ruins.

clusively delegated to (be United Slatea.(7&gt; And through  
the whole series of those essay*, the authors speak ol the  
&quot;residuary sovereignty of the Slates,” inviolably preaerv­  
ed in every respect, except so far as the enumerated  
grants of llie Constitution have divested the States.( m)  
In those same able expositions ol the Constitution, wo  
are told that there is nothing absurd or impracticable in the  
idea of a league or alliance bel ween&#x27;independent nations,  
for certain defined purposes precisely stated in a treaty; !  
regulating all the details ol lime, place, circumstance  
and quantity; leaving nothing to future discretion; and de­  
pending for its execution noon tho good faith ol the par­  
ties. Compacts of this kind exist among all civilized na­  
tion*, subject to the usual vicissitudes ol peace and war—  
of observance and non-observance, as (ho interests ami  
passions of the contracting powers dictate. If the par-&#x27;  
ticular States in this country ate disposed to stand in a si­  
milar relation to each other, and to drop the project of a  
general government, the scheme would indeed be perni­  
cious and entail upon us all the mischiefs of the old con­  
federation. By abandoning all views towards a coulede- I  
rale government, this would bring us lo a simple alliance, I  
offensive and delendw; and would place us in a situation I  
to be alternate Iriemls and enemies of eacli oilier, a* our i  
mutual jealousies and livalshfps, nourished by foreign in- I  
trigue, should prescribe to us. To such a union as this no  
prudent man would trust his happiness; nor was it intended i  
to create such a ouc.(n)

bate in hi* State Convention: “The f&gt;c|MiMte indepen- j

&#x27; of ihe Union to Ihe persons of the citizens?the only j  
&#x27; proper objects of government.  
&quot; Government implies the power of making Laws ? j  
&#x27; h is essential to the idea of a loir, that it be attended uith i  
? ? sanction, cr in other words, a penalty or punishment  
i ^j&#x27;for disobedience. If there be no penally anexed to  
1 disobedience, the resolutions or commands which pre­  
i tend to be laws, will in fact amount to nothing more  
&#x27; than advice or reaommendalion This penalty, what  
? ever it may be, can only be inflicted in two ways: by  
&#x27; the agency of the Courts, and ministers of justice, or ,  
? by military force: by Ihe COERCION ol the ntagis j  
i tracy, or by the COERCION of arm* The first can |  
? only apply lo men : ihe last kind must ol necessity be j  
&lt; employed against bodies politic, or communities or J  
? Slates.  
&quot; Why has Government been instituted at all? Be- i  
&#x27; cause the passions of men will not conform lo the die- j  
&#x27; la&#x27;.es of iea?on and justice w ithout constraint. Mas j  
? it been found that bodies of men act wilh more recti­  
1 tude or greater disinterestedness than individuals.&#x27;?  
i The contrary of this has been inferred by all accurate  
? observers of the conduct of mankind, and ihe inference  
1 is founded upon obvious reasons Regard to reputa­  
? tion has a less active influence, when the infamy of a  
? bad action is to he divided among a number, than  
? when it is to fall singly upon nne. A spirit of faction,  
? w hich is apt to mingle its poison in Ihe deliberation of  
? all bodies of men, will often hurry t he persons of whom  
&#x27; ihey arc composed into improprieties and excesses lor i  
&#x27; which they would blush in a private capacity.

to raise either by regulations extending to the individuals of America.  
The consequence of this is, that though in theory their resolutions con-  
cerning these objects are laws, constitutionally binding on the members  
of the Union, yet in practice they are mere recommendations, which the  
states may observe or disregard, at their option.”” And again, says the  
same writer, “The concurrence of thirteen distinct sovereignties is re-  
quisite, under the confederation, to the complete execution of every im-

And were the friends of free trade to say to  
their constituents:  
&quot;This is is the picture of your country&quot;  
using the language of the Federalist, at a  
time when the Confederated States found  
themselves in precisely the same situation as  
the present Government  
&quot;We may, indeed, with propriety, be said  
to have reached almost the last stage of na­  
tional humiliation. There is scarcely any  
thing that can wound the pride, or degrase  
the character, of an independent people, which  
we do not experience. Are there engage­  
ments, to the performance of which we are  
held by avery tie respectable among men?  
These are subjects of constant and unblushin  
violation. Do we owe debts contracted for  
the preservation of our political institutions!  
These remain without any proper or satisfac­  
tory provision for their discharge. Have we  
valuable territories for the possessiop-of a fo­  
reign power? These are still retained, to the  
prejudice of our interest, not less than of our  
rights. Are we in a position to resent or re­  
pel the aggression? We have neither troops,  
er treasir, nor government. is credit an  
nor treasury, nor government.

with  
poor  
in  
its  
in  
and  
indispensable resource in time of public dan­  
ger? We seem to have abandoned its cause  
as desperate and irretrievable. Is commerce  
of importance to national wealth? Ours is at  
the lowest point of declension. Is a violent  
and unnatural decrease in the value of land,  
a symptom of national distress? The price  
of improved land, in most parts of the country,  
is much lower than can be accounted for by  
the quantity of waste land in market; and can  
only be fully explained by the want of private  
and public confidence, which are so alarming­  
ly prevalent among all ranks, and which have  
a direct tendency to depreciate property of ev­  
ery kind. Is private credit the friend and pa­  
tron of industry? The most useful kind,  
which relates to borrowing and lending, is re­  
duced within the aarrowest limits; and this,  
still more from an opinion of insecurity than  
from a scarcity of money. To shorten the  
enumeration of particulars, which can afford  
neither pleasure nor instruction, it may, in  
general, be demanded, what indication of na­  
tional disorder, poverty and insignificance,  
that could befal a community, so peculiarly  
blessed with natural advantages, as we are,  
which does not form part of the dark catalogue  
of our public misfortunes

the United States, soon after the close of the War  
of Independence, that the Government, as it was then  
composed, was too weak to sustain itself, and, if  
not strengthened by the process of a reorganiza­  
tion, must fall.to pieces, and leave the States and  
the People to be the prey of wild anarchy, with a  
probable certainty of civil war.  
The cause of this imbecility in the Government  
was the absence of any authority in Congress to  
enforce its acts but through the agency of the  
State Governments, and that agency a voluntary  
one merely. The United States, as then constitu­  
ted, had an indefinite discretion to make requisitions  
upon the States for men and money, but had no  
authority to raise either the one or the other by  
regulations extending to the individual citizens of  
the country. The consequence of which was,  
that though, in theory, the resolutions of  
Congress concerning those objects . were laws!!,  
constitutionally binding on the members of the  
Union, yet in practice they were mere recom­  
mendations, which the States obeyed or disregarded  
at their option. The concurrence of as many dis­  
tinct wills as there were States in the Confede­  
ration was requisite to the complete execution  
of every important public measure that proceed­  
ed from the Union. The result of all this was?  
as might well be imagined, had we not direct  
testimony to the fact?that the measures of the  
Union were not executed: &quot; the delinquencies of  
the States had, step by step, matured themselves to  
an extreme which had at length arrested all the  
wheels of the National Government, and brought  
them to an awful stand.&quot; The greater deficiencies  
of some States furnished the pretext of example  
and the temptation of interest to other States.  
&quot; Why should we do more (said they) in propor­  
tion than those who are embarked with us in the  
same political voyage ? Why should we consent  
to bear more than our proper share in the common  
burdens?&quot; &quot;These were suggestions,&quot; says the  
high authority from which we quote, 41 which hu­  
man selfishness could not withstand. Each State,  
yielding to the persuasive voice of immediate inte­  
rest or convenience, successively withdrew its sup­  
port, till (says our author) the frail and tottering  
edifice seemed ready to fall upon our heads and to  
crush us beneath its ruins !

&quot; There is nothing absurd or impracticable in the idea of a 1  
league or alliance between independent nations, for certain 1  
defined purposes precisely stated in a treaty , regulating all (  
the details of time, place, circumstance, and quantity, leaving &#x27;  
nothing to future discretion, and depending for its execution 1  
on the good faith of the parties. Compacts of this kind exist &#x27;  
smmg all civilized nations, subject to the usual vicissitudes &#x27;  
of peace and war, of observance and non-observance, as the &#x27;  
interests or passions of the contracting powers dictate. &#x27;  
&quot; If the particular States in this country are disposed to &#x27;  
stand in a similar relation to each other, and to drop the pro- &#x27;  
ject of a general discretionary superintendence, the scheme 1  
would indeed be pernicious, and would entail upon us all the  
mischiefs which have been enumerated under the fiMt head ;  
but it would have the merit of being at least consistent and  
practicable. Abandoning all views towards a confederate  
Government, this would bring us to a simple alliance, offen- i  
?ive and defensive, and would place us in a situation to be  
alternately friends and enemies of each other, as our mutual  
jealousies and rivalships, nourished by the intrigues of for­  
eign nations, should prescribe to us. But if we an unwil­  
ling to be placed in this perilous situation $ if we still adhere

reign States, that it was the existence of this  
very bower, under the articles of confedera  
tion, which chiefly paralyzed the Government they creat.­  
ed. I might enlarge, sir, upon this subject, with benefit  
to the argument. But I refrain. The temper of the  
  
House does not justify it, nor will my remarks materially  
suffer by the omission. I cannot omit, however, to press  
into my service the controlling authority of Hamilton,  
directed specifically to this very point. He says,  
in the fifteenth number of the Federalist  
&quot;Government implies the power of making laws. It is  
essential to the idea of a law, that it be attended with a  
sanctien, or, in other words, a penalty or punishment for  
disobedience. If there be no penalty annexed to dis.­  
obedience, the resolutions or commands which pretend  
to be laws, will in fact amount to nothing more than ade­  
vice or recommendation. This penalty, whatever it may  
be can only be inflicted in two ways: by the agency of the  
courts and ministers of justice, or by milltary force; by  
the coercion of the magistracy, or by the coercion of  
arms. The first kind can evidently apply only to men;  
the last kind must of neceesity be employed against  
bodies politic, or communities or States. It is evident  
that there is no process of a court by which their obsery­  
ance of the laws can, in the last resort, be enforced.  
Sentences may be denounced against them for violations  
of their duty, but these sentences can only be carried  
into execution by the sword. In an association, where  
the general authority is confined to the collective bodles  
of the communities that compose it, every breach of the  
laws must involve a state of war, and military execution  
must become the only instrument of civilobedience. Such  
a state of things can, certainly, not deserve the name of  
government, nor would any prudent man choose to com  
mit his happiness to it.&quot; Again, he proceeds inthe six  
teenth number of the referalast to say that &quot;The

&quot;It is true, as has been before observed, that facts  
  
too stubborn to be resisted, have produced a species  
of general assent to the abstract proposition, that  
there exist material defects in our national system;  
but the usefulness of the concession on the part ef  
  
the old adversaries of Federal measures, is destroy­  
ed by a strenuous opposition to a remedy, upon the  
only principles that con give it a chance of success.  
While they admit that the Government of the Uni­  
ted States is destitute of energy, they contend  
  
against conferring upon it those powers which are  
requisite to supply that energy. They seem still to  
aim at things repugnant and irreconcilable; at an  
  
augmentation of Federal authority; without dimi  
nution of State authority; at sovereignty  
in the Union, and complete independence in the  
  
embers. They still, in fine, seem to cherish with  
  
blind devotion the political monster of an imperium  
in imperio. This rexders a full display of the prin-  
  
cipol defects of the confederation necessary, in or­  
der to show that the evils we experience do not pro­  
ceed from minute or partial imperfections, but from  
fundamental errors in the structure of the building,  
which cannot be amended otherwise than by altera­  
tion in the very elements and main pillars of the fa  
  
bric. The gread and radical vice, in the Construction  
of the existing confederation, is in the principal of le­  
gistation, for States or Governments in theircorporateor  
collective capacities and as contra-distinguished from  
the individuals of whom they consist Though this prin­  
cipal does not run through all the powers delegated  
to the Union; yet it pervades and governs those on  
which the efficaey of the rest depends; except, as.  
  
to the rule of apportionment, the United States have  
an indefinite direction to make acquisitions for men  
and money; but they have no authority to raise  
either, by regulations extending to the individual  
  
citizens of America. The consequence of this is,  
  
that, though in theory their resolutions concerning  
  
those objects are laws, constitutionally binding on  
  
the members of the Union; yet in practice, they are  
  
mere commendations, which the the States observe

this principle does not run through all the powers delegated

The great and radical vice in the construction of the existing Confeder¬  
ation is in the principle of legislation for states or governments, in their  
corporate or collective cajiacities, and as contradistinguished from the in¬  
dividuals of which they consist. Though this principle does not run  
through all the powers delegated to the Union, yet it pervades and governs  
those on which tlie efficacy of the rest depends. Except as to the rule of  
apportionment, the United States have an indefinite discretion to make  
requisitions for men and money; but they have no authority to raise  
either, by regulations extending to the individual citizens of America.  
The consequence of this is, that, though in theory their resolutions con¬  
cerning those objects are laws constitutionally binding on the members  
of the U uion, yet in practice they are mere recommendations which the  
States observe or disregard at their option.f  
  
The writer proceeds to speak of this principle of governing  
the States in their collective capacities as ‘ evidently incom¬  
patible with the idea of government,’ and as leading inevitably  
to the ‘ violent and sanguinary agency of the sword,’ instead  
of the ‘ mild influence of the magistracy.’ And still furthe

be says : ‘ We must extend the authority of the Union to the  
persons of the citizens—the only proper objects of govern¬  
ment.’ The severe logic and deep political philosophy of the  
next paragraph may be commended to the attention of those  
•who think that the epoch is about to dawn in which shall be  
established ‘the parliament of man, the federation of the  
world.’  
  
Government implies the power of making laws. It is essential to the  
idea of a law that it he attended with a sanction; or, in other words, a  
penalty or punishment for disobedience. If there be no penalty annexed  
to disobedience, the resolutions or commands which pretend to be laws  
will, in fact, amount to nothing more than advice or recommendation.  
This penalty, whatever it may&quot; be, can only be inflicted in two ways : by  
the agency of the Courts and Ministers of Justice, or by military force ;  
by the coercion of the magistracy, or by the coercion of arms. The first  
kind can evidently applj&#x27; only to men, the last kind must, of necessity,  
be employed against bodies politic, or communities, or states. It is  
evident that there is no process of a court by which the observance of the  
laws can, in the last resort, be enforced. Sentences may be denounced  
against them for violations of their duty; but those sentences can be carried  
into execution only by the sw&#x27;ord. In an association where the general  
authority is confined to the collective bodies of the communities that com¬  
pose it, e&#x27;sery breach of the laws must involve a state of war, and military  
execution must become the only instrument of civil obedience. Such a  
state of things can certainly not deserve the name of govei’iiment, nor  
would any prudent man choose to commit his happiness to it.  
  
The history of the United States during this brief period of  
loose confederation, which was happily terminated by the  
adoption of the federal constitution, is simply a forcible an

“Government implies the power of making laws. It is essential  
to the idea of a law that it be attended with a sanction; or, in  
other words, a penalty or punishment for disobedience. If there  
be no penalty annexed to disobedience, the resolutions or com-  
mands which pretend to be laws will, in fact, amount to nothing  
more than advice or recommendation. This penalty, whatever it  
may be, can only be inflicted in two ways: by the agency of the  
Courts and Ministers of Justice, or by military force; by the  
coercion of the magistracy, or by the coercion of arms. The first  
kind can only apply to men; the last kind must of necessity be  
employed against bodies politic, or communities, or States. It is  
evident that there is no process of a.court by which the observance  
of the laws can, in the last resort, be enforced. Sentences can be  
  
  
  
denounced against them for violations of their duty, but these

indefinite discretion to make  
requisitions for men and money ; but  
they have no authority to raise either,

consequence of this is, that though in  
theory their resolutions concerning
