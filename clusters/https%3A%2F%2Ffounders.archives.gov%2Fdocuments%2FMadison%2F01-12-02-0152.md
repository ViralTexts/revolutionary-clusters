To this the objection is that it would make officers of every description hold their places during good behavior, which could have still less been intended. 3. that the power of removal is incident to the power of appointment. To this the objections are that it would require the constant Session of the Senate, that it extends the mixture of Legislative &amp; Executive power, that it destroys the responsibility of the President, by enabling a subordinate Executive officer to intrench himself behind a party in the Senate, and destroys the utility of the Senate in their legislative and Judicial characters, by involving them too much in the h

4 that the Executive power being in general terms vested in the President, all power of an Executive nature, not particularly taken away must belong to that department, that the power of appointment only being expressly taken away, the power of Removal, so far as it is of an Executive nature must be reserved. In support of this construction it is urged that exceptions to general positions are to be taken strictly, and that the axiom relating to the separation of the Legislative &amp; Executive functions ought to be favored. To this are objected the principle on which the 3d. construction is founded, &amp; the danger of creating too much influence in the Executive Magistrate.  
The last opinion has prevailed, but is subject to various modifications, by the power of the Legislature to limit the duration of laws creating offices, or the duration of the appointments for filling them, and by the power over the salaries and appropriations. In truth the Legislative power is of such a nature that it scarcely can be restrained either by the Constitution or by itself. And if the federal Government should lose its proper equilibrium within itself, I am persuaded that the effect will proceed from the Encroachments of the Legislative department. If the possibility of encroachments on the part of the Ex. or the Senate were to be compared, I should pronounce the danger to lie rather in the latter than the former. The mixture of Legislative Executive &amp; Judiciary authorities lodged in that body, justifies such an inference; At the same [time] I am fully in the opinion, that the numerous and immediate

Furthermore, we might make all appointments for a  
term of years fixed by statute, and all oflicers during  
that term,—excepting those whose political opinions  
necessarily have a direct bearing on the administration,  
— irremovable, except for causes previously specified by

administration from involving any general change in the

As it thus appears that the Supervisors had

even when the act creating the office provided  
that. he should; not *be • removed - except for  
cause, why should, the right to remove their

only that the T Supervisors have the power to  
appoint a &#x27; clerk»for j each, of | the four depart­
