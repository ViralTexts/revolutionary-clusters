 Does not the tyrants of America take away the whole of the labour of 2,000000 of the most industerious citizens to riot upon?  
I cannot give you a fairer picture of our unfortunate condition sir, then in the words of Esqr. Pigott. Among men, says he, you see the ninty and nine toyling to git a heep of superfluities for One; gitting nothing for themselves all this while, but a little of the coursests of the provisions which their own labour produces; and this One too, oftentimes  is the worst of the whole set; a child, a woman, a madman or a fool; looking quiettly on while they see the fruits of all their labours spent on spoiled; and if one of them take a single particle of it, the others join against, and hang him for the theft. What say you sir, to this? can you plead ignorance in these vices and follies; and in this inhuman slavery? If not, what can be your reasons (since you have been rais’d to the highest office in

O! merciful God, is this humanity? is this concistant with thy holy law, and agreeable to thy divine will? “But hold my impious toungue, its only Christian Charity.” Its quite good enough for Negroes, who the sainted pilgrims say, are only a black beast of the Manilla class, with a flat nose, thick lips, woolly head, ivory teeth; and with a face somewhat resembling the human, but clearly not a human being. To prove our human-nature, sir, and our rights as citizens of these states, we have only to appeal to the Declaration of Independence, which says, We hold these truths self-evident; that all men, (not all white men) are created equal; that they are endued by their Creator with inherent &amp; unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty &amp; the pursuit of happiness.

. Laws to be just &amp; equitabe, should protect the weak &amp; ignorant, &amp; diffuse blessings upon all with a liberal hand. Just laws give vigor and proportion to every part of the body; but slavery aggrandizes one part of the community at the expence of the other. Under its pernicious influence, the head grows to an enormous size, while the inferior members are impoverished &amp; wither away. Like some fatal disorders, it not only destroys the beauty of the body, but its first &amp; best principles, its sympathy and harmony. Slavery is unjust, because it destroys the rites of women &amp; children. It is a mere state of barberism, in which neither the delicacy and chastity of sex, nor the debility &amp; ignorance of little children are regarded. The situation of the female slave is more deplorable &amp; degrading than that of the untutored savage. For littl

The degree of servitude to which savage women are bound, is trifling in comparison with the task of a female slave; and inasmuch as their husbands &amp; children reap the fruits of their labour, &amp; in some measure repay it by acquireng a superior skill in hunting &amp; war, their labour becomes rather a pleasure than a burden.

With the morals of the people, their industry also is destroy’d; for in a warm climate, no man will labour for himself who can make another labour for him.” This sufficiently proves my assertions, and justifies me in saying, that a majority of the American agents in the Southern States, are a set of inhuman scoundrils, and ought to be tar’d and feather’d and tyed to the tale end of a dung cart, and horse-whipt throughout the country, from state to state, and forever after banished from human society.

It is strange, but not more so than true, says Esqr Pigott, that all nations, without exception, are subject to, and the slaves of some error or superstition which is the fundiment of unhapiness to the people. Experience, knowledge, history, in vain afford them lessons, what path to follow and what to shun. Blinded by the warring passions, and stupified by the love of sensuality they rush on head long into the abys of vice and folly, and think to extricate themselves from these pittfalls by heaping crime upon crime till they find themselves even with the rest of the world, that is, flat on their back, see

Its worthy of remark that a standard of truth is errected by every little tyrant, in every little state and tho’ truth is immutable, she is a very Proteus, deversifying and varigating her m[any] garb in every soil, in every clime, and in every age.

O! rouse, rouse quickly, and snatch your wepons, &amp; unite your strength, &amp; let us banish all tyrants, tyranny and oppression from North America, and let us who surv[ive] the fatal shock, “form but one society, one great family.” “And since human-nature has but one constitution, let there in future (at least in America) exist but one law; that of nature; but one code; that of reason; but one throne; that of justice and but one alter; that of union. Then might the sons and aughters of America set under their vines and fruit-trees, and enjoy the fruits of their labour, and the friendship of the whole human family. Then might they set down in the joy of their hearts and sing with the birds in the following beautiful lines, viz.  
  
Love &amp; Liberty.  
  
1. In bri’ry dell, on thicket brown,  
On mountain high, in lowly vale,  
Or where the thistle sheds its down,  
And sweet-fern sents the passing gale,  
There hops the birds from bush to tree,  
  
 Love fills their throats,  
  
 Love swells their notes,  
Their song is love and Liberty.  
2. No tyrant bird shall love direct,  
  
His fair he seeks in plumy throng,  
Caught by the plumage of her neck,  
Or kindred softness of her song.  
They sing and bill from bush to tree,  
  
 Love fills their throats,  
  
 Love swells their notes,  
Their song is love and Liberty.—  
3. Some airy songster feather’d shape,  
O! could my love &amp; I assume;  
The ring Dove’s glossy neck, he take,  
And I the modest turtle’s plume,  
O! then we’d sport from bush to tree,  
  
 Love fills our throats,  
  
 Love swell our notes  
Our song to love and Liberty.—  
Religion, justice and humanity apart, the slave trade, says Mr. Wilkinson, is an indignity offered to human-nature, that ought to be resented by the whole world.  
“Inquire around, the nations all accord,  
That man is nature’s delegated Lord;  
To lift his lot above the beasts that die,  
His God commission’d Justice from the sky,  
Humanity, &amp; mil’d Religion down,  
His life to govern &amp; his end to crown.  
By these directed &amp; by these approv’d,  
He lives a blessing, &amp; he dies belov’d;  
Earth smiles in peace beneath his righteous hands,  
And heaven for him her joyful gales expands.  
If these neglected, leave their stubborn charge,  
He raves a monster thro’ the world at large;  
Waste marks his way, his feet in blood are dy’d,  
As on he stalks, the slave of lust &amp; pride.

Monopoly advises the farmers and

it will ruin their organizations. But  
for monopoly influence in politics  
there would have been no need of in­

has had a monopoly of politics, and  
labor has been the loser by it. Bet­
