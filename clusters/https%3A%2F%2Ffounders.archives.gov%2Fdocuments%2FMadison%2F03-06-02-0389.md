t if these two Questions had not been united together, the Orders in Council would have been in 1810, Revoked.” Unfortunately for the Peace of our Country, not content with the Revocation of the Orders in Council as dictated by the Law of Congress of May 1810. Mr Pinkney in his Letter to Lord Wellesley of Sep 31st 1810 demands a Repeal not only of the Blockade from Elbe to Brest, but of those of Zealand, and of the Isles of Mauritius and Bourbon. And in his letter of Jany 14th 1811, to the same Minister, he speaks also of other Blockades (including that of the Island of Zealand) which the United States expected to see Recalled, besides the Blockade of May. In this letter he suggests an idea directly calculated, and perhaps designed, to allarm the British Minestry as to the ulterior views of our Government on the subject of Blockade in general, and to discourage them from a compliance with our demand concerning the Blockade of May. He observes—“It is by no means clear that it may not be fairly contended that a Maratime Blockade is incomplete with regard to States at Peace, unless the Place which it would affect is invested by land as well as by sea. The United States however have called for the recognition of no such Rule. They appear to have contented themselves with urging in substance “That Ports not actually Blockaded by a Present adequate Stationary force &amp;c &amp;c.”
