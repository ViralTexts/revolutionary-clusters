Whereas it frequently happens that wicked and dissolute men resigning themselves to the dominion of inordinate passions, commit violations on the lives, liberties and property of others, and, the secure enjoyment of these having principally induced men to enter into society, government would be defective in it’s principal purpose were it not to restrain such criminal acts, by inflicting due punishments on those who perpetrate them; but it appears at the same time equally deducible from the purposes of society that a member thereof, committing an inferior injury, does not wholly forfiet the protection of his fellow citizens, but, after suffering a punishment in proportion to his offence is entitled to their protection from all greater pain, so that it becomes a duty in the legislature to arrange in a proper scale the crimes which it may be   necessary for them to repress, and to adjust thereto a corresponding gradation of punishments.  
And whereas the reformation of offenders, tho’ an object worthy the attention of the laws, is not effected at all by capital punishments, which exterminate instead of reforming, and should be the last melancholy resource against those whose existence is become inconsistent with the safety of their fellow citizens, which also weaken the state by cutting off so many who, if reformed, might be restored sound members to society, who, even under a course of correction, might be rendered useful in various labors for the public, and would be living and long continued spectacles to deter others from committing the like offences.  
And forasmuch the experience of all ages and countries hath shewn that cruel and sanguinary laws defeat their own purpose by engaging the benevolence of mankind to withold prosecutions, to smother testimony, or to listen to it with bias, when, if the punishment were only proportioned to the injury, men would feel it their inclination as well as their duty to see the laws observed.  
For rendering crimes and punishments therefore more proportionate to each other: Be it enacted by the General assembly that no

This commutation however was taken away by Ll.H.1. anno 1108. ‘Si quis in furto vel latrocinio deprehensus fuisset, suspenderetur; sublata wirgildorum, id est, pecuniarae redemptionis lege.’ Larceny is the felonious taking and carrying away of the personal goods of another. 1. As to the taking, the 3.4.W.M.c.9.§.5. is not additional to the Common law, but declaratory of it; because where only the care or use, and not the possession, of things is delivered, to take them was larceny at the Common law. The 33.H. 6.c.1. and 21.H.8.c.7. indeed have added to the Common law, by making it larceny in servants to convert things of his master’s. But qu. if they should be imitated more than other br

whereas, it frequently happens that wicked  
and dissolute men, resigning tbeiiiselvos to  
the dominion of inordinate passions, com-  
mit violations on tbe law.s, liberties, and pro-  
perties of others; and tbe secure enjoyment  
of these having laincipally induced men  
to cuter into society, goveriimcnt would be  
defective in its principal purposes were it not  
to restrain such criminal act.s by inflicting  
due punishment on those who perpetrate  
them; blit it appears, at tbe same time  
equally ilediicable, from tbe purposes of so-  
ciety, that a member thereof, committing an  
inferior injury, does not wholly forfeit tbe  
protection of bis fellow citizens; but after  
sufl&#x27;eriiig punisbnieiit in proportion to bis of-  
fense, is entitled to protection from all great-  
er sntTcrings; so that it becomes tbe duty of  
tbe Legislature to arrangt, in a proper scale,  
the crimes which it may be neces.sary for  
them to repress, and to adjust thereto a cor-  
responding gradation of punishment. And  
wbefea.s, tbe reforinaiion of ort&#x27;enders —  
ah object highly meriting the attention of  
tbe laws— is not cfi&#x27;ecteJ at all by capital  
pniiisbment, which is exterminaeing instead  
of reforming, and should be tbe last melan-  
choly resource against those wbo.se existence

tbe .State by cutting oft’ so many, who, if re-  
formed, might be restored sound members  
of society ; who, even under a course of la-  
bor, might be rendered useful to tbe com-

conlinued examples to deter others from com-  
mitting the like ofTenses; ami, for as much  
as experience, in all ages ami conntrio.s, has  
shown that civil and sanguinary laws defeat  
their own purpose, by engaging tbe benevo-  
lence^of mankind to withhold prosecutions,  
to smotber-tostimony, or to listen to it with  
bins, and by iniroducting, in many instances,  
a total dispensation and immunity, under  
the names of pardon and benefit of clergy,  
and when, if the punisliment were only pro-  
portionable to the ifijitry, men would feel it
