Sir  
  
The Heart which is Concious of its Own rectitude, Cannot attempt to paliate a Step, which the World may Censure as wrong; I have ever acted from a Principle of Love to my Country, since the Commencement of the present unhappy Contest between Great Britain and the Colonies, the same principle of Love to my Country Actuates my present Conduct, however it may appear Inconsistent to the World: who very Seldom Judge right of any Mans Actions.  
I have no favor to ask for myself. I have too often experienced the Ingratitude of my Country to Attempt it: But from the known humanity of your Excellence I am induced to ask your protection For Mrs. Arnold from every Insult and Injury that the mistaken Vengence of my Country may expose Her to: It ought to fall only on me. She is as good, and as Innocent as an Angel, and is Incapable of doing wrong. I beg She may be permitted to return to Her Friends in Philada. or to come to me as She may choose; from your Excellency I have no fears on Her Account, but She may Suffer from the mistaken fury of Her Country.  
I have to request that the Inclosed Letter may be delivered to Mrs. Arnold and She permitted to write to me.  
I have also to Ask that my Cloths &amp; Baggage which are of little Consequence may be Sent to me. If required their Value shall be paid in Money.  
I have the honor to be with great regard &amp; Esteem   Your Excellencys   Most Obedt Hble Servt.  
B Arnold  
His Excelly Genl. Washington.  
NB   In Justice to the gentlemen of my Family Colonel Varick &amp; Major Franks, I think myself in honor bound to declare, that they as well as Joshua Smith Esqr (who I know is suspected) are totally Ignorant of any transactions of mine that they had reason to believe were Injurious to the Public.

Upon discovering who he was, she told  
them how she had deceived General Wash­  
ington, Cola Hamilton, and the other Ameri­  
can officers, by her frantic outcries, and she  
declared that she not only knew of the trea­

This was Colonel Burr&#x27;s story, to which  
the reader may attach the credit which he  
thinks it deserves. Arnold himself, does not  
say that she was ignorant of his intention t  
surrender the fortress. In the well-known  
letter which he sent back to General Wash­  
ington from the Vulture, he says.  
From the known humanity of your excel

that a mistaken vengeance of my country  
may expose her to. It aught to fall on me;  
she is as good and as innocent as an angel,  
and as incapable of doing wrong.&quot;  
The authorities of Pennsylvania, believed,  
with Burr, that she was a traitor. Her pa­  
pers were seized, and although nothing was  
found in them to criminate her, she was not  
ermitted to remain at her father&#x27;s house,  
which she said she desired to do. Her father

she would write no letters to her husband,

from a principle of love to my Country since the  
Commencement of the present unhappy contest

Conduct, however, it may appear inconsistant to

mitted to return to her Friends in Philada., or  
to come to me, as she may choose from your Ex-  
cellency. I have no Fears on her Act’e, but she  
may suffer from the mistaken Fury of the Country.  
I have to request that the enclosed Letter may be
