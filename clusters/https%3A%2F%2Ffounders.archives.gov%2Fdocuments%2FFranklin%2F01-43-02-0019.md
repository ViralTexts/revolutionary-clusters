y dear old Friend,

				I received your kind letter of May 3, 1783. I am ashamed that it has been so long unanswered. The indolence of old age, frequent indisposition, and too much business, are my only excuses. I had great pleasure in reading it, as it informed me of your welfare.

What you have told your brethren respecting America is true. If you find it difficult to dispose of your children in England, it looks as if you had too many people. And yet you are afraid of emigration. A subscription is lately set on foot here to encourage and assist mothers in nursing their infants themselves at home; the practice of sending them to the Enfans Trouvés, having risen here to a monstrous excess, as by the annual bills it appears they amount to near one third of the children born in Paris.

Letters of Dr. Franklin.  
  
Passy*, near Paris,  
Aug. 21, 1784.  
My dear old Friend,  
  
T Received your kind letter of May  
3, 1783. Iam ashamed that it has  
been so long unanswered. The in-  
dolence of old age, frequent indispo-  
sition, and too much business, are  
my only excuses. I had great plea-  
sure in readingit, as it informed me  
of your welfare.  
  
our excellent little work, “* The  
Principles of Trade,” is too little  
known. 1 wish you would send me  
a copy of it by the bearer, my grand-  
‘son and secretary, whom I beg leave  
to recommend to your civilities. I  
would get it translated and printed  
here, and if your bookseller has any  
quantity of them left, I should be  
glad he would send them to America.  
The ideas of our people there, though  
rather better than those that prevail  
in Europe, are not so good as they  
should be; and that piece might be  
of service among them.  
  
Since and soon atter the date of  
your letter, we lost unaccountably as  
well as unfortunately, that worthy,  
valuable young man you mention,  
your namesake Maddeson. He was  
infinitely regretted by all that knew  
him.  
  
Iam sorry your favourite charity  
does not go on as you could wish it.  
It is shrunk indeed by your admitting  
only sixty children in a year. What  
you have told your brethren respect-  
ing America is true. If you find it  
ditticult to dispose of your children in  
England, it looks as if you had too  
many people. And yet you are afraid  
of emigration. A subscription is lately  
set on toot here to encourage and as-  
sist mothers in nursing their infants  
themselves at home ;_ the practice of  
sending them to the Enfans Trouvést,  
having risen here to a monstrous ex-  
cess, as by the annual bill it appears
