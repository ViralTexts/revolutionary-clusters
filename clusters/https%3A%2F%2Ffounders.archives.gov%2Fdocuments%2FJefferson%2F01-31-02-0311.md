I. wide, 16. I. deep, and 3. f. 6. I. high. it resembles when closed the under half of a book case, &amp; may be moved,  by it’s handles, to the fire side. he contrives within that height to give his strings the same length as in the grand fortepiano, and fixes his 3. unisons to the same screw, which screw is in the direction of the strings and therefore never yields. it scarcely gets out of tune at all, &amp; then for the most part the 3. unisons are tuned at once. the price of one with 5. octaves is 200.
