The course consequently has been to contract for provisions at a given Rate ⅌ Ration, and to allow the Contract⟨or⟩ for all other supplies, which he also engages to furnish, a Commission of 5 ⅌ Cent upon his expenditures. This course, it is presumed, must continue to be substantially followed. It is however left to your discretion, except as to the article of provisions, for which the stipulation of a precise rate ⅌ Ration is deemed essential. The Rations to be supplied are to consist of the following Articles—  
One pound of bread or flour,  
One pound of beef or ¾ of a pound of pork,  
Half a gill of Rum, brandy or whiskey  
  
One quart of Salt

The provisions must be furnished upon returns of the principal Officer at each rendezvous, specifying the number of men for whom Rations are required and a receipt upon the Return at each delivery for the number of Rations delivered must be obtained from the same Officer. Should a non-commissioned Officer only be at the rendezvous when any delivery is made, the Commissioned Officer charged with the recruiting service at the place must afterwards examine and certify it. Similar receipts and Certificates must be obtained for all other issues specifying particulars as accurately as the nature of the case admits, and the accounts must finally be settled at the Treasury.
