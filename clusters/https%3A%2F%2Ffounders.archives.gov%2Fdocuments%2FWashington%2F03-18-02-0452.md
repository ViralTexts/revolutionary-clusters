 Harry’s late extra Manœuvre up the North River kept me upon the March, &amp; counter-march, from the 5th till yesterday; when I arrived at these—my quarters for the Winter—&amp; employed too much of my attention to investigate his designs, to endulge in more agreeable amusements.  
What did, or could prompt the Knight to this expedition, is beyond the reach of my conception—considering the unseasonableness of it—Three things only, appeared to me probable; a rescue of the Convention Troops—a stroke at the rear of our Army. Or a surprize of the Posts in the high-lands. The two first I had seen perfectly out of his reach before I left the North River; and not conceiving that he could miss it so much in point of intelligence as to mis-time matters so egregiously (if either of the other two was his object) it followed of consequence that the last must be his aim, and tho’ I had left them (as I thought) in a state of security, and in the hands of a good Officer—McDougall—I could not help being uneasy lest some disaster might befal them; &amp; posted back from Elizabeth town on the Morning of the 5th; and got within 12 or 15 Miles of Kings ferry when I was met by an express informing me, that the Enemy had landed at that place, set fire to two small log’d Houses, destroyed nine Barrls of spoiled herrings, &amp; had set Sail for New York.  
Thus ended this notable expedition, which was conducted (in the preparation) with so much secrecy, that all the Flag Boats to, and from the City were stopped, and not a mouse permitted to creep with in their lines. The only bad consequence we have felt from it (and as the weather has turned out, not a trifling one) is, that it has delayed the Virginia, Maryland, &amp; Pensylvania Troops four days in hutting; and has occasioned them to March throˆ Snow &amp; bad roads to come at their ground, instead of having Sunshine &amp; good ones, which was the case before the storm on thursday last.  
  
  
  
It gives me very sincere pleasure to find that there is likely to be a coalition of the Whigs in your State (a few only excepted) and that the Assembly of it, are so well disposed to second your endeavors in bringing those murderers of our cause—the Monopolizers—forestallers—&amp; Engrossers—to condign punishment. It is much to be lamented that each State, long ’ere this, has not hunted them down as the pests of Society, &amp; the greatest enemies we have, to the happiness of America. I would to God that one of the most attrocious in each State was hung in Gibbets, up on a gallows five times as high as the one prepared by Haman—No punishment, in my opinion, is too great for the Man, who can build “his greatness upon his Country’s ruin.”  
General Lee’s publication in Dunlaps Gazette of the 3d Instt (and I have seen no other) puts me in a disagreeable Situation—I have neither leizure, nor inclination to enter the li

The indignation of Washington was freely expressed. ‘¢ It  
gives me very sincere pleasure,”’ he said, in a letter to his friend  
Reed, ‘‘ to find that the Assembly [of Pennsylvania] i is so well  
disposed to second your endeavours in bringing those murderers  
of our cause, the monopolizers, forestallers, and engrossers, to  
condign punishment. It is much to be lamented, that each  
State long ere this has not hunted them down as pests to  
society, and the greatest enemies we have to the happiness of  
America. No punishment, in my opinion, is too great for the  
man who can build his greatness upon his country’s ruin.”
