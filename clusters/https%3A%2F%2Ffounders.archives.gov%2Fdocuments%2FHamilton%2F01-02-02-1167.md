 we ⟨stand⟩ in need from the disproportion of our national wealth to the expences of the War.  
I hope Sir you will not consider it as a compliment when I assure you that I heard ⟨with⟩ the greatest satisfaction of your nomination ⟨to⟩ the department of finance. In a letter of mine last summer to Mr. Duane, urging among other things the plan of an executive ministry, I mentioned you as the person, who ought to fill that department. I know of no other in America who unites so many advantages, and of course, every impediment to your acceptance is to me a subject of chargine. I flatter my self Congress will not preclude the public from your services by an obstinate refusal of reasonable conditions; and as one deeply interrested in the event I am happy in believing you will not easily be discoureged from undertaking an office, by which you may render America and the world no less a service than the establishment of American independence! Tis by introducing order into our finances—by restoreing public credit—not by gaining battles, that we are finally to gain our object. Tis by putting ourselves in a condition to continue the war not by temporary, violent and unnatural efforts to bring it to a decisive issue, that we shall in reality bring it to a speedy and successful one. In the frankness of truth I believe, Sir, you are the Man best capable of performing this great work.

To surmount these obstacles and give individuals ability and inclination to lend, in any proportion to the wants of government, a plan must be devised, which by incorporating their means together and uniting them with those of the public, will on the foundation of that incorporation and Union, erect a mass of credit that will supply the defect of monied capitals and answer all the purposes of cash, a plan which will offer adventurers immediate advantages analagous to those they receive by employing their money in trade, and eventually greater advantages, a plan which will give them the greatest security the nature of the case will admit for what they lend, and which will not only advance their own interest and secure the independence of their country, but in its progress have the most beneficial influence upon its future commerce and be a source of national strength and wealth.  
I mean the institution of a National Bank. This I regard, in some shape or other as an expedient essential to our safety and success, unless by a happy turn of European affairs the war should speedily terminate in a manner upon which it would be unwise to reckon. There is no other that can give to government that extensive and systematic credit, which the defect of our revenues makes indispensably necessary to its operations. The longer it is delayed, the more difficult it becomes; our affairs grow every day more relaxed and more involved; public credit hastens to a more irretrievable catastrophe; the means for executing the plan are exhausted in partial and temporary efforts. The loan now making in Massachusettes would have gone a great way in establishing the funds on which the bank must stand.  
I am aware of all the objections that have been made to public banks and that they are not without enlightened and respectable opponents. But all that has been said against them only tends to prove that like all other good things they are subject to abuse and when abused become pernicious. The precious metals by similar arguments may be proved to be injurious; it is certain that the mines of South America have had great influence in banishing industry from Spain and sinking it in real wealth and importance. Great power, commerce and riches, or in other words great national prosperity, may in like manner be denominated evils; for they lead to insolence, an inordinate ambition, a vicious luxury, licentiousness of morals, and all those vices which corrupt government, enslave the people and precipitate the ruin of a nation. But no wise statesman will reject the good from an apprehension of the ill. The truth is in human affairs, there is no good, pure and unmixed; every advantage has two sides, and wisdom consists in availing ourselves of the good, and gua[r]ding as much as possible against the bad.  
The tendency of a national bank is to increase public and private credit. The former gives power to the state for the protection of its rights and interests, and the latter facilitates and extends the operations of commerce among individuals. Industry is increased, commodities are multiplied, agriculture and manufactures flourish, and herein consist the true wealth and prosperity of a state.  
Most commercial nations have found it necessary to institute banks and they have proved to be the happiest engines, that ever were invented for advancing trade. Venice Genoa Hamburgh Holland and England are examples of their utility. They owe their riches, commerce and the figure they have made at different periods in a great degree to this source. Great Britain is indebted for the immense efforts she has been able to make in so many illustrious and successful wars essentially to that vast fabric of credit raised on this foundation. Tis by this alone she now menaces our independence.  
She has indeed abused the advantage and now stands on a precipice. Her example should both persuade and warn us. ’Tis in republics where banks are most easily established and supported and where they are least liable to abuse. Our situation will not expose us to frequent wars, and the public will have no temptation to overstrain its credit.  
In my opinion we ought not to hesitate because we have no other resource. The long and expensive wars of King William had drained England of its specie, its commerce began to droop for want of a proper medium, its taxes were unproductive and its revenues declined. The Administration wisely had recourse to the institution of a bank and it relieved the national difficulties. We are in the same and still greater want of a sufficient medium; we have little specie; the paper we have is of small value and rapidly descending to less; we are immersed in a war for our exixtence as a nation, for our liberty and happiness as a people; we have no revenues nor no credit. A bank if practicable is the only thing that can give us either the one or the other.  
Besides these great and cardinal motives to such an institution and the advantages we should enjoy from it in common with other nations our situation relatively to Europe and to the West Indies would give us some peculiar advantages.  
Nothing is more common than for men to pass from the abuse of a good thing to the disuse of it. Some persons disgusted by the depreciation of the money, are chimercial enough to imagine it would be beneficial to abolish all paper credit, annihilate the whole of what is now in circulation and depend altogether upon our specie both for commerce and finance. The scheme is altogether visionary and in the attempt would be fatal. We have not a competent stock of specie in this country, either to answer the purposes of circulation in Trade, or to serve as a basis for revenue. The whole amount of what we have I am persuaded does not exceed six millions of dollars, one fifth of the circulating medium before the war. To suppose this would be sufficient for the operations of commerce would be to suppose that our domestic and foreign commerce were both reduced four fifths, a supposition that carries absurdity in the face of it. It follows that if our paper money were destroyed, a great part of the transactions of traffic must be carried on by barter, a mode inconvenient, partial, confined, distructive both of commerce and industry. With the addition of the paper we now have this evil exists in too great a degree.

.  
The error of those who would explode paper money altogether originates in not making proper distinctions. Our paper was in its nature liable to depreciations, because it had no funds for its support and was not upheld by private credit. The emissions under the resolution of March, 80 have partly the former advantage but are destitute of the latter which is equally essential. No paper credit can be substantial or durable which has not funds and which does not unite immediately the interest and influence of the monied men in its establishment and preservation. A credit begun on this basis will in process of time greatly exceed its funds but this requires time and a well settled opinion in its favour. ’Tis in a National Bank alone that we can find the ingredients to constitute a wholesome, solid and beneficial paper credit.

This calculation supposes the ability of these states for revenue to continue the same as they now are, which is a supposition both false and unfavorable.

many advantages; and, of course, every impediment to your ac-  
ceptance, is to me a subject of chagrin. I flatter myself Congress
