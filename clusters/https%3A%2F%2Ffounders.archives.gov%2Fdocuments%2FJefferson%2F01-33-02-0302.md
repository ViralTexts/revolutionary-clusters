Dear Sir  
Washington Mar. 18. 1801.  
  
Your letters of Oct. 1. 4. 6. 16. came duly to hand, and the papers which they covered were, according to your permission, published in the newspapers &amp; in a pamphlet, &amp; under your own name. these papers contain precisely our principles, &amp; I hope they will be generally recognized here. determined as we are to avoid, if possible, wasting the energies of our people in war &amp; destruction, we shall avoid implicating ourselves with the powers of Europe, even in support of principles which we mean to pursue. they have so many other interests different from ours, that we must avoid being entangled in them. we believe we can enforce those principles as to ourselves by peaceable means, now that we are likely to have our public councils  detached from foreign views. the return of our citizens from the frenzy into which they had been wrought partly by ill-conduct in France, partly by artifices practiced on them, is [almost] entire, &amp; will I believe become quite so. but these details, too [minute &amp;] long for a letter, will be better developed by mr Dawson the bearer [of] this, a member of the late Congress, to whom I refer you for them. [he] goes in the Maryland a sloop of war, which will wait a few days at Havre to recieve his letters to be written on his arrival at Paris. you expressed a wish to get a passage to this country in a public vessel. mr Dawson is charged with orders to the capt. of the Maryland to recieve and accomodate you with a passage back, if you can be ready to depart at such short warning. Rob. R. Livingston is appointed Min. Plen. [to] the republic of France, but will not leave this till we recieve the ratification of the Convention by mr Dawson. I am in hopes you will find us returned generally to sentiments worthy of former times. in these it will be your [glory] to have steadily laboured &amp; with as much effect as any man living. that you may long live to continue your useful labours &amp; to [reap the] rewards in the thankfulness of nations is my sincere prayer. accept assurances of my high esteem &amp; affectionate attachment.

Dear Sib, .

wasting the energies of our people in  
war ambdestruttion, we shall avoid,  
implicating ourselves with the pow

‘* Washington, March 18, 1801.  
“ Dear Sir,  
  
“ Your letters of Octeber Ist, 4th, 6th,  
16th, came duly to hand, and the papers  
which they covered were, according to  
your permission, published in the newspa-  
pers and in a pamphlet, and under your  
own name. ‘These papers contain pre-  
cisely our principles, and I hope they will  
be generally recognized here. Determin-  
ed as we are to avoid, if possible, wasting  
the energies of our people in war and de-  
struction, we shall avoid implicating our-  
selves with the powers of Eurepe, even in  
support of principles which we mean to  
pursue. They have so many other inter-  
ests different from ours that we must a-  
void being entangled ia them. We be-  
lieve we can enforce those principles as to  
ourselves by peaceable means, now that  
we are likely to have our public councils  
detached from foreign views. The return  
of our citizens from the phrenzy into which  
they had been wrought partly by ill con-  
duct in France, partly by artifices practi-  
sed among them, is almost extinet, ana  
will I believe, become quite so. But these  
details, too minute and long for a letter  
will be better developed by Mr. Dawson  
the bearer of this, a member of the late  
Congress, to whom I refer you for them  
He goes in the Maryland sloop of war,  
which will wait a few days at Havre, to  
receive his letter to be written on bis ar-  
rival at Paris. You expressed a wish to  
get a passage to this country in a public  
vessel. Mr. Dawson is charged with or-  
ders to the captain of the Maryland to re-  
ceive and accommodate you back if you  
can be ready to depart at such a short  
warning. Robert R. Livy ngston is ap-  
pointed minister plenipotentiary to the re-  
public of France, but will not leave this,  
until we receive the ratification of the con-  
vention of Mr. Dawson. I am in hopes  
you will find us returned generally to ser-  
timents worthy of former times. In these  
it will be your glory to have steadily le-  
  
If there is sense e- |  
  
  
  
boured, and wih ag titich fect be  
man living. That you may lony live |  
continue your useful Ishors oad ty saa  
the reward in the thankfulness of Mating  
is my sincere prayer. Accept P8SUlaTiCey  
of my high esteem and affectionsty yxy
