Philadelphia, Jan. 7, 1814.  
  
In your favor of 26th November last, you say “that you venture to say that about a third of the people of the Colonies were against the Revolution.” It required much reflection before I could fix my opinion on this subject; but, on mature deliberation, I conclude you are right, and that more than a third of influential characters were against it. The opposition consisted chiefly of the Friends, or Quakers, the Menonists, the Protestant Episcopalians, whose clergy received salaries from the Society for Propagating the Gospel in Foreign Parts, and from the officers of the Crown and Proprietors of Provinces, with their connections, adding the timid and those who believed the Colonies would be conquered, and that of course they would be safe in their persons and property from such conduct, and also have a probability of claiming office and distinction; and also the discontented and capricious of all grades.I have not heard the specific sum of money Mr. C. J. Marshall received for his copyright of the “Life of Washington,” nor have I been able to obtain any certain information concerning it; but, if he obtained a sixth part of what you mention, I think he ought to be contented.During my protracted life, I neither have had leisure or inclination to write a history, and at my present age it is out of the question. It is true I have been often spoken to, and even solicited, by a great many of my learned acquaintance, to undertake that of the American Revolution, beginning at the year 1760 or before: among the, Dr. Rush, your former correspondent, was not the least anxious.Though I shall never write a history, I will give you a historical fact respecting the Declaration of Independence, which may amuse, if not surprise.On the 1st of July, 1776, the question was taken in committee of the whole of Congress, when Pennsylvania, represented by seven members then present, voted against it, four to three. Among the majority were Robert Morris and John Dickinson. Delaware (having only two present, namely, myself and Mr. Read) was divided. All the other States voted in favor of it. The report was delayed until the 4th; and, in the mean time, I sent an express for Cæsar Rodney to Dover, in the County of Kent, in Delaware, at my private expense, whom I met at the State House door, on the 4th of July, in his boots. He resided eighty miles from the city, and just arrived as Congress met. The question was taken. Delaware voted in favor of Independence. Pennsylvania (there being only five members present, Messrs. Dickinson and Morris absent) voted also for it. Messrs. Willing and Humphries were against it. Thus the thirteen States were unanimous in favor of Independence. Notwithstanding this, in the printed public journal of Congress for 1776, Vol. II., it appears that the Declaration of Independence was declared on the 4th of July, 1776, by the gentlemen whose names are there inserted: whereas, no persons signed it on that day; and, among the names there inserted, one gentleman, namely, George Read, Esq., was not in favor of it; and seven were not in Congress on that day, namely, Messrs. Morris, Rush, Clymer, Smith, Taylor, and Ross, all of Pennsylvania, and Mr. Thornton, of New Hampshire; nor were the six gentlemen last named members of Congress on the 4th of July. The five for Pennsylvania were appointed delegates by the convention of that State on the 20th of July, and Mr. Thornton took his seat in Congress, for the first time, on the 4th of November following; when the names of Henry Hinds, of New York, and Thomas McKean, of Delaware, are not printed as subscribers, though both were present in Congress on the 4th of July, and voted for Independence.Here false colors are certainly hung out. There is culpability somewhere. What I have heard as an explanation is as follows: When the Declaration was voted, it was ordered to be engrossed on parchment, and then signed; and that a few days afterwards a Resolution was entered on the secret journal that no person should have a seat in Congress during that year until he should have signed the Declaration of Independence. After the 4th of July, I was not in Congress for several months, having marched with a regiment of Associators, as Colonel, to support General Washington, until the flying camp of ten thousand men was completed. When the Associators were discharged, I returned to Philadelphia, took my seat in Congress, and signed my name to the Declaration on parchment. This transaction should be truly stated, and the then secret journal should be made public. In the manuscript journal, Mr. Pickering, then Secretary of State, and myself, saw a printed half-sheet of paper, with the names of the members afterwards in the printed journals stitched in. We examined the parchment, where my name is signed in my own handwriting.A glimmering of peace appears in the horizon. May it be realized. But every preparation should be made for a continuance of the war. When the British arms have been successful, I have never found their rulers or ministers otherwise than haughty, rude, imperious, nay, insolent. They and their allies have this year been successful, both in the north and south of Europe.My sight fades very fast, though my writing may not discover it.God bless you.

Though I shall never write a history; I will

On the 1st of July, 1776, the question was taken

question was taken: Delaware voted in favor  
of independence: Pennsylvania (there being  
only five members present, Messrs. Dicken-  
son and Morris absent) voted also for it: Messrs.  
Willing and, Humphrics were against it. Thus  
the thirteen states were unanimous in favor of  
independence. Notwithstanding this, in the print-  
ed public journal of congress for 1776, volume 2,  
it appears that the declaration of independence  
was declared on the 4th of July, 1776, by the gen-  
  
  
  
[No. 5. Vor. ty,  
  
George Reed, esquire, was not in favor of it; and  
seven were not in congress on that day, namely,  
Messrs. Morris, Rush, Climer, Smith, Taylor, and  
Ross, all of Pennsylvania, and Mr. Thornton, of  
New-Hampshire; nor were the six gentlemen  
last named, members of congress on the 4th of  
July. The five for: Pennsylvania. were appoiat-  
ed delegates by the convention of ‘that state  
on the twentieth of July, and Mr. Thornton  
took his seat in congress, for the first time, on the  
fourth of November following : when the names  
of Henry Wilmer, of New-York, and Thomas  
M‘Kean, of Delaware, are not printed as subscri-  
bers, though both were present in congress on  
the 4th of July, and voted for independence.  
Here false colors are certainly hung out ; there  
is culpability somewhere ; what I have heard as

; the 4th of July, I was not in Congress for several  
  
  
  
i, months, having marched with a regiment of asso-  
  
ciators, as colonel, to support general Washing-  
ton, until the flying ee of ten thousand men  
was completed... When the associators were dis-  
charged, I returned to Philadelphia, took my  
seat in Congress, and signed’my name to the de-  
claration on parchment. ‘This transaction should  
be truly stated, and the then secret journal should  
be made public. In the manuscript journal, Mr.

same effect. The state of Pennsylvania on the 4th  
of July (there being only five members present,  
Messrs. Dickinson and Morris, who had in the com-  
mittee of the whole voted against independence were  
absent) voted for it; three to two, Messrs.*Willing  
and Humphries in the negative. Unanimity in the  
thirteen states, an all important point on so great  
an occasion, was thus obtained; the dissention of g  
single state might have produced very dangerous  
consequences.  
  
Now, that I am on this subject, J will tell you some  
truths, not generally known. Inthe printed public  
journal of congress for 1776, vol. 2, it would appear,  
that the Declaration of Independence was signed on  
the 4th of July by the members, whose names are  
there inserted; but the fact is not so, for no person  
signed it on that day nor for many days after, and  
among the names subscribed, one was against it,  
Mr. Read, and seven were not in congress on that  
day, namely, Messrs. Morris, Rush, Clymer, Smith,  
Taylor and Ross of Pennsylvania, and Mr. Thornton  
of New Hamphshire; nor were the six gentleman  
last named at that time members; the five for Penn-  
sylvania were appointed delegates by the convention  
of that state on the 20th July, and Mr. Thornton en-  
tered congress for the first time on the 4th of No-  
vember following: when the names of Henry Wisner  
of New York, and Thomas McKean of Delaware  
are not printed as subscribers, tho’ both were pre-  
sent and voted for independence.  
  
Here false colors are certainly hung out; there is  
culpability somewhere. What I canofler as an apo-  
logy or explanation is, that on the 4th of July 1776,  
the Declaration of Independence was ordered to be  
engrossed on parchment and then to be signed, and |  
have been told, that a resolve had passed a few days

I recollect what passed in congress in the begin-  
ning of July 1776 respecting independence; it was  
not as you have conceived. On Monday the Ist of  
the July the question was taken in the committee of  
the whole, when the state of Pennsylvania (repre-  
sented by seven gentlemen then present) voted  
against it; Delaware, (having then only two repre-  
sentatives present) was divided: all ihe other states  
voted in favor of it. Whereupon, without delay, |  
sent an express (at my private expense) for your ho-  
nored uncie, Cesar Kodney, esquire, the remaining

his boots and spurs, as the  
members were assembling; after a friendly saluta  
tion (without a word on the business) we went in­  
to the Hall of Congress together, and found we  
were among the latest: proceedings immediately  
commenced, and after a few minutes the great  
question was put: when the vote for Delaware wa  
called, your uncle arose and said: &quot;As I believe  
the voice of my constituents and of all sen-ible and  
honest men is in favor of Independence, and my  
own judgment concurs with them, I vote for In­  
dependence:&quot; or in words to the same effect. The  
State of Pennsylvania on the 4th of July (there be  
ing only five members present, Messrs. Dickenson  
aud Morris, who had in the committee of the whole  
voted against Independence, were absent) voted for  
it: three or two, Messrs, Willing and Humphries in

thus obtained: the dissention of a single State

Now, that I am on this subject, I will tell you  
some truths, not generaily known. In the printed  
public Journal of Congress for 1776, vol.2., it  
would appear, that the Declaration of Independence  
was signed on the 4th of July by the members,  
whose names are there inserted; but the fact is not  
so, for no person signed it on that day nor for ma  
ny days after, and among the names subscribed, one  
was against it, Mr. Read, and seven were not in  
Congress on that day, viz: Messrs. Morris, Rush,  
Clymer, Smith, Taylor and Ross of Pennsylvania,  
and Mr. Thornton of New Hamp shire, nor were the  
six gentlemen last named at that time members:  
the five for Pennsylvania were appointed Delegate  
by the convention of that State on the 20th July,  
and Mr. Thornton entered Congress for the first  
time on the 4th of November following, when the  
names of Henry Wisner of N. York, and Thom  
as M&#x27;Kean of Delaware are not printed as sub  
scribers, though both were present and voted for In  
dependence.  
Here false colors are certainly hung out; there

apology or explanation is, that on the 4th of July,  
1776, the Declaration of Independence was order  
ed to be enrolled on parchment and then to be  
signed, and I have been told, that a resolve had  
passed a few days after and was entered on the se

and recounted how Rodney&#x27;s timely ar­  
rival at Independence Hall on July 4,  
1776, after having ridden hard and fast  
all the way from Dover, had prevented  
the dangerous consequences that might  
have attended the dissection of a single

the following interesting fashion:

ad a hitherto unpublished letter  
from Thomas McKean to Caesar Augustus  
Rodney, nephew of Caesar Rodney. It was  
dated Aug. 22,1813, audrecoun el how Rod­  
ney’s timely arrival at I dependence Hall  
on July 4. 1776, after having ridden bard  
and fast all the wav from Dover, bad pre­  
vented the dangerous consequences that  
might h ve attended the dissension of a  
si gle state, and had iu fact saved thi  
declaration of indepen lenci from being  
tabled or postponed. Tne letter continue!  
in the foil iwing interesting fashion:  
“Now that I am on this subject, I will  
tell you s .me truths not generally known.  
In the printed public journal of congress  
for 1776, volume 2, it would appear that  
tha Declaration of Independence was signed  
on July 4 by the members whose names a:e  
there inserted, but the fact is not so; for no  
person signed it on that day, nor for many  
days after, and among tne names sub­  
scribed one was against it—Mr. Read—aud  
seven were not iu congress on that day,  
namely: M ssrs. Morris, ijjnsh, Clymer,  
Smith, Taylor ad Ross of Pennsylvania,and  
Mr. Thornton of New Hampshire, nor were  
the s.x gentlemen last named at that time  
members; the five for Pennsylvania were  
appointed delegates by the convention of  
that state on July 20, and Mr. Thornton

4 following, when the names of Henry  
Wisner of New York and Thomas McKean  
cf Delaware, not printed as subscribers,  
though both were present and voted for in­  
dependence. Here false colors are certainly  
hung out; there is culpability somewhere.  
What I can offer as an apology or explana­

of independence was ordered to be en­

a meaning which it still retained in constitutional law—the
