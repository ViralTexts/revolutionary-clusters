. The present calamity seems to be nothing more nor less, than reviving the plans of Mr. Bernard and the junto, and Mr. Grenville and his friends in 1764. Surely this party, are and have been rather unpopular. The popular party did not write Bernard’s letters, who so long ago pressed for the demolition of all the charters upon the continent, and a parliamentary taxation to support government and the administration of justice in America. The popular party did not write Oliver’s letters who inforces Bernard’s plans, nor Hutchinson’s, who pleads with all his eloquence and pathos for parliamentary penalties, ministerial vengeance, and an abridgement of English liberties.  
There is not in human nature a more wonderful phaenomenon; nor in the whole theory of it, a more intricate speculation; than the shiftings, turnings, windings and evasions of a guilty conscience. Such is our unalterable moral constitution, that an internal inclination to do wrong, is criminal: and a wicked thought, stains the mind with guilt, and makes it tingle with pain. Hence it comes to pass that the guilty mind, can never bear to think that its guilt is known to God or man, no, nor to itself.

Massachusettensis and his friends the tories, are startled at the calamities they have brought upon their country, and their conscious guilt, their smarting, wounded minds, will not suffer them to confess, even to themselves what they have done. Their silly denials of their own share in it before a people who they know have abundant evidence

d and ridiculous attempts of the tories, to throw off the blame of these calamities from themselves to the whigs, remind me of another story which I have read in the old testament. When Joseph’s brethren had sold him to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver, in order to conceal their own avarice, malice, and envy, they dip the coat of many colours in the blood of a Kid, and say that an evil beast had rent him in pieces and devoured him.  
However, what the sons of Israel intended for ruin to Joseph, proved the salvation of the family; and I hope and believe that the whigs, will have the magnanimity, like him, to suppress their resentment, and the felicity of saving their ungrateful brothers.  
This writer has a faculty of insinuating errors into the mind, almost imperceptibly, he dresses them so in the guise of truth. He says “that the revenue to the crown from America, amounted to but little more than the charges of collecting it,” at the close of the last war. I believe it did not amount to so much. The truth is, there was never any pretence of raising a revenue in America before that time, and when the claim was first set up, it gave no alarm, like a warlike expedition against us. True it is that some duties had been laid before by parliament, under pretence of regulating our trade, and by a collusion and combination between the West India planters and the North-American governors, some years before duties had been laid upon molasses, &amp;c. under the same pretence, but in reality merely to advance the value of the estates of the planters in the West India islands, and to put some plunder, under the name of thirds of seisures into the pockets of the governors. But these duties tho’ more had been collected in this province than in any other in proportion, were never regularly collected in any of the colonies. So that the idea of an American revenue for one purpose or another had never, at this time, been formed in American minds.  
Our writer goes on, “She Great-Britain tho’t it as reasonable that the colonies should bear a part of the national burthen, as that they should share in the national benefit.”  
Upon this subject Americans have a great deal to say. The national debt before the last war was near an hundred millions. Surely America had no share in running into that debt. Where is the reason then that she should pay it? But a small part of the sixty millions spent in the last war, was for her benefit. Did not she bear her full share of the burden of the last war in America? Did not this province pay twelve shillings in the pound in taxes for the support of it: and send a sixth or seventh part of her sons into actual service? And at the conclusion of the war, was she not left half a million sterling in debt? Did not all the rest of New-England exert itself in proportion? What is the reason that the Massachusetts has paid its debt, and the British minister in thirteen years of peace has paid none of his? Much of it might have been paid in this time, had not such extravagance and peculation prevailed as ought to be an eternal warning to America, never to trust such a minister with her money. What is the reason that the great and necessary virtues of simplicity, frugality and oeconomy, cannot live in England, Scotland and Ireland, as well as America?  
We have much more to say still. Great Britain has confined all our trade to herself. We are willing she should, as far as it can be for the good of the empire. But we say that we ought to be allowed as credit, in the account of public burdens and expences, so much paid in taxes, as we are obliged to sell our commodities to her cheaper than we could get for them at foreign markets. This difference is really a tax upon us, for the good of the empire. We are obliged to take from Great-Britain, commodities that we could purchase cheaper elsewhere. This difference is a tax upon us for the good of the empire. We submit to this chearfully, but insist that we ought to have credit for it, in the account of the expences of the empire, because it is really a tax upon us. Another thing. I will venture a bold assertion. Let Massachusettensis or any other friend of the minister, confute me. The three million Americans, by the tax aforesaid upon what they are obliged to export to Great-Britain only, what they are obliged to import from Great-Britain only, and the quantities of British manufactures which in these climates they are obliged to consume, more than the like number of people in any part of the three kingdoms, ultimately pay more of the taxes and duties that are apparently paid in Great-Britain, than any three million subjects in the three kingdoms. All this may be computed and reduced to stubborn figures, by the minister, if he pleases. We cannot do it. We have not the accounts, records, &amp;c. Now let this account be fairly stated, and I will engage for America, upon any penalty, that she will pay the overplus, if any, in her own constitutional way, provided it is to be applied for national purposes, as paying off the national debt, maintaining the fleet, &amp;c. not to the support of a standing army in time of peace, placemen, pensioners, &amp;c.  
Besides, every farthing of expence which has been incurred on pretence of protecting, defending and securing America since the last war, has been worse than thrown away, it has been applied to do mischief. Keeping an army in America has been nothing but a public nuisance.  
Furthermore, we see that all the public money that is raised here, and have reason to believe all that will or can be raised, will be applied not for public purposes, national or provincial, but merely to corrupt the sons of America, and create a faction to destroy its interest and happiness.

make it pass for truth. He says “the idea, that the stamps were a tax, not only exceeding our proportion, but beyond our utmost ability to pay, united the colonies generally in opposing it.” That we thought it beyond our proportion and ability is true, but it was not this thought which united the colonies in opposing it. When he says that at first we did not dream of denying the authority of parliament to tax us, much less to legislate for us, he discovers plainly either a total inattention to the sentiments of America at that time, or a disregard of what he affirms.  
The truth is, the authority of parliament was never generally acknowledged in America. More than a century since, the Massachusetts and Virginia, both protested against even the act of navigation and refused obedience, for this very reason, because they were not represented in parliament and were therefore not bound—and afterwards confirmed it by their own provincial authority. And from that time to this, the general sense of the colonies has been, that the authority of parliament was confined to the regulation of trade, and did not extend to taxation or internal legisl

nt had such a right at that time. The house of representatives, at that time, gave their approbation to Mr. Otis’s Rights of the Colonies, &amp;c. in which it was shewn to be inconsistent with the Right of British Subjects to be taxed, but by our own Representatives. In 1765, our house expressly resolved against the right of parliament to tax us. The Congress at New-York, resolved 3. “That it is inseparably essential to the freedom of a people, and the undoubted right of Englishmen, that no tax be imposed on them, but with their own consent given personally, or by their representatives, 4. That the people of the colonies are not, and from their local circumstances cannot be represented in the house of Commons of Great-Britain. 5. That the only representatives of the people of the colonies, are the persons chosen therein by themselves; and that no taxes ever have been, or can be constitutionally imposed on them, but by their respective legislatures.” Is it not a striking disregard to truth in the artful Massachusettensis to say, that at first we did not dream of denying the right of parliament to tax us? It was the principle that united the colonies to oppose it, not the quantum of the tax. Did

uthority in our internal concerns.  
This writer says, acts of parliament for regulating our internal polity were familiar. This I deny. So far otherwise that the hatter’s act was never regarded—the act to destroy the Land Bank Scheme raised a greater ferment in this province, than the Stamp-Act did, which was appeased only by passing province laws directly in opposition to it. The act against slitting mills, and tilt-hammers, never was executed here. As to the postage, it was so useful a regulation, so few persons paid it, and they found such a benefit by it, that little opposition was made to it: yet every man who thought about it, call’d it an usurpation. Duties for regulating trade we paid, because we thought it just and necessary that they should regulate the trade which their power protected. As for duties for a revenue,

of the colonies, concerning the right of parliament to make that act. They expressed the universal opinion of the continent at that time, and the alacrity with which every other colony, and the Congress at New-York, adopted the same sentiment in similar resolves, proves the entire union of the colonies in it, and their universal determination to avow and support it.  
What follows here, that it became so popular that his life was in danger, who suggested the contrary? And that the Press was open to one side only, are direct misrepresentations and wicked calumnies.  
Then we are told, by this sincere writer, that when we obtained a partial repeal of the statute imposing duties on glass, paper and teas, this was the lucky moment, when to have closed the dispute. What? With a Board

government, and all the qualification that was required.  
The Tories, says he, were for closing the controversy. That is, they were for contending no more, and it was equally true that they never were for contending at all, but lying at mercy. It was the very end they had aimed at from the beginning. They had now got the Governor’s salary out of the revenue—a number of pensions and places, and they knew they could at any time get the judges salaries from the same fountain, and they wanted to get the people reconcil’d and familiarised to this, before they went upon any new projects.  
The Whigs were averse to restoring government, they even refused to revive a temporary riot act, which expired about this time. Government had as much vigour then as ever, excepting only in those cases which affected this dispute: The riot act expired in 1770, immediately after the Massacre in King Street. It was not revived and never will be in this colony, nor will any one ever be made in any other, while a standing army is illegally posted here, to butcher the people, whenever a governor, or a magistrate, who may be a tool, shall order it. “Perhaps the Whigs tho’t that mobs were a necessary ingredient in their system of opposition.” Whether they did or no, it is certain that mobs have been thought a necessary ingredient by the tories in their system of administration, mobs of the worst sort with red coats, fusees and bayonets, and the lives and limbs of the whigs have been in greater danger from these than ever the tories were from others.  
“The scheme of the whigs flattered the people with the idea of independence; the tories plan supposed a degree of subordination.” This is artful enough as usual, not say Jesuitical. The word independence is one of those, which this writer uses as he does treason and rebellion to impose upon the undistinguishing on both sides of the Atlantic. But let us take him to pieces. What does he mean by independence! Does he mean independent of the crown of Great-Britain, and an independent republic in America, or a confederation of independent republics? No doubt he intended the undistinguishing should understand him so. If he did, nothing can be more wicked, or a greater slander on the whigs, because he knows there is not a man in the province among the whigs, nor ever was, who harbours a wish of that sort. Does he mean that the people were flattered with the idea of total independence on parliament? If

ation.” The whigs acknowledge a subordination to the king, in as strict and strong a sense as the tories. The whigs acknowledge a voluntary subordination to parliament, as far as the regulation of trade. What degree of subordination then do the tories acknowledge?

.  
“The whigs were sensible that there was no oppression that could be seen or felt.” The tories have so often said and wrote this to one another, that I sometimes suspect they believe it to be true. But it is quite otherwise. The castle of the province was taken out of their hands and garrisoned by regular soldiers; this they could see, and they thought it indicated an hostile intention and disposition towards them. They continually paid their money to collectors of duties, this they could both see and feel. An host of placemen, whose whole business it was to collect a revenue, were continually rolling before them in their chariots. These they saw. Their governor was no longer paid by themselves according to their charter, but out of the new revenue, in order to render their assemblies useless and indeed contemptible. The judges salaries were threatned every day to be paid in the same unconstitutional manner. The dullest eyesight could not but see to what all this tended, viz. to prepare the way for greater innovations and oppressions. They knew a minister would never spend his money in this way, if he had not some end to answer by it. Another thing they both saw and felt. Every man, of every character, who by voting, writing, speaking, or otherwise, had favoured the stamp act, the tea act, and every other measure of a minister or governor, who they knew was aiming at the destruction of their form of government, and introducing parliamentary taxation, was uniformly, in some department or other, promoted to some place of honour and profit for ten years together; and on the other hand, every man who favoured the people in their opposition to those innovations, was depressed, degraded and persecuted as far as it was in the power of the government to do it.  
This they considered as a systematical means of encouraging every man of abilities to espouse the cause of parliamentary taxation, and the plan of destroying their charter privileges, and to discourage all from exerting themselves, in opposition to them. This they thought a plan to enslave them, for they uniformly think that the destruction of their charter, making the council and judges wholly dependent on the crown, and the people subject to the unlimited power of parliament as their supreme legislative, is slavery. They were certainly rightly told then that the ministry and their governors together had formed a design to enslave them, and that when once this was done, they had the highest reason to expect window taxes, hearth taxes, land taxes and all others. And that these were only paving the way for reducing the country to lordships.—Were the people mistaken in these suspicions? Is it not now certain that Governor Bernard in 1769 had formed a design of this sort? Read his principles of polity. And that Lt. Governor Oliver as late as 1768 or 9 inforced the same plan? Read his letters.  
Now if Massachusettensis will be ingenuous, avow this design, shew the people its utility, and that it ought to be done by parliament, he will act the part of an honest man. But to insinuate that there was no such plan, when he knows there was, is acting the part of one of the junto.  
It is true that the people of this country in general, and of this province in special, have an hereditary apprehension of and aversion to lordships temporal and spiritual. Their ancestors fled to this wilderness to avoid them—they suffer’d sufficiently under them in England. And there are few of the present generation who have not been warned of the danger of them by their fathers or grandfathers, and injoined to oppose them.

as, he did them great injustice. Every one that I know of that character, has been thro’ the whole tempestuous period, as indefatigable as human nature will admit, going about seeking whom he might devour, making use of art, flattery, terror, temptation and alurement, in every shape in which human wit could dress it up, in public and private. But all to no purpose. The people have grown more and more weary of them every day, untill now the land mourns under them.  
Massachusettensis is then seized with a violent fit of anger at the clergy. It is curious to observe the conduct of the Tories towards this sacred body. If a clergyman preaches against the principles of the revolution, and tells the people that upon pain of damnation they must submit to an established government of whatever character, the Tories cry him up as an excellent man, and a wonderful preacher, invite him to their tables, procure him missions from the society, and chaplainships to the navy, and flatter him with the hopes of lawn sleeves. But if a clergyman preaches Christianity, and tells the magistrates that they were not distinguished from their brethren for their private emolument, but for the good of the people, that the people are bound in conscience to obey a good government, but are not bound to submit to one that aims at destroying all the ends of government— Oh Sedition! Treason!  
The clergy in all ages and countries, and in this in particular, are disposed enough to be on the side of government, as long as it is tolerable: If they have not been generally in the late administrations on that side, it is demonstration that the late administration has been universally odious.  
The clergy of this province are a virtuous, sensible and learned set of men, and they don’t take their sermons from newspapers but the bible, unless it be a few who preach passive obedience. These are not generally curious enough to read Hobbs.  
It is the duty of the clergy to accommodate their discourses to the times, to preach against such sins as are most prevalent, and recommend such virtues as are most wanted. For example, if exorbitant ambition, and venality are predominant, ought they not to warn their hearers against these vices? If public spirit is much wanted, should they not inculcate this great virtue? If the rights and duties of christian magistrates and subjects are disputed, should they not explain them, shew their nature, ends, limitations and restrictions, how much soever it may move the gall of Massachusettensis?  
Let me put a supposition. Justice is a great christian as well as moral duty and virtue, which the clergy ought to inculcate and explain. Suppose a great man of a parish should for seven years together receive 600 sterling a year, for discharging the duties of an important office; but during the whole time, should never do one act or take one step about it. Would not this be great injustice to the public? And ought not the parson of that parish to cry aloud and spare not, and shew such a bold transgressor his sin? Shew that justice was due to the public as well as to an individual, and that cheating the public of four thousand two hundred pounds sterling, is at least as great a sin as taking a chicken from a private hen roost, or perhaps a watch from a fob!

Tas ftill ridiculous attempts of the Tories,  
to throw off the blame of our calannties from  
themſelves to the Whigs, remind me of the  
ſtory in the Old Teſtament :--When Joſeph&#x27;s  
brethren had ſold him to the Iſhmaelites for  
twenty pieces of ſilver, in order to conceal their  
own avarice, malice, and envy, they dip the  
coat.of many colours in the blood of a kid, and  
ſay that an evil beaſt had rent 1 in pieces ou  
devoured him. &#x27;  
  
HowevtR, what the ſons of Iſrael intended  
for ruin to Joſeph, proved the ſalvation of the  
family; and I hope and believe that the Whigs  
will have the magnanimity, like him, to ſup-  
preſs their reſentment, and the felicity of ſaving  
their ungrateful ogra  
  
Turks was never any pretence of raifing a  
Revenue in America before the cloſe of the  
war; and when the claim was firſt ſet up, it gave  
an alarm, like a warlike expedition againſt us.  
True it is, that ſome duties had been laid be-  
fore by Parliament, under pretence of regu-  
lating our trade, and by a collufion and com-  
  
0 bination,  
  
  
  
bination, between the Weſt-India Planters and  
the North-American Governors, ſome years be-  
fore, duties had been laid upon molaſſes, &amp;c.  
under the ſame pretence, but in reality merely  
to advance the value of the eſtates of the Plant -  
ers in the Weſt· India Ilands, and to put ſome  
plunder, under the name of Thirds of Seizures,  
into the pockets of the Governors. But theſe  
duties, though: more had been collected in this  
Provinte than in any other in proportion, were  
never regularly collected in any of the Colo»  
nies. So that the idea of an American Reve-  
nue, for one purpoſe or another, had never, at  
this time, been formed in American minds.

the war, was ſhe not left half a million ſterling  
in debt? Did not all the reſt of New- England  
exert itſelf in proportion? What is the reaſon  
that the Maſſachuſets has paid its debt, arid  
  
the Britiſh Miniſter, in fourteen years of peace,

credit for it, in the account of the expences of

Another thing. I will venture a bold aſſer-  
tion : The three million Americans, by the  
tax aforeſaid, upan what they are obliged to  
export to Great Britain only, what they are  
obliged ta import from Great Britain only, and  
the quantities of Britiſh manufactures, which in  
theſe climates they are obliged to conſume,  
more than the like number of people in any  
part of the three kingdoms, ultimately pay  
more of the taxes and duties that are appa-  
rently paid in Great Britain, than any three mil-  
lion ſubjects in the three kingdoms, —Al! this  
  
  
figures by the Miniſter, if he pleaſes. We can-  
not do it, We haye not the accounts, records,  
&amp;c,—Naw let this account be fairly ſtated, and  
I will engage far America, upon any penalty,  
that ſhe will pay the overplus, if any, in her  
own conſtitutional way, provided it is to be  
r for national purpoſes, as paying off the

National Debt, maintaining the Fleet, &amp;c. not

has been incurred, on pretence of protecting,  
defending, and ſecuring America, fince the laſt  
war, has been worſe than thrown away; it  
has been applied to do miſchief.— Keeping an  
army in America, has been nothing but 2  
public nuiſance.  
  
FurTBERMORE, we ſee that all the public  
  
money that is raiſed here, and have reaſon to  
believe all that will or can be raiſed, will be  
applied not for public purpoſes, national or  
provincial, but merely to corrupt the ſons of

them. They continually paid their money to  
Collectors of Duties; this they could both ſee  
and feel. An hoſt of Placemen, whoſe whole  
_ | buſineſs  
  
(489)  
buſineſs it was to collect a Revenue, were con-  
tinually rolling before them in their chariots :  
Theſe they ſaw. Their Governor was no longer  
paid by themſelves, according to their Charter,  
but out of the new Revenue, in order to ren-  
der their Aſſemblies uſeleſs, and, indeed, con-  
temptible. The Judges Salaries were threaten-  
ed every day to be paid in the ſame unconſtitu-  
tional manner. The dulleſt eye-ſfight could not  
but ſee to what all this tended, viz. to prepare  
the way for greater innovations and oppreſſions.  
They knew a Miniſter would never ſpend his  
money in this way, if he had not ſome end to  
anſwer by it. Another thing they both ſaw and  
felt ; Every man of every character, who, by  
voting, writing, ſpeaking, or otherwiſe, had  
favoured the Stamp Act, the Tea Act, and  
every other meaſure of a Miniſter or Governor,  
who they knew was aiming at the deſtruction of  
their form of Government, and introducing  
Parliamentary Taxation, was , uniformly, in  
ſome department or other, promoted to ſome  
place of honour and profit for ten years to-  
gether; and on the other hand, every man  
who favoured the people in their oppoſition to  
thoſe innovations, was depreſſed, degraded and  
perſecuted, as far as it was in the power of the  
Government to do it. 4

( 49 )  
  
Turs they confidered as a ſyſtematical means.  
of encouraging every man of abilities to  
eſpouſe the cauſe of Parliamentary Taxation,  
and the plan of deſtroying their Charter Pri-  
vileges; and to diſcourage all from exerting  
themſelves in oppoſition to them. This they  
thought a plan to enſtave them, for they uni-  
formly think that the deſtruction of their Char-  
ter, making the Council and Judges wholly  
dependent on the Crown, and the People ſub-  
je&amp; to the unlimitted power of Parliament, as  
their ſupreme Legiſlative, is ſlavery. They  
were told that the Miniftry and their Governors  
together, had formed a defign to enflave them,  
and that when once this was done, they had  
the higheſt reafon to expect Window-taxes,  
  
Hearth-taxes, Land-taxes, and all others. And  
that theſe were only -paving the way for re-  
ducing the country to Lordfhips. Were the  
People miſtaken in thefe ſuſpicions? Is it not  
now certain, that Governor Bernard, in 1769,  
had formed a deſign of this ſort? Read his  
Principles of Polity—and that Lieutenant Go-

preaches Chriſtianity, and tells the Magiſtrates,  
that they were not diſtinguiſhed from their

{mall part of the fixty millions {pent in the laft war was for her

feventh part of her fons into actual fervice ; and, at the con-  
clufion of the war, was fhe not’ left half’a million fterling in

“We have much more to say stili. Great Britain  
has confined sll our trade to herself. We are willing  
she should, as far as it can be tor the good of the  
empire. But we say that we ought to be allowed as  
  
  
  
  
  
:sell our commodities to her cheaper than we could  
  
get for them at foreign markets. This difference  
is really a tax upon us for the good of the empire,  
We are obliged to take from Great Britain, com.  
modities that we could purchase cheaper elsewhere.  
This difference is a tax upon us, for the good of the  
empire. We submit to this cheerfully, but insist  
that we ought to have credit for it, in the account  
of the expences of the empire, because it is really  
a tax upon us.—Another thing. I will venture a  
bold assertion: The three miliion Americans, by  
the tax aforesaid, upon what they are obliged to  
export to Great Britain only, what they are obliged  
to import from Great Britain only, and the quan.  
tities of British manufactures, which in these cli-  
mates they are obliged to consume, more than the  
like number of people in any part of the three king.  
doms, ultimately pay more of the taxes and duties  
  
that are apparently paid in Great Britain, than any.  
  
three million subjects in the three kingdoms.—All  
this may be computed, and reduced to stubborn  
figures by the minister, if he pleases. We cannot  
do it. We have not the accounts, records, &amp;t.—  
Now let this account be fairly stated, and I will  
engage for America, upon any penalty, that she  
will pay the overplus, if any, in her own constitu.  
tional way, provided it is to be applied for national  
purposes, as paying off the national debt, maintain.  
ing the fleet, &amp;c. not to the support of a standing  
army in time of peace, placemen and pensioners,

‘It 1s curious to observe the conduct of the  
tories towards the clergy. If a clergyman preaches  
against the principles of the revolution, and tells  
the people, that upon pain of damnation they must  
submit to an established government, of whatever  
character; the tories cry him up as an excellent  
man, and a wonderful preacher; invite him to their  
tables, procure him missions from the society, and  
chaplainships to the navy, and flatter him with the  
hopes of lawn sleeves. But, if a clergyman preaches  
Christianity, and tells the magistrates, that whey  
were not distinguished from their brethren for  
their private emolument, but for the good of the  
people; that the peopie are bound in conscience to  
obey a good government, but are not bound to sub-  
init to one that aims at destroying all the ends of  
government—oh sedition! treason! ;  
  
The clergy in all ages and countries, and in this  
in particular, are disposed enough to be on the side  
of government, as long as it is tolerable: If they  
have not been generally in the late administrations  
on that side, it is a demonstration that the late ad-  
ministration has been universally odious.”

of tho colonies. In regard to the foregoing attack upon min­  
isters of the Gospel, Mr. Adams thus wrote :   
“Massachusetteusis is then seised with a violent fit of an­  
ger at the clergy. It is curious to observe the conduct of  
the tories towards this sacred body. If a clergyman preach­  
es against the principles of the revolution, and tells the peo­  
ple, that upon pain of damnation, they must submit to ati  
established government of whatever character, the tories  
cry him up as an excellent man and a wonderful preacher;  
invite him to their tables, procure him missions from the so­  
ciety, and chaplainships to tlie navy, and flatter him with  
the hopes of lawn sleeves. But, if a clergyman preaches  
Christianity, and tells the magistrates that they are not dis­  
tinguished from their brethren for their private emolument,  
but for the good of the people; that the people are bound in  
conncience tp obey a good government, but are not bound  
to submit to one that aim* at destroying all tlie endt of gov­  
ernment—Oh, Sedition ! Treason ! I   
“The clergy, in all ages and countries, and in this iu  
particw ar, are disposed enough to be bn the side of gov­  
ernment, as long as it is tolerable. If they have not been,.  
generally, in tiie late uuiMiuistration, OB that side, it is u  
demonstration that the late administration has been uni­  
versally odious.   
“The clergy of this Province are a virtuous, sensible and  
learned set of men, and thsy do not trike their sermons from  
newspapers, but from the bible; unless it be a few who preach  
passive obedience. These are not curious enough to read  
Hobbs.   
“JI is the thdy &lt;\f tie clergy so their dis-   
courses io the times; to preach against such sins as  
most preralent, and to recommend such riilues as are  
most wanted. For example; if exhorbitant ambition and  
venality are prcdominant.ought they not warn their hearers  
against their vices I If public spirit is much wantded, should  
they not inculcate this great virtue? If tlie rights and duties  
of Christian magistrates and subjects, are disputed, should  
they not explain them, show their nature, ends, limitations,  
and restrictions, how much soever it may move the gall of

It is now most obvious, that at no period since the Amer­  
ican Revolution, have so many clergymen felt it their impe­  
rious duty to “preach politics,” as at the present time, and  
since they are disposed to be on the side of government as  
long ns it is tolerable, their preaching is indubitable proof  
that in their view, great nnd paramount questions are at is­  
sue, involving the vital interests of our country, and the  
consequent results may be our salvation from misrule and

most essential Rights and liberties of  
the colonists, and of the grievances  
under which they labor by reason of  
several late acts of Parliament.   
  
111. That it is inseparably essential  
to the freedom of a people.and the un­  
doubted right of Englishmen, that no  
taxes be imposed on them but with  
their own consent, given personally or  
by their representatives.   
IV. That the people of these colo­  
nies are not, and, from thfiir local cir­  
cumstances. cannot be represented in  
the House of Commons in Great Brit­  
ain.   
V. That the only representatives of  
the people of these colonies are per­  
sons chosen therein by themselves,and  
that no taxes ever have been or can  
be constitutionally imposed on them  
but by their respective legislatures.”   
Putting this and that together, it  
will be seen that, no matter how con

The congress of the colonies in New  
York declared “that it is inseparably es-  
sential to the freedom of a people...  
that no taxes be imposéd on them but with  
their own consent given personally or by  
their representatives.”  
  
To the assertion by Parliament of its  
right to tax the colonies, the provincial  
assemblies replied, that a stamp act even  
for such a purpose as that proposed—the  
protection of the colonies—would estab-  
lish the melancholy truth that the inhabi-  
tants of the colonies are the slaves of the  
Britons from whom they are descended

undoubted rights of Englishmen, that no taxes be imposed on

right of every British subject in these colonies.’ ”  
  
In opposition to these views, the English government held  
that Parliament had the authority to bind the colonies in all  
matters whatsoever, and that there were no vested rights  
possessed by the colonies, that could not be altered or  
annulled if Parliament so desired.
