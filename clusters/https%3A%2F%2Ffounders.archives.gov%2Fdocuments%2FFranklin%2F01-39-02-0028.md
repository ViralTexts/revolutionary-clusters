Passy, Jany. 27. 1783.  
The Departure of my dearest Friend, which I learn from your last Letter, greatly affects me. To meet with her once more in this Life, was one of the principal Motives of my proposing to visit England again before my Return to America. The last Year carried off my Friends Dr Pringle, &amp; Dr Fothergill, &amp; Lord Kaims, and Lord Le Despencer; this has begun to take away the rest, and strikes the hardest. Thus the Ties I had to that Country, &amp; indeed to the World in general, are loosned one by one, and I shall soon have no Attachment left to make me unwilling to follow.  
I intended writing when I sent the 11 Books, but I lost the Time in looking for the 12th.— I wrote with that; and hope it came to hand. I therein ask’d your Counsel about my coming to England. On Reflection I think I can, from my Knowledge of your Prudence, foresee what it will be; viz. not to come too soon, lest it should seem braving &amp; insulting some who ought to be respected. I shall therefore omit that Journey till I am near going to America; and then just step over to take Leave of my Friends, and spend a few Days with you. I purpose bringing Ben with me, and perhaps may leave him under your Care.  
At length we are in Peace, God be praised; &amp; long, very long may it continue. All Wars are Follies, very expensive &amp; very mischievous ones. When will Mankind be convinc’d of this, and agree to settle their Differences by Arbitration? Were they to do it even by the Cast of a Dye, it would be better than by Fighting &amp; destroying each other.  
Spring is coming on, when Travelling will be delightful. Can you not, when your Children are all at School, make a little Party, and take a Trip hither? I have now a large House delightfully situated, in which I could accommodate you &amp; two or three Friends; and I am but half an Hours Drive from Paris.  
In looking forward,—Twenty-five Years seems a long Period; but in looking back, how short!— Could you imagine that ’tis now full a Quarter of a Century since we were first acquainted!— It was in 1757. During the greatest Part of the Time I lived in the same House with my dear deceased Friend your Mother; of course you and I saw and convers’d with each other much and often. It is to all our Honours, that in all that time we never had among us the smallest Misunderstanding. Our Friendship has been all clear Sunshine, without any the least Cloud in its Hemisphere. Let me conclude by saying to you what I have had too frequent Occasions to say to my other remaining old Friends, the fewer we become, the more let us love one another.  
Adieu, and believe me ever, Yours most affectionately,  
B Franklin  
Mrs Hewson

“ Passy, 27 January, 1783.  
  
. . . The departure of my dearest friend,’ which I learn from your  
last letter, greatly affects me. To meet with her once more in this life  
was one of the principal motives of my proposing to visit England again  
before my return to America, The last year carried off my friends Dr.  
Pringle, Dr. Fothergill, Lord Kames, and Lord le Despencer. This has  
begun to take away the rest, and strikes the hardest. Thus the ties I  
had to that country, and indeed to the world in general, are loosened one  
by one, and I shall soon have no attachment left to make me unwilling  
to follow.

“T intended writing when I sent the eleven books, but I lost the time  
in looking for the twelfth. I wrote with that; and hope it came to hand.  
I therein asked your counsel about my coming to England. On reflec-  
tion, I think I can, from my knowledge of your prudence, foresee what  
it will be, viz., not to come too soon, lest it should seem braving and  
insulting some who ought to be respected. I shall, therefore, omit that  
journey till I am near going to America, and then just step over to take  
leave of my friends, and spend a few days with you. I propose bring-  
ing Ben with me, and perhaps may leave him under your care.’  
  
“At length we are at peace, God be praised, and long, very long, may  
it continue. All wars are follies, very expensive, and very mischievous  
ones. When will mankind be convinced of this, and agree to settle their  
differences by arbitration? Were they to do it, even by the cast of a  
die, it would be better than by fighting and destroying each other.  
  
“Spring is coming on, when travelling will be delightful. Can you  
not, when you see your children all at school, make a little party, and  
take a trip hither? I have now a large house, delightfully situated, in  
which I could accommodate you and two or three friends, and I am but  
half an hour’s drive from Paris.  
  
“Tn looking forward, twenty-five years seem‘a long period, but, in look-  
ing back, how short! Could you imagine, that it is now full a quarter of  
a century since we were first acquainted? It was in 1757. During the  
greatest part of the time, I lived in the house with my dear deceased  
friend, your mother; of course you and I conversed with each other  
much and often. It is to all our honors, that in all that time we never  
had among us the smallest misunderstanding. Our friendship has been  
all clear sunshine, without the least cloud in its hemisphere. Let me  
conclude by saying to you, what I have had too frequent occasions to say  
to my other remaining old friends, ‘The fewer we become, the more let  
us love one another.’ Adieu, and believe me ever, yours most affection-  
ately,  
  
“B. FRANKLIN.”
