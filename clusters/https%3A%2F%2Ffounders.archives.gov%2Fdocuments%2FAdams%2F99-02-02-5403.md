Sirs,  
					Quincy, July 31, 1809.  
				  
				On the 24th of August, 1780, transmitted to Congress,  
by another conveyance, duplicates of the declarations of  
Sweden, Denmark, &amp;c. relative to the maritime confederation.September 4th, wrote to Congress, news that the outward bound West-India fleet of 52 sail, and five East-Indiamen, on the 9th of August, fell in with the combined  
French and Spanish fleets, about sixty leagues from Cape  
St. Vincents, and were most of them taken, the frigates  
and four East-Indiamen alone having escaped. This is  
the account: we may possibly hear of some deductions.  
But the account in general is authentic, and of very great  
importance, as the value of the property taken is large,  
the number of soldiers and seamen considerable, and the  
disappointment to the fleets and armies of our enemies in  
the East and West Indies and in North America, difficult  
to be repaired. This news has been from the 22d of  
August to the 3d of September, in travelling from London to Amsterdam, where it makes a very great sensation  
indeed. We had at the same time news of the capture  
of most of the Quebec fleet by an American frigate and  
two brigantines.September 1, 1780, wrote from Amsterdam to Mr.  
Luzac. I have received a copy of the constitution of  
Massachusetts, of which I beg your acceptance. It has  
not yet been published in Europe, as it now appears accepted by the convention, although the report of the committee was printed in the Courier de L’Europe, some  
months ago, and in the Remembrancer, as well as the  
newspapers in London. I find many gentlemen here are  
inquisitive concerning the American forms of government; so that, if you could find room to print it, by  
small portions at a time, in your paper, you would not  
only gratify the curiosity of many of your readers, bur  
perhaps do a public service to a cause which is honored  
with your approbation.To tell you the truth, as I had some share in the formation of this constitution, I am ambitious of seeing it  
translated by the editor of the Leyden Gazette, which,  
without a compliment, I esteem the best in Europe, both  
in point of style and method.Mr. Luzac accordingly translated arid published it.September 2, wrote to Mr. William Lee, at Brussells.  
“A packet has arrived at Bilboa from America, with  
news of the arrival of De Terney, at Rhode-Island. A  
vessel has arrived here yesterday from Philadelphia, and  
another from Virginia. The enemy have retreated from  
New-Jersey to New-York, driven back by the militia.  
The people are in high spirits; trade very brisk; and  
privateering successful. I am so much of your opinion,  
that I wish Congress had a minister plenipotentiary at the  
Hague, Petersburg, Stockholm, and Copenhagen.”September 4th, wrote to my correspondent in London, “I have only time to acknowledge the receipt of yours of  
the 25th and 29th ult. which were very acceptable, and  
to enclose two newspapers and the act of Massachusetts  
establishing an academy of arts and sciences.”September 5th, wrote to Mr. Dana, at Paris, “The  
news of the capture off St. Vincents is confirmed in abundance from London, and we have news at the same time  
of an American frigate and two privateer brigs taking most  
of the Quebec fleet. You will see General Washington’s  
and General Green’s accounts of Kniphausen’s defeat  
and retreat from the Jersies. There are associations for  
forming banks at Philadelphia and another at Boston.  
The Massachusetts constitution is accepted by more than  
two thirds of the people, and is to take place the first of  
October.”Same day, wrote to Mr. Dumas, at the Hague, “the  
capture of the British fleet is of great importance in itself,  
on account of the property, the men, and the disappointment to the enemy—But when we consider it as a precedent, it is more interesting still. This is the only wife  
method of warring with Great Britain. When France  
and Spain shall adopt the policy of convoying their own commerce, and cruising for that of the enemy, this war  
will soon be brought to a conclusion. Such a capital  
success in one of their first essays will be likely to convince  
the two courts, as well as their marine officers, of the  
utility of such measures, and induce them to pursue them,  
which I wish with all my heart.I saw with pleasure the revival of the American Philosophical Society at Philadelphia, and the establishment of  
an academy of arts and sciences at Boston. In a new  
country and a young society, such institutions are perhaps  
more useful and necessary, than in older nations. But in order to render them more useful to the world, would it  
not be proper to promote some connection and correspondence between them and the academies of Europe?  
Would it be unworthy of any scientific or literary company  
to send these infant societies copies of their printed memoirs and transactions? Science and literature are of no  
party nor nation. They belong to the great commonwealth of mankind. I hope that one of the first objects  
of the new societies in America, will be the formation of  
botanical gardens, and collections of the birds, beasts and  
fishes, as well as trees and plants, which are peculiar to  
that country, in order to a natural history of it. An  
ample field this.Is it not wonderful, that it does not occur to the friends  
of England in the United provinces, that the best means  
they can use to shew their friendship to her, is to convince  
her of her error. She is rushing like a madman down a  
precipice. Is it humanity or friendship to spur her on?It is amazing that avarice itself does not stimulate the  
misers who lend her money, to stop their hands. The  
only chance English credit has for salvation is to stop  
short, acknowledge American independence—make peace,  
and secure as great a share as they can of American commerce, before it becomes established in other channels.Can it be friendship to England to fill the universe with  
she most abominable lies, in order to keep up a false idea  
of her power and the weakness of America?”September 5th, wrote to Mr. Luzac. “Inclosed is an  
abridgment of a pamphlet published in London, last winter. I beg your attentive perusal of it, and your candid  
opinion whether it would be of service to our cause, which  
is the cause of mankind, and especially of Europe, to  
publish it.”This was Governor Pownal’s memorial to the sovereigns of Europe, which I had procured to be translated, by a masterly hand, into very good French. Mr. Luzac  
published it, and it was much read and admired. It was  
thought to be highly favorable to the American cause.Though the idle sport of imagination in my next letter  
was as little to my purpose then, as it is now, yet whimsical as it is, I will not suppress it.September 5, 1780, wrote to congress. &quot;As eloquence is cultivated with more care in free republics than  
in other governments, it has been found by constant experience, that such republics have produced the greatest  
purity, copiousness and perfection of language. It is not  
to be disputed, that the form of government has an influence upon language, and language in its turn influences  
not only the form of government, but the temper, the  
sentiments and the manners of the people. The admirable models which have been transmitted through the world  
and continued down to these days, so as to form an essential part of the education of mankind, from generation  
to generation, by those two ancient towns, Athens and  
Rome, would be sufficient, without any other argument,  
to shew the United States the importance to their liberty,  
prosperity and glory, of an early attention to the subject  
of eloquence and language.Most of the nations of Europe have thought it necessary  
so establish, by public authority, institutions for fixing and  
improving their proper languages. I need not mention  
the academies in France, Spain and Italy, their learned  
labors nor their great success. But it is very remarkable,  
that, although many learned and ingenious men in England have from age to age, projected similar institutions  
for correcting and improving the English tongue, yet the government have never found time to interpose in any  
manner—so that, to this day, there is no grammar nor  
dictionary extant, of the English language, which has the  
least public authority, and it is only very lately, that a tolerable dictionary has been published even by a private  
person, and there is not yet a passable grammar enterprized by any individual.The honor of forming the first public institution for  
refining, correcting, ascertaining and improving the English language, I hope, is reserved for Congress. They have  
every motive that can possibly influence a public assembly  
to undertake it.It will have a happy effect upon the union of the States,  
to have a public standard to which all persons in all parts  
of the continent may appeal, both for signification and  
pronunciation of all their words in the most predominant  
language.The constitutions of all the States in the Union are so  
democratical, that eloquence will become an instrument  
for recommending men to their fellow-citizens, and a  
principal mean of advancement, through the various gradations and offices of society.In the last century, Latin was the universal language of  
Europe. Correspondence among the learned, and indeed  
between merchants and men of business, and conversation  
of strangers and travellers, was generally held in that  
dead language. In the present century, Latin has been  
too generally laid aside, and French has been substituted  
in its place; but has not yet become universally established, and according to present appearances, it is not probable that it will be. English is destined to be in the next  
or succeeding century, more generally the language of the  
world, than Latin was in the last, or French is, in the  
present age. The reason of this is obvious; because the  
increasing population in America, and their universal  
connection and correspondence with all nations, will, aided by the influence of England in the world, whether that  
be greater or smaller, force their language into general use, in spite of all the obstacles that may be thrown in  
the way, if any such there should be.It is not necessary to enlarge farther, to shew the motives which the people of America have to turn their  
thoughts early to this subject: they will naturally occur  
to Congress in a much greater detail than I have time to  
intimate.I would therefore submit to the consideration of Congress the expediency and policy of instituting by their authority, a society, under the name of the American Academy, for ascertaining, improving and refining the English language.The authority of Congress is necessary to give such a  
society reputation, influence and authority, through all  
the states and with other nations. The number of members of which it shall consist; the manner of appointing  
them; whether each state shall have a certain number of  
members, and the power of appointing them; or whether  
Congress shall appoint them; whether after the first appointment the society itself shall fill up vacancies; these  
and other questions will easily be determined by Congress.It will be necessary that the society should have a library, consisting of a complete collection of all writings concerning languages, ancient and modern; they must have  
some officers, and some expenses, which will require some  
funds as indispensable. Upon a recommendation of Congress, there is no doubt the legislature of every state in  
the confederation would readily pass laws making such a  
society a body politic; entitle it to sue and be sued, and  
to hold an estate real or personal, of a limited value in  
that state.I have the honor to submit these hints to the consideration of Congress, and to hope that nothing in them will  
give offence to them or their allies.I ask leave to subjoin a few facts in explanation of this  
letter, and of a paragraph in my letter to Mr. Dumas, of  
the 5th of September, 1780, relative to natural history and botanical gardens.In travelling from Boston to Philadelphia, in 1774, 5,  
6, and 7, I had several times amused myself at Norwalk,  
in Connecticut, with the very curious collection of birds  
and insects of American production made by Mr. Arnold—a collection which he afterwards fold to Governor  
Tryon, who sold it to Sir Ashton Leder, in whose  
apartments in London I afterwards viewed it again—This collection was so singular a thing, that it made a deep  
impression upon me, and I could not but consider it a  
reproach to my country, that so little was known even to  
herself of her natural history.When I was in Europe, in the years 1778 and 1779,  
in the commission to the king of France, with Dr. Franklin and Mr. Arthur Lee, I had opportunities to see the  
king’s collections and many others, which increased my  
wishes that nature might be examined and studied in my  
own country as it was in others.In France, among the academicians and other men of  
science and letters, I was frequently entertained with enquiries concerning the Philosophical Society of Philadelphia, and with eulogiums on the wisdom of that institution, and encomiums on some publications in their transactions. These conversations suggested to me the idea of  
such an establishment at Boston, where I knew there was  
as much love of science and as many gentlemen who were  
capable of pursuing it, as in any other city of its size.In 1779, I returned to Boston in the French frigate  
Le Sensible, with the Chevalier de La Luzerne and Mr.  
Marbois. The corporation of Harvard College gave a  
public dinner, in honor of the French ambassador and his  
suite, and did me the honor of an invitation to dine with  
them. At table, in the Philosophy Chamber, I chanced  
to sit next to Dr. Cooper. I entertained him during the  
whole of the time we were together, with an account of  
Arnold’s collections, the collections I had seen in Europe,  
the compliment I had heard in France upon the Philosophical Society at Philadelphia, and concluded with proposing that the future legislature of Massachusetts should institute an academy of arts and sciences.The Doctor at first hesitated—thought it would be difficult to find members who would attend to it; but his  
principal objection was, that it would injure Harvard College by sitting up a rival to it, that might draw the attention and affections of the public in some degree from  
it. To this I answered, first, that there were certainly  
men of learning enough that might compose a society  
sufficiently numerous; and secondly, that instead of being a rival to the University, it would be an honor and  
advantage to it. That the president and principal professors would no doubt be always members of it, and the  
meetings might be ordered, wholly or in part, at the College, and in that room. The Doctor at length appeared  
better satisfied, and I entreated him to propagate the idea  
and the plan, as far and as soon as his discretion would  
justify—The Doctor accordingly did diffuse the project  
so judiciously and effectually, that the first legislature under the new constitution adopted and established it by  
law.Afterwards when attending the convention for forming  
the constitution, I mentioned the subject to several of the  
members, and when I was appointed by the sub-committee  
to make a draught of a project of a constitution to be laid  
before the convention, my mind and heart was so full of  
this subject that I inserted the chapter fifth, section second,“The encouragement of Literature.“Wisdom and knowledge, as well as virtue, diffused  
generally among the body of the people, being necessary  
for the preservation of their rights and liberties: and as  
these depend on spreading the opportunities and advantages of education, in the various parts of the country,  
and among the different orders of the people, it shall be  
the duty of the Legislatures and Magistrates, in all future  
periods of this Commonwealth, to cherish the interests of  
literature, and the sciences, and all seminaries of them;  
especially the University at Cambridge, public schools  
and grammar schools in the towns; to encourage private  
societies and public institutions by rewards and immunities, for the promotion of agriculture, arts, sciences, commerce, trades, manufactures, and a natural history of the  
country; to countenance and inculcate the principles of  
humanity and general benevolence, public and private  
charity, industry, frugality, honesty and punctuality in  
their dealings: sincerity, good humour, and all social affections &amp; generous sentiments among the people.”I was somewhat apprehensive that criticism and objections would be made to the sections, and particularly that  
the “natural history” and the “good humor” would be  
stricken out; but the whole was received very kindly,  
and passed the Convention unanimously, without amendment. This gave me great encouragement to hope that  
a natural history of the country would soon be commenced under public authority: But it has been only within  
four or five years, that any thing has been undertaken in  
earnest, and that by private subscription, aided however  
with a generous grant, by the legislature, of a township of  
land, which it is to be hoped will be followed by other  
and more efficacious assistance—for the public property  
is never more honorably or profitably employed, than in  
promoting establishments of such extensive and permanent  
benefits to the present age and to posterity.

infree Republicksthan in other govérnments,  
it has been found by constant experience,  
that such Republicks have produced&#x27;the ?eut­  
est purity, copiousness, and perfection of lan­  
uage. Itis not to be disputed, that the  
Emn of government has an influchce upon_  
language, and language in its turn influences  
not only the form of government, but the tem­  
per, the sentiments, and the munners of the  
people. The admlirable models which have  
been transmitted through the world and cone  
tinued down to these days, so as to form an  
essential part of the education of mankind,  
from generation to generation, by those two  
ancient towns, Athens and Rome, would be  
sufficient, without any other l}&quot;ﬁumch?,&#x27; 10,  
shewethe the United States the importence  
to their liberty, pwrity, and gloty, of an  
early attention to the subject cﬁ&#x27; clojuence  
and language. , , |  
Most of the natiofis of Europe have,  
thought it nete to establish, by publick  
authority, instit for fixing ahd improv­  
ing their properfanguages. 1 need not men­  
tion the academies in France, Spain, and Ita­  
ly, their learped labours nor their great suc­  
cess. But 12 is very gemarkable, that, al­  
though many ledrned and ingenious nén in  
England, have from age to sge, projected  
dn&amp;lar inetitutions for torrecting and impro­  
ving the English tongue, yet the government  
have never found time to interpose in any  
manner—-50 that, to this day, thete is no  
grammar nor - dictionary extant, of the Eng­  
lish language, which has the least publick au­  
thority, and it is only vely &#x27;lately, that a tojer­  
able dictionary has been published even by a  
private person, and there_ is nobgeta Phssa  
ble grammar enterprized by angtind id-ﬂ;‘  
ual. &#x27; - L -, e  
The honour of forming WMEfirst publick  
institution for refining, corréeting, ascertains  
ing, and improving the English laniutgc, i  
hope, is reserved for Congress. ,They hayve  
every motive that €an possibly influence a  
publick assembly to undertake it  
It will have a effect upoh the unioh  
of the States, to | ‘publick ard to  
which all persons ts of ¢ tihent  
may appeal, both ification atid prohun~

.lln the last c:sémry, Latin was the unfvcfg  
language of Europe. Correspondence a­  
mong ,ﬁezhod, and indeed between mict­  
¢hants and men of business, and conversagion  
of strangers and&#x27; travellcrs, was gencrally  
held in that dead lariguage. In the present  
century, Latin has been too generally Jaid a­  
sideyand French has been substituted in ite  
place §7but has not yet became universally  
established, and according to present lpgear­  
ances it is not probable that it will he. - NZl—  
lish is destined to be in the hext.or succec  
ing century, more generally the laug&#x27;w of  
&quot; world, than Latin was in the or  
, is, in the ‘present dge. Tha reasoch  
of ‘this is obvious ; because the increasin  
population in Ame apd thieir univ |  
connection and dence with  
tions, will, aided by the influetice of nd  
in - the world, whether that be greater. or  
smaller, force their language into general

thrown in the way, if any such there “

Legislatures and Magistrates, and one which cannot too  
frequently be referred to, is contained in that noblest  
Chapier of the Constitution, which enjoins upon them,  
the obligation to cherish Literature and the Sciences,

purposes of legislation, and upon these objects the bus-

to improve, while Science is disclosing treasures of

monument of a civilizt&#x27;d people ; and if  
America were sunk beneath the waves,  
would remain the fairest picture on record of  
an ideal commonwealth ! From the second  
section of the 6fth chapter of the constitution  
of Massachusetts, he gives us the following  
passage:—  
  
“ Wisdom and knowledge, as well as virtue,  
diffused generally among the body of the people,  
being necessary for the preservation of their rights  
and liberties; and as these depend on spreading  
the opportunities and advantages of education in  
the various parts of the country, and among the  
different orders of the people, it shall be the duty  
of the legislatures and magistrates in all future  
periods of the Commonwealth, to cherish the in¬  
terests of literature and the sciences, and all sem¬  
inaries of them ; especially in the University of  
Cambridge, public schools, and grammar schools  
in the towns ; to encourage private societies and  
public institutions, rewards and immunities for  
the promotion of agriculture, arts, sciences, com¬  
merce, trade, manufactures, and a natural history  
of the country; to countenance and inculcate the  
principles of humanity and general benevolence,  
ublic and private charity, industry, and frugality,  
onesty and punctuality in their dealings ; sincer¬  
ity, good hamor, and all social afiections and gen¬  
erous sentiments among the people.”  
  
In England it is the doctrine of a certain  
school of liberal politicians (we fear a large  
one), that education should be as voluntary  
as religion, and that both should be left t

“In travelling from Boston to Philadelphiain 1774-5-6-7, I had  
several times amused myself at Norwalk, Connecticut, with the  
very curious collection of birds and insects of American produc-  
tion made by Mr. Arnold, a collection which he afterwards sold to  
Governor Tryon, who sold it to Sir Ashton Lever, in whose apart-  
ments in London I afterwards viewed it again. This collection was  
so singular a thing that it made a deep impression on me, and I could  
not but consider it a reproach to my country that so little was known  
even to herself of her natural history.  
  
“ When I was in Europe in the years 1778 and 1779, in the com-  
mission to the King of France with Dr. Franklin and Mr. Arthur  
Lee, I had opportunity to see the King’s collection and many others,  
whick increased my wishes that nature might be examined and studied  
in my own country as it was in others.  
  
“In France, among the academicians and other men of science and  
letters, I was frequently entertained with inquiries concerning the  
Philosophical Society at Philadelphia, and with eulogiums on the wis-  
dom of that institution and encomiums on some publications of their ,  
transactions.  
  
  
  
CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION RESPECTING EDUCATION. 87  
  
“ These conversations suggested to me the idea of such an establish-  
ment in Boston, where I knew there was as much love of acience, and  
as many gentlemen capable of pursuing it, as in any other city of its size.  
  
“In 1779 I returned to Boston in the French frigate, La Sen-  
sible, with the Chevalier de la Luzerne and Mr. Marbois. The  
corporation of Harvard College gave a public dinner in honor of the  
French ambassador and his suite, and did me the honor of an invita-  
tion to dine with them.  
  
“ At the table, in the philosophy chamber, I chanced to sit next to Dr.  
Cooper. I entertained him during the whole of the time we were  
together with an account of Arnold’s collections I had seen in Europe,  
the compliments I had heard in France upon the Philosophical Soci-  
ety at Philadelphia, and concluded with proposing that the future  
legislature of Massachusetts should institute an academy of arts and  
sciences.  
  
“The doctor at first hesitated, thought it would be difficult to find  
members who would attend to it; but his principal objection was that  
it would injure Harvard College by setting up a rival to it that might  
draw the attention and affections of the people in some degree from it.  
To this I answered : first, that there were certainly men of learning  
enough that might compose a society sufficiently numerous; and,  
secondly, that instead of being a rival to the university, it would be an  
honor and advantage to it. That the president and principal pro-  
fessors would undoubtedly be always members of it, and the meetings  
might be ordered wholly or in part at the college, and in that room.  
The doctor at length appeared better satisfied, and I entreated him to  
propagate the idea and the plan as far and as soon as his discretion  
would justify. The Doctor accordingly did diffuse the project so  
judiciously and effectually that the first legislature under the constitu-  
tion adopted and established it by law.*  
  
“ Afterwards, when attending the convention for framing the consti-  
tution, I mentioned the subject to several of the members, and when I  
was appointed by the sub-committee to make a draught of a project of a  
constitution to be laid before the convention, my mind and heart were  
so full of the subject I inserted chapter v, section 2

statesman. We find the whole history in the memoirs of John  
Adams, a man who believed, with Washington, that scientific  
institutions are the best and most lasting protection of a popu-  
lar government.  
  
In a memorandum written in 1809, Mr. Adams gave his ree-  
ollections of the circumstances which led to his deep and last-  
ing interest in scientific foundations.  
  
jer of -  
  
In traveling from Boston to Philadelphia. in 1774~’75-’76—77, I had sev-  
eral times amused myself at Norwalk, in Connecticut, with the very curi-  
ous collection of birds and insects of American production made by Mr.  
Arnold ;* acollection which he afterwards sold to Governor Tryon, who  
sold it to Sir Ashton Lever, in whose apartments in London I afterwards  
viewed it again. This collection was so singular a thing that it made a  
deep impression upon me, and I could not but consider it a reproach to my  
country, that so little was known, even to herself, of her natural history.  
  
*Some local antiquary may make an interesting contribution to the  
literature of American museum work by looking up the history of this  
  
  
  
collection.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS—GOODE. 57  
  
When I wasin Europe, in the years 1778-’79 in the commission to the King  
of France, with Dr. Franklin and Mr. Arthur Lee, I had opportunities to  
see the King’s collection and many others, which increased my wishes that  
nature might be examined and studied in my own country, as it was in  
others.  
  
In France, among the Academicians and other men of science and letters,  
I was frequently entertained, with inquiries concerning the Philosophical  
Society of Philadelphia, and with eulogiums on the wisdom of that institu-  
tion, and encomiums on some publications in their Transactions. These  
conversations suggested to me the idea of such an establishment in Boston,  
where I knew there was as much love of science, and as many gentlemen  
who were capable of pursuing it, as in any other city of its size.  
  
In 1779, I returned to Boston on the French frigate La Sensible, with the  
Chevalier de la Luzerne and M. Marbois.* The corporation of Harvard  
College gave a public dinner in honor of the French ambassador and his  
suite, and did me the honor of an invitation to dine with them. At table  
in the Philosophy Chamber, I chanced to sit next to Dr. Cooper.t I enter-  
tained him during the whole of the time we were together, with an account  
of Arnold’s collections, the collection I had seen in Europe, the compliments  
I had heard in France upon the Philosophical Society of Philadelphia, and  
concluded with proposing that the future legislature of Massachusetts should  
institute an Academy of Arts and Sciences.  
  
The doctor at first hesitated ; thought it would be difficult to find mem-  
bers who would attend to it; but the principal objection was, that it would  
injure Harvard College by setting up arival to it that might draw the atten-  
tion and affections of the public in some degree from it. To this I answered,—  
first, that there were certainly men of learning enough that might compose a  
society sufficiently numerous ; and secondly, that instead of being a rival to  
the university, it would be an honor and an advantage toit. That the presi-  
dent and principal professors would, no doubt, be always members of it;  
and the meetings might be ordered, wholly or in part, at the college and

treated him to propagate the idea and the plan as far and as soon as his dis-  
cretion would justify. The doctor did accordingly diffuse the project so  
judiciously and effectually that the first legislature under the new consti-

that nature might be examined and studied in my own country, as it wasin others.  
  
“*In France among the Academicians, and other men of science and letters,  
I was frequently entertained, with inquiries concerning the Philosophical  
Society of Philadelphia, and with eulogiums on the wisdom of that institution,  
and encomiums on some publications in their Transactions. These conversations  
suggested to me the idea of such an establishment in Boston, where I knew  
there was as much love of science, and as many gentlemen who were capable  
of pursuing it, as in any other city of its size.  
  
‘*In 1779, I returned to Boston on the French Frigate ‘ La Sensible,’ with  
the Chevalier de la Luzerne and M. Marbois.? The Corporation of Harvard  
College gave a public dinner in honor of the French Ambassador and his suite,  
and did me the honor of an invitation to dine with them. At table in the  
Philosophy Chamber, I chanced to sit next to Dr. Cooper.* I entertained him  
during the whole of the time we were together, with an account of Arnold’s  
collections, the collection I had seen in Europe, the compliments I had heard  
in France upon the Philosophical Society of Philadelphia, and concluded with  
proposing that the future legislature of Massachusetts should institute an  
Academy of Arts and Sciences

** The Doctor at first hesitated, thought it would be difficult to find members  
who would attend to it; but the principal objection was, that it would injure  
Harvard College, by setting up a rival to it, that might draw the attention and  
affections of the Public in some degree from it. To this I answered,—first,  
that there were certainly men of learning enough that might compose a society  
sufficiently numerous; and secondly, that instead of being a rival to the Uni-  
versity, it would be an honor and an advantage to it. That the President and  
principal professors would, no doubt, be always members of it; and the meet-  
ings might be ordered, wholly or in part, at the College and in that room. The  
Doctor at length appeared better satisfied ; and I entreated him to propagate  
the idea and the plan, as far and as soon as his discretion would justify. The  
Doctor did accordingly diffuse the project so judiciously and effectually, that  
the first legislature under the new constitution adopted and established it by  
law. Afterwards when attending the convention for forming the constitution,  
I mentioned the subject to several of the members, and when I was appointed  
by the sub-committee to make a draught of a project of a constitution, to be  
laid before the convention, my mind and heart were so full of this subject, that  
I inserted the provision for the encouragement of literature in chapter fifth, sec
