Sir  
New York Septr the 2d 1776  
  
As my Intelligence of late has been rather unfavourable and would be received with anxiety &amp; concern, peculiarly happy should I esteem myself, were It in my power at this time, to transmit such information to Congress, as would be more pleasing and agreable to their Wishes—But unfortunately for me—Unfortunately for them, It is not.  
Our situation is truly distressing—The check our Detachment sustained on the 27th Ulto, has dispirited too great a proportion of our Troops and filled their minds with apprehension and despair—The Militia instead of calling forth their utmost efforts to a brave &amp; manly opposition in order to repair our Losses, are dismayed, Intractable, and Impatient to return. Great numbers of them have gone off; in some Instances, almost by whole Regiments—by half Ones &amp; by Companies at a time—This circumstance of Itself, Independent of others, when fronted by a well appointed Enemy, superior in number to our whole collected force, would be sufficiently disagreable, but when their example has Infected another part of the Army—When their want of discipline &amp; refusal of almost every kind of restraint &amp; Government, have produced a like conduct, but too common to the whole, and an entire disregard of that order and subordination necessary to the well doing of an Army, and which had been Inculcated before, as well as the nature of our Military establishment would admit of, our condition is still more alarming, and with the deepest concern I am obliged to confess my want of confidence in the Generality of the Troops. All these circumstances fully confirm the opinion I ever entertained, and which I more than once in my Letters took the liberty of mentioning to Congress, that no dependence could be put in a Militia or other Troops than those enlisted and embodied for a longer period than our regulations heretofore have prescribed. I am persuaded and as fully convinced, as I am of any One fact that has  
  
happened, that our Liberties must of necessity be greatly hazarded, If not entirely lost If their defence is left to any but a permanent, standing Army I mean One to exist during the War—Nor would the expence Incident to the support of such a body of Troops as would be competent almost to every exigency, far exceed that which is daily Incurred by calling in succour and New Inlistments and which when effected are not attended with any good consequences. Men who have been free and subject to no controul cannot be reduced to order in an Instant, and the privileges &amp; exemptions they claim and will have Influence the conduct of others and the aid derived from them is nearly counterbalanced by the disorder, Irregularity and confusion they occasion—I cannot find that the Bounty of Ten Dollars is likely to

. Our number of men at present fit for duty are under 20,000—they were so by the last returns and best accounts I could get after the Engagement on Long Island—since which Numbers have deserted—I have ordered Genl Mercer to send the Men Intended for the Flying Camp to this place, about a 1000 in number, and to try with the Militia, if practicable, to make a diversion upon Staten Island. Till of late I had no doubt in my own mind of defending this place nor should I have yet If the Men would do their duty, but this I despair of—It is painfull and extremely grating to me to give such unfavourable accounts, but It would be criminal to conceal the truth at so critical a juncture—Every power I possess shall be exerted to serve the Cause, &amp; my first wish is, that whatever may be the event, the Congress will do me the Justice to think so. If we should be obliged to abandon this Town, ought It to stand as Winter Quarters for the Enemy? They would derive great conveniences from It on the one hand—and much property would be destroyed on the other—It is an important question, but will admit of but little time for deliberation—At present I dare say the Enemy mean to preserve It if they can—If Congress therefore should resolve upon the destruction of It, the Resolution should be a profound secret as the knowledge of It will make a Capital  
  
change in their plans. I have the Honor to be with great esteem Sir Your Most Obedt S

on the 6th day after the defeat on  
Long Island, as follows: &quot;Our situ­  
ation is truly distressing. The check  
our detachment lately sustained has  
dispirited too great a propertion of  
our troops, and filled their minds with  
apprehension and despair. The militia  
instead of calling forth their utmost  
efforts to a brave and manly opposi­  
tion, in order to repair our losses are  
dismayed, intractable, and impatient  
to return. Great numbers of them  
have gone off; in some instances, al  
most by whole regiments, in many by  
half ones, and by companies at a time.  
This circumstance of itself, indepen­  
dent of others, when fronted by a well  
appointed enemy, superior in number  
to our whole collected force, would be  
sufficiently disagreeable; but when it  
is added, that their example has in­  
fested another part of the army; that  
their want of discipline and re­  
fusal of almost every kind of restraint  
and Government, have rendered a like  
conduct but too common in the whole  
and have produced an entire disregard  
of that order and subordination which  
is necessary for an army, our condi­  
tion is still more alarming, and with  
the deepest concern I am obliged to  
confess my want of confidence in the  
generality of the troops. All these  
cirsumstances fully confirm the opin  
  
  enesooeee  ee  a o

ion I eyer entertained, and which I  
more than once in my letters took the  
liberty of mentioning to congress, that  
no dependence could be put in a mili  
tia, or other troops than those enlisted  
and embodied for a longer period than  
our regulations have hitherto pres­  
cribed. I am fully convinced that  
our liberties must of necessity be  
greatly hazarded, if not entirely lost,  
if their defence be left to any but a  
permanent army.  
&quot;Nor would the expense incident to  
the support of such a body of troeps  
as would be competent to every exi­  
gency, far exceed that which is incur­  
red by calling in daily succors and  
new enlistments, which, when effected  
are not attended with any good con­  
sequences. Men who have been free  
and subject to no contrel, cannot be  
reduced to order in an instant; and  
the privileges and exemptions they  
claim and will bave, influence the con­  
duct of others in such a manner, that  
the aid derived from them is nearly  
counterbalanced by the disorder, ir­
