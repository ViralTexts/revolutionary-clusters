Dear Sir  
Monticello  
Dec. 25 25  
Your favor of the 15th was recieved 4. days ago. it found me engaged in what I could not lay aside till this day.Far advanced in my 83d year, worn down with infirmities which have confined me almost entirely to the house for 7. or 8. months past, it afflicts me much to recieve appeals to my memory for transactions so far back as that which is the subject of your letter. my memory is indeed become almost a blank, of which no better proof can probably be given you than by my solemn protestation that I have not the least recollection of your intervention between mr John Q. Adams and myself in what past on the subject of the embargo. not the slightest trace of it remains in my mind. yet I have no doubt of the exactitude of the statement in your letter. and the less as I recollect the interview with mr Adams, to which the previous communications which had past between him and yourself were probably and naturally the preliminary. that interview I remember well; not indeed in the very words which passed between us, but in their substance, which was of a character too awful, too deeply engraved in my mind, and influencing too materially the course I had to pursue ever to be forgotten. Mr Adams called on me pending the embargo, and while endeavors were making to obtain it’s repeal. he made some apologies for the call, on the ground of our not being then in the habit of confidential communications, but that that which he had then to make involved too seriously the interest of our country not to overrule all other considerations with him, and make it his duty to reveal it to myself particularly. I assured him there was no occasion for any apology for his visit, that on the contrary his communications would be thankfully recieved and would add a confirmation the more to my entire confidence in the rectitude and patriotism of his conduct and principles. he spoke then of the dissatisfaction of the Eastern portion of our confederacy with the restraints of the embargo then existing and their restlessness under it. that there was nothing which might not be attempted, to rid themselves of it. that he had information of the most unquestionable certainty that certain citizens of the Eastern states (I think he named Massachusets particularly) were in negociation with Agents of the British government, the object of which was an agreement that the New England states should take no further part in the war then going on; that, without formally declaring their separation from the union of the States, they should withdraw from all aid and obedience to them; that their navigation and commerce should be free from restraint or interruption by the British; that they should be considered, and  treated by them as Neutrals, and as such might conduct themselves towards both parties; and, at the close of the war, be at liberty to rejoin the Confederacy. he assured me that there was eminent danger that the Convention would take place, that the temptations were such as might debauch many from their fidelity to the Union, and that, to enable it’s friends to make head against it, the repeal of the embargo was absolutely necessary.I expressed a just sense of the merit of the information, and of the importance of the disclosure to the safety &amp; even the salvation of our country. and, however reluctant I was to abandon the measure (a measure which, persevered in a little longer, we had subsequent and satisfactory assurance would have effected it’s object completely) from that moment, and influenced by that information, I saw the necessity of abandoning it, and instead of effecting our purpose by this peaceful weapon we must fight it out, or break the Union. I then recommended to my friends to yield to the necessity of a repeal of the embargo, and to endeavor to supply it’s place by the best substitute in which they could procure a general concurrence.I cannot too often repeat that this statement is not pretended to be in the very words which passed; that it only gives faithfully the impression remaining on my mind. the very words of a conversation are too transient and fugitive to be so long retained in remembrance. but the substance was too important to be forgotten, not only from the revolution of measures it obliged me to adopt, but also from the renewals of it in my memory on the frequent occasions I have had of doing justice to mr Adams, by repeating this proof of his fidelity to his country, and of his superiority over all ordinary considerations when the safety of that was brought into question.With this best exertion of a waning memory which I can command, accept assurances of my constant and affectionate friendship and respect.Th: Jefferson

Dear Sir : Your favor of the 15th was received  
four days ago. It found me engaged in what 1 could  
not lay aside till this tlav.  
Far advanced in my Bail year, worn down with  
infiriniiies which have confined me almost entirely  
to the house for 7 or 8 months past, it afflicts me  
much to receive appeals to my memory for transac t;  
tions so tar bark as that which is the subject ol your 0

ot which no bettei proof can probably be given you  
than by my solemn protestation dial ( have not the  
least recollection of your intervention between Mr.  
Ju niQ. Adams and my sell, in wl.at passed on the  
subject of die embargo. Not the slightest trace ol it  
remains in my mind. \et I have no doubt ol the s  
exactitude ut the statement ill your loiter And  
the less as recollect the interview with Mr Adams

naturally the preliminary. 1 hat interview 1 re­

passed between us, but in their substance« which  
• r , # I . I I I  
was ol a character loo a vv I u I, too ueeplv engraved  
in my mind, and influencing ton materially the  
course 1 had to pursue, ever to be forgotten. Mr.  
Adams called on me pending the embargo, aful  
while endeavors were making to obtain its repeal.  
He made some apologies for il.e call, on the ground  
of our not being then in the habit of confidential  
communications, but that which lie had then to make  
involved ton seriously the interests of our country  
not to overrule all other considerations with him,  
ami make it his dmv to reveal it to myself purlieu­  
lari y. I assured him there was no occasion for any  
apology for his visit, that on the contrary his coni­  
munications would be thankfully receiveifand would  
-add a confirmation tlie more to my entire confidence  
in ihe rectitude and patriotism iff his conduct and  
principles. He spoke then of the dissatisfaction nf  
the Eastern portion of our Confederacy with the  
resti aints of the embargo then existing, and their  
Judge A. Stuart.  
Monttokllo, Dec.  
18:15.  
Mr. Giles :  
  
resti aints of the embargo then existing, and their  
resilessne-s under it. That there was nothing which pnn  
might not be attempied to rid themselves of it.  
That he had information of the most unquestiona­  
ble certainty tint certain citizens of the Eastern ei|  
States (I think he named Massachusetts particular­  
lyj were in negotiation with the agents of the Brit­  
ish Government, tin- object of which was an agree­  
ment that the New Ragland States should lake no  
lurther part in the war then going on ; that, witn­  
out formally declaring their separation from the  
Union ol tlie States, they should withdraw from all  
aid and obedience to them ; that their navigation and  
commerce should be free from restraint or interrup­  
tion by the British ; that they should be considered  
and treated by them as neutrals, and as sucli might j  
conduct themselves towards both patties ; and, at  
the close of the war, be at liberty to rejoin the Con­  
federacy.  
He assured me that there was imminent danger  
that tlie Convention would take place, that the  
tempiations were such as might debauch many  
from their fidelity to the Union, and that to enable  
its friends to make head against it, the repeal of the  
embatgo was absolutely necessary. I expressed a  
just sense of the merit of the information, and of  
the importance of the disclosure to the safety and  
even salvation of our country : and however reluc­  
tant I was to abandon the measure(a mea-ure which,  
persevered in a little longer, we had subsequent  
and satisfactory assurance would have effected its  
object completely) from that moment, and influen­  
ced by that information, I saw the necessity of aban­  
  
doning it, and instead of effecting our purpose by  
this peaceful weapon we must fight it out, or break  
the Union. I then recommended to my friends to yield  
to the necessity of a repeal of the embargo, and to  
endeavor to supply its place by the best substitute  
in which they could procure a general concurrence.

Dear sir: Your favor of the 15th was received four  
days ago. It found me engaged in what I could not lay  
aside till this day.  
  
Far advanced in my 83d year, worn down with infirmi-  
ties which have confined me almost entirely to the house  
for 7 or 8 months past, it afflicts me much to receive ap-  
pealsto my memory for transactions so far back as that  
which is the subject of your letter. My memory is in-  
deed become almost a blank, of which no better proof  
can probably be given you than by my solemn protesta-  
tion that I have not the least recollection of your inter-  
vention between Mr. John Q. Adams and myself, in  
what passed on the subject of the embargo. Not the  
  
May 1|  
then ask the favor of you to furnish me with a copy of |  
  
et eee  
  
doubt of the exactitude of the statement in your letter,  
And the less as I recollect the interview with Mr. Adams,  
to which the previous communications which had past  
betweenhim and yourself, were pecanante and naturally  
the preliminary. ‘That interview I remember well; not,  
indeed, inthe very words which passed between us, but  
in their substance, which was of a character too awful,  
too deeply engraved in my mind, and influencing too  
  
materially the course I had to pursue, ever to be forgot-  
ten. Mr. Adams called on me pending the embargo,  
and while endeavors were making to obtain its pone  
He made some apologies for the call, on the ground of our  
not being then in the habit of confidential communications,  
but that which he had then to make, involved too serious-  
ly the interests of our country not to overrule all other  
considerations with him, and make it his duty to reveal  
it to myself particularly. I assured him there was no  
oceasion for any apology for his visit, that on the contrary  
his communications would be thankfully received and  
would add a confirmation the more to my entire confi-  
dence in the rectitude and patriotism of his conduct and  
principles. He spoke then of the dissatisfaction of the  
eastern portion of our confederacy with the restraints of  
the embargo then existing, and their restlessness under  
it. That there was nothing which might not be attempt-  
ei to rid themselves of it. ‘That he had information of  
the most unquestionable certainty that certain citizens of  
the eastern states (I think he named Massachusetts pars  
ticularly) were in negotiation with the agents of the Brit-  
ish government, the object of which was as agreement  
that the New England states should take no further part  
in the war then going on; that, without formally declar-  
ing their separation from the union of the states, they  
should withdraw from all aid and obedience to them; that  
their navigation and commerce should be free from re-  
  
  
  
  
  
straint or interruption by the British, that they sheuld be  
| considered and treated by them as neutrals, and as such  
|might conduct themselves towards both parties; and, at  
ithe close of the war, be at liberty to rejoin the confede-  
racy.  
  
Heassured me that there was imminent danger that  
the convention would take place, that the temptations  
were such as might debauch many froin their fidelity to  
the union, and that to enable its friends to make head  
against it, the repeal of the embargo was absolutely ne-  
eessary. I expressed a just sense of the merit of the  
information, and of the importance of the disclosure to  
the safety and even salvation of our country: and howe  
ever reluctant Lwas to abandon the measure (a measure  
which, persevered ina little longer, we had subsequent  
and satisfactory assurance would have effected its object  
| completely ) from that moment, and influenced by that ine  
formation, | saw the necessity of abandoning it, and ine  
stead of effecting our purpose by this peaceful weapon we  
raust fight it out, or break the union. I then recom-  
mended to my friends to yield to the necessity of a repeal  
of the embargo, and to endeavor to supply its place by  
the best substitute in which they could procure a general  
concurrence.  
  
I cannot too often repeat that this statement is not  
pretended to be in the very words which passed; that it  
ouly gives faithfully the impression remaining on my  
mind. ‘The very words of a conversation are too trane  
sient and fugitive to be so long retained in remembrance.  
But the substance was too important to be forgotten; not  
only from the revolution of measures it obliged me to  
adopt, but also from the renewals of it in my. memory  
on the frequent occasions | have had of doing justice to  
Mr. Adams, by repeating this proof of his fidelity to his  
country, and of his superiority over all ordinary consid-  
erations when the safety of that was brought into question  
  
With this best exertion of a waning memory which I  
can command, accept assurances of my constant and af-  
fectionate friendship aud respect.  
  
THOMAS JEFFERSON

Mr. Giles. Dear Sir.—Your favor  
of the !5th was received four .lays ago.  
It found me engaged in what i could not  
lay aside till this day.  
Far advanced in my 8Sd year, worn  
down mfli infirmities which have confi­  
ned me almost entirely to the house for  
7 or 8 months past, it afflicts me touch  
to receive appeals to my memory for  
transactions so far hack as that which is  
the subject of your letter. My memory  
is indeed, become almost a blank, of  
w’hich no better proof can probably be  
given you than by iny solemn protesta­  
tion that i have not the least recollection  
ol your intervention between Mr J. Q  
Adams and myself in wbat passed on the  
subject of the embargo Not the slight­  
est trace of it temaijia in ay mind* Yet  
  
I have no doubt of the exactitude of th*  
&#x27;tatepieat in your letter. And the lea*  
»• i recollect the interview with Mr- A*  
dam*, to which the previous communi­  
cations which had past between him and  
yourself were probably and naturally  
the preliminary. That interview I re­  
member well; not indeed in the very  
words which passed between us, but in  
their subsistence, wrhich was of a char­  
acter loo awful, too deeply engraved in  
my mind, and influencing too material­  
U the course I had to pursue* ever to  
he forgotten- Mr. Adams called on me  
pending the embargo, and while endea­  
vors w* ie making to obtain its repeal.—  
lie made some apologies for the call,  
on the ground of our not heing then in  
li&quot;&#x27; ^ ahit of confidential communications,  
hut that which he bad then to make, in­  
volved too seriously the interest of our  
country not to overrule all other consid­  
erations with him, and make it his duty  
to reveal it to myself particularly. I as­  
sured him thero wo• .... ....._t__  
  
apology for his Visit, that on the contra,  
ry his communication* would be thank­  
fully received and would add a confir­  
mation the more to my entire oonfi*  
dence in the rectitude and patriotism of  
his conduct and principles. He spoke  
then of the dissatisfaction of the eastern  
portion of our confederacy with tbe res­  
traints of the embargo then existing, and  
tlieir restlessness under it. That there  
was nothing which might not be attempt­  
ed, to rid themselves of it. That he bad  
information of the most unquestionable  
cei taint? that certain citizens of the eas­  
tern stales (I think he named Massachu*  
setts particularly) were in negotiation  
with agents of the British Government,  
the object of which was an agreement  
(fiat the New England states should take  
no further part in the war then going on;  
that, without formally declaring their  
separation from the union of tbe states,  
they should withdiaw from all aid and  
obedience to them; that their navigation  
and commerce should be free from re­  
straint or interruption by the British;  
that they should be considered, amftrea­  
ted by them as neutrals, and as e&#x27;ch  
might conduct themselves towards bolt*  
parties; »nd, at the dose of the war, be  
at liberty to rejoin the confederacy H*  
assured me that there was eminent dan­  
  
r u» at t. h e Son ve nt 10wwouId take pi ice,  
(hat the temptation were such as might  
debauch many froa» tbeir fr-Jelity to &#x27;jp*  
union, and that to enable if, friendi to  
make head against it, the re*at tbe  
embargo was absolutely neb*:.nary. |  
expressed a just sensei,/ (La merit of  
Urn information, and of the i.oporlanc®  
of the disclosure t &gt; the safely and even  
salvation of our country; and howeve®  
leluctaut I was to abandon tho tneaaur®  
(a measure which, persevered in a Ut­  
ile longer, we had subsequent and satis­  
fartory assurance would have effected  
its objt ct completely,) from that moment,  
and influenced by that information, f  
saw (be necessity of abandoning it, and  
instead of effecting our pur pose by this  
peaceful weapon we must fight it out,  
or break the union. I then recommen­  
ded to my friends to yield to the necessi­  
ty of a repeal of the embargo, and to en­  
deavor to supply its place by tbe best  
aub-titute in which they could procure®  
general concurrence.  
r cannot too often repeat that this  
statement is not pretended to be in tb® &#x27;  
very words which passed; that it only  
gives faithfully the impression remain­  
ing .»n my mind. The very words of ®  
conversation are too transient and fugi­  
tive to be so long retained in remem­  
brance. Hut tbe sublance was too im­  
portant to lie forgottou, not only from  
tbe revolution of measures it obliged me  
to adopt, but also from the renewals of  
it in my memory on the frequent occa­  
sions I have had af doing justice to Mr.  
Adams, by repeating this proof of hi®  
fidelity to his country, and of bis supa­  
rioritv over alt ordinary considerations  
when the safety of that was brought into  
  
With this best exertion of « waning  
memory which I ran command* accept  
assurances of my constant and affection&#x27;  
ate friendship and respect.  
THOMAS JEFFERSON

*• I recollect the interview with Mr. Adams,  
to which the previous communications  
which had passed between him and your­  
self, were probably and naturally the pre­  
liminary. That interview 1 remember well;  
not, indeed,in the very words which passed  
between us, but in their substance, which  
was of a character too awful, too deeply en­  
graved in my mind, and influencing too  
materially the course 1 had to pursue, ever  
to be forgotten. Mr. Adams called on me  
pending the embargo, and while endeavors  
were making to obtain its repeal. He made  
some apologies sot the call, on the ground  
of our not being then in the habit of confi­  
dential communications, butthat which he  
had then to make, involved too seriously the  
interests of our country not to overrule all  
other considerations with him, and make it  
his duty to reveal it to myself particularly.  
I assured him there was no occasion for an  
apology for his visit, that on the contrary  
his communications would be thankfully re­  
ceived and would add a confirmation the  
more to my entire confidence in the recti­  
tude and patrotism of his conduct and prin­  
ciples. lie spoke then of the dissatisfaction  
of the Eastern portion of our Confederacy  
with the restraints of the embargo then ex­  
isting, ami their restlessness under it. That  
there was nothing which might not be at­  
tempted to rid themselves of it. That he  
had information of the most unquestionable  
certainty that certain citizens of the Eastern  
States (I think he named Massachusetts  
particularly) were in negotiation with the  
agents of the British Government, the ob­  
ject of which was an agreement that the  
New England States should take no further  
part in the war then going on; that, without  
formally declaring their separation from the  
Union of the States, they should withdraw  
from all aid nnd obedience to them;

tion that I have not the least recollection of your inter-  
  
vention between Mr. John Q. Adams and myself, in  
  
what passed on the subject of the embargo. Not the  
  
slightest trace of it remams inmy mind. Yet I have no  
  
doubt of the exactitude of the statement in your Tetter.  
  
And the lessas [recollect the interview with Mr. Adams,  
  
to which the previous communications which had passed  
  
between him and yourself, were ere and naturally  
  
the preliminary. “That interview I remember well; not,  
  
indeed, in the very words which passed between us, but in  
their very substance, which was ofa character too awful,  
  
too deeply engraved in =y mind, and influencing too  
  
materially the course I had to pursue, ever to be forgot-  
ten. Mr. Adams called on me pending the embargo,  
and while endeavors were making to obtain its repeal.  
  
He made some apologies for the call, on the ground of our  
not being then in the habit of confidential communieations,  
but that which he had then to make, involved too serious-  
ly the interests of our country not to overrule all other

eastern portion of our confederacy with the restraints of  
the embargo then existing, and their restlessness under  
it. That there was nothing which might not be attempt-  
ed torid themselves of it. That he had information of  
the most unquestionable certainty that certain. citizens of  
the eastern states, (I think he named Massachusetts par-  
ticularly), were in negotiation with the agents ef the Brit.  
ish government, the object of which was an agreement  
that the New England states should take no further part

straint or Interruption by the British, thaf they should be  
considered and treated by them as neutrals, and as such  
might conduct themselves towards both parties; and, at  
the close of the war, be at liberty to jom the confede-  
racy.  
  
He assured me that there was eminent danger that  
the convention would take place, that the temptations  
were such as might debauch many from their fidelity te  
the union, and that to enable its friends to make head

mended to my friends to yield to the necessity ofa repeal  
of the embargo, and to endeavor to supply its place by  
the best substitute in which they could procure a general  
concurrence.  
  
I cannot too often repeat that this statement is not  
pretended to be in the very words which passed; that it  
only gives faithfully the impression remaining on my  
mind. The very words of a conversation are ton trane  
sient and fugitive to be se long retained in remembrance.  
But the substance was too important to be forgotten; not  
only from the revolution of measures it obliged me to  
adopt, but also from the renewals of it in my memory  
on the frequent oceasionsI have had of doing justice to  
Mr. Adams, by repeating this proof of his elity to his  
country, and of his superiority over all ordinary comsid-  
erations when the safety of that was brought into question.  
  
With this best exertion of a wahing memory which I  
can command, accept assurances of my constant and af-  
  
fectionate friendship and na
