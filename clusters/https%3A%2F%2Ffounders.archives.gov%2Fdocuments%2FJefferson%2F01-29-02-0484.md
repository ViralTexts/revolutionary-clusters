Dear Sir  
Philadelphia Dec. 31. 1797.  
  
Mr. Tazewell has communicated to me the enquiries you have been so kind as to make relative to a passage in the Notes on Virginia, which has lately excited some newspaper publications. I feel with great sensibility the interest you take in this business and with pleasure go into explanations with one whose objects I know to be truth and justice alone. Had Mr. Martin thought proper to suggest to me that doubts might be entertained of the transaction respecting Logan, as stated in the Notes on Virginia, and to enquire on what grounds that statement was founded, I should have felt myself obliged by the enquiry, have informed him candidly of the grounds, and cordially have co-operated in every means of investigating the fact, and correcting whatsoever in it should be found to have been erroneous. But he chose to step at once into the newspapers, and in his publications there, and the letters he wrote to me, adopted a style which forbade the respect of an answer. Sensible however that no act of his could absolve me from the justice due to others, as soon as I found that the story of Logan could be doubted, I determined to enquire into it as accurately as the testimony remaining after a lapse of twenty odd years would permit, and that the result should be made known either in the first new edition which should be printed of the Notes on Virginia, or by publishing an Appendix. I thought that so far as that work had contributed to impeach the memory of Cresap, by handing on an erroneous charge, it was proper it should be made the vehicle of retribution. Not that I was at all the author  of the injury. I had only concurred with thousands and thousands of others in believing a transaction on authority which merited respect. For the story of Logan is only repeated in the Notes on Virginia precisely as it had been current more than a dozen years before they were published. When Ld. Dunmore returned from the expedition against the Indians in 1774. he and his officers brought the speech of Logan, and related the circumstances of it. These were so affecting, and the speech itself so fine a morsel of eloquence that it became the theme of every conversation, in Williamsburg particularly, and generally indeed wheresoever any of the officers resided or resorted. I learned it in Williamsburg; I believe at Lord Dunmore’s; and I find in my pocket book of that year (1774.) an entry of the narrative as taken from the mouth of some person whose name however is not noted, nor recollected, precisely in the words stated in the Notes on Virginia. The speech was published in the Virginia gazette of that time: (I have it myself in the volume of gazettes of that year:) and though it was the translation made by the common Interpreter, and in a style by no means elegant, yet it was so admired, that it flew thro’ all the public papers of the continent, and thro’ the magazines and other periodical publications of Great Britain; and those who were boys at that day will now attest that the speech of Logan used to be given them as a school-exercise for repetition. It was not till about 13. or 14. years after the newspaper publications that the Notes on Virginia were published in America. Combating in these the contumelious theory of certain European writers, whose celebrity gave currency and weight to their opinions, that our country from the combined effects of soil and climate, degenerated animal nature, in the general, and particularly the moral faculties of man, I considered the speech of Logan as an apt proof of the contrary, and used it as such: and I copied verbatim the narrative I had taken down in 1774. and the speech as it had been given us in a better translation by Ld. Dunmore. I knew nothing of the Cresaps, and could not possibly have a motive to do them an injury with design. I repeated what thousands had done before, on as good authority as we have for most of the facts we learn through life, and such as to this moment I have seen no reason to doubt. That any body questioned it, was never suspected by me till I saw the letter of Mr. Martin in the Baltimore paper. I endeavored then to recollect who among my cotemporaries, of the same circle of society, and consequently of the same recollections, might still be alive. Three and twenty years of death and dispersion had left very few. I remembered however that General Gibson was still living and knew that he had been the translater of the speech. I wrote to him immediately. He, in answer, declares to me that he was the very person sent by Ld. Dunmore to the Indian town, that after he had delivered his message there, Logan took  him out to a neighboring wood, sat down with him, and rehearsing with tears the catastrophe of his family, gave him that speech for Ld. Dunmore; that he carried it to Ld. Dunmore, translated it for him, has turned to it in the Encyclopedia, as taken from the Notes on Virginia, and finds that it was his translation I had used, with only two or three verbal variations of no importance. These I suppose had arisen in the course of successive copies. I cite General Gibson’s letter by memory, not having it with me; but I am sure I cite it substantially right. It establishes unquestionably that the speech of Logan is genuine: and that being established, it is Logan himself who is author of all the important facts. ‘Colo. Cresap, says he, in cold blood and unprovoked, murdered all the relations of Logan, not sparing even my women and children. There runs not a drop of my blood in the veins of any living creature.’ The person, and the fact, in all it’s material circumstances, are here given by Logan himself. Genl. Gibson indeed says that the title was mistaken: that Cresap was a Captain, and not a Colonel. This was Logan’s mistake. He also observes that it was on a water of the Kanhaway, and not on the Kanhaway itself that his family was killed. This is an error which has crept into the traditionary account: but surely of little moment in the moral view of the subject. The material question is Was Logan’s family murdered, and by whom? That it was murdered, has not I believe been denied. That it was by one of the Cresaps, Logan affirms. This is a question which concerns the memories of Logan and Cresap; to the issue of which I am as indifferent as if I had never heard the name of either. I have begun and shall continue to enquire into the evidence, additional to Logan’s, on which the fact was founded. Little indeed can now be heard of, and that little dispersed and distant. If it shall appear on enquiry that Logan has been wrong in charging Cresap with the murder of his family, I will do justice to the memory of Cresap, as far as I have contributed to the injury by believing and repeating what others had believed and repeated before me. If on the other hand, I find that Logan was right in his charge, I will vindicate as far as my suffrage may go, the truth of a Chief, whose talents and misfortunes have attached to him the respect and commiseration of the world.  
I have gone, my dear Sir, into this lengthy detail to satisfy a mind, in the candour and rectitude of which I have the highest confidence. So far as you may incline to use the communication for rectifying the judgments of those who are willing to see things truly as they are, you are free to use it. But I pray that no confidence which you may repose in any one may induce you to let it go out of your hands so as to get into a newspaper. Against a contest in that field I am entirely decided.  I feel extraordinary gratification indeed in addressing this letter to you,  with whom shades of difference in political sentiment have not prevented the interchange of good opinion, nor cut off the friendly offices of society and good correspondence. This political tolerance is the more valued by me who consider social harmony as the first of human felicities, and the happiest moments those which are given to the effusions of the heart. Accept them sincerely, I pray you from one who has the honor to be, with sentiments of high respect and attachment Dear Sir Your most obedient &amp; most humble servt

“ DEAR SIR,  
  
66 Mr. Tazewell hascommunicate  
ed to me the inquiries you have  
been so kind as to make, relative  
to a passage in the Notes on Vir-  
ginia, which has lately excited  
some newspaper publications. I  
feel, with great sensibility, the in-  
terest you take in this business,  
and, with pleasure, go into expla-  
nations with one whose objects I  
know to be truth and justice alone.  
Had Mr. Martin thought proper to  
suggest to me, that doubts might  
be entertained of the transaction  
respecting Lox gan, as stated in the  
Notes on Virginia, and to inquire  
on what grounds that statement  
was founded, I should have felt  
myself obliged, by the inquiry, to  
have informed hie candidly of the  
grounds, and cordially have co-  
operated in every means of investi-  
gating the fact, and correcting  
whatsoever in ik should ! be found  
to have been erroneous. But he  
chose to step at once into the  
newspapers, and in his publications  
there, and the letters he wrote to  
me, adopted a style which forbade  
the respect of au answer. Sensi-  
ble, however, that no aét of his  
could absolve me from the justice  
due to others, as soon as I found  
that the story of Logan could bg

doubted, I determined to inquire  
into it as accurately as the testimo-  
ny remaining, after a lapse of twen-  
ty odd years, would permit; and  
that the result should be made  
known, either in the first new edi-  
tion which should be printed of  
the Notes on Virginia, or by pub-  
lishing an appendix. I thought  
that so far as that work had contri-  
buted to impeach the memory of  
Cresap, by handing on an errone-  
  
ous charge, it was proper it should  
be made the vehicle of retribution.  
Not that I was at all the author of  
the injury. I had only concurred,  
  
with thousands and thousands ot  
others, in believing a transaction  
on authority which merited respect.  
  
For the story of Logan 1s only re-  
peated in the Notes on Virginia,  
precisely as it had been current for  
more than a dozen vears before they  
were published. When Lord Dun-  
more returned from the expedition  
ayvainst the Indians, in 1774, he  
and his officers brought the speech  
of Logan, and related the circum-  
stances connected with it. These  
were so affecting, and the speech  
itself so fine a morsel of eloquence,  
thac it became the theme of every  
conversation, in Williamsburgh  
particularly, and, generally, indeed,  
wheresoever any of the officers re-  
sided or resorted. I learned it in  
Williamsburgh; [ believe at Lord  
Dunmore’s; and I find in my  
pocket-book of that year (1774),  
an entry of the narrative, as taken  
trom the mouth of some person,  
  
whose name, however, is not not-  
ed, nor recolleGled, precisely in  
the words stated in the Notes on  
Virginia. The speech was publish-  
ed iu the Virginia Gazette of that  
time (I have it myself in the vo-  
lume of Gazettes of that year),  
and though in a style by no means  
elegaut, yet It was so admired, that  
it Hew through all the public pa-  
pers of the continent, and through  
the Magazines and other periodical  
  
publications of Great Britain; and  
those who were boys at that day  
will now attest, that the speech of  
Logan used to be given them as  
a school exercise ior repetition.  
It was not till about thirteen or  
jourteen years alter the newspaper  
pubiications, that the Notes on  
Virginia were published in Ameri-  
ca. Combatting, in these, the cons  
tumelious theory of certain Euro-  
pean writers, whose celebrity gave  
currency and weight to their opi-  
nions, that our country, from the  
combined ettfects of soil and climate,  
degeneraicd animal nature, in the  
general, and particularly the moral  
faculties of man; I considered the  
speech of Logan as an apt proof of  
the contrary, and used it as such;  
and I copied, verbatim, the narra-  
tive I had taken down in 1774,  
and the speech as it had been given  
us in a better translation by Lord  
Dunmore. I knew nothing of the  
Cresaps, and could not possibly  
have a motive to do them any in-

thousands had done before, on as

any body questioned it, was never

raries, of the same circle of society,  
and consequently of the same re-

Tiree and twenty years of death  
and dispersion had left very few.  
I remembered, however, that Ge-  
neral Gibson was still living, and  
knew that he had been the transla-  
tor of the speech. I wrote to him  
immediately. He, in answer, de-

of his tainilv, gave him that speeca

his translation L aad used, with only  
  
two or three verbal variations, of  
  
no importance. These, I suppose,  
had arisen in the Course of succes  
sive copies. I cite General Gib-  
sou’s letter by memory, not having  
it with me; but I am sure I cite it  
substantially right. It establishes,  
unquestionably, that the speech of  
Logan is genuine; and that being  
  
established, it is Logan himself who  
is author of all the important facts.  
** Colonel Cresap,” says he, * in  
cold blood, and unprovoked, mur-  
dered all the relations of Logan, not  
sparing even my women and child-  
ren. There runs not a drop of my  
blood in the veins of any living  
creature.” The person and the  
fact, in all its material circumstan-  
ces, are here given by Logan him-  
self. General Gibson, indeed, s says  
that the title was mistaken; that  
Cresap was a captain, and not a  
  
colonel. This was Logan’s mis-  
take. He also observes, that it  
  
was on the Ohio, and not on the  
Kanhaway itself, that his family  
was killed. This is an error which  
has crept into the traditionary ac-  
count; but surely of little moment  
in the moral view of the subject.  
The material question is, Was Lo-  
gan’s family murdered, and by  
whom? ‘That it was murdered,  
has not, I believe, been denied;  
that it was by one of the Cresaps,  
Logan afirms. This is a question  
  
which concerns the memories of  
  
Logan and Cresap; to the issue of  
which, I am as indifferent as if I  
had never heard the name of either.  
I have begun and shall continue to  
inquire into the evidence addition;

of the narrative, as taken from the mouth of some person, whose  
name, however, is not noted, nor recollected, precisely in the words  
stated in the Notes on Virginia. The speech was published in the  
Virginia Gazette of that time, (I have it myself in the volume of ga-  
zettes of that year) and though in a style by no means elegant, yet it  
was so admired, that it flew through all the public papers of the con-  
tinent, and through the magazines and other periodical publications  
of Great Britain ; and those who were boys at that day will now at-  
test, that the speech of Logan used to be given them as a school ex-  
ercise for repetition. It was not till about thirteen or fourteen years  
after the newspaper publications, that the Notes on Virginia were  
published in America. Combating in these, the contumelious theory  
of certain European writers, whose celebrity gave currency and  
weight to their opinions, that our country, from the combined effects  
of soil and climate, degenerated animal nature, in the general, and  
particularly the moral faculties of man, I considered the speech of  
Logan as an apt proof of the contrary, and used it as such; and I  
copied, verbatim, the narrative I had taken down in 1774, and the  
speech as it had been given us in a better translation by lord Dun-  
more. I knew nothing of the Cresaps, and could not possibly have  
a motive to do them an injury with design. I repeated what thou-  
sands had done before, on as good authority as we have for most of  
the facts we learn through life, and such as, to this moment, I have  
seen no reason to doubt. That any body questioned it, was never  
suspected by me, till I saw the letter of Mr. Martin in the Baltimore  
paper. I endeavored then to recollect who among my contempora-  
ries, of the same circle of society, and consequently of the same recol-  
lections, might still be alive. Three and twenty years of death and  
dispersion had left very few. I remembered, however, that general  
Gibson was still living, and knew that he had been the translator of  
the speech. I wrote to him immediately. He, in answer, declares to  
me, that he was the very person sent by lord Dunmore to the Indian  
town; that, after he had delivered his message there, Logan took  
him out to a neighboring wood; sat down with him, and rehearsing,  
with tears, the catastrophe of his family, gave him that speech for  
lord Dunmore ; that he carried it to lord Dunmore; translated it for  
him ; has turned to it in the Encylopedia, as taken from the Notes on  
Virginia, and finds that it was his translation I had used, with only  
two or three verbal variations of no importance. These, I suppose,  
had arisen in the course of successive copies. I cite general Gibson’s  
letter by memory, not having it with me; but I am sure I cite it sub-  
stantially right. It establishes unquestionably, that the speech of Lo-  
gan is genuine ; and that being established, it is Logan himself wha  
is author of all the important facts.”’

simply my own conjecture. Mr. Jefferson said  
that ‘‘ the speech of Logan was so fine a morsel of  
eloquence that it became the theme of every con-  
versation in Williamsburg, and wherever any of  
Dunmore’s officers resided or resorted. I learned  
it, he said, in Williamsburg, I believe, at Lord  
Dunmore’s, and I find in my pocket-book of 1774,  
an entry of the narrative as taken from the mouth  
of some person whose name, however, is not noted  
nor recollected, precisely in the words stated in  
the ‘* Notes on Virginia.”’  
  
Colonel, afterwards Gen. Gibson, was a man

“Had Mr. Martin thought proper to suggest to  
me that doubts might be entertained of the trans-  
action respecting Logan, and to inquire on what  
grounds that statement was founded, I should have  
felt myself obliged by the inquiry, have informed  
him candidly of the grounds, and cordially have  
coéperated in any means of investigating the fact,  
and correcting whatsoever in it should be found to  
have been erroneous. . . . The material question  
is, was Logan’s family murdered, and by whom?  
  
‘¢ That it was murdered has not, I believe, been  
denied ; that it was by one of the Cresaps, Logan  
affirms. This is a question which concerns the  
memories of Logan and Cresap, to the issue of  
which I am as indifferent as if I had never heard  
the name of either. I have begun and shall con-  
tinue to inquire into the evidence, additional to  
Logan’s, on which the fact was founded.  
  
‘‘TIf it shall appear on inquiry that Logan has  
been wrong in charging Cresap with the murder  
of his family, I will do justice to the memory of  
Cresap as far as I have contributed to the injury,  
by believing and repeating what others had be-  
lieved and repeated before me. If, on the other  
hand, I find that Logan was right in his charge,  
I will vindicate, as far as my suffrage may go, the  
truth of a Chief, whose talents and misfortune  
have attached to him the respect and commisera-
