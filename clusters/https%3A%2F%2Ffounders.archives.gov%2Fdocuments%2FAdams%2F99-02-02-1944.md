Instead of receiving the explanations respectfully tendered by the Government of the Government of the United States, the Directory has declared to Mr. Monroe, though his powers had then terminated that they will not receive nor acknowledge another Minister Plenipotentiary from the United States, until the greivances of which France has complained have been redressed. The personal treatment which Mr. Pinckney received in Paris was moreover offensive, and a violation of the law of Nations;—it is now understood that he has received orders to quit the Territories of the French Republic.

, attempts ought to be made by specifications, to restrain the exercise of arbitrary discretion. The result of these reflections is, that it ought to be an ultimatum to concede no commercial rights secured to neutral nations, by the European Law of Nations.  
Question 3d. What Articles of the Treaty of Alliance and of the Treaty of Commerce with France, should be proposed to be abolished?  
Answer. If a review of the existing Treaties shall be proposed by France, it will be proper to propose an abolition of the guaranty in the eleventh Article of the Treaty of Alliance. This stipulation must hereafter perpetually operate against the United States;—France is becoming more military even than formerly, and the general state of things in Europe leads to a belief, that wars will for a long time be frequent;—a guaranty of the Liberty, Sovereignity, Independence &amp; Territorial Possessions of the United States by France, will give us no additional security;—on the contrary our guaranty of the possessions of France in America, perpetually exposes us to the risque &amp; expence of war, or the dishonor of violating our faith.  
But in proportion as we are interested in being discharged from this engagement, France will feel the influence of an opposite Interest, accordingly we see that a “reciprocal guaranty” of possessions was proposed in Mr. Genets instructions to be “an essential clause in the new Treaty” on the ground “That it nearly concerned the peace &amp; prosperity of the French nation that a people whose resources increase beyond all calculation, and whom nature had placed so near their rich Colonies, should become interested by their own engagements in the preservation of these Islands”.  
There being but little ground to expect that France will agree to the abolition of this stipulation, it remains to be considered whether it be susceptible of beneficial modifications.  
The existing engagement is of that kind which is called a general guaranty by the Writers on the Law of Nations; of course the casus federis can never occur, except in a defensive War.  
The nature of this obligation is understood to be that when a war exists really &amp; truly defensive, the engaging nation is bound to furnish an effectual and adequate defence, in co-operation with the power attacked—:It follows, that the nation may be required in some circumstances to bring forward its whole force.  
The nature, degree &amp; quantity of succour not being ascertained, engagements of this kind are dangerous, on account of their uncertainty—There is always hazard of doing too much or too little, and of course of being involved in involuntary Rupture.  
Specific Succours, have the advantage of being certain, and less liable to occasion War, but they allow no latitude for the exercise of Judgment &amp; discretion as is the case with a general guaranty.

ion unless it may be deemed to bear a construction, that France has thereby renounced the right of conquering in future Wars, Canada or Louisiana for herself.  
France has repeatedly contended, that the imposition of Fifty Cents per Ton on French Vessels arriving in the United States is contrary to the fifth article of the Treaty of Commerce. The Arguments in support of this pretension are unknown, but it is presumed to be unfounded—The reciprocal right of laying duties equal to those imposed on the most favored Nations, and without any other restriction, sums to be settled by the third &amp; fourth Articles. The fifth Article appears to have been intended merely to define or qualify the rights of American Vessels in France. It is however desireable that the question be understood &amp; properly settled, but the introduction of a principle of discrimination between the duties on Vessels of different foreign nations, and in derogation of the power of Congress to raise revenue by uniform duties on any objects—whatever, ought not to be lightly hazarded.

en. The object of the Government is to produce a successful result; accordingly that stile &amp; manner of proceeding will be best, which shall most directly tend to this end. It is not impossible, that there may be such a change of &amp; and measures in France, as will render it politic to speak of the treatment we have received with severity—On the other hand the French Government may be determined to frustrate the negociation, and throw the odium on this Country, in which case, anything like warmth or harshness would be made the pretext. If things remain in their present situation, the style of remonstrance ought to unite as much as possible, calm dignity with simplicity; force of sentiment with mildness of expression; and be calculated to impress an idea of inflexible perseverance, rather than of distrust or confidence.—A

The tenth Article of the Treaty with Great Britain, though much complained of, appears to be liable to no just objection, and one proper to be adopted in a Treaty with France.  
As the United States are rapidly rising in power &amp; resources, it appears to be proper to avoid entering into indefinite obligations, other than such as are founded merely in Morality &amp; Justice, and in their own nature of perpetual obligation—The time cannot be distant, when the United States, will be able to negociate with Europe on more advantageous terms tha

ing all our treaties with France. In ſuch reviſion the firſt object  
that will attract your attention is the reciprocal guaranty in the  
11th article of the treaty of alliance. This guaranty we are per-  
ſectly willing to renounce. The guarany by France of the liberty,  
ſovereignty, and independence of the United States will add noth-

The foregoing Articles being thoſe which the French Go-

plaints, they have naturally been firſt brought to view. But  
the propoſed alterations and arrangements ſuggeſt the pro-

reciprocal guaranty in the 11th Article of the Treaty of Alli-  
ance. This guaranty we are perfectly willing to renounce.  
&#x27;The guaranty by France of the Liberty, Sovereignty and In-

The exiſting engagement is of that kind which, by writers  
on the Law of Nations, is called a General Guaranty; of  
courſe caſus fœderis can never except in a Defenſive War.  
The nature of this obligation is underſtood to be, that when a  
War really and truly defenſive exiſts, the engaging Nation is  
bound to furniſh an effectual and adequate defence in co-ope-  
ration with the power attacked : whence it follows, that the  
Natibn may be required, in ſome circumſtances, to bring  
forward its whole force. The nature and extent of the ſuc-  
cours demandable not being aſcertained, engagements of this  
king are dangerous, on accouat of their uncertainty : there is  
always hazard of doing too much or too little, and of courſe  
of being involved in involuntary rupture. |  
Specific ſuccours have the advantage of certainty, and are  
leſs liable to occaſion War. On the other.hand, &#x27;a general  
guaranty allows a latitude for the exerciſe of judgment and

European law of nations.  
  
The foregoing articles being thofe  
which the French government has  
made the oftenfible grounds of its  
principal complaints, they have natu-  
rally been firft brought to view. But  
the iy oe alterations and arrange-  
ments fuggeft the propriety of revi-

fuch revifion, the firft objet that  
will attra&amp; your attention is the reci-  
procal guaranty in the 11th article of  
the treaty of alliance. This guaranty  
we are perfectly willing to renounce.  
The guaranty by France of the liber-  
ty, fovereignty, and independence of  
the United States will add nothing to  
our fecurity, while on the contrary,  
our guaranty of the poffeffions of  
France in America will perpetually

When Mr. Genet was fent as the  
minifter of the French republic to the  
United States, its fituation was em-  
barraffed, and the fuccefs of its mea-  
fures problematical. In fuch circum-  
ftances it was natural that France  
fhould turn her eye to the mutual  
guaranty: and accordingly it was  
required, in Mr. Genet’s inftructions,  
to be “ an effential claufe in the new  
treaty,” which he was to propofe :  
and on the ground that “ it nearly  
concerned the peace and profperity  
of the French nation, that a people  
whofe refources increafe beyond all  
calculation, and whom nature had  
placed fo near their rich colonies,  
fhould become interefted by their own

at fome modification of it.  
  
The exifting engagement is of that  
kind which, by writers on the law of  
nations, is called a general guaranty ;  
of courfe casus federis can never occur  
except in a defensive war. The nature  
of this obligation is underftood to be,  
that when a war really and truly de-  
fensive exifts, the engaging nation is  
bound to furnifh an effectual and ade-  
quate defence in co-operation with  
the power attacked: whence it fol-  
lows that the nation muy be required,  
in fume circumftances, to bring for-  
ward its whole force. The nature  
and extent of the fuccours demand-  
able not being afcertained, engage-  
ments of this kind are dangerous on  
account of their uncertainty: there  
is always hazard of doing too much  
or too little, and of courfe of being  
involved in involuntary rupture.  
  
Specific fuccours have the advantage  
of certainty, and are lefs liable to oc-  
cafion war. On the other hand, a gene-  
ral guaranty allows a latitude for the  
exercife of judgment and difcretion.

cation of it.  
The existing engagement is of that kind  
which by writers on the law of nations, is  
called a general guaranty ; of course the  
! cafus federis can mnever occur except in a  
| defenfive war. The nature of this obliga.  
! tion 1s understood to be, that when a war  
| 7eally and truly defenfive exists, the enga­  
&#x27; ging nation is bound to furnifh an effe&amp;ual  
! and adequate defence in co-operation with  
| the power attacked ; whence 1t follows,  
. that the nation may be required, in some  
{ circumfitances, to bring forward its whole  
force. The nature and extent of the fuc­  
cours demandable not being afcertaified, en­  
gagements of this kind are dangerous on  
account of their uncertainty ; there is al.  
ways hazard of doing too much or too lit­  
tle, and of course of being involved in in.  
voluntary rupture,  
Specific fuccours have&#x27;the advantage of  
certainty, and are less liable to occasion  
war. On the other hand a general gua­  
rantee allows a Jatitude for the exercile of  
5 judémcm and discretion.

Art. 5.&quot; France has repeatedly contended  
that the imposition of 50 cents per tan on  
French veflels arriving in the U. S. is con­  
trary to the sth article of the treaty. The  
arguments in support of this pretension are  
unknown ; but&#x27;it is presumed to be un.  
founded. The reciprocal right of laying  
*¢ duties or imposts otP what nature soever,”  
equal to those imposed on the most favored  
nations, and without any other reftrifions,  
seems 10 be clearly fettled by the 3d and  
ﬁth articles, The sth article appears to  
ave been intended merely to define or  
}uahfy the rights of American vessels in  
rance. It is however desirable that the  
queition be understood and all doubt con­  
cerning it removed. But the introdu&amp;ion  
of a Frinciplc of dilerimination between the  
veflels of different foreign nations and in de­  
rogation of the powers of Congrels to raise  
revenue by uniform duties on any objefls  
whatever, cannot be hazarded. The na­

be considered as inadmissible.
