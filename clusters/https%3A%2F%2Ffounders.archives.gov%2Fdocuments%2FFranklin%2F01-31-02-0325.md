Dear Sir,  
Passy, Feb. 8. 1780  
Your kind Letter of Sept. 27. came to hand but very lately, the Bearer having staid long in Holland.  
I always rejoice to hear of your being still employ’d in Experimental Researches into Nature, and of the Success you meet with. The rapid Progress true Science now makes, occasions my Regretting sometimes that I was born so soon. It is impossible to imagine the Height to which may be carried in a 1000 Years the Power of Man over Matter. We may perhaps learn to deprive large Masses of their Gravity &amp; give them absolute Levity, for the sake of easy Transport. Agriculture may diminish its Labour &amp; double its Produce. All Diseases may by sure means be prevented or cured, not excepting even that of Old Age, and our Lives lengthened at pleasure even beyond the antediluvian Standard. O that moral Science were in as fair a Way of Improvement, that Men would cease to be Wolves to one another, and that human Beings would at length learn what they now improperly call Humanity.—  
I am glad my little Paper on the Aurora Borealis pleas’d. If it should occasion farther Enquiry, &amp; so produce a better Hypothesis, it will not be wholly useless—  
I am ever, with the greatest &amp; most sincere Esteem, Dear Sir, Yours very affectionately  
BF.  
Dr Priestley  
  
  
Separate Paper  
I have considered the Situation of that Person very attentively; I think that with a little help from the Moral Algebra, he might form a better Judgment than any other Person can form for him. But since my Opinion seems to be desired, I give it for continuing to the End of the Term under all the present Disagreeable Circumstances. The Connection will then die a natural Death. No Reason will be expected to be given for the Separation, and of course no Offence taken at Reasons given. The Friendship may still subsist, and in some other way be useful.— The Time diminishes daily, and is usefully employ’d. All human Situations have their Inconveniencies. We feel those that we find in the present, and we neither feel nor see those that exist in another. Hence we make frequent &amp; troublesome Changes without Amendment, and often for the Worse. In my Youth I was Passenger in a little Sloop, descending the River Delaware. There being no Wind, we were obliged, when the Ebb was spent, to cast anchor, and wait for the next. The Heat of the Sun on the Vessel was excessive, the Company Strangers to me &amp; not very agreeable. Near the River Side I saw what I took to be a pleasant green Meadow, in the Middle of which was a large shady Tree, where it strook my Fancy, I could sit &amp; read, having a Book in my Pocket, and pass the Time agreably till the Tide turned. I therefore prevail’d with the Captain to put me ashore. Being landed I found the greatest Part of my Meadow was really a Marsh, in crossing which to come at my Tree, I was up to the Knees in Mire: And I had not plac’d my self under its Shade five Minutes before the Muskitoes in Swarms found me out, attack’d my Legs, Hands &amp; Face, and made my Reading &amp; my Rest impossible: So that I return’d to the Beach, &amp; call’d for the Boat to come and take me aboard again, where I was oblig’d to bear the Heat I had strove to quit, and also the Laugh of the Company.— Similar Cases in the Affairs of Life have since frequently fallen under my Observation.—  
I have had Thoughts of a College for him in America. I know no one who might be more useful to the Publick in the Institution of Youth. But there are possible Unpleasantnesses in that Situation, it cannot be obtain’d but by a too hazardous Voyage at this time for a Family: And the Time for Experiments would be all otherwise engaged.

[Inclosed in the foregoing Letter;  
leing an answer to @ separate paper  
recewed from Dr. Priestley. |  
  
I have considered the situation of  
that person very attentively; I think  
that with a little help from the Moral  
Algelra, he might form a better judg-  
ment than any other person can form  
for him. But since my opinion  
seems to be desired, I give it for con-  
tinuing to the end of the term, under  
all the present disagreeable circum-  
stances: the connection will then  
die a natural death. No reason will  
be expected to be given for the sepa-  
ration, and of course no offence taken  
at reasons given; the friendship may  
still subsist, and in some other way  
be useful. ‘The time diminishes  
daily, and is usefully employed. All  
human situations have their incon-  
veniences; we feel those that we  
find in the present, and we neither  
  
Jeel nor sce those that exist in another.  
  
Hence we make frequent and trouble-  
some changes without amendment,  
and often for the worse. In my  
youth | was passenger in a little  
sloop, descending the River Dela-  
ware. There being no wind, we  
were obliged when the ebb was  
% to cast anchor, and wait for  
the next. ‘The heat of the sun on the  
vessel was excessive, the company  
strangers to me, and not very agree-  
able. Near the river side I saw what  
I took to be a pleasant green meadow,  
in the middle of which was a large  
shady tree, where it struck my fancy

§ could sit and read, (having a book

agreeably till the tide turned ; I there-  
tore prevailed with the captain to put

the greatest part of my meadow was

come at my tree, | was up to my

mvself under its shade five minutes  
before the muskitoes in swarms found  
me out, attacked my legs, hands, and

the beach, and called for the boat

have their inconveniences; we feel those that  
we find in thc present, and we neither feel nor  
see those that exist in another. Hence, we  
make frequent and troublesome changes without

youth I was a passenger in a little sloop, de¬  
scending the river Delaware; there being no  
wind, we were obliged, when the ebb was spent,  
to cast anchor, and to wait for the next. The  
heat of the sun on the vessel was excessive, the  
company strangers to me, and not very agreea¬  
ble. Near the river side, I saw what I took to  
be a pleasant green meadow, in the middle of

some changes without amendment, and frequently

being no wind, we were obliged, when the tide  
was spent, to cast anchor and wait for the next.

A HIT TO THE DISCONTENTED.All  
human situations have their inconven­

the present, and we neither feel nor see  
those that exist in another. Hence we  
often make truoblesome changes without  
amendment, and frequently for the  
worse. In my youth I was a passenger  
in a little sloop descending the Dola

Near the river side I saw what I took

where, it struck my fancy, I could sit  
and read--having a book in my pocket

Father Landon&#x27;s and were waiting to
