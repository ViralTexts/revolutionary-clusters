those sublime lessons of courage, honor, and virtue for which  
we are accustomed to look in poems of that class, we  
might as well seek for similar teachings at the circus or the  
opera-house. ‘The mission of the drama is a far nobler one  
than seems to have been dreamed of in the philosophy of M.  
Dumas : —
