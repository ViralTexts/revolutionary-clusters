Dear Sir,  
Morris Town May 17th 1777.  
  
Under the previledge of friendship, I take the liberty to ask you, what Congress expects I am to do with the many Foreigners they have, at different times, promoted to the Rank of Field Officers? and by the last resolve, two to that of Colonels.  
In making these appointments, it is much to be feared that all the Circumstances attending; are not taken into consideration—To oblige the adventurers of a Nation whom we want to Interest in our Cause, may be one inducement, &amp; to get rid of their importunity, another—but this is viewing the matter by halves, or on one side only—These Men have no attachment or tyes to the Country, further than Interest binds them—they have no Influence—and are ignorant of the language they are to receive &amp; give orders in, consequently great trouble, or much confusion must follow: but this is not the worst, they have not the smallest chance to recruit others, and our Officers thinks it exceedingly hard, after they have toild in this Service, &amp; probably sustaind many losses to have Strangers put over them, whose merit perhaps is not equal to their own; but whose effrontery will take no denial.  
The management of this matter give me leave to add Sir, is a delicate  
  
point, for altho no one will dispute the right of Congress to make appointments, every person will assume the previledge of judging of the propriety of them; &amp; good policy, in my opinion, forbids the disgusting a whole Corps to gratifie the pride of an Individual; for it is by the zeal &amp; activity of our own People that the cause must be supported, and not by a few hungry adventurers—Besides, the error of these Appointments is now clear and manifest, and the views of Congress evidently defeated; for by giving high rank to people of no reputation or Service, you have disgusted their own Country men; or in other words, raised their expectations to an insatiable pitch; for the Man who was a Captain in France, finding another who was only a Subaltern there or perhaps nothing appointed to a Majority with us, extends his views instantly to a Regiment—In like manner the Field Officer can accept of nothing less than a Brigade, &amp; so on, by which means the Man of real Rank &amp; merit, must be excluded, or perhaps your whole Military System disordered. In the mean while I am haunted and teazed to death by the importunity of some &amp; dissatisfaction of others.  
My Ideas in this representation, does not extend to Artillery Officers and Engineers—The first of these will be useful if they do not break in upon the arrangement of that Corps already established by order of Congress. The Second are absolutely necessary, and not to be had here. but proper precaution should be observd in the choice of them, for we have at present in pay, &amp; high Rank two (Frenchmen) who, in my judgment know nothing of the duty of Engineers—Gentn of this profession ought to produce sufficient and authentic testimonials of their skill &amp; knowledge, and not expect that a pompous narrative of their Services, and loss of Papers (the usual excuse) can be a proper Introduction into our Army.  
The freedom, with which I have delivered my Sentiments on this Subject, will, I am perswaded, meet your excuse when I assure you that I have nothing else in view than the good of the Service.  
By the time, Or before this Letter can reach you, Congress will be visited by a person who calls himself Colo. Michael Fabricy a Kovats who according to his own Account is a most valuable Officer from Prussia. What his Credentials are, I know not, but from what little I have seen of him, they ought to be strong to convince me of his real Importance for if his conversations have been faithfully Interpreted he has been caught tripping several times. I am Dr Sir Yr Most Obedt &amp; Affecte Servt

&lt;% Mohkistowk, May 17lhj 1777.  
«DFAR SIR,  
“ Under tbc r.rivilcdgr of friend­  
ship, I h.Uc the liberty t« ask you, what  
Congress expects I am to dc with the  
.o«ii) Foreigners they havt, at different  
times, promoted to.the Rank of Fieid j  
Officers ?—ar.d by the last resolve, two  
to that of Colonels.  
In making these appointments, it is  
much to be feared that :.ll the circum­  
• . # f  
stances attending, are not unen into I  
consideration—To oblige the rdvenlur*  
ere of a Nation whGm wc w ant to inte­  
rest incur Cause, may be one induce­  
ment, and to get rid of their importunity,  
another—but this is viewing the niattei  
by halves, or one side only—These men  
ha*e no attachment or tics to the Coun­  
try, further than Interest binds them—  
they have no Influence—and are igno­  
rant »f the language they arc to receive  
and give Orders in, censequent!}’ great  
trouble, or much confusion must follow :  
but this is not the worst, they have not  
the smallest chance to recruit others,  
and our Officers think it exceedingly  
hard, after they have toiled in this ser­  
vice, and probably sustained many loss*  
i es, to have strangers put over them,  
  
I  
whose merit perhaps is not equal to their  
own ; but who*e effrontery will take no  
denial. &lt;  
. The management of this matter give  
me leave to .ckl Sir, is a delicate point,  
for although no one yill dispute the  
tight ot Congress to make appointment*,  
evory person will ussumethe priviledge  
of judging cf the propriety of them ;  
end good policy, in my opinion, forbids  
the disgusting a whole Corps to gratify  
the prid* of an Individual; for it is by  
the zeal and activity of our own People  
that the cause rnutt he supported, and  
not by a few hungry ad venturers-— Be­  
sides, &#x27;he error of these appointment*  
is now clear and manifest, and the views  
of Congress evidently defeated ; lor by  
giving high rank to people cf no repu­  
tation or service, you hare disgusted  
their own countrymen ; or in other  
words raised their expectations to an in­  
satiable pitch ; for the man who was a  
Captain in France, finding another who  
was only a Sub*Itern there, or perhaps  
nothing, appointed to a Majority with  
us, extends hi* views instantly to a Re­  
giment—In like manner the Fie J Offi­  
cer can accept of nothing less than a  
Brigade, and soon, bv which means the  
! °  
i man of real Rank and Merit, must be  
  
excluded, or perhaps your whole Mill*  
Ury Svstem disordered.—In the mean  
while I am haunted and teszed to death  
by the importunity of some v.nd dissa­  
tisfaction of others  
My idei»s in this representation, docs  
not extend to Artillery Officers and  
Engineers—The first of these will be  
usiful if they do not break in upon the  
arrangement of that Corps already es­  
tablished by ordcrof Congress —Ti c se­  
cond are absolutely necessary,k not lobe  
ha l here—but prop* precaution should  
be observed in the choice of them, for  
vc have at present&#x27; in pay. and high  
Rr.ik two (F&#x27;enchn.nnj who, m my  
judgment know nothing of the duty of j  
Engineers—Gentlemen of this profes­  
sion ought to produce sufficient and an&quot;  
tht-ntic t» stifTiomali of their skill and  
knowledge, and cot expect that a pom­  
pous narrative of their Services, ;.nd

The freedom, with which I have de­

strangers put over them, whose merit perhaps is not equal to  
their own, but whose effrontery will take no denial.”

Morristown, May 17, 1777.  
  
Dear Sir: Under the privilege of friendship, I  
tak the liberty to ask, what Congress expect I am  
to do with the many fore.gners they have at different  
times promoted to the rank of field offieersS and,  
by the last resolve, two colonels! In making these  
appointments, it is much to be feared, that all the  
attending circumstances are not taken into con-  
sideration. To oblige the adventurers of a nation  
which we want to interest in our cause, may be one  
inducement; and to get rid of their importunities  
another; but this is viewing tbe matter by halves  
or on one side only. These men have no attach-  
ment or ties (for they bad been but a few days on  
our soil) to the country farther than interest binds  
them; they have no influence and are ignorant of I  
the language they are to receive and give orders  
in, consequently great trouble or much confusion  
must follow. But this is not the worst; they have  
not the smallest chance to recruit others; (because  
they were entire strangers to us and oar language)  
and our officers think it exceedingly hard, after  
they have toiled in this service, and probably sus-  
tained many losses, to have strangers put over  
them whose merit, perhaps, is not equal to their  
own, but whose effrontery will take no denial.  
  
The management of this matter, give me leave to  
add, sir, is a delicate point; for although no one will  
dispute the right of Congress to make appoint-  
ments, every person will assume the privilege of  
judging of the propriety of them; and good policy.  
In my opinion, forbids the disgusting of a whole  
  
corps to gratify the pride of an individual, for it is  
by the seal and activity of oir own pepple that the  
cause must be supported, and not by a few hungry  
adventurers. Besides the error of these appoint

A Pluhp Answer. — W e find the following  
  
ments is row clear and manifist, and the views of  
Congress evidently defeated, for by giving high  
rank to people of no reputation or service, you  
have disgusted their countrymen, or in other  
words, raised their expectation to an insatiable  
* itch. For the man who was Captain in France,  
finding another who was only a subaltern there, or  
perhaps nothing, appointed to a maiority with us,  
extends his views instantly to a regiment; in like  
manner, the field officers can accept nothing less  
than a brigade, and so on, by which means the man  
of real rank and merit must he excluded, or per-  
haps yonr whole military system disordered. In  
the mean time while haunted and teased to death  
by the importunity of some and dissatisfaction of  
others.  
  
My ideas in this representation do not extend to  
artilcry officers and engineers. The first of these  
will be useful, if they do not break in upon the ar-  
rangement of that corps already established by or-  
der of Congress. The second are absolutely ne-  
cessary and not to be had here. Bnt proper pre-  
caution should be observed in the choice of them,  
for we have at present in pay and high rank two  
Frenchmen, who, in my judgment, know nothing  
of the duty of engineers. Gentlemen of this pro-  
fess on ought to produce sufficient, and authentic  
testimonials of their skill and knowledge, and not  
expect that a pomp &gt;us narative of services and loss  
of papers, the usual excuse, can be a proper intro-  
duction into our army. The freedom with which  
I hare delivered my sentiments on this sukiect,  
will, I am persuaded, meet your excuse when I as-  
sure yon tbat I have nothing ctoe in view than the  
good of the service. I am, dear sir, Ac.,
