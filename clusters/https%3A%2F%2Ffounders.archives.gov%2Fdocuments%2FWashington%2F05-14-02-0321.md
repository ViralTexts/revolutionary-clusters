, without the reproach of  
flattery; and it is from the same sources, that the fairest anticipations may be derived  
in favor of the public happiness.  
The United States having taken no part in the War which had embraced in Europe the  
powers with whom they have the most extensive relations, the maintenance of peace was  
justly to be regarded as one of the most important duties of the magistrate charged with  
the faithful execution of the laws. We accordingly witness with approbation and pleasure  
the vigilance with which you have guarded against an interruption of that blessing, by  
your proclamation admonishing our Citizens of the consequences of illicit or hostile  
acts towards the belligerent parties, and promoting by a declaration of the existing  
legal state of things, an easier admission of our right to the immunities belonging to  
our situation.  
The connexion of the United States with Europe has evidently become extremely  
interesting. The communications which remain to be exhibited to us, will, no doubt,  
assist in giving us a fuller view of the subject, and in guiding our deliberations to  
such results as may comport with the rights and true interests of our Country.  
We learn, with deep regret, that the measures dictated by a love of peace, for  
obtaining an amicable termination of the afflicting war on our frontier, have been  
frustrated; and that a resort to offensive measures has again become necessary. As the latter, however, must be rendered more  
satisfactory in proportion to the solicitude for peace manifested by the former, it is  
to be hoped they will be pursued under the better auspices on that  
account, &amp; be finally crowned with more happy success.  
In relation to the particular tribes of Indians, against whom offensive measures have  
been prohibited, as well as all the other important  
subjects which you have presented to our view, we shall bestow the attention which they  
claim. We cannot, however, refrain at this time, from particularly expressing our  
concurrence in your anxiety for the regular discharge of the public debts, as fast as  
circumstances and events will permit; and in the policy of removing any impediments that  
may be found in the way of a faithful representation of public proceedings throughout  
the United States, being persuaded, with you, that on  
no subject more than the former, can delay be more injurious, or an œconomy of time more  
valuable; and that with respect to the latter, no resource is so firm for the Government  
of the United States, as the affections of the people, guided by an enlightened  
policy.  
Throughout our deliberations we shall endeavour to cherish every sentiment which may  
contribute to render them conducive to the dignity, as well as to the welfare of the  
United States; and we join with you, in imploring that Being on whose will the fate of  
nations depends, to crown with success our mutual endeavors. Signed by order, and in  
behalf of the House
