.  
I was induced, in the course of my journey thro’ the South of France, to pay very particular attention to the objects of their culture, because the resemblance of their climate to that of the Southern parts of the United states, authorizes us to presume we may adopt any of their articles of culture which we would wish for. We should not wish for their wines, tho they are good and abundant. The culture of the vine is not desireable in lands capable of producing any thing else. It is a species of gambling, and of  desperate gambling too, wherein, whether you make much or nothing, you are equally ruined. The middling crop alone is the saving point, and that the seasons seldom hit. Accordingly we see much wretchedness amidst this class of cultivators. Wine too is so cheap in these countries that a labourer with us, employed in the culture of any other article, may exchange it for wine, more and better than he could raise himself. It is a resource for a country, the whole of whose good soil is otherwise employed, and which still has some barren spots and a surplus of population to employ on them. There the vine is good, because it is something in the place of nothing. It may become a resource to us at a still earlier period: when the increase of population shall increase our productions beyond the demand for them both at home and abroad. Instead of going on to make a useless surplus of them, we may employ our supernumerary hands on the vine. But that period is not yet arrived.  
The Almond tree is also so precarious that none can depend for subsistence on it’s produce, but persons of capital.  
The Caper, tho a more tender plant, is more certain in it’s produce, because a mound of earth, of the size of a cucumber hill, thrown over the plant in the fall, protects it effectually against the cold of the winter. When the danger of frost is over in the spring, they uncover it and begin it’s culture. There is a great deal of this in the neighborhood of Toulon. The plants are set about 8. feet apart, and yeild one year with another about 2 ℔. of capers each, worth on the spot 6d. sterl. the pound. They require little culture, and this may be performed either with the plough or hoe. The principal work is the gathering of the fruit, as it forms. Every plant must be picked every other day from the last of June till the middle of October. But this is the work of women and children. The plant does well in any kind of soil, which is dry or even in walls where there is no soil, and they last the life of a man. Toulon would be the proper port to apply for them. I must observe that the preceding details cannot be relied on with the fullest certainty, because in the canton where this plant is cultivated the inhabitants speak no written language, but a medley which I could understand but very imperfectly.  
The fig and the mulberry are so well known in America, that nothing need be said of them. Their culture too is by women and children, and therefore earnestly to be desired in countries where there are slaves. In these, the women and children are often employed in labours disproportioned to their sex and age. By presenting to the master objects of culture, easier and equally beneficial,  all temptation to misemploy them would be removed, and the lot of this tender part of our species be much softened. By varying too the articles of culture, we multiply the chances for making something, and disarm the seasons in a proportionable degree of their calamitous effects.  
The Olive is a tree the least known in America, and yet the most worthy of being known. Of all the gifts of heaven to man, it is next to the most precious, if it be not the most precious. Perhaps it may claim a preference even to bread; because there is such an infinitude of vegetables which it renders a proper and comfortable nourishment. In passing the Alps at the Col de Tende, where they are mere masses of rock, wherever there happens to be a little soil, there are a number of olive trees, and a village supported by them. Take away these trees, and the same ground in corn would not support a single family. A pound of oil which can be bought for 3d. or 4d. sterling is equivalent to many pounds of flesh by the quantity of vegetables it will prepare and render fit and comfortable food. Without this tree the county of Provence and territory of Genoa would not support one half, perhaps not one third, their present inhabitants. The nature of the soil is of little consequence, if it be dry. The trees are planted from 15. to 20. f. apart, and, when tolerably good, will yeild 15. or 20. ℔. of oil yearly, one with another. There are trees which yeild much more. They begin to render good crops at 20. years old, and last till killed by cold, which happens at some time or other even in their best positions in France. But they put out again from their roots. In Italy I am told they have trees 200 years old. They afford an easy but constant employment thro’ the year, and require so little nourishment that, if the soil be fit for any other production, it may be cultivated among the olive trees, without injuring them. The Northern limits of this tree are the mountains of the Cevennes from about the meridian of Carcassonne to the Rhone, and from thence the Alps and Appennines as far as Genoa, I know, and how much farther I am not informed. The shelter of these mountains may be considered as equivalent to a degree and a half of latitude at least; because Westward of the commencement of the Cevennes there are no olive trees in 43½° or even 43.° of latitude; whereas we find them now on the Rhone at Pierrelatte in 44½° and formerly they were at Tains, above the mouth of the Isere in 45.° sheltered by the near approach of the Cevennes and Alps, which only leave there a passage for the Rhone. Whether such a shelter exists, or not, in the states of South Carolina and Georgia, I know not. But this we  may say, either that it exists, or that it is not necessary there: because we know that they produce the orange in open air; and wherever the Orange will stand at all, experience shews that the Olive will stand well; being a hardier tree. Notwithstanding the great quantities of oil made in France, they have not enough for their own consumption, and therefore import from other countries. This is an article, the consumption of which will always keep pace with it’s production. Raise it; and it begets it’s own demand. Little is carried to America because Europe has it not to spare. We therefore have not learnt the use of it. But cover the Southern states with it, and every man will become a consumer of oil, within whose reach it can be brought in point of price. If the memory of those persons is held in great respect in South Carolina who introduced there the culture of rice, a plant which sows life and death with almost equal hand, what obligations would be due to him who should introduce the Olive tree, and set the example of it’s culture! Were the owner of slaves to view it only as the means of bettering their condition, how much would he better that by planting one of those trees for every slave he possessed! Having been myself an eyewitness to the blessings which this tree sheds on the poor, I never had my wishes so kindled for the introduction of any article of new culture into our own country. South Carolina and Georgia appear to me to be the states wherein it’s success, in favorable positions at least, could not be doubted, and I flattered myself it would come within the views of the society for agriculture to begin the experiments which are to prove it’s practicability. Carcassonne is the place from which the plants may be most certainly and cheaply obtained. They can be sent from thence by water to Bordeaux, where they may be embarked on vessels bound for Charleston. There is too little intercourse between Charleston and Marseilles to propose this as the port of exportation. I offer my service to the society for the obtaining and forwarding any number of plants which may be desired.  
Before I quit the subject of climates, and the plants adapted to them, I will add as a matter of curiosity, and of some utility too, that my journey thro’ the Southern parts of France and the territory of Genoa, but still more the crossing of the Alps, enabled me to form a scale of the tenderer plants, and to arrange them according to their different powers of resisting cold. In passing the Alps at the Col de Tende, we cross three very high mountains successively. In ascending, we lose these plants one after another as we rise and find them again in the contrary order, as we descend on  the other side, and this is repeated three times. Their order, proceeding from the tenderest to the hardiest, is as follows: Caper, Orange, Palm, Aloe, Olive, Pomegranate, Walnut, Fig, Almond. But this must be understood of the plant only: for as to the fruit, the order is somewhat different. The Caper, for example, is the tenderest plant, yet, being so easily protected, it is among the most certain in it’s fruit. The Almond, the hardiest plant, loses it’s fruit the oftenest, on account of it’s forwardness. The Palm, hardier than the Caper and Orange, never produces perfect fruit here.

‘¢ T was induced, in the course of my journey through the south  
of France, to pay very particular attention to the objects of their  
culture ; because the resemblance of their climate to that of the  
southern parts of the United-States, authorizes us to presume  
we may adopt any of their articles of culture, which we would  
wish for. We should not wish for their wines, though they ar-  
good and abundant. The culture of the vine is not desirable in  
lands capable of producing any thing else. It is a species of  
gambling, and of desperate gambling too, wherein, whether you  
make much or nothing you are equally ruined. ‘The middling  
crop alone is the saving point: and that the seasons seldom hit.  
Accordingly we see much wretchedness amidst this class of cu!  
tivators. Wine too is so cheap in these countries, that a labour  
er with us, employed in the culture of any other article, may ex-  
change it for wine, more and better than he could raise himself.

It is a resource for a country, the whole of whose good soil is  
otherwise employed, and which still has some barren spots, and  
a surplus of population to employ onthem. There the vine is good,  
because it is something in the place of nothing. It may become  
a resource to us at a still earlier period, when the increase of po-  
pulation shall increase our productions beyond the demand for  
them, both at home and abroad. Instead of going on to make  
an useless surplus of them, we may employ our supernumerary  
hands on the vine. But that period is not yet arrived.*  
  
The almond tree is also so precarious, that none can depend  
for subsistance on its produce, but persons of capital.  
  
The caper, though a more tender plant, is more certain in its  
produce ; because a mound of earth, of the size of a cucumber  
hill, thrown over the plant in the fall, protects it effectually against  
the cold of the winter. When the danger of frost is over in the  
spring, they uncover it, and begin its culture. There is a great  
deal of this in the neighbourhood of Toulon. The plants are set  
about eight feet apart, and yield one year with another about two  
pound of capers each, worth on the spot six-pence sterling the  
pound. They require little culture ; and this may be performed  
either with the plough or hoe. The principle work is the gath-  
ering of the fruit, as it forms. Every plant must be picked eve-  
ry other day from the last of June till the middle of October.  
But this is the work of women and children. This plant does  
well in any kind of soil, which is dry; or even in walls, where  
there is no soil; and they last the life of aman. ‘Toulon would  
be the proper port to apply for them. I must observe that the

because in the canton, where this plant is cultivated, the inhabit-

derstand but very impertfectly.*  
  
“ The fig and the mulberry are so well known in America, that  
nothing need be said of them. Their culture too is by women  
and children, and therefore earnestly to be desired in countries,  
where there are slaves. In these the women and children are  
often employed in labours disproportioned to their sex and age.  
By presenting to their master objects of culture, easier and equal-  
ly beneficial, all temptation to misemploy them would be remov-  
ed, and the lot of this tender part of our species be much sof-  
tened. By varying too the articles of culture, we multiply the  
chances of making something, and disarm the seasons, in a pro-  
portionable degree, of their calamitous effects.  
  
“ The olive tree is the least known in America, and yet the  
most worthy of being known. Of all the gifts of Heaven to man,  
it is next to the most precious, if it be not the most precious.  
Perhaps it may claim a preference even to bread ; because there  
is such an infinitude of vegetables, which it renders a proper and  
comfortable nourishment. In passing the Alps at the Col de  
Tende, where they are mere masses of rock, wherever there hap-  
pen to be a little soil, there are a number of olive trees, and a  
village supported by them. Take away these trees, and the same  
ground in corn would not support a single family. A pound of  
oil, which can be bought for 3d. or 4d. sterling, is equivalent to  
many pounds of flesh, by the quantity of vegetables it will pre-  
pare, and render fit and comfortable food. Without this tree  
the county of Provence, and territory of Genoa would not sup-  
port one half, perhaps not one third, of their present inhabitants.  
The nature of the soil is of little consequence, if it be dry. The  
trees are planted from 15 to 20 feet apart, and when tolerably  
good will yield 15 or 20 pound of oil yearly, one with another.

There are trees, which yield much more. They begin to render-  
good crops at 20 years old, and last ’till killed by cold, which  
happens at some time or other, even in their best positions in  
France: but they put out again from their roots. In Italy, I am  
told, they have trees 200 years old. They afford an easy, but  
  
constant employment through the year, and require so little nour-  
  
ishment, that, if the soil be fit for any other production, it may  
be cultivated among the olive-trees, without injuring them. The  
northern limits of this tree are the mountains of the Cevennes  
from about the meridian of Carcassonne to the Rhone ; and from  
thence the Alps and Appenines as far as Genoa, I know, and  
how much farther I am not informed. The shelter of these  
mountains may be considered as equivalent to a degree and an  
half of latitude at least ; because westward of the commencement  
of the Cevennes, there are no olive-trees in 43°}, or even 43°,  
of latitude ; whereas we find them now on the Rhone at Pierre-  
latte in 44°}, and formerly they were at Tains, above the mouth  
of the Isere in 45°, sheltered by the near approach of the Ce-  
vennes and Alps, which only leave there a passage for the Khone.  
Whether such a shelter exists, or not, in the states of South  
Carolina and Georgia, I know not. But this we may say, that  
cither it exists, or that it is not necessary there—because we  
know that they produce the orange in open air; and wherever  
the orange will stand at all, experience shews the olive will stand  
well, being a hardier tree. Notwithstanding the great quantity  
of oil made in France, they have not enough for their own con-  
sumption, and therefore import from other countries. This is an  
article, the consumption of which will always keep pace with its  
production. Raise it, and it begets its own demand. Little is  
carried to America, because Europe has it not to spare, we there-  
fore have not learnt the use of it: But cover the southern states  
with it, and every man will become a consumer of it, within whose  
reach it can be brought in point of price. If the memory of those  
persons is held in great respect in South Carolina, who introduced  
there the culture of rice, a plant which sows life and death with  
almost equal hand, what obligations would be due to him, who

Were the owners of slaves to view it only as the means of bet-  
tering their condition, how much would he better that by plant-  
ing one of those trees for every slave he possessed ! Having been  
myself an eye-witness to the blessings which this tree sheds on  
the poor, I never had my wishes so kindled for the introduction  
of any article of new culture into our own country. South Ca-  
rolina and Georgia appear to me to be the states, wherein its suc-  
cess, in favourable positions at least, could not be doubted ; and  
I flattered myself, it would come within the views of the society  
for agriculture to begin the experiments, which are to prove its  
practicability. Carcassonne is the place, from which the plants  
may be most certainly and cheaply obtained. ‘They can be sent  
from thence by water to Bourdeaux, where they may be embark-  
ed on vessels bound for Charleston. There is too little inter-  
course between Charleston and Marseilles to propose this as the  
port of exportation. I offer my service to the society for the  
obtaining and forwarding apy number of plants, which may be  
desired.  
  
“« Before I quit the subject of climates, and the plants adapted  
to them, I will add, as a matter of curiosity, and of some utility  
too, that my journey through the southern parts of France, and  
the territory of Genoa, but still more the crossing of the Alps,  
enabled me to form a scale of the tenderest plants, and to arrange  
them according to their different powers of resisting the cold. In  
passing the Alps at the Col de Tende, we cross three very high  
mountains successively. In ascending, we lose these plants one  
after another, as we rise, and find them again in the contrary or-  
der, as we descend on the other side ; and this is repeated three  
times. Their order, proceeding from the tenderest to the har-  
diest, is as follows; caper, orange, palm, aloé, olive, pomegra-  
nate, walnut, fig, almond. But this must be understood of the  
plant only: for as to the fruit, the order is somewhat different.  
The caper, for example, is the tenderest plant ; yet, being so easily  
protected, it is among the most certain in its fruit. The almond,  
the hardiest plant, loses its fruit the oftenest, on account of its

ishment, that, if the soil be fit for any other pro-  
duction, it may be cultivated among the oltve-  
trees, without injuring them. The northern  
limits of this tree are tne mountains of the Ce-  
vennes frow about the meridian of Carcassonne  
to the Rhone ; and fron thence the Alps and  
Appeones as far as Genoa, | know, and how  
much farther I am not informed. ‘The shelter  
of these mountains may be considered as equi-  
valent to a degree and an half of latitude at  
least ; because westward of the commencement  
of the Cevennes, there are no olive -trees in  
431°, or even 43°, of latitude; whereas we  
find them now on the Rhone at Pierrelatte in  
4440, and formerly they were at Tains, above  
the mouth of the ies in 452, sheltered by the  
near approach of the Cevennes and Alps, which  
only leave there a passage for the Rhone.  
Whether such a shelter exists, or not, in the  
states of South Carolina and Georgia, 1 know  
not. But this we may say, that either it exists, or  
that itis not necessary there—because we know  
tnat they produce the orange in open air; and  
wherever the orange will stand at all, experi-  
ence shews the olive will siand well, being a  
hardier tree. Notwithstanding the great quan-  
tity of oi! made in France, they have not enough  
fur their own consumption, and therefore im-  
port from other countries ‘This is an article,  
the consumption of which will always keep  
pace with its production. Raise it, and it begets  
its own demand. Little is carried to America,  
because Europe has it not to spire, we there-  
fore have not learnt the use of it: But cover  
the southern states with it, and every man will  
become a cousumer of it, within whose reach it  
can be brought in point of price. If the memo.  
ry of those persons is held in great respect in  
South Carolina, who introduced there the cul-  
ture of rice, a plant which sows life and death  
with almost equal hand, what oblizations would  
be due to him, who should introduce the olive  
tree, and set the example of its culture! Were  
the owners of slaves tu view it only as the means

more the crossing of the Alps, enabled me to  
form a scale of the tenderest plants, and to ar-  
range them according to their diferent powers  
of resisting the cold. In passing the Alps at  
the Col de Tende, we cross three very high  
mouatains successively. Ln ascerding, we lose  
these plants one after another, as we rise, and  
find them again in the contrary order, as we  
descend on the other side; and this is repeated  
three tines. ‘Their order, proceeding frum the  
tenderest to the hardiest, is as follows; caper,  
orange, palin, aloe, olive, pomegranate, waluut,  
fig, almond. But this must be understuod of  
the plantonly : fur as to the fruit, the order is  
somewhat ditlrent. ‘Ihe caper, for example,  
is the tenderest plaut ; yet, being su eastiy pru-  
tected, it is amung the must certain in its fruit.  
Che almond, the hardiest plant, loses its fruit

to be the states wherein its success, in fa-

wut this we may say, that either it exists or

the olive will stand well, and be a much

#### 1843-05-06 &middot; [Maitland, New South Wales](http://dbpedia.org/resource/Maitland%2C_New_South_Wales)

The extract is as follows : &quot;The olive  
is a tree the least known here, and yet  
the most worthy of being known. Of all  
the gifts of Heaven to man, it is next  
to the most precious if it be not the  
most precious. Per-haps it may claim a  
preference even to bread, because there  
is such an infinitude of vegetables  
which it makes a proper and comfortable  
nourishment. In passing the Alps at the  
Col de Tende, where there are mere  
masses of rocks, wherever there happens  
to be a little soil there are a number  
of olive trees, and a village sup-ported  
by them. Take away these trees, and the  
same ground in corn could not support a  
single family. A pound of oil, which can  
be bought for 3d. or 4d. sterling, is  
equivalent to many pounds of flesh, by  
the quantity of vegetables it will  
prepare, and render fit and comfortable  
food. Without this, the country of  
Provence and territory of Genoa could  
not support one half, perhaps not a  
third, of their present inha-bitants.  
The nature of the soil is of little con-  
sequence, if it be dry. The trees are  
planted from fifteen to twenty feet  
apart, and when tolerably good will  
yield fifteen to twenty pounds of oil  
yearly, one with another ; there are  
trees which yield much more. In Italy  
there are trees two hundred years old ;  
they afford an easy but constant  
employment throughout the year, and  
require so little nourishment that, if  
the soil be fit for any other product,  
it maybe cultivated among the olive  
trees without injuring them. We find  
them in 45 degrees latitude near the  
Alps. Wherever the orange will stand at  
all, experience shows the olive will  
stand well, being a hardier tree.  
Notwithstanding the great quantity of  
oil made in France, they have not enough  
for their own consumption, and therefore  
import from other countries. This is an  
article the consumption of which will  
always keep pace with its production.  
Raise it, and it begets its demand.  
Having been an eye-witness to the  
blessing which this tree sheds on the  
poor, I never had my wishes so kindled  
for the introduc-tion of any article of  
new culture into our own country.

distinct varieties of it. The Murray  
valley, the region south of the Dividing  
Range, and Gipps Land, have their well-  
marked climatic difference; and with  
such a range of opportunity, though  
within so small a compass, it is  
doubtful if there is anything which can  
be &quot;grown anywhere in the temperate zone  
which might not be grown successfully  
here. With so much temptation for it,  
judicious experiment I ought to be far  
more frequent than it is. \ The olive,  
for instance, might have been i  
established before now in the Murray  
country. Wherever the orange will stand  
at all, experience shows that the |  
olive will stand well, being a hardier  
tree. . . v The slow growth of the old  
varieties discouraged  
their,transplantation, but some years  
ago a new variety was introduced into  
Prance and parts of Spain and Portugal,  
and this, we are told, yields an  
abundant crop of fruit the second year  
after planting. The fruit is larger than  
that of the common olive, is of a fin

follows : “ Of all the gifts of heaven to man, the olive is  
next to the most precioys, if it be not the most pre-  
cious. Perhaps it may claim a preference to even  
bread, because there is such an Infinitude of vegetables  
which the oil renders a profitable and comfortable nour-  
ishment. In passing the Alps at the Col de Tende, where  
they are mere masses of rocks, wherever there happens  
to be a little soil there are olive trees and a village sup-  
ported by them. Take away these trees, and the same  
ground planted in corn would not support a single fam-  
ily. A pound of oil is equal to many pounds of flesh, by  
the quantity of flesh it will render palatable for food.  
Without this tree the country of Provence and the ter-  
ritory of Genoa would not support one-half, perhaps not  
one-third, their present inhabitants. The nature of the  
soll is of little consequence if it be dry. The trees yiel4  
from 15 to 20 pounds of oll yearly, one with another.  
There are trees which yield much more. Thisis an ar-  
ticle the consumption of which will always keep pace  
with its production. Raise ttand it begets its own de-  
mand. Cover the Southern [States with it and every  
man will become a consumer of oil within whose reach  
it can be brought in point of price. Having been myself  
an eye-witness to the blessings which this tree sheds  
on the poor, I never had my wishes so kindled for the  
introduction of any article of new culture into our  
country.”
