Sir  
Head Quarters June 6. 1783  
  
Before I make a reply to the Subject of the Address of the Generals and Officers Commanding the Regiments and Corps of this Army presented by yourself yesterday I intreat that those Gentlemen will accept my warmest acknowledgements for the confidence they  
have been pleased to repose in me, they may be assured it shall never be abused—and I beg they will be persuaded that as no man can possibly be better acquainted than I am with the past merits and services of the Army, so no one can possibly be more strongly impressed with  
their present ineligible situation, feel a keener sensibility at their distresses, or more ardently desire to alleviate or remove them—but it would be unnecessary perhaps to enter into a detail of what I have done, &amp; what I am still attempting to do in order to assist in  
the accomplishment of this interesting purpose—let it be sufficient to observe, I do not yet despair of success; for I am perfectly convinced that the States cannot without involving themselves in National bank ruptcy &amp; ruin refuse to comply with the Requisitions of  
Congress: who, it must be acknowledged, have done every thing in their power to obtain ample and compleat Justice for the Army, and whose great object in the present measure undoubtedly was, by a Reduction of expence to enable the Financier to make the three months Payment to  
the Army, which on all hands has been agreed to be absolutely &amp; indispensibly necessary—to explain this Matter. I beg leave to insert an extract of a Letter from the Superintendant of Finance dated the 29 Ulto.  
&quot;It is now above a Month since the Committee conferred with me on that Subject, and I then told them no Payment could be made to the Army but by means of a Paper Anticipation and unless our Expenditures were immediately and considerably reduced even that  
could not be done—Our Expenditures have nevertheless been continued and our Revenues lessen the States growing daily more and more remiss in their Collections, the Consequence is that I cannot make Payment in the manner first intended the Notes issued for this purpose would  
have been payable at two four and Six Months from the date, but at present they will be all at Six Months and even that will soon become impracticable unless our Expences be immediately curtailed.  
I shall cause such Notes to be issued for the three Months Pay to the Army and I must intreat, Sir, that every influence be used with the States to absorb them together with my other engagements by Taxation.&quot;  
Three days ago a messenger was dispatched by me to urge the necessity of forwarding these Notes with the greatest possible expedition.  
Under this State of circumstances I need scarcely add, that the expence of every day in feeding the whole Army will add very considerably to the inability of the public to discharge the debts already incurred, at least for a considerable time to come.  
Altho’ the Officers of the Army very well know my official situation, that I am only a servant of the Public and that it is not for me to dispense with Orders which it is my duty to carry into execution, Yet as furloughs in all Services are considered as a  
Matter of indulgence &amp; not of compulsion, as Congress I am persuaded entertain the best disposition towards the Army, and as I apprehend in a very short time the two principal Articles of complaint will be removed—until the further pleasure of Congress can be known I  
shall not hesitate to comply with the wishes of the Army under these reservations only, that Officers sufficient to conduct the Men who choose to receive furloughs will attend them either on furlough or by detachment, the propriety &amp; necessity of this measure must be  
obvious to all, it need not therefore be enforced—And with regard to the Non Commisd Officers &amp; Privates such as from a peculiarity of circumstances wish not to receive furloughs at this time will give in their names by 12 o’Clock tomorrow to the Commanding Officers of  
their Regiments that on a Report to the Adjutant General an equal number of Men engaged for three Years may be furloughed which will make the saving of expence exactly the same to the public.  
I cannot but hope the Notes will soon arrive &amp; that the settlement of accounts may be completed by the assistance of the Pay Masters in a very few days, in the mean time I shall have the honor of laying the sentiments of the Generals &amp; Officers  
Commanding Regiments and Corps before Congress—they are expressed in such a decent candid &amp; effecting manner that I am certain every mark of attention will be paid to them. I have the honor to be with the highest esteem &amp; regard Sir Your very Obedt Servt

Pleaſed to repoſe in me ; they may be affured it ſhall never be abuſed :  
and I beg they will be perſuaded, that as no man can poffibly be better  
acquainted than I am with the paſt merits and ſervices of the army, ſono  
one can poſſibly be more ſlrongly impreſſed with their preſent ineligible ſi-  
tuation, feel a keener fenſibility at their diſtrefles, or more ardently deſire  
to alleviate or remove them, ---but ĩt would{be unnecrflary perhaps, to en-  
ter into a detail of what I have done, and what I am till attempting to do,  
in order to afliſt in the accompliſhment of this intereſting purpoſe, ---let ir  
be ſufficient to obſerve, I do not yet deſpair of ſucceſs ; forl am perſectiy  
convinced that the ſlates candot, without involving themſelves in nati-  
onal bankruptcy and ruin, refuſe to comply with the requititions of Con-

great object in the preſent meaſure undoubtedly was, by a reduction of  
expence to enable the Financier to make the three months payment to  
the army, which on all hands has been agreed to be abſolutely and in-

Sire, Head Qu urters, Fune 6, 1783.  
  
BEFORE I make a reply to the fubjeét of  
the addrefs of the generals and officers com-  
manding the regiments and corps of this ar-  
my, prefented by yourfelf yefterday, I in-  
treat, that chofe gentlemen will accept my  
warmeft acknowledgement for the confi-  
den&lt;e they have been ;Jeafed to repofe in  
me; they may be aflured it fhall never be  
abufed : “and I bez they will be perfuaded,  
thac as no unan can poffibly be better ace  
  
uainted than I an with the paft mer&#x27;ts and  
  
rvices of the army, fo nv one can poflibiy  
be more firongly impreffed with their pre-  
fent incligible fituation, teel a keener fenfi-  
bility at their diftreffes, or more ardently de-  
fire to alleviate er remove them—but it  
would be unneceflary, perhaps, to enter in-  
ro a deta:l of what I have done, and what I  
am fiiil attempting to do, in order to affift  
in the accomplifhment of this interefting  
purpofe—let it be fufficient to obferve, I do  
not yet defpair of fuccefs; for 1 am perfeAly  
convinced that the States cannot, without  
involving themfelves in national bankruptcy  
andruin, refufe to comply wich the requifi-  
tions of Congrefs, who, it muft be acknow-  
Jedged, have done every thing in their  
power to obtain ample and complete juftice  
for the army, and whofe great obje&amp; in the  
prefent meafure undoubtediy was, by a re-  
duction of expence to enable the financier to  
make the three mouths payment to the ar-  
my, which on all hands has been agreed to  
be abfolutely and indifperfab!y neceffary,  
To explain this matter, f beg leave to infert  
an extract of a leiter fromthe fuperintendant  
of finance, dated the 29th ult.  
  
6 It :s now above a month fince the com-  
mittee conferred with me on that fubjeé,  
and I then tojd them no payment could be  
made to the drmy but by m:ans of a paper  
anticipation; and unlefs our expenditures  
were immediately and confiderably reduced,  
even that could not be done. Our expendi-*  
tures have neverchelefs been continued, and  
our revenues leffen; ‘he State$ growing daily  
more and More rem:fs in their collections,  
The confiquence is, that I cannot make pay-  
ment in‘ the manner firft intended. The  
notes iffued for this purpofe would have been  
payable at two, four, and fix months from the  
date, but at prefeut they will be at fix  
  
Authentic Papers relative to American Affairs.

practicable, unlefs our expences be immedis  
ately corta&#x27;led TAP  
  
¢¢ 1 thall caufe fuch notes to be iffued for  
three months pay tothe army; and | muft  
intieat, Sir, that every influcnce be ufed  
with the States to abtorb them tog: ther with  
my other engagements by | axation.””  
  
Three days agoa metfer ger was difpatched  
by meto urge the necefhity of forwarding thefe  
notes with the greateft poffible expedition.  
  
Under this ftate of circumflatices I need  
fearcely add that the expence of every day  
in feeding the whole army will encreafe very  
confiderably the inability of the public to  
dfcharge the debts already incurred, at  
leaft for a confiderable time to come.  
  
Although the officers of the army very  
well know my official fituation, that I am  
only afervant of the peblc, and that it is  
not for me to difpenfe with orders which it  
is my duty to carry into execution—yet as  
furloughs in all fervices are confidered as a  
matter of indulgence, and not of compulfion ;  
as Congrefs, I am perfuaded, entertain the  
beft difpofition toward the army, and as I  
apprehend, in a very fhort time, the two  
principal articles of complaint will be ree  
moved—until the further pleafure of Cone  
grefs can be known, I fhall not hefitate to  
comply with the wifhes of the army, under  
thefe refervations only, that officers fufficrent  
to conduét the men who chufe to receive fur-  
loughs, will attend them either on furlough  
or by detachment. The propriety and ne-  
ceffity of this meafure muft be obvious to all,  
it need not therefore be enforced ; and with  
regard to the non-commiffioned officers and  
privates, fuch as from a peculiarity of cir-  
cumflances with not to receive furloughs at  
  
. this time, will give in their names by 12  
  
o’clock ‘to-motrow to the commanding ofif-  
cers, that on a report to the adjutant-general  
an equal number of men engaged for three  
years may be furloughed, which will make  
the faving of expences exadtly the fame to  
the public.  
  
I cannot but hope the notes will foon ar-  
rive, and that the fettlement of accompts  
may be completed by the affiftance of the  
paymafters in a very few days.. In the  
mean time I fhall have the honour of lay-  
ing the fentiments of the generals and of-  
ficers commanding regiments and corps bee  
fore Congrefs. They are expreffed in fuch a  
decent, candid, and affeéting manner, that  
I am certain every mark of attention will be  
paid tothem. ;

E ) EFORE I make areply to the  
3 fubje&amp; of the address of the Gene­  
&quot; rals and officers commandiag the re­  
gimen@d and ‘corps of this army, prelented  
by yourfelf yesterday, I intreat that those  
Gentlemen will accept may warmest acknow­  
ledgment for the confidence they have been  
pleased to repose in me 3 they may be as­  
sured it thall never be abused y and I beg  
they will be per{uaded, thatas no man can  
possibly be better acquainted than 1 am with  
the past merits and services of the army, so  
noone can possibly be fiore strongly im­  
prefled with their present ineligibie fitvati­  
on, feel 2 keener sensibility at cheir diftrefles;  
cr more ardently desire to alleviate or re­  
move them,—but it would be unceceflary,  
perhaps, (o enter into a detail of what I have  
done, and what [ am fill attempting to do,  
tn order to affitt in the accomplithment of  
this interesting purpofe,—let it be fuffictent  
to observe, 1 do not yet despair of fuccels 3  
for I am perfe@ly coavinced that the States  
cannot, without involving themfelvesin na­  
tional bankruptcy and ruig, refufe to com.  
ply with the requificions of Congrels 5 who,  
it must bs acknowledged, have done every  
thing in their pewer (o obidin ample and  
complete justice for the artny, and whose  
great objeét in the present measure, un­  
toubtedly was, by a redofion of eXpenfe,  
to enable the Financier to make the three  
moaths payfiient to the arily, which, on all  
hands, has been agreed to be absolutely and  
indispensably neceflary ¢ To explain this  
matter, | beg leave to infeft an e¥tract of a  
Jetter from che Superintendent of Finance;  
dated the 29:h ultimo. : v  
¢ It is now above a month since the Coni­  
* mittee conferred with me on that fubjedt,  
“and [ then told thei no payment could  
* be made to the army, but by means of a  
“ paper anticipation 3 and unless our extpen­  
*ditures were unmediately and coaliderably  
* reduced, even that could not be cone.  
* Our expenditures have nevertheless been  
* continued, and our revennes leflen 3 the  
® States growing daily more and more re­  
* milsin their colletions. The consequence  
*l3, that I cannot make payment in the  
* manner firft intended : The notes iffucd  
* for this purpose, would have been paya­  
* bl at two, four, and fix monik® “/om the  
*date ; but at prefess ey will be at fix  
* months, 43¢ Tven that will soon becorte  
* impra&amp;licable, unless our expenses be im­  
&#x27; mediateiy curtailed, i  
¢ I&#x27;hall gaule such notes to be issued for  
  
BATURDAY; Aoty 1 6, 1484  
  
¢ three months pay to the army; and I  
¢ must intreat, Sir, that every iufluence be  
yled with the States, to absorb them, to­  
¢ gether with my other engagements, by  
¢ taxation.’ ;  
Three days ago a meflenger was cifpatch­  
ed by me tourge the peceffity of forward­  
ing these notes with the greatelt possible ex­  
pedition, | &amp; |  
~ Under this state of circumstances, I need  
scarcely add, that the expense of every day  
in feeding the whole army, will increase ve­  
ry considerably the inability of the publicto  
discharge the debts already incurred, at least  
for a considerable tifne to come.  
Although the officers ot the army very  
well know my official [itvation, thatl am  
only a servant of the public, and thatitis  
not for me to dispense with orders, which  
it is my duty to carry into execunon, —is  
yet as furloughs in all services are consider­  
ed asa matter of indulgence and not of com­  
pulsion ; as Congress, | am persuaded, en­  
tertain the be® disposition towards the ar­  
my, and as I apprehend in a very short time  
the two principal articles of complaint will  
be removed j=wuntil the further plesfure of  
Congress can be known, | thall not helitate  
to comply with the withes of the army, ua­  
der these reservations only, that officers fuf­  
ficient to condu&amp; the inen who choose to  
receive furloughs, will attend them cither  
on- furlough or by detachment 3 the pro­  
priety and necefity of this measure mus be  
obvious to all ; it need not therefore be en­  
{orced : and with regard to the mon com­  
missioned officers and privates, such as,  
from a pecularity of circumstances, Wwills  
not to receive furloughs at this rime, will  
pive in their names by 12 o’clock to mor­  
row; to the commanding officers of their ré­  
girjents; that on a report to the adjutants  
General, an equal number of men engaged  
for three years may be furloughed, which  
will make the saving of expenses exactly  
the fame to the public: ,  
I cannot but hepe the notes will soon at­  
tive, and that the settlement of aceompts  
may be completed by the assistance of the  
Paymasters, in a vefy few days. In the  
mean tinielfhall have the honor of laying the  
sentiments of the Generals and officers, com­  
manding regiments and corps, before Con­  
gress—they aré exprefied in such a decent,  
candid, and affeéting manner; that I am  
certain every mark of atténtion will be paid  
to them. 1 have the honor to be,  
&#x27; With very great esteem, Sir,
