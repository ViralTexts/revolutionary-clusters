I dare not express to you at 300 hundred miles distance how ardently I long for your return. I have some very miserly Wishes; and cannot consent to your spending one hour in Town till at least I have had you 12. The Idea plays about my Heart, unnerves my hand whilst I write, awakens all the tender sentiments that years have encreased and matured, and which when with me were every day dispensing to you. The whole collected stock of nine ten weeks absence knows not how to brook any longer restraint, but will break forth and flow thro my pen. May the like sensations enter thy breast, and (in spite of all the weighty cares of State) Mingle themselves with those I wish to communicate, for in giving them utterance I have felt more sincere pleasure than I have known since the 10 of August.—Many have been the anxious hours I have spent since that day—the threatning aspect of our publick affairs, the complicated distress of this province, the Arduous and perplexed Buisness in which you are engaged, have all conspired to agitate my bosom, with fears and apprehensions to which I have heretofore been a stranger, and far from thinking the Scene closed, it looks as tho the curtain was but just drawn and only the first Scene of the infernal plot disclosed and whether the end will be tragical Heaven alone knows. You cannot be, I know, nor do I wish to see you an inactive Spectator, but if the Sword be drawn I bid adieu to all domestick felicity, and look forward to that Country where there is neither wars nor rumors of War in a firm belief that thro the mercy of its King we shall both rejoice there together.  
  
I greatly fear that the arm of treachery and voilence is lifted over us as a Scourge and heavy punishment from heaven for our numerous offences, and for the misimprovement of our great advantages. If we expect to inherit the blessings of our Fathers, we should return a little more to their primitive Simplicity of Manners, and not sink into inglorious ease. We have too many high sounding words, and too few actions that correspond with them. I have spent one Sabbeth in Town since you left me. I saw no difference in respect to ornaments, &amp;c. &amp;c. but in the Country you must look for that virtue, of which you find but small Glimerings in the Metropolis. Indeed they have not the advantages, nor the resolution to encourage our own Manufactories which people in the country have. To the Mercantile part, tis considerd as throwing away their own Bread; but they must retrench their expenses and be content with a small share of gain for they will find but few who will wear their Livery. As for me I will seek wool and flax and work willingly with my Hands, and indeed their is occasion for all our industry and economy.

“ Many have been the anxious hours I have spent since that day;  
the threatening aspect of our public affairs, the complicated distress of  
this province, the arduous and perplexed business in which you are  
engaged, have all conspired to agitate my bosom with fears and appre-  
hensions, to which I have heretofore been a stranger; and, far from  
thinking the scene closed, it looks as though the curtain was but just  
drawn, and only the first scene of the infernal plot disclosed; and  
whether the end will be tragical, Heaven alone knows. You cannot  
be, I know, nor do I wish to see you, an inactive spectator; but, if the  
sword be drawn, I bid adieu to all domestic felicity, and look forward  
to that country, where there are neither wars nor rumors of war, in @  
firm belief, that, through the mercy of its King, we shall both rejoice  
there together.  
  
“T greatly fear, that the arm of treachery and violence is lifted over  
us, as a scourge and heavy punishment from Heaven for our numerous  
offences, and for the misimprovement of our great advantages. If we  
expect to inherit the blessings of our fathers, we should return a little  
more to their primitive simplicity of manners, and not sink into inglori-  
ous ease. We have too many high-sounding words, and too few ac-

since you left. I saw no difference in respect to ornament, &amp;c.; but  
in the country you must look for that virtue, of which you find but small  
glimmerings in the metropolis, Indeed, they have not the advantages,  
nor the resolution, to encourage our own manufactories, which people  
in the country have. To the mercantile part, it is considered as throw-
