				I rejoice that I live to see so fine a collection of the future defenders of their country in pursuit of honor under the auspices of the national government.A desire of distinction is implanted by nature, in every human bosom, and the general sense of mankind in all ages and countries cultivated and uncultivated, has excited, encouraged and applauded this passion in military men more than in any other order of society. Military glory is esteemed the first and greatest of glories. As your profession is at least as solemn and sacred as any in human life, it behoves you seriously to consider What is glory?There is no real glory in this world or any other, but such as arises from wisdom and benevolence. There can be no solid glory among men but that which springs from equity and humanity; from the constant observance of prudence, temperance, justice and fortitude. Battles, victories and conquests abstracted from their only justifiable object and end, which is justice and peace, are the glory of fraud, violence and usurpation.—What was the glory of Alexander and Cæsar? The glimmering which those “livid flames” in Milton “cast pale and dreadful” or “the sudden blaze” which far round “illumined Hell.”Different—far different, is the glory of Washington and his faithful colleagues! Excited by no ambition of conquest or avaricious desire of wealth; irritated by no jealousy, envy, malice, or revenge; prompted only by the love of their country, by the purest patriotism and philanthopy, they persevered, with invincible constancy, in defence of their country, her fundamental laws; her natural, essential and inalienable rights and liberties, against the lawless and ruthless violence of tyranny and usurpation.The biography of these immortal captains, and the history of their great actions, you will read and ruminate night and day.—You need not investigate antiquity, or travel into foreign countries to find models of excellence in military commanders, without a stain of ambition or avarice, tyranny, cruelty or oppression, towards friends or enemies.In imitation of such great examples, in the most exalted transports of your military ardour, even in the day of battle, you will be constantly overawed by a conscious sense of the dignity of your characters as men, as American citizens, and as christians.I congratulate you on the great advantages you possess for attaining eminence in letters and science, as well as in arms.—These advantages are a precious deposit, which you ought to consider as a sacred trust, for which you are responsible to your country, and to a higher tribunal. These advantages, and the habits you have acquired, will qualify you for any course of life you may choose to pursue.That I may not fatigue you with too many words, allow me to address every one of you in the language of a Roman dictator to his master of the horse, after a daring and dangerous exploit for the safety of his country,“Macte virtute esto.”

From the Boston Daily Advertiser, August 18.  
  
On occasion of the visit of the Cadets to the late President Adams oxi  
‘Tuesday last, he made them the foilowing address :—  
  
My Young Fellow Citizens and Fellow Soldiers,  
  
I rejoice that I live to see so fine a collection of the future defenders of  
their country in pursuit of honour under the auspices of the national go-  
vernment.  
  
A desire of distinction is implanted by nature in every human bosom,  
and the general sense of mankind in all ages and countries, cultivated  
and uncultivated, has excited, encouraged and applauded this passion in  
military men more than in any other order of society. Military glory is  
esteemed the first and greatest of glories. As your profession is at least  
as solemn and as anal as any in human life, it behoves you seriously to  
consider what is glory ?  
  
There is no real glory in this world or any other, but such as arises  
from wisdom and benevolence. There can be no solid glory among men,  
but that which springs from equity and humanity; from the constant ob-  
servance of prudence, temperance, justice, and fortitude. Battles, vic-  
tories and conquests, abstracted from their only justifiable object and end,  
which is justice and peace, are the glory of fraud, violence, and usurpa-  
tion. What was the glory of Alexander and Cesar? The glimmering  
which those “livid flames” in Milton “cast pale and dreadful,” or “the

 regum.”  
  
  
  
The U. S. cadets from West Point, when at Boston,  
paida visit to Mr. Adams—on which occasion he  
delivered to them the following address, to which  
a committee made a suitable reply.  
  
My young fellow citizens and fellow soldiers,  
I rejoice that [ live to see so fine a collection of  
the future defenders of their country in pursuit of  
  
honor, under the auspices of the national govern. |  
  
ment.  
  
A desire of distinction is implanted by nature  
th every human bosom, and the general sense of  
mankind in all ages and countries, cultivated and  
yncultivated, has excited, encouraged and applaud-  
ed this passion in military men, more than in any  
other order of society. Military glory is esteemed  
the first and greatest of glories. As your profes-  
sion is at least as solemn and sacred as any in hu-  
man life, it behoves you seriously to consider what  
is glory?  
  
\ There isno real glory in this world or any other,  
but such as arises from wisdom and benevolence.  
There can be no solid glory among men but that  
which springs from equity and humanity; from the  
constant observance of prudence, temperance, jus-  
tice and fortitude. Battles, victories and con-  
quests, abstracted from their only justifiable object  
and end, which is justice and peace, are the glory  
of fraud, violence and usurpation, What was the  
glory of Alexander and Cesar’ The glimmering  
which those “livid flames” in Milton, ‘‘cast pale and  
dreadful,” or “the sudden blaze” which far round  
sillumined hell.”  
  
Different—far different, is the glory of Wash-  
intton and his faithful colleagues! Excited by no  
  
  
  
irritated by no jealousy, envy, malice or revenge;  
prompted only by the love of their country, by the  
purest patriotism and philanthropy, they perse.  
vered, with invincible constancy, in defence of  
their country, her fundamental Jaws; her natural,  
essential and inalienable rights and liberties, against  
the lawless and ruthless violence of tyranny and  
usurpation. |  
  
The biography of these immortal captains, and  
the history of their great actions, you will read and  
ruminate night and day. You need not investigate  
antiquity, or travel into foreign countries to find  
models of excellence in military commanders,  
without a stain of ambition or avarice, tyranny,  
cruelty or oppression, towards friends or enemies,  
  
In imitation of such great examples, in the most  
exalted transports of your military ardor, even in  
the day of battle, you will be constantly overawed  
by a conscious sense of the dignity of your cha.  
racters as men, as American citizens, and as Chris-

a precious deposit, which you ought to consider

## [From _The Military Magazine and Record of the Volunteers of the City and County of Philadelphia.

physical and exact sciences than any we have ever had,  
and with intellectual habits which promise yet more to  
their future characters. But this system of their military  
discipline is made completely subordinate and subservient;  
used rather as exercise and amusement at any time—and  
omitted at those seasons, and under those circumstances  
when it would interfere with the serious studies which  
form the great and paramount object of the establishment.  
We conclude our article with the address made to the ca-  
dets by President Adams, on the occasion of their visit to  
him in the month of August 1824.  
  
My Young Fellow-Citizens and Fellow-Soldiers,  
  
I rejoice that I live to see so fine a collection of the fu-  
ture defenders of their country in pursuit of honor under  
the auspices of the national government.  
  
A desire of distinction is implanted by nature in every  
human bosom, and the general sense of mankind in all ages  
and countries, cultivated and uncultivated, has excited, en-  
couraged and applauded this passion in military men more  
than in any other order of society. Military glory is es-  
teemed the first and greatest of glories. As your profes-  
sion is at least as solemn and as sacred as any in human  
life, it behoves you seriously to consider what is glory?  
  
There is no real glory in this world or any other, but  
such as arises from wisdom and benevolence. There can  
be no solid glory among men, but that which springs from  
equity and humanity-; from the constant observance of  
prudence, temperance, justice and fortitude. Battles, vic-  
tories and conquests, abstracted from their only justifiable  
object and end, which is justice and peace, are the glory of  
fraud, violence, and usurpation. What was the glory of  
Alexander and Cesar? The glimmering which those “livid  
flames”? in Milton “cast pale and dreadful,” or ‘¢ the sud-  
den blaze”’ which far around ‘‘ illumined Hell.”  
  
Different—far different, is the glory of Washington and  
his faithful colleagues! Excited by no ambition of con-  
quest or avaricious desire of wealth; irritated by no  
  
jealousy, envy, malice or revenge; prompted only by the  
  
love of their country, by the purest patriotism and philan-  
throphy, they persevered, with invincible constancy, in de-  
fence of their country, her fundamental laws, her natural,  
essential. and inalienable rights and liberties, against the  
lawless and ruthless violence of tyranny and usurpation.  
  
The biography of these immortal captains, and the his-  
tory of their great actions, you will read and ruminate night  
and day. You need not investigate antiquity, or travel  
into foreign countries to find models of excellence in mili-  
tary commanders, without a stain of ambition or avarice,  
tyranny, cruelty, or oppression, towards friends or enemies.  
  
In imitation of such great examples, in the most exalted  
transports of your military ardour, even in the day of bat-  
tle, you will be constantly overawed by a conscious sense  
of the dignity of your characters as men, as American citi-  
zens, and as Christians.  
  
I congratulate you on the great advantages you possess  
for attaining eminence in letters and science, as well as in  
arms. ‘These advantages area precious deposit, which you  
ought to consider asa sacred trust, for which you are re-  
sponsible to your country, and to a higher tribunal. These  
advantages, and the habits you have acquired, will qualify  
you for any course of life you may choose to pursue.  
  
That I may not fatigue you with too many words, allow  
me to address every one of you in the language of a Roman  
dictator to his master of the horse, after a daring and dan-  
gerous exploit for the safety of his couatry,
