Sir  
Washington July 25. 1812  
I have recd. the address from “The Convention of Republican Delegates from the several counties of the State of New Jersey,” explaining the sentiments entertained at this crisis, by that portion of my Constituents. The sentiments are worthy the character of Citizens, who know the value of the national rights at stake in the present contest; and who are willing to do justice to the sincere &amp; persevering efforts which have been employed to obtain respect to them, without a resort to arms.  
The conduct of the nation agst. whom this resort has been proclaimed, left no choice but between that &amp; the greater evil of a surrender of our Sovereignty on the Element, on which all nations have equal rights, and in the free use of which, the U. S. as a nation whose agriculture &amp; commerce are so closely allied, have an essential interest.  
The appeal to force, in opposition to the force so long continued against us, had become the more urgent, as every endeavor short of it, had not only been fruitless; but had been followed by fresh usurpations &amp; oppressions. The intolerable outrages committed agst. the crews of our vessels which at one time were the result of alledged searches for deserters from British Ships of War, had grown into a like pretension, first as to all British Seamen, and next as to all British subjects; with the invariable practice of seizing on all neutral seamen of every nation; and on all such of our own seamen, as British officers interested in the abuse, might please to demand.  
The blockading orders in Council, commencing on the plea of retaliating injurys, indirectly done to G. Britain, through the direct operation of French Decrees, agst. the trade of the U. S. with her; and on a professed disposition to proceed step by step with France in revoking them, have been since bottomed on pretensions more &amp; more extended and arbitrary; till at length it is openly avowed, as indispensible to a repeal of the orders as they affect the U. States, that the French Decrees, be repealed as they affect G. Britain directly, and all other neutrals, as well as, the U. States. To this extraordinary avowal is superadded abundant evidence, that the real object of the orders is not to restore freedom to the American Commerce with G. B. which could indeed be little interrupted by the decrees of France, but to destroy our lawful commerce, as interfering with her own unlawful commerce with her enemies. The only foundation of this attempt to banish the American flag from the high way of nations, or to render it wholly subservient to the commercial views of the B. Govt. is the absurd &amp; exploded doctrine, that the Ocean not less than the land, is susceptible of occupancy &amp; dominion: that this dominion is in the hands of G. Britain; and that her laws, not the law of nations, which is ours as well as hers, are to regulate our maritime intercourse with the rest of the world.  
When the U. S. assumed &amp; established their rank among the nations of the Earth, they assumed &amp; established a common Sovereignty on the high seas, as well as an exclusive sovereignty within their territorial limits. The one is as essential as the other, to their Character as an Independent nation. However conceding they may have been on controvertible points, or forbearing under casual and limited injuries, they can never submit to wrongs irreparable in their kind, enormous in their amount, and indefinite in their duration; and which are avowed and justified on principles degrading the U: States from the rank of a sovereign &amp; independent Power. In attaining this high rank, and the inestimable blessings attached to it, no part of the American people, had a more meritorious share, than the people of N. Jersey. From none therefore may more reasonably be expected a patriotic zeal in maintaing by the sword the unquestionable &amp; unalienable rights, acquired by it; and which it is found, can no otherwise be maintained.

ll&#x27;ashington, July 25th, 1S12.  
SIR,  
I have received the address from “ The  
convention ol Republican Delegates from the  
several counties of the State of New-Jersey,”  
explaining the sentiments entertained, at this  
crisis, by that portion of my constituents._  
The sentiments are worthy thu character of  
citizens, who know the value of the national  
rights at stake in the present contest; and  
who arc willing to do justice to the sincere  
and persevering efforts, which have been  
em[)ioyed to obtain respect to them, without  
a resort to arms.  
The conduct of the nation against whom  
this resort has been proclaimed, left no choice  
but between that, and the greater evil, of a  
surrender of our sovereignty on the element, i  
oil which all nations nave equal riguts, and  
in the free use of which, tiie United States,  
as a nation whose agriculture aud commerce  
are so closely allied, have au essential inte­  
rest.  
The appeal to force, in opposition to the  
force so long continued against us, had be­  
come the more urgent, as cvefy endeavor  
short of it, had not only been fruitless, but  
had been followed by fresh usurpations and  
oppressions. The intolerable outrages com­  
mitted against the crews of our vessels,  
which at one time were the result of alleged  
  
searches lor deserters from British ships ot  
war, had grown into a like pretension, lirst  
as to all British seamen, and next as to all  
British subjects; with the inva iable prac­  
tice of seizing on all neutral seamen, of eve­  
ry nation, and on all such of our own seamen,  
as British officers, interested in the abuse,  
might please to demand.  
The blockading orders in Council, tjin­  
mencing on the plea ot retaliating injuries  
indirectly done to Great Britain, through the  
direct operation of French decrees against  
the trade of the United States with her; and  
on a professed disposition to proceed step by  
step with France, in revoking them, i ave  
been since bottomed on pretensions me* ..nd  
more extended and arbitrary ; till at length,  
it is openly avowed as indispenstble to a re­  
peal of the orders as they affect the United  
States, that the French decrees be repealed  
us they affect Great Britain directly, and all  
other neutrals, as wed as the United states.  
To this extraordinary avowal is superadded,  
abundant evidence, that the real object of the  
orders is, not to restore freedom to die Ame­  
rican commerce with Great Britain, which  
could indeed be little interrupted by the de­  
crees of France^ but to destroy our lawful  
commerce, as interfering with her own un­  
lawful commerce, with her enemies. l&#x27;lie  
only foundation of this attempt to banish the  
American llag from the high-way of nations,  
or to render it wholly subservient to the com­  
mercial views of the British Government, is  
the absurd and exploded doctrine, that the  
ocean not less than the land is susseptible of  
occupancy and dominion ; that this domini­  
on is in the hands of Great Britain, and that  
her laws, not the laws of nations, winch is  
ours as well as hers, are to regulate our ma­  
ritime intercourse with the rest of the world.  
When the United Stales assumed and es­  
tablished their rank among the uaffous of the  
liarth, they assumed and established a com­  
mon sovereignty on the high seas, as well as  
an exclusive sovereignty within their territo­  
rial limits. The one is as essential as the  
other, to their character as an Independent  
Nation. However conceding they may have  
been, on controvertible points; or forbearing,  
under casual and limited injuries; they can  
  
never submit to wrongs irreparable in their  
kind, enormous in their amouut, and indefi­  
nite in their duration; and which are avow­  
ed and justified on principles, degrading the  
United States from the rank of a sovereign  
and independent power. In attaining this  
high rank, and the inestimable blessings at­  
tached to it, no part of the American people,  
had a more meritorious share, than the peo­  
ple of New-Jersev. From none, therefore,  
may more reasonably be expected, a patrio­  
tic zeal in maintaining by the sword, the un­  
questionable and unalienable rights, acquir­  
ed by it; and which it is found, can no other­  
wise be maintained

since buttomed on pretensions more anid  
more extended and arbitrary ; till at  
  
sible to a repeal of the orders as they af.  
fect the United States, that the French  
leeress be repealed as they affect Great  
Britain directly, and all other ‘neutrals,  
as well as the Uniied. States. &#x27;To this  
extraordinary avowal is superadded  
abandant evidence, that the real object  
of the orders is, not to restore freedom  
to American commerce with G. Britain,  
which could indeed be litde interrupted  
by the decrees of France ; but to destroy  
our lawful commerce as interfering with  
her own unlawful commerce, with her  
enemies. The only foundation of this  
attempt to banish the American flag  
from the highway of nations, or to ren-  
der it wholly subservient to the commer-  
  
is the absurd and exploded doctrine,  
that the ocean not less than the land is  
susceptible of occupancy and dominion ;  
that this dominion is iu the hands of G.  
Britain, and that her laws, not the Jaw

When the United States assamed and  
established their rank among the nations  
of the earth, they assumed and establish-  
eda common sovereignty within their  
territorial limits. ‘The one is as essen-  
tial as the other to their character as an

In attaining this high rank and the ines-  
timable blessings attached to it, no part  
of the American people had a more me-  
ritorous share than the people of New-  
Jersey. From one, therefore, may  
more reasonably be expected, a patrio-  
tic zeul in maintaining by the sword,

Washington, July 25, 1812.  
Sill. I hive received the addres  
from The &#x27;convention of Republi  
can Delegates from the several counties  
of the state of N. Jersey,&quot; explaining  
thesentimenu entertained at this cri­  
sis,by that portion of my constituents.  
The .sentiments are. worthy the cha.  
racter of citizens, who know the va­  
lue of the national rights at stake in  
the present contest, and who are wil  
ling to ilo justice to the sincere and  
perscvenng efforts which have bertj  
employetl to obtain respect to them  
without a resort to arms.  
&quot;The conduct of the nation against  
whom this resort has been proclaim­  
ed, left no choice but between that,  
and the greater evil, of a surrender of  
our sovereignty on the element on  
vhich all nations h ve equal rights,  
and in the free use of which, the U.  
Slates,&#x27; as a nation&#x27; whose agriculture  
arid tcomrjierce arc io closely allied,  
have, an essential interest.  
The appeal &quot;to force, in opposition  
to theorce so long continued against  
us, had b&#x27;ecorne the more urgent, as  
every endeavour short of it,&quot; had not  
only been fruitless ;tbut had been  
followed by fresh&quot; usurpations and  
oppressions. The intolerable out  
rages comrnjued against the crews of  
isur vessels, which attme-time .were  
&quot;the result of alleged searches for de­  
serters from British ships of war, had  
grown into alike pretension, first as  
to all iritiih seamen, and next as to  
all Uritish subjects ; with the invari­  
able practice of seizing o&amp;&#x27;afl neutral  
earaenof every nation, and on - all  
such f qyr own seamen, as British!

Sheaffe for the liberation of all the militia pri­  
soners on parole, not to serve during the war.  
(From the National Register.)  
ANSWKII OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE STATE  
OF NEW JlillSEY.  
&quot; Sir,— I have received ihct Address  
from the Convention of the Republican  
Delegates from the several counties, &amp;c.  
&quot; When the United Stales assumed and  
established their rank among tiie nations  
of the earth, they assumed and established  
a common sovereignty on the high seas, as  
well as the exclusive sovereignty within  
their territorial limits. The one is as es­  
sentia! ;ts the oilier to their character as an  
independent nation. However conceding  
they may have been of controvertible  
points, or forbearing under casual or li­  
mitted injuries, they never can submit to  
wrongs irreparable in their kind, enor­  
mous in their amount, and indefinite in  
their duration; and which are avowed and  
justified on principles degrading the  
United States from the rank of a Sove­  
reign and Independent Power. h\ attain­  
ing this high rank, and the inestimable  
blessings attached to it, no part of&#x27; the  
American people had a more meritorious  
share than the people of New Jersey.  
From none, therefore, may more reasona­  
bly be expected a patriotic zeal in main­  
taining by the sword the unquestionable  
and inalienable lights acquired by it, and  
which it is found can no otherwise be main­  
tained
