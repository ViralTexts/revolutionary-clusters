Washington June 11. 07.  
  
Your letter of May 9. has been duly recieved. the subjects it proposes would require time &amp; space for even  
moderate development. my occupations limit me to a very short notice of them. I think there does not exist a good  
elementary work on the organisation of society into civil government: I mean a work which presents in one full &amp;  
comprehensive view the system of principles on which such an organisation should be founded according to the rights of  
nature. for want of a single work of that character, I should recommend Locke on government, Sidney, Priestley’s Essay on  
the first principles of government, Chipman’s principles of government &amp; the Federalist, adding perhaps Beccaria on  
crimes &amp; punishments because of the demonstrative manner in which he has treated that branch of the subject. if your  
views of political enquiry go further to the subjects of money &amp; commerce, Smith’s wealth of nations is the best book to  
be read, unless Say’s Political economy can be had, which treats the same subjects on the same principles, but in a  
shorter compass &amp; more lucid manner. but I believe this work has not been translated into our language.  
History in general only informs us what bad government is. but as we have employed some of the best materials  
of the British constitution in the construction of our own government, a knolege of British history becomes useful to the  
American politician. there is however no general history of that country which can be recommended. the elegant one of Hume  
seems intended to disguise &amp; discredit the good principles of the government, and is so plausible &amp; pleasing in it’s  
style &amp; manner, as to instil it’s errors &amp; heresies insensibly into the minds of unwary readers. Baxter has performed  
a good operation on it. he has taken the text of Hume as his ground work, abridging it by the omission of some details of  
little interest, and wherever he has found him endeavoring to mislead, by either the suppression of a truth or by giving  
it a false colouring, he has changed the text to what it should be, so that we may properly call it Hume’s history  
republicanised. he has moreover continued the history (but indifferently) from where Hume left it, to the year 1800. the  
work is not popular in England, because it is republican: &amp; but a few copies have ever reached America. it is a single  
4to. volume. adding to this Ludlow’s memoirs, mrs McCauley’s, &amp; Belknap’s histories, a sufficient view will be presented  
of the free principles of the English constitution.  
To your request of my opinion of the manner in which a newspaper should be conducted so as to be most useful,  
I should answer ‘by restraining it to true facts &amp; sound principles only.’ yet I fear such a paper would find few  
subscribers. it is a melancholy truth that a suppression of the press could not more compleatly deprive the nation of it’s  
benefits, than is done by it’s abandoned prostitution to falsehood. nothing can now be believed which is seen in a  
newspaper. truth itself becomes suspicious by being put into that polluted vehicle. the real extent of this state of  
misinformation is known only to those who are in situations to confront facts within their knolege with the lies of the  
day. I really look with commiseration over the great body of my fellow citizens, who, reading newspapers, live &amp; die in  
the belief that they have known something of what has been passing in the world in their time: whereas the accounts they  
have read in newspapers are just as true a history of any other period of the world as of the present, except that the  
real names of the day are affixed to their fables. general facts may indeed be collected from them, such as that Europe is  
now at war, that Bonaparte has been a successful warrior, that he has subjected a great portion of Europe to his will  
&amp;c &amp;c. but no details can be relied on. I will add that the man who never looks into a newspaper is better  
informed than he who reads them; inasmuch as he who knows nothing is nearer to truth than he whose mind is filled with  
falsehoods &amp; errors. he who reads nothing will still learn the great facts, and the details are all false.  
Perhaps an editor might begin a reformation in some such way as this. divide his paper into 4. chapters,  
heading the 1st. Truths. 2d. Probabilities. 3d. Possibilities. 4th. Lies. the 1st. chapter would be very short, as it  
would contain little more than authentic papers, and information from such sources as the editor would be willing to risk  
his own reputation for their truth. the 2d. would contain what, from a mature consideration of all circumstances, his  
judgment should conclude to be probably true. this however should rather contain too little than too much. the 3d. &amp; 4th.  
should be professedly for those readers who would rather have lies for their money than the blank paper they would occupy.  
Such an editor too would have to set his face against the demoralising practice of feeding the public mind  
habitually on slander, &amp; the depravity of taste which this nauseous aliment induces. defamation is becoming a necessary  
of life: insomuch that a dish of tea, in the morning or evening, cannot be digested without this stimulant. even those who  
do not believe these abominations, still read them with complacence to their auditors, and, instead of the abhorrence &amp;  
indignation which should fill a virtuous mind, betray a secret pleasure in the possibility that some may believe them, tho  
they do not themselves. it seems to escape them that it is not he who prints, but he who pays for printing a slander, who  
is it’s real author.  
These thoughts on the subjects of your letter are hazarded at your request. repeated instances of the  
publication of what has not been intended for the public eye, and the malignity with which political enemies torture every  
sentence from me into meanings imagined by their own wickedness only, justify my expressing a sollicitude that this hasty  
communication may in no way be permitted to find it’s way into the public papers. not fearing these political bull-dogs, I  
yet avoid putting myself in the way of being baited by them, and do not wish to volunteer away that portion of tranquility  
which a firm execution of my duties will permit me to enjoy.  
I tender you my salutations &amp; best wishes for your success.  
  
Th: Jefferso

1 \ ashington, Jtme 11, 1807.  
- Sir: Your letter of May 9 has been duly re­  
ceived The subjects it proposes would require  
time &amp; space for even moderatedevelopement.­  
My occupations limit me to a very short notice  
of them. I think there does not exist a good  
elementary work on the organization of society  
into civil government: I mean a work which  
presents, in one full and comprehensive view,  
the system of principles on which such an or­  
ganization should be founded according to the  
rights of nature For want of a single work of i  
that character, I should recommend Locke on j  
Government, Sidney, Priestley’s Essay on the  
First Principles of Government, Chipman’s  
Principles of Government, and the Federalist; j  
adding perhaps, Beccaria on Crimes and Pun* j  
ishments, because of the demonstrative man­  
ner in which he has treated that branch of the j  
subject. If vour views of political inquiry go j  
further, to the subjects of money and com- j  
merce, Smith’s Wealth of Nations is the best j  
book to be read, unless Say’s Political Econo- i  
my can be had„which treats the same subjects ,  
ou the same principles, but in a shorter com- j  
pass and more lucid manner. But I beueve this  
work has not been translated into our language.  
History in general only informs us what bad  
government is. But as we have employed some  
of the best materials of the British constitution,  
in the construction of our government, a know­  
ledge of British history becomes useful to the  
American politician I here is, however, no  
general history of that country which can be

ble and pleasing in its style and manner, as to  
instil its errors and heresies insensibly into the  
minds of unwary readers. Baxter has perform­  
ed a good operation on it. He has taken the  
text of Hume as his groundwork, abridging it

and wherever he has found him endeavoring to

to what it should be; so that we may properly  
call it Hume’s History republicanUed. He has,  
moreover, continued the history, but indiffer­  
ently,from where Hume left it, to the year 1800.  
This work is not popular in England, because  
it is republican, and but a few copies have ever  
reached America. It is a single quarto volume  
Adding to this Ludlow’s Memoirs, Mrs. Ma­  
cauley’s and Belknap’s Histories, a sufficient  
view will be presented of the principles of the  
English constitution.  
To your request of my opinion of the man­

so as to be most useful, I should answer, “by  
restraining it to irue facts and sound principles

pletely deprive the nation of its benefits, than  
is done by its abandoned prostitution to false­  
hood. Nothing can now be believed which is  
seen in a newspaper. Truth itself becomes sus­  
picious by being put into that polluted vehicle.  
The real extent of this state of misinformation  
is known only to those who are in a situation to

deed be collected from them; such as that Eu­  
rope is now at war, that Bonaparte has been a  
successful warrior, and that he has subjected a  
great portion of Europe to his will; but no de­  
tails can be relied on I will add, that ihe man  
who never looks into a newspaper is better in­  
formed than he who reads them, inasmuch as  
he who reads nothing is nearer to truth than he  
• whose mind is filled with falsehood and errors.  
He who reads nothing will still leain tin. gicai  
facts, and the details are almost all false.  
Perhaps an Editor might begin a reformation  
in some such way as this: Divide his papei in­  
to four chapters, heading the 1st, i ruths: 2d,  
Probabilities; 3d, Possibilities: 4th, Lies.—  
The first chapter would be very short, as it  
would contain little more than authentic papers,  
and inlormation from such sources as the Edi­  
tor would he willing to risk his own reputation ■  
for their truth. The second would contain what, ■  
from a mature consideration of all circumstan- j  
  
ces, his judgment should conclude to be proba­  
bly true. The third and fourth should be pro­  
fessedly for those readers who would rather  
have lies for their money than the blank paper  
they would occupy.  
Such an Editor too would have to set his face

unless Say&#x27;s Political Economy can  
be had, which treats the same sub­  
jects on the same principles, but in a  
shorter compass and more lucid man  
ner. But I believe this work has noT  
been translated .into bur language.  
History in general only informs us  
what bad government is. But as we  
have employed some of the best- ma­  
terials of the British ) constitution in  
the construction of our government,  
a knowledge of - British history he­  
comes useful to he American politi­  
cian. . There is, however, no general  
history of that country; which, can be  
recommended. The - elegant&quot; one of  
Hume seems intended to disguise and  
discredit the good &quot;principles of the  
government, and is;so plausible and  
pleasing in i s style and manner, as to  
instil its err srs and heresies insensi­  
bly into the ninds. of unwary readers.  
Baxter has oerforraed a giod opera­  
tion on it. He has taken the text of  
Hume as his grouridwbrk: abridging  
it by the omission of some details of  
little interest,- and&#x27;. wherever jlie has  
found hiiri endeavoring to mislead,  
by either the suppression of a truth,  
or giving it; a false coloring, &#x27; he has  
changed the text to vvhat it should be ;  
so that we; may ; properly - call it  
Hume&#x27;s History republicanised. : He  
has, moreover, xontinued the history,  
but indifferently, frorri Twhere Hume  
Jpft it, to-the year 180Q. . The work  
is not popular in England, because it

Washington, June 11, 1807.  
  
Syn: Your letter of May 9, Las been duly received.  
The subjects it proposes would require time and space  
for even moderate developement. My occupations  
limit me to a very short notice of them. I think  
there does notexist a good elementary work on the  
orginization of society into civil government. 1  
mean a work which presents, in one full and compre  
hensive view, the system of principles on which such  
an organization should be founded according to the  
rights of nature. For want of a single work of that  
eharacter, I should recommend Locke on Govern-  
ment, Sidney, Priestley’s essay on the first principles  
of government, Chipman’s Principles of Government,  
and the Federalist; adding, perhaps, Beccaria on  
crimes and punishments, because of the demonstra-  
tive manner in which hehas treated that branch of  
the subject. If your views of political inquiry go  
further, to the subjects of money and commerce,  
Smith’s Wealth of Nations is the best book to be  
read, unless Say’s Political Economy can be had,  
which treats the same subjects on the same princi-  
ples, but in a shorter compass and more lucid man-  
per. But I believe this work has not been transiat-  
ed into our language.  
  
History in general only informs us what bad gov-  
ernment is. But as we have employed some of the  
best materials of the British constitution in the con-  
struction of our government, a knowledge of British  
history becomes useful to the American politician.  
There is, however, no general history of that country  
  
— Axes  
Hume seems intended to disguise and discredit the  
good principles of the government, ahd is so plausi-  
ble and pleasing in its style and manner, as to instil  
its errors and heresies insensibly into the minds of  
unweary readers. Baxter has performed a good  
operation on it. He has taken the text of Hume as  
his ground-work, abridging it by the omission of some  
details of little interest, and wherever he has found  
him endeavoring to mislead by either the suppres-  
sion of a truth or iving it a false colouring, he has  
changed the text to what it should be; so that we may  
properly call it Hume’s History, republicanised He  
has, moreover continued the history, but indifferent-  
ly, from where Hume left it, to the year 1800. This  
workis not popularin England, because it is republi-  
can, and buta few copies have ever reached America.  
It is a single quarto volume. Adding to this Ludlow’s  
Memoirs, Mrs. Macauley’s and Belknap’s Histories, a  
  
sufficient view will be presented of the principles of  
the English constitution.  
  
To your request of my opinion of the manner in  
which a newspaper should be conducted, so as to be  
most useful, | should answer, “by restraining it to  
true facts and sound principles only.” Yet I fear  
such a paper would find few subscribers, Itis a me-  
lancholy truth, that a suppression of the press could  
not more completely deprive the nation of its bene-  
fits, than is done by its abandoned prostitution to  
falsehood. Nothing can now be beiieved which is  
seen ip &amp; newspaper. Truth itself becomes suspi-  
cious by being put into that polluted vehicle. The  
real extent of this state of misinformation is known  
only to those who are in a situation to confront  
facts within their knowledge with the lies of the day.  
I really look with commisseration over the great body  
of my fellow citizens, who, reading newspapers, live  
and die in the belief that they have known somethin  
of what has been passing in their time; whereas the  
accounts they have read are just as true a history of  
any other period of the world asof the present, ex-  
cept that the real names of the day are affixed to their  
fables. General facts may indeed be collected from  
them; such as that Europe is now at war, that Bona-  
parte has been a succesful warrior, and that he has  
subjected a great portion of Europe to bis will; but  
no detail can be relied on. I will add, that the man  
who never looks into a newspaper is better informed  
than he who reads them, inasmuch as he who knows  
nothing is nearer to truth than he whose mind is fil-  
led with falsehoods and errors. He who reads noth-  
ing will still learn the great facts, and the details  
are almost all false.  
  
Perhaps an editor might begin a reformation in  
some such way as this. Divide his psper into four  
chapters, heading the Ist rrurHs: 2d, PROBABILITIES:  
3d possipiLities: 4th, Lies. The firstchapter would  
be very short, as it would contain little more than  
authentic papers, and information from such sources  
as the editor would be willing to risk his own repu-  
tation for their truth. The second would contain  
what, from a mature consideration of all circumstan-  
ces, his judgment should conclude to be probably  
true. The third and fourth should be professedby  
for those readers who would rather have lies for  
their money than the blank paper they would occu-  
Py:  
  
Such an editor too would have to set his face  
against the demoralizing practice of feeding the pub-  
lic mind habitually on slander, and the depravity of  
taste which this nauseous aliment induces Defama-.  
tion is becoming a necessary of life; insomuch that a  
dish of tea, in the morning or evening, cannot be di-  
gested without this stimuiant. Even those who do  
not believe these abominations still read them with  
complacence to their auditors; and, instead of the

this state of misinformation is known only to  
those who are in a situation to confront facts

the great body of my fellow citizen’*, who,  
reading newspapers, live arid die in the belief  
that they have known something of what lias  
been passing in the world-in their time;  
whereas the accounts they have read in news­  
papers are just as true a history of any other  
period of the world as of the preseur, except  
that the real names of the day are affixed to  
their tables. General facts may indeed he  
collected from them, such as that Europe is  
now at war, that Buonaparte has been a suc­  
cessful warrior, that be has subjected a great  
portion of Europe to hiswdi. «ic. *V»\; but no  
details can he relied on. 1 will add, that the  
man who never looks into a newspapers is bet­

truth than he whose mind is filled with false­  
hoods and errors, lie who reads nothing

are all false.  
Perhaps an editor might begin a reforma­  
tion in some such way as this. Divide his  
paper into four chapters, heading the 1st,  
Truths. 2d, Prolmbilities. bd, Possibilities.  
4th, Lies. The 1st chapter would be very  
short, as it would contain little more than  
authentic papers, and information trom such  
sources, as the editor would be willing to risk  
his own reputation tor their truth, i lie 2d  
would contain what, from a mature consider­  
ation of all circumstances, his judgment  
should conclude to be probably true. The 3d \
and 4th should be professedly for those read­  
ers who would rather have lies lor their mo­  
nay than the blank paper they would occupy.  
Such an editor, too would ha\o to set his  
faee against the demoralising practice of  
feeding the public miud habitually on slan­

ous aliment induces. Defamation is becom­

is a melancholy truth that the suppression of  
the press could not more completely deprive  
the nation of its benefits than is done bv its  
abandoned prostitution to falsehood. Notiling  
can now be believed which is seen in a news-  
paper. Truth itself becomes suspicious by  
being put into that polluted vehicle. The  
real extent of this state of misinformation is  
known only to those who are in situations  
to confront facts within their knowlege of the  
day. I really look with commisseration over  
the great body of iny fellow-citizens, who,  
reading newspapers, live and die in the belief  
that they have known something of what has  
been passing in the world in their time;  
whereas the accounts tbev have read in news-  
papers are just as true a history of any other  
period of the world as of the present, except  
that the real names of the day are affixed to  
their fables. General facts may indeed be  
collected from them, such as that Europe is  
now at war, that Bonaparte has been a suc-  
cessful warrior, that he has subjected a great  
portion of Europe to his will, &amp;c. ; but no  
details can be relied on. I will add, that the  
man, who never looks into a newspaper is better  
informed than be who reads them ; inasmuch  
as he who knows nothing, is nearer the truth  
than he whose mind is filled with falsehoods  
and errors. He who reads nothing will still  
learn the great facts, and the details are all  
false.  
  
Perhaps an editor might begin a reforma-  
tion in somo such way as this. Divide his  
paper into four chapters, heading the 1st  
Truths; 2d. Probabilities; 3d. Possibilities;  
4th, Lies. The first chapter would bo very  
short, as it would contain little more than  
authentic papers, and information from such  
sourees as the editor would be willing to risk  
his own reputation for the truth. The 2d  
would contain what, from mature considera-  
tion of all circumstances, his judgment  
should conclude to bo probably true. This,  
however, should rather contain too little than  
too much. The 3d and 4th should he pro-  
fessedly for those readers who would rather  
have lies fortheir money than the blank paper  
they would occupy.  
  
Such an editor, too, would have to set his  
face against the demoralizingpraeticeof feed-  
ing the public mind habitually on slander,  
and the depravity of taste which this nauseous  
aliment induces. Defamation is becoming a  
necessary of life, inasmuch that a dish of tea  
in the morning or evening cannot be digested  
without this stimulant. Even those who do  
not believe these abominations, still read them  
with complaisance to their auditors, and in-  
stead of the abhorrence and indignation whibh  
should fill a virtuous mind, betray a secret  
pleasure in the possibility that some may be-  
lieve them, though they do not themselves.  
It seems to&#x27; escape them that it is not he  
who prints, hut he who pays for printing a  
slander, who is its real author.  
  
These thoughts on tho subject of your let-  
ter are hazarded at your request. Repeated  
instances of the publication of what has been  
intended for the public eye, and the maligni-  
ty with which political enemies torture every  
sentence from me into meanings imagined by  
ther own wickedness only, to justify my ex-  
pressing a solicitude that this hasty commu-  
nication may in no wise he permitted to find  
its way into-the public papers.  
  
Not tearing these political bull-dogs, I yet  
avoid putting myself in the way of being  
baited by them, and do not wish to volunteer  
away that jiortion of tranquility which a firm  
execution of my duties will permit me to en-  
joy.  
  
I tender you my salutations and best wishes  
for your success.  
  
TIIOS. JEFFERSON

of the Federal quills, he began to think  
differently of the freedom of the press.  
Once, in the safety of private station,  
he had got off this antithesis: if he  
had to choose between a government  
without newspapers, and newspapers  
without a government, he should prefer  
the latter. But when in his turn he  
felt the stings that previously, under  
his management, had goaded even  
Washington out of his self-control, Jef-

the wisest observer of politics this  
country has ever seen.  
You ask my opinion of the man­  
ner in which a newspaper should be  
conducted, so as to be most useful.  
1 answer,—“by restraining it to true  
facts and sound principles only.&#x27;’  
Yet 1 fear such a paper would find  
few subscribers. It is a melancholy  
truth, that a suppression of the press  
could not more completely deprive  
the nation of its benefits, than is done  
by its abandoned prostitution to  
falsehood. Very little can be believ­  
ed that is now seen in a newspaper.  
Truth itseli becomes suspicious by  
being put in that polluted vehicle.  
The real extent of this state of mis­  
information is known only to those  
who are in situations to confront  
facts within their own knowledge  
with lies they see in the papers. I  
really look with great eoumiisera-;  
tion over the great body of lfly fellow ;  
citizens, who, reading newspapers,  
live and die in the belief, that they  
have kfrown something of what lias  
been passing in the world in their  
time: whereas the accounts they have  
read in the newspapers are just as  
true a history of any other period as  
of the present, except that the real  
names of the day are affixed to their  
fables. General facts may indeed  
b collected from them but the de­  
tads cannot be relied on. Indeed  
tiie man who never lqpks into a  
newspaper is better informed than  
to who reads them; inasmuch as be  
who knows nothing is nearer the  
truth than be whose mind is filled  
with falsehood, lit* who does not I  
see a newspaper will still learn  
the great facts of bis day. and the  
details in the papers are generallj’  
l\ rhaps an editor might begin a ;  
reformation in some such way as this.  
Divide his paper into four chapters  
heading the 1st, Truths; 2nd, ITob  
abilities; 3rd, Possibilities; 4th,  
Lies. The first chapter would be  
very short, as it would contain little ;  
n &gt;ic than authentic papers, and in­  
formation from such sources as the  
editor would be willing to risk his  
own reputation for their truth. The,  
second would contain what, from a  
mature consideration of all circum ,  
stances, his judgment should con­  
clude to be probably true. This, j  
however, should rather contain too  
little than too much. The third  
and fourth should be professedly for &#x27;  
those readers who would rather have  
lies for their money than the blank  
paper they would occupy.  
Such an editor too, would have to I  
set his face against the demoralizing  
practice of feeding the public mind  
habitually on slander, and the de­  
pravity of taste which this nauseous  
aliment induces. ****
