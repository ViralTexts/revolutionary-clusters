(a) This tract for the size of it is valuable, more for its situation than the quality of its soil, though that is good for Farming; with a considerable portion of grd that might, very easily, be improved into Meadow. It lyes on the great road from the City of Washington, Alexandria and George Town, to Leesburgh &amp; Winchester; at Difficult bridge; nineteen miles from Alexandria, less from the City &amp; George Town, and not more than three from Matildaville at the Great Falls of Potomac. There is a valuable seat on the Premises—and the whole is conditionally sold—for the sum annexed in the Schedule.

(b) What the selling prices of lands in the vicinity of these two tracts are, I know not; but compared with those above the ridge, and others below them, the value annexed will appear moderate—a less one would not obtain them from me.

240 [acres]  
[$]15  
[$]3,600 (e)  
  
  
(e) This tract, though small, is extremely valuable. It lyes on Potomac River about 12 miles above the Town of Bath (or Warm springs) and is in the shape of a horse Shoe; the river running almost around it. Two hundred Acres of it is rich low grounds; with a great abundance of the largest &amp; finest Walnut trees; which, with the produce of the Soil, might (by means of the improved Navigation of the Potomac) be brought to a shipping port with more ease, and at a smaller expence, than that which is transported 30 miles only by land.  
  
  
Gloucester  
  
  
On North River  
400 [acres]  
  
abt [$]3,600 (f)  
  
  
(f) This tract is of second rate Gloucester low grounds. It has no Improvements thereon, but lyes on navigable water, abounding in Fish and Oysters. It was received in payment of a debt (carrying interest) and valued in the year 1789 by an impartial Gentleman to £800. N.B. it has lately been sold, and there is due thereon, a balance equal to what is annexed the Schedule.

Near Suffolk 1/3 of 1119 acres  
373 [acres]  
[$]8  
[$]2,984 (g)  
  
  
  
(g) These 373 a⟨cres⟩ are the third part of undivided purchases made by the deceased Fielding Lewis[,] Thomas Walker and myself; on full conviction that they would become valuable. The land lyes on the Road from Suffolk to Norfolk—touches (if I am not mistaken) some part of the Navigable water of Nansemond River—borders on, and comprehends part of the rich Dismal Swamp; is capable of great improvement; and from its situation must become extremely valuable.  
  
  
Great Dismal Swamp  
  
  
My dividend thereof

(h) This is an undivided Interest wch I held in the Great Dismal Swamp Company—containing about 4000 acres, with my part of the Plantation &amp; Stock thereon belonging to the Company in the sd Swamp.

[$]97,440 (i)  
  
  
(i) These several tracts of land are of the first quality on the Ohio River, in the parts where they are situated; being almost if not altogether River bottoms. The smallest of these tracts is actually sold at ten dollars an acre but the consideration therefor not received—the rest are equally valuable &amp; will sell as high—especially that which lyes just below the little Kanhawa and is opposite to a thick settlement on the West side the Rivr. The four tracts have an aggregate breadth upon the River of Sixteen miles and is bounded there by that distance.

[$]200,000 (k)  
  
  
(k) These tracts are situated on the Great Kanhawa River, and the first four are bounded thereby for more than forty miles. It is acknowledged by all who have seen them (and of the tract containing 10990 acres which I have been on myself, I can assert) that there is no richer, or more valuable land in all that Region; They are conditionally sold for the sum mentioned in the Schedule—that is $200,000 and if the terms of that Sale are not complied with they will command considerably more. The tract of which the 125 acres is a Moiety, was taken up by General Andrew Lewis and myself for, and on account of a bituminous Spring which it contains, of so inflamable a nature as to burn as freely as Spirits, and is as nearly difficult to extinguish.  
  
  
Maryland  
  
  
Charles County  
600 [acres]  
[$]6  
[$]3,600 (l)  
  
  
(l) I am but little acquainted with this land, although I have once been on it. It was received (many years since) in discharge of a debt due to me from Daniel Jenifer Adams at the value annexed thereto—and must be worth more. It is very level, lyes near the River Potomac.

(m) This tract ⟨lies⟩ about 30 miles above the City of Washington, not far from Kittoctan. It is good farming Land, and by those who are well acquainted with it I am informed that it would sell at twelve or $15 pr acre.  
  
  
Pennsylvania  
  
  
Great Meadows  
234 [acres]  
[$]6  
[$]1,404 (n)  
  
  
(n) This land is valuable on account of its local situation, and other properties. It affords an exceeding good stand on Braddocks road from Fort Cumberland to Pittsburgh—and besides a fertile  
  
soil, possesses a large quantity of natural Meadow, fit for the scythe. It is distinguished by the appellation of the Great Meadows—where the first action with the French in the year 1754 was fought.

(o) This is the moiety of about 2000 Acs. which remains unsold of 6071 Acres on the Mohawk River (Montgomery CtY) in a Patent granted to Daniel Coxe in the Township of Coxeborough &amp; Carolana—as will appear by Deed from Marinus Willet &amp; Wife to George Clinton (late Governor of New York) and myself. The latter sales have been at Six dollars an ac[r]e and what remains unsold will fetch that or more.

(p) The quality of these lands &amp; their Situation, may be known by the Surveyors certificates—which are filed along with the Patents. They ⟨li⟩e in the vicinity of Cincinnati; one tract near the mouth of the little Miami another seven &amp; the third ten miles up the same—I have been informed that they will readily command more than they are estimated at.

(q) For the description of these tracts in detail, see General Spotswoods letters filed with the other papers relating to them. Besides the General good quality of the Land there is a valuable Bank of Iron Ore thereon: which, when the settlement becomes more populous (and settlers are moving that way very fast) will be found very valuable; as the rough Creek, a branch of Green River affords ample water for Furnances &amp; forges.  
  
  
  
Lots—viz. City of Washington  
  
  
Two, near the Capital, Sqr. 634 cost $963—and with Buildgs  
[$]15,000 (r)  
  
  
(r) The two lots near the Capital, in square 634, cost me ⟨9⟩63$ only; but in this price I was favoured, on condition that I should build two Brick houses three Story high each: without this reduction the selling prices of those Lots would have cost me about $1350. These lots, with the buildings thereon, when completed will stand me in $15000 at least.  
  
  
[City of Washington]  
  
  
No. 5. 12. 13 &amp; 14—the 3 last, Water lots on the Eastern Branch, in Sqr. 667 containing together 34,438 sqr. feet @ 12 Cts  
[$]4,132 (s)  
  
  
(s) Lots No. 5. ⟨12.⟩ 13. &amp; 14 on the Eastn branch, are advantageously situated on the water—⟨and⟩ although many lots much less convenient have sold a great deal higher I will rate these at 12 Cts the square foot only.  
  
  
Alexandria  
  
  
Corner of Pitt &amp; Prince Stts half an Acre—laid out into buildgs 3 or 4 of wch are let on grd Rent at $3 pr foot  
[$]4,000 (t)  
  
  
(t) For this lot, though unimproved, I have refused $35⟨0⟩0—It has since been laid off into proper sized lots for building on—three or 4 of which are let on ground Rent—forever—at three dollars a foot on the Street. and this price is asked for both fronts on Pitt &amp; Princes Street.  
  
  
Winchester  
  
  
A lot in the Town of half an Acr. &amp; another in the Commons of about 6 Acs.—supposed  
[$]400 (u)  
  
  
(u) As neither the lot in the Town or Common have any improvements on them, it is not easy to fix a price, but as both are well situated, it is presumed the price annexed to them in the Schedule, ⟨is a⟩ reasonable valu[atio]n.  
  
  
  
Bath—or Warm Springs  
  
  
Two Well situated, &amp; had buildings to the amt of £150  
[$]800 (w)  
  
  
(w) The Lots in Bath (two adjoining) cost me, to the best of my recollection, betwn fifty &amp; sixty pounds 20 years ago; and the buildings thereon £150 more. Whether property there has ⟨increased⟩ or decreasd in its value, ⟨and in wha⟩t condition the houses a⟨re, I am ignora⟩nt. but s⟨uppose they are not valued too⟩ high.

Potomack Company  
  
  
24 Shares—cost ea. £100 Sterg  
  
[$]10,666 (y)  
  
  
(y) The value, annexed to these sha[res] is what they have actually cost me, and is the price affixed by Law: and although the present selling price is under par, my advice to the Legatees (for whose benefit they are intended, especially those who can afford to lye out of the Money is that each should take and hold one; there being a Moral certainty of a great and increasing profit arising from them in the course ⟨of a few⟩ years.  
  
  
James River Company  
  
  
5 Shares—each cost $100  
  
[$]500 (z)  
  
  
(z) It is supposed that the Shares in the James River Company must also be productive. But of this I can give no decided opinion for want of mo⟨re accur⟩ate informatn.

Th⟨ese are the no⟩minal prices of th⟨e shares in the Banks⟩ of Alexandria &amp; Co⟨lumbia—the selling prices⟩ vary according ⟨to circumstances.⟩ But as the Sto⟨ck usually divides from⟩ eight to ten ⟨per cent per annum, they⟩ must be w⟨orth the former, at least,⟩ so long as the ⟨Banks are conceived⟩ to be Secure, ⟨although circumstan⟩ces may, so⟨metimes make them below it⟩.

a. This tract, for the ſize of it, is valuable,  
more for its ſituation than the quality of its ſoil,  
  
though that is good for farming: with a con-  
ſerable proportion of ground, that might very  
eu ſily be improved into meadow, It lies on the  
great road from the City of Waſhington, Alex -  
andria and George-Town to Leeſburg and Win-  
cheſter, at Difficult Bridge, nineteen miles from  
Alexandria, leſs from the City a nd George-  
Town, and not more than three from Matilda»  
ville, at the Great Falls of Potomak. There  
is a valuable.{eat.on the premiles, and the whole  
is conditionally fold for the lum annexed in the  
ſchedule. „%% LED” 45 a Te TT |

below them, che value anaexed. will appear mo-

luable. It hes on Fotemak Rwer, about 12  
unles above the Town of Bath (or Warm  
dprings) and is in the Ihape of a horleſhoe, the  
Nver 4UDRINS almeſt around it. TO hundred

178)  
  
acres of it are rich low grounds, with a great  
abu dance of t.:e largeſt and fineſt walnut tr  
Which, with the produce of the ſoil, might (oy  
  
means &#x27;of the imp roved navigation of the Poto-  
mak) be brought ro a ſhipping port with more  
eaſe, and at a1mmaller expenſe, than that h  
is tranſporied 30 miles only by land.  
  
F. This tract is of ſecond rate Glouceſter we  
grouads. It has no improvements thereon, but  
Hes on navigable water, abounding in fih aud  
oyſters. It was received in pay meat of a debt  
(carrying intereſt) and valued, in th- year  
x789, by an impartial gentleman, at . 80.  
N. B. It his lately been told, and there is due  
  
thereon a balance equal to what is annex:d in  
the ſehedule.  
  
g. Theſe 373 acres are the chirg part of un ·  
divided purenales made by the deceaſed Field -  
iog Lewis, Thomas Walker, and myſelf, on full  
cn viction that they would become valuable.  
The laadlies on the road from Suffolk to Nor-  
folk, touches (if I am not miſtaken) ſome part of  
the navigable water of Naaſamond River; the  
  
rich Diſmal Swamp, is capable of great improves  
ment, and, from its fituation, mult become Ga  
tremely valyabie. |  
  
+. This is an undivided intereſt which I held  
in the great Diſmal Swamp Company, contain-  
ing about gooo acres, wich my par: ot the plan-

ther, river bottoms. The ſmilleft of theſe trace  
is actually lol:i at ten dollars an acre, but the  
conſideration therefor not receives, The reſt  
are equally valuable, and will Tell as high;  
eſpecially that which lies juſt below the Little  
Kanha wa, and is oppeſite to a thick ſettlement  
on the weft f1:ie the river. The four tracts have  
an aggregate breadth upon the river of ſixteen  
miles, and are bounded thereby that diſtance  
  
x. Theſe traits are ſituated on the Great Kan  
&#x27;hawa River, and the firft four are bounded  
thereby for more than for ty miles. It is ackhow-  
ledged by all who have ſeen them (and of rhe  
tract containing 10,990 acres, which I have  
been on myſelf, I can zſſert) chat there is re  
richer, or more valuable land in all that region  
  
They are conditionally ſold for che fum menti-  
oned in the ſchedule, that is 200,000 dollars,  
and if the terms of that ale are not complied  
with, they will command conſiderably: more.  
  
The tract, of which the 125 acres is a moiety,  
  
was taken up by General Andrew Lewis and  
  
my ſelf, for, and on account of, a bitumenous  
ſpring which it contains, of ſo inflammable a  
  
nature, as io burn as freely as ſpirits, and is as  
  
nearly difficult to extinguiſh _ _  
I. Iam but little acquainted Svith this land,  
although I have once been on it. At was receiv-  
  
e (many years lance} in diſcharge of a debt due  
  
to me from Daniel Jenifer Adams, at the value  
_ .annexed thereto, and muſt be worth more» It  
  
is very level—hes near the River Potomak. -  
m. This tract lies about go miles above the  
City of Waſhington, not far trom Kittoctan. It  
is good tarming land, and, by thote who are well  
  
( 30)  
  
acquainted with ir, I am informed that it would  
ſell at twelve or fifteen dollars per acre.  
u. This land is valuable, on account of its locgl  
ſituation and other properties. It affords an ex-  
ceeding good ſtand on Bradock&#x27;s Road from Fort-  
Cumberland to Pitiſburg; and, &#x27;befides à fertile  
ſoil, poſſeſſes a large quantity of natural mea-  
dow, fit for the ſcythe. It is diſtin guiſhed by  
the appellation of the Great Meadows, where  
the firſt action with the French, in the year 1 754,  
was tought, OY | | ES  
o. 4 his is the -moiety of about 2000 acres,  
which remains 1nſold, of:607x acres on the Mo-  
hawk River (Montgomery county) in a patent  
granted to Daniel Coxe, in the Townſhip of  
Coxeborough and Carolan, as will appear by  
deec, from Marinus Willet and wite, to George  
Clinton (late. governor of New York) and my-  
ſelf, The latter ſales have been at fix dollais an  
acre, and what remains unſold will fetch that er  
more. N OTST YN  
bpb. The quality of theſe lands and their ſitu-  
ation, may be khovn by the Surveyor&#x27;s Certi-  
ficates, which ere filed along with the patents —  
They lay in the vicinity ot. Cincinnati; one tract  
near the mouth of he Little Miami — another

NOTES.  
  
a. This tract, for the size of it is valuable, more for its situation than  
the quality of its soil, though that is good for farming ; witha consider-  
able proportion of ground, that might very easily be improved into mea-  
dow. Itlies onthe great road from the city of Washington, Alexandria,  
and George-Town, to Leesburgh and Winchester, at difficult Bridge,  
nineteen miles from Alexandria, less from the city and George-Town,  
and not more than three from Matildaville, at the great falls of Potomac.  
where is a valuable seat on the premises, and the whole is conditionally  
sold for the sum annexed in the schedule  
  
b. What the selling prices of lands in the vicinity of these two tracts  
are, I know not ; but compared with those above the ridge, and others  
below it, the value annexed will appear moderate ; a less one would not  
obtain them from me.  
  
e. The surrounding land not superior in soil, situation or properties of  
any sort, sells currently at from twenty to thirty dollars an acre. The  
lowest price is affixed to these.  
  
d. The observations made in the last note, apply equally to this tract,  
being in the vicinity of them, and of similar quality, although it lies in  
another county.  
  
.€- This tract though small, is extremely valuable. It lies on Potomac  
Tiver, about twelve miles above the town of Bath (or Warm Springs) and  
  
Me 2 the shape of a horse-shoe, the river running almost around it. Two  
a red acres of it are rich low grounds, with a great abundance of the  
bees and finest walnut trees, which with the produce of soil, might  
  
OF means of the improved navigation of the Potomac) be brought to a  
‘ Rt fa port with more ease, and at a smaller expence, than that which  
18 te tape thirty miles only by land.  
  
f. This tract is of second rate Crennetter low grounds. Ithas no im-  
oS thereon, but lies on navigable water, abounding in fish and  
ae Ate received in payment of a debt (carrying interest) and  
M  nane ; © year 1789 by an impartial gentleman, at £800. N.  
  
. as — been sold, and there is due thereon a balance equal to  
what is annexed in the schedule.  
  
— 873 acres are the third part of undivided purchases made by  
the deceased Fielding Lewis, Thos Walker and myself, on full conviction  
that they would become valuable. The land lies on the road from Suf-  
  
  
  
  
  
folk to Norfolk, touches (if I am not mistaken) some part of the navigable  
water of Nansemond ; the rich Dismal Swamp is capable of great im-  
provement, and, from its situation, must become extremely valuable.  
  
h. This isan undivided interest whichI held in the great Dismal  
Swamp Company, containing about 4000 acres, with my part of the plan-  
tation and stock thereon, belonging to the company in the said Swamp.  
  
i. These several tracts of land are of the first quality on the Ohio  
river, in the parts where they are situated, being almost, if not altogether  
river bottems. The smallest of these tracts is actually sold at ten dol-  
lars an acre, but the consideration therefor not received. The rest are  
equally valuable, and will sell as high, especially that which lies just  
below the Little Kanhawa ; and is opposite to a thick settlement on the  
west side of the river. Thefour tracts have an aggregate breadth upon  
the river of sixteen miles, and are bounded there by that distance.  
  
Ak These tracts are situated upon the Great Kanhawa river, and the  
first four are bounded thereby for more than 40 miles. It is acknowledged  
by all who have seen them (and of the tract containing 10,990 acres, which  
I have been on myself, I can assert) that there is no richer or more va-  
luable land in all that region. They are conditionally sold for&quot;the sum  
mentioned in the schedule, that is, 200,000 dollars, and if the terms of  
that sale are not complied with, they will command considerable more  
—The tract, of which the 125 acres is a moity, was taken up by General  
Andrew Lewis, and myself, for, and on account of a bitumenous spring  
which it contains, of so inflamable a nature, as to burn as freely as spi-  
rits, and is nearly as difficult to extinguish.  
  
2. 1 am but little acquainted with this land, altho’ I have been on it.  
It was received (many years since) in discharge of a debt due to me from  
Daniel Jeniser Adams, at the value annexed thereto, and must be worth  
more. It is very level—lies near the river Potomac.  
  
m. This tract lies about 30 miles above the city of Washington, not far  
from Kittoctan. It is good farming land, and by those who are well ac-  
quainted with it, I am informed that it would sell at twelve or fifteen dol-  
lars per acre.  
  
n. This land is valuable on account of its local situation and other pro-  
perties. It affords an exceeding good stand on Braddock’s road from  
Fort Cumberland to Pitsburg ; and besides a fertile soil, possesses a  
large quantity of natural meadow, fit for the scythe. It is distinguished  
by the appellation of the Great Meadows, where the first action with the  
French, in the year 1754, was fought.  
  
o. This is the moity of about 2000 acres which remains unsold, of 6071  
acres on the Mohawk river (Montgomery county) in a patent granted to  
Daniel Coxe, in the township of Coxeborough and Carolina, as will appear  
by deed, from Marinus Willet and wife, to George Clinton (late governor  
of New York) and myself. The latter sales have been at six dollars an  
acre, and what remains unsold will fetch that or more.  
  
p. The quality of these lands and their situation, may be known by the  
surveyor’s certificates, which are filed along with the patents. They lie  
in the vicinity of Cincinnati; one tract near the mouth of the little Mi-  
ami; another seven, and the third ten miles up the same. I have been  
informed that they will readily command more than they are estimated  
at.  
  
q. For the description of those tracts in detail, see General Spotswood’s  
letters filed with the other papers relating to them. Besides the general  
good quality of the land, there isa valuable bank of iron ore thereon,  
which, when the settlement becomes more populous (and settlers are mo-  
ving that way very fast) will be found very valuable, as the Rough  
Creek, a branch of Green River, affords amplé water for furnaces and  
  
forges.  
LOTS, VIZ.  
CITY OF WASHINGTON.  
  
r. The two lots near the capitol, injsquare 634, cost me 963 dollars  
only ; but in this price I was favored, on condition that I should build  
two brick houses three story high each : without this reduction the sell-  
ing prices of these lots would have cost me about 1350 dollars. These  
lots, with the buildings on them when completed, will stand me in 15,000  
dollars at least.  
  
s. Lots Nos. 5,12, 18, and 14, on the eastern branch, are advantage-  
ously situated on the water ; and although many lots much less conveni-  
ent have sold a great deal higher, I will rate these at 12 cents the square  
foet only.  
  
ALEXANDRIA.  
  
t. For this lot, though unimproved, I have refused 8500 dollars. It has  
since been laid off into proper size lots for building on, three or four of  
which are let on ground rent for ever, at three dollars a foot on the  
street ; and this price is asked for both fronts on Pitt and Prince-street.  
  
WINCHESTER.  
  
u. As neither the lot in the town or common have any improvements  
on them, it is not easy to fix a price; but as both are well situated, it is  
presumed the price annexed to them in the schedule is a reasonable va-  
luation.  
  
BATH.  
  
v. The lots in Bath (two adjoining) cost me to the best of my recollec-  
tion between 50 and 60 pounds, 20 years ago; and the buildings thereon  
£150 more. Whether property there has increased or decreased in its  
value, and in what condition the houses are, I am ignorant—but suppose  
they are not valued too high.  
  
STOCK.  
  
w. These are the sums which are actually funded, and though no more  
in the aggregate than 7,566 dollars, stand me in at least ten thousand  
pounds, Virginia money ; being the amount of bonded and other debts due  
to me, and discharged during the war, when money had depreciated in that  
rate— 7 and was so settled by public authority.  
  
x. The value annexed to these shares is what they actually cost me,  
and is the price affixed by law; and although the present selling price is  
under par, my advice to the Legatees (for whose benefit they are intend-  
ed, Ps paw those who can afford to lie out of the money) is that each  
should take and hold one—there being a moral certainty of a great and  
increasing profit arising from them in the course of a few years.  
  
y. It is supposed that the shares in the James River Company must  
also be productive : But of this I can give no decided opinion, for want of  
more accurate information.  
  
z. These are the nominal prices of the shares in the Banks of Alexan-  
dria and Columbia ; the selling prices vary according to circumstances ;  
but as the stock usually divides from eight to ten per cent, per annum,  
they must be worth the former, at least, so long as the Banks, are con-  
ceived to be secure, altho’ circumstances may sometimes make them  
below it.  
  
The value of the live stock depends more upon the quality than quanti-  
ty of the different species of it; and this again upon the demand and  
judgment, or fancy of purchasers. EORGE WASHINGTON
