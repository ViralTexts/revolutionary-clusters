Gentlemen of the Senate  
[2 Dec. 1793]  
  
As the present situation of the several nations of Europe, and especially of those with which the US. have important relations, cannot but render the state of things between them and us matter of interesting enquiry to the legislature, and may indeed give rise to deliberations to which they alone are competent, I have thought it my duty to communicate to them certain correspondences which have taken place.  
The Representative and Executive bodies of France have manifested generally a friendly attachment to this country, have given advantages to our commerce and navigation, and have made overtures for placing these advantages on permanent ground. A decree however of the National assembly, subjecting vessels laden with provisions to be carried into their ports, and making enemy goods lawful prize in the vessel of a friend, contrary to our treaty, tho revoked at one time as to the US. has been since extended to their vessels also, as has been recently stated to us. Representations on this subject will be immediately given in charge to our minister there, and the result shall be communicated to the legislature.  
It is with extreme concern I have to inform you that the proceedings of the person whom they have unfortunately appointed their Minister Plenipy. here have breathed nothing of the friendly spirit of the nation which sent him. Their tendency on the contrary has been to involve us in war abroad, and discord and anarchy at home. So far as his acts, or those of his agents, have threatened our immediate commitment in the war, or flagrant insult to the authority of the laws, their effect has been counteracted by the ordinary cognisance of the laws, and by an exertion of the powers confided to me. Where their danger was not imminent, they have been borne with, from sentiments of regard to his nation, from a sense of their friendship towards us,  from a conviction that they would not suffer us to remain long exposed to the action of a person who has so little respected our mutual dispositions, and, I will add, from a reliance on the firmness of my fellow-citizens in their principles of peace and order.—In the mean time I have respected and pursued the stipulations of our treaties, according to what I judged their true sense; and have witheld no act of friendship which their affairs have called for from us, and which justice to others left us free to perform.—I have gone further. Rather than employ force for the restitution of certain vessels which I deemed the US. bound to restore, I thought it more adviseable to satisfy the parties by avowing it to be my opinion, that if restitution  
were not made, it would be incumbent on the US. to make compensation. The papers now communicated will more particularly apprize you of these transactions.  
The vexations and spoliation understood to have been committed, on our vessels and commerce, by the cruizers and officers of some of the belligerent powers, appeared to require attention. The proofs of these however not having been brought forward, the description of citizens supposed to have suffered were notified, that on furnishing them to the Executive, due measures would be taken to obtain redress of the past, and more effectual provisions against the future. Should such documents be furnished, proper representations will be made thereon, with a just reliance on a redress proportioned to the exigency of the case.  
The British government having undertaken, by orders to the Commanders of their armed vessels, to restrain generally our commerce in corn and other provisions to their own ports and those of their friends, the instructions now communicated were immediately forwarded to our minister at that court. In the mean time some discussions on the subject, took place between him and them. These are also laid before you; and I may expect to learn the result of his special instructions in time to make it known to the legislature during their present session.  
Very early after the arrival of a British minister here, mutual explanations on the inexecution of the treaty of peace were entered into with that minister. These are now laid before you for your information.  
On the subjects of mutual interest between this country and Spain, negociations and conferences are now depending. The public good requiring that the present state of these should be made known to the legislature in confidence only, they shall be the subject of a separate and subsequent communication.

Gentlemen of the Senate and of  
the Houfe cf Repr^ffentativcs.  
As the prefent uteation of the  
feveral nations of hurope, and ef-  
pecially thole with which the Utii-  
ted States have important relati-  
ons, cannot but render tueitattl  
of tilings between them and 1 *  
matter of interelting enquiry to  
the legiflatnre, and may mdee 1  
give rile to deliberations to JBhic 1  
they alone are competent. J»aa&gt; !  
thought it my duty to communi-  
cate to them certain corresponden-  
ces which have taken p:ace.  
  
The representative and execu-  
tive bodies of France have mani-  
fefted generally a friendly attach-  
ment to this country ; have given  
advantages to our commerce and  
navigation, and have made o\e -  
tures for placing thofe advantages  
on permanent ground; a decree  
however of the National Alicmbly,  
fubjecting vel&#x27;els laden with prof  
vilions to be cariied into their  
ports, and making enemy goods  
lawful pri/.e in tne vcllels cf a  
friend, contrary to our treaty,  
though revoked at one time, as to  
the United States, has fiuce ex-  
tended to their vefiela alfo, as has  
been recently llaied to us. Re-  
presentations on this fubject will  
be immediately given in charge  
to our minifter there, and the re-  
jfu.lt fhall be communicated to the  
legillaturc.  
  
It is with extreme concern I  
have to inform you that the pro-  
ceedings of the pcrfon they have  
unfortunately appointed their Mi-  
nifter Plenipotentiary here, has  
breathed nothing of the friendly  
fpirit of the nation which font  
him ; their tendency on the con-  
trary has been to involve us in a  
w ar abroad, and difcord and anar-  
chy at home. So far as his acls  
or thofe of his agents have t hrtar-  
ned our immediate commitment  
in the war, or flagrant infult to  
the authority of the laws, their  
effect has been counteracted by the  
ordinary cognizance of laws, and  
by an exertion of the powers confi-  
ded to mc. Where their danger  
w as not imminent, they have been  
borne w ith, from fentimcnts of re-  
gard to his nation, from a fcnle of  
their fi iendfhip tow aids us, from a-  
conviction that they would r.ot fuff-  
er us to remain long expofedto t re-  
action of a pcrfon, w bo has fo little;  
refpectod our mutual difpelitions,  
and, 1 will add, from a rclinuo  
of ihe firmnefs of my fellow citi-  
zens in their principles of peace  
and order. In the mean time I  
have relpecfied and puifatd the  
ftipnlations of our treaties, accor-  
ding to what 1 judged their trnc  
lenfe, and have withheld no avl oC  
friendlhip, which their attaint  
have called for from us, and w! ii h  
infiice too-herslcft us free to ;;r.  
form*. I have gone further*;  
thcr than employ force for the t e.  
  
ftitution of certain veflels which I  
deemed the United States bound  
to reftorc, 1 thought it more ad-  
visable 10 fatisfy the parties by  
avowing it to be my opinion, that  
if rcltitution were not r»ade, it  
would be incumbent on the Uni-  
ted ytates to make conipenfation.  
The papers now communicated  
w ill more particularly apprize you  
of thefe traufactions.  
  
The vexations and fpoilation un-  
derltood to have been committed  
on our vell&#x27;cls and commerce, by  
the cruifers and oliicers of the be-  
ligerent powers, appeared to re-  
quire attention, the proofs of thefe  
however not hi\ingbecn brought  
forward, tlie de&amp;riptien of citi-  
zens fuppofed to have luffcred  
were notified; thai on furniihing  
them to the executive, due mea-  
fures would be taken to obtain rc-  
drefs of the patt, and more effect-  
ual proviliou againil the future.  
Shou] 1 fuch documents be furnilh-  
td, proper reprefentarions will be  
made thereon, with a jult reliance  
o,. a redrefs proportioned to the  
e&gt;.v;ci:cy of the cafe.  
  
Th&#x27;-* Britifh j),o\ernment having  
undertaken to reltrain generally  
our commerce in corn and other  
ptoViifOiyi to their own ports aid  
thole o$ their friends, the initruc-

mediately forVarded to our Mi-.ii-

lime fome difcuilioir, on the fub&gt;

you, and I may expeel to leave  
the refult of his fpecial inlh not!-

GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE, N  
and of the Hovsz of REPRESENTATIVES,  
  
  
with which the United States have important relations, cannot but render the

and may, indeed, give riſe to deliberations, to which they alone are competent, I have  
thought it my duty to communicate to them, certain correſpondences which have taken  
place. | 353 | „  
The repreſentative and executive bodies of France have manifeſted, generally. a friend-  
ly attachment to this country; have given advantages to our commerce and navigation,  
and have made overtures for placing theſe advantages on permanent ground; a decree,  
however, of the National Aſſembly, ſubjecting veſſels laden with proviſions, to be carried  
into their ports, and making enemy-goods lawful prize, in the veſſel of a friend, contrary  
  
  
to their veflels alſo, as has been recently ſtated to us: —Repreſentations on this ſubject

It is, with extreme concern, I have to inform you, that the proceedings of the p2rſo:,  
whom they have unfortunately appointed their miniſter plenipotentiary here, have brea-  
thed nothing of the friendly ſpirit of the nation which ſent him; their tendency, on the

war, or flagrant inſult to the authority of the laws, their effect has been counteracted  
by the ordinary cognizance of the laws, and by an exertion of the powers confided to me.  
Where their danger was not imminent, they have been borne with, from ſentiments of  
  
  
they would not ſuffer us to remain long expoſed to the action of a perſon, who has ſo lit-  
tle reſpected our mutual diſpoſitions ; and, I will add, from a reliance on the tirmneſs of  
my fellow-citizens, in their principles of peace and order. In the mean time I have  
reſpected and purſued the ſtipulations of our treaties, according to what I judged their  
  
  
States bound to reſtore, I thought it more adviſable to ſatisfy the parties, by avowing it to

held no act of friendſhip, Which their affairs have called for  
from us, and which juitice to others left us free to perform  
! have gone further. Rather than employ force for the  
reſtitution of certain veſſels, which I deemed the United  
States bound to reſtore, I thought it more advifable to ſa-  
tisfy the parties, by avowing it to be my opinion, that if  
reſtitution were not made, it would be incumbent on the  
United States to make compenſation. The papers now  
communicated will more particularly apprize you of theſe  
tranſactions, | |  
  
The vexations and ſpoliation, underſtood to have been  
committed on our veſſels and commerce, by the cruizers  
and officers of ſome of the belligerent powers, appeared tg  
require attention. The proofs of theſe, however, not hav-  
ing been brought forward, the deſcription of citizens ſup-  
poled to haye ſuffered, were notified, that on furniſhir  
them to the executive, due meaſures would be taken to ol?  
tain redreſs of the paſt, and more effectual proviſions againſt  
the future. Should ſuch documents be furniſhed, proper  
repreſentations will be made thereon, with a juſt reliance  
on a redreſs proportioned to the exigency of the caſe.  
  
The Britith Government having undertaken, þy orders tg  
the commanders of their armed veſſels, to reſtrain, generally,  
our commerce, in corn and other proviſions, to their own  
ports, and thoſe of their friends, the inſtructions now cor  
municated were immediately fowarded to dur Miniſter at  
that Court. In the mean time, ſome diſcuflions on the  
ſubjet took place —_— him and them: theſe ela  
  
( 130 )  
  
laid before you; and I may expect to learn the reſult of his  
ſpecial inſtructions, in time to make it known to the Legiſ-  
lature, during their preſent ſeſſion.  
  
Very early after the arrival of a Britiſh Miniſter here, mu-  
tual explanations on the inexecution of the treaty of peace  
  
  
fore you, for your information.  
  
Of the ſubjects of mutual intereſt between this country  
and Spain, negociations and conferences are now depending.  
The public good requiring that the preſent ſtate of theſe  
| ſhould be made known to the Legiſlature, in confidence only,  
  
they ſhall be the ſubject of a ſeparate and ſubſequent com-  
  
munication.
