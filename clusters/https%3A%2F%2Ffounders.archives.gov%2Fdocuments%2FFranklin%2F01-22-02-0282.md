o reply to Lord Howe.  
  
  
Eagle. June 20 [-July 12]. 1776.  
I cannot my Worthy Friend, permit the Letters and Parcels which I have sent in the State I receiv’d them, to be landed without adding a word upon the subject of the injurious Extremities in which our unhappy Disputes have engaged us.  
You will learn the Nature of my Mission from the Official Dispatches which I have recommended to be forwarded by the same Conveyance. Retaining all the Earnestness I ever express’d to see our Differences accomodated, I shall conceive, if I meet with the same Disposition in the Colonies which I was once taught to expect, the most flattering Hopes of proving serviceable in the Objects of the King’s paternal Sollicitude, by promoting the reestablishment of lasting Peace and Union with the Colonies. But if the deep rooted Prejudices of America and the necessity of preventing her Trade from passing into foreign Channells, must keep us still a divided People, I shall from every private as well as public motive, most heartily lament, that this is not the moment wherein those great Objects of my Ambition are to be attain’d; and that I am to be longer deprived of an Opportunity to assure you personally of the Regard with which I am your sincere and faithfull humble servant  
Howe.  
  
  
P.S. I was disappointed of the Opportunity I expected for sending this Letter at the Time it was dated, and have been ever since prevented by Calms and contrary winds, from getting Here to inform Genl. Howe of the Commission with which I have the Satisfaction to be charged, and of his being join’d in it.  
Sandy Hook. 12th. July.  
Howe  
Subscrib’d to Benjmn. Franklin Esq. Philadelphia

‘**Eagle, June 20th, 1776.  
  
‘IT cannot, my worthy friend, permit the letters  
and parcels which I have sent you, in the state I  
received them, to be landed without adding a  
  
1 This extract is kindly furnished us by Mr. O. A. Jenni-  
son, of Lansing, Michigan.  
  
  
  
word upon the subject of the injurious extremities  
in which our unhappy disputes have engaged us.  
  
** You will learn the nature of my mission from  
the official dispatches which I have recommended  
to be forwarded by the same conveyance. Re-  
taining all the earnestness I ever expressed, to see  
our differences accommodated, I shall conceive,  
if I meet with the disposition ih the Colonies  
which I was once taught to expect, the most flat-  
tering hopes of proving serviceable, in the objects  
of the King’s paternal solicitude, by promoting  
the establishment of lasting peace and union with  
the Colonies. But if the deep rooted prejudices  
of America, and the necessity of preventing her  
trade from passing into foreign channels, must  
keep us still a divided people, I shall, from every  
private, as well as public motive, most heartily  
lament that it is not the moment wherein those  
great objects of my ambition are to be attained ;  
and that I am to be longer deprived of an oppor-  
tunity to assure you personally of the regard with  
which I am  
  
‘* Your sincere and faithful humble servant,  
  
‘** Howe.

I expected for sending this letter at the time it  
was dated, and have been ever since prevented, by  
calms and contrary winds, from getting here to  
inform Gen. Howe of the commission with which  
I have the satisfaction to be charged, and of his  
being joined in it.
