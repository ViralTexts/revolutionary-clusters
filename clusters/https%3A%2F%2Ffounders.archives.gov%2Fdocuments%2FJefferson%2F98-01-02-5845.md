teries, and that  on particularly which is now askedIt is a common idea that games of chance are immoral. but what is Chance? nothing happens in this world without a cause. if we  know the cause , we do not call it chance; but if we do not know  it we say it was produced by Chance. if we see a loaded die turn it’s lightest side up, we know the cause and that it is not an effect of Chance.  but whatever side an unloaded die turns up not knowing the cause, we say it is the effect of Chance. yet  the morality of a thing cannot depend on our knolege or ignorance of  it’s cause. not knowing why   a particular side of an unloaded die turns up,  cannot make the act of throwing it immoral. if we consider games of chance immoral then every  pursuit of human industry is immoral, for there is not a single one that is not subject to  chance, not one wherein you do not risk  a loss on the chance of   some gain. the navigator e.g. risks his ship  in the hope  if she is not lost in the voyage  of gaining an advantageous freight, the merchant risks his cargo to gain a better price for it.  a proprietor builds a house on the risk of indemnifying himself by a rent.  the hunter  hazards his time in the hope of  killing game. in all these pursuits, you  stake  some one thing against another which you hope to win. but the greatest of all gamblers is the Farmer, who risks the seed he puts into the ground, the year’s labor on it, and the wear &amp; tear of his cattle and gear,  to win a  crop, which   too much or too little rain and the general uncertainties  of weather, waste Etc  often make a total or partial loss. these then are games of chance yet so far from being immoral they are indispensable to the existence of man, and every  one has a natural right to pursue such one of them as he thinks most likely to furnish him subsistence. almost all  these pursuits of chance produce something useful to society. but there are some which produce nothing, and endanger the well being of the individuals engaged in them or of others depending on them. such are games with cards, dice, billiards, Etc.  and altho’ the pursuit of them is a matter of natural right, yet the society percieving the irresistable bent of some of it’s members to pursue them, and the ruin produced by them to the families dependg on these individuals, consider it as a case of insanity quoad hoc,  step in to protect the individual against himself as in other cases of insanity, or infancy, imbecility, Etc and suppress the pursuit altogether and the natural right of  following it.  there are some other games of chance useful on certain occasions, and injurious only when carried to excess. such are insurances lotteries  raffles, Etc,                                              these they do not suppress, but take their regulation  under their own discretion.  the insurance of a ship  on a voyage, is a vocation of chance, yet useful, and the right therefore is left free to be exercised. so of houses against fire, of a doubtful debt, of the continuance of a life, and similar cases. money is wanting for an useful undertaking for which a direct tax would be disapproved.  it is raised therefore by a lottery wherein the tax is laid on the willing only, that is to say on those who can  risk the price of a ticket without injury, for the possibility of a high prize, an article of property, insusceptible of division  at all or not without great  loss is sometimes of so large value, as that no purchaser can be found, while the owner owes debts &amp; his creditors have no other chance of payment but by it’s sale at a fair price. here it is a salutary right of disposing of it by a lottery, wherein many run small risks for the chance of the high prize. in this way the great estate of the late Colo Byrd  was sold in 1756 which had the whole been brought into the market at once on forced sales, it would have  overdone the demand, would have sold at half or quarter value, and sacrificed the creditors,  the half or  three fourths of whom would have lost their debts. and this method of selling however became at length so  frequent as to nourish too much a spirit of hazard, and to induce the legislature  not to suppress altogether the practice of Lotteries  but to take them under their own special direction. this they did  for the 1st time by the act of 1769. c.17 before which time every person exercised the right freely, and since which time it is made unlawful but when authorised by a special law of the legislre.Since then the permission to exercise the right has been taken into the hands of the legislre let us examine the purposes for which they have permitted it in practice.1. it was for a long time an item of the standing revenue.1813. c.1.§3. an Act imposing taxes for the support of Govmt c.2.§.10.1814. Dec. c.1.§.3. same title or object.1814. Feb. c.1.§.3.1818. c.1.§.1.1819. c.1.1820. c.1.this then is a declarn  by the nation  that an act was not immoral of which they were in the habitual use  as a part of the regular means of  maintaining govmt, the tax on the Venders of the tickets  was their share of the profits, and if their share was innoncent, his cd not be criminal.2.  It has been abundantly permitted to raise money by lottery   for the purposes of schools, and in this, as in many other cases the lottery has been permitted to withhold a part of the money (generally about 15.p.c.) for the use  to which the lottery is to be applied. so that while the adventurers paid 100.D. for tickets they recd back in the form of prize 55. only the remaing 15. being the tax laid on them with their own consent. examples are1784.c.34.§5. authorizg city of Wmsbg to raise 2000.£ for a grammar school1789.c.68.

. there is one however not therein specified the most important in it’s consequences of any transaction in any portion of my life.   to wit the head I personally made agt the Federal principles and practices during the admn of mr Adams. their usurpns and  violns   of the constn at that period and their majority in both houses of Congress was so great, so decided, and so daring that after combating  their aggressions, the constn,  inch by inch and one by one, without being able  in the least to check their career, the Republican leaders thot it would be best for them to give up their useless efforts there, go home, get into their respective legislres, embody whatever of resistance they could be formed into, and if ineffectual to die there as in last ditch. all therefore retired, mr Gallatin alone remaining  in the H. of R. and myself in the Senate where I then presided as V. P.  we remained firmly at our posts bidding defiance to  the brow beatings and insults  with which they continually assailed us, in  and keeping the mass of republicans in phalanx together,  until the legislres could be led onto  the  and nothing on earth is more certain than that if myself particularly  placed for my office of V. P. at the head of the republicans, had given way and withdrawn from my post, the republicans  thro’out the Union would have given up in despair and the cause would have been lost for ever. by holding on, we obtained time for the legislatures to  come up with their weight, and   those of Virga and Ky particularly but more especially the former by their celebrated resolns saved the constn at it’s last gasp. no person who was not a witness of the  scenes of that gloomy period can form, any idea of the persecutions &amp; personal indignities we had to brook . they saved our country however the spirits of the people were so much subdued   rendered desperate   by the XYZ imposture and other stratagems and machinations that they would have sunk into apathy &amp; monarchy as the only form of govmt which could maintain itself.If legislve services are worth mentioning and the stamp of liberality and  equality which was necessary to be empressed on our laws in the first crisis of our revolution was of any value they will find that the leading and most important  laws  of that day were prepared  by myself and carried chiefly by my effort. supported indeed by able and faithful coadjutors from the ranks of the house, very effective  as seconds but who would not have taken the  field as leaders.The prohibition of the further importn of slaves was the first of these measures in time. this was followed by the abolition of entails which  broke up the hereditary high-handed aristocracy which by  accumulating immense masses of property in single lines of a family divided our citizens into two distinct  orders of nobles and  plebeians.But further to  compleat the equality among our citizens so essential to the maintenance of  republican govmt, I procured the abolition of the principle of primogeniture by the law  of descents  by myself which gave an equal inheritance in lands to sons &amp; daurs of .The  attack on the establishment of a dominant religion was first made by myself; it could be carried at first only by suspending salaries for one year    by battling again  at the next session for another year and so from year to year until the public mind was ripened for the bill for religious freedom which I had prepared for the revised code. this was at length established permanently by the efforts of mr Madison, being myself in Europe at the time that work was brought forward.To these particular services I think I might add the establmt of our University as principally my work,  acknoleging  as I do  the great assistance recieved from my able coadjutors  my living in the vicinity threw of course on myself the chief burthen of the  enterprise  as well of the buildings as of the general organization and care. the effect of this institution on the future fame fortune  and prosperity of our country can as yet be seen but at a distance. but 100. well educated youths which it will turn out annually and  ere long will fill all it’s offices with men of superior qualifns and raise it from it’s humbled state to an eminence among it’s associates which it has never yet know. that instn is now qualified to  raise it’s youth to an order of science unequalled in any other state and    this superiority will be the greater from the free range of  mind encouraged  there and the restraint at other seminaries by the shackles of a domineering hierarchy and a superstitutious adhesion to antient habits.  those now on the state of affairs will enjoy the   ineffable happiness of being succeeded by sons of an order of science  &amp; intellect unknown to themselves. our sister states will also be repairing to the same fountains of science will bring hither their genius to be kindled at our fires and will carry back the fraternal affections which nourished by the same Alma mater, will knit to them by us  the indissoluble bonds of early personal frdships. the good old Dominion the blessed mother  of us all will then raise her head with pride among the nations, will present to them that splendor of genius which she has ever possessed  but  has too long suffered to rest uncultivated &amp; unknown, and will become a centre of ralliance to the states whose youth she has instructed, and, as it were, adopted. I claim some share in the merits of this  great work of regeneration. my whole labors, now for many years, have been devoted to it, and I stand pledged to follow it up through the remnant of life remaining to me. and what remuneration do I ask? money from the treasury?—not a cent. I ask nothing  from the earnings or labors of my f. c. for I wish no man’s Comforts to be abridged for the enlargement of mine. for the services rend

‘I came of age in 1764, and was soon  
put into the nomination ofJustices of the  
county in which I live, and at the first  
election following, I became one of its  
representatives in the legislature.  
‘1 was thence sent to the Old Con­  
gress.  
‘Then employed two years with Mr.  
Pendleton and Mr. Wythe, on the re­  
visal and reduction to a single Code, of  
the whole body of the British statutes,  
the acts of our Assembly, and certain  
parts of the common la w.  
‘Then elected Governor. I  
‘Next to the Legislature; and to Qon­  
gress again.  
•Sent to Europe as Minister Plenipo­  
tentiary.  
‘Appointed Secretary of State to the  
new government.  
‘Elected Vice-President and Presi­  
dent.  
•And lastly, a Visitor and Rector of  
the University.  
‘In these different offices,with scarce­  
ly any interval between them, I have  
been in the public service now 61 years;  
and during the far greater part of the  
time, in foreign countries, or in other  
States.  
‘I legislative services are worth men­  
tioning and the stamp of liberality and  
equality, which were necessary to be  
impressed on our laws, in the first crisis  
of our birth as a nation, was of any va­  
lue, they will find that many of the  
leading and important laws of that day,  
were prepared by myself, and carried  
chiefly by my efforts; supported indeed  
by able and faithful coadjutors.  
‘The prohibition of tne further im­  
portation of slaves was the fir&amp;t of these  
measures in time.  
  
• l nis was followed by the abolition  
of entails which broke up the heredi­  
tary and high-handed aristocracy,  
which,by accumulating immense mass­

had divided our country into two dis  
tinct orders of nobles and plebeians.  
‘But, further to complete the equality  
among our citizens, so essential to the

ment, it was necessary to abolish the  
principle of primogeniture: I drew the  
la w of descents givingequal inheritance  
to sons and daughters, which made a  
part of the revised Code.  
‘The attack on the establishment of  
a dominant religion, was first made by  
myself. It could be carried at first, on­  
ly by a suspension of salar s one  
year, by battling it again at the next  
session for another year, and so, from  
year to year, until the public mind was

hand writing of Mr. Jefferson. He was called  
on by a particular occasion to state some ol the  
circumstances and services of his life—and from  
this curious document, for which we are in­  
debted to the kindness of a friend, we lay the  
following Extract before our leaders: It fur­  
nishes some information, in that touching style  
for which the author was so remarkable, which,  
now that the great man has des&lt; ended to his  
tomb, it may not be improper to lay before the  
public: &#x27;  
‘ I came of age in 1764, and was soon put in­  
to the nomination of Justices of the county in  
which I live,.and at the first election following,  
I became one of its representatives in the le­  
gislature.  
‘ I was thence sent to the Old Congress.  
‘ Then employed two years with Mr. Pendle­  
ton and Mr. Wythe, on the revisal and reduc­  
tion to a single Code, of the whole body of the  
British Statutes, the acts of our Assembly, and  
certain parts of the common law.  
1 Then elected Governor.  
* Next to the Legislature, and to Congress a­  
gain.  
‘ Sent to Europe as Minister Plenipotentiary.  
* Appointed Secretary of State to the new go  
vernment.  
4 Elected Vice-President and President.  
4 And lastly, a Visitor and Rector of the Uni­  
versity.  
‘In these different offices, with scarcely any  
interval between them, I have been in the public  
service now 61 years; and during the far greater  
part of the time in foreign countries, or in oth­  
er States.

and the stamp of liberality and equality, which  
was necessary to be impressed on our laws, in  
the first crisis of our birth as a nation, was of  
any value, they will find that many of the lead­

mense masses of property in single lines of fa­  
mily, had divided our country into two distinct  
orders of njbres and plebians.  
k But, further to complete the equality among  
our citizens, so essential to the maintenance of  
republican government, it was necessary to a­  
boiish the principle of primogeniture: I drew  
the law of descents, giving equal inheritance  
to sons and daughters, which made a part of  
the Revised Code  
x The attack on the establishment of a domi­  
nant religion, was first made by myself. It  
could be carrted at first, onlyby a suspension  
of salaries for one year, by battling it again at  
the next session for another year, and so, from  
year to year, until the public mind was ripened  
for the bill for establishing religious freedom,  
which I had prepared for the Revised Code al­  
so. This was at length established permanent­  
ly, and by the efforts chiefly of Mr. Madison,

was brought forward.

a centre of ralliance to the states, whose youths  
she has instructed, and, as it were, adopted.

If legislative services ar* worth mentioning,  
and the stamp of liberality and equality, which was  
necessary to be impressed on our laws, in the first  
crisis of our birth as a nation, was of any value,  
they will find that many of the leading and impor­  
tant laws of that day were prepared by myself, and  
carried chiefly by my efforts—supported, indeed,  
by able and faithful coadjutors  
The prohibition of the further importation of  
slaves was the first of these measures in time.  
This was followed by the abolition ot entails,  
which broke up the hereditary and high handed  
aristocracy, which, by accumulating immense mass  
es of property in single lints of iamily, had  
divided our country into two distinct orders, of no­  
bles and plebeians.  
But further to complete the equality among our  
citizens, so essential to the maintenance of Repub­  
lican Government, it was necessary to abolish the  
principle of primogeniture ; I drew the law of de­  
scents, giving equal inheritance to sons and daugh  
ters, which made a part of the Revised Code.  
The attack on the establishment uf a dominant  
religion, was first made by myself. It could be  
carried at first only by a suspension of salaries for  
one year, by battling it again at the next session or  
another year or so, from year to year, until the  
puDlic mind was ripened (or the bill lor establishing  
religious freedom, which &gt; had prepared for the  
Revised Code also. This was at length established  
peimanently, and by the efforts chiefly of Mr.  
Madison, being myself in Europe at the time that  
woikwas brought (orward.  
I think 1 might add the establishment of our Uni  
veisity. My residence in the vicinity threw, ol  
course, on me. the chief burden of the enterprise,  
ns well of the buildings as of the gencal organiza­  
tion and care of the whole. The effect of this in­  
stitution oil the future fame, fortune, and prosperity  
of our country, can as yet be seen but at a distance.  
But an hundr d well educated youths, which it will  
turn out annually, and, eie long, will fill al! its of  
fices with men of superior qualifications, and raise  
it from its humbled state to an eminence among its  
associates, which it has never yet known, no, not in  
its brightest days. Those now on the theatre ol  
affairs, will enjoy the ineffable happiness oi seeing  
themselves succeeded by sons of a grade of science,  
beyond their own ken. Our siater States will also  
by repairing to the same fountains of instruction, w ill  
bring hither their genius lo be kindled at our fire,  
and will carry back the fraternal affections, which, j  
nourishtd by the same Alma Mater, will knit us toj  
them by the indissoluble bonds of early personal,  
friendships. The good Old Dominion, the blessed |  
mother of us all, will then raise her head with piide j  
among the nations, wilt present to them that splen  
dor of genius which she has ever possessed, but has  
too long suffered to rest uncultivated and unknown,  
and will become a centre of railiance to the States,  
whose youths she has instructed, and, as it were,  
ad -pted  
1 claim some share in the merit of til&#x27;s great  
work of regeneration. My whole labors, now for  
many years, have been devoted to it, and I stand  
pledged to follow it up through the remnant ol fife  
remaining to me.

If legislative services are worth mentioning, and  
the stamp of liberality and equatity which was ne-  
cessary to be impressed on our Jaws, in the first crisis  
of our birth as a nation, was of any value, they will  
find that many of the leading and important laws of  
that day, were prepared by myself, and carried chief-  
ly by my efforts, supported, indeed, by able and faith-  
ful coadjutors.  
  
The prohibition of the further importation of slaves  
was the first of these measures in time.  
  
This was followed by the abolition of entails,  
which broke up the hereditary and high-handed aris-  
tocracy, which, by accumulating immense masses of  
property in single lines of family, had divided our  
country into two distinct orders of nobles and ple-  
bians.  
  
But, further to complete the equality among our  
citizens, so essential to the maintenance of republi-  
can government, it was necessary to abolish the prin-  
ciple of primogeniture: 1 drew the law of descents,  
giving equal inheritance to sons and daughters, which  
made a part of the revised code.  
  
The attack on the establishment of a dominant re-  
ligion, was first made by myself. It could be carried  
at first, only by suspension of salaries for one year,  
by battling it again at the next session for another  
year, and so, from year to year, until the public mind  
was ripened for the bill for establishing religious free-  
dom, which I had prepared for the revised code also.  
This was, at length, established permanently, and by  
the efforts chiefly of Mr. Madison, being myself in  
Kurope at the time that work was brought forward.  
  
1 think I might add the establishment of our uni-  
versity. My residence in the vicinity threw of course  
on me the chief burthen of the enterprise, as well of  
the buildings, as of the general organization and care  
of the whole. The effect of this institution on the fu-  
ture fame, fortune and prosperity of our country, can  
as yet be seen butat a distance. But an hundred  
well educated youths, which it will turn out annually,  
and, ere long, will fill all its offices with men of su-  
perior qualifications, and raise it from its humbie  
state to an eminence among its associates, which it  
has never yet known, no, not in its brightest days.—  
Those now on tne theatre of affairs, will enjoy the  
ineffable happiness of seeing themselves succeeded  
by sons of a grade of science, beyond their own ken.  
Our sister states will also be repairing to the same  
fountains of instruction will bring hither their genius  
to be kindled at our fire, and will carry back the fra-  
ternal affections, which, nourished by the same Alma  
Mater, will knit us to them by the indissoluble bonds  
  
7  
  
  
  
of early personal friendships. The good Old Domin-  
  
&gt;  
  
  
  
lt tt ~  
  
ion, the blessed mother of us all, will then raise her  
head with pride among the nations, will present to  
them that splendour of genius, which she has ever  
possessed, but has too long suffered to rest unculti-  
vated and unknown, and will become a centre of ral-  
liance to thestates, whose youths she has instructed,  
and, as it were, adopted.  
  
I claim some share in the merit of this great work  
of regeneration. My whole labors, now for many  
years, have been devoted to it, and I stand pledged  
to follow it up, through the remnant of life remain-  
ing to me.””*

on by a particular occasion to state some of  
the circumstances and services of his life—  
and from this curious document, for which we  
are indebted to the kindness of a friend, we  
lay the following ‘extract before our readers.  
s T e author was so remarkable,  
which, now that the great man has descended  
to his tomb, it may not be improper to lay be  
fore the public. :  
Tre DocumEeNT.  
I came of age in 1764, and was soon put in­  
to the nomination of Justices of the county in  
which I live, and at the first election follow­  
ing, 1 became one of its representatives in the  
Legislature. : .  
I was thence sent to the Old Congress.  
Then employed two years with Mr. Pen­  
dleton and Mr. Wythe, on the revisal and re­  
duction to a single Code, of the whole body of  
the British statutes, the acts of our Assembly,  
and certain parts of the common law. .  
Then elected Governor.” -  
Next to the Legislature, and to Congress  
again. ’ R  
Sent to Europe, as Minister Plenipotentiary.  
Appointed Secretary of State to the new  
government. &#x27;  
Elected Vice-President and President.  
And lastly, a Visitor and Rector of the Uni­  
versity. ; :  
. In these different offices, with scarcely any  
interval between them, I have been in the  
public service now sixty-one years; and du­  
ring the far greater part of the time in fo­

oAk }egislative setvices are worth mention­  
ing, and the stamp of liberalify and equalitys  
  
whicl was necéssary tfo be impressed on ordr  
laws, in the first crisis of our birth as a nation,  
was of any value, they will find that many of  
the leading and important laws of that day  
were prepared by myself, and carried chiefly  
by my efforts; supported indeed by able and  
faithful coadjutors. - g ;  
The prohibition of the further importation  
of slaves was the first of thesc mneasures in  
time. :  
&#x27;This was followed by the abolition of en­  
tails, which broke up hereditary and high­  
handed aristocracy, which by accumulating  
immense masses of property iu single lines of  
family had divided our country iuto two dis­  
tinct orders of nobles and plebeians.  
But, further to complete the equality among  
our citizeus, so essential to the maintenance  
of republican government, it was necessary to  
abolish the principle of primogeniture: 1 drew  
the law of descents, giving equal ipheritance  
to sons and danghters, which made a part of  
the Revised Code.  
The attack on the establishment of a domi­  
nant religion, was first made by myself. It  
could be carried at first, only by a suspension  
of salaries for one year, by battling it again at  
the next session or another year, and so, {roin  
year to year, until the public mind was ripen­  
ed for the bill for establishing religious free­  
dom, which I had prepared for the Revised  
Code also. This wasat lenoth establishied per-,  
manently; and by the elforts chiefly of Mr,  
Madison, being wmyself in Lurope at the tine.  
that work was brought forward.  
I think I might add the establishment of our  
University. My residence in the vicinity  
threw of course on me the chief burden of the  
enterprise, as well of the buildings as of the  
general organization and care of the whole.  
The effect of thisinstitutionon the future fame,  
and pmsperity of our country, can as yetbe  
seen but at a distance. But a hundred well  
cducafed youths, which it will turn out annu­  
ally, and ere long, wilkfill all itsoffices with  
men ¢f superior qualifications, and “raise it  
from its humbled #tate to an eminence among  
its associates, which it has never yet known,  
no, not in its brightest days. Those now on  
the theatre of affairs; will -enjoy the ineffable  
happiness of seeing themselves succeeded by  
sons of a grade of science. beyond their own  
ken. Our sister States will also be repairing  
to the same fountaias of instruction, will bring  
bither their genius to be kindled at our fire,  
and will carry back the fraternal affections,  
which rourished by the same Alma Mater, will  
knit us to them by the indissoluble bonds of  
early personal friendships. The good Old Do­  
minion, the blessed mother of us ail, will then  
raise her head with pride among the nations,  
will present to them that splendour of ‘genius,  
which she has ever possessed, but has too long  
suffered to rest uncultivated and unknown,  
and will become a centre of reliance to the  
States, whose youths she has instructed, and,  
as it were, adopted.  
I claim some share in the merit of this great  
work of regeneration. My whole labours,  
now for many years, have been devoted to it,  
and Istand pledged to follow it up, through  
the remnant of life remaining to me

federal principles and proceedings, during the administration of  
Mr. Adams. He says—  
  
‘Their usurpations and violations of the constitution at that period,  
and their majority in both Houses of Congress, were so great, so decided,  
and so daring, that after combating their aggressions, inch by inch, with-  
out being able in the least to check their career, the republican leader  
thought it would be best for them to give up their useless efforts there,  
go home, get into their respective legislatures, embody whatever of resist-  
ance they could be formed into, and, if ineffectual, to perish there as in  
the last ditch. All, therefore, retired, leaving Mr. Gallatin alone in the  
House of Representatives, and myself in the Senate, where I then pre-  
sided as Vice President. Remaining at our posts, and bidding defiance  
to the browbeatings and insults by which they endeavoured to drive us off  
also, we kept the mass of republicans in phalanx together, until the legis-  
latures could be brought up to the charge; and nothing on earth is more  
certain, than that if myself particularly, placed by my office of Vice-  
President at the head of the republicans, had given way and withdrawn  
from my post, the republicans throughout the Union would have given up  
in despair, and the cause would have been lost for ever. By holding on,  
we obtained time for the legislatures to come up with their weight; and  
those of Virginia and Kentucky particularly, but more especially the  
former, by their celebrated resolutions, saved the constitution at its last  
gasp. No person who was not a witness of the scenes of that gloomy  
period, can form any idea of the afflicting persecutions, and personal in-  
dignities we had to brook. They saved our country, however.’—vol. iv,

## [THE LOTTERY QUESTION.](http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/37119795)

merits of this question in all its  
bearings ; — THOUGHTS ON LOTTERIES. ; It  
is a common idea that games of chance  
are immoral; but what is chanco? Nothing  
hapi pens in this world without a cause;  
if we know the cause, we do not call it  
chance, but if we do not know it, we say  
it was produced by chance; if wo see a  
loaded die turn its lightest side up, we  
know tho cause, and that is not tho  
effect of chance ; but whatever sido an  
unloaded, dio turns up, not knowing tho  
cause, wo say it is tho effect of chanco  
; yet tho morality of a thing cannot  
dopond upon our knowledge or ignorance  
of its cause ; not knowing why a  
particular sido ot an unloaded dio turns  
up cannot raalco tho act of throwing it,  
or hotting on it, immoral ; if wo  
consider games of chance iremoral, then  
every pursuit of human industry is  
immoral, for thero is not a single one  
that is not subject to chanco — nor one  
wherein you do not risk a loss for the  
chance of some gain. The navigator, for  
example, risks his ship in the hope (if  
sho is not lost in tho voyage) of  
gaining an advantageous freight; the  
merchant risks liis cargo to gain a  
bettor price for it ; a landholder  
builds a house on tho risk of  
indemnifying himself by a rent; tho  
hunter hazards his (imo and trouble in  
tho hopo of killing game ; in all these  
pursuits you stake somo ono thing  
against another, which you hope to win ;  
but the greatest of all gamblers is tho  
farmer; lie risks his seed that ho puts  
into tho ground, the rent that ho pays  
for tho ground itself, tho year&#x27;s labour  
on lr, and the wear and tear of his  
cattlo and gear, to win a orop_ which  
tho chances of too much or too littlo  
rain, and general uncertainty of  
weather, insocts, waste, &amp;c, often make  
a partial or total loss. These, then,  
are gamos of chanco; yet, so far from  
being immoral, they are indispensable to  
the existence of man, and every ono has  
a natural right to choose for his  
pursuit such ono of. them as he thinks  
most, likely to furnish him subsistence.  
Almost all these pursuits of chance  
produce something useful to society ;  
but thero are somo which produce  
nothing, and endanger the welfaro of the  
individuals engaged in them, or others  
depending on them ; such, are games with  
cards, dice, billiards, &amp;c, and although  
tho pursuit of thorn is a matter of  
natural right, yet society perceiving  
tho irresistible bent of somo of its  
members to pursue them, and the ruin  
produced by them to tho families  
depending on theso individuals, consider  
it as a case of insanity, quoad hoc step  
in to protect the family and tho party  
himself, as in other cases of insanity,  
infancy, imbecility, &amp;c, and suppress  
the pursuit altogether, and tho natural  
right of following it. Thero aro somo  
other games .- of chance usoful on  
cortain occasions, and injurious, only  
when carried beyond thoir usoful bounds  
j such are insurances, lotteries,  
raffles, &amp;c. ; these they do not  
suppress, but take thoir regulation  
under thoir own&#x27; discretion. Tho  
insurance of ships on voyages is a  
vocation of chnnce, yot useful, and tho  
right to exorcise it therefore left  
free. So of houses against fire,  
doubtful dobts, tho continuance .of a  
particular life, and similar cases ;  
money is wanting for an usoful  
undertaking, as a school, &amp;c, for which  
a direct tax is disapproved; it is  
raised, therefore, by a lottery, wherein  
tho tax is laid on the willing only,  
that is to say, on those who can risk  
tho j prico of a ticket without sensible  
injury, for tho possibility of a higher  
prioo. An article of property  
insusceptible of division at all, or not  
without a great diminution of ?&#x27; its  
worth, is sometimes of so&#x27; largo a value  
as that no purchaser can be found, while  
tho owner; owes debts, has no other  
moans of payment, and his creditors no  
other chance.of obtaining it, but by its  
sale at a full; and fair prico; tho  
lottery is hero a salutary instrument  
for disposing of it, whore many run  
small risks for tho chance of obtaining  
a high prize. In this way tho great  
estate of the late Colonel Byrtl&#x27;/in  
17BG) was made competont to pay his  
debts, which, had the wholo been brought  
into the market at onco, would havo  
overdone the demand, would havo sold at  
half or quarter the valuoj and sa^  
crificed tho creditors, half or throe-  
fourths of whom would havo lost their  
debts. This method of selling was very  
much resorted to formerlyi until it was  
thought too much of n spirit.of hazard ;  
the Legislature was therefore induced  
not to suppress it altogether, but to  
take it under their own spocial  
regulation. This thoy ? did for tho  
first timo by their act of 1769, o. 17,  
before which timo every person exercised  
the right freely, and since which timo  
it is made ! unlawful but whon approved  
of by a special act &#x27;of tho Legislature.  
Since thon this right ? of sale by way  
of lottery has boon exer1 ciBod only  
under tho discretion of tlio  
Legislature. Lot us examino&#x27; the  
purposes for i which thoy havo allowed  
it in practice, not ! looking beyond the  
date, of our indepondonco; it was for a  
long, tirao .am item of tho standing

declaration by tho nation,- that ari act  
was not immoral of which they were in  
the habitual usp themselvos, as a part  
of the regular means of supporting the  
government; ? tlio tax on tho , vender  
of tickets was their share of ? tho,  
profits, land if thoir sharo was  
innocent his share-could, not be  
criminal. It has boon abundantly  
permitted to raiao monoy by lottory for  
the pur-&#x27; posos of schools, and in this,  
as in many other&#x27; cases, tho lottery has  
boon permitted to retain a* part of tlio  
money (gonoraUy from 10 to 16 per cont.)  
for the uso to which tho lottory has  
been applied ; so that while the  
advonturors paid 100 dollars for

&quot; Their usurpations and violations  
of the constitution at that period, and their ma  
jority in both Houses of Congress, were so great,  
so decided, and so daring, that after combating  
their aggressions, inch by inch, without being able  
in the least to check their career, the republican  
leaders thought it would be best for them to give  
up their useless efforts there, go home, get into  
their respective legislatures, embody whatever of  
resistance they could be formed into, and if inef  
fectual, to perish there as in the last ditch. All,  
therefore, retired, leaving Mr. Gallatin alone in  
the House of Representatives, and myself in the  
Senate, where I then presided as Vice-President  
Remaining at our posts, and bidding defiance to  
the brow-beatings and insults by which they en­  
deavored to drive us off also, we kept the mass of  
republicans in phalanx together, until the legisla­

nothing on earth is more certain, than that if my  
self particularly, placed by my olhce of Vlce-Tre-sident

ing is an extract.  
There are some other games of chance useful on cor  
occasions and injurious only when carried beyond  
mheilr oseful bounds. Such are insurances, lottories, rati  
be.These they do not suppress, but take their rorae  
under their own discretion. The insurance of ships  
on voyages is a vocation of chance, yet useful, and the  
right to exercise it is, therefore, left free. So of houses  
against are cdoubiful debts the continuance of a partion

the tax is laid on the willing only, that is to say, on  
those who can riak the price of a ticket without sensible

of property insusceptible of division at all, or  
not without great diminution of its worth, is  
sometimes of so large a value that no purchaser can be  
found, while the owner owes debts, has no other means  
of payment, and iis crediters no other chanes of obtam

the great estate of the late Colonel Byrd (1750) was made  
competent to pay his debts, which, had the whole been  
brought into the market at once, would have overdone the  
demand, would have sold at a half or a quarter the value,  
  
and saificed the credtors half or thre uarter of

the pursuits of industry were immoral, because  
both depended on chance. Ie cited a large num

fied, the most important in its consequences of  
any transaction in any portion of my life, to  
wit, the head I personally made against the  
Federal principles, and proceedings, during  
the administration of Mr. Adams. Their  
usurpations, and vio&#x27;ations of the Constitu-  
tion, at that period, and their majorities in  
both Houses of Congress were so great, so  
decided, and so daring, that after contesting  
their aggressions, inch by inch, without being  
able, in the least, to check their career, the  
Republican leaders thought it would be best  
for them to give up their useless efforts there,  
go home, and get into their respective Legis-  
latures, embody whatever resistance they  
could be formed into, and if ineffectual, to  
perish there as in the last ditch. ll, there-  
fore, retired, leaving Mr. Gallatin alone in  
the House of Representatives, and myself in  
the Senate, where I presided as Vice-Presi-  
dent. Remaining at our posts, and bidding  
defiance to the brow-beatings and insults, by  
which they endeavored to drive us off also,  
we kept the mass of Republicans in phalanx  
together, until the Legislatures could be  
brought up to the charge; and nothing on  
earth is more certain, than that if I myself,  
particularly, placed by my office of Vice-Pre-  
sident, at the head of the Republicans, hed  
given way, and withdrawn from my post, the  
Republicans, throughout the Union, would  
have given up in despair, and the cause  
would have been lost forever. By holding  
oa, we obtained time for the Legislatures to  
come up with their weight; and those of  
Virginia particularly; but more especiatly  
the former, by their celebrated resolutions,  
saved the Constitution at its last gasp. No per-  
son who was not a witness of the scenes of  
that gloomy period, can form any idea of the  
afflicting persecutions, and personal indigni-  
ties we had to brook, They saved our coun  
try, how-ver. ‘The spirits of the people were  
so much subdued, and reduced to despair by  
the X, Y, Z imposture, and other stratagems  
and machinations, that they would have sunk  
into apathy and monarchy, as the only form  
of government which could maintain itself.
