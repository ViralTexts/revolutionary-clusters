What makes the formal completion and  
signing of this document especially deserv-  
ing of celebration is the fact that thereafter  
it only remained for the States to ratify it,  
which they proceeded severally and with  
due deliberation to do. In the current rec-

pears only as a “report.” Thus, in the
