than by setting forth the two forms of indictment  
respectively used before and after the passing of such  
statute.  
  
We will suppose that a certain John Smith, being  
an with a woman, Frances Bolt, throws a candle-  
stick at, and kills her.  
  
Now, the old form of indictment against John Smith  
would, in its very shortest form, be thus worded:  
  
Middlesex to wit—The jurors for our lord the king,  
upon their oaths present, that John Smith, late of  
Westminster, in the county of Middlesex, labourer, not  
having the fear of God before his eyes, but being  
moved and seduced by the instigation of the devil, on  
the first day of May, in the fourth year of the reign of  
our sovereign lord George the Third, by the grace of  
God, King of Great Britain, France, and Ireland,  
defender of the faith, and so forth, with force and arms  
at Westminster aforesaid, in the county aforesaid, in  
and upon one Frances, the wife of one William Bolt,  
late of Westminster aforesaid, carpenter, in the peace  
of God and our said lord the king, then and there being,  
feloniously, wilfully, and of his malice aforethoucht,  
did make an assault ; and that he, the said John Smith,  
a certain brass candlestick of the value of one shilling,  
which he in his right hand then and there had, and  
held, did then and there, at and against the said  
Frances, cast and throw; and with such candlestick  
aforesaid, so cast and thrown by him, the said John  
Smith as aforesaid, in and upon the head of her, the  
said Frances, on the right side thereof, near to the  
temporal muscle, then and there feloniously, wilfully,  
and of his malice aforethought, did strike and bruise
