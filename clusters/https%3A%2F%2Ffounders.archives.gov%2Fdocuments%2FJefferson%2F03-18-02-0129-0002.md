ttee of Finance, to whom was referred the memorial of the Trustees of the Transylvania University, praying for a repeal of the duties on books imported into the United States—  
REPORT:  
That the act of Congress of the 27th April, 1816, establishing the existing tariff, has included books among the unenumerated articles, at an ad valorem of 15 per cent.  
The second section of that act exempts from duty “all articles for the use of the United States, philosophical apparatus, instruments, books, maps, statues, busts, casts, paintings, drawings, engravings, specimens of sculpture, cabinets of coins, gems, medals, and all other collections of antiquities, statuary, modelling, painting, drawing, etching, or engraving, specially imported by order and for the use of any society incorporated for philosophical or literary purposes, or for the encouragement of the fine arts, or by order and for the use of any seminary of learning.”  
To justify an encroachment upon this tariff, by the exemption of particular articles, we should consider its effects, and understand its bearing, upon the general system. It is possible that the exemption required would be chiefly felt in the price of the article exempted, and the manufacture of paper and printing types; and that its influence would be imperceptible or trifling upon the other branches of enterprise and industry. It may then be considered in its operations upon the manufactures, the revenue, and the consumption.  
The constitution of the United States has placed authors under the protection of Congress. Essential to this protection is the encouragement of printing. Could foreigners maintain a successful competition with the American publisher, the American author would experience embarrassment and disappointment: foreign books would inundate the literary market, and even his own productions from a foreign press might be made to impair, if not defeat, his exclusive right.  
The art

. The inquiry then is, what portion of the community requires this repeal? Every college, academy, and other seminary; and every corporation for literary purposes is now exempt. All members and students of these institutions are consequently exonerated of the burden of this tax. The question recurs who is to experience the benefit of the exemption? Surely not the instructors nor students in the higher branches of literature, for they are already relieved; certainly not the members of our common schools, for ordinary British editions are compensated by a bounty; American school books are plenty and cheap, and those in foreign languages are not required for general use. And it is equally certain that our manufactories forbid it, and our treasury can scarcely afford it. None then but the professional gentleman who can afford to extend his library beyond the resources of American publishers, or the scholar of wealth and leisure, who would indulge his taste in selecting the most elegant and expensive editions of foreign authors, can be interested in its favor. And is it expedient, at this time, to interpose this relief?  
To tax foreign luxuries is a dictate of the soundest policy. Expensive and highly finished editions are as much a luxury as any other extravagant expenditure. A moderate duty on such books, to be limited almost exclusively to gentlemen of wealth, could never subject us to the imputation of an indifference to education. Few nations, perhaps, have done more for the diffusion of knowledge.—In

.  
With few exceptions, the English is our native and ordinary language. It is spoken as universally and purely as in England itself. But lately, we were a part of the British empire; from thence we have derived many of our habits, customs, and laws. We still esteem Great Britain eminent in arts, sciences, policy, and power. Our principal and subordinate seminaries of learning are chiefly furnished with British books, and our youth are taught by British authors, wedded to their own institutions, and exultingly proud of their country, constitution, and laws. These means of a foreign influence have long been perceived, and have excited the jealousy of grave and intelligent politicians. Our government is peculiar to ourselves, and our books of instruction should be adapted to the nature of the government, and the genius of the people. In the best of foreign books, we are liable to meet with criticisms and comparisons not very flattering to the American people. In American editions of these, the offensive or illiberal parts are expunged or explained, and the work is adapted to the exigencies and taste of an American reader. But withdraw the protection which our tariff affords, our channels of instruction will be foreign, our youth will imbibe sentiments, form attachments, and acquire habits of thinking adverse to our prosperity, unfriendly to our government, and dangerous to our liberties.

‘* The inquiry, then, is, What portion of the  
community requires this repeal? Every col-  
lege, academy, and other seminary, and every  
corporation for literary purposes, is now ex-  
empt. All members and students of these in-  
stitutions are, consequently, exonerated of the  
burden of this tax. ‘The question recurs, Who  
is to experience the benefit of the exemption ?  
Surely not the instructors, nor students in the  
higher branches of literature; for they are  
already relieved. Certainly not the members  
of our common schools; for ordinary British  
editions are compensated by a bounty. Ame-  
rican school-books are plenty and cheap, and  
those in foreign languages are not required for  
general use ; and it is equally certain that our  
manufactories forbid it, and our Treasury  
can scarcely afford it. None, then, but the  
professional gentleman, who can afford to ex-  
tend his library beyond the resources of Ame-  
rican publishers, or the scholar of wealth and  
leisure, who would indulge his taste in select-  
ing the most elegant and expensive editions  
of foreign authors, can be interested in its fa-  
vor. And is it expedient at this time to in-  
terpose this relief? To tax foreign luxuries  
is a dictate of tbe soundest policy. Expensive  
and highly finished editions are as much a  
luxury as any other extravagant expenditure.  
A moderate duty on such books, to be limited  
almost exclusively to gentlemen of wealth,  
could never subject us to the imputation of  
an indifference to education. Few nations  
perhaps, have done more for the diffusion of  
knowledge. . .

‘* With few exceptions, the English is our  
native and ordinary language. Itisspokenas  
universally and purely as in England itself.  
But lately, we were a part of the British Em-  
pire. From thence we have derived many of  
our habits, customs, and laws. We still es-  
teem Great Britain as eminent in arts, sciences,  
policy, and power. Our principal and sub-  
ordinate seminaries of learning are chiefly  
furnished with British books, and our youth  
are taught by British authors, wedded to  
their own institutions, and exultingly proud  
of their country, constitution, and laws.  
These means of a foreign influence have long  
been perceived, and have excited the jealousy  
of grave and intelligent politicians. Our  
Government is peculiar to ourselves, and our  
books of instruction should be adapted to the  
nature of the Government and the genius of  
the people. In the best of foreign books we  
are liable to meet with criticisms and com-  
parisons not very flattering to the American  
people. In American editions of these, the  
offensive or illiberal parts are expunged or  
explained, and the work is adapted to the exi-  
gencies and taste of an American reader.  
But withdraw the protection which our tariff  
affords, our channels of instruction will ba for-  
eign, our youth will imbibe sentiments, form  
attachments, and acquire habits of thinkiog  
adverse to our prosperity, unfriendly to our  
Government, and dangerous to our liberties.”
