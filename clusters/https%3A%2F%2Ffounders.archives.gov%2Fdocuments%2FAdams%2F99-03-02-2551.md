As a kind of offset fjr the defeats and  
disasters experienced on the Canada Fron­  
tiers, our war managers dwell with no small

expedition against the Creeks, in his *fli­  
iial account of the battle of the 27th of  
March, states that the number of Indians in  
the engagement was 1000; of these 557  
were left dead on the field and a great num­
