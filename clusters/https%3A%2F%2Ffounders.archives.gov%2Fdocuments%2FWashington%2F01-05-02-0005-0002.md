These Gardens except in the number of young fruit Trees did not answer my expectations—The shrubs were trifling and the flowers not numerous.  
The Inhabitants of this place shewed us what respect they could, by making the best use of one Cannon to salute.  
On our return, we stopped at the Seats of General, and Mr. Gouvernr. Morris and viewed a Barn of which I have heard the latter speak much belonging to his farm—but it was not of a Construction to strike my fancy—nor did the conveniencies of it at all answer the cost.

ee entry for 7 Oct. 1789.  
  
  
  
  
  
Thursday 15th. Commenced my Journey about 9 oclock for Boston and a tour through the Eastern States. The Chief Justice, Mr. Jay and the Secretaries of the Treasury and War Departments accompanied me some distance out of the City. About 10 Oclock it began to Rain, and continued to do so till 11, when we arrived at  
  
the house of one Hoyatt, who keeps a Tavern at Kings-bridge  where we, that is Major Jackson, Mr. Lear and myself, with Six Servants which composed my Retinue, dined. After dinner through frequent light Showers we proceedd. to the Tavern of a Mrs. Haviland at Rye;  who keeps a very neat and decent Inn.  
  
The Road for the greater part, indeed the whole way, was very rough and Stoney, but the Land strong, well covered with grass and a luxurient Crop of Indian Corn intermixed with Pompions [pumpkins] (Which were yet ungathered) in the fields. We met four droves of Beef Cattle for the New York Market (about 30 in a drove) some of which were very fine—also a flock of Sheep for the same place. We scarcely passed a farm house that did not abd. in Geese. Their Cattle seemed to be of a good quality and their hogs large but rather long legged. No dwelling Ho. is seen without a Stone or Brick Chimney and rarely any without a shingled roof—generally the Sides are of Shingles also. The distance of this days travel was 31 Miles in which we passed through (after leaving the Bridge) East Chester New Rochel &amp; Marmeroneck; but as these places (though they have houses of worship in them) are not regularly laid out, they are scarcely to be distinguished from the intermediate farms which are very close together and seperated, as one Inclosure from another also is, by fences of Stone which are indeed easily made, as the Country is immensely Stony. Upon enquiry we find their Crops of Wheat &amp; Rye have been abundant  
  
—though of the first they had sown rather sparingly on Acct. of the destruction which had of late years been made of that grain by what is called the Hessian fly.  
  
Caleb Hyatt had purchased this inn from George Dyckman.  
  
  
Mrs. Haviland was Tamar Haviland, who kept an inn called the Square House at Rye in Westchester County. She was the widow of Dr. Ebenezer Haviland, who had served as surgeon to several New York regiments during the Revolution.  
  
  
  
  
Friday 16th. About 7 Oclock we left the Widow Havilands, and after passing Horse Neck [Greenwich] Six Miles distant from Rye, the Road through which is hilly and immensely stoney and trying to Wheels &amp; Carriages, we breakfasted at Stamford which is 6 miles further (at one Webbs)  a tolerable good house, but not equal in appearance or reality, to Mrs. Havilds. In this Town are an Episcopal Church and a Meeting house. At Norwalk which is ten miles further we made a halt to feed our Horses. To the lower end of this town Sea Vessels come and at the other end are Mills, Stores, and an Episcopal and Presbiterian Church. From hence to Fairfield where we dined and lodged, is 12 Miles; and part of it very rough Road, but not equal to that thro’ horse Neck. The superb Landscape, however, which is to be seen from the meeting house of the latter is a rich regalia. We found all the Farmers busily employed in gathering, grinding, and expressing the Juice of their Apples; the Crop of which they say is rather above Mediocrity. The Average Crop of Wheat they add, is about 15 bushels to the Acre from their fallow land—often 20 &amp; from that to 25. The Destructive evidences of British cruelty are yet visible both in Norwalk &amp; Fairfield; as there are the Chimneys of many burnt houses standing in them yet. The principal export from Norwalk &amp; Fairfield is Horses and Cattle—Salted Beef &amp; Porke, Lumber &amp; Indian Corn, to the West Indies—and in a small degree Wheat &amp; Flour.

Saturday 17th. A little after Sun-rise we left Fairfield, &amp; passing through Et. Fairfield breakfasted at Stratford, wch. is ten Miles from Fairfield, and is a pretty village on or near Stratford Rivr. The Road between these two places is not on the whole bad (for this Country)—in some places very gd. especially through Et. Fairfield wch. is in a plain, and free from Stone. There are two decent looking Churches in this place—though small—viz.—an Episcopal and Presbeterian, or Congregationalist (as they call themselves). At Stratford there is the same. At this place I was received with an effort of Military parade; and was attended to the Ferry which is near a mile from the Center of the Town, by sevl. Gentlemen on horse back. Doctr. Johnson of the Senate visited me here, being with Mrs. Johnson in this Town (where he formerly resided). The Ferry is near half a Mile; and sometimes much incommoded by Winds and cross tides. The Navigation for Vessels of about 75  
  
Tonns extends up to Darby, ten Miles higher, where it is said there is a pretty brisk trade. At Stratford they are establishing a Manufactury of Duck, and have lately turned out about 400 bolts. From the Ferry it is abt. 3 Miles to Milford, which is situated in more uneven and Stoney grd. than the 3 last Villages through wch. we passed. In this place there is but one Church, or in other words but one steeple—but there are Grist &amp; saw Mills and a handsome Cascade over the Tumbling dam; but one of the prettiest things of this kind is at Stamford occasioned also by damming the water for their Mills; it is near 100 yds. in width, and the water now being of a proper height, and the Rays of the Sun striking upon it as we passed, had a pretty effect upon the foaming Water as it fell. From Millford we took the lower road through West haven, part of which was good and part rough, and arrived at New haven before two Oclock; We had time to Walk through several parts of the City before Dinner. By taking the lower Road, we missed a Committee of the assembly, who had been appointed to wait upon, and escort me into town—to prepare an Address and to conduct me when I should leave the City as far as they should judge proper. The address was presented at 7 Oclock and at Nine I received another address from the Congregational Clergy of the place. Between the rect. of the two Addresses I received the Compliment of a Visit from the Govr. Mr. Huntington —the Lieutt. Govr. Mr. Wolcot  and the Mayor Mr. Roger Shurman. The City of Newhaven occupies a good deal of ground, but is thinly, though regularly laid out, &amp; built. The number of Souls in it are said to be about 4000. There is an Episcopal Church and 3 Congregational Meeting Houses and a College in which there are at this time about 120 Students under auspices of Doctr. Styles. The Harbour of this place is not good for large Vessels—abt. 16 belongs to it. The Linnen Manufacture does not appear to be of so much importance as I had been led to believe—In a word I could hear but little of it. The Exports from this City are much the same as from Fairfield &amp;ca. and flax seed (chiefly to New York). The Road from Kings bridge to this place runs as near the Sound as the Bays and Inlets will allow, but from hence to Hartford it leaves the Sound and runs more to the Northward.

Monday 19th. Left New haven at 6 oclock, and arrived at Wallingford (13 Miles) by half after 8 oclock, where we breakfasted and took a walk through the Town. In coming to it we passed thro East haven about mid way; after riding along the river of that name 6 Miles on which are extensive Marshes Now loaded with hay stacks—the ride is very pleasant, but the Road is Sandy which it continues to be within a Mile of the Tavern (Carringtons which is but an ordinary house) at Wallingford. This and about five Miles of the Road beyond—that is West of New haven—is all the Sand we have met with on the journey. These Sandy Lands afford but ordinary Crops of Corn—nor has the Crops of this grain East of Stratford River appeared so heavy as on the West side of it. The Lands (Stone being less) are in part enclosed with Posts &amp; Rails. At this place (Wallingford) we see the white Mulberry growing, raised from the Seed to feed the Silk worm. We also saw samples of lustring (exceeding good) which had been manufactured from the Cocoon raised in this Town, and silk thread very fine. This, except the weaving, is the work of private families without interference with other business, and is likely to turn out a benificial amusement. In the Township of Mansfield they are further advanced in this business. Walling ford has a Church &amp; two meeting houses in it, which stands upon high and pleasant grd. About 10 Oclock we left this place and at the distance of 8 Miles passed through Durham. At one we arrived at Middletown on Connecticut River being met two or three Miles from it by the respectable Citizens of the place, and escorted in by them. While dinner was getting ready I took a walk round the Town, from the heights of which the prospect is beautiful. Belonging to this place I was informed (by a Genl. Sage)  that there was about 20 Sea Vessels and to Weathersfield higher up 22 and to Hartford the like number. Other places on the River have their proportion, the whole amounting to about 10,000 Tonns. The Country hereabouts is beautiful and the Lands good. An average Crop of wheat from an Acre of fallowed Land is estimated at 15 bushels; sometimes  
  
they get as high as 25 and 30 bushls. to the Acre from their best lands—Indian Corn from 20 to 40 bushls. pr. Acre. Their exports are the same as from other places; together with Pot ash. Having dined, we set out with the same Escort (who conducted us into town) about 3 Oclock for Hartford, and passing through a Parish of Middletown &amp; Weathersfield, we arrived at Harfd. about Sun down. At Weathersfield we were met by a party of the Hartford light horse, and a Number of Gentlemen from the same place with Colo. Wadsworth  at their head, and escorted to Bulls Tavern where we lodged.

Tuesday 20th. After breakfast, accompanied by Colo. Wadsworth, Mr. Ellsworth  and Colo. Jesse Root, I viewed the Woolen Manufactury at this place which seems to be going on with Spirit. There Broadcloths are not of the first quality, as yet, but they are good; as are their Coatings, Cassimers, Serges and everlastings. Of the first that is broad-cloth I ordered a suit to be sent to me at New York and of the latter a whole piece to make breeches for my servants. All the parts of this business are performed at the Manufactury except the Spinning—this is done by the Country people who are paid by the cut.

Wednesday 21st. By promise I was to have Breakfasted at Mr. Ellsworths at Windsor on my way to Springfield, but the Morning proving very wet and the rain not ceasing till past 10 Oclock I did not set out till half after that hour; I called however on Mr. Ellsworth and stay’d there near an hour. Reached Springfield by 4 Oclock, and while dinner was getting, examined the Continental Stores at this place which I found in very good order at the buildings (on the hill above the Town) which belong to the United States. The Barracks (also public property) are going fast to destruction and in a little time will be no more without repairs. The Elaboratory, wch. seems to be a good building is in tolerable good repair and the Powder Magazine which is of Brick seems to be in excellent order and the Powder in it very dry. A Colo. Worthington, Colo. Williams (Adjutant General of the State of Massachusetts), Genl.

tate of Connecticut. There is a great equality in the People of this State—Few or no oppulent Men and no poor—great similatude in their buildings—the general fashion of which is a Chimney (always of Stone or Brick) and door in the middle, with a stair case fronting the latter, running up by the side of the latter [former]—two flush Stories with a very good shew of Sash &amp; glass Windows. The size generally is from 30 to 50 feet in length and from 20 to 30 in width exclusive of a back shed which seems to be  
  
added as the family encreases. The farms by the contiguity of the Houses are small not averaging more than 100 Acres. These are worked chiefly by Oxen (which have no other feed than Hay) with a horse &amp; sometimes two before them both in Plow &amp; Cart. In their light Lands and in their sleighs they work Horses, but find them much more expensive than Oxen.

Thursday 22d. Set out at 7 Oclock; and for the first 8 Miles rid over an almost uninhabited Pine plain; much mixed with Sand. Then a little before the road descends to Chicabi River it is hilly, Rocky &amp; Steep, &amp; continues so for several Miles; the Country being Stony and Barren; with a mixture of Pine and Oak till we came to Palmer, at the House of one Scott where we breakfasted, and where the Land though far from good, began to mend, to this is called 15 Miles. Among these Pines are Ponds of fresh Water. From Palmer to Brookfield, to one Hitchcocks;  is 15 Miles; part of which is pretty good, and part (crossing the Hills) very bad; but when over, the ground begins to get tolerably good and the Country better cultivated tho’ the Crops of Corn do not look well and have been injured it is said by an early frost in September. A beautiful fresh water pond &amp; large, is in the Plain of Brookland [Brookfield]. The fashion of the Houses are more deversified than  
  
in Connecticut, though many are built in their stile. The Inclosures have but indifferent fences—wood or Stone according as the Country abounds with the latter—of which it is full after passing the pine levels. At Brookland [Brookfield] we fed the Horses and dispatched an Express which was sent to me by Govr. Hancock—giving notice of the measures he was about to pursue for my reception on the Road, and in Boston—With a request to lodge at his House. Continued on to Spencer 10 Miles further through pretty good roads, and lodged at the House of one Jenks who keeps a pretty good Tavern.

Saturday 24th. Dressed by Seven Oclock, and set out at eight. At ten we arrived in Cambridge According to appointment; but most of the Militia having a distance to come were not in line till after eleven; they made however an excellent appearance with Genl. Brook at their Head. At this place the Lieutt. Govr. Mr. Saml. Adams, with the Executive Council met me and preceeded my entrance into town—which was in every degree flattering &amp;  
  
honorable. To pass over the Minutiae of the arrangement for this purpose it may suffice to say that at the entrance I was welcomed by the Select men in a body, Then following the Lieutt. Govr. &amp; Council in the order we came from Cambridge (preceeded by the Town Corps very handsomely dressed) we passed through the Citizens classed in their different professions, and under their own banners, till we came to the State House; from which, across the Street, an Arch was thrown; in the front of which was this Inscription—“To the Man who unites all hearts” and on the other—“To Columbia’s favourite Son” and on one side thereof next the State House, in a pannel decorated with a trophy, composed of the arms of the United States—of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts—and our French Allies, crowned with a wreath of Laurel was this Inscription—“Boston relieved March 17th. 1776.” This arch was handsomely ornamented, and over the Center of it a Canopy was erected 20 feet high with the American Eagle perched on the top. After passing through the Arch, and entering the State House at the So. End &amp; [as]cending to the upper floor &amp; returning to a Balcony at the No. end—three  
  
  
cheers was given by a vast concourse of people who by this time had assembled at the Arch. Then followed an ode composed in honor of the President; and well sung by a band of select Singers—after this three Cheers—followed by the different Professions, and Mechanics in the order they were drawn up with their Colours through a lane of the People which had thronged abt. the Arch under which they passed. The Streets, the Doors, Windows &amp; Tops of the Houses were crouded with well dressed Ladies and Gentlemen. The procession being over I was conducted to my lodgings at a Widow Ingersolls (which is a very decent &amp; good house) by the Lieutt. Govr. and Council—accompanied by the Vice-President where they took leave of me. Having engaged yesterday to take an informal dinner with the Govr. to day (but under a full persuation that he would have waited upon me so soon as I should have arrived) I excused myself upon his not doing it, and informing me thro his Secretary that he was too much indisposed to do it, being resolved to receive the visit. Dined at my Lodgings, where the Vice-President favoured me with his Company.

Between the two I received a visit from the Govr., who assured me that Indisposition alone had prevented his doing it yesterday, and that he was still indisposed; but as it had been suggested that the expected to receive the visit from the President, which he knew was improper, he was resolved at all hazds. to pay his Compliments to day. The Lt. Govr. &amp; two of the Council to wit Heath &amp; Russel were sent here last Night to express the Govrs. Concern that he had not been in a condition to call upon me so soon as I came to Town. I informed them in explicit terms that I should not see the Govr. unless it was at my own lodgings.

Wednesday 28th. Went after an early breakfast to visit the duck Manufacture which appeared to be carrying on with spirit, and is in a prosperous way. They have manufactured 32 pieces of Duck of 39 or 40 yds. each in a week; and expect in a short time to encrease it to . They have 28 looms at work &amp; 14 Girls spinning with Both hands (the flax being fastened to their waste). Children (girls) turn the wheels for them, and with this assistance each spinner can turn out 14 lbs. of thread pr. day when they stick to it, but as they are pd. by the piece, or work they do, there is no other restraint upon them but to come at 8 Oclock in the Morning and return at 6 in the evening. They are the daughters of decayed families, and are girls of Character—none others are admitted. The number of hands now employed in the different parts of the work is  but the Managers expect to encrease them to . This is a work of public utility &amp; private advantage. From hence I went to the Card Manufactury where I was informed about 900 hands of one kind and for one purpose or another. All kinds of Cards are made; &amp; there are Machines for  
  
executing every part of the work in a new and expeditious manr. especially in cutting &amp; bending the teeth wch. is done at one stroke. They have made 63,000 pr. of Cards in a year and can under sell the Imported Cards—nay Cards of this Manufactury have been smuggled into England. At 11 Oclock I embarked on board the Barge of the Illustrious Captn. Pentheve Gion, &amp; visited his Ship &amp; the Superb, another 74 Gun Ship in the Harbour of Boston, about 4 Miles below the Town. Going &amp; coming I was saluted by the two frigates which lye near the Wharves and by the 74s after I had been on board of them; as also by the 40 Gun ship which lay in the same range with them. I was also saluted going &amp; coming by the fort on Castle Isld. After my return I dined in a large Company at Mr. Bowdoins and went to the Assembly in the evening where (it is said) there were upwards of 100 Ladies. There appearance was elegant and many of them very handsome; the Room is small but neat, &amp; well ornamented.

At the Bridge, 2 Miles from this Town, we were also met by a Committee—who conducted us by a Brigade of the Militia, &amp; one or two handsome Corps in Uniform, through several of the Streets to the Town or Court House—where an Ode in honor of the President was sung—an address presented to him amidst the acclamations of the People—after which he was conducted to his Lodgings—recd. the compliments of many differt. Classes of People —and in the evening between 7 and 8 Oclock went to an assembly, where there was at least an hundred handsome and well dressed Ladies. Abt. Nine I returned to my Lodgings. The Road from Boston to this place is here and there Stoney tho’ level; it is very pleasant: from most parts you are in sight of the Sea. Meads—arable Land and Rocky hills are much intermixed—the latter chiefly on the left. The Country seems to be in a manner entirely stripped of wood. The grazing is good—the Houses stand thick. After leaving Cambridge at the distance of 4 Miles we passed through Mistick—then Malden—next Lynn (where it is said 175,000 pairs of Shoes (womens chiefly) have been made in a year by abt. 400 workmen). This is only a row of houses &amp; not very thick on each side of the Road. After passing Lynn you enter Marblehead wch. is 4 Miles from Salem. This latter is a neat Town and said to contain 8 or 9000 Inhabitants. Its exports are chiefly Fish Lumber &amp; Provisions.

Friday 30th. A Little after 8 Oclock I set out for Newbury-Port and in less than 2 Miles crossed the Bridge between Salem and Beverly, which makes a handsome appearance, and is upon the same plan of those over Charles &amp; Mistick Rivers; excepting that it has not foot ways as that of the former has. The length of this bridge is 1530 feet and was built for about £4500 lawful money—a price inconceivably low in my estimation, as there is 18 feet water in the deepest parts of the River over which it is erected. This Bridge is longer than that at Charles town, but shorter by  feet than the other over Mistick. All of them have draw bridges by which Vessels pass. After passing Beverley 2 Miles we come to the Cotton Manufactury which seems to be carrying on with Spirit by the Mr. Cabbots (principally). In this Manufactury they have the New Invented Carding and Spinning Machines—one of the first supplies the work; and four of the latter; one of which spins 84 threads at a time by one person. The Cotton is  
  
prepared for these Machines by being first (lightly) drawn to a thrd. on the common wheel. There is also another Machine for doubling and twisting the threads for particular cloths. This also does many at a time. For winding the Cotton from the spindles, &amp; preparing it for the Warp, there is a Reel which expedites the work greatly. A number of Looms (15 or 16) were at work with Spring shuttles which do more than dble. work. In short the whole seemed perfect, and the Cotton stuffs wch. they turn out excellent of their kind. Warp &amp; filling both are now of Cotton. From this place with escorts of Horse I passed on to Ipswich about 10 Miles—at the entrance of which I was met and welcomed by the Select Men and received by a Regemt. of Militia. At this place I w

Saturday 31st. Left Newbury-port a little after 8 Oclock (first breakfasting with Mr. Dalton)  and to avoid a wider ferry—more inconvenient boats—and a piece of heavy Sand, we crossed the River at Salisbury two Miles above; and near that further about—and in three Miles came to the Line wch. divides the State of Massachusetts from that of New Hampshire. Here I took leave of Mr. Dalton and many other private Gentlemen who accompanied me—also of Genl. Titcomb who had met me on the line between Middlesex &amp; Essex Counties—Corps of light Horse and Many officers of Militia—And was recd. by the President of the State of  
  
New Hampshire—the Vice-President; some of the Council—Messrs. Langdon &amp; Wingate of the Senate—Colo.

With this Cavalcade we proceeded and arrived before 3 Oclock at Portsmouth, where we were received with every token of respect and appearance of Cordiallity under a discharge of Artillery. The Streets—doors and windows were Crouded here, as at all the other Places—and, alighting at the Town House, odes were Sung &amp; played in honor of the President. The same happened yesterday at my entrance into New-bury-port—Being stopped at my entrance to hear it. From the Town House I went to Colonel Brewsters Ta[ver]n  the place provided for my residence and asked the President, Vice-President, the two Senators, the Marshall and Majr.

Tursday, 15th. Commenced my Journey about?  
o&#x27;clock for Boston and a tour through the Eastern  
States.  
The Chief Justice, Mr. Jay,-and the Secretaries of  
the Treasury and War Departments accompanied me  
some distance out of the city. Ahout 10 o&#x27;ciock it be­  
gan to Rain, and continned to do so until I1, when we  
arrived at the house of one Hoyat, who keeps a Tay-­  
ern at Kings-bridge, where we, that is, Major Jack-­  
son, Mr. Lear and myself, with six servants, which  
composed my Retinue, dined. After dinner, through  
frequent light showers, we proceedd to the Tavern of  
a Mrs. Haviland at Rye; who keeps a very neat and  
decent inn.  
The Rond for the greater part, indeed the whole  
way, was very rough and stoney, but the Land strong,  
well covered with graes and a luxuriant crop of Indian  
Corn intermixed with Pompions (which were yet un,  
gathered) in the fields. We met four droves of Beef  
Cattle for the New York Market, tabout 30 in a drove)  
some of which were very fine--also a flock of Sheep  
for the same place. We scarcely pasced a farm house­  
that did not abd, in Geese.  
Their Cattle seem to be of a good quality, and their  
hogs large, but rather long legged. No dwelling houre  
is seen without a Stone or Brick Chimney, and rarely  
any without a shingled roof--gencrully the sides are of  
shingles also.  
The distance of this day&#x27;s travel was 31 miles, in  
which we passed through lafter leaving the Bridgel  
East Chester, New-lochelle, ard Mamareneck; but as­  
these places (though they have houses of worship in  
them) are not regularly laid out, they are searcely to  
be distingnished from the intermediate farms, which  
ery close together-, and separated, as one Ine  
closure from another also is, by fences of stone, which  
are indeed ensily mnade, as the country is immensely  
stoney. Upon inquiry we find their crops of Whe  
and hye have been abundant--though of the first they  
had sown rather sparingly on acct of the destruction  
wh ch had of late years been made of that grain by  
called the Hessian fly,  
Fidey lo. About f o&#x27;tlock we left the Widow  
Haviland&#x27;s, and after passing Horse Neck, six I  
distant from eye, the read through which is hilly and  
immensely stoncy, and trying to wheels and caril  
we breakiasted at Stamford, which is six miles further,  
at one Webbsp) a tolerabde good houre, but net equal  
in appearance or reality to Mrs. Haviland&#x27;a. In this  
Town are an an Episcopal Church, and a me  
house. At Norwalk, which is ten miles further, we  
made a halt to feed our Horses. To the lower end of  
this town Sea Vessels come, and at the other end are  
Mills. Storer, and an Episcopal and Her­  
Church.  
From hence to Fairfield, where we dined and lodged,  
is Bmiles; and part of it very rough Road, but not  
equal to that thro Horse Neck. The surerb Land­  
seape, however, which is to be seen from the mecting  
house of the latter is a rich regalia. We found all the  
Farmers busily employed in gathering, grinding, and  
expressing the duice of their apples; the crop of which  
they say is rather above mediocrity. The average  
crop of Wheat they add, is about 15 ht  
acre from their fallow land--often 20, and from that to  
35. The Destructive evidences of British cruel  
yet visible both in Norwalk and Fairfield; as there are­  
the chimneys of many burnt hource standing in them  
yet. The principal export from Norwalk and Fair­  
field is Horses and Cattle--salted Beef and Pork-Lums  
ber and Indian Corn, to the Welt Indies, and in a small  
degree Wheat and Flour

had already been undertaken in the manu-  
facture of silk, of which the President  
thought favorably. He says, “ We aiso saw  
samples of lustring, (exceeding good) which  
had been manufactured from the Cocoon  
raised in this Town, and silk thread very  
fine ;” and he adds, “In the Township of  
Mansfield, they are further advanced in this  
business.”  
  
At Hartford, on the 20th, he went to view  
the “ Woollen Manufactory,” which he says,  
“ seems to be going on with spirit. Their  
Broadcloths are not of the first quality, as  
yet, but they are good; as are their Coat-  
ings, Cassimeres, Serges, and Everlastings ;  
of the first, that is, broad-cloth, I ordered a  
suit to be sent to me at New York—and of  
the latter a whole piece, to make breeches  
for my servants. All the parts of this  
business are performed at the Manufactory  
except the spinning—this is done by the  
country people, who are paid by the cut.”  
  
He computes the number of inhabitants  
of Middletown at about 2,000 souls, and of  
Hartford, abuut double that number.

with sand. Then a little before the road  
d ds to Chicopee River it is hilly, rocky  
and steep, and continues so for several  
miles; the Country being stony and barren ;  
with a mixture of Pine and Oak till we  
came to Palmer, at the house of one Scott,  
where we breakfasted ; and where the land,  
though far from good, began to mend ; to  
this it is called 15 miles—among these  
Pines, are Ponds of fresh water.  
  
“From Palmer to Brookfield, to one  
Hitchcock&#x27;s, is 15 miles; part of which is  
pretty good, and part (crossing the hills)  
very bad; but when over, the ground  
begins to get tolerably good and the Country  
better cultivated, tho’ tie crops of corn do  
not look well and have been injursd, it is  
said, by an early frost in September. A  
beautiful fresh water pond ana large, is in  
the plain of Brookland. (Brookfield?) The  
fashion of the houses are more diversified  
than in Connecticut, though many are built  
in their style.  
  
  
  
“ At Brookland (Brookfield ?) we fed the  
horsee and dispatched an Express which was  
sent to me by Govr. Hancock—giving notice  
of the measures he was about to pursue for  
my reception on the road, and in Boston—  
with a request to lodge at his house.  
“Continued on to Spencer, 10 miles  
further, through pretty good roads, and  
lodged at the house of one Jenks, who keeps  
a pretty good Tavern.

port. The bridge between Salem and Bev-  
  
over Charles and Mistick Rivers; except-  
ing that it has not foot ways as that of the  
former has. The length of this Bridge is  
1530 feet, and was built for about $4500,  
lawful money—a price inconceivably low in  
my estimation, as there is 18 feet water in  
the deepest part of the River over which it  
is erected.”  
  
Two miles after passing Beverly the Pres-  
ident stopped to inspect the. Messrs. Cab-  
bot’s cotton manufactory, in which “ they  
have the new invented Carding and Spin-  
ning Machines. One of the first supplies  
  
waich spins 84 threads at a time by one  
erson. ‘Ihe Cotton is prepared for these  
owe by being first (lightly) drawn to a  
thread, on the common wheel; there is also  
another machine for doubling and twisting  
the threads for particular cloths; this also  
does many ata time. For winding the Cot-  
ton from the Spindles, and preparing it for  
the warp, there isa Keel which expedites  
the work greatly. A number of Looms (15  
or 16) were at work with Spring shuttles,  
which do mere than d’ble work. In short,  
the whole seemed perfect, and the Cotton  
stuffs which they turn out, excellent of their  
kind ; warp and filling both are now of  
Cotton.

made, as the country is immensely stony. Upon enquiry we find their crops of wheat and  
rye have been abundant—though of the first they had sown rather sparingly, on account  
of the destruction which nad of late years been made of that grain by what is called the  
Hessian fly.  
  
Friday, October 16. About 7 o&#x27;clock we left the Widow Haviland’s, and after passing  
  
Horse Neck, six miles distant from Rye, the road through which is hilly and immensely  
stony, and trying to wheels and carriages, we breakfasted at Stamford, which is six  
miles further (at one Webb’s), a tolerably good house, but not equal in appearance or  
reality to Mrs. Haviland’s. In this town are an Episcopal church and a meeting house.  
At Norwalk, which is ten miles further, we made a halt to feed our horses. To the lower  
end of this town sea vessels come, and at the other end are mills, stores, and an Episcopal  
and Presbyterian church. From hence to Fairfield, where we dined and lodged, is 12  
miles ; and part of it a very rough road, but not equal to that thro’ Horse Neck.  
We found all the farmers busily employed in gathering, grinding, and pressing the juice  
of their apples ; the crop of which they say is rather above mediocrity. . . . The  
destructive evidences of British cruelty are yet visible both in Norwalk and Fairfield ; as  
there are the chimneys of many burnt houses standing in them yet. The principal export  
from Norwalk and Fairfield is horses and cattle—salted beef and pork—lumber and Indian  
corn, to the West Indies, and in a small degree wheat and flour.

which is near a mile from the center of the  
town by several gentlemen on horseback.  
Doctor Johnson of tlie Senate [William  
Samuel Johnson, L.L. D., President of  
Columbia College] visited we here, be­

where he formerly resided. * *  
From the ferry it is almost three miles  
to Milford, which is situated in  
more uneven and stony ground than the  
last tUree villages through which we  
passed. In this place there is but one  
church, or in other words but one steeple—  
but there are fcrist and saw mills, and a  
cascade over the tumbling dam. * * *  
From Milford we took the lower road  
through West Haven, part of which was  
good and part rough, and arrived at New-  
Haven before 2 o&#x27;clock; we had time to  
walk through several parts of the city be­

&quot;By taking the lower road we missed a  
committee of the Assembly, who had been  
appointed to wait upon and escort me into  
the town, to prepare an address, and to  
conduct me when 1 should leave the city

address was presented at 7 o&#x27;clock, and at

the threads for particular cloths; this also does  
many at a time. For winding the cotton from  
the spindles and preparing it for the warp, there

tn DAIRY FROM OCX. 1&amp;, 1789, THt K3DAT,  
lath.  
Commenced my Journey about 9 o&#x27;clock  
  
for Poston and a tour through the eastern  
states.  
The chief Justice. Mr. Jay. and the Sec­  
retaries of the Treasury and War Depart­  
ments, accompanied me some distance  
out of the city! About 10 o&#x27;clock it began  
to rain and continued to do so till 11,  
when we arrived at the house of one  
Hoyatt, who keeps a tavern at King&#x27;s  
Bridge, where we. that is. Maj. Jackson,  
Mr. and Myself, with six servants,  
which composed my Retinue, dined. Af­  
ter dinner, through frequent light show­  
ers. we proceeded to the Tavern of a Mrs.  
Haviland, at Kye; who keeps a very neat  
and decent inn.  
The road for the greater part, indeed,  
for the whole way, was very rough ana  
stoney, but the land strong, well covered  
with grass and a luxuriant crop of Indian  
corn intermixed with Pornpions. [which  
were yet ungathered] in the fields. We  
met four droves of beef cattle, for the  
New York market [about thirty in a  
drove] some of which were very fine—  
also, a flock of sheep for the same place.  
Wc. scarcely passed a farm house that  
did not abd. in geese.  
The cattle seemed to be of a good qual­  
ity, and their hogs large, but rather long­  
legged. No dwelling house is seen with­  
out a stone or brick chimney, and rarely  
any without a shingled roof—generally  
the sides are of shingles also.  
’The distance of Ibis day s travel was  
31 miles, in which wo passed through  
(after leaving the bridge). East Chester,  
New Rochelle and Mamaroneck; but as  
these places (though they have houses of  
worship in them) are not regularly laid  
out, they are scarcely to be distinguished  
from the intermediate farms, which are  
very close together—and separated as one  
inclosure is from another, by fences of  
stone, which are indeed easily made, as  
the country is immensely stony. Upon  
inquiry we find their crops of wheat and  
rye have been abundant—though of the  
first they had sown rather sparingly on  
account of the destruction which had of  
late years been made of that grain by  
what is called the Hessian tty.  
FRIDAY, lfiTH.  
At 7 o&#x27;clock wo left the Widow Havi­  
land&#x27;s, and after passing Horse Neck, six  
miles distant from Rye. the road through  
which is hilly and immensely stonev, and  
trying to wheels and carriages, we break­  
lasted at Stamford, which is six miles  
further (at one Webb&#x27;s), a tolerable good  
house, but not equal in appearance or re­  
ulity to Mrs. Ha\iland&#x27;s. In this town  
are an Episcopal church and a meeting  
house. At Norwalk, which is ten miles  
further, we made a halt to feed our horses.  
To the lower eud of this town sea vessels  
come, and at the other end are mills,  
stores, and an Episcopal and Presbyterian  
church.  
r rom hence to Fairfield, where we  
dined and lodged, is twelve miles, and  
part of it very rough road, but not equal  
to that thro’ Horse Neck. The superb  
landscape, however, which is to be seen  
from the meeting house of the latter, is a  
rich regalia. We fouud all the farmers  
busily engaged in gathering, grinding and  
extracting the juice of their apples, the  
crop of which they say, is rather above  
mediocrity. The average crop of wheat,  
they add. is about fifteen bushels to the  
acre from their faliow land—often twenty  
and from that to twenty-five. The  
destructive evidences of British cruelty  
are yet visible in Norwalk ami at Fair­  
field. The chimneys of many burnt  
houses stand in them yet. The principal  
exports from Norwalk and Fairfield is  
horses and cattle—salted beef and pork­  
lumber and Indian corn, to the West In­  
dies, and, in a small degree, wheat and  
flour

WEDNESDAY 21ST.  
There is great equality in the people of  
this state Few or no opulent men—and  
no poor—great similitude in the buildings  
—the general fashion of which is a Chim­  
ney [axwa.vs of Stone or Brick [ and door  
in the middle, with a staircase fronting  
the latter, running up by the side of the  
latter—two Hush stories with a very good  
show of sash and glass windows—the  
size generally is from 20 to 30 in witdth,  
exclusive of a back shed, which seems to  
bo added as the family increases.  
Tin: farms, by the contiguity of JJie  
Houses, are small, uot averaging more  
than 100 acres. These are worked  
chiefly by oxen [which have no other feed  
than hay] with a horse, and sometimes  
two. before them, both in Plow and Cart.  
In their light Lands, and in their sleighs,  
they work their Horses, but find them  
much more expensive then oxeu. * *

SATURDAY, 24TH.  
Dressed bp Seven o’clock and set out at  
eight—at ten we arrived at Cambridge,  
according to appointment; but most of  
the Militia, .having a distance to come,  
wero not in lino till eleven; they made,  
however, an excellent appearance, with  
Gen. Brooks at their Head. * * * *.  
I was welcomed by the selectmen in a  
body. Then, following the Lieut. Gov  
and Council in the order we came from  
Cambridge, [preceded by the Town  
Corps, very handsomely dressedj Wo  
passed through the Citizens, classed in  
their different professions, and under  
their own banners, until we same to tho  
State House; from which, across the  
Street, an Arch was Thrown; in front of  
which was this inscription—&quot;To the Man  
who unites all hearts”—and. on th s other  
side, “io Columbia&#x27;s favorite Son”—  
and on the other side thereof, next to  
the state House, in a panel decorated  
with a tropy, composed of the Arms of  
the United States—of the Commonwealth  
of Massachusetts—and our French Allies,  
crowned with a wreath of Laurel, was  
this inscription -&quot;Boston, Relieved May  
17th, 17Tfi.” This Arch was handsomely  
ornamented, and over the center of it a  
Canopy was erected 2d feet high, with  
tho American Eagle perched on the top.  
After passing through the Arch, and en­  
turing the State House at the So. End,  
and ascending to the Upper Floor and re­  
lenting to a Balcony a the No. End,  
three cheers were giveu by a vast con­  
course of people, who by-this time had  
assembled at the Arch—then followed  
an ode composed in honor of the Pres­  
ident. and well sung b.v a band of select  
singers—after this, threo cheers—fol­  
lowed by the dilterent Professions and  
Mechanics, in tho order they wero­  
drawn up with their colours through a  
lane of the people, which had thronged  
abt, the Aren, under which they passed.  
The Streets, the Door3, windows and tops  
of the Houses were crowded with well  
dressed Ladies and Gentlemen. The Pro­  
cession being over, I was conducted to my  
lodgings at a Widow Ingersoll&#x27;s (which is  
a very decent and good house) by tho  
Lieut Govr. atul Council—accompanied  
by the Vice-President, where they took  
leave of me. Having engaged yesterday  
to take an informal dinner with the Govr.  
to-day, but under a full pursuasion that  
he would have waited upon me so soon as  
1 should have arrived—l excused myself  
upon his not doing it, and informing me  
thro&#x27; his So-rotary that ho was too much  
iudisi osed to do it, being resolved to re­  
ceive the visit. Dined at my lodgings,  
where tho Vice-President favored me  
with his Company.

THE DIARY FROM OCTOBER, 1789.  
Thursday, 15: Commenced my jour-  
ney about 9 o’clock for Boston and a  
tour through the Eastern States. -  
The Chief Justice; Mr. Jay, and the  
Secretaries of the: Treasury and War  
Departments accompanied me some dis-  
tance out of the city. About 10 o’clock  
it began to rain, and continued to do  
so till 11, when we arrived at the house  
of one Hoyatt, who keeps a tavern at  
King’s Bridge, where we, that is, Maj.  
Jackson, Mr. Lear and Myself, with six  
Servants which composed my Retinue,  
dined. After dinner, through frequent  
light showers, we proceeded to the Tav-  
ern of a Mrs. Haviland, at Rye, whd  
keeps a very neat and decent inn.  
The road, for the greater part, indeed.  
for the whole way, was very rough  
and stony, but the land strong, well  
covered with grass and a luxuriant crop  
of Indian corn, intermitted with Pom-  
pions (which were yet ungathered) in  
the flelds..We met four droves of Beef  
Cattle, for the New York Market (about  
thirty*in a drove) some of which were  
very fine—ailso, a flock of sheep for the  
same place. We scarcely passed a farm  
house that did not abound in Geese. _  
  
ity, and their hogs large, but rather  
long-legged. No dwelling-house is seen  
without a Stone or Brick Chimney, and  
rarely any .without a shingled roof—  
senemily the sides are of shingles ailso.  
The distance of this day’s travel was  
thirty-one miles, in which we passed  
through (after leaving the bridge) East  
Chester, New Rochelle and Mamaro-  
neck; but as these places (though they  
have houses of worship in them) are  
not regularly laid out, they are scarcely  
to be dtstinguished from the interme-  
diate farms, which are very close to-  
gether—and separated as one inclosure  
is from another by fences of stone,  
which are, indeed, easily made, as the  
country is immensely stony. @Jpon in-  
quiry we find their crops of wheat and  
rye have ‘been abundant—though of the  
first they had sown rather sparingly  
on account of the destruction which had  
of late years been made of that grain  
by what is called the Hessian fly.  
Friday, 16th: At 7 o’clock we left the  
Widow Haviland’s, and, after passing  
Horse Neck, six miles from Rye, the  
road through which is hilly and im-  
  
/mensely stony and trying to wheels and  
  
carriages, we breakfast at Stamf  
which is six miles fubther (at po  
Webb’s,) a tolerable good house, but not  
equal in appearance or reality to Mrs.  
Haviland’s. In this town are an Epis-  
copal church and a meeting-house.. At  
Norwalk, which is ten miles further,  
we made a halt to feed our horses. To  
the lower end of this town vessels come  
and at the other end are mills, stores,  
and an Episcopal and Presbyterian  
rom hence to Fairfield, where w  
dined and lodged, is twelve miles, ian  
part of it a very rough road, but not

superb landscape, however, which is to  
be seen from the meeting-house of the

the farmers busily engaged in gather-

of their apples, the crop of which, they  
Say, is rather above mediocrity. The  
average crop of wheat, they add, is  
about fifteen bushels to the acre from  
their fallow land—often twenty, and  
from that to twenty-five. The destruc.  
tive evidences of British Cruelty are  
yet visible in Norwalk and at Fairfield.  
The chimneys of many burnt houses  
stand in them yet. The principal export  
from Norwalk and Fairfield are horses  
and cattle, salted beef and pork, lu  
and Indian corn, to the West Indies,  
and in a small degree wheat ahd flour.  
Saturday, 17th: A little after sunrise  
we left Fairfield, and, passing through  
Et. Fairfield, breakfasted at Stratford,  
which is ten miles from Fairfield, and is a  
pretty village over near Stratford River.  
The road between these two places is  
on the bad (for this country,)  
Some places very ed., especial!  
through Et. Fairfield, wch. is in &amp; plein  
and free from stones.  
There are two decent-looking churches  
in this place, though small, viz: an  
Episcopal and Presbyterian, or Congre-  
gationalist (as they call themselves.)  
At Stratford there is the Same. At this  
point I was received with an effort of  
military parade, and was attended to  
the ferry, wch. is near a mile from the  
center of the Town, by svi. gentlemen  
on horseback. . . . The ferry is near  
half a mile, and sometimes much in-  
commoded by winds and cross tides.  
The navigation of vessels of about sev-  
  
‘enty-five tons extends up to Danby, ten  
  
miles higher, where it is said there is a  
pretty brisk trade, At Stratford they  
are establishing a manufactory of  
Duck, and have lately turned out’ about  
four hundred bolts. From the ferry it  
is about three miles to Milford, which is  
situated in more uneven and _ stomy |  
grd. than the last three villages through  
  
The Cattle seemed to be of €50d qual-  
  
|  
  
but one church, or, in other words, but  
one steeple—but there are Grist and  
Saw .mills, and a handsome Cascade  
over the Tumbling dam. But one of  
the prettiest things of this kind is at  
Stamford, occasioned also by damming  
the watcr for their mills; it is near one  
hundred yards in width, and, the water  
now being of proper height and the  
rays of the sun striking on it as we  
passed, had a pretty effect on the foam-  
ing water as it fell. From Milford we  
took the lower Road through West Ha-  
ven, part of which was good and part  
rough, and arrived at New Haven be-  
fore 2 o’clock. We had time to walk  
  
through several parts of the City before  
  
Dinner. By ta&#x27;:ing the lower Road we  
missed a Committee of the Assembly,  
who had been appointed to wait upon  
and escort me to the town—to prepare  
an address—and to conduct me, when I  
should leave the City, as far  
as they should judge proper. ...  
The City of New Haven occupies a  
food deal of ground, but is thinly  
though regularly laid out and built.  
The number of Souls in it is said to  
be about 4009. There is an Episcopal  
Church and three Congregation Meet-  
ing Houses and a College, in which  
there are at this time about 120 stu-  
dents under the auspices of Doctor  
Styles. The Harbor of this Place is  
good for large vessels—abt. 16 belong  
to it. The Linnen manufacture does  
not appear to be of so much importance  
as I had been led to believe. In a  
word I could hear but little of it. ...  
Monday, 19th: Left New Haven at  
6 o’clock and arrived at Willingford,  
13 miles, by half after 8 o’clock, where  
we breakfasted and took a walk  
through the Town. In coming to it we  
passed through East Haven about mid-  
  
Way; after riding along the  
river of that mame about  
miles, on which are extensive  
marshes loaded with  haystacks—  
  
the ride is very pleasant, but the  
Road is sandy, which it continues to  
be within a mile of the Tavern (Car-  
rington’s, which is but an ordinary  
house) at Willingford.:.This and about  
five miles of the Road beyond—that is  
West of New Haven—is all the sand  
we have met with on the journey.  
These sandy lands afford but ordinary  
Crops of Corn—nor have the Crops of  
this grain East of the Stratford River  
appeared as heavy as on the West  
side of it. The Land (Stone being less)  
are in part enclosed with Posts and  
Rails. At this place, Wallingford, we  
see the white Mulberry growing, raised  
from seed, to feed the silkworm. We  
also saw samples of lustering (exceed-  
ingly good) which had been been manu-  
factured from the Cocoon, raised in  
*his Town and silk thread very fine.  
This, except the weaving, is the work  
of private families, without interfer-  
ence with other business, and is likely  
to turn out beneficial. amusement. In  
the township of Mansfield they are  
further advanced in this business... .  
The country hereabouts is beautiful  
and the Lands good. An average Crop  
of Wheat from an acre of fallowcd  
land is estimated at 15 bushels; some-  
times they get as high as 25 and 30  
bushels to the acre from the best  
lands. Indian Corn, from 20 to 40  
bushels pr. § acre. Their exports  
are the same as from other places;  
together with Potash. ...  
Tuesday, 20th: After breakfast . .  
I viewed the Woolen mantfactory at  
this place, which seems to be going on  
with spirit. Their Broadcioths are not  
of the first quality, yet they are good:  
as are their Coatings, Cassimeres,  
Serges and EFverlastings; of the first,  
that is broad-cloth, I ordered a suit  
to be sent to me in Now York—end  
  
Meeting between Washinzton and Hincock.  
  
of the latter a whole piece to make  
breeches for my servants. All parts  
of this business are performed at Man-  
ufactory, except the spinning—this is  
done by the Country people, who are  
paid by the cut. ..

Wednesday, 2ist: There is great  
equality in the people of this~ State.  
Few or no opulent men—and no poor—  
great similitude in the buildings—the  
general fashion of which is a Chimney  
(always of Stone or Brick) and door in  
the middle, with a staircase fronting  
the latter running up by the side of  
the latter—two flush stories with a  
very good show of sash and glass win-  
dows—the size generally is from 29 to  
  
80 in width, exclusive of a back shed, &#x27;  
  
which seems to be added as the fam-  
ily increases.  
  
The farms, by the contiguity of the  
Houses, are small, not averaging more  
than 100 acres. These are worked  
chiefly by oxen (which have no other  
feed than hay) with a horse and some-  
times two, before them, both in Plow  
and Cart. In their light Lands, and  
in their sleighs, they work their  
Horses, but find them much more ex-  
pensive than oxen. ..

Saturday, 24th: Dressed by Seven  
o&#x27;clock, and set out at eight—at ten  
we arrived at Cambridge, according to  
appointment; ‘but most of the Militia,  
having a distance to come, were not  
in line till eleven; they made, however,  
an excellent appearance, with Genl.  
Brooks at their Head. . “ I was  
welcomed by the selectmen in a body.  
Then followed: the Lieut. Govr. ana  
Council in the order we came from  
Cambridge (preceded by the Town  
Corps, very handsomely dressed.) We  
passed through the Citizens, classed in  
their different professions, and under  
their own banners, until we came to  
the State House; from which, across  
the Street, an Arch was Throwr:;  
front of which was this inscription—  
“To the Man who unites all hearts’  
and, on the other side, “To Columbia&#x27;s  
favorite Son’’—and on the other side  
thereof, next to the State House, in a  
panel decorated with a trophy, com-  
posed of the Arms of the United States—  
of the Commonwealth of Massachu-  
setts—and our French Allies, crowned  
with a wreath of Laurel, was this in-  
scription—‘‘Boston, Relieved May 17th,  
1776.&quot; -This Arch was handsomely or-  
  
namented, and over the center of it  
  
‘  
  
a Canopy was erected 20 feet high, with  
the American Eagle perched on the top.  
After passing through the Arch, and  
entering the State House at the So. End,  
and ascending to the Upper Floor and  
returning to a Balcony of the No. End;  
three cheers were given by a vast con-  
course of people, who, by this time, had  
assembled at the Arch—then followed  
an ode, composed in honor of the Pres-  
ident; and well sung by a band of  
select singers—after this three cheers—  
followed by the different Professions  
and Mechanics, in the order they were  
drawn up with their colours through a  
lane of the People, which had thronged  
abt. the Arch, under which they passed.  
The Streets, the Doors, windows and  
tops of the Houses were crowded with  
well-dressed Ladies and Gentlemen. The  
Procession being over, I was conducted  
to my lodgings at a Widow Ingersoll’s  
(which is a very decent and good house)  
by the Lieut. Govr. and Council—ac-  
companied by the Vice-President, where  
they took leave of me. Having engaged  
yesterday to ‘take an informal dinner  
with the Govr. today, but under a full  
persuasion that he would have waited  
upon me as s00n as I should have ar-  
fived—I excused myself from his not  
doing it, and informing me thro’ his  
Secretary that he was too much indis-  
posed to do it, being resolved to receive  
the visit. Dined at my lodgings, where  
the Vice-President favored me with his  
Company.  
  
Sunday, 25th:. Between the two  
(visits to Church) I received a visit  
from the Governor, who assured me  
that indisposition alone prevented him  
from doing it before, and that he is  
  
suggested that he had expected to  
  
|  
  
In Ramage’s studio.  
  
receive the visit from the President,  
which he knew was improper, he was  
resolved at all haz’ds to pay his Com-  
pliments today. The Lieut. Govr. and  
two of his Council, to wit, Heath and  
Russell, were sent here last night to  
express the Gov’&#x27;r’s concern that he  
had not been in a condition to call  
upon me so .soon as i had come to  
Town. I informed them in explicit  
terms that I should’nut see the Govr.  
unless he came to my gings.  
Wednesday, 28th::. Went, after an  
eariy breakfast, to visit the duck man-  
ufacture, which anpears_to be carry-  
ing -on with spirit, and is in a pros-  
perous way. They have manufactured  
32 pieces of Duck, or °9 or 40 yards each  
in a week; and expect in a short time  
to increase it to —-—. They have 28  
iooms at work, and i4 giris spinning  
1 Goth hands (the flax is held be-  
  
i. ss turn the wheels for them; and  
with this assistance, each spinner can  
turn out 14 pounds of Thread per day  
when they stick io it, but as they are  
paid by the pieco:, or work they do,  
there is no other restraint upon them  
but to come at 6 in the morning and  
return at 6 in the evening. They are  
the Daughters of Decayed families and  
are Girls of Character—ncne others are  
admitted. The number of hands now  
employed in the different parts of the  
work is ——, but the Managers expect  
soon to increase them to —. This is  
a work of public utility and private ad-  
vantage. From hence I went to the  
card factory, where I was informed  
about 900 hands of one kind and for  
one purpose or another—all kinds of  
cards are made; and there are Ma.  
chines for executing every part of the  
work in a new and expeditious man’r,  
especially in bending and cutting the  
teeth, wch. is done at one stroke. They  
have made 63,000 pr. Cards in a year,  
and can undersell the imported Cards—  
nay, Cards of this Manufactory have  
been smuggled into England. .  
  
Went to the Assembly in the evening,  
where (it is said) there were upwards  
of.100 Ladies. Their appearance was  
elegant and many of them very handa-  
some; the room is small, but neat ana  
well ornamented. he

Thursday, 29th: . At the Bridge,  
2 miles from Town, we were also met  
by a Committee, who conducted us to  
a Brigade of Militia, and one or two  
handsome Corps in Uniform. ...  
After this the President was conducted  
to his Lodgints. Rec&#x27;d the Compli-

there were at least an hundred hand-

The Road from Boston to this place

good—the houses stand thick. After  
leaving Cambridge, at a distance of 4

o&#x27;clock and arrived ut Walllngfurd (13  
miles by half after H o&#x27;clock where he  
breakfasted, and took a walk through  
the town. In coming to it we pasaed  
thro East lluven about midway; after  
riding along the river of that name  
about six nillcH. on which are exten­  
sive marshes loaded with hay stacks  
the ride is very pleasant, but the road  
Is sandy, w hich It continues to be with­  
in a mile of the tavern (Carrlngton&#x27;s,  
which Is but an ordinary house,) at  
WullliiKford. This and about five  
miles of the road beyond that is west  
of New Haven la all the sand we have  
met with on the Journey. These sandy  
lands afford but ordinary crops of corn  
nor have the crops of this grain cast  
of Stratford river appeared as heavy as  
on the west side of It. The lands (stone  
being less) are In part enclosed with  
posts and rails. At this place (Wal­  
llngford) we see the white mulberry  
growing, raised from the seed, to feed  
the silkworm. We also saw samples of  
lustring (exceeding good) which had  
been manufactured from the cocoon  
raised In this town, and silk threads  
very fine. This, except the weaving. Is  
the work of private families, without  
Interference with other business, and Is  
likely to turn out a beneficial amuse­

they are further advanced In this busi­  
ness. Wallingford has a church and  
two meeting houses in it, which stand  
upon high and pleasant ground. About  
ten o&#x27;clock we left this place and at the  
distance of eight miles passed through  
Put ham. At one we arrived at Middle­  
town, on the Connecticut river, being  
met two or three miles from It by the  
respectable citizens of the place, and  
escorted in by them. While dinner was  
getting ready I took a walk around the

sea vessels, and to Wethersfield, hlgiier  
up, twenty-two ana 10 naruora me  
like ..umbel -other places on tne river  
have their proportion the wnole  
amounting to about ten thousand tons.  
The country hereabouts Is beautiful  
and the lands good. An average crop  
of wheat from an acre of fallowed  
land is estimated at fifteen bushels;  
sometimes they get as high as twenty-  
five and thirty bushels to the acre  
from the best lands. Indian corn from  
twenty to forty bushels per acre.  
Their exports are the same as from  
other places; together with potash.  
Having dined, we set out with the  
same escort (who conducted us Into  
town) about three o&#x27;clock for Hartford,  
and passing through a parish of Mid­  
dletown and Wethersfield, we arrived  
at Hartford about sundown. At Weth  
ersfield we were met by a party of the  
Hartford light horse, and a number of  
gentlemen from the same place with  
Colonel Wadsworth at their head and  
escorted to Bull&#x27;s tavern, where we  
lodged.

which was this Inscription—* To the Man who unites all  
hearts’—and on the other—* To Columbia’s favorite Son’—  
and on one side thereof next the State House, in a pannel  
decorated with a trophy, composed of the Arms of the  
United States—of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts—  
and our French Allies, crowned with a wreath of Laurel,  
was this Inscription—‘ Boston relieved March 17th. 1776.’  
This Arch was handsomely ornamented, and over the  
Center of it a Canopy was erected 20 feet high, with the  
American Eagle perched on the top. After passing through  
the Arch, and entering the State House at the 8° End and  
ascending to the upper floor and returning to a Balcony at  
the N° End; three cheers was given by a vast concourse of  
people who by this time had assembled at the Arch—then  
followed an ode composed in honor of the President; and  
well sung by a band of select singers—after this three  
Cheers—followed by the different Professions and Me-  
chanics in the order they were drawn up with their colours  
through a lane of the People, which had thronged abt. the  
Arch under which they passed. The Streets, the Doors,  
windows and tops of the Houses were crowded with well  
dressed Ladies and Gentlemen. The procession being over,  
I was conducted to my lodgings at a Widow Ingersoll’s,  
(which is a very decent and good house) by the Lieut. Govr.  
and Council—accompanied by the Vice President, where  
they took leave of me. Having engaged yesterday to take  
an informal dinner with the Govr. [John Hancock] to-day,  
but under a full persuasion that he would have waited upon  
me so soon as I should have arrived—I excused myself  
upon his not doing it, and informing me thro’ his Secretary  
that he was too much indisposed to do it, being resolved to  
receive the visit. Dined at my Lodgings, where the Vice-  
President favoured me with his Company.”— Washington’s

Washington’s tour from Boston through Essex County  
— as entered in his diary for Octol)er-November, 1789.  
  
Wednesday, 28th.  
  
Went, after an early breakfast, to visit the duck manufacture,  
which appeared to be carrying on witii spirit, and is in a prosperous  
w&#x27;ay. They have manufactured 32 pieces of Duck of 30 or 40 yds.  
  
each in a week; and expect in a short time to increase it to-.  
  
They have 28 looms at work, and 14 Girls spinning with Both hands,  
(the flax being fastened to their waste.) Children (girls) turn the  
wheels for them, and with this assistance each spinner can turn out  
14 lbs. of Thread pr. day when they stick to it, but as they are pd. by  
the piece, or work they do, there is no other restraint upon them  
but to come at 8 o’clock in the morning, and return at C in the even¬  
ing, They are the daughters of decayed families, and are girls of  
Character—none others are admitted. The number of hands now  
  
employed in the different parts of the work is-but the Managers  
  
exspect to increase them to-. This is a work of public utiiity  
  
and private advantage. From hence, I went to the Card Manufactory,  
where I was informed about 900 hands of one kind and for one  
purpose or another — all kinds of Cards are made; and there are  
Machines for executing every part of the work in a new and ex¬  
peditious man’r, especially in cutting and bending the teeth, wch is  
done at one stroke. They have made 63,000 pr. of Cards in a year  
and can underseil the imported Cards — nay. Cards of this Manufac-  
tury have been smuggled into England. At 11 o’clock I embarked on  
board the Barge of the “Illustrious,” Captn. Penthere Gion, and  
visited his Ship and the Superb, another 74 Gun Ship in the Harbour  
of Boston, about 4 miles below the Town. Going and coming I was  
saluted by the two frigates which lye near the wharves, and by the  
74 s after I had been on board of them; as also by the 40 Gun Ship  
which lay in the same range with them. I was aiso saluted going  
and coming by the fort on Castie Isld. After my return I dined in a  
large company at Mr. Bowdoiu’s, and ■went to the Assembly in the  
evening, where (it is said) there ■were upwards of 100 Ladies. Their  
appearance was elegant, and many of them very handsome; the  
Room is small but neat, and well ornamented.

rkation. * * * The visitors this even-  
ing to Mrs. Washington were respectable,  
both of gentlemen and ladies. Oct. 10.—Pur-  
suant to an engagement formed on Thurs-  
day last, I set off about 9 o’clock in my  
barge to visit Mr. Prince’s fruit gardens  
and shrubberies at Flushing, on Long Isl-  
and. The Vice President, Governor of the  
State, Mr. Izard, Col. Smith, and Major  
Jackson accompanied me. These gardens,  
except in the number of young fruit trees,  
did not answer my expectations. The  
shrubs were trifling, and the flowers not nu-  
merous, The inhabitants of this place  
showed me what respect they could, by  
making the best of one cannon to salute.  
On our return we stopped at the seats of Gen.  
and Mrs. Gouverneur Morris [Morrisania]  
and viewed a barn of which I have heard  
the latter speak much belonging to his farm  
—but it was not of a construction to strike  
my fancy—nor did the conveniences of it at  
all answer their cost. From hence we pro-  
ceeded to Harlaem, where we were met by  
Mrs, Washington, Mrs. Adanis, and Mrs.  
Smith. Dined at the tavern kept by a Capt.  
Mariner, and came home in the evening.  
Oct. 11.—At home all day—writing private  
letters.&quot;—Washington’s Diary.  
  
Perry&#x27;s garden was on the west side of  
the Bloomingdale Road, west of the present  
Union Square. Williamson’s was a flower  
and nursery garden, and a place of public  
resort, on the east side of Greenwich Street,  
extending about three squares up from Har-  
rison Street.
