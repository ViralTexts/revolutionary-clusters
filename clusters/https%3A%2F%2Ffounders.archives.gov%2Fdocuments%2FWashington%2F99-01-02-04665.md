Ringwood 27th Jany 1781  
  
In obedience to your Excellency’s commands I arrived at this place yesterday evening and found that the Mutineers were returning to their huts. Col. Dayton had offered them pardon for their offences provided they immediatly would put themselves under the  
Command of their officers and would behave in future consistent with that Subordination so essential to Military discipline. To this they Seemingly acceeded but Soon demonstrated by their Conduct that they were actuated by motives exceedingly distinct from those they had  
professed, for tho’ in Some respects they would Suffer a few particular officers to have influence over them, yet it was by no means the Case in general, and what they did do, appeared rather like following advice than obeying command. arrived

In short their whole behaviour was Such as cried aloud for chastisement and made it evident that they had only returned to their huts as a place more Convenient for themselves where they  
meant to negotiate with the Committee appointed (previous to their mutiny) to inquire into their grievances and to which they thought to have dictated their own terms. having long been convinced that in Cases of insurgency no medium lay either for Civil or Military bodies  
between dignity and Servility but Coertion, and that no other method could be possibly fallen upon without the deepest wound to Service, I instantly determined to adopt it. we

ceed against them with decision. General Howe  
marched from Kingwood about midnight, and by  
the dawning of day had his men in four different |  
positions, to prevent the revolters from making |  
their escape. LEvery avenue being secured, Col.  
Barber was sent to them, with orders to parade  
immediately without arms, and to march to a par­  
ticular spot of ground. Some hesitation appear­  
ing among them, Col. Sproat was directed to ad­  
vance, and only five minutes were given to the  
mutineers to comply with the orders which had  
been sent them. &#x27;This had its effect; and they,  
to a man, marched without arms to the appoint­  
ed ground. The officers gave a list of the lead­  
ers of the revolt, upon which Gen. Howe desir­  
ed them to select three of the greatest offenders.  
A field court martial was immediately held upon  
these three, and they were unanimously sentenc­  
ed to death. Two of them were executed on the  
spot, and the executioners were selected from  
among the most active in the mutiny. It should  
be recollected, that at the periods to which we ‘  
have referred, the American army was in the  
most distressed condition ; many of the men were  
kept in service beyond the periods for which they  
é had engaged to serve—no pay, and scarcely any

Rinewoopn, Jan. 27, 1781.  
  
Sir: In obedience to your Excellency’s commands,  
I arrived at this place yesterday evening, and found  
that the mutineers were returning to their huts.  
Col. Dayton had offered them pardon for their of-  
fences, provided they immediately would put them-  
selves under the command of their officers, and  
would behave in future consistent with that subor-  
dination so essential to military discipline. To  
this, they seemingly acceded; but soon demon-  
strated by their conduct that they were actuated  
by motives exceedingly distinct from those they  
had professed—for though, in some respects, they  
would suffer a few particular officers to have influ-  
ence over them—yet it was by no means the case  
in general, and what they did do, appeared rather  
like following advice than obeying command. Ar-  
rived at their huts, they condescended once to parade  
when ordered, but were no sooner dismissed than  
several officers were insulted,—one had a bayonet  
put to his breast, and upon the man’s being knocked  
down for his insolence, a musket was fired, which,  
being their alarm signal, most of them paraded in  
arms. In short, their whole behavior was such  
as cried aloud for chastisement, and made it evi-  
dent they had only returned to their huts as a  
place more convenient for themselves. * * *  
Having long been convinced, that in cases of in-  
surgency no medium lay either for civil or military  
bodies between dignity and security, but coercion,  
and that no other method could be fallen upon  
without the deepest wound to the service, I in-  
  
  
  
Grorere WasHINGTON.”  
  
stantly determined to adopt it. * * *
