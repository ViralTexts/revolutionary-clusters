 which sprung out of it in quick succession.  
After several consultations with the governor and judges touching the arrest and confinement of certain known  
agents and emissaries of colonel Burr in this city and territory, whose intrigues and machinations were to be apprehended,  
it is with their privity and approbation, that I have caused three of them to be arrested, viz. Doctor Erick Bollman,  
Samuel Swartwout, and Peter V. Ogden, against whom I possess strong facts; and I have recommended to the governor to  
have James Alexander, esq. taken up on the grounds of strong suspicion.  
These persons, and all others who, by their characters and deportment, may be considered hostile to the  
interests of the United States, or dangerous to this feeble frontier, under the menacing aspect of things from above,  
will, if my influence here can prevail, be seized and sent by sea to the United States, subject to the disposition of  
government, and accompanied by such information as may justify their confinement, and furnish a clue to the developement  
of the grounds, progress and projectors of the treasonable enterprise in which they are engaged.  
This letter will accompany Dr. Bollman, to be this day embarked in a vessel bound for Charleston, under the  
charge of lieutenant Willson, of the artillery, who has orders to land with his prisoner at fort Johnson or fort Moultrie,  
to forward this despatch by mail, and to wait the orders of the executive.  
Mr. Swartwout will be sent to Baltimore, by a vessel which will sail sometime the ensuing week, in custody of  
another subaltern, who will be the bearer of strong testimony against him, and also colonel Burr; and the others will  
follow under due precaution, by the earliest opportunities which may present.  
By this procedure we may intimidate the confederates, who are unquestionably numerous in this, as well as the  
adjacent territory, disconcert their arrangements, and possibly destroy their intrigues; and I hope the zeal which directs  
the measure may be justified and approved; for whilst the glow of patriotism actuates my conduct, and I am willing to  
offer myself a martyr to the constitution of my country, I should, indeed, be most grievously disappointed, did I incur its  
censure.

After several consultations with the governor and  
judges, touching the attest and confinement of cer­  
tain^gpwn agents and emissaries of Col. Burr, in  
this city and territory, whose intrigues and machi­  
nations were to be apprehended, it is with their  
privity aud approbation that I have caused three of  
them to be arrested, viz. Doct. Errick Bollman,  
Samuel Swartwout and Peter V. Ogden, against  
whom*! possess strong facts, and I have recom­  
mended to the governor to have James Alexander,  
Esq. taken up on the grounds of strong suspicion.  
These persons and all others who, by their charac­  
ter and deportment, may he considered hostile to  
the interests of the United Slates, or dangerous to  
this feeble frontier, under the menacing aspect of  
things from above, will, if my influence can prevail,  
he seized and sent by sea to the United States, sub­  
ject to the disposition of the government, and ac­  
coinpanied by such information as may justify their  
confinement, and furnish a clue to the develope­  
ment of the grount^, progress and projectors of the*  
treasonable enterprise in which they are engaged.  
This letter will accompany Doct. Bollman, who  
is to be this day embarked in a vessel bound for  
Charleston, under the charge of lieutenant JVilson  
j of the artillery, who has orders to land with his  
i prisoner at fort Johnston or fort Moultrie, to for­  
ward this dispatch by mail, and to wait the or­

sent to Baltimore by a vessel which will sail some
