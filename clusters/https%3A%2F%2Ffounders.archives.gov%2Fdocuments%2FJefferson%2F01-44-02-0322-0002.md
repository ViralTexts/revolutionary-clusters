On thursday September 6th. 1804 about noon, a note of which the following is a transcript was left at my office, as my Clerk informed me by a person who lives with Mr. Francis Breuil, Merchant in Philadelphia.   
“The Marquis de Casa Yrujo presents his compts. to Major Jackson, and would be very happy to know from him and where he could have the pleasure to see him in the course of this day.   
Thursday 6.”   
Never having before received any communication from Mr. Yrujo—never having even exchanged one word of conversation with him in my life—I was not a little surprized at receiving this message, which I answered by a note to the following purport.   
“Major Jackson presents his compliments to the Marquis de Casa Yrujo—in reply to his note of this morning, just now received, Major Jackson will be at his office, until 2 o’clock—and at his house in Chesnut street, next to Genl. Dickinsons until four o’clock, at either of which places he will see the Marquis de Casa Yrujo—or, if more convenient, he will wait on him.   
Thursday Septr. 6th.”   
This note was sent by Mr. Johnson, my Clerk, and left at Governor McKeans—Mr. Breuil called on me soon after and said that the Marquis de Casa Yrujo would be glad to see me at the Marquis’s House at 5 o’clock. I asked Mr. Breuil if he knew on what business Mr. Yrujo wanted to see me—he said he did not know. I went at 5 o’clock to Mr. Yrujo’s house, and on entering the room was accosted by him in nearly the following words.   
“You will be surprized Major Jackson at the liberty I have taken in sending for you—but I trust an explanation of the motive will excuse me. I consider you, Sir, as a Gentleman, a man of letters, and a man of honor—By a political intolerance you have been forced to adopt a different profession from what you have heretofore pursued—but it is one in which, you are qualified to be very useful.   
“I observe by certain opinions expressed in your paper that you consider the present administration (for I will not call them government—) as disinclined to go to war with Spain—in this, however, you are mistaken—The reverse is the case or fact—and they only wish the federal papers to utter those opinions that they may have an argument of that sort for indulging their wish to go to war with my country; which would certainly be very injurious to yours—For if the King, my Master, was to order three ships of the line and six frigates to the Mississippi—and three ships of the line and six frigates to Chesapeak and three ships of the line and six frigates to Sandy Hook—what could you do? But you have it in your power to do much good by espousing the part of peace, which is so necessary to both nations—and if you will consent to take elucidations from me on the subject, I will furnish them—and I will make you any acknowledgment.”—Perceiving at this moment his infamous purpose, I with difficulty stifled the emotions, which it excited and restrained my indignation. He went on to examine in detail the several points in dispute between Spain and the United States—and, as I wished to learn his opinions respecting them I suffered him to proceed. Among other observations he said “that if Mr. Pinckney had acted by instructions from the administration—or if his conduct should be approved by them war was inevitable—but he had no doubt war was the wish of our administration—for he had received a letter from New Orleans dated on the 25th of April last, which stated that there was a letter at that place in Mr. Jefferson’s hand writing dated in March last, which declared that if the settlers between the Mississippi and the Rio Perdido would raise the American colours they should be supported.” He continued his observations, and pressed me to give him an answer, assuring me “that this was no diplomatic management—but an epanchement (unbosoming) of himself to me as a man of honor—and he trusted I would so consider it.” I then quitted the room—he went with me to the street door, and again asked me when I would give him an answer—With difficulty I suppressed the indignation of my feelings, and left the house.

war was the wifh of our adminiftration—

which ftated that there was a letter at that  
place in Mr. Jefferfon’s hand writing, da-

On Thurfday, Sept. 6th, 1804,  
about noon, a note, of which-the fol.  
lowing is a trufcti!)t, was left at my  
office, as my clerk informed me, by a  
perfon who lives with Mr. Francis  
Breuil, merchant in Philadelphia :  
  
“ The marquis de Cafa Yrujo pre­  
¢ fents his compliments to major Jack­  
“fon, and would be very happy to  
“ know from him when and where he  
‘“ could have the pleafure to fee him  
“ in the courfe ofP this day.”  
“ Thurfday 6.”  
Never having before received any  
communication from Mr. Yrujo—  
never having even exchanged one  
word of converfation with him in my  
lite—l was not a little furprized ar  
receiving this meflage, which I anf  
wered by a note to the following pur­  
ip&quot;o&quot;“ Major Jackfon prefents his com­  
i“¢lﬂ_enn. o the marquis de Cafa

.« Thur/day, Sept. 6. 5  
| J I}gmtcfw&#x27;a fent by Mr. Johns  
fon my“clerk, and left at Governor  
M’Kean’s, Mr. Breuil called on me  
foon after, and faid, that the marquis  
de Cafa Yrojo would be glad to fee  
me at the marquis’ houfeat 5 o’clock.  
| atked Mr. Breuil it he knew on  
what bufinels Mr. Yrujo wanted to  
fee me—he faid he did not know.  
  
I went at 5 o’clock to Mr. Yrujo&#x27;s  
houle, and on entering the room, was  
accofted by him in nearly the follow­  
ing words : | .  
  
“ You will be furprized, major  
Jackie.n, at the liberty I have taken in  
fending to you, but 1 truf%&#x27;,awexplw  
ation of t!;e motive wiflexcufe me, -  
I confider_you, Sir, as a gentleman; a  
man of letters, and a man of honor. .  
“By ‘a poliiical intolerance you  
have been forced to adopta\profxo&amp; ;  
difterent from what&#x27;you have heretds  
fore purfued—but it is ope.in which  
you are qualified to be veryufefui. 1§  
oblerve by certain opinions expreffed  
in your paper that ‘you confider the .  
prefent édminjﬁralion (for 1 will not -  
call them government) as difinclined, -  
to go to war with Spain, however “you  
are miltaken—the reverfe is the fait  
—~and they only with the federal pa­  
pers to utter thofe opinions that they -  
may have an argp:em&#x27;oftbat fort for  
indulging their wifb to.go to war with  
my country, “which would certainly  
be very injurious to your’s-—for if the  
King my mafter, was to order three &#x27;  
fhips of the line and fix frigates to­  
the Miffifippi—three thips of the line  
and fix frigates to the Chealapeak—  
and three lﬁips of the line and fix fri­  
gates to Sandy Hook--what would  
you do ? But you have it in your pow­  
to do much good, *by efpoufing the  
part of peack, which is fo ncc&#x27;eﬂgry to  
:goth nations—=and if you will confent  
to take elucidations on the fubjedt  
from me, 1 will farnifh them, &amp; I will  
‘make you any acknowledgements.’””  
Perceiving, at this moment, his infa- |  
‘mous purpofe, I with difficulty Rtifled :  
the emotions—which it excited, and  
reftrained my indignation. He went  
on to examine’in detail the feveral  
points in difpute between Spain and -  
the United States—and, as [ withed  
to learn bis opinions refpeing them,  
1 fuffered him to_proceed. Among  
other things he faid that if Mr, Piack­  
ney had a&amp;ted by inftru&amp;ions from  
the adminiftration, or if his condu&amp;  
fhould be approved by them, war was  
inevitable. But he had no doubt war |,  
&#x27;was the with of our adminiftratioge—  
for he had received a letter from New-  
Orleans, dated on the 25th of April  
laft, which ftated that there was a  
letter at that place in Mr. Jeffer­  
fon’s hand writing, dated in March  
laft, which declared that if the fettlers  
between the Miffifippi and the Rio  
Perdido would raife the American co­  
lours, they fhould be fupported.  
He -continued his obfervations,  
and prefled me to give him an anfwer .  
—afinring me that this was no diplo­  
matic management,but an epanchemens |  
(unbofoming) of himlelf to me as 2  
man of honor, and he trufted I would  
fo comfider it. I then quitted the &#x27;  
room&#x27;; he went with me to the ftreet  
door, and again atked me when I  
would give him an anfwer. With dit­  
ficuity I fupprefled the indignation of  
my feelings and left the houle.

surprized at receiving this message, which I answer­

ft at Governour M’Kean&#x27;s. Mr. Breuil called on

ne soon after, and Said that the Marquis de Casa

at 5 o&#x27;clock. &#x27;  
I asked Mr. Breuil if he knew on what business  
Mr. Yrqjo wanted to See me—he said he did not  
know. ■■ » *. !  
I went at 5 o’clock to Mr; Yruio’s house, and, on  
entering the room, was accosted by him in nearly the  
following •’-vords:  
“ You will be surprized, Major Jackson, at the li­  
berty I have taken in sending to you, but I trust an&gt;  
explanation of the motive will eicuse me. I consi­  
der, yon, Sir, as a gentleman, a man of letters, and  
a man of honour.  
“ By a political intolerance you have‘?j*en forced  
to adept a profession diffi-rent from what you have  
heretofore pursued—but it is one in which you are  
qualified to be very useful. I observe by certain opi­  
nions expressed in yoflrC paper that you consider the  
present administration (for I will not call them go.  
vernment) as disinclined to go to war with Spain,  
however you are mistaken; the reverse is the fact—  
and they only wish the federal papers to utter those  
opinions that they may have an argument of that sort  
for indulging theft- wish to go to war with my  
country, which would certainly be v&lt;rv iniurious tm  
  
your s; tor 11 the Jung my master, was to order three  
ships of the line, and six frigates to the Mississippi­  
three ships of tiie line, and six frigates to the Chessw  
peake-^and three ships of the line, and six frigates to  
Sandy HOok—what would y6u do? But you have it  
in your power, to do much good, by espousing the  
part of peace, which is so necessarv to both nations  
—and if you will consent to take elucidations onthe  
subject from me, I *ill furnish them—and I will  
make you, any acknowledgments.&quot; Perceiving, at  
this moment, his infamous purpose, I with difficulty  
stifled the emotions which it excited, and restrained  
my indignation. He went on to examine in detail the  
several points in dispute betweeh Spain? &#x27;and the U­  
nited States—and, as 1, wished to ieftVfl hte opinions  
respecting themr, I suffered Him to proceed. &#x27; A­  
mong other things he said, that if Mr. Pinckney had  
acted by instructions from die administration, or if  
his conduct should be approved by them, star was hr.  
eviTablc. But he had no doubt war wa$ ttftTwisft of  
our administration—for he had received a Utter from  
New-Orleans, dated on the 25th April last, which  
stated that there was a letter at that place, in Mr  
Jefferson&#x27;s hand writing, dated in March last, which  
declared that if the settlers between the Mississippi  
and the Rio Perdido, would rabe the American co*  
lours, they should be supported.  
&#x27; He continued his Observations^ and pressed* me to  
give him an answer—assuring me that this was no  
diplomatic^ management, birt an e/mnehemrnt (unbo­  
soming) of himself to me asaman of honour and he  
trusted I would so consider it. I then quitted the  
room; he went with me to the stt-eet door, and  
asked me when 1 would give him answer. • With  
difficulty I suppressed the indignation of my feelings  
and left (he house.

accosted by him in nearly the follow­  
ing words : -  
“You will be furprized, Major

moment, his infamous purpose, I with  
difficulty fiifled the emotions which  
it excited, and refrained my indigna­

taii the {everil points&#x27;in dispute ba­

W. JACKSON.  
Sept. 20.  
On Thursday, September 6th,  
1804, about noon, a note of which  
the following is a transcript, left at  
my office, as my clerk lnforraea me,  
by a person who iives with Mr. Fran­  
cis Breuil, merchant in Philadelphia :  
a The Marquis de Casa Yrmo  
presents his compliments to Major  
Jackson and would be very happy to  
know from him when and where he  
could have the pleasure to see him  
in the course of this day.&quot;  
Tbursaay 6.  
Never having before received any  
communication from Mr. Yrujo ne  
ver having even exchanged one vrd  
of conversation with him in mv life  
was not a little surprised at recei  
ving this message, which I answered,  
by a note to the following purport :  
&quot; Major Jackson presents his  
compliments to the Marquis de Casa  
Yrujo in reply to h&#x27;.s note of this  
morning, just now received, Major  
Jackson will be at his office until two  
o&#x27;clock and at his house in Ches­  
nut street, next to Gen. Dickinson,  
until 4 o&#x27;clock at either of which  
places he will see the Marquis de  
Casa Yrujo -or, if more convenient,  
he will Wait on him.&quot;  
Thursday, Septt 6.  
This note was sent by Mr. John  
son, my clerk, and left at Governor  
M&#x27;Kean&#x27;s. Mr. Breuil&quot; called on me  
soon after, and said; that the Mar­  
quis de Casa Yrujo would be glad to  
see me at the Marquis house at 5  
o&#x27;clock. . &#x27; .  
I asked Mr. Breuil if he knew on  
what business Mr. Yrujo wanted to  
vsee me he said he did not know.  
I went 5 o&#x27;clock to Mr. Yrujo&#x27;s  
jioujndft entering the room  
wlsaostecl; by him in nearly the  
followihgord s :  
You will be surprised Major  
Jackson, at the libertyX have taken  
in sending to you, but&#x27; P trust an ex­  
planbmptive will excuse  
meF consideV you, sir, as a gen­  
tleman, a man of letters, and a man  
of honor.  
&quot; By a political intolerance you  
have been forced to adopt a profes­  
sion different from what you have  
heretofore pursued but it is one in.  
which you are qualified to be very  
useful. J . bserve by &quot;certain oi­

roent) as disinclined&#x27; to go to war  
with Spain, no we ver you . are irifeta­  
keh&#x27;V the reverse is the fact ind  
they only wish the federal papers to  
utter those opinions thatthey may  
h ave ah argument of that sort for  
indulging their wish to go td war with  
my country,, whtcli would certainly  
e veryinj.uriou to your&#x27;s ; for $  
the King myniaster, was to order  
tltree ships oft line and sifrR  
  
gates to the Mississjitithre&#x27;fhH  
peake and three ships ofthe line  
and six frigates to Sandy Hook-I  
what would you do f But you have  
it in your power to do much good,  
by espousing the part of peace, whieh  
is so necessary to both nations and  
if you will consent to take eludica­  
tions on the subject from me, I will  
furnish thenwand will make you any  
acknowledgments.&quot; Perceiving at  
this moment, his infamous purpose,  
I with difficulty stifled the emotions  
which it excited, and restrained my  
indignation. He went onto exa­  
mine in detail the several points in  
dispute between Spain and the Uni­  
ted Ststes aid, as I wished to fearn  
his opinions respecting them, I suf­  
fered him to proceed. Among other  
things he said, that if Mr. Pinkney  
had acted by instruction from the  
administratiou, or if his conduct  
should be approved by them, war  
was inevitable. - But he had no doubt  
war was the wish of our administra­  
tion, for he had received a letter  
I from Ne w-Orleans dated on the 25 th  
April last, which stated there was a  
letter at that placein Mr. Jefferson&#x27;s­  
hand writing, dated in March last,  
which declared that if the settlers be­  
tween the Mississippi and the Rio  
Perdido shotrid raise. the American  
colors, they should be supported  
He continued his observations, and  
pressed me to give him an- answer,  
assuring me that this wa no diplo­  
matic management, but an epanch­  
ment (unbosoming) of himself to me  
as;i man of honor, and he trusted I  
would so consider it I then quitted  
the room ; he Went with me to street  
door, and again asked me when I  
would give him an answer. With  
difficulty I suppressed the indigna­  
tion of my feelings and left the hous
