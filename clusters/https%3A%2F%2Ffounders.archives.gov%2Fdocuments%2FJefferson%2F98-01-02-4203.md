Dear Sir  Monticello Apr. 19. 24.I recieved in due time your favor of the 12th requesting my opinion on the proposition to call a Convention for amending the Constitution of the state. that this should not be perfect cannot be a subject of wonder, when it is considered that ours was not only the first of the American states, but the first nation in the world, at least within the records of history, which peaceably, by it’s wise men, formed, on  free deliberation, a constitution of government for itself, and deposited it in writing, among their archives, always ready and open to the appeal of every citizen. the other states, who successively formed constitutions for themselves also, had the benefit of our outline, and have made on it doubtless successive improvements. one in the very outset, and which has been adopted in every subsequent constitution, was to lay it’s foundation in the authority of the nation. to our convention no special authority had been delegated by the people to form a permanent constitution, over which their successors in legislation should have no powers of  alteration. they had been elected for the ordinary purposes of legislation only, and at a time when the establishment of a new government had not been proposed or contemplated. altho’ therefore they gave to this act the title of a constitution, yet it could be no more than an act of legislation subject, as their other acts were, to alteration by their successors. it has been said indeed that the acquiescence of the people supplied the want of original power. but it is a dangerous lesson to say to them ‘whenever your functionaries exercise unlawful authority over you, if you do not go into actual resistance, it will be deemed acquiescence &amp; confirmation.’ how long had we acquiesced under usurpations of the British parliament? had that confirmed them in right, and made our revolution a wrong? besides, no authority has yet decided whether this resistance must be instantaneous; when the right to resist ceases, or whether it has yet ceased? of the 24. states now organised, 23. have disapproved our doctrine and example, and have deemed the authority of their people a necessary foundation for a constitution.Another defect which has been corrected by most of the states is that the basis of our constitution is in opposition to the principle of equal political rights, refusing to all but freeholders any participation in the natural right of self-government. it is believed, for example that a very great majority of the militia, on whom the burthen of military duty was imposed in the late war, were men unrepresented in the legislation which imposed this burthen on them. however nature may by mental or physical disqualifications have marked infants and the weaker sex for the protection, rather than the direction of government, yet among the men who either pay or fight for their country, no line of right can be drawn. the exclusion of a majority of our freemen from the right of representation is merely arbitrary. and an usurpation of the minority over the majority; for it is believed that the Non-freeholders compose the majority of our free &amp; adult male citizens.And even among our citizens who participate in the representative privilege, the equality of political rights is entirely prostrated by our constitution. upon what principle of right or reason can any one justify the giving to every citizen of Warwick as much weight in the government as to 22. equal citizens in Loudon, and similar inequalities among the other counties? if these fundamental principles are of no importance in actual government, then no principles are important, and it is as well to rely on the dispositions of an administration, good or evil, as on the provisions of a constitution.I shall not enter into the details of smaller defects, altho’ others there doubtless are, the reformation of some of which might very much lessen the expences of government, improve it’s organisation, and add to the wisdom and purity of it’s administration in all it’s parts. but these things I leave to others, not permitting myself to take sides in the political questions of the day. I willingly acquiesce  in the institutions of my country, perfect or imperfect; and think it a duty to leave their modifications to those who are to live under them, and are to participate of the good or evil they may produce. the present generation has the same right of self-government which the past one has exercised for itself. and in the full vigor of body and mind are more able to judge for themselves than those who are sinking under the wane of both. if the sense of our citizens on the question of a convention can be fairly and fully taken, it’s result will, I am sure, be wise and salutary; and far from arrogating the office of advice, no one will more passively acquiesce in it than myself. retiring therefore to the tranquility called for by increasing years and debility, I wish not to be understood as intermedling in this question; and to my prayers for the general good, I have only to add assurances to yourself of my great esteem and respect.Th: Jefferson

Monticello, April 19, I82f.  
Dear Sir: I received in due lime your favor  
of Hie 12th, requesting my opinion on the  
proposition to call :« convention for amending  
ihe constitution of the state. That this should  
not be perfect cannot lie a subject of wonder,  
vlien it is considered that ours was not only  
Hie first of the America!! stales, but thi* first  
nation in the world, at least within the records  
of history, wliteh peaceably, by its wise men,  
formed, on free deliberation, a constitution of  
joterniui.-iit for itseif, and deposited il in nrit­  
itig atnoiiM iheir archives, lead}- and open to  
tin- appeal of every citizen. The other states,  
who successively formed constitutions for  
  
irs also, iiau ihe benefit of our out­  
line, and have marie on it doubtless successive  
improvements. One, in the very outset, and  
w hich has been adopted in every subsequent  
constitution, was to lay its foundation in the  
authprity of the nation. To our convention  
no special authority had been d&lt; legated by  
the people to form a permanent coustituiinn,  
over which their successors in legistatioa  
should have no power of alteration. They  
had been elected /’or the ordinary purposes of  
legislation only, and at a time when the es­  
tablishment of a new government had not  
been proposed or contemplated. Although,  
therefore, they gave to this act the title of a  
constitution, yet it could be no more than an  
act of legislation, subject, as their other acts  
were, to alteration by their successors. It  
has been said indeed (.hat the ecquiescence of  
the people has supplied the want of original  
power. But it is a dangerous lesson to say to  
them * whenever your functionaries exercise  
unlawful authority over you, if you do not go  
into actual resistance, it will be deemed acqui­  
escence, and confirmation.’ Besides, no au­  
thority-has yet decided whether the resistance  
must he instantaneous ? When the right to re­  
sist ceases ? or whether it has yet ceased?  
Of the 24 states now organized, 23 have dis­  
approved bur doctrine and example, and have  
deemed »he formal authority of their .people  
f» necessary foundation for a constitution.  
Abother defect which has been corrected by  
m«st of the. other states is, that the basis of  
our constitution is in opposition to the princi­  
ple of equal political rights, refusing to all hut  
freeholdersjiny participation in the natural  
right of self government.. It is believed, for ex­  
ample, that a very great majority of the mili­  
tia on whom the burthen of military duty  
was imposed in the late war, were men unre­  
presented in the legislation which imposed  
this burthen on them. However nature may,  
by mental or physical disqualifications, nave  
muked infants and the weaker sex for the  
protection, rather than the. direction of go­  
vernment, yet among the men who either pay,  
or fight for their country, no line of right can  
be drawn. The exclusion of a majority of  
our freemen from the right of representation  
is merely arbiti ary, and an usurpation of the  
minority ever the majority. Fur it is believed  
that the non-freeholders compose the majority  
of our free, adult male citizens.  
And even among our citizens who partici­  
pate intliH representative privilege, the equal­  
ity nf political rights is entirely prostrated by  
our constitution. Upon what principle of  
rightor reason can any one j -rtify the giving  
to every citizen of Warwick as much weight  
in the government as to 22 equal citizens in  
Loudoun ? And similar inequalities among the  
othei counties? If these fundamental principles  
are of no importance in actual government,  
then no principles are important, and it is as  
  
~% ,,n uis|)iN)iiiun9, gn»Mi or hi, 01  
an administration, as on the provisions of a  
constitution.  
( shall not enter into details of smaller de­  
fect&#x27;*: although, others there doubtless are,  
the reformation of some.of which might great­  
ly lessen the expent es of government, improve  
its organization, and add to the wisdom of its.  
administration in all its parts. But these  
things I leave to others, not permitting oiyself  
lo take sides in the political questions of the  
day. I.willingly acquiesce to the institutions  
of my C!&gt;un&#x27;ry, perfect or imperfect, nod think  
it a duty, to leave their, modifications to tho**«  
who are to-live under them, and are to parti  
cipate of the good or evil they m»y produce.  
The present generation have flip same right  
nf self government which the past one has ex­  
ercised for itself; and, in the full vigor of bo­  
dy and mind, are more able to Judge for them­  
st Ives than those who are sinking under the  
wane of both. If the sense of our citizens on  
the question nf a convention can be fairly and  
folly taken, its result will, I|am sure, he wise  
and salutary ; and far from arrogating Uie of­  
fice of advice, nn one will more passively ac­  
quiesce in if than myself. Retiring, therefore,  
to the. tranquillity called for by increasing  
years and debility, (.wish not to intermeddle  
in this questinn : and to my prayers for the ge­  
neral good, I have only to add assurances to  
yowfelf of my great esteem and respect.

Monhcello, April 19, 1324.  
Dear Sir : 1 received in due time  
your favor of the 12lh, requesting my  
opinion on tiie proposition to call a con­  
vention for amending the constitution  
of the state. Tt at this should not be  
perfect cannot be a subject of wonder  
when it is considered ours was not on­  
ly the first of the American states, but  
the first nation in the world at least  
within the records of history, which pea­  
ceably, by its wise men, formed, on free  
deliberation, a constitution of govern­  
ment for itself, and deposited it in writ­  
ing among thuir archives, ready and  
open to the appeal of every citizen.—  
The other states, who successively for­  
med constitutions for themselves also,  
had the beneiit of our outline, and have ,  
made on ic doubtless successive improve- J  
ments. One, in the very outset, and j  
which has been adopted in every sub­  
sequent constitution, w as to lay its foun­  
dation in the authority of the nation.  
To our convention no special authori­  
ty had been delegated by the people to j  
form a permanent constitution, over  
which their successors in legislation  
should have no power of alteration.— |  
They had been elected for the ordina­  
ry purposes of legislation only, and at a  
time when the establishment ot a new&#x27;  
government had not been proposed or  
contemplated. Although,therefore,they  
gave to this act the title of a constitu­  
tion, yet it could be no more than an  
act of legislation, subject, as their other  
acts were, to alteration by their succes­  
sors ft has been said indeed that the  
acquiescence of the people has supplied  
the want of original power. But it is a  
dangerous leSson to say to them ‘when­  
ever your functionrie.s excercise unlaw­  
ful authoi ity over you, if you do not go  
into actual resistance, it will be deemed  
acquiescence, and confirmation.’ Be­  
sides, no authority has yet decided  
whether the resistance must be instan­  
taneous? When the right Co resist cea­  
ses? or whether it has yet ceased&#x27; Ot  
the 2 t states now organized, 23 have  
disapproved our doctrine and example,  
and have deemed the formal authority  
of their people a necessary foundation  
for a constitution:  
  
Another driect which has been for­  
rected by most of the other states is, that  
the basis of our constitution is in oppo­  
sition to the principle of equal political  
rights, refusing to all but freeholders  
any participation in the natural right  
of self government. It is believed, for  
example, that a very great majority of  
the militia on whom the burthen ol mi­  
litary duty was imposed in the late war,  
were men unrepresented in the legislatui c  
which imposed this burthen on them.  
However nature may, by mental or phy­  
sical disqualifications, have marked in­  
fants and the Weaker sex for the pro­  
tection, rather than the direction of go­  
vernment, yet among the merit who ei­  
ther pay, or fight for their country no  
line of right can he drawn.* The exclu­  
sion of a majority of our freemen from  
the right of representation is merely ar­  
biirarv, and an usurpation of the mino­  
rity over the majority. I&#x27;or it is believ­  
ed that the nOn-frcehoMers compose the  
majority of &lt;sur free, adult male citi­  
zens.  
And even among our citizens who par­  
ticipate in the representative privilege,  
the equality of pole i- ul rights i1- entirely  
prostrated by our constitution. I pon  
what principle of right or reason can  
,;iv one justify the giving to every citi­  
&#x27;en of W ui&#x27;.&#x27;vick as much w eight in the  
  
government as to 22 eq&#x27;ial citi&#x27;rens in  
Loudoun? And similar inequalities a­  
inong the other counties&#x27; It these  
fundamental principles are of Tin impor­  
tame, and it is as well to rely on the dis­  
positions, good or ill, of an administra­  
tion, as on the provisions of a constitu­  
tion.  
1 shall not enter into details of ^mai­  
ler defects; although, others there dout­  
fess are, the reformation of some of  
w hich might greatly lesson the expen­  
ses of government, improve its organi­  
zation, and add to the wisdom of its ad­  
ministration in all its parts. But these  
things I leave to others, not permitting  
rnyself to take sides in the political  
questions of the day. I willingly ac­  
quiesce in the institutions of my country,  
perfect or imperfect, at: 1 think it aduty  
to leave their modification to those  
who are to live under them, and are to  
participate of the good or evil they may  
produce. The present generation have  
tiie same right of self government which  
the past one has exercised for itself ;  
and, in the full yig&quot;r of body and mind,  
arc more able to judge for themselves  
than those who* are sinking under the  
wane of both. If tj^p sense of our citi­  
zens on the question i&gt;F a convention can  
be fairly and hilly taken, its result will,  
lam sure, be wise and salutary; and far  
from arrogating the office of advice, no  
one will more passive acquiesce in it  
than myself. Iletiring, therefore, to  
j the tranquility called for by increasing

successors. - It lias been said indeed that the  
acquiescence of the people has silpplied the  
want of j original power .But it is a danger­  
ous lesson to say to them wherieyer your  
  
functionaries exercise unlawful authority over  
  
you, if you do not go into t actual resistance,  
it will be deemed acquiescence, &#x27;arid confir  
  
mation&#x27; &#x27; Besides, no authority has yet de-  
  
ciaeci. wnetner tne resistance must oe insxan­  
taneous ? When the rigjht to resist ceases ?  
or whether it has yet erased ? Of the 2f  
  
states now organized, 23 have disapproved  
  
our doctrine and example, and have deemed  
  
the formal authority of their people! a neces­  
sarr. foundation for a constitution. ;  
Another defect which has been corrected  
by most of the other stapes is, that the basis  
of our constitution is in opposition to the prin­  
ciple of equal. political rights, refusing to all  
but freeholders any parti c-pation in the natu­  
ral right of self goverrunent. It; is believed,  
for example that a very reat majority of the  
mili&#x27;ia on whom the Jurtfien of military duty  
was imposed in the late war, were men unre­  
presented in the legislature J which imposed  
this burthenori them. However nature may,  
by mental or physical disqualifications have  
Tnarkedf infants and the jweaker sex for the  
protection, rather than, the direction &quot;of go­  
vernment, yet among the men who either  
pay, or. fight for their country, no line of right  
can be drawn. The exclusion of a majority&quot;  
of pur freemen from the! .right -&#x27;of representa­  
tion is merely arbitrary, and usurpation of the  
minority! over the majority.- For it is believ­  
ed that the hoa-freeholders compose the ma  
  
jority of our free, adult niale citizens.  
  
And even among bur citizens who partici­  
pate in the representative privilege, the e-  
  
quality of political rights is entirely prostrated  
  
Dy our constituuon. upson wnat principle ot  
right or reason can any one, justify the giving  
to every citizen of Warwick a:, much weight  
in the government as 22 ejqual citizens in Lou­  
doun ? And similar inequalities among the  
other counties I If these fundamental princi­  
ples are of ;no importance Mn actual govern­  
ment then no principles ire important, and it  
is as vvjell to rely on the dispositions, good or  
ill, of art administration, as on the provisions  
of a constitution.. ..  
; T shall notj enter into details of smaller de-&quot;  
fe&#x27;ets ; although, others there doubtless are,  
the reformation of some of which might great­  
ly lessen the expenses of government, improve  
its organization, and add to the Wisdom of  
its administration in allots parts. But these  
things .1 leave to others,&#x27; not permitting my­  
self to take sides in the political questions of  
the day. I willingly acq uiesce in the institu­  
tions of my country, perfect or imperfect, &amp;  
tliink it a duty to leave jthejr modifications to  
those who are to live u rider them, and who  
are to participate of the good or evil they may  
produce.- The present geneiation have the  
same right- of&quot; sclf-goverijment which the past  
one has exercised for iteif ; and, in the, full  
vigor of body and mirfd, are more able to  
  
iudge for themselves than those who are sink-  
  
mg under Ahe wane o both.; It the sense ot  
  
our citizens on the . question ot a convention  
can be fairly and fully takeu, its result will, I  
am sure, be wise and salutary and far from  
  
arrogatingthe offiee Of j advice, no one! Will  
  
more passively acquiespe m u . man my sen.  
Retiring, therefore, to the tranquillity called  
for by increasing years! and debility, I wish  
not to intermeddle in; ihidi question : and to  
my prayers for the general good, I have only  
tq add assurances toi yo arse If of my great es­

refusing to all but freeholders any parti

constitution is in opposition to the principle of equal political rights, refusing  
to all but freeholders any participation in the natural right of self govern-  
ment. The exclusion of a majority of our freemen from the right of repre-

majority.... In the representative privilege the equality of political
