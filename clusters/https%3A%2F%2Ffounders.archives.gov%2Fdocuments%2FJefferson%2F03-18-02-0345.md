Messrs Ritchie and Gooch  
  
Monticello May 13. 22.  
  
I am thankful to you for the paper you have been so kind as to send me, containing the arraignment of the Presidents of the US. generally as peculators or accessaries to peculation, by an informer who masks himself under the signature of ‘a native Virginian.’ what relates to myself in this paper, (being his No VI. and the only No I have seen) I had before read in the Federal Republican of Baltimore of Aug. 28. which was sent to me by a friend with the real name of the Author. it was published there during the ferment of a warmly contested election. I considered it therefore as an electioneering maneuvre merely, and did not even think it required the trouble of recollecting, after a lapse of 33. years, the circumstances of the case in which he charges me with having purloined from the Treasury of the US. the sum of 1148. Dollars. but as he has thought it worth repeating in his Roll of informations against your Presidents nominally, I shall give the truths of the case, which he has omitted, perhaps because he did not know them and ventured too inconsiderately to supply them from his own conjectures.  
On the return from my mission to France, and joining the Government here, in the spring of  1790. I had a long and heavy account to settle with the US. of the administration of their pecuniary affairs in Europe, of which the superintendance had been confided to me while there. I gave in my account early, but the pressure of other business did not permit the accounting officers to attend to it till Oct. 10. 1792. when we settled, and a balance of 888. D 67 C appearing to be due from me (but erroneously as will be shewn) I paid the money the same day, delivered up my vouchers, and recieved a certificate of it. but still the articles of my draughts on the bankers could be only provisionally past, until their accounts also should be recieved to be confronted with mine. and it was not till the 24th of June 1804 1804. that I recieved a letter from mr Richard Harrison the Auditor informing me ‘that my accounts, as Minister to France, had been adjusted and  closed’ adding ‘the bill drawn and credited by you under date of the 21st of Octob. 1789. for banco florins 2800. having never yet appeared in any account of the Dutch bankers, stands at your debit only as a provisional charge. if it should hereafter turn out, as I incline to think it will, that this bill has never been negociated or used by mr Grand, you will have a just claim on the public for it’s value.’ this was the first intimation to me that I had too hastily charged myself with that draught. I determined however as I had allowed it in my account, and paid up the balance it had produced against me, to let it remain a while, as there was a possibility that the draught might still be presented by the holder to the bankers: and so it remained till I was near leaving Washington on my final retirement from the administration in 1809. I then recieved from the Auditor, mr Harrison the following Note. ‘Mr Jefferson in his accounts as late minister to France, credited among other sums, a bill drawn by him on the 21st Octob. 1789. to the order of Grand &amp; co. on the bankers of the US. at Amsterdam for Banco f. 2800. equal with Agio to Currt florins 2870. and which was charged to him provisionally in the official statement made at the Treasury in the month of Octob. 1804. but as this bill has not yet been noticed in any account rendered by the bankers, the presumption is strong that it was never negociated or presented for payment, and mr Jefferson therefore appears justly entitled to recieve the value of it, which at 40. cents the gilder (the rate at which it was estimated in the above mentioned statement) amounts to Dollars 1148. Auditor’s office, Jan. 24. 1809.’  
Desirous of  leaving nothing unsettled behind me, I drew the money from the treasury, but without any interest, altho I had let it lie there 20. years, and had actually on that error paid 888.D. 67. cents an apparent balance against me, when the true balance was in my favor 259.D. 33. cents.   The question then is How has this happened? I have examined minutely and can state it clearly.  
Turning to my pocket Diary I find that on the 21st day of Octob. 1789. the date of this bill, I was at Cowes in England, on my return to the US. the entry in my Diary is in these words, ‘1789. Octob. 21. sent to Grand &amp; co. letter of credit on Willinks, Van Staphorsts and Hubbard for 2800. florins Banco.’ and I immediately charged myself with credited it in my account with the US. in the following words, ‘1789. Oct. 21. By my bill on Willinks, Van Staphorsts &amp; Hubbard in favor of Grand and co. for 2800. florins equal to 6250 livres–18 sous.’ my account having been kept in livres and sous of France, the Auditor settled this sum at the current exchange, making it 1148. Dollars. this bill, drawn at Cowes in England had to pass through London to Paris by the English and French mails, in which passage it was lost, by some unknown accident, to which it was the more exposed in the French mail, by the confusion then prevailing; for it was exactly at the time that Martial law was proclaimed at Paris, the country all up in arms, and executions by the mobs were daily perpetrated perpetrating thro’ town and country. however this may have been, the bill never got to the hands of Grand and co. was never, of course, forwarded by them to the bankers of Amsterdam, nor any thing more ever heard of it. the Auditor’s first conjecture then was the true one, that it never was negotiated, nor therefore charged to the US. in any of the bankers’ accounts. I have now under my eye a duplicate furnished me by Grand of his account of that date against the US. and his private account against myself, and I affirm that he has not noticed this bill in either of these accounts, and the Auditor assures us the Dutch bankers had never charged it.   The Sum of the whole then is that I drew a bill on the US. bankers, charged myself with it on the presumption it would be paid, that it never was paid however either by the bankers of the US. or any body else. it was surely just then to return me the money I had paid for it. yet the ‘Native Virginian’ thinks that this act of recieving back the money I had thus thro’ error overpaid ‘was a palpable and manifest act of moral turpitude, about which no two honest, impartial men can possibly differ.’ I ascribe these hard expressions to the ardor of his zeal for the public good, and as they contain neither argument nor proof, I pass them over without observation. indeed I have not been in the habit of noticing these morbid ejections of spleen either with or without the names of those venting them. but I have thought it a duty on the present occasion to relieve my cit fellow citizens &amp; my country from the degradation in the eyes of the world to which this informer is endeavoring to reduce it by representing it as governed hitherto by a succession of Swindlers and Peculators. nor shall I notice any further endeavors to prove or to palliate this palpable misinformation. I am too old and inert to undertake minute investigations of intricate transactions of the last century; and I am not afraid to trust to the justice and good sense of my fellow citizens on future, as on former attempts to lessen me in their esteem.  
I ask of you, gentlemen the insertion of this letter in your paper: and I trust that the printers who have hazarded the publication of the libel, on anonymous authority, will think that of the answer a moderate retribution of the wrong to which they have been accessory.

Messrs. Ritchie 8c Cooch :  
JI/onlicc//o, l\ïay 13 1822.  
I am thankful to you for the paper you have been  
so kind as to send me, containing the arraignment  
of the Presidents of the U. S. generally as pecula­  
tors or accessaries to peculation, by an informer who  
masks himself under the signature of&#x27;A Native of

(being his No. VI and the only No. I have seen) I  
had before read in the Federal Republican of Bal­  
timore of Aug. 28, which was sent to me by a friend  
With the real name of the author. It was published  
there during the ferment of a warmly contesied  
election. 1 considered it therefore as an election­  
eering manœuvre merely, and did not even think  
it required the trouble of recollecting, after a lapse  
of 33 years, the circumstances of the case in which  
lie charges me with having purloined from the  
treasury of the United States the sum of 1148  
dollars. But, as he has thought it worth repeating  
in his roll of informations against your Presidents  
aominally, 1 shall give the truths of the case, which  
he has omitted, perhaps because he did not know  
them and ventured too inconsiderately to supply  
them from his own conjectures.  
On the return from my mission to France, and  
joining the government here, in the spring of 1790,  
i had a long and heavy account to settle with the U  
p. ot the administration of their pecuniary a » alra  
in Europe, of which the super intendance had been]  
confided to me while there. I gave in my account |  
early, but the pressure of other business did not per­  
-«it the accounting officers to it till Oct. 10, 1792,(island  
when we settled, and a balance of 8888 67 appear­  
, I . i

shewn) l paid the money the same day delivered ;  
Up my vouchers, and received a certificate of  
But still the articles of my draughts on the bankers  
could be only provisionally past until their accounts i  
I .j/ 4 . , , . . , .. •  
so should be received tobe confronted with rnine i,i  
and it was not until the 24th of June 1804 that I  
reived a letter from Mr. Richard Harrison the  
audiior, informing; me, &#x27;that my accounts, as Min­  
. ister to Fi&#x27;anrr had hi»en adiimted and rinsed •* ad­

dmg,&#x27;the bill drawn und credited by you under  
date of the 21st October 1789, lor banco florins 2800,  
having never yet appeared in any account of the.  
Dutch bankers, stands at you: debit only a provi­  
film«/ charge. If it should hereafter turn out, as I  
iiirlin. .u , , - , , .  
mume to thmk it will, that thisbiil has never been  
negotiated or used by Mr. Grand, you will have a  
,/ust claim on the public for its value-.&#x27; This was j  
I  
  
the first Intimation to me that I had too hastily  
charged myself with that draft I determined,  
however, as I had allowed in my account, and paid  
up the balance it had produced against me, to let il  
remain awhile, as there was a possibility that the  
draft might still be presented by the holder to the  
bankers : and so it remained, till I was near leaving  
Washington on my final retirement from the ad­  
ministration in 1809. I then received fiom the  
Auditor, Mr. Harrison, the following note : &#x27;Mr  
Jefferson in his accounts as late minister to France,  
credited among other sums, a bill drawn by him  
on the 21st October 1789, to the order of Grand &amp;  
Co. on the bankers of the U. S. at Amste&#x27;dam for  
Banco f.2800 equal with Agio to Current florins  
2870, and which was charged to him provisionally  
in the official statement made at the Treasury in  
the month of October 1804 ; but as this bill has not  
yet been noticed in any account rendered by the  
bankers, the presumption is strong that it wasnever  
negotiated or presented for payment, and Mr. Jef­  
ferson therefore appears justly entitled to receive  
the value of it, which at 40 cents the guilder (the  
rate at which it was estimated in the above men  
tioned statement) amounts to 81148, Auditor&#x27;s Of­  
fice, Jan. 24, 1809.&#x27;  
Desirous of leaving nothing unsettled behind me,  
drew the money from the treasury, but without  
any interest, although I had let it lie there 20 years,  
and had actually on that error paid 888 dollars 67  
cents, an apparent balance against me, when the  
true balance was ih my favour 239 dollars 33 cents.  
The question then is, How has this happened? 1  
have examined minutely and can state it clearly.  
Turning to my pocket diary, I find that on the  
21st day of October, 1789. the date of this bill. 1  
was at Cowes in England, then on my return to the  
United States. The entry in my diary is in these  
words; 1789, Oct. 21, sent to Grand 5c Co. letter  
of credit on Willinks, Van Staphorsts and Hubbard  
lor 2800 florins banco and I immediately credi­  
ted it in my account with the United States in the  
following words: &#x27;1789. Oct. 21. By my bill on  
Willinks, Van Staphorsts and Hubbard in favour  
of Grand Sc Co- for 2800 florins, equal to 6250 livres.  
18 sous.&#x27; My account having been kept in livres Sc  
sous of France, the auditor settled this sum at the  
current exchange, making it 1148 dollars. This  
bill drawn at Cowes in F.ngland, had to pass through  
London to Paris by the English and French mails ;  
in which passage it was lost by some unknown ac­  
cident, to which it was the more exposed in the  
French mail, by the confusion then prevailing ; for,  
it was exactly at that time that martial law was  
proclaimed at Paris, the country all up in arms, and  
executions by the mobs were daily perpetrating  
through town and country. However this may have  
been, the bill never got to the,hands of Grand &amp; Co.;  
was never, of course, forwarded by them to the  
bunkers of Amsterdam, nor any thing more ever  
heard of it. Tiie aud tor&#x27;s first conjeciure then was  
the true one, that it never was negotiated, nor there­  
fore charged to the United States in any of the  
bankers&#x27;accounts. 1 have now under my eye a  
duplicate furnished me by Grand of his account of  
that date against the United States, and his private  
account against myself, and l affirm that he has not  
noticed this bill in either of these accounts, and the  
auditor assures us the Dutch bankers have never  
charged it.  
The sum of the whole then is, that 1 drew a bill  
on the United States bankers, charged my self&#x27;- ith  
it, on the presumption it would be paid; that i,  
never was paid, however, either by the bankers oi  
the United States, or any body else. It was surely  
just then, to return me the money I had paid lor it.,  
yet the &#x27;Native of Virginia&#x27; thinks that this act of  
receiving back the money I had thus, through error  
overpaid, was a patpabl ■ and man fest ac&#x27; of moral  
turpitude, about which no two honest, impartial men  
can possibly differ.&#x27; I ascribe these hard expressions  
to the ardor of his zeal for the public good, and as  
they contain neither argument nor proof, I pass  
them over without observation. IndeeJ I have not  
been in the habit of noticing these morbid ejections  
of spleen, either with or without the names of those  
venting them, but I have thought it a duty on the  
present occasion to relieve my fellow citizens and  
my country from the degradation in the eyes of the  
world, to which this informer is endeavouring to  
reduce it, by representing it as governed hitherto by  
a succession orswindlers and peculators, nor shall  
I notice any further endeavours to prove or palliate  
this palpable misinformation. I am too old and  
inert to undertake minute investigations of intricate  
transactions of the last century; and I am not afraid  
to trust to the justice and good sense of my fellow  
citizens on future as on former attempts to lessen  
me in their esteem.  
1 ask of you, gentlemen, the insertion of this let­  
ter in your paper: and 1 trust thtt the printers who  
have hazarded ihe publication of the libel, on anony­  
mous authority, will think that of the answer a  
moderate retribution of the wrong to which they  
have been accessory

Moniictllo, May 13 •

I am thankful to you fur the paper you &#x27;

United Slates generally, «• p-&#x27;cnUtors or

who masks him-eii under the signature of  
“ A Native of Virginia,” What relates to I  
myself io thi* paper, (being hi, No. VI ami 1  
the only number f have seen,) l had before I  
read in the Federal Republican of Baltimore j  
of August 2-&gt;, which was tent to me by a •  
friend, with the real name of the author, It  
wa* published there during the ferment of a  
warmiy contested election. ( considered  
it &#x27;heretoreas au electioneering nidmruvre  
merely, and did out even think it required  
the trouble of recollecting, after a lapse of  
d.J years,the circumstances of the case in  
which he charges me with having purloined

it worth repealing io lit* roll of informations j

give the truth, of the case, which he lias  
omitted, pethaps because he did not know  
them, ant ventur-d too inconsiderate&#x27;y to  
auppy them from his own conjectures.  
On the return from my mi«sion to Trance,  
and joining the government here, in the 1  
spring of IJdO, l had a long and heavy ac­  
count to settle with the Unit&#x27;d States, of

gave in my account early, but the pressure  
of other business did not permit the ac*  
counting officers to attend to it till October  
10, 1792, when we settled, and a balance of  
S 888 07 appearing to be due from me, (but  
erroneously as will be shewn) J paid the  
money the same day, delivered up my vouch*  
err, and received a certificate of it. hut  
still the articles of my draughts on the bunk*  
ers could be only ptoii.iionally pa-t, until  
I their account* also should be received to be  
| confronted with mine, and it was not till  
| the 24th of June |8C4, that l received a let.  
ter from Mr. Richard Harr iron, the audi  
&#x27; tor, iniormiug me “ that my account* a*  
minister to Fiance, had been adjusted and  
I clortd,&#x27;5 adding, “ the bill drawn and credit­

I turn cut, as 1 incline tu think it will, that  
I this bill has never been negotiated or used  
by Air. Grand, you will have a just claim on  
the public for its value.” This was the  
! lirst intimation to me that | had too hastily

account, and paid up the balance it had  
produced against me, to let it leinain a  
white as theie was a posibility that  
the draught might still be presented by  
toe holder to the bankers ; and so it remain­  
ed, till 1 was near leaving Washington on  
rny final retirement from the administration  
; in 1809. i then received from the Auditor,  
I Air. Harrison, to* following note; “ Air.

made at the&#x27;Treasury in the month of Oc­  
j tober, 180t—but, as this bill hat not yet  
been noticed m any account rendered by  
Ihe bankers, the presumption is strong that  
it was never negotiated or piesented for pay­  
ment, and Air. JutFreon therefore appears  
justly entitled to recuve the value ot ji,  
which, at 40 cents the guilder (the rale »i  
which it was estimated in the above men­

Moniscello, May 13, 1822,  
Meflrs RiTenie &amp; Goocu—lam thank  
ful to you for the paper you have been so  
kind a 3 to fend me, containing the arraign­  
ment of the Presidents of the United States,  
generally as peculators or acgeflaries to pec­  
ulation, by an informer who masks himfelf  
under the signature of * A Native of Vir­  
ginia.”” What relates to myfelf in this pa­  
per, (being his No VI and the only No  
I have seen) I had before read in the Fed­  
eral Republican of Baltimore, of Aug 28,  
which was sent to me by a friend with the  
real name of the author. 1t was publithed  
there during the fermeut of a warmly con.-  
tested ele@ion. I considered it therefore as  
an ele@ioneering manceuvre, merely, and  
did not even think 1t required the trouble  
of recolle&amp;ing, after alapfe of 33 years,  
the circumstances of the case in which he  
charges me with having purloined from the  
Treasury of the United States, the {um of  
1148 dollars. But, as he has thought 1t  
worth repeating in his roll of informations  
against your Presidents nominally, I shall  
give the truths of the cale, which he has  
omitted, perhaps because he did not know  
them, and ventured toe inconsiderately to  
supply them from his own conjetures.  
On the return from my miffon to France,  
and joining the government here, in the  
spring of 1790, I had a long and heavy ac:  
count to fettle with the U. S. of the ad­  
ministration of their pecuniary affairs in Eu­  
rope, of which the fuperintendance had been  
confided to me while there. 1 gavein my  
account early, but the preflure of other bufi  
nefs did not permit the accounting officer  
to attend to it till O&amp;ober 10, 1792. when  
we fettled, and a balance, of D 888 67 ap  
pearing to be due from me (but erroiieoufly  
as will be shown) I paid the money the  
fame day, delivered up my vouchers, and  
received a certiticate of it. But, still the  
articles of my draughts on the bankers  
could be only provifi-nally past, until their  
accounts also fhouid be received to be con  
fronted with mine, and it was not till the  
24th of June, 1804 that I received a letter  
from Mr. Richard Harrison the auditor in  
forming me, ¢ that my accounts, as Minis­  
ter to I&#x27;rance, had been adjusted and clos­  
ed ;’’ adding, ¢ the billdrawn and credited  
by you under date of the 21st of O&amp;ober,  
1789, for banco florins 2800, having never  
yet appeared in any account of the Dutch  
“bankers, stands at your debit only as a pro­  
oifional charge. If it should hereafter turn  
out, as I incline to think it will, that this  
bill has never been negotiated or used by  
Mr, Grand, you will have a just claim on  
the public for its value.”” This was the  
firft intimation to me that I Kad too hastily  
charged myfelf with that draught. I de.  
termined however, as I had allowed it in my  
account, and paid up the balance it had  
preduced against me, to let it remain a  
while, as there was a possibility that the  
draught might still be préfented by the hold­  
er to the bankers ; and so it remained, till  
I was near leaving Wathington on my final  
retirement from the administration of 1809.  
I thenreceived from the Auditor, Mr Har­  
rison the following note : * Mr. Jefferfon  
in his accounts as late minifler to France,  
credited, among other sums, a bill drawn by  
him onthe 21t O&amp;ober, 1789, to the order  
of Grand &amp; Co. on the bankers of the U.  
S. at Amsterdam for Banco f. 2800 equal  
with Agio to Current florins 2870, and  
which was charged to him prowifionally in  
the official statement made at the Treafary  
in the month of O&amp;ober. 1804 ; but as this  
bill has not yet been noticed in aay account  
rendered by the bankers, the presumption is  
strong that it was never negociated or pre­  
sented for payment, and Mr. Jefferfon there­  
fore appears justly entitled to receive the  
value of it, which at 40 cents the guilder,  
(the rate at which it was estimated in the a­  
bove mentioned statement) amounts to  
D 1148 Auditor’s Office, Jan. 24, 1809.”  
Desirous of leaving nothing unsettled be­  
hind me, I drew the money from the treafu.  
ry, but without any interefl, although I had  
let it be there 20 yean, and bad actnally on  
that error paid 888 dollars 67 cents, an ap­  
parent balance dgaish me, when the true  
balance was in my faror 259 dollars 38 cta.  
The question then is, how has this happen.  
&amp; L p A PR £y  
  
~ed? I bhave examined minutely and can  
| state it clearly,  
s Turning to my pocket dairy, I find that  
| on the 21t of O&amp;ober, 1789, the date of  
this bill, I was at Cowes in Englaud, on my  
return to the U. 8. The entry in my Dia­  
! ry is in thele words : ¢ 1789, O&amp;. 21, sent  
&#x27; to Grand &amp; Co. letter of credit on Wil.  
links, Van Staphorfts and Hubbard for  
2800 floring banco ;” and 1 immediately  
~credited it in my account with the U S. in  
the following words, « 1789. O&amp; 21 : By  
-y bill on Willinks, Van Staphorfts and  
- Hubbard in favor of Grand and Co for  
- 2800 florins equal to 6250 livres, 18 sous.”  
My account having been kept in livres and  
sous of France, the auditor fettled this sum  
at the curreot exchange, making it 1148  
dollars. This bill, drawn at Cowesin Eng.  
land, had to pafr through London to Paris  
by the English and French mails ; by which  
passage it was loft, by some unknown acci­  
deut, to which it was the more exposed in  
the French mail. by the cosfufion then pre­  
vailing ; for, it was exa&amp;lly at the time that  
martial law was proclaimed at” Paris, the  
country all up in arms, and executions by  
the mobs were daily perpetrating through  
town and country =~ However this may have  
been, the bili never got to the hands of  
Grand &amp; Co. ; was never, of course, for.  
warded by them to tha bankers of Amfter.  
dam, nor any thing more ever heard of it.—  
&quot;The auditor’s firft conje€ture then was the  
true ene, that it never was negotiated, nor  
therefore charged to the U. S. in any of  
the bankers” accounts. 1 bave now under  
my eye a duplicate furnifhed me by Grand |  
of his account of that date against the U. S.  
and his private account against myfelf, and  
I afficm that he has not noticed this biil in  
either of these accounts, and the auditor  
aflures us, the Dutch bankers had never  
charged it. ‘  
The sum of the whole then is, that I  
drew a bill on the U. S’. bankers, charging  
my{elf with it, on the presumption it would  
be paid ; that it never was paid, however,  
neither by the bankers of the U. S or any  
body else. Tt was surely just then, to re­  
turn me the money I had paid forit, yet  
the ¢ Native of Virginia’® thinks, that this  
a&amp; of receiving back the money I had thus,  
through error, overpaid, ¢ was a palpable  
and manifeft all of moral turpitude. about  
which no twe honefl. impartial men can pafi.  
bly differ. 1 alcribe these hard expreflions  
to the ardour of his zeal tor the public goed,  
and as they contain neither argument nor  
proof, I pass them over without observation.  
Indeed I have not been in the habit of no­  
ticing these morbid obje&amp;ions of {pleen,  
either with or without the mames of those  
venting them, but I have thought it a duty  
on the present accafion to relieve my fellow  
citizens and my country from the degrada.  
tion in the eyes of the world, to which  
this informer is endeavoring to reduce it,  
by representing i€ as governed hitherto  
by a succession of swindlers and pecula  
tors, nor shall I notice any turther en­  
deavours to prove or to palliate this pal.  
pable mifinformation. I am too old and  
inert to wundertake wminute investigations  
of intricate tranfa&amp;ions of the lalt century ;  
and I am wot afraid to trust to the justice  
and good sense of my fellow citizens on  
future as on former attempts to lessen me in  
their esteem.  
I ask of you, gentlemen the insertion of  
this letter in your paper ; and I trust that  
the printers who have hazarded the publi­  
cation of the libel, on anonymous authority,  
will think that of the answer a moderate re­  
tribution of the wrong to which they have  
been acceflory.  
; TH. JEFFERSON

(being bis No. VI and the only No. | have

pubiican of Baltimore of Aug. 28, which was  
sent 10 me Ly a friend with (he real nsme of

the ferment of a warmly contested elcction.  
~I consideied it therefoie as an electioneer­  
ing maruvie merely, and did not even (hink  
i requiied the trouble of recullecting, oficr @

case in which he charges me with hoving  
purloined fiom tbe Treasury of the United  
States the sum of 1148 dollars. But. as he  
has thought B worth repeating 1n his roll of  
information agamsi your Presidents nominal«  
ly, I shall give the truths of the case, which  
he has omitted, perhaps because he did not  
koow them ond ventured 100 inconsiderably to  
supply them from his own conjeciures.  
Ua the retwrn lrom my mission 10 Frence,

attend to it il Oct. 10, 1792, when he sot­  
ted, snd a balance of dis. 388 67 appesiin

tonally past, until chelr accounts also should  
be received w be confionted with mipe, and  
it was not wll the 24(h of June, 1804, hat 1

incline to think it will, that this bill has never  
been negociated or used by Mr. Grand, you  
will have a just claith on the pubdlic for its  
value.” This was the firsc intimation to me  
that J had too hastily charged myself with  
that dreught. 1 determined, however, as [  
had allowed it in my account, and paid up the  
balance 1t had produced against me, to let it  
remain a while, as there was a pussibiliry that«  
the draught might still be presented by the  
holder to the bankors : ané so it remained till  
I was near lesving Washingtun on my finsl  
retirement from the administration in 1809,  
I then received from the Auaitor, M:, Harrie  
son, the [ollowing note : « Mr¢. .J fferson in

ited, among uther sums, a Hill druwn by him

and Co. on the banke s of the U S. at Amse  
terdam for Banco £. 2800, equal with Agio,  
to Current florins 2870, eod which was  
charged to him fpirovisionally in the cofficial  
statement made at the 1’ easury in the month  
of Oct. 1804 ; but as this bill has not yet been  
noticed in any account lendered by the banke  
ers, the preaumption is strong that it wee  
never negociated or presented for payment,  
and Mr, Jefferson therefore appesrs justly en­  
titled 10 roccive the value of iy, which at 40  
cents the guilder, (the rate at which it was  
estimated in the above mentioncd 8 stement)  
amounts to 1148 dollars. Auduor’s Office,

Desirous of leaving nothing vosettled be«  
hind me, I drew the money fiom the Treasus  
ry, but without any interesty, slthough I hed  
let it be there 20 years, and had actually on  
that error peid 888 dollars 67 cents, an appar«
