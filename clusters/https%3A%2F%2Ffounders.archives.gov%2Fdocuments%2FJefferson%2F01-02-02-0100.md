. I do not doubt but before the receipt of this you will he[ar] of my late success against Governor Hamilton at post St. Vincenne. That gentleman with a body of men possessed himself of that post on the 15th. of December last repaired the fortifications for a repository and in the spring means to attack this place which he made no doubt of carrying, where he was to be joined by 200 Indians from Mechetemachinoi and 500 cherokees chiccasaws and other nations. With this body he was to penetrate up the Ohio to Fort Pitt, sweaping Kentuckey on his way having light brass Cannon for the purpose, joined on his way by all the Indians that could be got to him. He made no doubt but that he could force all West Augusta. This expedition was ordered by the commander in cheif of Canada. Destruction seemed to hover over us from every quarter detached parties of the Enemy in the neighbourhood every day but afraid to attack. I ordered Majr. Bowman to evacuate the fort at the Cohas and join me immediately which he did. Having not received a scrape of a pen from you for near twelve months I could see but little probability of keeping possession of the country as my number of men was too small [to] stand a seige and my situation too remote to call for assistance. I made all the preparations I possibly could for the attack and was necessitated to set fire to some of the houses in Town to clear them out of the way, but in the height of the hurry a Spanish merchant who had been at St. Vincenne arrived and gave the following intelligence. That Mr. Hamilton had weakened himself by sending his Indians against the Frontiers and to block up the Ohio; that he had not more than eighty men in garrison three pieces of Cannon and some swivils mounted that he intended to attack this place as soon as the winter opened and made no doubt of clearing the western waters by the fall. My situation and circumstances induced me to fall on the resolution of attacking him before he could collect his   Indians again. I was sensible the resolution was as desperate as my situation but I saw no other probability of securing the country. I immediately dispatched of a small galley which I had fitted up mounting two four pounders and four swivils with a company of men and necessary stores on board with orders to force her way if possible and station herself a few miles below the Enemy suffer nothing to pass her and wait for further orders. In the mean time I marched across the country with 130 men being all I could raise after leaving this place garrisoned by the militia. The inhabitants of the country behaved exceedingly well. Numbers of young men turned out on the expedition and every other one embodied to guard the different towns. I marched the 7th of February altho so small a body it took me 16 days on the route. The inclemency of the season high waters &amp;c. seemed to threaten the loss of the expedition. When within three leagues of the Enemy it took us five days to cross the drowned lands of the Wawbash river having to wade often upwards of two leagues to our breast in water. Had not the weather been warm we must have perished. But on the evening of the 23d we got on dry land in sight of the Enemy and at seven Oclock made the attack before they knew any thing of us. The Town immediately surrendered with joy and assisted in the seige. Th[ere] was a continual fire on both sides for eighteen hours. I had no expectation of gaining the fort until the arrival of my artillery. The moon setting about one oclock I had an intrenchment thrown up in rifle shot of their strongest battery and poured such showers of well directed balls into their post that we silenced two pieces of Cannon in 15 minutes without getting a man hurt. Governor Hamilton and myself had on the following day several conferences but did not agree until the evening when he agreed to surrender the garrison (79 in number) prisoners of war with considerable stores. I got only one man wounded not being able to lose many I made them secure themselves well. Seven badly wounded in the fort thro’ the ports. In the height of this action an Indian party that had been to war and taken two prisoners came in not knowing of us. Hearing of them I dispatched a party to give them battle in the commons and got nine of them with the two prisoners which proved to be Frenchmen. Hearing of a convoy of goods from Detroit I sent a party of 60 men in armed boats well mounted with swivils to meet them before they should receive any intelligence. They met the Convoy 40 leagues up the river and made a prize of the whole taking 40 prisoners and about £10,000 worth of goods and provisions also the mail from Canada to Governor Hamilton no news  of importance. But what crowned the general joy was the arrival of William Morris my express to you with your letters which gave general satisfaction. The Soldiery being made sensible of the gratitude of their country for their services were so much elated that they would have attempted the reduction of Detroit had I have ordered them. Having more prisoners than I knew what to do with I was necessitated to discharge a

A small army from Pittsburgh conducted with spirit may easily take Detroit and put an end to the Indian war. Those Indians who are active against us are the six nations part of the Shawnese the Meamonies and about half the chesaweys Ottawas Iowaa’s and Poutawatimas nations bordering on the Lakes. Those nations who have treated with me have behaved since very well to wit, the Peankishaws Kicapoues Oreaottenaws of the Waubash river, the Kaskias, Perrians Mechigamies, Foxes, Socks, opays Illinois and poues  nations of the Mississispi and Illinois rivers. Part of the chessaways have also treated and are peaceable. I continually keep agents among them to watch their motions and keep them peaceably inclined. Many of the cherokees chiccasaws and their confederates are I fear ill disposed. It would be well if Colo. Montgomery should give them a dressing as he comes down the Tenissee. There can be no peace expected from many nations while the English are at Detroit. I strongly suspect they will turn their arms against the Illinois as they

*¢ T don’t doubt but before the  
receipt of this, you will hear of  
my late enterprize againft Go-  
vernor Hamilton, at Poft St.  
  
Vincent. That gentleman, with  
  
a body of 600 men, Whites and  
  
Indians, poffeffed themfelves of  
  
that poft the 15th of December  
  
lait, repaired. the fortifications  
  
for a repofitory, and in the  
{pring intended to attack thispoft  
(which he made no doubt of  
carrying) where he was to be  
joined by 200 Indians from Me-  
chilimainoi, and 500 Cherokees  
and Chickafaws and other nati-  
ons. With this body he was to  
penetrate up the Ohio to Fort  
Pitt, fweeping Kentucket on  
his way, (having light brafs can-  
non for purpofe) joined on his  
way by all the Indians that  
could be got to him, he made  
no doubt, it feems, of forcing  
all Weft Auguita. This expe-  
dition was ordered by the Com-  
mander in Chief of Canada.  
Deftruction feemed to hover o-  
ver us fromevery quarter. De-  
tached parties from the enemy  
daily in the neighbourhood,  
but afraid to attack. I ordered  
Major Bowman to evacuate the  
fort at the Cahas, and join me  
immediately, which he did.  
Having not received a {crip of a  
pen from you for near twelve  
months, 1 could fee but little  
probability of keeping poffeffion  
ofthe country, as my number of  
men were too few to ftand a fiege,  
and my fituation too remote to  
call for affiftance. Imade all the  
preparations | poffibly could for  
the attack, and was under a ne-  
ceffity of fetting fire to fome of  
the houfes in town, to clear  
them out of the way. But in  
the height of the hurry a Span-  
ifh merchant that had been at  
St. Vincent, arrived, and gave  
the following intelligence, ‘That  
Mr. Hamilton had weakened  
himfelf by fending his indians a-  
gainft the frontiers, and to block  
up the Ohio ; that he had not  
more than 80 men in garrifon,  
  
three  
  
( 243 )  
  
three pieces of cannon and fome  
fwivels mounted; that he in-  
tended to attack this place as  
foon as winter opened, and  
made no doubt of clearing the  
Weftern waters by the fall. My  
fituation and circumftances oc-  
cafioned me to fall on that refo-  
lution of attacking him before  
he could have time to collect  
“his Indians again. I was fenfible  
that the refolution was as del-  
perate as my fituation was; but  
I faw no other probability of f{e-  
curing the country, | immedi-  
diately difpatched off a fmall gal-  
ley that | had fitted up, mount-  
ing two 4 pounders, and 4 fwi-  
vels, with a company of men  
and neceflary ftores on board,  
with orders to force her way if  
poffible, and ftation herfelf afew  
miles below the enemy, {uffer  
nothing to pafs her, and wait  
for further orders. In the mean  
time! marched acrofs the coun-  
try, with one hundred and thir-  
ty men, being all that] could  
raife, after leaving this place  
garrifoned by the militia.  
  
I marched the 7th of February  
and though fo {mall a body, it  
took me fixteen days on the  
route. ‘The inclemency of the  
feafon, high water, &amp;c. feemed  
to threaten the lofs of the expe-  
dition, whenwithin three leagues  
of the enemy. It coft us five  
days to qrofs the drowned lands  
of the Waubafh river, having to  
wade upwards of two leagues,  
often up to our breafts in water.  
But on the 23d we got on dry  
land, in fight of the enemy, and  
&#x27; at7 o’clock made the attack, be-  
fore they knew any thing of us.  
The town immediately furren-  
dered with joy, and affifted in  
the fiege. ‘There was a conti-  
  
nual fire on both fides for 18  
hours. J had no expeétation of  
gaining the fort, until the ar-  
rival of my artillery. JI had an  
intrenchment flung up in rifle-  
fhot of their ftrongeft battery,  
and poured ’in fuch fhowers of  
well-direéted balls into their  
potts, that we filenced two pieces  
of cannon in 15 minutes. Gov.  
Hamilton and myfelf had the fol-  
lowing day feveral conferences.  
In the evening he agreed to fur-  
render the garrifon prifoners of  
war, in the whole 79, with con-  
fiderable ftores. I got only one  
man wounded ; feven were bad-  
ly wounded in the fort. In the  
height of this action, an Indian  
party that had been to war, and  
taken two prifoners, came in,  
knowing nothing of us --hear-  
ing of them I fent a party to  
give them battle in the com-  
mons, and got nine of them,  
and the two prifoners. Hear-  
ing of a convoy of provifions and  
goods on their wayfrom Detroit,  
I fent a party of fixty men in  
armed boats, well mounted with  
fwivels, to meet them before  
they fhould receive any intelli-  
gence; they met the convoy 40  
leagues up the river, and made  
a prize of the whole, taking 40  
prifoners, and about ten thou-  
{and pounds worth of goods and  
provifions, alfo the mail from  
Canada to Gov, Hamilton, but  
no news of importance. But  
what crowned the joy of every  
perfon was the fefe arrival of W.  
Moires with your letters; the  
foldiery being made fenfible of  
the gratitude of their country  
for their fervices, were fo much  
elevated, that they would have  
attempted the reduétion of De-  
troit. had | ordered them.

 to Strengthen the prin­  
cipal point of d fence. When comparing his si­  
tuation. with that of the expected assailants,  
Clarke despaired of his ability to keep possessi­  
on of the country—Si ill, he was resolved to main­  
tain a sieve, ami preserve, at least, the post of  
Kaskaskias, or die in the attempt. To this end,

The same gentleman [Col. Vigo,] informed Col. Clark, that  
Gov. Hamilton had not more than eighty men in garrison, three  
pieces of cannon and some swivels mounted. Stimulated by this  
information, with the promptitude inspired by his eminent genius  
for war, our daring commander determined, in the opinion of the  
late John Randolph, like his most suitable prototype, the great  
Hannibal, to carry the war into the enemy’s country — as Clark

to Kaskaskia with prisoners, while a small  
garrison occupied Fort Patrick Henry, in  
Vincennes. Civil matters were also looked  
after; and then, on the twentieth of  
March, 1779, Clark “set out for Kaskas-  
  
kia by water, with a guard of eighty  
men,”  
  
Before the capture of Hamilton, and  
while in the Illinois towns, Clark had  
made peace with a number of Indian  
  
nations. ‘Those Indians,” he wrote,  
“who are active against us are the  
Six Nations [Senecas, or Mingoes, as  
they were usually called], part of the  
Shawanese, the Miamies, and about half  
of the Chippewas, Ottawas, Iowas and  
Pottawattamies, bordering on the lakes.  
Those nations who have treated with me  
have since behaved very well; they are  
the Piankeshaws, Kikapoos, Weatanons  
[Weas] of the Wabash river; the Kaskas-  
kias, Peorians, Mitchigamis, Sacs and  
Foxes, Iowas, Illinois and Pottawattamies  
of the Mississippi and Illinois rivers,’’  
  
* De Peyster to General Haldimand, March 8,  
1780—MS, letter : Haldimand Collection.

“Part of the Chippewas,” he added,  
“have also treated and are peaceable.  
I continually keep agents among them to  
watch their motions and keep them  
peaceably inclined. Many of the Chero-  
kees and Chickasaws are, I fear, ill dis-  
posed.”  
  
Clark: having succeeded so well in the  
Illinois towns and upon the Wabash,  
longed to be placed in condition as to men  
and supplies to march against Detroit.  
There can be no peace, he declared, ex-  
pected from many [Indian] nations while  
the English have possession of that post.  
It was, indeed, a part of his original plan  
to capture first the Illinois and then mov
