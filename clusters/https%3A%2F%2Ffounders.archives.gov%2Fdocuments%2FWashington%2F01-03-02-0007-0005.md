The rear of the French army having reached Philadelphia and the Americans having passed it—the Stores having got up &amp; every thing in a tolerable train here; I left this City for the head of Elk to hasten the Embarkation at that place and on my way—(at Chester)—received the agreeable news of the safe arrival of the Count de Grasse in the Bay of Chesapeake with 28 Sail of the line &amp; four frigates—with 3000 land Troops which were to be immediately debarked at James town &amp; form a junction with the American Army under the command of the Marqs. de la Fayette.

that the rest of the Troops should continue their march to Baltimore proceeding thence by Land, or Water according to circumstances. The Cavalry of Lauzen, with the Saddle horses &amp; such teams of both armies as the Qr. Masters thereof might judge necessary to go round by Land to the place of operation.  
Judging it highly expedient to be with the army in Virginia as soon as possible, to make the necessary arrangements for the Siege, &amp; to get the Materials prepared for it, I determined to set out for the Camp of the Marqs. de la Fayette without loss of time and accordingly in Company with the Count de Rochambeau who requested to attend me, and the Chevr. de Chastellu

“The want of water craft obliges part of the troops to march by land to Baltimore, and eventually as far as An[n]apolis. Many ox and horse teams are sent on by land, the General expecting to find little or no means of land transportation in Virginia.

While GW and his party were in Baltimore they stayed at Daniel Grant’s Fountain Inn. For a description of GW’s reception in Baltimore, see Md. Journal, 11 Sept. 1781. The address of welcome of the citizens of Baltimore to GW and his reply, both dated 8 Sept. 1781, are in DLC:GW. The address was presented to GW at a banquet held on the evening of 8 Sept. at Lindsey’s Coffeehouse in honor of the arrival of the French fleet (SCHARF [2]J. Thomas Scharf. The Chronicles of Baltimore; Being a Complete History of “Baltimore Town” and Baltimore City from the Earliest Period to the Present Time. Baltimore, 1874., 189–90).  
  
  
  
  
9th. I reached my own Seat at Mount Vernon (distant 120 Miles from the Hd. of Elk) where I staid till the 12th. and in three days afterwards that is on the 14th. reached Williamsburg. The necessity of seeing, &amp; agreeing upon a proper plan of cooperation with the Count de Grasse induced me to make him a visit at Cape Henry where he lay with his fleet after a partial engagement with the British Squadron off the Capes under the Command of Admiral Graves whom he had driven back to Sandy hook.

e Tucker states that GW reached the city about four o’clock in the afternoon. “He had passed our camp which is now in the rear of the whole army, before we had time to parade the militia. The French line had just time to form. The Continentals had more leisure. He approached without any pomp or parade attended only by a few horsemen and his own servants. The Count de Rochambeau and Gen. Hand with one or two more officers were with him. . . . The Marquis [de Lafayette] rode up with precipitation, clasped the General in his arms and embraced him with an ardor not easily described. The whole army and all the town were presently in motion. The General—at the request of the Marquis de St. Simon—rode through the French lines. The troops were paraded for the purpose and cut a most splendid figure. He then visited the Continental line” (St. George Tucker to Frances Tucker, 15 Sept. 1781, COLEMANMary Haldane Coleman. St. George Tucker: Citizen of No Mean City. Richmond, Va., 1938., 70–71). In Williamsburg, GW lodged at George Wythe’s house.

25th. Admiral de Barras having Joined the Count de Grasse with the Squadron and Transports from Rhode Island, &amp; the latter with some Frigates being sent to Baltimore for the remr. of the French army arrived this day at the usual port of debarkation  
  
above the College Creek and began to land the Troops from them.  
  
  
  
28th. Having debarked all the Troops and their Baggage—Marched and Encamped them in Front of the City and having with some difficulty obtained horses &amp; Waggons sufficient to move our field Artillery—Intrenching Tools &amp; such other articles as were indispensably necessary—we commenced our March for the Investiture of the Enemy at York.  
The American Continental, and French Troops formed one column on the left—the first in advance—the Militia composed the right column &amp; marched by the way of Harwoods Mill. Half a mile beyond the halfway Ho[use] the French &amp; Americans seperated. The former continued on the direct road to York, by the Brick House. The latter filed of to the right for Murfords bridge, where a junction with the Militia was to be made. About Noon the head of each column arrived at its ground, &amp; some of the enemys Picquets were driven in on the left by a Corps of French Troops, advanced for the purpose, which afforded an oppertunity of reconnoitering them on their right. The enemy’s Horse on the right were also obliged to retire from the ground they had Encamped on, &amp; from whence they were employed in reconnoitering the right column.  
The line being formed, all the Troops—Officers &amp; Men—lay upon their arms during the Night.  
  
  
Halfway House was operated as a tavern on the old Williamsburg Road and, as its name implies, was halfway between Williamsburg and Yorktown.  
  
  
The Brick House appears on a number of contemporary maps on the road between Williamsburg and Yorktown approximately four miles west of Yorktown and six miles east of Williamsburg, in York County.  
  
  
Murford’s Bridge crossed Skiffes Creek, which flows into the James River.  
  
  
  
  
29th. Moved the American Troops more to the right, and Encamped on the East side of Bever dam Creek, with a Morass in front, about Cannon shot from the enemys lines. Spent this day in reconnoitering the enemys position, &amp; determining upon a plan of attack &amp; approach which must be done without the assistance of Shipping above the Town as the Admiral (notwithstanding my earnest sollicitation) declined hazarding any Vessells on that Station.  
  
  
Beaver Dam Creek, or Great Run, is about halfway between Yorktown and Wormley Creek. The creek and its branches formed a marsh about the  
  
middle of the allied lines which stretched from the edge of the York River above Yorktown to Wormley Creek.  
  
  
  
  
30th. The Enemy abandoned all their exterior works, &amp; the position they had taken without the Town; &amp; retired within their Interior works of defence in the course of last Night—immediately upon which we possessed them, &amp; made those on our left (with a little alteration) very serviceable to us. We also began two inclosed Works on the right of Pidgeon Hill—between that &amp; the ravine above Mores Mill.  
From this time till the 6th. of October nothing occurred of Importance—much deligence was used in debarking, &amp; transporting the Stores—Cannon &amp;ca. from Trebells Landing (distant 6 Miles) on James Riv., to Camp; which for want of Teams went on heavily and in preparing Fascines, Gabions, &amp;ca. for the Siege—as also in reconnoitering the Enemys defences, &amp; their situation as perfectly as possible, to form our parallels &amp; mode of attack.  
The Teams which were sent round from the head of Elk, having arrived about this time, we were enabled to bring forward our heavy Artillery &amp; Stores with more convenience and dispatch and every thing being prepared for opening Trenches 1500 Fatiegue men &amp; 2800 to cover them, were ordered for this Service.

The opening of the siege can not be better described than in the  
words Washington himself records on the 28th:  
  
“ Having debarked all the troops and their baggage, marched and  
encamped them in front of the city, and having with some difficulty  
obtained horses and wagons sufficient to move our field artillery, intrench-  
ing tools and such other articles as were indispensably necessary, we  
commenced our march for the investiture at York. The American Con-  
tinentals and French troops formed one column on the left, the first in  
advance. The militia composed the right column, and marched by way  
of Harwood’s Mill. Half a mile beyond the Half Way House the  
French and Americans separated. The former continued on the direct  
road to York by the Brick House, the latter filed off to the right for  
Munford’s bridge, where a junction with the militia was to be made.  
About noon the head of each column arrived at its ground, and some  
of the enemy’s picquets were driven in on the left by a corps of French  
troops advanced ,for the purpose, which afforded an opportunity of  
reconnoitering them on their right. The enemy’s Horse on the right  
were also obliged to retire from the ground they had encamped on, and  
from whence they were employed in reconnoitering the right column.  
The line being formed, all the Troops, officers and men, lay upon their  
arms during the night.”  
  
On the 29th Washington moved the American troops more to the  
right, and encamped on the east side of Beaver Dam creek, with a morass  
in front about cannon shot from the enemy’s lines. He then spent the day  
in reconnoitering the enemy’s position and determining on a plan of  
attack and approach. On the 3oth he records that the “enemy abandoned

September 25th—Admiral de Barras  
having joined the Count de Grasse with  
the Squadron and Transports from  
Rhode Island, and the latter with some  
Frigates being sent to Baltimore for the  
remaindr of the French army, arrived this  
day at the usual port of debarkation  
above the College Creek, and began to  
land the Troops from them.

the Troops and their Baggage—marched  
—and encamped them in Front of the  
city—and having with some difficulty  
obtained horses and waggons sufficient

September 29th—Moved the American  
Troop more to the right, and Encamped  
on the East side of Be[a]ver dam Creek,  
with a morass in front about cannon  
shot from the enemy’s lines—Spent this  
day in reconnoitering the enemy’s posi-

without the assistance of shipping above  
the Town as the Admiral—(notwith-
