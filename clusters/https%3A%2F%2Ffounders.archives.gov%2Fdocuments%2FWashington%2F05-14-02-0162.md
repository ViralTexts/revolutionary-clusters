’d of the State of  
Things on this Side of the Atlantic, no one would have dar’d to adopt the Conduct which  
Mr Genest has pursued. In reading the few Gazettes which have reach’d me I am surprizd  
to see so little sound Intelligence.  
The present Government is evidently a Despotism both in Principle and Practice. The  
Convention now consists of ⟨on⟩ly a Part of those who were chosen to frame a  
Constitution. These after putting under Arrest their Fellows, claim all Power and have  
delegated the greater Part of it to a Committee of Safety—You will observe that one of the ordinary Measures of  
Government is to send out Commissioners with unlimited Authority. They are invested with  
Power to remove Officers chosen by the People and put others in their Place. This Power  
as well as that of imprisoning on Suspicion is liberally exercis’d. The revolutionary  
Tribunal establish’d here to judge on general Principles gives unlimited Scope to Will.  
It is an emphatical Phrase in Fashion among the Patriots that Terror  
is the order of the Day. Some Years have elapsed since Montesquieu wrote that the  
Principle of arbitrary Governments is Fear. The Queen was executed the Day before Yesterday. Insulted  
during her Trial and reviled in her last moments she behav’d with Dignity throughout.  
This Execution will I think give to future Hostilities a deeper Dye and unite more  
intimately the allied Powers. It will silence the Opposition of those who would not  
listen to the Dismembrement of this Country, and therefore it may be concluded that the  
Blow by which she died was directed from a Distance. But whatever may be the Lot of  
France in remote Futurity, and putting aside the military Events, it seems evident that  
she must soon be governd by a single Despot. Whether she will pass to that Point thro  
the Medium of a Triumvirate or other smaller Body of Men seems as yet undetermind. I  
think it most probable that she will. A great and awful Crisis seems to be near at Hand.  
A Blow is I am told meditated which will shroud in Grief and Horror a guilty Land.  
Already the Prisons are surcharg’d with Persons who consider themselves as Victims.
