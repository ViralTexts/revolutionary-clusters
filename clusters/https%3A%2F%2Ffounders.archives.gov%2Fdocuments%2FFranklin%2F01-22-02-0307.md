 the commissioners; that, very unfortunately, a long passage prevented his arriving here before the declaration of independence took place.. . . I told him he had now a fair opportunity to mention to his friend Dr. Franklin, in a private letter, his design in coming out, and what his expectations from America were. This he declined; saying the doctor had grown too warm, and if he expressed his sentiments fully to him, he should only give him pain, which he would wish to avoid.”  
  
My Lord,  
Philada. July 20th. 1776.  
I received safe the Letters your Lordship so kindly forwarded to me, and beg you to accept my Thanks.  
The Official Dispatches to which you refer me, contain nothing more than what we had seen in the Act of Parliament, viz. Offers of Pardon upon Submission; which I was sorry to find, as it must give your Lordship Pain to be sent so far on so hopeless a Business.  
Directing Pardons to be offered the Colonies, who are the very Parties injured, expresses indeed that Opinion of our Ignorance, Baseness, and Insensibility which your uninform’d and proud Nation has long been pleased to entertain of us; but it can have no other Effect than that of increasing our Resentment. It is impossible we should think of Submission to a Government, that has with the most wanton Barbarity and Cruelty, burnt our defenceless Towns in the midst of Winter, excited the Savages to massacre our Farmers, and our Slaves to murder their Masters, and is even now bringing foreign Mercenaries to deluge our Settlements with Blood. These atrocious Injuries have extinguished every remaining Spark of Affection for that Parent Country we once held so dear: But were it possible for us to forget and forgive them, it is not possible for you (I mean the British Nation) to forgive the People you have so heavily injured; you can never confide again in those as Fellow Subjects, and permit them to enjoy equal Freedom, to whom you know you have given such just Cause of lasting Enmity. And this must impel you, were we again under your Government, to endeavour the breaking our Sprit by the severest Tyranny, and obstructing by every means in your Power our growing Strength and Prosperity.  
  
But your Lordship mentions “the Kings paternal Solicitude for promoting the Establishment of lasting Peace and Union with the Colonies.” If by Peace is here meant, a Peace to be entered into between Britain and America as distinct States now at War, and his Majesty has given your Lordship Powers to treat with us of such a Peace, I may venture to say, tho’ without Authority, that I think a Treaty for that purpose not yet quite impracticable, before we enter into Foreign Alliances. But I am persuaded you have no such Powers. Your Nation, tho’ by punishing those American Governors who have created and fomented the Discord, rebuilding our burnt Towns, and repairing as far as possible the Mischiefs done us, She might yet recover a great Share of our Regard and the greatest part of our growing Commerce, with all the Advantage of that additional Strength to be derived from a Friendship with us; I know too well her abounding Pride and deficient Wisdom, to believe she will ever take such Salutary Measures. Her Fondness for Conquest as a Warlike Nation, her Lust of Dominion as an Ambitious one, and her Thirst for a gainful Monopoly as a Commercial one, (none of them legitimate Causes of War) will all join to hide from her Eyes every View of her true Interests; and continually goad her on in these ruinous distant Expeditions, so destructive both of Lives and Treasure, that must prove as perrnicious to her in the End as the Croisades formerly were to most of the Nations of Europe.   
I have not the Vanity, my Lord, to think of intimidating by thus predicting the Effects of this War; for I know it will in England have the Fate of all my former Predictions, not to be believed till the Event shall verify it.  
Long did I endeavour with unfeigned and unwearied Zeal, to preserve from breaking, that fine and noble China Vase the British Empire: for I knew that being once broken, the separate Parts could not retain even their Share of the Strength or Value that existed in the Whole, and that a perfect Re-Union of those Parts could scarce even be hoped for. Your Lordship may possibly remember the Tears of Joy that wet my Cheek, when, at your good Sister’s in London, you once gave me Expectations that a Reconciliation might soon take place. I had the Misfortune to find those Expectations disappointed, and to be treated as the Cause of the Mischief I was labouring to prevent. My Consolation under that groundless and malevolent Treatment was, that I retained the Friendship of many Wise and Good Men in that Country, and among the rest some Share in the Regard of Lord Howe.  
The well founded Esteem, and permit me to say Affection, which I shall always have for your Lordship, makes it painful to me to see you engag’d in conducting a War, the great Ground of which, as expressed in your Letter, is, “the Necessity of preventing the American Trade from passing into foreign Channels.” To me it seems that neither the obtaining or retaining of any Trade, how valuable soever, is an Object for which Men may justly Spill each others Blood; that the true and sure means of extending and securing Commerce is the goodness and cheapness of Commodities; and that the profits of no Trade can ever be equal to the Expence of compelling it, and of holding it, by Fleets and Armies. I consider this War against us therefore, as both unjust, and unwise; and I am persuaded cool dispassionate Posterity will condemn to Infamy those who advised it; and that even Success will not save from some degree of Dishonour, those who voluntarily engag’d to conduct it. I know your great Motive in coming hither was the Hope of being instrumental in a Reconciliation; and I believe when you find that impossible on any Terms given you to propose, you will relinquish so odious a Command, and return to a more honourable private Station. With the greatest and most sincere Respect I have the honour to be, My Lord your Lordships most obedient humble Servant  
B Franklin  
honble. Lord How

it muft give your Lordship pain to be

Direéting pardons to be offered to  
the colonies,+who are the very parties  
injured, expreffes indeed that opinion

of our ignorance, bafenefs, and infen-  
fibility, which your uninformed and  
proud nation has long been pleafed to  
entertain of us; but it can have no o-  
ther effeét than that of increafing our re-  
fentments. It is impoflible we fhould  
think of fubmiffion to a Government  
that has, with the moft wanton barba-  
rity and cruelty, burnt our defencelefs  
towns, in the midft of winter; excited  
the favages to maffacre our peaceful  
farmers, and our flaves to murder their  
mafters ; and is even now bringing  
foreign mercenaries to deluge our fet-  
tlements with blood. Thefe atroci-  
ous injuries have extinguifhed every  
fpark of affection for that parent-  
country we once held fo dear: but  
were it poflible for us to forget and .  
forgive them, it is not poffible for  
you, I mean the Britifh nation, to for-  
give the people you have fo heavily in-  
jured : you can never confide again in  
thofe as fellow-fubjects, and permit  
them to enjoy equal freedom, to whom,  
you know, you have given fuch juft  
caufes of lafting enmity ; and this  
mutt impel you, were we again under  
your government, to endeavour the  
breaking our fpirit, by the fevereft ty-  
ranny, and obitruéting, by every means.  
in your power, our growing ftrength  
and profperity.  
  
But your Lordfhip mentions the  
King’s paternal folicitude for promo-  
ting the eftablifhment of lafting peace  
and union with the colonies. If by  
peace is here meant a peace to be enter-  
ed into by diftinct ftates, now at war,  
and his Majefty has given your Lord-  
fhip power to treat with us of fuch a  
peace, I may venture to fay, though  
without authority, that I think a treaty  
for that purpofe not quite imprattica-  
ble, before we enter into foreign alli-  
ances: but I am perfuaded you have  
nofuch powers. Your nation, though  
by punifhing thofe American Gover-  
nors who have fomented the difcord,  
rebuilding our burnt towns, and re-  
pairing, as far as poflible, the mifchief  
done us, fhe might recover a great fhare  
of our regard, and the greatett fhare of  
our growing commerce, with all the  
advantages of that additional ftrength  
to be derived from a friendfhip with  
us ; yet I know too well her abound-  
ing pride, and deficient wifdom, te  
believe the will ever take fuch falutary

commercial one, (none of them legiti-  
mate caufes of war,) will all join to  
hide from her eyes every view of her  
true intereft, and will continually goad  
her on, in thefe ruinous, diftant expe-  
ditions, fo deftruétive both of lives,  
and of treafure, that they muf prove as  
pernicious to.her in the end, as the  
Croifades formerly were to moft of the  
nations of Europe.  
  
I have not the vanity, my Lord, to  
think of intimidating, by thus prediét-  
ing the effects of this war; for I know  
it will in England have the fate of all  
my former prediétions, not to be belie-  
ved, till the event fhall verify it.  
  
Long did I endeavour, with un-  
feigned and unwearied zeal, to preferve  
from breaking that fine and noble  
china vafe~the Britih empire; for  
1 know, that, being once broken, the  
feparate parts could not retain even  
their thares of the ftrength and value  
that exifted in the whole; and that a  
perfeét re-union of thefe parts could  
fcarce ever be hoped for. Your Lord  
fhip may poflibly remember the tears  
of joy that wet my cheek, when, at  
your good fifter’s, in London, you  
once gave me expectations that a recon-  
ciliation might foon take place. I had  
  
~ the misfortune to find thefe expectations  
difappointed, and to be treated as the  
caule of the mifchief I was labouring to  
  
prevent. My confolation under that  
groundlefs and malevolent treatment  
was, that I retained the friendfhip of  
many wife and good men in that coun-  
try, and, among the reft, fome fhare in  
the regard of Lord Howe.  
  
The well-founded efteem, and, per-  
mit me to fay, affe&amp;tion, which I fhall  
always have for your Lordfhip, make  
it painful for me to fee you engaged in  
conducting a war, the great ground of  
which, a@ defcribed in your letter, is  
  
\ the neceflity of preventing the Ameri-  
can trade from pafling into foreign  
channels: to me it feems that neither  
the obtaining nor retaining any trade,  
how valuable foever, is an object for  
which men may juftly fpiil each other’s  
blood ; that the true and fure means of  
extending and fecuring commerce, are  
the goodnefs and cheapnefs of commo-  
dities ; and that the profits of no trade  
can ever be equal to the expence of  
compelling it, and holding it by fleets  
and armies. I confider this war againit  
ue, therefore, as both unjuft and un-  
wife ; and I am perfuaded that cool and  
d-fpaffionate potterity will condemn to  
infamy thofe who advifed it ; and that  
  
Dr, Franklin’s Anfwer to Lord Howe. ~  
  
even fuccefs will not fave from fome  
degree of difhonour thofe who have vo-  
luntarily engaged to condué&amp; it.  
  
I know your great motive in coming  
hither was the hope of being inftrue  
mental in a reconciliation ; and bee  
lieve, when you find that to.be impofhi-  
ble, on any terms given you to pro-  
pofe, you will relinquith fo odious a  
command, and return to a more ho-  
nourable private ftation.

ANS by ER,  
Philadelphia, July 30, 1776.  
Received Piafe Sas’ Baber your  
  
lordthip fo kindly forwarded to  
  
me, and beg you to accept my thanks,  
‘The official difpatches, to which  
  
you refer me, contain nothing more  
  
‘than what we had feen in the att of  
  
arta. viz. offers of pardon on  
ubmiffion ; which I was forry to find,  
as it mufl give your lordfhip pain to  
pte fo far on fo hopelefs a buli-  
nefs.  
  
Dire@ing pardons to be offered to  
the colonies, who ate the very par-  
ties injured, exprefles indeed that o-  
  
ion of dur ignorance, bafenefs, and  
infenfibility, which your uninformed  
and proud nation has long been pleaf-  
ed to entertain of us; but it can  
have no other effeét than that of in-  
créafing our refentments, It is impoffi&lt;  
ble we fhould think of fubmiffion toa  
government that has, with the molt  
wanton barbarity and cruelty, burnt  
out defencelefs towns in the midh o  
winter, excited the favages to maffa-  
cre our peaceful farmers, and our  
flaves to murder their mafters ; and  
is even now fending fereign mercena-  
ries todeluge our country with blood.  
Thefe atrocious injuries have extin-  
gaint every {park of affettion for  
that parent country we once held fo  
dear: but, were it pofhble for us to  
forget and forgive them, it is not pof-  
fible for vou, } mean the Britifh na-  
tion, to forgive the people you have  
fo heavily injured; you can never  
confide again in thofe as fellow fub-  
jefts, and permit them to enjoy equal  
fréedom, to whom, you know. vou  
have given fuch juft caufes of laiting  
enmity; and this muft impel you,  
were we again under your govern-  
ment, to endeavour the breaking our  
fpirit, by the fevereft tyranny, and  
obftruéting, by every means in your  
power, our socing teengh and prof-  
perity.  
  
But your lordfhip mtentions ‘* the  
king’s paternal folicitude for promot-  
ing the eftablifhment of laiting peace

peace is here meant a peace to be en-  
tered into by diftinét flates, now at

lordthip power to treat with us for  
fuch a peace, I may venture to fay,

tion, though by punithing thofe A-  
merican governors who have fomented  
the difcord, rebuilding our burnttowns,  
and repairing, as far as poilible, the  
mifchief done us, fhe might recover  
a great {hare of our regard, and the  
greatelt fhare of our growing com-  
merce, with alk the advantages of that  
additional ftrength to be deuved from  
a friendfhip with us: yet I know too  
well herabounding pride, and defici-  
ent wifdom, to beheve the will ever  
take fuch falutary meafures. Her  
fondnefs for conqueft, as a warlike  
nation—her Juft for dominion, as an  
ambitious one—and her thirft for a  
gainful monopoly, as a commercial  
one—(none of them legitimate caufes  
of war)—will all join to hide from her  
eyes every view of her true intereft,  
and will continually goad her on in  
thefe ruinous, diftant expeditions, fo  
deflructive both of lives and of trea-  
fure, that they muft prove as pernici-  
ous to her in the end, as. the croi-  
fades formerly were to moft of she na-

Long did I endeavour, with un-

ferve from breaking that fine and no-  
ble china vafe—the Britith empire ;  
for I know, that being once broken,  
the feparate parts could not retain  
eventheir fhares of the flrength and  
value that exifted in the whole ; and  
that a perfeét re-union of thofe parts  
could fcarce ever be hopedfor, Your  
lord{hip. may poflibly remember the  
tears of joy which wet my cheeks,  
when at your good fifter’s in London,

I received fafe the letters your Lordfhip fo kindly forwarded to me,

yeur Lordthip pain to be fent fo far on fo hopelefs a bufinefs.  
  
Dire&amp;ing pardons to be offered to the colonies, who are the very  
perties injured, expreffes indeed that opinion of our ignorance, bafenefs,  
and infenfibility, which your uninformed and proud nation has long  
been pleafed to entertain of us; but it can have no other effeét than  
that of increafing our refentments.—It is impofflible we fhould think of  
{ubmiffion to a government that has, with he motft wanton barbarity  
and cruelty, burned our defencelefs towns in the midft of winter; ex-  
cited the favages to maflacre our (peaceful) farmers ; and our flaves to  
murder their mxvters; and is even now * bringing foreign mercenaries  
to deluge our fettlements with blood. ‘Thefe atrocious injuries have  
extinguifhed every {park of affection for that parent country we once  
held fo dear: but, were it poflible fur us to forget and forgive them,  
tis not poffible for you (I mean the Britifh nation) to forgive the peo-  
ple you have fo heavily injured ; you can never confide again in thofe  
1s fellow-fub jets, and permit them to enjoy ¢ gual freedom, to whom

breaking our fpirit by the fevereft tyranny, and obitruting, by every  
means ip your power, our growing ftrength and profperity.  
  
‘ But your Lordfhip mentions “ the King’s paternal folicitude for  
promoting the eltablifhment of lafting peace and union with the Coio-  
nies.’ If by peace is here meant, a peace to be entered into by diftiné  
ftates, now at war; and his Majefty has given your Lordthip powers to  
treat with us of fuch a peace; I may venture to fay, though without  
authority, that I think a treaty for that purpofe not quite impraéticable,  
before we enter into foreign alliances. But 1 am perfuaded you have  
no fuch powers. Your nation, though, by punithing thofe American  
governors who have fomented the difcord, rebuilding our burnt towns,  
and repairing as far as poflible the mifchiefs done us, fhe might recover  
a great fhare of our regard ; and the greateft fhare of our growing com-  
merce, with all the advantages of that additional ftrength, to be derived  
from a friendfhip with us; yet I know too well her abounding pride  
and deficient wifdom, to believe fhe will ever take fuch falut tary mea-  
fures. Her fondnefs for conqueft as a warlike nation ; her lutt of do-,  
minion as an~ambitious one ; and her thirft for a gainful monopoly as a  
commercial one (none of them legitimate caufes of war), will join to  
hide from her eyes every view of her true intereft, and continually goad  
her on in thefe ruinous diftant expeditions, fo deftrudiive both of lives  
and of treafure, that they muft prove as pernicious to her in the end, as  
the Croifades formerly were to moft of the nations of Europe.  
  
I have not the vanity, my Lord, to think of intimidating, by thus  
predicting the effects of this war; for I know it will in England have  
the fate of all my former predictions ; not to be believed till the event  
fhall verify it.  
  
‘ Long did I endeavour, with unfeigned and unwearied zeal, to pre-  
ferve from breaking that fine and noble porcelain vafe—the Britifh em-  
pire; for | knew that, being once broken, the feparate parts could no  
retain even their /here of the flrength and value that exilted in the  
whole ; and that a perfe&amp;t reunion of thofe parts could fearce ever be hoped  
for. Your Lordthip may poffibly remember the tears of joy that wet-  
ted my cheek, when, at your good fifter’s in London, you once gave  
me expectations that a ciealiadion might foon take place. 1 had the  
misfortune to find thefe expectations dilappointed, and to be treated as  
the caufe of the mifchief I was labouring to prevent. My confulation  
under that groundlefs and malevolent treatment was, that J retained the  
friendfhip of many wife and good men in that country ; and, among the  
refl, fome fhare in the reg send of Lord Howe.  
  
‘ The well-founded oft em, and, permit me to fay, affeétion, which  
I fhall always have for your Lordfhip, make it painful to me to fe  
you engaged in conduéting a war, the great ground of which (as de-  
{cribed in your letter) is “ the neceffity of preventing the American  
trade from palling into foreign channels.” ‘To me it feems, that neither  
the obtaining or retaining any trade, how valuable mene, is an object  
for which men may juftly fpill each other’s blood; tha t the tru

cheapnefs of commodities ; and that the profits of no tratle can ever be  
equal to the expence of compelling it, and holding it by fleets and ar-

demn to infamy thofe who advifed it; and that even fuccefs will not

inftrumertal in a reconciliation ; and I believe, when you find that to

Rid THE NATIONAL REGISTER.  
  
“ The official despatches to which you refer  
me, contain nothing more than what we had seen  
in the act of parliament ; ‘viz. ‘Offers of pardon  
upon submission ;” which I am sorry to find, as it  
must give your lordship pain, to be sent so far on  
  
so hopeless a business.  
  
“ Directing pardons to be offered to the colo-  
nies, who are the very parties injured, expresses  
indeed, that opinion of our ignorance, baseness  
and insensibility, which your uniformed arsl  
  
proud nation has long been pleased to entertain  
  
of us; but it can have no other effect than that  
  
of increasing our resentments. It is impossible  
  
we should think of submission, to a government  
  
that has, with the most wanton barbarity and  
crue&#x27;ty, burned our defenceless towns in the  
midst of winter : excited the Savages ty massacre  
  
our peaceful farmers, and our slaves to murder  
  
their masters ; and is even now bringing foreign  
mercenaries to deluge our settlement with blood.  
These «trociousinjuries have extinguished every  
spark of affection for that parent country, that  
we once held so dear; but were it possible for  
us to forget and forgive them, it is not possible  
for you, I mean the Briltsh nation, to forgive the  
people you have so heavily injured.  
never confide again in those, as fellow subjects,  
and permit them to enjoy ejual freedom, to  
whom you know you have given such just causes  
of lasting enmity ; and this must impel you, were  
we again under your government, to endeavor  
to break our spirit by the severest tyranny, and  
obstructing by every means in your power, our  
growing strength and prosperity.  
  
“ Your lordship mentions “ the king’s paternal  
solicitude for promoting the establishment of last-  
ing peace and union with the colonies.” If, by peace,

¢inct states, now at war, and his majesty has given  
your lordship powers to treat with us, of such a  
peace, I may venture to say, though without au-  
thority, that I think a treaty for that purpose not  
quite impracticable, before we enter into foreign  
alliances : but I am persuaded you have no such

American governors, who have fomented the dis-

advantages of that additional sivength to be deriv

her abounding pride and deficient wisdom, to be-  
lieve she will ever take such salutary measures.

I had the misfortune to find these expectat e.

tion, under that groundless and malevolent treat.  
ment, was that I retained the friendship of ma c

the rest, some shure in the regard of lord Howe

therefore, as both unjust and unwise ; and I am  
persuaded that cool and dispassionate posterity  
will condemn to infamy those who advised it ; and  
that even success will not save from some degree  
of dishonor those who have voluntarily engaged  
to conduct it.

your good sister’s, in London, you once gave me expectations  
that a reconciliation might soon take place. I had the misfor-

‘* The well-founded esteem, and, permit me to say, affection,

to me to see you engaged in conducting a war, the great ground  
of which, as expressed in your letter, is ‘ the necessity of pre-  
venting the American trade from passing into foreign channels.’  
To me it seems, that neither the obtaining nor retaining of any  
trade, how valuable soever, is an object for which men may  
justly spill each other’s blood; that the true and sure means of  
extending and pen vi commerce is the goodness and cheap-

equal to the expense of compelling it, and of holding it, by fleets

&quot; Directing pardons to., be . offered to the

expresses indeed that opiuion of our ignor­  
ance, baseness, and insensibility, which your  
uninformed and proud nation has long been  
pleased to ent? rtain of us ; but it can have no  
Other effect than that of increasing our resent  
ments. It is impossible we should think of  
submission to a government that has with the  
&quot;most wanton barbarity and cruelty, burned  
our defenceless towns in the midst of winter;  
excited the savages to massacre our (peaceful)  
farmers ; and onr slaves to murder their mas­  
ters; and is even now bringing foreign mer­  
cenaries to deluge our settlements with blood.  
Thiese&quot;atrocious injuries have extinguished  
every spark of affection for tLat parent coun­  
try we once held so defir ; but, were it pos­  
sible for to forget and forgive them, it is  
not possible for yon (I mean the British na­

and this must impel you, were we again un­  
der your government, to endeavour the break  
ing our spirit by the severest tyranny, and  
obstructing, by every means in your power,  
our growing strength and prosperity.  
L But your Lordship mentions &quot; the King&#x27;s  
paternal solicitude for promoting the estab­  
lishment of lasting peace and union with the  
Colonies.&quot; If by pecct is here meant, a peace  
to be eutertainei into by distinct states, now  
at&#x27; war; and &#x27;lis Majesty has given your Lord­

I may venture to say, though without author­

quite impracticable, before we enter intoforeign  
alliances. But I am persuaded yro  
have no such powers. Yoyr nation, though,  
by punishing those American governors who  
have fomented the discord, rebuilding our  
burnt towns, and repairing as far as possible  
the mischiefs done us, he might recover  
great share of our regard, . and the greatest  
share of our growing commerce, with all the  
advantages of that additional strength to be  
derived frojn a .friendship with us ; yet  
know too well her abounding pride and de­

euch.salurary measures. Her fondness for  
cjnquest its ft warlike nation ; her lust of do­  
minion as an ambitious one; and her thirst

(none of them legitimataeawies of war), will  
join to hide fiora Ur.iyes erery wiew of Iter

‘* Philadelphia, July 30, 1776.  
  
*‘T received safe the letters your Lordship so  
kindly forwarded to me, and beg you to receive  
my thanks.  
  
‘¢ The official dispatches to which you refer me,  
contain nothing more than what we had seen in  
the act of Parliament, viz.: Offers of pardon upon  
submission ; which I was sorry to find, as it must  
give your Lordship pain to be sent so far on so  
hopeless a business.  
  
‘« Directing pardons to be offered to the Colo-  
nies who are the very parties injured, expresses in-  
deed that opinion of our ignorance, baseness and  
insensibility, which your uninformed and proud  
nation has long been pleased to entertain of us; but  
it can have no other effect than that of increasing  
our resentments. It is impossible we should think  
of submission to a government that has, with the  
most wanton barbarity and cruelty, burnt our de-  
fenceless towns, in the midst of winter, excited  
the savages to massacre our peaceful farmers, and  
our slaves to murder their masters ; and iseven now  
bringing foreign mercenaries to deluge our settle-  
ments with blood.  
  
‘*These atrocious injuries have extinguished  
every spark of affection for that parent country  
we once held so dear ; but were it possible for us  
to forget and forgive them, it is not possible for  
you, I mean the British nation, to forgive the peo-  
ple you have so heavily injured; you can never  
confide again in those as fellow-subjects, and per-  
mit them to enjoy equal freedom, to whom, you  
know, you have given such just causes of lasting  
enmity ; and this must impel you, were we again  
under your government, to endeavour the breaking  
our spirit, by the severest tyranny, and obstruct-  
ing, by every means in your power, our growing  
strength and prosperity.  
  
‘*But your Lordship mentions ‘‘ the King’s pa-  
ternal solicitude for promoting the establishment  
of lasting peace and union with the Colonies.’  
If a peace is here meant a peace to be entered into  
by distinct States, now at war, and his Majesty has  
given your Lordship power to treat with us of  
such a peace, I may venture to say, though with-  
out authority, that I think a treaty for that pur-  
pose not quite impracticable, before we enter into  
  
  
  
foreign alliances ; but I am persuaded you have no  
such powers.  
  
‘* Your nation, though by punishing those Amer-  
ican Governors who have fomented the discord,  
rebuilding our burnt towns, and repairing, as far  
as possible, the mischief done us, she might re-  
cover a great share of our regard, and the  
greatest share of our growing commerce, with  
all the advantages of that additional strengih,  
to be derived from a friendship with us; yet I  
know too well her abounding pride, and deficient  
wisdom, to believe, she will ever take such saiu-  
tary measures. Her fondness for conquest, as a  
warlike nation ; her lust of dominion, as an ambi-  
tious one ; and her thirst for a gainful monopoly,  
as a commercial one (none of them legitimate  
causes of war), will all join to hide from her eyes  
every view of her true interest, and will continu-  
ally goad her on, in these ruinous, distant expedi-  
tions, so destructive both of lives and of treasure,  
that they must prove as pernicious to her in the  
end, as the Crusades formerly were to most of the  
nations of Europe.’’ I have not the vanity, my  
Lord, to think of intimidating, by thus predicting  
the effects of this war; for I know it will in Eng-  
land have the fate of all my former predictions,  
not to be believed, till the event shall verify it.  
Long did I endeavour with unfeigned and unwea-  
ried zeal, to preserve from breaking that fine and  
noble China vase—the British empire ; for I know,  
that being once broken, the separate parts could  
not retain even their shares of the strength and  
value that existed in the whole; and that a per-  
fect reunion of these parts could scarce ever be  
hoped for. Your Lordship may possibly remem-  
ber the tears of joy that wet my cheek, when at  
your good sister’s, in London, you once gave me  
expectations that a reconciliation might soon take  
place. I had the misfortune to find these expec-  
tations disappointed, and to be treated as the cause  
of the mischief I was labouring to prevent. My  
consolation under that groundless and malevolent  
treatment was, that I retained the friendship of many  
wise and good men in that country, and, among  
the rest, some share in the regard of Lord Howe.  
  
‘* The well founded esteem, and, permit me to  
say, affection, which I shall always have for your  
Lordship, make it painful for me to see you en-  
gaged in conducting a war, the great ground of  
which, as described in your letter, is ‘the necessity  
of preventing the American trade from passing  
into foreign channels ;’ tome it seems that neither  
the obtaining nor retaining any trade, how valua-  
ble soever, is an object for which men may justly  
spill each other’s blood ; that the true and sure  
means of extending and securing commerce, are  
the goodness and cheapness of commodities ; and

ve been by them declared to be  
treasonable, and one gentleman at  
least, Edward Atkinson, has been called  
a traitor for sending such extracts  
through the mails. However, &quot;men are  
known by the company they keep.” and  
one had better be called a &quot;traitor&quot;  
along with Benjamin Franklin than a  
patriot along with men who are en­  
deavoring to pull down the Declara­  
tion of Independence. Just at present  
Americans are killing of Filipinos by  
the hundred. If it Is not In the Interest  
of trade that we spill their blood, it is  
difficult to say why we are killing them  
off. Of this sort of work Franklin said:  
To me, it seems that neither the  
obtaining or retaining of any trade,  
however valuable soever, is an ob­  
ject for which men may Justly spill  
each other’s blood; that the true  
and sure means of extending com­  
merce Is the goodness and cheap­  
ness of commodities; and that the  
profit of no trade can be equal to  
the expense of compelling it and of  
holding it by fleets and armies.  
Thus spoke Franklin over a hundred  
years ago. Such were the sentiments  
of the patriots&#x27; who with him risked  
life and limb and worldly goods for the  
principles, principles recently called  
“treasonable,&quot; set forth In the Declara­  
tion of Independence. It is safe to say  
that were Franklin, Adams, Hancock,  
Revere, Washington, Jefferson, and the ;  
other patriots of the Revolution alive,  
they would not say much in praise o
