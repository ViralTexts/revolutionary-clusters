nse. we must reduce our volume to the simple evangelists, select, even from them, the very words only of Jesus, paring off the Amphibologisms into which they have been led by forgetting often, or not understanding, what had fallen from him, by giving their own misconceptions as his dicta, and  
			 expressing unintelligibly for others what they had not understood themselves. there will be found remaining the most sublime and benevolent code of morals which has ever been offered to  
			 man. I  
			 have  
			 performed this operation for my own use, by cutting verse by verse out of the printed book, and arranging, the matter which is evidently his, and which is as easily distinguishable as diamonds in a dunghill. the result is an 8vo of 46. pages of pure and unsophisticated doctrines, such as were professed &amp; acted on by the unlettered apostles, the Apostolic fathers, and the Christians of the 1st century. their Platonising bre successors indeed, in after times, in order to legitimate the corruptions which they had incorporated into the doctrines of Jesus, found it necessary to disavow, as heretics, the primitive Christians, who had taken their principles from the mouth of Jesus himself, of his Apostles, &amp; the Fathers cotemporary with them. they excommunicated their followers as heretics, branding them with the opprobrious name of Ebionites or Beggars.

.  
I acknolege all the merit of the hymn of Cleanthes to Jupiter, which you ascribe to it. it is as highly sublime as a chaste &amp; correct imagination can permit itself to go. yet in the contemplation of a being so superlative, the hyperbolic flights of the Psalmist may often be followed with approbation, even with rapture; and I have no hesitation in giving him the palm over all the Hymnists of every language, and of every time.  
			 turn to the 148th psalm in Brady &amp; Tate’s version. have such conceptions been ever before expressed? their version of the 15th psalm is more to be esteemed for it’s pithiness, than it’s poetry. even Sternhold, the leaden Sternhold, kindles, in a single instance, with the sublimity of his original, and expresses the majesty of God descending on the earth, in terms not unworthy of the subject.  
  
  
  
‘The Lord descended from above  
  
			   
  
			   
			   
  
And bowed the heav’ns most high;   
  
  
  
And underneath his feet he cast  
  
The darkness of the sky.  
  
  
  
On Cherubim and Seraphim  
  
Full royally he rode;  
  
  
  
And on the wings of mighty winds  
  
Came flying all abroad.’ Psalm XVIII. 9. 10.  
  
  
  
The Latin versions of this passage

_ “We must reduce our volume to the

they have been led, by forgetting often,

nevolent code of morals, which has ever

result is, an octavo of forty-six pages, of  
pure and unsophisticated doctrines, such  
as were professed and acted on by the un-  
lettered Apostles, the Apostolick Fathers,  
and the Christians of the first century.  
Their Platonising successors, indeed, in  
  
after times, in order to legitimate the cor-  
  
ruptions which they had incorporated into  
the doctrines of Jesus, found it necessary  
to disavow the primitive Christians, who  
had taken their principles from the mouth  
of Jesus himself, of his Apostles, and.the  
Fathers cotemporary with them. They  
excommunicated their followers as here-  
ticks, branding thera with the oppro-  
bious name of Ebioniles or Beggars.”
