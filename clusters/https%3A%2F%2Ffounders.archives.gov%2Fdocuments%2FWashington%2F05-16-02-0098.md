[c.24 May 1794]  
  
To the PRESIDENT and CONGRESS of the UNITED STATES of AMERICA;  
The REMONSTRANCE of the Subscribers, Citizens of the Commonwealth of KENTUCKY, SHEWETH:  
THAT your Remonstrants have observed with concern and indignation, the injuries and insults offered to the United States by the king of Great Britain. He has violated in important parts, that treaty of peace, the observance of which might have obliterated the remembrance of former injuries. He has, by means of his agents, supplied arms, ammunition, cloathing and provision to those merciless Savages, who have so long ravaged the Western Frontier of these States. He has interposed, unsolicited, and negociated truces for Portugal and Holland, with the Piratical States, in order to turn the rapine of those African Barbarians solely on the American commerce. His vessels of war, and the Piratical vessels of his subjects, by his orders, in violation of the law of nations, have despoiled the commerce, and insulted  
  
the neutral flag of America. He has made no compensation for the property of citizens of these States, carried away by his troops contrary to treaty. And, that we might escape no species of injury which could be heaped on the weakest and most despicable of nations, he holds within the territory of the United States, in defiance of treaty and of right, posts fortified and garrisoned by his armies.  
That these injuries and insults call loudly for redress, and that we will, to the utmost of our abilities and in any mode that can be devised, support the General Government in the firmest and most effectual measures, to obtain full satisfaction for all our wrongs.  
That your Remonstrants, and the other Inhabitants of the United States West of the Allegany and Appalachian Mountains, are entitled by nature and stipulation to the free and undisturbed Navigation of the River Mississippi; and that from the year 1783 to this day, they have been uniformly prevented, by the Spanish King, from exercising that right. Your Remonstrants have observed, with concern, that the General Government, whose duty it was to have preserved that right, have used no effectual measures for its attainment. That even their tardy and ineffectual negociations, have been veiled with the most misterious secrecy. That, that secrecy is a violation of the political rights of the citizen, as it declares, that the people are unfit to be entrusted with important facts relative to their rights, and that their Servants may retain from them the knowledge of those facts. Eight years are surely sufficient for the discussion of the most doubtful and disputable claim; the right to the Navigation of the Mississippi admits neither of doubt or dispute. Your Remonstrants, therefore, conceive that the negociations on that subject have been unnecessarily lengthy, and they expect, that it be demanded, categorically, of the Spanish king, whether he will acknowledge the right of the Citizens of the United States to the free and uninterrupted Navigation of the River Mississippi, and cause all obstructions, interruption and hindrance to the exercise of that right in future to be withdrawn and avoided, that immediate answer thereto be required; and that such answer be the final period of all negociations upon this subject.  
Your Remonstrants further represent, that the encroachment of the Spaniards upon the Territory of the United States  
  
is a striking and melancholy proof of the situation to which our country will be reduced, if a tame policy should still continue to direct our councils.  
Your Remonstrants join their voice to that of their Fellow Citizens in the Atlantic States, calling for satisfaction for the injuries and insults offered to America, and they expect that such satisfaction shall extend to every injury and insult, done or offered to any part of America by Great Britain and Spain; and as the detention of the Posts and the interruption to the Navigation of the Mississippi, are injuries and insults of the greatest atrocity and of the longest duration, they require the most particular attention to those subjects.  
Your Remonstrants declare, that it is the duty of the General Government to protect the Frontiers, and that the total want of protection, which is now experienced by every part of the Western Frontier, is a grievance of the greatest magnitude and demands immediate redress.

THAT your Remon-

Wich concern and indigna-  
tion, the injuries and intuits  
offered to the United States  
by the king of Great Bri-  
tain. He has violated in  
important parrs, that treaty  
of peace, the obiervance of  
which might have oblitera-

means of his agents, fuppii-  
ed arms, ammunition, cloa-

mercikfs Savages, who have  
fo long ravaged the Weft-

cited, and negociated truces  
for Portugal and Holland,  
with the Piratical States,  
in order to turn the rapine  
o£thofe African Barbarians  
folely on the American

eh of his fubjects, by his or-  
ders, in violation of the law  
of nations, have defpoiled  
the commerce, and infult-&#x27;  
ed the neutral flag of A-  
merica. He has made no  
compenfation for the pro-  
perty of citizens of thefe  
States, carried away by his  
troops contrary to treaty.  
And, that we might efcape  
no fpecies of injury which  
could be heaped on the  
wcakefl and molt defpicable  
of nations, he holds within  
the territory of the United  
States, in defiance of treaty  
and of right, polls fortified

That thefe injuries and

Thatyour Remonftrants,  
and the other Inhabitants  
of the United States Welt  
of the Allegany and Appa-  
lachian Mountains, are en-  
titled by nature and ftipu-

difturbed Navigation of the  
River Miflilfippi ; and that  
from the year 1783 to this  
day, they have been uni-  
formly prevented, by the  
Spanifh King, from exerci-  
fing that right. Your Re-

duty it was to have preler-  
  
Fellow Citizens in the At-

rica, and they expect that  
fuch fatisfaclion fliall ex-  
tend to every injury and in-  
fult, done or offered, to any  
part of America by Great  
Britain and Spain ; and as  
the detention of the Polls  
and the interruption to the  
Navigation of the Miflilfip-  
pi, are injuries and infults  
of the greatell atrocity and  
of the longeft duration, they

To the PRESIDENT and CON­  
GRESS oftheUNITED STATES  
■of AMERICA;  
The remonftrartce of the subscribers,  
Citizens of the commonwealth of  
KENTUCKY, Sheweth.  
r I 1 HAT your remonllrantshaveob  
X lerved with concern and indigna­  
tion, the injuries and insults offered to  
• the United States by the king of Great  
Britain. He has violated in important  
parts, that treaty of peace, the observ­  
ance of\vhich might have obliterated the  
remembrance of fornfcr injuries. He  
; has by means of his agents, supplied  
arnjs, ammunition, •cloathing and pro­  
iion to those mercilcfsfavages, who have  
so long lavagtd the weftcrn frontier of  
thele Hates. He has interposed, Unso­  
licited, and negociated truces for Por­  
tugal and Holland, with the piratical  
Itates, in ordei to turn the lapirfe of  
those African barbarians, folel,y on the  
Americau commerce. His veiTelj of  
war, and the piratical veflels of his sub  
&#x27; je&amp;s, by his orders, in violation of the  
law of nations, have despised the com­  
merce, and insulted the neutral flag of  
America. He has made no compensa­  
tion for the property of citizens of thele  
Itates, catned away by his troops con­  
trary to treaty. And, that we might  
escape no lpecies of injury, which could  
be heaped on the weakest and most des­  
picable of nations, he holds within the  
-erritory of the United States, in defi­  
ance of treaty and of. right, potts for­  
tified and gairifoned by his armies.  
That these injuries and insults call  
loudly for redress, and that we will, to  
the utmoftof our abilities, and in any  
mode that can be devised, support the  
general government in the firmell and  
molt effe&amp;ual measures, to obtain full  
fatisfaCtion for all our wrongs.  
Thatyour I&#x27;tmoMlrants,and the&#x27;other  
inhabitants ofthe United States weft of  
the Allegany and Appalachian moun­  
tains, are entitled by nature and ftfpu­  
lation to the free aird undisturbed navi­  
gation of the Miffifippi ; and that from  
the year 1783 to this day, they have  
been uniformly prevented by the Span­  
ish king from exercising that right.  
Your remonllrants have observed with  
concern, that the general government,  
whose duty it was to have preserved  
that right, have used no effectual meas­  
ures for its attainment. That even their  
tardy and ineffectual negociations, have  
been veiled with the most mysterious se­  
crecy. That that secrecy is a violation  
of the political rights of the citizens, as  
it declares that the people are unfit to be  
entrusted with important faCts relative to  
their rights, and that their servants may  
retain from them the knowledge ot those  
fads. Eight years are surely fufficiqnt  
for the discussion of the most doubtful  
and disputable claim. ; the right to the  
navigation of the Miffifippi admits nei­  
ther of doubt or dispute. Your remon-  
Itrants therefore conceive, that the ne­  
-gociations on that subjeCt have been un­  
tieceflarily lengthy, and they expeCt,  
that it be demandedcategorically, of the  
Spanish king, whether he will acknow­  
ledge the right of the citizens of the U­  
iiited States to the free and undisturbed  
ed navigation of the river Miililippi, and  
  
catife all obstruCtions, interruption and  
hindrance to the exetcife of that right  
in future to be withdrawn and avoided,  
that immedfate answer thereto be re­  
quired, and that such answer be,the fin­  
al period of all negotiations upon this  
fubjcCt.  
\ our remonstrants further represent,  
that the encioachment of the Spaniards  
upon the territory of the United States  
is a Striking and melancholy proof of the  
situation to which our country will be  
reduced, if a tame policy should Hill  
continue to direct our councils.  
Your remonstrants join their voice to  
that of their fellow citi4ens in the At­  
lantic itates, calling for fatisfaCtion for  
the injuries and i&lt;ifultsoffered to Ameri­  
ca, and they expect that such fatisfaCtion  
shall extend to every injury and insult,  
done or offered, to any part of Ameri­  
ca by Great Britain and Spain, and as  
the detention of the potts, and the in­  
terruption to the navigation of the Milfi­  
fippi,are injuries and insults of the great­  
elt atrocity and of-ihe longed duration,  
they require1 the moll particular attenti­  
on to those Subjects.  
Your Remonstrants declare, that ft  
is the duty of the general government  
to protect the frontiers, and that liie to­  
tal want of protection which is now ex­  
perienced by every part of the weltern

To the President and Congress of the United States  
*&gt;f America ; the Remount ranee of the subscriber*,  
citizens of the cotmuonu&#x27;calth of Kentucht), shew­  
cth :  
“ That your remonstrants have observed with  
concern and indignation, the injuries and insults of­  
fered to the United States by the king of Great iin­  
tain. He has violated in important parts, that trea­  
ty of peace, the observance of which might have  
obliterated the remembrance of former injuries, lie  
has by means of his agents, supplied arms, ammuni­  
tion, eloathing and provision to those merciless sa­  
vages, who huve so long ravaged the western fron­  
tier of the&gt;=e states. He has interposed, unsolicited, 1  
and negociated truces for Portugal and Holland, j  
with the piratical states in order to turn the rapine  
of those African barbarians solely on the American  
commerce. His vessels of war, and the piratical  
vessels of his subjects, by his orders, in violation of  
the law of nations, have despoiled the commerce,  
and insulted the neural flag of America. He has  
made no compensation for the property of citizens  
of these states, earned away by his troops contrary  
to treaty. And that we might escape no species of  
injury which could be heaped on the weakest and  
most despicable of nations, he holds within the ter­  
ritory of the United States, in defiance oltreaty and  
of right, posts fortified, and garrisoned by his ar­  
mies.  
That these injuries and insults call loudly for re­  
dress, and that we will to the utmost of our abilities  
and in any mode that can be devised, support the  
general government, in the firmest and most&#x27; effec­  
tual measures, to obtain full satisfaction for all our  
■wrongs.  
That your remonstrants, and the other inhabitants  
of the United States west of the Allegany and Ap­  
palachian mountains are entitled by nature and sti­  
pulation to free and undisturbed navigation sf the  
river Mississippi; and that from the year 1783 to  
this day, they liave been uniformly prevented bv the  
Spanish King Horn exercising that right. Your  
remonstrants have observed, with concern, that the  
general government, whose duty it was to have pre­  
served that right, have used no effectual measures for  
its attainment. That even their tardy and ineft&#x27;ec­  
tiuil liegociations, have been veiled with the most  
mysterious secrecy. That, that secrecy is a violati­  
on of, the political rights of the citizen, as it declares  
that the people are unfit to be irusted with impor­  
tant facts relative to their rights, and, that their  
servants may retain from them. the knowledge of­  
those facts. Eight years are sorely sufficient for tin  
discussion of the most doubtful and disputabl  
claim; the right to the navigation of the Mississip­  
  
pi admits neither of dOult nor dispute. Ttorn remon­  
strants, therefore, eonceive that the negnciatiofis on  
that subject have been unnecessarily lengthy, and  
they expect, that it be demanded categorically, of  
the Spanish king, whether he will acknowledge the  
right of,the citizens of the United States to the free  
and uninterupted navigation ol the river Mississippi,  
and cause all obstructions, interruption and hin­  
drance to the exercised that right in future to be  
withdrawn and avoided, that immediate answer  
thereto be required ; and that such answer be the  
final period of all negotiations upon this subject.  
Your remonstrants further represent, that the en­  
croachment of .the Spaniards upon the territory of  
the United States is a striking and melancholy proof  
of the situation to which our country will be reduced,  
if a tame policy should still continue to direct our  
councils.  
Your remonstrants join theirvoiee to that of their  
fellow-citizens in the Atlantick states, calling for sa­  
tisfaction for the injuries and insults ottered to Arae­  
nra, and that they expect that such satisfaction  
shall extend to every injury and insult, done or of­  
fered, to any part of America by Great Britain and  
Spain ; and as the detention of the posts and the  
interi option to the navigation of the Mississippi,  
aie injuries and insults of the greatest atrocity and  
of the longest duration, they require the most par­  
ticular attention to those subjects.  
Your remonstrants declare, that it is the duty of  
the general government to protect the frontiers, and  
that trie total want of protection, which is now ex­  
perienced by every part of the western frontier, is a  
grievance of the greatest magnitude and demands  
immediate redress/

terated the remonstrance of former injuries. He  
has, by means of his agents, supplied &quot;arms, am­  
munition, cloathing and provision to those meiri­  
lgss savuges, who have so long ravaged the western  
frontier of these states. He has interposed, unso­  
licited, and negotiated truces for Portugal and Hol­  
land, with the piratical states ? in order to turn the  
rapine of those African barbarians solely on the A­  
meriran commerce. His vessels of war, and the pi­  
ratical vessels of his subjects, by bis orders, in vi­  
olation of the law of nations, have despoiled of  
commerce and insulted the neutral flag of America,  
lie has made no compensation for the property of  
(|jtizensof these states, carried away by his troops  
Contrary to treaty. And, that we might escape no  
•pecies of injury which could be heaped on the  
weakest and most despicable of nations, he holds  
within the territory of the United States, in defi­  
ance of treaty and right, posts fortified and garri­  
soned by his atmics.  
That these injuries and insults call loudly for re­  
dress, und that we will, to the utmost of our abili­  
ties and in any mode that can be devised, support  
the general government, in the firmest and most ef­  
t factual measures to obtain full satisfaction for all  
our wrongs.  
  
*,natyour remonstrants, and the other inhabi­  
tants of the United States west of the Allegany and  
Apalurhian mountains, me entitled by nature and J  
stipulation to the free and undisturbed navigation oi &#x27;  
the river Mississippi; and that from theyear 1763 to I  
this day, they ha ve been uniformly prevented by the !  
Spanish king, from exercising that right. Your re­  
monstrants have observed, v. ith concern, that tin­  
general government, whose duty it was to have pre­  
served that right, have used no effectual measures  
for us attainment. That even the tardy and inei­  
fectual negotiations have been veiled with the moti  
mysterious secret y. 1 hat, that secrecy is a viola­  
tion of the political rights of the citijen, us it de­  
clares that the people ure unlit to be entrusted with  
important facta relative to their rights, and that  
servants may retain from the knowledge of those  
facts, flight yeirs are surely sniiicient mr the dis­  
cussion of the most dou&#x27;dlul and disputable claim :  
the right to the na&#x27;igaticn of the Mississippi ad­  
mits neither of doubt nor dispute. Your remonstrants  
therefore, conceive, that the negotiations on that  
subject have been unnecessarily lengthy, and they  
expect, that it be demanded, categorically of the  
Spanish king, whether he will acknowledge the fight  
of the citizens of the United States to the free and  
V . l » ,  
  
uninterrupted navigation of th# river Mississippi,  
and cause alt obstructions, interruptions, or hin­  
drance to the exercise of that right in future to be  
withdrawn and avoided, that immediate answer  
thereto be required ; and that such answer be the  
final period of all negotiations upon this subject.  
Your remonstrants further represent, that the en­  
croachment of the Spaniards upon the territory of  
j the United States, is a striking and melancholy  
proof of the situation to which our country will l,e  
reduced, if a tame policy should still continue to di­  
rect our councils.  
Your remonstrants join their voice to that of  
their fellow citizen? in the Atlantic States, calling I  
for satisfaction for the injuries and insults offered to  
America, and they expect that such satisfaction  
shall extend to every injury and insult done or offer­  
ed to any part of America, by Great Britain and  
Spain ; and as the detention of posts, and the inter­  
ruption to the navigation of the Mississippi, are in­  
juries and insults of the greatest atrocity and long­  
est durution, they require the most particular at­  
tention to those subjects.
