Head Quarters Newtown [Pa.] 27th Decemr 1776.  
  
I have the pleasure of congratulating you upon the Success of an Enterprize, which I had formed against a Detatchment of the Enemy lying in Trenton, and which was executed yesterday Morning.  
The Evening of the 25th I ordered the Troops intended for this Service to parade back of McKonkey’s Ferry, that they might begin to pass as soon as it grew dark, imagining we should be able to throw them all over, with the necessary Artillery, by 12 OClock, and that we might easily arrive at Trenton by five in the Morning, the distance being about nine Miles. But the quantity of Ice, made that Night, impeded the passage of Boats so much, that it was three OClock before the Artillery could all be got over, and near four, before the Troops took up their line of march.  
This made me despair of surprizing the Town, as I well knew we could not reach it before the day was fairly broke, but as I was certain there was no making a Retreat without being discovered, and harassed on repassing the River, I determined to push on at all Events. I formed my Detatchment into two divisions one to march by the lower or River road, the other, by the upper or Pennington Road. As the Divisions had nearly the same distance to march, I ordered each of them, immediately upon forcing the out Guards, to push directly into the Town, that they might charge the Enemy before they had time to form. The upper division arrived at the Enemys advanced post, exactly at eight OClock, and in three Minutes after, I found from the fire on the lower Road that, that Division had also got up. The Out Guards made but small Opposition, tho’, for their Numbers, they behaved very well, keeping up a constant retreating fire from behind Houses.  
We presently saw their main Body formed, but from their Motions, they seem’d undetermined how to act.  
Being hard pressed by our Troops, who had already got possession of part of their Artillery, they attempted to file off by a road on their right leading to Princetown, but perceiving their Intention, I threw a Body of Troops in their Way which immediately checked them. Finding from our disposition, that they were surrounded, and that they must inevitably be cut to peices if they made any further Resistance, they agreed to lay down their Arms. The Number, that submitted in this manner, was 23 Officers and 886 Men. Colo. Rall the commanding Officer and seven others were found wounded in the Town. I dont exactly know how many they had killed, but I fancy not above twenty or thirty, as they never made any regular Stand. Our Loss is very trifling indeed, only two Officers and one or two privates wounded.  
  
  
  
  
I find, that the Detatchment of the Enemy consisted of the three Hessian Regiments of Lanspatch, Kniphausen and Rohl amounting to about 1500 Men, and a Troop of British Light Horse; but immediately, upon the beginning of the Attack, all those, who were not killed or taken, pushed directly down the Road towards Bordentown. These would likewise have fallen into our hands, could my plan have been compleatly carried into Execution. Genl Ewing was to have crossed before day at Trenton Ferry, and taken possession of the Bridge leading out of Town, but the Quantity of Ice was so great, that tho’ he did every thing in his power to effect it, he could not get over. This difficulty also hindered Genl Cadwallader from crossing, with the Pennsylvania Militia, from Bristol, he got part of his Foot over, but finding it impossible to embark his Artillery, he was obliged to desist. I am fully confident, that could the Troops, under Generals Ewing and Cadwallader, have passed the River, I should have been able, with their Assistance, to have driven the Enemy from all their posts below Trenton. But the Numbers I had with me, being inferior to theirs below me, and a strong Battalion of Light Infantry being at Princetown above me, I thought it most prudent to return the same Evening, with the prisoners and the Artillery we had taken. We found no Stores of any Consequence in the Town.  
In justice to the Officers and Men, I must add, that their Behaviour upon this Occasion, reflects the highest honor upon them. The difficulty of passing the River in a very severe Night, and their March thro’ a violent Storm of Snow and Hail, did not in the least abate their Ardour. But when they came to the Charge, each seemed to vie with the other in pressing forward, and were I to give a preferance to any particular Corps, I should do great injustice to the others.  
Colo. Baylor, my first Aid de Camp, will have the honor of delivering this to you, and from him you may be made acquainted with many other particulars; his spirited Behaviour upon every Occasion, requires me to recommend him to your particular Notice. I have the Honor to be with great Respect Sir Your most obt Servt

I HAVE the pleafure of congratulating  
you upon the fuccefs of an enterprize,  
which I had formed againft a detachment

by twelve o&#x27;clock, that we might ealily  
arrive at Trenton by five o’ciock in the

miles; but the quantity of ice made that  
n ght, impeded the paflage of the boats  
e@ much, that it was three o’clock before  
  
  
  
Account of American Affairs.  
  
the artillery could be got over, and near  
four when the troops took up the liné of  
march, I formed my detachment into  
two divifions, one to march wp the lower  
or River road, the other by the upper or  
Pennington road. As the divifions had  
nearly the fame diftance to march, I ore  
dered each of them, immediately upon  
forcing the out-guards, to pufh direétly  
into the town, that they might charge the  
enemy before they had time to form,  
The upper divifion arrived at the enemy&#x27;s  
advanced poft exadtly at eight o&#x27;clock,  
and in three minutes after I found, from  
the fire in the lower road, that that divi-  
fion had alfo got up. The out-guards  
made but a fmall oppofition, though for  
their numbers they behaved very well,  
keeping up a conftant retreating bre be-

main body fornted, but from their mo-  
tions they feemed indetermined how to  
aét, being hard preffled by our troops,  
who had already got pofleffion of half  
their artillery, they attempted to file off  
bya road on their right, leading to Prince-  
town, but perceiving their intention, E  
threw a body of troops in their way,  
which immediately checked them.  
Finding from our difpofition that they  
were furrounded, and muft inevitably be  
cut to pieces if they made any further re-  
fiftance, they agreed to lay down their  
arms. The number that fubmitted in  
this manner were 23 officers, and 886  
men. Col. Rhal, the commanding of-  
ficer, and feven others, were found wound-  
edin the town, I do not exaétly know  
how many were killed, but I fancy about  
20 or 30, as they never made any regular  
ftand, Our lofs was very trifling indeed,  
only four officers, and one or two privates  
wounded, I find the detachment of the  
enemy confifted of three regiments of  
Heffians, Hanfpatch, Kniphaufen, and  
Rhal, amounting to about 1500 men,  
and a troop of Britith light horfe, Im-  
mediately upon the beginning of the at-  
tack, all thofe who were not killed, or  
taken, pufhed direétly down the road to-

Dee. 26, i776.  
SIR,  
| HAVE the pleafure of. congratulating you  
ypon the fuccefs of an enterprize, which I had  
formed againit a detachment of the enemy lying  
in Trenton, and was executed yefterday morn-  
ing. The evening of the 2sth,1 ordered the  
troops intended for this purpote to parade the  
back of M*Kenky’s Ferry, that they might be-  
gintopalsasfoon as it giew dark; imagining  
that we fhould be able to throw them all over,  
with the neceflary artillery, by twelve o’clock,  
thatwe might eafily arrive at Trenton by five  
Oclock inthe morning, the diflance being about  
wine miles; but the quantity of ice made that  
ueht, impeded the paffage of the boats fo much,  
Wat if Was three o’clock before the artillery could  
‘got over, and near four whenthe troops took  
tp the lme of march, I formed my detachment  
Ito two divifions, one to march up the lower or

diltance to march, I ordered each of them, im-  
mediately upon forcing the out-guards, to puth  
tretly into the town, that they might charge  
te enemy before they had time to form. The  
ter divifion arrived at the enemy’s advanced  
potexadtly at eight o’clock, and in three mi-  
mutes atter | found, from the fire in the lower  
tad, that that divifion had allo got up. The  
*ut-guards made but a {mail oppofition, though

Finding from our dilpofition that they were  
furrounded, and muft inevitably be cut to pieced  
it they mede any father vefftance, they agreed  
to lay down their arms. The number that tub-  
mitted tn this manner were 23 officers, and 886  
men, Col. Rhal, the commanding officer, and  
leven others, were found wounded in the town.  
I do not exactly knew how many were killed,  
but ] fancy about 20 or 30, as they never made  
any regular ftand. Our lois was very trifling in-  
deed, only four officers, and one Or two privates  
wounded. | find the detachment of the ene-  
my contifted of the three regiments of Heflians,  
Hanipach, Kuiphauten, and Rhal, amounting  
to about 1g00 men, anda troopot Brituh lghe

attack, all thofe who were net killed, or wound-  
ed, puthed directly Gown the road towards Bur-  
Genton, Thete would likewile have talleni¢o

carried into execution. Ceneral Erving was to  
have crofled before day, at Trenton Perry, and  
taken pofleffion of a bridge leading out of town ;  
but the quantity of ice was fo great, tha’,  
though he did every thing in his power to etke&amp;t  
it, he could not get over; and finding it impoft-  
ble to embark his artillery, he was obliped to  
detiit. I am fully confident, thar, could the  
troops under General Fiving and Cadwallader  
have patled the river, Ll fhould have been able,  
with their afliitance, to have driven the enemy  
fram all their poits below Trenton; but the  
number I had with me, betag inferior to thote

try being at Prince’s Town above me, bthoughe

diately upon forcing the out-gnards, to  
pnlh directly info the town, that they

arrived at the enemy’s advanced poll at  
eight o’clock, and in three minutes after  
I found, from the fire in the lower road,  
that the other divifion had alfo gol up.  
The out-guards made but a fmall oppo-  
lition, though, for their numbers, they  
behaved very well, keeping up a conllant  
jctreating fire behind houfes. We pre-  
fently faw their main body formed, but  
from their motions they feem^&#x27;d indeter-  
mined how to adt, being hard prelfed by  
our&#x27;troops, who had already got pofl&#x27;ef-  
iion of half their artillery, they attempt¬  
ed to file off by a road on their right,  
leading to Princc-town ; but prrcciving  
their intention, I threw a body of troops  
in their way, which iiiimediatey checked  
them.  
  
“ Finding from our difpofilion that  
they were fprrounded, and muft inevi¬  
tably be cut to pieces if they made any  
further refiftance, they agreed to lay  
down their arms. The number that  
fubmitted in this manner were 23 offi¬  
cers, and 886 men. Col. Rail, the com¬  
manding officer, and feven others, were  
found wounded in the town. I do not  
exadly know how many were killed,  
but I fancy about 20 or 30, as they ne¬  
ver made any regular (land. Our lofs  
was very trifling indeed, only four offi¬  
cers, and one or two privates w&#x27;ounded.  
I find the detachment of the enemy co.i-  
fified of three regiments of Kclfians,  
Anfpach, Kniphapfen, and Rail, amoun¬  
ting to about 1500 men, and a tioop of  
Britifli light horfe. Immediately upon  
the beginning of the attack, all thofe  
who were not killed or taken, puflied  
dircdly down the road towards Burden-  
tom. Thcfe would likewife have fallen  
into our hands, could my plan immedi¬  
ately have been carried into execution,  
Gen. Erving was to have eroded before  
day at Trent on-ferr^S ^nd taken poffcl-  
fion of a bridge leading out of town ;  
but the quantity of ice was fo great, that  
though he did every thing in his power  
to effedt it, he could not get ovrr ; and  
finding it impoffible to embark his artil¬  
lery, he was obliged to defift. 1 am ful¬  
  
ly confident, that conid (he troops nn-  
der gens. Erving and Cadwallader have  
paflVd the river, 1 Ihoukl have been able,  
with their afliftance, to have driven the  
enemy from a’l their pofti below Tren¬  
ton ; but tlie number I had with me  
being inferior to thofe bclow&#x27;me, and a  
ftrong battalion of light infantry  
Prirve-town above me, I thought it moft  
prudent to return the fame evening with  
the prifoners, and the artillery we had  
takrn. We found no (lores or any con-  
fequence in the towm.  
  
“ In iuflice to the officers and mm,  
I mud add, that their behaviour on this  
occafion refledf the highed honour upon  
them. The difficulty of pading the li¬  
ver in a very feverc night, and their  
march through a violent di&#x27;rm of fnow  
and hail, did not iu the lead abate their  
ardour ; but w&#x27;hen they came to charge,  
each feemed to vie with the other in  
pulhing forward ; and w’cre I to give a  
preference to any particular corps, I  
Ihoiild do injudice to the other. Capt.  
Baylor, my% fird aid-de-camp, will have  
the honour to deliver this to you ; and  
from’ him you may be made acquainted  
wMth many other particulars : His fpiri-  
ted behaviour upon every occafion re¬  
quires me to recommend him to your  
particular notice. 1 have the honour to  
be, with great refpedt. Sir, youis, See.

Head-Quarters, Newton,  
27th December, 1776.  
Sir,  
  
I have the pleasure of congratulating you on  
the success of an enterprize, which I had form.  
ed against a detachment of the enemy lying in  
Trenton, and which was executed yesterday  
morning.  
  
The evening of the 25th I ordered the troops  
intended for this service, to parade back of Mr.  
Kenky’s ferry, that they might begin to pass as  
sooh as it grew dark, imagining we should be  
able to throw them all over, with the necessary  
artillery by twelve o’clock and that we might  
easily arrive at Trenton by five in the morning,  
the distance being about nine miles. But the  
quantity of ice made that night impeded the pas-  
sage of the boats, so much that it was three  
o&#x27;clock before the artillery could all be got over  
and near four o&#x27;clock before the troops took up  
their line of march.  
  
I formed my detachment into two divisions,  
one to march up the lower or river road, the  
other by the upper or Pennington road. As the  
divisions had nearly the same distance to march,  
I ordered each of them immediately on forcing  
the out-guard, to push directly into the town,  
that they might charge the enemy belore they  
had time to form. ‘The upper division arrived  
at the enemy’s advance post, exactly at eight  
o&#x27;clock, and in three minutes after, I found by  
the fire on the lower road, that division had also  
got up. The out-guards made but a small op-  
position, though for their numbers they behaved  
very well, keeping up a constant retreating fire  
from behind houses.  
  
We presently saw their main body formed,  
but from their motions they seemed undeter-  
mined how to act. Being hard pressed by our  
troops, who had already got possession of part  
of their artillery, they attempted to file off hy a  
road on their right, leading to Princeton; but  
perceiving their infention, } threw a body of  
troops in their way, which immediately checked  
them. Finding from our disposition, that they  
were surrounded and must inevitably be cut in  
pieces if they made any further resistance, they  
agreed to lay down their arms. ‘the number  
that submitted in this manner was twenty-three  
officers and eight hundred and eighty-six men.  
Col. Rohl the commanding officer and seven  
others were found wounded in the town. I do  
hot knew how many they had killed, but I fancy  
hot above twenty or thirty as they never made  
any regular stand. Our loss is very trifling in-  
deed ; only two officers, and one or two privates  
wounded. I find the detachment of the enemy  
consisted of the three Hessian regiments of  
Landspatch; Kniphausen and Rohl; amount-  
ing to about fifteen hundred men and a troop of  
British light-horse ; but immediately upon the  
beginning of the attack, all those who were not  
  
Killed or taken, pushed directly down the road

towards Bordentown. These would likewise  
have fallerr into our hands; could my plan have  
been completely carried into execution. Gene-  
ral Ewing was to have crossed before day at  
Trenton ferry and taken possession of the bridge  
leading out of town; but the quantity of ice was  
so great, that though he did every thing in his  
power to effect it, he could not get over. This  
difficulty also hindered General Cadwallader from  
crossing with the Pennsylvania militia from Bris-  
tol. He got part of the fuot over, but finding it  
impossible to embark his artillery he was obliged  
to desist. 1am fully confident, that could the  
troops under General Ewing and Cadwallader  
have passed the river, I should have been able,  
with their assistance to have driven the enemy  
from all their pests below Trenton. But the  
numbers I had with me, being inferior to theirs  
below me, and a strong battalion of light-infantry  
being at Princeton, above me, I thought it most  
pradent to return the same evening with the pri-  
soners and the artillery we had taken. We found  
no stores of any consequence in the town. In  
justice to the officers and men, I must add, that  
their behaviour on this eccasion reflects the  
highest bonour upon them. The difficulty of  
passing the river in a very severe night and their  
march through a violent storm of Kail and snow,  
did not in the least abate their ardour; but when  
they came to the charge, each seemed to vie  
with the other, in pressing forward, and were I  
to give the preference to any particular corps,  
I should do great injustice to the others. ~ Col.  
Baylor my first aid du camp, will have the ho-  
nour of delivering you this, and from him you  
  
may be made acquainted with several other pars |  
  
ticulars. His spirited behaviour on every occa-  
sion requires me to recommend him to your par-  
ticular notice.  
I have the honour to be with great respect,  
Sir,  
Your most humble servant,

December 27, 1776.  
  
“Sir,  
  
“T have the pleasure of congratulating you upon the success of an enterprise,  
which I had formed against a detachment of the enemy, lying in Trenton, and  
which was executed yesterday morning. The evening of the 25th I ordered the  
troops intended for this service to parade back of McKonkey’s Ferry, that they  
might begin to pass as soon as it grew dark, imagining we should be able to throw  
them all over, with the necessary artillery, by twelve o’clock, and that we might  
easily arrive at Trenton by five in the morning, the distance being about nine miles.  
But the quantity of ice, made that night, impeded the passage of the boats so much,  
that it was three o’clock before the artillery could all be got over; and near four,  
before the troops took up their line of march. This made me despair of surprising  
the town, as I well knew we could not reach it before the day was fairly broke.  
But as I was certain there was no making a retreat without bemg discovered and  
harassed on repassing the river, 1 determined to push on at all events. I formed  
my detachment into two divisions, one to march by the lower or river road, the  
other by the upper or Pennington road. As the divisions had nearly the same dis-  
tance to march, I ordered each of them, immediately upon forcing the out-guards,  
to push directly into the town, that they might charge the enemy before they had  
time to form.  
  
“The upper division arrived at the enemy’s advanced post exactly at eight o’clock ;  
and in three minutes after, I found, from the fire on the lower road, that that divi-  
sion had also got up. The out-guards made but small opposition, though, for their  
numbers, they behaved very well, keeping up a constant retreating fire from behind  
houses. We presently saw their main body formed; but, from their motions, they  
seemed undetermined how to act. Being hard pressed by our troops, who had already  
got possession of their artillery, they attempted to file off by a road on their right,  
eading to Princeton. But, perceiving their intention, I threw a body of troops in  
their way, which immediately checked them. Finding from our disposition that  
they were surrounded, and that they must inevitably be cut to pieces if they made  
any further resistance, they agreed to lay down their arms. The number that sub-  
mitted in this manner was twenty-three officers and eight hundred and eighty-six  
men, Colonel Rahl, the commanding officer, and seven others, were found wounded  
in the town. I do not exactly know how many were killed; but I fancy not above  
twenty or thirty, as they never made any regular stand. Our loss is very trifling  
indeed, only two officers and one or two privates wounded.  
  
“J find that the detachment of the enemy consisted of the three Hessian regi-  
ments of Anspach, Kniphausen, and Rahl, amounting to about fifteen hundred men,  
and a troop of British light-horse; but, immediately upon the beginning of the at-  
tack, all those, who were not killed or taken, ow | directly down the road towards  
Bordentown. These would likewise have fallen into our hands, could my plan have  
been completely carried into execution. General Ewing was to have crossed before  
day at Trenton Ferry, and taken possession of the bridge leading out of town; but

HEADQUARTERS, MORRISTOWN, Dec. 27, 1776,  
  
To the President of Congress :  
  
Srtr—I have the pleasure of congratulating you upon the  
success of an enterprise which I had formed against a detach.  
ment of the enemy lying in Trenton, and which was executed  
yesterday morning.  
  
The evening of the twenty-fifth I ordered the troops intended  
for this service to parade back of McKonkey’s ferry, that they  
might begin to pass as soon as it grew dark, imagining we  
should be able to throw them all over, with the necessary artil-  
lery, by twelve o&#x27;clock, and that we might easily arrive at  
Trenton by five in the morning, the distance being about nine  
miles. But the quantity of ice made that night impeded the  
passage of the boats so much that it was three o’clock before  
the artillery could all be got over; and near four before the  
troops took up their line of march.  
  
This made me despair of surprising the town, as I well knew  
we could not reach it before the day was fairly broke. But as  
I was certain there was no making a retreat without being dis-  
covered, and harassed on re-passing the river, I determined to  
push on at all events. I formed my detachment into two di-  
visions, one to march by the lower or river road, the other by  
the upper or Pennington road. As the divisions had nearly the  
same distance to march, I ordered each of them, immediately  
upon forcing the out-guards, to push directly into the town, that  
they might charge the enemy before they had time to form.  
  
The upper division arrived at the enemy’s advanced post  
exactly at eight o’clock: and in three minutes after | found,  
from the fire on the lower road, that that division had also got  
up. The out-guards made but small opposition, though, for  
their numbers, they behaved very well, keeping up a constant  
retreating fire from behind houses. We presently saw their  
main body formed ; but from their motions, they seemed unde-  
termined how to act.  
  
Being hard pressed by our troops, who had already got pos-  
session of their artillery, they attempted to file off by a road on  
their right, leading to Princeton. But, perceiving their inten-  
tion, I threw a body of troops in their way ; which immediately  
checked them. Finding, from our disposition, that they were  
surrounded, and that they must inevitably be cut to pieces if  
they made any further resistance, they agreed to lay down  
their arms. The number that submitted in this manner was  
twenty-three officers and eight hundred and eighty-six men.  
Colonel Rahl, the commanding officer, and seven others, were  
found wounded in the town. I do not exactly know how many  
they had killed ; but I fancy not above twenty or thirty, as they  
never made any regular stand. Our loss is very trifling indeed  
—only two officers and one or two privates wounded.  
  
I find that the detachment consisted of the three Hessian  
regiments of Lanspach, Kniphausen, and Rahl, amounting to  
about fifteen hundred men, and a troop of British light horse;  
but immediately upon the beginning of the attack, all those who  
were not killed or taken pushed directly down toward Borden-  
town. These would likewise have fallen into our hands could  
my plan have been completely carried into execution.  
  
General Ewing was to have crossed before day at Trenton  
ferry, and taken possession of the bridge leading out of town;  
but the quantity of ice was so great that, though he did every  
thing in his power to effect it, he could not get over. This  
difficulty also hindered General Cadwallader from crossing  
with the Pennsylvania militia from Bristol. He got part of his  
foot over; but finding it impossible to embark his artillery, he  
was obliged to desist.  
  
I am fully confident that, could the troops under Generals  
Ewing and Cadwallader have passed the river, I should have |  
been able, with their assistance, to have driven the enemy from

being inferior to theirs below me, and a strong battalion of light  
infantry being at Princeton above me, I thought it most pru-  
dent to return the same evening with the prisoners and the ar-  
tillery we had taken. We found no stores of any consequence  
in the town.  
  
In justice to the officers and men, I must add that their be-  
havior upon this occasion reflects the highest honor upon them.  
The difficulty of passing the river in a very severe night, and  
their march through a violent storm of snow and hail, did not  
in the least abate their ardor; but when they came to the charge  
each seemed to vie with the other in pressing forward; and  
were I to give a preference to any particular corps I should do  
great injustice to the others.  
  
Colonel Baylor, my first aid-de-camp, will have the honor of  
delivering this to you; and from him you may be made ac-  
quainted with many other particulars. His spirited behavior  
upon every occasion requires me to recommend him to your  
particular notice.  
  
I have the honor to be, etc., G. W.

General Ewing was also prevented from crossing opposite to Trenton. “I  
am fully confident,” wrote Washington, “that could the troops under  
Generals Ewing and Cadwalader have passed the river, I should have been
