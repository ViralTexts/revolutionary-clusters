To the Senate &amp; House of Representatives of the US.  
  
6 Dec. 1805  
  
  
  
The depredations which had been committed on the commerce of the US during a preceding war, by persons under the authority of Spain, are sufficiently known to all. these made it a duty to require from that government indemnifications for our injured citizens. a Convention was accordingly entered into between the minister of the US. at at Madrid, &amp; the Minister of that government for foreign affairs, by which it was agreed that Spoliations committed by Spanish subjects &amp; carried into ports of Spain should be paid for by that nation; &amp; that those committed by French subjects, &amp; carried into Spanish ports should remain for further discussion. before this Convention was returned to Spain with our ratification, the transfer of Louisiana by France to the US. took place; an event as unexpected as disagreeable to Spain. from that moment she seemed to change her conduct &amp; dispositions towards us. it was first manifested by her protest against the right of France to alienate Louisiana to us; which however was soon retracted, &amp; the right confirmed. then high offence was manifested at the act of Congress establishing a Collection district on the Mobille, altho by an authentic declaration, immediately made, it was expressly confined to our acknoleged limits. and she now refused to ratify the Convention signed by her own minister under the eye of his sovereign unless we would consent to alterations of it’s terms which would have affected our claims against her for the spoliations by French subjects carried into Spanish ports.  
To obtain justice, as well as to restore friendship, I thought a special mission advisable, &amp; accordingly appointed James Monroe, Minister extraordinary &amp; plenipotentiary, to repair to Madrid, &amp; in conjunction with our minister resident there, to endeavor to procure a ratification of the former convention, &amp; to come to an understanding with Spain as to the boundaries of Louisiana. it appeared at once that her policy was to reserve herself for events, &amp; in the mean time to keep our differences in an undetermined state. this will be evident from the papers now communicated to you. after nearly five months of fruitless endeavor to bring them to some definite and satisfactory result our Ministers ended the conferences, without having been able to obtain indemnity for spoliations of any description, or any satisfaction as to the boundaries of Louisiana, other than a declaration that we had no rights Eastward of the Iberville, and that our line to the West was one which would have left us but a string of land on that bank of the river Missisipi. our injured citizens were thus left without any prospect of retribution from the wrongdoer; and as to boundary each party was to take it’s own course. that which they have chosen to pursue will appear from the documents now communicated. they authorize the inference that it is their intention to advance on our possessions until they shall be repressed by an opposing force. considering that Congress alone is constitutionally invested with the power of changing our condition from peace to war, I have thought it my duty to await their authority for using force in any degree which could be avoided. I have barely instructed the Officers stationed in the neighborhood of the aggressions, to protect our citizens from violence, to patrole within the borders actually delivered to us, &amp; not to go out of them but when necessary to repel an inroad, or to rescue a citizen or his property: and the Spanish officers remaining at New Orleans are required to depart without further delay.   it ought to be noted here that since the late change in the state of affairs in Europe, Spain has ordered her cruisers &amp; courts to respect our treaty with her.  
The conduct of France, &amp; the part she may take in the misunderstandings between the US. &amp; Spain, are too important to be unconsidered. she was prompt &amp; decided in her declarations that our demands on Spain for French spoliations carried into Spanish ports, were included in the settlement between the US. &amp; France. she took at once the ground that she had acquired no right from Spain, &amp; had meant to deliver us none, Eastward of the Iberville; her silence as to the Western boundary leaving us to infer her opinion might be against Spain in that quarter. whatever direction she might mean to give to these differences, it does not appear that she has contemplated their proceeding to actual rupture, or that, at the date of our last advices from Paris, her government had any suspicion of the hostile attitude Spain had taken here. on the contrary we have reason to believe that she was disposed to effect a settlement on a plan analogous to what our ministers had proposed, &amp; so comprehensive as to remove as far as possible the grounds of future collision &amp; controversy on the Eastern as well as Western side of the Missisipi.  
The present crises in Europe is favorable for pressing such a settlement; &amp; not a moment should be lost in availing ourselves of it. should it pass unimproved, our situation would become much more difficult. formal war is not necessary. it is not probable it will follow, but the protection of our citizens, the spirit &amp; honor of our country, require that force should be interposed to a certain degree. it will probably contribute to advance the object of peace.  
But the course to be pursued will require the command of means which it belongs to Congress exclusively to yield or to deny. to them I communicate every fact material for their information, &amp; the documents necessary to enable them to judge for themselves. to their wisdom then I look for the course I am to take, and will pursue with sincere zeal that which they shall approve.

‘‘ Hie depredations which bar! been commit­

made it a duty to require from that government  
indemnification for our injured citizens. A

the minifter of that government for foreign af­

to ports of Spain, fhould be paid for bv that  
nation, and that thofe committed by French  
fubjerts, and carried into Spanilh ports, fhould  
remain for further difeuffion. Before this con­  
vention was returned to Spain with our ratifi­  
cation, the transfer of Lonifiana by France to  
the u. States took place: An event as unex­  
pected as difagreeahle to Spain. From that  
moment fhe Termed to change her comfort and  
difpofition towards in. It was firft manifefted  
by her proteft againft the right of France to  
alienate Lonifiana to us, which however was  
form retraced and the right confirmed. Then  
high offence was manifefted at the art of con­  
grefs eftabliffiing a Collcrtion diftrirt on the  
Mobille, although by an authentic declaration  
immediately made, it was exprefsly confined  
to our acknowledged limits ; and fhe now re­  
ftifcd to ratify the convention figned by her own

we would confent to alterations of its terms,

accordingly appointed James Monroe minifter

irtrihntion from the wrong-doer, and at to  
boundary, each parry was to take its own  
ooutfe. That which they have chofen, to pur­  
ine w»H appear from the documents now com*  
muhicatedi They authorize the inference /bat  
it is their intention (o advance on our poffeyfons,  
until they /hall be rcbrefftd be an oppofing force.  
Contidcring that congrefs alone is eonjlitutionally  
ifrve/led with the power of changing our condi­  
tion front fence to war, I have thought it my  
duty to mw,ait their authority for ufiog force in  
any degree which could be avoided. I have  
barely inftrtidted the officers Rationed in the  
neighbourhood of the aggreffions, to protect  
our citizens from violence, to patrolr within  
the borders actually delivered to us, and not to  
goMtit of thtrri, but when neceRary to repel an  
inrn^^w forefeu^&#x27;a citizen or his property :  
dusk’ll*Spa*ith remaining at New-Orlcans are  
vMuit&#x27;ed to* depart without further delay. It  
ought to be noted here that fince the late  
change* in the Rate of affairs in Europe, Spain  
has ordered her cruizers and courts to refpedt  
Our treaty with her.  
The conduct of France, and the part fhe may  
take in the mifundcrftanding9 between the Uni­  
ted States and Spain, are too important to be  
unconfidered. She was prompt and decided in  
her declaration*, that our demands on Spain for  
French fpoliations, carried into Spanifh ports,  
were included in the fettlement between the  
United States and France. She took at once  
the jrround that fhe had acquired no right from  
Spain, and had meant to deliver us none eaft­  
ward of the Iberville : her filence as to the wef­  
tern boundary leaving us to inferf her opinion  
might be avainfi Spain in that quarter. What­  
ever direction (he might mean to give to thefe  
differences, it does not appear that fhe has con­  
templated their proceeding to actual rupture,  
Or that at the date of our laft advices from Paris,  
her government had any fnfpicion of the hof­  
tile attitude Spain had taken here. On the  
contrary we have reafon to believe that fhe  
(France) was difpoftd to efredt a fettlement on  
a plan analogous to what our miniftershad pro­  
pofed.J and I&#x27;o comprehenlive as to remove as  
far as poffihlc the grounds of future collifion  
and controverfy on the Eaftcrn as well as Wcf­  
tern fide of the MiffifGopi.  
The prefent crifisin Europe is favorable for  
preffing fucli a fettlement, and not a moment  
fhould he loft in availing ourfelves of it. Should  
it pafs unimproved, our fituation would be­  
come much more difficult. Formal war is not  
necefta’-y, it is riot probable that it will fol­  
low ; but the protrUior: of our citizens, the fpirit  
and honor of o tr country require th.it force

Blit the courfe to be purfued will require the  
command of means which it belongs to Con­  
grefs exclufively to yield or deny. To them  
I communicate every Fud material for their in­  
formation, and the documents neceflary to en­  
able them to judge for themfelves. To their  
.wfdoin then I look for the courfe I ant to purfue,

v The depredations which had been  
committed on ths commerce of the U.  
S. during a preceding war, by persons  
under the authority Of Spain are suffi­  
ciently known to all. These iii&#x27;ule ft a  
.duty to require from that government  
indemnification for our injured citizens.  
A convention was accordingly entered  
Into between the minister of the U. S. at  
Madrid, and the minister of that govern­  
ment for foreign affairs, by Which it was  
hgreed that spoliations committed by  
Spanish subjects, and carried into ports  
of Spain, should be paid for by that na­  
tion, Sc that those committed by French  
subjects, and carried into Bp?.nisii ports,  
should iemain for further discussion.  
Before this convention w.,s returned to  
Spain with our ratification, the trans­  
fer of Louisiana by France to the \J. S.  
took place : An event as unexpected as  
disagreeable to Spain. From that mo­  
ment she seemed to charge hrr conduct  
and disposition towards us. It was first  
manifested by her protest against the  
right of France to alienate Louisiana to  
us, which however was soon retracted,  
and th« right confirmed. Then high of­  
fence was manifested at the act of Con­  
gress establishing a collection district  
on the Mobile, although by sa authen­  
tic declaration immediate.ly made, it  
was expressly confined to our acknow­  
ledged limits; and ahe now refused to  
ratify the convention signed by her own  
minister under the e\eof hi &gt; sovereign,  
i unless we would consent to alterations  
j of its terms, which would have affected  
I our claims against her spoliations by  
French subjects carried into Spanish  
ports.  
&quot; To obtain justice, as well as to re­  
l store friendship, I thought a special  
mission advisable, and accordingly ap­  
pointed James Monroe minister extra­  
ordinary and plenipotentiary to repair  
to Madrid, and, in conjunction with our  
minister resident there, to endeavor to  
procure a ratification of the former  
convention, and to come to an under­  
standing with Spain, as to boundaries of  
Louisiana. It appeared at once that  
her policy was to reserve herself for e­  
vents, and, in the mean time to keep  
our differenC&#x27; s in an undetermined  
state. This wi&#x27;l be evident from the  
papers now communicated to you. After  
nearly five months ot fruitless endeavor  
to bring them to some definite and! satis­  
factory result, our ministers ended the  
conferences, without having been able  
to obtain in &#x27;enmity for spoliations ~i  
any description, or any satisfaction as to  
the boundaries of Louisiana, other than  
a declaration that we had no rights east­  
ward of the Iberville, and that our line  
to the west waaOOC which would have  
left us bur a string of land on that beak  
ofthe n ippi. Our injured  
citizens were thus Ivis without any pro­  
sptr.t of rttiibution from the wrong-doer,  
and as to boundary, e_ch party was to  
take its own course. &#x27;I&#x27;ll &gt;t which they  
hive eh&#x27;sento pursue will appear from  
thesjocvraeutsaovi&#x27; c- uia»auicat«3»],Thei/  
• i  
  
authorise the inference that It is  
intention te advance on our pos ■ &gt; ion^  
. until they shad fre repressed by an op­  
pnr&#x27;r.g force. Considering that Con­  
gress alone is constitutionally inv&lt;  
with the power of changing ur condi­  
tion from peace to war, 1 have thought  
i&#x27;it my duty to await theft authority for  
using force in any degree which could  
be avoided. 1 have barely instructed  
, the officers stationed in the neighbour­  
hood of the aggressions, to protect our  
citizens from violence, to patrole within  
the borders actually delivered to us,  
i and net to g) out of them, but when ne­  
ces .ary to repel an inroad, or to rescuer  
! a citizen or his property : and the Spa­  
nish remaining at New Orleans are re­  
quired to depart without further delay.  
It ought to be noted here that since the;  
; late change * m the state of ali&#x27;.drs in.  
Europe, Spain has ordered her cruirers  
and courts to respect our treaty with.  
; her.  
j ki The conduct of France, Sc the part  
; she may take in the misunderstandings  
; between the United States and Spain,  
are too Important to be unconsidered.  
j she. was pr &gt;mpt and decided In her de*  
j duration* that our demandsouSpain for  
j French carried into Spanish,  
ports, were included in the settlement  
between tbe U. S.and France.She took  
at once tbe ground that she bad acquir­  
ed no right from Spain, and had meant  
to deliver us none eastward of the I  
ville : her silence as to the. western boon*  
d.u-y leaving us to infer f her opinion  
might be against Spalrtin that quarter.  
Whatever direction she might mem tor  
give to these differences,it does not ap­  
pear that she has contemplated their  
proceeding to actual rupture, or that at  
th.ctlateol our last advices from Paris,  
her government had any suspicion of  
the hosule attitude Spain had taken  
here. On the contrary we have reason  
to believe that she (France) was dispos­  
ed to effect a settlement on a plan ana­  
logous to wh..t our ministers had pro­  
posed, \ and sO comprehensive as to re­  
move as fir as possible the grounds of  
future collision and controversy on the  
Eastern as well as Western bide e£  
the Mississippi.  
&quot; The present crisis In Europe is fa­  
vorable for pressing such a settlement,  
And n&lt;K a moment should be lost in a­  
vailingourselves of it. Should it pass  
unimproved, our situation would be­  
come much mure djfflcalt. Formal war  
is not nvccssary, it is not probable that  
it will follow ; but the protection of our  
citizens, the spirit ami honor of our  
country require that force should b«  
interposed iv a certain degree. It will  
probably contribute to advance the ob­  
ject of peace.  
« But the course to be pursued will  
require the command of means Which­  
it belongs to C.ingress exclusively t»  
yield or deny. To them i communicates  
every fact material for their informa­  
tion, and the documents necessary t»  
enable tuem to judge for themselves*  
T« their wisdom then 1 look for the*  
course i am to pursue, and will pursues  
with sine 4t- zeal that which they shall

** The depredations which had been com-  
mitted on the commerce of the U. S. during  
@ preceding war, by persons under the au-  
thority of Spain, are sufficiently known to  
all. These made it a duty to require from  
that government indemnification fur our in-  
jured citizens. A convention was according-  
ly entered into between the minister of the  
U.S. at Madrid, and the minister of that go-  
verument for foreign affairs, by which it was  
agreed that spoliations committed by Spa-  
nish subjects, and carried into ports of Spain,  
should be paid for by that nation; and that  
those committed by Freneh subjects, aud  
carried into Spanish ports, sheu&#x27;d remain for  
further discussion. Before this convention  
was returned to Spain with our ratification,  
the transfer of Louisiana by France to the  
U.S. took place: An event as unexpected  
as disagreeable to Spain. From that mo-  
ment she seemed tu change her conduct and  
disposition towards us. It was first mani-  
fested by her protest against the right of  
France to alienate Louisiana to us, which  
however was soon retracted, and the right  
confirmed. Then high offence was mani-  
fested at the act of congress establishing a  
collection district on the Mubile, although  
by an authentic deciaration immediately  
made, it was expressly confined to our ac-  
  
Knowledged limits; and she now refused to  
ratify the convention signed by her own mi-  
nister under the eye of his sovereign, unless  
we would conseut to alterations of its terms,  
which would have affected our claims against  
her, for spoliations by French subjects car-  
ried into Spanish ports.  
  
** To obtain justice, as well as to restore  
  
  
  
friendship, I thought a special mission ad-  
visable, and accordingly appointed James  
Monroe minister extraordinary and plenipo-  
tentiary to repair to Madrid, and in con-  
junction with oux minister resident there, to  
endeavour to procure a ratification of the  
former convention aud to come to an under-  
standing with Spain, as to the boundaries of  
Louisiana. It appeared at once that her  
policy was to reserve herself for events, and  
in the mean time to keep our differences in  
an undetermined state. This will be evident  
froin the papers now communicated to you,  
After nearly five months of fruitless endea-  
vour to bring them to some definite and sa-  
tisfactory result, our ministers ended the  
conferences, without having been able to ob-  
tain indemnity for spoliations of any deserip~  
tion,or any satisfaction as to the boundaries of  
Louisiana, other than a declaration that we  
had norights eastward of the Lberville,and that  
our line to the west wasone which would have  
left us but a string of land on that bank of  
the river Missisippi. Our injured citizens  
were thus left without any prospect of retri-  
bution from the wrong doer ; and as to boun-  
dary, each party was to take its own course,  
That which they have chosen to pursue will  
appear from the documents now communi-  
cated. ‘They authorize the inference that it  
is their intention to advance on our posses-  
sions, until they shall be repressed by an op-  
posing force. Considering that congress  
alone is constitutionally invested with the  
power of changing our condition from peace  
to war, I have thought it my duty to await  
their authority for using force in any degree  
which could be avoided, I have barely in-  
structed the officers stationed in the neigh-  
bourhood of the aggressions, to protect our  
citizens from vioience, to patrole within the  
borders actualiy delivered to us, an: not to  
go out of them, but when necessary to repel  
an inroad, or to rescue a citizen or his pro-  
perty: and the Spanish remaining at New-  
Orleans, are required to depart without fur-  
ther delay. It onght to be noted here,  
that since the late change * in the state of  
affairs in Europe, Spain has ordered her  
cruisers and courts to respect our treaty  
with her,  
  
“The conduct of France, and the part  
she may take in the misunderstandings be-  
tween the United States and Spain, are too  
important to be unconsidered, She was  
prompt and decided in her declarations, that  
our demands on Spain for French spoliations  
carried into Spanish ports, were included in  
the settlement between the United States  
and France. She took at once the ground,  
that she had acquired no right from Spain,  
and had meant to deliver us none eastward

ern boundary leaving us to infer + her opi-  
nion might be against Spain in that quarter.  
Whatever direction she might mean to give  
to these differences, it does not appear that  
she has contempiated their proceeding to  
actual rupture, or at the date of our last ad-  
vices from Paris, her government had any  
suspicion of the hostile attitude Spain had  
taken here. On the contrary, we have rea-  
son toh-lieve that she (France) was dispos-  
ed to effect a settiement on a plan analagous  
to what our ministers had proposed {, and  
so comprehensive as to remove as far as pos-  
  
  
  
sible the grounds of future collision and con-  
troversy on the eastern as well as western  
side of the Missisippi.  
  
‘* The present crisis in Europe is favour-  
able for pressing such a settlement, and not  
a moment should be lost in availing ourselves ,  
of it. Should it pass unimproved, our situ- |  
ation would become much more difficult. |  
Formal war is not necessary : it is not pro- |  
bable that it will follow; but the protection  
of our ¢itizens, the spirit and honour of our ,  
country require that force should be interpo- &#x27;

contribute to advance the object of peace.

war, br peVions under the aathority

These made it a duty tofequne Irom

committed by! French subjects, and  
carried into Spanish xorts, should  
remain for further discussion. Be­  
fore this convention wiS returned to  
Spain with our ratification, the trans­  
fer of Louisiana by France to the  
United States took place : An event  
as unexpected as disagreeable to  
Spain. From that moment she seem­  
ed to change her conduct and dispo­  
sition towards us. It was first mani­  
fested by her protest against the right  
of Fiance to alierTate Louisiana to us,  
which however wa soon retracted  
and the righi confirmed. Then hisrh  
offence was manifested at the act of!  
congress establishing a collection d&#x27;s  
  
ttict on the MobiUe, although by an The message with the docu­  
authentic declaration immediately, it ments accompanying it was refer  
  
was eKpiesbly confined to ur ac  
knowledged limits ; and she now re­  
fused to ratify the convention signed  
by her own Minister under the eye  
of his sovereign, unless we would  
consent to alterations of Us terms,  
which would hays affected our claims  
against her, for spoliations by French  
subjects carried into Spanish ports.  
- &quot; To Obtain justice as well as res  
tore friendship, I thought a special  
mission advisable, and accordingly  
.appointed James Monroe, minister  
extraordinary and plenipotentiary to  
repair to Madrid, and, in conjunc.  
to endeavour to procure a ratifica  
tion of the iormer convention and to  
come to an understanding with Soain,  
as to the boundaries of Louisiana.  
It appeared at once that her policy  
was to reserve&#x27; hertelf for events,  
and in&#x27; the mean time to keep our  
amerences m an undetermined state.  
This will be evident from the papers  
now communicated to vou. After  
nearly five months of fruitless endea­  
vor lo bringthem to some definite­  
and satisfactory result, our ministers  
ended the conference, without having  
been able to obtain indemnity for  
spoliations of any description) or any  
satisfaction as to theboundary ofLoa­  
isiana, other than a declaration that  
we had no rights eastward of the  
Iberville, and that our line to the  
west was one -which would have left  
us but a string of land on that bank  
of the Mississippi. Our injured ci­  
tizens were thus! left without any  
prospect of retribution from the wrong  
doer, and as to bouadary, eachpartv  
Uvas to take ita own course. That  
which iney nave cnosen to pursue

“ The depredations which had been com­  
mitted on the commerce of the U. S. during a  
preceding war, by pepfons fu.:der the authori­  
ty of Spain, are fufficicntly, know n to all.  
Thelc made it a duty to require from that  
government iue [unification for our injured  
citizens. A convention was accordingly en­  
tered into between the riinifter of the Dinted  
States at Madrid, and the tniniftcr of that gov­

agreed,tha* fpoilations committed by Spanifh

be paid for by that nation.and thar thofe com­

culffon. Before this convention was returned  
to Spain with our ratification, the transfer ol  
Lotufiaua by France to the United State!  
took place . an event as unexpected a^bii  
agreeable to Spain. From that moment fht  
feemed to change her conduct and dilpefuior  
towards us. It was firft manifefred by iiei  
proteft againft the right of France to aiienatt  
Louifiana to us, which however was foon re­  
tracted and the right coofirmtd- Then higi  
  
offence was oun&amp;fod at the aft of cetigTfcff  
eftablifliiug a colitxlion oil the Mobile diltridf,  
although by an authentic declaration imme­  
diately made, it was exprefsly confined to our  
acknowledged limits ; and fhe now refuied to  
ratify the convention ligncd by her own min­  
ifter under the eye of his fovereign, unlefs he  
would confent to alterations of it# terxns.which  
would have affedfed our claims againrt her for  
fpoilations by French fubjedis carried into  
Spanifh ports.  
“To obtain jurtice as well as to reftore  
friendlliip,( I thought a fpecial miflion advi­  
fablc, and accordingly appointed James Mun­  
roe minifter extraordinary and plenipotentia­  
ry to repair to Madrid,&#x27; and in conjuciion  
with our minifter refident there, to endea­  
vour to procure a ratification of the former  
convention, and to come to an underftanding  
with Spain,as to the boundaries ofLouirtana. j  
It appeared at once that her policy was to re- ,  
ferve herfelf for events, and in the mean time,  
to keep our differences » an undetermined  
date This will be evident -from the pape »  
now communicated to you. After nearly  
five months of fruitlefs endeavour to bring  
them to fome definite and fatisfadfery relult,  
our miniftter ended the conference*, without  
having been able to obtain indemnity fpolia­  
tions of any deserif ticn, or any fatisladlion as to  
the boundaries of Louifiana, other than a dec­  
laration that we had no rights eaftward of  
the Iberville, and that our line to the w’eft  
was one,which would have left t:s but a firing  
of land on that bank of the river Miffiffippi.  
Our injured citizens were thus left without  
any profpedf of retribution from the wrong  
done, and as to boundary, each party was  
to take its own eourfe. That which they  
have chofen to purfue will appear from ifie  
documens now communicated. They auther­  
ife the inference that it is their intention to  
advarceonour pofTeflions,until they fhall lie  
repreffed by an oppofing force. Conrtderiug

from pease or war. I have thought it my du­  
ty to await their authority for ufing force in  
any degree V&#x27;hich could be avoided. I have  
harely inducted the officers Rationed in the ,  
neighbourhood of the aggreflions, to. proleift  
our citizens from violence, to parole within  
the borders actually delivered to us, and uot ,  
to go nut of them, but when neccffary to re­  
pel an inroad, or to refeue a citizen or his  
property: and the Spanilh remaining at  
New-Qrleans are required to depart without!  
further delay.—It might to be noted here, that j  
fince the late change iu the Rate of affairs in t  
Europe, Spain has or lered her crullers and  
courts to refpetS our treaty with her.  
The conduit of France, and the part fhe  
may take in the mifunderfhndfngs between  
t he United States and Spain, are too important  
to be confidcred. She ## prompt and deci­  
ded in her declarations, that ouf demands on  
Spain for Freuch fpoliauons,carried into the’  
■Spanifli ports, were included «1 the fettle­  
ment between the United Spates and France. ;  
She took at once the ground that fhe had ac­  
quired no right from Spain, and had meant  
to deliver ns none tadvva:d of the Iberville ; ,  
her filence a* to the w eft irn boundary, leaving

“ The depredations which had  
been committed on the commerce  
of the U. S. during a preceding  
war, by perfons under the authority  
of Spain, are fufficiendy known to  
all. Thefe made it a duty, to re-  
quire from that government, indem-  
nification for our injured citizens.  
A convention was accordingly en-  
tered into, between the Mimfter of  
the U. S. at Madrid, and the Min-  
ifter of that government for foreign  
affairs ; by which it was agreed,  
that fpoliations committed by Spari-  
ilh fubjedls, and carried into ports  
of Spain, fhould be paid for by that  
■nation, and that thole committed by  
French fubjedls, and carried into  
Spanifh ports, (hould remain for fur-  
ther difcuffion. Before this con  
vention was returned to Spain with  
our ratification, the transfer of  
Louifiana by France to the U. S.  
took place: an event as unexpended,  
as difagreeable to Spain. From that  
moment, file feetned to change her  
conduft and difpofitinn towards us.  
It was firft manifeftedby her proteft  
againft the right of France to alien-  
ate Louiliana to us, which, howev-  
er, was foon retraced, and the right  
confirmed. Then high offence was  
roanifelted at the aft of Congrefs,  
eftablifliing a colleftion diflrifl on  
the Mobile, although by an authen-  
tic declaration immediately made,  
it was exprefsly confined to our ac-  
knowledged limits ; and file now re-  
lufed to ratify the convention, fign-  
ed by her own Minifter, under the  
eye of his Sovereign, u.ilefs we  
would confent to alterations of its  
terms, which would have afftfled  
our claims againfl her fpoliations  
by French fubjefls, carried into  
Spanifh ports.  
  
“ To obtain juftice, as well as to  
reftore friendfliip, I thought a fpeci-  
al million advifable, and accordingly  
appointed James Monroe, Minifter  
Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary,  
to repair to M adrid, and, in conjunc-  
tion with our Minifter refident there,  
to endeavour to procure a ratifica-  
tion of the former convention, and  
to come to an underftanding with  
Spain, as to the boundaries of Lou-  
ifiana. It appeared at once, ihat  
her policy was to relerve herfelf for  
events, and, in the mean time, to  
keep our differences in an undeter-  
mined ft\te. This will be evident  
from the papers now communicated  
to you. After nearly five months of  
fruitltfs endeavour, to bring them  
to fome definite and fatisfaflory re-  
fult, our Minifters ended the con-  
ferreaces, without having been able  
to obtain indemnity for fpoliations  
of any defcription, or any fatisfac-

ana, other than a declaration that  
we had no rights Eaftward of the

ground that (lie had acquired ho

deliver us none Eaftward of the I-

On the sixth of December, the - following  
qbnfidcntial message was received from the  
&#x27; President. &quot; .. . , . &#x27;. . . &#x27;  
&#x27; The depredations which had been com­  
mitted on the commerce of the United States  
during a preceding war, by persons under  
the authority of Spain are sufficiently known  
to all. These made it a duty to require from  
that government indemnification for our in ju­  
red citizens. A convention was accordingly  
entered into between the minister of the Uni­  
ted States at Madrid,&quot;and the minister of that  
government for foreign affairs&#x27; by which it  
was agreed that spoliations committed by Spa  
lush subjects, and carried into ports of Spain,  
should be paid for by that nation, and that  
those committed by French subjects, and car­  
ried into Spanish ports, should remain for fur--ther  
discussion. Before this convention was  
returned to Spain, with our ratification, the  
trap.sferof Louisiana by France to the United  
States took place i An. event as unexpected  
&quot; as disagreeable to Spain. From that moment  
he seemed to change her conductand dispo­  
ition towards us. It was first manifested by  
her protest against the right of France to ali­  
enate Louisiana to us, which however was  
oon retracted, and the right confirmed.  
Then high offence was manifested at the act  
of Congress establishing a collection district  
on the Moaiir, although by an authentic de­  
claration immediately -made, it was express­  
ly confined to our acknowledged limits ; and  
she now refused to ratify The convention sign­  
ed by her own minister under.thc eye of his  
af.vcrtin, unless we would consent to altera­  
tions of its terms, which would have affected  
our claims against her spoliations by French  
subjects carried in&#x27;o Spanish ports.  
M To obtain justice, as well as to restore  
friendship, I thought a special mission advi­  
lable, and accordingly appointed Jamel Motw  
roe minUter extraordinary and&quot; plenipotentia­  
ry to repair to Madrid, and,&#x27; in conjunction  
with our miniiteii.il resident there, to endea  
vour to procure a ratification of the former  
convention, and U come to an understanding  
with Spain, as to boundaries of Louisiana.  
It appeared at once her policy was to reserve  
. herself for events, and, in the mean time to  
keep our difurences in an undotvtmiued  
&#x27; ?ate. This will be evident from the papers  
now communicated to you. After nearh&#x27;iivt  
months of fruitless endeavour tobrinj theta

** The depredations which had been  
committed in the commerce of the U. S.  
during a preceding war, by parsons un­  
der the authority of Spain are sufic lent -  
ly known to all. These made it a duty  
to require from that government indem­

by Spanish subjects, and carried into  
pom of Spain, should be psid lor by that  
nation, and those committed by French  
subjects, and carried into Spanish pom,  
should remain lor further discussion.  
Before this convention was returned to  
Spain with our ratification, the transfer  
of Louisiana by France to the tl. S. took  
place : An event as unexpected as disa­  
greeable to Spain. From that moment  
she seemed to change her conduct and  
disposition towards us. It Was first ma­  
nifested by her protest against the right  
of France to alienate Louisiana to us,  
Which however was soon retracted and  
the right confirmed. Then high offence  
was manifested at the act of congress es­  
tablishing a collection district on the  
Mobjle, although by ao authentic decla­

content to alteration* of its term, which i  
would have affected our claims against  
her, for spoliations by French subjects  
carried into Spanish ports.  
** To obtain justice, as wellas to restore  
friendship, I thought a Special mission  
advisable, and accordingly appointed  
James Monroe minister extraordinary  
and plenipotentiary to repair to Madrid,  
and, in conjunction with our minister  
resident there, to endeavor to procure a  
ratification of the former convention and  
to come to an understanding with Spain,  
as to the boundaries of Louisiana. It  
appeared at once that her policy was to  
reserve herself for events, and, in the  
meap time to keep our differences in ah  
undetermined state. This will be evi­  
dent from the papers now communicat­  
ed to you. After nearly five months of  
fruitless endeavor to bring them to some  
definitive nod satisfactory result, our  
minisura ended the conferences, without  
having been able to obtain indemnity for  
spoliations of any de*cri/tth*&gt; or anv sa­  
tisfaction as to the boundaries of Lou.  
isiaoa, other than a declaration that we  
had no righu eastward of the Iberville,  
and that our line to tka west was one,  
which would lh** left us but a string of  
land on that bank of the river Mississip­  
pi. Our injured citizens were thus left  
without any prospect of retribution from  
  
the #rong»doer, and as to boundary,  
each party was to take its own course*  
That which they haqe chosen to pursue  
will appear from the documents now

invented with the power of changing our  
condition from peace to war, I have  
thought it my duty to await their autho­  
rity for using farce in any degree which­  
could be avoided, t have bar Ay instruct­

remaining at New-Orleans are required  
to depart without farther delay. It ought  
to be noted here that since the late change*  
in the state of affairs in Europe, Spain  
has ordered her cruisers and Courts to  
respect our treaty with hey.  
i * The conduct of Prance, and the part  
she may take in the misunderstanding*  
between the United States and 8paia. are  
too important to be unconsidcred. She  
was prompt and decided in her dcclam*  
lions, that our demands on Spain for  
French spoliations, carried into Spanish  
porn, were included in the settlement  
between the United States and Prance.

meant to deliver us none eastward of the  
Iberville : her silence as to the western  
&#x27; boundary leaving us to inferf her opiui­  
on might be against Spaio in that quarter.  
Whatever direction she might mean to  
give to three differences, it does not ap­  
pear that she has contemplated their pro&gt;  
I cceding to actual rupture, or that at tha  
date of our last advices from Paris, her

11 The depredations which had been committed  
on the commerce of the United States during the  
preceding war, by persons under the authority of  
Spain, are sullkiently known to all, .These made  
it a duty to require from that government indem­  
nification for nor injured citizens. A convention  
was accordingly entered into between the ininis­  
tei of the United Slates at Madrid, and the mi­  
nister of that government for foreign affairs, by  
&#x27;vvhioh it was agreed that spoliations committed  
by Spanish sutiju is, aud carried into ports ol Spain,  
should be paid lor by that nation, and that those  
committed by French subjects, and carried imo  
Spauish ports, should remain for further discussi­  
on. Before this convention was returned to Spain  
with our ratification, the transfer of Louisiana by  
France to the United Statis took place; an event  
as unexpected as disagreeable to Spain, From that  
momeut she seerned to change her conduct nnddts­  
posilion towards us. It was first manifested by  
ber -protest against the right of France to alien­  
ate Louisiana to us, which, however, was soon re­  
tracted and the right confirmed. Then high of­  
fence was manilesied at the act of congress estab­  
lishing a collection district on the Mobile, al­  
though by an autbentick declaration immediately  
made, it was expressly confined to our acknowledg­  
ed limits; and she now refused to ratify the con­  
vention signed by hei own minister, under tb* eye  
of his sovereign, unless we would consent to alter?  
atii&#x27;ns of its terms, which would have effected our  
claims against her, for spoliations by French sub­  
jects carried into Spanish-ports.  
  
ojutain justice, as well as to restore friend­  
ship, 1 thought a special .mission advisable, and  
accordingly appointed Janies Monroe minister e.\­  
tiaordinary and plenipotentiary, to repair to Mad­  
, rid, and, in conjunction with our minister resident  
there, to endeavour to procure the ratification of  
the former con veution and to come to an uuderslan­  
ding with Spain, as to the boundaries of Louisians,  
it appeared at dnee that her policy was to reserve  
herself for events, and, in &gt;*fee mean time to keep  
our differences in an undetermined state. This  
will be evident from the papers now communicated  
to you. Alter&#x27;neprly five months of fruitless en­  
deavour to bring them to some definite and satisfac­  
tory result, our ministers ended the conferences,  
without having been able to obtain indemnity for  
spoliations of any description, or any satisfaction  
as to the boundaries of Louisiana, other than a  
declaration that we had no rights east of the Iber­  
ville, and. I but our line to the west was one, which  
would have left us but a string of land on that bank  
of the river Mississippi. Our injured citizens  
were thus left without an  
from the wrung door, and  
prospect of retribution  
‘ to boundary; each par­  
ty was to take its own course. That which they  
have chosen to pursue will appear from the docu­  
ments now communicated. T’Acy authorise tic in­  
ference that it is their intention to advance oil our  
possessions, until they shall be repressed by an op­  
posing force. Considering that Congress alone is  
const ttutionnlty invested with the power of chang­  
ing our condition front peact to war, I have thought  
.it my duty to 4 wall thr ir authority for-using&#x27;  
•force in any degree which could he avoided.—  
I &quot;knots barely fastiucted the officers stationed

11 The dt predations which had been com*  
mitted on the commerce of the U. States  
during the precedirg war, by persons un­  
der the authority ot Spain, are sufficiently  
known to all. &#x27;1 htse made it a duty to re­  
quire from that government indemnifica­  
tion for our injured citizens. A conven­  
tion was accordingly entered into between  
the minister of the U. States at Madrid,  
and the minister of that government for  
foreign affairs, by which it was agreed  
that spoliations committed by Spanish sub­  
jects, and carried into ports of Spain,  
should be paid for by that nation, and that  
those committed bv French subjects, and  
carried into Spanish ports, should remain  
for lurthcr discussion. Before this con­  
vention was returned to Spain with our ra­  
tification, the transfer of Louisiana by  
France to the U- States took place ; an e«  
vent as unexpected as disagreeable to Spain.  
From that moment she seemed to change  
her conduct and disposition towards us.  
It was first manifested by her protest a­  
gainst the right of France to alienate Lou­  
isiana to us, which, however, was soon  
retracted and the right confirmed. &#x27;I hen  
high offence was manifested at the act of  
congress establishing a collection district  
on the Mobile, although by an authentic  
declaration immediately made, it was ex­  
pressly confined to our acknowledged lim­  
its ; and she now relused to ratify the con­  
vention signed by her own minister, under  
the eye o! his sovereign, unless we would  
consent to alterations of its terms, which  
would have effected our claims against her,  
fur spoliations by French subjects carried  
into Spanish ports. y

in conjunction with our minister resident  
there, to endeavour to procure the ratifi  
cation ot&#x27; the former convention and to  
come to an understanding v/ith Spain, as  
to the boundaries of Louisiana. It ap­  
peared at once that her policy was to re­  
serve herself for events, and in the mean  
time to keep our differences in an undeter­  
mined state. This will be evident from  
the papers now communicated to you.  
After nearly five months of fruitless en­  
deavor to bring them to some definite and  
satisfactory result, our ministers end&lt;-d  
the conferences, without having been able  
to obtain indemnity for spoliations of any  
description^ or any satisfaction as to the  
boundaries of Louisiana, other than a decla­  
ration that we had no rights eastward of  
I the Iberville, and that our line to the west  
was one, which would have left us but a  
string of land on that bark of the river  
  
Mississippi. Our injurtd citizens were  
thus left without any prospect of retribu­  
tion from the wrong door, and as to boun­  
&lt; r«, each party was to take its own course.

i he conduct cf France, and the part  
*he may take in the misunderstandings be­  
tween the Unit d States and Spain, are  
too important to be uni onsidered. She  
was prompt and decided in her declara­  
t ons, that our demands on Spain for  
French spoliations, carried into Spanish  
ports, weir included in the settlement be­  
tween the United Ivans und fiance. She  
took at once the ground that she had ac­  
quired no right hum Spain, and had meant  
to deliver us none eastw rd &lt; f the Iber­  
ville ; her silence as to the western boun­  
dary leaving us to inf r | the opinion  
might be against Spain in that quarter.  
Whatever direction she might mean to  
give to those differences, it dues not ap­  
pear that she has contemplated their pro­  
ceeding to actu \ rupture, or that at the  
date of our l; .t ivi-.es f on Far is her go­

“ I In present crisis in Europe is favora­

States at Madrid and the Minister of that Government for  
Foreign Affairs, by which Spain agreed to pay for the spo­  
liations committed by her subjects--as a similar agreement  
was some years since entered into between Mexico and the  
United States for the like purpose. But before the stipula­  
tions of the treaty with Spain could be fully complied with,  
the cession of Louisiana by France to the United States had  
taken place--as, before Mexico had fulfilled the provisions  
of her treaty, Texas had become, by her own act, one of  
the States of this Union. From the moment of the trans

Confidential Messege of the 9th of December, 1805, Spain  
&quot;seemed to change her conduct and disposition towards  
us,&quot;--as Mexico did after the annexation of Texas. Spain  
first &quot;protested against the right of France to alienate  
Louisiana to us,&quot; as Mexico denied the right of Texas to  
become a member of the American Confederacy. &quot;Then,  
(says Mr. Jefferson,) high offence was manifestedby the  
Spanish Government) at the act of Congress establishing a  
collection district on the Mobile;&quot; and she finally &quot;refu.

the United States and Mexico. But although she received,  
she trifled with him. &quot;It appeared at once (says Mr. Jef­  
ferson) that her policy was to reserve herself for events,  
and, in the mean time, to keep our differences in an unde­  
termined state.&quot; Thus matters remained for fire months,  
during which period Mr. Monroe was engaged in fruitless  
efforts to bring them to a definite result- and at the end of  
that time he &quot;ended the conference, without having been  
able to obtain indemnity for spoliations of any description,  
or any satistaction as to the bounduries of Louisiana.&quot;  
Mr. Jefferson, in his Confidential Message, to Congress,  
before which he deemed it his duty to lay these facts, for  
its judgment and action, by which his own was to be di­  
rected and controlled, said: &quot;Our injured citizens were  
thus left without any prospect of retribution from the  
wrong-doer; and as to toundury, each party was to take its  
own course&quot;--as in the case of Mexico and the United  
States in 1846. But there arises here an essential difference  
in the relative attitude of Mexico and Spain towards us;  
for while Mexico threatened no aggressive movement, and  
seemed content that the boundary and all other questions  
in dispute should remain for the present untouched, Spain  
intimated her intention, as Mr. Jefferson informed Con­  
gress, &quot;to adpance on our postessions until they shall be  
repressed by an opposing force.&quot; Nevertheless, with thi
