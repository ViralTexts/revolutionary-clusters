Your favor of the 24th of March written in Cypher, never got to my hands until the 10th instant at Mount Vernon; nor were the contents of it known to me until my arrival in this City on the 21st. For the information contained in it, and your attention thereto; I offer you my best thanks.  
Having no clue by which to discover the fact, I am very much at a loss to conjecture by what means a private letter of mine, written to a friend—and sent by an American Vessel should have got into the hands of the French Directory. I shall readily acknowledge however, that the one you allude to, directed to Mr Gouvr Morris was a long &amp; confidential one; but I deny that there is any thing contained in it that the French  
  
Government could take exception to, unless the expression of an ardent wish that the United States might remain in Peace with all the World—taking no part in the disputes of any part of it, should have produced this effect. Giving it as my further opinion that the sentiments of the mass of the Citizens in this country were in unison with mine.  
Confidential as this letter was expected to be, I have no objection to its being seen by any body; and there is certainly some mistake in saying I had no copy thereof when there is a press one now before me, in which I discover no expression that in the eye of liberality &amp; candour would be deemed objectionable.  
To understand the scope &amp; design of my letter properly, and to give it a fair interpretation, it is necessary to observe (as will appear by the contents of it) that it was written in answer to very long ones from the Gentleman to whom it was Addressed; which contained much political information of the state of things in different parts of Europe; and related among others, the substance of a conversation in which he, and Lord Grenville, as private Gentlemen had just been engaged, and in which it was observed by the latter, that if they were to judge from the publications in this country, the disposition of it was unfriendly to Great Britain; but in free countries he could readily account for such publications: However, that there was one which wore a more serious aspect, as indicative of the sense of the government; and alluded to Colo. Innes’s report of his proceedings in Kentucky.  
In my noticing this part of Mr Morris’s communication I tell him, that with respect to the Publication of that report it was an unauthorised act, and declared by that Gentleman as soon as he saw it in the Gazettes to have been done incorrectly; and that, with respect to the temper of the People of the United States, as it respected Great Britain, his Lordship ought not to be surprized, if it appeared disturbed &amp; irritated, after the sense of the government had been so often expressed in strong remonstrances against the conduct of their Indian Agents—Privateersmen—Impressment of our Seamen—Insults of their Ships of War &amp;ca &amp;ca.—Adding, that it afforded us very litle satisfaction, their disclaiming these as unauthorised Acts (which the British Administration had done in some instances) while the actors were suffered to go unpunished. I dwell chiefly, and fully on this part of his letter; and reminded him of the  
  
indifference with which the advances of the United States, to form a Commercial Treaty with Great Britain, as well since as before the establishment of their present government had been received—and concluded by saying that a liberal policy towards us (though I did not Suppose sentiments of that sort from me to a member of the British Administration would have much weight) was the only road to a perfect reconciliation—and that, if he should again converse with Lord Grenville on this Subject he was at liberty unofficially to express these as my sentiments.  
Thus, Sir, you have the substance, candidly related, of a letter which you say, you have been told by a person “who has read it, has produced an ill effect” when, in my opinion, the contrary (viewing it in the light of an unreserved and confidential communication) ought to have been produced. For I repeat it again, that unless my pacific disposition was displeasing, nothing else could have given umbrage by the most rigid construction of the letter; or that will shew in the remotest degree any disposition on my part to favor the British interest in their dispute with France.  
My conduct in public and private life, as it relates to the important struggle in which the latter Nation is engaged has been uniform from the commencement of it, and may be summed up in a few words. That I have always wished well to the French Revolution. That I have always given it as my decided opinion that no Nation had a right to intermeddle in the internal concerns of another—That every one had a right to form, and adopt whatever Government they liked best to live under themselves—and that if this country could consistently with its engagements, maintain a strict Neutrality and thereby preserve Peace, it was bound so to do, by motives of Policy—Interest—and every other consideration that ought to actuate a People situated and circumstanced as we are; already deeply in Debt, and in a convalescent state from the struggle we have been engaged in ourselves.  
On these principles I have uniformly and steadily proceeded—bidding defiance to calumnies calculated to sow the Seeds of distrust in the French Nation, and to excite their belief of an influence possessed by Great Britain in the Councils of this country—than which nothing is more unfounded or injurious; the object of its pacific conduct being truly deliniated above.

PHILADELPHIA, 25th August, 1796.  
  
DEAR Sire: Your favor of 24th of March, written in  
cypher, never got to my hands until the 10th inst. at  
Mount Vernon, nor were contents known to me  
until my arrival in this city on 2lst. For  
information contained in it, and your attention  
thereof, I offer you my _ best thanks. Having no  
clue by which to discover the fact | am very much at  
a loss to conjecture by whut means a private letter  
of mine, written toa friend—and sent by an American  
vessel—should have fallen into the hands of the  
French directory. I shall readily acknowledge, how-  
ever, that the one you allude to, directed to Gouver-  
neur Morris,;was a long contidential one, but I deny  
that there is anything contained in it that the French  
Government could take exception to, unless the ex-  
pression of an ardent wish that the United States  
might remain at peace with all the world, giving it as  
my further opinion that the sentiments of the mass of  
the citizens of this country were in unison with mine.  
Confidential as this letter was expected to be, I have no  
objection to its being seen by anybody, and there is  
certainly some mistake in saying I had no copy thereof  
when there is a press one now before me, in which I  
discover no expression that in the eye of liberality and  
candor would be deemed objectionable.  
  
To understand the scope and design of my letter  
properly and to give it a fuir interpretation, it is neces-  
sary to observe (as will appear by the contents of it)  
that it was written in answer to a very long  
ones from the gentleman to whom it was ad-  
dressed, which contained much political in-  
formation of the state of things in different  
parts of Europe, and related among others the sub-  
stance of conversation in which he and Lord Grenville,  
as private, had just been engaged, and in which was  
observed by the latter that, if they were to judge  
from publications in this country, the disposi-  
tion was unfriendly to Great Britain, but in free  
countries he could readily account for such publica-  
tions. However, there was one which wore more  
serious aspect  
port of his  
  
and alluded to Coi. Innes’s_ re-  
proceedings in Kentucky. In my  
noticing this part of Mr. Morris’s commun!-  
eation I told that with respect to the  
publication of that revort it was an unauthorized act  
and was so declared by that gentleman as soonas he  
saw it in the Gazetteto have been done incorrectly;  
and that with respect to the temper of the people of  
the United Stntes as respected Great Britain,  
his lordship ought not to be surprised if it  
appeared disturbed and irritated, as the sense of the  
Government had been so often expressed in strong  
remonstrances against the conduct of their Indian  
agents, privateersmen, impressment of our sea-  
men, insults of their ships of war, &amp;¢e., adding  
that it afforded us very little satisfaction,  
this disclaiming these as unauthorized acts,  
(which British administration has do e in some in-  
stances) while the actors were suffered to go unpun-  
ished. I dwelt cniefly and fully on this part of  
his letter, and reminded him of the_ inéiffer-  
ence with which advances of United States to  
form commercial treaty with Great Britain, as well  
since as before the establishment of the present Gov-  
ernment, had been received, and concluded by saying  
that liberal policy toward us (though I did not  
suppose sentiments of that sort from me to a  
member of the British administration would have  
much weight) was the only road to perfect reconcilia-  
tion, and that if he should again converse with Lord  
Granville on this subject he was at liberty, unofficially,  
to express these my sentiments.  
  
Thus, Sir, you have the substance candidly related of  
a letter which you say you have been told by a person  
“who has read it has produced ill effect,” when, in mv  
opinion, the contrary (viewing it in the light of  
In unreserved and confidential communication, ought  
to have been produced. Forlrepeat it avain, unless  
my pacific disposition was displeasing nothing else  
could have given umbrage by the most rigid constmuc-  
tion of the letter, or thut will show in the  
remotest degree any disposition on my _ part  
to favor British interests in their dispute with France.  
My conduct in public life as it relates to the im-

PHILADELpHIA, 2th August, 1796.  
DEAR SIR--Your favor of 24th of March,  
written in cipher, never got to my hands  
until the 10th instant, at Mount Vernon,  
nor were the contents known to me until  
my arrival in this city on the 21st instant.  
For in&#x27;ormation contained in it, and your  
attention thereof, I offer you my best  
thanks. Having no clew by which to dis­  
cover the fact, I am very much at a loss  
to conjecture by what means a private let  
ter of mine, written to a friend, and sent  
by an American vessel, should have fallen  
into the hands of the French directory. I  
shall readily acknowledge, however, that  
the one you allude to, directed to Gov.  
Morris, was a long confidential one, but I  
deny that there is anything containe in  
it that the French Government could take  
exception to, unless the expression of an  
ardent wish that the United States might  
remain at peace with all the world, giving  
it as my further opinion that the senti­  
ment of the citizens of this country were  
in unison with mine. Confidential as this  
letter was expected to be, I have no ob­  
jection to its being seen by anybody, and  
there is certainly some mistake in saving  
I had no copy thereof when there is a  
press one now before me, in which I dis­  
cover no expression that in the eye of  
liberality and candor would be deemed  
objectionable.  
To undersand the scope and design of  
my letter properly and give it a fair inter  
pretation, it is necessary to observe (as  
will appear by the contents of it) that it  
was written in answer to a very long one  
from the gentleman to whom it was ad  
dressed, which contained much political in­  
formation of the State of things in different  
parts of Europe, and related among others  
the substance of conversation in which he  
and Lord Grenville, as private, had just  
been engaged, and in which was observed  
by the latter that, if they were to judge  
from publications in this country, the dis­  
position was uinfriendly to Great Britain,  
but in free countries he could readily ac­  
count for such publications. However,  
there was one which wore more serious  
aspect, and alluded to Col. Innes&#x27;s report  
of his proceedings in Kentucky. In my  
noticing this part of Mr. Morris&#x27;s com­  
munication I told him that with respect to  
the publication of that report it was an  
unauthorized act, and was so declared by  
that gentleman as soon as he saw it in the  
Gasette, to have been done incorrectly;  
and that with respect to the temper of  
the people of the United States as respect­  
ed Great Britain, his lordship ought not  
to be surprised if it appeared disturbed  
and irritated, as the sense of the Govern  
ment had been so often expressed in strong  
remonstrances against the conduct of  
their Indian agent, privateersmen, im-  
pressment of our seamen, insults of their  
ships of war, etc., adding that it afforded  
us very little satisfaction, this disclaiming  
these as unauthorized acts, which British  
Administration has done in some in-  
tances, while the actors were suffered to  
mnpnnibed. I dwelt chiefly and fully  
go tnnuinof af letter, and reminded  
on this part of histh which ad  
him of the indifference with which ad  
vances of the United States to torn. ,  
mercial treaty with Great Britain, as wen  
Since as before the establishment of the  
present governfftent, had been received,  
and concluded by saying that liberal  
policy toward us, though I did not sup­  
pose sentiments of that sort from me to a  
member of the British administration  
would have much weight, was the only  
road to perfect reconciliation, and that if  
he should again converse with Lord Gran­  
ville, on this subject he was at liberty,  
unofficlally, to express these, my senti­  
ments sir, you have the substance can­  
didly related of a letter which you say you  
have been told by a person &quot;who has read  
it has preduced ill effect, when, in my  
opinion, viewing it in the light of unre­  
served and confidential communication,  
ought to have been produced. For I re­  
peat it again, unless my pacific disposr­  
tion was displeasing nothing else could  
have given umbrage by the most rigid  
construction of the letter, or that will  
show in the remotest degree any disposi­  
tion on my part to favor British interests  
in their dispute with France. My con­  
duct in public life as it relates to the im­  
portant struggle in which the latter nation  
is engaged has been uniform from the  
commencement of it, and may be summed  
up in a few words; that I have always  
wished well to the French revolution,  
that I have always given it as my decided  
opinion that no nation had a right to  
intermeddle in the internal concerns  
of another, that every one had a  
right to form and adopt whatever govern­  
ment they liked best to live under them­  
selves, and that if this country could  
consistently with its engagements main­  
tain strict neutrality and thereby pre­  
serve pea e, it was best to do so, by mo­  
tives of policy, interest and every other  
consideration that ought to actuate people  
situated and circumstanced as we are,  
ready deeply in debt and in a convalescent  
state from the struggles we have been en­  
gaged in ourselves. On these principles I  
have uniformly and steadily proceeded,  
bidding defiance to calumnies calculated  
to sow seeds of distrust in the French  
nation and excite their belief of the influ­  
ence possessed by Great Britain in the  
counsels of this country, than which noth­  
ing is more unfounded or injurious, the  
object of its pacific conduct being truly de­  
lineated above. I am, dear sir, your obe  
dient and humble servant.
