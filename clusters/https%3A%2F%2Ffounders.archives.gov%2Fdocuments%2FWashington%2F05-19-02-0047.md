Sir,  
Philadelphia 21st of October 1795  
  
In several of the public Gazettes I had read your note to the Editor of the Philadelphia Gazette, with an extract of a letter addressed to me of the 8th instant; but it was not until yesterday, that the letter itself was received.  
It is not difficult, from the tenor of that letter, to perceive what your objects are; but that you may have no cause to complain of the withholding any paper (however private &amp; confidential) which you shall think necessary in a case of so serious a nature, I have directed that you should have the inspection of my letter of the 22d of July agreeably to your request—and you are at full liberty to publish, without reserve, any, and every private &amp; confidential letter I ever wrote you; nay more—every word I ever uttered to, or in your presence, from whence you can derive any advantage in your vindication.  
I grant this permission, inasmuch as the extract alluded to, manifestly tends to impress on the public mind an opinion that something has passed between us which you should disclose with reluctance; from motives of delicacy which respect me.  
You know, Sir, even before the Treaty was laid before the Senate, that I had difficulties with respect to the commercial part of it; with which I professed to be the least acquainted; and that I had no means of acquiring information thereon without disclosing its contents: not to do which until it was submitted to the Senate, had been resolved on. You know too, that it was my  
  
determination previous to this submission, to ratify the Treaty if it should be so advised, and consented to by that body; and that the doubts which afterwards arose, &amp; were communicated to Mr Hammond, proceeded from more authentic information of the existence of what is commonly called the Provision order of the British government. And finally, you know the grounds on which my ultimate decision was taken; as the same were expressed to you, the other Secretaries of departments and the late Attorney general, after a thorough investigation &amp; consideration of the subject, in all the aspects in which it could be placed.  
As you are no longer an Officer of the government, and propose to submit your vindication to the Public, it is not my desire, nor is it my intention to receive it otherwise than through the medium of the Press. Facts you cannot mistake. and if they are fairly and candidly stated, they will invite no comments.  
The extract of your letter to me, dated the 8th instant, being published in all the gazettes, I request that this letter may be inserted in the compilation you are now making; as well to shew my disposition to furnish you with every means I possess towards your vindication, as that I have no wish to conceal any part of my conduct from the public. That public will judge, when it comes to see your vindication, how far, and how proper it has been for you, to publish private &amp; confidential communications—which, oftentimes have been written in a hurry, and sometimes without even copies being taken. And it will, I hope, appreciate my motives, even if it should condemn my prudence, in allowing you the unlimited license herein contained.

GEO. TAYLOR, jua. Ch. Clk.  
Edmund Randolph, Efg. I  
  
To Edmund Randolph, Efg.  
Sir, |  
In several of the public Gazettes I  
have read your note to the Editor of  
the Philadeiphia Gazette, with an  
extraét of a letter addrefled to me of  
the Bth instant ; but it was not until  
yesterday that the letter itlelf was re­  
ceived.  
It is not difficult, from the tenor of  
that letter, to perceive what vour  
objects are ; but thar you may . have  
no cause to complain of the with­  
holding any paper (however private  
and confidential) which you fhail  
think necessary in a case of so serious  
a nature, I have direfted that youn  
should have the infpetion of my let­  
ter of the 22d of July, agreeable to  
your request :—and you are at fuoll  
liberty to publith without reserve  
any and every private and confiden­  
tial letter I ever wrote you ;. nay  
more—every word [ ever uttered to,  
orin your presence, from whence  
you can derive any advantage in your  
vindication. :  
  
I grant this permission inalmuch  
as the extra@ alluded to, manifeitly  
tends to impress on the public mind  
an opinion, that something has pafled  
between us which you should difcloie  
with relu@ance ; from motivss of  
~delicacy which refpeé&amp;t me.  
~ You know, Sir, even before the  
treaty was laid before the Senate  
that [ had difficulties with refpe&amp; to  
the commercial part of it ; with  
which [ profeffed to be the least ac­  
quainted ; and that I had no ‘means  
of acquiring information thereon  
without disclosing its contents,—not  
to do which until it was submitted  
to the Senate, had been refo!ved on—  
You know too, that it was my deter­  
mination previous to this&#x27;fubmiffion,  
to ratify the treaty if it should be so  
advised, and consented to by that  
body ;—and that the doubts” which  
afterwards arose, and were commu­  
nicated to Mr. Hammond, proceeded  
from more authentic information of  
the existence of what is. commonly  
called the prevision order of the  
Britith government.——And finally,  
you know the grounds on which my  
ultimate decision was taken ;as the  
fame were exprefled tb‘;iouy,.ﬁthe other  
secretaries of departments, and the  
late attorney general after a thorough  
investigation and consideration of the  
fubje&amp;, in all the afpe&amp;ts in which it  
could be placed. ol  
As you are no longer an officer of  
the government, and propose to sub­  
mit your vindication to the public,  
it is not my desire, nor is it my in-  
  
tention to receive it, otherwise than  
through the medium of the press.—  
Faf@ls you cannot mistake—and if  
they are fairly and candidly stated,  
they will invite no comments.  
- The extra&amp; of your letter to me,  
dated the Bth instant, being publish­  
ed in all the Gazettes, I request that  
this letter may be inserted in the  
coinpilation you are now making ;—  
as well to shew my disposition to  
furnifff you with every means I pof­  
{efs towards vour vindication; as that  
I bave no wifth to conceal any part  
of my condu&amp; from the public.—  
That public will judge when it comes  
to fee your vindication, how far, and  
how proper it has been for you to  
publish private and confidential com­  
munications—which oftentimes have  
been written in a hurry, and some­  
times without even copies being  
taken.— And it will, I hope, apvreci­  
ate my motives, even if it thould con­  
degn my prudence in allowing you  
the unlimited licence herein contain­

been obliged to leave the cabinet under suspicious  
circumstances, and when, for the purpose of vindi­  
cating himself, he had attempted to tlirow some

General Washington wrote to him thus, at Philadel­
