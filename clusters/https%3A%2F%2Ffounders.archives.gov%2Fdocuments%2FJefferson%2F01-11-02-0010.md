ayles’s debt to you, and to a debt of mine to Kippen &amp; co. of Glasgow. Being anxious to begin the paiment of these two debts, and finding that it would be too long postponed if the residuary ones were to be paid merely from the annual profits of the estate, a number of slaves have been sold, and I have lately received information from Messrs. Eppes and Lewis that the proceeds of that sale, with the profits of the estate to the end of 1781. would pay off the whole of the residuary debts. As we are now therefore clear of embarassment to pursue our principal object, I am desirous of arranging with you, such just and practicable conditions as will ascertain to you the terms at which you will receive my part of your debt, and give me the satisfaction of knowing that you are contented. What the laws of Virginia are, or may be, will in no wise influence my conduct. Substantial justice is my object, as decided by reason, and not by authority or compulsion.  
The first question which arises is as to the article of interest. For all the time preceding the war, and all subsequent to it, I think it reasonable that interest should be paid; but equally unreasonable during the war. Interest is a compensation for the use of money. Your money in my hands is in the form of lands and negroes. From these, during the war, no use, no profits could be derived. Tobacco is the article they produce. That can only be turned into money at a foreign market. But the moment it went out of our ports for that purpose, it was captured either by the king’s ships or by those of  individuals. The consequence was that tobacco, worth from twenty to thirty shillings the hundred, sold generally in Virginia during the war for five shillings. This price it is known will not maintain the labourer and pay his taxes. There was no surplus of profit then to pay an interest. In the mean while we stood insurers of the lives of the labourers and of the ultimate issue of the war. He who attempted during the war to remit either his principal or interest, must have expected to remit three times to make one paiment; because it is supposed that two out of three parts of the shipments were taken. It was not possible then for the debtor to derive any profit from the money which might enable him to pay an interest, nor yet to get rid of the principal by remitting it to his creditor. With respect to the Creditors in Great Britain they mostly turned their attention to privateering, and, arming the vessels they had before emploied in trading with us, they captured on the seas, not only the produce of the farms of their debtors, but of those of the whole state. They thus paid themselves by capture more than their annual interest and we lost more. Some merchants indeed did not engage in privateering. These lost their interest but we did not gain it. It fell into the hands of their countrymen. It cannot therefore be demanded of us. As between these merchants and their debtors it is the case where, a loss being incurred, each party may justifiably endeavor to shift it from himself. Each has an equal right to avoid it. One party can never expect the other to yeild a thing to which he has as good a right as the demander. We even think he has a better right than the demander in the present instance. This loss has been occasioned by the fault of the nation which was creditor. Our right to avoid it then stands on less exceptionable ground than theirs. But it will be said that each party thought the other the aggressor. In these disputes there is but one umpire, and that has decided the question where the world in general thought the right laid.  
Besides these reasons in favor of the general mass of debtors, I have some peculiar to my own case. In the year 1776. before a shilling of paper money was issued, I sold lands to the amount of £4200 in order to pay these two debts. I offered the bonds of the purchasers to your agent Mr. Evans, if he would acquit me, and accept of the purchasers as debtors, in my place. They were as sure as myself. Had he done it, these debts, being turned over to you, would have been saved to you by the treaty of peace. But he declined it. Great sums of paper money were afterwards issued. This depreciated, and paiment was made me in this money when  it was but a shadow. Our laws do not entitle their own citizens to require repaiment in these cases, tho the treaty authorizes the British creditor to do it. Here then I lost the principal and interest once. Again, Ld. Cornwallis encamped 10. days on an estate of mine at Elk-island, having his headquarters in my house. He burned all the tobacco houses and barns on the farm, with the produce of the former year in them. He burnt all the inclosures, and wasted the feilds in which the crop of that year was growing (it was the month of June). He killed or carried off every living animal, cutting the throats of those which were too young for service. Of the slaves he carried away thirty. The useless and barbarous injury he did me in that instance was more than would have paid your debt, principal and interest. Thus I lost it a second time. Still I will lay my shoulder assiduously to the paiment of it a third time. In doing this however I think yourself will be of opinion I am authorized in justice to clear it of every article not demandeable in strict right. Of this nature I consider interest during the war.  
Another question is as to the paper money I deposited in the treasury of Virginia towards the discharge of this debt. I before observed that I had sold lands to the amount of 4200£ before a shilling of paper money was emitted, with a view to pay this debt. I received this money in depreciated paper. The state was then calling on those who owed money to British subjects to bring it into the treasury, engaging to pay a like sum to the creditor at the end of the war. I carried the identical money therefore to the treasury, where it was applied, as all the money of the same description was to the support of the war. Subsequent events have been such that the state cannot, and ought not to pay the same nominal sum in gold or silver which they received in paper, nor is it certain what they will do. My intention being, and having always been, that, whatever the state decides, you shall receive my part of your debt fully, I am ready to remove all difficulty arising from this deposit, to take back to myself the demand against the state, and to consider the deposit as originally made for myself and not for you.  
These two articles of interest and paper money being thus settled, I would propose to divide the clear proceeds of the estate (in which there are from 80. to 100 labouring slaves) between yourself and Kippen &amp; co., two thirds to you and one third to them: and that the crop of this present year 1787 shall constitute the first paiment. That crop you know cannot be got to the warehouse completely till May of the next year and I suppose that three  months more will be little enough to send it to Europe, or to sell it in Virginia and remit the money. So that I could not safely answer for placing the proceeds in your hands till the month of August, and so annually every August afterwards till the debt shall be paid. It will always be both my interest and my wish to get it to you as much sooner as possible, and probably a part of it may always be paid some months sooner. If the assigning the profits in general terms may seem to you too vague, I am willing to fix the annual paiment at a sum certain. But that I may not fall short of my engagement, I shall name it somewhat less than I suppose may be counted on. I shall fix your part at four hundred pounds sterling annually. And as you know our crops of tobacco to be incertain, I should reserve a right if they fall short one year, to make it up the ensuing one, without being supposed to have failed in my engagement. But every other year at least all arrearages shall be fully paid up.  
My part of this debt of Mr. Wayles’s estate being one third, I should require that in proportion as I pay my third, I shall stand discharged as to the other two thirds, so that the paiment of every hundred pounds shall discharge me as to three hundred pounds of the undivided debt. The other gentlemen have equal means of paying, equal desires, and more skill in affairs. Their parts of the debt therefore are at least as sure as mine: and my great object is, in case of any accident to myself, to leave my family uninvolved with any matters whatever.  
I do not know what the balance of this debt is. The last account current I saw was before the war, making the whole balance, principal and interest somewhere about nine thousand pounds: and after this there were upwards of four hundred hogsheads of tobacco and some paiments in money to be credited. However this settlement can admit of no difficulty: and in the mean time the paiments may proceed without affecting the right of either party to have a just settlement.  
Upon the whole then I propose that on your part you relinquish the claim to interest during the war, say from the commencement of hostilities April 19. 1775. to their cessation April 19. 1783. being exactly eight years: and that in proportion as I pay my third I shall be acquitted as to the other two thirds. On my part I take on myself the loss of the paper money deposited in the treasury, I agree to pay interest previous and subsequent to the war, and oblige myself to remit to you for that and the principal four hundred pounds sterling annually, till my third of the whole debt  shall be fully paid; and I will begin these paiments in August of the next year.  
If you think proper to accede to these propositions, be so good as to say so at the foot of a copy of this letter. On my receipt of that, I will send you an acknowlegement of it, which shall render this present letter obligatory on me. In which case you may count on my faithful execution of this undertaking.  
I have the honour to be with great respect Sir Your most obedient &amp; most humble servant,

ritifh debts were in full force ; of courfe the wri-  
ter could have then beea influeuced by no fear of coerci-  
on, as to the payment.—You will be pleafed to give  
this extract a place in your paper; it will ferve to con-  
vince the world how grofily and waatonly:this virtuous  
patriot has been traduced.  
  
Extra&amp;t from a letter; dated Paris, January 5, 1787,  
written by Thomas Fefferfon, to a Britifh creditor of  
Mr. Wayles, whofe daughter Mr. Fefferfon mar-  
  
ried.  
  
Afver expreffing his anxiety to begin the payment of the  
debt on the part of Mr. Wayles, he proceeds :  
  
os I AM defirous of arranging Wi  
practicable conditions as will4 ¢n to you the terms  
at which you will receive my part your debt and give  
me the fatisfaction of knowing that you are centented.  
What the laws of Virginia are, or may be, will in no wife  
influence my conduét.. Subflantialjuflice is my objeét,  
as decided by reafon and not by authority or compul-  
fion. :  
© The firit queftion which arifes is as_to. the articke of  
intereft. For all the time preceding the war, and all  
fubfequent to it, I think it reafonable that intereft fhould  
be paid ; but equally unreafonable during the war. Intereft  
  
you fuch jaft and  
  
is a compenfation for the ufe of money... .Your ‘money }-  
  
in my hands is in the form of lands. negroes. From  
thefe, during the war, no ufe, no profits, could be derived,  
Tobacco is the article they produce. That can.only be  
turned into money at a foreign market.—But the moment  
it went out of our ports for that purpofe, it was captured  
either by the king’s fhips or by thofe ofindividuals, The  
confequence was, that tobacco, worth from twenty to thir-  
ty fhillings the hundred, fold generally in Virginia during  
the war for five fhillings.. This price it is known will not  
maintain the labourer and pay his taxes. There was no  
furplus of profit then to pay an intereft, In the mean  
while we flood infurers of the lives of the labourers and of  
the ultimate iffue of the war. He who attempted during  
the war to remit cither his principle or intereft, muft have  
expetted to remit three times to make. one payment ; be-  
caufe it is fuppofed that two out of three parts of the  
fhipments were taken. It was not pollible then for the  
debtor to derive any profit from che money which might  
enable him to pay an interell, nor yet to get rid of the  
principal by remitting it to his creditor, With refpeat  
to the creditors in Great Britain, they moftly turned their  
attention to privateering, and arming the veflels they  
had before employed in trading with us, they captured on  
the feas, not only the produce of the farms. of their debr-  
ors, but of thofe of the whoie flate.—They thus paid  
themfelves by capture more than their annual intereft, and  
we loft more. Some merchants indeed did not engage in  
privateering, Thefe loft their interell. But we did not  
gain it.—Ic fell into the hands of their countrymen. It  
cannot therefore be demanded of us.—As between thefe  
merchants and their debiors it is the cafe, where a lofs bein  
incurred,-cach party may juftifiably endeavour to fhift  
it from himfelf. Each bas an equal right to avoid it.  
One party can never expel the other to yield a thing to  
which he has as good a right as the demander, We even  
think he has a better right than the demander in the prefent  
inflance. Thislofs has been occafioned by the fault of the  
nation which was creditor, Our right io avoid it then  
flands on lefs exceptionaole ground than theirs, But it  
will be faid that each party thought the other the aggreilor.  
In thefe difputes there is but one umpire, and that has  
decided the queftion where the world in general thought  
the right laid.  
 Befides thefe reafons in favour of the general mafs  
of debtors, I have fome peculiar io my own cafe. Io the  
year 17706, beforea flilling of paper money was iffued.  
I fold lands to the amount of 42001 in erder to pay thefe  
twodebis. I offered the bonds to your ageni, Mr. Evans,  
if he would acquit me, and accept of the purchafers as  
debtors, in my no They were as fure as myfelf. Had  
he done it, thefe debtors being ‘urned over to you, would  
have been faved to you by the treaty of peace. But he  
deciinedit. Great fums of paper money were afierwards  
ifued. This depreciated, and payment was made me in  
this money when it was but a fhaduw. Our laws do nox  
enttle their own citizens to require repayment in thefe  
  
  
  
cafes, though the treaty authorifes the Brith creditors to de  
it. Here then I loft the principal and intereft at once.  
Again, lord Cornwallis encamped ten days onan eftate of  
mine—at Elk ifland, having his head quarters in my  
houfe—he burnt all the tobacco houfes and barns on the  
farm, with the produce of the former year in them. He  
burnt all the inclefures, and wafted the fields in which the  
crop of that year was growing, (it was the month of June),  
he killed or carried off every living animal, cutting the  
throats of thofe which were too young for fervice. Of  
the flaves he carried off thirty. The ufeleis and barbarous  
injury he did me in that inilance, was more than would  
have paid your debt, principal and intereft.. Thus: I loft  
ita ced time. Sull-I will lay my thoulder afiduoufly  
to the payment of ita third time, . In doing this however  
I think yourfelf will be of opinion I am authonzed in juftice  
to clear it of every article not demandable upon ftné right.  
Of this nature I confider interef during the war.  
  
*«¢ Another queftion is as to the paper money I depofited  
in the treafury of Virginia cowards the difcharge. of ihis  
debt. I before obferved that I had fold lands to the a-  
mount of 4200I. before a fhilling of paper money was  
emitted, with a view to pay this debt, I received’ this  
money in depreciated paper. “The State was then calling  
on thofe who owed money to Briuth fubjeéts to bring it  
intothe treafury, engaging to pay a like fum to the credi-  
tor at theend of the war. I-carried the identical money  
therefore to the treafury, where it was applied, as all the  
money of the fame defeription was, to the fupport of the  
war. Subfequent events have been fuch thatthe State can-  
not, and ode not, topay the fame nominal fum tn gold  
or filver, which they-received in paper ; nor is it certain  
what they will do. “My intention being, and having. al-  
ways been, that, whatever-the State decides, you fhall re-  
ceive my part of your debt fully, I am ready to remove all  
difficulty arifing from this depofit, to take back to myfelf  
the demand againft the State, andto confider the depofits as  
originally oh for myfelf and not for you.  
  
«« Thefe two articles of intereit and paper moncy being  
thus fettled, I would propofe to divide the clear proceeds of  
the eflate (in which there are from 80 to 100__ labouring  
flaves) between yourfelfand Kepper &amp; Co. two thirds to  
you and one third to them: and that the crops of his pre-  
fent year 1787, fhall conftitute the firlt payment. That  
crop you know cannot be got to the ware houfc completely  
till May of the next year ; and fuppofe that three months  
more will be little enoughrto fend it to Europe, or to fell  
it in Virginia and remit the money: So that I could not  
fafely aniwer for placing the proceeds in your hands till the  
month of Augutt, and fo annually every Augult afterward  
till thedebt hall be paid. It will always be both my in-  
tereft and my with to get it to you as much fooner as pof-  
fible, and probably a part of it’ may always k= paid fome  
months fooner. If the afligning of the profits, in general  
terms,-may feein to you toovague, I am willing to fix the  
annual payment ata fum certain. But that I may not fall  
fhort ofmy engagement, I fhall name it fomewhat lefs than  
I fuppofe may be counted on. I fhall fix your partat  
four hundred pounds fterling annually ; and, as you know  
our crops of tobacco to be&#x27;uncertain, I fhould refervea  
right if they fail fhort-one year, to make it up the enfuing  
one without being fuppofed to have failed in my engage-  
ment ; butevery other year at leaftall arrearages fhall be  
fully paid up.  
  
‘* My part of this debt of Mr. Wayle’s eflate being one  
third, ! {hould require that in proportion as I pay my third,  
fhall fland difcharged as to the ihe: two thirds, fo that the  
payment of every hundred pounds fhall difcharge me as  
to three hundred poundsof the undivided debt. “The other  
  
g | gentlemen have; equal means of paying, equal defires, and  
  
more {kill in-affairs. © Their parts of the debt therefore are  
at leafl as fure as mine : and my great objeét is, in cafe of  
any accident to myfelf, to leave my family uninvolved with  
any matters whatever.  
  
* IT donot know what the balance of thisdebt is. The  
laft account current I faw was before the war, making the  
whole balance, principal and intereft, fomewhere about  
nine thoufand pounds : and afier this there were upwards  
of 400 doa of tobacco and fome payments in money  
to be credited. However this fettlement can admit of no  
difficulty: and in the mean time payments may proceed  
without affefting the right of either party to have a juft {er-  
tlement. :  
  
** Upon the whole then I propofe, that, on your part. you  
relinquifh the claim to intereft during the war, fay trom the  
commencement of hoililities April agth, :775, to their  
ceffation, April 19th, 1783, being exaéily eight years ;  
and that in proportion as I pay my third I fhall be acquitt-  
ed as to the other two thirds.” On my part I take on my-  
felf the lofs of the paper money ny ited in the treafury ;  
I agree to pay intereft previous and fubfequent to the war,  
and oblige myfelf to remit to you for that and the pancipal  
four hundred pounds fterling annually tll my third of the  
whole debt fhal! bé fully paid: and I will begin thefe pay-  
  
  
  
ments in Auguft of next year.”  
  
“ If think proper to accede to thefe propofitions,’  
be fo saa to fay fo ae foot of a copy of this letter  
On my receipt of that, I will fend you an acknowledg-’  
ment of it, which fhall render this prefent letter Reve pore

ecution of this undertaking.

&quot; 1 am desirous or arranging witli you  
such just and practicable conditions as  
will ascertain to vol the terms at which  
you will receive my part of your debt,  
and give me tbe satisfaction ot knowing  
that you are contented. What the laws  
of Virginia are, or may be, will in no  
way influence my conduct. Substantial  
justioe is my object, as decided by rev-  
son, and not by authority or compul  
sion.  
The first question which arises, is as  
to the article of interest. For all the  
time preceding the war, and all subse  
quent to it, 1 think it reasonable that in­  
terest should be paid ; but equally un  
reasonable during the war. Interest is  
a compensation for the use of money.&#x27;  
Your money in my hands is in the form  
of lands and negroes. From these, dur­  
ing the war, no use in profits could be  
derived. Tobacco is the article they  
produce ; that can only be turned into  
money at a foreign market.  
But the moment it went out of our  
ports for that purpose, it was captured  
either by the King&#x27;s ships, or those of  
individuals. I he consequence was, that  
tobacco worth from twenty to thirty  
shillings the hundred, sold generally in  
VirtiDia, during the war, lor nve shil  
lings. This price, it is known, will not  
maintain the labourer, and pay his taxes  
There was no surplus of profit then to  
pay an interest: in the meanwhile we  
stood ensurers of the lives of tbe 1  
pourers. and of the ultimate issue of the  
war.  
He who attempted during the war to  
remit either his principal or interest,  
must have expected to remit three times  
to make oue payment ; because it is sup­  
posed that two out of three parts of the  
shipments were taken. It was not pos­  
sible then for the debtor to derive any  
profit from the money which might en­  
able him to pay an interest, nor yet to  
get rid of the principal by remitting it  
to his creditor. With respect to the  
creditors in Great Britain, they mostly  
turned their attention to privateering,  
and, arming the vebels they had before  
employed in trading with us, they cap­  
tured on the seas, not only the produce  
of the farms of debtors, but of those ot  
the whole state they thus paid them­  
selves by capture more than the annual  
interest, and wo lost more. Some mer­  
chants indeed did not ecgnge in priv­  
ateering ; these lost their iutere-t, but  
we did not gain it: it foil into the hands  
of their couutryrcen. It cannot there­  
fore be demanded of us; as between these  
merchants and their debtors it is the  
case where a loss being incurred, each  
party may justifiably endeavour to shift  
it from himself: each ha3 an equal right  
to avoid it: one party can never expect  
the other to yield a thing to which he  
has as eood a right as the demander.  
We even think he has a better right than  
the demander in the present instance :  
this loss has been occasioned by the  
fault of the nation which was creditor.  
Our right to avoid it then stands on less  
exceptionable ground than theirs; but it  
will be said that each party thought the  
other the agzrcssor. lu these disputes  
there is but one umpire, and that has  
decided tbo question where the world in  
so

that  
shall

nd  
will  
next  
the  
my  
this  
  
general thought tbo right laid.  
Besides these reasons in favor of the  
general mass of debtors, I have some  
peculiar to my own case. In the year  
1770, before a ekiiliug o. papr iuouy I  
, 1 T 111 1 il&#x27;.i  
was understood, i sou tanas io inc  
amount of 4,2001. in order to pay these;

T  
  
myself. Had he done it, those debtors  
being turned over to you would have  
been saved to you by the treaty of:,.  
peace : but he declined it. Great sums  
paper money were afterwards issued  
thus depreciated, and payment was made  
me in this money when it was but a  
shadow. Our laws do not entitle their  
tliPA PARfitt tlinncrh tha tftv nftiM:t  
es the British creditors to do it: here  
then I lost the principal and interest  
once. Again, .Lord Lornwalus encamp­  
ed ten days on an estate of mine, at Elk  
Island, having his head-quarters in my  
house; be burnt the tobacco-houses and  
barns on the farm, with the produce of  
the former year in them. He burnt all  
the enclosures, and wasted the fields  
in which the crop of that year was grow­  
ing (it was the month of Juno); he  
killed or carried off every living animal,  
cutting the throats of those which were  
too young for service : of the slaves he  
carried off thirty. The usefess and bar­  
barous injury he did me in that instance,  
was more than would have paid your  
debt, principal and interest: thus I lost  
it a second time : still I will lay my  
shoulder assiduously to the payment of  
it a third time. In doing this, however,  
think yourself will be of opinion I am  
authorized in justice to clare it of every  
article not demandable upon strict right:  
of this nature I consider interest during  
the war.  
Another question is as to the paper  
money I deposited in the treasuryof Vir­  
ginia towards the discharge of this debt.  
before obsarved, that I bad sold lands  
the amount of 4,2001. before a shill­  
ing of paper money was emitted, with a  
view to pay the debt : I received this  
money in depreciated paper. The State  
was then calling on those who owed  
money to British subjects to bring it in­  
to the treasury, where it was applied, as  
all money of the same description was,  
the support of the war. Subsequent  
events have been such, that the State  
cannot, and ought not, to pay tbe same  
nominal sum in gold or silver, which  
they received in paper : nor is it certain  
what they will do : my intention being,  
and having always been, that, whatever  
the State decides, you shall receive my  
part of your debt fully. I am ready to  
remove all difficulty arising from this  
deposit, to take back to myself the de­  
mand against the State, and to consider  
the deposit as originally made for my­  
self, and not for you.  
These two article of interest and pa­  
per money being thus settled, I would  
propose to divide the clear proceeds of  
tbe estate (in which there are from 80  
100 labouring slaves) between your­  
self and Kepper and Co,, two thirds to  
you, and one third to them : and that  
the crops of this present year, 1787,  
shall constitute the first payment. That  
cannot be got to the warehouse com­  
pletely, till May of the next year; and  
suppose that three months more will be  
little enough to send it to Europe, or to  
end.it to Virgieia and remit the money:  
that I could not safely answer for  
placing the proceeds in your hands till  
month of August, and so annually  
every August afterwards, till the debt  
shall be paid. It will bealways both my  
interest and my wish to get it to you as  
much sooner as possible, and probably  
part of it may always by paid some  
months sooner, if the assigning of the  
profits, in general terms, may f-eeui to  
you too vague, I am willing to fix the  
annual payment at a sum certain. But  
that I may not fall short of my engage­  
ment, I ehall name it somewhat less  
than I supposed may be counted on. I  
shall fix your part at four hundred  
pounds sterling annually; and, as you  
know our crops of tobacco to be uncer  
tain, I should reserve a right, if they  
short one year, to make it up the  
ensuing one, without being supposed to  
have tailed in my engagement; but  
every other year, at least, all arrearages  
shall be fully said up.  
My part of this debt of Mr. Wayles&quot;  
estate being one third, I shjuld require  
that in proportion, if I pay my third, I  
shall stand discharged as to the other two  
thirds, so that the payment of every  
three hundred pounds shall discharge me  
to three hundred pounds of the un  
divided debt. The other gentlemen have  
equal means of paying, equal desires, and  
more skill in affairs. Their parts of the  
debt therefore are at least as sure as  
mine ; and my great object is, in case of  
accident to myself, to leave my fami  
uninvolved with any matters what  
ever.  
I do not know what the balance of  
debt is. The laft account current I  
was belore the war, makinz the  
whole balance, principal and interest  
somewhere about nine thousand pounds  
after this there were upwards of 400  
hogshead of tobacco, and some payments  
money, to be credited. However,  
settlement can admit of no difficul­  
ty; and in the mean time the payments  
proceed without affecting the right  
either party to have a just settle  
ment.  
Upon the whole then I propose, that  
your part, you relinquish the claim  
interest during the war, siy from the  
commencement of hostilities April 19,  
1783, being exactly eight years; and  
in proportion as I pay my third I  
be acquitted as to the other two  
thirds. On my part I take on myself  
loss of the paper money deposited  
the treasury ; I agree to pay interest  
previous and subsequent to tho war, and  
oblige myself to remit to you for that  
the principal four hundred pounds  
sterling annually, till my third of the  
whole debt shall be fully paid; and I  
begin these payments in August of  
year.  
IF you think proper to accede to these  
propositions, be so good as to say so at  
foot of a copy of this letter. On  
receipt of that, I will send you an  
acknowledgment of it, which will render  
present letter obligatory on me : in  
which case you may count on my faith­  
ful execution of this undertaking.  
I have the honor to be, with great  
respect, Sir, your niojt obedient and  
humble servant.  
in  
of  
a
