O Would’st thou keep thy Country’s loud Applause  
Lov’d as her Father, as her God ado’rd  
Be still the bold assertor of her cause  
Her Voice, in Council; (in the Fight her Sword)  
In peace, in War persue thy Countrys Good  
For her, bare thy bold Breast, and pour thy Gen’rous Blood.  
  
Difficult as the Day is, cruel as this War has been, seperated as I am on account of it from the dearest connextion in life, I would not exchange my Country for the Wealth of the Indies, or be any other than an American tho I might be Queen or Empress of any Nation upon the Globe.
