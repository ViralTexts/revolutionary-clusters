Like a dropsical man calling out for water, water, our deluded citizens are clamoring for more banks, more banks. the American mind is now in that state of fever which the world has so often seen in the history of other nations. we are, under the bank-bubble, as England was under the South sea bubble, France under the Misisipi bubble, and as every nation is liable to be, under whatever bubble design or delusion may puff up in moments when off their guard. no we are now taught to believe that legerdemain tricks upon paper can produce as solid wealth as hard labor in the earth. it is vain for common sense to urge that nothing can produce but nothing: that it is an idle dream to believe in a philosopher’s stone which is to turn every thing into gold, and to redeem man from the original sentence of his maker that ‘in the sweat of his brow shall he eat his bread.’ not Quixot enough however to attempt to reason Bedlam to rights, my anxieties are turned to the most practicable means of withdrawi

 different persons doubtless will devise different schemes of relief. one would be to suppress instantly the currency of all paper not issued under the authority of our own state or of the general government: to interdict after a few months the circulation of all bills of 5.D. &amp; under; after a few months more all of 10.D. &amp; under; after other terms those of 20, 50, &amp; so on to 100.D. which last, if any must be left in circulation, should be the lowest denomination. these might be a convenience in mercantile transactions &amp; transmissions, and would be excluded by their size from ordinary circulation. but the disease may be too pressing to await such a remedy. with the legislature I chearfully leave it to apply this medecine, or that medecine, or no medecine at all. I am sure their intentions are faithful, and embarked in the same bottom, I am willing to swim or sink with my fellow citizens. if the latter is their choice, I will go down with them without a murmur. but my exhortation would rather be ‘not to give up the ship.’  
I  am a great friend to the improvements of roads, canals &amp; schools. but I wish I could see some provision for the former as solid as for the latter, something better than fog. the literary fund is a solid provision, unless lost in the impending bankruptcy. if the legislature would add to that a perpetual tax of a cent a head on the population of the state, it would set agoing at once, and for ever maintain a system of primary or ward schools, and an university where might be taught in it’s highest degree every branch of science useful in our time &amp; country: and it would rescue us from the tax of toryism, fanaticism, &amp; indifferentism to their own state which we now send our youth to bring from those of New England. if a civilised nation expects to be ignorant &amp; free, in a state of civilisation, it expects what never was &amp; never will be. the functionaries of every government have propensities to command at will the liberty &amp; property of their constituents. there is no safe deposit for these but with the people themselves; nor can they be safe with them without information. where the press is free and every man able to read, all is safe.—the frankness of this communication will, I am sure, suggest to you a discreet use of it.
