Monticello. Mar. 5. 10  
  
Your letter, my dear friend, of the 18th Ult. comes like the refreshing dews of the evening on a thirsty soil. it recalls antient, as well as recent recollections, very dear to my heart. for five and thirty years we have walked together through a land of tribulations. yet these have past away &amp; so, I trust, will those of the present day. the toryism, with which we struggled in 77. differed but in name from the federalism of 99 with which we struggled also; and the Anglicism of 1808. against which we are now struggling, is but the same thing still, in another form. it is a longing for a king, &amp; an English king rather than any other. this is the true source of their sorrows &amp; wailings. the fear that Bonaparte will come over us &amp; conquer us also, is too chimerical to be genuine.   
			 supposing  
			 him to have finished Spain &amp; Portugal, he has yet England &amp; Russia to subdue. the maxim of war was never sounder than in this case, not to leave an enemy in the rear; &amp; especially where an insurrectionary flame is  
			 known to be under  
			 the embers, merely  
			 smothered and ready to burst at every point.   
			 these two subdued, (&amp; surely the Anglomen will not think the conquest of England alone a short work) antient Greece &amp;  
			 Macedonia the cradle of Alexander his prototype, and Constantinople, the seat of empire for the world, would glitter more in his eye than our bleak mountains &amp; rugged forests. Egypt too, &amp; the golden apples of Mauritania have for more than half a century fixed the longing eyes of France;   
			 and with Syria, you know, he has an old affront to wipe out. then come ‘Pontus &amp; Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia,’ the fine  
			 countries on the Euphrates &amp; Tygris, the Oxus &amp; Indus, &amp; all beyond the Hyphasis which bounded the glories of his Macedonian rival; with the invitations of his new British subjects on the banks of the Ganges, which   
whom after recieving under his protection the mother country, he cannot refuse to visit. when all this is done &amp; settled, &amp; nothing of the old world remains unsubdued, he may turn to the  
			 new one. but will he attack us first, from whom he will get but hard knocks, &amp; no money? or will he first lay hold of the gold &amp; silver of Mexico &amp; Peru, &amp; the diamonds of Brazil? a republican emperor from his affection to   
republics, independant of motives of expediency, must grant  
			 to ours the Cyclop’s boon of being the last devoured. while all this is doing, we are to suppose the chapter of accidents read out, &amp; that nothing can happen to cut short, or to disturb his enterprises.  
			 but  
			 the Anglomen, it seems, have found out a much safer dependance than all these chances of death or  
			 disappointment. that is that we should first let England plunder us, as she has been doing for years, for fear Bonaparte should do it; &amp; then ally ourselves with her, and enter into the war. a Conqueror whose career England could not arrest when aided by Russia, Austria Prussia, Sweden, Spain &amp; Portugal, she is now to destroy, with all these on his side, by the aid of the US. alone. this indeed is making us a mighty people. and what is  
			 to be our security that,  
			 when embarked for her in the war, she will not make a separate peace, &amp; leave us in the lurch?  
			 her good faith! the faith of a nation of merchants! the Punica fides of modern Carthage! of  
			 the friend &amp; Protectress of Copenhagen! of the nation who never admitted a chapter of morality into her political code! and is now boldly avowing that whatever power can make hers, is hers of right. money, &amp; not morality is  
			 the principle of commerce &amp; commercial nations. but, in addition to this, the nature of the English government forbids, of itself, reliance on her engagements; &amp; it is well known she has  
			 been,   
through all the commercial periods of her history the least faithful to her alliances of any nation of Europe since the period of her history wherein she has been distinguished for her commerce &amp; corruption, that is to say, under the houses of Stuart &amp; Brunswick. to Portugal alone she has steadily adhered; because, by her Methuen treaty she had made it a colony, &amp; one of the most valuable to her. it may be asked,  
			 what, in the nature of her government unfits England for the observation of moral duties? in  
			 the first place, her king is a cypher; his only function being to name the oligarchy which is to govern her. the parliament is, by corruption, the  
			 mere instrument of the will of the   
government administration. the real power &amp; property in the government is in the great aristocratical families of the nation. the nest of office being too small for all of them to cuddle into at once, the contest is eternal, which shall croud the other out. for this purpose they are divided into two parties, the Ins, &amp; the Outs, so equal in weight that a small matter turns the balance. to keep themselves in, when they are in, every stratagem must be practised, every artifice used which may flatter the pride, the passions or power of the government   
nation. justice, honour, faith must yield to the necessity of keeping themselves in place. the question whether a measure is moral is never asked; but whether it will nourish the avarice of their  
			 merchants, or the pyratical spirit of their navy, or produce any other effect which   
may strengthen them in their places. as to  
			 engagements, however positive, entered into by the predecessors of the Ins, why, they were their enemies; they did every thing which was wrong; &amp; to reverse every thing they did must  
			 therefore be  
			 right. this is the true character of the English government in practice, however different it’s theory, and it presents the singular phaenomenon of a nation the individuals of which are as  
			 faithful  
			 to their private engagements &amp; duties, as honorable, as worthy, as those of any nation on earth, and whose government is yet the most unprincipled at this day known.in an absolute  
			 government there can be no such equiponderant parties. the Despot is the government. his power suppresses all opposition, maintains his ministers firm in their places. what he has contracted  
			 therefore through them, he has the power to observe with good faith: and he identifies his own honor &amp; faith with that of his nation.when I observed however that the king of England was a cypher, I did not mean to confine the observation to the mere individual now on that throne. the practice of kings marrying only into the families of kings, has been that of Europe for some centuries. now, take any race of animals, confine them in idleness &amp; inaction whether in a stye, a stable, or a stateroom, pamper them with high diet, gratify all their sexual  
			 appetites, immerse them in sensualities, nourish their passions, let every thing bend before them, &amp; banish whatever might lead them to think, &amp; in a few generations they become all body  
			 &amp; no mind: &amp; this too by a law of nature, by that very law by which we are in the constant practice of changing the characters &amp; propensities of the animals we raise for our own  
			 purposes.  
			 such is the regimen in raising kings, &amp; in this way they had gone on for centuries. while in Europe, I  
			 often amused myself with contemplating the characters of the then reigning sovereigns of Europe. Louis the XVIth was a fool, of my own knolege, &amp; in despite of the answers made for him at his trial.the king of Spain was a fool,  
			 &amp; of Naples the same. they passed their lives in hunting, &amp; dispatched two couriers a week, 1000. miles, to let each other know what game they had killed the preceding days.  
			 the king of Sardinia was a fool. all these were Bourbons.  
			 the Queen of Portugal, a Braganza, was an ideot by nature. &amp; so was  
			 the king of Denmark. their sons, as regents, exercised the powers of government.  
			 the  
			 king of Prussia, successor to the great Frederic, was a mere hog in body as well as in mind.  
			 Gustavus of Sweden, &amp; Joseph of Austria were really crazy,  
			 &amp; George of England you know was in a straight waistcoat.  
			 there  
			 remained then none but old Catharine who had been too lately picked up to have lost her common sense.  
			 in this state Bonaparte found Europe; &amp; it was this state of it’s rulers which lost it with scarce a struggle.  
			 these animals had become without mind &amp; powerless: and so will every hereditary monarch be after a few generations.  
			 Alexander the grandson of Catherine, is as yet an exception. he is able to hold his own. but he is only of the 3d generation. his race is not yet worn out. and  
			 so endeth the book of kings, from all of whom the lord deliver us, and have you, my friend &amp; all such good men &amp; true, in his holy keeping.

* When | observed that the King of Eng-  
land was a cypher, I did not mean to confine  
the observation to the inere individual now  
on thethrone. ‘The practice of Kings mar-  
rying only into the family of Kings, has been  
that of Europe for some centuries. Now,

propensities of the animals we raise for our  
own purposes. Such is the regimen in raising  
Kings, and this is the way they have gone on  
for centuries. While in Europe, I often a-  
mused myself with comtemplating the char-  
acters of the then reigning sovereigns of  
Europe. Louis the X VJ, wasa fool, of my  
own knowledge, and in despite of the an-  
swers made for him at his trial. The King  
of Spain was a fool; of Naples, the same.  
‘They passed their lives in hunting, and des-  
patched two couriers a week, 1000 miles,  
to let each other know what game they had  
killed the preceding days. ‘The King of  
Sardinia was a fool. All these were Bour-  
bons. The Queen of Portugal, a Braganza,  
was an idiot by nature; and so was the  
King of Denmark. Their sons, as Ye

King of Prussia, suscessor to the great Fred-

‘‘&#x27;There remained, then, none but old  
Catharine, who had been -too lately picked  
up to have lost her common sense. In this  
state, Bonaparte found Europe ; and it was  
this state of its rulers which lost it with scarce  
a struggle. These animals had become with-  
out mind and powerless ; and so will every  
hereditary monarch be after a few genera-  
tions. Alexander, the grandson of Catha-

his own. But he is only of the third gener-

## [From _Alabama state intelligencer._](https://www.loc.gov/resource/sn84021903/1831-06-04/ed-1/?sp=2)

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
Monticf.llo, March 5, 3810.  
Your letter, my dear friend, of the 18th  
ultimo, comes like the refreshing dues of the  
evening on a thirsty soil. It recalls ancient  
as well as recent recollections, very dear to  
my heart. For five and thirty years we have  
walked together through a land of tribula­  
tions. Yet these have passed away, and so,  
I trust, will those of the present day. The  
toryism with which we struggled in ’77, dif­  
fered but in name from the federalism of ’99,  
with which wc struggled also ; and the Angli­  
cism of 1808, against which wc are now strug­  
ling, is but the same thing still, in another  
form. It is a longing for a King, and an Eng­  
lish King rather than any other. This is the  
true source of their sorrows and wailings.  
The fear that Buonaparte will come over  
to us and conquer us also, is too chimerical to  
be genuine. Supposing him to have finished  
Spain and Portugal, he has yet England and  
Russia to subdue. The maxim of war was  
never sounder than in this case, not to leave  
an enemy in the rear; and especially where  
an insurrectionary flame is known to be under  
the embers, merely smothered, and ready to  
burst at every point. These two subdued,  
(and surely the Anglntncn will not think the  
conquest of England alone a short work) an­  
cient Greece and Macedonia, the cradle of  
Alexander, his prototype, and Constantino­  
ple, the seat of empire for the world, would  
glitter more in his eye than our bleak moun­  
tains and rugged forests. Egypt, too, and  
the golden apples of Mauritania, have for  
more than half a century fixed the longing  
eyes of France; and with Syria, you know,  
he has an old affront to wipe out. Then come  
‘Pontusand Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and  
Bithynia,’ the fine countries on the Euphra­  
tes and Tigris, the Oxus and Indus, and all  
beyond the Hyphasis, which bounded the glo­  
ries of his Macedonian rival ; with the invi­  
tation of his new British subjects on the banks  
of the Ganges, whom, after receiving under  
his protection the mother country, he can­  
not refuse to visit. When all this is done  
and settled, and nothing of the old world re­  
mains unsubdued, he may turn to the new  
one. But will he attack us first, from whom  
he will get but hard knocks and no money?—  
Or will he first lay hold of the gold and silver  
of Mexico and Peru, and the diamonds of  
Brazil ? A re/iublican Emperor, from his  
affection to republics, independent of motives  
of expediency, must grant to ours the Cy­  
clop’s boon of being the last devoured. While  
all this is doing, wc are to suppose the chap­  
ter of accidents read out, and that nothing  
can happen to cut short or to disturb his en­  
terprises.  
  
cut the Anglomen, it seems, have found out  
a much safer dependancc, than all these  
chances of death or disappointment. That  
is,that we should first let England plunder us,  
as she has been doing for years, for fear Buo­  
naparte should do it; and then ally ourselves  
with her, and enter into the war. A conqur­  
er whose career England could not arrest  
when aided by Russia, Austria, Prussia,  
Sweeden, Spain and Portugal, she is now to  
destroy, with ail these on his side, by the aid  
of the United States alone. This, indeed, is  
making us a mighty people. And what is to  
l»e our security, that when embarked for her  
in the war, she will not make a separate  
peace, and leave us in the lurch ? Her good  
faith ! The faith of a nation of merchants !—  
The Punica fides of modern Carthage ! Of  
the friend and protectress of Copenhagen !—  
Of a nation who never admitted a chapter of  
mortality into her political code ! And is now  
boldly avowing, that whatever power can  
make hers, is hers of right. Money, and not  
morality is the principle of commerce and  
commercial nations. But, in addition to this,  
the nature of the English government forbids,  
of itself, reliance on her engagements ; and  
it is well known she has been the least faith­  
ful to her alliances of any nation of Europe,  
since the period of her history wherein she  
has been distinguished for her commerce and  
corruption, that is to say, under the houses  
of Stuart and Brunswick. To Portugal alone  
she has steadily adhered, because, by her  
Methuin treaty she had made it a colony, and  
one of the most valuable to her. It may be  
asked, what, in the nature of her govern­  
ment, unfits England for the observation of  
moral duties ? In the first place, her King is  
a cypher ; his only function being to name  
the oligarchy which is to govern her. The  
parliament is, bv corruption, the mere in­  
strument of the will of the administration.—  
The real power and property of the govern­  
ment is in the great aristocratical families of  
the nation. The nest of office being too small  
for them to cuddle into at once, the contest is  
eternal, which shall crowd the other out. For  
this pui pose, they are divided into two par­  
ties, the Insand tile Outs, so equal in weight  
that a small matter turns the balance. To  
keep themselves in, when they are in, every  
stratagem must be practised, every artifice  
used which may flatter the pride, the pas­  
sions or power of the nation. Justice, honor,  
faith, must yield to the necessity of keeping  
themselves in place. The question whether  
a measure is moral, is never asked ; but whe­  
ther it will nourish the avarice of their mer­  
chants, or the piratical spirit of their navy,  
or produce any other effect which may  
strengthen them in their places. As to en­  
gagements, however positive, entered into  
by the Ins, why, they were their enemies ;  
they did every thing which was wrong ; and  
to reverse every thing they did, must, there­  
fore be right. This is the true character of  
the English government in practice, however  
differrent is its theory; and it presents the  
singular phenomenon of a nation,the individu­  
als of which are as faithful to their priv ite  
engagements and duties, as honorable,as wor­  
thy, as those of any nation on earth, and  
whose government is yet the most unprinci­  
pled at this day known. In an absolute go­  
vernment there can be no such equiponderant  
parties. The despot is the government.—  
His power suppressing all opposition, main­  
tains his ministers firm in their places. What  
he has contracted,therefore,through them,he  
has the power to observe with good faith ;—  
and he identifies his own honor and faith with  
that of his nation.  
  
\V hen I observed, however, that the King  
of England was a cypher, I did not mean to  
confine the observation to the mere individu­  
al now on that throne. The practice of Kings  
marrying only into the families of Kings, has  
been that of Europe for some centuries.—  
Now, take any tace of animals, confine them  
in idleness and inaction, whether in a stye, a  
stable, or a stateroom,1 pamper them with  
high diet, gratify all their sexual appetites,  
immerse them in sensualities, nourish their  
passions, let every thing bend before them,  
and banish whatever might lead them to  
think, and in a few generations they become  
all body and no mind : and this, too, by a law  
of nature, by that very law by vvhich&#x27;we are  
in the constant practice of changing the char­  
acter and propensities of the animals we raise  
for our own purposes. Such is the regimen  
in raising Kings, and in this way they have  
gone on for centuries. While in Europe, I  
often amused myself with contemplating the  
then reigning sovereigns of Europe. Louis  
the XVI. was a fool, of my own knowledge,  
and in despite of the answers made for him  
  
at his trial. The King of Spain wai a fi,  
and of Naples the same thing. They pas J  
their lives in hunting, and despatched t a  
couriers a week, one thousand miles, to t  
each other know what game they had kil 1  
the preceding days. The King of Sardi 1  
was a fool. All these were Bourbons, &#x27;lie  
Queen of Portugal, a Braganza, was an i&lt; t  
by nature. And so was the King of D •  
mark. Their sons, as regents, exercised :  
powers of government. The Kingof Prusi,  
successor to the great Frederick, was a m :  
hog in body as well as in mind. Gusta&#x27;s  
of Sweeden, and Joseph of Austria, were -  
ally crazy, and George of England you kn /  
was in a straight waistcoat. There remain ,  
then, none but old Catharine, who had b&lt; &gt;  
too lately picked up to have lost her conur 1  
sense. In this state Buonaparte found 1&#x27; -  
rope; and it was this state of its rulers tit  
lost it with scarce a struggle. These anim i  
had become without mind and powerless  
and so will every hereditary monarchy ;  
after a few generations. Alexander,&quot; t;  
grandson of Catherine, is as yet an exceptii.  
He is able to hold his own. But he is only t  
the third generation. His race is not j‘.  
worn out. And so endeth the book of Kin;,  
from all of whom the Lord deliver us, a I  
have you, my friend, and all such good m 1  
and true, in his holy keeping.

The following was his theory of the English government, at  
that time: and whether it be much better now&#x27;, w&#x27;e hardly like to  
say : —  
  
‘ The real power and property in this government are the great aris-  
tocratical families of the nation. The nest &lt;»f office being too small for  
all of them t4&gt; cuddle into at mice, the contest is eternal, which shall  
crowd the other out. For this purpose, they are divided into two par¬  
ties, the Ins and the Outs, so ecpial in weight, that a small matter  
furns the balance. To keep themselves in, when they are in, every  
stratagem must he practised, every artifice used, which may flatter the  
jiride, the jiassions, or the jiower of the nation. Justice, lionour, faith,  
must yield to the necessity of keeping themselves in place. The  
question wdiether a measure is moral, is never asked, hut whether it  
will nourish the avarice of their merchants, or the piratical spirit of  
tlieir navy, or produce any other effect, which may strengthen them in  
their places. As to engagements, howover positive, entered into by  
the predecessors of the Ins, why, they were their enemies ; they did  
every thing which was wrong; and to reverse every thing they did,  
must therefore he right. This is the true character of the 1 British go¬  
vernment in practice, however different its theory ; and it presents the  
singular phenomenon of a nation, the individuals of which are as  
faithful t(» their private engagements and duties, as honourable, as  
worthy, as those of any nation on earth, and whose government is vet  
the most unprincipled at this day known.’—ib., pp. 314, 345.

MoNTICELLO, March 5, &#x27;10.-Your let­  
ter, my dear friend, of the 18th ult., comes  
like the refreshing dews of the evening on  
a thirsty soil. It recalls ancient as well as  
recent recollections, very dear to my heart.  
For five and thirty years we have walked  
together through a land of tribulations,  
yet these have passed away, and so. I  
trust will those of the present day. The  
toryism, with which we struggled in 77,  
differed but in name from the federalism  
of&#x27;99, with which we struggled also; and  
the Anglicism of 1808, against which we  
are now struggling, is but the same thing  
still, in another form. It is a longing for a  
king, an English king, rather than any  
other, this is the true source of their sor.­  
rows &amp; wailings; the fear that Bonaparte  
will come over us &amp; conquer us also, is too  
chimerical to be genuine. Supposing him  
to have finished Spain &amp; Portugal, he has  
yet England a Russia to subdue; the  
maxim of war was never sounder than in  
this case, not to have an enemy in the  
rear; &amp; especially where an insurrection­  
ary flame is known to be under the embers  
merely smothered, &amp; ready to burst at  
every point. These two subdued (and  
surely the Angloman will not think the  
conquest of England alone a short work),  
ancient Greece and Macedonia the cradle  
of Alexander, his prototype, and Constan­  
tinople, the seat of empire for the world,  
would glitter more in his eye than our  
bleak mountains and rugged forests. Egypt  
too, and the golden apples of Mauritania  
have more than half a century fixed the  
longing eyes of France; and with Syria,  
you know he has an old affront to wipe  
out. Then comes &quot;Pontua and Galatia,  
Capadocia, Asia and Bithynia,&quot; the fine  
countries on the Euphratias and Tygris,  
the Oxus and Indus, and all beyond the  
Hyphrasis, which bounded the glories of  
his Macedonion rival; with the invitations  
of his new British subjects on the banks of  
the Ganges, which, after receiving under  
his protection the mother country, he can­  
not refuse to visit. When all this is done  
and settled, and nothing of the old world  
remains unsubdued, he may turn to the  
new one, but will he attack us first, from  
whom he will get but hard knocks, and no  
money? or will he first lay hold of the gold  
and silver of Mexico and Peru, and the  
diamonds of Brazil? A republican empe­  
ror from his affection to republics, inde­  
pendent of motives of expediency must  
grant to ours the Cyclop&#x27;s boon of being  
the last devoured. While all this is doing,  
we are to suppose the chapter of accidents  
read out, and that nothing can happen to  
cut short or to disturb hisenterprises; but  
Anglomen, it seems, have found out a  
much safer dependence than all these  
chances of death or disappointment--that  
is, that we should first let England plun­  
der us, as she has been doing for years,  
for fear Bonaparte should do it; and then  
ally ourselves with her and enter into war;  
a conqueror whose career England could  
not arrest, when aided by Russia, Aus­  
tria, Prussia, Sweden, Spain and Portu­  
gal, she is now to destroy, with all these  
on his side, by the aid of the United States  
alone. This, indeed, is making us a mighty  
people; and what is to be our secu­  
rity that, when embarked for her in  
the war, she will not make a separate  
peace, and leave us in the lurch? Her  
good faith! the Punica fides of modern  
Carthage! of the friend and protectress of  
Copenhagen! of the nation who never ad­  
mitted a chapter of morality in her political  
code! and is now boldly avowing that what­  
ever power can make hers, is hers of right.  
Money, and not morality, is the principle of  
commerce and commercial nations. But  
in addition to this, the nature of the Eng­  
lish government forbids, of itself, reliance  
on her engagements; and it is well known  
she has been the least faithful to her alli­  
ances of any nation of Europe since the  
period of her history wherein she has been  
distinguished for her commerce and cor­  
ruption, that is to say under the houses of  
of Stuart and Brunswick. To Portugal  
alone she has steadily adhered because, by  
her Methuen treaty, she had made  
it a colony, and one of the most  
valuable to her. It may be asked what  
in the nature of her government un­  
fits England for the observation of  
moral duties? In the first place her  
king is a cypher, his only function being to  
name the oligarchy which is to govern her.  
The Parliament is by corruption the mere  
instrument of the will of the administra­  
tion. The real power and property in the  
government is in the great aristocratical  
families of the nation. The nest of office  
being too small for all of them to cuddle  
into at once, the contest is eternal, which  
will crowd the other out. For this purpose  
they are divided into two parties, the ins  
and the outs, so equal in weight that a  
small matter turns the balance. To keep  
themselves in, when they are in, every  
strategem must be practiced, every arti­  
fice used which may flatter the pride,  
the passons or power of the nation, jus  
tice honour, alth must yiel to the feces­  
sity of keeping themselves in place. The  
question whether a measure is moral never  
is asked; but whether it will nourish the  
  
avarice of their merchants, or the pyratical  
&quot;spirit of their navy, or produce any other  
effect which may strengthen them in their  
places. As to engagements, however posi­  
tive, entered into be the predecessors of the  
ins, when they were their enemies, they did  
everything which was wrong; and reverse  
everything which they did must therefore  
be right. This is the true characteristic of  
the English Government in practice, how.  
  
ever different its theory; and it presents  
the singular phenomenon of a nation, the  
individiuals of which are as faithful to  
their private engagements &amp; duties, as  
honourable, as worthy, as those of any na­  
tion on Earth &amp; whose government is yet  
the most unprincipled at this day known.  
In the absolute government there can be no  
such equiponderant parties. The despot  
is the Government. His power suppress a  
all opposition, maintains his ministers firm  
in their places. What he has contracted  
therefore through them, he has the power  
to observe with good faith; and he iden  
tifies his own honor and faith with that of  
his nation. When I observed, however  
that the king of England was a  
cypher, I did not mean to confine  
the observation to the mere individual  
now on the throne. The practice of  
kings marrying only into the families of  
kings has been that of Europe for some  
centuries. Now, take any race of animals  
confine them in idleness and inaction,  
whether in a sty, a stable, or a stateroom,  
pamper them with high diet, gratify all  
their sexual appetites, immerse them in  
sensualities, nourish their passions, let  
everything bend before them, and  
banish whatever might lead them to think,  
and in a few generations they become all  
body and no mind; and this too by a  
law of nature, by that very law by  
which we are in constant practice of  
changing the characters and propensities  
of the animals we raise for our own pur.­  
poses. Such is the regimen in raising  
kings, and in this way they had  
gone on for centuries. While in Europe,  
often amused myself with con­  
templating the characters of the then  
reigning sovereigns of Europe. Louis the  
VIth was a fool, of my own knowledge,  
and in despite of the answers made for  
him at his trial. The king of Spain was a  
fool, &amp; of Naples the same. They passed  
their lives in hunting, and dispatched two  
couriers a week 1000 miles, to let each  
other know what game they had killed  
the preceding days. The king of Sar.  
dinia was a fool. All these were Bourbons.  
The queen of Portugal, a Braganza, was  
an idiot by nature. And so was the king  
of Denmark. Their sons, as regents, ex­  
ercised the powers of Government. The  
king of Prussia, successor to the great  
Frederick, was a mere hog in body as well  
as in mind. Gustavus of Sweden, &amp;  
Joseph of Austria were really crazy, and  
George of England you know was in a  
straight waistcoat. There remained then  
none but old Catherine, who had been too  
lately picked up to have lost her common  
sense. In this state Bonaparte found Eu­  
rope, and it was this state of its rulers  
which lost it with scarce a struggle. These  
animals had become without mind and  
powerless, and so will every hereditary  
monarch be after a few generations. Alex­  
ander, the grandson of Catherine, is as yet  
an exception. He is able to hold his own,  
but he is only of the third generation, his  
race is not yet worn out. And so endeth  
the Book of Kings, from all of whom the  
Lord deliver us, and have you, my friend,  
and such good men and true, in His holy  
keeping.THo JEFFErSON

“ The practice of kings marrying only into the fami-
