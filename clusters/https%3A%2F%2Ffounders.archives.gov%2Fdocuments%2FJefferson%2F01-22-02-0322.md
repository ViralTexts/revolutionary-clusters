as substantially the same wheel as the one before in use, and there-

of the complainant’s invention in the specification of his patent. The  
form, proportions and mode of construction of every part seem to be  
as accurately described as the nature of the case will permit. The  
patent cannot be objected to on this account. The only point of  
doubt then as to the validity of the patent is, whether that part of the  
invention said to consist in the “improvement of the reaction wheel,”’

invention or discovery, he shall deliver a written description of his

provides, that the applicant shall make oath, that he does not know  
or believe that the composition of matter was ever before known or

Opinion of the court.—New and old parts pointed out by claim.  
  
  
  
that they do not state what parts of the machine patented  
are new and what parts are old, and that they are therefore  
void. There is nothing in the patent law which, in terms,  
requires the patentee to do this. The language of the act  
of 1836, under which these patents were drawn, is that before  
any inventor shall receive a patent for his invention or dis-  
covery he shall deliver a description thereof, and of the man-  
ner and process of making, constructing, using, and com-  
pounding the same, in such full, clear, and exact terms as to  
enable a person skilled in the art to reproduce it; and the  
act directs that the inventor shall “ particularly specify and

Sec. 4,888.—‘‘ Before any inventor or discov-  
erer shall receive a patent for his invention or  
discovery, he shall make application therefor in  
writing to the Commissioner of Patents, and  
shall file in the Patent Office a written descrip-  
tion of the same and of the manner and process

it, in such full, clear, concise and exact terms as  
to enable any person skilled in the art or science

and use the same ; and in case of a machine, he  
shall explain the principle thereof and the best  
mode in which he has contemplated applying  
that principle, so as to distinguish it from other  
inventions ; and he shall particularly point out  
and distinctly claim the part, improvement or  
combination which he claims as his invention or  
discovery. The specification and claim shall be  
signed by the inventor and attested by two wit-

shall be filed in the Patent Office, and a copy of  
the drawing to be furnished by the Patent Office  
shall be attached to the patent as a part of  
the specification.”  
  
It will be seen from this that an ordinary spe-  
cification is composed of three essential parts:
