ee of the Whole took up the bill establishing a department of foreign affairs. Smith (South Carolina) and others wished to strike out the clause declaring the secretary “to be removeable from office by the President of the United States.”  
  
  
Mr. Madison. If the construction of the constitution is to be left to its natural course with respect to the executive powers of this government, I own that the insertion of this sentiment in law may not be of material importance, though if it is nothing more than a mere declaration of a clear grant made by the constitution, it can do no harm; but if it relates to a doubtful part of the constitution, I suppose an exposition of the constitution may come with as much propriety from the legislature as any other department of government. If the power naturally belongs to the government, and the constitution is undecided as to the body which is to exercise it, it is likely that it is submitted to the discretion of the legislature, and the question will depend upon its own merits.  
I am clearly of opinion with the gentleman from South-Carolina (Mr. Smith,) that we ought in this and every other case to adhere to the constitution, so far as it will serve as a guide to us, and that we ought not to be swayed in our decisions by the splendor of the character of the present chief magistrate, but to consider it with respect to the merit of men who, in the ordinary course of things, may be supposed to fill the chair. I believe the power here declared is a high one, and in some respects a dangerous one; but in order to come to a right decision on this point, we must consider both sides of the question. The possible abuses which may spring from the single will of the first magistrate, and the abuse which may spring from the combined will of the executive and the senatorial qualification.  
When we consider that the first magistrate is to be appointed at present by the suffrages of three millions of people, and in all human probability in a few years time by double that number, it is not to be presumed that a vicious or bad character will be selected. If the government of any country on the face of the earth was ever effectually guarded against the election of ambitious or designing characters to the first office of the state, I think it may with truth be said to be the case under the constitution of the United States. With all the infirmities incident to a popular election, corrected by the particular mode of conducting it, as directed under the present system, I think we may fairly calculate, that the instances will be very rare in which an unworthy man will receive that mark of the public confidence which is required to designate the president of the United States. Where the people are disposed to give so great an elevation to one of their fellow citizens, I own that I am not afraid to place my confidence in him; especially when I know he is impeachable for any crime or misdemeanor, before the senate, at all times; and that at all events he is impeachable before the community at large every four years, and liable to be displaced if his conduct shall have given umbrage during the time he has been in office. Under these circumstances, although the trust is a high one, and in some degree perhaps a dangerous one, I am not sure but it will be safer here than placed where some gentlemen suppose it ought to be.  
It is evidently the intention of the constitution that the first magistrate should be responsible for the executive department; so far therefore as we do not make the officers who are to aid him in the duties of that department responsible to him, he is not responsible to his country. Again, is there no danger that an officer when he is appointed by the concurrence of the senate, and has friends in that body, may chuse rather to risk his establishment on the favor of that branch, than rest it upon the discharge of his duties to the satisfaction to the executive branch, which is constitutionally authorised to inspect and controul his conduct? And if it should happen that the officers connect themselves with the senate, they may mutually support each other, and for want of efficacy reduce the power of the president to a mere vapor, in which case his responsibility would be annihilated, and the expectation of it unjust. The high executive officers, joined in cabal with the senate, would lay the foundation of discord, and end in an assumption of the executive power, only to be removed by a revolution in the government. I believe no principle is more clearly laid down in the constitution than that of responsibility. After premising this, I will proceed to an investigation of the merits of the question upon constitutional ground.  
I have since the subject was last before the house, examined the constitution with attention, and I acknowledge that it does not perfectly correspond with the ideas I entertained of it from the first glance. I am inclined to think that a free and systematic interpretation of the plan of government, will leave us less at liberty to abate the responsibility than gentlemen imagine. I have already acknowledged, that the powers of the government must remain as apportioned by the constitution. But it may be contended, that where the constitution is silent it becomes a subject of legislative discretion; perhaps, in the opinion of some, an argument in favor of the clause may be successfully brought forward on this ground: I however leave it for the present untouched.  
By a strict examination of the constitution on what appears to be its true principles, and considering the great departments of the government in the relation they have to each other, I have my doubts whether we are not absolutely tied down to the construction declared in the bill. In the first section of the 1st article, it is said, that all legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a congress of the United States. In the second article it is affirmed, that the executive power shall be vested in a president of the United States of America. In the third article it is declared, that the judicial power of the United States shall be vested in one supreme court, and in such inferior courts as congress may from time to time ordain and establish. I suppose it will be readily admitted, that so far as the constitution has separated the powers of these great departments, it would be improper to combine them together, and so far as it has left any particular department in the entire possession of the powers incident to that department, I conceive we ought not to qualify them farther than they are qualified by the constitution. The legislative powers are vested in congress, and are to be exercised by them uncontrolled by any other department, except the constitution has qualified it otherwise. The constitution has qualified the legislative power by authorising the president to object to any act it may pass, requiring, in this case two-thirds of both houses to concur in making a law; but still the absolute legislative power is vested in the congress with this qualification alone.  
The constitution affirms, that the executive power shall be vested in the president: Are there exceptions to this proposition? Yes there are. The constitution says that, in appointing to office, the senate shall be associated with the president, unless in the case of inferior officers, when the law shall otherwise direct. Have we a right to extend this exception? I believe not. If the constitution has invested all executive power in the president, I venture to assert, that the legislature has no right to diminish or modify his executive authority.  
The question now resolves itself into this, Is the power of displacing an executive power? I conceive that if any power whatsoever is in its nature executive it is the power of appointing, overseeing, and controlling those who execute the laws. If the constitution had not qualified the power of the president in appointing to office, by associating the senate with him in that business, would it not be clear that he would have the right by virtue of his executive power to make such appointment? Should we be authorised, in defiance of that clause in the constitution—“The executive power shall be vested in a president,” to unite the senate with the president in the appointment to office? I conceive not. If it is admitted we should not be authorised to do this, I think it may be disputed whether we have a right to associate them in removing persons from office, the one power being as much of an executive nature as the other, and the first only is authorised by being excepted out of the general rule established by the constitution, in these words, “the executive power shall be vested in the president.”  
The judicial power is vested in a supreme court, but will gentlemen say the judicial power can be placed elsewhere, unless the constitution has made an exception? The constitution justifies the senate in exercising a judiciary power in determining on impeachments: But can the judicial power be farther blended with the powers of that body? They cannot

 either of the other; and inasmuch as the power of removal is of an executive nature, and not affected by any constitutional exception, it is beyond the reach of the legislative body.  
  
If this is the true construction of this instrument, the clause in the bill is nothing more than explanatory of the meaning of the constitution, and therefore not liable to any particular objection on that account. If the constitution is silent, and it is a power the legislature have a right to confer, it will appear to the world, if we strike out the clause, as if we doubted the propriety of vesting it in the president of the United States. I therefore think it best to retain it in the bill

I his is the warning voice of wisdom. God grant it may

I here is another most striking passage in this debate.  
I commend the whole ot it to the dispassionate consider­

partments of the government in the relation they have to each  
other, | have my doubts whether we are not absolutely tied  
down to the construction contained in the bill. In the first  
section of the first article, it is said that all legislative powers  
herein granted shall be vested in a congress of the United  
States. In the second article, it is affirmed that the executive  
power shall be vested in a president of the United States of  
America. In the third article, it is declared that the judicial  
power of the United States shall be vested in one supreme  
court; and in such inferior courts as congress may, from time  
to time, ordain and establish.  
  
“T suppose it will be readily admitted, that so far as the con-  
stitution has aeparated the powers of these great departments,  
it would be improper to combine them together; and so far as  
ithas left any particular department in the entire possession  
of the powers incident to that department, I conceive we ought  
not to qualify them further than they are qualified by the con-  
stitution. The legislative powers are vested in congress, and  
are to be exercised by them uncontroled by any other depart-  
ment, except the constitution has qualified it otherwise. The  
constitution has qualified the legislative power, by authorising  
the president to object to any act it may pass, requiring, in this  
case, two-thirds of both houses to concur in making a law; but  
still the absolute legislative power is vested in the congress  
with this qualification aione.  
  
“The constitution affirms, that the executive power shall be  
vested in the president. Are there exceptions to this proposi-  
tion? Yes, there are. The constitution says, that in appoint-  
ing to office, the senate shall be associated with the president,  
unless in case of inferior officers, when the law shall otherwise  
direct. Have we arightto extend this exception? I believe  
not. If the constitution has invested ali executive power in  
the president, I venture to assert that the legislature has no  
&gt;&gt; to diminish or modify his executive authority.”’

the constitution, deciding the genius and charac­  
ter of the whole government. They were the  
more easily successful from the fact that Wash­  
ington was President, and the people could not  
believe that a man capable of betraying them  
would ever succeed him. Mr. Madison made a  
skilful use of that trust in the integrity of the  
President. “When wc consider,” said he, “that  
the first magistrate is to be appointed at  
present by the suffrages of three millions of peo­  
ple, and in all human probability in a few years  
by double that number, it is not to be presumed  
that an ambitious or designing character will be  
selected. With all the infirmities incident to a  
popular election, corrected by the particular  
mode of conducting it, as directed under the  
present system, we may safely calculate that the  
instances will be very rare in which an unworthy  
man will receive that mark of public confidence  
which is required to designate the President of  
the United Slates.”  
But suppose that Washington, instead of being  
the peerless patriot that he was, had turned his  
back upon his fellow-patriots before he had been  
three months in his seat; that he had sought his  
counsellors among those who had speculated in  
the liberties and grown rich upon the blood of  
his country men; that not content with surround­  
ing himself with the tories and cowboys of the  
revolution, he had offered the additional affront  
to the country ot making them the favorite ob­  
jects of his bounty; that m the distribution of  
his patronage, he had passed by the brave men

with effect, and the power must be conferred  
on the President by the Constitution as the executive  
officer of the Government, Mr. Madison, whose adverse  
opinion in the Fideruliet had been relied upon by those  
who denied the exclusive power now participated in the  
debate. He declared that he had reviewed his former  
opinions, and he summed up the whole case as fol­  
lows:  
The constitution affirms that the executive, power is vested  
in the President. Are there exceptions to this proposition,  
Yes, there are. The constitution says that in appointing to  
office the Senate shall be associated with the President,  
unless in the case of inferior officers, when the law shall  
otherwise direct. Have we (that is Congress) a right to  
extend this exception? I believe not. If the Constitution has  
invested all exective power in the President, I venture to  
assert that the Legistature has no right to diminish or modify  
his executive authority, The question now resolves itself into  
this:-Is the power of displacing an Executive powerr What­  
ever is in the Executive, it is in the power of appointing, over.­  
seeing and controlling those who execute the laws. If the  
constitution had not qualified the power of the President in  
appointing to office by associating the Senate with him in that  
business, would it not be clear that he would have the right,  
by virtue of his executive power, to make such appointmentt  
Should we be authorized in defence of that clause in  
the Constitution, &quot;The Executive power shall be vested  
in the President&quot; to unite the Senate with the Presi-­  
dent in the appointments to office? I conceive not,  
If it is admitted that we should not be autherized  
to do this I think it may be disputed whether we have  
a right to associate them in removing persons from  
office, the one power being as much of an executive nature  
as the other, and the first one is authorized by being ac.­  
cepted out of the general rule established by the constitue  
tion, in these words: &quot;The executive power shall be vested  
in the President.&quot;  
The question thus ably and exhaustively argued was  
decided by the House of Representatives by a vote of 24  
to 20 in favor of the principle that the executive power  
of removal is vested by the Constitution in the Execu-­  
tive, and in the Senate by the casting vote of the Vic

&quot;The Constitution affirms that the executive power is  
vested in the President. Are there exceptions to this  
proposition? Yes; there are. The Constitution says  
that in appointing to office the Senate shall be asrociated  
with the President, unless in the case of inferior officers,  
whe i the law shall otherwise direct. Have we--that  
is Congress,-a right to extend this exception? I be  
lieve not. If the C nstitution has invested all execu

Legislature has no right to diminish or modify his ex­  
ecutive authority. The question now rasolves itself  
tuto this: In the power of displacing an executive

Executive, it is in the power of appointing, overseeing  
and controlling those who execute the lawn. I th  
Constitution had not qualified the power of the Presi  
dent in appointing to office, by associating the Senate  
with him in that business, would it not be clear that he  
would have the right, by virtue of his Executive power  
to make such appointment? Should we be authorized,  
in deflance of that clause of the Constitution,-&quot;the exec  
utive power shall be vested in the President-to unite  
the Senate with the President in the appointment to  
office. I conceive not. If it is admitted that we should  
not be authorized to do this; I think it may be disputed  
whether we have a right to as sociate them in removing  
persons from office, the one power beings much of an  
xecutive nature as the other, and the first one is au

The question, thus ably and exhaustively argued,  
was decided by the House of Representatives by a

Mr. Madison himself said:  
The Constitution affirms that the  
executive power is vested in the  
President. Are there exceptions to  
this proposition? Yes, there are. The  
Constitution says that in appointing  
 office the Senate shall be associated  
with the President, unless in the case  
bfinferio officers, when the law shall  
ptherwise direct. Have we (that is,  
Congress) a right to extend this ex­  
beption? I believe not. If the Con­  
stitution has invested all executive  
power in the President, I return to  
assert that the legislature has no right  
to diminish or modify his executive  
Anthority. The question now resolves  
itself into this: Is the power of dis­  
placing an executive power? I con­  
beive that if any power whatever is in  
the Executive it is in the power of  
sppointing, overseeing and controlling  
those who execute the laws. If the  
Constitution had not qualified the  
power of the President in appointing  
tor office by associating the Senate  
with him in that business, would it  
not be clear that he would have the  
right, by virtue of the executive pow­  
or,e to make such appointment?  
Should we be authorized, in defiance  
bf that clause in the Constitution  
executive power shall be vested in  
the President-to unite the Senate with  
the appointment to office? I conceive  
nol If it is admitted that we should

&quot;The Constitution affirms tha* th.e  
; executive power is vested in the r&lt;^&quot;1  
J dent. Are there exceptions to i. e  
proposition? Yes, there are. The  
Constitution says that in appointing to

with the President, unless in the case  
of inferior officers, when the law shall  
otherwise direct, nave we (that is,

The question now res Ives itself into

executive power ? I conceive that if  
any power whatever is in the Execu­

overseeing aud controlling those who  
execute the laws. If the Constitution  
had not qualified the power of the .  
President in appointing to office by as- j  
sociating the Senate with him in that  
business, would it not be clear that he  
would have the right, by virtue of the

pointment ? Should we be authorized,

tution—&quot;the executive power shall be

Senate with the President in the ap-&#x27;  
pointment to office? Iconceivenot. Ifit  
is admitted that we should not be au-&#x27;
