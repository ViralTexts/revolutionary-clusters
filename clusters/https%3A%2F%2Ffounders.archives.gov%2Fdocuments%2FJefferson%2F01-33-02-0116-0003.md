 of course arrange themselves under the will of the law, &amp; unite in common efforts for the common good. all too will bear in mind this sacred principle that tho the will of the majority is in all cases to prevail, that will, to be rightful, must be reasonable; that the minority possess their equal rights, which equal laws must protect, &amp; to violate would be oppression. let us then, fellow citizens, unite with one heart &amp; one mind, let us restore to social intercourse that harmony &amp; affection without which liberty, &amp; even life itself, are but dreary things. and let us reflect that having banished from our land that religious intolerance under which mankind so long bled &amp; suffered, we have yet gained little if we countenance a political intolerance, as despotic, as wicked, &amp; capable of as bitter &amp; bloody persecutions. during the throes &amp; convulsions of the antient world, during the agonising spasms of infuriated man, seeking thro’ blood &amp; slaughter his long-lost liberty, it was not wonderful that the agitation of the billows should reach even this distant &amp; peaceful shore; that this should be more felt &amp; feared by some &amp; less by others; &amp; should divide opinions as to measures of safety—but every difference of opinion, is not a difference of principle. we have called by  different names brethren of the same principle. we are all republicans: we are all federalists. if there be any among us who would wish to dissolve this Union, or to change it’s republican form, let them stand undisturbed as monuments of the safety with which error of opinion may be tolerated, where reason is left free to combat it. I know indeed that some honest men fear that a republican government cannot be strong; that this government is not strong enough. but would the honest patriot, in the full tide of succesful experiment, abandon a government which has so far kept us free and firm, on the theoretic &amp; visionary fear, that this government, the world’s best hope, may, by possibility, want energy to preserve itself? I trust not. I believe this, on the contrary the strongest government on earth. I believe it the only one where every man, at the call of the law, would fly to the standard of the law, and would meet invasions of the public order, as his own personal concern.—sometimes it is said that man can not be trusted with the government of himself. can he then be trusted with the government of others? or have we found angels, in the forms of kings, to govern him? Let history answer this question.  
Let us then, with courage &amp; confidence, pursue our o

t every side had been ex­

Thomas Jefferson was a versatile man, but  
he was not versatile to the extent that he  
ever believed any part of the Incongruities  
and inconsistencies attributed to him in  
Jefferson day speeches. As a matter of fact,  
the orator of to-day has a way of making  
a Thomas Jefferson to suit his own pur­  
pose. This is very unfair toward one of the  
fathers of the Republic, and that there may  
be a truthful expression of the principles  
of Jefferson, the Journal takes the following  
passage from his first inaugural, delivered  
March 4, 1S01:  
About to enter, fellow-citizens, on the ex­  
ercise of duties which comprehend every­  
thing dear and valuable to you, it is proper  
you should understand what I deem the es­  
sential principles of our government, and  
consequently those, which ought to shape its  
administration. I will compress them within  
the narrowest compass they will bear, stat­  
ing the general principle, but not all its  
limitations.  
Equal and exact justice to all men of  
whatever state or persuasion, religious or  
political; peace, commerce and honest  
friendship with all nations, entangling alli­  
ances with none; the support of the state  
governments in all their rights as the most  
competent administrations for our domestic  
concerns, the surest bulwarks against anti­  
republican tendencies; the preservation of  
the general government in Its whole consti­  
tutional vigor, as the sheet anchor of our  
peace at home and safety abroad; a jealous  
care of the right of election by the people  
a mild and safe corrective of abuses which  
.&quot;are lopped by the sword of revolution where  
(peaceable remedies are unprovided; absolute  
acquiescence in the decisions of the ma
