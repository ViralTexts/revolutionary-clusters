To the Senate &amp; House of Representatives of the US of America  
  
  
  
  
  
  
At a moment when the nations of Europe are in commotion &amp; arming against each other, when those with whom we have principal intercourse are engaged in the general contest, &amp; when the countenance of some of them towards our peaceable country, threatens that even that may not be unaﬀected by what is passing on the general theatre, a meeting of the representatives of the Nation in both houses of Congress has become more than usually desirable. Coming from every section of our Country, they bring with them the sentiments &amp; the information of the whole, &amp; will be enabled to give a direction to the public aﬀairs which the will, &amp; the wisdom of the whole will approve &amp; support.—  
In taking a view of the state of our Country, we, in the ﬁrst place, notice the late aﬄiction of two of our cities under the fatal fever which in latter times has occasionally visited our shores. Providence, in his goodness, gave it an early termination, on this occasion, &amp; lessened the number of victims which have usually fallen before it.—In the course of the several visitations by this disease, it has appeared that it is strictly local, incident to cities &amp; on the tide waters only, incommunicable in the country either by persons under the disease, or by goods carried from diseased places: that it’s access is with the Autumn, &amp; it disappears with the early frosts. These restrictions, within narrow limits of time &amp; space, give security, even to our maritime Cities, during three fourths of the year, &amp; to the Country always. Altho’ from these facts it appears unnecessary, yet, to satisfy the fears of foreign nations, &amp; cautious on their part, not to be complained of, in a danger whose limits are yet unknown to them, I have strictly enjoined on the Oﬃcers at the head of the customs to certify with exact truth, for every Vessel sailing for a foreign port, the state of health respecting this fever which prevails at the place from which she sails. Under every motive from character &amp; duty to certify the truth, I have no doubt they have faithfully executed this injunction. Much real injury has however been sustained from a propensity to identify with this endemic, &amp; to call by the same name, fevers of very diﬀerent kinds which have been known at all times &amp; in all countries, &amp; never have been placed among those deemed contagious. As we advance in our Knowledge of this disease, as facts develope the source from which Individuals recieve it, the State Authorities charged with the care of the public health, &amp; Congress with that of the General Commerce, will become able to regulate with eﬀect their respective functions in these departments. The burthen of Quarentines is felt at home as well as abroad, their eﬃcacy merits examination. Altho’ the health laws of the States should be found to need no present revisal by Congress, yet commerce claims that their attention be ever awake to them.  
Since our last meeting the aspect of our foreign relations has considerably changed. Our Coasts have been infested, &amp; our harbours watched by private armed Vessels, some of them without commissions, some with illegal commissions, others with those of legal form, but committing piratical acts beyond the Authority of their commissions. They have captured in the very entrance of our harbours; as well as on the high Seas, not only the Vessels of our friends coming to trade with us, but our own also, they have carried them oﬀ under pretence of legal adjudication, but, not daring to approach a court of justice, they have plundered &amp; sunk them by the way, or in obscure places, where no evidence could arise against them, maltreated the crews, &amp; abandoned them in boats in the open Sea, or on desert shores, without food or Covering. These enormities appearing to be unreached by any control of their Sovereigns, I found it necessary to equip a force to cruize within our own Seas, to arrest all Vessels of these descriptions found hovering on our Coasts, within the limits of the Gulf Stream, &amp; to bring the oﬀenders in for trial as Pirates.  
The same system of hovering on our coasts and harbours, under colour of seeking enemies, has been also carried on by public armed ships, to the great annoyance and oppression of our Commerce. New principles too have been interpolated into the Law of nations founded neither in justice, nor the usage or acknolegement of nations. According to these, a belligerent takes to itself a commerce, with it’s own enemy, which it denies to a neutral, on the grounds of it’s aiding that enemy in the War, but reason revolts at such an inconsistency, &amp; the neutral having equal right with the belligerent to decide the question, the interests of our constituents, &amp; the duty of maintaining the authority of reason, the only umpire between just nations, impose on us the obligation of providing an eﬀectual &amp; determined opposition to a doctrine so injurious to the rights of peaceable nations. indeed the conﬁdence we ought to have in the justice of others still countenances the hope, that a sounder view of thos

servance of them.  
With Spain our negociations for the settlement of diﬀerences have not had a satisfactory issue. Spoliations during the former war for which she had formally acknoleged herself responsible, have been refused to be compensated, but on conditions aﬀecting other claims in no wise connected with them. Yet the same practices are renewed in the present war, &amp; are already of great amount. On the Mobille our commerce passing through that River continues to be obstructed by arbitrary duties &amp; vexatious searches. Propositions for adjusting amicably the boundaries of Louisiana have not been acceded to. While however the right is unsettled, we have avoided changing the State of things, by taking new Posts, or strengthening ourselves in the disputed territories, in the hope that the other power would not, by a contrary conduct, oblige us to meet their example, &amp; endanger conﬂicts of Authority, the issue of which may not be easily controuled, but in this hope we have now reason to lessen our conﬁdence. inroads have been recently made into the territories of Orleans &amp; the Missisipi,  our Citizens have been seized &amp; their property plundered in the very parts of the former which had been actually delivered up by Spain, and this by the regular Oﬃcers &amp; Soldiers of that Government. I have therefore found it necessary at length to give orders to our troops on that frontier to be in readiness to protect our Citizens &amp; to repel by arms any similar Aggressions in future. Other details necessary for your full information of the state of things between this Country and that, shall be the subject of another communication—  
In reviewing these injuries from some of the belligerent powers, the moderation, the ﬁrmness &amp; the wisdom of the Legislature will all be called into Action. We ought still to hope that time and a more correct estimate of interest as well as of character, will produce the justice we are bound to expect. But should any Nation deceive itself by false calculations, &amp; disappoint that expectation, we must join in the unproﬁtable contest of trying which party can do the other the most harm. Some of these injuries may perhaps admit a peaceable remedy where that is competent it is always the most desirable—but some of them are of a nature to be met by force only, &amp; all of them may lead to it. I cannot therefore but recommend such preparations as circumstances call for. The ﬁrst object is to place our Sea-Port Towns out of the danger of insult. measures have been already taken for furnishing them with heavy Cannon for the service of such land batteries as may make a part of their defence against armed Vessels approaching them. In aid, of these it is desireable we should have a competent number of Gun-boats: &amp; the number to be competent must be considerable. If immediately begun, they may be in readiness for service at the opening of the next season. Whether it will be necessary to augment our land forces, will be decided by occurrences probably in the course of your Session. in the mean time you will consider whether it would not be expedient, for a state of peace as well as of war, so to organise or class the militia, as would enable us, on any sudden emergency, to call for the services of the younger portions, unincumbered with the old &amp; those having families. Upwards of three hundred thousand able bodied men, between the ages of 18. and 26. years, which the last census shews we may now count within our limits, will furnish a competent number for oﬀence or defence, in any point where they may be wanted, &amp; will give time for raising regular forces after the necessity of them shall become certain: &amp; the reducing to the early period of life all it’s active service, cannot but be desireable to our Younger Citizens of the present as well as future times, inasmuch as it engages to them in more advanced age, a quiet &amp; undisturbed repose in the bosom of their families. I cannot then but earnestly recommend to your early consideration the expediency of so modifying our militia system as by a separation of the more active part from that which is less so we may draw from it, when necessary, an eﬃcient corps ﬁt for real &amp; active service &amp; to be called to it in regular rotation.  
Considerable provision has been made under former Authorities from Congress, of materials for the construction of Ships of War of 74. Guns. these materials are on hand, subject to the further will of the Legislature.  
  
An immediate prohibition of the exportation of Arms &amp; Ammunition is also submitted to your determination.  
  
Turning from these unpleasant views of violence &amp; wrong, I congratulate you on the liberation of our fellow Citizens who were stranded on the Coast of Tripoli, &amp; made prisoners of war. in a Government bottomed on the will of all, the life &amp; liberty of every individual Citizen becomes interesting to all. In the treaty therefore which has concluded our warfare with that state, an article for the ransom of our Citizens has been agreed to. An operation by land, by a small band of our Countrymen, &amp; others engaged for the occasion, in conjunction with the troops of the Ex-Bashaw of that country, gallantly conducted by our late Consul Eaton, &amp; their succesful enterprise on the city of Derne, contributed doubtless to the impression which produced peace: and the conclusion of this prevented opportunities, of which the Oﬃcers &amp; Men of our Squadron, destined for Tripoli, would have availed themselves, to emulate the Acts of Valour exhibited by their brethren in the attack of the last year. Reﬂecting with high satisfaction on the distinguished bravery displayed, whenever occasions permitted, in the late Mediterranean service, I think it would be an useful encouragement, as well as a just reward, to make an opening for some present promotion, by enlarging our peace establishment of Captains &amp; Lieutenants.  
With Tunis some misunderstandings have arisen, not yet suﬃciently explained. But friendly discussions with their Ambassador recently arrived, &amp; a mutual disposition to do whatever is just &amp; reasonable, cannot fail of dissipating these, so that we may consider our peace, on that coast generally, to be on as sound a footing as it has been at any preceding time. Still it will not be expedient to withdraw immediately the whole of our force from that Sea.   
  
The Law providing for a Naval peace establishment ﬁxes the number of frigates which shall be kept in constant service, in time of peace, &amp; prescribes that they shall be manned by not more than two thirds of their complement of Seamen &amp; ordinary Seamen. Whether a Frigate may be trusted to two thirds only of her proper complement of men, must depend on the nature of the service on which she is ordered. that may sometimes, for her safety, as well as to ensure her object, require her fullest complement. In adverting to this subject Congress will perhaps consider whether the best limitation on the Executive discretion, in this case, would not be by the number of seamen which may be employed in the whole service, rather than by the number of Vessels. Occasions oftner arise for the employment of small, than of large Vessels: and it would lessen risk, as well as expence, to be authorised to employ them of preference. the limitation suggested, by the number of seamen, would admit a selection of Vessels best adapted to the service.—  
  
Our Indian neighbors are advancing, many of them with spirit, &amp; others beginning to engage, in the pursuits of Agriculture &amp; houshold manufacture. they are becoming sensible that the earth yields subsistence with less labor &amp; more certainty than the forest: and ﬁnd it their interest, from time to time, to dispose of parts of their surplus &amp; waste lands, for the means of improving those they occupy, &amp; of subsisting their families while they are preparing their farms. Since your last session, the Northern tribes have sold to us the lands between the Connecticut reserve &amp; the former Indian boundary, and those on the Ohio, from the same boundary to the Rapids, &amp; for a considerable depth inland. The Chickasaws &amp; Cherokees have sold us the Country between, and adjacent to the two districts of Tennissee; and the Creeks, the residue of their lands in the fork of Ocmulgee, up to the Ulcofauhatché, the three former purchases are important, in as much as they consolidate disjoined parts of our settled Country, &amp; render their intercourse secure: and the second particularly so, as with the small point on the River which we expect is by this time ceded by the Piankeshaws, it compleats our possession of the whole of both banks of the Ohio, from it’s source to near it’s mouth; and the navigation of that river is thereby rendered for ever safe to our Citizens settled &amp; settling on it’s extensive waters. The purchase from the Creeks too has been for some time peculiarly interesting to the State of Georgia.  
The several treaties which have been mentioned will be submitted to both Houses of Congress for the exercise of their respective functions.   
  
Deputations, now on their way to the Seat of Government, from various nations of Indians inhabiting the Missouri &amp; other parts beyond the Missisipi, come charged with assurances of their satisfaction with the new relations in which they are placed with us, of their dispositions to cultivate our peace &amp; friendship, &amp; their desire to enter into commercial inter course with us.  
  
A state of our progress in exploring the principal rivers of that country, &amp; of the information respecting them hitherto obtained, will be communicated as soon as we shall recieve some further relations, which we have reason shortly to expect.   
  
The reciepts at the treasury during the year ending on the 30th. day of September last, have exceeded the sum of thirteen Millions of Dollars, which, with not quite ﬁve Millions in the treasury at the beginning of the year, have enabled us after meeting other demands, to pay nearly two Millions of the debt contracted under the British treaty &amp; convention, upwards of four Millions of principal of the public debt, &amp; four Millions of interest. These payments, with those which had been made in three years and an half preceding, have extinguished, of the funded debt, nearly eighteen Millions of principal.   
  
Congress, by their act of Nov. 10. 1803. authorised us to borrow 1,750,000 Dollars towards meeting the claims of our Citizens assumed by the convention with France—We have not however, made use of this authority, because the sum of four Millions and an half, which remained in the treasury on the same 30th. day of September last, with the reciepts which we may calculate on for the ensuing year, besides paying the annual sum of eight Millions of Dollars, appropriated to the funded debt, &amp; meeting all the current demands which may be expected, will enable us to pay the whole sum of three Millions seven hundred and ﬁfty thousand Dollars assumed by the French Convention, &amp; still leave us a surplus of nearly a Million of Dollars at our free disposal. Should you concur in the provisions of Arms and Armed Vessels recommended by the circumstances of the times, this surplus will furnish the means of doing so.   
  
On this ﬁrst occasion of addressing Congress since, by the choice of my constituents, I have entered on a second term of administration, I embrace the opportunity to give this public assurance that I will exert my best endeavors to administer faithfully the Executive department, &amp; will zealously co-operate with you in every measure which may tend to secure the liberty, property, &amp; personal safety of our fellow Citizens, &amp; to consolidate the republican forms &amp; principles of our Government—  
  
In the course of your Session, you shall recieve all the aid which I can give for the dispatch of public business and all the information necessary for your deliberations, of which the interests of our own Country &amp; the conﬁdence reposed in us by others, will admit a communication.

pective functions.  
Deputations now on their way to the seat of government,  
from various nations of Indians, inhabiting the Missouri and  
other parts beyond the Mississippi, come charged with assuran­  
ces of their satisfaction with the new relations in which they  
are placed with us, of their disposition to cultivate our peact and  
friendship, and their desire to enter into commercial intercourse  
with us. A stale of our progress in exploring the principal  
rivers of that country and of the information respecting them  
hitherto obtained, will be communicated so soon as we shall  
receive some irther relations which we nave reason shortly to  
expect.  
The receipts at the treasury during the year ending on the 30th  
day of September last have exceeded the sum of thirteen mil­  
lions of dollars, which, with not quite five millions in the trea­  
sury at the beginning of the year, have enabled us after meeting­  
ether demands, to pay nearly two millions of the debt contract­  
ed under the British treaty and convention, upwards of  
four millions of principal of the public debt, and four mil­  
lions of interest- These: payments, with those which had been  
made in three years and an half preceding, have extinguished  
ofthe funded debt nearly eighteen millions of principal.  
Congress, by their act of November 10, 1803, authorised us to  
borrow 1,750,000 dollars towards meeting the claims of our  
citizens assumed by the convention with France. We have not  
however made use of this authority : because the sum of four  
millions and an half, which remained in the treasury on the same  
30th day of September last, with the receipts which we may cal­  
culate on for the ensuing year, besides paying the annual sum of  
eight millions of dollars, appropriated to the funded debt, and  
meeting all the current demands wrtfcSimay be expected, will ena­  
ble us to pay the whole sum of three millions seven hundred  
and fifty thousand dollars assumed by the French convention,  
and still leave us a surplus of nearly a million of dollars at our free  
disposal. Should you concur in the provisions of arms and  
armed vessels recommended by the circumstances ot the times,  
this surplus will furnish the means of doing so.

{ele&amp;ion of veilels belt adapted to the fervice.~———Our Indian neighbors  
are advancing, many of them with fpirit, and others beginning to engage in  
the purfuits of agriculture and houfehold manufaiture. They are becoming  
fenfible that the Qﬁ&#x27;th yields fubfiftence with lefs labour than the fareft, and  
find it their interelt from time to time to difpofe of parts of their furplus and  
wafte lands, for the means of improving thole they occupy, and of fubfifting  
their families, while they are preparing their farms. Since your lalt feflion, the  
northern tribes have folc({ to us the lands between the Conneicut referve, and  
the former Indian boundary, and thofe on the Ohio, from the fame boundary  
and its rapids, and for a confiderable depth inland. The Chickafaws and  
and Cherokees have+old us the country between and adjacent to the two dil­  
triéts of Tenneffee ; and the Creeks the refidue of their lands in the fork of  
the Ocmulgee up to the Ulcofauhatche ; the three former purchafes are im­  
portant, inafmuch as they confolidate parts of our fettled country, and render  
their intercourfe fecure; and the fecond particularly fo as, with the fmall  
point on the river which we expe is by this time ceded by the Piankefhaws,  
it completes our poffeflion of the whole of both banks of the Ohio, from its  
fource to near its mouth, and the navigation of that river is thereby rendered  
forever fafe to our ciiizens fettled and fettling on its extenfive waters ; the  
purchafe from the Creeks too has been for fome time particularly interelting  
to the ftate of Georgia.  
The feveral treaties which have been mentioned will be fubmitted to both  
houfes of Congrefs, for the exercife of their refpeckive funétions. s  
Deputies now on their way to the feat of government, from various na­  
tions of Indians inhabiting the Miffouri, and other parts beyond the MiffiTippi,  
come charged with affurances of their fatisfaltion with the new relations in  
which they are placed with us, of their difpofitions to cultivate our peace and  
friendfhip, and they defire to enter into commercial intercourfe with us.  
A ftate of our progrefs in exploring the principal rivers of that country,  
and of the information refpecting thewm hitherto obtained, will be communi­  
cated fo foon as we fhall receive fome further relations which we have realon  
fhortly to expett. &#x27;  
‘The receipts at the treafury during the year ending on the 3oth of Sept.  
lalt, have exceeded the fumn of 13 millions of dollars, which with not quite  
5 millions in the treafury, at the beginning of the year, have enabled us,  
after meeting other demands, to pay nearly two millions of the debt contraét­  
ed under the Britith treaty and convention, upwards of four millions of prin­  
cipal of the public debt, and four millions of intereft: thefe payments, with  
thofe which had been made in three years and a half preceding, have exrin­  
quithed, of the funded debt, nearly 18 millions of principal.  
Cangrefs, by their a&amp;t of Nov. 10, 1803, authorifed us to borrow 1,7 50,c.00  
dollars, towards meeting the claims of our citizens affamed by the convention  
with France. We have not, however, made ufe of this authority, becaufe the  
fum of 4 millions and an half which remained in the treafury on the fame 30th  
day of September laft, with the reccipts which we may calculate on for the en­  
fuing year, befides paying the annual fum of eight millions of dollars, appro­  
priated to the funded debt, and meeting all the current demands which may be  
expetted, will enable us to pay the whole [um of three millions feven hundred  
and fifty thoufand dollars, affumed by the French convention, and ftill leaves  
us a furplus of nearly a million of dollars at our free difpofal, Should you  
concur in the provifions of arms and armed veflels, recommended by the cir­  
comftances of the times, this furplus will furnith the means of deing fo.  
&#x27; On this firft occafion of addrefling Congrefs, fince, by the choice gf my  
conftituents, I have entered on a fecond term of adminiftration, 1 embrage the  
opportunity to give this public aflurance, that I will exert my beil endeavours  
to adminifter faithfully the executive department, 1 will zealously co-eperate  
with you in any meafure which may tend to fecure the liberty, property, and  
perfonal fafety of our fellow-citizens, and to confolidate the republican forms  
and principles of our government. .  
in the courfe of your feffion, you fhall receive all the aid which I car give  
for the difpatch of the public bufinefs, and all the information neceflary for  
your deliberations, of which the interefls of our own country, and the confi­  
dence repoled in us by others, will admit a communicaiion.

charged with assurances of their satisfac-

of printipal of the public debt, and four  
millions of intere-t. ‘These payments, with

10, 1803, authorised us to borrow 1,750,0Cc0  
dollars, towards meeting the claims of our

French Convention, and still leave us a  
surplus of nearly a million of dollars at our  
free disposal. Should you concur in the  
provisions of arms and armed vessels, re-  
commended by the circumstances of the  
times, this surplus will furnish the means  
of doing so.  
  
** On this first occasion of addressing  
Congress, since, by the choice of my con-

The receipts at the treasury during the year ending on  
the 30th September last, have exceeded the sum of thirteen  
millions of dollars, which with not quite five millions in the  
treasury in the beginning of the year, have enabled us, after  
meeting other demands, to pay nearly two million of the  
debts coutracted under the British treaty and convention,  
upwards of four millions of principal of the public debt, and  
four millions of interest: these payments, with those which  
liad been made in three years and a half preceding, have  
extinguished, of the funded debt, nearly eighteen millions of  
principal.  
  
Congress, by their act of November 10th, 1803, authoris-  
  
us to borrow 1,750,000 dollars towards meeting the claims  
of our citizens assumed by the convention with France.  
We have not, however, made use of this authority, because  
the sum of four millions and an half, which remained in the  
treasury on the same SOth day of September last, with the  
receipts which we may calculate on for the ensuing year,  
besides paying the annual sum of eight millions of dollars,  
appropriating to the funded debt, and meeting all the current  
demands whch may be expected, will enable us to pay the  
whole sum of three millions seven hundred and fifty thou-  
sand dollars, assumed by the French convention, and still  
leaves us a surplus of nearly a million of dollars at our free  
disposal; should you concur in the provisions of arms and  
armed vessels recommended by the circumstances of the  
times, this surplus will furnish the means of doing so.  
  
On this first occasion of addressing congress, since, by  
the choice of my constituents, I have entered on a second  
term of administration, I embrace this opportunity to give  
this pubiic assurance, that I will exert my best endeavours to  
administer faithfully the executive department; I will zea-

Deputations, now on their way to the seat of government  
from various nations of Indians inhabiting the Missouri and  
other parts beyond the Mississippi, come charged with assu-  
rances of their satisfaction with the new relations in which they  
are placed with us,of their dispositions to cultivate our peace

SOth day of September last have exceeded the sum of thir-  
teen millions of dollars, which, with not quite five millions in

the debt contracted under the British treaty and convention,  
upwards of iour millions of principal of the public debt, and  
four millions of interest. These payments, with those which  
had been made in three years and a half preceeding, have ex-  
tinguished of the founded debt nearly cight millions of prin-  
cipal.  
  
Congress, by their act of November 10, 1803, authorized  
us to borrow 1,750,000 dollars towards meeting the claims  
of our citizens assumed by the convention with France. We  
have not however made use of this authority: because the  
sum of four millions and a half, which remained in the trea-  
sury on the 30th day of September last, with the receipts  
which we may calculate on for the ensuing year, besides  
paying the annual sum of eight millions of doilars, appropri-  
ated to the funded debt, and meeting all the current demands  
which may be expected, wiil enable us to pay the whole sum of  
three million seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars, assum-  
ed by the French convention, and still leave usa surplus of  
nearly a million of dollars at our free disposal. Should you  
concur in the provisions of arms and armed vessels recom-  
mended by the circumstances of the times, the surplus will fur-  
nish the means of doing so.  
  
On the first occasion of addressing Congress since, by the  
choice of my constituents, I have entered on a second term  
of administration, [embrace the opportunity to give this public  
assurance, that I willexert my best endeavours to administer  
faithfully the Executive Department, and will zealously co-  
operate with you in any measure which may tend to secure  
the liberty, property, and personal safety of our fellow-citizens,  
and to consolidate the republican forms and principles of our  
Government. Inthe course of your session you shall receive  
ali the aid which I can give for the dispatch of the public  
business, and all the information necessary for your delibera-  
tions, of which the interests of our own country, and the con-  
idence reposed in us by others, will admit a communication.
