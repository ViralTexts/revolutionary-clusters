eognis seems to recommend from the example of our sheep and asses, would doubtless improve the human, as it does the brute animal, and produce a race of veritable αρiςτοι. for experience proves that the moral and physical qualities of man, whether good or evil, are transmissible in a certain degree from father to son. but I suspect that the equal rights of men will rise up against this privileged Solomon, and oblige us to continue acquiescence under the ‘Αμαυρωςις γενεος αςτων’ which Theognis complains of, and to content ourselves with the accidental aristoi produced f by the fortuitous concourse of breeders. for I agree with you that there is a natural aristocracy among men. the grounds of this are virtue &amp; talents. formerly bodily powers gave place among the aristoi. but since the invention of gunpowder has armed the weak as well as the strong with missile death, bodily strength, like beauty, good humor, politeness and other accomplishments, has become but an auxiliary ground of distinction. there is also an artificial aristocracy founded on wealth and birth, without either virtue or talents; for with these it would belong to the first class. the natural aristocracy I consider as the most precious gift of nature, for the instruction, the trusts, and government of society. and indeed it would have been inconsistent in creation to have formed man for the social state, and not to have provided virtue and wisdom enough to manage the concerns of the society. may we not even say that that form of government is the best which provides the most effectually for a pure selection of these natural aristoi into the offices of government? the artificial aristocracy is a mischievous ingredient in government, and provision should be made to prevent it’s ascendancy. on the question, What is the best provision? you and I differ; but we differ as rational friends, using the free exercise of our own reason, and mutually indulging it’s errors. you think it best to put the Pseudo–aristoi into a separate chamber of legislation where they may be hindered from doing mischief by their coordinate branches, and where also they may be a protection to wealth against the Agrarian and plundering enterprises of the Majority of the people.

But even in Europe a change has sensibly taken place in the mind of Man. science had liberated the ideas of those who read and reflect, and the American example had kindled feelings of right in the people. an insurrection has consequently begun, of science, talents &amp; courage against rank and birth, which have fallen into contempt. it has failed in it’s first effort, because the mobs of the cities, the instrument used for it’s accomplishment, debased by ignorance, poverty and vice, could not be restrained to ratio

abolishing entails. And this was followed by one abolishing the privilege  
of primogeniture, and dividing the lands of intestates equally among all  
their children or other representatives. These laws, drawn by myself,  
laid the axe to the root of pseudo-aristocracy. And had another which I  
prepared been ——- by the legislature, our work would have been com-  
plete. It was a bill for the more general diffusion of learning. This pro-  
posed to divide every county into wards of five or six miles square, like  
your townships; to establish in each ward a free school for reading,  
writing, and common arithmetic; to provide for the annual selection of  
the best subjects from these schools, who might receive, at the public ex-  
pense, ahigher degree of education at a district school, and from these dis-  
trict schools to select a certain number of the most — subjects, to  
be completed at a University, where all the useful sciences should be  
taught. Worth and genius would thus have been sought out from every  
condition of life, and completely prepared, by education, for defeating the  
competition of wealth and birth for public trusts. My proposition had,  
for a further object, to impart to these wards those portions of self-govern-  
ment for which they are best qualified, by confiding to them the care of  
their poor, their roads, public elections, police elections, the nomination  
of jurors, administration of justice in small cases, elementary exercises of  
militia ; in short, to have made them little republics, with a warden at the  
head of each, for all those concerns which, being under their eye, the  
would better manage than the larger republics of the county or state.  
general call of ward-meetings by their wardens on the same day through  
the State, would at any time produce the genuine sense of the people on  
any required point, and would enable the State to act in mass, as your  
  
eople have so often done, and with so much effect, by their own meetings.  
The law for religious freedom, which made a part of this system, having  
put down the aristocracy of the clergy, and restored to the citizens the  
freedom of the mind, and those of entails and descents maintaining an  
—_ of condition among them, their own education would have raised the  
mass of the people to the high ground of moral respectability necessary to

also an artificial aristocracy, founded on wealth and birth, without
