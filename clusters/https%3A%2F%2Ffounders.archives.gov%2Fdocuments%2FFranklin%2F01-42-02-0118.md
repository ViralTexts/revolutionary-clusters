This verse takes as its point of departure a poem by Isaac Watts that Franklin had reprinted in the Pennsylvania Gazette some fifty years earlier along with the essay in which it appeared. The essay tells of an indolent, self-indulgent man who has an epiphany at the age of thirty. Devoting himself thereafter to leading a useful existence, he performs good works and dies content in the knowledge that his life was of value. At the end of the essay, Watts quotes in Latin and loosely translates three “Scraps of Horace.” The one that Franklin references is the following:  
  
  
Life’s but a Feast; and when we die,  
Horace would say, if he were by,  
Friend, thou hast eat and drunk enough,  
’Tis Time now to be marching off:  
Then like a well-fed Guest depart,  
With cheerful Looks, and Ease at Heart;  
Bid all your Friends Good Night, and say,  
You’ve done the Business of the Day.

ndwriting of the autograph verse (which Butterfield did not see) with that of the facsimile of the epitaph reveals enough differences to convince us that the two pieces were written with different pens at different times. Moreover,  
  
Butterfield and many scholars who relied on his judgment, including our predecessors, did not recognize that the facsimile’s title was forged. Nonetheless, it is possible that Franklin wrote this version of the epitaph in late 1783 or early 1784, as he anticipated his departure from France and reviewed his early life in preparation for resuming his autobiography.  
  
  
  
April 22. 1784.—  
  
  
If Life’s compared to a Feast,  
Near Fourscore Years I’ve been a Guest,  
I’ve been regaled with the best,  
And feel quite satisfyd.  
’Tis time that I retire to Rest;  
Landlord, I thank ye!— Friends, Good Night
