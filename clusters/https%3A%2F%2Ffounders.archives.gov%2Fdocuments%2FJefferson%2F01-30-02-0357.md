ur Letter was handed to me by Mr. Thruston, the Matter therein contained was new to me; I find myself hurt that Mr. Jefferson should have been Attacked with so much Virulence on a Subject which I know he was not Author of, but except a few Mistakes of Names of Person &amp; Places, the Story is substantially true; I was of the first and last of the active Officers who bore the Weight of that War, and on perusing some old Papers of that Date I find some Memoirs, but indepedent of them I have a perfect Recollection of every Transaction relative to Logans Story—The Conduct of Cresap I am perfectly acquainted with, he was not the Author of that Murder, but a Family of the Name of Greathouse—But some Transactions that happened under the Conduct of Captn. Cresap a few Days previous to the Murder of Logan’s Family gave him sufficient Ground to suppose that it was Cresap who had done him the Injury; But to enable you fully to understand the Subject of your Enquiry, I shall relate the Incidents that gave Rise to Logan’s Suspicion; and will enable Mr. Jefferson to do Justice to himself and the Cresap Family, by being made fully acquainted with Facts.  
Kentucky was explored in 1773; A Resolution was formed to make Settlements in the Spring following—&amp; the Mouth of the little Kenhawa was appointed the Place of general Rendevouz—in Order to descend the River from  thence in a Body; Early in the Spring the Indians had done some Mischief, Reports from their Towns were alarming which caused many to decline Meeting and only eighty or ninety Men assembled at the Place of Rendevous, where we lay some Days; A small Party of Hunters which lay about ten Miles below us were fired on by the Indians whom the Hunters beat off and returned to our C&amp; This and many other Circumstances led us to believe that the Indians were determined to make War; the wh[ole] of our Party was exasperated, and resolved n[ot] to be disappointed in their Project of forming a Settlement in Kentucky, as we had every necessary Store that could be thought of—  
An Indian Town called Horse-head Bottom on the Siotho and nearest its mouth lay most in our Way, we resolved to cross the Country &amp; surprize it; Who was to command was the Question; there were but few among us who had experience in Indian Warfare, and they were such as we did not chuse to be commanded by—We knew of Capt. Cresap being on the River about 15 Miles above with some Hands settling a new Plantation and intending to follow us to Kentucky as soon as he had fixed his People, we also knew that he had had Experience in a former War. It was proposed &amp; unanimously agreed on to Send for him to command the Party; A Messenger was dispatched and in half an Hour returned with Cresap; he had heard of our Resolution by some of his Hunters who had fallen in with those from our Camp, and had Set out to come to us; We now thought our little Army (as we called it) compleat, and the Destruction of the Indian Town inevitable; A Council was call’d and to our Astonishment our intended General was the Person who dissuaded us from the Enterprize, alledging that appearances were suspicious, but that there was no Certainty of a War, that if we made the Attempt proposed he had no Doubt of Success, but that a War at any Rate would be the Result, that we should be blamed for it and perhaps justly; but that if we were determined to execute the Plan, he would lay aside all Considerations, send for his People and share our Fortunes; he was then asked what Measure he would recommend to us, his Answer was that we should return to Wheeling a convenient Post to obtain Intelligence of what was going forward, that a few Weeks would determine the Matter, and as it was early in the Spring, if we should find that the Indians were not hostilely disposed we should have full Time to prosecute our entended Settlements in Kentucky; This Measure was adopted and in two Hours the whole Party was under Way; As we ascended the River we met Killbuck and Indian Chief (Delaware) with a small Party; We had a long Conference but obtained very little Satisfaction from him—It was observed that Cresap did not attend this Conference but Kept on the opposite Side of the River, he said that he was afraid to trust himself with the Indians; that Killbuck had frequently attempted to waylay &amp; kill his Father, &amp; that he was doubtful that he should tempted to put Killbuck to Death—On our arrival at Wheeling, the whole Country being pretty well settled thereabouts, the Inhabitants appeared to be much alarmed, and fled to our Camp from every Direction—we offered to cover their Neighbourhood with Scouts, until we could obtain further Information, if they would return to their Plantations; but Nothing we could say would prevail; By this Time we got to be a formidable Party, as all the Hunters &amp; Men without Families &amp;c., in that Quarter joined us—Our Arrival at Wheeling was soon known at Pittsburgh, the whole of that Country at that time being under the Jurisdiction of Virginia Doctor Connelly had been appointed by Dunmore Capt. Commandant of the District then called West Augusta; He Connelly hearing of us  sent a Message addressed to the Party, informing us that a War was to be apprehended, and requesting that we would Keep our Position for a few Days, that Messengers had been sent to the Indian Towns whose Return he daily expected, and the Doubt respecting a War with the Indians would then be cleared up—The Answer we returned was that we had no Inclination to decamp for some time, and during our Stay we should be careful that the Enemy should not harrass the Neighbourhood—But before this Answer could reach Pittsburgh, he had sent a second Express addressed to Capt. Cresap as the most influential Man amongst us informing him that the Messengers had returned from the Indian Towns and that a War was inevitable and begg’d him to use his Influence with the Party to get them to cover the Country until the Inhabitants could fortify themselves—The Time of the Reception of this Letter was the Epoch of open Hostilities with the Indians—the War Post was planted a Council called and the Letter read and the Ceremonies used by the Indians on so important an Occasion acted, and War Was formally declared—The same Evening two Scalps were brought into Camp—The following Day some Canoes of Indians were discovered descending the River, taking Advantage of an Island to cover themselves from our View. They were chased by our Men 15 Miles down the River they were forced ashore and a Battle ensued a few were wounded on both Sides and we got one Scalp only; On Examining their Canoes we found a considerable quantity of ammunition and other warlike Stores—On our Return to Camp a Resolution was formed to march next Day and attack Logan’s Camp, on the Ohio about 30 Miles above Wheeling—We actually march about five Miles, and halted to take some Refreshment, here the Impropriety of executing the proposed Enterprize was argued the Conversation was brought forward by Cresap himself; it was generally agreed that those Indians had no hostile Intentions, as it was a hunting Camp composed of Men Women and Children with all their Stuff with them—This we knew as I myself and others then present had been at their Camp about four weeks before that Time on our way down from Pittsburgh; In short every Person present particularly Cresap (upon Reflection) was opposed to the projected Measure—We returned &amp; on the same Evening decamped and took the Road to Red Stone—It was two Days after this that Logan’s Family was killed, and from the Manner in which it was done it was viewed as a horrid Murder by the whole Country—From Logan’s hearing that Cresap was at the Head of this Party at Wheeling it was no wonder that he considered Cresap as the Author of his Family’s Destruction—  
Since the Receipt of your Letter I have procured the Notes on Virginia, they are now before me; the Action was more barbarous than therein related by Mr. Jefferson; those Indians used to visit &amp; receive Visits from the neighbouring Whites on the opposite Shore, they were on a Visit at Greathouses at the Time they were massacre’d by those People and their associates. The War now raged with all its Savage Fury until the following fall, when a Treaty of Peace was held at Dunmore’s Camp within five Miles of Chilicothe the Indian Capital on the Siotho—Logan did not appear—I was acquainted with him &amp; wished to be informd of the Reason of his absence by one of the Interpreters—The Answer he gave to my Enquiry was “that he was like a Mad Dog, that his Bristles had been up were not yet quite fallen—but that the good Talks now going forward might allay them”—Logan’s Speech to Dunmore now came forward as related by Mr. Jefferson, and was generally believed &amp; indeed not doubted to have been genuine and dictated by Logan—The Army knew it was wrong so far as it  respected Cresap and afforded an Opportunity of rallying that Gentleman on the Subject—I discovered that Cresap was displeased and told him that he must be a very great Man, that the Indians shouldered him with every Thing that had happened—he smiled &amp; said that he had a great Mind to tomahawk Greathouse about the Matter—What is here related is Fact, I was intimate with Cresap, and better acquainted with Logan at that Time than with any other Indian in the Western Country, and had a knowledge of the Conduct of both Parties. Logan is the author of Speech as related by Mr. Jefferson, and Cresap’s Conduct was such as I have herein related—

unanimously ‘agreed to send for him to com-  
mand the party. Messengers were des-  
patched, and in half an hour returned with  
Cresap. He had heard of our resolution  
by some of his hunters, that had fallen in  
with ours, and had set out to come to us.  
  
We now thought our army, as we called  
it, complete, and the destruction of the In-  
dians sure. A council was called, and, to  
our astonishment, our intended Commander-  
in-chief was the person that dissuaded us  
from the enterprise. He said that appear-  
ances were yery suspicious, but there was  
no certainty of a war. ‘That if we made  
the attempt proposed, he had no doubt of  
our success, but a war would, at any rate,  
be the result, and that we should be blamed  
for it; and perhaps justly. Butif we were  
determined to proceed, he would lay aside  
all considerations, send to his camp for his  
people, and share our fortunes.  
  
He was then asked what he would ad-  
vise. His answer was, that we should re-  
turn to Wheeling, as a convenient post, to  
hear what was going forward. ‘That a few  
weeks would determine. As it was early  
in the spring, if we found the Indians were  
not disposed for war, we should have full  
time to return, and make our establishment  
in Kentucky. ‘This was adopted; and in  
two hours the whole were under way. As  
we ascended the river, we met Kill-buck,  
an Indian chief, with a small party. We  
had a long conference with him, but re-  
ceived little satisfaction as to the disposition  
of the Indians. It was observed that Cre-  
sap did not come to this conference, but  
kept on the opposite side of the river. He  
  
said that he was afraid to trust himself with |  
  
the Indians. ‘That Kill-buck had frequent-  
ly attempted to waylay his father, to kill  
him. ‘That if he crossed the river, perhaps |  
his fortitude might fail him, and that he |  
might put Kill-buck to death. On our ar-  
rival at Wheeling, (the country being pretty |  
well settled thereabouts,) the whole of the |  
inhabitants appeared to be alarmed. ‘They |  
flocked to our camp from every direction

and all that we could say could not keep  
them from under our wings. We offered  
to cover their neighborhood with scouts, |  
until further information, if they would re-  
turn to their plantations; but nothing would  
prevail. By this time we had got to be a|  
formidable party. All the hunters, men  
without families, etc., in that quarter, had  
joined our party.  
  
The Hesperian: or, Western ny, Magazine.  
  
  
  
[ Feb.  
  
  
  
  
  
Our arriv al at Wheeling was soon known  
at Pittsburgh. ‘The whole of that country,  
at that time, being under the jurisdiction of  
Virginia, Dr. Conolly had been appointed  
by Dunmore Capt. Commandant of the Dis-  
trict which was called Waugusta. He,  
learning of us, sent a message addressed to  
the party, letting us know that a war was  
to be apprehended ; and requesting that we  
would keep our position for a few days; as  
messages had been sent to the Indians, and  
afew days would determine the doubt. The  
answer he got, was, that we had no inclina-  
tion to quit our quarters for some time.  
That during our stay, we should be careful  
that the enemy should not harass the neigh-  
borhood that we lay in. But before this  
answer could reach Pittsburgh, he sent a  
second express, addressed to Capt. Cresap,  
as the most influential man amongst us; in-  
forming him that the messages had returned  
from the Indians, that war was inevitable,  
and begging him to use his influence with  
the party, to get them to cover the country  
by scouts until the inhabitants could fortify  
themselves. ‘The reception of this letter  
was the epoch of open hostilities with the  
Indians. A new post was planted, a council  
was called, and the letter read by Cresap,  
all the Indian traders being summoned on  
so important an occasion. Action was had,  
and war declared in the most solemn man-  
ner; and the same evening two scalps were  
brought into the camp.  
  
The next day some canoes of Indians  
were discovered on the river, keeping the  
advantage of an island to cover themselves  
from our view. ‘They were chased fifteen  
miles down the river, and driven ashore.  
A battle ensued; a few were woundéd on  
‘both sides; one Indian only taken prisoner.  
On examining their canoes, we found a con-  
siderable quantity of ammunition and other  
warlike stores. On our return to camp, a  
resolution was adopted, to march the next  
day, and attack Logan’s camp on the Ohio  
about thirty miles above us. We did march  
‘about five miles, and then halted to take  
‘some refreshment. Here the impropriety  
‘of executing the projected enterprise was  
argued. ‘The conversation was brought for-  
| ward by Cresap himself. It was generally  
| agreed that those Indians had no hostile in-  
tentions—as they were hunting, and their  
| party was composed of men, women, and  
children, with all their stuff with them.  
This we knew; as T myself and others pre-

sent had been in their camp about four weeks  
past, on our descending the river from Pitts-  
burgh. In short, every person seemed to  
detest the resolution we had set out with.  
We returned in the evening, decamped, and  
took the road to Redstone.  
  
It was two days after this that Logan’s  
family were killed. And from the manner  
in which it was done, it was viewed-as a  
horrid murder. From Logan’s hearing of  
Cresap being at the head of this party on  
the river, it is no wonder that he supposed  
he had a hand in the destruction of his  
family.  
  
Since the reception of your letter, I have  
procured the ** Notes on Virginia.”’ ‘They  
are now before me. ‘The act was more bar-  
barous than there related by Mr. Jefferson.  
Those Indians used to visit, and to return  
visits, with the neighboring whites, on the  
opposite side of the river. ‘They were on  
a visit to.a family of the name of Great-  
house, at the time they were murdered by  
them and their associates.—The war now  
raged in all its savage fury until the fall,  
when a treaty of peace was held at Camp  
Charlotte, within four miles of Chillicothe,  
the Indian capital on the Ohio. Logan did  
not appear. I was acquainted with him,  
and wished to know the reason.  
swer was ‘that he was like a mad dog:  
  
his bristles had been up, and were not yet |  
  
quite fallen; but the good talk now going  
forward might allay them.”’ Logan’s speech  
  
to Dunmore now came forward, as related |  
  
by Mr. Jefferson. It was. thought to be  
clever; though the army knew it to be  
wrong as to Cresap. But it only produced  
a laugh in camp: I saw it displeased Capt.  
  
Cresap, and told him, ‘‘that he must be a |

Rogers Clark, “a resolution was formed to  
march the next day and attack Logan’s  
camp on the Ohio, about thirty miles above  
us. We actually marched about five miles,  
and then halted to take some refreshment.  
Here the impropriety of executing the pro-  
posed enterprise was argued; the conversa-  
tion was brought forward by Cresap himself.  
It was generally agreed that those Indians  
had no hostile intentions, as they were hunt-  
ing, and their party was composed of men,  
women, and children, with all their stuff  
with them. This we knew, as I myself and  
others present had been in their camp about  
four weeks before that time, on our de-  
scending the river from Pittsburg. In short,  
every person present, particularly Cresap,  
upon reflection was opposed to the projected  
measure. We returned, and on the same  
evening decamped, and took the road to  
Redstone.  
  
“Tt was two days after this [April 80]  
that Logan’s family were killed. And from  
the manner in which it was done, it was  
viewed as a horrid murder by the whole  
country. From Logan’s hearing that Cresap  
was at the head of the party at Wheeling,  
it was no wonder that he considered Cresap  
as the author of his family’s destruction.”

rpose being to move down the Ohio  
the next spring. The mouth of’ the  
Little Kanawha was designated as the  
place of general rendezvous, in order  
to descend -the river in a body. Early,  
therefore, in 1774 some eighty or ninety  
men assembled there; more would have  
gone to the appointed place of meeting,  
but reports of the Indians having done  
some mischief, and that there was a  
hostile spirit manifested by the sav-  
ages in their towns, deterred them. One  
of the number of those who met at the  
rendezvous was George Rogers Clark.  
The whole body lay there some days.  
“A party of hunters,’ says Clark,  
‘‘which lay about ten miles below us,  
were fired on by the Indians, whom  
the hunters beat off and returned to  
our camp. This, and many other cir-  
cumstances, led us to believe that the  
Indians were determined to make war.  
The whole of our party was exasperated  
and resolved not to be disappointed in  
their project of forming a settlement in  
Kentucky, as we had every necessary  
store that could be thought of.”  
  
‘‘An Indian town,” continues Clark, -  
‘‘called ‘Horsehead Bottom,’ on the  
Scioto and [the one] nearest its mouth,  
lay most in our way, [so] we resolved  
to cross the country and surprise it.  
Who was to command [us] was the  
question. There were but few among  
us who had [had] experience in Indian  
warfare and they were such as we did  
not choose to be commanded by. We  
knew of Captain [Michael] Cresap  
being on the [Ohio] river, about fifteen  
miles above us, with some hands, set-  
tling a new plantation and intending  
  
  
  
640  
  
to follow us to Kentucky as soon as he  
had fixed his people. We also knew  
that he had had experience in a former  
war. It was proposed and unanimously  
agreed on to send for him to command  
the party. A messenger was dispatched  
and in half an hour returned with  
Cresap. He had heard of our resolu-  
tion by some of his hunters who had  
fallen in with those from our camp,  
and had set out to come tous. We  
now thought our little army (as we  
called it) complete and the destruction  
of the Indian town inevitable.  
  
“A council was called;’’ Clark  
further narrates, ‘“‘and to our astonish-  
ment, our intended general was the per-  
son who dissuaded us from the enter-  
prise, alleging that appearances were  
suspicious, but that there was no  
certainty of war; that if we made the  
attempt proposed he had no doubt of  
success, but that a war, at any rate,  
would be the result ; that we should be  
blamed for it and perhaps justly, but  
that if we were determined to execute  
the plan, he would lay aside all con-  
siderations, send for his people and  
share our fortunes. He was then  
asked what measure he would recom-  
mend to us; his answer was that we  
should return to Wheeling, a conven-  
ient post to obtain intelligence of what  
was going forward; that a few weeks’  
would determine the matter, and, as it  
was early in the spring, if we should  
find that the Indians were not hostilely  
disposed, we would have full time to  
prosecute our intended settlements in  
Kentucky. This measure was adopted.

met Killbuck, an Indian chief (Dela-

“On our arrival at Wheeling,” adds  
Clark, ‘‘the whole country being pretty  
well settled thereabouts, the inhabitants  
appeared to be much alarmed, and fled  
to our camp from every direction. We  
offered to cover their neighborhood  
with scouts until we could obtain further  
information, if they would return to  
  
&#x27; their plantations, but nothing we could  
  
say would prevail. By this time we

we would keep our position for a few  
days; that messengers had been sent  
to the Indian towns whose return he  
daily expected, and the doubt respect-

enemy did not harass the neighbor-
