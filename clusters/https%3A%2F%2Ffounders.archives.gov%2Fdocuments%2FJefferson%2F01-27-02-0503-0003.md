The Secretary of State, to whom was referred by the House of Representatives the Report of a committee on the written message of the President of the United States of the 14th. of February 1791, with instruction to report to Congress the nature and extent of the privileges and restrictions of the commercial intercourse of the United States with foreign Nations, and the measures which he should think proper to be adopted for the improvement of the commerce and navigation of the same, has had the same under consideration, and thereupon makes the following  
Report.  
The nations with which the United States have their chief commercial intercourse, are Spain, Portugal, France, Great Britain, the United Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden, and their American possessions: and the Articles of Export which constitute the Basis of that Commerce, with their respective Amounts, are, Bread stuff, that is to say,

s. The disadvantage of a tenure which may be so suddenly discontinued, was experienced by our Merchants on a late occasion, when an official notification that this law would be strictly enforced, gave them just apprehensions for the fate of their Vessels and cargoes dispatched or destined to the ports of Great Britain. It was privately believed, indeed, that the order of that Court went further than their intention, and so we were, afterwards, officially informed: but the embarrassments of the moment were real and great, and the possibility of their renewal lays our commerce to that Country under the same species  
of discouragement as to other Countries, where it is regulated by a single Legislator: and the distinction is too remarkable not to be noticed, that our navigation is excluded from the security of fixed Laws, while that security is given to the navigation of others

.  
Such being the restrictions on the Commerce and Navigation of the United States, the question is, in what way they may best be removed, modified, or counteracted?  
As to Commerce, two methods occur. 1. By friendly arrangements  
with the several Nations with whom these restrictions exist: or 2. By the separate act of our own Legislatures for countervailing their effects.  
There can be no doubt but that of these two, friendly arrangement is the most eligible. Instead of embarrassing Commerce under piles of regulating Laws, Duties, and Prohibitions, could it be relieved from all it’s shackles in all parts of the World, could every country be employed in producing that which nature has best fitted it to produce, and each be free to exchange with others mutual surplusses, for mutual wants, the greatest mass possible would then be produced of those things which contribute to human life and human happiness; the numbers of mankind would be increased, and their condition bettered.  
Would even a single nation begin with the United States this System of free Commerce, it would be advisable to begin it with that nation; since it is one by one only that it can be extended to all. Where the circumstances of either party render it expedient to levy a revenue by way of impost on Commerce, it’s freedom might be modified in that particular by mutual and equivalent measures, preserving it entire in all others.  
Some nations not yet ripe for free commerce in all it’s extent, might still be willing to mollify it’s restrictions and regulations for us, in proportion to the advantages which an intercourse with us might offer. Particularly they may concur with us in reciprocating the Duties to be levied on each side, or in compensating any excess of duty by equivalent advantages of another nature. Our Commerce is certainly of a character to entitle it to favor in most countries. The Commodities we offer are either Necessaries of life; or Materials for manufacture; or convenient Subjects of Revenue: and we take in exchange, either manufactures when they have received the last finish of Art and Industry; or mere Luxuries. Such Customers may reasonably expect welcome, and friendly treatment at every market: Customers too, whose demands, increasing with their wealth and population, must very shortly give full employment to the whole Industry of any nation whatever, in any line of supply they may get into the habit of calling for from it.  
But should any nation, contrary to our wishes, suppose it may better find it’s advantage by continuing it’s System of prohibitions, duties, and regulations, it behoves us to protect our Citizens their Commerce and navigation, by counter-prohibitions, duties, and regulations also. Free Commerce and navigation are not to be given in exchange for restrictions and vexations: nor are they likely to produce a relaxation of them.  
Our Navigation involves still higher considerations. As a Branch of Industry, it is valuable; but, as a resource of Defence, essential.  
It’s value, as a Branch of Industry is enhanced by the dependence of so many other Branches on it. In times of Peace it multiplies competitors  
for employment in transportation, and so keeps that at it’s proper level; and in times of war, that is to say, when those nations who may be our principal carriers shall be at war with each other, if we have not within ourselves the means of transportation, our produce must be exported in belligerent vessels at the increased expense of war freight and insurance, and the articles which will not bear that must perish on our hands.  
But it is as a resource for Defence that our Navigation will admit neither neglect nor forbearance. The position and circumstances of the United States leave them nothing to fear on their land-board, and nothing to desire beyond their present rights. But on their Sea-board, they are open to injury, and they have there too, a Commerce which must be protected. This can only be done by possessing a respectable body of Citizen-seamen, and of artists and establishments in readiness for shipbuilding.  
Were the Ocean, which is the common property of all, open to the Industry of all, so that every person and vessel should be free to take employment wherever it could be found, the United States would certainly not set the example of appropriating to themselves, exclusively, any portion of the common stock of occupation. They would rely on the enterprise and activity of their Citizens for a due participation of the Benefits of the seafaring Business, and for keeping the marine class of Citizens equal to their object. But if particular Nations grasp at undue shares, and more especially if they seize on the means of the United States to convert them into aliment for their own strength, and withdraw them entirely from the support of those to whom they belong, defensive and protecting measures become necessary on the part of the Nation whose marine resources are thus invaded; or it will be disarmed of it’s defence; it’s productions will lie at the mercy of the nation which has possessed itself exclusively of the means of carrying them, and it’s politicks must be influenced by those who command it’s commerce. The carriage of our own commodities, if once established in another Channel, cannot be resumed in the moment we may desire. If we lose the Seamen and Artists whom it now occupies, we lose the present means of marine defence, and time will be requisite to raise up others when disgrace or losses shall bring home to our feelings the Error of having abandoned them. The materials for maintaining our due share of navigation are ours in abundance. And as to the mode of using them, we have only to adopt the principles of those who thus put us on the defensive, or others equivalent and better fitted to our circumstances.

t quantity, and which, at the same time we could the soonest furnish to ourselves, or obtain from other Countries; imposing on them duties, lighter at first, but heavier and heavier afterwards as other channels of supply open. Such duties having the effect of indirect encouragement to domestic manufactures of the same kind, may induce the manufacturer to come himself into these States, where cheaper Subsistence, equal Laws, and a vent of his wares free of duty may ensure him the highest profits from his Skill and Industry. And here it would be in the power of the State Governments to co-operate essentially by opening the resources of encouragement which are under their controul, extending them liberally to Artists in those particular Branches of manufacture, for which their Soil, Climate, Population and other Circumstances have matured them, and fostering the precious efforts and progress of household manufacture by some patronage suited to the nature of it’s objects, guided by the local informations they possess and guarded against abuse by their presence and attentions. The oppressions on our agriculture in foreign ports would thus be made the occasion of relieving it from a dependence on the councils and conduct of others, and of promoting arts, manufactures, and population at home.

It is true we must expect some inconvenience in practice from the establishment of discriminating duties. But in this, as in so many other cases, we are left to chuse between two evils. These inconveniencies are nothing, when weighed against the loss of wealth, and loss of force, which will follow our perseverance in the Plan of indiscrimination. When once it shall be perceived that we are either in the System, or the Habit, of giving equal advantages to those who extinguish our commerce and navigation by Duties and Prohibitions, as to those who treat both with liberality and justice, liberality and Justice will be converted by all into Duties and Prohibitions. It is not to the moderation and Justice of others we are to trust for fair and equal access to market with our productions, or for our due share in the transportation of them; but to our own means of independence, and the firm will to use them. Nor do the inconveniencies of discrimination merit consideration. Not one of the nations beforementioned; perhaps, not a commercial Nation on Earth, is without them. In our Case, one distinction alone will suffice, that is to say, between Nations who favor our productions and navigation, and those who do not favor them. One set of moderate Duties, say the present Duties, for the first, and a fixed advance on these as to some Articles, and prohibitions, as to others, for the last.  
Still it must be repeated that friendly arrangements are preferable with all who will come into them; and that we should carry into such arrangements all the Liberality and Spirit of accommodation which the nature of the Case will admit.  
France has, of her own accord, proposed Negotiations for improving, by a new Treaty on fair and equal principles, the commerical relations of the two Countries. But her internal disturbances have hitherto prevented the prosecution of them to effect, though we have had repeated assurances of a continuance of the disposition.  
Proposals of friendly arrangement have been made on our part by the present government to that of Great Britain, as the Message states: but being already on as good a footing in Law, and a better in Fact, than the most favored nation, they have not as yet, discovered any disposition to have it meddled with.  
  
We have no reason to conclude that friendly arrangements would be declined by the other nations with whom we have such

from all its shackles, in all parts of the world; could every  
country be employed in producing that which nature has  
best fitted it to produce, and each be free to exchange with  
others mutual surplusses for mutual wants, the greatest mass  
possible would then be produced of those things which con-  
tribute to human life and human happiness ; the numbers of  
mankind would be increased and their condition bettered.  
Would even a single nation begin with the United States  
this system of free commerce, it would be adviseable to begin  
it with that nation; since it is one by one only, that it can  
be extended to all. When the circumstances of either party  
render it expedient to levy a revenue, by way of impost on  
commerce, its freedom might be modified in that particular,  
by mutual and equivalent measures, preserving it entire in all  
others. Some nations, not yet ripe for free commerce in all  
its extent might still be willing to modify its restrictions and  
regulations for us, in proportion to the advantages which an  
intercourse with us might offer. Particularly they may con-  
cur with us in reciprocating the duties to be levied on each  
side, or in compensating any excess of duty by equivalent  
advantages of another nature. Our commerce is certainly of  
a character to entitle it to favour in most countries. The  
commodities we offer are either necessaries of life or materi

In the words of Mr. Jefferson, in a report which he  
made to Congress on the 16th of December, 1793, on the  
subject of commercial privileges and restrictions, “should  
any nation, contrary to our wishes, suppose it may better  
find its advance by continuing its system of prohibitions,  
duties, and regulations, it behooves us to protect-our cit-  
izens, their commerce and navigation, by counter prohi-

navigation are not to be given in exchange for restriction  
and vexations; nor are they likely to produce a relaxation  
of them.”

1791, made to Congress his celebrated Report on  
the privileges and restrictions of the Commerce  
of the United States in Foreign Countries.  
This is one of the ablest documents which have  
ever emanated from Mr. Jefferson, and it would  
be well if those politicians and legislators who  
pretend to be his followers at the present time,  
would follow the line of policy marked out in this  
Report; namely, protection of our commerce and  
industry.  
A few extracts will be interesting, as showing  
the state of our commerce half a century since,  
and the course toward foreign nations recom  
mended by Mr. Jefferson.  
The countrics with which the United States  
have their chief commercial intercourse, are  
Spain, Portugal, France, Great Britain, the Unis  
ted Netherlands Denmark and Sweden, and their  
American possessions; and the articles of export,  
which constitute the basis of that commerce  
with their respective amounts, are:  
Bread Stuffa (Flour, Grain, Meals and Bread):$7,519,887  
434,00  
 e  
Wood in sease;  ot  
Salted Fish.

  a  
Whal Oule sssaarwassernuwwe reas as  
Tar, Pitch and Turpentine.  
Live Provisions.  
Ships tmount left bland  
Forign Goods t sourt  
Gt will be observed that Cotton was not then mentioned  
among our exported  
To descend to articles of smaller value than  
these would lead into a minuteness of detail nei  
ther necessary nor useful to the present object.&quot;  
&quot;The proportions of our exports which go to  
the nations before mentioned and to their domin.  
ions, and our imports from the same, respectively,  
are as follows:  
o snrts and ha das ss.. Erporth Iaparit  
o   ed   
These imports consist mostly of articles on  
which industry has been exhausted.&quot;  
&quot;Our navigation, depending on the same com.  
merce, will appear by the following statement of  
the tonnage of our own vessels entering in our  
ports, from those several nations and their posses.­  
in one year; that is to say tiom October,  
1789, to September, 1790, inclusive, was as foll

But should any nation, contrary to our wishes,  
suppose it may better find its advantage by con

It is not to the moderation and justice of others  
we are to trust for fair and equal access to mar-  
ket with our productions, or for our due share in  
the transportation of them; but to our own means  
of independence, and the firm will to use them.  
Nor do the inconveniences of discrimination  
merit consideration. Not one of the nations be-  
fore mentioned, perhaps not a commercial nation  
on earth, is without them. In our case, one dis-  
tinction alone will suffice; that is to say, between  
nations who favor our productions and navigation,  
and those who do not favor them. One set of  
moderate duties, say the present duties, for the  
first, and a fixed advance on these as to some ar-  
ticles, and prohibitions as to others, for the last.  
Still it must be repeated that friendly arrange.

them; and that we should carry into such ar-  
rangements all the liberality and spirit of accom­  
dation which the nature of the case will admit.
