Dear Sir  
Monticello May 28. 16.  
  
On my return from a long journey, and considerable absence from home, I found here the copy of your ‘Enquiry into the principles of our government’ which you had been so kind as to send me, and for which I pray you to accept my thanks. the difficulties of getting new works in our situation, inland and without a single book store, are such as had prevented my obtaining a copy before; and letters which had accumulated during my absence, &amp; were calling for answers, have not yet permitted me to give to the whole a thorough reading: yet certain that you and I could not think differently on the fundamentals of rightful government, I was impatient, and availed myself of the intervals of repose from the writing table, to obtain a cursory view idea of the body of the work. I see in it much matter for profound reflection; much which should confirm our adhesion, in practice, to the good principles of our constitution, and fix our attention on what is yet to be made good. the 6th section on the good moral principles of our government, I found so interesting and replete with sound principle, as to postpone my letter-writing to it’s thoro’ perusal and consideration. besides much other good matter, it settles unanswerably the right of instruction to instructing  representatives, and their duty to obey. the system of banking we have both equally and ever reprobated. I contemplate it as a blot left in all our constitutions, which, if not covered, will end in their destruction, which is already hit by the gamblers in corruption, and is sweeping away, in it’s progress the fortunes &amp; morals of our citizens. funding I consider as limited, rightfully, to a redemption of the debt within the lives of a majority of the generation contracting it; every generation coming equally, by the laws of the creator of the world, to the free possession of the earth he made for their subsistence, unincumbered by their predecessors, who, like them, were but tenants for life. you have

. indeed it must be acknoleged that the term republic, is of very vague application in every language. witness the self-styled republics of Holland, Switzerland, Genoa, Venice, Poland. were I to assign to this term a precise and definite idea, I would say that, purely and simply, it means a government, by it’s citizens, in mass, acting directly and personally, according  
			 to  
			 rules established by the majority: and that every other government is more or less republican in proportion as it has in it’s composition more or less of this ingredient of the direct action of

uents. this I should consider as the nearest approach to a pure republic which is practicable  
			 on a large scale of country or population. and we have examples of it in some of our state-constitutions, which, if not poisoned by priest-craft, would prove it’s excellence over all mixtures  
			 with  
			 other elements; and, with only equal doses of poison, would still be the best.   other shades of republicanism may be found in other forms of  
			 government, where the Executive, Judiciary, and  
			 Legislative functions, and the different branches of the latter are chosen by the people more or less directly, for longer terms of years, or for life, or made hereditary; or where there are  
			 mixtures  
			 of authorities, some dependant, and others independant of the people. the further the departure from direct and constant controul by the citizens, the less has the government of the ingredient of  
			 republicanism; evidently none

In the General government the House of Representatives is mainly republican; the Senate scarcely so, at all, as not elected by the people directly, and so long secured even against those who do elect them. the Executive more republican than the Senate, from it’s shorter term, it’s election by the people, in practice, (for they vote for A. only on an assurance that he will vote for B.) &amp; because, in practice also, a principle of rotation seems to be in a course of establishment. the Judiciary independant of the Nation, their coercion by impeachment being found nugatory.  
If then the controul of the people over the organs of their government be the measure of it’s republicanism, and I confess I know no other measure, it must be agreed that our governments have much less of republicanism, than ought to have been expected; in other words that the people have less regular controul over their agents than their rights &amp; their interest required. and this I ascribe, not to any want of republican dispositions in those who formed these constitutions, but to a submission of true principle to European authorities, to Speculators on government, whose fears of the people have been inspired by the populace of their own great cities, and were unjustly entertained against the independant, the happy, &amp; therefore orderly citizen of the US. much I apprehend that the golden moment is past for reforming these heresies. the functionaries of public power rarely strengthen in their dispositions to abridge it, and an unorganised call  
			 for timely amendment is not likely to prevail against an organised opposition to it. we are always told that things are going on well; why change them? ‘chi sta

ll.’ this is true; &amp; I verily believe they would go on well with us under an absolute monarch, while our present character  
			 remains, of order, industry &amp; love of peace, and restrained as he would be by the proper spirit of the people. but it is while it remains such, we should provide against the consequences of  
			 it’s  
			 deterioration.—and let us rest in the hope that it will yet be done, &amp; spare ourselves the pain of evils which may never happen.  
On this view of the import of the term republic, instead of saying, as has been said, that ‘it may mean anything or nothing,’ we may say, with truth and meaning, that governments are more or less republican as they have more or less of the element of popular election and controul in their composition: &amp; beleiving, as I do, that the mass of the citizens is the safest depository of their own rights, &amp; especially that the evils flowing from the duperies of the people are less injurious than those from the egoism of their agents, I am a friend to that composition of government which has in it the most of this ingredient. And I sincerely believe with you, that banking establishments are more dangerous than standing armies; &amp; that the principle  of spending money to be paid by posterity, under the name of funding, is but swindling futurity on a large scale

■“What constitutes a State?  
Not high raised battlements nor labor’d  
mound,  
Thick wall or moated ga te:  
Not cities proud, with spires and turrets  
crowned;—  
No, men, high-minded men,  
Men, who their duties know;  
But know their rights, and knowing, dare  
maintain;  
These constitute a State.

&quot;In the General Government the House of Rep­  
resentatives is mainly republican; the Senate scarcely  
not af all, as Nor eleored ny ThE peopLe DirecrlY,  
and so long secured even against those who do elect  
them; the Executive more republican than the Sen­  
ate, from its shorter term, its election by the peo­  
ple, in pructice, (for they vote for A only on an as­  
surance that he will vote for B) and because, in  
pructice also, a principle of rotation seems to be in a  
course of establishment; the judiciary independent  
of the nation, their coercion by impeachment being  
found nugatory.  
&quot;If then, the control of the people over the or­

publicanism, and I confess I know no other meas­

what does this body represent? It represents the people and  
their property; for one half the members of one house are appor-  
tioned according to taxable property, and all the members of the  
other represent arbitrary divisions of the territory. Do the Sen-  
ators represent this? It is now evident that, by this course of  
reasoning, we will never reach any but a negative conclusion.  
Let us, then, adopt another.  
  
The graceful imagination of a poet has undertaken to define a  
State. ‘* What constitutes a State?” it is asked:  
  
“ Not high-raised battlements, or labor’d mound,  
Thick wall, or moated gate ;  
Not cities proud, with spires and turrets crown’d ;  
No! Men, high-minded men,  
Men, who their duties know;  
But know their rights; and knowing, dare maintain.  
These constitute a State !”

institutions? What the republic needs is men, and the education  
that develops the best manhood is its best friend :

The strength of manhood is in virtue which springs from faith  
in Christ, whose maxims are to guide in the development of true  
character. Christianity is divinely commissioned to teach all  
nations, and insists that the child be taught according to the  
Gospel.

the blessing of Mother Church, and teach science and literature in  
an atmosphere of religion in the church schools. America need  
never fear those schools. They are not rivals but co-workers in

“‘ Were I to assign to this term (the word Republic) a pre-  
cise and definite idea, I would say, purely and simply it  
means a government by its citizens in mass, acting directly  
and personally, according to rules established by the  
majority ; and that every other government is more or less  
republican, in proportion as it has in its composition more  
or less of this ingredient of the direct action of its citizens.  
. . . The further the departure from direct and constant  
control by the citizens, the less has the government of the  
ingredient of republicanism. . . . If, then, the control of  
the people over the organs of their government be the  
measure of its republicanism—and I confess I know no  
other measure—it must be agreed that our governments  
have much less of republicanism than ought to be expected ;  
in other words, that the people have less regular control  
over their agents than their rights and their interests  
require; . . . and, believing as I do that the mass of the

Since the change in the organization of the American  
Board, a little more than a year ago, there has been new  
confidence in its future, both at home and abroad. That  
this confidence has not been misplaced has been proved by  
the fact that many necessary reforms in the methods of the  
working of the Board are already in progress.
