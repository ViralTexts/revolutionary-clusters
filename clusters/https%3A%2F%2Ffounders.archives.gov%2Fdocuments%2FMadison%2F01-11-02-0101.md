hich I shall consider, is, whether the subjects of its cognizance be proper subjects of a federal jurisdiction. The second will be, whether the provisions respecting it be consistent with safety and propriety, will answer the purposes intended, and suit local circumstances. The first class of cases to which its jurisdiction extends, are those which may arise under the constitution; and this is to extend to equity as well as law. It may be a misfortune that in organizing any government, the explication of its authority should be left to any of its co-ordinate branches. There is no example in any country where it is otherwise. There is a new policy in submitting it to the judiciary of the United States. That causes of a federal nature will arise, will be obvious to every gentleman, who will recollect that the states are laid under restrictions; and that the rights of the union are secured by these restrictions. They may involve equitable as well as legal controversies. With respect to the laws of the union, it is so necessary and expedient that the judicial power should correspond with the legislative, that it has not been objected to. With respect to treaties, there is a peculiar propriety in the judiciary expounding them. These may i

d be a supreme court to decide such disputes. If in any case uniformity be necessary, it must be in the exposition of treaties. The establishment of one revisionary superintending power, can alone secure such uniformity. The same principles hold with respect to cases affecting ambassadors, and foreign ministers. To the same principles may also be referred their cognizance in admiralty and maritime cases. As our intercourse with foreign nations will be affected by decisions of this kind, they ought to be uniform. This can

.  
The next case, where two or more states are the parties, is not objected to. Provision is made for this by the existing articles of confederation; and there can be no impropriety in referring such disputes to this tribunal.  
Its jurisdiction in controversies between a state and citizens of another state, is much objected to, and perhaps without reason. It is not in the power of individuals to call any state into court. The only operation it can have, is, that if a state should wish to bring suit against a citizen, it must be brought before the federal court. This will give satisfaction to individuals, as it will prevent citizens on whom a state may have a claim, being dissatisfied with the state courts. It is a case which cannot often happen, and if it should be found improper, it will be altered. But it may be attended with good effects. This may be illustrated by other cases. It is provided, that citizens of different states may be carried to the federal court. But this will not go beyond the cases where they may be parties. A feme covert may be a citizen of another state, but cannot be a party in this court. A subject of a foreign power having a dispute with a citizen of this state, may carry it to the federal court; but an alien enemy cannot bring suit at all. It appears to me, that this can have no operation but this—to give a citizen a right to be heard in the federal court; and if a state should condescend to be a party, this court may take cognizance of it.  
As to its cognizance of disputes between citizens of different states, I will not say it is a matter of such importance. Perhaps it might be left to the state courts. But I sincerely believe this provision will be rather salutary, than otherwise. It may happen that a strong prejudice may arise in some states, against the citizens of others, who may have claims against them. We know what tardy, and even defective administration o

. Industry and œconomy are their only resources. It is in vain to wait for money, or temporise. The great desiderata are public and private confidence. No country in the world can do without them. Let the influx of money be ever so great, if there be no confidence, property will sink in value, and there will be no inducements or emulation to industry. The circulation of confidence is better than the circulation of money. Compare the situation of nations in Europe, where justice is administered with celerity, to that of those where it is refused, or administered tardily. Confidence produces the best effects in the former. The establishment of confidence will raise the value of property, and relieve those who are so unhappy as to be involved in debts.

But Hamilton was not alone in protesting against the con-  
struction put upon the Constitution by its opponents. In  
the Virginia convention the same objections were raised by  
George Mason and Patrick Henry, and were met by Madison  
and Marshall as follows. Madison said: “ Its jurisdiction [the  
federal jurisdiction] in controversies between a State and  
citizens of another State is much objected to, and perhaps  
without reason. It is not in the power of individuals to call  
any State into court. The only operation it can have is that,  
if a State should wish to bring a suit against a citizen, it must  
be brought before the federal court. This will give satisfac-  
tion to individuals, as it will prevent citizens on whom a State  
may have a claim being dissatisfied with the state courts.  
  
It appears to me that this [clause] can have no opera-  
  
tion but this—to give a citizen a right to be heard in the  
federal courts ; and if a State should condescend to be a party,  
this court may take cognizance of it.” 3 Elliott’s Debates,  
2d ed. 533. Marshall, in answer to the same objection, said:  
“ With respect to disputes between a State and the citizens of  
another State, its jurisdiction has been decried with unusual  
vehemence. I hope that no gentleman will think that a Stat
