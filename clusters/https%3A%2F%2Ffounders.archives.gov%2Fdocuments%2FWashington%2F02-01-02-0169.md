*¢* Dear Brotrner,—dAs | have heard, since my arrival at this place, a  
circumstantial account of my death and dying speech, I take this early  
opportunity of contradicting the first, and of assuring you, that I have not  
as yet composed the latter. But, by the all-powerful dispensations of  
Providence, I have been protected beyond all human probability or ex-  
pectation; for I had four bullets through my coat, and two horses shot  
under me, yet escaped unhurt, although death was levelling my compan-  
ions on every side of me!  
  
‘** We have been most scandalously beaten by a trifling body of men, but  
fatigue and want of time prevent me from giving you any of the details,  
until I have the happiness of seeing you at Mount Vernon, which I now  
most ardently wish for, since we are driven in thus far. A feeble state of  
health obliges me to halt here for two or three days, to recover a little  
strength, that I may thereby be enabled to proceed homewards with more  
ease. You may expect to see me there on Saturday or Sunday fortnight,  
which is as soon as I can well be down, as I shall take my Bullskin  
Plantations in my way. Pray give my compliments to all my friends. I  
am, dear Jack, your most affectionate brother.’ ”
