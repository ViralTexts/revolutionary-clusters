Anti Tariff Resolutions adopted by the Legislature of Virginia.  
At the Session of 1825.6.  
&quot;1. Be it therefore resolved, That the imposition of taxes and duties by the Congress of the U. States, for the purpose of  
protecting and encouraging domestic manufactures, is an unconstitutional exercise of power, and is highly oppressive  
&amp; partial in its operation.&quot;  
At the session of 1826.7.  
&quot;2. Resolved, in like manner, that this General Assembly does, hereby, most solemnly protest against any claim or exercise  
of power, whatever, on the part of the General Government, which serves to draw money from the inhabitants of this state,  
into the treasury of the U. States, and to disburse it for any object whatever, except for carrying into effect the grants  
of power to the General Government, contained in the Constitution of the U. States.&quot;  
&quot;3. Resolved, in like manner, that this General Assembly does most solemnly protest against the claim or exercise of any  
power, whatever, on the part of the General Government, to protect domestic manufactures, the protection of manufactures  
not being amongst the grants of power to that government, specified in the Consn. of the U. States; and also, against the  
operations of the act of Congress, passed May 22d., 1824, entitled, &quot;An Act to amend the several acts imposing duties on  
imports,&quot; generally called the Tariff law, which vary the distribution of the proceeds of the labour of the community, in  
such a manner as to transfer property from one portion of the United States to another, and to take private property from  
the owner for the benefit of another person, not rendering public service, as unconstitutional, unwise, unjust, unequal  
&amp; oppressive.&quot;  
At the Session of 1828.9.  
&quot;3. Resolved, that this general Assembly of Virginia, actuated by the desire of guarding the Constitution from all  
violation, anxious to preserve &amp; perpetuate the Union, and to execute with fidelity the trust reposed in it by the  
people, as one of the high contracting parties, feels itself bound to declare, and it hereby most solemnly declares its  
deliberate conviction that the acts of Congress usually denominated the tariff Laws, passed avowedly for the protection of  
domestic manufactures, are not authorized by the plain construction, true intent &amp; meaning of the Constitution.&quot;  
Note (1). See Madison’s Report published by Thos. Ritchie 1819
