Proceeding, fellow citizens, to that qualification which the constitution requires before my entrance on the charge again conferred on me, it is my duty to express the deep sense I entertain of this new proof of confidence from my fellow citizens at large, and the zeal with which it inspires me so to conduct myself as may best satisfy their just expectations.  
On taking this station on a former occasion, I declared the principles on which I believed it my duty to administer the affairs of our commonwealth. my conscience tells me I have, on every occasion acted up to that declaration, according to it’s obvious import, and to the understanding of every candid mind.  
In the transaction of your foreign affairs, we have endeavored to cultivate the friendship of all nations, &amp; especially of those with which we have the most important relations. we have done them justice on all occasions; favor, where favor was lawful, &amp; cherished mutual interests &amp; intercourse on fair &amp; equal terms. we are firmly convinced and we act on that conviction, that with nations, as with individuals, our interests, soundly calculated, will ever be found inseparable from our moral duties. and history bears witness to the fact, that a just nation is trusted on it’s word, when recourse is had to armaments and wars to bridle others.  
At home, fellow-citizens, you best know whether we have done well or ill. the suppression of unnecessary offices, of useless establishments and expences, enabled us to discontinue our internal taxes. these covering our land with officers, &amp; opening our doors to their intrusions, had already begun that process of domiciliary vexation, which, once entered, is scarcely to be restrained from reaching successively every article of property &amp; produce. if, among these taxes, some minor ones fall, which had not been inconvenient, it was because their amount would not have paid the officers who collected them: and because if they had any merit, the state-authorities might adopt them instead of others less approved.  
The remaining revenue, on the consumption of foreign articles, is paid chiefly by those who can afford to add foreign luxuries to domestic comforts. being collected on our sea-board and frontiers only, &amp; incorporated with the transactions of our mercantile citizens, it may be the pleasure and the pride of an American to ask What farmer, what mechanic, what labourer ever sees a tax-gatherer of the US.? these contributions enable us to support the current expences of the government, to fulfill contracts with foreign nations, to extinguish the native right of soil within our limits, to extend those limits, &amp; to apply such a surplus to our public debts, as places at a short day their final redemption. and, that redemption once effected, the revenue thereby liberated may, by a just repartition of it among the states, &amp; a corresponding amendment of the constitution, be applied, in time of peace, to rivers, canals, roads, arts, manufactures, education, &amp; other great objects within each state.     
in time of war, if injustice by ourselves or others must sometimes produce war, increased as the same revenue will be by increased population &amp; consumption, &amp; aided by other resources reserved for that crisis, it may meet within the year all the expences of the year, without encroaching on the rights of future generations by burthening them with the debts of the past. War will then be but a suspension of useful works; &amp; a return to a state of peace a return to the progress of improvement.  
I have said, fellow-citizens, that the income reserved had enabled us to extend our limits. but that extension may possibly pay for itself, before we are called on, &amp; in the mean time may keep down the accruing interest: in all events it will replace the advances we shall have made. I know that the acquisition of Louisiana has been disapproved by some, from a candid apprehension that the enlargement of our territory would endanger it’s union. but who can limit the extent to which the federative principle may operate effectively? the larger our association, the less will it be shaken by local passions. and in any view, is it not better that the opposite bank of the Missisipi should be settled by our own brethren &amp; children than by strangers of another family? with which should we be most likely to live in harmony and friendly intercourse?  
In matters of Religion, I have considered that it’s free exercise is placed by the constitution independant of the powers of the general government. I have therefore undertaken, on no occasion, to prescribe the religious exercises suited to it: but have left them, as the constitution found them, under the direction &amp; discipline of the state or church authorities acknoleged by the several religious societies.  
The Aboriginal inhabitants of these countries I have regarded with the commiseration their history inspires. endowed with the faculties &amp; the rights of men, breathing an ardent love of liberty and independance, &amp; occupying a country which left them no desire but to be undisturbed, the stream of overflowing population from other regions directed itself on these shores. without power to divert, or habits to contend against it, they have been overwhelmed by the current, or driven before it. now reduced within limits too narrow for the hunter-state, humanity enjoins us to teach them agriculture &amp; the domestic arts; to encourage them to that industry which alone can enable them to maintain their place in existence, &amp; to prepare them in time for that state of society, which to bodily comforts adds the improvement of the mind &amp; morals. we have therefore liberally furnished them with the implements of husbandry &amp; houshold use; we have placed among them instructors in the arts of first necessity; and they are covered with the Aegis of the law against aggressors from among ourselves.  
But the endeavors to enlighten them on the fate which awaits their present course of life, to induce them to exercise their reason, follow it’s dictates, &amp; change their pursuits with the change of circumstances, have powerful obstacles to encounter. they are combated by the habits of their bodies, prejudices of their minds, ignorance, pride, &amp; the influence of interested &amp; crafty individuals among them, who feel themselves something in the present order of things, and fear to become nothing in any other. these persons inculcate a sanctimonious reverence for the customs of their ancestors; that whatsoever they did must be done through all time; that reason is a false guide, and to advance under it’s counsel in their physical, moral or political condition is perilous innovation: that their duty is to remain as their creator made them, ignorance being safety, and knolege full of danger. in short, my friends, among them also is seen the action and counteraction of good sense and of bigotry. they too have their Anti-Philosophists, who find an interest in keeping things in their present state; who dread reformation, and exert all their faculties to maintain the ascendancy of habit over the duty of improving our reason, &amp; obeying it’s mandates.  
In giving these outlines, I do not mean, fellow citizens, to arrogate to myself the merit of the measures. that is due in the first place to the reflecting character of our citizens at large, who, by the weight of public opinion, influence and strengthen the public measures. it is due to the sound discretion with which they select from among themselves those to whom they confide the legislative duties. it is due to the zeal &amp; wisdom of the characters thus selected, who lay the foundations of public happiness in wholsome laws, the execution of which alone remains for others. and it is due to the able and faithful auxiliaries, whose patriotism has associated them with me in the executive functions.  
During this course of administration, and in order to disturb it, the artillery of the Press has been levelled against us, charged with whatsoever it’s licentiousness could devise or dare. these abuses of an institution, so important to freedom and science, are deeply to be regretted, inasmuch as they tend to lessen it’s usefulness and to sap it’s safety. they might perhaps have been corrected by the wholsome punishments reserved to, and provided by, the laws of the several states against falsehood &amp; defamation. but public duties more urgent press on the time of public servants and the offenders have therefore been left to find their punishment in the public indignation.  
Nor was it uninteresting to the world, that an experiment should be fairly and fully made, Whether freedom of discussion, unaided by power, is not sufficient for the propagation and protection of truth? Whether a government, conducting itself in the true spirit of it’s constitution with zeal and purity, and doing no act which it would be unwilling the whole world should witness, can be written down by falsehood &amp; defamation? the experiment has been tried. you have witnessed the scene. our fellow citizens looked on cool, &amp; collected. they saw the latent source from which these outrages proceeded. they gathered around their public functionaries. and when the constitution called them to the decision by suffrage, they pronounced their verdict, honorable to those who had served them, and consolatory to the friend of man, who believes that he may be trusted with the controul of his own affairs.  
No inference is here intended that the laws provided by the states against false &amp; defamatory publications, should not be enforced. he who has time renders a service to public morals, &amp; public tranquility, in reforming these abuses by the salutary coercions of the law. but the experiment is noted to prove that, since truth &amp; reason have maintained their ground against false opinions, in league with false facts, the Press, confined to truth, needs no other legal restraint. the public judgment will correct false reasonings &amp; opinions, on a full hearing of all parties; and no other definite line can be drawn between the inestimable liberty of the press, and it’s demoralising licentiousness. if there be still improprieties which this rule would not restrain, it’s Supplement must be sought in the Censorship of Public opinion.  
Contemplating the union of sentiment now manifested so generally, as auguring harmony &amp; happiness to our future course, I offer to our country sincere congratulations. with those too, not yet rallied to the same point, the disposition to do so is gaining strength. facts are piercing through the veil drawn over them: &amp; our doubting brethren will at length see that the mass of their fellow citizens, with whom they cannot yet resolve to act, as to principles &amp; measures, think as they think, &amp; desire what they desire. that our wish, as well as their’s, is, that the public efforts may be directed honestly to the public good: that peace be cultivated, civil &amp; religious liberty unassailed, law &amp; order preserved, equality of rights maintained, &amp; that state of property, equal or unequal, which results to every man from his own industry, or that of his fathers. when satisfied of these views, it is not in human nature that they should not approve &amp; support them. in the mean time, let us cherish them with patient affection: let us do them justice and more than justice in all competitions of interest; &amp; we need not doubt that truth, reason, &amp; their own interests will at length prevail, will gather them into the fold of their country, &amp; will compleat that entire union of opinion which gives to a nation the blessing of harmony &amp; the benefit of all it’s strength.  
I shall now enter on the duties to which my fellow-citizens have again called me, &amp; shall proceed in the spirit of those principles which they have approved. I fear not that any motives of interest may lead me astray. I am sensible of no passion which could seduce me knowingly from the path of justice. but the weaknesses of human nature, &amp; the limits of my own understanding will produce errors of judgment sometimes injurious to your interests. I shall need therefore all the indulgence which I have heretofore experienced from my constituents. the want of it will certainly not lessen with increasing years. I shall need too the favour of that being in whose hands we are: who led our fathers, as Israel of old, from their native land; and planted them in a country flowing with all the necessaries &amp; comforts of life; who has covered our infancy with his providence, &amp; our riper years with his wisdom &amp; power: &amp; to whose goodness I ask you to join in supplications with me, that he will so enlighten the minds of your servants, guide their councils, &amp; prosper their measures, that whatsoever they do shall result in your good, &amp; shall secure to you the peace, friendship, &amp; approbation of all nations.

proved by some, from a candid apprehension that  
the enlargement of onr territory may endanger its  
union. But who can limit the extent to which the  
federative principle may operate effectively? The  
larger our association, the less will it be shaken by  
local passions. And in any view, is it not better  
that the opposite bank of the Mississippi should  
be settled by our own brethren and children, than  
by strangers of another family ? With which shall  
we be most likely to live in harmony and friendly

In matters of religion, I have considered that its j  
free exercise is placed by the constitution, inde-;  
pendent of the powers of the general government, j  
I have therefore undertaken, on no occasion, to  
prescribe the religious exercises suited to it: but  
have left them, as the constitution found them,  
under the direction and discipline of theN state or  
church authorities acknowledged by the several re­  
ligious societies.  
The aboriginal inhabitants of these countries, I  
have regarded with the commiseration their his­  
tory inspires. Endowed with the faculties and the  
rights of men, breathing an ardent love of liberty  
and independence, and occupying a country which  
left them no desire but to be undisturbed, the!  
stream of overflowing populatu n from otherregions  
directed itself on these shores. Without power to  
divert, or habits to contend against it, they have  
been overwhelmed by ihe current, or driven before  
it. Now reduced within limits too narrow for the  
hunter state, humanity enjoins us to teach them  
agriculture and the domestic arts ; to encourage  
them to that industry which alone can enable them  
to maintain their place in existence, and to prepare  
n in time for that state of society, whi-jh, to  
bodily comforts, adds the improvement of the mind  
and morals. We have therefore liberally /&quot;rnisht-*  
them with the implements of husbandry and house­  
hold use : we have placed among them instructor&#x27;s  
in the arts of first necessity ; aud &#x27;hey are covered  
with the t-cgis of the law against aggressors from  
among ourselves.  
But the endeavors to enlighten them on (he fate  
which awaits their present course of life, to induce  
themto exercise their reason, follow its dictates,-ant.  
change their pursuits with the change of circum  
stances, have powerful obstacles to encounter.  
They are combated by the habits of their bodies,  
prejudices of their minds, ignorance, pride, and tht  
influence of interested and crafty individuals among  
&lt;-hem, who feel themselves something in the pre  
sent order of things, and fear to become nothing in  
any other. These persons, inculcate a saii&amp;imo  
iv.us reverence for the customs of their ancestors ,  
that whatsoever they did must be done through all  
time ; that reason is a false guide, and to advance  
under its counsel in their physical, moral, or poli­  
tical condition, is perilous innovation : that,then  
duty is to remain as their Creator made them,  
ignorance being safety, and knowlege full of dan­  
ger. In short, my friends, among them also is seen  
the action and counter-action of good sense and of  
bigotry. They too have uieir anti-philosophists, |  
who find an interest in keeping things in their pre-1  
sent state ; who dread reformation, and exert all  
their faculties to maintain the ascendancy of habit  
over the duty of improving our reason and obeying1  
its mandates.  
In giving these outlines, T do not mean, fellow-1  
citizens, to arrogate to myself the merit of the mea­  
sures. That is due, in the first place, to the reflecting  
character of our citizens at large, who, by the  
weight of public opinion, influence and strengthen  
the public measures. It is due to the sound clis  
crctionwith which they select frrm among them­  
selves those to whom they confide the legislative  
duties. It is due to the z&lt;, 1 and wisdom of the  
characters thus selected, who lay the foundations  
of public happiness in wholsome laws, the execu­  
tion of which alone remains for others : and it is  
due to the able and faithful auxiliaries, whose pa­  
triotism has associated them with me in the execu­  
tive functions.  
During this course of administration, and in or­  
der to disturb it, the artillery of the press has been  
levelled against us, charged with whatsoever its li­  
centiousness could devise or dare. These abuses  
of an institution so important to freedom and sci­  
ence, are deeply to be regretted, inasmuch as they  
tend to lessen its usefulness, and to sap its safety.  
They might perhaps have been corrected by the  
wholsome punishments reserved to, and provided  
by, the laws of the several states against falsehood I  
and defamation. But public duties more urgent  
  
press on the time of public servants, and the  
ers have therefore been left to find their&#x27;punish;  
in the public indignation.  
Nor was it uninteresting to tne world that an i  
periment should be fairly and fully made, whether  
freedompi&quot;discussion,unaided by power, is no4, j  
at for the propagation and protection of tn  
thcr a government, conducting itself in  
true spirit of its constitution, with zeal and pu.\
and doing- no act which it would be unwilling  
I whole -York! should witness, can be written d&lt;  
by falsehood and defamation.—The experin.  
has been tried.—You have witnessed the scene.   
Our fellow citizens have !&lt;•■ i cool and col­  
lected. They saw the latent source from wi  
the-se outrages proceeded. They gathered around  
their public functionaries 1 and when the constiru*-  
J&#x27;on called them to th- decision by stiff rare, tl  
renounced their verdict, honorable to those, who  
ad served them, and con.--oh.tory to the friend of  
j man, who believes he may«be entrusted with the  
control of his own affairs,  
j No inference is hen intended that the laws pro*  
videdbythe states against false and defamatory  
publications, should not be enforced. ;o has  
time, renders a service to public morals and public  
tranquility, in reforming these abuses by the salu­  
tary coercions of the law. But the experiment is  
noted to prove that, since truth and reason  
have maintained their ground against false opinions l  
in league witli false fatts, the press, confined to truth,  
needs no other legal restraint. The public judg*  
meat will correel false reasonings and opinions,  
on a full hearing of all parties, and no other defi­  
nite &#x27;me can be drawn between the inestimable li­  
of the* press, and its demoralising licenti­  
ousness. Inhere be still improprieties which this  
rule would not restrain, its supplement must be­  
sought in the censorship of public opinion.  
Contemplating the union of sentiment now ma*,  
niies cd so generally, as auguring harmouv and  
happiness to our future course. I offer to ourdnn  
try sincere congratulations. With those too not  
yet rallied tothe same point, the disposition to do  
so is gaining strength. Facfs are piercing through  
the veil drawn over them, and our doubting I  
thren will at length see that, the mass of tin V M­  
lovv citizens, with whom they cannot yet resolve to  
acl, as to principles and measures, think as th y  
think, and desire what they desire. That our  
wish, as well as theirs, is that the public efforts may  
be direded honestly to the public good, that peace  
be cultivated, civil and religious liberty unassailo !,  
law and order preserved, equality of rights main­  
tained, and that state ofpropcrtv equal or unequal  
which results to every man from his own indus­  
try or that of his fathers. When satisfied of these  
views, it is not in human nature that they should  
not approve and support them. In the mean l  
let us cherish them with patient affctSlkm. Let us,  
do them justice, and more than justice, in all . ,  
petitions of interest: and we need not doubt 1  
truth, reason, and their own interests will at Jen h  
prevail, will gather them into the fold of their  
country, and will compleat that entire union of  
opinion, which gives to a nation ihe blessings oj  
harmony, and the benefit of all its stn hgth.  
I shall now enter on the duties to my fel­  
low citizens have again called me : an pro,  
ceed in the spirit of those principles which  
have approved. I fear not that any motive- of ■„&#x27;.  
terest may lead me astray : I am sensible 01  
sion which could reduce me knowingly from the  
path of justice ; but the weaknesses of human na­  
ture, and the limits of my own understanding will  
produce errors of judgment sometimes injurious to  
your interests. 1 shall need therefore all tht in- &#x27;  
diligence I have heretofore experience&#x27;!; the want  
of it will certainly not lessen with increasing years.  
I .shrill need too the favor of that being in whose  
swe are, who led our fathers, a I rse, of old  
from their native land, and planted tl • a coun- &#x27;  
try flowing with all the necessaries an rnforts of  
*: who has covered our infancy with is provi­  
cc and our ripe years with his wisdom and  
power : and to whose goodness I ask you to  
with me ,n supplications, that he will so enlk  
the minds of your servants, guide their councils,  
and prosper their measures, that, whatsoever they  
do, shall result in your good, ului shall secure to  
you the peace, friendship, and ►approbation of all  
nations

This day, at 12 o’clock, THOMAS JEF­  
FERSON, Pkfsidf. nt of the United States,  
took the oath of office, and delivered the fal­  
lowing INAUGURAL SPEECH, in the Senate  
Chamber, in the prefence of the members of  
the two Houfcs, and a large concourfe of citi-1  
zens.  
S P E ECU.  
PROCEEDING, fellow citizens, to that  
qualification which the conRitulion requires,  
before my entrance on the charge again confer­  
red on me, it is try duty to exprefs the deep,  
fenfc I entertain of this new proof of confidence  
from my fellow citizens at large, and the zeal  
with which it infpires me fo to conduct mylelf  
as may beR fatisfy their juR expectations.  
On taking this Ration on a former occafion,  
1 declared the principles on which I believed it  
my duty to adminiRer the affairs of our com­  
monwealth. My confluence tells me that I  
have on every occafion a&lt;5tcd up to that decla­  
ration according to its obvious import, and to  
the underRanding of every candid mind.  
In the tranfiClion of your foreign affairs, we  
have endeavoured to cultivate the fricndlhip of  
all nations, and efpecially of thofe with which  
we have the moft important relations. We  
have done themjufiiceon all occafions, favour  
where favour was lawful, and cherifhed mutu­  
al interims and intercourfe on fair and equal  
firms: we are firmly convinced, and we adl  
on that eonviCIion, that with nations, as with  
individuals, our intcri Rs, fomully calculated,  
will ever be found infepar/ihle from our moral  
duties. And hiRory bear; witnefs to the fad,  
that a iuR nation is truRi d on its word, when  
rernnrfc is had to armatiu nts and w ars to bri­  
dle others.  
At home, fellow-citizens, you beR know  
whether wc hive done well or ill. The fup­  
preffion of unnecefTary offices, of nfeief*. eRab­  
liL.ments and expenees, enabled us to difeon­  
tirme our internal taxes. Thefe, covering our  
land with officers, and opening our doors to  
their intrufions, had already begun that pro­  
ceL of domiciliary vexation, which once enter­  
ed, is fcarcely to be- rrti lined from reaching  
fin to (lively every article o? produce and of pro­  
perty, If, among thefe taxes, fume minor ones  
fell, which bad not been inconvenient, it was  
Ik or.tifc their amount would not have paid the  
officers who collected them, and becatifr, if  
they had anymeiit, the Rate authorities might  
adopt them, itiRcad of others lefs approved.  
The remaining revenue on the confomption of  
foreign articles, is paid c.hi&lt; fly by thofe who  
can afford to add foreign luxuries to domeAir  
comforts. Being collected on our fra lx&gt;,ard and  
frontiers only, and incorporated with th ♦nnf­  
altions of our mercantile citizens, it mzy Ik- the  
pkafure and the pride of an American to alk,  
whit farmer, what mcc&#x27;.inic, what labourer,  
ever fees a tax-gatherer of the United Slates?  
Thefe contributions enah&#x27;e i»«* to fnppurt the  
current expenfes of the government, to fulfill  
contracts with foreign nations, toextingnifh the  
native right of foil within our limits, fo extend  
us to our  
  
public debts, as places at a fhort day their final  
redemption, arid that redemption once efieCt­  
ed, the revenue thereby liberated, mav, by a  
jutt repartition among the ftates, and a corref­  
|ponding amendment of the conftitution, be ap­  
plied, /// tine cf prate, to rivers, canals, roads,  
ails, manufactures, education and other great  
[objects within each ftatc. In time of war, if  
inj u ft ice by ourfelves or others mult fometiines  
produce war, increafed, as the fame revenue  
[will he by increafed population and confumpti­  
op, and aided by other rtfotirces, referved for  
that crifis, it may meet within the year ail the  
expenfes of the year, without encroaching on  
the rights ot future generations, by burthening  
them with the debts of ilie palt. War will  
then be but a fufpenfion of ufefnl works, and a  
return toaftate of peace, a return to the pro­  
gref? of improvement.  
I have faid, fellow-citizens, that the income  
referved, had enabled us to extend our limits ;  
but that extenfion may pofiibly pay fur itfLIf  
iK-fore we arc called on, and tn the mean time  
may keep down the accruing intereft. in all e­  
verts it will replace the advances we fhall have  
made. I know that the acquifitioh of Lnuifia­  
na has hern difapproved by fome, from a can­  
did apprehenfton that the enlargement of our  
territory m.iy endanger its union ; but who can  
lim the extent to which the fcdeiative princi­  
ple may operate ifti-tfivdy ? The larger our  
aftociafion, the let&#x27;s will it be ibnken by local  
paffionp. and in any view, is itn.-t better that  
the oppofite bank of the Mifliflinpi ftiould be  
fettled by our own brethren and children, than  
by ftrangers of am.(her family ? &#x27;Vifh which  
fliall we be moft likely to live in harmony and  
friendly intercourse ?  
In matters ol religion I have confid* red that  
its free cxcrcif; is placed by the conftitution  
independent ot the powers of the general go­  
vernment. i have therefore undertaken, on no  
occafion,toprefcribetheitligioii8cxercif&lt; slnite.l  
to it; but have left them, as the conftitution  
found them, under the direction and difcipliue  
of tin ftatc or church authorities a&lt; knowledg­  
ed by tin f. veral religious focieties.  
The aboriginal inhabitants of theft countries,  
I have regarded with the rommiftration their  
hiftory infpirc*. Etulowr-d with the faculties  
and the rights of men, breathing an ardent love  
t»t liberty and independence, and occiipyirr a  
country which left them no ddire hut to be  
unriifturbed, the ftrcain of overflowing popu­  
lation from oth&#x27;-r region# directed itfelfon tlitfe  
Ihorcs. Without power to divert, or habits to  
contend agai ft it, they have bicn overwhelm­  
ed by the current, or driven before it. Now  
reduced within limits ton narrow for the hun­  
ter ftatc, humanity enjoins us to teach them a­  
griutlturc and trie doineftic arts ; to encourage  
them to that induftry which a&#x27;one can enatde  
them to maintain their place in • xiftem -, and  
t&gt;&gt; prepare them in time for tnat ftafe of fociety,  
which, to bodily comforts, adds the improve*  
mi nt of the mind and morals. We have there­

Pmcceding,ffcilow citizens, to that  
‘qualification which the constitution  
requires, béfore my entrance on the

my daty to eéxprefs the deep sense I  
entertain of this new proof of confi­  
dence from my fellow citizens at

fpirtes me, so to eondu&amp; myfelf as  
may beflt {atisfy their jult expe&amp;ations.  
On taking this station on a former  
eccafion, I declared the principles on  
which I believed it my duty to ad­  
minilter the affairs of our common­  
wealth. My conscience tells me that  
I have, on every occalionyaé&amp;ed up to  
that declaration, according to its ob­  
vious import,.and to the underßtand- .  
ing of every candid mind. .  
In the tranfa&amp;ion of your foreign .  
affairs, we have endeavored to culti­  
vate the friendfhip of all nations,  
and especially of those with which we  
have the most important relations.  
We have done them jufticz on all oc­

‘tory bears witness tothe fa&amp;, that a  
_juft pation istrudted onits word,when  
recourse-is had to armaments -aad  
‘Wars to bridle others. S 4  
At home,fellow citizens, you best  
know whether we have done well er  
ill. The -fuppreflion of ‘unnecef­  
fary offices ; of ufelefs&#x27;eftablithments .  
and expences, enabled us to discon­  
tinue our internal taxes. These cov­  
ering our land with &#x27;oﬂiceu,and open­  
ing our doors to their intrusions, had  
already begun that process es dom-&#x27;  
jcilidry vexation, which, once entered, -  
is fearcely to be reftrainedifrom reach- .  
ing fucceflively every grtide; of pro­  
duce and property. llf araong. these  
‘taxes {ome minor ones fell which hag  
not been ingonveniedt, it was because  
their amount would not have, :paid  
the officers who colle@ted them, and  
because if they had any merit, tl‘}‘{q  
state authorities might adopt them, in.  
fiead of others léfs approved. oo  
. The remaining revenue on ﬁ&#x27;fe&#x27;tog,&#x27;  
fumption of foreign articles, is paid  
‘cheerfully by those who can affordte  
add fereign luxuries to domestic ¢om­  
forts, béing eolle@ted on our seaboard

redemption once effeéted, the revenue  
thereby liberated, may by . ajuft re­

the income reserved had enabled us  
to extend our limits ; but that exten­  
sion may poflibly pay foritfelf before  
we are called on, and in the mean  
time may keep down the acerming  
interest : i all events it will replace  
the advances we have made : I know  
that the acquifition’ of Lonifiana bas  
been disapproved by some. gvm a can.  
did apprehension that the emargement  
of our territory may endanger its un­

which the federative principle may op--

not better that the opposite bank of  
the Miflithppi should be fetrled by  
our own brethren and children, than  
by frangers of another family ? with  
which {hall we be most llleg to live

I&#x27;n matters of religion, T have con­  
sidered that its free exercife&#x27;is placed  
by the constitution independént of the  
powers of the general govérnment.  
I have therefore, undertaken, on no  
occasion, to -preferibe the religious  
exercises faited to it bat have left  
thern as the conltitution found them,  
under the dirc&amp;ion and discipline of  
the state or church authorities ac­  
knowledged by the several religious  
focicties, : ; |  
The aberiginal inhabitants of these  
countries, I have regarded with the  
commifleration their hiltory inspires  
endowed with the facultjes and the  
rights of men, b¥eathing an ardent  
love ot liberty and independence, and  
yccupying a countiy which left them

ROCEEDING, fellow- citizens,  
to thar qualification which the conflitution |  
requires before my entrance on the charge |  
exprefs the deep fenfe,I entertain of this |  
new proof of confidence trom my fellow-  
  
citizens at large, and the zeal with which  
  
it infpires me fo to condutt myfelf as may  
  
beft fatisty their jul expectations.  
  
On taking this flation on a former oc-  
  
cafion, 1 declared the principles on which  
  
I believed it my duty to adminifter the af-  
  
fairs of our commonwealih. .My con-  
  
[cience tells me, that I have, on every  
  
occafion, a€ted up to that declaration, ac-  
  
cording to its obvious. import, and to the  
underftanding of every candid mind.  
  
In the tranfaétion of your foreign af.  
  
fairs, we have endeavored to cultivate the  
friendfhip of all nations, and efpecialiy o!  
  
thofe with which we have the moftim-  
  
portant relations. We have done them  
  
again conferred on me, it is my duty to |  
  
  
  
yaltice on all occafions, favored where  
tavor was lawful, and cherifhed mutual!  
interefts and intercourfe on fair and eq.al  
terms. Weare firmly convinced, and  
we a@ on that ¢onviftion, that with na-  
tians, as with individual, our interciils,  
foundly calculated, will ever be found  
inf le from our moral duties: And  
hiftory bears witnefs to the fa&amp;, that a joa  
nation is trufled on its. word, when re:  
  
  
  
coufé.is had to armaments and wars to  
bridle others.  
  
At home, fellow-citizens,you beft know  
her we have done well or i!!. The  
  
fiton ot unnecefTiry offices, of ufe-  
lifhments and expences, ena-  
to difcontinue our internal taxes.  
covering ovr land with officers,  
and opening our doors to their intrufion,  
andaleeady begun that procefs of domi-  
ciliafy vexation, which, once entered, is  
fcarcely to be reftrained trom reaching  
fucceffively every article of produce and  
of property.” I}, among thefe taxes, fome  
minor ones fell, which had not been in-  
convenient it was becaule their amount  
would not have paid the officers who col-  
leéted them, and becaufe, if they had any  
merit, the State authorities might adupi  
them, inftead of others lefs approved.  
  
The remaining revenue on the con-  
fumption of foreign articles, is paid chiefly  
by thofe who can afford to add foreign  
luxuries to domeftic comforts. Being  
colleéled on our fea-board and frontiers  
only, and incorporated with the tranf-  
aftions of our mercantile citizens, it may  
be the pleafure and the pride of an Amer-  
ican to afk what farmer, what mechanic,  
what laborer ever fees a tax gatherer in  
the United States? Thefe contributions  
enab&#x27;e us to fupport the current expen-  
ces of the government, to fulfil contraéts  
with foreign nations, to extinguifh the  
native right of foil within our limits, to  
extendthole limits, and to apply fucha  
furplus to our public debts, as places at  
a fhort day their final redemption, and  
that redemption once eflefed, the revenue  
thereby liberated, may be a juft reparti-  
tion among the Siates, and a correfpand-  
ent amendment of the conflitution be ap-  
plied, 1m time of peace, to rivers, canals,  
roads, arts, manufa€tures, education, and  
other great objcfts within each State: Jn  
time of war, it injuftice by ourfelves or  
others muft fometimes produce war, in-  
creafed as the fame revenue will be by in-  
creafed population and confumption, and  
aided by other refources referved for that  
-crifis, it may meet within the year all the  
expences ot the year, without encroaching  
onthe rights of future generations, by  
burthening them with the debts of the  
paft. War will then be but a fufpenfion  
of ufeful works, and a return to the pro-  
grefs of improvement.  
  
I have faid, fellow-citizens, that the  
income referved had enabled us to extend  
our limits ; but that extenfion may poffi-  
bly pay for itfelf before we are called  
on, andin the mean time may keep down  
the accruing intereft. In all events it  
will replace the advances we fhall have  
made. I know that the acquifition of  
  
Louifiana has been difapproved by fome

largement of our territory may endanget  
its union. But who can limit the extent  
to which the federative principle may op-  
erate efleGlively ? The larger ovr afloci-  
ation the lefs will it be fhaken by local  
paffions. Andinany view, is it not bei-  
terthat the oppofite bank ot the Mrffifip-  
pi fhould be iettled by our own brethren  
and children, than by ftrangers of anotier  
family? With which fhall we be inoft  
likely te live in harmony 2ad tmendly ia-  
tercourfe ?  
  
In matters of religion I have confidered  
that its free exercife is placed by the con-  
flitution, independent of the powers of the  
general government. I lave therefore  
undertaken, on no occafion, to preferibe  
the religious exercife fuited toit: but  
have left them, as the conftitution fund  
them, under the dire€tion and difcipline of  
the State or church authorities, acknowl-  
edged by the feveral religious focieties.  
  
The aboriginal inhabitants of thefe  
countries, 1 have regarded with the com.  
miferation their hiftory infpires. Endow-  
ed with the faculties and the rights of  
men, breathing an ardent love of liberty  
and independence, and occupying a coun-  
try which left them no defire but to be  
undifturbed, the ftream of overflowing  
population from other regions dire€ted  
itfelf on thefe fhores. Without power to  
divert, or habits to contend againft it, they  
have been overwhelmed by the current, cr  
driven before it. Now reduced within h-  
mits too narrow tor the hunter flate,human-  
ity enjoins us to teachthem agriculture and  
the domeftic arts; fo encourage them to  
that induftry which alone can enable them  
to maintain the:r place in exiltence, and to  
prepare them in time for that ftate of fo-  
ciety, which, to bodily comforts, adds the  
improvement of the mind and morals.  
We have, therefore, liberally fturnifbed  
  
‘them with the tmplements of huibandry  
  
and houfeho!d ule: we have placed among  
thern inflruéiors in the arts of firft necefii-  
ty; and they are covered with the wzis of  
the law againft aggreflors trom among  
ourfelves.  
  
But the endeavors to enlighten them on  
the fate which awaits their prefent courfe  
of lite, to induce them to exercie their  
reafon, follow its di€tates, and change their  
purfuits with the change of circumfan-  
ees, have powerful obftacles to encoun-  
ter. They are combatied by thd habits of  
their bodies, prejudices of their minds, ig-  
norance, pride, and the influence of inter-  
efled and crafty individuals emong them,  
who feel themfelves fomething in the pre-  
fent order of things, and tear to become  
nothing in any other. Thefe perfons in-  
culcate a fan€timonious reverence for the  
cuftoms of their anceftors ; that whatfoev-  
erthey did mufi be done through a!! time ;

over the duty of improving our seafoa and |  
obeying its mandaies,  
  
In giving thefe outlines, I do not mean, |  
fellow-citizens, to arrogate to myielt the  
merits of the meafures. That is due, in  
the firft place, to the refle€ting character  
of our citizens at large, who, by the  
weight of public opinion, influence and  
ftrengthen the public meafures. It is doe  
tothe found diferetion with which they  
fele€t from among themle!lves thofe. to  
whom they confide the legiflative duties.  
It is due to the zeal and wifdom of the  
chara€éters thus fele€ted, who lay the touns  
dations of public happinefs in wholefome  
laws, the execution of which alone re-  
mains for others:~ and it is due to the  
able and faithful auxilaries, whofe patriot-  
ifm has aflociated them with me in the  
executive funélions.  
  
During this courfe of adminiftration,  
and in order to differb it, the artillery of  
the prefs has been levelled againft us,  
charged with whatfvever its licencioufnels  
could devife or dare. Thefe abufes of an  
inftitution fo important to freedom and  
fcience, are deeply to be regretted, inal.  
muc!: as they tend to lefflen its ufelulceis,  
andto fap its fafety. They might, per-  
haps, have been correéted by the whole-  
fome punithments referved to, and provi-  
ded by the laws of the feveral States &lt;gainfi  
falfhood and defamation. But public da.  
‘ies, more urgent, prefs on the time of  
public fervants, and the offenders have  
therefore been left to find their pumvhmen:  
jn the public indignation.  
  
Nor was it uninterefting to the world  
that an experiment fhould be fairly and

No inference is here intended that the  
laws provided by the States egainft falle  
and defamatory publications fhould not be  
entorced. He who has time, 4 a  
lervice to public morals and publietan-  
quility, in reforming thefe abufes by the  
faluiary coercions of the law.  Biitthe  
experiment is noted to prove, that, fince  
truth and reafon have maintained their  
ground againit falfe opinions in league  
with falfe fas, the prefs confined to  
truth, needs n6 other legal reflraint. © The  
public judgment will correét talfe reafon-  
ings and opinions, on a fall hearing of all  
parties, andno other definite line can be  
drawn between the ineftimable liberty of  
the prefs, and its demoralifing licentiouf-  
nefs. If there be fill improprieties,  
which this rule would not reftrain, its fup.  
plement muft be fought in the cenforfhip  
ot public opinion.  
  
Contemplating the union of fentiment  
now manilefted fo generally, as auguring  
harmony and happinefs to our future  
courfe, I offer to our country fincere con-  
gratulations.—With thofe too, not yet  
rallied to the fame poin:, the difpofition to  
do fo is gaining ftrength, ta&amp;ts are piercin®  
through the veil drawn over them ; and  
our doubting brethren will at iength fee  
that the mafs of their fellow citizens, with  
whom they cannot yet refolve to a, as to  
principles and meafures, think as they think,  
an} defire what they defire ; that our with  
as well as theirs, is that the public efforts  
may be direfied honeftly tothe public good,  
that peace be cultivated, civil and religious  
liberty unaffailed, law and order preferved,  
equality of rights maintained, and that  
{tate of property equal or unequal, which  
refults to every man from his own induf-  
try or that of his fathers. When fatisfied  
of thele views, it is not in human nature  
that they fhould not approve and fupport  
them ; inthe mean time let us cherifh them  
with patient affeétion: let us dothem juf-  
tice, and more than joftice, in all competi.  
tiens of intereft: and we need not doubt  
that trath, reafon and their own interedts  
will at length prevai!, will gather them in-  
to the fold of their country, and will com-  
plete that entire union of opinion, which  
gives to a nation the bleflings of harmony

” curing tms course ot administration, and  
in order to disturb it, the artillery of the press  
has been levelled against us, charged with  
whatsoever its licentiousness could devise or  
dare. These abuses of an institution so im­  
portant to freedom and science are deeply to  
be regretted, inasmuch as they tend to lessen  
its usefulness, and to sap its safety. They  
might perhaps have been corrected by the  
wholesome punishments reserved to, and pro­  
vided by, the laws of the several states against  
falsehood and defamation. But publick duties  
more urgent press on the time of publick ser­  
vants, and the offenders have therefore been  
left to find their punishment in the publick in­  
dignation.  
“ No inference is here intended that the  
laws provided by the states against false and  
defamatory publications, should not be en­  
forced. He who has time, renders a service  
to publick morals and publick tranquillity in  
xelorming these abuses by the salutary coerti­  
ons of the law. But the experiment is noted  
to prove that, since truth and reason have  
maintained their ground against false opinions  
in league with fake facts,the press, confined to  
truth, needs no other legal restraint. The  
publick judgment will correct false reasonings  
and opinions, on a full hearing of all parties,  
and no other definite line can be drawn be­  
tween the inestimable liberty of the press,  
and demoralising licentiousness. If there be  
still improprieties which this rule would not  
restrain, its supplement must be sought in the  
censorship of publick opinion.

hasten to retrace our steps, and to re­  
gain the road which alone leads to  
peace, liberty, and safety.&quot;  
SECOND INAICCKAL., MARCH 4TII, 180&quot;).  
&quot;At home, fellow-citizens, you best  
know whether we have done well or  
ill. The suppression of unnecessary  
offices, of useless establishments and  
expenses, enable us to discontinue our  
internal taxes. These, covering our  
land with officers, and opening our  
doors to their intrusions, bad already  
begun that process of domiciliary vex­  
ation which once entered is scarcely  
to be restrained from reaching success­  
ively every article of property and  
produce. If, among these taxes, some  
minor ones fell which bad not been  
inconvenient, it was because their  
amount would not have paid the offi­  
cers who collected them, and because,  
if they had any merit, the State au­  
thorities might adopt them instead of  
others less approved.  
&quot;The remaining revenue, on the  
consumption of foreign articles, is  
paid chiefly by those who can afford  
to add foreign luxuries to domestic  
comforts. Being collected on our sea­  
board and frontiers only, and incorpo­  
rated with the transactions of our  
mercantile citizens, it may be the  
pleasure nnd the pride of an American  
to ask what farmer, what mechanic,  
what laborer ever sees u tax-gatherer  
of the United States? The contribu­  
tions cnuhlc us to support the current  
expenses of the government; to fulfill  
contracts with foreign nations ; to ex­  
tinguish the native right of soil within  
our limits ; to extend those limits and  
to apply such a surplus to our public  
debts as places at a short day their  
final redemption, and, that redemption  
once effected, the revenue thereby lib­  
erated may, by a just repartition of it  
among the States, and a corresponding  
amendment of the Constitution, be  
applied, iu time of peace, to rivers,  
canals, roads, arts, manufactures, edu­  
cation, and other great objects within  
  
each State. In time of war, if injus­  
tice by ourselves or others must some­  
times produce war, increased, as the  
same revenue will bo by increased  
population and consumption, and aid­  
ed by other resources reserved for that  
crisis, it may meet within the year all  
the expenses of the year without en­  
croaching oil the rights of future gen­  
erations by burdening them with the  
debts of the past. War will then be  
hut a suspension of useful works; and  
a return to a state of peace, a return  
to the progress of improvement.  
&quot;I have said, fellow-citizens, that the  
income reserved had enabled us to ex­  
tend our limits; but that extension  
may possibly pay for itself before we  
are called on, and, in the mean time,  
may keep down the accruing interest;  
in all events it will replace the ad­  
vances we shall have made. 1 know­  
that the acquisition of Louisiana has  
been disapproved by some from a can- j  
did apprehension that the enlargement  
of our territory would endanger the  
Union, lint who run limit the extent  
to which the fair rot ice principle may  
opt rate effectively The larger our as­  
sociation, the less will it be shaken by  
local passion-; and, in any view, in it  
not heifer that the opposite bank of the  
.Mississipjii shall be settled by one own  
brethren antl children, than by stranyers  
of another family t With which should  
we be most likely to live in harmony  
and friendly intercourse?  
&quot;In matters of religion, I have con­  
sidered that its free exercise is placed  
by the Constitution independent of  
the powers of the General Govern­  
ment. 1 have, therefore, undertaken  
on no occasion to prescribe the relig- I  
ions exercise suited to it, but luive left  
them, as the Constitution found them,  
under the direction and discipline ot  
the church or State authorities ac- j  
kuowledgcd by the several religious ;  
societies.

no snrpfus that Congress was entitled to  
use in any other way than the payment of  
debt until we no longer had any debt to

 it is lefr  
for the common beverage of Demogracy to  
furnish an issue upon which it shalf break  
and go to pieces.  
A special message from the President  
appears to be necessary to preserve the  
Democratic column solid for free trade in  
rum. And this is another issue upon which  
the Republicans will meet the foe more  
than half way.  
A Distinction and a Difference.  
The difference between the views enter­  
tained by the Sage of Monticello and those  
  
of the Sage of Oak View is just now a sub-  
ject of surpassing interest. In his second  
inaugural, delivered March 4, 1805, Presi­  
dent Thomas Jefferson said:  
At home, fellow citizens, you best know  
whether we have done well or ill. The sup  
pression of unnecessary officers, of useless es­  
tablishments and expenses, enabled us to  
discontinue our internal taxes. These,  
covering our land with officers and open­  
ing our doors to their intrusions, had  
already begun that process of domicil­  
iary vexations which, once entered, is  
scarcely to be restrained from reaching suc­  
cessfully every article of property and produce.  
The remaining revenue on the con­  
sumption of foreign articles is paid chiefly by  
those who can afford to add foreign luxuries  
to domestic comforts. Boing collected on our  
seaboard and frontiers only, and incornorated  
with the transactions of our mercantile citi  
zens, it may be the pleasure and the pride of  
an American to ask what farmer, what me­  
chanic, what laborer ever sees a tax gatherer  
in the United States

said: &quot;The revenue on the consumption of for­  
eign articles is paid chiefly by those who can  
afford to add foreign luxuries to domestie com­  
forts, being collected on our seaboard and  
frontiers only, and incorporated with the trans­  
actions of our mercantile citizens. It may be the  
pleasure and the pride of an American to ask,  
What farmer, what mechanic, what laborer  
ever sees a tax gatherer of the United States?  
These contributions enable us to support the  
current expenses of the Government, to fulfil  
contracts with foreign nations, to extinguish  
the native right of soil within our limits, to ex­  
tend those limits (as by the purchase of the vast  
Louisiana territory), and to apply such a surplus  
to our public debts as places at a short  
day their final redemption, and, that redemp­  
tion once effected, the revenue thereby lih­  
erated may, by a just repartition of it among  
the States and a corresponding amendment of  
the Constitution, be applied in time of pece to  
rivers, canals, roads, arts, manufactures, edu­  
cation, and other great objects within each  
State. In time of war, if injustice by ourselves  
or others must sometimes produce war, in­  
creased as the same revenue will be by increased  
population and consumption, and aided by other  
resources reserved for that crisis, it may mest  
within the year all the expenses of the year  
  
without encroaching on the rights of future  
generations by burthening them with the debts  
of the past. War will then be but a suspension  
of useful works, and a return to a state of peace.  
a return to the progress of improvement.  
&quot;I have said, fellow citizens, that the income  
reserved had enabled us to extend our limits,  
but that extension may possibly pay for itself  
before we are called on, and, in the mean time,  
may keep down all the acoruing interest; in all  
events, it will replace the advances we shall  
have made. I know that the acquisition of  
Louisiana has been disapproved by some from a  
candid apprehension that the enlargement of  
our torritory would endanger its union. But  
who can limit the extent to which the federative  
principle may operate effectively? The larger  
our association, the less will it be shaken by  
local passions; and in any view is it not better  
that the opposite bank of the Mississippi should  
be settled by our own brethren and children  
than by strangers of another family? With  
which should we be most likely to live in har­  
mony and friendly intercourse?&quot;

ferring to the absolute freedom of the press, of  
which he had been a consistent advocate, set  
forth an admirable commentary on the familia

ing the course of administration, and in order  
to disturb it, the artillery of the press has been  
levelled against us, charged with whatsoever its  
licentiousness could devise or dare. These  
abuses of an institution so important to freedom  
and science are deeply to be regretted, inasmuch  
as they tend to lessen its usefulness and to sap  
its safety. They might, indeed, have been cor-  
rected by the wholesome punishments reserved  
to and provided by the laws of the several States  
against falsehood and defamation, but public  
duties more urgent press on public servants, and  
the offenders have, therefore, been left to find  
their punishment in the public indignation.  
&quot;Nor was it uninteresting to the world that  
an experiment should be fairly and fully made,  
whether the freedom of discussion, unaided by  
power, is not sufficient for the propagation and  
protection of truth--whether a Government  
conducting itself in the true spirit of its Con­  
stitution, with zeal and purity, and doing no act  
which it would be unwilling the whole world  
should witness, can be written down by false.­  
hood and defamation. The experiment has  
been tried; you have witnessed the scene;  
our fellow citizens looked on, cool and col­  
lected; they saw the latent source from which  
these outrages proceeded; they gathered around  
their public functionaries; and when the Con­  
atitution called them to the decision by suffrage,  
they pronounced their verdiet, honorable to  
those who had served them and consolatory to  
the friends of man who believe that he may  
be trusted with the control of his own affairs.  
&quot;No inference is here intended that the laws  
provided by the States against false and de­  
famatory publications should not be enforced;  
he who has time renders a service to public  
morals and public tranquillity in reforming these  
abuses by the salutary coercions of the law, but  
the experiment ia notéd to prove that, since  
truth and reason have maintained their ground  
against false opinions in league with false facts,  
the press, confined to truth, needs no other legal  
restraint; the public judgment will correct  
false reasonings and opinions on a full hearing  
of all parties, and no other definite line can be  
drawn between the inestimable liberty of the  
press and its demoralizing licentiousness. If  
there be still improprieties which this rule  
would not restrain, its supplement must be  
sought in the censorship of public opinion.
