I received your Letter dated at Brussels the 16th past.  
My Vanity might possibly be flatter’d by your Expressions of Compliment to my Understanding, if your Proposals did not more clearly manifest a mean Opinion of it.  
You conjure me in the Name of the omniscient and just God, before whom I must appear, and by my Hopes of future Fame, to consider if some Expedient cannot be found to put a Stop to the Desolation of America, and prevent the Miseries of a General War. As I am conscious of having taken every Step in my Power to prevent the Breach, and no one to widen it, I can chearfully appear before that God, fearing nothing from his Justice in this particular, tho’ I have much Occasion for his Mercy in many others. As to my future Fame, I am content to rest it on my past and present Conduct, without seeking an Addition to it in the crooked dark Paths you propose to me, where I should most certainly lose it. This your solemn Address would therefore have been more properly made to your Sovereign and his venal Parliament. He and they who wickedly began and madly continue a War for the Desolation of America, are alone accountable for the Consequences.

.  
Our Expectations of the future Grandeur of America are not so magnificent, and therefore not so vain and visionary as you represent them to be. The Body of our People are not Merchants but humble Husbandmen, who delight in the Cultivation of their Lands, which from their Fertility and the Variety of our Climates, are capable of furnishing all the Necessaries and Conveniencies of Life, without external Commerce: And we have too much Land to have the least Temptation to extend our Territories by Conquest from peaceable Neighbours, as well as too much Justice to think of it. Our Militias, you find by Experience, are sufficient to defend our Lands from Invasion; and the Commerce with us will be defended by all the Nations who find an Advantage in it: We therefore have not the Occasion you imagine of Fleets or Standing Armies, but may well leave those expensive Machines to be maintain’d for the Pomp of Princes and by the Wealth of ancient States. We purpose, if possible, to live in Peace with all Mankind; And after you have been convinc’d, to your Cost, that there is nothing to be got by attacking us, we have reason to hope that no other Power will judge it prudent to quarrel with us, lest they divert us from our own quiet Industry, and turn us into Corsairs preying upon theirs. The Weight therefore of an independent Empire, which you seem so certain of our Inability to bear, will not be so great as you imagine: The Expence of our civil Government we have always borne, and can easily bear, because it is small. A virtuous and laborious People may be cheaply govern’d. Determining as we do, to have no Offices of Profit, nor any Sinecures or useless Appointments, so common in ancient and corrupted States, we can govern ourselves a Year for the Sums you pay in a single Department, or for what one Jobbing Contractor, by the favour of a Minister, can cheat you out of in a single Article.  
You think we flatter ourselves and are deceiv’d into an Opinion that England must acknowledge our Independency. We, on the other hand, think you flatter yourselves in imagining such an Acknowledgement a vast Boon, which we strongly desire, and which you may gain some great Advantage by Granting or Withholding. We have never ask’d it of you. We only tell you, that you can have no Treaty with us but as an independent State: And you may please yourselves and your Children with the Rattle of your Right to govern us, as long as you have done with that of your King’s being King of France, without giving us the least Concern if you do not attempt to exercise it. That this pretended Right is indisputable, as you say, we utterly deny. Your Parliament never had a Right to govern us: And your King has forfeited it by his bloody Tyranny. But I thank you for letting me know a little of your Mind, that even if the Parliament should acknowledge our Independency, the Act would not be binding to Posterity, and that your Nation would resume, and prosecute the Claim as soon as they found it convenient. We suspected before, that from the Influence of your Passions, and your present Malice against us, you would not be actually bound by your conciliatory Acts longer than till they had serv’d their purpose of inducing us to disband our Forces: but we were not certain that you were Knaves by Principle, and that we ought not to have the least Confidence in your Offers, Promises or Treaties, tho’ confirm’d by Parliament. I now indeed recollect my being inform’d long since when in England, that a certain very great Personnage, then young, studied much a certain Book, intituled Arcana imperii. I had the Curiosity to procure the Book and read it. There are sensible and good Things in it; but some bad ones: For, if I remember right, a particular King is applauded for his politically exciting a Rebellion among his Subjects at a time when they had not Strength to support it, that he might in subduing them take away their Privileges which were troublesome to him: and a Question is formally stated and discuss’d, Whether a Prince who, to appease a Revolt, makes Promises of Indemnity to the Revolters, is obliged to fulfil those Promises? Honest and good Men would say, Ay. But this Politician says, as you say, No. And he gives this pretty Reason, that tho’ it was right to make the Promises, because otherwise the Revolt could not be suppress’d; yet it would be wrong to keep them, because Revolters ought to be punish’d to deter future Revolts.

 and Ports. This Proposition of delivering ourselves bound and gagg’d, ready for hanging without even a right to complain, and without a Friend to be found afterwards among all Mankind, you would have us embrace upon the Faith of an Act of Parliament. Good God!—an Act of your Parliament! This demonstrates that you do not yet know us, and that you fancy we do not know you. But it is not merely this flimsy Faith that we are to act upon; you offer us Hope, the Hope of Places, Pensions and Peerages. These (judging from yourselves) you think are Motives irresistable. This Offer, Sir, to corrupt us is with me your Credential; it convinces me that you are not a private Volunteer in this Negociation. It bears the Stamp of British-Court-Character. It is even the Signature of your King. But think for a Moment in what Light it must be view’d in America. By Places you mean Places among us; for you take care by a special Article to secure your own to yourselves. We must then pay the Salaries in order to bribe ourselves with these Places. But you will give us Pensions! probably to be paid too out of your expected American Revenue, and which none of us can accept without deserving and perhaps obtaining a Suspension.—Peerages!—Alas, Sir, our long Observation of the vast and servile Majority of your Peers, voting constantly for every Measure propos’d by a Minister, however weak or wicked, leave us small Respect for that Title. We consider it as a sort of Tar-and-feather Honour, a Mixture of Foulness and Folly, which every Man among us who should accept from you, would be oblig’d to renounce, or exchange for that conferr’d by the Mobs in his own Country, or wear it with everlasting Infamy.

‘* Our expectations of the future grandeur of America are not so magnificent,  
and therefore not so vain and visionary as you represent them to be. The body  
of our people are not merchants, but humble husbandmen, who delight in the  
cultivation of their lands, which, from their fertility and the variety of their cli-  
mates, are capable of furnishing all the necessaries and conveniences of life,  
without external commerce : and we have too much land to have the least temp-  
tation to extend our territory by conquest from peaceable neighbours, as well as  
too much justice to think of it. Our militia, you find by experience, are suffi-  
cient to defend our lands from invasion; and the commerce with us will be de-  
fended by all the nations who find an advantage in it. We, therefore, have not  
the occasion you imagine, of fleets or standing armies, but may leave those ex-  
pensive machines to be maintained for the pomp of princes, and the wealth of  
ancient states. We propose, if possible, to five in peace with all mankind; and  
after you have been convinced to your cost, that there is nothing to be got by  
attacking us, we have reason to hope that no other power will judge it prudent  
to quarrel with us, lest they divert us from our own quiet industry, and turn us  
into corsairs preying upon theirs. The weight, therefore, of an independent  
empire, which you seem certain of our inability to bear, will not be so great as  
you re! the expense of our civil government we have always borne, and

can easily bear, because it is small. A virtuous and laborious people may be  
cheaply governed, determining, as we do, to have no offices of profit, nor any  
sinecures, or useless appointments, so common in ancient or corrupted states.  
We can govern ourselves a year for the sum you pay in a single department, for  
what one jobbing contractor, by the favour of a minister, can cheat you out of  
in a single article.  
  
** You think we flatter ourselves, and are deceived into an opinion that Eng-  
i land must acknowledge our independency. We, on the other hand, think you  
flatter yourselves, in imagining such an acknowledgment a vast boon, which we  
strongly desire, and which you may gain some great advantage by granting or  
withholding. We have never asked you for it; we only tell you you can have  
no treaty with us but as an independent state ; and you may please yourselves  
and your children with the rattle of your right to govern us, as long as you have  
done with that of your king’s being king of France, without giving us the least  
concern, so long as you do not attempt to exercise it. That this pretended right  
is indisputable, as you say, we utterly deny. Your parliament never had a right  
to govern us, and your king has forfeited it, by his bloody tyranny. But I thank  
you for letting me know a little of your mind, that even ifthe parliament should  
acknowledge our independency, the act would not be binding on posterity, and  
that your nation would resume and prosecute the claim, as soon as they found  
it convenient, from the influence of your passions and your present malice  
against us. We suspected before, that you would not be bound by your conci-  
liatory acts, longer than till they had served their purpose, of inducing us to dis-  
band ourforces ; but we were not certain that you were knaves by principle, and  
that we ought not to have the least confidence in your offers, promises, or trea-  
ties, though confirmed by parliament. I now indeed recollect my being in-  
formed, long since, when in England, that a certain very great personage, then  
young, studied much a certain book, entitled Arcana Imperit. I had the curio-  
sity to procure the book and read it. There are sensible and good things in it,  
but some bad ones ; for if I remember rightly, a particular king is applauded

for his politically exciting a rebellion among his subjects, at a time when th  
had not strength to support it, that he might, in subduing them, take away their  
privileges, which were troublesome to him; and a question is formally stated  
and discussed, whether a prince, who, to appease a revolt, mak mises of in-  
demnity to the revolters, is obliged to fulfil those promises! Honest and good  
men would say, aye ; but this politician says, no; and he gives this any rea-  
son, that, eo a it was right to make the promises, because otherwise the re-  
volt would not be suppressed, yet it would be wrong to keep them, because re-  
volters ought to be punished to deter future revolts. RS  
  
« The proposition of delivering ourselves, bound and gagged, ready  
for hanging, without even a right to complain, and without a friend to be found  
afterwards among all mankind, you would have us embrace upon the faith of an  
act of parliament. Good God! An act of your parliament! This demonstrates  
that you do not _ know us, and that you fancy we do not know you ; but it is  
not merely this flimsy faith that we are toact upon. You offer us the hope  
of Praces, Pensions, and Peeraces. These, judging from yourselves, you  
think are motives irresistible. This offer to corrupt us, Sir, is with me your  
credential, and convinces me you are not a private volunteer in your application.  
It bears the stamp of British Court character. It is even the signature of your  
king. But think for 2 moment in what light it must be viewed in America. By  
Paces, you mean places amongst us; for you take care, by a special article, to  
secure your own to yourselves. We must then pay the whiner in order to en-  
rich ourselves with these places. But you will give us Pensions ; probably to  
be paid too out of your expected American revenue, and which none of us can  
accept, without deserving, and perhaps obtaining, a sus-rension. Pxreraczs!  
Alas! Sir, our long observation of the vast servile majority of your peers voting  
constantly for every measure proposed by a minister, however weak or wicked,  
leaves us small respect for that title. We consider it as a sort of tar and feather  
honour, or a mixture of foulness and folly, which every man among us, who  
should accept it from your king, would be obliged to renounce, or exchange for  
that conferred by the mobs of their own country, or wear it with everlasting infa-  
my.” Vol. iv. 47-52.
