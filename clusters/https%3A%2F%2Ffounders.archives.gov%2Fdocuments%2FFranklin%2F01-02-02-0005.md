orations of the Head, which they think it the inevitable Fate of a Fumbler to wear. Then, like the Fox who could not use his Tail, (but the Fox had really lost it) they set up for Advisers, as the Gentleman I have been dealing with; and would fain persuade others, that the Use of their own Tails is more mischievous than beneficial. But I shall leave him to Repentance; and endeavour to make the Reader some Amends for my Scribble, by adding the following Verses from the two best English Poets that ever were; only hinting, that by the first two Lines ’tis plain from whence our Poetical Adviser had his Inspiration.  
  
  
Our Maker bids increase; who bids abstain,  
But our Destroyer, foe to God and Man?  
Hail wedded Love! mysterious Law, true source  
Of human Offspring, sole propriety  
In Paradise! of all Things common else.  
By thee adult’rous Lust was driv’n from Men,  
Among the bestial Herds to range; by thee,  
(Founded in Reason, loyal, just, and pure)  
Relations dear, and all the Charities  
Of Father, Son, and Brother, first were known.  
Perpetual Fountain of domestic Sweets!  
Whose Bed is undefil’d, and chaste, pronounc’d.  
Here, Love his golden shafts employs; here lights  
His constant Lamp; and waves his purple Wings;  
Reigns here, and revels: not in the bought smile  
Of harlots; loveless, joyless, un-endear’d;  
Casual fruition!  Milton  
  
  
But happy they! the happiest of their Kind!  
Whom gentler Stars unite, and in one Fate  
Their Hearts, their Fortunes, and their Beings blend.  
’Tis not the coarser Tie of human Laws,  
Unnatural oft, and foreign to the Mind,  
Which binds their Peace, but Harmony itself,  
Attuning all their Passions into Love;  
Where Friendship full-exerts his softest Power,  
Perfect Esteem enliven’d by Desire  
Ineffable, and Sympathy of Soul,  
Thought meeting Thought, and Will preventing Will,  
With boundless Confidence; for nought but Love  
Can answer Love, and render Bliss secure.  
—— those whom Love cements, in holy Faith,  
And equal Transport, free as Nature, live,  
Disdaining Fear; for what’s the World to them,  
It’s Pomp, it’s Pleasure, and it’s Nonsense all!  
Who in each other clasp whatever fair  
High Fancy forms, and lavish Heart can wish,  
  
Something than Beauty dearer, should they look  
Or on the Mind, or mind-illumin’d Face;  
Truth, Goodness, Honour, Harmony and Love,  
The richest Bounty of indulgent Heaven.  
Mean-time a smiling Offspring rises round,  
And mingles both their Graces. By degrees,  
The human Blossom blows; and every Day,  
Soft as it rolls along, shows some new Charm,  
The Father’s Lustre, and the Mother’s Bloom.  
Then infant Reason grows apace, and calls  
For the kind Hand of an assiduous Care;  
Delightful Task! to rear the tender Thought,  
To teach the young Idea how to shoot,  
To pour the fresh Instruction o’er the Mind,  
To breathe th’ inspiring Spirit, and to plant  
The generous Purpose in the glowing Breast.  
Oh speak the Joy! You, whom the sudden Tear  
Surprizes often, while you look around,  
And nothing strikes your Eye but Sights of Bliss,  
All various Nature pressing on the Heart,  
Obedient Fortune, and approving Heaven.  
These are the Blessings of diviner Love;  
And thus their Moments fly; the Seasons thus,  
As ceaseless round a jarring World they roll,  
Still find them happy; and consenting Spring  
Sheds her own rosy Garland on their Head:  
Till Evening comes at last, cool, gentle, calm;  
When after the long vernal Day of Life,  
Enamour’d more, as Soul approaches Soul,  
Together, down they sink in social Sleep.Thomson.  
  
  
I am, Sir,

CONJUGAL FELICITY. &quot; HAPPY they Î the  
happiest of their kind ! Whom gentler  
stars unite, and in one fate Their  
hearts, their fortunes, and their beings  
blend. &#x27;Tis not the coarser tie of human  
laws, Unnat&#x27;ral oft&#x27;, and foreign to the  
mind, That binds their peace, but  
harmony itself, Attuning all their  
passions into love, Where friendship  
full exerts her sofiest power, Perfect  
esteem, enlivened by desire Ineffable,  
and sympathy of soul ; Thought meeting  
thought, and will preventing will, .  
With boundless confidence ; for nought  
but love Can answer love, and render  
bhss secure. -What is the world to them,  
Its pomp, its pleasure, and its nonsense  
all ! Who in each other clasp whatever  
fair High fancy forms, and lavish hearts  
can wish ? Something than beauty dearer,  
should they look, Or on the mind, or  
mind-illumin&#x27;d face : Truth, goodness,  
honour, harmony, and love, The ritchest  
bounty of indulgent Heav&#x27;n. Meantime a  
smiling,offspring rises round, Then  
infant reason grows apace, and calls /

Delightful task ! to rear the tender

shoot, To pour the fre^h instruction  
o&#x27;er the mind, To breatliG th&#x27;  
enlivening spirit, and to fix The  
geneious purpose in the glowing breast.  
Oh speak, the joy ! retirement,  
friendship, books, Ease and alternate  
labour, useful life, These are the  
matchless joys of virtuous love} -The  
seasons various, &#x27; As ceaseless round a  
jarring world they roll, Still find them  
happy, and consenting spring Sheds her  
own rosy garland on their heads : Till  
ev&#x27;ning comes at last, serene and mild,  
When, after the long vernal day of life,

Something than beauty dearer, should they look  
Or on the mind, or mind-illumin&#x27;d face—  
  
Truth, goodness, honor, harmony, and love,  
The richest bounty of indulgent Heaven.  
  
Meantime a smiling offspring rises round,  
And mingles both their graces. By degrees,  
The haman blossom blows; and every day,  
Soft as it rolls along, shows some new charm,  
The father’s lustre and the mother’s bloom.  
Then infant reason grows apace, and calls  
  
For the kind hand of an assiduous care.  
  
Delightful task! to rear the tender thought  
  
To teach the young idea how to shoot,  
  
To pour the fresh instruction o&#x27;er the mind,  
To breathe the enlivening spirit, and to fix  
The generous purpose in the glowing breast.

of the woman is the germ of the church, and the parental instinct,  
under the sanctifying influence of the Holy Spirit, is the great human  
force by which the church is to be developed and perpetuated in the

the earth and as the stars of heaven for multitude,” is conditioned  
upon the natural precept, “be faithful and multiply and replenish the  
earth.”
