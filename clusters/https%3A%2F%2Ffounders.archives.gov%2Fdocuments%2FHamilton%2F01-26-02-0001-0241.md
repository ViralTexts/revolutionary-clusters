[New York, June 28–July 10, 1804]  
  
On my expected interview with Col Burr, I think it proper to make some remarks explanatory of my conduct, motives and views.  
I am certainly desirous of avoiding this interview, for the most cogent reasons.  
1 My religious and moral principles are strongly opposed to the practice of Duelling, and it would even give me pain to be obliged to shed the blood of a fellow creature in a private combat forbidden by the laws.  
  
2 My wife and Children are extremely dear to me, and my life is of the utmost importance to them, in various views.  
3 I feel a sense of obligation towards my creditors; who in case of accident to me, by the forced sale of my property, may be in some degree sufferers. I did not think my self at liberty, as a man of probity, lightly to expose them to this hazard.  
4 I am conscious of no ill-will to Col Burr, distinct from political opposition, which, as I trust, has proceeded from pure and upright motives.  
Lastly, I shall hazard much, and can possibly gain nothing by the issue of the interview.  
But it was, as I conceive, impossible for me to avoid it. There were intrinsick difficulties in the thing, and artificial embarrassments, from the manner of proceeding on the part of Col Burr.  
Intrinsick—because it is not to be denied, that my animadversions on the political principles character and views of Col Burr have been extremely severe, and on different occasions, I, in common with many others, have made very unfavourable criticisms on particular instances of the private conduct of this Gentleman.  
In proportion as these impressions were entertained with sincerity and uttered with motives and for purposes, which might appear to me commendable, would be the difficulty (until they could be removed by evidence of their being erroneous), of explanation or apology. The disavowal required of me by Col Burr, in a general and indefinite form, was out of my power, if it had really been proper for me to submit to be so questionned; but I was sincerely of opinion, that this could not be, and in this opinion, I was confirmed by that of a very moderate and judicious friend whom I consulted. Besides that Col Burr appeared to me to assume, in the first instance, a tone unnecessarily peremptory and menacing, and in the second, positively offensive. Yet I wished, as far as might be practicable, to leave a door open to accommodation. This, I think, will be inferred from the written communications made by me and by my direction, and would be confirmed by the conversations between Mr van Ness and myself, which arose out of the subject.  
I am not sure, whether under all the circumstances I did not go further in the attempt to accommodate, than a pun[c]tilious delicacy will justify. If so, I hope the motives I have stated will excuse me.  
  
It is not my design, by what I have said to affix any odium on the conduct of Col Burr, in this case. He doubtless has heared of animadversions of mine which bore very hard upon him; and it is probable that as usual they were accompanied with some falshoods. He may have supposed himself under a necessity of acting as he has done. I hope the grounds of his proceeding have been such as ought to satisfy his own conscience.  
I trust, at the same time, that the world will do me the Justice to believe, that I have not censured him on light grounds, or from unworthy inducements. I certainly have had strong reasons for what I may have said, though it is possible that in some particulars, I may have been influenced by misconstruction or misinformation. It is also my ardent wish that I may have been more mistaken than I think I have been, and that he by his future conduct may shew himself worthy of all confidence and esteem, and prove an ornament and blessing to his Country.  
As well because it is possible that I may have injured Col Burr, however convinced myself that my opinions and declarations have been well founded, as from my general principles and temper in relation to similar affairs—I have resolved, if our interview is conducted in the usual manner, and it pleases God to give me the opportunity, to reserve and throw away my first fire, and I have thoughts even of reserving my second fire—and thus giving a double opportunity to Col Burr to pause and to reflect.  
It is not however my intention to enter into any explanations on the ground. Apology, from principle I hope, rather than Pride, is out of the question.  
To those, who with me abhorring the practice of Duelling may think that I ought on no account to have added to the number of bad examples—I answer that my relative situation, as well in public as private aspects, enforcing all the considerations which constitute what men of the world denominate honor, impressed on me (as I thought) a peculiar necessity not to decline the call. The ability to be in future useful, whether in resisting mischief or effecting good, in those crises of our public affairs, which seem likely to happen, would probably be inseparable from a conformity with public prejudice in this particular.

g my own affairs.  
The following paper, in the hand writing  
of General Hamilton, was inclosed with  
his will and some other papers, in a packet  
addressed to’one of his executors, which  
was of course not to have been delivered, f V  
but in case ofYhe melancholy event that  
has ’ •&quot;&#x27;nened. As it contains his motives,  
and ’■ ctions on the causes that have led  
to this Lital catastrophe, it is deemed pro­  
per to communicate it to the publick.  
  
No. .12.  
On my expected interview’ with Colo­  
nel Burr, I think it proper to make some  
remarks explanatory of my conduct,, mo­  
tives and views.  
I was certainly desirous of avoiding this  
interview, for the most cogent reasons.  
1. My religious and moral principles are  
strongly opposed to the practice of duel­  
ling, and it would ever give me pain to be  
obliged to shed the blocd of a fellow crea­  
ture, in a private combat, forbidden by the  
laws.  
2. My wTife and children are extremely  
dear to me, and my life is of the utmost  
importance to them, in various views.  
3. I feel a sense of obligation toward*  
my creditors, who . in case of accident to  
me. by the forced ‘’sale of my property,,  
may be in some degree sufferers, I did  
not think myself at liberty, as a man of pro- v,  
bity, lightly to expose them to this ha3nrd.  
4. 1 am coscious of no ill will to Colo- -  
nel Burr, distinct from political opposition,  
which, as I trust, has proceeded lroin pure  
and upright motives.  
Lastly, I shall hazard much, and can  
possibly gain nothing by the issue of the  
interview’.  
But it was,- as I conceive, impossible  
lor me to avoid it. T here vvere intrinsicIt  
difficulties in the thing, ami* artificial em­  
barrassments, from the manner of proceed­  
ing on the part of Colonel Burr.  
Intrinsick, because it is not to be denied,  
that my animadversions on the political  
principles, character, and views of Colonel  
Burr, have been extremely severe, and on  
different occasions, I, in co$tmor; with  
many others, have made very unfavoura­  
ble criticisms on particular instances of the  
private conduct of this gentleman.  
* In proportion as these impressions were  
entertained with sincerity and uttered with  
motives, and for purposes, which might ap­  
pear to me commendable, would be the  
difficulty (until they could be removed by  
evidence of their being erroneous) of .ex- &#x27;  
pltmation or apology. The disavowal re­  
quired of me by Colonel Burr, in a gene­  
ral and indefinite form, was out of my  
power, if it hud really been proper fer ms  
to submit to be so questioned ; but I was  
sincerely of opinion, that this could not  
be; and in this opinion I was confirmed l&gt;v  
  
that ot a very moderate and judicious  
friend whom I consulted. Besides that  
Colonel Burr appeared to me to assume,  
in the first instance, a tone unnecessarily  
peremptory and menacing, and$n the se-&#x27;  
cond, positively offensive. Yet 1 wished,  
as far as might be practicable, to leave a  
door open to accommodation. &lt;- This, I  
think will be inferred from the written -■  
communications made by me, and by my  
direction, and would be confirmed by con­  
versations between Mr. Van Ness and my*  
self, which arose out of the subject. ,  
t i ail1 not sure, whether, under all the  
circumstances, I did not go further in the &#x27;  
attempt to accommodate, than a punctilious  
delicacy will justify. If so I hope the ,  
motive I have stated will excuse me. j\ r  
It is not my design, by what I have said  
to affix any odium on the conduct of Colo­  
nel Burr, in this , case—-He doubtless ha*  
heard of animadversions of mine jrhich  
bore very hard upotr him ; and it is prbba- *  
hie that, as usual, they _were accompanied&#x27; &#x27;  
tvith some falsehoods. &#x27;He may have sup­  
posed himself under a necessity of acting n»  
he has done. I hope , the grounds of his f

have injured Colonel Burr, however con­  
vinced mvself that my opinions and decla­  
rations have been well founded, as from my  
general principles and temper in relation to  
similar affairs—I have resolved, if our in­  
terview is conducted in the usual manner,  
and it pleases God to give me the opportu­  
nity, to reserve and throw away my first  
fire, and I have thoughts even of reserving  
-- my second fire—and thus giving a double

to reflect. * . ; »  
  
it is not, no.wever, my intention to enter  
into any explanations on the ground—Apo­  
logy from principle, I hope, rather than  
pride, is out of the question.  
To those 4who,^ ith me, abhorring the  
practice of duelling, may think that I ought  
on no account to have added to the number  
i of bad examples, I answer, that my relative  
• situation, as well in publick as private, en­  
forcing all the considerations which consti­  
tute what men of the world denominate ho­  
nour, imposed on me (as I thought) a pecu­  
liar necessity not to decline the call. The  
£ ability to be in future useful, whether in  
resisting mischief or effecting good, in  
those crisis of our publick affairs which  
seem likely to happen, would probably be  
inseparable from a conformity with publick  
prejudice in this particular.

On rr.y cxpeflcd interview.with Coh Eurr, I  
  
think it proper to make fome remarks explana­  
tory of my conduct, motives and views.  
I was certainly delirous of avoiding this inter­  
view for the molt cogent reafons.  
1. My religious and moral principles are  
(tronglv oppoled to the practice of duelling, and  
it would ever give me pain to be obliged to died  
the blood of a fellow creature in a private com­  
bat forbidden by the laws.  
&quot;• My wife and children are extremely dear  
to me, and my lite is of the utmoft importance to  
them, in various views.  
3. I feel a fenfe of obligation towards my cre­  
ditors ; who in cafe of accident to me, by the  
forced file of my property, may be in fome de­  
gree fufr&#x27;erers. 1 did not think myfelf at liberty  
as a m.m of probity, lightly to expofe them to  
this hazard.  
4.1 am confcious of no ill will to Col. Burr,  
diliinCt from political oppoiition, which as l  
trult, has proceeded from pure and upright mo­  
tives.  
Laftly, 1 dull hazard much, ami can poflibly  
gain nothing by the iliueof the interview.  
But it was, as I conceive, impofiible for me to  
avoid it. There were intrinfic difficulties in  
the tiling, and artificial embarralTments, from  
the manner of proceeding on the part of Col.  
Burr.  
  
Intrinfick, becaufe it is not to be denied, that  
my animadversions oh the political principles,  
character and views of Col. Burr, have been ex­  
tremely fevere, and on different oeealions, I, in  
common with many others, have made very un­  
favourable criticifiiis on particular infiances of  
the private conduit of this Gentleman.  
In proportion as thefe impreflions were enter­  
tained with fincerity and uttered with motives  
and for purpofes, which might appear to me  
commendable would he the difficulty (until they  
could be removed by evidence of their bring er­  
roneous) of explanation or apology. The dis­  
avowal required of me by Col. Burr, in a gene­  
ral and indefinite form, was out of my power,  
if it had really been proper for me to fubmit to  
be fo queftioned ; but 1 was lincercly of opini­  
on, that this could not be, and in this opinion, I  
was confirmed by that of a very moderate and  
judicious friend whom I confulted. Bcfides  
that Col. Burr appeared to me 1&lt;&gt; afi&#x27;ume, in the  
firft inftance, a tone unnecefinrity peremptory  
and menacing, and in the fecond, pofitively of­  
fenfive. Yet I willied, as far as might he prac­  
ticable, to leave a door open to accommodation.  
This, I think, will be inferred from the written  
communications made by me and by my direc­  
tion, and would be confii med by the convcrfati­  
ons between Mr. Van Nefsand myfelf, which a­  
rofe out of the fubjedl.  
I am not fare, whether, under all thecircum­  
Hances, I did not go further in the attempt to ac­  
commodate, than a punctilious delicacy will  
juftify. If fo, I hope the motives I have Hated  
will excufe me.  
It is not my defign, by what I have laid to af­  
fix any odium on the conduct of Col. Burr, in  
this cafe—lie doubtlefs has heard of animadver­  
iions of mine which bore very hard upon him ;  
and it is probable that as ufuai t hey were accom­  
panied with fomefalfhood. He may have fup­  
pofed himfelf under a neceflUy of acting as he  
has dene. I hope the grounds of his proceeding  
have been fuchas ought tofaiisfy hia own con­  
fcicncc.  
I trufl, at the fame time, that the world will  
do me the juftice to btlieve, that I have not cen­  
fured him on light grounds, nor from unworthy  
inducements. I certainly have had ftrong re t­  
lbns for what I may have laid, though it is  
lible that in fome particulars, 1 may have been  
i fiuertced by mifconfiriaftion or milinformatiou.  
It is alii) my ardent wilh that 1 may have been  
more miftaken than i think I have been, and that  
he, by his future conduct, rnay fhew himfelf  
worthy of all confidci.cc and efteem, and prove  
an ornament and bluffing to the country.  
As well becaufe it is pofnble that I may have  
injured Col. Burr, however convinced myfelf  
that my opinions and declarations have been well  
founded, as from my general principles and tem­  
per in relation to limilaraffairs—1 have rcfolved,  
if our interview is conducted in the ufuai man­  
ner, and it pleafes God to give me the opportu­  
nity, to referve and tbrozv away my tirlt fire,  
and I have thoughts even of rr/rr vi/ig my fecond  
  
lire—and tnus giving a i.ouhie opportunity to  
Col. Burr to paufe and to reflect.  
It is not, however, my intention to enter into  
any explanations on t he ground—Apology, from  
principle I hope, rather than pride, is out of the  
queftioii.  
Tothofe, who, with me, abhorring the prac­  
tice of duelling may think that I ought on no ac­  
count to have added to the number of bad exam­  
ples, I anfwer that my relative fituation, as well  
in public as private, enforcing all tiie confidera­  
tions which conftitute what men of the world  
denominate honour, impofed on me (as I  
thought) a peculiar r.eceflity not to decline the  
call. The ability to be in future ufefnl, whether  
in refilling milchief or effecting good, in thole  
crifes of our public affairs, which feem likely to  
happen, would probably be infcparable from a  
conformity with public prejudice in this parti­  
cular.

On rr.y expefted interview with Col.  
Burr, i think it proper to make some re­  
marks explanatory of my condubl, mo­  
tives and views.  
I was certainly desirous of avoiding this  
interview, for the most cogent reasons.  
1. My religious and moral principles  
are sltongly opposed to the practice of du­  
elling, and it would ever give me pain to  
be obliged to shed the blond of a fellow  
crea-urc in a private combat foibidden by  
the law i. .  
My wife and rhildron arc extremely  
dear to me, and my life is of the utmost  
Importance to them, in vat ions views.  
3- I r. el a sense of obligation towards  
my cie-b’.ors ; who in rase of accident to  
me, hv the forced sale of my property,  
may be in some degree sufferers. I did  
no* think mvself at liberty as a loan of  
probity, lightly to expose them to this ba­  
z ml. *  
4 lam conscious of no ill will to Col.  
Ihirr, distinfc) from political opposition,  
which, as I trust, has proceeded horn pure  
and upright motives.  
lastly, I shrill hazard much, and can  
possibly get nothing by the issue of the  
interview.  
Hut it was, as I conceive, impossible  
for me to avoid it. There were intrinsic  
k difficulties in flie thing, and artrficiil cm­  
bnn-assmems, from the manner of nro­  
  
k vet-ding on the part oT Col. Durr*  
F Intrinsic, because it is net tobe denied,  
t! at my animadversions on the political  
Principles, chat after and view, of Colonel  
jbtrr, have been extremely severe, and on  
different occasions, I, in common with  
tnanv others, have made very unfavorable  
criticisms on particular ir.stnnoefc of the  
.private conduct of this gentleman.  
In proportion as these impressions were  
entertained with sincerity and uttered with  
motives and* for purposes, which might  
appear to me c.ommendahle, would he the  
i difficulty (until they could be removed by  
evidence of their being erroneous) of ex*  
pianation or apology. The disavowal rc«  
rjuired of me bv Col. Ilurr, in a general  
and indefinite form, was opt oT my pow­  
er, if it h^d really been proper for me to  
Submit tobe so questioned ; but I was sin*  
Merely of opinion, that this could not he. Sc  
in this opinion, 1 was confirmed by that o|  
n vorv moderate and judicious friend  
&quot;fem I consulted. Iltside* that Col Ilurr  
appeared to me to asstime, in the first in­  
stance, a tope unnecessarily pererntory  
und menacing, and in the second, posi­  
tiv. lv offensive. Vet I wished, ns far as  
n&quot;ght be pra-Sirablc. to leave a door open  
to accommodation. This, I think, will be  
interred from the written communications  
made by me and by my diref.ion, and  
  
1  
I would be confirmed by the conversations  
[ between Mr. Van Ness and myself,-which  
i arose out of the subjeft.  
j 1 am no* sure, wliethet, tinder all the  
! circumstances, 1 did not go further in the  
j attempt to accommodate, than u puncti­  
lious delicacy will justify. If so, I hope  
ilur motives I have slated will excuse me.  
It is not my des&#x27;gn, by what 1 have said  
to affix any odium on the condutt of Col.  
Hun*, iti this case—He doubtless has heard  
ol animadversions oT mine which bore ve»  
; ry I|ar&lt;l upon him ; and it is probable that  
! as usual they were accompanied with some  
falsehoods. He may have supposed him.  
; 3cil under a necessity oi acting as he has  
donc2 1 hope the grounds of his proceed­  
i ing have been such as ought to satisfy his  
1 own conscience.  
I trust, at the same time, that the world  
j W«II do me the justice to believe that I have  
not censured him on light grounds, nor  
irom unworthy inducements. 1 certainly  
have had strong reasons for what I may  
have said, tho’ it is possible*that in some  
particulars, I may have been influenced  
by misconstruction or misinformation. It  
is also my ardent wish that I may have  
been more mistaken than I think I have  
been, and that he, by his future conduct,  
may she v himself worthy of all confi  
deuce a, d esteem, ami prove an ornament  
I and blessing to the country.  
| As well because it is possible that I may  
have injured Col, Hurt*, however convin­  
ced myselt that my opinions and declara  
lions have been well rounded, as from my  
general principles and temper in relation  
to similar affairs—-I have resolved, if our  
interview is conducted in the usual man­  
ner, and it pleases God to give me the  
opportunity to reserve and throw ansnj my  
first fire, and I have thtughia even of re­  
serving my second fire, and thus giving a  
double oi ponunity to Col. Hurt* to pause  
and to reflect.  
It is not, however, my intention to enter  
into any explanations on the ground. A­  
: Pology, Horn principle I hone, rather than  
  
pride, is out of the question.  
In (hose, who, wi&#x27;.h me, abhorring the  
praflice of duelling may think that I aught  
on no account to have added to the num  
her of bad examples, 1 answer that my rr­  
latn&#x27;r situation, as well in public a? private,  
enforceing all the considerations which  
constitute what nun of the world denonji  
nate honor, imposed on me (aa 1 thought)  
a peculiar necessity not to decline thexall.  
1 he ability to he in future useful, whether  
in resisting mischief or eflefling good in  
those cri«ts of our public affairs, which  
se*m likely to happen, would probably he  
inseparable from u conformity with public  
prejudice in this particular. A. II

was confirmed bv that of a verv mo-

derate ancl judicious friend v horn I ;

appeared to me to assume, in tlu!

peremptory and menacing:, ;md in  
  
thevecoi,cI, positively offensive. a  
I wished, as fur as might be praclr­  
cable, to I-jxive it door open to accom­  
modation. This, I think, will he  
inferred from the communication;  
made by me and by my direction-,  
and would be confirmed by the con­  
versation between Mr. Van Ness aiir  
myself, which aro.e out 01 the Mil.

I am not sure, whether, umW.ai  
the circumstances, I did not ?;o h;r  
  
r therin the attempt to acromm&#x27;od  
  
than i , punctilious delicacy will  
tify. If so I hope the nutiv.  
Y 1  
  
1 nave stated v4i excuse me.  
  
It is not my design, by wi-.w  
  
have said, to affix any odium on t:  
  
conduct of CoJ. Burr, in this cuv  
  
He doubtless had heard of animai  
  
versions oi mine which uem . ve-  
  
hard upon him ; and it is probabh  
  
they were as usual accompanied wit:  
  
some falshoods. He mav have bU&#x27;  
  
posed himself under a necessity c  
acting as he has done. I hope th  
grounds of his proceeding have l)ee  
suchas ought to satisfy his own consci­  
ence.I trust, at the same time, that the  
world will do me the justice to bt­  
iieve, that I, have not censured hiii­  
on light grounds, nor from unwor­  
thy inducements. ,1 certainly have  
had strong reasons for what I may  
have, said, though it is possihle that  
in some particulars, I may have been  
influenced by misconstruction or  
  
misinformation. It is also my ar­  
dent wish that I may have been  
  
more mistaken man I think. Ivbave  
been, and tht ho, by his future con­  
duct, may shew himself worthy of  
all confidence and esteem, and prove  
an ornament and blessing&#x27; to the  
country.  
As well because it is possible that I  
may have injured Gol. Burr, however  
convinced myself that my opinions  
ancl declarations have been well foun­  
ded, as from my general principles  
and temper in relation to similar af  
fairs- I have resolved, if our. inter  
  
view is conducted in the usuiM man  
  
ner, and it pleases God to trive&#x27;me  
  
the opportunity, to ristr-ot and thrn-zo  
  
away my first fire, and I have thoughts  
  
even ot reserving my second fire, ana  
thus giving a double opportunity to  
Col. Burr to pause and to reflect.  
It is not, however, my intention to.  
enter into any explanations on the  
the ground. Apology, from princi­  
ple I&#x27; hope, rather than pride, is out  
of the question. ,  
v To those, who, with me, abhor­  
ring the practice . of duelling may  
think that I ought on no account to  
have added! to the number of bad ex­  
amples, I answer that my relative si­  
tuation, as well in public as private,  
enforcing all the considerations which  
comstkute$what men of the worfrj de­  
notninate honor, imposed on mexas  
  
l thought) a peculiar necessity not  
to decline the call. The ability to  
he in future useful, whether in resist­  
ing mischief or effecting goodin  
those crises., of our pu!ic affair  
which seem likely, to happen, woulci  
nrobably be inseparable fir-nf a con­

_ On my expeflcd interview with Colonel  
Burr, 1 think it proper to make some re­  
marks explanatory of my condult, motives,  
and views. , :  
I was certainly defirons of avoiding this  
interview, for the most cogent reasons :  
.. 1. My religious and moral principles are  
firongly opposed to the praflice of duelling,  
.and it would ever give me pain to be oblig­  
¢d to shed the blood of a fellow creatare 1n  
a private combat forbidden by the laws.  
2. My wife dnd childreu are extremely  
dear to me, and my life is of the ntmoft im­  
portance to them, in various views. v  
8. 1 feel a [enfe ot obiigation towards my  
creditors, who in cale of accident to me, by  
the forced sale of my property, may be in  
some degree fufferers : 1 did not think my­  
feif at liberty as a man of probity, likely to  
expose them to this baza:d.  
4. 1 atd conlcious ot no i/ will to Col,  
Burr diflin&amp; from political oppohtion,  
which, as I trust, has proceeded from pure  
and vpright motives,  
Lastly, 1 {hall hazard much, and ¢an pof­  
-fibly gain noxh’ing% issue of the inter.  
view, s .  
But it was, as I conceive, impossible for  
me to aveid it. There were zntrinfic diffi­  
cultics in the thing, and artificial embarrefl­  
ments, from the nature of procezcing on the  
part of Mr. Barr.  
Intricfic, because it is not to be denied,  
that my animadversions, on the political  
principles, charaßter and views of col. Burr,  
have been extremely severe, and on ciffer­  
ent occasions, I, in common with many oth.  
crs, have made very unfavorable criticisms  
on particular inflances of the private conduét  
of this geotleman, : ¥  
In preportion as thafe impressions weré  
- entertgined with sincerity and utteted with  
totives and for purpoles, which might ap­  
pear to me comimendable, woold be the dif­  
ficalty (until they ¢ould be removed by evi­  
dence of their being erroneons) of explana­  
“tion or apology, The disavowal required  
of me by col. Borr, in a general and indef­  
&quot; ipite form, was out of my power, if it had  
teally beea proper for m# to submit to be so  
qteflioned ; but I was sincerely of opinion,  
~ that this cculd not be, and in this opinion,  
. I was confirmed by that of a very moderate  
&#x27;~ and judicious fricod whom I confulied. Be­  
sides that col. Burr appeared to me to al­  
~ {ume, in the fiff inflance, a tonc unnecefla­  
i rily perempiory and menacing, and in the  
second, positively cffenfive.. Yetl wished,  
&quot; as far as nfight be praélicable, to leave a  
~ door open to accommeodation. = This, I  
&#x27; think, will be inferred from the written  
{ communications made by me and by my di­  
~ reftion, aod would be confirmed by conver.  
~ fations between Mr. Van Nefs and myfelf,  
~ which arose out of the fubjeét. o A  
1 am not {ure, whether, under all the cir­  
&#x27; comftances, 1 did not go farther in the at­  
~ tempt to accommodate, than a pue&amp;ilious  
{ delicacy will joftify. Iffo I hope the mo­  
- tives I have stated will excuse me. o  
It is not my design, by whai I have said, to  
~ affix any odium onthecondu&amp; of col. Barr,  
&quot; io this cale—he doabtlefs has heard of ani.  
madverfions of mine which bore very hard  
upon him ; andit is pfobable that as, usual  
they wereacéompanied \_q;.ith l&#x27;o@‘cfald:oods.  
He may have luppofcd himfelf ander a ne­

4. I)  
_ - - -conscious of no ill will to Col  
Burr, distinct from poKtical opposition  
which, as I truat, ha. proceeded thin  
-we and upright motive..  
Lmdy, I shall hazard much, and  
of th  
**•* it was, aa I conceive, impoasible  
  
far me to .toid ft. There were intrin­  
wl difficulties in the thing, end artificial  
embarrassments, from the manner of pro­  
ceeding on the put of Col. Burr. Intrin­  
sick, because it is not to be denied, that  
my animadversions on the political prin­  
ciples, character and-views of CoL Burr,  
have been eatremely severe, and on dif­  
ferent occasions, 1, in common with ma­  
ny otheri, have made very unfavourable  
criticisms on particular instances of the  
private eonducQpf this Gentleman.  
fn proportion an these impressions  
were entertained with sincerity and otter­  
ed with motives and for purposes, which  
might appear to me commendable, would  
be the difficulty (until they could be re­  
moved by evidence of their being erro­  
neous,) of explanation or apology. The  
disavowal required of me by CoL Burr,  
in a general and indefinite form, was out  
of my power, if it had really been proper  
for me to submit to be to questioned, but  
I was sincerely of opinion, that this could  
not be, and M this opinion, I was con­  
firmed by that of a very moderate and ju­  
dicious friend whom I consulted. Be­  
sides that Col. Burr appeared to me to as­  
surtie, in the first instance, a tone unne­  
cessarily peremptory and menacing, and  
in the second, positively offensive. Yet  
I wished, as far as might be practicable.  
to leave a door open to accommodation.  
This, I think, will be inferred from the  
written communications made bv me, and  
by my direction, and would be confirmed  
by the conversations between Mr. Van  
Ness and myself, which arose out of  
the subject.  
  
&#x27; lkm not wire, whether, under all the  
circumstances, I did not go further in the  
attempt to accommodate, than a punctili­  
ous delicacy will justify. If so, I hope  
the motives I have stated will excuse me.  
It ii not my design, by what I have said  
to affix any, odium on the conduct of Col.  
Durr, in this case—&#x27;He doubtless has  
heard Of animadversions of mine which  
Oore very hard upon him: and it is pro­  
bable that as usual they were accompani­  
ed with some falshooch. He may have  
supposed himself under a necessity of  
acting as he has done. I hope the grounds  
of his proceeding have been such as  
ought to satisfy his own conscience.  
1 trust, at the same time, that the  
world will do me the justice to believe,  
that I have, not censured him on light  
grounds, nor from unworthy induce­  
ments. I certainly have had strongrea­  
sons forw hat { may have said, though it  
is possible that in some particulars, I  
may have been influenced by miscon­  
struction or misinformation. It is ■!«/&gt;  
my ardent wish that I may have been  
more mistaken than I think I have been,  
and that he, by his future conduct, may  
shew himself worthy of all confidence  
and esteem, and prove an ornament and  
blessing to the country.  
  
A* well because it is possible that I  
may have injured CoL Burr, however  
convinced myself that mv opinions aad  
declarations have been well founded, as  
from my general principles and temper in  
relation t6 similar affairs—I haveresolv.  
cd, if our intervic# is conducted in the  
usual manner, and it pleases God to give  
me the opportunity, to recover and throw  
away my first fire, and I have thoughts  
even of reserving my second fire—aad  
thus giving a double opportunity to CoL  
Burr to panes and to relecc.  
It is not, however, my intention to ea­  
terinto any explanations on the ground—  
Apology, from principle I hope, rather  
than pride, is out of the question.  
to those, who, with me, abhorring  
the practice of duelling may UdnkSmf  
ought on no account to have added to the  
number of bad examples, I answer tb«t  
my relative situation, as well in public as  
private, enforcing all the considerations  
which constitute, what men of the world  
denominate honor, imposed on me (as I  
thought) a peculiar necessity not to de­  
cline the call. The ability to be in fu­  
ture useful, whether in resisting mis­  
chief or effecting good, in those ensis of  
public affairs, which seem likely to hap­  
pen, would probably be inseparable from  
a conformity with public prejudice in this  
particular. A.H

“* On my expeéted interview with Colonel Burr, I think it  
proper to make fome remarks, explanatory of my conduét, moe  
tives, and views. I was certainly defirous of avoiding this in-  
al for the moft cogent reafons.  
  
. My religious and moral principles are ftrongly oppofed  
to ‘se ‘prattice of duelling, and it would ever give me pain to  
be obliged to fhed the blood of a fellow creature, in a private

“2, My wife and children are extremely dear to me, and  
my life is of the utmoft importance to them, in various views.  
  
“ 9. I feel a fenfe of obligation towards my creditors,*who,  
in cafe of accident to me, by the forced fale of my property,  
may be, in fome degree, fufferers. I did not think myfelf at

Laftly, I thall hazard much, and can poffibly gain nothing  
by the iffue of the interview.  
  
‘ But it was, as 1 conceive, impoffible for me to avoid it.  
There were intrinfic difficulties in the thing, and artificial  
embarraffments, from the manner of proceeding on the part of  
Colonel Burr. Intrinfic, becaufe it is not to be denied, that my  
animadverfions on the political principles, chara€ter, and views  
of Colonel Burr, have been extremely fevere ; and on different  
occafions I, in common with many others, have made very tn-  
favourable criticifms on particular inftances of the private con-  
du&amp; of this gentleman. In proportion as thefe impreffions were  
entertained with fincerity, and uttered with motives and for pur-  
pofes which might appear to me commendable, would be the  
difficulty (until they could be removed by evidence of their be-  
ing erroneous) of explanation or apology. The difavowal re-  
quired of me by Colonel Burr, in a general and indefinite form,  
was out of my power, if it had really been proper for me to  
fubmit to be fo queftic oned ; but I was fincerely of opin on this  
could not be, and in this opinion I was confirmed by that of a  
very moderate and judicious friend whom I confulted, Befides  
that, Colonel Burr appeared to aflume, in the firft inftance, a  
tone unneceffarily peremptory and menacing, and, in the fecond,  
pofitively offenfive. Yet I withed, as far as might be praética.

be inferred from the written communications made by me and  
my direétion, and would be confirmed by the converfations be.  
tween Mr. Van Nefs and myfelf, which arofe out of the fub.  
je&amp;t. Iam not fure whether, under all the circumftances, I did  
not go farther in the attempt to accommodate than a punétilious  
delicacy will juftify. If fo, I hope the motives I have flated will  
excufe me.  
  
** It is not my defign, by what I have faid, to affix any odium on  
the conduét of Colonel Burr, in this cafe ; he, doubtlefs, has heard  
of animadverfions of mine which bore very hard upon him ; and  
it is probable, that, as ufual, they were accompanied with fome  
falfehood. He may have fuppofed himfelf under a neceflity of  
afting as he has done. I hope the grounds of his proceeding have  
been fuch as ought to fatisfy his own confcience.  
  
“I truft, at the fame time, that the world will do me the juftice  
to believe, that I have not cenfured him on light grounds, nor  
from unworthy inducements. I certainly have had {trong rea-  
fons for what I may have faid, though it is poffible, that, in fome  
particulars, I may have been influenced by mifconftru€tion, or  
mifinformation. Itis alfo my ardent wifh that I may have been  
more miftaken than I think I have been, and that he, by the fame  
future conduét, may fhew himfelf worthy of all confidence and  
efteem, and prove an ornament and bleffing tothe country. As  
well becaufe it is poffible that I may have injured Colonel Burr,  
however convinced myfclf that my opinions and declarations  
have been well founded, as from my general principles and tem-  
per in relation to fimilar affairs, I have refolved, if our inter-  
view is conduéted in the ufual manner, and it pleafes God to give  
me the opportunity, to referve and throw away my firft fire, and  
I have thought even of referving my fecond fire, and thus giving  
a double opportunity for Colonel Burr to paufe and to refle€.  
It is not, however, my intention to enter into any explanations  
on the ground.—Apology, from principle, I hope, rather than  
pride, is out of the queftion. To thofe who, with me, abhor-  
ting the praétice of duelling, may think that I ought, on no ac-  
count, to have added tothe number of bad examples, I anfwer,  
that my relative fituation, as well in public as private, enforcing  
all the confiderations which conftitute what men of the world  
denominate honour, impofed on me (as 1 thought) a peculiar  
nc¢eflity not to decline the call. The ability to be in future ufeful,  
whether in refilling mifchief or effe€ting good, in thofe crifis of  
our public affairs, which feem likely to happen, would probably  
be infeparable from a conformity with public prejudice in this

“On my expected interview with Colonel  
Burr, I think it proper to make some remarks,  
explanatory of my conduct, motives and views.  
“I was certainly desirous of avoiding this in­  
terview, for the most cogent reasons. 1. My re  
ligious and moral principles are strongly  
opposed to the practice of duelling, and it would  
ever give me pain to be obliged to shed the blood  
of a-fellow creature, in a private combat, for­  
bidden by the laws. 2. My wife and children  
are extremely dear to me, and my life is of the  
utmost importance to them, in various views. 3.  
I feel a sense of obligation towards my credi­  
tors, who, in case of accident to me, may, by  
the forced sale of my property, be in some de­  
gree sufferers. I did not think myselfat liber­  
ty, as a man of probity, lightly to expose them  
to this hazard. 4. I am conscious of no ill will  
to Colonel Burr, distinct from political opposi­  
tion, which, as I trust, has proceeded from pure  
and upright piotives. Lastly, I shall hazard  
much, and can possibly gain nothing by the is­  
sue of the interview. *  
“But it was, as I conceive, impossible for me  
to avoid it. There were intrinsic difficulties in  
the thing, and artificial embarrassments, from  
the manner of proceeding on the part of Colo­  
nel Burr. Intrinsic, because it is not to be de­

(1 [Lit null my cujjiuciuvuisuns un mu jnmuuaj  
principles, character, and views of Colonel  
Burr, have been extremely severe; and on dif­  
ferent occasions, I, in common with many others,  
have made very unfavorable criticisms on  
particular instances of the private conduct of  
this gentleman.  
In proportion asthesc impressions were en­  
tertained with sincerity, and uttered with mo­  
tives and for purposes which might to me ap­  
pear commendable, would be the difficulty, (un­  
til they could be removed by evidence of their  
being erroneous) of explanation or apology.—  
The disavowal required of me bv Colonel Burr,  
in a general and indefinite form, wasoutof my  
power, if it had been really proper forme to sub­  
mit to be so questioned; but I was sincerely of  
opinion, that this could not be; and in this opin­  
ion I was confirmed by a very moderate and  
judicious friend whom I consulted. Besides  
that,&#x27;Colonel Burr appeared to me to assume,  
in the first instance, a tone unnecessarily per­  
emptory and menacing; and in the second, posi­  
tively offensive. Yet I wished, as far as might  
be practicable, to leave a door open for accom­  
modation. This I think will be inferred from  
the written communication made by me, and  
by my direction; and would be confirmed by  
the conversation between Mr. Van Ness and  
myself, which arose out of the subject. I* am  
not sure whether, under all the circumstances,  
I did not go further in the attempt to accommo­  
date, than a punctilious delicacy will justify. If  
so, I hope the motives I have stated will excuse  
me.  
“It is not my design, in what I have said, to  
affix any odium on the conduct of Colonel Burr,  
in this case. He doubtless has heard of animad- &lt;  
versions of mine, which bore very hard upon  
him; and it is probable that as usual, they were  
accompanied by some falsehoods. He may  
aave supposed himself under a necessity of act­  
ngas he has done. I hope the grounds of hi

;hat he, by his future conduct, may show him­  
self worthy of all confidence arid esteem, and :

pies and temper in relation to such affairs, 1

the opportunity, to reserve and throw away my ,  
first fire; and I have thoughts even ol reserving  
my second fire; and thus giving a double oppor­  
tunity to Colonel Burr to pause and to reflect.  
It is not, however, my intention to enter into  
any explanation on the ground. Apology, from  
principle, I hope, rather than pride, is out of the  
question.

“On my expected interview with Colonel Burr, I think it proper to

“J was certainly desirous of avoiding this interview for the most

cal opposition, which, as I trust, has proceeded from pure and upright  
motives.  
  
“ Lastly, I shall hazard much, and can possibly gain nothing by the  
issue of the interview.  
  
“ But it was, as I conceive, impossible for me to avoid it. There were  
intrinsic difficulties in the thing, and artificial embarrassments from  
the manner of proceeding on the part of Colonel Burr.  
  
“ Intrinsic, because it is not to be denied that my animadversions on  
the political principles, character, and views of Colonel Burr have been  
extremely severe; and, on different occasions, I, in common with many  
others, have made very unfavourable criticisms on particular instances  
of the private conduct of this gentleman.  
  
“In proportion as these impressions were entertained with sincerity,  
and uttered with motives and for purposes which might appear to me  
commendable, would be the difficulty (until they could be removed by  
evidence of their being erroneous) of explanation or apology. The dis-  
avowal required of me by Colonel Burr, in a general and definite  
form, was out of my power, if it had really been proper for me to submit  
to be so questioned ; but I was sincerely of the opinion that this could  
not be; and in this opinion I was confirmed by that of a very moderate  
and judicious friend whom I consulted. Besides that, Colonel Burr  
appeared to me to assume, in the first instance, a tone unnecessarily  
peremptory and menacing, and, in the second, positively offensive. Yet  
I wished, as far as might be practicable, to leave a door open for accom-  
modation. This, I think, will be inferred from the written communica-  
tions made by me and by my direction, and would be confirmed by the  
conversations between Mr. Van Ness and myself which arose out of the  
subject.  
  
“Tam not sure whether, under all the circumstances, I did not go fur-  
ther in the attempt to accommodate than a punctilious delicacy will  
justify. If so, i hope the motives I have stated will excuse me.  
  
“Tt is not my design, by what I have said, to affix any odium on the  
character of Colonel Burr in this case. He doubtless has heard of ani-  
madversions of mine which bore very hard upon him ; and it is probable  
that, as usual, they were accompanied with some falsehoods. He may  
have supposed himself under a necessity of acting as he has done. I  
hope the grounds of his proceeding have been such as ought to satisfy  
his own conscience.  
  
“T trust, at the same time, that the world will do me the justice to  
believe that Ihave not censured him on light grounds nor from un-  
worthy inducements. J certainly have had strong reasons for what I  
have said, though it is possible that in some particulars I have been  
influenced by misconstruction or misinformation. It is also my ardent  
wish that I may have been more mistaken than I think I have been  
and that he, by his future conduct, may show himself worthy of al  
confidence and esteem, and prove an ornament and blessing to the  
country. ye  
  
“ As well, because it is possible that I may have injured Colonel Burr,  
however convinced thor’ 5 that my opinions and declarations have been  
well founded, as from my general principles and temper in relation to  
similar affairs, I have resolved, if our interview is conducted in the usual  
manner, and it pleases God to give me the opportunity, to reserve and  
throw away my first fire, and I have thoughts even of reserving my  
second fire, and thus giving a double opportunity to Colonel Burr to  
  
pause and to reflect. j ;  
“Tt is not, however, my intention to enter into any explanation on the

ground—apology, from principle, I hope, rather than pride, is out of the  
question.  
  
“To those who, with me, abhorring the practice of duelling, may  
think that I ought on no account to add to the number of bad examples,  
I answer, that my relative situation, as well in public as private, enforc-  
ing all the considerations which men of the world denominate honour,  
imposed on me (as I thought) a peculiar necessity not to decline the call.  
The ability to be in future useful, whether in resisting mischief or effect-  
ing good, in those crises of our public affairs which seem likely to hap-  
pen, would probably be inseparable from a conformity with prejudice in  
  
this particular. - “A. H.

On my expected interview with Col. Burr, I think it proper to make some  
remarks explanatory of my conduct, motives, and views.  
  
I was certainly desirous of avviding this interview for the most cogent  
reasons.  
1. My religious and moral principles are strongly opposed tu the practice  
of duelling, and it would ever give me pain to be obliged to shed the  
  
blood of a fellow creature in a private combat forbidden by the laws.  
  
2. My wife and children are extremely dear to me, and my life is of the  
utmost importance to them, in various views.  
  
3. I feel a sense of obligation towards my creditors; who in case of ac-  
cident to me, by the forced sale of my property, may be in some degree suf- |  
ferers. 1 did not think myself at liberty as a man of probity, lightly to ex-  
pose them to this hazard. °  
  
1. 1am conscious of no id] will to Col. Burr, distinct from political op-  
  
position, which, as I trust, has proceeded from pure and upright mo- |  
tives.

of the interview.  
  
But it was, as I conceive, impossible for me to avoid it. There were in- | Proved by the fact of nearly sixty persons being lodged in it during the week,  
trinsic difficulties in the thing, and artificial embarrassinents from the man-  
  
ner of proceeding on the part of Col. Burr.  
  
Intrinsic, because it is not to be denied, that my adimadversions on the  
political principles, character, and views of Col. Burr, have been extremely  
severe; and on different occasions, I, in eommon with many others, have  
made very unfavorable criticisms on particular instances of the private con-  
duct of this gentleman,  
  
In proportion as these impressions were entertained with sincerity, and  
uttercd with motives, and for purposes which might appear to me commend-  
  
able, would be the difficulty (until they could be removed by evidence of |  
  
their being erroneous,) of explanation or apology. The disavowal required  
of me by Col. Burr, in a general and indefinite form, was out of my power,  
if it had really been proper for me to submit to be so questioned; but I was  
sincerely of opinion that this could not be, and in this opinion, [ was con-  
firmed by that of a very moderate and judicious friend whom I consulted.  
Besides that, Col. Burr appeared to me to assume, in the first instance, a  
tone unnecessarily peremptory and menacing, and in the second, positively  
offensive. Yet I wished, as far as might be practicable, to leave a door open  
to accommodation. This, [ think, will be inferred trom the written com-  
munications made by me and by my direction, and would be confirmed by  
the conversations between Mr. Van Ness and myself, which arose out of the  
subject.  
_ [am not sure whether, under all the circumstances, I did not go further  
in the attempt to accommodate, than a punctilious delicacy will justify.  
If so, I hope the motives I have stated will excuse me. i  
It is not my design, by what I have said, to aflix any odium on the con-  
duct of Col. Burr, in this case. He doubtless has heard of animadversions  
  
of mine which bore very hard upon him ; and it is probable that as usual |  
  
they were accompanied with some falsehoods. He may have supposed hiin-  
self under a necessity of acting as he has done. I hope the grounds of his  
proceecing have been such as ought to satisfy his own conscience.  
  
I tru-t at the same time, that the world will do me the justice to believe,  
that | have not censured him on light grounds, nor from unworthy induce-  
ments. I certainly have had strong reasons fur what I have said, though it  
is possible that in some particulars, I may have been influenced by miscon-

forming him where would be lound the certain  
key to drawers in his desk, in which he had de­

The following paper as containing his motives  
for accepting the challenge ; his reflections on  
his situation ; and some remarks on the conduct  
ot the man who was to be the cause ot hi death,  
is presented as a highly interesting document.  
On my expected interview with Col Burr, I  
think it ptoper to make eouie remat ks explanato­

I was certainly desirous W avoiding this inter­

1. My religious and moral principles are strong­

has proceeded from pure and upright motives. -  
Lastly, I shntl hazard much, and can possibly

But it was, as 1 conceive, impossible forme to

manner of proceeding on the part ol Col. B.irr.  
Intrinsic, because u is not to be dented, that

It is not my design, by what I have said, to

is only mv ardent wish that I may have been  
more mistaken than I think 1 have been, and  
that he, by his future conduct may show himself

an ornament and blessing to the country.

## [From _Burlington free press._](https://www.loc.gov/resource/sn84023127/1846-10-16/ed-1/?sp=2)

#### 1846-10-16 &middot; [Burlington, Vt.](http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burlington%2C_Vermont)

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
&quot;On my expected interview with Col. Burr, I  
think it proper to make some remarks explana­  
tory of my conduct, motives and views.  
I was certainly desirious of avoiding this inter  
view for the cogent reasons,  
1. My religious and moral principles are strong­  
ly opposed to the practice of duelling, and it  
would ever give me pain to be obliged to shed the  
blood of a lellow creature in a private combat  
forbidden by the laws.  
2. My wife and children are extremely dear to  
me, and my life is of the utmost importance to  
theln, Hvriolls eWs,  
3. I feel a sense of obligation towards my  
creditors; who in case of accident to me, by the  
forced sale of my property, may be in some de-  
gree, suflerers. I did not think igself at libor  
as a man of probity, lightly to expose them to  
this hazard.  
t. I am conscious of no ill will to Col. Burr,  
distinct from political opposition, which, as I trust,  
has proceeded from pure and upright motives.  
Lastly, I shall hazard much, and can possibly  
gain nothing by the issue of the interview.  
But it was as I conceive, impossible for me to  
avoid it. There were intrinsic difficulties in the  
thing, and artificial embarrassments from the  
manner of proceeding on the part of Cola Burr.  
Intrinsic, because it is not to be deuied, that  
my animadversions on the political principles,  
character, and views of Cola Burr, have been  
extremely severe; and on different occasions, I,  
i common with many others, have made very  
unfavorable criticisms on particular instances of  
the private conduct of this gentleman.  
In proportion as these impressions were enter­  
tained with sincerity, and uttered with motives.  
and for purposes which might appear to me com-  
mendable, would be the difficulty (until they  
could be removed by evidenco of their being er­  
roneous,) of explanation or apology. The dis-  
avowal required of me by Col. Burr, in a general  
and indefinite form, was out of my power, if it  
had really been proper for me to submit to be so  
questioned; but I was sincerely of opinion that  
this could not be, and in this opinion, I was con­  
firmed by that of a very moderate and judicions  
friend whom I consulted. Pesides that Col. Burr  
appeared to me to assume, in the first instance, a  
tone unneces arily peremptory and menacing and  
in the second, positively offensive. Yet I wish­  
ed, as far as might be practicable, to leave a door  
open to accommodation. This, I think, will be  
inferred from the written communications made  
by me and by my direction, and would be cone  
firmed by the conversations between Mr. Van  
Ness and myself, which arose out of the subject.  
I am not sure whether, under all the circum  
stances I did not go further in the attempt to ac  
commedate than a punctilious delicacy will jus  
tify. If so, I hope the motives I have stated wil  
exclise ile.  
It is not my design, by what I have said, to  
affix any odium on the conduct of Cola Burr, in  
this case. He doubtless has heard of animad­  
versions of mine which bore very hard upon him:  
and it is probable that as usual they were accomn­  
panied with some falsehoods. He may have supe  
posed himself under a necessity of acting as he  
has done. I hope the ground of his proceedings  
have been such as ought to satisfy his own con­  
ecicnce.  at the same time, that the world wil io  
me the justice to be ive, that I have not censur  
him on light grounds, nbr from unworthy in­  
ducements. I certainly have had strong reasons  
for what I have said, though it is possible that in  
some particulars, I may have been influenced by  
misconstruction or misinformation. It is only  
my ardent wish that I may have been more mis-  
taken than I think I have been, and that he, by  
his future conduct may show himself worthy of  
all confidence and esteem, and prove an orna­  
ment and blessing to the country.  
as wel ecause if is possible that I may have  
iured col, narr however convinced myself  
that my opin ons and declarations have been well  
founded, as for my general principles and tem­  
per in relation to similar affairs, I have resolved  
if our interview is conducted in the usual man­  
ner, and it pleases tiod to give me the opportu­  
nity to reserre and throw away my first fire, and I  
hare thoughts even of reserring my second fire  
and thus giving a double opportunity to Col.  
Burr to pause and reflect.  
It is not, however, my intention to enter into  
any explanation on the ground, apology from  
prilictme, I lope, tatiief thal pride, is out of the  
question.  
To those who, with me, abhorring the practice  
of dueling, tray think that I ought on no account  
to have added to the number of bad examples,I  
anwer that ti ete sitaton as wel in pu­  
lic as private, enforeing all the considerations  
which constitute what men of the world denom­  
inate honor, imposed on me (as I thought) a pee
