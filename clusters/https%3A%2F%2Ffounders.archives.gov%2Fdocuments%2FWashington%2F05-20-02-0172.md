Philadelphia 5th June 1796.  
  
Since my last I have received your letters of the 22d &amp; 29th of last Month—The first came to hand on Tuesday, the other on Saturday, as usual.  
On Wednesday last Congress closed their Session; but there is yet a good deal for me to do, before I can leave the Seat of the Government. My present expectation however is, that I shall be able to do this on tomorrow week: but as this is not certain, and as I shall travel slow, to avoid what usually happens to me at this season—that is—killing, or knocking up a horse; and as  
  
we shall, moreover, stay a day or two at the Federal City, it is not likely we shall arrive at Mount Vernon before the 20th, or 21st of this month.  
In a few days after we get there, we shall be visited, I expect, by characters of distinction; I could wish therefore that the Gardens, Lawns, and every thing else in, and about the Houses, may be got in clean &amp; nice order. If the Gardener needs aid, to accomplish as much of this as lyes within his line, let him have it; &amp; let others rake, &amp; scrape up all the trash, of every sort &amp; kind about the houses, &amp; in holes &amp; corners and throw it (all I mean that will make dung) into the Stercorary and the rest into the gullied parts of the road, coming up to the House. And as the front gate of the Lawn (by the Ivies) is racked, and scarcely to be opened, I wish you would order a new one (like the old one) to be immediately made—and that, with the new ones you have just got made, and all the boarding of every kind that was white before, to be painted white again. If Neal and my own people cannot make the front gate, abovementioned, get some one from Alexandria to do it—provided he will set about &amp; finish it immediately. This must be the way up to the House.  
Let the Rooms in the Servants Hall, above &amp; below, be well cleaned; and have the Beds &amp; bedsteads therein put in order; after which have a good lock put on the door of the west room, above, and order Caroline, or whoever has the charge of those rooms, to suffer no person to sleep, or even to go in to it, without express orders from her Mistress or myself. Let exactly the same things be done with the Rooms over the Kitchen; as there will be a white Cook with us that will require one of them; and the other may also be wanted for some other Servants, or use—it being likely, there will be a call for all these places and things. And I hope, especially as there is no Ice to keep fresh meats, that you will have an abundant supply for the demands that will probably be made thereon during our stay at home. And besides, will ascertain from the Butcher in Alexandria, the stated days on which Beef and Veal are killed; that we may know what dependence to place on him—Tell the Gardener, I shall expect every thing that a Garden ought to produce, in the most ample manner.  
There may be many other things necessary to be done, as well for appearance as use, that do not occur to me at this momt but  
  
as you can judge from what I have said, what my wishes are, I have no doubt but that you will contribute all you can to accomplish them; and give the whole as neat &amp; clean an appearance as they are capable of.  
About the time you were employing a joiner to do the North end of the House, I directed Venetian blinds to be made, and painted green, for all the windows on the West side of the House, &amp; mentioned the manner in wch I thought it best to execute them: but have never been informed what, or whether any thing has been done in consequence of it. The omitting to give information of what has, or what cannot be done in consequen[ce] of such requests, often throws me into a disagreeable Suspence, and frequently occasions me to write often on the same subjects. I am equally ignorant whether the dormant windows are yet put into the stable, &amp; Corn lofts; both of which, for the purpose of Air, is indispensably necessary; besides adding to the appearance of the building.  
Take care to keep a sufficiency of Oats, and the best of your old Hay on hand. I shall have Eight or ten horses of my own with me, and there will be many others with visitors.  
You had better, I conceive, get the midlings and ship-stuff off your hands at what they will fetch; as the weather is getting warm, &amp; the flour may turn Sower. Unless you want the money for current expences, it might be sold on such a credit as to receive payment on the same day your demand upon Smith, for the other flour, will become due, so as to have the whole at once. This credit may enhance the price, and will be (if the money is not wanted for the purposes beforementioned) no disadvantage to me in giving it.  
I hope, at your last shearing, there was a complete cull, &amp; seperation of all the old, scabby &amp; disordered Sheep. I do not know how to account for the weekly loss you sustain, in this species of Stock, unless it be by keeping such poor and diseased sheep in the flocks as contaminate others.  
I have no doubt but that you will endeavor so to arrange matters, as to keep your grain, &amp; Hay harvests from interfering as much as possible with each other; and this too without either suffering, by standing too long, if it can possibly be avoided. Begin the former as soon as it can be cut without loss.  
  
If Miss Nelly Custis should apply to you for a Cart to Transport her Trunk and other things from Doctor Stuarts to Mount Vernon—let it be sent as soon as applied for, and something to cover and secure the contents against Rain—in case any should fall while they are on the Road.  
I perceive Mrs Washington’s Memm herewith sent contains nearly the same requests that are made in this letter—but I send it notwithstanding. I wish you well and am Your friend  
  
Go: Washington  
  
  
P.S. Direct your next letter to me, to be left at the Post Office in Baltimore till called for. If I set off according to my present expectation, I shall, probably lodge in that Town on thursday Night; which is the Night the Mail of that day from Alexandria reaches that place

Philadelphia 5&quot; June 1796.  
Mr. Pearce,  
  
Since my last I have received your letters of the 22¢ and  
29&quot; of last month.—The first came to hand on Tuesday, the  
other on Saturday, as usual.—  
  
On Wednesday last Congress closed their Session; but  
there is yet a good deal for me to do, before I can leave the  
Seat of the Government.—My present expectation however

knocking up a horse; and as we shall, moreover, stay a day  
or two at the Federal City, it is not likely we shall arrive at  
Mount Vernon before the 20%, or 21* of this month.—  
  
In a few days after we get there, we shall be visited, I ex-  
pect, by characters of distinction; I could wish therefore that  
the Gardens, Lawns, and every thing else, in, and about the  
Houses, may be got in clean and nice order.—If the Gardener  
needs aid, to accomplish as much of this as lyes within his  
line, let him have it; and let others rake, and scrape up all  
the trash, of every sort and kind about the houses, and in  
holes and corners, and throw it (all I mean that will make  
dung) into the Stercorary and the rest into the gullied parts  
of the road, coming up to the House.—And as the front gate  
of the Lawn (by the Ivies) is racked, and scarcely to be  
opened, I wish you would order a new one (like the old one)  
to be immediately made—and that, with the new ones you  
have just got made, and all the boarding of every kind that  
was white before, to be painted white again.--If Neal and  
my own people cannot make the front gate, above mentioned,  
get some one from Alexandria to do it—provided he will set  
about and finish it immediately.—This must be the way up  
to the Honse.—  
  
Let the Rooms in the Servants Hall, above and below, be  
well cleaned ; and have the Beds and bedsteads therein put  
in order; after which have a good lock put on the door of the  
west room, above, and order Caroline, or whoever has the  
charge of those rooms, to suffer no person to sleep, or even to  
go into it, without express orders from her Mistress or my-  
self.—Let exactly the same things be done with the Rooms  
over the Kitchen; as there will be a white Cook with us that  
will require one of them; and the other may also be wanted  
for some other Servants, or use. it being likely, there will be  
a call for all these places and things.—And I hope, especially  
as there is no Ice to keep fresh meats, that you will have an  
abundant supply for the demands that will probably be made

thereon during our stay at home.—And besides, will ascertain  
from the Butcher in Alexandria, the stated days on which  
Beef and Veal are killed, that we may know what dependence  
to place on him.—Tell the Gardener, I shall expect every-  
thing that a Garden ought to produce, in the most ample  
manner.—  
  
There may be many other things necessary to be done, as  
well for appearance as use, that do not occur to me at this  
mom* but as you can judge from what I have said, what my  
wishes are, I have no doubt but that you will contribute all  
you can to accomplish them ; and give the whole as neat, and  
clean an appearance as they are capable of.—  
  
About the time you were employing a Joiner to do the  
North end of the House, I directed Venetian blinds to be  
made, and painted green, for all the windows on the West  
side of the House; and mentioned the manner in w™ I  
thought it best to execute them :—but have never been in-  
formed what, or whether any thing has been done in conse-  
quence of it. The omitting to give information of what has,  
or what cannot be done in consequence of such requests, often  
throws me into a disagreeable suspence, and frequently occa-  
sions me to write often on the same subjects.—I am equally  
ignorant whether the dormant windows are yet put into the  
stable, and Corn lofts; both of which, for the purpose of Air,  
is indispensably necessary ; besides adding to the appearance  
of the building.—  
  
Take care to keep a sufficiency of Oats, and the best of  
your old Hay on hand. I shall have eight or ten horses of  
my own with me, and there will be many others with  
Visitors.—  
  
You had better, I conceive, get the Midlings and Ship-stuff  
off your hands at what they will fetch ; as the weather is get-  
ting warm, and the flour may turn Sower.—Unless you want  
the money for current expences, it might be sold on such a  
credit as to receive payment on the same day your demand  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
AND MOUNT VERNON. 255  
  
upon Smith, for the other flour, will become due: so as to  
have the whole at once.—This credit may enhance the price,  
and will be (if the money is not wanted for the purposes be-  
fore mentioned) no disadvantage to me in giving it.—  
  
I hope, at your last shearing, there was a complete cull, and  
seperation of all the old, scabby and disordered Sheep.—I do  
not know how to account for the weekly loss you sustain, in  
this species of Stock, unless it be by keeping such poor and  
diseased sheep in the flocks as contaminate others.—  
  
I have no doubt but that you will endeavor so to arrange  
matters, as to keep your grain, and Hay harvests from inter-  
fering as much as possible with each other; and this too with-  
out either suffering, by standing too long, if it can possibly be  
avoided.—Begin the former as soon as it can be cut without  
loss.—  
  
If Miss Nelly Custis’ should apply to you for a Cart to  
Transport her Trunk and other things from Doctor Stuarts  
to Mount Vernon—let it be sent as soon as applied for, and  
something to cover and secure the contents against Rain—in  
ease any should fall while they are on the Road.—  
  
I perceive Mrs. Washington’s Mem™ herewith sent contains  
nearly the same requests that are made in this letter—but I  
send it notwithstanding.—  
  
I wish you well and am  
Your friend  
G° Wasuineron.  
P.S.  
  
Direct your next letter to me, to be left at the Post Office  
in Baltimore till called for—If I set off according to my  
present expectation, I shall, probably lodge in that Town on
