re of Pacificus were lately published, which have been read with singular pleasure and applause, by the foreigners and degenerate citizens among us, who hate our republican government, and the French revolution; whilst the publication seems to have been too little regarded, or too much despised by the steady friends to both.  
Had the doctrines inculcated by the writer, with the natural consequences from them, been nakedly presented to the public, this treatment might have been proper. Their true character would then have struck every eye, and been rejected by the feelings of every heart. But they offer themselves to the reader in the dress of an elaborate dissertation; they are mingled with a few truths that may serve them as a passport to credulity; and they are introduced with professions of anxiety for the preservation of peace, for the welfare of the government, and for the respect due to the present head of the executive, that may prove a snare to patriotism.  
In these disguises they have appeared to claim the attention I propose to bestow on them; with a view to shew, from the publication itself, that under colour of vindicating an important public act, of a chief magistrate, who enjoys the confidence and love of his country, principles are advanced which strike at the vitals of its constitution, as well as at its honor and true interest.  
As it is not improbable that attempts may be made to apply insinuations which are seldom spared when particular purposes are to be answered, to the author of the ensuing observations, it may not be improper to premise, that he is a friend to the constitution, that he wishes for the preservation of peace, and that the present chief magistrate has not a fellow-citizen, who is penetrated with deeper respect for his merits, or feels a purer solicitude for his glory.  
This declaration is made with no view of courting a more favorable ear to what may be said than it deserves. The sole purpose of it is, to obviate imputations which might weaken the impressions of truth; and which are the more likely to be resorted to, in proportion as solid and fair arguments may be wanting.  
The substance of the first piece, sifted from its inconsistencies and its vague expressions, may be thrown into the following propositions:  
That the powers of declaring war and making treaties are, in their nature, executive powers:  
That being particularly vested by the constitution in other departments, they are to be considered as exceptions out of the general grant to the executive department:  
That being, as exceptions, to be construed strictly, the powers not strictly within them, remain with the executive:  
That the executive consequently, as the organ of intercourse with foreign nations, and the interpreter and executor of treaties, and the law of nations, is authorised, to expound all articles of treaties, those involving questions of war and peace, as well as others; to judge of the obligations of the United States to make war or not, under any casus federis or eventual operation of the contract, relating to war; and, to pronounce the state of things resulting from the obligations of the United States, as understood by the executive:  
That in particular the executive had authority to judge whether in the case of the mutual guaranty between the United States and France, the former were bound by it to engage in the war:  
That the executive has, in pursuance of that authority, decided that the United States are not bound: And,  
That its proclamation of the 22d of April last, is to be taken as the effect and expression of that decision.  
The basis of the reasoning is, we perceive, the extraordinary doctrine, that the powers of making war and treaties, are in their nature executive; and therefore comprehended in the general grant of executive power, where not specially and strictly excepted out of the grant.  
Let us examine this doctrine; and that we may avoid the possibility of mistating the writer, it shall be laid down in his own words: a precaution the more necessary, as scarce any thing else could outweigh the improbability, that so extravagant a tenet should be hazarded, at so early a day, in the face of the public.  
His words are—“Two of these (exceptions and qualifications to the executive powers) have been already noticed—the participation of the Senate in the appointment of officers, and the making of treaties. A third remains to be mentioned—the right of the legislature to declare war, and grant letters of marque and reprisal.”  
Again—“It deserves to be remarked, that as the participation of the Senate in the making treaties, and the power of the legislature to declare war, are exceptions out of the general executive power, vested in the President, they are to be construed strictly, and ought to be extended no farther than is essential to their execution.”  
If there be any countenance to these positions, it must be found either 1st, in the writers, of authority, on public law; or 2d, in the quality and operation of the powers to make war and treaties; or 3d, in the constitution of the United States.  
It would be of little use to enter far into the first source of information, not only because our own reason and our own constitution, are the best guides; but because a just analysis and discrimination of the powers of government, according to their executive, legislative and judiciary qualities are not to be expected in the works of the most received jurists, who wrote before a critical attention was paid to those objects, and with their eyes too much on monarchical governments, where all powers are confounded in the sovereignty of the prince. It will be found however, I believe, that all of them, particularly Wolfius, Burlamaqui and Vattel, speak of the powers to declare war, to conclude peace, and to form alliances, as among the highest acts of the sovereignty; of which the legislative power must at least be an integral and preeminent part.  
Writers, such as Locke and Montesquieu, who have discussed more particularly the principles of liberty and the structure of government, lie under the same disadvantage, of having written before these subjects were illuminated by the events and discussions which distinguish a very recent period. Both of them too are evidently warped by a regard to the particular government of England, to which one of them owed allegiance;  
  
The chapter on prerogative, shews how much the reason of the philosopher was clouded by the royalism of the Englishman.  
  
and the other professed an admiration bordering on idolatry. Montesquieu, however, has rather distinguished himself by enforcing the reasons and the importance of avoiding a confusion of the several powers of government, than by enumerating and defining the powers which belong to each particular class. And Locke, notwithstanding the early date of his work on civil government, and the example of his own government before his eyes, admits that the particular powers in question, which, after some of the writers on public law he calls federative, are really distinct from the executive, though almost always united with it, and hardly to be separated into distinct hands. Had he not lived under a monarchy, in which these powers were united; or had he written by the lamp which truth now presents to lawgivers, the last observation would probably never have dropt from his pen. But let us quit a field of research which is more likely to perplex than to decide, and bring the question to other tests of which it will be more easy to judge.  
2. If we consult for a moment, the nature and operation of the two powers to declare war and make treaties, it will be impossible not to see that they can never fall within a proper definition of executive powers. The natural province of the executive magistrate is to execute laws, as that of the legislature is to make laws. All his acts therefore, properly executive, must pre-suppose the existence of the laws to be executed. A treaty is not an execution of laws: it does not pre-suppose the existence of laws. It is, on the contrary, to have itself the force of a law, and to be carried into execution, like all other laws, by the executive magistrate. To say then that the power of making treaties which are confessedly laws, belongs naturally to the department which is to execute laws, is to say, that the executive department naturally includes a legislative power. In theory, this is an absurdity—in practice a tyranny.  
The power to declare war is subject to similar reasoning. A declaration that there shall be war, is not an execution of laws: it does not suppose pre-existing laws to be executed: it is not in any respect, an act merely executive. It is, on the contrary, one of the most deliberative acts that can be performed; and when performed, has the effect of repealing all the laws operating in a state of peace, so far as they are inconsistent with a state of war: and of enacting as a rule for the executive, a new code adapted to the relation between the society and its foreign enemy. In like manner a conclusion of peace annuls all the laws peculiar to a state of war, and revives the general laws incident to a state of peace.  
These remarks will be strengthened by adding that treaties, particularly treaties of peace, have sometimes the effect of changing not only the external laws of the society, but operate also on the internal code, which is purely municipal, and to which the legislative authority of the country is of itself competent and compleat.  
From this view of the subject it must be evident, that although the executive may be a convenient organ of preliminary communications with foreign governments, on the subjects of treaty or war; and the proper agent for carrying into execution the final determinations of the competent authority; yet it can have no pretensions from the nature of the powers in question compared with the nature of the executive trust, to that essential agency which gives validity to such determinations.  
It must be further evident that, if these powers be not in their nature purely legislative, they partake so much more of that, than of any other quality, that under a constitution leaving them to result to their most natural department, the legislature would be without a rival in its claim.  
Another important inference to be noted is, that the powers of making war and treaty being substantially of a legislative, not an executive nature, the rule of interpreting exceptions strictly, must narrow instead of enlarging executive pretensions on those subjects.  
3. It remains to be enquired whether there be any thing in the constitution itself which shews that the powers of making war and peace are considered as of an executive nature, and as comprehended within a general grant of executive power.  
It will not be pretended that this appears from any direct position to be found in the instrument.  
If it were deducible from any particular expressions it may be presumed that the publication would have saved us the trouble of the research.  
Does the doctrine then result from the actual distribution of powers among the several branches of the government? Or from any fair analogy between the powers of war and treaty and the enumerated powers vested in the executive alone?  
Let us examine.  
In the general distribution of powers, we find that of declaring war expressly vested in the Congress, where every other legislative power is declared to be vested, and without any other qualification than what is common to every other legislative act. The constitutional idea of this power would seem then clearly to be, that it is of a legislative and not an executive nature.  
This conclusion becomes irresistible, when it is recollected, that the constitution cannot be supposed to have placed either any power legislative in its nature, entirely among executive powers, or any power executive in its nature, entirely among legislative powers, without charging the constitution, with that kind of intermixture and consolidation of different powers, which would violate a fundamental principle in the organization of free governments. If it were not unnecessary to enlarge on this topic here, it could be shewn, that the constitution was originally vindicated, and has been constantly expounded, with a disavowal of any such intermixture.  
The power of treaties is vested jointly in the President and in the Senate, which is a branch of the legislature. From this arrangement merely, there can be no inference that would necessarily exclude the power from the executive class: since the senate is joined with the President in another power, that of appointing to offices, which as far as relate to executive offices at least, is considered as of an executive nature. Yet on the other hand, there are sufficient indications that the power of treaties is regarded by the constitution as materially different from mere executive power, and as having more affinity to the legislative than to the executive character.  
One circumstance indicating this, is the constitutional regulation under which the senate give their consent in the case of treaties. In all other cases the consent of the body is expressed by a majority of voices. In this particular case, a concurrence of two thirds at least is made necessary, as a substitute or compensation for the other branch of the legislature, which on certain occasions, could not be conveniently a party to the transaction.  
But the conclusive circumstance is, that treaties when formed according to the constitutional mode, are confessedly to have the force and operation of laws, and are to be a rule for the courts in controversies between man and man, as much as any other laws. They are even emphatically declared by the constitution to be “the supreme law of the land.”  
So far the argument from the constitution is precisely in opposition to the doctrine. As little will be gained in its favour from a comparison of the two powers, with those particularly vested in the President alone.  
As there are but few it will be most satisfactory to review them one by one.  
“The President shall be commander in chief of the army and navy of the United States, and of the militia when called into the actual service of the United States.”  
There can be no relation worth examining between this power and the general power of making treaties. And instead of being analogous to the power of declaring war, it affords a striking illustration of the incompatibility of the two powers in the same hands. Those who are to conduct a war cannot in the nature of things, be proper or safe judges, whether a war ought to be commenced, continued, or concluded. They are barred from the latter functions by a great principle in free government, analogous to that which separates the sword from the purse, or the power of executing from the power of enacting laws.  
“He may require the opinion in writing of the principal officers in each of the executive departments upon any subject relating to the duties of their respective offices; and he shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offences against the United States, except in case of impeachment.” These powers can have nothing to do with the subject.  
“The President shall have power to fill up vacancies that may happen during the recess of the senate, by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of the next session.” The same remark is applicable to this power, as also to that of “receiving ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls.” The particular use attempted to be made of this last power will be considered in another place.

 to the power of making treaties and war, that is, of determining what the laws shall be with regard to other nations? No other certainly than what subsists between the powers of executing and enacting laws; no other consequently, than what forbids a coalition of the powers in the same department.  
I pass over the few other specified functions assigned to the President, such as that of convening of the legislature, &amp;c. &amp;c. which cannot be drawn into the present question.  
It may be proper however to take notice of the power of removal from office, which appears to have been adjudged to the President by the laws establishing the executive departments; and which the writer has endeavoured to press into his service. To justify any favourable inference from this case, it must be shewn, that the powers of war and treaties are of a kindred nature to the power of removal, or at least are equally within a grant of executive power. Nothing of this sort has been attempted, nor probably will be attempted. Nothing can in truth be clearer, than that no analogy, or shade of analogy, can be traced between a power in the supreme officer responsible for the faithful execution of the laws, to displace a subaltern officer employed in the execution of the laws; and a power to make treaties, and to declare war, such as these have been found to be in their nature, their operation, and their consequences.  
Thus it appears that by whatever standard we try this doctrine, it must be condemned as no less vicious in theory than it would be dangerous in practice. It is countenanced neither by the writers on law; nor by the nature of the powers themselves; nor by any general arrangements or particular expressions, or plausible analogies, to be found in the constitution.  
Whence then can the writer have borrowed it?  
There is but one answer to this question.  
The power of making treaties and the power of declaring war, are royal prerogatives in the British government, and are accordingly treated as Executive prerogatives by British commentators.  
We shall be the more confirmed in the necessity of this solution of the problem, by looking back to the æra of the constitution, and satisfying ourselves that the writer could not have been misled by the doctrines maintained by our own commentators on our own government. That I may not ramble beyond prescribed limits, I shall content myself with an extract from a work which entered into a systematic explanation and defence of the constitution, and to which there has frequently been ascribed some influence in conciliating the public assent to the government in the form proposed. Three circumstances conspire in giving weight to this cotemporary exposition. It was made at a time when no application to persons or measures could bias: The opinion given was not transiently mentioned, but formally and critically elucidated: It related to a point in the constitution which must consequently have been viewed as of importance in the public mind. The passage relates to the power of making treaties; that of declaring war, being arranged with such obvious propriety among the legislative powers, as to be passed over without particular discussion.  
“Tho’ several writers on the subject of government place that power (of making treaties) in the class of Executive authorities, yet this is evidently an arbitrary disposition. For if we attend carefully, to its operation, it will be found to partake more of the legislative than of the executive character, though it does not seem strictly to fall within the definition of either of them. The essence of the legislative authority, is to enact laws; or in other words, to prescribe rules for the regulation of the society. While the execution of the laws and the employment of the common strength, either for this purpose, or for the common defence, seem to comprize all the functions of the Executive magistrate. The power of making treaties is plainly neither the one nor the other. It relates neither to the execution of the subsisting laws, nor to the enaction of new ones, and still less to an exertion of the common strength. Its objects are contracts with foreign nations, which have the force of law, but derive it from the obligations of good faith. They are not rules prescribed by the sovereign to the subject, but agreements between sovereign and sovereign. The power in question seems therefore to form a distinct department, and to belong properly neither to the legislative nor to the executive. The qualities elsewhere detailed as indispensable in the management of foreign negotiations, point out the executive as the most fit agent in those transactions: whils

The basis of the reasoning :s, we perceive,  
the exttaordinary do&amp;rine, that the powers j  
of making war and treaties, are in their na- |

in the general grant of executive power,

our owil reason and our own conttitu­

egiflative and judiciary qualities are not to  
&gt;e expected in the works of the most receiv­  
ed jurffts, who wrote before a critical atten­  
;ion was paid to rhofe objects, and with their  
eyes too much 00 mooarehical governments,  
vhere all.powe/s are confounded in the fovc­  
eignty of the prince. It will be found how­  
ever, I belive, that ajj of them, particularly  
W.olfius Burlamaqui and Vattel,fpeak of the  
lowers to declare war, to conclude peace, and  
10 form alliances, as among the highest a&amp;s  
)f tie sovereignty ; of which the legislative  
&gt;ower must at least be an integral and pre­  
eminent part.  
Writers,fuchas Locke and Montesquieu, who  
lave difcufled more particularly the principles  
if liberty and the ftru&lt;sture of government, lie  
under the fame difadvantagc, of having writ­  
ten before these fubje&amp;s were illuminated by  
the events and discussions which diftinguifli a  
very recent period. Both of thein too are  
evidently warped by a regard to the par­  
ticular government of England, to which one  
of them owed allegiance; * and the other pro­  
feijed an admiration bordering on idolatry.  
Montesquieu, however, has ratherdiftingui/h­  
---ed himfelf by enforcing the reasons and the  
importance of avoiding a confufion of the  
several powers of government, than by enu­  
merating and defining the powers which be­  
long to each particular class. And Locke,  
notwithstanding the early date of his work 011.  
civil government, and the example of his  
own government before his eyes, admits that  
the particular powers in queflion, which, af­  
ter some of the writers on public law he calls  
federative, are really dijiinQ from the executive,  
though alinoft always united with it, and  
hardly to be feperated into dijlinft hands,. Had he  
not lived under a monarchy, in which thele  
powers were united ; or had he written by  
the lamp which truth now patents to law­  
givers, the last observation wbuld probably  
never have dropt from his pen. But letusqmt  
a field of research which is more likely to per­  
plex than to decide, and bring the question to  
other tests of which it will be more easy to  
jud^e.  
2. If we confidt for a moment, the nature  
and operation of the two powers to declare  
war and make treaties it will be itnpoffible  
not to fee that they can never fall within a  
proper definition of executive powers. The  
natural province of the executive mag&#x27;fttate  
is to execute laws, «is that of the legislature  
is to make laws. All his atts therefore, pro­  
perly executive, must pre-fuppofe the exig­  
ence of the Jaws to be executed. A treaty is  
not an execution of laws : it does not pre­  
suppose the exifient e of Uws. It is, on the  
contrary, to have itfelf the force of a law,  
and to he carricd into exuulioty like all other

/aw.r9 by the executive magi-jf?&gt; To fay then  
that t&#x27;»e power of making treaties which are  
confefledly law*, belongs naturally to the de­  
partment which is toe.xecute law-?, is to Fay,  
that the executive department naturally in­  
cludes a legiflativc power. In theory, tiais is  
an absurdity—in practice a tyranny.  
  
The power to declare war is fuhjeft so si­  
milar reasoning. A dfcclaratidn that there  
fliall be war, is nor an execution of* laws : it  
does not fuppofc pre-existing laws to be exe­  
cuted : it is not in anv refpeft, an a&amp; merely  
executive. It is, on the contrary, one of the  
moil deliberativea£ts that can be performed ;  
and when performed, has the etfeft of re­  
pealing all the law? operating in a ft Ate of  
peace, so far as they are inconsistent with a  
state of war : and of enabling as a rule for the  
executive, a netvcode adapted to the relation be­  
tween the society and its foreign enemy. In  
like manner a conelufion of peace annuls all  
the latui peculiar to a state of war, and revives  
the general laws incident to a state of peace.  
These remarks will be fireiVgthened by ad­  
ding that treaties, particularly treaties ot  
peaee, have fofae times the efife&lt;sl of Changing  
nor only the external laws of the fociery, but  
operate alto on t)»e internal code, which is  
purely municipal, and tQ which the legislative  
authority of the country is of* itfe&#x27;f compe­  
tent and com pleat.  
From this view of the fubjeft it mnft be  
evident, that although the executive may be  
a convenient organ of preliminary commu­  
nications with foreign governments, on the  
fubje&amp;s of treaty or war ; and the proper  
agent for carrying into execution the final  
determinations of the competent authority ;  
yet it can have no pre ten (tons from the nature  
of the powers in question compared wirh the  
nature of the executive rruft, to that eflen­  
tiaJ agency which gives validity to such de­  
terminarions.  
  
It must be further evident that, if these  
powers be not iti their nature purely legisla­  
tive, they partake so much more of that, than  
of any other quality, that under a confHtu­  
tion leaving then) to r.cfult to their oiott na­  
tural department, the legiflatuie would be  
without a rival in its cl-aint.

Mk. Fenno,  
  
Please to give a place in yoTtr Ca?ttlc to the fpf(ow­  
i//g observations. Ttt /&#x27;&gt;inters who tuay have re­

Number 1.  
  
\Conchtded) from our last.]  
ANOTHER important inference to be no  
ted i*, that the powers of making war and  
treaty being fub&amp;mtVify of a Utgiflative, not  
an executive nature, the rule of interpreting.-ex­  
ceptions fttiiftly, muft&gt; narrow inftehd. of en­  
larging executive pretentions on those fuhje&amp;s,.  
3, It remains to tye enquired whether there  
In? any thing in the constitution irfelf which  
fl&#x27;.ews that the ot makiug war and peace  
are confidsretf as of an executive nature, and  
s*s comprehended within a&lt;general grant of exe*  
C utive power.  
  
Ic will not be-pretended that this appears from  
any dircß petition to be found in the inftruntent.  
If it were dcJucitle from any particular ex­  
p reffious it may be prefumusd that the pubHca­  
ti on would have saved us the trouble of the re­  
i&#x27;t ;arch.  
  
Docs the do4lrtne then tefult from the a An­  
al distribution of powers aniaug the fcveral  
branches of the government ? Or from any fair  
ai lalogy between the powers of war and treaty  
ajad the enumerated powers veiled in execu­  
te iVe alone ?  
  
Let us examine.  
  
In the general diftrihution of powers, we  
f ipd that of declaring war expr«£sly veiled in&#x27;  
Ihe Congress, where every other legislative  
j &gt;ower is declared to be veiled, and without any  
other qualification than what is common to ev­  
{••ry other legislative a&amp;. The constitutional  
idea of this power would seem then- clearly to  
fctt, that it-isol a legiilative and not an exec ac­  
tive nature.  
  
This&#x27; cbncluGon become* irrrfiftable, when  
Jl: is recollecfted, that the contention cannot be  
si jppofed to hive placed either any power legi­  
j) ative ill its nature, entirely among executive  
j .owers, or anypower executive in its nature,  
« nriieiy among legiflativepowers, without char­  
-5 &#x27;Uijj the constitution, with that kind of inter­  
mixture and eotnfoiidation of different powers,  
vhich Would viola.&#x27;a a fundamental principle in  
the organization of free governments, If it  
i vere not unnecessary to enlarge on this topic  
I lere, it could be (hewn, that the constitution  
1 vas originally vindicated, and has been con­  
-1 iaatly expounded, with a dUavowal of any fucb  
1 nrerniixture.  
The power ol treaties is vefled jointly in  
I he Prelidcnt and *. the Senate, which is a  
(branch of the legifl&#x27;tire, From this arran£e­  
jmcnt merely, there Ncan be no inference that  
1 votild ceceffintfp «;:cl*dje the power from the  
i xzcutjre cl»fs i liuce t!se filiate i» joined with  
J&#x27;ttcPi fi&#x27;li it in another wower, that of appoint­  
ing to offices, which as far as relate to exetu­  
ti ve offices at ieart, is considered as of au exe-  
Ci .tive natiire. . Yet on the other hand, there  
it t fufficicnt indications thtit the power of trea­  
ties w regarded by the constitution as jiiateriat­  
ly different ii winners «xacu.tL»e power, and as  
viqg more affinity to the legislative than to  
t&quot;( . executive charactcr.  
  
Onecircumftance indScatiug this, lsthe&#x27;con­  
fllttitional regulation under which the fen-ate  
I ive their .content in the cafe of treaties. In  
a il other clrfe* the eo»*fent of the tyody is exprcf­  
i;&lt;l by a majority of vuicci. In this particular  
c ale&#x27;,&#x27; a c incurrence of two thirds at least is  
s vide insceflary, as a substitute or compensation  
the other branch of the tagiflature, which  
on certain occasions, codlJ not be conveniently  
a party to the tram£i&amp;ion.  
But the coiuciufivfe tinea raftaziee is, that trea­  
ties according to the eonftitirtion­  
4it mode, ;ire coufeflcdly to have the force and  
•operation of laivsy and are to be a rule for the  
courts ui controyeifics between man and man,  
as much as anv othe- laivs. They are even em­  
phatically declared by the constitution to be  
gt the foprcflTic law of the land.&#x27;*  
So far tht; argument from the constitution is  
precifeiy in oppoQtitm to the dosrine. As lit­  
tle will be gamed in its favour fropi a compa­  
rison of the two powers,with those particular­  
ly veiled in the President alone.  
  
As there are bat few it wifl tie most fatisfac­  
tnry to review them one by one.  
  
4t The President shall be commander in chief  
of the army and navy of the United States,  
an»d of the militia when called into the a&amp;ual  
lcrvice of the United States.&quot;  
  
There can he no relation worth examining  
between this power and the general power of  
makiijg treaties. .&#x27;And instead of being analo­  
gou«to the power of declaring war, it affords  
a striking i!luft?atien of the incompat bility of  
the two powers in the fame hands. Those who  
are to a irar cannot in the nature of  
be proper or fate judges., *vhe her a

be considered in anotnerpla.ee. It will not fail to be remarked on this com­  
&quot;He (hall take care that the laws shall be mentary, that whatever doubts may be darted  
faithfully executed and (liall commiflion all ofii- as to the correAnefs of its realigning against th«  
cers of the Unjted States.&quot; To fee the laws legiflarive nature of the power to make treaties:  
faithfully executed constitutes the effente of, the it is dcttr xrmftjltnt and confident, in deciding that  
executive (authority. But what, relation has it the power is plainly and evidently not an execu­  
to the power of making treaties and war, that live foioer. HHiyVIDIUS.  
is, of determining what the laivs jhull be with — , , „  
r;gard t,O other nations? No other certainly  
th.m what subsists between the powers of exe­  
cuting and enadfcing laws ; no other, conse­  
quently, than what foftuds a coalition of the  
poweis ill the lame department.  
  
I the few other fpecifieji fundb&#x27;ons  
a Signed-to the Prciident, such as that of, con­  
vening of the liigiftUtu&#x27;e, &amp;c. &amp;c. which cannot  
be drawn into the present question.  
It may lie proper however to take notice of  
the power of removal from office, which ap­  
pears to have been adjudged to the President by  
the lawseftabliftring the executive departments;  
and which the- writer has endeavoured to press  
intohis fcrvice. To jufciiy favourabij in­  
feregce from this cafe, it must be (hewn, that  
the powers of war and treaties are of a kin­  
dreds nature to the power of removal, or at  
least are equally within ,a grant of executive  
power. Nothing of this fort has been attemp­  
ted, nor probably will be attempted. Nothing  
can in truth be. clearer,, than that no analogy,  
or shade of analogy, can be traced4&gt;etwccn a  
power in the iupreme officer responsible for the  
faithful execution of the laws, to displace a fiib­  
altera officer employed in the execution of the  
laws; and a power to make treaties, and to de­  
clare war, such as these Aave been foundto be in  
their nature, their operation, and their conse­  
quences. /  
Thus it appears that by whatever standard we  
.try this do&amp;rine, it mull be condemned is no  
less vicious in theory than it would be dange­  
rous io pra&amp;ice. his countenanced neither by  
the writers on law; nor by the nature of the  
powers themfelyes ; nor by any general arrang­  
n.ents or exprefli on 6, orplaufible a­  
nalogies, to be found in the conilitution.  
Whence then can the writer have borrowed  
it ?  
  
There is but one answer ta this question.  
The power of making treaties and the pow­  
er of deflating war, are royal prerogatives in the  
Britijh govit&#x27;nmenti and are accordingly treated  
a.3 Executant prerogatives by Britijh comjrcntators  
We shall be the more confirmed in the neces­  
sity of this solution of the problem, by looking  
back to the aera of the confbtutiea, an«i Satisfy­  
ing ourjwlves that the writer could not have been  
milled by the do&amp;rines maintained by our own  
commentators on our own government. That  
I may not ramble beyond prescribed limits, I  
ihall content myfelf with an extra&lt;sl from a  
work which entered into a systematic explana­  
tion and defence of the constitution, and to  
which frequently been a fori bed some*  
influence iii conoiliaxing the public affant to the  
government in form proposed. Three cir­  
ciiqaftancen conspire in giving weight to this co­  
temporary e&amp;p/6fition. It was made at a time  
when no application to persons or measures could  
btas: The opinion given was not transiently  
mentioned, but formally and critically elucidat­  
ed : It related to a point in the constitution  
which must consequently have been viewed as  
of importance in the public mind. The paflage  
relates to the power of making treari«s ; that  
of declaring war, being arranged with fwch ob­  
vious propriety among the legillative powers,  
as tobepaffed over without particular difcufiion.  
&quot; Tho* ftveral writers on the fub&gt;jc&amp; of govern­  
&quot; ment place that power sos making treaties Jin  
the class of Executive authorities, yet this is  
&#x27;• evidently an arbitrary dijpojttioti. For ifweat­  
*i tend carefully, to its operation, it wiil be  
&quot; found to partake more of the leg&#x27;Jlative than  
&quot; of the executive chafer, though it does not  
« feemftri&amp;ly to fall within the definition of  
&quot; either of them. The eifence of the legisla­  
tive authority, is to ena&amp; laws; or iti other  
u words, to prescribe rules for the regulation  
u of the society. While the execution of the  
u laws and the enaoloyment of the common  
&quot; strength, either for this purpose, or for the  
* common defence, feent to comprize all she  
&quot; fun&amp;ions of the Executive magi/irate. The  
&quot; power of making treaties is plainly neither  
&quot; the one nor the other. It relates neither to  
&quot; the execution of the subsisting laws, nor to
