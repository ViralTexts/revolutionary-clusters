The Address of the Senate to the President of the United States in answer to his speech to both Houses of Congress—  
  
Sir,  
In Senate May 16th. 1789  
  
We the Senate of the United States, return you our sincere thanks for your excellent speech delivered to both Houses of Congress; congratulate you on the compleat organization of the federal Government, and felicitate ourselves and our fellow-citizens on your elevation to the Office of President: an Office highly important by the Powers constitutionally annexed to it and extremely honorable from the manner in which the appointment is made. The unanimous suffrage of the elective Body in your favor is peculiarly expressive of the Gratitude, Confidence and affection of the Citizens of America and is the highest Testimonial at once of your Merit and of their Esteem. We are sensible, Sir, that nothing but the voice of your fellow Citizens could have called you from a retreat, chosen with the fondest predilection, endeared by habit, and consecrated to the repose of declining years. We rejoice and with us all America that in obedience to the call of our common Country, you have returned once more to public life. In you all parties confide; in you all interests unite; and we have no doubt that your past services, great as they have been, will be equalled by your future exertions; and that your prudence and sagacity as a Statesman will tend to avert the Dangers to which we were exposed, to give stability to the present Government and Dignity and splendor to that country, which your skill and valour as a Soldier, so eminently contributed to raise to Independence and Empire—  
  
When we contemplate the coincidence of circumstances, and wonderful combination of causes, which gradually prepared the people of this Country for Independence; when we contemplate the rise, progress, and termination of the late War, which gave them a name among the nations of the Earth, we are with you unavoidably led to acknowledge and adore the great Arbiter of the Universe, by whom Empires rise and fall. A review of the many signal Instances of divine interposition in favour of this country claims our most pious gratitude: and permit us, Sir, to observe that among the great events, which have led to the formation and establishment of a Federal Government, we esteem your acceptance of the Office of President as one of the most propitious and important—  
In the execution of the trust reposed in us, we shall endeavour to pursue that enlarged and liberal policy, to which your Speech so happily directs— We are conscious that the prosperity of each State is inseparably connected with the wellfare of all and that in promoting the latter, we shall effectually advance the former. In full persuasion of this Truth it shall be our invariable Aim to divest ourselves of local prejudices and attachments and to view the great assemblage of Communities and interests committed to our charge with an equal Eye. We feel, Sir, the force and acknowledge the justness of the observation that the foundation of our National Policy should be laid in private Morality; if Individuals be not influenced by moral principles, it is in vain to look for public Virtue; it is, therefore, the Duty of Legislators to enforce both by precept and example the Utility as well as the Necessity of a strict adherence to the Rules of distributive justice. We beg you to be assured that the Senate will at all times cheerfully co-operate in every measure, which may strengthen the Union, conduce to the Happiness, or secure and perpetuate the Liberties of this great confederated Republic.  
We commend you, Sir, to the protection of Almighty God, earnestly beseeching him long to preserve a Life so valuable and dear to the people of the United States, and that your administration may be prosperous to the nation and glorious to yourself—  
  
Signed by orderJohn Adams President of the Senate of the United States

The ApprEss of the Senate  
to the President of the U­  
nited States, in answer to  
his Speech to both Houses  
of CONGRESS.  
SIR,  
‘ N J E the Senate of the  
United States, return  
you our sincere thanks for  
your excellent Speech deliver­  
ed to both houfesof Congress ;  
congratulate you on the com­  
plete organjzation of the Fe­  
deral Government, and ftelici­  
tate ourselves, and our fellow­  
citizens on your elevation to  
the office ot President—an of­  
fice, highly important by the  
powers constitutionally annex­  
ed to it, and extremely honor­  
able from the mannerinwhich  
theappointmentismade. The  
unanimous fuffrage of theclec­  
tive body in your favor, is pe­  
culiarly expreflive of the gra­  
titude, confidence and aftec­  
tion, of the citizens of Ameri­  
ca, and is the highest testimo­  
nial at once ot yourmerit, and  
of their esteem. We are sen­  
sible, Sir, that nothing butthe  
voice of your fellow-citizens,  
could have called you from a  
retreat, chosen with thefondeft  
Eredile&amp;ion, endeared by ha­  
it, and consecrated to the re­  
pose of declining years; we  
rejoice, and with us, all Ame­  
rica, that, in obedience to the  
call of our common country,  
you have returned once more  
to public life. In you all par­  
ties confide, inyouallintevefts  
unite, and we have no doubt,  
that your paftfervices, great as  
they havebeen, will be equal­  
led by your future exertions ;  
and that your prudence and  
sagacity as a Statesman will  
tend to avert the dangers to  
which we were exposed, to  
give stability to the present  
government, and dignity and  
splendor to that eountry,which  
your {kill and valor as a Sol­  
dier, so eminently contributed  
to raise to independence and  
empire.  
  
THURSDAY, May2B, 1789.  
  
When we contemplate the  
coincidence of circumitances,  
and wonderful combination of  
causes, which gradually pre­  
pired the people of this coun­  
try for independence, when  
we contemplate the rife, pro­  
gress and termination of the  
late war, which gave them a  
name amony the nations of the  
earth, we are with you, una­  
voidably led, to acknowledge  
and adore the great Arbiter of  
theuniverfe, by whom empires  
rifec and fall. A review ofthe  
many signal inftancesofdivine  
interposition in favor of this  
country claims our most pious  
gratitude. And permit us,  
Sir, to observe, thatamong the  
great events which huve led  
to the formation and ettablifh­  
ment ofaFederal Government,  
we eltcem your acceptance of  
the office of President as one  
of the most propitious and im­  
portant.  
In the execution ofthe trust  
reposed in us, we shall endea­  
vour to pursue that enlarged  
and liberal policy, to which  
your {peech so happily directs.  
We are conscious that the  
prosperity of each State is in­  
separably connected with the  
welfare of all,and that in pro­  
moting the latter, we shall ef­  
fectually advance the former.  
Infu!l purfuafion of this truth,  
it shall be our invariable aim,  
to divest ourselves of local  
prejudices and atrachments,  
and to view the great aflem­  
blage of communities and in­  
terests committed to our  
charge with an equal eye. We  
feel, Sir, the force, and ac­  
knowlcdge the justness of the  
observation, that the founda­  
tion of our national policy  
should be laid in private mo­  
rality. If individuals be not  
influenced by moral princi­  
ples, it is in vain&#x27;to look for  
public virtue ; it is, therefore,  
the duty of Legislators to en­  
force, both by precept and ex­  
ample, the utility as well as  
the neceflity of a strict adhe­  
rence to the rules of distribu­  
tive jultice. We beg you to  
be aflured, that the Senate  
will at all times cheerfully  
co-operate in cvery measure,  
which may {trengthen the  
Union, conduce to the happi­  
nels, or Tecure and perpetiite  
the liberties of this great Con­  
federated Republic: -
