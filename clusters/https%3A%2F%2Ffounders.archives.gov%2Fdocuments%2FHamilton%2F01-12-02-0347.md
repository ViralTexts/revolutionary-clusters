For the Gazette of the United States.  
Aristides complains that the American has charged Mr. Jefferson with being the patron and promoter of national disunion, national insignificance, public disorder and discredit. The American however, has only affirmed, that “the real or pretended political tenets of that gentleman tend” to those points.  
The facts which have been established clearly demonstrate, that in the form in which it is made, the charge is well founded.  
If Mr. Jefferson’s opposition to the funding system, to the bank, and to the other measures which are connected with the administration of the national finances had ceased, when those measures had received the sanction of law; nothing more could have been said, than, that he had transgressed the rules of official decorum, in entering the lists against the head of another department (between whom and himself, there was a reciprocal duty to cultivate harmony) that he had been culpable in pursuing a line of conduct, which was calculated to sow the seeds of discord in the executive branch of the government, in the infancy of its existence.  
But when his opposition extended beyond that point; when it was apparent, that he wished to render odious, and of course to subvert (for in a popular government these are convertible terms) all those deliberate and solemn acts of the legislature, which had become the pillars of the public credit, his conduct deserved to be regarded with a still severer eye.  
Whatever differences of opinion may have preceded those acts—however exceptionable particular features in them may have appeared to certain characters, there is no enlightened nor discreet citizen but must agree, that they ought now to remain undisturbed. To set afloat the funding system, after the faith of the nation had been so deliberately and solemnly pledged to it—after such numerous and extensive alienations of property for full value have been made under its sanction—with adequate revenues, little burthensome to the people—in a time of profound peace  
  
The partial Indian hostilities which exist, can hardly be deemed an interruption of the general peace.  
  
—with not even the shadow of any public necessity—on no better ground than that of theoretical and paradoxical dogmas—would be one of the most wanton and flagitious acts, that ever stained the annals of a civilized nation.  
  
Yet positions tending to that disgraceful result have been maintained in public discourses, by individuals known to be devoted to the Secretary of State; and have been privately smiled upon as profound discoveries in political science.  
Yet the less discreet, though not least important partizans of that officer, talk familiarly of undoing the funding system as a meritorious work: Yet his Gazette (which may fairly be regarded as the mirror of his views) after having labored for months to make it an object of popular detestation, has at length told us in plain and triumphant terms, that “the funding system has had its day;” and very clearly, if not expressly, that it is the object of the party to overthrow it.  
The American, then, has justly, and from sufficient data, inferred, that Mr. Jefferson’s politics, whatever may be the motives of them tend to national disunion, insignificance, disorder and discredit. That the subversion of the funding system would produce national discredit, proves itself. Loss of credit, the reason being the same, must attend nations, as well as individuals who voluntarily and without necessity, violate their formal and positive engagements.  
Insignificance and disorder, as applied to communities, equally with individuals, are the natural offspring of a loss of credit, premeditatedly and voluntarily incurred.  
Disunion would not long lag behind. Sober-minded and virtuous men in every State would lose all confidence in, and all respect for a government, which had betrayed so much levity and inconsistency, so profligate a disregard to the rights of property, and to the obligations of good faith. Their support would of course be so far withdrawn or relaxed, as to leave it an easy prey to its enemies. These comprize the advocates for separate confederacies; the jealous partizans of unlimited sovereignty, in the State governments—the never to be satiated lovers of innovation and change—the tribe of pretended philosophers, but real fabricators of chimeras and paradoxes—the Catalines and the Cæsars of the community (a description of men to be found in every republic) who leading the dance to the tune of liberty without law, endeavor to intoxicate the people with delicious but poisonous draughts to render them the easier victims of their rapacious ambition; the vicious and the fanatical of every class who are ever found the willing or the deluded followers of those seducing and treacherous leaders.  
But this is not all—the invasion of sixty millions of property could not be perpetrated without violent concussions. The States, whose citizens, both as original creditors and purchasers own the largest portions of the debt (and several such there are) would not remain long bound in the trammels of a party which had so grossly violated their rights. The consequences in experiment would quickly awaken to a sense of injured right, and interest such of them, whose representatives may have wickedly embarked, or been ignorantly betrayed into the atrocious and destructive project.  
Where would all this end but in disunion and anarchy? in national disgrace and humiliation?

spersions on men, who as long as actions, not merely professions, shall be the true test of patriotism and integrity need never decline a comparison with him of their titles to the public esteem,” and he is supported in the assertion by facts.  
Not to cite or trace those foul and pestilent whispers, which clandestinely circulating through the country, have, as far as was practicable, contaminated some of its fairest and worthiest characters, an appeal to known circumstances will justify the charge.  
Some time since, there appeared in print certain speculations, which have been construed into an advocation of hereditary distinctions in government. These (whether with, or without foundation, is to this moment matter of conjecture) were ascribed to a particular character—pre-eminent for his early, intrepid, faithful, presevering and comprehensively useful services to his country—a man pure and unspotted in private life, a citizen having a high and solid title to the esteem, the gratitude and the confidence of his fellow-citizens.  
The first volume of the “Rights of man” makes its appearance—The opportunity is eagerly seized, to answer the double purpose of wounding a competitor and of laying in an additional stock of popularity; by associating and circulating the name of Thomas Jefferson, with a popular production of a favorite writer, on a favorite subject.  
For this purpose the Secretary of State sits down and pens an epistle to a printer in the city of Philadelphia, transmitting the work for republication, and expressing his approbation of it in a way, which we learn, from the preface of that printer to his edition of the work, was calculated not only to do justice to the writings of Mr. Paine, but to do honor to Mr. Jefferson; by directing the mind to a contemplation of that republican firmness and democratic simplicity, which ought to endear him to every friend to the “Rights of Man.”  
The letter, as we learn from the same preface, contained the following passages: “I am extremely pleased to find it will be reprinted here, and that something is at length to be publicly said against the political heresies, which have sprung up among us. I have no doubt our citizens will rally a second time round the standard of common sense.”  
There was not a man in the United States, acquainted with the insinuations, which had been propagated, who did not instantly apply the remark—and the signal was so well understood by the partizans of the writer, that a general attack immediately commenced. The newspapers in different States resounded with invective and scurrility against the patriot, who was marked out as the object of persecution, and if possible of degradation.  
Under certain circumstances general expressions designate a person or an object as clearly as an indication of it by name. So it happened in the present case. The Javelin went directly to its destination.  
But it was quickly perceived, that discerning and respectable men disapproved the step. It was of consequence to endeavor to maintain their good opinion. Protestations, and excuses as frivolous as awkward were multiplied to veil the real design.  
“The gentleman alluded to, never once entered into the mind! It was never imagined, that the printer would be so incautious as to publish the letter or any part of it—nothing more was in view than to turn a handsome period, and to avoid the baldness of a note that did nothing but present the compliments of the writer!”  
Thus a solemn invocation to the people of America, on the most serious and important subject, dwindled at once into a brilliant conceit, that tickled the imagination too much to be resisted. The imputation of levity was preferred to that of malice.  
But when the people of America presented themselves to the disturbed patriotic fancy, as a routed host, scattered and dispersed by political sorcerers; how was it possible to resist the heroic, the chivalrous desire, of erecting for them some magic standard of orthodoxy, and endeavoring to rally them round it, for mutual protection and safety.  
In so glorious a cause, the considerations—that a citizen of the United States had written in a foreign country a book containing strictures on the government of that country, which would be regarded by it, as libellous and seditious—that he had dedicated this book to the chief magistrate of the union—that a republication of it under the auspices of the Secretary of State, would wear the appearance of its having been promoted, at least of its being patronized by the government of this country—were considerations too light and un-important to occasion a moment’s hesitation or pause.  
Those who, after an attentive review of circumstances, can be deceived by the artifices, which have been employed to varnish over this very exceptionable proceeding must understand little of human nature—must be little read in the history of those arts, which in all countries, and at all times have served to disguise the machinations of factious and intriguing men.  
The remaining circumstance of public notoriety, which fixes upon Mr. Jefferson the imputation of being the prompter, or instigator of detraction, exists in his patronage of the National Gazette.  
Can any attentive reader of that Gazette doubt, for a moment, that it has been systematically devoted to the calumniating and blackening of public characters? Can it be a question, that a main object of the paper is to destroy the public confidence in a particular public character, who it seems is to be hunted down at all events, for the unpardonable sin of having been the steady, invariable and decided friend of broad national principles of government? Can it be a question, that the persecution of the officer alluded to, is agreeable to the views of the institutor of the paper?  
Does all this proceed from motives purely disinterested and patriotic? Can none of a different complexion be imagined, that may at least have operated to give a stimulous to

FOR THE GAZETTE OF THE UNITED STATED.  
  
ARISTIDES complaSns.that the AmekicXw  
has charged Mr. Jejferfon with being the  
patron and promoter ot national dif union, national  
irjignificance, public dijordcr and dijcrcdit. The  
American however, has oniy alarmed, that  
&quot; the rpal or pretended political tenets of that  
gentleman Una&quot; to those points. j  
  
The facts which have been established e&#x27;ear­  
lv demonftiate, that in the form in which it is  
made, the charge is well founded.  
  
If Mr. jeffertbn&#x27;s opposition to the funding!  
fyltem, to tjie bank, and to the other meafurcs  
which are connected with the adminiftjjitjqn of  
the national finances had ceased, when thole  
measures had received the fanftion of law ; no­  
thing more cou&#x27;d have been laid, than, that he  
had tranfgrefled the rules of official decorum,  
in entering the lifts against the head of another  
department (between whom and himfelf, there  
was a reciprocal duty to cultivate harmony)  
that he had been culpable in pursuing a line of  
conduct, which was calculated to Tow tke feeds  
of discord in the executive branch of the go­  
vernment, in the infaricy of its existence.  
  
But when his opposition extended beyond  
that point; when it was apparent, that he wish­  
ed to render odims, and of course to subvert (for  
in a popular government these are convertible  
terms) all those deliberate and folenin arts of  
the legislature, which had become the pillars of  
the public credit, his conduct deserved to be re­  
garded with a still severer eye.  
  
Whatever differences of opinion may have  
preceded those a&lt;sts—however exceptionable  
particular features in them may have appeared  
to certain characters, there is no enlightened  
nor discreet citizen but must agree, that they  
ought now to remain uvdijiurbed, To set afloat  
the funding system, after the faith of the nation  
has been so deliberately and solemnly pledged to  
it—after such numerous and extensive aliena­  
tions of property for full value have been made  
under its fan (stion—with adequate revenues,  
littleburthenfome to the people—in a time of  
profound peace*—with not even the shadow of  
any public neceflity—on no better ground than  
that of theoretical and paradoxical dogmas­  
would be one of the most wanton and flagitious  
arts, that ever stained the annals of a civilized  
nation.  
  
Yet positions tending to that (jifgraceful re­  
sult have been maintained in public discourses,  
by individuals known to be devoted to the Se­  
cretary of State ; and have been privately  
smiled upon as profound discoveries in political  
science.  
  
&quot;\et the less discreet, though not least impor­  
tant partizans of that officer, talk familiarly of  
undoing the funding system as a meritorious  
work : Yet his Gazette (which may fairly be  
regarded as the mirror ol his views) after hav­  
ing labored for months to make it an object of  
popular detestation, has at length told us in  
plain and triumphant terms, that &quot;the funding  
fvftcm has had its day and very clearly, if  
not expressly, that it is the object of the party  
to overthrow it.  
  
The American, then, has iuftly, and from  
fufficient data, inferred, that Mr. Jefferfon&#x27;s  
politics, whatever may be the motives of them,  
tend to national disunion, infignificance, difor­  
er and discredit. That the fubverlion of the  
tunding system would producenationaldifcredit,  
proves itfelf. Loss of credit, the reason being  
.® ra,me&#x27; mu(l attend nations, as well as indi­  
viduals who voluntarily and without neceflity  
violate their formal and poiitive engagements.  
  
Infignificance and disorder, as applied to com­  
mumties, equally with individuals, are the na­  
tural offspring of a loss of credit, premeditated­  
ly and voluntarily incurred.  
  
Disunion would not long lag behind. Sober­  
minded and virtuous men in every State would  
all confidence in, and all lefnect for a go­  
vernment, which had betrayed so much levity  
and mconftancy, so profligate a disregard to the  
&#x27;tfto oj property, and to the obligations of good  
* Their support would of course be so far  
withdrawn or relaxed, as to leave it an easy  
prey to its enemies. These comprize the ad­  
vocates for separate confederacies; the jea­  
lous partizans of unlimited sovereignty, in the  
;tate governments—the never to be satiated  
lovers of innovation and change—the tribe of  
pretended philosophers, but real fabricators of  
chimeras and paradoxes—the Catalines and  
the Casfars of the community (a delcription of  
men to be found in every republic) who leading  
the dance to the tune of liberty without law,  
endeavor to intoxicate the people with delicious  
but poisonous draughts to render them theeafier  
victims of their rapacious ambition : the vi­  
cious and the fanatical of every class who are  
A^e&#x27; rllr ,the wi,linE or the deluded followers

the country, have, as far as was frra&amp;icable,  
contaminated some of its faireft and worthiefi  
characters, an appeal to known circunfftances  
will juftify the charge.  
Some time since, there appeared in print cer­  
tain speculations, which have been construed  
into an advocation of hereditary diftinftions in  
government. These (whether with, or without  
foundation, is to this moment matter of con­  
jeaure) were ascribed to a particular charac­  
ter—pre-eminent for his early, intrepid, faith­  
ful, peri&#x27;evering and comprehensively tileful ser­  
vices to his country—a man pure and unspot­  
ted in private life, a citizen having a high and  
solid title to the esteem, the gratitude and the  
confidence of his fellow-citizens.  
The firft volume of the &quot; Rights of man&quot;  
makes its appearance—The opportunity is ea­  
gerly seized, to answer the double purpose of  
wounding a competitor, and of laying in an ad­  
ditional stock of popularity ; by alTociating and  
circulating the name of Thomas Jefferfon, with  
a popular production of a favorite writer, on a  
favorite fubjeft.  
For this purpose the Secretary of State fits  
down and pens an epistle to a printer in the city  
of Philadelphia, transmitting the work for re­  
publication, and exprefling his approbation of it  
  
in a way, which we learn, from the preface of  
that printer to his edition of the work, was cal­  
culated not only to do justice to the writings of  
Mr. Paine, but to do honor to Mr. Jefferfon ;  
iy diufling the mind to a contemplation of that  
republican jirmnefs and democratic jimplicit)l, which  
ought to endear him to every friend to the  
&quot; Rights of Man.&quot;  
  
The letter, as we learn from the fame pre­  
face, contained the following passages : u I am  
extremeiy pleased to find it will be reprinted  
here, and that something is at length to be pub­  
licly said against the political which have  
Iprnng up among us.&quot; I have no doubt our ci­  
tizens will rally a second time round the Jlandard  
of common sense.&quot;  
  
There was not a man in the United States,  
acquainted with the insinuations, which had  
been propagated, who did not instantly apply  
the remark—and the signal was so well under­  
stood by the partizans of the writer, that a ge­  
neral attack immediately commenced. The  
newspapers in different States resounded with  
  
inventive and scurrility against the patriot, who  
was marked out as the object of persecution,  
and if poflible of degradation.  
Under certain circumstances general expres­  
sions designate a person or an object as clearly  
as an indication of it by name. So it happened  
in the prelent cafe. The Javelin went direct­  
ly to its destination.  
  
But it was quickly perceived, that discerning  
and refpeftable men disapproved the step. It  
was of consequence to endeavor to maintain  
their good opinion.—Protestations, and excuses  
as frivolous as awkward were multiplied to veil  
the real design.  
  
u The gentleman alluded to, never once en­  
tered into the mind ! It was never imagined,  
that the printer would be so incautious as to  
publifli the letter or any part of it—nothing  
more was in view than to turn a handsome pe­  
riod, and avoid the baldnejs of a note that did  
nothing but present the compliments of the  
writer !&quot;  
  
Thus a solemn invocation to the people of  
America, on the mod serious and important  
iubject, dwindled at once into a brilliant con­  
ceit, that tickled the imagination too much to  
be refilled. The imputation of levity was pre­  
ferred to that of malice.  
  
| But when the people of America prcfented  
themselves to the disturbed patriotic fancy, as  
a routed host, scattered and dispersed by politi­  
cal sorcerers ; how was it polTible to refill the  
hcroic, the chivalrous desire, of ere&amp;ing for  
them some magic standard of orthodoxy, and  
endeavoring to rally them round it, for mutual  
protection and fafety.  
  
In so glorious a cause, the considerations—  
that a citizen of the United States had written  
in a foreign country a book containing stric­  
tures on the government of that country, which  
would be regarded by it, as libellous and iedi­  
tious—that he had dedicated this book to the  
chief magistrate of the union—that a republi­  
cation ot it under the auspices of the Secretary  
of State, would wear the appearance of its  
having been promoted, at least of its being pa­  
tronized by the government of this country—  
were considerations too light and unimportant  
to occasion a moment&#x27;s hesitation or pause.  
I hose who, after an attentive review of cir­  
cumstances, can be deceived by the artifices,  
which have been employed to varnifli over this  
very exceptionable proceeding mull: undenland  
little of human nature must be little read  
in the history of those arts, which in all coun­  
tries, and at all times have served to disguise  
the machinations of fa&lt;ftious and intriguing  
  
The remaining circumstance of public noto­  
riety, which fixes upon Mr. Jefferfon the im­  
putation of being the prompter, or inftigatorof  
detraction, exists in his patronage of the Na­  
tiona] Gazette.  
  
Can any attentive reader of that Gazette  
doubt, for a moment, that it has been fyftema­  
ticallv devoted to the calumniating and black­  
ening of public characters ? Can it be a qtieftion,,  
that a main object of the paper is to deltroy  
the public confidence in a particular public cha­  
racter, who it Teems is to be hunted down at all  
j°r the unpardonab]e fin of having been  
the Iteady,invariable and decidedfriend of broad  
national principles cf government? Can it be  
a question, that the persecution of the officer al.  
-tided to, is agreeable to the views of the initi­  
tutor of the paper &gt;  
Does all this proceed from motives purely

It Mr. Jed 1 Ton&#x27;s opposition to the measures  
which are scfloeaed with the admißiftration cf the the  
  
, national finanrri had ceased, when those measures  
had received the f»nsion of haw, nothing more  
• could have been said, than, that he had trarrfg.ef­  
fed the rales ef official decorum, in entering the  
lifts against the head of another department (be­  
, tween whom and himfelf, there was a reciprocal  
duty ta cultivate harmony) that he had beta culpa­  
ble in pursuing a line of conduct, which wascaleu  
lated to sow the feeds of discord in the executive  
branch of the government in the infancy of its e»-  
s&#x27; ijlence.  
But when his opposition extended beyond that  
v point, when it was apparent, that he withed to  
render ediout and of course to fubntrl (for in a po­  
pular government these are eonvertible terms) all  
rhofe deliberate and solemn a&amp;s of the legislature,  
which had become the pillars of the public credit,  
his conriudt deserved to be regarded with a still se­  
verer eye.  
What differences of opinion may have preceded  
those exceptionable particular sea-&lt;  
turcs in them may have appeared to certain cha  
rafters, there is no enlightened nor discreet citizen  
but must agref, that they ought when clothed with  
the fanftion of the law to remain undijlurbed. To  
set afloat the funding system, after she faith as the 1  
nation bid been so deliberately and solemnly pledged &#x27;  
to it—after such numerous and extensive alienations 1  
of property for full value had been even made un &#x27;  
- der its fan&amp;ion—with adequate revenues, little &#x27;  
burthenfotne to the people—in a time of profound &#x27;  
peace—with not even the Jhadow of a»y public  
* necejjity—on no better graund than that of theorem &#x27;  
tical and paradoxical dogmas—would have been &#x27;  
one of the most wanton and flagitious eSs, that c  
ever flained the annals of a civilized nation. &#x27;  
Yet positions tending to that difgiaceful result r  
were maintained in public discourses, by individuals, }  
known to be devoted to the then secretary of state,  
and were privately smiled upon, as profound disco- 1  
veries in political science. F  
Yet the 1 rf» discreet, though not lead important 1  
&#x27; parthans of that officer, spake familiarly of undoing &#x27;  
the funding fyfl-.m, as a meritorious work : Yet bis  
gazette ( which may fairly be regarded as the mirror r  
of his views) after having labored for months to i 1  
make it an object of public deteftstion, told us at 1!  
■ length, in plain and triumphant terms, that &quot; the  
f funding system had had its day and very clearly,  
1 if not expressly, that it was the objeS oj the party  
t ta overthrow it*.&quot;  
e It may be justly then, and from fuffiiient data,  
- inferred, that Mr. Jefferfon&#x27;s politics, wiile secre­  
tary of date, tend to national disunion, injgnijicance, &gt;•  
- disorder and discredit. That the fubverion of the  
finding system would have produced mtional dif- a  
• credit, proves itfelf. Loss of credit, the -eafon be- b  
: ing the fame, mud attend natianj, as wallas indi- C(  
• vidualj, who voluntarily and without nec:ffity, vi- 0  
- &#x27;date their formal and positive engagements f,  
Injignificancc and disorder, as applied tccpmmu- w  
- nities, equally with individuals, are the natural off it  
t spring of a loss of Credit, premeditately and Wunta- g  
1 rily incurred.   
» Dlswrnaw would not long lag behind. Sober- r(  
minded and virhwus men, in every Rate, wotid lose k  
: all confidence in, and all refpeft for a govenment, tl  
J which had betrayed so much levity and inainfiftl  
ency, It) pref.igate a disregard to the rights of pro- *  
• perty, and to the obligations of good faith. Their&#x27; a]  
. support would of course be so far withdrawa or re- r&lt;
