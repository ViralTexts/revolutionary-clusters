In the Course of this Winter appeared a Phenomenon in Philadelphia a Star of Disaster (Disastrous Meteor), I mean Thomas Paine. He came from England, and got into such company as would converse with him, and ran about picking up what Information he could, concerning our Affairs, and finding the great Question was concerning Independence, he gleaned from those he saw the common place Arguments concerning Independence: such as the Necessity of Independence, at some time or other, the peculiar fitness at this time: the Justice of it: the Provocation to it: the necessity of it: our Ability to maintain it &amp;c. &amp;c. Dr. Rush put him upon Writing on the Subject, furnished him with the Arguments which had been urged in Congress an hundred times, and gave him his title of common Sense. In the latter part of Winter, or early in the Spring he came out, with his Pamphlet. The Arguments in favour of Independence I liked very well: but one third of the Book was filled with Arguments from the old Testiment, to prove the Unlawfulness of Monarchy, and another Third, in planning a form of Government, for the seperate States in One Assembly, and for the United States, in a Congress. His Arguments from the old Testiment, were ridiculous, but whether they proceeded from honest Ignorance, or foolish Superstition on one hand, or from will-full Sophistry and knavish Hypocricy on the other I know not. The other third part relative to a form of Government I considered as flowing from simple Ignorance, and a mere desire to please the democratic Party in Philadelphia, at whose head were Mr. Matlock, Mr. Cannon and Dr. Young. I regretted however, to see so foolish a plan recommended to the People of the United States, who were all waiting only for the Countenance of Congress, to institute their State Governments. I dreaded the Effect so popular a pamphlet might have, among the People, and determined to do all in my Power, to counter Act the Effect of it. My continued Occupations in Congress, allowed me no time to write any thing of any Length: but I found moments to write a small pamphlet which Mr. Richard Henry Lee, to whom I shewed it, liked so well that he insisted on my permitting him to publish it: He accordingly got Mr. Dunlap to print it, under the Tittle of Thoughts on Government in a Letter from a Gentleman to his Friend. Common Sense was published without a Name: and I thought it best to suppress my name too: but as common Sense when it first appeared was generally by the public ascribed to me or Mr. Samuel Adams, I soon regretted that my name did not appear. Afterward I had a new Edition of it printed with my name and the name of Mr. Wythe of Virginia to whom the Letter was at first intended to have been addressed. The Gentlemen of New York availed themselves of the Ideas in this Morsell in the formation of the Constitution of that State. And Mr. Lee sent it to the Convention of Virginia when they met to form their Government and it went to North Carolina, New Jersey and other States. Matlock, Cannon, Young and Paine had influence enough however, to get their plan adopted in substance in Georgia and Vermont as well as Pennsilvania. These three States have since found them, such Systems of Anarchy, if that Expression is not a contradiction in terms, that they have altered them and made them more conformable to my plan.—Paine soon after the Appearance of my Pamphlet hurried away to my Lodgings and spent an Evening with me. His Business was to reprehend me for publishing my Pamphlet. Said he was afraid it would do hurt, and that it was repugnant to the plan he had proposed in his Common Sense. I told him it was true it was repugnant and for that reason, I had written it and consented to the publication of it: for I was as much afraid of his Work as he was of mine. His plan was so democratical, without any restraint or even an Attempt at any Equilibrium or Counterpoise, that it must produce confusion and every Evil Work. I told him further, that his Reasoning from the Old Testament was ridiculous, and I could hardly think him sincere. At this he laughed, and said he had taken his Ideas in that part from Milton: and then expressed a Contempt of the Old Testament and indeed of the Bible at large, which surprized me. He saw that I did not relish this, and soon check’d himself, with these Words “However I have some thoughts of publishing my Thoughts on Religion, but I believe it will be best to postpone it, to the latter part of Life.” This Conversation passed in good humour, without any harshness on either Side: but I perceived in him a conceit of himself, and a daring Impudence, which have been developed more and more to this day.... The third part of Common Sense which relates wholly to the Question of Independence, was clearly written and contained a tollerable Summary of the Arguments which I had been repeating again and again in Congress for nine months. But I am bold to say there is not a Fact nor a Reason stated in it, which had not been frequently urged in Congress. The Temper and Wishes of the People, supplied every thing at that time: and the Phrases, suitable for an Emigrant from New Gate, or one who had chiefly associated with such Company, such as “The Royal Brute of England,” “The Blood upon his Soul,” and a few others of equal delicacy, had as much Weight with the People as his Arguments. It has been a general Opinion, that this Pamphlet was of great Importance in the Revolution. I doubted it at the time and have doubted it to this day. It probably converted some to the Doctrine of Independence, and gave others an Excuse for declaring in favour of it. But these would all have followed Congress, with Zeal: and on the other hand it excited many Writers against it, particularly plain Truth, who contributed very largely to fortify and inflame the Party against Independence, and finally lost us the Allens, Penns, and many other Persons of Weight in the Community. Notwithstanding these doubts I felt myself obliged to Paine for the Pains he had taken and for his good Intentions to serve Us which I then had no doubt of. I saw he had a capacity and a ready Pen, and understanding he was poor and destitute, I thought We might put him into some Employment, where he might be usefull and earn a Living. Congress appointed a Committee of foreign affairs not long after and they wanted a Clerk. I nominated Thomas Paine, supposing him a ready Writer and an industrious Man. Dr. Witherspoon the President of New Jersey Colledge and then a Delegate from that State rose and objected to it, with an Earnestness that surprized me. The Dr. said he would give his reasons; he knew the Man and his Communications: When he first came over, he was on the other Side and had written pieces against the American Cause: that he had afterwards been employed by his Friend Robert Aitkin, and finding the Tide of Popularity run pretty strong rapidly, he had turned about: that he was very intemperate and could not write untill he had quickened his Thoughts with large draughts of Rum and Water: that he was in short a bad Character and not fit to be placed in such a Situation.— General Roberdeau spoke in his favour: no one confirmed Wither-spoons Account, though the truth of it has since been sufficiently established. Congress appointed him: but he was soon obnoxious by his Manners, and dismissed.  
There was one Circumstance, in his conversation with me about the pamphlets, which I could not Account for. He was extreamly earnest to convince me, that common Sense was his first born: declared again and again that he had never written a Line nor a Word that had been printed before Common Sense. I cared nothing for this but said nothing: but Dr. Witherspoons Account of his Writing against Us, brought doubts into my mind of his Veracity, which the subsequent histories of his Writings and publications in England when he was in the Custom house, did not remove.  
  
At this day it would be ridiculous to ask any questions about Tom Paines Veracity, Integrity or any other Virtue.

In the course of this winter, 1774, appeared a  
phenomenon in Philadelphia—a disastrous me-  
teor—I mean Thomas Paine. He came from Eng.  
land and got into such company as would converse  
with him, and ran about picking up what infor-  
mation he could concerning our affairs, and find-  
ing the great question was concerning indepen-  
dence, he gleaned from those he saw the com-  
mon-place arguments, such as the necessity of  
independence at some time or other; the justice  
of it; the provocation to it; our ability to main-  
tain it, &amp;c., &amp;e. Dr. Rush put him upon writ-  
ing on the subject, furnished him with the argu-  
ments which had been urged in Congress ahun-  
dred times, and gave him his title of “Common  
Sense.” In the latter part of winter, or early  
spring, he came out with his pamphlet. The  
arguments in favour of independence I liked very  
well; but one third part of the book was filled  
with arguments, from the Old Testament, to  
prove the unlawfulness of monarchy, and ano-  
er third in planning a form of government for  
the separate states in one Assembly, and for the  
United States in a Congress. His arguments  
from the Old Testament were ridiculous, but  
whether they proceeded from honest ignorance  
or foolish superstition on one hand, or from wilful  
sophistry and knavish hypocrisy on the other, I  
know not. , The other third part, relative to 4  
form of government, I considered as flowing from  
simple ignorance, and a mere desire to please the  
democratic party in Philadelphia. I regretted,  
however, to see so foolish a plan recommended  
to the people of the United States, who were all

er to counteract the effect of it. My continual  
occupations in Congress allowed me no time to  
write anything of any length; but T found mo-  
ments to write a small pamphlet, which Mr. Rich-  
ard Henry Lee, to whom showed it, liked 80  
well, that he insisted on my permitting him to  
publish it. He accordingly got Mr. Dunlap to  
print it, under the title of “* Thoughts on govern-  
ment, in a letter from a gentleman to his friend.”  
Common Sense was published without a name,  
and J thought it best to suppress my name too.  
But as Common Sense, when it first appeared,  
was generally by the public ascribed to me or Mr.  
Samuel Adams, I soon regretted that my name  
did not appear.  
  
Afterwards I had a new edition printed, with  
my name and the name of Mr. Wythe, of Me,  
nia, to whom the letter was at first intended to  
addressed. The gentlemen of New York availed  
themselves of the ideas in this morsel in the for-  
  
mation of the constitution of that state. And  
  
Mr. Lee sent it to the convention of Virginia,  
when they met to form their government, and it  
went to North Carolina, New Jersey, and other  
states. Those who united with Paine had influ-  
ence enough, however, to get their plan adopted  
in substance in Georgia and Vermont, as well  
as Pennsylvania. These three states have since  
found them such systems of anarchy, if that ex-  
pression is not a contradiction in terms, that they  
have altered them and made them more con-  
formable to my plan.  
  
Paine soon after the appearance of my pam-  
phlet, hurried away to my lodgingsand spent an  
evening with me. His business was to repre-  
hend me for publishing my pamphlet; said he  
was afraid it would do burt, and that it was re-  
pugnant to the plan he had propos.d in his Com-  
mon Sense.  
  
I told him it was true it was repugnant, and for  
that reason I had written it and consented to the  
publication of it ; for I was as much afraid of  
his work as he was of mine. His plan was so  
demoeratical, without any restraints, or even an  
attempt at any equilibrium or counterpoise, that  
it must produce confusion and every evil work.  
] told him further, that his reasoning from the  
Old Testament was ridiculous, and I could hard-  
ly think him sincere. At this he laughed, and  
said he had taken his ideas in that part from

Old Testament, and indeed of the Bible at large,  
which surprised me. He saw that ! did not relish  
this, and soon checked himself with these words,  
“ However, I have some thoughts of publishing  
my thoughts on religion, but I believe it will be  
best to postpone it to the latter part of my life.”  
This conversation passed in good humour, with-  
out any harshness on either side ; but I perceived  
in him a conceit of himself and a daring impu-

independence, was clearly written, and contained  
a tolerable summary of the arguments which I  
had been repeating again and again in Congress  
for nine months. But I am bold to say that  
there is not a fact nor a reason stated in it,  
which had not been frequently urged in Congress.  
  
The temper and wishes of the people supplied  
every thing at that time, and the phrases  
suitable for an emigrant from Newgate, or one  
who had chiefly associated with such company,  
had as much weight with the people as his argu-

pamphlet was of great importance inthe Revolu-

ed it to this day. It probably converted some  
to the doctrine of independence, and gave others  
an excuse for declaring in favor of it. But these

felt myself obliged to Paine for the pains he had  
  
taken, and for his good intentions to serve us,  
  
which I then had uo doubt of. I saw he had a  
capacity and a ready pen, and understanding he

useful, and earn a living. Congress appointed  
a Committee of Foreign Affairs, not long after,  
and they wanted a clerk. I nominated Thomas  
Paine, supposing him a ready writer, and an in-  
dustrious man.  
  
Dr. Witherspoon, the President of the New  
Jersey College, and then a delegate from that  
state, rose and objected to it with an earnestness  
that surprised me. The doctor said he would  
give his reasons; he knew the man and bis com-

which I could not account for. He was extreme-

John Adams says: “Congress appointed a —_  
mittee of foreign affairs not long after, and they  
wanteda clerk. I nominated Thomas Paine, sup-  
agg Soe a ready writer and an industrious man.  
  
r. Witherspeon, the President of New Jersey  
college, rose and objected to it with an earnest-

he said, he had written pieces against the Ameri-  
can cause. He was in short a bad character, and  
not fit to be placed in any  
spoke in his favor. Congress appointed him, bat  
he was soon obnoxious by his manners, and dis-  
missed.”
