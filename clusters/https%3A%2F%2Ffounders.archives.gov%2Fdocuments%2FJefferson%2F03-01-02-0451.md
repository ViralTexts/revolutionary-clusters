this there was no law, nor consequently any authority for

be exercised by such petty means. We had no suspi¢ ion that he «€ xpec ted  
to engage men here, but merely to purchase military stores. Against this  
there was no law, nor consequently any authority for us to interpose ob-  
stacles. On the other hand, we deemed it improper to betray his volun  
  
tary communication to the agents of Spain. Although his measures were  
many days in preparation at New York, we never had the least intimation  
or suspicion of his engaging men in his enterprise, until he was gone ; and  
| presume the secrecy of his proceeding kept them equally unknown to  
the Marquis Yrujo at Philadelphia and the Spanish consul at New York,  
since neither of them gave us any information of the enlistment of men,  
until it was too late for any measures taken at Washington to prevent their  
departure Che officer in the Customs, who participated in this transac  
  
tion with Miranda, we immediately removed, and should have had him  
and others further pun shed, had it not been for the protec tion given them  
by private citizens at New York, in opposition to the government, who  
  
by their impudent falsehoods and calumnies were able to overbear the  
  
I  
  
minds of the jurors.’
