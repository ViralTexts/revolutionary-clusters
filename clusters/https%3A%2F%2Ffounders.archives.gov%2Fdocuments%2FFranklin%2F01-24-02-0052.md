We submit it to your Consideration whether it might not be well to employ some of your Frigates in bringing your produce hither, ordering them after refreshing and refitting to make a Cruise in the Northern Seas upon the Baltic and Hamborough Trade send their prizes home North about, then return to France and take in a Loading of Stores for America.  
The Marquis de Fayette a young Nobleman of great Family Connections here, and great Wealth, is gone to America in a Ship of his own, accompanied by some Officers of Distinction, in order to serve in our Armies. He is exceedingly beloved, and every bodys good wishes attend him. We cannot but hope he may meet with such a Reception as will make the Country and his Expedition agreeable to him. Those who censure it as imprudent in him do never the less applaud his Spirit; and we are satisfy’d that the Civilities and Respect that may be shown him will be serviceable to our Affairs here, as pleasing not only to his powerfull Relations and to the Court, but to the whole French Nation. He has left a beautifull young Wife big with Child: and for her sake particularly we hope that his Bravery and ardent Desire to distinguish himself will be a little restrain’d by the Generals prudence, so as not to permit his are very respec
