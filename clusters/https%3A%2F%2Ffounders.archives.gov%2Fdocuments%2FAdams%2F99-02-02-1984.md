1 The Senate of the United States request you to accept their acknowledgments for the comprehensive and interesting detail you have given, in your Speech to both Houses of Congress, on the existing state of the Union.  
2d While we regret the necessity of the present meeting of the Legislature, we wish to express our entire approbation of your conduct in convening it, on this momentous occasion.  
3d. The superintendance of our national faith, honor and dignity, being, in a great measure constitutionally deposited with the Executive, we observe with singular satisfaction, the vigilance, firmness and promptitude exhibited by you, in this critical state of our public affairs, and from thence derive an evidence and pledge of the rectitude and integrity of your administration. And we are sensible, it is an object of primary importance, that each branch of the Government should adopt a language and system of conduct, which shall be cool, just and dispassionate; but firm, explicit and decided.  
4th We are equally desirous, with you, to preserve peace and friendship with all nations, and are happy to be informed, that neither the honour or interests of the United States forbid advances for securing those desirable objects, by amicable negociation, with the French Republic—This method of adjusting national differences, is not only the most mild, but the most rational and humane, and with Governments disposed to be just, can seldom fail of success, when fairly, candidly and sincerely used. If we have committed errors, and can be made sensible of them, we agree with you, in opinion, that we ought to correct them, and compensate the injuries, which may have been consequent thereon, and we trust the French Republic will be actuated by the same just and benevolent principles of national policy.  
5th. We do therefore most sincerely approve of your determination to promote and accelerate an accommodation of our existing differences with that Republic by negociation, on terms compatible with the rights, duties, interests and honour of our nation. And you may rest assured of our most cordial co-operation so far as it may become necessary, in this pursuit.  
6th. Peace and harmony with all nations is our sincere wish; but such being the lot of humanity that nations will not always reciprocate peaceable disposions: it is our firm belief that, effectual measures of defence, will tend to inspire that national self respect and confidence at home, which is the unfailing source of respectability abroad, to check aggression, and prevent war.  
7th While we are endeavoring to adjust our differences with the French Republic by amicable negociation, the progress of the war in Europe, the depredations on our Commerce, the personal injuries to our Citizens and the general complexion of affairs, prove to us your vigilant care, in recommending to our attention effectual measures of defence.

THE Senate of the United States re-  
quett &#x27;you to accept their aclcnowledg-  
HK-nts for the comprthenuve and iutereit-  
ing detail you have given iu your Speech  
to both Houles ot Congieis, on the  
exilling (late of the union.  
  
Wliile we regret the nectftity of the  
prefeijt meeting of the Legillaturc, we  
v. ilh to cxprel’s our entire appr&#x27;)hauon of  
your condurt, in convening it on this  
momentous occalion.  
  
I&#x27;he Ibpci intcndance of our National  
Faith, liunour, and Dignity, being in a  
great mealure conllitutionally depofittd  
with the l^xecutive Authority, we ob-  
lei ve with fingular fatlsfairllon the fum-  
ncls and promptitude exhibited by you,  
in this critical ftate of our public aftairs,  
and liom thence derive an evidence and  
pledge of the ie«!:Utude and integrity of  
your Adminiftration—And we are I’cn-  
fible It is an objeil of primary import¬  
ance, that each branch ot the Government  
fliould adopt a language and fyllein of  
conduit, which fliallbe cool, juft, anddif-  
panionateibuthim, explicit, and decided.  
  
We are equally delirous with you to  
preferve peace and frieiuirnip wdih all  
Nations, and are happy to be informed,  
that neither the honour nor intcreftot the  
United States forbid advances forlicurlng  
thele deniable objects, by an ainicable  
Negotiation with the French Republic.  
  
&#x27;I&#x27;his method of adjulting National  
diiTerenccs is not only the molt mild, but  
the moft rational and humane j and with  
a Government dilpaied to be juft, can  
  
feldoin fall of fuccefs, when fairly, can¬  
didly, and linccrcly exercifed. If we  
have committed errors, and can be iiiadc  
lenlible of them^ w&#x27;c agree with you in  
opinion, that we ought to corrcil them,  
and compentate lor the injuries which  
may have been conicquent thereon j and  
we trull the French Republic will be  
ai^tuated by the lame jult and benevolent  
piinciplcs of National policy.  
  
We do tlierefore molt ftnccrcly approve  
of your determination to promote and  
accelerate an accommodation of our  
exilling dlft&#x27;erenccs with that Republic  
by Negotiation, on terms compatible  
with the rights, duties, interefts, :u:d  
honour of our Nation ; and you may reft  
allured of our molt cordial co-operation.  
To hit as it may become necelfary In this  
puifuit.  
  
Pcaceand hamionywlth all Nations is  
our fmcere wilh ; but I&#x27;uch being* tlic lot  
Cl humanity, that Nations will not al¬  
ways reciprocate peaceful dilpolitions, it  
l^s oui Him beliv&#x27;i, that effectual meafuics  
of detcnce will tend to inlpirc that Na¬  
tional felf-delence and conHdence at home,  
which is the unfailing fource of relj&gt;c61-  
abllity abroad, to check aggreftron, and  
leptl war.  
  
Whiill we are endeavouring to adjiift  
our dift&#x27;erences with the French Republic  
by amicable Negotiation, the progrels of  
the War in Europe, the depredations on  
our Commerce, the perfonal injuries to  
our fellow-citizens, and the genera!  
complexion of aftairs, prove to us your  
vigilant care in recommending to us ef-  
feifual meafures of defence.
