a  
In General Assembly  
Tuesday the 17th of December 1782.  
Whereas Resolutions in States which end in a dissolution of their former Government or constitution, bear no similarity to contests between independant Nations in which the object is the defence &amp; support of their Constitutions &amp; Governments inasmuch as in the former the life, liberty and property of the individual are risqued, in the latter the powers &amp; rights of the whole community in their political capacity are hazarded. Resolved therefore unanimously that when the former constitution or social compact of this Country &amp; the Civil Laws which existed under it, were dissolved—a Majority of the Inhabitants had through necessity, an unquestionable natural right to frame a new social compact &amp; to admit as parties thereto, those only who would be bound by the Laws of the Majority—&amp; consequently as no individual can claim immunities, privileges or property in any community but under the Laws of that community, so all those who were members of the former government which and its dependant Laws have been dissolved, abrogated and made void—cannot have legal claim to any immunity, privilege or property under our present constitution, or those Laws which flow from it if they were not parties to the present Social compact originally, or have [not] become parties by the subsequent Laws thereof.  
Resolved unanimously that the Laws of this State confiscating property held under the Laws of the former Governments (which have been dissolved and made void) by those who have never been admitted into the present social compact being founded on Legal Principles, were strongly dictated by that principle of common Justice which demands that if virtuous Citizens in defence of their natural &amp; Constitutional rights, risque their life, liberty and property on their success, the vicious Citizens, who side with Tyranny &amp; oppression, or who cloak themselves under the masque of neutrality, should at least hazard their property and not enjoy the benefits procured by the labours and dangers of those whose destruction they wished  
Resolved, unanimously that all demands or requests of the British Court for the restitution of property confiscated by this State being neither supported by Law, equity or policy, are wholly inadmissable, &amp; that our Delegates in Congress be instructed to move Congress, that they may direct their deputies who shall represent these States in the General Congress for adjusting a peace or truce, neither to agree to any such restitution, or submit that the Laws made by any Independant State of this Union, be subjected to the adjudication of any power or powers on Earth.

our commissioners were negotiating the  
treaty of peace, the last matter of difter­  
ence and discussion was that of confisca­  
ted property.  
The British commissioners urged the res  
toration of confiscated estates, but Jay and  
Franklin and their colleagues defended  
the right of confiscation with great ability,  
and refused to sign the treaty at all if that  
was to be a condition. While these nego­  
tlations were pending, the Colonies me­  
morialized Congress to guard against any  
concessions on the point in dispute. On  
the 17th day of December, 1782, the Leg­  
islature passed the following resolution:  
That the laws of this State confiscat­  
ing property held under the laws of the  
former Government (which had been dis­  
solved and made void) by those who have  
never been admitted into the present social  
compact, being founded on legal princi­  
oles, were strongly dictated by that prin  
ciple of cemmon justice, demand that,  
virtuous citizens, in defense of their nat­  
ural and constitutional rights, risk their  
life, liberty, and property on their sue­  
cess, the vicious citizens who side with ty­  
ranny and oppression, or who cloak them­  
selves under the mask of neutrality, should  
at leest hasard their property, and not en  
joy the benefirs procured by the labors and  
dangers of those whose destruction they  
wished.  
&quot;That all demands or requests of  
British Court for the restitution of prop­  
erty confiscated by this State, being nei­  
ther supported by law, equity, or policy,  
re wholly inadmissable, and that our Del  
egates in Congress be instructed to move  
Congress that they may direct their depn­  
ties, who shall represent these States  
the General Congress for adjusting a peace  
or truce, neither to agree to any such res­  
titution or submit that the laws made  
any independent State of this Union  
subjected to the adjudication of any power  
or powers on earth.
