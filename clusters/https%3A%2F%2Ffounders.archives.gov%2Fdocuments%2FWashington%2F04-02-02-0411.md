Dear Sir,  
Mount Vernon May 16th 1785  
  
In for a penny, in for a pound, is an old adage. I am so hackneyed to the touches of the Painters pencil, that I am now altogether at their beck, and sit like patience on a Monument whilst they are delineating the lines of my face.  
  
It is a proof among many others, of what habit &amp; custom can effect. At first I was as impatient at the request, and as restive under the operation, as a Colt is of the Saddle—The next time, I submitted very reluctantly, but with less flouncing. Now, no dray moves more readily to the Thill, than I do to the Painters Chair. It may easily be conceived therefore that I yielded a ready obedience to your request, and to the views of Mr Pine.  
Letters from England, recommendatory of this Gentleman, came to my hand previous to his arrival in America—not only as an Artist of acknowledged eminence, but as one who had discovered a friendly disposition towards this Country—for which, it seems, he had been marked.  
It gave me pleasure to hear from you—I shall always feel an interest in your happiness—and with Mrs Washingtons compliments, &amp; best wishes joined to my own, for Mrs Hopkinson &amp; yourself, I am—Dr Sir, Yr Most Obedt &amp; Affecte Hble Servant

MouNt VERNON, May 16, 1785.  
Dean Sin: In for a penny, in for a pound, is  
an old adage. I am so hackneyed to the  
touches of the painters&#x27; pencil that I am now  
altogether at their beck, and sit like patience  
on a monument while they are delineating  
the lines of my face. It is a proof, among  
many others, of what habit and custom can  
effect. At first I was as impatient at the re-  
many others, of what habit and custom can  
quest and as restive under the operation as a  
colt is of the saddle. The next time I sub  
mitted very reluctantly, but with less  
flouncing. Now no dray moves more readily  
to the thrall than I do to the painter&#x27;s chair.  
It may easily be conceived, therefore, that I  
yielded a ready obedience to your request  
and to the views of Mr. Pine.  
Letters from England recommendatory of  
this gentleman came to my hand previous to  
his arrival in America, not only as an artist  
of acknowledged eminence, but as one who  
had discovered a friendly disposition towards  
this country-for which it seems, he had been  
marked. It gave me pleasure to hear from  
ou. I shall always feel an interest in your  
happiness--and with Mrs. Washington&#x27;s com­  
pliments and best wishes, joined to my own  
for Mrs. Hopkinson and yourself,  
I am--Dr Sir  
Yr. Most obedt &amp; affecte

DEAR SiR :—In for a penny, in for a pound, is an old adage.  
I am so hackneyed to the touches of the painter’s pencil that  
I am now altogether at their beck, and sit like patience on a  
monument whilst they are delineating the lines of my face. It  
is a proof among others of what habit and custom can effect.  
At first I was as impatient at the request, and as impatient  
under the operation as a colt is of the saddle. The next time  
I submitted very reluctantly, but with less flouncing—now no  
dray moves as readily to the thill as I do to the painter’s  
chair. It may readily be conceived, therefore, that I yielded a  
ready obedience to your request and to the view of Mr. Pine.  
Letters from England came to my hand previous to his arrival  
in America, not only as an artist of acknowledged eminence,  
but as one. who has discovered a friendly disposition toward  
this country, for which, it seems, he had been marked.  
  
It gave me pleasure to hear from you. I shall always feel  
an interest in your happiness, and with Mrs. Washington’s  
compliments and best wishes, joined to my own, for Mrs. Hop-  
kinson and yourself, I am, dear sir, your most obedient, affte.,

‘‘In for a penny, in for a pound, is an

Hopkinson. ‘‘I am so hackneyed to the

Besides the failure of the public credit, it  
concerned him to note the fact that, though  
he kept a hundred cows, he was obliged  
to buy butter for his innumerable guests.  
He saw to it that there should be at least  
a very definite and efficient government  
upon his own estate, and, when there was  
need, put his own hand to the work. H

grandeur of George Washington’s pure  
  
ove of country cannot too constantly be  
blazoned before the people, and in no mo  
salutary way can this be done than by the  
continual exhibition of his  
presentment

ber of times that he submitted to the  
painter’s yoke cannot but seem appalling  
As early as May 16, 1785, he wrote: ‘‘]
