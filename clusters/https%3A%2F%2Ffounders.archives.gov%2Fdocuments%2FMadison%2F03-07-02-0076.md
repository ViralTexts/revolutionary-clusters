Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the Houseof Representatives.  
In meeting you at the present interesting conjuncture, it would have been highly satisfactory, if I could have communicated a favorable result to the Mission, charged with negociations for restoring peace. It was a just expectation from the respect due to the distinguished Sovereign, who had invited them by his offer of mediation; from the readiness with which the invitation was accepted on the part of the United States; and from the pledge to be found in an act of their Legislature, for the liberality which their Plenipotentiaries would carry into the negociations, that no time would be lost by the British Government in embracing the experiment for hastening a stop to the effusion of blood. A prompt and cordial acceptance of the mediation on that side, was the less to be doubted, as it was of a nature not to submit rights or pretentions on either side, to the decision of an umpire; but to afford merely an opportunity, honorable and desirable to both, for discussing, and if possible, adjusting them, for the interest of both.  
The British Cabinet, either mistaking our desire of peace for a dread of British power, or misled by other fallacious calculations, has disappointed this reasonable anticipation. No communications from our Envoys having reached us, no information on the subject has been received from that source. But it is known that the mediation was declined in the first instance; and there is no evidence, notwithstanding the lapse of time, that a change of disposition in the British Councils has taken place, or is to be expected.  
Under such circumstances, a nation proud of its rights, and conscious of its strength, has no choice but an exertion of the one, in support of the other.  
To this determination, the best encouragement is derived from the success with which it has pleased the Almighty to bless our arms, both on the land, and on the water.  
Whilst proofs have been continued of the enterprize and skill of our cruisers public and private on the Ocean, and a new trophy gained in the capture of a British by an American vessel of war, after an action giving celebrity to the name of the victorious Commander; the great inland waters on which the Enemy were also to be encountered, have presented achievements of our naval arms, as brilliant in their character, as they have been important in their consequences.  
  
On Lake Erie, the Squadron under command of captain Perry, having met the British squadron, of superior force, a sanguinary conflict ended in the capture of the whole. The conduct of that officer, adroit as it was daring, and which was so well seconded by his comrades, justly entitles them, to the admiration and gratitude of their Country; and will fill an early page in its naval annals with a victory, never surpassed in lustre, however much it may have been in magnitude.  
On Lake Ontario, the caution of the British Commander, favored by contingences, frustrated the efforts of the American commander to bring on a decisive action. Captain Chauncey was able however, to establish an ascendancy on that important theatre; and to prove, by the manner in which he effected every thing possible, that opportunities only were wanted, for a more shining display of his own talents, and the gallantry of those under his command.  
The success on Lake Erie having opened a passage to the Territory of the Enemy, the officer commanding the North Western Army transferred the war thither; and rapidly pursuing the hostile troops fleeing with their savage associates, forced a general action, which quickly terminated in the capture of the British and dispersion of the savage force.  
This result is signally honorable to Major General Harrison, by whose military talents it was prepared; to Colonel Johnson and his mounted volunteers, whose impetuous onset gave a decisive blow to the ranks of the Enemy; and to the spirit of the volunteer Militia, equally brave and patriotic, who bore an interesting part in the scene; more especially to the chief Magistrate of Kentucky at the head of them, whose heroism, signalized in the war which established the Independence of his Country, sought at an advanced age, a share in hardships and battles, for maintaining its rights and its safety.  
The effect of these successes has been, to rescue the inhabitants of Michigan from their oppressions, aggravated by gross infractions of the capitulation which subjected them to a foreign power; to alienate the savages of numerous tribes from the Enemy, by whom they were disappointed and abandoned; and to relieve an extensive region of country from a merceless warfare which desolated its frontiers, and imposed on its citizens the most harrassing services.  
In consequence of our naval superiority on Lake Ontario, and the opportunity afforded by it for concentrating our forces by water, operations which had been provisionally planned, were set on foot against the possessions of the Enemy on the St. Laurence. Such however was the delay produced, in the first instance, by adverse weather of unusual violence and continuence, and such the circumstances attending the final movements of the Army, that the prospect, at one time so favorable, was not realized.  
  
The cruelty of the Enemy, in enlisting the savages into a war with a nation, desirous of mutual emulation in mitigating its calamities, has not been confined to any one quarter. Wherever they could be turned against us, no exertions to effect it, have been spared. On our south Western border, the Creek Tribes, who yielding to our persevering endeavours were gradually acquiring more civilized habits, became the unfortunate victims of seduction. A war in that quarter has been the consequence, infuriated by a bloody fanaticism, recently propagated among them. It was necessary to crush such a war before it could spread among the contiguous tribes, and before it could favor enterprizes of the Enemy into that vicinity. With this view, a force was called into the service of the United States from the states of Georgia and Tennessee, which with the nearest regular troops, and other corps from the Mississippi Territory, might not only chastise the savages into present peace, but make a lasting impression on their fears.  
The progress of the expedition, as far as is yet known, corresponds with the martial zeal with which it was espoused; and the best hopes of a satisfactory issue, are authorized by the compleat success with which a well planned enterprize was executed against a body of hostile Savages, by a detachment of the volunteer Militia of Tennessee, under the gallant command of General Coffee; and by a still more important victory over a larger body of them, gained under the immediate command of Major General Jackson, an Officer equally distinguished for his patriotism and his military talents.  
The systematic perseverence of the Enemy in courting the aid of the savages in all quarters, had the natural effect of kindling their ordinary propensity to war, into a passion which even among those best disposed towards the United States, was ready, if not employed on our side, to be turned against us. A departure from our protracted forbearance to accept the services tendered by them, has thus been forced upon us. But in yielding to it, the retaliation has been mitigated as much as possible, both in its extent and in its character; stopping far short of the example of the enemy, who owe the advantages they have occasionally gained in battle, chiefly to the number of their savage associates; and who have not controuled them, either from their usual practice of indiscrimate massacre on defenceless inhabitants, or from scenes of carnage without a parallel, on prisoners to the British arms, guarded by all the laws of humanity, and of honorable war. For these enormities, the enemy are equally responsible, whether with the power to prevent them, they want the will, or with the knowledge of a want of power, they still avail themselves of such instruments.  
In other respects the Enemy are pursuing a course which threatens consequences most afflicting to humanity.  
  
A standing law of Great Britain naturalizes, as is well known, all aliens complying with conditions, limitted to a shorter period than those required by the United States; and naturalized subjects are, in war, employed by her Government, in common with native subjects. In a contiguous British Province, regulations promulgated since the commencement of the war, compel citizens of the United States being there under certain circumstances, to bear arms; whilst of the native Emigrants from the United States, who compose much of the population of the Province, a number have actually borne arms against the United States, within their limits; some of whom, after having done so, have become prisoners of war, and are now in our possession. The British Commander in that province, nevertheless, with the sanction as appears of his Government, thought proper to select from American Prisoners of war, and send to Great Britain for trial as criminals, a number of individuals, who had emigrated from the British Dominions long prior to the state of war between the two nations, who had incorporated themselves into our political society, in the modes recognized by the law and the practice of Great Britain; and who were made prisoners of war, under the banners of their adopted country, fighting for its rights and its safety.  
The protection due to these citizens, requiring an effectual interposition in their behalf, a like number of British prisoners of war were put into confinement, with a notification that they would experience whatever violence might be committed on the American prisoners of war, sent to Great Britain.  
It was hoped that this necessary consequence of the step unadvisedly taken on the part of Great Britain, would have led her Government to reflect on the inconsistences [sic] of its conduct; and that a sympathy with the British, if not with the American sufferers, would have arrested the cruel career opened by its example.  
This was unhappily not the case. In violation both of consistency and of humanity, American officers and non-commissioned officers in double the number of the British soldiers confined here, were ordered into close confinement; with formal notice that in the event of a retaliation for the death which might be inflicted on the prisoners of war sent to Great Britain for trial, the officers so confined would be put to death also. It was notified at the same time, that the commanders of the British fleets and armies on our coasts are instructed, in the same event, to proceed with a destructive severity against our towns and their inhabitants.  
That no doubt might be left with the Enemy of our adherence to the retaliatory resort imposed on us, a correspondent number of British officers, prisoners of war in our hands, were immediately put into close confinement, to abide the fate of those confined by the Enemy; and the British Government has been apprized of the determination of this Government,  
  
to retaliate any other proceedings against us, contrary to the legitimate modes of warfare.  
It is as fortunate for the United States that they have it in their power to meet the Enemy in this deplorable contest, as it is honorable to them, that they do not join in it, but under the most imperious obligations, and with the humane purpose of effectuating a return to the established usages of war.  
The views of the French Government on the subjects which have been so long committed to negociation, have received no elucidation since the close of your late session. The Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States at Paris, had not been enabled by proper opportunities, to press the objects of his Mission, as prescribed by his instructions.  
The Militia being always to be regarded as the great bulwark of defence and security for free states, and the Constitution having wisely committed to the national authority, a use of that force, as the best provision against an unsafe military establishment, as well as a resource peculiarly adapted to a country having the extent and the exposure of the United States, I recommend to Congress, a revision of the militia laws, for the purpose of securing more effectually, the services of all detachments called into the employment, and placed under the Government of the United States.  
It will deserve the consideration of Congress also, whether among other improvements in the militia laws, justice does not require a regulation, under due precautions, for defraying the expence incident to the first assembling, as well as the subsequent movements of detachments, called into the national service.  
To give to our vessels of war, public and private, the requisite advantage in their cruises, it is of much importance that they should have, both for themselves and their prizes, the use of the ports and markets of friendly powers. With this view I recommend to Congress the expediency of such legal provisions as may supply the defects, or remove the doubts of the Executive Authority, to allow to the cruisers of other powers at war with Enemies of the United States, such use of the American ports, as may correspond with the privileges allowed by such powers to American Cruisers.  
During the year ending on the 30th of September last, the receipts into the Treasury have exceeded thirty seven Millions and a half of dollars, of which near twenty four millions were the produce of loans. After meeting all the demands for the public service, there remained in the Treasury on that day, near seven millions of dollars. Under the authority contained in the act of the 2d of August last, for borrowing seven millions and a half of dollars, that sum has been obtained on terms more  
  
favorable to the United States than those of the preceding loan, made during the present year. Further sums to a considerable amount will be necessary to be obtained in the same way, during the ensuing year; and from the increased capital of the country, from the fidelity with which the public engagements have been kept, and the public credit maintained, it may be expected on good grounds, that the necessary pecuniary supplies, will not be wanting.  
The expences of the current year, from the multiplied operations, falling within it, have necessarily been extensive. But on a just estimate of the campaign, in which the mass of them has been incured, the cost will not be found disproportionate to the advantages which have been gained. The campaign has indeed, in its latter stages, in one quarter, been less favorable than was expected, but in addition to the importance of our naval success, the progress of the campaign has been filled with incidents, highly honorable to the American Arms.  
The attacks of the Enemy on Craney Island, on Fort Meigs, on Sacket’s Harbour, and on Sandusky, have been vigorously and successfully repulsed; nor have they in any case succeeded, on either Frontier, excepting when directed against the peaceable dwellings of individuals, or villages unprepared or undefended.  
On the other hand, the movements of the American Army, have been followed by the reduction of York, and of Forts George, Erie, and Malden; by the recovery of Detroit and the extinction of the Indian war in the West; and by the occupancy or command of a large portion of Upper Canada. Battles have also been fought on the borders of the St. Laurence, which though not accomplishing their entire objects, reflect honor on the discipline and prowess of our Soldiery, the best auguries of eventual victory. In the same scale are to be placed, the late successes in the South, over one of the most powerful, which had become one of the most hostile also, of the Indian Tribes.  
It would be improper to close this communication without expressing a thankfulness, in which all ought to unite, for the numerous blessings with which our beloved country, continues to be favored; for the abundance which overspreads our land, and the prevailing health of its inhabitants; for the preservation of our internal tranquility, and the stability of our free institutions; and above all for the light of divine truth, and the protection of every man’s conscience, in the enjoyment of it. And although among our blessings we cannot number an exemption from the evils of war; yet these will never be regarded as the greatest of evils, by the friends of liberty, and of the rights of nations. Our country has before preferred them to the degraded condition which was the alternative, when the sword was drawn in the cause, which gave birth to our national Independence; and  
  
none who contemplate the magnitude, and feel the value of that glorious event, will shrink from a struggle to maintain the high and happy ground, on which it placed the American people.  
With all good citizens, the justice and necessity of resisting wrongs and usurpations no longer to be borne, will sufficiently outweigh the privations and sacrifices inseparable from a state of war. But it is a reflection, moreover, peculiarly consoling, that whilst wars are generally aggravated by their baneful effects on the internal improvements and permanent prosperity of the nations engaged in them, such is the favored situation of the United States, that the calamities of the contest into which they have been compelled to enter, are mittigated by improvements and advantages of which the contest itself is the source.  
If the war has increased the interruptions of our commerce, it has at the same time cherished and multiplied our manufactures; so as to make us independent of all other countries for the more essential branches, for which we aught to be dependent on none; and is even rapidly giving them an extent, which will create additional staples, in our future intercourse with foreign markets.  
If much treasure has been expended, no inconsiderable portion of it has been applied to objects durable in their value, and necessary to our permanent safety.  
If the war has exposed us to increased spoliations on the ocean, and to predatory incursions on the land, it has developed the national means of retaliating the former, and of providing protection against the latter; demonstrating to all, that every blow aimed at our maritime independence, is an impulse accelerating the growth of our maritime power.  
By diffusing through the mass of the nation, the elements of military discipline and instruction, by augmenting and distributing warlike preparations applicable to future use; by evincing the zeal and valour with which they will be employed, and the cheerfulness with which every necessary burden will be borne; a greater respect for our rights, and a longer duration of our future peace, are promised, than could be expected, without these proofs of the national character and resources.  
The war has proved, moreover, that our free Government, like other free Governments, though slow in its early movements, acquires, in its progress, a force proportioned to its freedom; and that the union of these States, the guardian of the freedom and safety of all and of each, is strengthened by every occasion that puts it to the test.  
In fine, the war, with all its vicisitudes, is illustrating the capacity and the destiny of the United States to be a great, a flourishing, and a powerful nation; worthy of the friendship which it is disposed to cultivate with all others; and authorized, by its own example, to require from all, an  
  
observance of the laws of justice and reciprocity. Beyond these, their claims have never extended; and in contending for these, we behold a subject for our congratulations, in the daily testimonies of increasing harmony throughout the nation, and may humbly repose our trust in the smiles of heaven, on so righteous a cause.

Fellow Citizen* of the Senate, end of  
the Hou.tr of Ft/irrsenlativee.  
In meetit.g you at the present interest­  
ing conjuncture, it would have been high  
ly s-aislactoryfif I could have communicat­  
ed a favorable result to the mission oharg­  
*‘d With ncgociatmtib for restoring peace.-_  
I! was a just expectation from tho respect  
Jtio *o tni &lt;1 i&gt;riiigtitshod sovereign who  
iiad invited .them by his offer cf mediation,  
from the readiness with which the inrita­  
ticu wus accepted on the part ©f the U. S  
and from the pledge t® he found in an act  
iii thr ir legislature lor the liberality which  
•heir Plenipotentiaries would carry into  
the negotiations, that no time would be  
i&#x27;&lt;&quot;st by the British government in embrac  
ir-g the cxpvi inien* for hastening a  
stop to the effusion of blood. A prompt  
and cordial at ceptancc of the mediation on  
that sidfc wav the less to be di ublcd as it  
was of a nature not to submit rights or pi*,  
tensions on either side to tho decision of  
; umpire, but to afford mevcly an opportuni*  
j ly. honor aM* and desirable to both, for dis­  
| cussing, and if possible adjusting them, foi  
tiio interest nf both.  
  
1 1 he British cabinet, either mis&#x27;nking  
nut d csiro of peace fora tlroarl of British  
power, or misted by other fallacious calcu­  
lations, Ivts disappointed this reasonable an­  
ticipation* No conimunicutinna from out  
envoys having reached us, no information  
on the subject has been received from that  
source Bn1 it is known that the mediation  
mis d&gt; dined in the fi&gt;&#x27;st instance, and then*  
is t&#x27;o evidence, notwithstanding tho lapse  
o! time, that a change of disposition in  
the British councils has taken piece, oris  
to be expected  
Under sue!* circumstances, a nation  
proud of its tights, and conscious of its  
strength, bus uo choice but an exertiono!  
th&quot; err in support ot the other.  
To this determination, the ko*t encou­  
rrgrrrcr.t is derived Froni the success vritli

r&lt;n ;o ms, both on v.&#x27;c land rad or» the wa­

Whilst proofs have been continued ol;

trophy gained in the capture of a British by

giving celebrity to the name ol the victo-j

on which the enemy were also to be cn-j  
countered have pressn tod achievements of  
our naval arms, us brilliant in their charac­  
ter as they have been important in theii I  
consequences.  
  
On Lake Kric the squadron under torn­  
ma.vl of Captain Berry, having met tbs  
British squadron, of superior force, a san­  
guinary conflict ended in the capture of the  
&#x27;vnole The conduct of that officer, adroit  
aa n wr.s rta&#x27;ing, and which was so well  
seconded by his comrades, justly entitles  
tl.~m to the admiration uqd gratitude of  
thfeir country ; and will fill aa early pag.*­  
in its naval annals, with a victory-,, net or  
surpassed in lustre, however much ii nmy  
have been in magnitude.  
On Lake Ontario, the caution of the Bri­  
tish commander, favored hy contingencies,  
frustrated the efforts of the American com­  
mander, to bring on a decisive action_  
Captain Chauncey was able, however, to  
establish an ascendency on that important  
theatre, and to prove, by the manner in  
v. Iiich he offer ted every thing possible. I  
that opportunities only were a anted, for a  
more shining display of his own talents and  
of the gallantry of . those under his com­  
mand.  
j The success on Lake L :e having open­  
| ed a passage to the territory of the enemy.  
lh« officer commanding the north western  
army transferred the war thither ; ami rs­  
pidly pursuing the- hostile troops fleeing  
with their savage associates, forced a gene­  
ral action, which quickly terminated in the  
capture of the British, and dispersion of  
the savage force.  
This result is signally honorable to \!n­  
jor General Harrison, by whose military  
intents it was prepared ; to colonel John­  
son and bis mounted volunteers, whose  
impetuous onset gave a decisive blow to  
hi ranks ol the en^rry; and to the spirit  
of the volunteer militia equally brave siul  
patriotic, who bore an interesting pirtiin  
the scone ; more especially to the chief  
magistrate of Kentucky at Ibc head in  
hem, whoso heroism, signalised in the  
war which established the independence of  
his country, sought, at an advanced age, a  
share in hardships nnd battles, for main*  
mining its rights and it* safety.  
The effect of those successes has been to  
rescue the, inhabitants of Michigan from  
  
their oppressions, aggravated by grow in­  
fi actions of t()» capitulation which subject­  
ed them to a foreign power ; to alleuate  
tho savages of numerous tribes from the c­  
nemy, by whom they were disappointed and  
abandoned—and to relieve an expensive re­  
gion of country from a morciless warfare  
which dcsolatod its frontiers, and imposed  
on its citizens the most harrassing servi  
ces.  
In consequence of our naval superiority  
on Lake Ontario, and the opportunity af­  
forded by it for concentrating our forces  
by water, operations, which had been pre*  
viously planned, were set on foot, against  
the possessions of the enemy on the river  
*5t. Lawrence. Such, however, was the  
delay produced, in the first instance, by  
adverse weather of unusual violence and  
continuance, and such the circumstances  
attending the Cntl movements of the army,  
that tho prospect, at one time so favorable,  
was not realised.  
1 ho cruelty of the enemy, in enlisting  
the savages into a war with a nation dcsir­  
ous of mutual emulation in mitigating its  
calamities, has not been confined to any  
one quarter. Wherever they could be  
.turned against us, no exertions to effect it  
have been spared. On our South Wcstein  
border, the Creek tribes, who, yielding to  
our persevering endeavors, wore gradual­  
ly acquiring more civilised habits, became  
the unfortunate victims of seduction. A war  
in that quarter has been the consequence,  
infuriated by a bloody fanaticism, recently  
propagated among them.  
  
necessary to crush such a war  
before it could spread among the contigu­  
ous tithes, and before it could favor enter­  
prizes of the enemy into that vicinity.  
With this view a force was called into the  
set vice of the United States from the states  
of Georgia and Tcmicsse, which, with the  
.c.itcst regular troops, and other corps  
Imm the Mississippi territory, might not  
only chastise the savages into present  
peace, but make a lasting impression on  
their fears.  
The progress of the expedition, as far as  
is yet known, corresponds with the martial  
zcai with which it wuj espoused; and the  
l,ost. hopes o! a satisfactory issue are au­  
thotised l v tiie complete success with  
which a wol! planned untorprize was exe­  
cuted against a body of hoatile savages, by  
i detachment of the volunteer militia of  
I ettnessre, under the gallant command of  
Gen. Coffee ; and by a still more impor­  
tant victory over a larger body of them,  
earned under the immediate command of  
Vlnjor Gen Jackson ; an officer equally  
distinguished for liis patriotism and his  
miltary talents.  
The systematic perseverance or the ene­  
my in courting thonidof the savages in  
all quarters, had the natural effect of kind­  
ling thoir ordinary propensity to war into a  
passion, which, even among those best dis­  
posed towards tho U. States, was ready, if  
not employed on our side, to ba turned a­  
gninst ns. A departure from our protract­  
&#x27;d forbearance to accopi tha services t*n­  
dered &gt;.y them, has thus been forced up n  
us. But, in yielding to it, the retaliation  
has neon mitigated as much as possible,  
both in its extent and in it* c!ia:actor,  
stopping far abort of iha ex&#x27;iit pie of the  
enemy, who owe th* advantages they have  
occasionally gained in battle, chiefly to the  
number of their savage associates; and  
who have not controlled them either from  
thc-.r usual practice of indiscriminate mas­  
svrre on dcLmcelcss inhabitants, or from  
•scenes o[ carnage without a parallel, on  
prisoners to ibe British arms, guarded by  
all tlio laws of humanity and of honorable  
war.  
  
l&#x27;or these enormities the enemy are e­  
qu.tliy i esponsiols, whether with the power  
prove::t them they want the will, or with  
the knowledge of a want of power they still  
av. il themselves of such instruments.  
In other respects the enemy are pursuing  
t course which threatens consequences  
nost ..filleting to humanity.  
A standing law of Great Britain natural­  
izes, as is well known, ail aliens complying*  
woii comi lions limited to a shorter period  
ili.n those required by the United States, &amp;  
naturalised subject^ are in war employed  
:&gt;v her government in common with native  
subjects. In a contiguous British province  
| regulations promulgated since the com­  
mencement of the war compel citizens of  
•r.e United S.utcs being there under certain  
circumstances, to bear arms, whilst of the na­  
tive emigrants from the United States who  
compose much of the population of the  
province, a number have actually borne  
arms against the United States within their  
limits, some of whom after having done so  
liave become prisoners of war and are now  
in our possession. The British comman­  
der in that province nevertheless, with the  
sanction, us appears, of his government,  
thought proper to select from American  
prisoners of war, and send to Great Britain,  
for trial, as criminals, a number of indivi­  
duals who had emigrated from the British

the mo^cs&#x27;recognized and practised by G,  
Britain, and who were made prisoners of  
war under the banners of their adopted  
country fighting for its rights &amp; its safety.  
The protection due to these citizens re­  
quiring an cfiectual interposition in their  
behait^a like number of British prisoners  
of war were put into confinement, with a  
notification that they would experience  
whatever violence might be committed on  
the&quot; American prisoners of war sent to G.  
Britain.  
It was hoped that this necessary conse­  
quence of the step unadvisedly taken on the  
part of Great Baitain would have led her go­  
vernment to reflect on the inconsistencies of i  
its conduct mid that a sympathy with the !  
British if not with the American sufferers,  
would have arrested the cruel career open­  
ed hv its example..  
This was unhappily not the case. In vi­  
olation both of consistency and humanity,  
American officers and non-commissioned  
officers, in double the number of the British  
soldiers cotifim d here, were ordered into !  
close confinement, with formal notice that 1  
in the event of retaliation for the&#x27;dcuth which |  
might be inflicted on the prisoners of war i  
sent to Great Britain for lriul,thc officers so j  
confined would be put to death also. It i  
was notified at the same time that the coin- I  
manders of the British fleets and armies on  
our coasts are instructed, in the same event  
to proceed with adesructive severity against  
our towns ami their inhabitants.  
That no doubt might be left with tboieno- |  
my of our adherence to the retaliating re­  
sort imposed on us, a correspondent mini- ,  
her of British officers prisoners of war in  
our hands were immediately put into close  
confinement, to abide the fate of these con­  
fined by the enemy ; and the British go­  
vernment has been apprised of the delernti­  
04 mis government, to retaliate any other  
proceeding against us, contrary to the ivgi­  
itmate modes of warfare.  
  
It is as fortunate tor the United States  
that they have it in their power to meet the  
enemy in this deplorable contest, as it is  
honorable to them, that they do not join in  
kbut under the most imperious obligations,  
and with the humane purpose of elice!hat­  
ing a return to the established usages of  
war.  
The views of the French government on  
the subjects which have been so long com­  
mitted to negotiation, hare received go  
elucidation since the close of your late ses­  
sion. The minister plenipotentiary of th»  
United States at Fans nad not been onu­  
lucd, by proper opportunities, to press toe  
objects of bis mission, as piescubcd by fits  
instructions  
The militia being always to be regarded  
as the great bulwark of defence and se­  
curity for free states, and the constitu­  
tion having wisely couimired to the nation­  
al authority a use of that force, as the  
best piovisioti against an unsafe militaiy  
establishment, as well as a resource pecu­  
liarly adapted to a country having the ox­  
tent and tho jxposuicof the United Slates,  
I recommend to congress a revision of the  
militia laws for tne purpose of securing,  
more effectually, the services of a!l de­  
tachments called into the employment, and  
placed under the government i f the U. S.  
It will deserve the consideration of&#x27; con­  
gress also, whether, among other improve­  
ments in the rn iilin laws, justice dooa cot  
require a regulation, under due precau­  
tions, for defraying the cs pence incident  
to the first assembling as weil as to the sub­  
sequent movements of detachments called  
into the national service.  
  
l o give to our vessels oi war, piuuic ana  
private, ihc requisite advantage iu their  
cruizes, it is of much importance that they  
should have, for themselvcsaud their pt izas  
l!ie use of the polls ol friendly povi crs.—  
With this view, i recommend to congress  
the expediency of such legal provisions as  
may supply the defects, or remove the  
doubts of the executive authority to allow  
to the cruisers of other powers, at war with  
enemies of the United Status, such use of  
the American ports and markets as may  
correspond with the privileges uiiovved by  
.such powers to American cruizers.  
During tli&lt;? year ending on ilia 30th of  
Sapt. last the receipts into the treasury  
have excoedod 37 millions and a halt of  
dollars, of which near 24 millions vvero tlie  
produce of loans. After meeting ail the  
demauds for the public servit e there re­  
mained in the treasury on that day, near 7  
millions of dollars. Under the authority  
contained in the act of tlie 2d of August  
last, for borrowing seven millions and a  
half of dollars, that aim has beau obtained  
on term* more favorr.ble to the U. S. than  
those of the preceding year. Further sums  
to i» considerable amount will be necessary  
be obtained in the same way during the  
ensuing year ; and front the increased ca­  
pital of tlie country, from the fidelity with  
which the public engagements have bceu  
kept, and the public credit maintained, it  
may be expocted on good grounds that the  
necessary pecuniary supplies will not be  
wanting.  
The cxpencca of the current year, from  
II* : 7 V  
  
the multiplied operations falling within it,  
have necessarily been extensive. But on  
a just estimate of the campaign, in w hich  
i the mass of them has been incurred, the  
coat will not be found disproportionate to  
the advantages which have been gained. i  
The campaign has indeed in its latter stag­  
es in one quarter, been less favorable than  
was expected, but ir, addition to the im­  
portance of our naval success, the pro­  
gress of the campaign has been filled with  
incidents highly honorable to the American  
art , .  
1 he attacks of the enemy on Craney  
Island, on Fort Meigs, on Sackctt’s Har­  
bor, and oh.Sandusky, have been vigorously  
and successfully repulsed ; nor have they  
in any case succeeded on either homier,  
excepting when directed against the peace­  
able dwellings of individuals, ur villages un­  
prepared or undefended.  
On the other hand the movements of the  
American army hove been followed hy the  
reduction of York, and of forts Oeerge,  
Erie and Malden ; by the recovery of De­  
troit and the extinction of the Indian war  
in the west; and by the occupancy or com­  
mand of a large portion of Upper Canada.  
Baules have also been fought on the bor­  
ders of the St. Lawrence, which, tho’ nm  
accomplishing their entire ohjecis, reflect  
honor on the discipline and prowess of our  
soldiery, thubist auguries of eventual vic­  
tory. In the same scale arc to be placed  
the lato successes in the south, over one oi  
the most powerful, which had become one  
of the most hostile also, of the Indian •  
tribes.  
  
it wouiu nc improper to close this!  
conamunicniion without expressing a thank  
fulness, iu which all ought to unite, lor the  
numerous blessings with which our belov- j  
od country continues to be favored ; for tha  
abuudrnca which ovorsprrads our loud, Sc !  
the prevailing health of i*b inhabitants ; for  
preservation ot our internal tranquility, and  
tha stability «»f onr free institutions ; and a­  
b®v# all fir the light of divine tiuth, and  
the promt ion ol every man&#x27;s ccnscienc®  
in tho enjoyment of it. And although n­  
mong our hle&lt;*sing\ ws cannot i.timber an :  
exemption fro® the evils of war ; vet these |  
niil novar be regarded as the greatest of j  
eviis. by t.ie friends of libcity, and ef tiie 1  
rights of nations. Our country has before ]  
preferred them to the degrading condition !  
which was tne alternative, when ilit; sword  
was drawn in the cause which gave birth to  
our national independence ; and non*; who  
contemplate the magnitude, and feci the va­  
lue ol that glorious event, will shrink from  
a struggle to maintain the high and happy  
ground on which it placed tire American |  
people.  
With all good citizens, the justice and !  
necessity ot resisting wrongs and usurpa­  
tions no longer to be borne, will sufficiently  
outweigh the privations and sacrifices, in­  
s&#x27; parable from a state of war. But u is a &lt;  
reflection, moreover, peculiarly consoling,  
that whilst wars arc generally aggravated by  
their baneful effects on the internal im­  
provements and permanent, prosperity of  
t*.c ....da;,s engaged in them, such is the  
iavoiv.l situation of the United States, that  
me calumnies of the contest into whic:.  
they have been compelled to enter, arc mi­  
liguted by improvements and advantages of  
wmcn u.o contest itscli is ilie source.  
li the war has increase*! ihs interi uptionn  
of uur commerce, it has at me same time  
cluu&#x27;iihed and multiplied our manufactures  
so as to make us independent of all other  
countries lor the moic essential Lranclu s.  
lor which wo ougiu to b* depmnk ton  
none ; ami is even lapirhy giving them an  
extent wbicr* will create uUditiouri staples :  
in our future intercom se with foieign  
mat kets  
  
it much treasure hus been expended, no 1  
inconsiderable portion oi it has beer) jpp.i j  
ed to objects cluiabie in th^ir value, ami !  
necessary to our permanent safely.  
It the war lias exposed us to increased ,  
spoliations on the ocean, and to predatory !  
incursions on the land, it has m moped J  
the national means of retaiiatimr the former. &#x27;  
anil oi providing protection against the lat- *  
ter; demonstrating to all, that every blow j  
aimed ut our mai nline independence is an &#x27;  
imp- isc accelerating the growth of our  
maritime power.  
By diffusing through the mas* of the  
nation the dements of military discipline !  
and instruction, by augmenting and distri­  
buting warlike preparations, applicable to i  
future use, by evincing the zeal and valor  
with which they* will be employed, and the :  
cheerfulness with which every necessary ;  
burden will be borne ; a greater respect  
for our rights and a longer duration of our ;  
future peace are promised, than could be 1  
expected without these proofs of the na­  
tional character and resources.  
The war baa proved, moreover, that our  
free government, like other free govern­  
ments, though slow in its early movements,  
acquires in its progress a force proportion­  
ed to its freedom; and that the union o!  
these states, the guardian of the freedom  
and safety of all and of each, is strengthen­  
ed by every occasion that puts it to the test  
  
1 III fine, the war, with all its vicissitudes  
is illustrating the capacity and the Hi stiny  
of the U. States, to be a great, a flourish  
mg, and a powerful nation—worthy of the  
friendship which it is disposed to cultivate  
with all others^&#x27;and authorised, by its own  
example, to require from, all an observance  
of the laws of justice and reciprocity. Be­  
yond these their claims have never extend­  
ed—and, in contending for these, we be­  
hold a subject for our congratulations, in  
ihe daily testimonies of cncruasing harmo­  
ny throughout the nation, and mey humbly  
repose our trust in the smiles of Heaven  
on so righteous a cause.  
JAMES MADISON.

fellow-Citizens of the Senate, &amp;  
V of the House of Representativee,  
Iji meeting you at the present inte­  
resting conjuncture, it would have  
been highly satisfactory if I could have  
communicated a tavurable result to the  
Mission charged with uegociations for  
restoring peace. It wav a just oxpect­  
ati *o from, the respect clue to the dis­  
tinguished S ;vereign who had invited  
them by hut offer of mediation, from  
the readiness with which the invitation  
was accepted on tne pariot tne United j  
States, end fro * the pledge to bo found j  
. in an act |&lt;&gt;f their Legislature for tne .  
liberality which their Plenipotentiaries :  
WO’.xid carry lUto the negiic*i*.tioo, that |  
no tune would be lost by the 4 British j  
Government in embracing tha experi­  
ment for hastening a stop to the effusion  
‘ of blood. A prempt and cordial arcep­  
m . ... i: __  
  
tance oi uic u» •««« &quot;■a  
the less to be d»*Ui&gt;ted at it was of a  
nature not to submit rights or preten­  
tion* on either side to the decision of  
an umpire, but to afford merely in op­  
portunity* honorable and desirable to  
both* for discussing, and if possible ad­  
justing the n, for the interest of beth.  
4 The British Cabinet* either mistaking  
our desire of peace for a dread of Brit­  
ish power* or misled by oiher fallacious  
calculations, ha* disappointed this rea­  
sonable anticipation. No communica­  
tions froTt our Envoy* having reached  
us no information on the auhject h*s  
been received from that source. But it  
it known that the mediation was declin­  
ed in the first instance, and there is no  
evidence, notwithstanding the lapse of  
time, that a change of disposition in the  
Bruuh Councils haa taken place, or is  
to he expected.  
U ider such circumstances, a nation  
proud of its rights, and conscious of us  
strength, has no choice but an exertion  
of the our in «uoport of the other  
To this determination, the best en­  
couragement &quot; derived from the iut&gt;  
with which it U*» pleased the Al­  
mighty to biess our arms, both on the  
land and on the water,  
Whilst proofs have been continued  
of the enterprise and skill of &#x27;nir crui­  
sers, public and private, on the ocean,  
and a new trophy gained in the capture  
of a British bv an American vessel of  
war, afte** an action giving celebrity to  
filename of the victorious commander;  
the great inland water*, en which the  
enemy were alt&gt;o to be encountered,  
have presented achievements of our na­  
val arms, as brilliant in their character  
es they have been important in their  
consequence*.

officer, adroit as it was dating, and  
Which ws* so well seconded by nis com­  
rades, jowly entitles them to the «omi­

and will 8m an early page in its na  
sal annals, with • victory, never sur­  
passed in iuatie* however much it may  
have been in magnitudes  
On Lake Ontario- the caution of tha  
British commander, favored ay contin­  
gencies, frustrated the offcms of the  
American coflaurmJor, to bring on a de­  
cisive action.&#x27; Captain Cltauncey w*s  
able, however, to e.inbiish an ascen­  
dency on that important theatre, and to  
pj-ove, by tue manner in wn»ch he ef­  
fected every thing possible, that oppor­  
tunities only were wanted, f»r a more  
shining display of hi* own talent* and  
of the gallantry of those under hi* com­  
mand. _ _ . .  
The success on Like Erie having o­  
pened a pss*ag* to the territory *t the  
cn* nv, the officer commanding the n«rth  
westorn ar ny transfe^rrd the w.»r thi­  
ther ; and rapidly pursuing the hostile  
troops fleeing with their savage associ­  
ates, forced, fijfinml action, which  
quickly terminated in the cipture o»  
the British, ami dispersion of the savage  
force.  
Tae result is signally honorable to  
Major General Harrison, by wnose mi­  
litary talents it was prepared ; to coi­  
Johnson and his mo mi“d volanteers,  
whose impetuous onset gave a decisive  
blow to the rank* of tho *ne ny ; and to  
the spiritof the voluot*er minis equal­  
ly brave and patriotic, who bore an in­

dill? to the chief megiitnte of Ken­  
tucky at the head of them, whota hero­  
ism, aigniliscd in tbo war which estab­  
lished the Independence of his country  
sought at an advanced age, a share in  
midships and battles, for maintaining  
its rights and its safely. ■  
The effect of these successes ha*  
neen to rescue the inhabitants of Michi*  
gan from their oppressions aggravated  
oy gross infraction* of the capitulation  
which suojccted them to a foreign pow­  
er i to alienate the savages of nume­  
rous tribe* from the enemy, by whom  
they were disappointed and abandoned ;  
and to relieve an extensive region of  
country from a merciless warfare which  
deaolatad it* frontiers, and imposed on  
its citixcns the most harrassing servi­  
ces.  
In coasequer.ee of our naval superio­  
rity on Lake Ontario, and the opportu­  
nity afforded by it for concentrating our  
ferces by water, operations which had  
been previously planned, were set on  
foot, against the p*mesi»ions of the ene­  
my on the St Lawrence. Such, howe­  
ver, was the delay produced, in the first  
instance, by adv rse weather of unusu*­  
violence and continuance, and such the  
circumstances attending the final move­  
ments of the army, that me prospect to  
one time so favorable, was not reaiiseu.  
The crueiiv of the enemy, in enlisting  
the savages into a war with a nation de­  
sirous of mutual emulation in mitigating  
its calami’ies, has not been confined to  
any one quarter. Wherever they couM  
be turned against us, no exertions to ef­  
fect u have been spared. On our South  
Western border, the Creek tribes, who  
yielding to our persevering endeavors,  
were gradually acquiring more civilised  
ha bits, became ihc unfortunate victims  
of seduction A war in that quarter has  
been the ’ consequence, infuriated bv *  
bloody fanaticism, recently propagated  
among them.  
  
It was necessary to crusn sucn a war  
before it could spread among the conti­  
guous tribes, and before it could favor  
enterprizcs of the enemy into tliai vici  
nity. With this view a lorce was cal  
led into the service of the U. Slates  
from the states of Georgia and Tennes­  
see, which, with the nearest regular  
troops, and other corps from the Mis  
s&#x27;ssippi territory, might not only chas­  
tise the savages into present peace: but  
make a lasting impaession on their fears.  
The progress of the expedition, as  
far as is yet known, corresponds with  
the inartisl zeal with which it was es­  
poused ; and the best hopes&#x27;of a satis­  
factory issue sire authorised by the com­  
plete success with which a well plan­  
ned emerprse was executed against a  
body of hostile savages, by a detach  
ment of the volunteer militia of Tennes­  
see, under the gallant commaud of Gen.  
Cfcffte ; nnd by a still more important !  
victory over a larger body of them,  
gained under the immediate command  
of Vfaj. Gen. Jackson ; an officer equal­  
ly distinguished for hit patriotism and  
his military talents.  
The tystematic perseverance of the  
enemy in courting the aid ofthesavvges  
in at! quarters, bad the natural effect ol  
kindling their ordinary propensity to war  
into a passion, which, even among those  
beat disputed towards tbe U. S was  
ready, if not employed on our side, t&lt;*  
be turned against us. A departure from  
our protected forbearance to accept the  
services tendered by them, h*s thus  
been forced upon u% But, in yielding  
to it, the retaliation has been mitigMted  
as much as possible, both in its extent  
and in its character, stepping Gr short  
of the example ot the enemy, who owe  
the advantages they have occasionally  
gained in battle, chiefly to the nunmer  
of their s»v&lt;«^e associates; and * ho have  
not controlled them either from their  
usual practice of indiscriminate nussa­

scents of carnage wi&gt; h&#x27;&gt;ut a parallel, on  
prisoners to the British arms, guarded  
bj ail the laws of humanity and ol ho­  
norable war.  
For the enormities, the enemy are e- .  
oually responsible; whether with the  
p wer to prevent them they want the j  
will, or with the knowledge of a want 1  
of power they still avail themselves ol j  
such instruments. i  
Inoiher respects the enemy were pur­  
suing a course wnich threatens conse­

ployed hv her government in common  
with native subjects. In a contiguous  
British province, regulations promulgat­  
ed since the commencement of the war  
cumpel citizens of the United States,  
being there under certain circumstances  
to bear arms; whilst of the native emi  
grants irora the U S who compose  
much of the population of the province,  
a number hate actually borne arms a  
gainst the U. S within their limits ;  
vome of whom after having done so  
have become prisoners of war, and are  
now in our possession The British  
commander in that province, ne vert he  
less, with the saneiian, as appears cf his  
government, thought proper to select  
from American prisoners of war, and  
lend to G. B. for trial as criminals, a  
number of individuals, who had emi  
crated from the British dominions long  
Jrior to the state of war between tht  
wo nations, who had incorporated them &lt;

modes recognised by the Uir and prac­  
tice of G B. aad wh# were made pri­  
soners ef war, under the banner* of theii  
Adopted country, fighting for its rights  
and itr safety.  
The protection due to these citizens  
requiring an effectual interposition in  
their behailt • like number ol British  
prisoners of war were put into confine­  
ment, with a notification that they wouiu  
experience whatever violence might b«  
committed on the American prisoner oi  
war sent to G. Britain.  
it was hoped that this necessary con­  
sequence ol the step unadvisedly taken  
on the part of G B. wi uld have led hei  
government to reflect on the inconsistent  
cies of its conduct, and that a sympathy  
with the British, if not with the Ame­  
rican sufferers, would have arrested the  
cruel career opened by its example.  
This was unhappily not the rase. In  
violation both of consistency and ol hu­  
manity. American officers and non com­

The views of the French govern­  
ment on Hie subjects which have  
been so long committed fo ucgocm­  
tion, have received no elucidation  
since the close nf your late session.  
The Minister Plenipotentiary of U.  
Stales at Paris bad n*»t been enabled,

objects of bis mission, us prescribed

of Hie militia laws for tba purpose  
of securing, more etfcetuully, Hie  
servicos of all detachments celled  
into (be employment ot the toiled  
States.  
It w ill deserve the consideration of  
Congress also, v betber, among other  
improvements in the. militia laws, jus­  
tice does not require a regulations,  
under due precautions, for defray­

quent movements of detachments

To give to our vessels of war,  
public and private, the requisite ad­  
vantage in their cruises, it i&gt; of much  
importance tint they should have,  
both for themselves and their prizes,  
the use of the ports of friendly pow­  
ers. With this view, ] recommend  
to Congress the expediency of such  
legal provisions as may supply the de­  
fect*. or remove the doubts of the  
Executive authority to allow to the  
cruisers of other powers, at war with  
enemies of the United Slates such  
use of the American port* and mur­  
kest* as may correspond with the  
privileges allowed bv such powers to  
American cruisers.  
liming the vear ending on the  
SOth of September-last*, the receipts  
into the Treasury have exceeded  
thirty-seven million and a half of  
dollars, of which near twenty*four  
millions were the produce of loans.  
After meeting all the demands for  
the public service, there remained  
in the T reasury on that day, near  
seven millions of dollars. Under  
the authority contained in the act of  
the 2d of August last* for borrowing  
seven millions and a half ot dollars,  
that sum has been obtained on terms  
more favorable to the United State*  
than those of the preceding loan  
made during the present year. Fur­  
ther sums to a considerable amount  
will be necessary to he obtained in  
the same way during the ensuing  
year; and from the increased eapi  
tal of the oeuutrj, from the fidelity  
  
with which the p«b!i« engagement#  
hive been kept, and the pupiie credit  
maintained, it may he expaeted on  
good grounds that the necessary  
pecuniary supplies will not be wan­  
ting.  
The expenses of the enrrent, year  
from the multiplied operations fall­  
ing within it, have necessarily been  
extensive. But on a just estimate of  
the campaign, in which the mass ef  
them has been incurred, the cost  
will not ha found disproportionate  
to the advantages, which have been  
gained. The campaign has indeed,  
in its latter stages in ene quarter,  
been less favorable than was eX4&gt;ert«  
ed, but in addition to the importance  
of our mtvul success, the progress  
ol the campaign has been filled with  
incidents highly honorable to the  
American arms.  
The attack* of the enemy on  
Cranev Island, on Fort Meigs, on  
Saekett’s Harbor, amt on Sandusky,  
have been vigorously and succesa­  
fnlly repulsed ; nor have they in any  
rasp succeeded on either frontier,  
excepting when directed against the  
peaceable dwellings of individuals,  
or villages unprepared or undefend­  
ed.  
On the other hand the movements  
oT the Americau army have been  
tallowed by the reduction of York,  
red of Forts Hrorge, Erie and  
Malden; by the recovery of De­  
troit and ihe extinction of the In.  
dun war in the West ; and by the  
occupancy or command of a large  
  
portion of Upper UnatU* Hatties  
have also been fought on the bor­  
ders of the St. Lawrence, which,  
though not accomplishing their en­  
ure objects, reflect honor- on the  
discipline and prowess of our soldie­  
ry the best auguries of eventual  
vh tdfjr. In the same scale arc to  
he placed the late successes in the  
si&#x27;i.di, over one of the most power­  
ful, which had beaome one of the  
most hostile also, of the Indian  
tribes.  
It would he improper to close this  
communication without expressing  
a thankfulness, in which all ought  
to unite, for the mi menus Messing!  
with whi h our beloved country con­  
tinues to be favored ; for die abun­  
dance which overspreads our land,  
and the prevailing health of its in­  
habitants ; for the preservation of  
our interna! tranquility, and the  
stability of our free instbutions ; &amp;  
above all for the light of divine  
truth, and the protection of every  
man’s conscience in the enjoyment  
of it. And although among our  
blessing® we cannot number an ex­  
emption from the evils of war ; yet  
these will never be regarded as the  
greatest of evils, by the friends ol  
liberty and of the rights of nations,  
Our country !■»« before preferred  
them to the degrading condition  
w hich was the alternative, when the  
sword was drawn in the cau«e which  
gave birth to our national indepen­  
dence ; and none who contemplate  
the magnitude, and feel the valu*  
of that glorious event, w ill shrink  
from a struggle to maintain the hig^li  
and happy ground on which it plac­  
ed the American people.  
With all good citizens, the justice  
and necessity of resisting wrougs ant  
usurpations no longer to be borne  
will sufficiently outweigh the priva  
lions \ sacrifices, inseparable front  
a state of war. But it is a red wo  
  
I ion. moreover, peculiarly consoling  
hint whilst wars are generally ag  
grevated hv their baneful effects oi  
the internal improvements amt per  
nianent prosperity of the nations en  
g-&#x27;geri in them, such is the favoret  
situation of tho I nitcil States, tha  
the calamities of the contest inti  
which they have been compelled t&lt;  
enter, are mitigated by improve  
meets and advantsercfe of w hich tbi  
contest itself is the tc-.urge.  
If the wa eaginrreased the inter  
nipt ions of Oar commerce, it has a  
the same time ehciished and multi  
plied our manufactures, so as t&lt;  
! make us independent of all otliei  
| countries lor the inure essentia  
branches, for which we ought ti  
be-dependent on none 5 and is evei  
rapidly giving them an extent whicl  
will create additional staples in oui  
? future intercourse with foreign mar  
kets,  
I f much treasure has been expend  
ed, no inconsiderable portion of i  
has been applied to objects durabh  
in their value, and necessary to oui  
permanent safety.  
If the war has exposed us to in  
creased spoliations on the ocean, am  
to predatory ineursions on the Jand  
it has developed the national mean  
of retaliating the former, and pro  
viding protection against the latter  
demonstrating to all, that, over;  
blow aimed at our maritimo iude  
  
peodenee is an impulse aoeetmt trig  
the growth of our maritime power.  
By diffusing through the mass of  
the nation the elements of military  
discipline and instruction, by aug­  
menting and distributing warlike pre­  
parations, applicable to future use,  
by evincing the seal and valor with  
which they will be employed, and the  
cheerfulness with which every ne­  
cessary burden will be home j a  
greater respect for our rights and &amp;  
longer duration of eur future peace  
arc promised, than eould.be expect­  
ed without these proofs of the na­  
tional character and resources.  
The wa« has proved, moreover, that  
our free government, like other free go­  
} vernroems, though slow in its early  
movement, acquires iu iia progress a  
force proportioned to its lieedom j and  
that the union of these states, the guar­  
dian of thi freedom and safety of all and  
of each, is strengthened by every occa­  
! sion that puts it to the test.  
In fine, the war, with all its vicissi­  
tudes, is illustrating the capacity and  
; the destiny of the U. States to be a  
great, a flourishing and a powerful na­  
tion, worthy of the friendship which it  
is disposed to cultivate with all others;  
; and authorised, by its own example, to  
| require trom all an observance of the  
laws of justice and reciprocity. Be­  
j yond these their claims have never ex­  
| tended ; and, iu contending for these;  
j we heboid a subject for our congratu­  
lations, in thfc daily testimonies of in­  
creasing harmony throughout the na­  
tion, and mey humbly rep»*e eur trust  
in the smiles of Heaven on so righteous  
a cause.

coni..ncmie, it would have been highly sa.  
t. actory J cnuhl have communicated a  
t.ivor able result to the Mission charged  
with negoci itions for restoring peace. It  
was a just expectation from the respect due  
to the tiist’Pg-iis&#x27;ied Sovereign who had invi  
ted them by his offer of mediation, from the  
readiness with which the invitation whs  
accepted rn the |&gt; &lt;rt of the LT. S. &amp; from the  
pledge to he lound in an act of their Legis­

merely an opportunity, h notable ami desi­  
nifi&#x27;c to both, for discussing, and i&lt; possible

desire ot peace fora dread ..f British pow­  
cr, oi misled by other fallacious calculatl­  
&lt;hi.&lt;. has disappointed this reasonable antici­  
pation. No communications from our En­  
voys haying reached us, no information r.n  
..e iihje t has been received from that  
source. But it is kuown that the media  
&#x27;ion was declined in the timt instance, and  
there is no evidence, notwithstanding the

in the British Councils has taken place, or

battles, tor maintaining us rights 6c us sulo­  
ly:,  
1 he effect of these successes has !*een to  
rescue the inhabitant* of Michigan from  
their oppressions, aggravated by gross in­  
fractions of the capitulation which subjected  
them to a foreign power ; to alienate the  
savages of numerous tribes from the enemy,  
by whom they were disappoin&#x27;ed and n­  
jbandoned ; and to teleive an extrusive re­  
gion of country fr. m a merciless warfare  
which desolated its frontiers, and impost d  
on it a citizens the most harrass ng services.  
In consequence of our naval superiority  
on bake Ontario, and the opportunity s*f.  
forded by it for concentrating our forces by  
water, operations, which h id been previ­  
ously planned, were set on lout, against the  
possessions of the enemy on the St. Law­  
rence. Such, however, was the delay pro­  
duced, in the first instance, by adverse  
weatherof unusual violence and c ntinumre,  
hi d such the circumstances attending the  
final movruents of the army, that the pros­  
pect, at one time so favorable, was not re­  
alised.  
1 lie cruelty of the enemy, in enlisting the  
savages into a war with a nation desirous of  
mutual emulation in mitigating its calam­  
ities, has not bten confined to any one quar­  
ter. Wherever they could be turned against  
os. no exertions to effect it have been spar­  
ed. On our South Western border, the  
Cicek. tribes, who, yielding to our persever­  
ing endeavors, were gradually acquiring  
m &gt;re civilised habits became the unfoitu­  
nate victims of seduction. A war in that  
quarter lias been the consequence, infuria­  
ted by a bloody fanaticism, recently propa­  
gated among them.  
it was necessary to crush such a wer be­  
fore it could spread amrng the c&#x27;nfiguous  
tiibes, and before it could favor enterin&#x27; z-s  
of the enemy into that vicinity. With this  
view a force was called into the serv.re of  
tbe United States from the states cf Cieorgia  
and I ennessee, w&#x27;hjch, with the nenrest re­  
gular troops, and other corps from the  
Mississippi territory might no* ro&#x27;y &lt; h- s&#x27;be  
the savages into present peace, but make a  
  
tAbimi*; impression on their fears.  
1 he progress of the expedition, as far as  
is yet known, corresponds with the mar­  
tial zeal with which it was espoused ; and  
die bt st hopes of a satisfactory issue are  
authorised by the complete success v ith  
which a well planned enterprise was exe­  
cuted against a body of hostile savages, bv a  
detachment of the vo&#x27;un&#x27;etr militia of Ten­  
nessee. under the gallant command of tien.  
U flee , ami by u still more important vie.  
torv over a laiget body of hem, gained un­  
der the immediate Command of Maj r (;&lt;•­  
net ul Jackson t an ntlioer equally tlis&#x27;iu­  
gu.shed for his patriotism aim his military  
talents. 3  
T&#x27;.e sys emat c perseverance of the ene­  
my in courting the aid of the savages in all  
quarters, had the natural effect of kindling  
tile 1 ordinary propensity t &gt; war into a pas  
siun, which,even among those best disposed  
towards the United States, was ready, il  
not employed i n our side, to be turned* a­  
guinst US. A departure from our profac­  
ied forbearance to accept the seviccs ten  
tiered by them, has thus been forced upon  
us. But. in yielding to it, the retaba ior,  
has hewn mitigated as much ns possl ,le  
both in its extent and in its character, st p­  
pmg far short of the example of the f-nemv.  
who owe the advantages they have nccast­  
o.iallv gained in battle,cloehy to the number  
of tneir savage associates ; and who have  
not controlled them either from their usual  
practice of indiscriminate massacre on de  
fenceless inhabitants, or fiotn scenes of car­  
nage without a parallel,on prisoners to the  
British arms, guarded by all the laws of hu  
inanity and of honorable war.  
. hoi these enormities, the enemy are e  
qualiy responsible, whether with me povv&#x27; r  
to prevent them they want the will,or nth  
the knowledg • of a want of power tliev still  
avail themselves of such instruments.  
In oilier rt pects the enemy are puisuing  
a course which threatens consequences  
most afllicting to humanity.  
  
-- ..*«•* &quot;i v». nritam naturalize}&#x27;,  
as is well known, all aliens, complying wi-h  
conditions limited to a shorter period than  
those required by the U. States ; and na­  
turalized subjec s are, in war, employed by  
her government in common with native sub­  
jects. In a contiguous British province, re­  
gulations promulgated since ihc commence  
iiient of the war comp-1 citizens of the U.  
States, being there under certain circum­  
stances, to bear arms ; whilst ot the native  
emigrants Iron the IJ. States who compose  
much of the population of the province, a  
number have actually borne arms against  
the U. States within their limits; some of  
whom after having done so, have become  
prisoners ot war, and arc now in our pos­  
session. The British commander in that  
province nevertheless, with the sanction, as  
oj)p-.*.irs, his g •vertiment, thought proper  
to select from American prisoners of war.  
and send to G. Britain for trial as crnni  
na.s, a number of m &gt;;viduals, who h?d -mj­  
gratt u from the Briiigii dominions long prior  
to the »* ate of war between the iwo nations  
who had incorporated themselves into our  
political society, in iIk* mode* recognized bv  
the law and the practice of G. Britain, ant!  
who were made prisoners of war, under the  
banner* ot their adopted country, fighting  
lor its rights and its safety.  
The pr« te&lt; lit n doe to these citizens re­  
quiring an effectual in erposition in u,- ir br­  
ualf, a like number of British prisoners o!  
war were put into confinement, with a noti­  
fication that they would experience whale  
ver violence might be cmnunct -d on the A­  
merican prisoners uf war sent to Great Bri­  
t ;n It.  
1, was hoped that this necessary conse  
qu Mice of the s&#x27;ep unadvisedly taken on the  
part of Uie at Britain wonbl have led her  
government to reflect on the inconsistencies  
■ t us conduct, and that a sympathy wi p the

Fellow Citizens cf the Senate  
ami oj the 1/oust of Representatives.  
In mett.i.g you . t Hit presert inter*sting  
conjuncture, it would have been highly satis  
■ actory it l coulil have communicated a favora­  
ble result v&lt;»th\ Mission charged with nego  
editions for restoring peace, it was a just ex  
pectation from the respect due to the distin­  
guished Sovereign win* had invited them by  
ins oil* r of mediation, from tlio readiness with  
which tile invitation was accepted on the par.  
ot the United States, and Iroin the pledge to be  
•ounu in an act 01 tneir Legislature lor their  
oeraiiiy which their t&#x27;leiiiporentiarics would  
carry into toe negoci lion , that no time u »,id

the expel intent lor hastening a stop to the cl  
tusiou ot biood. A prompt and cordial accep.  
lance of the Mentation on that side was the less  
to be douoled as it was ol a natureTiot to submit  
rights or pretensions on eitln-r side to the de­  
cision ot an empire, but to ullord merely an op­  
portunity, honorable uiut desirable to both, fur  
I du.cus»nig, ami it |j&lt;&gt;ssii&gt;le aojusling them, lor  
the interest of bolti.  
  
I ne li . iltsli Laomet, ei her mistaking our  
desire ot peaCi for a dread ol llriii.-di power, or  
misled by other fallacious calculations, has dis­  
appointed tins reasonable anticipation. No  
communications from our Envoys having reach­  
ed us, no tntorination on the sunject has bet n  
received I rout that source, llul it is known  
that the mediation was declined in the first  
instance, and tin re is no evidence, notw ith­  
standing itie lapse ot lime, that a change of  
disposition in the British Councils has taken  
place, m is o DC expected.  
Under such c. ctiuist mces, a nation proud  
ot its rights, and conscious pi its sir- n .to, lias  
no emnee but an exertion of the one in support  
ot the otin r.  
To this determination, the* best encourage­  
ment is derived from the success with which  
n li.is p. eased the Almighty to bless our arms,  
botn on the land aiul on Hie water.  
Whilst proofs have been continued of the  
enterprise and skill of our cr izcrs, public k  
private, on the ocean, and a new .rouhy gain­  
ed in the capture ot a British by an American  
ttSrclo! w*r, alter an arlion giving ccleori.y  
to die name ot the victorious comniai.der ; the .  
great inland waters, otiwnich the enen.y were  
also .o be i nconnti ft U, have preat nted aiclnete»  
ineuls of our n.»vul arms, us brilliant hi tneir  
cliarucl&#x27; r as they have been important in their  
cons-quetices.  
O Lake Erie the squadron under command  
&gt;f captain IVrry, having met the British squad­  
ron, ot superior .orce, a sanguinary Conflict en­  
ded m the capture or the whole. The conduct  
oi that officer, adroit as it was dar.ng, and  
winch was so well seconded by hi* comrades,  
justly entitles them to tli- admiration ami gra.  
ti.tideof their country ; and will ti.l an eany  
page in its naval annals, with a vie ory, never  
surpassed in lustre, however much it may have  
been in magnitude.  
On Lake Ontario, the caution of the British  
cotfimander, favored by contingencies, fruslraa  
ted the efforts oi the American commander, to  
bring on a decisive action. Uapt. Chaiincey  
was able, however, to establish an a*c&lt; ndency  
on tout important theatre, and to prove, by the  
manner in which be effected every thing pos­  
sible, that opportunities only were Wanted, for  
a more shining display ot bis own talents and  
of the gallantry of those under his command.  
The success on Lake Erie having opened a  
passage to the territory of the enemy, the ofli­  
ccr commanding the north w cs&#x27;ern army tran --  
ferred the war iliilheri aiul rapidly pursuing  
lh« liosile troops fleeing with their savage as­  
sociates. fbicetl a general action, which quick  
ly terminated in he capture of the British, and  
dispersion ot the- savage force.  
This result is signally honorable to Major  
Genera* Harrison, by whose militarylaments k &#x27;  
was prepared ; *o col. Johnson and his mount***  
volume* rs, Whose in. etuotis onset gave n de­  
cisive blow to the ranks ol the enemy ; anil to  
the spirit ol ihe volunteer militia equally brave  
aiul patriotic, who bore an interesting part in  
tin* scene ; more esptc.all to the chief niagis  
irate o. Kentucky a*, the head ol them, whose  
heroism, signalized in the war which establish  
etl the Independence of his country, sought, at  
a i advanced age, a sh.re in hardships &amp;. bat.  
: ties, fur maintaining its rights and Us safety&#x27;.  
The eBect ot these successes lias In-tn to!  
rescue the inhaimants of ichigan from their  
oppressions, aggravated by gross infractions ot  
lie capitulaiion winch sulj ctcd them to a  
f-reign powers to alienate the savages ot nu­  
merous tiii&#x27;es In id the enemj, by wnom they  
were disappointed and abandoned i and to re­  
lieve an t xtchmve region of country fV*»in a1  
merciless warfare which desolated its frontiers,  
anil imposed on its citizens the most harrus­  
smg services.  
In cons* quence of our naval superiority on  
Lake Ontario, and the opportunity afforded by  
it for concentrating our fo.cts by water, opera  
tious, which had l&gt;e&lt; n previously planned, were  
set on foot, against the possessions of (he ene­  
my on tin/ St. Lawrence. Such however, svas  
.h*- «lciay produced, in the first instance, bv  
advers: weather ot unusual v iolci.ee amd con­  
tinuance, and such the cir* unistances attead­  
mg the final movements of the army, that the  
prospect at one time so favorable, was not re­  
alized.  
  
The cruelty of the enemy, in enlisting the  
savages into a war with a nation desirous of  
mutual emulation in mitigating its calami­  
ties, has notbeen confined to any one quar­  
ter. Wherever they could be turned a­  
gainst 11s, no exertions to effect it have been  
spared. On our South Western border, the  
Creek tribes, who, yielding to our perse&quot;  
veringendeavors, were gradually acquiring  
more civilised habits became the unfortu  
nate victims of seduction. A war in that  
quarter has been the consequece, infuriated  
by a bloody fanticism, recently propagated  
among them.  
It was accessary to crush such a war be­  
fore it could spread among the contiguous  
tribes, and before it could favor enterprizes  
of the enemy into that vicinity. With this  
view a force was called into the service of  
the United States from the stales of Geor  
gia anti Tennessee, which, with the nearest  
regular troops, and other corps from the  
Mississippi territory, might not onlychastise  
the savages into present peace but make a  
lasting impression on their fears.  
The progress of the expedition, as far as is  
yet known corresponds with the martial  
zeal with which it was espoused ; and the  
best hopes of a satisfactory issue are atithy*  
used by the complete success with whiUt a  
well planned enterprise was executed a­  
gainst a body of hostile savages, by a de­  
tachment of the volunteer militia of Ten  
, nessec, under the gallant command of Gen  
  
CofTes; and by a still more import nt vie  
torv over a larger body of them, gained un  
der the immediate command of Major Gen  
Jackson ; uu officer equally distinguished lui  
Ids patriotism and lii&lt;&gt; military talents.  
• he systematic perservance of the eocrm  
iti courting&#x27;he aid of the savages in all quar­  
ters, had the natural effect of kindling their  
rdinary propensity to war into a passion,  
which, even among those best diposed tow  
aids the U. States, was ready, if not cm­  
| .doyed on our side, to be turned against us.  
A departure from cur protracted forbear­  
ance to accept the services tendered by  
diem, has thus been forced upon us. But,  
in yielding to it, the retaliation has been mi­  
tigated as much as possible, both in its ex  
tent and in its character, stopping far short  
••f the example of the enemy, who owe the  
advantages they have i^casionally gained  
in battle, chiefly to the number of their sav  
a^e associates ; and who have not control!  
ed them either from their usual practice of  
indiscriminate massacre on defenceless in  
habitants, or from scenes of carnage with  
out parallel, on prisoners to the Htit&#x27;sli  
tints, guarded by ad the laws of humanity  
and of honorable war.  
For these enormities, the enemy are e­  
quallv responsible, whether with the power  
t&lt;&gt; prevent them they want the will, or with  
the knowledge of a want of power they still  
avail themselves of such instruments.  
Ip other respects the enemy are pursuing  
a course which threatens consequences most  
afflicting to humanity.  
  
A &#x27;tanning law ot G. Britain naturalizes,  
as is well known, nil alien*, complying with  
r.nmli&#x27;.i&#x27; ns limited to a shorter peri id than  
those required by the U States; and natura­  
lized subjects were, in war, employed by her  
government in common Vith iquive subjects.  
In a contiguous British province, regulations  
promulgated since tlu commencement of the  
war compels citizens of the U. States, being  
there under certain circuinstances, to btar  
arms ; whilst ot the native emigrants from  
the U. States who compose much of tlie po­  
pulate n of the province, a nuuiliei have ac  
tually borne arms against the U. States with  
in their limits ; some of whom after having  
done so, have become prisoners of war, and  
are now in our possession.——The British  
commander in that province, nevertheless,  
with the sanction, as appears, of his govern*  
mint, &#x27;.bought proper to select from Ameri­  
can prisoners ol war and send to G Britain  
for trial as criminals, a number ol indiv iduals  
who had err.igra ed from tne British domini­  
ons long prim to the state «&gt;f war between  
the two nations, who had incorporated them  
selves into our political society, in the modes  
recognized by the law and the practice of  
G. Britain, and who were made prisoners of  
war, under the banners *»| their adopted  
country, lighting for its rights and its saiety.  
The protection due to these cisizens re­  
quiring an effectual interposition in their be­  
half, a like number of British prisoners of  
war were put into confinement, widi a notifi­  
cation that they would experience wh never  
violence mi,.ht be committed on the American  
prisoners of war scot to G. Britain.  
It was hoped that this necessary conse­  
quence of the step unai visedly taken on the  
part of Great Britain wnuhl have led her go  
veniment to reflect on the inconsistencies of  
i-s conduct, and that a sympathy with the  
British.it not with the American sufferers,  
would have arrested die ciuel career open­  
ed by its example.  
&#x27;1 his was unl&#x27;r.ppily not the case. In vi  
olatinn both of consistency and of humanity,  
American officers ami non c&lt;niimis.*inned  
officers, in double the number of die British  
soldiers confined here, were ordered into  
close confinement, wjih formal notice, that |  
in the event ot a retaliation for the death  
which n iglit be inflicted on the prisoners  
ot war sent tc Great Britain for trial, the  
officers so confined would be put to death  
also It was notified at the same time that  
the commanders of the British fleets and ar­  
iine-&lt; mi our coasts are,instructed, in the same  
event to proceed with a destructive severi­  
ty against our towns and their inhabitants.  
That no doubt might be left with the en­  
emy ot our adherence to the retaliating re  
sort imposed on us, a correspondent num­  
ber of British olficers prisoners of war in  
our hands were immediately put into close  
confinement, to abide the tate of those con  
fined by die enemy ; and the British govern  
ment has been apprized of the determinati  
on «*t this government, to retaliate any other  
pr. cetding against us, contrary to the legi­  
titnate modes of wartaie.  
It is as fortunate for the United Sates that  
they have it in their power to meet the .n  
euiy in this deplorable contest, as it is hon­  
orable to them, that they do not join in it  
but under the most imperious obligations,  
and with the humane purpose of effectua­  
ting a return to the established usages of  
war.  
The views of the French government on  
die subjects which have been so long com  
milted (o neg&lt;&gt;ciation, have received no elu  
cidation since the close of your late session.  
The Minister Plenipotentiary of tne United  
States a*. Paris had not been enabled, bj p&#x27;fo  
per opportunities, to press the objects of his  
mission, as prescribed by his instructions.  
The miliria lieing always to be regarded  
as the great bulwark of defence and secure  
ty for free states, and the constitution having  
wisely committed to the national authority  
a use of that force, as the best provision a  
gainst an unsafe military establishment, as  
well as a resource peculiarly adapted to a  
country having the extent and the exposure  
nt the United States, 1 recommend to Con  
gress, a revision of the militia laws for the  
purpose of securing, more effectually, the  
services of all detachments called into the  
employment and placed under the govern  
ment of the United States.  
  
It will deserve the consideration of Con­  
gress also, whether, among other improve­  
ments in the militia laws, justice does oot  
require a regulation under due precautions,  
tor defraying the expence incident to the  
first assembling as well as to the subsequent  
movements of detachments called into the  
national service.  
To give to our vessels of war, public and  
private, the requisite advantages in their  
cruises, it is of much importance that they  
should have, both for themselves and their  
prizes, the use of the ports of triendly now  
era. With this view, I recommend to Con­  
gress the expediency of such legal provisi  
ons as may supplv the defects, or remove  
the doubts of the Executive authority to al­  
low to the cruisers of other powers, at war  
with enemies of the United States, such use  
of the American ports and markets as may  
Correspond with the privileges alluwed bj  
such powers to American cruisers.  
  
■ During the year ending on (lie 30th o:  
* September last, the receipts into the Tiva  
• ry h ive exceeded thirty seven millions and  
a half ol dollars, of which near twenty four  
millions were the produce of loans. After  
meeting all the demands for the public ser­  
vice, there remained in the Treasury on that  
day, near seven mi lions of dollars Under  
the authority, contained in the act of the 2d  
of August last, for b irrowing seven million^  
and a half of dollars, that sum has l&gt;ecn ol»  
tainedon terms more favorable to the Uni  
ted States than those of the preceding loan  
made during the present year. Furthti  
sums to a considerable amount will be ne­  
cessary to be obtained in the same w ay du­  
ring the ensuing year ; and from the increas­  
ed capital of the country, from the fidelity  
with which the public engagements na\e  
been kept, and the public credit maintained,  
it may be expected on good grounds • hat  
the necessary pecuniary supplies will not be  
wanting.  
  
I he expences of the current year, from  
ihe multiplied operation falling within, have  
necessarily been extensive. But on a just  
estimate of the campaign, in which the mass  
of them has bren incurred, the cost will not  
be found di-proportionnte to the advantages,  
which have been gained. The campagn  
has indeed, in its latter stages in one quarter,  
been less favorable than was expected, but  
in addition to the importance of our naval  
success, the progress of the campaign has  
bet n filled with incidents highly honorable  
to the American arms.  
The attacks o? the enemv on Cranev Is­  
land, on Fort Meigs, on Sackett&#x27;s Harhor,  
and on Sandusky, have been vigorously and  
successfully repulsed ; n r have they in any  
c--c succeeded on either frontier, excepting  
when directed against the peaceable dwel­  
lings of individua&#x27;s, or villages unprepared  
or undefended.  
On the other hand the movements of the  
American army have been followed by the  
reduction • f York, and of Forts George, v’­  
rie and Malden ; by the recovery of Detroi*  
ami the extinction of the Indian war in the  
West; nr.d by the occupancy nr command  
of a large portion of Upper Canada. Bat­  
tles have also been fought on »he borrders of  
theSf. Lawrence, which though not accom  
plishiog their entire objects, rolled honor on  
the discipline and prowess ofour soldiery,  
the best auguries of eventual victory. In the  
same scale are to be placed the late succes­  
ses in the sc u h over one of the n-ost i ower­  
fnl. which bad become me of the most hos  
tile aisn, of the Indian tribes.  
It would be imptoper to close this com  
municatinti without expressing a thankful  
iicss, in which all ought to unite, for the nu  
merous blessings with which our beloved  
c untry continues to he favored ; for the a  
bundance which overspreads our land, and  
the prevailing health of its inhabitants ; for  
the preservation of our internal tranquility,  
and the stability of our free institutions; and  
above all for the light of divine truth, and  
the protection of every man&#x27;s consc ence in  
the enjoyment of it. And although among  
our blessings ive cannot number an exemp­  
tion from the evils of war ; yet these will ne­  
ver be regarded as the greatest of evils, bv  
•lie friends of liberty, and of the rights of  
nations. Our country has bef re prefrred  
them to the degrading condition which was  
the alternative, when the sword was dmwn  
in the cause which gave birth to our nation  
al independence ; and m&gt;nc who Contemplate  
the magnitude, and feel the value of that  
glorious event, will shrink from a strug­  
gle to maintain the high and happy ground  
on which it placed the American people.  
With all go&lt; d citiacn-.. the justice, and ne  
cessity of iexisting wrongs and usurpations  
no long**# to he borne, * ill sufficiently out  
weigh the privations and sacrifices, inxena­  
rabic from a state of war. But it is a re­  
l!i*ction, moreover, peculiarly consoling, that  
whilst wars are generally at gravated by  
their baneful effects on the internal improve  
meats and permanent prosperity of the na­  
tions engaged in them, such is the favored  
situation of the United States, that the ca­  
lamities of the contest into which they have  
been compelled to enter, are mitigated bv  
Improvements and advantages of which the  
contest itself is the source.  
  
I! &#x27;he war has increased the interruptions  
of our commerce, it has at the same time  
cherished and multiplied our manufactures,  
so as to make us independent of all oil ei  
Countries fwr the more essential branches,  
lor which we oueht to be dependent on none ;  
and i-even rapidly giving them an extent  
which will create additional staples in our  
future intercourse with foreign markets.  
If much treasure has been expended, no  
inconsiderable portion of it has been applied  
to objects durable in tbeir value, &amp; necessary  
to our permanent safety.  
If the war has exposed us to Increased  
spoliations on the ocean, and to predatory  
incursionsontheland.it lias developed the  
national means of retaliating the former, and  
of providing protection against the latter ;  
demonstrating to all, that every blow aim&lt; tl  
at onr maritime independence is an impulse  
accelerating the growth of our maritime  
power.  
But diffusing through the means of the  
nation the elements of military discipline  
and instruction, by augmenting and dtstrib  
uting warlike preparations, applicable to  
future use, by evincing the real anti valor  
with which thev will be employed, and the  
: cheeefulness with which every necessart  
burden will be bon c ; a greater respect for  
our rights and a longer duration of ou&#x27;  
future peace are promised than Could he  
expected without these proofs of the nation*  
al character and resources.  
The war has proved, moreover, that our  
free government, like other free govern  
meats, though slow in its ear&#x27;y movements,  
acquires in its progress a force proportioret!  
to its freedom ; and that the union of the •  
states, the guardian of the freedom and salt  
ty of all and of each, is strengthened by i  
very occasion that puts it to the test.  
In fine, the war, with all its vicissitude­  
is illustrating the capacity and the dcstn  
of the U. States t«be a great, a flourishing  
and a powerf ul nation ; worthy of the friend  
ship which i is cits i used to cultivate wi  
all others ; and authorised, by its own e&gt;  
ample, to require from all an observance  
the laws of justice aad reciprocity. Bcynn­  
these their claims have never extended ; an  
in contending for these, we liehold a subject  
lor our congratulations. In the daily teslimo  
nies of encreasing harmony throughout the  
nation, and m ty humbly repose our trust ir  
the smiles of Heaven on so righteous a cause

enemy were also to be encountered, have presented |  
achievments of our naval arms, as brilliant in their  
character as they have been important in their.con-  
sequences, ; .  
  
On lake Erie the squadron under the command of  
captain Perry, having met the British squadron of  
superior force, a sanguinary conflict ended in the  
capture of the whole. The conduct of that officer,  
adroit as it was daring, and which was so well second-  
ed by his comrades, justly entitles them to the ad-  
miration and gratitude of their country; and will  
fill an early page in its naval annals, with a victory,  
never surpassed in lustre, however much it may have  
been in magnitude.  
  
On lake Ontario, the caution of the British com.  
mander, favored by contingencies, frustrated the ef-  
forts of the American commander to bring on a de-  
cisive action. Captain Chauncy was able, however,  
to establish an ascendancy on that important theatre;  
and to prove, by the manner in which he effected  
every thing possible, that opportunities only were  
wanted, for a more shining display of his own talents  
and of the gallantry of those under his command.  
  
The success on lake Erie having opened a passage  
to the territory of the enemy, the officer command-  
ing the north-western army transferred the war thi-  
ther; and rapidly pursuing the hostile troops fleeing  
with their savage associates, forced a general action,  
which quickly terminated in the capture of the Bri

their plen potentiaries would carry into the negotia-  
ions, that no time would be lost by the British go-&#x27;  
rermment in emdracing tic experiment for hastening |  
a stap to the effusion of biood. A prompt and cor-|  
dial acceptance of the mediation on that side was!  
the less to be doubted as it was of a nature not!

other fallacious calculations, has disappointed this  
reasonable anticipation. No communication from

The efiect of these successes has been to resene

aggravated by cross infraciions of the capitulation

merciless warfare which desolated its frontiers, and

qould favor enterprizes of the enemy into that vicini-  
ty. Wath this view a force was called into the ser-  
yice of the United States, from the states of Geor-  
giaand Tennessee, which, with the nearest regular  
iroops, and other cerps from the Mississippi terri-  
tory, might not only chastise the savages into pre-  
sent peace, but makes a lasting impression on their  
tears.  
  
The progress of the expedition, as far as is yet  
known,corresponds with the martial zeal with which  
it Was espoused ; and the best hopes of a satisfacto-  
ry issue are xuthorised by te complete success with  
which a well planned enterprise was executed  
against a body of hostile savages, by a detachment  
of the volunteer militia of Tennessee, under the  
gailant command of general Coffee ; and by a still  
more important victory overa large body of them,  
gained underthe immediate command of major-ge-  
  
neral Jackson; an officer equally distinguished for  
  
his patriouism and his military talents.  
  
The systematic perseverance of the enemy in  
courting the aid of the savages in all quarters, had  
the natural effect of kindling their ordinary propen-  
sity to War itito a passion, which, even among those  
best disposed towards the United States, was ready,  
ifnot employed on our side, to be turned against us.  
A departure from our protracted forbearance to ac-  
cept the services tendered by them, has thus been  
fo-ced upon us. But, in yielding to it, the retaliation  
has been mitigated as much as possible, both in its  
exteat and in its character, stopping far short of the  
example of the enemy, who owe the advantage they  
have occasionally gained in battle, chiefly to the  
number of their savage associates, and who have  
not controlled them either from their usual practice  
of indiscriminate massacre on defenceless inhabi-  
tants, or from scenes of carnage without a parallel,  
on prisoners to the British arms, guarded by all the  
laws of humanity, and of honorable war.  
  
For these enormities the enemy are equally re-  
spons.ble, whether with the power to prevent them  
  
they want the will, or the knowledge of a want of  
  
power they still avail themselves of such instru-  
ments.  
  
Ii other respects the enemy are pursuing a Course  
which threatens consequences most afflicting to hu-  
manity.  
  
A standing law of Great Britain naturalizes, as it  
well known, all aliens, complying with conditions  
limited to a shorter period than those required by  
the United States; and naturalized subjects, are in  
war employed by her government in common with  
native subjects. In a contiguous British province,  
regulations promulgated since the commencement  
of the war, compel citizens of the United States,  
being there under certain circumstances, to bear  
arms, Whilst of the native emigrants trom the United  
states Who compose much of the population of the  
province, a number have actually borne arms against  
  
the United States within their limits; some of  
  
whom after having done so, have become prisoners  
of war, and are now in our possession. ‘The British  
commander in that province, nevertheless, with the  
Sanction, as appears, of his government, thought  
proper to select from American prisoners of war,  
and send to Great Britain for trial as criminals, a  
number of individuals, who had emigrated from the,  
British dominions long prior to the state of war be-  
tween the two nations, who had meorporated them-)  
  
sclves into our political society, in the modes recog-| themselves and their prizes, the use of the ports of  
  
nized by the law and practice of Great Britain, and!  
who were made prisoners of war, under the banners  
  
of their adopted country, fighting for its rights and  
s2fety,  
  
effectual interposition in their behalf a like number  
of British prisoners of war, were put into confine-  
ment, with a notification that they would experiencé  
whatever violence might be cominitted on the Ame-  
ricen prisoners of war sent to Great Britain.  
  
It was hoped that this necessary consequence of  
the step unadvisedly taken on the part of Great  
Britain would have led her government to reflect on  
the inconsistencies of its conduct, and that a sym-  
pathy with the British, if not with the American  
sufferers, would have arrested the cruel career open-  
ed by its example.  
  
This was unhappily not the case. In violation both  
of consistency and of humanity, American officers  
and non-commissioned officers in double the number  
of the British prisoners confined here, were ordered  
into close confinement, with formal notice that in  
the event of a retaliation for the death which might  
  
e inflicted on the prisoners of war sent to Great  
Britain for trial, the officers so confined woukd be  
put todeath also. It was notified at the same time  
that the commanders of the British fleets and ar-  
mies on our coasts are instructed, in the same event,  
to proceed with a destructive severity against our  
towns and their inhabitants.  
  
That no doubt might be left with the enemy of  
our adherence to the retaliating resort imposed on  
us, a correspondent number of British officers, pri-  
soners of war, in our hands, were immediately put  
into close continement, to abide the fate of those  
confined by the enemy ; and the British government  
has been apprized of the determination of this go-  
vernment, to retaliate any other proceedings. against  
us contrary to the legitimate modes of warfare.  
  
It is as fortunate for the United States that they  
have it in their power to meet the enemy in this de-  
plorable contest, as it is honorable to them, that  
they do not join in it but under the most imperious  
oblivations, and with the humane purpose of effec-  
tuating a return to the established usages of war.  
  
The views of the French government on the sub-  
jects which have been so long committed to negocia-  
tion, have received no elucidation since the close of  
your late session. ‘The minister plenipotentiary of the  
United States at Paris had not been enabled, by pro-  
per opportunities, to press the objects of his mis-  
sion, as prescribed by his instructions,  
  
The militia being aiways to be regarded as the  
zreat bulwark of defence and security for free states,  
and the constitution having wisely committed to the  
national authority a use of that force, as the best  
provision against an unsafe military establishment,  
as well as a resource peculiarly adapted to a coun-  
try having the extent and the exposure of the Unit-  
ed States, I recommend to congress a revision of the  
militia laws for the purpose of securing, more ef-  
fectually, the services of all detachments called  
into the employment and placed under the govern-  
|ment of the United States.  
  
It will deserve the consideration of congress also,  
whether, among other improvements in the militia  
laws, justice does not require a regulation, under due  
| precautions, for defraying the expence incident to  
ithe first assembling as well as to the subsequent  
&#x27;movements of detachments called into the national  
| service.

correspond with the privileges allowed by such pow-|  
ers to American cruisers.  
  
During the year ending the 30th September last,  
the receipts into the treasury have exceeded thirty-  
seven and a half millions of dollars, of which near  
twenty-four millions were the produce of loans. After  
meeting all the demands for the public service, there  
remained in the treasury on that day, near seven mil-  
irons of dollars. Under the authority assigned in the  
act of the 2d of August last, for borrowing seven  
millions and a half of dollars, that sum has been ob-  
tained on terms more favorable to the United States  
than those of the preceding loan made during the  
present year. Further sums to a considerable amount  
will be necessary to be obtained in the same way)  
during the ensuing year; and from the increased |  
capital of the country, from the fidelity with which  
the public engagenients have been kept, and the pub-  
lic credit maintained, it may be expecied on good  
grounds that the necessary pecuniary supplies will  
not be wanting.  
  
The expences of the current year, from the multi-  
plicc operations falling within it, have necessarily  
bse extensive. But on a just estimate of the cam-  
Paign, in which the mass of them has beer incurred,  
the cost will not be found disproportionate to the  
advantages, which have been gamed. The campaign  
has, pideed, in its latter stages in one quarter, been  
less tavorabie than was expected, but in addition to  
our naval success, the progress of the campaign has  
been filled with incidents highly honorable to the  
American arms.  
  
Vie attacks of the enemy on Craney island, on  
fort Meigs, on Sackett’s harbor, and on Sandusky,  
have been vigorously and successfully repuised ; nor  
have they in any case succeeded on either frontier,  
-.cepting when directed against the peaceable dwei-

With all geod citizens, the justice and necessit?  
of resisting wrongs and usurpations no longer to be  
  
| borne, will sufficiently outweigh the privations and,  
  
sacrifices, inseparable from a state of war. But it is  
a reflection, moreover, peculiarly consoling, that  
whilst wars are generally aggravated by their bane.  
ful effects on the internal improvements and perme.  
nent prosperity of the nations engaged im them, such  
is the favored situation of the United States, that the  
calamities of the contest into which they have been  
compelled to enter, are mitigated by improvements  
and advantages of which the contest itself is the  
source.  
  
If the war has increased the interruptions of cur  
commerce, it has at the same ti:me cherished and  
multiplied our manufactures, so as to make us inde-  
pendent of all other countries for the more essential  
branches, for which we ought to be dependent on  
none; and is even rapidly giving them an extent  
which will create additional staples in our future  
intercourse with ioreign markets.  
  
If much treasure has been expended, no inconsi.  
derable portion of it has been applied to objects du-  
m@ble in their value and necessary io our permanent  
safety. ‘  
  
If the war has exposed us to increased spoliations  
on the ocean, and to predatory mcursiens on the  
land, it has developed tlhe national means of reta-  
listing the former, and of providing protection  
against the latter; demonstrating to all, that cvery  
blow aimed at our maritime independence is an im-  
pulse accelerating the growth of our mar.time power.  
  
By diffusing through the mass of the-nation the  
elements of military descipline and instruction, by  
augmenting and distributing warlike preparations,  
applicable to future use, by evincing the zeal and  
valor with which they wili be employed, and the  
cheerfulness with which every necessary burden will  
be borne; a greater respect for our rights and a  
onger duration of our future peace are promised,  
than could be expected without these proofs of the  
national character and resources. ;  
  
The war has proved, moreover, that our free go-  
vernment, like other free governments, though slow  
in its early movements, acquires in its progress a  
force proportioned to its freedoin; and that the union  
of these states, the guardian of the freedom and safe-  
ty of all and of each, is strengthened by every oc-  
casion that puts it to the test.  
  
In fine, the war, with all its vicissitudes, is illus-  
trating the capacity and the destiny of the Uniied  
States to be a great, a flourishing, and a powerful

Fellow citizens of tlie senate,  
  
and of the house of representatives.  
  
In meeting you at the present interesting  
conjuncture, it would liave been highly satis¬  
factory if I could have communicated a fa¬  
vourable result to the mission charged with  
negociations tor restoring peace. It was a  
just expectation from the respect due to the  
distinguished sovereign who had invited them  
by his ofler of mediation, from the readiness  
with which the invitation was accepted on the  
part of the United States, and from a pledge  
to be found in an act of their legislature, fof  
the liberality which their plenipotentiaries  
would carry into the negociations, that no  
time would be lost by the British government  
in embracing the experiment for hastening a  
stop to the efiiision of blood. A prompt and  
cordial acceptance of the mediation on that  
side, was the less to be doubted, as it was of  
a nature not to submit rights or pretensions  
on either side to the decision of an umpire,  
but to aflbrd merely an opportunity, honour-&#x27;  
able and desirable to both, tor discussion, and,’  
if possible, adjusting them for the interest of  
both.  
  
The British cabinet, either mistaking our  
desire of peace for a dread of British power,  
or mislead by other fallatdons calculations,  
has disappointed this reasonable anticipation.  
No communications from our envoys have  
reached us, no information on the subject has  
been received from that source. But it is  
  
THE EXAMINER.  
  
6D  
  
known that the mediation was declined in the  
first instance, and there is no evidence, not¬  
withstanding the lapse of time, that a change  
ef disposition in the British councils has ta¬  
ken place or is to be expected.  
  
Under such circumstances, a nation proud  
of its rights, and conscious of its strength, has  
no choice but an exertion of the one in sup-  
IK)rt of the other. To this determination, the  
best encouragement is derived from the suc¬  
cess with which it has pleased the Almighty  
to bless our arms, both on tlijp land and on the  
water.  
  
Whilst proofs have been continued of the  
enterprise and skill of our criiizers, public and  
private, on tiie ocean, and a new trophy gained i  
in the capture of a British by an American  
vessel of war, after an action giving celebrity  
, to the name cf the victorious commander;  
j the great inland waters, on which the enemy  
! were also to he encountered, have presented  
achievements of our naval arms, as brilliant  
in their character as they have been import¬  
ant in their consequences.  
  
I On Lake Erie, the squadron under command  
of Captain Perry, having met the Britisli  
jfqiiadron, of superior force, a sanguinary con¬  
flict ended in the capture of the whole. The  
I&#x27;onduct of that officer, as adroit as it was da¬  
ring, and which was so well seconded by his  
comrades, justly entitles them to the admira¬  
tion and gratitude of their country, and will  
till an early page in its naval annals, with a  
victory never surpassed in lustre, however  
much it may have been in magnitude.  
  
On Lake Ontario, the caution of the British  
commander, favoured by contingencies, frus¬  
trated the efforts of the American commander  
to bring on a decisive action. Captain Chaun-  
eey was able, however, to establish an ascen-  
cuncy on that important theatre ; and to  
prove, by the manner in which be effected  
every thing passible, that opportunities only  
were wanted, for a more shining display of his  
own talents, and of the gallantry of those  
tinder his command.  
  
The success on Lake Erie having opened a  
passage to the territory of the enemy, the  
officer commanding the northwestern army  
transferred the war thither; and rapidly  
pursuing the hostile troops fleeing with their  
savage associates, forced a general action,  
which quickly terminated in the capture of  
the BHtlsb, and divpersiqn of the savage force.  
  
The result is signally honourable to Major  
General Harrison, by whose military talents  
it was prepared ; to Colonel Johnson and his  
1 mounted volunteers, whose impetuous onset  
gave a decisive blow to the I&#x27;anks of the ene¬  
my ; anil to the spirit of the volunteer militia,  
equally brave and patriotic, who bore an in¬  
teresting part in the scene; more especially  
to the chief magistrate of Kentucky at the  
head of them, whose heroism signalized in tho  
war which established the independence of  
his country, sought, at an advanced age, a  
share in hardships and battles for uiaiutaining  
its rights and its safety.  
  
The effect of these successes has been to  
rescue the inhabitants of Michigan from their  
oppressions, aggravated by gross infractions  
of the capitulation which subjected them to a  
foreign power; to alienate the savages of nu¬  
merous tribes from the enemy, by whom they  
I were disappointed and abandoned; and to re-  
I lieve an extensive region of country from a  
merciless warfare which desolated its fron-  
I tiers, and imposed on its citizens the mo«il  
harrasing services.  
  
In consequence of our naval superiority on  
Lake Ontario, and tlie opportunity afforded  
by it for concentrating our forces by water,  
operations which had been previously planned,  
were set on foot, against the possessions of  
the enemv on the St. Lawrence. Such, how-  
I ever, was the delay produced, in the first in-  
I stance, by adverse weather of unusual vio¬  
lence and continuance, and such the circum¬  
stances attending the final movements of the  
army, that the prospect, at one time so fa-  
I vourable was not realized.  
  
The cruelty of the enemy, in enlisting the  
savages into a war with a nation desirous of  
mutual emulation in mitigating its calamities  
has not been confined to any one quarter.  
Wherever they could be turned against ns, no  
exertions to effect it, have been spared. On  
our southwestern border, the Creek tribes,  
who, yielding to our persevering endeavdnrs,  
were gradually acquiring more civilized ha¬  
bits, became the unfortunate victims of se¬  
duction. A war in that quarter has been the  
consequence, infuriated by a bloody fanati*  
cism, recently propagated among them.  
  
It was necessary to crush such a war before  
it could spread among the contiguous tribes,  
and before it could favour enterprises of the  
enemy into its vicinityi With this view a

^forcc was called ii^o the service of the United  
States, from the states of Georgia and Ten¬  
nessee, which, with the nearest regular troops,  
and other corps fram the Mississippi terri¬  
tory, might not only chastise the savages into  
present peace, hut make a lasting impression  
on their fears.  
  
The progress of the expedition, as far as is  
yet known, corresponds with the martial zeal  
with which it was espoused; and the best  
hopes of a satisfactory issue are authorised  
by the complete success with which a w ell  
planned enterprise was executed against a  
body of hostile savages, by a detachment of  
the volunteer militia of Tennessee, under the  
  
I  
  
gallant command of General Coffee ; and by  
a still more important victory over a larger  
body of them, gained under the immediate  
command of Major General Jackson; an offi¬  
cer equally distins;uished for his patriotism  
and his military talents.  
  
The systematic perseverance of the enemy  
in courting the aid of the savages in all quar¬  
ters, liad the natural effect of kindling their  
ordinaiy propensity to war into a passion,  
w&#x27;hich, even among those best disposed to¬  
wards the United States, was ready, if not  
employed on one side, to be turned against  
us. A departure from our protracted for¬  
bearance to accept the services tendered by  
them, has thus been forced upon us. But, in  
yielding to iU the retaliation has been miti¬  
gated as much as possible, both in its extent  
and in its character, stopping far short of the  
example of the enemy, who owe the advan¬  
tages they have occasionally gained in battle,  
chiefly to the number of their savage asso¬  
ciates ; and who have not controlled them  
either from their usual practice of indiscrimi¬  
nate massacre on defenceless inhabitants, or  
from scenes of carnage w ithout a parallel, on  
prisoners to the British arms, guarded by all  
the laws of humanity and honourable war.  
  
For these enormities, the enemy are equal¬  
ly responsible, whether with the power to  
prevent them, they want the will, or with the  
knowledge of a want of power, they still avail  
themselves of such iustniments.  
  
In other respects the enemy are pursuing a  
course which threatens consequences most af¬  
flicting to humanity.  
  
A standing law of Great Britain naturalizes,  
^1 Is well knpwn, all alieps,. complymg with  
  
conditions limited to a shorter period than  
those required by the United States: and na¬  
turalized subjects are, in war, employed by  
her government in common with native sub¬  
jects. In a contiguous British province, re¬  
gulations promulgated since the commence¬  
ment ot* the war, compel citizens of the Uni¬  
ted States, being there under circumstances,  
to bear arras ; whilst of the native emigrants  
from the United States, who compose much  
of the population of the province, a number  
have actually borne arms against the United  
States within their limits; some of whom af¬  
ter having done «k), have become prisoners of  
war, and are now in our |)Ossession. The Bri¬  
tish commander in that province, neverthe¬  
less, with the sanction, as appears, of his go¬  
vernment, thought proper to select from the  
American prisoners of war, and send to Great  
Britain for trial, as criminals, a number of in¬  
dividuals, who had emigrated from the Bri¬  
tish dominions long prior to the state of war  
between the two nations, who had incorpora¬  
ted themselves into our &#x27;political society, in  
the modes recognized by the law, and the  
pr&lt;actice of Great Britain, and who were made  
prisoners of war, under the banners of their  
adopted country, fighting for its rights and its  
safety.  
  
The protection due to these citizens, re¬  
quiring an effectual interposition in their be¬  
half, alike numlier of British prisoners of war *  
were put into coufinment, with a notification  
that they would experience whatever violence  
might be committed on the American prison¬  
ers of war sent to Great Britain.  
  
It was hoped that this necessary conse¬  
quence of the step unadvisedly taken on the  
part of Great Britain, w&#x27;oiild have led her  
government to reflect on the inconsislencies of  
its conduct, and that a sympathy with the  
British, if not with the American suflerers,  
would have arrested the cruel career opened  
by its example.  
  
This was unhappily not the case. In vio¬  
lation both of consistency and of humanity,  
#Viuerican officers and non-commissioned offi¬  
cers, in double the number of the British sol¬  
diers confined here, were ordered in close con¬  
finement, with formal notice, that in the event  
of a retaliation for the death which might be  
inflicted on the prisoners of war sent to Great  
Britain for trial, the officers so confined would

be put to death also. It was notified at the  
same time, that the commanders of the Bri¬  
tish fleets and armies on our coasts, were in¬  
structed, in the same event, to proceed with  
a destructive severity against our towns and  
their inhabitants.  
  
That no doubt might be left with the ene¬  
my of our adherence to the retaliating resort  
im|)osed on us, a correspondent number of  
British officers, prisoners of war, in our hands,  
were immediately put into close continement,  
to abide the fate of those confined by tjie  
enemy; and the British government has been  
appii^i^d of the determination of this govern¬  
ment, to retaliate any other proceedings  
against us, contrary to the legitimate modes  
of warfare.  
  
It is as fortunate for the United States that  
they have it in their power to meet the ene¬  
my in this deplorable contest, as it is honour¬  
able to them, that they do not join in it but  
under the most imperious obligations, and  
with the humane purpose of effectuating a  
return to the established usages of war.  
  
The views of the French gevernment on  
the subjects which have been so long com¬  
mitted to negociation, have received no elu¬  
cidation since the close of your late session.  
The minister plenipotentiary of the United  
States at Paris, had not been enabled, by  
proper opportunities, to press the objects of  
his&gt;mission, as prescribed by his instructions.  
  
The militia being always to be regarded as  
the great bulwark of defence and security for  
free states, and the constitution having wisely  
committed to the national authority a use of  
that force, as the best provision against an  
unsafe military establishment, as well as a re¬  
course peculiarly adapted to a country having  
the extent and the exposure of the United  
States, I recommend to congress a revision of  
the militia laws, for the purpose of securing  
more effectually the services of all detach¬  
ments called into the employment and placed  
under the government of the United States.  
  
It will deserve the consideration ol‘ con¬  
gress also, whether, among other improve¬  
ments in the militia laws, justice does not re¬  
quire a regulation under due precautions, for  
defVaying the expense incident to the assem¬  
bling, as well as to the&#x27; subsequent move¬  
ments of detachments called into the national  
eerviee.  
  
To give to our vessels of war public and  
private, the requisite advantage in their  
cruises, it is of much importance that they  
should have, both for themselves and their  
prizes, the use of the ports of friendly pow¬  
ers. With this view, 1 recommend to Con¬  
gress the inexpediency of such legal provi¬  
sions as may supply the defects, or remove^  
the doubts of the executive authority to al¬  
low to the cruisers of other powers, at war  
with the enemies of the United States, such  
use of the American ports and markets at  
may correspond with the privileges allowed  
by such powers to American cruisers.  
  
During the year ending on the 30tb of Sep¬  
tember last, the receipts into the treasury  
have exceeded thirty-seven millions and a  
half of dollars, of which near twenty-four  
millions were the produce of loans. After  
meeting all the demands for the public service,  
there remained in the treasury on that day,  
near seven million of dollars. Under the  
authority contained in the act of the 2d of  
August last, for borrowing seven millions and  
a half of dollars, that sum has been obtained  
on terms more favourable to the United  
States than those of the preceding loan made  
during the present year. Further sums to a  
considerable amount will be necessary to be  
obtained in the same way during the ensuing  
year; and from the increased capital of the  
country, from the fidelity with which the pub¬  
lic engagements have been kept, and the pub¬  
lic credit maintained, it may be expected on  
good grounds that the necessary pecuniary  
supplies will not be wanting.  
  
The expenses of the current year from the  
multiplied operations falling within it, have  
necessarily been extensive. But on a just  
estimate of the campaign. In which the mass  
of them has been incurred, the cost will not  
be found disproportionate to the advantages  
which have been gained. The campaign has  
indeed in its latter stages in one quarter, been  
less favourable than was expected, but in ad¬  
dition to the importance of our naval success,  
the progress of the campaign has been filled  
with incidents highly honourable to the Ameri¬  
can arms.  
  
The attacks of the enemy on Craney Island,  
on Fort Meigs, on Sackett*s Harbour, and oo  
Sandusky, have been vigorously and success¬  
fully repulsed ; nor have they in any cas^  
  
THE EXAMINER.  
  
Ibrceeded oo either frontier, excepting when  
directed against the peaceable dwellings of  
individuals, or villages unprepared or unde¬  
fended.  
  
On the other hand the movements of the  
American army have been followed by the  
reduction of York, and of forts George, Erie,  
ind Malden; by the recovery of Detroit  
and the extinction of the Indian war in tlie  
west; and by the occupancy or command of  
a large portion of Upper Canada. Battles  
have also been fought on the borders of the  
St. Lawrence, which, though not accomplish¬  
ing their entire objects, reflect honour on the  
discipline and prowess of our soldiery, the  
best auguries of eventual victory. In the same  
scale are to be placed the late successes in  
the south, over one of the most powerful,  
which had become one of the most hostile  
also, of the Indian tribes.  
  
It would be improper to close this commu¬  
nication without expressing a thankfulness, in  
which al4 ouglit to unite for the numerous  
blessings with which our beloved country con¬  
tinues to be favoured, for the abundance  
which overspreads our land, and the prevail¬  
ing health of its inhabitants ; for the preser¬  
vation of our internal tranquility, and the  
stability of our free institutions; and above all  
for the light of divine truth, and the protec¬  
tion of every man&#x27;s conscience in the enjoy¬  
ment of it.  
  
t  
  
And although among our blessings we can¬  
not number an exemption from the evils of  
war; yet these will never be regarded as the  
greatest of evils, by the friends of liberty,  
and of the rights of nations. Our country  
has before preferred tliem to the degrading  
condition which was the alternative, when the  
sword was drawn in the cause which gave  
birth to our national independence; and none  
who contemplate the magnitude, and feel the  
value of that glorious event, will shrink from  
a stniggle to maintain the high and happy  
ground on which it placed the American peo¬  
ple.  
  
With all good citizens, the justice and ne¬  
cessity of resisting wrongs and usurpations no  
longer to be borne, will sufficiently outweigh  
the privations and sacrifices, inseperable from  
  
state of war. But it is a reflection, more¬  
over, ijjecutiarly consoling, that whilst wars  
  
63 ,  
  
are generally aggravated by their hanefhl  
fects on the internal improvements and per¬  
manent prosperity of the nation engaged io  
them, such is the favoured situation of the &#x27;  
United States, that the calamities of the con¬  
test into which they have been compelled to  
enter, are mitigated by improvements and ad¬  
vantages of which the contest itself is the  
source.  
  
If the war has increased the interrupt ions  
of our commerce, it has at the same time  
clierished and multiplied our manufactures,  
so as to make us independent of all other  
countries for the more essential branches, for&#x27;  
which we ought to be dependent on none, and  
has even rapidly given them an extent which  
will create additional staples in our iliture in¬  
tercourse with foreign markets.  
  
If much treasure has been expended, no in¬  
considerable portion of it has bsen applied  
to objects durable in their value, and neces¬  
sary to our permanent safety.  
  
If the war has exposed us to increased  
spoliations on the ocean, and to predatory in¬  
cursions on the land, it has developed the na¬  
tional means of retaliating the former, and  
for providing protection against the latter;  
demonstrating to all, that every blow aimed  
at our maritime independence is an impulse  
accelerating the growth of our maritime pow¬  
er.  
  
By diflusing through the mass of the nation  
the elements of military discipline and in*-  
struction, by augmenting and distributing  
warlike pieparations, applicable to future  
use, by evincing the zeal and valour with  
which they Will be employed, and the cheer¬  
fulness with which every necessary burden  
will be borne; a greater respect for our rights  
and a longer duration of our future peace are  
promised, than could be expected without  
these proofs of the national character and re¬  
sources.  
  
The war has proved, moreover, that our free  
government, though slow in its early movcj-  
ments, acquires in its progress a force propor-  
tion(;d to its freedom and safety of all and  
of each, is strengthened by every occasion  
that puts it to the test.  
  
In fine, the war, with all its vicissitudes, is  
illiffitrating the capacity and the destiny of  
the U. States to be a great, a flourishing, ax^d a

powerful nation; wortliy of the friendship  
which it is disposed to cultivate with all  
others; and authorized by its own example,  
to require from all an observance of the laws  
of justice and reciprocity. Beyond these  
Cheir claims have never extended; and« in  
contending for these, we behold a subject for  
our congzatulation, in the daily testimonies of  
cncreasing harmony throughout the nation,  
and may humbly repose our trust in the smiles  
of heaven in so righteous a cause.

Fellow Cittzens of the Senate,  
and of the House of Representatives,  
  
In meeting you at the present interesting  
conjuncture, it would have becu highly satis­  
factory if 1 could have communicated a lavor­  
able result to the mission charged with neww­  
ciations for restoring peace. It wa&lt; &amp; just cx­  
pectation, from the respect due to the distin­  
guished sovereign who had invited them Dby  
his offer of ilnvitation, from the readiness  
with which the mediation was accepted on  
the part of the United States, and from the  
pledge to be found 1n an act of tneir Legista­  
ture for the libe ality which their plenipoten­  
tiaries would carry inio the negociations, that  
no time woula be lost by the British govein­  
ment in embracing the experiment for hast­  
cning a stop to the effusionuf blood. A prompt  
and cordial aceeplance vl the mediation on  
that side was less 1o be doubted, as it was of  
a pature not to submit rights or pretensions  
on cither side 1o the decision of an umpire,  
but 10 aferd merely an opportunity honorable  
and desirable 1o boih,for discussiogand if pos­  
sible «djmsting thein for the interesis of both.  
The British Cabinet, €ither mistaking our  
desire of peace for a drend of Binish power,  
or misled by other fallacious calculations, has  
disap pointed this reasonable anticipation. No  
communications from our envoys having  
reached us, no information on the subject has  
been resvived frem that source. DButitis  
known that see mediation was declined in the  
first instance, and there is no evidence, nst­  
withstanding the lapse of time, that a change  
_of disposition in the Binish councils has taken  
place, or 18 to be expected. &#x27;  
Uunder such circumstances, a nation proud  
of its vights and conscious of its strengih, bas  
nn choice but an exertion of the one in sup­  
port of the other.  
  
I&#x27;u tois determination, the best encourage­  
meni 15 de~ived from the success with waich  
it ins pleased the Almighty to bless our  
ars, hoth on the land and on the water,  
  
Whiist preofs have been continued of the  
suterprize and ¥kill of éur cruizers, public  
and private, on the ecean, amnd a new trophy  
gained in the capture of a British by an Ame­  
rican vessel of war, after an action giving ce­  
lebtity Lo the name of the victorious com­  
mander ; the great inland waters, on which  
the eneray were also to be encountered, have  
presentsd achievements of our naval arms, as  
brillisnt in their cheracter as they have been  
important in their consequences.,  
- On Like Erie, the sqdadion under eom­  
mand ol Captain Perry having met the Brit­  
ish squadron, of superior force, a sanguinary  
conflict ended in the capture of the whole.—  
The condact of that ofticer, adroit ay it was  
daring, and which was so well seconded by  
his comreded, justly entitles them to the ad­  
miration and gratitude of their country ; and  
will fill «p carly page in its nuval snoals, with  
A Vlclory bever surpassed in lustre, however  
mueh it may have been in magnitude.  
Ou Lake Ontario, the caution of the Brit­  
ish cominaunder, favored by contingencies,  
frastrated the effris of the American com­  
mander to bravi on a decisive action, Capt  
Chauncey was able however to establish an as­  
cemdancy on that tmportant tNeatre, and to  
prove, Ly the mahner in which he efTected  
every thing possibles that opportunitics only  
were wanted, for a more stining display of  
his own talents and of the gallantiy of those  
upder his command.  
  
. The success on Lake Erie having opened  
a passage to the territory of the enemy, the  
afficer commanding tie north western army  
trapslerved the war thither, and rapidly pur- 1  
siing the hostile troops fleeing with their 1  
siveße associates, fo&lt;ted a general action,  
which quickly terminated in the caprure of !  
the British.and dispersion of the savage force. |  
This rasult is signally honorable to Majors  
General Harrison, by whose military talents ‘  
K was prepared ; to Colonel Johnson and his  
mounted velunteers, whose impetuous onset  
gave @ decisive blow to the ranks of the ene­  
my 3 and to the spicit of the volunteer mililia

the chiel magastrute of Kentucky, at the head

war which estabiished the independence of  
his count:y, soueht, at an advanced age, a  
shate in bardships and batules,lor maintuining

I&#x27;be eflect of these successes has been to  
rescuc the inhabitants of Michigaa from their  
oppressions, apgravated by gross infractions  
of the capltulatzon, which subjected them to  
« forergn power ; to alienate the savages ot  
namerops tribes from the enemy, by whom  
they were disappointed and abandoned ; and  
o reileve an extensive region of country

On our sonin wesiern bordér, the Creek  
tribes, who, yielding 10 our petsevering en­  
deavors, were gradually acquiring more civil­  
ized habits, became the unfortunate victims  
of seduction. A war in that quarter has beea  
the consequence, nfurated by a Qloody luva­  
ticism recently propagsted among them.  
It was pecessary to ciush such a war be­  
fore it could spread among the contiguoud  
tribes, and before it couid favor efiter pMzes  
of the cnewy into tha: vicinity. With this  
view a force was called into the service of the  
United States fromthe States of Georgia and

troops, and other corps from the Missisippi

command of Gen. Coffce ; and Ly a still more  
important victory over a large body of them  
gsined under the immediate command of May.  
Gen. Jackson ; sn officer equally distinguish­  
ed for his patriciism and his @ilitavy talents.  
I&#x27;he systewatio perseverance of the enemy  
in courung the aid of the savoges in all quar­  
ters, had the nataral effect of kindhng their  
ordinary propensity to war into a passion,  
which e¢ven among thosebest disposed lowards  
the United States, was ready, if not employ­  
ed on our side, to be torned against us. A  
departure from our protracted forbedrance to  
accept the services tendered by them, bas thus  
been forced upon us. But. in yielding tv it,  
the retaliation has been mitigated as much as  
vossible, both in its extent and in its charac­  
ter, stopping far short of the example of the  
enemy, woo owe the advantages tiey bave  
occasion2lly .gained in battle, ehicfly 1o the  
pumnber of their savage associates : and who  
have not controlled them either from therr  
usual practice of indiscriminate massacres on  
defenceless inhabitants, or from scenes of  
carnage without a parallely or. prisoners to  
the British arms, guarded by all the laws of  
hu.nanity and of honorable war,  
I&#x27;or these eno:mities the enemy are equal­  
ly responsible, whether with the power to  
prevent them they want the will, or with the  
knowledge of u want of power they still avail  
themselves of such instruments.  
  
In other respects the encmy are pursuing  
a course which threatens consequences most  
afllicting to humanity.  
A standing law of Grreat Britzin naturalizes,  
as is well knowa, all ailens, complying with  
condiiions linnted 10 a shorter period than  
thase required by the United States ; and nat­  
uralized subjects are, in war, employed by  
her guyeinment in common with native sub­  
jeets. In a contiguous British provice, reg­  
ulations promulgated siuce the commences  
ment of the war compel citizens of the U. S.  
beingg there under certain circumstances,  
tu bear arms ; whilst of the native emigrants  
from the Uniied States, who compose much  
of the population ol the province, a number  
have actually burne arms against the United  
Siates within their limits, some of whont, af­  
ter-having done so, have become prisegers of  
war, and are now in our possession. The  
Bri&#x27;ish Commander in that province never­  
theless, with the sanction, as appears, of his  
gavernment, thought propet to select from  
American prisoners of war and send to Great  
Britain, for trial us ctiminals, a number of in­  
dividuals, who hud emigrated from the Brite  
IsM dominions long prior to&quot; the state of war  
between the two nations, who had iacarporat­  
ed themselves into our political society, in the  
modes recognized oy the law and the pructice  
of Great Britein, and who were made prison­  
ers of war, under the banners of their adopt-~  
ed country,fighting for itsrights and its safery.  
The protection due to these citizens requir­  
ing an effectual interposition in their behall, a  
like number of Biitish prisopers of war were  
put iuto cenfinement, with a notification that  
they would expericoce whetever violence  
might be committed on the American prison­  
oners of war sent 10 Great Britain.  
  
It was hoped that this necessary conse­  
quence of the step unadvisedly taken on the  
part of Great Britain would have led her gov­  
ernment to reflect on the consistencies of its  
conduct, and that a sympathy with the Brit.  
ish, if not with the American sufferers,would  
have arrested the cruel career opened by its  
cxample.  
This was unhappily not the case. In vios  
lstion both of consistency and of humanity,  
American oficers and non-cemmissioned offi­  
cers, in double the namber of British soldiers  
configed herey, were ordered iunte close can­  
finement, with formal nm}:e. that i:ihcevmt  
of a retaliation for the death which might be  
inflicted on the prisgners o(?lr sent to Great  
Britain for trisl,the officers So confined would

per vpportuniiles, (v press e vbjects of his  
wission, as presciibed by bis instuciians.  
The miiiiia being aiways to be regarded as  
the great bulwark of defence and security lor

ly commiticd to the natiunsl authority a use  
of that force, as the best provision against an

resource peculiarly adapted to a country hav­  
g the exient and the exposuie of the Uit-

ol the militia laws for the purpose of secur­  
ing, more effectually, the services of all de­  
‘wachments celled o the employment and  
placed under the government of tae United

It will deserve the consideration of Can­  
gress also, whether, aimong other Improve­

To give to our vessels of war, public and

have, both for themselves and thelr prizes,  
the use of the ports ol friendly powers. With  
this view, ! recommend 10 Congiess the ex­  
pediency of such lsgal provisions as may sup­

cecded 27 onthons and a half of doMars, of

seven millions and a half of doilurs, that sum  
has been obtained on ter ms more favorable to  
the United States tian those of the preceed­  
ing lozn made during the present year, Far­  
ther suins to a considerable amount will be  
nacessary Lo be obtalned io the saine way dur­  
iog the easuing year ; and [rom the increas­  
_ed capital of the country, from the fidelty  
with which the public engagements have been  
“dept, and the public ciedit maintained, it may  
‘be expagcted on good grounds that the ncces­  
sary pecuniary supplies will not be waniing.  
The expenses of the current year, from  
the multiplied operations fulling within it  
have necessarily been extensive. Buton a  
just estimate of the campaign, in which the  
‘mass of them has been incurred, the cost wil  
not be found dispropoctionate 1o the advantag­  
es which have beén gained. The campaigo  
has, indeed, in its latter stages, in one quar­  
ter, been less favorable thao was expected  
but in addition to the importance of our na­  
val success, the progress of the ampaign has  
been [illed with incidents bighly honoralle o&#x27;  
the American arms.  
  
The attacks of the enemy on Craney Island,  
on Fort Meigs, on Sacket’s Harbos, and on  
Sandusky, have been vigorousiy and success­  
fully repulsed, nor have they in any case suc­  
cceded on the frontiery, excepting when direct­  
ed against the peaceable dwellings of individ­  
uals, or villages unprepaied or undelended..  
Ou the other hand, the movements of the A­  
merican army have been folioyed by the re­  
duction of York and of Fort George, Eiie and  
Malden ; by the recovery of Detroit and the  
extiction of the Indian war in the west; and  
by the occupancy or command of a large por­  
tion of Upper Canada. Patties bave atso been  
fought on the borders of Ht. Lawrence, which,  
thoughnot accomnplishing iheir entire objects,  
reflect hooor on the disipline&amp;k prowess of our  
soldiery, the best auguries ol eventual victory.,  
In the same scale are to be placed in the late  
successes in &#x27;he south, over one of the most  
powerful, which had become one of the most  
hostile also, of the Indian tribes.  
It would be improper to close this communication  
without expressing a thanktulness, in which all ought  
to unite, for the numerous blesstugs with which our  
betoved country continues to be favored ; for the  
abundaace which overspreads oeur land, and the pre­  
vailing health of its inhabitants , for the preservauon  
of our internal tranquility, and the smbility of our  
Free institutions ; and, above all, for the light of di­  
vine tn’ und the protection of every man’s con­  
science M the enjoy ment of it. And a&#x27;though among  
our bl-ssings we cannot number an exemption from  
the evils o(&quot; war; yet these wili never be regarded as  
the greatest of evils, by the faends of liberty, and of  
the rights of natidns. Our coum? has before pre­  
ferced them to the degradinf condition which was  
the aliernative,when the sword was drawa inthe cause  
wth gave birth to our national Indepcndence ; and  
.n who contemplate the magaitude, wnd feel the  
value of that glorious event, will shriak from a strug­  
re (0 waintain the tigh and happy ground on which  
.4t placed the American people.  
With all good citizens, the justice and necessity  
of m-iuinf wrongs and umT-uom no longer to be  
bone, will suf iently outweigh the privations and  
sagrifices, inseparadle from a state of war. But it is  
a reflection, morcover, peculiarly consoling, that  
whilst wars are generally aggravated by their bane­  
ful effects on t:efintemd improvements and perman.  
ent prosperity of the nations engaged i them, such  
is the favom{ situation of the United States, that the  
ealamities of the contest into which they have been  
compelled to cnter, are aii‘i{atcd by improvements  
and advantages of which the contest itself is the  
fource.  
  
17 war has ingreasc] (he interruptions of oor com­  
meice, it has, at the same Bme, cherished and wul-  
L pusd our manufactures, s 0 as W make us indepe -  
dent of all other couperies for the more esscotiad  
branches, for which we ougla to be dependent on

iy  
..ﬁ‘ t’bc war has exposed us to ivereased spoliations  
on the ocean, and 10 predatory incuisions on the  
land, 1t has ueveloped the national means of retaliat­  
ing the former, aud of providing protection sganst  
Uw latver; demonstrating 10 all, that every blow  
wimed at our maritime indépendence, is an impulse  
accelerrating the growth of our maritime jower.  
By ditfusing through the mass of the nation the  
elements of military discipline and instruclion, by  
sugmenting and distnibuting warlike preparations,  
applicable to future use, by cvincing the zeal and  
vador with which they will be employed, and the  
cheerfulness with which evary necessar) buithen  
will be borne ; a greuter respect for ow nights, and  
a longer daration of our fulure peace are promised,  
thap could be expected without these prools of the  
national character and resources.  
  
Ihe war has proved, moreover, that our free gov­  
ernment, like other free governments, though slow  
I i carly movements, scquires in its progress a  
force proportioned to its freedom; and that the un­  
ion of thesc states, the guardian of the freedom and  
safety of all and of encly, is sirengthened by every  
occasion that puts it 1o the test. |  
In fine,thg war, in all its vicissitudes, with illustrat­  
ing the cupacity wid the destiny of the U. States to  
be a great, a flourishing, aud a powerful nation,

uvate with all others ; and authorisc i, by its own ex.  
ampfe,\u require from all, an observanee of the laws

have never extended ; and m contending for these,  
we behoid a subject for cungratulutions, in the daily  
Lestimonies of creasing hacoory throughout the  
nation; and may humbly repose our trust in the

Fellow Citizens of the Senntt, and of  
the House of Representatives,  
}S inoeting you at the present interesting  
conjuncture, it would have been highly ga­  
tislaclory, it 1 could have communicated a  
lavotable result to the Mission charged with  
nelocutions tor restoring peace. It was a  
just expectation from the respect due to the  
distinguished sovereign who had invited  
them by his offer of mediation, from the  
r aUincss vviln which the invitation was ac­  
cepttu by the United States, and from the  
pledge to be found in an act of their Legis­  
lature tor the liberality which their pleni­  
potentiaries would carry into the negocia­  
tions, that no time would be lost by the Bri­  
tish government in embracing the experi­  
ment tor hastening a stop to the effusion of  
blood. A prompt and cordial acceptance of  
the mediation on that side was the less to  
be doubted, as it was of a nature not to sub­  
mit rights or pretensions on either side to  
the decision of an umpire, but to afford  
merely an opportunity, honorable and desi­  
rable to both, tor discussing, and if possible,  
adjusting them, for the interest of both.  
i’he British cabinet, either mistaking  
our uesire of peace for a dread of British  
power, or misled by other fallacious calcu­  
lations, has disappointed this reasonable an­  
ticipation. *o communications from our j  
Envoys having reached us, no information  
on the subject lias been received from that  
source. But it is known that the mediation  
was declined in the tirst instance, and there  
is no evidence, notwithstanding the lapse  
of time, that a change of disposition in the  
British councils has taken place, or is to be  
axpected.  
  
Under such circumstances, a nation proud  
of its lights, and conscious of its strength,  
has no choice but an efcertion of the one in  
support of the other.  
To this determination, the best encourage­  
ment is derived from the success with which  
it has pleased the Almighty to bless our  
arms, both on land and on the water.  
VVhilst proofs have been continued of the  
enterprize and skill of our cruisers, public  
and private, on the ocean, and a new tro­  
phy gained in the eapture of a British by an  
American vessel of war, after an action  
giving celebrity to the name of the victori­  
ous commander—the great inland waters,  
on which the enemy were also to be encoun­  
tered, have presented achievements of our  
naval arms, as brilliant in their character  
as they have been important in their conse­  
quences.  
On lake Erie, the squadron under com­  
mand of capt. Perry, having met the Bri­  
tish squadron of superior force, a sanguina­  
ry conflict ended in the capture of the whole.  
The conduct of that officer, adroit as it was  
daring, and which was so well seconded by  
his comrades, justly entitles them to the  
admiration and gratitude of their country ;  
and will All an early page in its naval an  
  
mils, with &amp; victory never surpassed in lus­  
tre, however much it may have been in  
magnitude.  
On lake Ontario, the caution of the Bri­  
tish commander, favored by contingencies,  
frustrated the effort* of the American com­  
mander, to bring on a decisive action. Com.  
Chauacev was able, however, to establish  
an ascendancy on that important theatre ;  
and to prove, bv tbe manner in which he  
effected every thing possible, that opportu­  
nities only vvere wanted, for a more shining  
display of his own talents, and of the gal­  
lantry of those under l.is command.  
The success on lake Erie having opened  
a passage to the &#x27;.«rritcry of the enemy, the  
otndfr commanding the north western&#x27;, my,  
transferred the War thither, and rapidjy  
pursuing the hostile troops, fleeing with  
their Savage associates, forced a general ac­  
tion, which quickly terminated in the cap­  
ture of tl.a British, and the dispersion of the  
savage force.  
This result is signally honorable to Major  
General Harrison, by whose military ta­  
lents it was prepared ; to col. Johnson and  
his mounted volunteers, whose impetuous  
onset gave a decisive blow to the ranks of  
the enemy, and to the spirit of the volun­  
teer militia equally brave ami patriotic,  
who bore an interesting part in the scene;  
more especially to the chief magistrate of  
Kentucky at the head of them, whose hero­  
ism, signalised in tl»e war which established  
the Independence of his country, sought, at  
an advanced age, a share in hardships and  
battles, for maintaining its rights and its  
safety.  
The effect of these successes has been to  
rescue the inhabitants of Michigan from  
their oppressions, aggravated by gross in­  
fractions of the capitulation which subject­  
ed them to a foreign power; to alienate the  
savages of numerous t ribes from the enemy,  
by whom they were disappointed and aban­  
doned ; and to relieve an extensive section  
of country from a me rciless warfare which  
desolated its frontiers, and imposed on its  
citizens the most harrassing services.  
In consequence of our naval superiority  
on Lake Ontario, and the opportunity af­  
forded by it for concentrating our forces by  
water, operations, which had been previous­  
ly planned, were set on foot, against the  
possessions of the enemy on the St Law­  
rence. Such, however, was the delay pro­  
duced, in the first instance, by adverse  
weather of unusual violence and continu­  
ance, and such the circumstances attending  
the final movements of the army., that the  
prospect, at one time so favorable, was not  
realized.  
  
The cruelty of the enemy, in enlisting  
the savages into a war with a nation desi­  
rous of mutual emulation in mitigating its  
calamities, has not been confined to any on©  
quarter. Wherever they could be turned  
against us, no exertions to effect it have  
been spared. On the South Western bor­  
der, the Creek tribes, who, yielding to our  
persevering endeavors, were gradually ac­  
quiring more civilised habits, became the  
unfortunate victims of seduction. A war in %  
that quarter has been the consequence, in­  
furiated by a bloody fanaticism, recently  
propagated among them.  
It was necessary to crush such a war be­  
fore it could spread among the contiguous  
tribes, and before it could favor enferpt iy.es  
of the enemy into that vicinity. With this  
view a force was called into the service of  
the United States from the states of Georgia  
and Tennessee, which, with the nearest re­  
gular troops, and other coips from the Mis­  
sissippi territory, might hot only chastise  
the savages into present peace, but make a  
lasting impression on their fears.  
The progress of the expedition, as far as  
is yet known, corresponds with the martial  
zeal with which it. was espoused ; and tha  
best hopes of a satisfactory issue are autho­  
rised by the complete success with which a  
well planned enterprise was executed a­  
gainst a body of hostile savages, bv a de­  
tachment of the volunteer militia of Ten­  
nessee, under the gallant command of Geo,  
Coffee; and by a still more important, vic­  
tory over a large body of them, gained un­

Jackson ; an officer equally distinguished

The systematic perseverance of, the ene­  
my in courting the aid of the savages in all  
quarters, had the natural effect of kindling  
their ordinary propensity to war into a pas­  
sion, whfeh, even arildng those best dispos­  
ed towards the U States, was ready, if not  
employed on our side, to he turned against  
us. A departure from our protracted for­  
bearance to accept the service tendered by  
them, has thus been forced upon us. But,  
in yielding to it, the retaliation has been  
mitigated as much as possible, both in its  
extent and in its character, stopping far  
short «f the example cf the enemy, who  
owe the advantages they hkve occasional­

fenceless inhabitants, orfrom scenes of car­  
n igs without a parallel, on prisoners to the  
Brush arm-., guarded by all the law* of  
humanity and of honorable war.  
, For these enormities, the enemy are e  
qually responsible, wueltier with the power  
to prevent them they want the will, or with  
the knowledge of a want of power they still  
avail themselves of such instruments.  
In other respects the enemy are pursuing  
a cause which threatens consequences most  
afflicting to humanity.  
A standing law of Great Britain natural  
izes, a-, is well known, all aliens, comply­  
ing with conditions limited to a shorter pe­  
riod than tnone required by the United  
Stiies ; and naturalized subjects are, in  
war. employed by her government in com  
inon With native subject*. In a contiguous  
British provin e, regulations promulgated  
since the commencement of the war compel ,  
citizens of the United States, being there j  
under certain circumstances, to bear arms ;  
whilst of the native emigrants from the  
U States who compose much of the popu j  
lation ot the province, a number have ac j  
tually borne arm* against the United States  
within their limits ; some of whom after  
having done so, have become prisoners ofi  
war and are now in our possession. The ;  
British commander in that province, never j  
theless, with the sanction, as appears, of his  
government, thought proper to select from  
American prisoners of war, and sent to  
G Britain for trial as criminals, a ntim  
ber of individuals, who had emigrated  
from the British dominions long prior to  
the state of war between the two nations,  
who had incorporated themselves into our  
political society, in the modes recognized  
by the law and the practice of O. Britain,  
and who were made prisoners of war, under  
the banners of their adopted country, fight­  
ing for its rights and safety.  
The protection due to those citizens re­  
quning an effectual interposition in their  
behalf, a like number of British prisoners  
of war were put into confinement, with a  
notification that they would experience  
whatever violence might be committed on  
the American prisoners of war sent to Great  
Britain.  
  
It was hoped that this necessary conse­  
quence of the step unadvisedly taken on the  
part of G Britain would have led her go  
vernrnent to rellect on the inconsistencies of  
its conduct, and that a sympathy with the  
British, if not with the American sufferers,  
Would have arrested the cruel career open  
ed by its example.  
This was unhappily not the case. In vio­  
lating) both of consistency and of humanity,  
American officers and non commissioned of­  
ficers, in double the number of the British  
soldier# confined here, were ordered into  
close confinement, with formal notice, that  
in the event of a retaliation for the death  
which might be inflicted on the prisoners of  
war sent to G Britain for trial, the officers  
8o confined would be put to death also.  
It was notified at the same time that the  
commanders of the British ileets and armies  
on our coasts are instructed, in the same  
event to proceed with a destructive severity  
against our towns and their inhabitants.  
That no doubt might be left with the ene  
xny of our adherence to the retaliating re  
sort imposed on us, a correspondent num­  
ber of British officers prisoners of war in  
our hands were immediately put into close  
confinement, to abide the fate of those con  
fined by the enemy ; and the British 20­  
vernrnent has been apprized of the deter­  
mination of tins government, to retaliate  
any other proceeding against us, contrary  
to the legitimate modes of warfare.  
It is as fortunate for the United States  
that they have it in their power to meet the  
enemy in this deplorable contest, as it is  
honorable to them, that they do not join  
in it but under the most imperious obliga­  
tions, and with the humane purpose of effect­  
ing a return to the established mages of wa-.  
The views of the French government on :  
the subjects which have been so long com  
mitted to negot iation, have received no elu­  
cidation since the close of your late session.  
The Minister Plenipotentiary of the United  
States at Paris had not been enabled, by  
propofr opportunities, to press the objects of  
his mission, as prescribed by his instruc­  
tions.  
The militia being always to he regarded  
as the great bulwark of defence and seeu  
rity for free states, and the constitution hav­  
ing wisely committed to the national au  
thority a use of that force, as the best pro  
vision against an unsafe military establish  
roent, as well as a resource peculiarly adapt  
ed to a country having the extent and the  
exposure of the U. States, l recommend to  
Congress a revision of the militia laws for  
the pupose of securing, more effectually,  
the services of all detachments called into  
the employment, and placed under the go  
vernrnent of the U. States.  
  
It will deserve the consideration of Con­  
gress also, whether, among other improve­  
ments in the militia law&gt;, justice does not  
require a regulation, under due precautions  
for defraying the expeme incident to the  
first assembling as well as to the subt-e  
quent movements of detachments called in  
to the national service.  
To give our vessels of war, public and I  
private, the requisite advantsge in their  
cruises, it is of much importance that they  
ehould have, both for themselves and their  
priees, the use of the ports ot friendly povv  
ers. With this view, I recommend to Con­  
gress the expediency of such legal provi­  
sions as may supply t ie defects, or remove  
  
low to the cruiifcrs of other powaes, at armr  
with enemies of the U. States, such use of  
the American ports and market as may  
correspond with the privileges allowed by  
such powers to American cruisers.  
During the year ending on the 30th of  
September last, the receipts into the Trea­  
sury has exceeded thirty seven millions and j  
a half of dollxrs, of which near twenty­  
lour millions were the produce of loans.  
After meeting alt the demands for the pub­  
lic service, there remained in the Treasury  
on that day, near seven million of dollars i  
Under the authority contained in the act oi l  
the 2d of August last, for borrowing seven j  
millions and a half of dollars, that sum has  
been obtained on terms more favorable to  
the U. States than those of the preceding :  
loan made during the present year. Fur­  
ther sums to a considerable amount will be  
necessary to be obtained in the same way  
during the ensuing year; ami from the in  
creased capital of the country, from the  
fidelity with which the public engagements  
have been kept and the public credit main­  
tained. it may be expected on good grounds  
that the necessary supplies will not be want­  
ing  
  
Tiie expences of the current year, from  
the multiplied operations falling within it,  
have necessarily been extensive. But on a  
just estimate of the campaign, in which the  
mass of them has bean incurred, the cost  
will not be found disproportionate to the  
advantages, which have been gained. The  
campaign lias indeed, in its latter stages  
in one quarter, -been less favorable than  
was expected, but in addition to the itnpor  
tance of our naval success, the progress of  
the campaign has been filled with incidents  
highly honorable to the American arms.  
The attack of the enemy on Crar.ey Is  
land, on Port Meigs, on Sackett&#x27;s Harbor,  
and on fcanducky, have been vigorously  
and successfully repulsed : nor have they  
in any case succeeded on either frontier,  
excepting when directed against the peace  
able dwellings of individuals, or vilages  
unprepared or undefended.  
On tiie other hand the movements of  
the American army have been followed bv  
the reduction of York, and of Ports George,  
Erie and Malden; by the recovery of De  
troil ami the extinction of the Indian war  
in the west; and by the occupat ion or com  
mand of a large proportion of Upper Can  
ada. Battles have also been foug tt on the  
borders of the St. Lawrence, which, though  
not accomplishing their entire objects, re­  
llect honor on t.he discipline and prowess of  
our soldiery, the best auguries of eventual  
victory. I nr the same scale are to be pla  
red the late successes in the south, over one  
of the m&lt;»st powerful, which had become  
one of the most hostile also, of the Indian  
tribes.  
I. .11 i - :_,l!_ _  
  
It would be improper to close this com  
munication without expressing a thankful  
ness in which all ought to unite, for the nu­  
merous blessings with which our beloved  
:ountry continues to be favoured; for the  
ibundance which overspreads our land, and  
die prevailing health of its inhabitants;  
lor the preservaton of our internal tranquili­  
ty, and the stability of our fiee institutions;  
—and above all f r the light of divine truth,  
»nd the protection of every man&#x27;s conscience  
in the enjoyment of it. And although a­  
mong our blessings we cannot number an  
exemption from the evils of war ; yet these  
will never be regarded as the greatest of  
evils bv the friends of liberty, and of the ;  
rights of nations. Our country has before  
preferred them to the degrading condition !  
which was the alternative, when the sword  
was drawn in the cause which gave birth  
to our national independence; and none  
who contemplate the magnitude, anil feel  
the value of that glorious event, will-shrink  
from a struggle to maintain the high and  
happy ground on which is placed the A  
merican people.  
With ail good citizens, the justice and  
necessity ot resisting wrongs &amp; usurpations  
no longer to he borne, will sufficiently out  
weigh the privation-, and sacrifices, insepar­  
able from a state of war. But it is a re­  
flection. moreover, peculiarly consoling,(that  
whilst wars are generally aggravated by  
their banelul cllerts on the internal improve­  
ments and permanent prosperity of the na­  
tions engaged in them, such is the favored  
situation of the U. States, that the calain  
ities of the contest into which they have  
been compiled to enter, are mitigated bv  
improvements and advantages of which the  
contest itself is the source.  
If the war has increased the interuptions  
of our commerce, it has at the same time  
cherished and multiplied our manufactures,  
so as to make us independent of all other  
countries for the more essential branches,  
for which we ought to be dependent on  
none ; and is even rapidly giving them an  
extent which will create additional staples  
in our future intercourse with foreign  
markets.  
If much treasure has been expended, no  
inconsiderable portion of it has been ap  
plied to objects durable in their value, and  
necessary to our permanent safety.  
If the war has exposed us to increased  
spoliations on the ocean, and to predatory  
incursions on the land, it has developed  
(he national means of retaliating the for­  
mer, and of providing protection against  
the latter ; demonstrating to all, that eve­  
ry blow’ aimed at our maritime imlepend  
ence is an impulse accelerating the growth  
of our maritime power.  
By diffusing through the mass of the na  
tion the elements of military discipline and  
  
mg warlike preparation*, applicable to fu­  
ture use, by evincing the zeal and valor  
with which they will be employed, and tiie  
cheerfulness with which every necessary  
burden will be borne; a greater respect  
for our rights and a longer duration of our  
future peace are promised, than could be  
expected without these proofs of the na­  
tional character and resources.  
The war has proved, moreover, that |  
our free government like other free go  
vernments, though slow in its early move­  
ments, acquires in its progress a force pro­  
portioned to its freedom ; and that the uni­  
on of these states, the guardian of the  
freedom and safety of all and of each, is  
strengthened by every occasion that puts  
it to the test.  
In fine tne war, with all its vicissitudes,  
is illustrating the capacity and the destiny  
of the U. States to be a great, a flour­  
ishing, and a powerful nation ; worthy of  
the friendship which it is disposed to cul  
tivate with all others, and authorised, by  
its own example, to require from all an  
observance of the laws of justice and re  
ciproeity. Beyond these their claims have  
never extended ; and, in contending for  
these we behold a subject for our rongratu  
lations, in the daily testimonies of ent-ieas­  
ing harmony throughout the nation, and  
may humbly repose our trust in the  
smiles of Heaven on so righteous a cause

To this determination, the best en  
couragement is derived from the sue-  
cesi with whrh it has pleaded thr  
Almihtv to blenh our . rns, both on

on which the cxiemy were also in be  
encountered, have presented athiev­  
nents of our naval arms, as brilliant  
in their character as they have been  
Wimm in t: tr consequences.  
On I.-kc Enc,te quadron under  
command of Capt. Perry, having met  
the British squadron, of superior  
force, a sanguinary conflict ended in  
the capture of the whole. : The con­  
duct of that r.Ecer, adroit as it was  
daring, and which was so well se­  
conded b? his comrades, justly enii.  
ties them to the admiration and grati.  
tadcol their counr&#x27;&#x27; ; and will hi; an J  
erly rwge in its naval annals with a  
victory, oever surpassed in lustre,  
however much it may have been in  
magnitude.  
t)n lake Ontario, the caution of the  
British commander, favo-ed by con  
ucgencies, frustrated tne cttect ot the  
Ameiicvn cornmander, to bring on p  
dtcisive action. Captain Ch&#x27;iunte&#x27;v  
was able, however, to establish au  
ascendancy on that important theatre  
and to prove, by the manner in  
which he effected every thing possi  
ble$ that opportunities only were want­  
ed, for a more shining display of his  
own tafents and of the gallantry of  
those under his commiorl.  
The success oa Lake Erie having  
opened a passage to the territory of  
  
the enemy, the ASiccr coramandioR  
the north western army transferred  
the war thithtr ; and rapidly pursuing  
the hostile troops fleeing with their  
  
m (  
  
Uavajrc assocUtrs, forced a general  
: j action, which quickly terminated id  
tne capture oi me orrusn, aau unii

Thistetultis signally honorable to  
M ijor General ttirrison, by whose  
military nlents it was prepared ; to

teers, whase impetuous onset gave a  
derisive blow to the ranks of the ene.

who bore an interesting part in the

. r . . , f  
&quot;3gtsuate of Kentucky at the head of  
them, whose hercism, signalized in  
the war which established the inde  
dependence of hi country, sought, at  
an advanced age, a chare in hardships  
and battle, for maintaining its rights  
and its safety.  
The effect of these successes has  
been &quot;to rescue the inhabitants of M?-  
chigan from their oppressions, aqgra-l  
vated by gross infractions of the ca- j  
pitufotion which subjected them to a !  
foreign p -wer ; to alienate the sava- J  
esot numerous trihe from the ene  
my, by whom they were disappointed  
and uomdontd ; and to relieve an  
extensive region of country from a  
merciless warlare which desolated its  
frontiers, and imposed on its c.ti­  
zens the moat harassing services.  
In consequence of our naval supe­  
riority on L.ske Ontario, and the op­  
portunity afforded by it for conccn.  
2tr.tting our forces by water, opera.

rencr. Such . however, was the uehv  
produced, in the firt instance, by  
advfrsr -eather of ungual violence  
ind c oJ.iuanc, and suh the cir­  
cumstances attending the final move­  
rnmts oi the army, that the prospect,  
at one time so -favorable was not re­  
alized.The cruelty of the enemy in enlis­  
ting the savages into a war with a na­  
tion desirous of mutu.d emulation in  
mitigating ita calamities, h is not been  
confined to any one quarter. Where  
ever they could be turned against u,  
n&#x27;. exertions to effect it have been  
ipartd. On our South Western bor­  
iler, the Creek tribes, who yielding to  
our persevering endeavors, were gra­  
dually acquiring more civilized habits  
became the unfortunate victims of  
seduction. A war. in tlvat quarter  
hai been the consequence, infuriated  
j bv a bloody fanaticism, recently pro  
pagated among them.  
It was necessary to crush fcuch a  
war before it could spread among the  
contiguous tribe, and before it could  
favcr entcrprizes of the enemy into  
that vicinity. With this view a force  
was called into the service of the U.  
nitcd States from the states of Geor­  
gia and Tennessee, which, with the  
nearest regular troops, &amp; .other corps  
from the Mississippi territory might  
not only chastise thesavagci into pre­  
sent peace, but make a lasting im­  
pression on their fears.  
The progress of the expedition, as  
far as is yet known, corresponds with  
the martial zeal with which it was es­  
poused and the best hopes of a satis  
factory issue are authorised by the  
complete success with which a well  
planned enterpf ize. was executed a a­  
gainst a body of hostile Ravages by a  
detachment ot the volunteer militfa  
ol reunesee, under the gall Mt com­  
mand ot General C&#x27;. (Fee- and by a  
atill more .important victor over a  
a larger body of them, gained under  
the immediate c:imm nd &#x27;of&#x27; Major  
G n. Jackson m offi cr equally dis­  
tinguished for his patriotism, and his  
military talents.- &quot;  
The systematic perseverance of  
-the enemy in courting the aid of the  
savages in a 1 quarters., had tne natu­  
ral effect of kindling their ordinary  
nronnVifV to wgr-into a passion,  
which even -imong thoe best disposed j  
tow rda tr;: U. S. was ready, it not  
emptyeJ on our side, toe turucd j:  
acrainst us- A departure from ur I  
  
dep  
  
protracted forbearance to accept the&#x27;  
rvire tendered bv them, has tHus  
  
been forced upon us. But, in yield  
- . n . Ml  
ing to it,he retaliation has been mi- j  
its extent &amp; tn its character, stopping  
far short of the exanjple of the ene-!  
my, who owe the advantages they  
have occasionally gained in &#x27;battle, j  
chiefly to tac number ofitheir savage: j  
associates and who hive not coo-J  
trolled them either from! their usual  
practice of !Bdiscrirainatmassacre on j  
defenceless inhabitants, or rrom  
scenes of carnage without a parallel,  
on prisoners to the British arm&#x27;s,  
guarded by all the laws of httoaanity  
and of hjjfjrable war. &quot;  
. For these enormities, the enemy  
are equally responsible whether with  
the power to prevent them they want  
the will, or with , the knowledge of a  
want of power they still avail them­  
selves of such instruments.  
In other respects the enemy are  
pursuing a course which threatens  
consequences most afHicting to. hu  
manity, j  
A standing law of Great Britain ,  
naturalizes, as is weil known, a&#x27;l - j  
liens, comnlvtn&#x27;z with conditions li-  
mited to a shorter ptriod tha i those i  
required by tlie United States and  
naturalized subjects are, in war, em- &#x27;  
ployed by her gr.veromeriL in com-;  
moo wi;h native su&#x27;ue,::s. In a con- i  
tiuous Briti h P.oyin. e, regulations j  
promulgated since the commence.  
mint of the w:r compt-l citizens of I  
the United St-ites, b?ing vhere under  
certain ctr um-itance3, to bear arms  
wmUt of the nitjve emigrants from  
the United States who compose much  
of the popui itt n f the province, a  
number have a:tuaH borne arm a-  
; gainst th-s United Swires within their  
limits s me of whom after having  
done so have become prisoners of  
war, &amp;3Tnow in our possession.  
The British commander in that pro­  
vince, ncverthelrss with the sanction  
as appcaas of his government, tho&#x27;t  
proper to select from American pri­  
uo.iers ot war, and send to Grva: Bri­  
tain for trial as criminals, a number  
of individuals, v:ho had emigrated  
from the Briiish dominions long pri  
or to the state pi war between me j  
two nations, who ha. I incorporated  
themselves into our political society  
io the modes recognized bv the law  
and the practice of Great Britain, &amp;  
who were made prisonersf war, un-J  
derthe banners of their adopted  
Country, fighting for itsV rights and  
its safety.  
The protection due to these citi­  
zens requiring an effectual interpo­  
sition in their behalf, a like nuanber of  
British prisoners of war were put io  
to coonuemrot, with a notification  
that they would experience whatever  
violence might be committed on tne  
American prisoners of war sent to  
Great Britain  
It was hoped that this necessa­  
ry consequence of the step unad­  
viseablv taken on the part of Great  
Britain would have led her govern  
ment to reflect on the inconsisten­  
cies of its conduit and that a sympa  
thy with the British, if not with the  
American sufferers, would have ar­  
rested the cruel career opened by its  
example.  
This was unhappily not the case  
In violation both of consistency and  
of humanity, American&#x27; officers and  
non-commissioned officers, in double j  
the number of the British soldiers  
confined here,were ordered into close  
confinement, with formal notice, that  
in the event of a &quot; retaliation for the  
death which might be inflicted on the  
nrisoners of war sent to Great Bri  
tain for trial, the officers so confined j  
would be put to death also It was  
notified at the time that the comman­  
ders ofthe&quot; British Beets and armies  
on our coasts are instructed, in the  
sme &#x27;event, to proceed with a de­  
structive severity &#x27;against our towns  
and their inhabitants.  
That no doubt might be left with  
I the enemv of ouradherence to the re  
H taiatihgf resort imposed on us, a cor-  
respondent number of British officers  
prisoner bF vrar in oar hands were  
  
immediately put into close confine  
iment, to abide the fate of those confi-  
  
ned by the enemy. ; and the British  
government has been apprized of tre  
determination of this government, to  
retaliate any other proceeding against  
us, contrary to the legUimatfe mode  
of warfare. &#x27;:.  
. It is as fortunate for the United  
States that they have itin their pow­  
er to meetthe enemy in this depiom-.  
ble contekt, as itisiiooorable to tKem  
that they do not join in it but undf r  
the most imperious obligations, -and  
with the humane purpose or effectu­  
ating a return to the established asa-  
ges of war. - (  
The views of the Frefichgovern.  
raent oq the subjects which h vt btn  
so long committed , to negociation,  
have received no elucidation since  
the close of your late 8638100. The  
Minister Plenipotentiary of the 0.  
States, at Paris had not been enabled,  
by proper opportunities, to press the  
object of his mission, a prescribed  
by his instruction.  
The militia being always to be re  
garded as the great bulwark of de  
fence andsecunty for tree states, and  
the constitution having wisely &#x27;com  
mitted to the national authority a use  
of thst force, as the best provision a  
gainst an unsafe military establish­  
ment, as well as a resource peculiarly  
adapted to a country having the ex­  
tent and the exposure ot the XI S.  
I recommend&#x27;to Congress a revision  
of the militia laws for the purpose of  
securing more effectually, the services  
of all detachment called into the em­  
ployment and placed under the gov­  
ernment of the United States.  
It will deserve the consideration of

improvem-nts in the militia laws, jus-J

To give to our vessels of war, pub

tage in their cruises, it is of much  
i mportance that they should have both

Withthis vjew I recommend to Con­  
gress the expediency of such leg d  
provisions as may supply the defects  
or remove the doubts of the exeeir  
tive authority, to1 allow the cruiters  
of other powers at war with theene-mies-jpf

of the American ports and markets  
as may correspond with the &quot;privile­

During the year ending on the 50th  
f Septemler last, the receipts into  
&#x27;he Treasury have exceeded 37 mil­  
lions and a hslf&#x27;of dollars, of which  
near 524,000,000 were the produce  
of loans Afte- meeting all the de­  
mands for public service, there re­  
mained in the Treasury on that day  
near g7l000.000. Under the autho­  
rity contained in the act of the 2d of  
of August last, for borrowing seven  
millions and a half of dollars, that  
sum has been obtained on terms more  
favorable to . the&#x27; United States&#x27; than  
those of the preceding loan made du­  
ring the present year.&#x27; Further sum­  
to a considerable amount will be ne  
cessarv to-be obtained in the same  
way during the ensuing year and,  
from the increased, Capital of the

tensive. But on a just estimate oFthe  
campaign, iri wnich the; mass of them  
have been incurred,, the cost will ?not  
be found disproportionate to the ad­  
vantages which have been gained.The  
campaign has indeed, in its latter sta­  
ges, in one garter, been, less favora­

To give to our vebsds of war, public and pri­  
vate, the requisite advantage iu their cruises,  
it i. of much importance that they should have,  
both for themselves and their prizes, the use  
of the ports of friendly powers. With ihis  
vi cw, I recommend to Congress the expedien­  
cy oi such legal provisions as may supply ihe  
defects, or remove the doubts ot the Execu­  
tive authority to allow to the cruisers ot othei  
powers, at war with the enemits of the Uni­  
ted States, such use of the American ports  
and markets as may correspond with the pri­  
vileges allowed by such povvcto to American  
ciutsers.  
Daring the year ending on the 30th of Sep  
  
tember last, the receipts into the Treasury have  
exceeded thirty seven millions and a hall cl  
dollars, of which near twenty four millions  
were the produce of loans. After meeting ah  
the demands tor the public service, there re­  
mained i,n the Treasury on that day, near se­  
ven millions of dollars. Under the authority  
contained in the act of the J,u of August last,  
for borrowing seven millions and a half of uui­  
lars, that sum has been obtained o.i levins more  
favorable to the United States than &#x27;those ol

gaineJ under the in}tncdl.atc comiu.ii.b of  
Major Gen. Juikson, an cfficei- equally disti:.-  
guished for his patriotism and Ins militaiv  
talents.  
  
Tlie systematic perseverance of the enemy in  
courting the aid of the sav.ages in all quarters,  
had tire natural effect of kindling their ordi-  
nary propensity to war into a |ias.sion, which,  
even among those best disposed toward.-, tin:  
U, Slates, Was ready, if not employed on our  
side, to be turned against us. A dep;.i ture  
from our protracted forbearance to accept the  
services tendered by them, has thus been forc-  
ed upon us. But, in yielding to it, the retali-  
ation has been mitigated as much as possible,  
both in its extent and iri its character, slop-  
ping far short of the example of the ciieniy,  
who owe the advantages they liavc occlisioiit  
ally gained in battle, chiefly to the number of  
their savage associates ; and who have not con-  
trolled them either from their usual practice  
of indiscriminate massacre on defenceless in-  
habitants, or from scenes of carnage witlimit a  
parallel, on prisoners to the British arms, gii.ir-  
ded by all the laws of humanity and of liuiiura-  
ble war.  
  
For these enormities, the enemy arc equally  
responsible, whether wilii the po-.-.-er to pre-  
vent them they want the will, or with the;  
knowledge of a want of power they still avail  
themselves of such instruments.  
  
In other respects the enemy are pursuing a  
course which ihreatens consequences most af-  
flicting to liunianity.  
  
A standing law o&#x27;f Great Britain naturalizes  
as is vyell known, all aliens, complviiig will,&#x27;  
conditions limited to a shorter period than  
those refjtiired by the U. Stales ; and natural,  
ized subjects are, in war, emplo&gt;i d by her go.  
vernment in common with native subjects, lii  
a contiguous British province, regulations pro-  
mulgated since the commencement of the war  
compels citizens of the C. S being there under  
certain circumstances, to bear arms ; whilst of  
the native emigrants from the U.S. who compose  
much of the population of the province, a num-  
ber have actually borne arms against thelJ S  
within their limits; some of whom, after li.ivl  
ing done so, have become prisoners of war  
and are now in our pos.session. The British  
commander in that province, nevertheless, with  
the sanction, as appears, of his government,  
thought proper to select from American pri!

by the law and tile practice of Great Britain  
and who were made prisoners of war, under  
the banners of their adopted country, fightine-  
for Its rights and its salety.  
  
^ The protection due to these citizens requir-  
ing an efl&#x27;ectual interposition in their behalf

put into confinement, with a notification that  
ffley would experience whatever violence might  
be committed to tlie American prisoners of  
w&#x27;ar sent to Great Britain.  
  
It was hoped that this necessary consequence  
ol the step unadvisedly taken lin the part of  
Great Pritain would have led her |^overnm&#x27;ertt  
to reflect on the inconsistencies of its conduct,  
and that a sympathy with the British, if not  
With the American siifterers, would have ar-  
rested the cruel career opened by its tiaoiplc  
This was unhappily not tlie case. In viola-  
tion both of consistency and of humanity, .A-  
meric.in officers and non-commissioned officers  
in double the number of the British soldiers  
conhned here, were ordered into close coiffinc-  
meiit. With formal notice that in the event of a  
retaliation for the deatli which might be i„.  
tlicted on the prisoners of war sent to Great  
Britain for trial, the officer* so confined would  
be put to death also. It was notified at the  
same time that the commanders of the Bri-  
tUh fleets and arm ies on our coasts are instruct-  
ed, in the same event, to proceed with a des  
tructive severity against our towns and their  
inhabitants.  
  
That no doubt might be left with the enemy  
ot our adherence to the retaliating resort im-  
posed upon us, a correspondent number &lt; f Bri-  
tish officers prisoners of war in our hands vere  
i^mmedialely put into close confinement to a-

conduct of that officer, adroit as well as dar-  
ing, and which was so well seconded by his  
comrades, justly entitled them to the admira-  
tion and gratitude of tlieir country; and will  
fill an early page in its naval annals witli a  
victory never surpassed in lustre, however  
much it may have been in magnitude.  
  
On Lake Ontario, the caution of the British  
commander, favored by contingencies, frus-  
trated the efforts of the AmeFican commander  
to bring on a decisive action. Captain Cfiaun-  
cey was able, however, to establish an ascen-  
dancy on that important theatre; and to prove,  
by the manner in whicli he effected every thing  
possible, that opportunities only were wanted,  
for a more shining display of his own talents  
and of the gallantry of those under his eom  
mand.  
  
The success on Lake Erie having opened a  
passage to the territory of the enemy, the offi-  
cer commanding the north western army trans-  
ferred the War thither; and rapidly pursuing  
the hostile troops fleeing with their savage as-  
sociates, forced a general action, which quick-  
ly terminated in the capture of the British,  
and dispersion of the savage force.  
  
This result is signally honorable to Major  
Oencral Harrison, by whose military talents it  
was prepared ; to Colonel Johnson and his  
mounted volunteers, whose impetuous onset  
gave a decisive blow to the ranks of the ene-  
my ; and to tlie spirit of the volunteer militia  
equally brai&#x27;e and patriotic, who bore an in-  
teresting part in the scene; more especially

tending the final movements of the army, that  
the prospect, at one time so favorable was not  
realised.  
  
The eeiielty of the eiieniy, in enlisting the  
savages mto a war with a nation desirous of  
mutual emulation in mitigating its calamities,  
has not been confined to any&#x27; one quarter.  
  
Wherever they could he turned against us, no  
exertions to effect it have been spared. On  
onr Scutli Western border, the Creek tribes,  
who, yielding to our persevering endeavors,  
w&#x27;ere gradually .acquiring more civilised habits,  
became the uiifonunate victims of seduction.  
  
A war in that quarter his been the conse-  
quence, infuriated by a bloody fanatacism, re-  
cently propagated among Ihi m.  
  
It was necessary to crush such a war before  
it could spread among the contiguous tribes,  
and befor# it could favor enlerprizes of the en-  
emy. With this view a force was called into  
the service of the United States from tlie states  
of Georgia and Tennessee, wliich, wiili the  
nearest regular troops, and other corps from  
the .Mississippi territory, might not only chas  
tise the savages into present peace, but make  
a Wing impression oil tlifir fears.

be expcrti cl on poud g’nmmls that the neces-  
sary pecuniary supplies will not be wantif.i^.  
  
The expence of the current year, tiom the  
multiplied operations laUin}j witltin it, hav-  
ir ccssarily been extensive. Hut on a just es-  
1 unate of the camp.afi&#x27;n, iii which the mass o(  
them has been incurred, the cost will imt be  
liiimd disproportionate to the advant.a^es,  
  
V, liiclt have lieen fraine&#x27;d. The campaijpi has  
indeed, in i*.s IrtV-r stapes in one quarter, been  
less favorable than was expected, but in addi-  
tion to the iniportnnce of our naval success,  
the progress ol the canqiaipn has been filled  
with mcidcuUuiglily honorable to the -\meri-  
caii aims. .  
  
The attack &#x27;of the enemy on Craney Island,  
on Kort N&#x27;- &#x27;ps, on Sacketi’s Harbor, and on  
Sandusky, have been vigorously and success-  
fully rcpiilsed j nor have they in any case suc-  
ceeded on either fi-ontier, excepting when di-  
rected against the peaceable dwellings of&#x27;indi-  
viduals, or villages uiipi-epared or undefended.  
  
On iheotlier hand the inomements of the .\-  
merican army have been followed »y the reduc-  
tion of York, and of Forts George, Krieand  
Malden ; by the recovery of Detroit and the  
extinction of the Indian war in the West ; and  
by the ncciipancy or command of a large por.  
Jion of l.tpper Canada. Hatties have also been  
fought on the borders of tlie St. I.awrence,  
which, tlioiigh not accomplishing their objects,  
fcHcct honor on the discipline and powers of  
our sold iery, the best auguries of eventual vic-  
tory. In the same scale are to be placed the  
late successes in the south, over one of the  
moet powerful, which bad become one of the  
most hostile also, of the Indian tribes.  
  
It would be improper to close this commu-  
nication w ithout expressing a thankfulness, in  
■which all ought to unite, for the numerous  
blessings with wliich our beloved country con-  
tinues to be favored ; for the abundance which  
overspreads our land, and the prevailing health  
of its inhabitants ; for the preservation of our  
internal tr.anquility, and the stability of our  
tree institutions : and above all for tiie light  
of divine truth, and tHe protection of every  
man’s conscience in the enjoyment of it. And  
although among our blessings we cannot num-  
ber .an exemption iVom the evils of war ; yet  
■these will never be regarded as the greatest of  
evils, by the friends of liberty ami of the  
rights of nations. Our country has before  
preferred them to the degrading condition  
whir.li was tlie alternative, when the sword  
was drawn in the cause which gave birth to  
our national independence ; and none who  
rontcmplate the magiilludc, and feel the value  
cfth.it glorious event, will shrink from a strug-  
gle to maintain the high and h»ppy ground on  
which it placed the American People.  
  
With all good citizens, the justice and ne-  
cessities of resisting wrongs &amp; usurpations no  
longer to be borne, will sufficiently outweigh  
the privations and sacrifices, inseparable from  
a slate of war But it is a reflection, moreo-  
ver, peculiarly consoling, that whilst wars  
are generally aggravated by their batieful ef-  
fects on the&#x27; internal improvements and per-  
manent pi&#x27;osperity of the nations engaged in  
them, such is the favored situation of the U.  
States, that the calamities of the contest in-  
to wliicli they have been compelled to enter,  
are mitigated by improvements and advanta-  
ges of which the contest itself is the source.  
  
If the war has increased the interuptions of  
eur commerce, it has at the same time cher-  
ished and multiplied our m.anufactures, so as to  
make us independent of .all other countries for  
Die more essential branches, for which we  
•light to be dependent on none ; and is even  
rapidly giving them an extent which will cre-  
ate additional staples in our future Intercourse  
with forclgn mat kets.  
  
If much treasure has been expended, ho in-  
considerable portion Of it bus been applied to  
•hjecis durable in their value, and necessary  
f&lt;&gt; our permanent safety  
  
If the war lias expoied Us to increased .spo-  
Fiatious on the ocean, and to predatory incur-  
sions on the land, it h:is developed the nation-  
al means of retaliating the former, and provid-  
ing protection against the latter ; demonstrat-  
ing to all, that every blow aimed at our mari-  
time independence is an impulse accelerating  
the growth of our maritime power.  
  
Hy difl naing through the mass of the nation  
the clenieiits of military discipline and instruc-  
tion, by augmenting and distributing warKke  
prepfiratjons, applicable to future use, by evin-  
cing the zeal aitd valor with which they will  
be employed, and the cheerfulness with which  
•very necessary burden will be borne : a great-  
er respect for our rights and a longer duration  
of our future peace are promised, than could  
be expected without these proofs ot tlie na-  
tional character .and resources.  
  
The war has proved, moreover, that our  
free government, like other free governments,  
though slow in its early movements, acquires  
ill its progress a force proportioned to its free-  
dom ; and that the union of these states, the ■  
giianiiao of the freedom and safety of all  
and of ca«h, is strengtliened by every octasioh  
‘Jiat puts it to tlie test.  
  
In fine, the «&#x27;ar, with all its vicissitudes; is  
llliiBlratinglhecaiiacity and the destiny of the  
V. States to be a great, a flounsliing, and a  
powerful nation ; worlliy ot the friemlship  
which it is disposed to cultivate with all oth-  
ers, and authorised, by its Own example, to re-  
quire frorri all an observance of tlie laws of  
justice and reciprocity. Ueyond these tlieir  
claims hii&#x27;.e never extended ; and, 111 contend-

gnitulationi, in the daily testimonies of cn-

‘* For these enormities, the enemy are equally responsible,  
whether, with (he power to prevent them, they want the wil);  
or, with a knowledge of the want of power, they still avail  
themselves of such instruments, In other respects, the enemy  
are pursuing a course which threatens consequences most afflict.  
ing io humanity. A standing law of Great Britain naturalises,  
as is well known, all aliens employed, with conditions limited  
toa shorter period than required by the United States, and  
naturalised subjects are in war employed by her Gevernment  
incommon with native subjecis, In a cqntiguous British prod

war, compéls citizens of the United Siates, being then undee

against the United States withio their limits, some of whom,  
after having done so, have become prisoners: of war, and are  
now in our possession, «© 6 os ‘  
  
*¢ The British Commander in that Province, nevertheless,  
~with the sanction, as appears, of his‘Government, thought pros

Great Britain for trial as criminals, a pumben of individyate

Rritish Officers of war in our hands were immediately pu’  
into clase confinement, to abide the fate of those confined by  
the enemy, and the British Government “has been apprized of  
the determination of this Government, to retaliate any pro-  
ceeding against us contrary to the legitimate modes of warfare.  
It is as fortunate for the United ‘States that they have it in  
their power to meet the enemy in this deplorable contest, as it  
is honourable to them that they do not join in it but under  
the most imperiaus obligations, aud with the humane purpose  
of effectuating a return to the established usages of wars  
  
* The views of thé French Government on the subjects  
which have been s0 long committed t@ negociation,s have re-  
ceived no elucidation since the close of your late Session, The  
Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States at Paris&quot; has not

that ferce as the hest prevision against the unsafe mititary  
establishment, as well as a sonfce peculiatly adapted to a  
country having the extent and the exposure of the United  
States, I recommend to Congress a revision of the Militia  
Laws, for the purpose of securing more effectnally the setvices  
of all detachments called to the employment, and placed under  
the Governmect of the United States.  
  
** It will deserve the consideration of Cavgress also, whe-  
ther, among other improvements inthe Militia Law, justice  
does not reqairé a regulation, under due precawtions, for de-  
fraying the expence incident te the first assembling, as well as  
te the subsequent movements of the detachments called into the  
vationgl service,

‘** Darieg the year ending on the 39th of September last, the |  
receipts intu the Treasury exceeded thirty-seven afiflions and a  
half of dollars, of which near twenty-four millions were the  
produce of loans, After meeiing all the demands for the pab-  
le service, there remained in the Treasury on that day oenr |  
seven millions of dollars, Under the authority cootnined in |  
the Act of the 24 August last, for borrowing seven mittieans

more favourable to the United States than those of the preced-

the favoured situation of the United States, thaf the calamities  
of thé Contest into which they have been compelled to enter are

Fellow Citizens of the Senate, and of the House of Representatives,  
  
In meeting you at the present interesting conjuncture, it would  
have been highly satisfactory if I could have communicated a favour-  
able result to the mission charged with negotiations for restoring peace.  
It was a just expectation from the respect dueto the distinguished  
Sovereign who had invited them by his offer of mediation; from the  
readiness with which the invitation was accepted on the part of the  
United States, and from the pledge to be foundin an act of their le-  
gislature, for the Jiberality which their plenipotentiaries would carry  
into the negotiations, that no time would be lost by the British govern-  
ment, in embracing the experiment for hastening a stop to the effusion  
of blood. A prompt and cordial acceptance of the mediation on that  
side, was the less to Le doubted, as it was of a nature not to submit  
rights or pretensions on either side to the decision of an umpire, but  
afford merely an opportunity, honourable and desirable te both, for  
discussing, and if possible, adjusting them for the interest of both.  
  
The British cabinet, either mistaking our desire of peace, fora  
dread of British power, or misled by other fallacious calculation, has  
disappointed this reasonable anticipation, No communications from  
our envoys having reached us, no information on the subject hasbeen  
received from that source. But itis known that the mediation was  
declined in the first instance, and there are no evidence, notwith-  
standing the lapse of time, that a change of disposition in the British  
Councils has taken place, or is to be expected.  
  
Under such circumstances, a nation, proud of its rights, and con-  
scious of its strength, has no choice but an exertion of one, in support  
of the other.  
  
To this determination, the best encouragement is derived from the  
success with which it has pleased the Almighty to bless our arms, both  
on the Jand and on the water.  
  
Whilst proofs have been continued of the enterprize and skill of  
our cruisers, public and private, on the ocean, and a new trophy  
gained in the capture of a British by an American vessel of war,  
after an action giving celebrity to the name of the victorious com-  
mander ; the great inland waters, on which the enemy were also to  
be encountered, have presented achievements of our naval arms, as  
brilliant in their character, as they have been important in their con-  
sequences.  
  
On Lake Erie, the squadron under command of Captain Perry,  
having met the British squadron of superior force, a sanguinary con-  
flict ended in the capture of the whole. The conduct of that officer,  
adroit as it was daring, and which was so well seconded by his com-  
rades, justly entitles them to the admiration and gratitude of their

country ; and will fill an early page in its naval annals, with a victory,  
never surpassed in lustre, however much it may have been in mag-  
nitude.  
  
On Lake Ontario, the caution of the British commander, favoured  
  
by contingencies, frustrated the efforts of the American commander  
to bring on a decisive action. Captain Chauncey was able, however,  
to establish an ascendancy on that importanttheatre, and to prove,  
by the manner in which he effected every thing possible, that oppor-  
tunities only were wanted, for a more shining display of his own  
talents, and of the gallantry of those under his command.  
__The success on Lake Erie having opened a passage to the territory  
of the enemy, the officer commanding the north-western army,  
transferred the war thither; and rapidiy pursuing the hostile troops,  
fleeing with their savage associates, forced a general action, which  
quickly terminated in the capture of the Britis, aud the dispersiox  
of the savage force.  
  
The result is signally honourable to Major General Harrison, by  
whose military talents it was prepared ; to colonel Johnson and his  
mounted volunteers, whose impetuous onset gave a decisive blow te  
the ranks of the enemy; and to the spirit of the volunteer militia,  
equally brave and patriotic, who bore an interesting part in the scene ;  
more especially to the chief magistrate of Kentucky, at the head ot  
them whose heroism, signalized in the war which established the inde-  
  
endence of his country, sought, at an advanced age, a share in  
pardships and baitles, for maintaining its rights and its safety.  
  
The effect of these successes has been to rescue the inhabitants ot  
Michigan from their oppressions, aggravated by gross infractions of  
the capitulation, which subjected them to a foreign power ; to alienate  
the savages of numerous tribes from the enemy, by whom they were  
disappointed and abandoned; and to relieve an extensive region of  
country from a merciless warfare, which desolated its frontiers, and  
imposed on its citizens the most harassing services.  
  
In conseyuence of our naval superiority on Lake Ontario, and the  
opportunity afforded by it for concentrating our forces by water, ope-  
rations which had beew previously planned, were set on foot against  
the possessions of the eneiny on the St. Lawrence. Such, however,  
was the delay produced, in the first jnstance, by adverse weather of  
unusual violence and continuance, and such the circumastances at-  
tending the final movements of the army, that the prospect, at one  
time so favourable, was not realized.  
  
The cruelty of the enemy, in enlisting the savages into a war with  
a nation desirous of mutual emulation in mitigating its calamities,  
has not been confined to any one quarter. Wherever they could be  
turned against us, no exertions to etfect it have been spared. On our  
South Western border, ihe Creek tribes, who, yielding to our pre-  
serving endeavours, were gradually acquiring more civilized habits,  
became the unfortunate victiins of seduction, A war in that quarter  
has been the cousequence, infuriated by a bloody fanaticism receutly  
propagated among them.

the contiguous tribes, and before it could favour enterprizes of the  
enemy into that vicinity. With this view a force was called into the  
service of the United States, trom the States of Georgia and Ten-  
nessee, which, with the nearest regular troops, and other corps from  
the Missisippi territory, might not only chastise the savages into pte-  
sent peace, but make a lasting impression on their fears,  
  
The progress of the expedition, as far as it is yet known, corresponds  
with the martial zeal with which it was espoused ; and the best hopes  
of a satisfactory issue are authorized by the complete success with  
which a well planned enterprise was executed against a body of hos-  
tile savages, by detachments of volunteer militia of Tennessee under  
the command of the gallant Gen. Coffee ; and by a still more important  
victory over a larger body of them, gained under the immediate com-  
mand of Major Gen. Jackson: an officer equally distinguished for his  
patriotism and military talents.  
  
The systematic perseverance of the enemy in courting the aid af  
the savages in all quarters, and the natural effect of kindling their or-  
dinary propensity to war into a passion which even among those best  
disposed towards the United States, was ready, if not employed on  
our side, to be turned against us. A departure from our protracted for-  
bearance to accept the services tendered by them has thus been forced  
uponus. But, in yielding to it, the retaliation has been mitigated as  
much as possible, both in its extent and in its character, stopping “far  
short of the example of the enemy, who owe the advantages they have  
occasionally gained in battle, chiefly to the number of their savages ;  
and who have not controuled them either from their usual practice of  
indiscriminate massacre on defenceless inhabitants, or from scenes of  
carnage without a parallel, on prisoners to the British arms, guarded  
by all the laws of humanity and honorable war.  
  
For those enormities, theenemy are equally responsible, whether  
with the power to prevent them they want the will, or with the  
knowledge of a want of power they still avail themselves of such  
instruments. .  
  
In other respects the enemy are pursuing a course which threatens  
consequences most afflicting to hamanity.  
  
A standing Jaw of Great Britain naturalizes, as is well known, all  
aliens, complying with conditions limited to a shorter period than  
those required by the United States; and naturalized subjects are,  
in war, employed by her government incommon with native subjects.  
In acoutiguous British province, regujations promulgated since the  
commencement of the war compel citizens of the United States, being  
there under certain circumstances, to bear arms ; whilst of the native  
emigrants from the United States who compose much of the popula-  
tion of the province, a number have actually borne arms against the  
United States, within their limits; some of whom, after having done  
so, have become prisoners of war, and are now in our possession, The  
British commander in that province nevertheless, with the sanction as  
appears, of his government, thought proper to select from Ameri-  
can prisoners of war, and send . Britain for trial as criminals,

a number of individuals, who had emigrated from the British dominions  
long prior to the state of war between the two nations, who had incor-  
porated thernselves into our political society, in the modes recognized by  
the law and practice of Great Britain, and who were made prisoners  
of war, under the banners of their adopted country, fighting for its  
rights and its safety.  
  
The protection due to these citizens requiring an effectuat interposi-  
tion in their behalf, a like number of British prisoners of war were  
put into confinement, with a notification that they would experience  
whatever violence might be committed on the American prisoners of  
war sent to Great Britain.  
  
ft was hoped that this necessary consequence of the step unadvised-  
ly taken on the part of Great Britain, would have led her government  
to reflect on fhe inconsistencies of its conduct, and that a sympathy  
with the British, if not with the American sufferers, would have ar-  
rested the cruel career opened by its example.  
  
This was unhappily not the case. In violation both of consisteticy,  
and of humanity, American officers and non-commissioned officers,  
in double the number of British soldiers confined here, were ordered  
into close confinement, with formal notice, that in the event of a  
retaliation for the death which might be inflicted on the prisoners of  
war sent to Great Britain for trial, the officers so confined would be  
put todeath also. It was notified at the same time, that the com-  
manders of the British fleet and armies on our coast, are instructed, in  
the same event, to proceed with a destructive severity, against our  
towns and their inhabitants.  
  
That no doubt might be Jeft with the enemy of our adherence to  
the retaliating resort imposed on us, a correspondent number of Bri-  
tish officers prisoners of war in our hands, were immediately put  
into close confinement, to abide the fate of those confined by the  
enemy ; and the British government has been apprized of the deter-  
tnination of this government to retaliate any other proceeding against  
us, contrary to the legitimate modes of warfare.  
  
It is as fortunate for the United States that they have it in their  
power to meet the enemy ip this deplorable contest, 2s it is honour-  
able tothem, that they do not join in it but under the most imperious  
obligations, and with the humane purpose of effectuating a return to  
the established usages of war.  
  
The views of the French government on the subjects which have  
been so long committed to negotiation have received no elucidation  
eince the close of your last session. The minister plenipotentiary of  
the United States at Paris, had not been enabled, by proper opportuni-  
ties, to press the objects of his mission, as prescribed by his instruc-  
tions.  
  
The militia being always to be regarded as the grest bulwark of  
cefence and security for free states, and the constitution having wisely  
committed to the nationa] authority a use of that force, as the best  
provision against an unsafe military establishment, as well as a re-  
source peculiarly adapted to a ceuntry having the extent and the

exposure of the United States—I recommend to Congress a revision  
of the militia laws, for the purpose of securing, more effectually, the  
services of all detachments called into the employments, and placed  
under the government of the United States.  
  
It will deserve the consideration of Congress also, whether, among  
other improvements in the militia laws, justice does not require a  
regulation, under due precautions, for defraying the expences inci-  
dent to the first assembling, as well as to the subsequent movements of  
detachments called into the national service.  
  
To give to our vessels of war, public and private, the requisite  
advantages in their cruises, it is of much importance that they should  
have, both for themselves and their prizes, the use of the ports of  
friendly powers. With this view, I recommend to Congress, the  
expediency of such legal provisions as may sapply the defects, or re-  
move the doubts of the executive authority to allow to the cruisers of  
other powers, at war with the enemies of the United States, such  
use of the American ports and markets, as may correspond with the  
privileges allowed by such powers to American cruisers.  
  
During the year ending on the 30th Sept. last, the receipts into  
the Treasury have exceeded 37 millions and a half of dollars, of  
which near 24 millions were the produce of loans. After meeting  
all the demands for the public service, there remained in the Treasury  
on that day near 7 millions of dollars. Under the authority contained in  
the.act of the 2d of August last, for borrowing 7 millions and half  
of dollars, that sum has been obtained on terms more favourable to the  
United States than those of the preceding loan made during the pre-  
sent year. Further sums to a considerable amount will be necessary  
to be obtained in the same way during the ensuing year ;—and from  
the increased capital of the country, from the fidelity with which the  
public engagements have been kept, and the public credit maintained,  
it may be expected on good grounds that the necessary pecuniary  
supplies will not be wanting.  
  
The expences of the current year, from the multiplied operations  
falling within it, have necessarily been extensive. But on a just es-  
timate of the campaign, in which the mass of them has been ipcure  
red, the cost will not be found disproportionate to the advantages  
which have been gained. The campaign has indeed, in its latter sta&lt;  
ges in one quarter, been less favorable than was expected; but ia  
addition to the importance of our naval success, the progress of the  
campaign has been filled with incidents highly honorable to the Ame-  
rican arms.  
  
The attacks of the enemy on Craney Island, on Fort Meigs, on  
Sacket’s harbour, and on Sandusky, have been vigorously and suc-  
cessfully repulsed ; nor have they in any case succeeded on their fron-  
tier, excepting when directing against the peaceable dwellings of in-  
dividuals, or villages unprepared or undefended.  
  
On the other hand, the movements of the American army have  
been followed by the reduction of York, and Forts George, Erie,  
and Malden ; by the recovery of Detroit, and the extinction of the

Indian war in the west; and by the occupancy or command of a  
large portion of Upper Canada. Battles have also been fought on the  
borders of the St. Lawrence, which, though not accomplishing their  
entire objects, reflect honour on the discipline and prowess of the  
soldiery, the best auguries of eventual victory. In the same scale  
are to be placed the late successes in the South, over one of the most  
powerful, which had become one of the most hostile also, of the  
Indian tribes.  
  
It would be improper to close this cormmunication without expres-  
sing a thankfulness, in which all ought to unite, for the numerous  
blessings with which our beloved country continues to be favoured ;  
for the abundance which overspreads our land, and the prevailing  
health of its inhabitants, for the preservation of our internal tran-  
quillity, and the stability of our free institutions; and above all, for  
the light of divine truth, and the protection of every man’s con-  
science in the enjoyment of it. And although among our blessings  
we cannot number an exemption from the evils of war; yet these  
will never be regarded as the greatest of evils, by the friends of liberty  
and of the rights of nations, Our country has preserved them to the  
degrading condition which was the alternative, wher the sword was  
drawn in the cause which gave birth to our national independence ;  
and none who contemplate the magnitude, and feel the value of  
that glorious event, will shrink from a struggle to maintain the high  
and happy ground on which it placed the American people.  
  
With all good citizens, the justice and necessity of resisting wrongs  
and usurpations no longer to be borne, will sufficiently outweigh the  
privations and sacrifices, inseparable froma state of war. But it is  
a reflection moreover, peculiarly consoling, that whilst wars are ge-  
nerally aggravated by their baneful effecis on the internal improve-  
ments and permanent prosperity of the nations engaged in them,  
such is the favoured&#x27;situation of the United States, that the calamities  
of the contest into which they have been compelled to enter, are  
mitigated by improvements and advantages of which the contest  
itself is the source.  
  
If the war has increased the interruptions of our commerce, it  
has at the same time cherished and multiplied our manufactures, so  
as to make us independent of all other countries for the more essen-  
tial branches, for which we ought to be dependent on none; and is  
even rapidly giving them an extent which will create additional staples  
in our future intercourse with foreign markets.  
  
If much ireasure has been expended, no inconsiderable portion of  
it has been appiied to objects durable in their value, and necessary ta  
our permanent safety,  
  
If the war has exposed us to increased spoliations on the ocean,  
and to predatory incursions on the Jand, it has developed the national  
means of retaliating the former, and of providing protection against  
the latter; demonstrating to all, that every blow aimed at our mari-  
time independence is an impulse accelerating the growth of our  
maritime power,

By diffusing through the mass of the nation the elements of military  
discipline and instruction; by augmenting and distributing warlike  
preparations, applicable to future use; by evincing the zeal and valor  
with which they will be employed; and the cheerfulness with which  
every necessary burden will be borne—a greater respect for our rights,  
and a longer duration of our future peace are promised, than could  
be expected without these proofs of the national character and re-  
sources.  
  
The war has proved, moreover, that our free government, like  
other free governments, though slow in its early movements, acquires  
in its progress a force proportioned to its freedom ; and that the union  
of these States, the guardian of the freedom, and safety of all and  
of each, is strengthened by every oceasion that puts it to the test,  
  
In fine, the war, with all its vicissitudes, is illustrating the capa-  
city and the destiny of the United States to be a great, a flourishing,  
and a powerful nation; worthy of the friendship which it is disposed  
to cultivate with all others; and authorized, by his own example, to  
require for all an observance of the laws of justice and reciprocity.  
Beyond these their claims have never been extended ; and, in con-  
tending for these, we beliold a subject for our congratulations, in the  
daily testimonies of increasing harmony throughout the nation, and  
may hambly repose our trust in the smiles of Heaven on so righteous  
  
a cause,

be adopted toward the parties im­  
mediately guilty, if the perpetrators of the   
Fort Pillow massacre should come into our   
power.   
  
It would appear, however, if we inquire   
historically into they antecedents of our   
Government upon this very question, that   
the distinction made above has not always   
been observed. In the last war with Great   
Britain; twenty-three British-born subjects,   
who had become American citizens .by nat­  
uralization, having been taken prisoners of   
war in Canada, the commander of that   
Province sent them to Englaid to be tried   
for treason, and possibly to be executed.   
A like number of British prisoners of war   
were placed in confinement by the Ameri­  
can Government, with a notification to the   
British authorities that whatever violence   
might be committed on the American pris­  
oners would be retaliated upon these host­  
ages. Whereupon forty-six American offi­  
cers were immediately placed in close   
confinement by the British Government, to   
experience in their turn the same treat­  
ment which might await the British pris­  
oners. Here was a trying case for our   
Government, and the manner, in which our   
fathers met the responsibility may be   
learned from the following extract from   
the message of President-MAorsoN to Con­  
gress, Dec: 7th, 1813:   
  
&quot; That no doubt might be &#x27;left with the   
enemy of our adherence to the retaliatory   
resort imposed upon us, a corresponding   
number (forty-six) of British officers, pris­  
oners of war in hands, were immedi­  
ately put into close confinement, fo abide   
the fate of those confined by the enemy;   
and the British Government has been ap­  
prised of the determination of this Govern­  
ment to retaliate any other proceedings   
against us contrary to the legitimate modes   
of warfare. It is as fortunate for the Uni­  
ted States that they have it in their power   
to meet the enemy in this deplorable con­  
test, as it is honorable to them that they   
do not join in&#x27;it but under the most impe­  
rious obligations, and with the humane   
purpose of effectuating a return to the es­  
tablished usages of war.&quot;

t among the greatest blessings of that conflict was  
vast development of the national feeling. He said:  
And although among our blessings we cannot number  
exemption from the evils of war, yet these will never  
regarded as the greatest of evils by the friends of lib-  
and of the rights of nations. Our country has be-  
» preferred them to the degraded condition which was  
alternative, when the sword was drawn in the cause  
ch gave birth to our national independence; and none  
» contemplates the magnitude and feels the value of  
that glorious event will shrink from a struggle to main-  
| the high and happy ground on which it placed the  
\merican people.  
“By diffusing through the mass of the nation the ele-  
uts of military discipline and instruction, by augment-  
and distributing warlike preparations, applicable to  
ure use, by evincing the zeal and valor with which  
they will be employed, and the cheerfulness with which  
every necessary burden will be borne, a greater respect  
our rights and a longer duration of our future peace  
promised than could be expected without these proofs  
f the national character and resources.  
The war has proved, moreover, that our free govern-  
ent, like other free governments, though slow in its  
ly movements, acquires in its progress a force propor-  
ed to its freedom, and that the union of these States,  
guardian of the freedom and safety of all and of  
h, is strengthened by every occasion that puts it to  
test.”
