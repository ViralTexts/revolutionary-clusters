vored to poison them against the reception of our most precious commodities, to place these two nations on a footing, is to give a great deal more to one than to the other if the maxim be true that to make unequal quantities equal you must add more to the one than the other. To say in excuse that gratitude is never to enter into the motives of national conduct, is to revive a principle which has been buried for centuries with it’s kindred principles of the lawfulness of assassination, poison, perjury &amp;c. All of these were legitimate principles in the dark ages which intervened between antient &amp; modern civilisation, but exploded &amp; held in just horror in the 18th. century. I know but one code of morality for man whether acting singly or collectively. He who says I will be a rogue when I act in company with a hundred others but an honest man when I act alone, will be believed in the former assertion, but not in the latter. I would say with the poet ‘hic niger est, hunc tu Romane caveto.’ If the morality of one man produces a just line of conduct in him, acting individually, why should not the morality of 100 men produce a just line of conduct in them acting together?

t has shewn genuine dignity in my opinion in exploding adulatory titles; they are the offerings of abject baseness, and nourish that degrading vice in the people. I must now say a word on the declaration of rights you have been so good as to send me. I like it as far as it goes; but I should have been for going further. For instance the following alterations &amp; additions would have pleased me. Art. 4. ‘The people shall not be deprived or abridged of their right to speak to write or otherwise to publish any thing but false facts affecting injuriously the life, liberty, property, or reputation of others or affecting the peace of the confederacy with foreign nations. Art. 7. All facts put in issue before any judicature shall be tried by jury except 1. in cases of admiralty jurisdiction wherein a foreigner shall be interested, 2. in cases cognisable before a court martial concerning only the regular officers &amp; souldiers of the U. S. or members of the militia in actual service in time of war or insurrection, &amp; 3. in impeachments allowed by the constitution. Art. 8. No person shall be held in confinement more than  days after they shall have demanded &amp; been refused a writ of Hab. corp. by the judge appointed by law nor more than  days after such writ shall have been served on the person holding him in confinement &amp; no order given on due examination for his remandment or discharge, nor more than  hours in any place at a greater distance than  miles from the usual residence of some judge authorised to issue the writ of Hab. corp. nor shall that writ be suspended for any term exceeding one year nor in any place more than  miles distant from the station or encampment of enemies or of insurgents. Art. 9. Monopolies may be allowed to persons for their own productions in literature &amp; their own inventions in the arts, for a term not exceeding  years but for no longer term &amp; no other purpose. Art. 10. All troops of the U. S. shall stand ipso facto disbanded at the expiration of the term for which their pay &amp; subsistence shall have been last voted by Congress, and all officers &amp; souldiers not natives of the U. S. shall be incapable of serving in their armies by land except during a foreign war.’ These restrictions I think are so guarded as to hinder evil only. However if we do not have them now, I hav
