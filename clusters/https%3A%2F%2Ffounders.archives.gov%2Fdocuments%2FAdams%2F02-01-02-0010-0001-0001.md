covered a broken rail, which doubtless  
snapped in twain as the freight passed  
over it in safety. It was on a high, dan­  
gerous curve in the road, and, taking in  
the situation, the tramp remained to flag  
the first train to avert danger and the  
probable loss of life. The first train  
proved to be a passenger train bound for  
St. Joseph. He flagged it in time, and  
the train and its load of human freight  
were saved. The tramp was taken  
aboard, and a large purse of money made  
up for him. He gave his name and
