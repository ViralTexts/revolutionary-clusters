to 25.in the US. it is as 8. millions to Zero, or as all to none.But it is said they possess the  
			 means of defence, and that we do not. how so? are we not men?—yes; but our men are so happy at home that they will not hire themselves to be shot at for a shilling a day. hence we can have no standing armies for defence, because we have no  
			 paupers to furnish them the materials. the Greeks and Romans had no standing armies, yet they defended themselves. the Greeks by their laws, and the Romans by the spirit of their people, took care to put into the  
			 hands of their rulers no such engine of oppression, as a standing army. their system was to make every man a soldier, &amp; oblige him to repair to the standard of his country, whenever that was  
			 reared. this made them invincible; and the same remedy will make us so. in the beginning of our government we were willing to introduce the least coercion possible on the will of the citizen.  
			 hence a  
			 system of military duty was established too indulgent to his indolence. this is the first opportunity we have had of trying it. and it has compleatly failed: an issue foreseen by many, and for  
			 which  
			 remedies have been proposed.  
			 that of classing the militia according to age, and allotting each age to the particular kind of service to which it was competent, was proposed to Congress in 1805. and subsequently; and, on the last trial, was lost, I believe, by a single vote only. had it prevailed, what has now happened would not have happened. instead of burning our Capitol, we should have possessed theirs in Montreal and Quebec. we must now adopt it, &amp; all will be safe. we had in

on?  
			 when they destroyed Copenhagen by superior force, against all the laws of god and man, would it have been unjustifiable for the Danes to have destroyed their ships by torpedoes? clearly not. and they and we should now be  
			 justifiable in the conflagration of St James’s and St Paul’s. and if we do not carry it into execution, it is because we think it more moral and more honorable to set a good example, than follow a bad one.  
So much for the happiness of the people of England, and the morality of their government, in comparison with the happiness &amp; the morality of America.—let us pass to another subject.  
The Crisis then of the abuses of banking is arrived. the banks have pronounced their own sentence of death. between 2. and 300. millions of Dollars of their promisory notes are in the hands of the people, for solid produce &amp; property sold, and they formally declare they will not pay them. this is an act of bankruptcy of course, and will be so pronounced by any court before which it shall be brought. but cui bono? the law can only uncover their insolvency, by opening to it’s suitors their empty vaults. thus by the dupery of our citizens, and tame acquiescence of our legislators, the nation is plundered of 2. or 300. millions of Dollars, treble the amount of debt contracted in the revolutionary war, and which, instead of redeeming our liberty, has been expended on sumptuous houses, carriages &amp; dinners. a fearful tax! if equalised on all: but overwhelming and convulsive by it’s partial fall. the crush will be tremendous; very different from that brought on by our paper money. that rose &amp;  fell so gradually that it kept all on their guard, and affected severely only early or long-winded contracts. here the contract of yesterday crushes in an instant the one or the other party. the banks stopping payment suddenly, all their mercantile and city debtors do the same, and all in short except those in the country, who, possessing property, will be good in the end. but this resource will not enable them to pay a cent in the Dollar. from the establishment of the United states bank to this day I have preached against this system, but have been sensible no cure could be hoped but in the catastrophe now happening. the remedy was to let the banks drop gradatim, at the expiration of their charters, and for the state governments to relinquish the power of establishing others. this would not, as it should not, have given the power of establishing them to Congress. but Congress could then have issued treasury notes payable within a fixed period, and funded on a specific tax, the proceeds of which, as they came in, should be exchangable for the notes of that particular emission only. this depended, it is true, on the will of the state legislatures, and would have brought on us the phalanx of paper-interest. but that interest is now defunct. their gossimer castles are dissolved, and they can no longer impede and over-awe the salutary measures of the government. their paper was recieved on a belief that it was cash on demand. themselves have declared it was nothing: and such scenes are now to take place as will open the eyes of credulity, and of insanity itself, to the dangers of a paper medium abandoned to the discretion of avarice and of swindlers. it is impossible not to deplore our past follies, and their present consequences: but let them at least be warnings against like follies in future. the banks have discontinued themselves. we are now without any medium; and necessity, as well as patriotism and confidence, will make us all eager to recieve treasury notes, if bottomed on specific taxes. Congress may now borrow of the public and without interest, all the money they may want, to the amount of a competent circulation, by merely issuing their own promisory notes, of proper denominations for the larger purposes of circulation, but not for the small. leave that door open for the entrance of metallic money. and, to give readier credit to their bills, without obliging themselves to give cash for them on demand, let their Collectors be instructed to do so, when they have cash, thus, in some measure, performing the functions of a bank, as to their own notes. Providence seems indeed, by a special dispensation to have put down for us, without a struggle, that very paper enemy which the interests of our citizens long since required ourselves to put down, at whatever risk. the work is done. the moment is pregnant with futurity; and if not siesed at once by Congress, I know not on what shoal our bark is next to be stranded. the state legislatures should be immediately urged to relinquish the right of establishing banks of discount. most of them will comply, on patriotic principles, under the convictions of the moment; and the non-complying may be crouded into concurrence by legitimate devices.—Vale, et me, ut amaris, ama.

ponder in his heart:  
&quot;The crisis, then, of the abuses of bank­  
ing is arrived. The banks have pro­  
nounced their own sentence of death. Be­  
tween $200,000,000 and $300,000.000 of  
their promissory notes are in the hands  
of the people, for solid produce and prop­  
erty sold, and they formally declare they  
will not pay them. This is an act of  
bankruptcy, of course, and will be so pro­  
nounced by any court before which if  
shall be brought. But what good? The  
law can only uncover their insolvency, by  
  
opening to its suitors their empty vaults.  
Thus by the dupery of our citizens, and  
tame acquiescence of our legislators, the  
nation is plundered of two or tiree hun-  
dred millions of dollars, treble the amount  
of debt contracted in the Revolutionary  
war, and whick, instead of redeeming our  
liberty, has been expended on sumptuous  
  
honses, carriages and dinners. The crash  
will be tremendous; very different from

&quot;Tbe remedy Is to let the banks dron onulnnli.  
out at the exulratlon of their charier. nri inr  
the State Government to relinquish their powpr  
to establish others.&#x27; This w.uld not. ai itthould  
not, nave given tne power of establishing to Con­  
gress. But Congress could then have issued  
Treasury notes, payable within a fixed period, and  
founded on apeciilc tax, the proceeds or which,  
as they come in, Bhould be exchanged for tbe  
notes or that particular emission only. This de­  
pended, It Is true, on the will or the Slate Leg  
islaturea, aud would have bronght on us the  
phalanx ot prorer interest. B it mat interest is  
now defunct. Tbelr gossamer casiles are dis­  
solved, aud Ihey can no longer imperte and over­  
come the salutary measures of the Government.  
This paner wan received on a belief that It was  
cash on dt maud. The; themselves have declared  
It was unthiiig, aud such scenes are now to take  
place as will open the eves or credulty aud Insan­  
ity Itself to the dangers of a paper medium  
abandoned to the discretion or avarice aud ol  
swindlers. It is impossible not to deplore our  
past follies and their present consequences, but  
let them, at least, be warnings against hire fol­  
lies in future, ihe banks have discontinued  
themselves. We are now without any medium,  
and necessity, as well as patriotism and con a  
dence, will make us all eager to receive Treasu­  
ry notes, If fouuded on specific taxes, Congress  
may now borrow of the public, and without in­  
terest, all the money they may want, to tbe  
amount of a competent circulation, by merely  
issuing tbelr own promissory notes, of proper de­  
nominations, for the larger purposes or circula­  
tion, but not for the small. Leave that door  
open for the entrance or the metallic money.  
Aud to have readier credit for their biila with.  
out obliging themselves to give cash for them  
on demand, let their oolleciora be Instructed to  
do so when they have cash; thus, in some mea­  
sure, performing the functions or a batik as to  
their own notes. Providence seems, Indeed, by a  
speoial dispensation, to have put down lor ns,  
without a straggle that very paper enemy which  
the Interest of our citizens long since required  
ourselves lo put down. The work Is done. Tbe  
moment is pregnant with futurlt&quot;, and if not  
seised at once by Congress I kuow not nn what  
shoal our bark la next to be stranded. Tbe State  
legislatures snouia De immediately urged to re­  
linquish Ihe right or establishing banks of rti.  
count. Most or them will comply on patriotlo  
principles on conviction of tbe moment, and the  
non complying may be crowded into acceptance

Mr. Jefferson, in the same letter says:  
‘ “From the establishment of the T’ni­  
ted States Hank, to this day. T have  
preached against this system, but have  
been sensible no cure could be hoped  
but in tlie catastrophe now happening.  
The remedy was to let banks drop  
gradation at the expiration of their  
charters, and for the State govern­  
ments to relinquish the power of es­  
tablishing others. This would not. as  
it should not, have given the power of  
establishing them to Congress. Hut  
Congress could then have issued Treas­  
ury notes payable within a fixed per­  
iod. and founded on a speeific tax. the  
proceeds of which, as they came in,  
should be exchangeable for the notes  
of that particular issue only.”  
I quoted a week or two ago a similar  
expression of Mr. Jefferson’s invinci­  
ble repugnance to all banks: and of  
his desire to see State governments re­  
linquish the right to authorize State  
or local banks to issue their bills as  
money. What he then proposed is sub­  
stantially that which now exists, but  
which the National Hanks are trying  
t&lt;» break up- a paper currency issued  
by the United States (lovemment, re­  
deemable at the pleasure of the hold­  
ers, ami receivable for public dues. \-  
gain he says:  
“Their paper was received on a be­  
lief that it was cash on demand. Them­  
selves have declared it was nothing,  
and such scenes are now to take place  
as will open the eyes of creddulity and  
even insanity itself to the dangers of a  
paper medium abandoned &lt;&lt;&gt; the dis­  
eretinn of avrice and of swindlers. It  
is impossible not to deplore our past  
follies and their present consequences,  
but let them at least be warnings a­  
gainst like follies in future. The  
banks have discontinued themselves.  
We are now jvithout any medium;  
and necessity, as well as patriotism  
and confidence,will make* us all eager to  
receive treasury notes.if founded ori  
specific taxes. f ongress may now  
borrow of the public, and without in­  
terest, all the money they may want,  
to the amount of a competent circula­  
tion. by merely issuing their ow n pro­  
missory notes, of proper denomina­  
tions for the larger purposes of circu­  
lation. but not for the small. Leave  
that door open for the entrance of  
metallic money.”  
These views of Mr. .Jefferson arc  
applicable to the present times.
