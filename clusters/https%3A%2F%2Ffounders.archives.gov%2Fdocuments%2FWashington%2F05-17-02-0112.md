Saturday 15th Novr 1794.  
  
I have not been able to give the papers herewith enclosed more than a hasty reading; returning them, without delay, that you may offer the perusal of them to whomsoever you shall think proper.  
The picture drawn in them, of the Genevese, is realy interesting &amp; affecting. The proposition of transplanting the members, entire, of the University of that place, to America, with the requisition of means to establish the same, and to be accompanied by a considerable emigration, is important; requiring more consideration, than under the circumstances of the moment, I am able to bestow on it.  
That a national University in this country is a thing to be desired, has always been my decided opinion; and the appropriation of ground, and funds for it, in the federal City, have long been contemplated, &amp; talked of; but how far matured; or how far the transplanting of an entire Seminary of foreigners, who may not understand our language, can be assimilated therewith is more than I am prepared to give an opinion upon. or indeed, how far funds in either case, are attainable.  
My opinion with respect to emigration is, that except of useful mechanic’s—and some particular descriptions of men—or professions—there is no need of extra encouragement: while the policy, or advantage of its taking place in a body (I mean the settling of them in a body) may be much questioned; for by so doing they retain the language, habits &amp; principles (good or bad) which they bring with them; whereas, by an intermixture with our people, they, or their descendants, get assimilated to our customs, manners and laws: in a word, soon become one people.  
I shall, at any leisure hour, after the Session is fairly opened, have pleasure in a full and free conversation with you on this  
  
subject,

Saturday, November 27, 1794.  
Dkar Sir : I have not been able to give the  
papers herewith enclosed more than a hasty read­  
ing, returning them without delay, that you may  
otter the perusal of them to whomsoever you jnay  
think proper. The picture drawn in them of the  
Gonevese is really Interesting and affecting. The  
proposition of transplanting the members entire of  
the university of that place to America, with tho  
requisition of means to establish the same, and to  
bo accompanied by considerable emigration, is im­  
portant, requiring more consideration than under  
the circumstances of the moment I am able to be­  
stow upon it  
That a national university Is a thing to be de­  
aired has always been my decided opinion ; and  
the appropriation of ground and funds for it in the  
Federal City has long been contemplated and talked  
of j but how far matured, or how fur tho transport­  
ing an entire seminary of foreigners, who may not  
understand th? language, can be assimilated there­  
to, is more than I am prepaid! to gire an opinion  
upon; or, indeed, how far funds in either case are  
attainable.  
My opinion, with respect to emigration [imnii-1  
gration is meant, of course,] is, that except of use­  
ful mechanics and some par ticular descriptions of  
men or professions, there is no need of encourage­  
ment; while the policy of its taking place in a  
body, (I mean the settling of them in a body) msy  
be much questioned ; for by so doing they retain  
the language, habits, and principles, good or bad,  
which they bring with them. Whereas, by an in­  
termixture with our people, they or their descend­  
ants get assimilated to our customs, measures and

“T have not been able to give the papers here-  
with enclosed more than a hasty reading, returning  
them without delay that you may offer the perusal  
of them to whomsoever you shall think proper.  
The picture drawn of the Genevese is really inter-  
esting and affecting. The proposition of trans-  
planting the members entire of that place to  
America, with the requisition of means to estab-  
lish the same, and to be accompanied by a con-  
siderable emigration, is important, requiring more  
consideration than under the circumstances I am  
capable of bestowing on it. That a national uni-  
versity is a thing to be desired has always been my  
decided opinion; and the appropriation of grounds  
and funds for it in the Federal City has long been  
contemplated and talked of, but how far matured,  
or how far the transplanting of an entire seminary  
of foreigners, who may not understand our lan-  
guage, can be assimilated therein is more than I  
am prepared to give an opinion upon; or indeed,  
how far funds in either case are attainable. My  
opinion, with respect to emigration, is, that except  
useful mechanics and some particular descriptions  
of men or professions, there is no need of encour-  
agement; while the policy or advantage of its  
taking place in a body (I mean the settling of them

so they retain the language, habits, and _princi-

Whereas, by an intermixture with our people, they
