Sir,  
Boston July 20. 1792.  
  
I have just read a passage in your circular letter of June 25th to the Collectors of the Customs, putting on the 12th section of the Post-Office-Law a construction which I conceive to be erroneous &amp; which will materially injure the revenue of the department.

The only doubt on my mind respected the meaning of the phrase “by sea.” Some gentlemen at Providence thought that letters going in the packets between that place and Newport, were not within meaning of the act.
