Resuming the subject of our last paper we proceed to trace still farther, the consequences that must result from a too unqualified admission of foreigners, to an equal participation in our civil, and political rights.  
  
The safety of a republic depends essentially on the energy of a common National sentiment; on a uniformity of principles and habits; on the exemption of the citizens from foreign bias, and prejudice; and on that love of country which will almost invariably be found to be closely connected with birth, education and family.  
The opinion advanced in the Notes on Virginia is undoubtedly correct, that foreigners will generally be apt to bring with them attachments to the persons they have left behind; to the country of their nativity, and to its particular customs and manners. They will also entertain opinions on government congenial with those under which they have lived, or if they should be led hither from a preference to ours, how extremely unlikely is it that they will bring with them that temperate love of liberty, so essential to real republicanism? There may as to particular individuals, and at particular times, be occasional exceptions to these remarks, yet such is the general rule. The influx of foreigners must, therefore, tend to produce a heterogeneous compound; to change and corrupt the national spirit; to complicate and confound public opinion; to introduce foreign propensities. In the composition of society, the harmony of the ingredients is all important, and whatever tends to a discordant intermixture must have an injurious tendency.  
The United States have already felt the evils of incorporating a large number of foreigners into their national mass; it has served very much to divide the community and to distract our councils, by promoting in different classes different predilections in favor of particular foreign nations, and antipathies against others. It has been often likely to compromit the interests of our own country in favor of another. In times of great public danger there is always a numerous body of men, of whom there may be just grounds of distrust; the suspicion alone weakens the strength of the nation, but their force may be actually employed in assisting an invader.  
In the infancy of the country, with a boundless waste to people, it was politic to give a facility to naturalization; but our situation is now changed. It appears from the last census, that we have increased about one third in ten years; after allowing for what we have gained from abroad, it will be quite apparent that the natural progress of our own population is sufficiently rapid for strength, security and settlement. By what has been said, it is not meant to contend for a total prohibition of the right of citizenship to strangers, nor even for the very long residence which is now a prerequisite to naturalization, and which of itself, goes far towards a denial of that privilege. The present law was merely a temporary measure adopted under peculiar circumstances and perhaps demands revision. But there is a wide difference between closing the door altogether and throwing it entirely open; between a postponement of fourteen years and an immediate admission to all the rights of citizenship. Some reasonable term ought to be allowed to enable aliens to get rid of foreign and acquire American attachments; to learn the principles and imbibe the spirit of our government; and to admit of at least a probability of their feeling a real interest in our affairs. A residence of at least five years ought to be required.  
If the rights of Naturalization may be communicated by parts, and it is not perceived why they may not, those peculiar to the conducting of business and the acquisition of property, might with propriety be at once conferred, upon receiving proof, by certain prescribed solemnities, of their intention to become citizens; postponing all political privileges to the ultimate term. To admit foreigners indiscriminately to the rights of citizens, the moment they put foot in our country, as recommended in the Message, would be nothing less, than to admit the Grecian Horse into the Citadel of our Liberty and Sovereignty.

Theiafety of a republic depends eff-nrially  
on the energy of a common n«*tt &gt;nal fentiment ;  
on a uniformity of principles and habits ; on  
the exemption of the citizens from foreign bias*  
and predjadice ; and on that love of country  
which will almod invariably be found to be  
ctofcly connected with birth, education and  
family.  
The opinion advanced.in the notes on Vir,  
ginia is undoubtedly correft that toreigrers  
will generally be apt to bring with ihem attach,  
ment to the perfons they h tve left behind ; to  
the country of ibeir nativity, and to its panic*  
ular customs and manners. Tiiey will alfo

fenfities. Tn the eo&#x27;mpr fitio*of fociety, the  
harmony of the ingredients is ill-important and  
whatfoever tends to a d fcordvmt intermixture  
muft have an injurious tendency.  
The United States have already felt the evils  
cf incorporating a large number of foreigne:-*,  
into tlfeir national mafs ; it has ferved very  
much to divide the community and to diftra&amp;  
our councils, by promoting in different clafles  
different predilections in favor of paiticular for­  
eign nations, and antipathies againft others. It  
bfcs been often likely to compromit the interefts  
cf our own country in favor of another. In  
lime* of gieat public danger there i9 always a  
numerous body of meR, of whom there may  
, juft grounds of diltruft ; the iufpicion alone  
weakens the itrength of the nation, but their  
Force may be actually employed in affifting an  
ihvader.  
In the infancy of the country, with a bound.  
Jef» wafte to people, it was politic to give a fa­  
cility to naturalization ; but our fituation is now  
changed. It appears from the tail cenfus, that  
we have increaled about one third in ten years ;  
afrer allowing for what we have gained irom a*  
bioad, it will be quite apparent that the natural  
progrefs t;f our own population is fuffici^ntly  
r«p&lt;d for ftrength, fecuiity and fettlement. By  
wh u lias been f id, it is not meant to contend for  
.1 total prohibition of the right of citizerfhip to  
ft&#x27;antjers, nor even for the verv Ion&quot; refiderjce  
wh ch is now a prerequifite to naturalization,  
atid » hich of iifelf, goes far towards a denial of  
that privilege. The prefent law was merely a  
temporary meafure adopted uider peculiar cir. i  
cu enhances and perhaps demands revilion. But  
  
tnere is a wiae aiitcrence between doling the  
door altogether and throwing it entirely open ;  
between a poftponement of fourteen years and  
an immediate admiflion to all the rights of citi- j  
zenfttip. Some reafonable term ought to be  
allowed to enable aliens to get rid ol foreign,  
and acquire American attachments ; to leartt  
the principles and imbibe the fpirit of our gov.  
ernrtient ; and to admit of at lead a probability !  
of their feeling a real interert in our affairs. A  
reader ee of at leaft 5 years ought to be require  
ed.  
If the rights of naturalization nny be enm  
mun cated by parts, and it is not perceived why  
they may not, thnfe peculiar to the conducting j  
rtf buftuefs and the acquilition of property, mi^ht ]  
with propriety be at «nce conferred, upon receiv­  
ing proof,byccrta-n f.refcribed frterunitie., of  
their intention to became citizens ; portioning all  
political privileges to the ultimate term. To ad  
mit foreigners indifcriminatley to the rights of  
cttizens.the moment theyjput foot in ottrjcor.i try,  
as recommended in the nrieilage, would be no- j  
thing hef&gt; thrin to let the Grecian horfc iuio the j  
CiuJel of our liberty and foverei^nty.

comments on Mr. Jefferson’s message, he said,  
¢ It is not meant to contend for a tolal pro­  
hibition of the rights of citizenship to stran­  
gers, nor even for the very long residence  
which is now a pre-requisite to naturalization,  
and which of itself’ goes far towards a denial  
of that privilege. The present law was mere­  
ly a temporary measure, adopted under peculiar  
circumstances, and perhaps demands revision.  
But there is a wide difference hetween closing  
the door altogether, and throwing it entirely  
open; between a postponement of fourteen  
years, and an immediate adinission to the rights  
of citizenship, Some reasonable term ought  
to be allowed to enable aliens to get rid of for­  
eign, and acquire American attachwents: to  
learn the principles and imbibe the spirit ot  
our government ; and to adiit of a probability,  
at least, of feeling a real interest in our affairs,  
A residence of not less than five years ought  
to be required.
