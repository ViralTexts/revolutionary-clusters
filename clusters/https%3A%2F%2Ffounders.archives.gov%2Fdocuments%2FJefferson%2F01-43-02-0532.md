Sir,  
Treasury Department June 23d. 1804.  
  
I have the honor to enclose the copy of a correspondence of the Collector of Norfolk with this Department and the Spanish Consul there, respecting a right claimed by Spanish Subjects to relade on board of a different Vessel without securing the duties, the cargo of a Vessel which had put in Norfolk from distress and was afterwards condemned as not being sea-worthy.  
The 10th. Article of the Spanish Treaty under which the privilege is claimed is in the following words—“When any Vessel of either party shall be wrecked, foundered, or otherwise damaged, on the coasts or within the dominion of the other, their respective subjects or citizens shall receive, as well for themselves as for their vessels and effects, the same assistance which would be due to the inhabitants of the country where the damage happens, and shall pay the same charges and dues only as the said inhabitants would be subject to pay in a like case: And if the operations of repair would require that the whole or any part of the cargo be unladen, they shall pay no duties, charges or fees on the part which they shall relade and carry away.”  
  
The sixtieth Section of the collection law, passed March 2d. 1799 provides generally for the case of any Vessel (American or foreign), which may be compelled by distress to put into a Port of the United States, and permits, under the restrictions ne

 the port, the cargo must likewise pay the duties though re-exported on board of another vessel. The reshipping of the goods on board the vessel which brought them is made by the law a necessary condition to the privilege of exporting without paying or securing the duties.  
It is proper to add that the inconvenience resulting in that case to the party consists, first in being obliged to find sureties that the goods shall not be relanded in the United States, and 2dly. in paying 13½ Per cent on the amount of th
