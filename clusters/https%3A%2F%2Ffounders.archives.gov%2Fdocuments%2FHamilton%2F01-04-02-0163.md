[New York, November 24, 1787]  
To the People of the State of New-York.  
The importance of the Union, in a commercial light, is one of those points, about which there is least room to entertain a difference of opinion, and which has in fact commanded the most general assent of men, who have any acquaintance with the subject. This applies as well to our intercourse with foreign countries, as with each other.  
There are appearances to authorise a supposition, that the adventurous spirit, which distinguishes the commercial character of America, has already excited uneasy sensations in several of the maritime powers of Europe. They seem to be apprehensive of our too great interference in that carrying trade, which is the support of their navigation and the foundation of their naval strength. Those of them, which have colonies in America, look forward, to what this country is capable of becoming, with painful solicitude. They foresee the dangers, that may threaten their American dominions from the neighbourhood of States, which have all the dispositions, and would possess all the means, requisite to the creation of a powerful marine. Impressions of this kind will naturally indicate the policy of fostering divisions among us, and of depriving us as far as possible of an ACTIVE COMMERCE in our own bottoms. This would answer the threefold purpose of preventing our interference in their navigation, of monopolising the profits of our trade, and of clipping the wings, by which we might soar to a dangerous greatness. Did not prudence forbid the detail, it would not be difficult to trace by facts the workings of this policy to the cabinets of Ministers.  
If we continue united, we may counteract a policy so unfriendly to our prosperity in a variety of ways. By prohibitory regulations, extending at the same time throughout the States, we may oblige foreign countries to bid against each other, for the privileges of our markets. This assertion will not appear chimerical to those who are able to appreciate the importance of the markets of three millions of people—increasing in rapid progression, for the most part exclusively addicted to agriculture, and likely from local circumstances to remain so—to any manufacturing nation; and the immense difference there would be to the trade and navigation of such a nation, between a direct communication in its own ships, and an indirect conveyance of its products and returns, to and from America, in the ships of another country. Suppose, for instance, we had a government in America, capable of excluding Great-Britain (with whom we have at present no treaty of commerce) from all our ports, what would be the probable operation of this step upon her politics? Would it not enable us to negotiate with the fairest prospect of success for commercial privileges of the most valuable and extensive kind in the dominions of that kingdom? When these questions have bee

f the nation in favour of the American trade, and with the importunities of the West-India islands, would produce a relaxation in her present system, and would let us into the enjoyment of privileges in the markets of those islands and elsewhere, from which our trade would derive the most substantial benefits. Such a point gained from the British government, and which could not be expected without an equivalent in exemptions and immunities in our markets, would be likely to have a correspondent effect on the conduct of other nations, who would not be inclined to see themselves, altogether supplanted in our trade.  
A further resource for influencing the conduct of European nations towards us, in this respect would arise from the establishment of a fœderal navy. There can be no doubt, that the continuance of the Union, under an efficient government, would put it in our power, at a period not very distant, to create a navy, which, if it could not vie with those of the great maritime powers, would at least be of respectable weight, if thrown into the scale of either of two contending parties. This would be more particularly the case in relation to operations in the West-Indies. A few ships of the line sent opportunely to the reinforcement of either side, would often be sufficient to decide the fate of a campaign, on the event of which interests of the greatest magnitude were suspended. Our position is in this respect a very commanding one. And if to this consideration we add that of the usefulness of supplies from this country, in the prosecution of military operations in the West-Indies, it will readily be perceived, that a situation so favourable would enable us to bargain with great advantage for commercial privileges. A price would be set not only upon our friendship, but upon our neutrality. By a steady adherance to the Union we may hope ere long to become the Arbiter of Europe in America; and to be able to incline the ballance of European competitions in this part of the world as our interest may dictate.  
But in the reverse of this elegible situation we shall discover, that the rivalships of the parts would make them checks upon each other, and would frustrate all the tempting advantages, which nature has kindly placed within our reach. In a state so insignificant, our commerce would be a prey to the wanton intermeddlings of all nations at war with each other; who, having nothing to fear from us, would with little scruple or remorse supply their wants by depredations on our property, as often as it fell in their way. The rights of neutrality will only be respected, when they are defended by an adequate power. A nation, despicable by its weakness, forfeits even the privilege of being neutral.  
Under a vigorous national government, the natural strength and resources of the country, directed to a common interest, would baffle all the combinations of European jealousy to restrain our growth. This situation would even take away the motive to such combinations, by inducing an impracticability of success. An active commerce, an extensive navigation, and a flourishing marine would then be the inevitable offspring of moral and physical necessity. We might defy the little arts of little politicians to controul, or vary, the irresistible and unchangeable course of nature.  
But in a state of disunion these combinations might exist, and might operate with success. It would be in the power of the maritime nations, availing themselves of our universal impotence, to prescribe the conditions of our political existence; and as they have a common interest in being our carriers, and still more in preventing our being theirs, they would in all probability combine to embarrass our navigation in such a manner, as would in effect destroy it, and confine us to a PASSIVE COMMERCE. We should thus be compelled to content ourselves with the first price of our commodities, and to see the profits of our trade snatched from us to enrich our enemies and persecutors. That unequalled spirit of enterprise, which signalises the genius of the American Merchants and Navigators, and which is in itself an inexhaustible mine of national wealth, would be stifled and lost; and poverty and disgrace would overspread a country, which with wisdom might make herself the admiration and envy of the world.  
There are rights of great moment to the trade of America, which are rights of the Union. I allude to the fisheries, to the navigation of the Western lakes and to that of the Mississippi. The dissolution of the confederacy would give room for delicate questions, concerning the future existence of these rights; which the interest of more powerful partners would hardly fail to solve to our disadvantage. The disposition of Spain with regard to the Mississippi needs no comment. France and Britain are concerned with us in the fisheries; and view them as of the utmost moment to their navigation. They, of course, would hardly reamin long indifferent to that decided mastery of which experience has shewn us to be possessed in this valuable branch of traffic; and by which we are able to undersell those nations in their own market

 wood would be of signal importance either in the view of naval strength or of national œconomy. Some of the Southern and of the middle States yield a greater plenty of iron and of better quality. Seamen must chiefly be drawn from the Northern hive. The necessity of naval protection to external or maritime commerce, does not require a particular elucidation, no more than the conduciveness of that species of commerce to the prosperity of a navy. They, by a kind of reaction, mutually beneficial, promote each other.  
An unrestrained intercourse between the States themselves will advance the trade of each, by an interchange of their respective productions, not only for the supply of reciprocal wants at home, but for exportation to foreign markets. The veins of commerce in every part will be replenished, and will acquire additional motion and vigour from a free circulation of the commodities of every part. Commercial enterprise will have much greater scope, from the diversity in the productions of different States. When the staple of one fails, from a bad harvest or unproductive crop, it can call to its aid the staple of another. The variety not less than the value of products for exportation, contributes to the activity of foreign commerce. It ca

rtial unions.  
It may perhaps be replied to this, that whether the States are united, or disunited, there would still be an intimate intercourse between them which would answer the same ends: But this intercourse would be fettered, interrupted and narrowed by a multiplicity of causes; which in the course of these Papers have been amply detailed. An unity of commercial, as well as political interests, can only result from an unity of government.  
There are other points of view, in which this subject might be placed, of a striking and animating kind. But they would lead us too far into the regions of futurity, and would involve topics not proper for a Newspaper discussion. I shall briefly observe, that our situation invites, and our interests prompt us, to aim at an ascendant in the system of American affairs. The world may politically, as well as geographically, be divided into four parts, each having a distinct set of interests. Unhappily for the other three, Europe by her arms and by her negociations, by force and by fraud, has, in different degrees, extended her dominion over them all. Africa, Asia, and America have successively felt her domination. The superiority, she has long maintained, has tempted her to plume herself as the Mistress of the World, and to consider the rest of mankind as created for her benefit. Men admired as profound philosophers have, in direct terms, attributed to her inhabitants a physical superiority; and have gravely asserted that all animals, and with them the human species, degenerate in America—that even dogs cease to bark after having breathed a while in our atmosphere.

Facts have too long supported these arrogant pretensions of the European: It belongs to us to vindicate the honor of the human race, and to teach that assuming brother moderation. Union will enable us to do it. Disunion will add another victim to his triumphs. Let Americans disdain to be the instruments of European greatness! Let the thirteen States, bound together in a strict and indissoluble union, concur in erecting one great American system, superior to the controul of all trans-atlantic force or influence, and able to dictate the terms of the connection between the old and the new world!

** There can be no doubt,” says Gen. Hamilton, “ that  
the continuance of the union, under an efficient govern: |  
ment, would put it in our poWer, al a per od not very far |  
slistant, to create anavy, which if it could not vie with those  
of the great maritime powers, would at least be of respec-  
table weight, if thrown imto the scale of cither of two con-  
tending parties. By a steady adhereme to the union, we  
may hope, ere long, to become the arbiter of Europe in |  
America ; and to be able to incline the balance of Europe- |  
an competitions, in this part of the world, as our interest  
may dictate.  
  
** But in the reverse of this eligible situation, we shall |  
discover, that the rivalshipsofthe parts would make them  
ehecks upon each other, and would frustrate all the tempt-  
ing advantages, which nature has kindly placed within  
our reach. In a state so insignificant, our commerce |  
would be a prey to the wanton inter meddli ngs of all na- |  
  
|  
  
  
  
tions, at war With each other; who having nothing to fear  
from. us, would with jiitle ‘struple or remors¢, supply  
their wants, by depredations on our property, «s often as  
it fell intheir way. The rights of neutrality will on’y be res-  
pected, when they are defended by an adequate power «1  
  
of being neutral  
  
Under a vigorous national government, the natura!  
strength, and resources of the country, directed to a com-  
mon interest, would baffle a. the combi: ations of Rurope-  
an jealousy to restrain our growth.  
even take away the motive of such combinations, by indu  
cing an impracticabilit, of success. Anactive commerce,  
and extensive navigation. a flourishing marine, would the:  
he the inevitable offspring of moral and physical necess:-  
ty. Wemight defy the little arts of ba Ue politi cians to  
contrioul, or vary, the irresistible and unchangeable course  
of nature.  
  
“ Bui in a state of disunion, these comb  
exist, and might operate with success. Ik would be in the  
power of the maritime nations, avaiiny themeeives of on  
universal impotence, to prescribe the cond:tians of ot r politic-

them, which would answer the same ends; but this intercourse  
would be fettered, interrupted, and narrowed  
by a multitude of cansee. A unity of commercial as  
well as political interests can only result from a unity  
of government.&quot; In this belief the constitution was  
adopted, and subsequent events have justified its wisdom.  
It was a constitution of mutual agreements or  
compromises, one thing being yielded by the South

to emancipate commerce, and establish free-trade. ‘By pro-  
hibitory regulations,’ says he, ‘extending at the same time  
throughout the States, we may oblige foreign countries to bid  
against each other, for the privileges of our market. This  
assertion will not appear chimerical to those who are able to  
appreciate the importance, to any manufacturing nation, of  
the markets of three millions of people, increasing in rapid pro-  
gression, for the most part exclusively addicted to agriculture,  
and likely from local circumstances to remain in this disposi-  
tion; and the immense difference there would be to the trade  
and navigation of such a nation, between a direct communica-  
tion in its own ships, and an indirect conveyance of its pro-  
ducts and returns, to and from America, in the ships of another  
country. Suppose, for instance, we had a government in  
America, capable of excluding Great Britain (with whom we  
have at present no treaty of commerce) from all our ports;  
what would be the probable operation of this step upon her  
politics? Would it not enable us to negociate, with the fairest  
prospects of success, for commercial privileges of the most

Commerce. — An unrestrained intercourse between the States themselves will ad-  
vance the trade of each, by an interchange of their respective productions, not only for  
the supply of reciprocal wants at home, but for the exportation to foreign markets.  
The veins of commerce in every part will be replenished, and will acquire additional  
motion and vigor, from a free circulation of the commodities of every part. Commer-  
cial enterprise will have much greater scope from the diversity in the productions of  
different States. When the staple of one fails, from a bad harvest or unproductive  
crop, it can call to its aid the staple of another. The variety, not less than the value

allusion  
as this was certainly effective in Jay&#x27;s hands.  
But, on the whole, he had himself too much of  
the historical pose, too much of the Academican  
about him--a flavor which sends the reader  
with renewed appetite to Hamilton&#x27;s forcible,  
nervous prose, in which ideas are stripped of all  
rhetoric and go swiftly to their appointed end  
Such a passage as that just quoted, although,  
we repeat, pertinent and even eloquent, would  
be far less useful if submitted to the people in  
the present crisis than these lucid observations  
of Hamilton&#x27;s, making for the same result, but  
along more definite lines:  
A further resource, for influencing the conduct  
of European nations toward us. would  
arise from the establishment of a Federal Navy,  
There can be no doubt that the continuance of  
the Union under an efficient government would  
put it in our power, at a perlod not very distant  
to create a navy which, if it could not vie with  
those of the great maritime Powers, would at  
least be of respectable weight if thrown into the  
scale of either of the two contending parties.  
This would be more peculiarly the case in relae­  
tion to operations in the West Indies. A few  
ships of the line sent opportunely to the rein  
forcement of either side would often be sufficlent  
to decide the fate of a campaign on the event of  
which interests of the greatest magnitude were  
suspended. Our position is, in this respect, a  
most commanding one. And if to this consid  
eration we add that of the usefulness of supplies  
from this country in the prosecution of military  
operations in the West Indies, it will readily be  
perceived that a situation so favorable would  
enable us to bargain with great advantage fof  
commercial privileges A price would be set not  
only upon our friendship, but upon our neutral  
ity. By a steady adherence to the Union we  
may hope ere long to become the arbiter of  
Europe in America
