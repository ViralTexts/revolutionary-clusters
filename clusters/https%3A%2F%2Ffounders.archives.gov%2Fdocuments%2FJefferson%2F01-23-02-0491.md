 too you may be able, in your present situation, or on the road, to give it more time and reflection than you could do here at any moment.  
When you first mentioned to me your purpose of retiring from the government, tho’ I felt all the magnitude of the event, I was in a considerable degree silent. I knew that, to such a mind as yours, persuasion was idle and impertinent: that before forming your decision, you  had weighed all the reasons for and against the measure, had made up your mind on full view of them, and that there could be little hope of changing the result. Pursuing my reflections too I knew we were some day to try to walk alone, and if the essay should be made while you should be alive and looking on, we should derive confidence from that circumstance, and resource if it failed. The public mind too was then calm and confident, and therefore in a favorable state for making the experiment. Had no change of circumstances supervened, I should not, with any hope of success, have now ventured to propose to you a change of purpose. But the public mind is no longer so confident and serene; and that from causes in which you are no ways personally mixed. Tho these causes have been hackneyed in the public papers in detail, it may not be amiss, in order to calculate the effect they are capable of producing, to take a view of them in the mass, giving to each the form, real or imaginary, under which they have been presented

.  
It has been urged then that a public debt, greater than we can possibly pay before other causes of adding new debt to it will occur, has been artificially created, by adding together the whole amount of the debtor and creditor sides of accounts, instead of taking only their balances, which could have been paid off in a short time: That this accumulation of debt has taken for ever out of our power those easy sources of revenue, which, applied to the ordinary necessities and exigencies of government, would have answered them habitually, and covered us from habitual murmurings against taxes and tax-gatherers, reserving extraordinary calls, for those extraordinary occasions which would animate the people to meet them: That though the calls for money have been no greater than we must generally expect, for the same or equivalent exigencies, yet we are already obliged to strain the impost till it produces clamour, and will produce evasion, and war on our own citizens to collect it: and even to resort to an Excise law, of odious character with the people, partial in it’s operation, unproductive unless enforced by arbitrary and vexatious means, and committing the authority of the government, in parts where resistance is most probable, and coercion least practicable. They cite propositions in Congress and suspect other projects on foot still to increase the mass of debt. They say that by borrowing at ⅔ of the interest, we might have paid off the principal in ⅔ of the time: but that from this we are precluded by it’s being made irredeemable but in small portions and long terms: That this irredeemable quality was given it for the avowed purpose of inviting it’s transfer to foreign countries. They predict that this transfer of the principal, when compleated, will occasion an exportation of 3. millions of dollars annually for the  interest, a drain of coin, of which as there has been no example, no calculation can be made of it’s consequences: That the banishment of our coin will be compleated by the creation of 10. millions of paper money, in the form of bank bills, now issuing into circulation. They think the 10. or 12. percent annual profit paid to the lenders of this paper medium are taken out of the pockets of the people, who would have had without interest the coin it is banishing: That all the capital employed in paper speculation is barren and useless, producing, like that on a gaming table, no accession to itself, and is withdrawn from commerce and agriculture where it would have produced addition to the common mass: That it nourishes in our citizens habits of vice and idleness instead of industry and morality: That it has furnished effectual means of corrupting such a portion of the legislature, as turns the balance between the honest voters which ever way it is directed: That this corrupt squadron, deciding the voice of the legislature, have manifested their dispositions to get rid of the limitations imposed by the constitution on the general legislature, limitations, on the faith of which, the states acceded to that instrument: That the ultimate object of all this is to prepare the way for a change, from the present republican form of government, to that of a monarchy, of which the English constitution is to be the model. That this was contemplated in the Convention, is no secret, because it’s partisans have made none of it. To effect it then was impracticable; but they are still eager after their object, and are predisposing every thing for it’s ultimate attainment. So many of them have got into the legislature, that, aided by the corrupt squadron of paper dealers, who are at their devotion, they make a majority in both houses. The republican party, who wish to preserve the government in it’s present form, are fewer in number. They are fewer even when joined by the two, three, or half dozen anti-federalists, who, tho they dare not avow it, are still opposed to any general government: but being less so to a republican than a monarchical one, they naturally join those whom they think pursuing the lesser evil.  
Of all the mischiefs objected to the system of measures beforementioned, none is so afflicting, and fatal to every honest hope, as the corruption of the legislature. As it was the earliest of these measures it became the instrument for producing the rest, and will be the instrument for producing in future a king, lords and commons, or whatever else those who direct it may chuse. Withdrawn such a distance from the eye of their constituents, and these so dispersed as to be inaccessible to public information, and particularly to that of the conduct of their own representatives, they will form the most corrupt government  on earth, if the means of their corruption be not prevented. The only hope of safety hangs now on the numerous representation which is to come forward the ensuing year. Some of the new members will probably be either in principle or interest, with the present majority. But it is expected that the great mass will form an accession to the republican party. They will not be able to undo all which the two preceding legislatures, and especially the first have done. Public faith and right will oppose this. But some parts of the system may be rightfully reformed; a liberation from the rest unremittingly pursued as fast as right will permit, and the door shut in future against similar commitments of the nation. Should the next legislature take this course, it will draw upon them the whole monarchical and paper interest. But the latter I think will not go all lengths with the former, because creditors will never, of their own accord, fly off entirely from their debtors. Therefore this is the alternative least likely to produce convulsion. But should the majority of the new members be still in the same principles with the present and shew that we have nothing to expect but a continuance of the same practices, it is not easy to conjecture what would be the result, nor what means would be resorted to for correction of the evil. True wisdom would direct that they should be temperate and peaceable. But the division of sentiment and interest happens unfortunately to be so geographical, that no mortal can say that what is most wise and temperate would prevail against what is more easy and obvious? I can scarcely contemplate a more incalculable evil than the breaking of the union into two or more parts. Yet when we review the mass which opposed the original coalescence, when we consider that it lay chiefly in the Southern quarter, that the legislature have availed themselves of no occasion of allaying it, but on the contrary whenever Northern and Southern prejudices have come into conflict, the latter have been sacrificed and the former soothed; that the owers of the debt are in the Southern and the holders of it in the Northern division; that the Antifederal champions are now strengthened in argument by the fulfilment of their predictions; that this has been brought about by the Monarchical federalists themselves, who, having been for the new government merely as a stepping stone to monarchy, have themselves adopted the very constructions of the constitution, of which, when advocating it’s acceptance before the tribunal of the people, they declared it insusceptible; that the republican federalists, who espoused the same government for it’s intrinsic merits, are disarmed of their weapons, that which they denied as prophecy being now become true history: who can be sure that these things may not proselyte the small number which was wanting to place the  majority on the other side? And this is the event at which I tremble, and to prevent which I consider your continuance at the head of affairs as of the last importance. The confidence of the whole union is centered in you. Your being at the helm, will be more than an answer to every argument which can be used to alarm and lead the people in any quarter into violence or secession. North and South will hang together, if they have you to hang on: and, if the first corrective of a numerous representation should fail in it’s effect, your presence will give time for trying others not inconsistent with the union and peace of the states.  
I am perfectly aware of the oppression under which your present office lays your mind, and of the ardor with which you pant for retirement to domestic life. But there is sometimes an eminence of character on which society have such peculiar claims as to controul the predilection of the individual for a particular walk of happiness, and restrain him to that alone arising from the present and future benedictions of mankind. This seems to be your condition, and the law imposed on you by providence in forming your character, and fashioning the events on which it was to operate: and it is to motives like these, and not to personal anxieties of mine or others who have no right to call on you for sacrifices, that I appeal from your former determination and urge a revisal of it, on the ground of change in the aspect of things. Should an honest majority result from the new and enlarged representation; should those acquiesce whose principles or interests they may controul, your wishes for retirement would be gratified with less danger, as soon as that shall be manifest, without awaiting the completion of the second period of four years. One or two sessions will determine the crisis: and I cannot but hope that you can resolve to add one or two more to the many years you have already sacrificed to the good of mankind.  
The fear of suspicion that any selfish motive of continuance in office may enter into this sollicitation on my part obliges me to declare that no such motive exists. It is a thing of mere indifference to the public whether I retain or r

Enough has now been sald to show, thiat the ond  
Federal party was the father of the National Bank.  
It only now remains to be shown, that Jefferson  
and his friends were opposed to a National Bank  
and were in favor of a plan similar to that of the  
Independent Treasury for collecting, keeping, and  
disbursing the public money, to establish the po-  
sition assumed, that the line of demarkation be­  
tween the two great parties of the day has been a  
National Bank or an Independent Treasury.  
In 1792, Mr. Jefferson, in a letter to Washington  
speaking of the plan of establishing a National Hank  
says.  
The 10 or 12 per cent, annual proffit paid to the lenders  
of this paper medium are taken out of the pockets of the  
people, who would have had, without interest the coin it  
as banishing, that all the eapital employed in paper spec-  
ulatiou is harren and useless, producing like that on the  
gaming tabie, no accessions to itself and is withdrawn from  
commerce and agriculture where it would have produced  
addition to the mass, that it nourished in our citizens hah­  
its of vice and idleness, instead of industry and morality,  
that it has furnished effectual means of corrupting such a  
portion of the Legislature as turns the ballance between the  
honest voter whichever way it is directed; that this squad­  
ron, deciding the voice of the legislature, have manifested  
their disposition to get rid of the limitations imposed by  
the Constitution on the General Legislature--limitations on  
the faith of which the States acceded to that instrument,  
that the ultimate object of all this is to prepare the way for  
a change from the present form of Government to that of a  
Monarchy, of which the English constitution is to be the  
model.&quot;  
The contents of this letter were communicatd to  
Col. Hamilton, by Gen Washington, requesting a  
rsply, and a statement of his views on the subject.  
Gol H. replied, but his reply was surpressed by his  
friends. It is said to have embodied his monarchi­  
cal views in full. It was a difference of opinion  
on this questlon that caused the seperation of these  
two great men from the cabinet of Washington,  
and it was the same question, on which Mr Jeffer-  
son appealed to the peeple at the time he was so

the ultimate object of oil this is to preparo the way  
for a change from the present republican form of  
government to that of a monarchy, of which the

its partisans made none of it. To effect it then was  
impracticable; hut they arc still eager after

istence to make a choice of President from among  
the rival statesmen who surrounded him.  
Jefferson was as importunate as any. In a letter  
written to the President on the 23d of the same  
month of May, he says:  
When you first mentioned to me your purpose of ree­  
tiring from the Government, though I felt all the mag­  
nitude of the event, I was in a considerable degree  
silent. I knew that, to such a mind as yours, persuasion  
was idle and impertinent; that before forming your de-­  
cis on you had weigned all the reasons for and against  
the measure, had made up your mind in full view of  
them, and that there couid be little hope of changing  
sult. Pursuing my reflections, too, I knew we  
were somne day to try to walk alone, and if the essay  
should be made while you should be alive and looking  
on, we should derive confidence trom that circumstance,  
and resource, if it failed. The public mind, too, was  
calm and confident, and therefore in a favorable state  
for making the experiment. Had no change of circum­  
stances intervened, I should not with any hopes of suc  
cess have now ventured to propose to you a change of  
purpose. But the publio mind is no longer confident  
and serene; and that from causes in which you are no  
ways personally mixed. Though these causes have been  
hackneyed in the public papers in detail, it may not be  
in order to calcuiate the effect they are capable  
of producing, to take a view of them in the mass, giving  
to each the form, real or imaginary, under which they  
have been presented.  
He conclud  
The confidence of the whole Union is centered in you.  
Your being at the helm will be more than an answer to  
every argument which can be used to alarm and lead  
the people in any quarter into violence and secession.  
North and South will hang together if they have you to  
hang on; and if the first correction of a numerous repre.  
sentation should fail in its effect, your presence will  
give time for trying others, not inconsistent with the  
union and peace of the States.  
I am perfectly aware of the oppression under which  
your present office lays your mind, and of the ardor with  
which you pant for domestic life. But there is some-  
times an eminence of character on which society have  
such peculiar claims as to control the predilections of  
the individual for a particular walk of happiness, and  
restrain him to that atone arising from the present and  
future benedictions of mankind. This seems to be your

forming your character and fashioning the events on  
which it was to operate; and it is to motives like these,  
and not to personal anxieties of mine or others who have  
no right to call on you for sacrifices, that I appeal and  
urge a revisal of it, on the ground of change in the aspect

quiesce whose principies or interest they may control,  
your wishes for retirement would be gratified with less  
danger, as soon as that shall be manifest, without a wait­

716 APPENDIX.  
  
nearing their close, Hamilton and Jefferson severally urged Wash-  
ington to consent to remain at the helm for four years longer, that  
the Government might acquire additional firmness and strength  
before being subjected to the strain of the contention of parties.  
  
Undoubtedly Hamilton desired this also, because of nearer coin-  
cidence of thought on some questions involving serious difference  
of opinion, but both concurred in urging it upon the ground that  
the confidence of the whole Union was centred in Washington,  
and his being at the helm would be more than an answer to every  
argument which could be used to alarm and lead the people in  
any quarter into violence or secession.

scheme and associated measures he asserts, under the form of reporting the views of  
others: “ That all the capital employed in paper speculation is barren and useless,  
producing, like that on a gaming table, no accession to itself, and is withdrawn from  
commerce and agriculture where it would have produced addition to the common  
mass: that it nourishes in our citizens habits of vice and idleness, instead of industry  
and morality: that it has furnished effectual means of corrupting such a portion of  
the legislature as turns the balance between the honest voters whichever way it is  
directed: that this corrupt squadron, deciding the voice of the legislature, have man-  
ifested their dispositions to get rid of the limitations imposed by the constitution on  
the general legislature, limitations on the faith of which the states acceded to that  
instrument: that the ultimate object of all this is to prepare the way for a change  
from the present republican form of government to that of a monarchy, of which  
the English constitution is to be the model.” Jefferson’s Works, III, 359

The Republican party, who wish to preserve the  
government in its present form, are fewer in number  
than the Federalists. They are fewer when joined  
by the two, three, or half a dozen Anti-Federalists,  
who, though they dare not avow it, are still opposed  
to any general government, but, being less so to a  
republican than to a monarchial one, they naturally  
join those whom they think to be pursuing the
