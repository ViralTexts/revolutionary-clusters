f the return of our post, it was not possible to make so prompt a dispatch of the answer. Of all the doctrines which have ever been broached by the federal government, the novel one of the common law being in force &amp; cognisable as an existing law in their courts, is to me the most formidable. all their other assumptions of  un-given powers have been in the details. the banklaw, the treaty doctrine, the sedition act, alien act, the undertaking to change the state-laws of evidence in the state courts by certain parts of the stamp act, &amp;c. &amp;c. have been solitary unconsequential timid things in comparison of the audacious, barefaced and sweeping pretension to a system of law for the US. without the adoption of their legislature and so infinitely beyond their power to adopt. if this assumption is yielded to, the state courts

 to establish the just deductions, for before the revolution the nation of Virginia had by the organs they then thought proper to constitute, established a system of laws, which they divided into three dominations of 1. common law. 2. statute law. 3. Chancery. or if you please into two only of 1. Common law. 2. Chancery. when by the declaration of Independance they chose to abolish their former organs for declaring their will, the acts of will already formally &amp; constitutionally declared, remained untouched. for the nation was not dissolved, was not annihilated; it’s will therefore remained in full vigour: and on the establishing the new organs, first of a convention, &amp; afterwards a more complicated legislature, the old acts of national will continued in force, until the nation should by it’s new organs declare it’s will changed. the common law therefore, which was not in force when we landed here, nor till we had formed ourselves into a nation, and had manifested by the organs we constituted, that the common law was to be our law, continued to be our law, because the nation continued in being, &amp; because tho’ it changed the organs for the future declarations of it’s will, yet it did not change it’s former declarations that the common law was it’s law. apply these principles to the present case. before the revolution there existed no such nation as the US. they then first associated as a nation but for special purposes only. they had all their laws to make, as Virginia had on her first establishment as a nation. but they did not, as Virginia had done, proceed to adopt a whole system of laws ready made to their hand. as their association as a nation was only for special purposes, to wit for the management of their concerns with one another &amp; with foreign nations, and the states composing the association chose to give it powers for those purposes &amp; no others, they could not adopt any general system, because it would have embraced objects on which this association had no right to form or declare a will. it was not the organ for declaring a national will in these cases. in the cases confided to them, they were free to declare the will of the nation, the law, but till it was declared there could be no law. so that the common law did not become ipso facto law on the new association, it could only become so by a positive adoption. &amp; so far only as they were authorized to adopt.  
I think it will be of great importance, when you come to the proper part to pourtray at full length the consequences of this new doctrine that the common law is the law of the US.

the principles on which those courts use the common  
law. He says “before the revolution, the nation of  
Virginia had, by the organs they then thought proper to  
constitute, established a system of laws’’—of common  
law and chancery. “When, by the Declaration of In-  
dependence, they chose to abolish their former organs of  
declaring their will, the acts of will already formally and  
constitutionally declared, remained untouched. For the  
nation was not dissolved, was not annihilated; its will,  
therefore remained in full vigor; and on the establishing  
the new organs, first, of a convention, and atterwards a  
more complicated legislature, the old acts of national will  
continued in force, until the nation should, by its new or-  
gans, declare its will changed. ‘The common law, there-  
tore, which was not in force when we landed here, nor  
till we had formed ourselves into a nation, and had mani«  
fested by the organs we constituted, that the common law  
was to be our law, continued to be our law, because the  
nation continued in being, and because, though it changed  
the organs for future declarations of its will, yet it did not  
change its former deelarations, that the common law  
was tts law.—Apply these principles to the present case.  
Betore the revolution there existed no such nation as the  
United States; they then first associated as a nation, but  
for special purposes only. “hey had all their laws to  
make as Virginia bad on her first settlement as a nation;  
but they did not proceed as Virginia had done, to adopt  
a whole system of laws ready made at their hand. As  
their association as a nation was only for special purpo-  
ses, to wit, for the management of their concerns with  
one another, and with foreign nations, and the states  
composing the association chose to give it power for  
those purposes, and no other; they could not adopt any  
general system, because it would have embraced objects  
on which this association had no right to form, or de-  
clare its will, It was not the organ tor declaring the na-  
tional will in these cases. Io the cases confided to them,  
they were free to declare the will of the nation to be the  
law, but wll at was declared, there could be no law: so  
that the common law did not become ipso fucio law on  
the new association. It could only become so by posi-  
tive adoption, and so tur as they were authorized to  
adopt.”’ ’
