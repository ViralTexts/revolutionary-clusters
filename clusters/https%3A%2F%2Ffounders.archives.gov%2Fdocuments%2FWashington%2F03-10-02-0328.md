A small travelling Press to follow Head Quarters would be productive of many eminent advantages—It would enable us to give speedy and exact information of any Military transactions that take place with proper comments upon them; and thereby frustrate the pernicious tendency of falshood and misrepresentation, which, in my opinion of whatever complexion they may be, are in the main detrimental to our cause. If the People had a channel of intelligence, that from its usual authenticity they could look up to with confidence, they might often be preserved from that despondency, which they are apt to fall into from the exaggerated pictures our Enemies and their Emissaries among us commonly draw of any misfortunes we meet with, and from that diffidence of truths favorable to us which they must naturally feel from the frequent deception they are exposed to, by the extravagant colourings our friends often give to our successes. It would also be very useful to dispatch business in Camp, being the most expeditious means of taking Copies of any orders or other matters that require to be dispersed and would save a good deal in returns and other Papers we are often obliged to get Printed in Philadelphia. An ingenious Man to accompany this Press and be employed wholly in writing for it might render it singularly beneficial.  
I am exceedingly embarrassed how to dispose of the French Officers  
  
in General, but more especially the Artillery Officers, who are come out under the sanction of a compact. I can think of no other way
