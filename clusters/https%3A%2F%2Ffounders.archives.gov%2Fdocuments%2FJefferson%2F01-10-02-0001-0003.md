4. A succinct account of Paper money.  
Previous to the late revolution, most of the states were in the habit, whenever they had occasion for more money than could be raised immediately by taxes, to issue paper notes or bills, in the name of the state, wherein they promised to pay to the bearer the sum named in the note or bill. In some of the states no time of paiment was fixed, nor tax laid to enable paiment. In these the bills depreciated, but others of the states named in the bill the day when it should be paid, laid taxes to bring in money enough for that purpose, and paid the bills punctually on or before the day named. In these states, paper money was in as high estimation as gold and silver. On the commencement of the late revolution, Congress had no money. The external commerce of the states being suppressed, the farmer could not sell his produce, and of course could not pay a tax. Congress had no resource then but in paper money. Not being able to lay a tax for it’s redemption they could only promise that taxes should be laid for that purpose so as to redeem the bills by a certain day. They did not foresee the long continuance of the war, the almost total suppression of their exports, and other events which rendered the performance of their engagement impossible. The paper money continued for a twelvemonth equal to gold and silver. But the quantities which they were obliged to emit for the purposes of the war exceeded what had been the usual quantity of the circulating medium. It began therefore to become cheaper, or as we expressed it, it depreciated as gold and silver would have done, had they been thrown into circulation in equal quantities. But not having, like them, an intrinsic value, it’s depreciation was more rapid and greater than could ever have happened with them. In two years it had fallen to two dollars of paper for one of silver. In three years to 4. for 1., in 9. months more it fell to 10. for 1. and in the six months following, that is to say, by Sep. 1779. it had fallen to 20. for 1. Congress, alarmed at the consequences which were to be apprehended should they lose this resource altogether, thought it necessary to make a vigorous effort to stop it’s further depreciation. They therefore determined in the first place that their emissions should not exceed 200. millions of dollars, to which term they were then nearly arrived, and tho’ they knew that 20 dollars of what they were then issuing would buy no more for their army than one silver dollar would buy, yet they thought it would be worth while to submit to the sacrifice of 19. out of 20. dollars, if they could thereby stop further depreciation. They therefore published an address to their constituents in which they renewed their original  declarations that this paper money should be redeemed at dollar for dollar, they proved the ability of the states to do this, and that their liberty would be cheaply bought at that price. The declaration was ineffectual. No man received the money at a better rate; on the contrary in six months more, that is by March 1780, it was fallen to 40. for 1. Congress then tried an experiment of a different kind. Considering their former offers to redeem this money at par, as relinquished by the general refusal to take it but in progressive depreciation, they required the whole to be brought in, declared it should be redeemed at it’s present value of 40 for 1. and that they would give to the holders new bills reduced in their denomination to the sum of gold or silver which was actually to be paid for them. This would reduce the nominal sum of the mass in circulation to the present worth of that mass, which was 5 millions, a sum not too great for the circulation of the states, and which they therefore hoped would not depreciate further, as they continued firm in their purpose of emitting no more. This effort was as unavailing as the former. Very little of the money was brought in. It continued to circulate and to depreciate till the end of 1780., when it had fallen to 75. for one, and the money circulated from the French army being by that time sensible in all the states North of the Potowmac, the paper ceased it’s circulation altogether, in those states. In Virginia and N. Carolina it continued a year longer, within which time it fell to 1000 for 1. and then expired, as it had done in the other states, without a single groan. Not a murmur was heard on this occasion among the people. On the contrary universal congratulations took place on their seeing this gigantic mass, whose dissolution had threatened convulsions which should shake their infant confederacy to it’s center, quietly interred in it’s grave. Foreigners indeed who do not, like the natives, feel indulgence for it’s memory, as of a being which has vindicated their liberties and fallen in the moment of victory, have been loud and still are loud. A few of them have reason. But the most noisy are not the best of them. They are persons who have become bankrupt by unskilful attempts at commerce with America. That they may have some pretext to offer to their creditors, they have bought up great masses of this dead money in America, where it is to be had at 5000 for 1. and they shew the certificates of their paper possessions as if it had all died in their hands, and had been the cause of their bankruptcy. Justice will be done to all, by paying to all persons what this money actually cost them, with an interest of 6. per cent from the time they received it. If difficulties present themselves in the ascertaining  the epoch of the receipt, it has been thought better that the state should lose by admitting easy proofs, than that individuals and especially foreigners should, by being held to such as would be difficult, perhaps impossible.  
5. Virginia certainly owed two millions sterling to Great Britain at the conclusion of the war. Some have conjectured the debt as high as three millions. I think that state owed near as much as all the rest put together. This is to be ascribed to peculiarities in the tobacco trade. The advantages made by the British merchants on the tobaccoes consigned to them were so enormous that they spared no means of increasing those consignments. A powerful engine for this purpose was the giving good prices and credit to the planter, till they got him more immersed in debt than he could pay without selling his lands or slaves. They then reduced the prices given for his tobacco so that let his shipments be ever so great, and his demand of necessaries ever so œconomical, they never permitted him to clear off his debt. These debts had become hereditary from father to son for many generations, so that the planters were a species of property annexed to certain mercantile houses in London.

Paper Money in America.  
  
“ Previous to the late revolution, most of the  
states were in the habit, whenever they had occasion  
for more money than could be raised immediately,  
by taxes, to issue paper notes or bills, in the name  
of the state, wherein they promised to pay to the

could not sell his produce, and, of course, could not  
pay atax. Congress had no resource then, but in

should be laid for that purpose, so as to redeem the  
bills by a certain day. They did not foresee the

pression of their exports, and other events, which  
rendered the performance of their engagement im-  
possible. The paper money continued, for a twelve-  
month, equal to gold and silver. But the quantities  
which they were obliged to emit, for the purposes  
of the war, exceeded what had been the usual  
  
uantity of the circulating medium. It began, there-  
ore, to become cheaper, or, as we expressed it, it

or one of silver; in three years, to four for one ;  
in nine months more, it fell to ten for one; and in  
the six months following, that is to say, by Sep-

They, therefore, determined, in the first place, that

for their army than one silver dollar would buy,  
yet they thought it would be worth while, to sub-  
mit to the sacrifice of nineteen out of twenty dollars,  
if they could thereby stop further depreciation.  
They, therefore, published an address to their con-  
stituents, in which they renewed their original de-  
clarations, that this paper money should be redeem-

the states to do this, and that their liberty would

this portion of the history further. Congress, at length,  
alarmed at the consequences should they lose the resource  
of paper money altogether, made a vigorous effort to stop  
the downward course of depreciation. The cause they  
saw was that more had beem issued than the normal  
quantity required for the business of the people. They  
therefore, in September, 1779, determined that the  
amount afloat should not exceed at any time two hundred  
millions of dollars, to which sum they were then nearly  
arrived. Although they knew that twenty dollars of  
what thoy were then emitting would buy no more for their  
army than one silver dollar would buy, yet they thought  
it would be worth while to submit to the sacrifice of nine.­  
teen out of twenty dollars if they could thereby stop fur-­

their constituents, in which they renewed their declara-­

for dollar. They entered into long statistical arguments  
to prove that the States were able to fulfil this engage.­

preciation.  
Very little of the money, however, was brought in. It  
continued to circulate and depreciate till the end of 1780,  
when it had fallen to seventy-five for one. At this time the  
money circulated from the Fronch army, and by means  
of the loan from Holland, France and Spain became sensi­

money circulated by the French army, which had arrived to sup-

men discussed the problem whether this conflict of  
fceling and interests would not lead to a separa-­  
tion as soon as the colonies had sufficient strength  
to effect it.  
DuRING THE REVOLUTION.  
Several years previous to the Revolution most of  
the States were in the habit, notwithstanding the  
impertal prohibition, whenever they had occasion  
for more money than could be raised immediately  
taxes, to issue paper, notes or bilis, in the name  
of the State, wherein they promised to pay to the  
bearer the sum named in the note or bill. In some  
of the States no time of payment was fixed nor tax  
lald to enable payment. In these the bills depre­  
clated. But others of the States named in the bill  
the day when it should be paid, laid taxes to bring  
in money enough for the purpose and paid the bills  
yunctualty on or before the day mameth. in these  
tates paper money was in as hign estimation as  
gold and silver. On the commencement of the itev­  
olution Congress had no money. The external  
commerce of the States being suppressed, the  
farmer could not sell his produce, and, of course,  
could not pay a tax. Congress had no recourse  
then but in paper money. Not being able to  
lay a tax for its redemption, they could only  
promise that taxes would be laid for that purpose  
so as to redeem the bills by a certain day. They  
did not foresee the long continuance of the war,  
the almost suppression of their exports and other  
events which rendered the performance of their  
engagements impossible.  
The sAper woney Continued eotal to ooLd  
and silver for a twelvemonth. But the quantities  
waich they were obliged to emit for the purposes  
of the war exceeded what had been the usual  
quantity of the circulating medium. It began,  
therefore, to become cheaper, or it depreciated as  
gold and silver would have done had ther been  
  
I thrown into circulation in equat quantities. But  
not having, like them, an intrinsic value, its depre,­  
clation was more rapid and greater than could  
ever have happened with them. In two years it  
had fallen to two dollars of paper money for one in  
sllver; in three years to four to one: in nine months  
more it fell to ten to one, and in the six months lor­  
lowing, that is to say, by September, 1779, it had  
tallen to  
TWENTY DOLLARs in PApEr FOR ONE IN SILver.  
 Congress alarmed at the consequences which  
 were to be apprehended should they lose this  
 resource altogether, thought it necessary to make  
a vigorous effort to stop its turther depreciation.  
They therefore determined in the airst place that  
 their emissions should not exceed $200,000,000, to  
which term they were then nearly arrived; and  
though they knew that $20 of what they were then  
issuing would buy no more for their army than  
one silver dollar would buy, yet they thought that  
it would be worth while to submit to the sacrifice  
of $19 out of $20 if they could thereby stop further  
depreciation. They therefore published an address  
to their constituents in which they renewed their  
original declarations, that this paper money should  
e  
REDEEMED AT DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR.  
They proved the abinty of the States to do this,  
and that their utbersy would be cheaply bought at  
that price. The declaration was mnenectual. No  
man received the money at a better rate. They  
even went further. On the 14th January, 1777

country. This was atso ineffectual. In six months  
more it had fallen to forty for one. Congress then  
tried an experiment of a different kind. Consider­  
ing their former offers to redeem this money at par  
as relinquished by the general refusal to take it but  
in progressive depreciation, they required the  
whole to be brought in, declared that it should be  
redeemed at its present value of forty for one and  
that they would give to the nolders new bils, re.­  
duced in their denomination to the sum of gold  
or silver which was actually to be paid for them.  
This reduced the nominal sum of  
The Mass in Circulation  
to the present worth of that mass, which was  
$5,000,000,-a sum not too great for the circulation  
of the States, and which they, therefore, prayed  
would not depreciate further, as they continued  
firm in their purpose of emitting no more. This  
effort was as unavailing as the former. Very  
little of the money was brought in. It  
continued to circulate and to depreciate till  
the end of 1780, when it had fallen to seventy-­  
five for one; and the money circulated from the  
French army, being by that time sensibly current  
in all the States north of the Potomac, the paper  
ceased its circulation altogether in these States.

not, like the natives, feel indulgence for its memory  
as of a being which had vindicated their liberties  
and fatlen in the moment of victory, long con-­  
tinued loud in their complaints. Many of them  
were persons who had become bankrupt by un-­  
skilful attempts at commerce with America.  
Justice was at last done to all by paying what the  
paper actually cost them, with interest at six per  
cent from the time they received it. In deter-

on page 405 of the same volume of his  
works, Mr. Jefferson says: &quot;That pa­  
per is poverty, that it is only the ghost  
of money, and not money itself.  
Come up here some Populist and see  
that I have read this right. You who  
have been swearing by Jefferson. If  
you propose to follow Jefferson, you  
must get out of the Populist camp.  
He says that the kind of money which  
you people advocate is poverty- that it  
is only the ghost of money, and not  
money itself.  
They did not foresee the long con  
tinuance of the war, the almost total  
suppression of their exports, and other  
events which rendered the perform­  
ance of their engagement impossible,  
Paper money continued for a twelve­  
month equal to gold and silver. But  
the quantites which they were obliged  
to emit for the purposes of war e  
ceeded what had been the usual quan  
tity of the circulating medium. It be­  
gan, therefore, to become cheaper, or,  
as we expressed it, it depreciated, as  
gold and silver would have done had  
they been thrown in circulation in  
equal quantities. But not having, like  
them, an intrinsic value, its deprecia­  
tion was more rapid and greater than  
could ever have happened with them. In  
two years it had fallen to two dollars  
of paper money for one of silver; in  
three years to four for one; in nine  
months more it fell to ten for one, and  
in the six months following, that is to  
say by September, 1779, it had fallen  
to twenty for one
