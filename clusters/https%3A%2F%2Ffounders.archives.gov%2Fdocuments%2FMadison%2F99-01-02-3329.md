Department of State,  
July 22d, 1808.  
  
Your dispatches by lieutenant  
Lewis were delivered on the 8th  
instant.  
  
It is regretted that the interval  
between his arrival and the date  
of your letter to Mr. Champag-  
ny, during which I presume  
some verbal intercommunication  
must have taken place, had _ pro-  
duced no indication of a favorable  
change in the views of the French  
roverament with respect to its  
decrees ; and still more that in-  
stead of an early and favorable  
answer to your letter, it should  
have been followed by such a de-  
cree asis reported to have been  
issued on the 22d April, at Bay-  
onne. The decree has not yet  
reached the United States, and  
  
therefore its precise import can-.  
  
not be ascertained. But if it  
  
should be, as it is represented, a  
  
sweeping stroke at all American  
  
vessels on the high seas, it will  
  
not only extend our demands of  
VOL. Iv.  
  
reparation, but is rendered the  
more ominous with respect to the  
temper and views of the emperor  
towards the United States by the  
date of the measure.  
  
The arrival of Mr. Baker with  
my letter of May 2d, of which a  
copy is herewith sent, will have  
enabled you to resume the sub-  
ject of the decrees with the fair-  
€st opportunity that could be  
given to the French government  
for a change of the unjust and  
unwise course which has been  
pursued, and I assure myself that  
you will not have failed to turn  
the communications with which  
you are furnished to the best ac-  
count. If France does not wish  
to throw the United States into  
the war against her, for which it  
is impossible to find a rational or  
plausible inducement, she ought  
not to hesitate a moment in re-  
voking at least so much of her  
decrees as violate the rights of  
the sea, and furnish to her adver-  
sary the pretext for his retaliating  
measures. It would seem as if  
the imperial cabinet had never  
paid sufficient attention to the  
smallness of the sacrifice which  
a repeal of that portion of its sys-  
tem would involve, if an act of  
justice is to be called a sacti-  
fice.  
  
The information by the return  
of the Osage from England, is  
not more satisfactory than that  
from France. Nothing was said  
on the subject of the Chesapeake,  
nor any thing done or promised  
as to the orders in council. It is  
probable that further accounts  
from the United States were  
waited for, and that the arrival of  
the St. Michael will have led to  
a manifestation of the real views  
ef that goyernment en those and  
  
122 AMERICAN  
  
other subjects. In the mean time  
it cannot be doubted that hopes  
were cherished there of some  
events in this country favourable  
to the policy of the Orders, and.  
particularly that the offensive lan-  
guage and proceedings of France,  
would bring on a hostile resist-  
ance from the United States; in  
which case the British govern-  
ment would be able to mould  
every thing to its satisfaction.  
‘There is much reason to believe  
that if the British government  
should not concur in a mutual  
abolition of the orders and of the  
embargo, it will result from an  
unwillingness to set an example  
  
which might be followed and

best managed, without descend-  
ing from the necessary level? In  
every view it is evidently proper,  
as faras respect to the national  
honor will allow, to avoid a style

the United States, and therefore, its pre­

it should be, as it is represented, a sweeping

“ The arrival of Mr. Baker with my let­

1 assure myself that you will not have fail­  
ed to turn the communications, with which  
you are furnished, to the best account. If  
France does hot wish to throw the United  
Stages into the war against her, ior which it  
is impossible to find a rational or plausible  
inducement, she ought not to hesitate a mo­  
ment in revoking at least so much of her de­  
cues as violate the rights of the sea, and  
furnish to her adversary the pretext 1 r his  
retaliating measure. It would seem as if  
the imperial cabinet had never paid suffici­

be called a sacrifice.  
“ I lie information by&#x27; the return of the  
Osage Irom England is no: more satisfactory  
than that from France. Nothing was said  
on. the subject -»:f the Chesapeake, nor any  
thing done or promised, as to the orders in  
council. It is probable that further accounts  
from the U. States were waited for and that  
the arrival rf the St. Michael will have Jed  
to h manifestation of the real views of that  
government on those and other subjects. In  
the mean time it cannot be doubted, that  
hopes were cherished there of some events  
in this country favorable to the policy of the  
orders, and particularly, that the offensive  
language and proceedings of France would  
bring on a hostile resitance from the U. S.;  
in which case the British government would  
be able uynould every thing to its satisfaction,  
f here is much reason to believe that if the  
British government should not concur in a mu­  
tual abolition of the orders and of theembar­  
go.it will result from an unwillingness, to set  
an example which might be followed, and  
might consequently put an end to the irrita­

this view -of the matter in those frank and  
friendly conversations which sometimes best  
admit topics of a delicate nature, and in  
which pride nnd prejudice can he best man­  
aged without descending from the necessarv

as far as respect to the national honor will  
allow, to avoid a stile of pvoccedure which  
might co-operate with the policy of the Bri­

of the French.

Julj 22, 1808  
  
&quot; Your dispatches by licut. L.cwis were  
delivered on the Hdi inst.  
“ 1 is regretted that the interval between  
his arnval and the dale of your letter in  
Mr Champagoy, during which, I presume,  
some vetbal inter cotninontcadon must  
have tak n place, had pioductd no ttid ca.  
&#x27;.ion of a favorable change in the views of  
I * hr French government with respect to  
its decrees; and still more, that instead of  
an early and fjvnr -tdc answer to your le -  
ter, it should have been billow. &lt;i by such  
a decree as is reported to have been issued  
on the 22d April, at Bayonne. The de­  
cree has not yet it-ached the U. S. and  
therefore, its p case import cannot be as­  
certained. But if it should be, as it is re  
presented, a awe ping stroke a all Aim*,  
rir.an vessel-, on the high seas, it will n t  
only ex end our demands of reparation,  
nut is rendered the more ominous wnh  
espe6\ to the temper and views of the  
emperor towards the U. S. by the date ol  
he measure.  
The arrival of Mr. Biker with my  
letter of May 2d, ol which a copy is here­  
with sent, will have enabled you »o re  
some the subject of the (h-crees with the  
fairest opportunity that could be given to  
the French government for a change ol  
he unjust and unwise course which ba*  
been pursued &gt; and I assure myself lha  
you will not have failed to turn the com  
nunicatinns with which you are furnish  
.•(I to the lies’, account. If France d e  
mt wish to throw the U» S. into the w.&lt;

violate the rights of the sen, and furnish  
to her adversary the pretext for his reta.

imperial cabinet had never paid sufficient  
attention to the smallness of the sacrifice  
which a repeal of that portion of its system  
would involve, if an act of justice is tu be  
called a sacrifice.  
“ The information by the return of thc  
Osage from England is not more satisfac  
torv than that from Franca. Nothing was  
said on the subject of the Chesapeake nor  
any thing done or promised, as to the  
orders in c&lt;m: cil. It is prob .ble tha&#x27; fur*  
tlier accounts from the U S were waited  
for, a «1 that the arr val of the St. Mi­  
chael will have led to a man; fe Mat ion of  
the re tl view-, of that government on those  
and o*her suhj-cls. In (!»••: mean ,ime i&gt;  
I cannot b- doubted, tha&#x27; hopes were che

Country favorable to the policy of the ordcrsr

and proceedings of France would bring oti a  
hostile resistance frbm the UnitetHsiates ; in  
which case the British government would be  
able to mould, every thing to its satisfaction.  
&#x27;There is&#x27; much reason to belieya that if the  
Briti sh government should not concnr in a  
mutual abolitfon of the orders and of the em  
bargo, it will result from an uiiwTilinghess to  
set an example whlcll might be followed, and  
might consequently put an end to the irritating  
career of her enemy, on which the calcula  
  
tion is built. Might not use be made of this

Very view it is evidently proper, as far as re­  
spect to the natjoji&#x27;al honor will allow, to avoid  
  
a stile of procedure which mighr co-operate-J  
  
with the policy of the rttisnj government,
