Purchase, if possible, as much Land of them immediately back of us, as would make one or two States, according to the extent Congress design, or would wish to have them of; and which may be fully adequate to all our present purposes. Fix such a price upon the Lands, so purchased, as would not be too exorbitant &amp; burthensome for real occupiers, but high enough to discourage monopolizers. Declare all steps, heretofore taken to procure Lands on the No. Wt side of the Ohio, contrary to the prohibition of Congress, to be null &amp; void. and that any person thereafter, who shall presume to mark—Survey—or settle Lands beyond the limits of the New States, &amp; purchased Lands, shall not only be considered as outlaws, but fit subjects for Indian vengeance

.  
There is a matter which tho’ it does not come before Congress wholly, is in my opinion, of great political importance, and ought to be attended to in time. It is to prevent the trade of the Western territory from settling in the hands, either of the Spaniards or British. if either of these happen, there is a line of seperation at once drawn between the Eastern &amp; Western Country. The consequences of which may be fatal. To tell any man of information, how fast the latter is settling—how much more rapidly it will settle, by means of foreign emigrants, who can have no particular predeliction for us; of the vast fertility of the Soil—and the population the Country is competent to, would be futile—and equally nugatory to observe that it is by the cement of inte⟨rest⟩ only, we can be held together. If then the trade of that Country should flow through the Mississipi or St Lawrence—If the Inhabitants thereof should form commercial connexions, which lead, we know, to intercourse of other kinds—they would in a few years be as unconnected with us, indeed more so, than we are with South America; and wd soon be alienated from us.  
  
It may be asked how we are to prevent this? Happily for us the way is plain—and our immediate Interests, as well as remote political advantages, points to it; whilst a combination of circumstances renders the present Epocha more favorable than any other, to accomplish them—Extend the inland navigation of the Eastern waters—communicate them as near as possible (by excellent Roads) with those which run to the Westward. open these to the Ohio—and such others as extend from the Ohio towards Lake Erie; and we shall not only draw the produce of the Western Settlers, but the Fur &amp; peltry trade of the lakes also, to our Ports (being the nearest, &amp; easiest of transportation) to the amazing encrease of our Exports, while we bind those people to us by a chain which never can be broken.  
This is no Utopean Scheme—it can be demonstrated as fully as facts can ascertain any thing—that not only the produce of the Ohio &amp; its waters, at least to the falls, but those of the lakes also, as far even as that of the Wood, may be brought to the Sea Ports of the United States by routs shorter, easier, and less expensive

“There is a matter,’’ wrote Washington, “ which, though it  
does not come before Congress, is, in my opinion, of great poli-  
tical importance, and ought to be attended to in time. It is, to  
prevent the trade of the western territory from settling either  
in the hands of the Spaniards or the British. If either of these  
happen, there is a line of separation drawn between the eastern  
and western country at once, the consequences of which may  
be fatal. To tell any man of information how fast the latter is  
setting, how much more rapidly it will settle by means of  
foreign emigrants who can have no particular predilection for  
us, of the vast fertility of the soil, of the population to which  
the country is competent, would be unnecessary ; and equally  
unnecessary would it be to observe that it is by the cement of  
interest alone we can be held together. If, then, the trade of  
that country should flow through the Mississippi or the St.  
Lawrence, if the inhabitants thereof should form commercial  
connections, which we know lead to intercourses of other kinds,  
they would, in a few years, be as unconnected with us as are  
those of South America.’’*  
  
The remedy for this evil, in the judgment of Washington,  
was inland canalisation between the eastern and western waters,  
extending it to the Ohio, and from the Ohio to lake Erie. By  
this plan he considered that the eastern States would draw to  
themselves the produce of the western settlers, and the peltry  
and fur trade of the lakes, thus binding all parts of the conti-  
nent in a chain that could not be broken. :  
  
The foresight of Washington was appreciated by Jefferson,  
and when France offered to sell Louisiana to the United State
