sed “to adjust and regulate the pay and accounts of the Virginia line on Continental establishment, and also of the Officers, soldiers, sailors and marines in the service of this State and for other purposes.” The fifth Clause is to this effect: “Whereas a considerable part of the tract of Country allotted for the officers and soldiers by an Act of Assembly, intituled “An Act for establishing a land office and ascertaining the terms and manner of granting Waste and unappropriated lands,” hath upon the extension of the boundary line of this State and North Carolina, fallen into that State, and the intentions of the said Act are so far frustrated; Be it therefore enacted, that all that tract of land, included within the rivers Mississippi, Ohio and Tenissee and the carolina boundary line, be and the same is hereby Substituted in lieu of such lands so fallen into the said State of North-Carolina to be in the same manner Subject to be claimed by the said officers and soldiers. (See page 146 of the New revisal.)  
The fourth Act of October Session 1783, is intituled An Act for surveying the lands given by law to the officers and soldiers on continental and state establishments, and for other purposes. It Authorizes certain deputations of Officers, to appoint superintendants of surveys, and two principal Surveyors. The fourth section then provides, that the surveyors under the direction of the superintendants, and the Claimants having a right to survey from the priority of their numbers, shall proceed in the first place to survey all the good lands, to be adjudged of by the Superintendants, in that tract of Country lying on the Cumberland and Tenissee rivers, as set apart by law for the officers and soldiers, and then proceed in the like Manner to survey on the north west side of the river ohio, between the rivers Scioto and the Little Miami, until the deficiency of all military bounties in lands shall be fully and amply made up. (See page 210 of the new revisal.)  
In the eighteenth Chapter of the same October Session 1783, the Act follows, which Authorizes “the delegates of this State in Congress, to convey to the United States in Congress Assembled, all the rights of this Commonwealth to the territory northwestward of the river Ohio.” It comprizes many conditions; but perhaps the Only one pertinent to the present Case is the following: “That in case the quantity of good lands on the south east side of the Ohio, upon the Waters of Cumberland river, and between the Green river, and Tenissee river, which have been reserved by law for the Virginia troops on Continental establishment should, from the North-Carolina line bearing in further upon the Cumberland lands, than was expected, prove insufficient for their legal bounties the deficiency should be made up to the said troops in good lands to be laid off between the rivers Scioto and Little Miami on the Northwest side of the river Ohio, in such proportions as have been engaged to them by the laws of Virginia. (See page 214. of the new revisal.)  
In the new revisal are other laws, in Some manner affecting the lands reserved for the military; but as they do not directly relate to our pre
