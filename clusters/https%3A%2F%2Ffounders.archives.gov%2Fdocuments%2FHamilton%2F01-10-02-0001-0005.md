of the Treasury in obedience to the order of the House of Representatives of the fifteenth day of January 1790 has applied his attention, at as early a period as his other duties would permit, to the subject of manufactures; and particularly to the means of promoting such as will tend to render the United States, independent on foreign nations for military and other essential supplies.  
The expediency of encouraging manufactures in the United States, which was, not long since, deemed very questionable, appears, at this time, to be pretty generally admitted. The embarrassments, which have obstructed the progress of our foreign trade, have led to serious reflections on the necessity of enlarging the sphere of our domestic commerce; and the success which has attended manufacturing enterprise in some valuable

extraordinary patronage of government is, in fact, to endeavour, by force and art, to transfer an artificial power, or impulse, to change the natural current of Industry from a more to a less beneficial channel.

Indeed, it can scarcely ever be wise in government to attempt to give a direction to the Industry of its citizens. This, if left to itself, will under the sharpquick-sighted guidance of private interest naturally find its way to wherever there is the most profitable employment; and by such employment onlyalone will the public prosperity be most effectually promoted. To leave it to itself is, consequently, is in almost every situationcase the safest and the soundest policy.

It is not uncommon to meet with an opinion that though the promoting of manufactures may be the interest of a part of the United States, it is contrary to that of another part. The Northern and Southern regions are sometimes represented as having a distinctan opposite interest in thatthis respect. Those are called manufacturing states, these Agricultural—and a species of opposition and contradiction is imagined to subsist between the manufacturing and Agricultural interest.  
It is not to be denied that particular encouragements of particular manufactures may be of a nature to sacrifice the interestcertain interests of the Landholder to those of the Manufacturer—And hence it can of which examples there are not wanting examples in manufacturing countries. And hence it cannot be admitted as us universally true ⟨that⟩ the interests of Agriculture and manufactures ⟨are⟩ the same, a position which has been in many ⟨in⟩stances abused. But there is no maxim bet ⟨bet⟩ter established by experience or more generally ⟨ac⟩knowleged where there has been sufficient experience, than that the aggregate prosperity of manufactures and the aggregate prosperity of Agriculture are intimately connected. And it is relied upon that the truth of this maxim has been demonstrated by a variety of important considerations in the course of the preceding discussion,—of which the superior steadiness of the steady demand of a domestic market for the surplus products of the soil is alone a convincing argument.  
  
The idea of a contrariety of interests between the Northern &amp; Southern regions of the United States ought to be treated without mercyexploded as often as it appears. It is as unfounded as it is mischievous.  
The diversity of circumstances on which it is foundedpredicated authorises a directly contrary conclusion. Mutual wants constitute one of the strongest links of political connection and these are the reas the extent of these is in bears a proportion to the diversity in the objects of supply.  
If there are have been appearances of a struggle between contending interests in any cases they it may be confidently affirmed that they have proceeded from erroneous opinions on one part or on the other.

t the encouragement of manufactures is the interest of all parts of the Union. If the Northern and middle states should be the principal scenes of such establishments, they would immediately benefit the more Southern by creating a demand for productions; some of which they have in common with the other states and others of which are either peculiar to them or of better quality more abundant or of better quality than elsewhere. These productions principally are, Timber, flax, hemp, cotton, wool, raw silk, indigo, iron, lead, furs, hides, skins and coal.

There are improvements of this nature which could certainly be prosecuted with more efficacy by the whole than by any part or parts of the Union. Indeed There are cases in which the general interest will be in danger too likely to be sacrificed to the collision of some supposed adverse local interests. Jealousies in matters of this kind are as apt to exist as they are apt to be erroneous.  
The following remarks are sufficiently judicious and applicablepertinent to deserve a literal quotation “Good roads canals and navigable rivers (says a judicious writer) by diminishing the expence of carriage, put the remote parts of a country more nearly upon a level with those in the neighbourhood of the town. They are upon that account the greatest of all improvements. They encourage the cultivation of the remote which must always be the most extensive circle of the country. They are advantageous to the Town by breaking down the monopoly of the country in its neighbourhood. They are advantageous even to that part of the country. Though they introduce some rival commodities into the old market, they open many new markets to its produce. Monopoly besides is a great enemy to good management, which can never be universally

It is not more than fifty years ago that some of the Counties in the neighbourhood of London petitioned the Parliament against the extension of the turnpike roads into the remoter counties. Those remoter counties, they pretended, from the cheapness of labor would be able to sell their grass and corn cheaper in the London Market than themselves, and would thereby reduce their rents and ruin their cultivation. Their rents however have s risen and their cultivation has been improved, since that time.”  
Specimens of a similar spirit similar to that which governed the counties here spoken of present themselves too frequently to the eye of an impartial observer, and m render it a wish of patriotism that the body in this country in whose councils a local or so partial a spirit

A considerable part of the Malt liquors imported is not superior in quality th to thatsthose which isare made at home; and if the same can though the same cannot with truth be said of the whole, yet there is no natural impediment to the attainment of equal perfection throughout.

ter judgment of the means proper to be  
reſorted to by the United States, it will be of uſe to advert  
to thoſe which have been employed with ſucceſs in other  
countries. The principal of theſe are—  
  
I. Protecting duties—or duties on thoſe foreign articles  
which are the rivals of the domeſtic ones intended to be encou-  
raged.  
  
Duties of this nature evidently amount to a virtual  
bounty on the domeſtic fabrics, fince by enhancing the  
charges on foreign articles, they enable the national manu-  
facturers to underſell all their foreign competitors. The  
propriety of this ſpecies of encouragement need not be dwelt  
upon; as it is not only a clear reſult from the numerous  
topics which have been ſuggeſted, but is ſanctioned by the  
laws of the united States, in a variety of inſtances ; it has  
the additional: recommendation of being a reſource of re-  
venue Indeed all the duties impoſed on imported articles,  
though with an excluſive view to revenue, have the effect  
in  
  
os  
  
in contemplation, and except where they fall on raw mate-  
  
rials wear a beneficient aſpect towards the manufactures of  
the country.  
  
II. Probibitions of rival articles, or duties equivalent ts  
prohibitions.  
  
This is another and an efficacious mean of encouraging  
national manufactures, but in general it is only fit to be em-  
ployed when a manufacture has made ſuch a progreſs, and  
is in ſo many hands as to enſure a due competition, and an  
adequate ſupply on reaſonable terms — Of duties equivalent  
to prohibitions, there are examples in the laws of the

Referring to the early part of the last century, an eminent writer has  
observed as follows: ‘‘ Some of the counties in the neighbourhood  
of London petitioned the parliament against the extension of turnpike-  
roads into the remoter counties. Those remoter counties, they pre-  
tended, would be able to sell their grass and corn cheaper in the  
London market than themselves, and would thereby reduce their  
rents and ruin their cultivation.” (See Rees’s Cyclopedia), It i

The author of the Wealth of Nations  
has remarked,&#x27;that &lt;* * bounties, it is  
allowed, ought to be given to those  
branches of trade Only which cannot  
be carried on tvithout them. But  
every branch of trade on which the  
merchant can sell his goods for a price  
which replaces to him, with the ordi¬  
nary profits of stock, the whole capi¬  
tal employed in preparing and sending  
them to market, can be carried on  
without a bounty. Every such branch  
is evidently upon a level with all the  
other branches of trade which are car¬  
ried on without bounties, and cannot,  
therefore, require one more than they.  
Those trades only require bounties in  
which the merchant is obliged to sell  
his goods for a price which does not  
replace to him his capital, together  
with the ordinary profit; or in which  
he is obliged to sell them for less tha

** Pecuniary Bounties.—This has been found one of the most effi-  
cacious means of encouraging manufactures, and it is in some views  
the best. Its advantages are these—  
  
* 1. It is a species of encouragement more positive and direct than  
any other, and for that very reason, has a more immediate tendency to  
stimulate and uphold new enterprizes.  
  
“2. It avoids the inconvenience of a temporary augmentation of

hension of danger from all changes, is to be expected from the na­  
ture of men: thds we are told byshe same author, in 1776, thet  
fifty years before that time, some of the counties in the neigh­

sion of the turnpike roads into the remoter counties. -&quot;The  
remoter counties, they pretended, from the cheapness of labdr,  
would be able to sell their grass and corn cheaper in the London  
markets than themselves, and would thereby reduce their rent ,  
and ruin their cultivation. Their rents, however have risen,  
and the cultivation has been improved since that time.

the competition of which with a similar domestic article it was  
desirable to restrain. The manufacture itself partook of the nature  
of a raw material, and by a further process could be converted into  
a manufacture of a different kind, the introduction or growth of  
which it was desirable to encourage. Cottons and linens in their  
white state fell under this description. A duty on those imported  
was proper to promote the domestic manufacture of similar articles

It is a very remarkable fact that some  
of the landlords of the counties in the vi­  
cinity of London petitioned Parliament  
against the extension of turnpike roads j  
into the remoter parts of the country ;  
those remote counties, it was pretended,
