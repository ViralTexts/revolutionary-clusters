 Here too were facts on the other side. In two of the States, Connect. and Rh. Island, the delegates to Congs. were chosen, not by the Legislatures, but by the people at large; and the plan of Mr. P. intended no change in this particular.  
It had been alledged (by Mr. Patterson), that the Confederation having been formed by unanimous consent, could be dissolved by unanimous Consent only. Does this doctrine result from the nature of compacts? Does it arise from any particular stipulation in the articles of Confederation? If we consider the federal union as analogous to the fundamental compact by which individuals compose one Society, and which must in its theoretic origin at least, have been the unanimous act of the component members, it cannot be said that no dissolution of the compact can be effected without unanimous consent. A breach of the fundamental principles of the compact by a part of the Society would certainly absolve the other part from their obligations to it. If the breach of any article by any of the parties, does not set the others at liberty, it is because, the contrary is implied in the compact itself, and particularly by that law of it, which gives an indefinite authority to the majority to bind the whole in all cases. This latter circumstance shews that we are not to consider the federal Union as analogous to the social compact of individuals: for if it were so, a Majority would have a right to bind the rest, and even to form a new Constitution for the whole, which the Gentn: from N. Jersey would be among the last to admit. If we consider the federal Union as analogous not to the social compacts among individual men: but to the conventions among individual States, What is the doctrine resulting from these conventions? Clearly, according to the Expositors of the law of Nations, that a breach of any one article, by any one party, leaves all the other parties at liberty, to consider the whole convention as dissolved, unless they choose rather to compel the delinquent party to repair the breach. In some treaties indeed it is expressly stipulated that a violation of particular articles shall not have this consequence, and even that particular articles shall remain in force during war, which in general is understood to dissolve all subsisting Treaties. But are there any exceptions of this sort to the Articles of confederation? So far from it that there is not even an express stipulation that force shall be used to compell an offending member of the Union to discharge its duty. He observed that the violations of the federal articles had been numerous &amp; notorious. Among the most notorious was an act of N. Jersey herself; by which she expressly refused to comply with a constitutional requisition of Congs.—and yielded no farther to the expostulations of their deputies, than barely to rescind her vote of refusal without passing any positive act of compliance. He did not wish to draw any rigid inferences from these observations. He thought it proper however that the true nature of the existing confederacy should be investigated, and he was not anxious to strengthen the foundations on which it now stands.  
Proceeding to the consideration of Mr. Patterson’s plan, he stated the object of a proper plan to be twofold. 1.

States—in the constitution and intent of their federal authorities—in the tendency of the particular members to usurp on these authorities; and to bring confusion &amp; ruin on the whole. He observed that the plan of Mr. Pat——son besides omitting a controul over the States as a general defence of the federal prerogatives was particularly defective in two of its provisions. 1. Its ratification was not to be by the people at large, but by the legislatures. It could not therefore render the Acts of Congs. in pursuance of their powers, even legally paramount to the Acts of the States. 2. It gave to the federal Tribunal an appellate jurisdiction only—even in the criminal cases enumerated. The necessity of any such provision supposed a danger of undue acquittals in the State tribunals.

If the minority happen to include all such as possess the skill &amp; habits of military life, with such as possess the great pecuniary resources, one third may conquer the remaining two thirds. 2. One third of those who participate in the choice of rulers may be rendered a majority by the accession of those whose poverty disqualifies them from a suffrage, &amp; who for obvious reasons may be more ready to join the standard of sedition than that of the established Government. 3. Where slavery exists, the Republican Theory becomes still more fallacious.

The larger States will be impregnable, the smaller only can feel the vengeance of it. He illustrated the position by the history of the Amphyctionic Confederates: and the ban of the German Empire.

The contemplation of such an event was painful; but it would be prudent to submit to the task of examining it at a distance, that the means of escaping it might be the more readily embraced. Let the Union of the States be dissolved, and one of two consequences must happen. Either the States must remain individually independent &amp; sovereign; or two or more Confederacies must be formed among them. In the first event would the small States be more secure agst. the ambition &amp; power of their larger neighbours, than they would be under a general Government pervading with equal energy every part of the Empire, and having an equal interest in protecting every part agst. every other part?

cases. This Litter .circumstance1 &#x27;: shows, that we  
are not to consider the Federal :Unidn as anala­  
gous to the social compact of individuals, for if  
it were so, a iu ijority would have a right to bind  
the rest, and even to form a newConstitation for  
ihe whole; which the gentleman from New Jersey  
vMr. Patterson) would be among th(jr last to ad­  
mit. If we consider the Federal Union a anala­  
giius. not to the social com pacts among individual  
men. but to the Convections among individu;tl  
States; what s the doctrine resulting from these  
Conventions 1 Clearly, according to the exposit­  
ors of the law -of nations, that a breach of any  
me article by any one iarty, leaves all the other  
parties atj liberty to consi ler the whole Conven­  
tion as dissolved, unless they choose rather to  
compel the delinquent party to repair the breach.  
In some treaties, indeed it is expressly stipulated,  
that a violation of particular articles shall not  
have this consequence, acd even that particular  
articles shall remain in force during war which is &#x27;  
in general understood to dissolve all subsisting ;  
treaties. But are there any exceptions of this  
sort to the Articles of Confederation ? So far ;  
from it. that there is not even an express stipula- j  
tion that force shall be used to compel an offend-  
ing mejnjber of the Unin to discharge its duty  
He observed that the vi la i ns ofthe Fe !cr 1  
Articles had been numerous and Eotorious. A- ;  
mong the most notorious was an act of New Jer- j  
sey herself; by which she expn sky refused to com- I

He thought  
proper, however, that the true nature of the exis-  
was not anxious to strengthen the foundations oa  
which it now stands.

all, of the Southern States to withdraw from  
the present Confederacy of States, and that the  
great authority of Madison is invoked to sustain  
it, 1 deem it respectful and proper to submit  
some of tlie reasons, which sustain my  
opinion.  
And, first, I refer to the history of the Constitution.  
In the convention, which framed tiie  
Constitution, Mr. Patterson, of New Jersey,  
expressed the opinion that a compact formed  
by unanimous consent could be dissolved, only  
by unanimous consent. Mr. Madison denied  
the doctrine?saying that it does not result  
from the nature of compact, and that &quot;a breach  
of the fundamental principles of the compact,  
by apart of the society would certainly absolve  
the other part from their obligations to it. II  
the breach of any article by any of the parties  
does not set the others at liberty, it is because  
the contrary is implied, in the compact itself,  
and particularly by that law of it which gives  
an implied authority to bind the whole in all  
cases. This latter circumstances shows that we  
are not to consider the Federal Union as analogous  
to the social compacts of individuals; foi  
if it were so, a majority would have a right ti  
bind the rest,and even form a new Constitution,  
which the gentleman from New Jersey wouh!  
be among the last to admit.&quot; If we consider  
lh? Federal Union as analogous,not to the social  
compacts among individual men, but to the con  
volitions among Stales, what is the doctrin&lt;?re

to the exposition of the law of nations, that n

and even that particular articles shall remain it

expose the lesser to being swallowed up by the  
larger. Ib. Vol. 2nd, page 915.  
Mr. Madisou said, &quot;It had been alleged (by Mr.  
Patterson,) that the confederation, haviug been  
formed by unanimous consent, could^&gt;e dissolved  
by unanimous consent only. Hoes this doctrine  
result from the nature of compacts? Does it arise  
from any particular stipulation in the Articles of  
Confederation? If we consider the Federal Union  
as analogous to the fundamental compact by which  
individuals compose one society, and which must,  
iu its theoretic origin at least, have been the unani­  
mous act of the component members, it cannot  
be said that no dissolution of the compact can be  
effected without unanimous consent. A breach of  
tho fundamental principles of tho compact by a  
part of the society, would certainly absolve the  
other p.irt from their obligations to it. If the  
breach of any article by any of the parties, does  
not set the others at liberty, it is because the-con­  
trary is implied in the compact, itself, and . partic­  
ularly by that law of it which gives an indeliuito  
authority to the majoiity to bind the whole in all  
cases. This latter circumstance shows, tbf?l wo  
are not to consider the Federal Union asanalagous  
to the social compact of individuals: for if it were  
so, a majority would have a right to bind the rest,  
and even to form a constitution for the whole:  
which tho gentleman from New Jersey, would bo  
among the last to admit. If we consider the Fed­  
era! Uuion as analagous, not to the social com­  
ract among individual men, but to tho conven­  
tions among individual States, whatis-the doctrine  
resulting from these conventions? Clearly, ac­  
cording l&quot; tho expositors of the law of nations,  
that, a breach of any one article by one party,  
leaves all theother parties at liberty to consider the

of New.Jersey herself; by which she expressly  
refused to comply with a constitutional requisition

her vote of refusal without passing any positive  
act of compliance. Ib. Vol. 2nd, page Kin?5.

cation is in this to be by the people themselves, in that by the

Madison, speaking of the New Jersey plan, observed:  
That besides omitting a control over the States, as a gene.  
ral defence of the federal prerogatives, it was particularly  
defective in two of its provisions. In the first place, its ratiff  
cation was not to be by the people at large, but by the Legls.­  
latures. It cou&#x27;d not therefore render the acts of Congress in  
pursuance of their powers even legally paramount to the acts  
of the States. And in the second place it gave to the federal  
tribunal and appellate jurisdiction only, even in the criminal  
cases enumerated. The necessity of any such provision sup­  
posed a danger of undue acquital in the State tribunals,of  
what avail would an appellate tribunal be after an acquital

Loes that doctrine result from the nature of

tipulation in the Articles of Confederation?  
if we consider the Federal Union as analogous  
to the fundamental compact by which individ­  
aals compose one society, and which must, in  
its theoretic origin at least, have been the

cannot be said that no dissolution of the com­

certainly absolve the other part from their ob­

 to the expositors of the law of nations, that a

&quot;It has been alleged, (by Mr. Patterson,) that the  
confederation having been formed by unanimous  
consent, could be dissolved by unanimous consent only.  
Does this doctrine result from the nature of con-  
oo ee ooe  
Federal Union as analogous to the rundamental com-  
e  ta  e eee  
pact by which individuals compose one society, and  
which must, in its theoretic origin at least, have  
been the unanimous act of the component members,  
it cannot be said that no dissolution of the compact can  
be effected without unanimous consent. A breach of  
the fundamental principles of the compact, by a part  
of the society, would certainly absolve the other  
part from their obligations to it. If the breach  
of ny article, by ny of the parties, does not see  
the others at liberty, it is because the contrary  
e aaai  seas a aea J we aa  
is implied in the compact itself, and particularly  
by that law of which it gives an indefinite author  
ity to the majority to bind the whole, in all cases.  
The latter circumstance shows that we are not to  
consider the Federal Union as analogous to the  
social compact of individuals; for, if it were so, a  
majority would have a right to bind the rest, and even  
to form a new Constitution for the whole, which the  
gentleman from New Jersey would be the last to  
admit. If we consider the Federal Union as analo  
gous, not to the social compacts among individual  
men, but to the conventions among individual States,  
what is the doctrine resulting from these conven­  
tions? Clearly, accordig to the expositors of the  
law of nations, that a breach of any one article,  
by any one party, leaves all the other parties at  
liberty to consider the whole convention as dissolv­  
ed, unless they chose rather to compel the delin­  
quent party to repair the breach. In some treaties,  
indeed, it is expressly stipulated, that a violation of  
particular articles shall not have this consequence,  
and even that particular articles shall remain in force  
during war, which is in general understood to dis-  
solve all sudsisting sreaties, but are shere any exbep  
tions of this sort to the Articles of Confederation?  
So far from it, that there is not even an express stipula­  
tion that force shall be used to compel an offending mem­  
ber of the Union to discharge ite duty. He observed  
that the violations of the Federal Articles had been  
numerous and notorieus. Among the most notori-.  
ous, was an act of New Jersey, herself, by which  
she expressly refused to comply with a constitutional  
requisition of Congress, and yielded no further to  
the expostulations of their deputies, than barely to  
rescind her vote of refusal, without passing any  
positive act of compliance. He did not wish to draw  
any rigid inferences from these observations. He  
thought it proper, hewever, that the true nature of the  
eristing Confederacy should be investigated, and he  
was not anxious to strengthen the foundations on  
which it now stands.&quot;  
Another objection was, the probability of the an­  
nihilation of State Governments, which was met,
