[after July 10, 1782]  
I.  
It is for the Interest of Humanity in general, that the Occasions of War, and the Inducements to it, should be diminished.  
If Rapine is abolished, one of the Encouragements to War is taken away, and Peace therefore more likely to continue and be lasting.  
The Practice of Robbing Merchants on the high Seas, a Remnant of the Ancient Piracy, tho’ it may be accidentally beneficial to particular Persons, is far from being profitable to all engaged in it, or to the Nation that authorizes it. In the Beginning of a War some rich Ships, not upon their Guard, are surprized and taken. This encourages the first Adventurers to fit out more arm’d Vessels, and many others to do the same. But the Enemy, at the same time, become more careful, arm their Merchant Ships better, and render them not so easy to be taken; they go also more under the Protection of Convoys, thus while the Privateers to take them are multiplied, the Vessels subject to be taken, and the Chances of Profit are diminished; so that many Cruises are made wherein the Expences overgo the Gains; and as is the Case in other Lotteries, tho’ particulars have got Prizes, the mass of Adventurers are Losers, the whole Expence of fitting out all the Privateers during a War, being much greater than the whole Amount of Goods taken. Then there is the National Loss of all the Labour of so many Men during the time they have been employed in Robbing; who, besides, spend what they get in Riot, Drunkenness and Debauchery, lose their Habits of Industry, are rarely fit for any Sober Business after a Peace, and serve only to encrease the Number of Highwaymen &amp; House Breakers. Even the Undertakers, who have been fortunate, are, by sudden Wealth, led into expensive living, the Habit of which continues when the means of supporting it cease, and finally ruins them. A Just Punishment of their having wantonly &amp; unfeelingly ruined many honest innocent Traders and their Families, whose Substance was employed in serving the common Interest of Mankind.  
  
II.  
Should it be agreed, &amp; become a Part of the Law of Nations, that the Cultivators of the Earth are not to be molested or interrupted in their Peaceable and useful Employment, the Inhabitants of the Sugar Islands would perhaps come under the Protection of such a Regulation, which would be a great Advantage to the Nations who at present hold those Islands, since the Cost of Sugar to the Consumer in those Nations, consists not only in the Price he pays for it by the Pound, but in the accumulated Charge of all the Taxes he pays in every War to fit out Fleets and maintain Troops for the Defence of the Islands that raise the Sugar and the Ships that bring it home. But the Expence of Treasure is not all. A celebrated Philosophical Writer remarks, that when he consider’d the Wars made in Africa for Prisoners to raise Sugar in America, the Numbers slain in those Wars, the Number that being crowded in Ships perish in the Transportation, &amp; the Numbers that die under the Severities of Slavery, he could scarce look on a Morsel of Sugar without conceiving it spotted with Human Blood. If he had consider’d also the Blood of one another which the white Nations shed in fighting for those Islands, he would have imagined his Sugar not as spotted only, but as thoroughly died red.— On these Accounts I am persuaded that the Subjects of the Emperor of Germany and the Empress of Russia, who have no Sugar Islands, consume Sugar cheaper at Vienna and Moscow, with all the Charge of transporting it after its Arrival in Europe, than the Citizens of London or of Paris. And I sincerely believe that if France &amp; England were to decide by throwing Dice which should have the whole of their Sugar Islands, the Loser in the Throw would be the Gainer. The future Expence of defending them would be saved; the Sugars would be bought cheaper by all Europe if the Inhabitants might make it without Interruption, and whoever imported the Sugar, the same Revenue might be raised by Duties at the Custom Houses of the Nation that consumed it. And on the whole I conceive it would be better for the Nations now possessing Sugar Colonies to give up their Claim to them, let them govern themselves, and put them under the Protection of all the Powers of Europe as neutral Countries open to the Commerce of all, the Profits of the present Monopoly’s being by no means equivalent to the Expence of maintaining them.

nations, which have sugar-islands subject to their dominion,  
would be more benefited by the loss than they are by the pos-  
session; for, as he observes, ‘the cost of sugar to the con-  
sumer in those nations consists not merely in the price he pays  
for it by the pound, .but in the accumulated charge of all the  
taxes he pays in every war to fit out fleets and maintain troops  
for the defence of the islands that raise the sugar, and the  
ships that bring it home.’ (P. 421.) He expresses his conviction  
that sugar actually costs the consumer less at Vienna or Moscow,  
where the sovereigns have no sugar-islands, than it costs the  
citizens of London or Paris, though they are exempted from  
the charges of transport after the arrival of the commodity in  
their ports : )  
  
¢ And I sincerely believe,’ says he, ‘ that if France and England  
were to decide by throwing dice which should have the whole of  
their susan adesibe; the loser in the throw would be the gainer.  
The future expence of defending them would be saved; the sugars  
would be bought cheaper by all Europe if the inhabitants might  
make it without interruption, and whoever imported the sugar, the  
same revenue might be‘raised by duties at the custom-houses of  
the nation that consumed it. And on the whole I conceive it  
would be better for the nations now possessing sugar-colonies to  
give up their claim to them, let them govern themselves, and put  
them under the protection of all the powers of Europe as neutral  
countries, open to the commerce of all, the profits of the present  
monopolies being by no means equivalent to the expence of main-  
taining them.’

“ Should it be agreed, and become a part of  
the law of nations, that the cultivators of the  
earth are not to be molested or interrupted in  
their peaceable and useful employments, the in-  
habitants of the sugar islands would perhaps  
come under the protection of such a regulation ;  
which would be a great advantage to the nations  
who at present hold those islands, since the cost  
of sugar to the consumer in those nations con-  
sists not merely in the price he pays for it by  
the pound, but in the accumulated charge of all  
the taxes he pays, in every war, to fit out fleets  
and maintain troops for the defence of the

not all. A celebrated philosophical writer re-  
marks, that, when he considered the wars made  
in Africa for prisoners to raise sugar in Ame-  
rica, the numbers slain in those wars, the num-  
bers that, being crowded in ships, perish in the  
transportation, and the numbers that die under

the blood of one another which the white na-
