The Attorney Genl. having considered and decided that the prescription, in the law for establishing a bank, that the officers in the subordinate offices of discount &amp; deposit shall be appointed ‘on the same terms and in the same manner practised in the principal bank’ does not extend to them the principle of rotation established by the legislature in the body of Directors in the principal bank, it follows that the extension of that principle has been merely a voluntary &amp; prudential act of the principal bank, from which they are free to depart. I think the extension was wise &amp; proper on their part; because the legislature having deemed rotation useful in the principal bank constituted by them, there would be the same reason for it in the subordinate banks to be established by the principal. it breaks in upon the esprit de corps so apt to prevail in permanent bodies, it gives a chance for the public eye penetrating into the sanctuary of those proceedings &amp; practices which the avarice of the directors may introduce for their personal emolument, &amp; which the resentments of excluded directors, or the honesty of those newly admitted might betray to the public; and it gives an opportunity at the end of a year, or at other periods, of correcting a choice which on trial proves to have been unfortunate; an evil of which themselves complain in their distant institutions. whether however they have a power to alter this, or not, the Executive has no right to decide; &amp; their consultation with you has been merely an act of complaisance, or a desire to shield so important an innovation under the cover of Executive sanction. but ought we to volunteer our sanction in such a case? ought we to disarm ourselves of any fair right of animadversion whenever that institution shall be a legitimate subject of consideration? I own I think the most proper answer would be that we do not think ourselves authorised to give an opinion on the question.   
From a passage in the letter of the President, I observe an idea of establishing a branch bank of the US. in New Orleans. this institution is one, of the most deadly hostility existing, against the principles &amp; form of our constitution. the nation is at this time so strong &amp; united in it’s sentiments that it cannot be shaken at this moment. but suppose a series of untoward events should occur sufficient to bring into doubt the competency of a republican government to meet a crisis of great danger, or to unhinge the confidence of the people in the public functionaries, an institution like this, penetrating by it’s branches every part of the Union, acting by command &amp; in phalanx may in a critical moment upset the government.

r Letter of Thomas Jefferson to Mr Gallatin.  
1 he Attorney General hav ing considered  
aiul decided that the prescription in the law  
for establishing a bank, that the officers in  
the subordinate offices cf discount and depo­  
s*te, shall be appointed * on the same terms  
and in the same manner practised in the prin­  
cipal bank,* does not extend to them the  
principle of rotation, established by the legis­  
lature in the body of directors in the princi­  
pal hank, it follows that the extension of that  
principle has been merely a voluntary and  
prudential act of the principal bank, from  
which they are free to depart. 1 think the  
extension was wise and proper on their part,  
because the legislature having deemed rota­  
tion useful in the principal bank constituted  
by them, there would be the same reason for  
it in the subordinate banks to be established i  
ed by the .principal. It breaks in upon the •  
C8/irit. (In cor/tft so apt to prevail in perma- :  
nent bodies ; it gives a chance f r the public j  
eye penetrating into the sanctuary of th .se  
proceedings and practices, which the avarice  
of the directors may introduce far their per­  
sonal emolument, and which the resentments  
of excluded directors, or the honesty of those  
duly admitted, might betray to the public ;  
and it gives an opportunity at the end of the  
year, or at &quot;other periods, cf correcting a  
choice, which, on trial, pr: res to have been  
unfortunate; an evil of which themselves  
complain in their distant institutions. Whe­  
ther, however, they have a power to alter  
this, or hot, the executive has no right to de­  
cide ; and their consultation with yeti has  
been merely an act of complaisance,or from a  
desire to shield so important an innovation un­  
der the cover of executive sanction. But  
ought we to volunteer our sanction in such a  
case ? Ought we to disarm ourselves of any  
fair right of animadversion, whenever that  
institution shall he a legitimate subject of con­  
sideration ? I own, I think the most proper  
answer would be, that wc do not think our­  
selves authorised to give an opinion on the  
question.  
  
i I III .1 lit till- I til v. I ill l. 11 I rial­  
dent 1 observe an idea f f establishing a bruncii  
l)ank of the United States in New Orleans.  
This institution is one of the most deadly hos­  
tility existing, against the principles and form  
of our constitution. The nation is, at this  
time, so strong and united in its sentiments,  
that it cannot be shaken at this moment.—  
But suppose a series of untoward events should  
occur, sufficient to bring into doubt the com­  
petency of a republican government to meet a  
crisis of great danger, or to unhinge the con­  
fidence of the people in the public function t­  
ries ; an institution! ike this, penetrating by  
its branches every part of the Union, acting by  
command and in phalanx, may, in a critical  
moment, upset the government. I deem no  
government safe which is tinder the vassalage  
of any-self-constituted,aulhori!ics, or any  
other authority than that of the nation, or its  
regular functionaries. What an obstruction  
could not this bank of the United States, with  
all its branch banks, be in time of war? It  
might dictate to us the peace we should ac­  
cept, or withdraw its aids. Ought we then  
to give further growth to an institution so  
powerful, so hostile ? That it is so hostile  
we know, 1. from a knowledge (if the prin­  
ciples of the persons composing the body of  
directors in every hank, principal or branch;  
and those of most of the stockholders: 2. from  
their opposition to the measures and princi­  
ples of the government, and to the election of  
those friendly to them: and 3. from the senti­  
ments of the newspapers they support. Now,  
while we are strong, it is tiie greatest duty  
we owe to the safety of our constitution, to  
bring this powerful enemy to a perfect subor­  
dination under its authorities. The first  
measure would he to reduce them to an equal  
footing only with other banks, as to the fa­  
vors of the government. But, in order to  
be able to meet a general combination of the  
banks; against us, in a critical emergency,  
could we not make a beginning towards an  
independent use of our own money, towards  
holding our own bank in all the deposites  
where it is received, and letting the Treas­  
urer give his draft or note, for payment at  
any particular place, which in a well conduct­  
ed government, ought to have as much cre­  
dit as any private draft, or bank note, or bill,  
and would give us the same facilities which  
we derive from the banks ? 1 pray you to  
turn this subject in your mind, and to give it  
the benefit of your knowledge of details ;—  
whereas, I bat e only very general views of  
the subject. Affectionate salutations

** Thie institution,” said Mr. Jefferson,onthe occasion of estab-

true of the present times, that we are the more  
strongly induced to its publication. The latter  
clanse contains a suggestion not unlike that of Pres­  
ident Jackson’s in his second annual message. .  
  
“From a passage in the letter of the President, I  
observe an idea of establishing a branch bank of the:  
U. States in New-Orleans. This institution. is one  
of the most deadly hostility existing, against the  
principles and form of our constitution. The nation  
Is, at this time, so strong and united in its senti­  
‘ments that it cannot be shakea at this moment.  
But suppose a series of untoward events should oc­  
cur, sufficient to bring into doubt the competency of  
‘a republican government to meet a crisis of great  
danger, or to uphinge the confidence of the people  
in the public functivnaries ; an institution like this,  
penetrating by its branches every part of the Union,  
acting by command and in phalanx, may, in a eriti­  
cal moment, upset the government. I deem no  
government safe which is under the vassalage of  
any self-constituted authorities, or any other author­  
ity than that of the nation, or its regular fanctiona­  
ties. What an obstruction could not this bank  
of the United States, with all its branch banks, be in  
time of war? It might dictate to us the peace we  
should accept, or withdraw its aids. = Ought we  
then t give farther growth to an iastitution so_pow­  
erful, so hostile? That it is so hostile we know, 1,  
from a knowledge of the principles of the Y(ersons  
composing the body of directors in every bank, prin­  
cipal or branch ; and those of most of the stock­  
holders : 2. from their opposition to the measures  
and principles of the government, and to the e­  
lection of those friendly to them ; and, 3. from the  
sentiments of the newspa%ers they auJ)port. Now  
while we dre strong, it is the greatest duty we owe .  
to the safety of our constitution, to bring this power-».  
ful enemy to a perfect subordination under its an­  
thorities. The first measure would be to reducse.  
  
them to an equal footing only with other banks, as  
to the favors of the government. But, in order to  
be able to meet a general combination of the banks  
against us, in a critical emergencg. could we not  
make a beginning towards an independent use of  
our own money, towards holding our own bank in  
all the deposites where it is received, and letting the.  
Treasarer give his dralt or note for payment at any  
particular place, which, in a well conducted gov­  
ernment, ought to have as much credit as any pri­  
vate dralt, or bank note, or bill, and would give us  
the same facilities which we derive from the banks ?*&#x27;

That it is so hostile we know, 1. from a knowledge  
of the principles of the persons conrpesing the body

opposition to the measures and principles of the gov~

and, 3. from the sentiments of the newspapers they  
support. Now, while we are stiong, it is the great­

bring this powerful enemy to a perfect subordination  
under its authorities. The first measure would be to:

The Attorney General having consid  
  
ered and decided, that the prescription in  
  
the law tor establishing a bank, that the  
officers in the subordinate offices of dis­  
count and deposit, shait be appointed on  
the same terms and in the same manner  
practiced in the principal bank,&#x27; does not  
extend to them the principle of rotation,  
established by tho legislature in the body  
of directors in the principal bank, it fo!.  
lows that the extension of that principle  
has been merely a voluntary and pruden­  
tial act of the principal bank, feom which  
they are free to depart. I think the ex­  
tension was wise and proper on their part,  
becausethe legislature having deemed ro­  
tation useful in the principal bank constitu­  
ted by them, there would be the same rea­  
son for it in the subordinate banks to be  
established by the principal. It breaks in  
upon the esprit de corps, so apt to&quot; prevail  
in permanent bodies ; it gives a chance  
for the public eye penetrating into the  
sanctuary of their proceedings and prac  
  
tices, which the avarice of the directors  
  
ma v introduce for their personal emolu  
  
ment, and which the resentments of ex.  
eluded -directors, or the honesty of those  
  
dulv admitted, might betray to the public ;  
  
and it cives an opportunity ai me enci oi  
  
the year, or at other periods, of correct­  
ing a choice, which, on trial, proves un.  
fortunate ; an evil of which themselves  
complain in their distant institutions.  
  
Whether, however, tney nave a power to  
alter this or not, the executive has no  
right to decide ; and their consultation  
with you has been merely, an act of com­  
plaisance, or from a desire to shield so im­  
portant an innovation under the cover of  
executive sanction. But ought we to oI­  
unteer our sanction on such a case 1  
Ought we to disarm ourselves of any fair  
right of animadversion, whenever that in­

&quot;From a passage in tne letter oi tne Jtresi-  
dent, I observe an idea of establishing a branch  
Bank of the United States in New Orleans;  
This institution is one of the most deadly  
hostility existing against the principles and  
orm of our Constitution. The nation is, at  
this time, so strong and united in its senti  
ments, that it cannot be shaken at this mo  
ment. But, suppose a series ot untoward e-  
vents should occur, sufficient to Dnng into  
doubt the competency of a Republican Gov­  
ernment to meet a crisis of great danger, or to  
unhinge the confidence of the people m the  
public functionaries ; an institution like this,  
penetrating by its branches eveiy port in the  
union, acting by command and in pnaianx,  
may, at a critical moment, upset tne uovwh­  
ment itself. I deem no Government safe  
which is under the vassalage of any self-con  
stituted authorities, or any other authority  
than that of the nation, or its regular func­  
tionaries. What an obstruction could not  
this Bank of the United States, with all its  
branch banks, be in time of war. It might  
dictate to us the peace we should accept, or  
withdraw its aid. Ought we then to give  
urther aid to an institution so powerful, so  
hostile.&quot;  
In relation to the State Bank deposite sys-  
- . f i  
tem. experience nas condemned if, ana uie  
only question now is whether it is the part of  
wisdom or folly to renew an unsuccessiui ex­  
periment. I presume that it is one of those  
&quot;fatal experiments&quot; alluded to in the third re  
solution. After the removal of the public  
deposites from the Bank of the United States  
in 1833, in consequence oi an alleged prosti­

was listening to the proceedings of a board of Bank  
directors, devising ways and means of perpetuating  
their ill-gotton power and of &quot;vesting&quot; it away  
securely beyond the reach of legisiative enactments  
or the sovereign power of the people.  
In a letter to Albert Gallatin, in 1803, speaking  
of Col. Hamilton&#x27;s &quot;machine,&quot; Mr Jefferson says:  
&quot;This institution, (referring to the bank of the  
U. States,) is one of the most deadly hostility ex­  
isting against the principles and form of our con­  
stitution. The nation is, at this time, so strong  
and united in its sentiments, that it cannot be sha­

toward events should occur, sufficient to bring into  
doubt the competency of a Republican Government  
to meet a crisis of great danger, or to unhinge the  
confidence of the people in the public functionaries;  
an institution like this, penetrating, by its brapches,  
every part of the Union, acting by command and  
in phalanx, may, in a critical moment, upset the  
Government. I deem no Government safe which  
is under the vassalage of any self-constituted an­  
thorities, or any other authority than that of the  
nation, or its regular functionaries. What an obe  
struction could not this bank of the United States,  
with all its branch banks, be in time of war? It  
might dictate to us the peace we should accept, or  
withdraw its aid. Ought we, then, to give further  
growth to an institution so powerful, so hostile?  
That it is so hostile, we know: I. From a knowl­  
edge of the principles of the persons composing the  
body of directors in every bank, principal or branch,  
and those of most of the stockholders: 2. From  
their opposition to the measures and principles of  
the Goverament, and to the election of those friend­  
ly to them: and 3. From the sentiments of the  
newspapers they support. Now, while we are  
strong, it is the greatest duty we owe to the safety  
of our constitution to bring this powerful enemy to  
a perfect subordination under its authorities.&quot;  
was done by the Roman firmness and per­  
sonal power of the illustrious Jackson. The over­  
whelming corruption of the bank in its last strug­

of the prediction of William Pitt. This celebrate

the first measure would be to reduce them to an equal

from a knowledge of the principles of the per­  
sons composing ihe bddy of directors in every

powerful enemy to a perfect subordination

some of the abuses of money which the Alliance proposes  
to remedy through National legislation.  
Much has been written on the subject of National banks and we do not  
propose here to tire the reader with a repetition of what has been said. In  
order to sustain our position, however, we will, at the risk of being charged  
with a tediousness, quote a few authorities as to the power which banks of  
issue have over the business of the country.  
  
In his letter to Mr. Gallatin, December 13, 1803, Thomas Jefferson  
says:

crisis of great danger, an institution like this, penetrating by its branches  
every part of the union, acting by command and in phalanx, may in a  
critical moment, upset the government.  
“I deem no government safe which is under the vassalage of any self­  
constituted authorities, or any other authority than that of the nation or  
its regular functionaries. What an obstruction could these banks be in  
time of war! They might dictate to us the peace we should accept, or with­

Ought we to give further growth to an institution so powerful, so hos­

First. From the knowledge of the principles of the persons who com­  
pose the body of their directors and stockholders.  
Second. From their opposition to the measures and principles of the  
government and those friendly to them.  
Third. From the sentiment of the newspapers they support.  
Should we not make a beginning toward an independent use of our own  
money, towards holding our own bank, and lettiDg the treasurer give his  
draft or note payment at any particular place, which in a well conducted  
government ought to have as much credit as any private draft or bank note
