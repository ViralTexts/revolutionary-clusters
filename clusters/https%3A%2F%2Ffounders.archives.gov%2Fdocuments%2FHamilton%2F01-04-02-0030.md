Flattering myself it will appear to the committee that the constitution at least offers us no impediment—I shall proceed to other topics of objection. The next that presents itself is a supposed danger to liberty from granting legislative power to Congress.  
But before I enter upon this subject, to remove the aspersions thrown upon that body, I shall give a short history of some material facts relating to the origin and progress of the business. To excite the jealousies of the people, it has been industriously represented as an undue attempt to acquire an increase of power. It has been forgotten or intentionally overlooked, that considering it in the strongest light as a proposal to alter the confederation, it is only exercising a power which the confederation has in direct terms reposed in Congress; who as before observed, are by the 13th article, expressly authorised to propose alterations.  
By so far was the measure from originating in improper views of that body, that if I am rightly informed, it did not originate there at all—it was first suggested by a convention of the four Eastern states, and New-York, at Hartford; and I believe was proposed there by the deputies of this state. A gentleman on our bench, unconnected with Congress, who now hears me (I mean judge Hobart) was one of them. It was dictated by a principle which bitter experience then taught us, and which in peace or war will always be found true—that adequate supplies to the federal treasury, can never flow from any system which requires the intervention of thirteen deliberatives between the call and the execution.  
Congress agreed to the measure and recommended it. This state complied without hesitation. All parts of the government, senate, assembly, and council of revision concurred—neither the constitution nor the public liberty presented any obstacle—the difficulties from these sources are a recent discovery.  
So late as the first session of the legislature after the evacuation of this city, the governor of the state in his speech to both houses, gave a decided countenance to the measure—this he does, though not in express terms, yet by implications not to be misunderstood.  
The leading opponents of the impost, of the present day, have all of them at other times, either concurred in the measure in its most exceptionable form, and without the qualifications annexed to it by the proposed bill, or have by other instances of conduct contradicted their own hypothesis on the constitution which professedly forms the main prop of their opposition.  
The honorable member in my eye, (Mr. Jones,) at the last session brought in a bill for granting to the United States, the power of regulating the trade of the union. This surely includes more ample legislative authority than is comprehended in the mere power of levying a particular duty. It indeed goes to a prodigious extent much farther than on a superficial view can be imagined. Can we believe that the constitutional objection, if well founded would so long have passed undiscovered and unnoticed? or is it fair to impute to Congress criminal motives for proposing a measure which was first recommended to them by five states, or from persisting in that measure after the unequivocal experience they have had of the total inefficacy of the mode provided in the confederation for supplying the treasury of the union?  
I leave the answer to these questions to the good sense and candor of the committee and shall return to the examination of the question, how far the power proposed to be conferred upon Congress, would be dangerous to the liberty of the people. And here I ask,  
Whence can this danger arise? The members of Congress are annually chosen by the several legislatures—they are removable at any moment at the pleasure of those legislatures. They come together with different habits, prejudices and interests. They are in fact continually changing. How is it possible for a body so composed to be formidable to the liberties of states, several of which are large empires in themselves?  
The subversion of the liberty of these states could not be the business of a day. It would at least require time, premeditation and concert. Can it be supposed that the members of a body so constituted would be unanimous in a scheme of usurpation? If they were not, would it not be discovered and disclosed? If we could even suppose this unanimity among one set of men, can we believe that all the new members who are yearly sent from one state or another would instantly enter into the same views? Would there not be found one honest man to warn his country of the danger?  
Suppose the worst—suppose the combination entered into and continued—the execution would at least announce the design; and the means of defence would be easy. Consider the separate power of several of these states, and the situation of all. Consider the extent populousness and resources of Massachusetts, Virginia, Pennsylvania; I might add of New-York, Connecticut, and other states. Where could Congress find means sufficient to subvert the government and liberties of either of these states! or rather where find means sufficient to effect the conquest of all? If an attempt was made upon one, the others from a sense of common danger, would make common cause; and they could immediately unite and provide for their joint defence.  
There is one consideration of immense force in this question not sufficiently attended to. It is this, that each state possesses in itself the full powers of government, and can at once in a regular and constitutional way, take measures for the preservation of its rights. In a single kingdom or state, if the rulers attempt to establish a tyranny, the people can only defend themselves by a tumultary insurrection; they must run to arms without concert or plan; while the usurpers cloathed with the forms of legal authority can employ the forces of the state to suppress them in embryo; and before they can have time or opportunity to give system to their opposition. With us the case is widely different, each state has a government completely organized in itself; and can at once enter into a regular plan of defence, with the forces of the community at its command it can immediately form connections with its neighbours, or even with foreign powers, if necessary.  
In a contest of this kind the body of the people will always be on the side of the state governments. This will not only result from their love of liberty and regard to their own safety; but from other strong principles of human nature. The state governments operate upon those immediate familiar personal concerns to which the sensibility of individuals is awake. The distribution of private justice belonging to them; they must always appear to the senses of the people as the immediate guardians of their rights—they will of course have the strongest hold on their attachment, respect and obedience. Another circumstance will contribute to the same end: Far the greatest number of offices and employments are in the gift of the states separately—the weight of official influence will therefore be in favor of the state governments; and with all these advantages they cannot fail to carry the people along with them in every contest with the general government in which they are not palpably in the wrong, and often when they are. What is to be feared from the efforts of Congress to establish a tyranny with the great body of the people under the direction of their state governments combined in opposition to their views? Must not their attempts recoil upon themselves, and terminate in their own ruin and disgrace? or rather would not these considerations, if they were insensible to other motives, forever restrain them from making such attempts.  
The causes taken notice of as securing the attachment of the people to their local governments, present us with another important truth—the natural imbecility of federal governments, and the danger that they will never be able to exercise power enough to manage the general affairs of the union. Though the states will have a common interest; yet they will also have a particular interest. For example, as a part of the union, it will be the interest of every state, that the general government should be supplied with the revenues necessary for the national purposes; but it will be the particular interest of each state to pay as little itself and to let its neighbours pay as much as possible. Particular interests have always more influence upon men than general. The several states therefore consulting their immediate advantage may be considered as so many eccentric powers tending in a contrary direction to the government of the union; and as they will generally carry the people along with them, the confederacy will be in continual danger of dissolution.  
This, Mr. Chairman is the real rock upon which the happiness of this country is likely to split—this is the point to which our fears and cares should be directed—to guard against this and not to terrify ourselves with imaginary dangers from the spectre of power in Congress will be our true wisdom.  
But let us examine a little more closely the measure under consideration. What does the bill before us require us to do? merely to grant certain duties on imposts to the United States for the short period of twenty-five years,—to be applied to the discharge of the principal and interest of the debts contracted for the support of the late war; the collection of which duties, is to be made by officers appointed by the state but accountable to Congress, according to such general regulations as the United States shall establish; subject to these important checks, that no citizen should be carried out of the state for trial; that all prosecutions shall be in our own courts; that no excessive fines or penalties shall be imposed; and that a yearly account of the proceeds and application of the revenue shall be rendered to the legislature, on failure of which, it reserves to itself a right of repealing its grant.  
Is it possible for any measure to be better guarded? or is it possible that a grant for such precise objects and with so many checks can be dangerous to the public liberty?  
Having now, as I trust, satisfactorily shewn that the constitution offers no obstacle to the measure; and that the liberty of the people cannot be endangered by it; it remains only to consider it in the view of revenue.  
The sole question left for discussion, is, whether it be an eligible mode of supplying the federal treasury or not?  
The better to answer this question it will be of use to examine how far the mode by quotas and requisitions has been found competent to the public exigencies.  
The universal delinquency of the states during the war, shall be passed over with the bare mention of it. The public embarrassments were a plausible apology for that delinquency; and [if] it was hoped the peace would produce greater punctuality the experiment has disappointed that hope to a degree, which confounds the least sanguine. A comparative view of the compliances of the several states, for the five last years will furnish a striking result.  
During that period as appears by a statement on our files, New-Hampshire, North-Carolina, South-Carolina and Georgia, have paid nothing. I say nothing because the only actual payment, is the trifling sum of about 7000 dollars, by New-Hampshire. South-Carolina indeed has credits but these are merely by way of discount, on the supplies furnished by her during the war, in consideration of her peculiar sufferings and exertions while the immediate theatre of it.  
Connecticut and Delaware, have paid about one third of their requisitions. Massachusetts, Rhode-Island, and Maryland, about one half. Virginia, about three fifths; Pennsylvania, nearly the whole, and New-York, more than her quota.  
These proportions are taken on the specie requisitions, the indents have been very partially paid, and in their present state, are of little account.  
The payments into the federal treasury have declined rapidly each year. The whole amount for three years past in specie, has not exceeded 1,400,000 dollars, of which New-York has paid 100 per cent, more than her proportion. This sum, little more than 400,000 dollars a year, it will readily be conceived has been exhausted in the support of the civil establishments of the union, and the necessary guards and garrisons at public arsenals, and on the frontiers; without any surplus for paying any part of the debt, foreign or domestic, principal or interest.  
  
Things are continually growing worse, the last year in particular produced less than two hundred thousand dollars, and that from only two or three states. Several of the states have been so long unaccustomed to pay, that they seem no longer concerned even about the appearances of compliance.  
Connecticut and Jersey have almost formally declined paying any longer. The ostensible motive is the non-concurrence of this state in the impost system. The real one must be conjectured from the fact.  
Pennsylvania, if I understand the scope of some late resolutions, means to discount the interest she pays upon her assumption to her own citizens; in which case, there will be little coming from her to the United States. This seems to be bringing matters to a crisis.  
The pecuniary support of the federal government has of late devolved almost entirely upon Pennsylvania and New-York. If Pennsylvania refuses to contine her aid, what will be the situation of New-York? Are we willing to be the Atlas of the union? or are we willing to see it perish?  
This seems to be the alternative. Is there not a species of political knight errantry in adhering pertinaciously to a system which throws the whole weight of the confederacy upon this state, or upon one or two more? Is it not our interest on mere calculations of state-policy, to promote a measure which operating under the same regulations in every state, must produce an equal, or nearly equal, effect every where, and oblige all the states to share the common burthen?  
If the impost is granted to the United-States, with the power of levying it, it must have a proportional effect in all the states; for the same mode of collection every where, will have nearly the same result every where.  
What must be the final issue of the present state of things? Will the few states that now contribute, be willing to contribute much longer? Shall we ourselves be long content with bearing the burthen singly? will not our zeal for a particular system, soon give way to the pressure of so unequal a weight? and if all the states cease to pay, what is to become of the union? It is sometimes asked why do not Congress oblige the states to do their duty; but where are the means? Where are the fleets and armies, where the federal treasury to support those fleets and armies, to enforce the requisitions of the union? All methods short of coertion, have repeatedly been tried in vain.  
Let us now proceed to another most important inquiry. How are we to pay our foreign debt?  
This I think is estimated at about 7000,000 of dollars; which will every year increase with the accumulations of interest. It we pay neither principal nor interest, we not only abandon all pretensions to character as a nation; but we endanger the public peace. However, it may be in our power to evade the just demands of our domestic creditors; our foreign creditors must and will be paid.  
They have power to enforce their demands, and sooner or later they may be expected to do it. It is not my intention to endeavour to excite the apprehensions of the committee; but I would appeal to their prudence. A discreet attention to the consequences of national measures is no impeachment of our firmness.  
The foreign debt, I say, must sooner or later he paid, and the longer provision is delayed, the heavier it must fall at last.  
We require about 1,600,000 dollars, to discharge the interest and instalments of the present year; about a million annually upon an average for ten years more, and about 300,000 dollars for another ten years.  
The product of the impost, may be computed at about a million of dollars annually. It is an increasing fund—this fund would not only suffice for the discharge of the foreign debt, but important operations might be ingrafted upon it, towards the extinguishment of the domestic debt.  
Is it possible to hesitate about the propriety of adopting a resource so easy in itself and so extensive in its effects?  
Here I expect I may be told there is no objection to employing this resource; the act of the last session does it. The only dispute is about the mode. We are willing to grant the money but not the power required from us. Money will pay our debts; power may destroy our liberties. It has been insinuated that nothing but a lust of power would have prevented Congress from accepting the grant in the shape it has already passed the legislature.  
This is a severe charge; if true, it ought undoubtedly to prevent our going a step further. But it is easy to show that Congress could not have accepted our grant without removing themselves further from the object, than they now are. To gain one state they must have lost all the others.  
The grants of every state are accompanied with a condition, that similar grants be made by the other states. It is not denied that our act is essentially different from theirs. Their acts give the United States the power of collecting the duty—Ours reserves it to the state, and makes it receivable in paper money.  
The immediate consequence of accepting our grant would be a relinquishment of the grants of the other states; they must take the matter up anew, and do the work over again, to accommodate it to our standard. In order to anchor one state, would it have been wise to set twelve, or at least eleven others afloat?  
It is said that the states which have granted more would certainly be willing to grant less. They would easily accommodate their acts to that of New-York, as more favorable to their own power and security.  
But would Massachusetts and Virginia, which have no paper money of their own, accede to a plan that permitted other states to pay in paper while they paid in specie? Would they consent that their citizens should pay twenty shillings in the pound, while the citizens of Rhode-Island paid only four, the citizens of North-Carolina ten, and of other states in different degrees of inequality, in proportion to the relative depreciation of their paper? Is it wise in this state to cherish a plan that gives such an advantage to the citizens of other states over its own?  
The paper money of the state of New-York, in most transactions is equal to gold and silver—that of Rhode-Island is depreciated to five for one—that of North-Carolina to two for one—that of South-Carolina may perhaps be worth fifteen shillings in the pound.  
If the states pay the duties in paper, is it not evident that for every pound of that duty consumed by the citizen of New-York he would pay 20s. while the citizen of South-Carolina would pay 15s. of North-Carolina, 10s and Rhode-Island, only four!  
This consideration alone, is sufficient to condemn the plan of our grant of last session, and to prove incontestably, that the states which are averse to emitting a paper currency, or have it in their power to support one when emitted, would never come into it.  
  
Again, would those states which by their public acts demonstrate a conviction that the powers of the union require augmentation; which are conscious of energy in their own administration—would they be willing to concur in a plan, which left the collection of the duties in the hands of each state, and of course subject to all the inequalities which a more or less vigourous system of collection would produce?  
This too is an idea which ought to have great weight with us—we have better habits of government than are to be found in some of the states—and our constitution admits of more energy than the constitution of most of the other states—the duties therefore would be more effectually collected with us than in such states, and this would have a similar effect to the depreciation of the money, in imposing a greater burthen on the citizens of this state.  
If any state should incline to evade the payment of the duties, having the collection in its own hands, nothing would be easier than to effect it, and without materially sacrificing appearances.  
It is manifest from this view of the subject, that we have the strongest reasons as a state, to depart from our own act: and that it would have been highly injudicious in Congress to have accepted it.  
If there even had been a prospect of the concurrence of the other states in the plan, how inadequate would it have been to the public exigencies—fettered with the embarrassments of a depreciating paper.  
It is to no purpose to say that the faith of the state was pledged by the act, to make the paper equal to gold and silver—and that the other states would be obliged to do the same; what greater dependance can be had on the faith of the states pledged to this measure, than on the faith they pledged in the confederation, sanctioned by a solemn appeal to heaven. If the obligation of faith in one case, have had so little influence upon their conduct in respect to the requisitions of Congress; what hope can there be that they would have greater influence in respect to the deficiencies of the paper money?  
There yet remains an important light in which to consider the subject in the view of revenue. It is a clear point that we cannot carry the duties upon imposts to the same extent by separate arrangements as by a general plan—we must regulate ourselves by what we find done in the neighbouring states: while Pennsylvania has only two and a half per cent. on her importations we cannot greatly exceed her—we must content ourselves with the same or nearly the same rate. To go much beyond it would injure our commerce in a variety of ways, and would defeat itself—while the ports of Connecticut and Jersey are open to the introduction of goods, free from duty and the conveyance from them to us is so easy—while they consider our imposts as an ungenerous advantage taken of them, which it would be laudable to elude, the duties must be light or they would be evaded—the facility of doing it, and the temptation to do it would be both so great that we should collect, perhaps less by an increase of the rates than we do now. Already we experience the effects of this situation. But if the duties were to be levied under a common direction, with the same precautions every where to guard against smuggling, they might be carried without prejudice to trade to a much more considerable height.  
As things now are, we must adhere to the present standard of duties, without any material alterations. Suppose this to produce fifty thousand pounds a year. The duties to be granted to Congress ought, in proportion, to produce double that sum. To this it appears by a scheme now before us, that additional duties might be imposed for the use of the state, on certain enumerated articles, to the amount of thirty thousand pounds. This would be an augmentation of our national revenue by indirect taxation to the extent of eighty thousand pounds a year; an immense object in a single state, which alone demonstrates the good policy of the measure.  
It is no objection to say that a great part of this fund will be dedicated to the use of the United States. Their exigencies must be supplied in some way or other—the more is done towards it by means of the impost, the less will be to be done in other modes. If we do not employ that resource to the best account, we must find others in direct taxation. And to this are opposed all the habits and prejudices of the community. There is not a farmer in the state who would not pay a shilling in the voluntary consumption of articles on which a duty is paid, rather than a penny imposed immediately on his house and land.  
There is but one objection to the measure under consideration that has come to my knowledge, which yet remains to be discussed. I mean the effect it is supposed to have upon our paper currency. It is said the diversion of this fund would leave the credit of the paper without any effectual support.  
Though I should not be disposed to put a consideration, of this kind in competition with the safety of the union; yet I should be extremely cautious about doing any thing that might affect the credit of our currency. The legislature having thought an emission of paper advisable, I consider it my duty as a representative of the people to take care of its credit. But it appears to me that apprehensions on this score are without foundation.  
What has hitherto been the principal support of the credit of the paper? Two things—the universal demand for money, and the immediate interest of the merchants to countenance whatever would facilitate the recovery of his debts. The first cause begat a general clamour in the country for a paper emission, and a disposition to uphold its credit. The farmers appeared willing to exchange their produce for it; the merchant on the other hand, had large debts outstanding; they supposed that giving a free circulation to the paper, would enable their customers in the country to pay, and as they perceived, that they would have it in their power to convert the money into produce, they naturally resolved to give it their support.  
These causes combined to introduce the money into general circulation, and having once obtained credit, it will now be able to support itself.  
The chief difficulty to have been apprehended in respect to the paper, was to overcome the diffidence which the still recent experience of depreciating paper, had instilled into mens minds. This, it was to have been feared, would have shaken its credit at its outset; and if it had once began to sink, it would be no easy matter to prevent its total decline.  
The event has however turned out otherwise and the money has been fortunate enough to conciliate the general confidence. This point gained, there need be no apprehensions of its future fate, unless the government should do something to destroy that confidence.  
The causes that first gave it credit, still operate, and will in all probability continue to do so. The demand for money has not lessened, and the merchant has still the same inducement to countenance the circulation of the paper.  
I shall not deny that the outlet which the payment of duties furnished to the merchant, was an additional motive to the reception of the paper. Nor is it proposed to take away this motive. There is now before the house a bill, one object of which is, the establishment of a state impost, on certain enumerated articles, in addition to that to be granted to the United States. It is computed on very good grounds that the additional duties would amount to about 30,000 £. and as they would be payable in paper currency, they would create a sufficient demand upon the merchant, to leave him in this respect, substantially the same inducement which he had before. Indeed independent of this, the readiness of the trading people to take the money, can never be doubted, while it will freely command the commodities of the country; for this, to them, is the most important use they can make of it.  
But besides the state impost, there must be other taxes; and these will all contribute to create a demand for the money; which is all we now mean, when we talk of funds for its support; for there are none appropriated for the redemption of the paper.  
Upon the whole the additional duties will be a competent substitute for those now in existence; and the general good will of the community towards the paper, will be the best security for its credit.  
Having now shewn, Mr. Chairman, that there is no constitutional impediment to the adoption of the bill; that there is no danger to be apprehended to the public liberty from giving the power in question to the United States; that in the view of revenue the measure under consideration is not only expedient, but necessary. Let us turn our attention to the other side of this important subject. Let us ask ourselves what will be the consequence of rejecting the bill; what will be the situation of our national affairs if they are left much longer to float in the chaos in which they are now involved.  
Can our national character be preserved without paying our debts. Can the union subsist without revenue. Have we realized the consequences which would attend its dissolution.  
If these states are not united under a federal government, they will infalliably have wars with each other; and their divisions will subject them to all the mischiefs of foreign influence and intrigue. The human passions will never want objects of hospitality. The western territory is an obvious and fruitful source of contest. Let us also cast our eye upon the mass of this state, intersected from one extremity to the other by a large navigable river. In the event of a rupture with them, what is to hinder our metropolis from becoming a prey to our neighbours? Is it even supposeable that they would suffer it to remain the nursery of wealth to a distinct community?  
These subjects are delicate, but it is necessary to contemplate them to teach us to form a true estimate of our situation.  
Wars with each other would beget standing armies—a source of more real danger to our liberties than all the power that could be conferred upon the representatives of the union. And wars with each other would lead to opposite alliances with foreign powers, and plunge us into all the labyrinths of European politics.  
The Romans in their progress to universal dominion, when they conceived the project of subduing the refractory spirit of the Grecian Republics, which composed the famous Achaian league, began by sowing dissensions among them, and instilling jealousies of each other, and of the common head, and finished by making them a province of the Roman empire.  
The application is easy; if there are any foreign enemies, if there are any domestic foes to this country, all their arts and artifices will be employed to effect a dissolution of the union. This cannot be better done than by sowing jealousies of the federal head and cultivating in each state an undue attachment to its own

tion nor the public: liberty  
prefented any obftacle. The  
difficulties from thefe fources  
are a recent difcovery.  
  
So late as the firft feffion of  
the legiflature after the evacu-  
ation of the city, the governor  
of the ftate, in his fpeech to  
both houfes, gave a decided  
countenance to the meafure :  
this he did, though not in ex-  
prefs terms, yet by implica-  
tions not to be mifunderftood.  
  
The leading opponents of  
the impoft, of the prefent day,  
have all of them, at other  
times, either cohcurred’in the  
meafure in its moft exception-  
able form, and without the  
  
ualifications annexed to it by  
the propofed bill; or have, by  
other inftances of conduct,  
contradicted their own hypo-  
thefis on the conftitution,  
which profeffedly forms the  
main prop of their oppofition.  
  
The hon. member in my  
eye, [mr. Jones], at the laft  
feffion, brought in a bill for  
cranting to congrefs the power  
of wee. Sethe the trade of the  
union. This furely includes  
  
6  
  
more ample legiflative autho-  
rity than is comprehended in  
the mere power of levying a  
particular duty. It indeed goes  
to a prodigious extent, much  
farther than on a fuperficial  
view can be imagined. Can  
we believe that the conftitu-  
tional objection, if well found-  
ed, would fo long have paffed  
undifcovered ? Or is it fair to  
impute to congrefs, criminal  
motives for propofing a mea-  
fure, whieh was firft recom  
mended to them by five ftates 5  
or for perfifting in that mea-  
fure, after the unequivocal  
experience they have had, of  
the total inefficacy of the  
mode provided in the confe-  
deration, for fupplying the  
treafury of the union ?  
  
I Jeave the anfwer to thefe  
queftions to the good fenfe  
and ¢andour of the commit-  
tee ; and fhall return to the  
examination of the queftion,  
how far thé power propofed to  
be conferred upon congrefs  
would be dangerous to the  
liberty of the people? And  
here I ask,  
  
Whence can this danger  
arife? The members of con-  
grefs are chofen annually by  
the feveral legiflatures. They  
are removeable at any moment  
at the pleafure of thofe legif-  
latures. They come together  
with different habits, preju-  
dices, and interefts. They are,  
in fact, continually changing.  
How is it poflible for a body  
fo compofed, to be formidable

to the liberties of ftates, feve-  
ral of which are large empires  
in themfelves ?  
  
The fubverfion of the liber-  
ty of thefe ftates could not be  
the bufinefs oi a day. It would,  
at leaft, require time, preme-  
ditation, and concert. Can it  
be fuppofed, that the members  
of a body fo conftituted,  
would be unanimous in a  
{cheme of ufurpation? If they  
were not, would it not be dif-  
covered and difclofed ? Ii we  
could even fuppofe this una-  
nimity among one fet of men,  
can we believe that all the new  
members, who are yearly fent  
from one ftate or another,  
would inftantly enter into the  
  
fame views? Would there not’  
  
be found one honeft man to  
warn his country of the dan-  
ger?  
  
Suppofe the worft: fup-  
pofe the combination entered  
into, and continued : the ex-  
ecution would at Ieaft an-  
nounce the defign; and the  
means of defence would be  
eafy. Confider the feparate  
power of feveral of thefe  
ftates, and the fituation of  
all. Confider the extent, po-  
  
uloufnefs, and refources of  
Maffachufetts, Virginia, Penn-  
fylvania ; I might add, of  
New York, Conneéticut, and  
other ftates. Where could  
congrefs find means fufficient  
to fubvert the government  
and liberties of either of thefe  
ftates 2? Or rather, where find  
  
7  
  
means fufficient to effect the  
  
Col. Hamilton’s Speech on the Impo/t.  
  
congueft of all ? If an attempr  
was mad¢ upon one, the  
others, from a fenfe of com-  
mon danger, .would make  
common caufe: and they  
couldimmediately unite, and  
provide for their joint defence,  
There is one confideration  
of immenfe force in this quef-  
tion, not fufficiently attended  
to. It is this, that each ftate  
poffeffes in itfelf the full pow-  
ers of government 3 and can  
at once, in a regular and con-  
ftitutional way, take meafures  
for the prefervation of ‘ts  
rights. In a fingle kingdom ox  
ftare, if the rulers attempt to  
efiablifh a tyranny, the peo-  
pie can only defend themfelves  
by a tumultuary infurrection.  
They muft run to arms with-  
out concert or plan 5 while  
the ufurpers, clothed with the  
forms of legal authority, can  
employ the forces of the ftate  
to fupprefs them in embryo,  
and beiore they can have time  
or opportunity to give fyftem  
to their oppofition. Wath us  
the cafe is widely different.  
Each ftate has a government  
completely organized in itfelf;  
and can at once enter intoa  
regular plan of defence with  
the forces of the community at  
its Command ; it can imme-  
diately form connections with  
its neighbours, or even with  
foreign powers, if necefary.  
In a conteft of this kind,  
the body of the people will al-  
ways be on the fide of the flate-  
governments. This will not

only refult from their love of  
liberty, and regard to their  
own fafety ; but from other  
ftrong principles of human  
nature. [he ftate-governments  
operate upon thole immediate  
familiar perfonal concerns, to  
which the fenfibility of indi-  
viduals is awake. The diftri-  
bution of private juftice be-  
longing to them, they muft  
always appear to the fenfes of  
the people as the immediate  
guardians of their rights. They  
will, of courfe, have the ftrong-  
eft hold on their attachmenr,  
refpect, and obedience. An-  
other circumftance will con-  
tribute to the fame end : far  
the greateft number of offices  
and employments are in the  
gift of the ftates feparately :  
the weight of official influence  
will, therefore, be in favour  
of the ftate-governments : and  
with all thefe advantages, they  
cannot fail to carry the people  
along with them in every con-  
teft with the general govern-  
ment, in which they are not  
palpably in the wrong, and  
often when they are. What is  
to be feared from the efforts  
of congrefs to eftablifh a ty-  
ranny, with the great body of  
the people, under the direction  
of their ftate-governments,  
combined in oppofition to  
their views? Muft not their  
attempts recoil upon them-  
felves, and terminate in their  
own difgrace ? Or rather would  
  
not thefe confiderations, if  
  
they were infenfible to other  
  
517  
motives, for ever reftrain them  
from making fuch attempts ?  
  
The caufes taken notice of,  
as fecuring the attachment of  
the people to their local go-  
vernments, prefent us with  
another important truth---the  
natural imbecility of federal  
governments, andthe danger  
that they will never be able to  
exercife power enough to ma-  
nage the general affairs of the  
union. Though the ftates will  
have a2 common intereft, yet  
they will alfo have a particu-  
lar intereft. For example, as a  
part of the union, it will be  
the intereft of every ftate, thae  
the general government fhould  
be funplied with the revenues  
neceflary for the national pur-  
pofes: but it will be the par-  
ticular intereft of each ftate,  
to pay as little itfelf, and to  
let its neighbours pay as much  
as poffible. Particular interefts  
have always more influence  
upon men than general. The  
feveral ftates, therefore, con-  
fulting their immediate advan-  
tage, may be confidered as fo  
many eccentric powers, tend-  
ing in a contrary direction to  
the government of the union:  
and as they will generally  
carry the people along with  
them, the confederation will  
be in continual danger of dif-  
folution.  
  
This, mr. Chairman, is the  
real rock upon which the hap-  
pinefs of this country is likely  
to fplit. This is the point to  
which our fears and cares  
fhould  
  
  
  
518  
fhould be directed. To guard  
againft this, and not to terrify  
ourfelves with imaginary dan-  
gers from the fpectre of power  
in congrefs, will be our true  
wifdom.  
  
But let us examine a little  
more clofely the meafure un-  
der confideration. What does  
the bill before us require us to  
do? merely to grant certain  
duties on impofts to the united  
ftates, for the fhort period of  
twenty five years, to be applied  
to the difcharge of the prinei-  
pal and intereft of the debts  
contracted for the fupport of  
the late war ; the collection of  
which duties, is to be made by  
officers appointed by the ftate,  
but accountable to congrefs,  
according to fuch general re-  
  
lations as the united ftates  
fhall eftablith ; fubjec&amp;t to  
thefe important checks, that  
no citizen fhall be carried out  
of the ftate for trial; that all  
profecutions fhall be in our  
own courts; that no exceffive  
fines or penalties fhall be  
impofed ; and that a yearly ac-  
count of the proceeds and ap-  
  
lication of the revenue fhall  
  
e rendered to the legifla-  
ture ; on failure of which, it  
xeferves to itfelf a right of re-  
pealing its grant.  
  
Is it poflible for any mea-  
fure to be better guarded ? or  
is it poflible that a grant for  
fuch precife objects, and with  
fo many checks, can be dan-  
gerous to the public liberty ?  
  
Having now, I truft, farif-  
  
Col. Hamilton’s Speech on the Impoft.  
  
factorily fhewn that the confti-  
tution offers no obftacle to the  
meafure---and that the liber-  
ty of the people cannot be en-  
dangered by it---it remains on-  
ly to confider it in the view of  
revenue.  
  
The fole queftion left for  
difcuffion, is, whether it be an  
eligible mode of fupplying the  
federal treafury or not?  
  
The better to anfwer this  
queftion, it will be of ufe to  
examine how far the mode by  
quotas and requifitions has  
been found competent to the  
public exigencies.  
  
The univerfal delinquency  
of the ftates, during the war,  
fhall be paffed over with the  
bare mention of it. The public  
embarraffments were a plaufi-  
ble apology for that delin-  
quency : and it was hoped the  
peace would produce greater  
punctuality---the experiment  
has difappointed that hope toa  
degret, which confounds the  
  
leaft fanguine. A comparative  
view of the compliances of  
  
the feveral ftates, for the  
five laft years,will furnith a ftri-  
king refulr,  
  
During that period, as ap-  
pears by a ftatement on our  
files, New Hampfhire, North  
Carolina, South Carolina,  
and Georgia, have paid no-  
thing. I fay nothing, becaufe  
the only actual payment, is the  
trifling fum of about 700e dol-  
lars, by New Hampfhire.  
South Carolina indeed has cré-  
dits, but thefe are merely by  
  
way  
  
  
  
Col. Hamilton’ s Speech on the Impoft.  
  
way of difcount, on the fup-  
plies furnifhed by her during  
  
e war, in confideration of her  
peculiar fufferings and exerti-  
oris while the immediate thea-  
tre of it.  
  
Connecticut and Delaware  
have paid about one third of  
their requifitions. Maffachu-  
fetts, Rhode Ifland, and-Mary-  
land, about one half. Virginia,  
about three-fifths. Pennfylva-  
nia, nearly the whole, and  
New York, more than her  
quota.  
  
Thefe proportions are taken  
on the fpecie requifitions ; the  
indents have been very parti-  
ally paid, and in their pre-  
fent ftate, arc of little account.  
  
The payments into the fede-  
ral treafury have declined ra-  
pidly each year. The whole  
  
amount, for three years paft, in  
  
fpecie, has not exceeded  
1,400,000 dollars, of which  
New York has paid roo per  
cent. more than her proporti-  
on. This fum, little more than  
400,000 dollars a year, it will  
readily be conceived, has been  
exhaufted in the fupport of the  
civil eftablifhments of the uni-  
on, and the neceflary guards  
and garrifons at public arfe-  
nals, and on the frontiers ;  
without any furplus for pay-  
ing any part of the debt, fo-  
reign or domeftic, principal or  
intereft.  
  
Things are continually grow-  
ing worfe ; the laft year in  
particular produced lefs than  
two hundred thoufand dollars,  
  
s19  
and that from only two or three  
ftates. Several of the ftates  
have been fo long unaccuftom-  
ed to pay, that they feem no  
longer concerned even about  
the appearances of compliance.  
  
Connecticut and Jerfey  
have almoft formally declined  
paying anylonger. The often-  
fible motive is the non-concur-  
rence of this ftate in the imroft  
fyftem. * The real one muft be  
conjectured from the fact.  
  
Pennfylvania, if I under-  
ftand the fcope of fome late re-  
folutions, means to difcount  
the intereft fhepays on her af-  
fumption to her own citizens:  
in which cafe, there will be lit-  
tle coming from her tothe uni-  
ted ftates. This feems to be  
bringing matters toa crifis.  
  
The pecuniary fupport of  
the federal government has of  
late devolved almoft entirely  
upon Pennfylvania and New-  
York. If Pennfylvania refufes  
to continue her aid, what will  
be the fituation of New York?  
Are we willing to be the Atlas  
of the union? or are we wil-  
ling to fee it perifh ?  
  
This feems to be the alrer-  
native. Is there nota fpecies of  
political knight-errantry in ad-  
hering pertinacioufly toa fyf-  
tem which throws the whole  
weight of the confederacy up-  
on this ftate, or upon one or  
two more? Is it notour inte-  
reft on mere calculations of  
ftate policy to promote a mea-  
fure which operating under  
the fame regulations in —  
fate,  
  
  
  
J20  
  
ftaty, muft produce an equal,  
or nearly equal, effect every  
where, and oblige all the ftates  
to fhare the common burden?  
  
If the impott is granted to  
the united ftates, with a power  
  
f levying it, it muft have a  
proportional effect in all the  
{tates ; for the fame mode of  
collection every where, will  
have nearly the fame refult  
every where.  
  
What mut he the final iffue  
of the prefent ftate of things?  
Will the few ftates that now  
contribute, be willing to con-  
tribute much longer? Shall we  
ourfelves be long content with  
bearing the burden fingly ?  
Will not our zeal for a parti-  
cular fyftem foon give way to  
the preffure of fo unequal a  
weight ? and if all the ftates  
ceafe to pay, what is to become  
of the union? It is fometimes  
asked, why do not conerefs o-  
blige the ftates to do their du-  
ty: but where are the means?  
Where are the fieets and ar-  
mies, where the federal treafu-  
ty to fupport thofe fleets and  
armies, to enforce the requifi-  
tions of the union? All me-  
thods, fhort of coercion, have  
  
epeatedly been tried in vain.  
  
Letus now proceed to an-  
other moft important enqui-  
ry. How are we to pay our fo-  
reign debt?  
  
This, I think, is eftimated at  
about 7,000,000 of dollars,  
which will every year increafe  
with the accumulations of 1n-  
ereft. If we pay neither prin-  
  
Co?. Hamilton’s Speech on the Impoft.  
  
cipal nor intereft, we not only  
abandon all pretenfions to cha-  
racter as anation; but we ers  
danger the public peace. How-  
ever it may be in our power to  
evade the juft demands of our  
domettic creditors ; our foreign  
creditors muft and will be paid.  
  
They have power to aie  
their demands: and fooner or  
later they may be expected to  
do it. It is not my intention to  
endeavour to excite the appre-  
henfions of the committee, but  
I would appeal to their pru-  
dence. A difcreet attenfion to  
the confequences of national  
meafures is no impeachment of  
our firmnefs.  
  
The foreign debt, I fay,  
  
-muft fooner or later be paid:  
  
and the longer provifion is de-  
layed, the heavier it muft fall at  
laft. ;  
Werequire about 1,600,000  
dollars to difcharge the intereft  
and inftalments of the prefent  
year; about a million annual-  
ly, upon an average, for ten  
years more ; and _ about  
300,000 dollars for another  
ten years.  
  
The produ&amp;t of the impoft  
may be computed at about a  
million of dollarsannually, It  
is an increafing fund----this  
fund would not only fuffice  
for the difcharge of the foreign  
debt, but important operations  
might be ingrafted upon it,  
towards the extinguifhment of  
the domeftic debt.  
  
Is it poffible to hefitate about  
the propriety of adopting a re-  
  
fource  
  
  
  
Col. Hamilton’s Specch on the Impoft.  
  
fource fo cafy in itfelf, and fo  
extenfive in its effects ?  
  
Here I may e&amp;pect to be told  
there is no objeclion to em-  
ploying this refource; the act  
of the laft feffion does it. The  
only difpute is about the  
mode. We are willing to grant  
the moncy, but not the power  
required {romus. Money will  
pay our debts: power may de-  
{troy our liberties. It has been  
infinuated that nothing but a  
luft of power would have pre-  
vented congrefs from accept-  
ing the grant in the fhape it  
has already paffed the legifla-  
ture.  
  
This is a fevere charge; if  
  
true, it ought undoubtedly to  
prevent our going a ftep fur-  
ther. But it Is ealy to fhew  
  
that congrefs could not have  
accepted our grant without re-  
  
moving themfelves further  
from the object, than they  
now are. To gain one ftate,  
they muft have loft all the o-  
thers.  
  
The grants of every ftate are  
accompanied with a condition,  
that fimilar grants be made by  
the other ftates. It is not deni-  
ed that our act is effentially  
different from theirs. Their  
acls give the united ftates the  
power of collecting the duty---  
ours referves it to the ftate, and  
makes it receivable in paper  
money.  
  
The immediate confequence  
of accepting our grant would  
be a relinquifhment of the  
  
grants of the other fates. They  
  
52%  
muft take the matter up anew,  
and do the work over again, to  
accommodate it to our ftand-  
ard. In order to anchor one  
ftate, would it have been wife  
to fet twelve, or at leaft eleven  
others afloat?  
  
It is faid that the ftates  
which have granted more  
would certainly be willing to  
{ ‘Yant lefs. Ti hey wou! d eafily

of New York, as more favour-

fecurity.  
  
But woul | Mafiac hufettsand  
Virginia, which have no paper  
money of their own, accede to  
a plan thar permitted other  
ftates to pay in paper, while  
they paid in fp: ci? Would  
they confent th nat thei cir citizens

the citizens of North Carolina

in proportion to the re lative  
depreciation of their paper? Is  
it wife in this ftate to cherith  
a plan that gives fuch advan-  
tage to the citizens of other  
{tates over its own ?  
  
The paper money of the ftate  
of New York,in moft tranfacti-  
ons, is eq ual to coldand filver  
---that of Rhode Ifland is de-  
preciated to five for one---that  
of North Carolina, to two for  
one---that of South Carolina  
may perhaps be worth fifteen  
fillings in the pound.  
  
Ifthe ftates pay the duties in

paper, is it not evident, that  
for every pound of that duty  
confumed by the citizen of  
New York, he would pay  
twenty fhillings, while the ci-  
tizen of South Carolina would  
pay fifteen fhillings, of North-  
Carolina, ten fhillings, and  
Rhode Ifland, only four?  
  
‘This confideration alone is  
fufficient to condemn the plan  
of our grant of laft fefion, and  
_ to prove inconteftably, that  
the ftates which are averfe to  
erhitting a paper currency, or  
h:ve it in their power to fup-  
port one when emitted, would  
never come into it.  
  
Again, would thofe ftates,  
which, by their public acts de-  
monftrate a conviction that the  
powers of the union require  
augmentation--which are con-  
{cious of energy in their own  
adminiftration----would they  
be willing to concur ina plan,  
which left the collection of the  
duties in the hands of each  
ftate, and of courfe fubject to  
all the inequalities which a  
more or lefs vigorous fyftem of  
collection would produce ?  
  
This, too, is an idea which  
ought to have great weight  
with us-—we have better ha-  
bits of government than are to  
be found in fome of the ftates  
---and our conftitution admits  
of more energy than the con-

Col. Hamilton’s Speech on the Impoft.  
  
‘ fpe&amp; to the deficiencies of the  
papermoney?  
There yet remains an impor-  
tant light, in which to confi-  
der the fubject in the view of  
revenue. It is a clear point,  
that we cannot carry the du-  
tics upon impofts to the fame  
extent by feparate arrange-  
ments as by a general plan; we  
muft regulate ourfelves by  
what we find done in the neigh-  
bouring ftates. While Penn-  
fylvania has only two and a  
half per cent. on her importa-  
tions, we cannot greatly ex-  
ceed her; we muft content our-  
felves with the fame, or nearly  
the fame rate. To go much be-  
yond ic would injure our com-  
merce in a variety of ways, and  
would defeat itfelf---while the  
ports of Connecticut and Jer-  
fey are open to the introducti-  
on of goods, free from duty,  
and the conveyance from them  
to us is fo eafy—-while they  
confider our impofts as an un-  
generous advantage taken of  
them, which it would be laud-  
able to elude, the duties muft  
be light, or they would be eva-  
ded: the facility of doing it,  
and the temptation to do it,  
would be both fo great, that  
we fhould, perhaps, collect  
lefs by an increafe of the rates,  
than we do now. Already do  
we experience the effects of  
this firuation. But if the du-  
ties were to be levied under a  
common direction, with the  
fame precautions every where  
  
to guard againft f{muggling,  
  
6  
  
523  
they might, without prejudice  
to trade, be carried to a much  
more confiderable height.  
  
As things now ftand, we  
muft adhere to the prefene  
ftandard of duties without an  
material alterations. Suppofe  
this to produce fifty thoufand  
pounds a year. The duties to  
be granted to congrefs ought,  
in proportion, to produce dou-  
ble that fum. To this it ap-  
pears, by a fcheme now before  
us, that additional duties  
might be impofed for the ufe  
of the ftate, on certain enu-  
merated articles, tothe amount  
of thirty thoufand pounds.  
This would be an augmenta-  
tion of our national revenue,  
by indirect taxation, to the  
extent of eighty thoufand  
pounds a year---an immenfe  
object in a fingle ftate, and  
which alone demonftrates the  
good policy of the meafure.  
  
It is no objection to fay  
that a great part of this fund  
will be dedicated to the ufe of  
the united ftates. Their exi-  
gencies muft be fupplied in  
fome way or other. The more  
is done towards it by means of  
the impoft, the lefs will be to  
be done in other modes. If we  
do not employ that refource  
to the beft account, we muft  
find others in direct taxation :  
and to this are oppofed all the  
habits and prejudices of the  
community. There is not a  
farmer in the ftate, who would  
not pay a fhilling in the volun-  
tary confumption of articles  
  
; on  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
$24 Col. Hamilton’s Speech on&#x27;the lnpoft.  
  
on which a duty is paid, rathet  
than a penny impofed imme-  
diately on his houfe and land.  
There is but one objection  
to the meafure under confide-  
ration, that has come to my  
knowledge, which yet remains  
to be difcuffed. .I mean the  
effect it is fuppofed it would  
have upon our paper-currency.  
It is faid, the jaa Ha of this  
fund would leave the credit of  
the paper without any effec-  
tual fupport.  
Though I fhould not be  
difpofed to puta confideration  
of this kind in competition  
with the fafety of the union ;  
yet I fhould be extremely cau-  
tious about any thing that  
might affect our currency. The  
  
legiflature having thought an-  
  
emiffion of paper advifeable, I  
confider it my duty, as a repre-  
fentative of the people, totake  
care of its credit. But it ap-  
pears to me that apprehenfions  
gn this ground, are without  
foundation.  
  
What has hitherto been the  
principal fupport of the credit  
of the paper ? Two things: the  
lniverfal demand for money,  
and the immediate intereft of  
the merchants to countenance  
whatever would facilitate the  
tecovery of their debts. The  
firft caufe begat a general ¢la~  
mour in the country for a pa-  
per emiffion, and a difpofition  
to uphold its credit. The far-  
mers appeared willing to ex-  
change their produce for it.  
The merchants, on the other  
  
hand, had large debts dut+  
ftanding. They fuppofed that  
giving a free circulation to the  
paper, would enable their cuf-  
tomers in the country to pay}  
and as they perceived that they  
would have it in their power  
to convert the money into pro-  
duce, they, naturally refolved  
to give it their fupport.  
  
efe caufes combined to  
introduce the money into ge-  
neral circulation ;: and, having  
once obtained credit, it will  
now be able to fupport itfelf.  
  
The chief difficulty to have  
been apprehended in refpect  
to the paper, was, to over-  
come the diffidence which the  
ftill-+recent experience of de-  
preciating paper, had inftilled  
into men’s minds’ This, it was  
to have been feared, would  
have fhaken its credit at its  
outfet ; and, if it had once  
begun to fink, it would have  
been no eafy matter to pre-  
vent its total decline.  
  
The event has, however,  
turned out otherwife : and the  
money has been fortunate  
enough to conciliate the pub-  
lic confidence. This point  
gained, there need be no ap-  
prehenfions for its future fate,  
unlefs the government fliould  
do fomething to deftroy that  
confidence.  
  
The caufes, that firit gave  
it credit, ftill operate ; and  
will in all probability conti-  
nue to do fo. The demand for  
money has not Ieffenecdl : and  
the merchant has {till the  
  
fame.

fame inducement to counte-  
nance the circulation of the  
paper. e  
  
I fhall not deny that the  
outlet which the payment of  
duties furnifhed to the mer-  
chant, was an additional mo-  
tive to the reception of the  
paper. Nor is it propofed to  
take away this motive. There  
is now before this houfe a bill,  
one object of which is, the  
eftablifhment of a ftate-impoft  
on certain enumerated arti-  
cles, in addition to that to be  
ranted to the united ftates,  
t is computed, on very good  
rounds, that the additional  
duties would amount to about  
thirty thoufand pounds: and,  
as they would be payable. in  
paper-currency, they would  
create a fufficient demand  
upon the merchant, to leave  
him, in this refpect, fubftan-  
tially the fame inducement  
which he has now. Indeed,  
independent of this, the rea-  
dinefs of the trading people to  
take the money, can never be  
doubted, while it will freely  
command the commodities of  
  
the country: for this, tq’  
  
them, is the moft important  
ufe they can make of it.  
  
But, befides the ftate-impoft,  
there muft be other taxes: and  
thefe will all contribute to.  
create a demand for the mo-  
ney, which is all we now  
mean, when we talk of funds  
for its fupport: for there are  
none appropriated for the re-  
demption of the paper.  
  
Upon the whole, the addi-  
tional duties will be a compe-.  
tent fubftitute for thofe now  
in exiftence: and the general  
good will of the community  
towards the paper, will be the  
beft fecurity for its credit.  
  
Having now fhewn, mr,  
Chairman, that there is no  
conftitutional impediment to  
the adoptign of the bill---thar  
there is no danger to be ap-  
prehended to the public liber-  
ty, from giving the power in  
queftion to the united ftates--&gt;  
and that, in the view of reves  
nue, the meafure under con  
fideration is not only expe  
dient but neceffary---let us  
turn our attention to the other  
fide of this important fubject :  
let us ask ourfelves, what will  
be the confequence of reject-  
ing the bill? what will be the  
fituation of our national affairs,  
if they are Jeft much longer tq  
float in the chaos, in which  
they are now involved.  
  
Can our national character  
be preferved without paying  
our debts 2 Can the union  
fubfift without revenue ? Have  
we realized the confequences  
which would attend its diffo-  
lution ?  
  
If thefe ftates are not united  
under a federal government,  
they will infallibly have wars  
with each other : and their di-.  
vifions will fubject them to all  
the mifchiefs of foreign in-  
fluence and intrigue. The hus  
man paffions will never want  
objects of hoftility. The wefte  
  
eri  
  
  
  
526  
€rn territory is an obvious  
and fruitful fource of conteft.  
Let us alfo caft our eye upon  
the map of this ftate, inter-  
fected from one extremity to  
the other by a large navigable  
river. In the event of a rup-  
ture with them, what is to hin-  
der our metropolis from be-  
coming a prey to our neigh-  
bours? Is it even fuppofeable  
that they would fuffer it to  
remain the nurfery of wealth  
toa diftin¢t community ?  
  
Thefe fubjects are delicate :  
but it is neceffary to contem-  
ae them, to teach us to  
  
orm a true eftimate of our  
fituation.  
  
Wars with each other would  
beget ftanding  
fource of more real danger to  
our liberties, than all the pow-  
er that could be conferred  
apon the reprefentatives of  
the people. And warts with  
each other would lead to op-  
pofite alliances with foreign  
powers, and plunge us into all  
the labyrinths of European  
politics.
