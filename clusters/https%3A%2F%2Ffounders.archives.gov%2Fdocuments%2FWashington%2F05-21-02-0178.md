rawn from her an Acknowledgement of a desire to return before she knew I was authorized to send her back. It was  
  
the circumstance of her Acquaintence discovering her intention that defeated it.  
I will now Sir agreeably to your desire send her to Alexandria if it be practicable without the consequences which you except—that of exciting a riot or a mob—or creating uneasy sensations in the mind of well disposed Citizens—the first cannot be calculated before hand—it will be governed by the popular opinion of the moment—or the circumstances that may arise in the transaction, The latter may be sought into and judged of by conversing with such persons without discovering the Occasion—so far as I have had opportunity I perceive that different sentiments are entertained on this subject.
