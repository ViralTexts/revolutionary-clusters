le, as to threaten not only a famine, but a civil comotion; which has evinced itself lately, by numbers being robbed, and assassinated near the City. (Grain is at this moment 150. Piastres the Caffice—the general price 50). As yet no measures have been taken by the Government to calm the clamou⟨rs⟩ of the People. We are still left in the field of conjecture as to the real intentions of Russia &amp; the Grand Signior, with respect to Barbary; but most combine in the opinion, that an unpleasant visit will be made to the different Regencies, should not the comotions of Europe draw their attention from the first object.

On the 26th. ultimo, one Ship of the line and three frigates, entered the road of the Gouletta, shewing English Colours; (most of the Corsairs were ready for Sea, and anchored at a considerable distance from the Batteries) a frigate laid along aside of the Tunisien frigate, and commenced the attack by a general discharge of Musketry, shewing at the same time the Neapolitan flag; some of the Tunisiens on board the frigate instantly cut her Cables, while others endeavoured to make their escape by Swimming to the shore: the Tunisien frigate, drifted under the forts, receiving without any resistance, the full force of the enemy’s great Guns. She was completly equipped and ready for Sea; nine of her Crew were killed, about twenty wounded, and an equal number of Prisoners made, which were taken up by the boats of the Neapolitans: she is considerably damaged in her hull, has two shot between wind &amp; water, and her foremast, somewhat injured. There were no Soldiers in the forts, except a few moors, who were not Sufficient to man half a dozen Guns—they notwithstanding kept up a tolerable brisk fire for nearly two hours after the Neapolitans had ceased, &amp; untill they stood out of the roadsted.
