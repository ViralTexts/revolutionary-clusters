Sir  
Boston 13th August 1775.  
  
To the Glory of Civilized Nations, humanity and War have been compatible; and Compassion to the subdued, is become almost a general system.  
Britons, ever preeminent in Mercy, have outgone common examples, and overlooked the Criminal in the Captive. Upon these principles your Prisoners, whose Lives by the Laws of the  
  
Land are destined to the Cord, have hitherto been treated with care and kindness, and more comfortably lodged then the King’s Troops in the Hospitals, indiscriminately it is true, for I Acknowledge no Rank that is not derived from the King.  
My intelligence from your Army would justify severe recrimination. I understand there are of the King’s faithfull Subjects, taken sometime since by the Rebels, labouring like Negro Slaves, to gain their daily Subsistence, or reduced to the Wretched Alternative, to perish by famine, or take Arms against their King and Country. Those who have made the Treatment of the Prisoners in my hands, or of your other Friends in Boston, a pretence for such Measures, found Barbarity upon falsehood.  
I would willingly hope Sir, that the Sentiments of liberality, which I have always believed you to possess, will be exerted to correct these misdoings. Be temperate in political disquisition, give free Operation to truth, and punish those who decieve and misrepresent, and not only the effects, but the Causes of this unhappy Conflict will be removed.  
Should those under whose usurped Authority you Act, controul such a disposition, and dare to call severity retaliation, to God who knows all hearts be the appeal for the dreadfull consequences. I trust that British Soldiers Asserting the rights of the State, the Laws of the Land, the being of the Constitution, will meet all Events with becoming fortitude. They will court Victory with the Spirit their cause inspires, and from the same Motive will find the patience of Martyrs under misfortune.  
Till I read your insinuations in regard to Ministers, I concieved that I had acted under the King: Whose wishes, it is true, as well as those of his Ministers, and of every honest Man have been to see this unhappy Breach forever closed, but unfortunately for both Countrys, those who long since projected the present Crisis, and influence the Councils of America, have views very distant from Accomodation. I am, Sir, Your most Obedient humble Servant  
  
Thos Gage

Dos ion, August 13, 17&quot;. r ).  
  
BUM To the glory of civilized nations, hu-  
manilv aud war have been compatible, and  
compassion to the sul&#x27;dued is heOOBM id-  
most a general system.  
  
Hritons, ever pre-eminent in mercy, have  
outgone common examples, and overlooked  
the criminal in the captive. Upon theat  
principles your prisoners, whose lives by  
the laws of the land are destined to the cord,  
have hitherto been treated with care and  
kindness, and more comfortably lodged  
than the King&#x27;s troops in the hospitals; in-  
discriminately, it is true, for I acknowledge  
no rank that is not derived from the King.  
  
My intelligence from your armv would  
justify severe recrimination. I understand  
  
there are of the lUng&#x27;s faithful subjects,  
  
taken some time since by tho rebels, labor-  
ing like negro slaves to gain their daily  
sutiMstence, or reduced to the wret&#x27; hed al-  
ternative to perish by famine or take arms  
against their King and country. Those  
who have made the treatment of the prison-  
ers in my hands or of your other fri- nds in  
I lost on a pretence for such measures found  
barbarity rpon falsehood.  
  
1 would willingly hope, sir, that the sen-  
timents of liberality, which 1 have always  
believed you to possess, will be exerted to  
correct these misdoings. Be temperate in  
political disquisition, give free operation to  
truth, and punish those who deceive and  
misrepresent, and not only tho effects but  
the causes of this unhappy conflict will be  
removed.  
  
Should those under w hose usurped au-  
thority you act control such a disposition,  
and can to call severity retaliation, tottod,  
who knows dU hearts, be the appeal for the  
dreadful consequences. I trust thai Rritish  
soldiers, affecting the rights of the State,  
the laws of the laud, the being of the con  
stitution, will meet all events with becom-  
ing fortitude. They will court victory a ith  
the spirit their cause inspires, and from the  
same motive will Bad the patience of mar-  
tyrs under misfortune.  
  
Till 1 read your insinuation in regard to  
minister- 1 , I conceive that 1 hail acted un-  
der l he King, whose wishes, it is true, as  
well as those of his ministers, aud of everv  
honesi man, hate been to see this unhappy  
breach fore\er closed: but unfortunately  
for both countries, those who long I nee  
projected the present cri-is, and taaoeao d  
tho councils of America, have proved very  
distant from aceommodation.  
  
I am, sir, your most obedient
