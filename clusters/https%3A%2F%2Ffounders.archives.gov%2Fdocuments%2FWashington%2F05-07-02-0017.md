r George,  
Philadelphia December 5th 1790  
  
Agreeably to the promise which I gave to you in Virginia, I have made the necessary enquiries respecting the course of studies and expences, which would enable you and your Brother  
  
Lawrence to finish your education at the college in this place, provided you are Masters of those books and studies, which you informed me you had passed through.  
The enclosed account of studies and expences, which I wish you to return to me, you will see is under the hand of the reverend Dr Smith Provost of the College, and may therefore be relied upon for its accuracy—After you and Laurence have carefully perused and well considered the enclosed statement, I wish you to determine whether you will come or not—If your determination should be in favor of coming on, I must impress this upon you both in the strongest manner viz.—That you come with good dispositions and full resolutions to pursue your studies closely, conform to the established rules and customs of the College—and to conduct yourselves, on all occasions, with decency and propriety.  
To you, George, I would more particularly address myself at this time, as from your advanced age it may be presumed that such advice as I am about to give will make a deeper impression upon you than upon your Brother, and your conduct may very probably mark the line of his; But, at the same time Laurence must remember that this is equally applicable to him.  
Should you enter upon the course of studies here marked out you must consider it as the finishing of your education, and, therefore, as the time is limited, that every hour mispent is lost forever—and that future years cannot compensate for lost days at this period of your life. This reflection must shew the nessity of an unremitting application to your studies. To point out the importance of circumspection in your conduct, it may be proper to observe that a good moral character is the first essential in a man, and that the habits contracted at your age are generally indelible, and your conduct here may stamp your character through life. It is therefore highly important that you should endeavor not only to be learned but virtuous. Much more might be added to shew the necessity of application and regularity, but, when you must know that without them, you can never be qualified to render service to your country, assistance to your friends, or consolation to your retired moments, nothing further need be said to prove their utility.  
As to your clothing, it will, I presume, cost much the same here as in Alexandria—I shall always wish to see you clothed  
  
decently and becoming your stations; but I shall ever discountenance extravagance or foppishness in your dress. At all times, and upon all occasions I shall be happy to give you both such marks of my approbation, as your progress and good conduct merit.  
If you determine to come on, you had better do it immediately, and Major Washington will furnish you with such money as may be necessary for the Stage and expences from Alexandria to this place.  
But I must repeat what I have before enjoined, That you come with good dispositions and determined resolutions to conform to establishments and pursue your studies.  
Your Aunt joins me in love to you both, and best wishes to Dr Craik and family. I am dear George, your sincere friend and affectionate Uncle.

Philadelphia Dec. 5, 1790.  
DeTTr George—Vgreeahlv to the promise  
which I gave you in Virginia, I have made tin  
necessary inquiries respecting the course ot  
studies and expenses which would enable you  
and your brother Lawrence tojjnish your ed­  
ucation at the college in this place, provided  
you are masters of those books and studies  
which you inlbrmed me you had passed  
through.  
The enclosed account of studies and expen­  
ses. winch l wish you to return to me, you will  
see is under the hand oft he Rev. Dr. Smith, Pro­  
vost of the College, and may thereibre be relied  
: on for its accuracy. After you and Lawrence  
have carefully perused and well considered  
the enclosed statement. I wish you to deter­  
mine whether you will curneornot. If your  
determination should he in favor ot coming on,  
1 must impress this upon both in the strongest  
manner, namely, that you come with good  
dispositions and full resolution to pursue your  
studies closely, to conform to the established  
rules and customs of the college, and to con­  
duct yourselves,on ail occasions, with decen­  
!cy and propriety.  
To you Geroge, I would more particularlyad­  
dress myself at this time, as from your advan­  
ced age, it may be presumed that such advice  
as I am about to give will make a deeper im­  
pression upon you than upon vour brother, and  
vour conduct may V*erv probably mark die  
line of ins; bur, at the-same time, Lawrence  
| must remember that this is equally applicable  
, to him.  
Should von enter upon the course of studies  
here marked out, you must consider it as the  
finishing of vour education; and therefore, as  
the time is limited, that every hour mispent is  
os? for e\&lt; . :»rd that future years cannot  
compensate for lost dais at this period ofyour  
, \ I is reflection must show the necessity  
of in unremitting application to your studies.  
To jVint out the importance ol circumspection  
vour o-mdocL it may he proper to observe  
that a cood moral character is the first essen­  
tia1 in a man, and that the habits contracted  
at vour ace arc generally indelible, and your  
conduct here mav stamp vour character through  
life. It is therefore highly important that you  
should endeavor not only to he learned, but  
virtuous. Much more might he said to show  
the necessityofa spplicationand regularity; but  
since you must know that without them you  
lean never be qualified to render service to  
| your country, assistance to your friends,  
or enjoy consolation in your retired mo­  
ments, nothing further may be said to prove  
their utility.  
As to voi r clothing,it will, I presume, cost  
much the same here as in Alexandria. I  
shall always wish to see you clothed decently,  
and becoming your stations; brit I shall ever  
discountenance extravagance or foppishness  
in your dress. At all times, and upon all oc­  
casions, I shall be happy to give you both such  
marks of my approbation as your progress and  
good conduct merit.  
If you determine to come on, you had better  
do it immediately; and Major Washington  
will furnish you with such money as may be  
necessary for the stage and expenses from Al­  
exandria to this place. But I must repeat  
what I have before enjoined, that you come  
with good dispositions, and determine]
