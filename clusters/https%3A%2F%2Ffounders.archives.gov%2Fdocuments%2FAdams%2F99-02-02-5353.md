Sirs,  
					Quincy, May 2, 1809.  
				  
				THE message mentioned in my last letter, was in these words:Gentlemen of the Senate,The proposition of a fresh negociation with France,  
in consequence of advances made by the French government, has excited so general an attention and so much  
conversation, as to have given occasion to many manifestations of the public opinion, from which it appears to  
me, that a new modification of the embassy will give more  
general satisfaction to the legislature and to the nation,  
and perhaps better answer the purposes we have in view.  
It is on this supposition, and with this expectation, that  
I now nominate Oliver Ellsworth, Esq. Chief Justice of  
the United States, Patrick Henry, Esq. late Governor of  
Virginia, and William Vans Murray, Esq. our Minister  
Resident at the Hague, to be Envoys Extraordinary and  
Ministers Plenipotentiary to the French Republic, with  
full powers to discuss and settle by a treaty all controversies between the United States and France. It is not intended that the two former of these gentlemen shall embark for Europe, until they shall have received from the  
Executive Directory assurances signified by their Secretary of foreign relations, that they shall be received in character, that they shall enjoy all the prerogatives attached to  
that character by the law of nations, and that a minister  
or ministers of equal powers shall be appointed and commissioned to treat with them.  
John Adams.Feb. 25, 1799.To these nominations the Senate advised and consented,  
and commissions were prepared. My friend, Mr. Henry  
declined, on account of his age, and Governor Davie, of  
North-Carolina, was appointed in his place. During all  
this transaction, no motion was made in Senate, to  
pass a resolution that a mission to France was inexpedient.  
With the despatches from Talleyrand before his eyes, I  
believe no member of the Senate would have been willing  
to record his name in favor of such a resolution, among  
the yeas and nays. The deputation of Senators made no  
remonstrances to me against the mission, or the diplomatic  
communications on which it was founded, but only against  
the missionary, Mr. Murray.  
I sent an invitation to the heads of departments to assemble in my chamber, to consult upon the instructions  
to be given to our envoys. They all met me accordingly,  
and in several long evenings entered into a very serious  
and deliberate discussion of every article that was to be  
demanded and insisted on in the proposed treaty. They  
were all unanimously agreed upon to my entire satisfaction,  
and reduced to writing. I committed them to the secretary of state, to be reduced into proper form, to have a  
fair copy made and transmitted to me, for revision, correction or signature, as there might be occasion.  
The yellow fever was expected, and we wert all obliged  
to fly for our lives: myself and all my family to Quincy,  
and the heads of departments, with the public offices, to  
Trenton.  
I had repeatedly endeavored to impress upon the mind  
of the secretary of state, the necessity of transmitting to  
me as soon as possible, his draught of the instructions, that they might be finished and signed, and every thing  
prepared for the departure of the envoys. I waited with  
much concern, expecting from day to day to receive the  
instructions; but no instructions appeared. At length,  
instead of them, I received a letter signed by all five of  
the heads of departments, earnestly entreating me to suspend the mission!  
I was astonished at this unexpected, this obstinate and  
persevering opposition to a measure, that appeared so clearly to me to be so essential to the peace and prosperity of  
the nation, and the honor of the government, at home  
and abroad. I was not a little surprised at the unanimity  
of the heads of departments, for two of them had always  
appeared moderate and candid in relation to this mission.  
My instantaneous determination was to go to Trenton,  
meet the gentlemen face to face, to confer with them  
coolly on the subject, and convince them, or be convinced by them, if I could. On my way, I called upon  
Chief Justice Ellsworth, at his seat in Windsor, and had  
a conversation of perhaps two hours with him. He was  
perfectly candid. Whatever should be the determination,  
he was ready at an hour’s warning to comply. If it was  
thought best to embark immediately, he was ready. If  
it was judged more expedient to postpone it for a little  
time, though that might subject him to a winter voyage,  
that danger had no weight with him. If it was concluded  
to defer it till the spring, he was willing to wait. In this  
disposition I took leave of him. He gave me no intimation that he had any thought of a journey to Trenton. I  
lodged at Hartford, not yet purified of the yellow fever,  
and there I caught something very like it, or at least almost as bad, a most violent cold, attended with a constant  
fever, which rendered me for six weeks more fit for a  
chamber and bed of sickness, than for uncomfortable  
journeys, or much labor of the head or hands. However,  
I would not consent to be retarded on my journey, and  
reached Trenton, where Mr. Hamilton had arrived a few  
hours before me. Governor Davie had been there some  
time. Ill as I was, I sent for the heads of departments. Four of them were there. The attorney general was  
gone to Virginia. Many days were employed in conferences with them, sometimes at my own apartments, and  
sometimes at their offices.  
The inhabitants of Trenton had been wrought up to  
a pitch of political enthusiasm that surprised me. The  
universal opinion appeared to be, that the first arrivals  
from Europe would bring the glorious news, that Louis  
the Eighteenth was restored to the throne of France, and  
reigning triumphantly at Versailles. Suwarrow, at the  
head of his victorious Russian army, was to have marched  
from Italy to Paris, on one side, and Prince Charles, at  
the head of an Austrian army, was to have marched from  
Germany to Paris on the other, and detachments from  
both armies were to march down to Havre, to receive  
the king, who was to be brought over by a British fleet  
and escorted with flying colours to Versailles. I could  
scarcely believe my own senses when I heard such reveries.—Yet the heads of departments appeared to believe them,  
and urge them as decisive arguments for suspending the  
embarkation of our envoys till the spring. In vain did I  
urge the immense distances the two imperial armies had  
to march, the great number of towns and cities in the  
route of both, in positions chosen with great skill, fortified  
with exquisite art, defended by vast trains of heavy ordnance, garrisoned by numerous troops of soldiers perfectly disciplined, and animated with all the obstinacy and  
ardor of the revolutionary spirit. In vain did I alledge  
the military maxim, which would certainly govern both  
Prince Charles and Suwarrow, that is, never to leave a fortified city in the rear of your army, in possession of your enemy. That the siege of one town would consume the  
whole season.—That neither the Russians nor Austrians  
were probably provided with the mortars and heavy cannon necessary for sieges.—Nothing would do—Louis  
XVIII. must be upon the throne of France.—Well, suppose he is, what harm will there be in embarking our envoys? They will congratulate his Majesty, and if his  
Majesty cannot receive them under their credentials to the French Republic, he will be glad to see them in his  
kingdom, and assure them of his royal protection till they  
can write home for fresh commissions, and such shall be  
ready for them at a minute’s warning. In vain did I  
urge the entire change of property in France, and the  
necessity the present possessors were under to defend  
themselves at every sacrifice and every risque. Mr. Ellsworth had arrived in two or three days after me. I invited him and Governor Davie to dine with me alone,  
that we might converse with entire freedom. At table,  
Mr. Ellsworth expressed an opinion somewhat similar to  
that of the heads of departments and the public opinion  
of Trenton. Is it possible, Chief Justice, said I, that you  
can seriously believe that the Bourbons are or will be  
soon restored to the throne of France? Why, said Mr.  
Ellsworth, smiling, it looks a good deal so. I should not  
be afraid to stake my life upon it, that they will not be  
restored in seven years, if they ever are, was my reply.  
And then I entered into a long detail of my reasons for  
this opinion. They would be too tedious to enumerate  
here, and time has superceded the necessity of them.  
The result of the conversation was, that Mr. Davie  
was decidedly for embarking immediately, as he always  
had been from his first arrival, and Mr. Ellsworth declared himself satisfied and willing to embark as soon as I  
pleased.  
Mr. Hamilton, who had been some time in town and  
had visited me several times, came at last to remonstrate  
against the mission to France. I received him with great  
civility, as I always had done from my first knowledge of  
him. I was fortunately in a very happy temper and very  
good humor. He went over the whole ground of the  
victories of Suwarrow and Prince Charles, and the inflexible determination of the two imperial courts, in concert  
with G. Britain, to restore the house of Bourbon to  
their kingdom. That there was no doubt the enterprise  
was already accomplished, or at least it would be, before  
the end of the campaign. That Mr. Pitt was determined  
to restore the Bourbons. That the confidence of the nation in Mr. Pitt was unbounded. That the nation was  
never so united, and determined to support Mr. Pitt and  
his resolution to restore the monarchy of France.—His  
eloquence and vehemence wrought the little man up to a  
degree of heat and effervescence like that which Gen.  
Knox used to describe of his conduct in the battle of Monmouth, and which General Lee used to call his paroxysms  
of bravery, but which he said would never be of any service to his country. I answered him in general, as I had  
answered the heads of departments and Judge Ellsworth—but to no purpose. He repeated over and over again the  
unalterable resolution of Mr. Pitt and the two imperial  
courts, the invincible heroism os Suwarrow and Prince  
Charles, and the unbounded confidence of the British  
empire in Mr. Pitt, with such agitation and violent action,  
that I really pitied him, instead of being displeased. I only added, that I differed with him in opinion on every  
point, and that instead of restoring the Bourbons, it  
would not be long before England would make peace.  
I treated him throughout with great mildness and civility;  
but after he took leave, I could not help reflecting in my  
own mind on the total ignorance he had betrayed of every thing in Europe, in France, England, and elsewhere.  
Instead of that unbounded confidence in Mr. Pitt, I knew  
that the nation had been long working up almost to a  
ripeness for rebellion against Mr. Pitt, for continuing the  
war. Accordingly it was not long before Mr. Pitt was  
obliged to resign, peace at Amiens was made, and Napoleon acknowledged. Mr. Hamilton in his most famous  
pamphlet, has hinted at this conversation, and squinted at  
my simplicity for expecting peace.  
Upon the whole, I directed the instructions to be prepared, the heads of departments were assembled, and the  
instructions deliberately considered, paragraph by paragraph, and unanimously approved by me and by them.  
Indeed there had never been any difference of opinion  
among us on any article of the instructions.  
The instructions were presented to the envoys, and  
they requested to embark in the United States frigate as soon as possible.—For some cause or other in the state of  
the ship, they landed in Spain, and went by land from  
Corunna to Paris on the same route which Mr. Dana and  
I had travelled twenty years before, that is, in 1780. Before their arrival, a revolution had occurred, and the  
Consular government succeeded the Directory.Had Mr. Murray’s nomination been approved, he  
would probably have finished the business long before,  
and obtained compensation for all spoliations.

CO R R ESf?() N DEN C E CONTINU ED.  
To the Printers of the Boston Patriot.  
Sirs,  
The message mentioned in my last let­  
ter was in these words:  
Gentlemen of the Senate,  
The proposition of a fresh negotiation  
with trance, .in consequence of advances  
made by the French government has ex­  
cited so general an attention and so much  
conversation, as to have given occasion to  
many manifestations of the public opinion  
from which it appears to me. that a new  
modification of tiie embassy will give more  
general satisfaction to the legislature a&#x27;hd  
to the nation, and perhaps better answer the  
purposes wo have in view. It is on this sup­  
position, and with this expectation, that I  
now nominate Oliver Ellsworth Esq. Chief  
Justice of the United States, Patrick Hen­  
ry Esquire, late Governor of Virginia, arid  
Willliam Vans Murray, Esquire, our Mi­  
nister Resident at the Hague, to Ire Envoys  
Extraordinary, and Ministers Plenipotentia­  
ry Ui the French Republic, with full powers  
to discuss and settie by treaty all contro­  
versies between the U States and Fance.  
—It is not intended that the two former of  
these gentlemen shall embark for Europe,  
until t.iev shall have received from the Ex  
ecuttve Directory assurances sigiiiiied by  
their Secretary of foreign relations, that thev  
shall be received in character, that they shall  
enjoy all the prerogatives attached to that  
character by the law of nations, and that a  
minister or ministers of equal powers shall  
be appointed and commissioned to treat with  
them.  
JOHN ADAMS.  
Feb. 25, 1799.  
To these nominations the Senate advised  
and consented, and commissions were pre­  
pared. Mv triend Mr. Henry declined, on  
account of his age, and Governor Davie, of  
North C arolina, was appointed in his place.  
During all/his transaction, no motion was  
made in Senate, to pass a resolution that a  
mission to France was expedient. With the  
dispatches from 1 alley rand before his eves,  
I believe no member of the Senate would  
have been willing to record his name in fa­  
vor of such a resolution, among the veas and  
nays. The deputation of Senators made no  
remonstrances to me against the mission or  
the diplomatic communications on which it  
was founded, but only against the missiona­  
  
• wir. murray.  
i sent an invitation to the heads of depart  
meats to assemble in my chamber, to consult  
upon tile instructions to be given to our en­  
voys. I hey all met me accordingly, 8c in se­  
veral long evenings entered intoa very serious  
and deliberate discussion of every article that  
was to be demanded and insisted ®n in the  
proposed treaty. 1 liev were all unanimous­  
ly agreed upon to my entire satisfaction, and  
reduced to writing. I committed them to  
the secretary of state, to be reduced into pro­  
perforin, to have a fair copy made and trans­  
mitted to me. for revision, correction or sig­  
nature, as there might be occasion.  
The yellow fever was expected, and we  
were all obliged to fly for our lives: myself &amp;  
all my family to Quincy, and the heads of  
departments, with the public offices, to Tren­  
ton.  
I had repeatedly endeavored to impress  
upon the mind of the Secretary of State-, the  
necessity of transmitting to me as soon as  
possible, his draught of the instructions, that  
they might be finished and signed, and eve­  
ry thing prepared for the departure of the  
envoys. I waited with much concern, ex­  
pecting from day to day, to receive tlie in­  
structions ; but no instructions appeared._  
At length, instead ot them, 1 received a let­  
ter signed by all five of the heads ot depart­  
ments, earnestly entreating me to susfiend  
the mission.  
  
i was astonished at this unexpected, this  
obstinate and persevering oppasition to a  
measure, that appeared so clearly to me  
to he so essential to the peace and pros­  
perity of the nation, and the honour of the  
government at home and abroad. I was  
not a little stirpt ised at the unanimity of the  
heads ol departments, For two of them had  
always appeared moderate &amp; candid in real  
rion o this mission. My instantaneous deter­  
mination was togo to Trenton, meet the gen­  
tlemen face to face, to confer with them cool­  
ly on the subject, and convince them, or be  
convinced by them, if I could. On my way  
I cal led upon ( hiet Justice Ellsworth, at his  
seat in Windsor, and had a conversation of  
perhaps two hours with him. He was per­  
fectly candid. Whatever should be the de­  
termination, lie was ready at an hour’s war­  
ning to comply. If It was thought best to em­  
bark immediately, he was ready. It it was  
judged more expedient to postpone it for n  
little time, though&#x27;that might subject him to  
a winter voyage, that danger had no weight  
with him. If it was concluded to defer it till  
the spring, he was willing to wait. In this  
disposition I took leave of him. He gave me  
no intimation that he had anv thought of a  
journey to Trenton. I lodged at Hartford,  
not yet purified of the yellow fever, aiul  
there 1 caught something very like it, or at  
least almost as bad, a most violent Cold, at­  
tended with a constant fever, which render­  
ed me for six weeks more fit for a chamber  
and a bed of sickness, than for uncomfnrta­  
Me journeys, or. much labor of the head or  
hands. However, I would not consent to be  
retarded on my journey, and reached Tren­  
ton, where Mr. Hamilton had arrived a lew  
hours before me. Governor Davie had been  
there some time. Ill as I was, I sent for the.  
beads ol departments. Four of them were  
there.. i lie attorney general was gone to  
V irginia. Many days were employed in con­  
ferences with them, sometimes at my own  
apartments, anti sometimes at their offices.  
I lie inhabitants of Trenton had been  
wrought up to a pitch of political enthusiasm  
that surprised me. The universal opinion  
appeared to be, that the first arrivals from  
Europe would bring tlie glorious news, that  
Louis the Eighteenth was restored to the  
throne of F rance, and reigning triumphant­  
ly at V crsailles. Stiwarrow.at the head of  
his victorious Itussian army, was to have  
marched from Italy to Paris, on 01 e side,  
ami Prince Charles, at the head of an Aus­  
trian army, was to have marched from Ger­  
many to Paris on the other, and detach­  
ments from both armies were to march down  
to Havre, to receive the king, who was to  
be brought over by a British licet and escort­  
fed with fi&gt; ing colours to Versailles. I could  
scarcely believe my own senses, when I  
beard such reveries. Vet the heads of de­  
partment# appeared to believe them, and  
irgr them as decisive arguments for suspeud­  
ng the embarkation of our envoys till the  
spring. In vain did I urge the immense dis­  
,«ncns the two Imperial armies had :• march,  
  
)erof towns and cities in the  
n positions chosen with great  
fitli exquisite art, defended  
M heavy ordnance garrisoned  
a sips &#x27;of soldiers perfectly di&gt;­  
.uiitTated witli all the &lt;‘.stint  
i the revolutionary spirit, in  
Ige the military maxim, which  
Y govern both Prince Charles  
and Suwarrow, that is, never to leave u fbr­  
tified city tr the rear &lt;f i/our army, in&#x27;/ton­  
session of your tunny. That the siege of  
one town would consume the whole season-,  
l hat neither the Russians nor Austrians  
were probably provided with the mortars  
and heavy cannon necessary for sieges. No  
thing would dot—Louis X\ HI. must lie upon  
the throne of France—Well, suppose he is,  
what harm will there be in enmarking our  
Envoys? They will congratulate his ma  
jtsty, audit hit majesty cannot receive them  
under their cnklentiais to thy French Re­  
public, he will be glad to see them in his  
Kingdom, and issure them of Ids royal pro­  
tection till the) can write home for fresh  
commissions, and such shall be ready for  
them at a min|Ue’s warning. In \ain did I  
ui ge the entire change of property in France  
and the necestity ihe present possessors  
weic under to (.efend themselves at eve­  
ry sacrifice and every risque. Mr. Ells­  
worth had arrned in two or three day s  
atter me. I invited him and Governor Da­  
vie to dine with me alone, that we might  
converse with entire freedom. At table. Mr.  
Ed-worth exptesed an opinion somewhat  
similar to that of he heads of departments  
and the public opjnion of Trenton. Is it pos I  
sible, Chiei Justice, said I, that you cause ■  
riously beiive that the bourbons are or will  
be soon restored :o the throne of France?  
&#x27;V hy, said Mr. Ellsworth, si idling ii look s  
\&lt;i ffosd dral so. I should not be afraid to  
stake my dfe upon it, that they will not be  
restored in seven years, if they ever are  
was my repry. And then I entered into a  
long detail of my reasons for this opinion.  
: 1 hey would be two tedious toe umeratc hei e,  
I and time has superceded the necessity of  
them.  
1 lie result of thr conversation was, that  
Mi. Davie wtis decidedly for embarking im­  
mediately, as lie alvays bad been trom Ins  
lust arrival, and Mr. Fu.-vorth declared  
I himself satisfied and willing to embark a I

Mr. Hamilton, who had been some time  
in town a&gt;ul had vhited me several times,  
came at last to remonstrate against the mis  
sirtn to France I revive d him with ere at

nut Mr. Pitt was drlerunned to restore»lie  
Bourbons. Tnat the confidence of the na­  
tion in Mr. Pitt was unbounded. That the  
nation was never so united, and determined  
to support Mr. Pitt and ids resolution to res­  
tore the monarchy of France. His eloquence  
and vehemence wrought the little man up to  
a degree of heat and effervescence, like that  
which General Knox used to describe of his  
conduct in the battle of Monmouth, and  
which General Lee usied to call his flarox  
tjHmsoi bravery, but which he said would  
never be of any service to his country. 1  
answered him m general, as I had answer­  
ed the heads of departments and Judge El $  
worth but to ho purpose. He repeated o­  
T;?nt&#x27;rver ;lSain lhe unalterable resolution  
of Mr. Pitt and the two Imperial courts,  
the invincible heroism of Suwarrow and  
Prince Charles, and the unbounded confi­  
dence of the British empire in Mr Pitt,  
with such agitation and iiolent action, that  
* J’cally pitied him, instead of being uisplea*­  
ed I on y added, that I differed with him  
in op. in on on ever&gt; point, and that instead of  
restoring the Bourbons, it would not be lot g  
before England would male peace. I treat  
edhim throughout with gteat mildness and  
  
; , will «tuci lie iook lease. I could not  
help reflecting, in m&gt; own mind, on rlie to  
1 tal ignorance lie had betrayed o. every tiling  
in Europe in France Engand &amp; elsewhere. ;  
Instead of that unbounded confidence in Mr  
! » ut, i knew that the nation had been long  
working up, almost to a ripeness for rehe.li  
on, against*Mr. I’itt, for continuing the war.  
Accordingly it was not long before Mr Pitt  
was obliged to resign; peace at Amiens was  
made and Napoleon acknowledged. Mr  
Hamilton, in his most famous pamphlet has  
hinted at this conversation, and squinted ut  
my simplicity for expecting peace.  
Upon the whole, I directed the instructi­  
ons lobe prepared, the heads of departments  
were assembled and the instructions deliber­  
ately considered, paragraph by paragraph,  
and unanimously approved bj me and by  
them. Indeed there had never been any  
! difteience of opinion among us* on any arti­  
cle of the instructions.  
The instructions were presented to the  
Envoys, and they requested to embark in  
the united State*’ frigate as soon as possible  
tor some cause or other in the state of Un­  
ship they landed in Spain, and went bv  
land from Corunna to Paris, on the same  
route which Mr. Dana and I had travelled  
twenty years before, that is, in 1780. Betore  
then arrival, a revolution had occurred,  
and the Consular government succeeded the  
Directory.  
Had Mr. Murray’s nomination been appro­  
ved, he would probably are finished the bit  
Kirn ss long before, anti ob&#x27;ained compensa­  
tion for all spoliations.

.- SIRS, _ &#x27; ~  
&quot; THE meflage mentioned in my  
laltletter, was in these words :  
-~ Gentlemen of the Senate, -  
~ The proposition of a frefh negocia­  
tion with France, in confzquence of  
advances made by the French gov­  
ernment, has excited so gener:l an  
attention and so much conversation,  
as to have given occasion to many  
manifélations of the public opinion,  
from which /it appears to me, that a  
new modification of the embafly will  
give more general fatisfaétion to the  
legiflsture and to the nation, and per­  
‘haps better anf{wer the purposes we  
‘have in view. It is on this {uppofi­  
tion, and with this expe&amp;ation, that 1  
_now nominate Oliver Ellsworth, Eq.  
Chief Jußice of the United States,  
Patrick Henry, Esq. late Governor  
‘offVixgigia\,: and William Vans Mar­  
ray, Elg our Minister resident at the  
Hague, to be Eavoys Estraordinary  
and Ministers Plg:_pipatgmiasy to the  
French Republic, with full powets to  
&quot; discuss and fettle by a treaty all con.  
_troverfies berween the United States  
“and Francé. It is not intended that  
‘the two former of these gentlemen  
shall embark for Europe, until they  
shall have received fiom the Executive  
Dire@ory assurances fignified by their  
Seckétary of forcign relations, that  
ithey [hall be feteived in.charadter,  
that they shall enjoy all the preroga­  
ok iof bRI powEte B  
Sae OGt e  
  
[Two DoLLS. PEr ANNUM.]  
  
To these nominations the Senate  
advised and consented, and commis­  
sions were prepared. . My friend ‘Mr.  
Henry declined, on account of his  
age, and Governor Davie, of North-  
Carolina, was appointed in his place.  
During all this tranfa&amp;ion, no motion  
was made in Senate, to pass a resolu­  
tion that a mission to France was in­  
expedient. /% With the defpatches from  
Talleyrand before his eyes, I believe  
no member of the Senate would have  
been willing to record his name in  
favor of fiich a resolution, among the  
yeas and nays. The deputation of  
Senators made no remonfirance to me  
against the mission, or the diplomatic  
communications on which it was  
founded, but only again@ the mission.  
ary, Mr. Murray. g  
I sent an invitation to the heads of  
departments to assemble in my cham­  
ber, to consult upon the inftru&amp;ions  
to-be given to ou! envoys. They all  
met me accordingly, and in several  
long evenings entered into a very fe­  
ricus and deliberate discussion of eve­  
ry article that was to be demanded  
and infilted on in the proposed treaty.  
They were all unapimoufly agreed  
Upon to my entire {atisfaétion, and re­  
duced to writing. 1 committed them  
to the secretary of state, to be reduced  
into preper form, to have a fair copy  
made and tran{initted to me, for re­  
vision, corre&amp;ion or fignagure, as there  
might be occasion.  
- The yellow fever was expe@ed, and  
we were all obliged to fly for our  
lives : myfeif and all my family to  
Qnincy, and the heads of departments;  
with the public offices, to Trenton.  
I had repeatedly endeavored to im­  
press upss the mind of the secretary  
of state, the neceflity of tran{mitting  
to me as soon as poflible, his draught  
of the infiro&amp;ions, that they might  
be finifhed and signed, and every  
thing prepared for the departure of  
the envoys. 1 waited with much con.  
cern, expe&amp;ing from day to day to  
receive the inftruétions ; bit no ine  
Rruétions appeared. At length, in­  
stead of them, [ received aletter sign­  
ed by all five of the heads of depart­  
ments, earnestly entreating me to  
suspend the miffiin !  
- I was altonifhed at this unexpe&amp;sd,  
this obstinate and persevering opposi­  
tion to a measure, that appeared so  
clearly to me to be so essential to the  
peace and prosperity of the nation;  
and the honor of the government, as  
home and abroad. I was not alittle  
surprised at the unanimity of the heads  
of departments, for two of them had  
always appeared moderate and can­  
did in telation t 6 this mifion. My  
instantaneous determination was to go.  
to Trenton, meet the gentlemen face  
to face, to confer with them coolly o  
the fubje&amp;, and convince them, or he  
convinced by them, if I cculd. On’  
my way, I called dpon Chief Jultice  
Ellsworth, at his feat in Windi&#x27; r, and  
had a conversation of perhaps two  
hours with him. He was perfe&amp;iy  
candid. { Whatever fthould be ihe de­  
termination, he was rea.&#x27;v at an hour’s  
warning to comply. it wasthoopht  
belt to embark immediate!?, he was  
ready. &quot;If it was juiged more ezpe­  
dient to poltpone it for a litie time,  
thodgh that might fubjeft bir: to 2  
winter voyage, that danger had no  
weight with him. If it was conciad­  
ed to defer it till the spring, he was  
‘willing to wait. Ino this difpafition I  
took leave of him. He gave me no  
intimation that &quot; he had any .thought  
of a journey to Trenton. I lodged  
at Hartford; not yet purified of the  
vellow fever, and there I caught  
something very like it, or at lealt al­  
‘miolt as bad, a molt violent cold, at­  
tended with a conflant fever, which  
‘rendered me for fix weeks more fit  
for a chamber and 2 bed of sickness,  
‘than for .uncomfortable journeys. or

o s the E j§s tm nth was restored to  
the throne of France,, and reigning -  
triumphantly -at Versailles, Suwar-  
Tow, at the head of his. viQorious  
“Ruflian army, was to have marched.  
from Itzl:g‘tp Paris, on one fide, and  
Prince Charles, at the head of an  
Austrian army, was to have marched  
from Germany to Paris on the other, 1  
and detachments from both armies  
were to march down to Havre, to re- I  
ceive the king, who was to be brought |  
over by a §ritiﬂx fleet. and escorted  
with * fiying colours to Versailles. T  
could scarcely believe my own senses  
when I heard such reveries.— Yet the  
heads of departments appeared to. be­  
lieve them, and urge them as*decifive  
arguments for suspending the embar­  
kation of our envoys, till the {pring.  
In vain did 1 erge the immense dis­  
tances the two imperial atrmies had to’  
march,the great number of towns and  
cities in the route of both, in positions  
chosen with great {kill, fortified with  
exquisite art, defended by wvalt trains  
of heavy ordnance, garrisoned by na- i  
merous troops of soldiers perfectly dis­  
ciplined, and animated with all tha  
obstinacy and ardor of the revolution­  
ary {pirit. In vain did I alledge the  
military maxim, which would certain­  
}y govern both Prince Charles and  
Suwarrow, that is, z#ever so keave a for- |  
tified city &quot;in the rear of your army, in 1  
pooffion of your emerzy. That the siege  
of one town would consume the whole  
season. That neither the Ruflians  
nor Aufltrians were probably provided  
-with the mortars and heavy cannon  
necefliry for fiezes. Nothing would  
do—Louis XVIII. must be upon the  
throne of France.—Well, suppose he  
is, what harm will there bz in em­  
barking our, envoys 2 They will con.-  
gratulate his Majelty, and if his Ma­  
jelty cannot receive them under their  
credentials to the French Kepublic, -  
he will be glad to fee them in his  
kingdom, and aflure them of his roy- |  
al proteétion till they can write home  
for freth commiflions, and such shall  
be ready for them at a minute’s warn­  
ing. ln vain did I urge’ the entire  
change of property in France, and the  
necefiicy the present possessors were­  
under to cdefend themselves at every  
{acrifice and every rifque. Mr. Ells  
worth had arrived &quot;in two or three  
days after me. &#x27; I invited him and  
Governor Davie to dine with me a.  
lone, that we might converse with en­  
tire freedom. At table, Mr. Elifworth  
exprefied an opinion somewhat fimi-  
Far to that of the heads of departments  
aud the publie opinion of Trenton.—  
Is &amp; poflible, Chief Jußice, said I, that  
~ you can seriously believe that the  
Bourbons are or will be {foon restored  
to the throne of France ? Why, said  
Mr. Ellsworth, smiling, it loks a good  
deal so. 1 should not be afraid to stake  
my life upon it, that they will not be .  
restored in seven years, if they ever  
are, was my reply. And then I en­  
tered into a long detail of my reasons  
for this opinion. They would be too  
tedious to enumerate here, and time  
has fuperceded the necessity of them. .  
The result of the conversation was,  
that Mr. Davie was decidedly for  
embarking immediately, as he always  
had been from his firft arrival, and  
Mr. Ellsworth declared himf{e!f fatis­  
fied and willing to embark as {oon as.  
1 pleased. . ‘  
Mr. Hamilton, who had been some  
time in town and had visited me fev.  
eral times, came at last to remonstrate  
againf the mission to France. 1 re­  
ceived him ?(h great civility, as I  
always had done from my firft knowl- 1  
edge of him. I was fortunately in a  
very happy temper and very good hu.  
mor. He went over the ‘whole  
- S e 1  
ground of the vitories of Suwarrow  
and Prince Charles, and the inflexible  
determination of the two imperial  
courts, in concert with G. Britain, to  
restore the houle of - Boutbon to their  
kingdom. That thére was no doubt  
the enterprise was already accomplish­  
ed, or at least it would be, before the  
end of the camipaign! - That Mr. Pitt .  
‘ lv::; dct%g::nca to reﬁ&amp;)re the Bour.  
ns. That the confidence of the  
nation in Mr. Pitt was un&amp;%ﬁ’ed-—a  
That the nation was never so united,  
and determined to support Mr. Pitt  
and his resolution to restore the mon­  
. -archy of France. His ¢loquence and  
vehemence wrought the little man up  
to a degree of heat and effervefcence  
like that which Gen. Znox used to  
defcribg of his condué in the battle of  
Monmouth, -and which G:neral Lze  
‘afed to sl his paroxy/ms of bravery,  
‘buc which he said would negghbe of  
“any service to his country. . .’f“’ﬂ? I  
“ed him in general, as [ had #Mwerad

long before England would make  
peace. 1 treated him throughont  
with great mildness and civility ; but  
after he took leave, I could not help -  
refla@ing in my own mind on the to­  
tal ignorance he had betrayed of éve­  
ry thing in Eusope, in France, Eng:  
land and elsewhere. Instead of that  
unbouaded confidence in Mr. Pitt, I  
knew that the nation had been long  
working up almost to a ripeness for  
rebellion against Mr. Pitt, for contin­  
uing the wir. Accordingly it was  
%ot long before Mr. Pitt was obliged  
torefign, peace at Amens was ‘made,  
and Napoleon acknowledged. Mr.  
Hamilton in his most famcus pam­  
phlet, has hinted at this conversation,  
and {quinted at my simplicity for ex­  
pedting peace.  
Upon the whole, I dire@ed the in­  
ftrudtions to be prepared, the heads of  
depariments were assembled, and the  
inftru@ions deliberately considered,  
paragraph by paragraph, and unani­  
mously approved by me and by them.  
Indeed there had never been any dif­  
ference of opinion arhong us on any  
article of the inftruions.  
The infiructions were presented to  
the envoys, and.they requeited to em­  
bark in the United States frigate as  
soon as possible—For some cause or.  
other in the state of the ship, they lan.  
ded in Spain, and went by land fiom  
Corunna to Paris on the fame route  
which Mr. Dana and I hadtravelled  
twenty, years before, that is, in 1780,  
Before their arrival, a revolution had  
occurred, and the Consular govern-.  
ment succeeded the Dire®ory.  
Had Mr. Murray’s nomination  
been approved, he would probably  
have finifhed the business long before,  
and obtained compensation for all  
spoliations. - 5

JHE message mentioned imy last lets  
tor, was in these, words : i  
38 I;}Mt‘tcr{:cn“qf‘ the Senare,  
  
The proposition of a fresh negotiation wigh  
France, in consequence of advances made by  
the French government, has excited so gen­  
eral an attention and so much conversaticn,  
as to have given occasion to many manifesta­  
tions of the publick opinion, from which if  
appears to me, that a new modification of the  
embassy will give more general satisfaction  
to the legislature and to the nation, and per=  
haps better answer the purpvses we have in  
view. It is on this supposition, and with this  
expectation, that [ pow neminate Oliver Ells­  
worth, Esq. Chief Justce of the U. States,  
Patrick Henry, Esq. late Governour of Vir­  
ginia, and William Vans Murray, Esq. our  
Minister resident at the lague, to be En­  
voys Extraordinary and Ministers Plenipoten­  
tiary to the I&#x27;rench Republick, with full pow­  
ers to discuss and settle by a treaty all con­  
troversics between the United States and  
France. It is not intended that the two for­  
mer of these gentlemen shall ¢mbark for  
Europe, until they shall have received from  
the Executive Directory assurances signified  
by their Secretary of foreign relations, that  
they ‘shall be received in character, that they  
shall enjoy all the prerogatives attached to  
that character by the law of nations, and that  
a minister or ninisters of equal powers shall  
be appointed and commissioned to treat with  
them.  
  
Feb. 25, 1799, ‘  
To these hominations the Senate advised,  
and consented, and commissions were prepar­  
ed. My friend, Mr. Henty, declined, on ac­  
count of his age, and Governour Davie, of  
North-Carolina, was appeinted in his place,  
During alt this transaction, ho thotion was­  
made in Senate, to pass a resdlution that a  
mission to France wi® inexpedient. With  
the despatches from ‘Talleyrand before his  
eyes, I believe no member of° the Senate  
would have been willing to pecord his name  
in favour of such a resolution, 4mong the yeas  
and nzts..’l‘hc deputation of Senators made no  
remonmstraiices 10 me against the mission, or  
the diplomatick cothmunications on ‘whjch tt  
was fonnded, but only against the missionary,  
Mr. Murray. . ‘  
I sent an invitation to the heads of depart­  
ments to assemble in my chamber, to consult  
nm%inwﬁam to be given to our cn­  
vays. They all met me accordingly, and in  
several bﬁ evenings entered into a very ser­  
ibus an / deliberate discussion of every artigle  
that was to be demanded and insisted on in  
the proposed treaty. ‘They &#x27;were all unani­  
mously ls:c(l upon te my pntire satisfaction,  
and reduced to writing. I committed them  
T the secretary of state, to be reduced into  
  
A FREEMAN.  
  
‘ JOHN ADAMS.  
  
proper form, to, have a fair copy made ahd  
transmitted to me, for revision, correction or  
stghature, as there mright be occasion.  
The yellow fever was expected, and we  
were all obliged to fly for our lives : myself  
and all my family to Quincy, wnd the heads  
of depaatments, with the publick offices, to  
Trenton, = -  
I had repeatedly endeavoured to impress  
upen the miyd of the secretary of state, the  
necessity of transmitting to me as soon as  
possible, his draught of the instructions, that  
they might be finished and signed, and every  
thing prepared for the departure of the en­  
voys. I waited with much concern, expect­  
ing from day to day to receive the instruc­  
tions ; but ‘no instructions appeared. At ‘  
length, instead of them, I received 4 letter  
signed by all five of the heads of departments,  
carnestly entreating me to susprend the mission)!  
I was astonished at this unexpected, this  
obstinate and’ persevering opposition to a I  
measure, that appeared so clearly to me to be  
s 0 esscntial to the peace and prospenrity of the  
nation, and the honour of the government, at  
home and abroad. -1 was not &amp; little surpris­  
cd at the unanimity of the heuds of depart­  
ments, for two of them had always appeared  
moderate snd candid in relation to this mis­  
sion. My instantancous detérmination was  
to go to Trenton, meet the gentlemen face to  
face, to confer with them coolly on the sub-  
Ject and convince them, or be convinced by  
them,if 1 could. On my way, I called upon  
- Chief Justice Ellsworth, at his seat in Winds  
sor, and had a conversation of perhaps two  
hours with him. He was perfectly candid.  
Whatever should be the determination, he  
was ready at an hour’s warning to comply. If  
it was thought best. to ¢émbark immediately,  
he-was rca(Fy. If it was judged more expe­  
dient to postpone it for a little time, though  
that might subjcct Lim to a winter voyage,  
that danger had no weight with him. If it  
was conclucgl to defer it till the spring, he  
was willing to wait. In this disposition I  
took leave of him. He gave me no intima­  
tion that he had any thought of a journey to  
Trenton. Ilodged at HHartford, not yet pur­  
ificd of the yellow fever, and there 1 caught  
something very like ity or at least almnost as  
bad, a most violent cold, attended with a con­  
stant fever, which rendered me forsix weeks  
more fit for achamber and a bed of sickness,  
than for uncomfortable journeys, or much la­  
bour of the head or hands. However, I would  
not consent to be retarded on my journey, 1  
and reached Trenton, where Mr. Hamiiton  
bad arrved a few hours beforc me. Gover­  
nour Davie had been there some time. Il  
as I was, I sent for the heads of departments.  
Four of them were there. The attorney  
general was gone to Virginia. Many days  
were employed in cohferences with them,  
some-times at My own apartments, and some­  
times at their offices. - _  
The inhabitants of Trenton had been  
wréught.up to a pitch of political enthusiasm  
that surprised me. The univérsal cpinion  
,g})eax‘ed to be, that the first arrivals from  
rope would bring the glorious ncws, that  
liouls the Eighteenth was restéred to the 1  
“throne of France; und reignin triumphantly .  
sat &#x27; Versailles. Suwarrow, at‘tfnc head of his  
‘victorious Russian army, was to have march­  
etl from Italy to Paris, on one side, and Prince |  
Charles, at the head of an Austrian army,’  
was to have marched from Germany to Paris  
oh the other, and detachments from both ar­  
mies were to march down to Havre, to re­  
ceive the king, who was 9 be brought over  
by a British fleet and escorted with flying co­  
lours to Versailles. I could scarcely believe  
my ‘own senses when I heard such reveries:  
Yet the heads of departments appeared to  
believe them, and urge them as decisive ar­  
&#x27; guments ﬁr suspending the embarkation of  
our envoys till the spring. In vain did I urge  
the immense distances . the two imperial ar­  
mies had to march, the great number of  
‘towns and cities in the route of both, in posi­  
‘tions chosen with great skill, fortified with  
exquisite art, defended by vast trains of hea­  
vy ordnance, garrisoned by’ numerous troops  
. of soldiers perfectly disciplined, and animated  
‘with all the obstinacy and ardour of the revol­  
utionary spirit. In vain did I alledge the  
miilitary maxim, which would certainly gov­  
ern both Prince Charles and Suwarrow, that  
I§y never to leave a fortified city in the rear of  
your army, in fiossession of your enemy. That  
the siege of one town would consume the  
- whole sé@son.—That neither the Russians  
nor Austrians were ptobably provided with  
the mortars and hcavy cannon necessary for  
sigges.~=Nothing would do—Louis XVIII.  
must be upon the throne of France~—~Well,  
supposé€ he is, what harm will there be in  
embarkifig outr envoys 7 They will congrat­  
ulate hls Majeity, and if his Majesty cahnot  
réceive them unger their credentials to the  
Freiig epuﬂft.k. be will be glad to seetliem  
&#x27;m‘z&amp;dom, and assure them of his royal  
protgetion till they can write home for fresh  
cominissions, and such shall be ready for  
thern at a minute’s warning. In vain did 1  
urge the entire change of property in France  
.3. the necessity the present possessours were  
under to dofend themselves at every sacrifice  
and every risque. Mr. Fllsworth had arrived  
in M&#x27;:’thm daﬁaﬁr me. I invited him  
and Governour Davia, to dine with me alone,  
that we T converse with entire&#x27; freedom.  
At table, Mr. Ellsworth etgressed an opinion  
- somewhat similarao that of the heals of de­  
and the publick opinion of Trenton.  
ll : possible, Chiel Justice, said I, tbat you  
can scriously belicve that the Bourbons are or.  
willbe.soon restored to the throne of France ?  
Wiy, said Mr. Ellsworth, smiling, it looks a  
good deal so. I should notbe afruid to stake  
my-life upon it, that they will not be restored  
in seven years, if they ever are; was my reply.  
And then I entered into a_long détcl of my  
teascns for this opinion. They would be too  
  
fecivus (o enuragrate liere, and ne has sups  
crceded the necessity of them.  
The result of Ulie conversation was, that  
Mr. Davia was decidedly for embarking im­  
me diat‘c%, as he always had been from_i\is first  
arrival, and Mr. Elisworth déclared himself  
satisfied and willing to embark as soon 1 plea­  
scd. &quot;  
  
Mr. Hamilton, who had been some time in  
town and had visited me several times, came  
at last to remonstrate against the mission to  
France. I received him with Elcat civilityas  
I always had . done fron my first knowledge  
,of him. I was fortunat «y in avery heppy  
temper* end very good humour. He weunt  
over the whole ground of the victories of Su­  
warrow and Prince Charles, and the inflexible  
determination of the two imperial courts, in  
concert with G. Bfitainy to restore the honse  
‘of Bourbon to their kingdom. That there  
was no doubt the enterprize was already ac­  
“complished, or at least it would bé, before the  
“end of the campaign. That Mr. Pitt was de­  
termined to restore the Bourbons. That the  
confidence of the nation in Mr. Pitt was un­  
‘bounded. That the nation was never so united,  
and determined to support Mr. Pitt and his  
resqlution to restore the monarchy of Irance.  
His eloquence and vehemence wrought the  
little man up to a deEree of heatand efferves­  
cﬁo like that which Gen. Knox ueed to de­  
scribe of his conduct in the battle of Mon­  
.mouthy and which General LEep used to call  
his paroxysms of bravery, but which he said  
would never be ofany service to lits country.  
I-answered him in general as I-had answered  
the heads of departments and judge Ells­  
worth-=but to no purpese. e repeated ov­  
er and over again the unalterable resolution  
of Mr. Pitt end the two imperial courts, the  
invincible heroism of Suwarrow and Prince  
Charles, and the unboqndcd confidence ofthe  
British empire in Mr. Pitt, with such agita­  
tion and violent action, that I really pitied him  
instead of being displeased. I only added,  
that I differed with him in opinion on every  
puint, and that instead of restoring the Bour­  
bons, it would not be long before England  
would make peace. I treated him thirough­  
oat with great mildness and civility ; but af­  
ter he took leave, I could net help reflecting  
in my own mind on the total ignorance he  
had betrayed of every thing in_Europe, in  
France, Fngland and elsewhere. Instead of  
that unbounded confidence in Mr. Pitt, I knew  
that the nation had been-long working up al­  
most to a ripeness for rebellion against M.  
Pitt, for continuing the war. Accordingly it  
was not long before Mr. Pitt was obliged to  
resign, peace at Amiens was made, and Na­  
poleon acknowledged. Mp. Hamilton in Lis  
most famous pamphlet, has hinteéd dt this con­  
versation, and squinted at my simplicity for  
expecting peace.  
Upon the whole, I directed the instruc­  
tions to be preparedsthe heads of departments  
were assembled, and the instructions delib­  
erateiy considered, paragraph by paragraph,  
and unaniinously appreved by me and b‘; them.  
Indeed there had never been any difference  
‘of opinion among us on any article of the in­  
structions. S g  
  
The instructions were presented to the en­  
voys, and they requested to emlark in the  
United States frigate as soon as possible,——  
For some cause or other in the state of the  
ship, they landed in Spain, and went by land  
froam Corunna to Paris on the same rout  
which Mr. Dana and 1 had travelled twenty  
years before, tliat is, in 1780. Before their  
arrival a revolution had occured, and the  
Consylar government succeeded the Directo­  
ry. e , 2  
  
Had Mr. Murray’s nomination been appro­  
ved, he would probably hLave finished the  
business long before, and obtained compensa­  
tion for all spoliations. - &#x27; &#x27;
