 to by leaving the reduction incorporation &amp;c. of the regiments to the particular states—This is one of the greatest evils of our affairs.  
  
I share with you the pleasure you feel from the measures taking to strengthen the hands of Congress. I am convinced it is essential to our safety that Congress should have an efficient power. The want of it must ruin us.  
The satisfaction I have in any successes that attend us or even in the alleviation of misfortunes is always allayed; by a fear that it will lull us into security—Supineness and a disposition to flatter ourselves seem to make parts of our national character—when we receive a check and are not quite undone, we are apt to fancy we have gained a victory; and when we do gain any little advantage, we imagine it decisive and expect the war is immediately to end. The history of the war is a history of false hopes and temporary expedients—Would to God they were to end here! This Winter, if I am not mistaken, will open a still more embarrassing scene than we have yet experienced

“ Know thyself,” is a precept of no less importance to ana-  
tion than to individuals. The following part of our national cha-  
racter is drawn by a hand at once so able and so impartial, that  
it merits the highest attention. When our faults are known  
and acknowledged, there is some hope of amendment.  
  
General Washington, in a private letter, written in the year  
1780 observes, “ The satisfaction I have in any successes that  
attend us even in the alleviation of misfortunes, is always al-  
loyed by the fear that it will lull us into security. Supineness and  
a disposition to flatter ourselves seem to make prarts of our na-  
tional character. When we receive a check, and are not quite  
undone, we are apt to fancy we have gained a victory; and when  
we do gain any little advantage, we imagine it decisive, and ex-
