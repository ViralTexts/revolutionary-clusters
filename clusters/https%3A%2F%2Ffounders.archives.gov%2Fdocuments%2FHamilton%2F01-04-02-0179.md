o the People of the State of New-York.  
IN addition to the defects already enumerated in the existing Fœderal system, there are others of not less importance, which concur in rendering it altogether unfit for the administration of the affairs of the Union.  
The want of a power to regulate commerce is by all parties allowed to be of the number. The utility of such a power has been anticipated under the first head of our inquiries; and for this reason as well as from the universal conviction entertained upon the subject, little need be added in this place. It is indeed evident, on the most superficial view, that there is no object, either as it respects the interests of trade or finance that more strongly demands a Fœderal superintendence. The want of it has already operated as a bar to the formation of beneficial treaties with foreign powers; and has given occasions of dissatisfaction between the States. No nation acquainted with the nature of our political association would be unwise enough to enter into stipulations with the United States, by which they conceded privileges of any importance to them, while they were apprised that the engagements on the part of the Union, might at any moment be violated by its members; and while they found from experience that they might enjoy every advantage they desired in our markets, without granting us any return, but such as their momentary convenience might suggest. It is not therefore to be wondered at, that Mr. Jenkinson in ushering into the House of Commons a bill for regulating the temporary intercourse between the two countries, should preface its introduction by a declaration that similar provisions in former bills had been found to answer every purpose to the commerce of Great Britain, &amp; that it would be prudent to persist in the plan until it should appear whether the American government was likely or not to acquire greater consistency.  
  
This as nearly as I can recollect was the sense of his speech in introducing the last bill.  
  
  
Several States have endeavoured by separate prohibitions, restrictions and exclusions, to influence the conduct of that kingdom in this particular; but the want of concert, arising from the want of a general authority, and from clashing, and dissimilar views in the States, has hitherto frustrated every experiment of the kind; and will continue to do so as long as the same obstacles to an uniformity of measures continue to exist.  
The interfering and unneighbourly regulations of some States, contrary to the true spirit of the Union, have in different instances given just cause of umbrage and complaint to others; and it is to be feared that examples of this nature, if not restrained by a national controul, would be multiplied and extended till they became not less serious sources of animosity and discord, than injurious impediments to the intercourse between the different parts of the confederacy. “The commerce of the German empire,  
  
Encyclopedie article empire.  
  
is in continual trammels from the multiplicity of the duties which the several Princes and States exact upon the merchandizes passing through their territories; by means of which the fine streams and navigable rivers with which Germany is so happily watered, are rendered almost useless.” Though the genius of the people of this country might never permit this description to be strictly applicable to us, yet we may reasonably expect, from the gradual conflicts of State regulations, that the citizens of each, would at length come to be considered and treated by the others in no better light than that of foreigners and aliens.  
The power of raising armies, by the most obvious construction of the articles of the confederation, is merely a power of making requisitions upon the States for quotas of men. This practice, in the course of the late war, was found replete with obstructions to a vigorous and to an œconomical system of defence. It gave birth to a competition between the States, which created a kind of auction for men. In order to furnish the quotas required of them, they outbid each other, till bounties grew to an enormous and insupportable size. The hope of a still further increase afforded an inducement to those who were disposed to serve to procrastinate their inlistment; and disinclined them to engaging for any considerable periods. Hence slow and scanty levies of men in the most critical emergencies of our affairs—short inlistments at an unparalleled expence—continual fluctuations in the troops, ruinous to their discipline, and subjecting the public safety frequently to the perilous crisis of a disbanded army. Hence also those oppressive expedients for raising men which were upon several occasions practised, and which nothing but the enthusiasm of liberty would have induced the people to endure.  
This method of raising troops is not more unfriendly to œconomy and vigor, than it is to an equal distribution of the burthen. The States near the seat of war, influenced by motives of self preservation, made efforts to furnish their quotas, which even exceeded their abilities, while those at a distance from danger were for the most part as remiss as the others were diligent

. We shall not, however, see much reason to regret the want of this, when we consider how little prospect there is, that the most delinquent States will ever be able to make compensation for their pecuniary failures. The system of quotas and requisitions, whether it be applied to men or money, is in every view a system of imbecility in the union, and of inequality and injustice among the members.  
The right of equal suffrage among the States is another exceptionable part of the confederation. Every idea of proportion, and every rule of fair representation conspire to condemn a principle, which gives to Rhode-Island an equal weight in the scale of power with Massachusetts, or Connecticut, or New-York; and to Delaware, an equal voice in the national deliberations with Pennsylvania or Virginia, or North-Carolina. Its operation contradicts that fundamental maxim of republican government, which requires that the sense of the majority should prevail. Sophistry may reply, that sovereigns are equal, and that a majority of the votes of the States will be a majority of confederated America. But this kind of logical legerdemain, will never counteract the plain suggestions of justice and common sense. It may happen that this majority of States is a small minority of the people of America;   
  
New-Hampshire, Rhode-Island, New-Jersey, Delaware, Georgia, SouthCarolina and Maryland, are a majority of the whole number of the States, but they do not contain one third of the people.  
  
and two thirds of the people of America, could not long be persuaded, upon the credit of artificial distinctions and syllogistic subtleties, to submit their interests to the management and disposal of one third. The larger States would after a while revolt from the idea of receiving the law from the smaller. To acquiesce in such a privation of their due importance in the political scale, would be not merely to be insensible to the love of power, but even to sacrifice the desire of equality. It is neither rational to expect the first, nor just to require the last—the smaller States considering how peculiarly their safety and welfare depend on union, ought readily to renounce a pretension; which, if not relinquished would prove fatal to its duration.  
It may be objected to this, that not seven but nine States,

, that there is a probability of an increase in the number of States, and no provision for a proportional augmentation of the ratio of votes.  
But this is not all; what at first sight may seem a remedy, is in reality a poison. To give a minority a negative upon the majority (which is always the case where more than a majority is requisite to a decision) is in its tendency to subject the sense of the greater number to that of the lesser number. Congress from the non-attendance of a few States have been frequently in the situation of a Polish Diet, where a single veto has been sufficient to put a stop to all their movements. A sixtieth part of the Union, which is about the proportion of Delaware and Rhode-Island, has several times been able to oppose an intire bar to its operations. This is one of those refinements which in practice has an effect, the reverse of what is expected from it in theory. The necessity of unanimity in public bodies, or of something approaching towards it, has been founded upon a supposition that it would contribute to security. But its real operation is to embarrass the administration, to destroy the energy of government, and to substitute the pleasure, caprice or artifices of an insignificant, turbulent or corrupt junto, to the regular deliberations

a respectable majority. In those emergencies of a nation, in which the goodness or badness, the weakness or strength of its government, is of the greatest importance, there is commonly a necessity for action. The public business must in some way or other go forward. If a pertinacious minority can controul the opinion of a majority respecting the best mode of conducting it; the majority in order that something may be done, must conform to the views of the minority; and thus the sense of the smaller number will over-rule that of the greater, and

hat the most limited monarch in Europe, in a single day, without tumult, violence, or opposition, became one of the most absolute and uncontrouled.  
A circumstance, which crowns the defects of the confederation, remains yet to be mentioned—the want of a judiciary power. Laws are a dead letter without courts to expound and define their true meaning and operation. The treaties of the United States to have any force at all, must be considered as part of the law of the land. Their true import as far as respects individuals, must, like all other laws, be ascertained by judicial determinations. To produce uniformity in these determinations, they ought to be submitted in the last resort, to one SUPREME TRIBUNAL. And this tribunal ought to be instituted under the same authority which forms the treaties themselves. These ingredients are both indispensable. If there is in each State, a court of final jurisdiction, there may be as many different final determinations on the same point, as there are courts. There are endless diversities in the opinions of men. We often see not only different courts, but the Judges of the same court differing from each other. To avoid the confusion which would unavoidably result from the contradictory decisions of a number of independent judicatories, all nations have found it necessary to establish one court paramount to the rest—possessing a general superintendance, and authorised to settle and declare in the last resort, an uniform rule of civil justice.  
This is the more necessary where the frame of the government is so compounded, that the laws of the whole are in danger of being contravened by the laws of the parts. In this case if the particular tribunals are invested with a right of ultimate jurisdiction, besides the contradictions to be expected from difference of opinion, there will be much to fear from the bias of local views and prejudices, and from the interference of local regulations. As often as such an interference was to happen, there would be reason to apprehend, that the provisions of the particular laws might be preferred to those of the general laws; for nothing is more natural to men in office, than to look with peculiar deference towards that authority to which they owe their official existence.  
The treaties of the United States, under the present constitution, are liable to the infractions of thirteen different Legislatures, and as many different courts of final jurisdiction, acting under the authority of those Legislatures. The faith, the reputation, the peace of the whole union, are thus continually at the mercy of the prejudices, the passions, and the interests of every member of which it is composed. Is it possible that foreign nations can either respect or confide in such a government? Is it possible that the People of America will longer consent to trust their honor, their happiness, their safety, on so precarious a foundation?  
In this review of the Confederation, I have confined myself to the exhibition of its most material defects; passing over those imperfections in its details, by which even a great part of the power intended to be conferred upon it has been in a great measure rendered abortive. It must be by this time evident to all men of reflection, who can divest

lity would be, that we should run into the project of conferring supplementary powers upon Congress as they are now constituted; and either the machine, from the intrinsic feebleness of its structure, will moulder into pieces in spite of our ill-judged efforts to prop it; or by successive augmentations of its force and energy, as necessity might prompt, we shall finally accumulate in a single body, all the most important prerogatives of sovereignty; and thus entail upon our posterity, one of the most execrable forms of government that human infatuation ever contrived. Thus we should create in reality that very tyranny, which the adversaries of the new constitution either are, or affect to be solicitous to avert.  
It has not a little contributed to the infirmities of the existing fœderal system, that it never had a ratification by the PEOPLE. Resting on no better foundation than the consent of the several Legislatures; it has been exposed to frequent and intricate questions concerning the validity of its powers; and has in some instances given birth to the enormous doctrine of a right of legislative repeal. Owing its ratification to the law of a State, it has been contended, that the same authority might repeal the law by which it was ratified. However gross a heresy it may be, to maintain that a party to a compact has a right to revoke that compact, the doctrine itself has had respectable advocates. The possibility of a question of this nature, proves the necessity of laying the foundations of our national government deeper than in the mere sanction of delegated authority. The fabric of American Empire ought to rest on the solid basis of THE CONSENT OF THE PEOPLE. The streams of national power ought to flow immediately from that pure original fountain of all legitimate authority.

Constitution. It would be easy to multiply authorities on this  
head—one shall suffice, because, while it narrates the fact, it  
indicates also the objects and evils to which this power was in-  
tended to apply.  
  
Speaking of the defects of the old Confederation, the authors  
of the “* Federalist” remark :—  
  
“The want of a power to regulate commerce is, by all parties, allowed  
to be of the number. It is, indeed, evident, on the most superficial  
view, that there is no object, either as it respects the interests of trade  
or finance, that more strongly demands a federal superintendance. The  
wait of it has already operated as a bar to the formation of beneficial  
treaties with foreign powers; and has given occasions of dissatisfaction  
between the States. No nation, acquainted with the nature of our poli-  
tical association, would be unwise enough to enter into stipulations with  
the United States, conceding, on their part, privileges of importance ;  
while they were apprised that the engagements on the part of the Union  
might, at any moment, be violated by its members; and while they  
found from experience that they might enjoy every advantage they de-  
sired in our markets, without granting us any return, but such as their  
momentary convenience might suggest.  
  
“* Several States have endeavoured, by separate prohibitions, restric-  
tions, and exclusions, to influence that kingdom (Great-Britain) in this  
particular; but the want of concert, arising from the want of a general  
authority, and from clashing and dissimilar views in the States, has,

time openly declared, in ushering into the House of Com-  
mons, a bill for regulating the temporary intercourse be-  
tween the two countries, in his introduction, that similar  
provisions in former bills had been found to answer every  
purpose to the commerce of Great Britain, and that it would  
be prudent to persist in the plan until it should appear  
whether the American Government was likely or not to  
exercise greater consistency. Several of the States en-  
deavored by separate prohibitions, restrictions, and exclu.  
sions, to influence the conduct of that Kingdom, in this  
particular; but the want of concert, arising from the want  
of a general authority, and from clashing of dissimilar views  
in the states, frustrated every experiment of the kind; and  
would have contiaued so to do, as long as the same obsta-

This negative is supposed to be necessary to the  
security of the states, and the protection of the mi-  
nority; but its real operation will be to destroy the  
force and energy of the administration. ‘‘What may  
at first sight appear a remedy, is, in reality, a poison;  
to give the minority a negative upon the majority,  
which is always the case when more than a majority  
18 requisite to a decision, is, in its tendency, to sub-  
ject the sense of the greater number to that of the  
lesser. Congress, (under the confederation), from  
the non-attendance of a few states, have been fre-  
quently in the situation of the Polish diet, when a  
single veto has been sufficient to put a stop to all  
their movements. The sixtieth part of the union  
has several times been able to oppose an entire bar  
to its operations. This is one of those refinements,  
Which, in practice, has in effect, the reverse of what  
is expected from it in theory.”— Federalist.

‘ The last defect which seems worthy of enumeration is, that  
the Confederation never had a ratification of the pEopLe. Upon  
this objection it will be sufficient to quote a single passage from  
the same celebrated work, (Federalist, No. 22.) as it affords a  
very striking commentary upon some extraordinary doctrines re-  
cently promulgated. ‘‘ Resting upon no better foundation than  
the consent of the State Legislatures, it has been exposed to fre-  
quent and intricate questions concerning the validity of its pow-  
ers; and has in some instances given birth to the erroneous  
doctrine of a right of legislative repeal. Owing its ratification to  
a law of a State, it has been contended that the same authority  
might repeal the law by which it was ratified. However grossa  
heresy it may be to maintain, that a party to a compact has a  
right to revoke that compact, the doctrine itself has had respecta-  
ble advocates. The possibility of a question of this nature  
proves the necessity of laying the foundations of our national  
government deeper than the mere sanction of delegated author-

other reasons, induced the convention to  
vest in congress the power to regulate  
commerce among the several states. The  
past experience of the nation under the  
articles of confederation, had demonstra-  
ted the necessity of vesting in the federal  
government also, the power to regulate  
and to exert a general superintendence  
over foreign commerce. The want of  
such a power in that government had ope-  
rated as a bar to the formation of benefi-  
cial treaties with foreign powers, and had  
also given occasion of dissatisfaction be-  
tween the states. Foreign powers ac-  
quainted with our institutions, had de-  
clined to enter into stipulations with the  
federal government, by which they should  
concede on their part, important commer-

cial privileges, knowing as they did, that  
the engagements on the part of the Union,  
might at any moment, be violated by any  
member of the confederacy. Even the  
government of England, with which this  
country, from its position and productions,  
must ever sustain most intimate and im-  
portant commercial relations, would only  
make provisions for a temporary inter-  
course with this country, on the ground  
that such had been found to answer every  
purpose, essential to the commerce of  
Great Britain, and had intimated an ad-  
herence to that policy, until the federal  
government should acquire a greater con-  
sistency. Although several states had en-  
deavored by separate prohibitions, re-  
strictions, and exclusions, to influence the  
conduct of other nations in this particu-  
lar, it had failed for the want of concert,  
arising from the want of general authori-  
ty, and from clashing and dissimilar  
views in the several states. ‘To over-  
come these barriers to the commercial re-  
lations of the country, it was deemed ip  
  
dispensable to place the power over for

tions. He says, inthe 22d number of The Federalist: “A  
circumstance which shows the defects of the confederation  
remains to be mentioned—the want of a judiciary power,  
Laws are a dead letter without courts to expound and define  
their true meaning and operation. The treaties of the United  
States, to have any force at all, must be considered as a part of  
the law of the land. Their true import, as regards individuals,  
must, like all other laws, be ascertained by judicial determina-  
tions. ‘To produce uniformity in these determinations, they  
ought to be submitted to a supreme tribunal; and this tribunal  
ought to be instituted under the same authorities which form  
the treaties themselves. These ingredients are both indispensa-  
ble. If there is in each State a court of final jurisdiction, there  
may be as many different final determinations on the same point  
as there are courts. ‘here are endless diversities in the opinions  
of men. We often see not only different courts, but the judges  
of the same court, differing from each other. ‘l&#x27;’o avoid the con-  
fusion which would unavoidably result from the contradictory  
decisions of a number of independent judicatures, all nations  
have found it necessary to establish one tribunal paramount to  
the rest, possessing a general superintendence, and authorized  
to settle and declare in the last resort a uniform rule of civil  
justice. This is the more necessary where the frame of the  
government is so compounded that the laws of the whole are in  
danger of being contravened by the laws of the parts. In this  
case, if the particular tribunals are invested with a right of ulti-  
mate decision, besides the contradictions to be expected from  
difference of opinion, there will be much to fear from the bias of  
local views and prejudices, and from the interference of local  
institutions. As often as such an interference should he@ppen,  
there would be reason to apprehend that the provisions of the  
particular laws might be preferred to those of the general laws,

from the deference which men in office naturally look up to  
that authority to which they owe their official existence.”  
  
Hitherto we have shown from the constitution itself that the  
framers of it meant to provide a jurisdiction for its final interpre-  
tation, and for the laws passed by Congress, to give them an  
equal operation in all of the States.  
  
But there are considerations out of the constitution which  
contribute to show it, which we will briefly mention. Without  
such a judicial tribunal there are no means provided by which  
the conflicting legislation of the States with the constitution  
and the laws of congress may be terminated, so as to give to  
either a national operation in each of the States. In

and impropriety of this system of requisition. It was  
equaly at war with economy, eificiency and satety. It  
gave birth to a competition between the States, which  
created a kind of anction of men. In order to furnish  
the quotas required of them they outbid each other till  
bounties grew to an enormous and insupportable size.  
On this account, many persons procrastinated their enlist­  
ment or enlisted only for short periods. Hence there  
were but slow and scanty levies of men in the most crit  
ical emergencies of our affairs. Short enlistments are  
unparalleled expense, and continual fluctuations in the  
troops, ruinous to their discipline and subjecting the pub­  
lic safety frequently to the perilous crisis of a disbanded  
army. Hence, also, arose the oppressive expedients for  
ro sing men which nothing but the euthusiasm of liberty

tution, construed as  
a legal document, the States had a right to secede, is about  
as ingenious a puzzle as any other question as to the meaning  
of a studiously ambiguous document. There are some things in it  
which look as if the States had such a right, and others which look  
as if they had not. The Federalist does not discuss the question at  
all. It once alludes to it in connexion with the old Confederacy,  
the infirmities of which it ascribes in great measure to the want of  
~~ ratification by the people. The old Confederacy was ratified  
only by the State Legislatures, and this, says Hamilton —  
has in some instances given birth to the enormous doctrine of a right of  
legislative repeal. Owing its ratification to the law of a State, it has been  
contended that the same authority might repeal the law by which it was  
ratified. However gross a heresy it may be to maintain that a party to a  
compact has a right to revoke that compact, the doctrine itself has respect-  
able advocates, &amp;c.  
This is the only reference contained in the Federalist to the  
t question which has since convulsed the whole Union.  
t must, in all probability, have occurred to the authors of  
the Constitution. Probably they did not deal with it because  
they felt that to give or withhold the right in question would  
be inconsistent with the whole character of their plan. T

Patrick Ilenry, in the Virginia debates

That this is * consolidated government is  
deuioustratably clear. The language is.

Alexander Hamilton, in the twenty-sec­

the defects of the old confederation, points  
out the weakness arising from its not Lav­

owing its ratification to the law of a State,  
some held that the s true authority could

Through this simple instrumentality every at-  
tempted usurpation of power by national or State  
legislatures has become ineffective, and each  
has been confined within its proper limits. Ham-  
ilcon said of the old Confederation: “ The treaties  
of the United States under the present Constitu-  
tion are liable to the infractions of thirteen dif-  
ferent legislatures, and as many different courts  
of final jurisdiction acting under the authority of  
those legislatures. The faith, the- reputation,  
the peace, of the whole Union are thus continu-  
ally at the mercy of the prejudices, the passions,  
and the interests of every member of which it is  
composed. Is it possible that foreign nations  
either respect or confide in such a government ?  
Is it possible that the people of America will  
longer consent to trust their honor, their happi-  
ness, their safety, on so precarious a founda-  
tion?” Our avoidance of those evils, and the  
discord and disruption which would follow them,  
are due to the existence of one Supreme Court, con-  
stantly and consistently declaring and enforcing  
the limitations of constitutional authority.  
  
It seems marvellous—or it would seem so were  
it not that daily use robs it of strangeness—that  
two separate governments, each sovereign within  
its own sphere, eacn having a separate and inde-  
pendent legislative, executive, and judicial estab-  
lishment, should at the same time rule in the  
same territory without clashing, discord, or con

iStates, and now ulled with a sense of  
the need for comprehensive reforms.&quot; And  
Hamilton in the&#x27; &quot; Federalist&quot; for 14th  
December, 1787, says : &quot; It has not a  
little contributed to the infirmities of  
the existing Federal system that it  
never ¡had a ratification by the people.  
Resting on no better foundation than the  
consent of the several Legislatures, it  
has been exposed to frequent and  
intricate questions concerning the va-  
lidity of its powers, and has in some  
instances, given birth to the enormous  
doctrine of a right of legislative  
repeal. Owing its ratification to the  
law of a State, it ttias been contended  
that the same authority might repeal the  
law .by wihieh it was ratified. However  
gross a heresy it may be to maintain  
that a (one) party to a compact has a  
right to revoke that compact, the  
doetrine itself has had respectable  
advo-cates. The possibility of a  
question of &quot;this nature proves the  
necessity of laying the foundations of  
our national government deeper than in  
the mere sanction of delegated  
authority. The fabric of American Empire  
ought to rest on the solid basis ol &#x27;
