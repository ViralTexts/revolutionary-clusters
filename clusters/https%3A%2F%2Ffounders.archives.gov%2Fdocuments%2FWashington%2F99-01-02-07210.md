Major General the Marqs de la Fayette  
Colonel Walter Stewart  
Major Reid  
Brigade Major Cox  
Brigadier General Hazen’s Brigade for duty tomorrow to parade at ten ô’clock on their own parade.  
As a great number of the axes delivered to working parties during the siege have not been returned the Commander in Chief directs that the Commandants of Corps continental and militia may have an immediate and strict search made in their respective commands  
and that all the axes found which have not been issued for their particular use may be returned to General Elbert uperintendant of the deposit of the trenches.

day.  
After Orders  
The General congratulates the Army upon the glorious event of yesterday.  
The generous proofs which his most Christian Majesty has given of his attachment to the Cause of America must force conviction on the minds of the most deceived among the Enemy: relatively to the decisive good consequences of the Alliances and inspire every  
citizen of these States with sentiments of the most unalterable Gratitude.  
His Fleet the most numerous and powerful that ever appeared in these seas commanded by an Admiral whose Fortune and Talents ensure great Events.  
An Army of the most admirable compositions both in officers and men are the Pledges of his friendship to the United States and their cooperation has secured us the present signal success.  
The General upon this occasion entreats his Excellency Count de Rochambeau to accept his most grateful acknowledgements for his Counsels and assistance at all times. He presents his warmest thanks to the Generals Baron Viomenil, Chevalier Chastellux,  
Marquis de St Simond and Count Viomenil and to Brigadier General de Choissy (who had a seperate command) for the illustrious manner in which they have advanced the interest of the common cause.  
He requests that Count de Rochambeau will be pleased to communicate to the Army under his immediate command the high sense he entertains of the distinguished merits of the officers and soldiers of every corps and that he will present in his name to the  
regiments of Gattinois and Deuxponts the two Pieces of Brass Ordinance captured by them; as a testimony of their Gallantry in storming the Enemy’s Redoubt on the Night of the 14th instant when officers and men so universally vied with each other in the exercise of every  
soldierly virtue.  
The General’s Thanks to each individual of Merit would comprehend the whole Army. But He thinks himself bound however by Affection Duty and Gratitude to express his obligations to Major Generals Lincoln—de La Fayette and Steuben for their dispositions in  
the Trenches.  
To General DuPortail and Colonel Carney for the Vigor and Knowledge which were conspicuous in their Conduct of the Attacks—and to General Knox and Colonel D’Aberville, for their great care and attention and fatigue in bringing forward the Artillery and  
stores and for their judicious and spirited management of them in the Parallels.  
He requests the Gentlemen above mentioned to communicate his thanks to the officers and soldiers of their respective commands.  
In gratitude which the General hopes never to be guilty of would be conspicuous in him was he to omit thanking in the warmest terms His Excellency Governor Nelson for the Aid he has derived from him and from the Militia under his Command to whose Activity  
Emulation and Courage much Applause is due—the Greatness of the Acquisition will be an ample Compensation for the Hardships and Hazards which they encountered with so much patriotism and firmness.  
In order to diffuse the general Joy through every Breast the General orders that those men belonging to the Army who may now be in confinement shall be pardoned released and join their respective corps.  
Divine Service is to be performed tomorrow in the several Brigades or Divisions.  
The Commander in Chief earnestly recommends that the troops not on duty should universally attend with that seriousness of Deportment and gratitude of Heart which the recognition of such reiterated and astonishing interpositions of Providence demand of  
us.

on the occasion , contained the follow  
ing&#x27;just tribute to the allied troops ;  
The general congratulates the army  
upon the glorious events of yesterday.  
Tlio goneroiu proofs which his most  
Christian majesty has given of his at­  
tachment to the cause of America  
must force conviction on the minds of  
the most deceived among the enemy  
relative to the good consequences of

of these states with sentiments of the  
moat unalterable gratitudo. His iloot

manded by an admiral whoso fortune  
and talents insure great events an  
army of the most admirable composi­  
tion , both iri oflicoro and men , are the  
pledges of his friendship to the United  
States , and their cooperation has  
secured us the present signal success.  
The general on this occasion entreats  
his excellency , the Count do Itocham-  
beau , to accept his most grateful ac­  
knowledgements for his counsels at all  
times ; ho presented his warmest thanks  
to the ( Jons. Damn do Viomonil,  
Chevalier Chastellux , Marquis do  
Saint-Simon and Count do Yiomonil ,  
and to Brig.Gen. . do Choisy , who had  
a separata command , for the illustrious  
manner in which they have advanced  
the interests of the common causo. Ho  
requests that Count do Rochambeau  
will bo pleased to conununicato to the  
army under his command the high  
RCIISO ho entertains of their distfn-  
gui-heu merits of the ofiicera and HO ] .  
iliers of every corps , nnd that he will  
  
present in his name to the regiments  
of Agenois and Boux-Ponta the two  
pieces of brass ordnance captured by  
them as a to-tlmuny of their gallantry  
in storming the enemy&#x27;s redoubt on  
the night of the 14th inst. , when olli-  
cora and men so universally vied  
with each other in the exercise  
of every virtuo. The general&#x27;s  
thanks to each individual merit  
would comprehend fho whole army ,  
but ho thinks himself bound by affec­  
tion , duty and gratitude to express his  
obligations to Maj , Gens. Lincoln ,  
Lafayette and Steubon for dispositions  
in the trenches , to Gen Doprtnil and  
Col. Carnoy or the vigor and knowl­  
edge which were conspicuous in the  
conduct of tlio atfacks , and to Gou.  
Knox and Col. d&#x27;Abovillo for their  
great care , attention and fatigue in  
bringing forward the artiljery and  
stores and for their judicious nnd  
spirited arrangement of thorn in the

men above mentioned to communicate  
his thanks to the officers and soldiers  
of their rctipcctivo commands. Ingratitude -  
gratitude which the general hopes

ing in the w.xrmost terms his excel­  
lency , Gov. Nelson , for the aid ho has  
received from him and from the

applause is duo. Tno greatness of the  
acquisition will bo an ample compen­  
sation for the hardships mid hazards  
which they encountered with so much  
patriotism and firmness. Jn order to  
diffuse the general joy through every  
breast the general orders that thcso  
men belonging to the army who maybe

released and join their respective com  
mands. Divmo service is to bo per­

citizen of the States with sentiments of the most unalterable

fortune and talents insure success; an army of the most admi-  
rable composition, both in officers and men, are the pledges of  
his friendship to the United States, and their codperation has  
secured us the present signal success.  
  
The General, upon this occasion, entreats his excellency,  
Count Rochambeau, to accept his most grateful acknowledg-  
ments for his counsel and assistance at all times. He presents  
his warmest thanks to the generals, Baron de Viomnel, Cheva-  
lier Chastelleux, Marquis de St. Simon, Count de Viomnel,  
and to Brigadier de Choisey (who had a separate command),  
for the illustrious manner in which they have advanced the in-  
terest of the common cause. He requests the Count de Ro-  
chambeau will be pleased to communicate to the army under  
his immediate command the high sense he entertains of the  
distinguished merits of the officers and soldiers of every corps,  
and that he will present, in his name, to the regiment of Arge-  
nois and Deaponts, the pieces of brass ordnance captured by  
them, as a testimony of their gallantry in storming the enemy’s  
redoubts on the night of the 14th instant, when officers and  
men so universally vied with each other in the exercise of  
every soldierly virtue.  
  
The General’s thanks to each individual of merit would  
comprehend the whole army, but he thinks himself bound,  
however, by affection, duty, and gratitude, to express his obli-  
gation to Major Generals Lincoln, Lafayette, and Steuben,  
for their dispositions in the trenches, to General Duportail and  
Colonel Carney for the vigor and knowledge which were con-  
spicuous in their conduct of the attacks, and to General Knox  
and Colonel de Abberville for their great attention and fatigue  
in bringing forward the artillery and stores, and for their judi-  
cious and spirited management of them in the parallels. He  
requests the gentlemen above mentioned to communicate his  
thanks to the officers and soldiers of theircommands. Ingrati-
