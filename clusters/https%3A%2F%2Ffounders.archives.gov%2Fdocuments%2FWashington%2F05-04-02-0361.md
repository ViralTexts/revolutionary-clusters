United States [New York] January 8th 1790  
  
Fellow Citizens of the Senate, and House of Representatives.  
I embrace with great satisfaction the opportunity, which now presents itself, of congratulating you on the present favourable prospects of our public affairs. The recent accession of the important State of North Carolina to the Constitution of the United States (of which official information has been recieved)—the rising credit and respectability of our Country—the general and increasing good will towards the Government of the Union—and the concord, peace and plenty, with which we are blessed, are circumstances, auspicious, in an eminent degree to our national prosperity.  
In resuming your consultations for the general good, you cannot but derive encouragement from the reflection, that the measures of the last Session have been as satisfactory to your Constituents, as the novelty and difficulty of the work allowed you to hope. Still further to realize their expectations, and to secure the blessings which a Gracious Providence has placed within our reach, will in the course of the present important  
  
Session, call for the cool and deliberate exertion of your patriotism, firmness and wisdom.  
Among the many interesting objects, which will engage your attention, that of providing for the common defence will merit particular regard. To be prepared for war is one of the most effectual means of preserving peace.  
A free people ought not only to be armed but disciplined; to which end a Uniform and well digested plan is requisite: And their safety and interest require that they should promote such manufactories, as tend to render them independent on others, for essential, particularly for military supplies.  
The proper establishment of the Troops which may be deemed indispensible, will be entitled to mature consideration. In the arrangements which may be made respecting it, it will be of importance to conciliate the comfortable support of the Officers and Soldiers with a due regard to œconomy.  
There was reason to hope, that the pacific measures adopted with regard to certain hostile tribes of Indians would have relieved the inhabitants of our Southern and Western frontiers from their depredations. But you will percieve, from the information contained in the papers, which I shall direct to be laid before you (comprehending a communication from the Commonwealth of Virginia) that we ought to be prepared to afford protection to those parts of the Union; and, if necessary, to punish aggressors.  
The interests of the United States require, that our intercourse with other nations should be facilitated by such provisions as will enable me to fulfil my duty in that respect, in the manner, which circumstances may render most conducive to the public good: And to this end, that the compensations to be made to the persons, who may be employed, should, according to the nature of their appointments, be defined by law; and a competent fund designated for defraying the expenses incident to the conduct of foreign affairs.  
Various considerations also render it expedient, that the terms on which foreigners may be admitted to the rights of Citizens, should be speedily ascertained by a uniform rule of naturalization.  
Uniformity in the Currency, Weights and Measures of the  
  
United States is an object of great importance, and will, I am persuaded, be duly attended to.  
The advancement of Agriculture, commerce and Manufactures, by all proper means, will not, I trust, need recommendation. But I cannot forbear intimating to you the expediency of giving effectual encouragement as well to the introduction of new and useful inventions from abroad, as to the exertions of skill and genius in producing them at home; and of facilitating the intercourse between the distant parts of our Country by a due attention to the Post-Office and Post Roads.  
Nor am I less pursuaded, that you will agree with me in opinion, that there is nothing, which can better deserve your patrionage, than the promotion of Science and Literature. Knowledge is in every Country the surest basis of public happiness. In one, in which the measures of Government recieve their impression so immediately from the sense of the Community as in our’s, it is proportionably essential. To the security of a free Constitution it contributes in various ways: By convincing those, who are entrusted with the public administration, that every valuable end of Government is best answered by the enlightened confidence of the people: And by teaching the people themselves to know and to value their own rights; to discern and provide against invasions of them; to distinguish between oppression and the necessary exercise of lawful authority; between burthens proceeding from a disregard to their convenience and those resulting from the inevitable exigencies of Society; to discriminate the spirit of liberty from that of licentiousness, cherishing the first, avoiding the last, and uniting a speedy, but temperate vigilence against encroachments, with an inviolable respect to the laws.  
Whether this desirable object will be best promoted by affording aids to Seminaries of Learning already established—by the institution of a national University—or by any other expedients, will be well worthy of a place in the deliberations of the Legislature.  
Gentlemen of the House of Representatives.  
I saw with peculiar pleasure, at the close of the last Session, the resolution entered into by you expressive of your opinion,  
  
that an adequate provision for the support of the public Credit is a matter of high importance to the national honor and prosperity. In this sentiment, I entirely concur. And to a perfect confidence in your best endeavours to divise such a provision, as will be truly consistent with the end, I add an equal reliance on the chearful co-operation of the othe[r] branch of the Legislature. It would be superfluous to specify inducements to a measure in which the character and permanent interests of the United States are so obviously and so deeply concerned; and which has recieved so explicit a sanction from your declaration.  
Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives.  
I have directed the proper Officers to lay before you respectively such papers and estimates as regard the affairs particularly recommended to your consideration, and necessary to convey to you that information of the state of the Union, which it is my duty to afford.  
The welfare of our Country is the great object to which our cares and efforts ought to be directed. And I shall derive great satisfaction from a co-operation with you, in the pleasing though arduous task of ensuring to our fellow Citizens the blessings, which they have a right to expect, from a free, efficient and equal Government.  
  
Go: Washington

Fellow Citizens of the Senate and  
  
Houfe of Reprefentatives,  
_ LT EMBRACE with great fatisfac-  
tion the opportunity which now  
prefents it/clt, of congratulating you  
on the prefent, favourable proipects  
of our public affairs. The recent  
  
accefion of the important. ftate of  
TT etal ~ . Y 4  
Norilt-Carolina to the Conttitution  
  
of the United States (of which off-  
cial information has been received) —  
the rifing credit and refpeétability of  
our country—the general and in-  
creafing good-will towards the go-  
vernment of the union, and the cen-  
cord, peace and plenty, with which  
we are blefied, are circumftances,  
aufpicious, in an eminent degree ta  
our national profperity.  
  
In refuming your confultations for  
the general good, you cannot but  
derive encouragement from the re-  
flection, that the meafures of the lait  
{efion have been as fatisfaCtory, to  
your conitituents as the novelty and  
difiiculty of the work allowed you  
to hope. Still further to realize their  
expectations, and to fecure the bief-  
fings which a gracious Providence.  
has placed within our reach, will,  
in the courfe of the prefent important  
{effion, call for the cool and delibe-  
rate exertion of your patriotif{m, firm-  
nefs, and wiidom.  
  
Among the many interefting cb-  
jects, which will engage your atten-  
tion, that of providing for the com-  
mon defence will merit particular  
regard.—To be prepared br war is  
one of the moft eficctual means of:  
preferving peace.  
  
A free people ought not only to.  
be armed but difciplined; to which  
  
end auniformand well digefted plan  
  
is requifite ; and their fafety and in-  
tereft require that they fhould pro-

render them independent on others,  
for efleniial, particularly for military  
fupplies.

troops which may be deemed indif-  
pentable, will be entitled to matuse

which may be made relpecting it, it  
will be of importance to conctliate  
the comfortable.fupport of the officers  
and foldiers with a due regard to  
ceconomy.  
  
There was reafon to hope, tha  
the pacific meafures adopted with re-  
gard to certain hoftile tribes of Indi-  
ans, would have relieved the inha-  
bitants of our fouthern and weitern  
frontiers from their depredations :—  
But you will perceive frorn the infcr-  
mation contained in the papers which  
I fhall direét to be laid before you,  
(comprehending a communication  
from the commonwealth of Virginia)  
that we ought to be prepared to afford  
protection to thofe parts of the Uni-  
on; and, if neceflary, to punifh ag-  
greflors.  
  
The interefts of the United States  
require, that our intércourfe with  
other nations fhould be facilitated by  
fuch provifions as will enable me to  
fulfil my duty in that refpect, in the  
manner which circumitances may  
render moft conducive to the public  
good: And to this end, that the  
compenfations to be made to the per-  
fons, who may be employed, fhould,  
according to the nature of their ap-  
pointments, be defined by law; and  
a competent fund defienated for de-  
fraying the expences incident to the  
conduct of our foreien affairs.  
  
Various confiderations alfo render  
it expedient that the terms en which  
foreigners may be admitted to the  
rights of citizens, fhould be {peedily  
aicertained by a uniform rule of na-  
turaization.  
  
Uniformity in the currency, weights  
and meaiures of the United States,  
is an object of great importance, and  
will, I am perfuaded, be duly at-  
tended to.  
  
‘The advancement of agriculture,  
commerce, and manufaétures, by all  
proper means, will not, I truft, necd

FELLOW-CITIZENS of the SENATE, and  
HOUSE 0/REPRESENTATIVES.  
I EMBRACE with great fatisi&#x27;acftion the oppor­  
tunity, which now presents itfelf, of congra­  
tulating you on the present favorable prospects of  
our public affairs. The recent accession of the  
important state of North-Carolina to the Conui­  
tution of the United States (of which official in­  
formation has been received)—the rising credit  
and refpelability of our country—the general  
andincreafinggood-will towards the government  
of the union, and the concord, peace and plen­  
ty, with which we areblefled, are circumstances,  
auVpicious, in an eminent degree to our national  
prosperity. &#x27;  
In resuming your confutations for the general  
good, you cannot but derive encouragement from  
the reflexion, that the measures of the last ses­  
sion have been as fatisfacftory to your constituents,  
as the novelty and difficulty of the work allowed  
you to hope.—Still further to realize their ex­  
pectations, and to secure the blessings which a  
gracious Providence lias placed within our reach,  
will in the couife of the present important ses­  
sion, call for the cool and deliberate exertion of  
your patriotism, firmnels, and wisdom.   
Among the many interesting objects, which  
will engage your attention, that of providing  
for the common defence will merit particular re­  
gard. To be prepared for war is oneofthemoft  
effectual means of preserving peace.  
A free people ought not only to be armed but  
disciplined ; to which end a uniform and well di­  
verted plan is requisite : And their fafety and  
interest require that they should promote such ma­  
nufactories, as tend to render them independent  
on others, for eflential, particularly for military  
supplies. eftabll(hnient 0f the troops which  
may be deemed indispensable, will be entitled to  
mature consideration. In the arrangements which  
may be made respecting it, it will be of impor­  
tance to conciliate the comfortable support ot the  
ofticers and soldiers with a due regard to ceco­  
nomy. , ..  
There was reason to hope, that the pacific mea­  
sures adopted with regard to certain hostile tribes  
of Indians, would have relieved the inhabitants  
of our southern and western frontiers from their  
depredations. But you will perceive, from the in­  
formation contained in the papers, which I lliall  
direct to be laid before you, (comprehending a  
communication from the Commonwealth of Vir­  
ginia) that we ought to be prepared to afford  
protection to those parts of the Union ; and, it  
neceflary, to pnnifh aggreflors.  
The interests of die United Srates require,  
that our intercourse with other nations should be  
facilitated by such provisions as will enable me  
to fulfil my duty in that respect, in the manner,  
which circumstances may render most conducive  
to the public good : And to this end,that the com­  
pensations to be made to the persons, wo may  
be employed, should, according to the nature ot  
their appointments,be defined by law ,an  
petent fund designated for defraying the expei­  
ces incident to the conduct of our foreign affairs.  
Various confiderationsalfo render it expedient,  
that the terms on which fore.gners may fee ad.  
mitted to the rights of Citizens, should bejpee  
ly ascertained by a uniform  
Uniformity in the currency, welght£a&quot;!? &quot;  
fures of the United States, is an obtest r,gJ*lv  
importance, and will, lam persuaded, be duly  
attended to.  
  
The advancement of agriculture, commerce,  
and manufactures, by all proper means, will not,  
I trull, need recommendation. But I cannot for­  
bear intimating to you the expediency of giving  
effectual encouragement as well to the introduc­  
tion of new and ufeful inventions from abroad,  
as to the exertions of Jkil 1 and genius in produ­  
cing them at home ; and of facilitating the in­  
tercourse between the distant parts of our coun­  
try by a due attention to the Post- Office and  
Post-Roads.  
Nor am I less persuaded, that you will agree  
with me in opinion,that there is nothing, which  
can better deserve ycur patronage, than the pro­  
motion of Science and Literature. Knowledge  
is in every country the surest balls of public hap­  
piness. In one, in which the measures of govern­  
ment receive their impression so immediately f&#x27; °ni  
the sense of the community, as in our&#x27;s, it is  
proportionably essential. To the security ot a  
free Constitution it contributes in various ways:  
By convincing those, who are entrusted with the  
public administration, that every valuable end of  
government is belt answered by the enlightened  
confidence of the people : And by teaching the  
people tliemfelves to know, and to value their  
own rights ; to discern and provide againlt: mva­  
fions of them ; to diftinguiffi between oppreihon  
and the necefl&#x27;ary exercise of lawful authority ;  
between burthens proceeding from a dtfregard  
to their convenience, and thoie resulting  
the inevitable exigencies of society ; to difcrinu  
nate the spirit of liberty from that of licentious­  
ness, cherilhing the firft, avoiding the last, and  
uniting afpeedy, but temperate vigilance againlt  
encroachments, with an inviolable refpe&lt;st to the  
laws •  
Whether this desirable objeift will be belt pro­  
moted by affording aids to seminaries of learning  
already eftabliffied, by the institution of a nation­  
al university, or by any other expedients, will  
be well worthy of a place in the deliberations of  
the Legislature.  
Gentlemen of the House oj Representatives.  
I SAW with peculiar pleasure, at the close of  
the last session, the resolution entered into by  
vou exprelfive of your opinion, that an adequate  
provision for the fupportof the public credit, is a  
matter of high importance to the national honor  
and prosperity.—In this sentiment.l entirely con­  
cur.-And to a perfect confidence in your_ best  
endeavors to devise such a prov,fion, as will be  
truly consistent with the end, I add an re­  
liance on the chearful co-operatjon of the other  
branch of the Legiflature—lt would be fuperflu­  
ous to fpecify inducements to a measure in which  
the character and permanent &gt;»tel,efts of the  
United States are so obviously and so deeply con­  
cerned ; and which has received so explicit a  
faniftion from your declaration.  
Gentlemen of the Senate, and  
House of Representatives.  
I HAVE directed the proper officers to lay be­  
fore you refpeiftively such papers and elhmates  
as regard the affairs particularly recommended  
to your confutation, and neceflary to convey  
to you that information of the state of ihe union,  
which it is my duty to afford. , .  
The welfare of onr country is the great objedt  
to which our cares and efforts ought to be diredt

FELLOW-CITIZENSof the SENATE,  
and HOUSE o/ REPRESENTATIVLES.  
EMBRACE with great fatisfaétion  
I the opportunity, which now presents  
itfelf, of congratulating you on the pre­  
sent favorable profpeéts of our public af­  
fairs. &#x27;The recent acceflion of the im­  
portant state of North-Carolina to the  
Constitution of the United States (of  
which official information has been re­  
ceived)—the rising credit and refpetta­  
bility of our country—the general and  
increasing good-will towards the govern­  
ment of the union, and the concord,  
peace and plenty, with which we are  
blessed, are circumstances, auspicious in  
an eminent degree to our nationzl pros­  
perity.  
In resuming your consultations for the  
general good, you cannot but derive  
encouragement from the refleflion, that  
the measures of the last feflion have been  
as fatisfactory to vour constituents, as  
the novelty and diflticulty of the work al­  
lowed you to hope.—Still further tore­  
alize their expe@ations, and to secure  
the blessings which a gracious Provi­  
dence has placed within our reach, will  
in the course of the present important  
feflion, call for the cool and deliberate  
exertion! of your patriotism, firmnefs,  
and witdom.  
the many interciting objefls,  
1 engage your attention, that  
for the common defence  
particular regard.—Ta be  
war is one of the mioft i  
of preserving peacw  
  
A free people ought not only to be  
arimed, but disciplined ; to which end a  
uniform and well digested plan is requi­  
site : And their fafety and interest re­  
quire that they should promote such  
manufa&amp;ories, as tend to render them  
independent on others, for eflential,  
particularly for military supplies.  
The proper eftablithment of the troops  
which may be deemed indispensable,  
will be entitled to mature confidération.  
In the arrangements which may be made  
refpeéting it, it will be of importance to  
conciliate the comfortable support of the  
officers and {oldiers, with a due regaid to  
ceconomy.  
There was reason to hope, that the  
pacific measures adopted with regard to  
certain hostile tribes of Indians, would  
have relieved the inhabitants of our  
southern and weitern frontiers from their  
depredations. But you will perceive,  
that the informations contained in the  
papers which I shall dire&amp; to be laid be­  
fore you, (comprehending a communi­  
cation from the Commonwealth of Vir­  
ginia) that we ought to be prepared to  
afford prote@ion to those parts of the  
Union ; and, if neceflary, to punish ag­  
greflors.  
The interest of the United States re­  
quire, that our intercourse with other  
nations shall be facilirated by such pro­  
visions as will enable me to fulfil my du­  
ty in that refpe&amp;t, in the manner, which  
circumstances may render most condu  
cive to the public good : And to this  
end, that the compensations to be made  
to the persons, who may be employed,  
{hould, according to the nature of their  
appointments, be defined by law ; and  
a competent fund designated for defray­  
ing the expences incident o the condu&amp;  
of our foreign affairs.  
Various considerations also render it  
expedient, that the terms on which fo­  
reigners may be adimitted to the rights  
- of Citizens, should be {;eedily afcertain­  
~cd by a uniform rule of naturalization.  
~ Uniformity in the currency, weights  
and measures of the United States, is an  
object of great importance, and will; [  
am persuaded, be duly attended to.  
The advancement of agricultnre, cotn­  
merce, and manufaures, by all proper  
means, will not, I trust, need recom­  
mendation. But I cannot forbear inti­  
mating to you the expediency of giving  
effettual encouragement as well to the  
introduction of new and ufeful inventi­  
ons from abroad, as to the exertions of  
{kill and genius in producing them at  
home ; and of facilitating the inter­  
course between the distant parts of our  
country, by a due attention to the Post-  
Ofhce and Poit-Roads.  
Nor am I less persuaded that you will  
agree with me in opinion, that there is  
nothing, which can better deserve your  
patronage, than the promotion of Sci­  
ence and Literature. Knowledge is in  
every country the surest basis of public  
happiness. In one, in which the mea­  
sures of government receive their im­  
preflion {o immediately from the sense  
of the community, as in ours, it is pro­  
portionably eflential. To the security  
of a free Coftitution it contributes in  
various ways : By convincing those, who  
arc entrusted with the public administra­  
tion, that every valuable end of govern­  
ment is best an{wered by the enlighten­  
ed confidence of the people : And by  
teaching the people themielves to know,  
and to value their own rights ; to dis­  
cern and provide against invasions of  
them ; to distinguish between oppreflion  
and the neceflary exercise of lawful au­  
thority ; between burthens proceeding  
from a disregard to their convenience,  
and those resulting from the inevitable  
exigencies of society ; to discriminate  
the {pirit of liberty from that of licenti­  
ousness, cherithing the firft, avoiding the  
last, and uniting a speedy, but temperate  
vigilance againit encroachments, with  
an inviolable refpeét to the laws.  
Whether this desirable objeét will be  
the best promoted by affording aids to  
seminaries of learning already eftablithed  
by the institution of a national universi­  
ty, or by any other expedients, will be  
well worthy of a place in the delibera­  
tions of the Legislature.  
Gentlemen of the Houje of Reprefintatioves.  
I SAW with peculiar pleasure, at the  
close of the last feflion, the resolution en­  
tered into by you, expreflive of your

towards the goveiiiment of the uriion, and the!  
concord, peace and plenty, with which we  
are bltlfed, arecircumltances, aufpicious in an  
eminent degree to our national profperity. 1  
In reluming your confutations Tor the gene

frojn the reflcdtion, that th meafures of the

work allowed you to hope. Still further to re­  
alize their expectations, and to Tecure; the bled-ings  
which a gracious JPiovidence has placed  
within our reach, will, in the courfe of the  
prefent important Tetlion, call for the cool an, d  
deliberate exertion of your patriotiim, firmnei&#x27;s

- Among the many interelting objafls, which  
will engage your attention, that of providing  
for the common defence will merit particular  
regard. ; rTo b prepared for war is&#x27; one of the.

importance to conciliate the comfortable fup­

will agree with me in opinion, that there is no­  
thing which can better deserve yonr patronage

Knowledge, is in every country the surest bafisof  
public happinefs—ln one, in which the meafcires  
bf government receive their impreflion so imme­  
diately from the fetife or the community asin ours,  
it is proportionably eflential. To the security  
of a free state it contributes in various ways :  
By convincing those who are entrusted with the  
public adminiltration, that every valuable end of  
government is best answered by the enlightened  
confidence of the people: And by teaching the  
people tlieinfelves to know, and to value their  
own rights ; to discern, and provide against inva­  
sions of them j to distinguish between opprellioii,  
and the necellary exercise of lawful authority ;  
between burthens proceeding from a disregard  
to their convenience, and those resulting from&#x27;  
the inevitable exigencies of fociety,to discriminate  
the spirit of liberty from that of licentiousness,  
■ cherishing the firlt, avoiding the last, and uniting  
a fpeedy,but temperate vigilance against encroach­  
ments, with an inviolable respect to the laws.  
Whether this desirable object will be best pro­  
moted by affording aids to seminaries of learning  
already eftabliflied, by the institution of a nation­

Fellow citizens of the fenate and houje of reprejentatives,  
  
EMBKACE, with great fatisfaction, the opportunity, which now prefeuts  
I itfelf, ef congratulating you on the preient favourable prefpects of our public  
attairs. The recent acceffion of the important ftate of North Carolina to the  
conititution of the united ftates (of which official information has been received  
—the rifing credit and refpe&amp;tability of our country—the general and imeresim 5  
good-will towards the government of the union—and the concord, peace, ani  
plenty, with which we are bleffed, are circumiftances, aulpicious, in an eminent  
degree, to our national profperity.  
  
In refuming your confuitations for the general good, you cannot bat derive ev  
couragement from the reflexion, that the meatures of the lait teflon have bee 1 ab  
fatisfactory to your conftituents, as the novelty and difficulty of the work allowed  
you to hope, Stil turther to realize their expectations, and to fccure the bletii ags,  
which a gracious providence has placed within our reach, will, in the courle ot  
the prefent important feflion, call for the cool and deliberate exertion of your pa-  
triotifm, firmneis, and wifdom.  
  
Among the many interefting objects, which will engage your attention, that ot  
providing for the common defence, will merit particular regard. — Po be prepared  
tor war, is one of the moft effectual means of preferving peace.  
  
A free people ought not only to be armed, but difciplined : to which end an  
uniform and well-digefted plan is requifite : and their fafety and intereit require,  
that they fhould promote fuch manufaétories, as tend to render then indepeadeat  
on others, for eflential, particularly for military {upplies.  
  
The proper eitablifhment of the troops, which may be deemed indifpenfable, will  
be entitled to mature confideration. In the arrangements which may be made re-  
fpefting it, it will be of importance to conciliate the comfortable tupport of the  
officers and foldiers with a due regard to economy.  
  
There was reafon to hope, that the pacific mealures, adopted with regard to cer-  
tain holtile tribes of Indians, would have relieved the ial vitants of our fouthe,  
and weitern frontiers from their depredations. But you will pweeive, from th  
information contained in the papers, which I fhail direct to be laid before yor  
(comprehending a communication from the commonwealth of Virgniia) that  
ought to be prepared to we protection to thole parts of the union—and, it  
ceflary, to punifh aggreffo:  
  
The intereft of the pea ftates requires, that our intercourfe with other na  
tions fhall be facilitated by fuch provifions, as will enable me to fulfil ny duty in  
that reipect, in the manner, which circumitances may render moit conducive to  
the public good; and to this end, that the compentati ons to be made to the per-  
fons, who may be em; ployed, fhould, accoi ding to the nature of their appoint.  
ments, be defined by how; 3 anda competent fund defignated for defrayin  
pentes incident to the conduét of our foreiga affairs,  
  
Various contiderations alfo rewder it expedient, that the terms, on Waich fo-  
veigners may be admitted to the rights of citizens, fhould be ‘pee!ily aiccrtaincs  
by an uniform rule of naturalization.  
  
Unitormity in the currency, weights, and meafures of the united ftates, is au  
object of great importance; and will, I am perfuaded, be duly attended :  
  
‘The advancement of agriculture, commerce, and manutactures, by al!  
meays, will not, I truit, need recommendation. Lut [ cannot forbear intiuating  
to you the expediency of giving effectual encouragement, as weil to the iciodu  
tion of new and ufetul inventions from abroad, as to the exertions ef tkill and  
genius, in producing them at home; and of facilitating the mtcrcouile between  
tue diftant parts of our couatry, by a due attention to the polt office and puit roid

42] APPENDIX N.—PUBLIC PAPERS. [Amer. Muf.  
  
Nor am T lefs perfurded, that you will agree with me in opinion, that there is  
a, which can better deferve your patronage, than the promotion of fcience  
ature. Knowledge is, in every country, the fureft bafis of public hap-  
Jn one, in which the mealures of government receive their impreffion fo  
yn.cdiately from the fenfe of the community, as in our’s, it is proportionably ef-  
fential. Tothe fecusity of a free conititution, it contributes in various ways—  
by convincing thofe, who are entrufted with the public adminiiiration, that every  
valuable end of government is Left antwered by the enlightened confidence of the  
yeo} le—and by teaching the people themielves, to know and to value their own  
ri: “hts ; ; to dilcern and provide againft invafions of them ; to diflinguith between  
oppreffion and the r ecéllary exercile of lawful authority ; ; &quot; tennies burdens pre-  
—— from a difregard to their convenience, and thofe refuliting from the inevi-  
table exigencies of fociety ; to difcriminate the f{pirit of liberty from that of li-  
cent ioutnefs—charithing he fir, avoiding the laft, and uniting a {peedy, but tem-  
perate vigilance agsinit encroachments, with an inviclable reipedct to the laws.  
  
Whother this defirable objeét will be the bef promoted by affording aids to fe.  
minerics of learning already eftablifhed, by the inftitution of a national univerfi-  
ty, or by any other expedients, will be well worthy of a place in the deliberations  
oi the legifiacure.  
  
Gentiemen of the boufe of reprefentatives,  
  
I SAW, with peculiar plealure, at the clofe of the latt feffion, the refolution  
entered into by you, expreflive of your opinion, that an adequate provifion for the  
fupport of the public credit, is a matter of high importance to ‘he national honour  
and p ulperity. In this fentiment, I entirely concur. And to a perfeé confi-  
dence iin your befi endeavours to devife {uch a provition, as will be truly confif-  
  
tent with the end, I add an equal reliance on the chearful co-operation of the  
ether branch of the legiflature.  
  
ae AG Te anne  
  
It would be fuperfluous, to ipecily inducements  
to a meafure, in which the characler and permanent interefts of the united ftates  
ave fo obvioufly and to deeply concerned; and which has received fo explicit a  
fanction trom your declaration.  
  
Gentlemen of the fenate and houfe of reprefentatives,  
  
TLAVE aireéied the proper officers to lay before you refpeétively fuch papers  
anc eftin ates, as regard to affairs particularly recommended to your confideration,  
and neceliary to convey to you that information of the flate of the union, which it  
is my duty to afford.  
  
The welfare of our r country is the great obje&amp;t to which our cares and efforts  
ought tobe dire&amp;ted. And TI thall cerive great fatisfaétion from a co-operation  
with you, in the pleafing, though arduous tafk, of infuring to our fellow citizens  
the bicflings, which they have a right to expeét, from a free, efficient, and equal  
governnent. GEORGE WASHINGTON

“Nor am I less persuaded that you will agree  
with me in opinion, that there is nothing which can  
better deserve your patronage than the promotion of  
science and literature. Knowledge is in every  
country the surest basis of public happiness. In one  
in which the measures of government receive their  
impressions so immediately from the sense of the  
community as in ours, it is proportionably essential.  
To the security of a free constitution it contributes  
in various ways: by convincing those who are in-  
trusted with the public administration that every  
valuable end of government is best answered by the  
enlightened confidence of the people, and by teach-

of them, to distinguish between oppression and the  
necessary exercise of lawful authority, between  
burdens proceeding from a disregard to their con-  
venience, and those resulting from the inevitable  
exigencies of society, to discriminate the spirit of  
liberty from that of licentiousness, cherishing the  
first, avoiding the last, and uniting a speedy but  
temperate vigilance against encroachments with an  
inviolable respect to the laws. Whether this desirable  
object will be best promoted by affording aids to  
seminaries of learning already established, by the  
institution of a national university, or by any other  
expedients, will be well worthy of a place in the de-

to be armed, but disciplined ; to which end, a uniform and well-digested  
plan is requisite—and their safety and interest require that they should  
promote such manufactories as tend to render them independent on others

thing which can belter deserve your prtron­  
age than the promotion of science and lite­  
rature. Knowledge is in every country  
the surest basis of public happiness. In  
one in which the measures of government  
receive their impressions so immediately  
from the sense of the community as in ours,  
it is proportionality essential. To the se­  
curity of a free constitution it contributes  
in various ways; by convincing those who  
are intrusted with the public administration  
that every valuable end of government is  
best answered by the enlightened confidence  
of a people ; and by teaching the people  
themselves to know and to value their own  
rights; to discern and to provide against  
invasions of them ; to distinguish between  
oppression and the necessary exercise of  
lawful authority; between burdens proceed­  
ing from a disregard to their convenience  
and those resulting from the inevitable exi­  
gencies of society; to discriminate the spi­  
rit of liberty from that of licentiousness—  
cherishing the first, aviding the last, and  
uniting a speedy but temperate vigilance

“uniformity in the currency, weights and measures;” “the

and useful inventions from abroad, as to the exertions of skill and  
genius in producing them at home;” “facilitating the intercourse

Nor am I less persuaded, that you will agree with me in opinion, that there  
is nothing which can better deserve your patronage than the promotion of sci-  
ence and literature. Knowledge is in every country the. surest basis of public  
happiness. In one, in which the measures of government receive their impres-  
sion so immediately from the sense of the community, as in ours, it is propor-  
tionably essential. To the security of a free constitution it contributes in  
various ways; by convincing those who are intrusted with the public adminis-  
tration, that every valuable end of government is best answered by the enlight-  
ened confidence of the people; and by teaching the people themselves to know  
and to value their own rights; to discern and provide against invasions of  
them ; to distinguish between oppression and the necessary exercise of lawful  
authority, between burdens proceeding from a disregard to their convenience  
and those resulting from the inevitable exigencies of society ; to discriminate  
the spirit of liberty from that of licentiousness, cherishing the first, avoiding  
the last, and uniting a speedy but temperate vigilancé against encroachments,  
with an inviolable respect for the laws.

rious ways-by convincing those who are  
d with the public administration  
that every valuable end of government  
is best answered by the enlightened con  
fidence of the people, and by teaching  
the people themselves to know and value  
their own rights; to discern and provide  
against invasions of them; to distit  
between oppression and the ne  
exercise of lawful authority; between  
burdens proceeding from a disregard to  
their convenience, and those resulting  
from the inevitable exigencies of socic.­

encroachments with an inviolable respect

sels has been sometimes urged by men  
who have not sufficiently considered the  
changes in conditions which a century  
of National progress has brought~about.  
The first Annual Address appears to us  
equally worthy of consideration, and some  
of its recommendations equally worthy of  
the Nation’s consideration. Brief as it is  
in comparison with the modern document-  
ary histories issued under the title of  
Presidential Message, it is too long to be  
printed here in full, and we content our-  
selves with reproducing certain of its  
recommendations which are not untimely  
even in 1899:  
  
Among the many interesting objects which  
will engage your attention, that of providing  
for the common defense will merit particular  
  
regard. To be prepared for war is one of the  
most effectual means of preserving peace.  
  
A free people ought not only to be armed,  
but disciplined, to which end a uniform and  
well-digested plan is requisite ; and their safety  
and interest require that they should promote  
such manufactories as tend to render them  
independent of others for essential, particularly  
military, supplies.  
  
The proper establishment of the troops which  
may be deemed indispensable will be entitled  
to mature consideration. In the arrangements  
  
which may be made respecting it, it will be of  
importance to conciliate the comfortable sup-  
port of the officers and soldiers with a due  
regard to economy. . .  
  
The interests of the United States require  
that our intercourse with other nations should
