ble to do so.  
Subsequently Jefferson was informed that  
there was not a man in Cuba who favored  
its becoming a British colony, and that  
their choice was independence, or annexa­  
tion by the United States or Mexico. On  
the strength of this information Jefferson  
wrote another letter to President Monroe  
in which he said:  
I had supposed England&#x27;s interest there  
quite as strong as that of the United  
States, and therefore, to avoid war and  
keep the island open to our own commerce.  
It would he best to join that power in mu­  
tually guaranteeing its independence, but  
if there is no danger of its falling into the  
possession of England I must retract an  
opinion founded on an error of fact. We  
are surely under no obligation to give her  
gratis an interest which she has not, and  
the whole inhabitants being averse to her  
and the climate mortal to strangers its con­  
tinued military occupation by her would be  
impossible. It is better, then, to lie still in  
readiness to receive that interesting incor­  
poration when notified by herself. For cer­  
tainly her addition to our confederacy is  
exactly what is wanting to round our  
power as a nation to the point of its utmost  
interest
