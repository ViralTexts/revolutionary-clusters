London Augt. 19: 1772  
In yours of May 14th, you acquaint me with your indisposition, which gave me great concern. The resolution you have taken to use more exercise is extremely proper, and I hope you will steadily perform it. It is of the greatest importance to prevent diseases; since the cure of them by physic is so very precarious. In considering the different kinds of exercise, I have thought that the quantum of each is to be judged of, not by time or by distance, but by the degree of warmth it produces in the body: Thus when I observe if I am cold when I get into a carriage in a morning, I may ride all day without being warmed by it, that if on horse back my feet are cold, I may ride some hours before they become warm; but if I am ever so cold on foot, I cannot walk an hour briskly, without glowing from head to foot by the quickened circulation; I have been ready to say, (using round numbers without regard to exactness, but merely to mark a great difference) that there is more exercise in one mile’s riding on horseback, than in five in a coach; and more in one mile’s walking on foot, than in five on horseback; to which I may add, that there is more in walking one mile up and down stairs, than in five on a level floor. The two latter exercises may be had within doors, when the weather discourages going abroad; and the last may be had when one is pinched for time, as containing a great quantity of exercise in a handful of minutes. The dumb bell is another exercise of the latter compendious kind; by the use of it I have in forty swings quickened my pulse from 60 to 100 beats in a minute, counted by a second watch: And I suppose the warmth generally increases with quickness of pulse.

Lonpon, August 19, 1772.  
  
In yours of May l4th, you acquaint me with your indisposition,  
which gave me great concern. The resolution you have taken to use  
more exercise is extremely proper; and I hope you will steadily per-  
form it. It is of the greatest importance to prevent diseases, since the  
cure of them by physic is so very precarious. In considering the dif-  
ferent kinds of exercise, I have thought that the quantum of each is to  
be judged of, not by time or by distance, but by the degree of warmth it  
produces in the body; thus, when I observe if I am cold when I get  
into a carriage in a morning, I may ride all day without being warmed  
by it; that if on horseback my feet are cold, I may ride some hours  
before they become warm; but if I am ever so cold on foot, I cannot  
walk an hour briskly without glowing from head to foot by the quick-  
ened circulation; I have been ready to say (using round numbers with-  
out regard to exactness, but merely to make a great difference) that  
there is more exercise in one mile&#x27;s riding on horseback, than in five  
in a coach; and more in one mile’s walking on foot, than in five on  
horseback; to which I may add, that there is more in walking one mile  
up and down stairs, than in five on a level floor. The two latter exer-  
cises may be had within doors, when the weather discourages going  
abroad; and the last may be had when one is pinched for time, as con-  
taining a great quantity of exercise ina handful of minutes. The dumb  
bell is another exercise of the latter compendious kind; by the use of  
it I have in forty swings quickened my pulse from sixty to one hun-  
dred beats in a minute, counted by a second watch; and I suppose the  
warmth generally increases with quickness of pulse. B. FRrankiin

LoNDOn, 19 August, 1772  
Dear SON: In yours of May 14 you acquaint  
me with your indisposition, which gives me  
great concern. The resolution you have taken  
to use more exercise is extremely proper, and I  
hope you will steadily perform it. It is of the  
greatest importance to prevent diseases, since  
the curing of them by physic is so very pre­  
carious.  
In considering the different kinds of exercise  
I have thought that the quantum of each is to  
be judged-of, not by time or by distance, but by  
the degree of warmth it produces in the body,  
Thus, when I observe that I am cold when I  
get into a carriage in a morning, I may ride all  
day without being warmed by it; that if on  
horseback my feet are cold, I may ride some  
hours before they become warm. But, if I am  
ever so cold on foot, I cannot walk an hour  
briskly without glowing from head to foot with  
a quickened circulation. I have been ready to  
say (using round numbers without regard to  
exactness, but merely to make a great differ.­  
ence that there is more exercise in one mile&#x27;s  
riding on horseback than in five in a coach  
and more in one mile&#x27;s walking on foot  
than in five on horseback; to which I  
may add that there is more in walking  
one mile up and down stairs than in five on a  
level floor. The two latter exercises may be  
had within doors when the weather discourages  
going abroad, and the latter may be had when  
one is pinched for time, as giving a great quan­  
tity of exercise in a handful of minutes. The  
dumb-bell is another exercise of the latter  
compendious kind. By the use of it I have  
in forty swings quickened my pulse from sixty  
to one hundred beats in a minute, counted by  
a second watch; and I suppose the warmth  
generally increases with the quickness of pulse.

tunities for outdoor exercise are greater for some of us  
  
at this season than any other; and it is a matter of  
  
which we know 20 little, and one in which there is  
  
great diversity of opinion, that the opinion of a wise

SEN ERARKEIN TOOK ExERCISE.  
He Believed It More Efficacious  
Than Medicine.  
At a time when so much attention is  
given to physical education it is of in­  
terest to remember that Benjamin Frank­  
lin told John Adams that he made it a  
point of religion to exercise, says an ex­  
change. When sixty-six years old Frank­  
lin wrote to his son as follows:  
&quot;Exepcise to cure diseases, since the  
curs of them by physic is so precarious.  
&quot;The quantum of each kind of exercise  
is to be judged by the degree of warmth  
it produces in the body, rather than by  
the time or distance.  
&quot;There is more exercise in one mile&#x27;s  
riding on horseback than five in a coach;  
and more in one mile&#x27;s walking on foot  
than in five on horseback; more in walk-  
ing one mile up and down stairs than in  
four on a level floor.  
&quot;This last may be had when one is  
pinched for time, as containing a great  
uantity of exercise in a handful of min­  
ute. The dumbbell is another exercise of  
the latter compendious kind; by the use  
of it I have in forty swings quickened  
my pulse from 60 to 100 beats in a minute,  
counted by a second watch, and I suppose  
the warmth generally increases with  
quickness of pulse.&quot;
