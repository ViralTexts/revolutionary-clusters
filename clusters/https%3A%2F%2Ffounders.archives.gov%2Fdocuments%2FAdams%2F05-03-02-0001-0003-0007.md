Law, no Passion can disturb. Tis void of Desire and Fear, Lust and Anger. Tis Mens Sine affectu, written Reason, retaining Some Measure of divine Perfection. It does not enjoin that which pleases a weak, frail Man, but without any Regard to Persons, commands that which is good, and punishes evil in all whether rich or poor, high or low.
