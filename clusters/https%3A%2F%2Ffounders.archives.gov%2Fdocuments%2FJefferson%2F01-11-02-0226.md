rank with you as my next friend: I hardly know how to estimate the goodness of the Marquis la Fayette to me, but I think a french nobleman of the first character in his country never did more to serve an obscure citizen of another than the Marquis has done for me: and I am as sure that it is impossible (without some kind of soul made express for the purpose) that an obscure citizen in such a situation can be more gratefull than I am: may he be told so and with my Compliments to his Lady.

I cannot tell you by what means I came to Petersbourg, and hardly know by what means I shall quit it in the further prossecution of my tour round the world by Land: if I have any merit in the affair it is perseverence, for most severely have I been buffeted, and yet still am I even more obstinate than before—and fate as obstinate continues her assaults. How the matter will terminate I know not: the most probable Conjecture is that I shall Succeed, and be kicked round the world as I have hitherto been from England thro Denmark, thro Sweeden, thro Sweedish lapland, Sweedish finland and the most unfrequented parts of Russian finland to this Aurora Borealis of a City. I cannot give you a history of myself since I saw you, or since I wrote you last: however abridged, it would be too long: upon the whole, mankind have used me well, and tho I have as yet reached only the first stage of my journey, I feel myself much indebted to that urbanity which I always thought more general than many think it to be, and was it not for the villianous laws and bad examples of some Governments I have passed thro, I am persuaded that I should have been able to have given you still better accounts of our fellow creatures.  
But I am hastning to those countries where goodness if natural to the human heart will appear independant of example and furnish an Annecdote of the character of man not unworthy the attention of him who wrote the declaration of American Independence.
