My children. White-hairs, Chiefs &amp; Warriors of the Osage nation.  
July 16. 04  
  
I repeat to you assurances of the satisfaction it has given me to recieve you here. besides the labour of such a journey, the confidence you have shewn in the honor &amp; friendship of my countrymen is peculiarly gratifying and I hope you have seen that your confidence was justly placed, that you have found yourselves, since you crossed the Missisipi, among brothers &amp; friends, with whom you were as safe as at home.  
My children. I sincerely weep with you over the graves of your chiefs &amp; friends, who fell by the hands of their enemies lately descending the Osage river. had they been prisoners, &amp; living, we would have recovered them: but no voice can awake the dead; no power undo what is done. on this side the Missisipi where our government has been long established, and our authority organised our friends visiting us are safe. we hope it will not be long before our voice will be heard and our arm respected, by those who meditate to injure our friends, on the other side of that river. in the mean time Governor Harrison will be directed to take proper measures to enquire into the circumstances of the transaction, to report them to us for consideration, and for the further measures they may require.  
My children. By late arrangements with France &amp; Spain, we now take their place as your neighbors, friends and fathers: and we hope you will have no cause to regret the change. it is so long since our forefathers came from beyond the great water, that we have lost the memory of it, and seem to have grown out of this land, as you have done. never more will you have occasion to change your fathers. we are all now of one family, born in the same land, &amp; bound to live as brothers; &amp; the strangers from beyond the great water are gone from among us. the great Spirit has given you strength, and has given us strength; not that we might hurt one another, but to do each other all the good in our power. our dwellings indeed are very far apart; but not too far to carry on commerce &amp; useful intercourse. you have furs and peltries which we want, and we have clothes and other useful things which you want. let us employ ourselves then in mutually accomodating each other. to begin this on our part it was necessary to know what nations inhabited the great country called Louisiana, which embraces all the water of the Missisipi and Missouri, what number of peltries they could furnish, what quantities &amp; kinds of merchandize they would require, where would be the deposits most convenient for them, and to make an exact map of all those waters. for this purpose I sent a beloved man, Capt Lewis, one of my own houshold to learn something of the people with whom we are now united, to let you know we were your friends, to invite you to come and see us, and to tell us how we can be useful to you. I thank you for the readiness with which you have listened to his voice, and for the favor you shewed him in his passage up the Missouri. I hope your countrymen will favor and protect him as far as they extend. on his return we shall hear what he has seen &amp; learnt, &amp; proceed to establish trading houses where our red brethren shall think best, &amp; to exchange commodities with them on terms with which they will be satisfied.  
With the same views I had prepared another party to go up the Red river to it’s source, thence to the source of the Arkansa, &amp; down it to it’s mouth. but I will now give orders that they shall only go a small distance up the red river this season, and return to tell us what they have seen, and that they shall not set out for the head of that river till the ensuing spring, when you will be at home, and will I hope guide and guard them in their journey. I also propose the next year to send another small party up the river of the Kansas to it’s source, thence to the head of the river of the Panis, and down to it’s mouth; and others up the rivers on the North side of the Missouri. for guides along these rivers we must make arrangements with the nations inhabiting them.  
  
My children. I was sorry to learn that a schism had taken place in your nation, and that a part of your people had withdrawn with the Great-track, to the Arkansa river. we will send an Agent to them and will use our best offices to prevail on them to return, and to live in union with you. we wish to make them also our friends, and to make that friendship, and the weight it may give us with them, useful to you and them.  
We propose, my children, immediately to establish an Agent to reside with you, who will speak to you our words, and convey yours to us: who will be the guardian of our peace and friendship, convey truths from the one to the other, dissipate all falsehoods which might tend to alienate and divide us, and maintain a good understanding &amp; friendship between us. as the distance is too great for you to come often and tell us your wants, you will tell them to him on the spot, and he will convey them to us in writing, so that we shall be sure that they come from you. through the intervention of such an Agent we shall hope that our friendship will forever be preserved. no wrong will ever be done you by our nation, and we trust that yours will do none to us: and should ungovernable individuals commit unauthorised outrage on either side, let them be duly punished; or if they escape, let us make to each other the best satisfaction the case admits, and not let our peace be broken by bad men. for all people have some bad men among them whom no laws can restrain.  
As you have taken so long a journey to see your fathers, we wish you not to return till you shall have visited our country &amp; towns towards the sea coast. this will be new and satisfactory to you, and it will give you the same knowledge of the country on this side the Missisipi, which we are endeavoring to acquire of that on the other side, by sending trusty persons to explore them. we propose to do in your country only what we are desirous you should do in ours. we will provide accomodations for your journey, for your comfort while engaged in it, and for your return in safety to your own country, carrying with you those proofs of esteem with which we distinguish our friends, and shall particularly distinguish you. on your return tell your people that I take them all by the hand, that I become their father hereafter, that they shall know our nation only as friends and benefactors; that we have no views upon them but to carry on a commerce useful to them and us; to keep them in peace with their neighbors, that their children may multiply, may grow up &amp; live to a good old age, and their women no longer fear the tomahawk of any enemy.  
My children. These are my words. carry them to your nation. keep them in your memories, and our friendship in your hearts. and may the Great Spirit look down upon us, &amp; cover us with the mantle of his love.

I repeat to you aflurances *»f tiie fa­  
tiifaftYion it ha* given me to recjive  
you here. Befides the labor of fuch a  
journey, the confidence you have fhewu  
in the honor and friendlhlD of my coun­  
trymen is peculiarly gratifying, and I  
hope you have f.*en that your confidence  
was juftly placed, that you have found  
ynurfeivet, fince you doffed the Mif­  
fi flip pi, among brothers and fiend*  
with whom you were as fafe as  
at home.  
My Children. 1 fincerely with  
you over the graves of your chief* and  
friends, whi fell by the bands of their  
enemies lately defending the Ofage ri­  
ver. Had they been prifoners, and living,  
we would have recovered them : but  
no voice can awake the dead, no pow­  
er undo what is done ;on this file of  
the M.fliffippi where our government  
has been long eftablifhed, and our au­  
thority organifed our friends vifiting  
us -oe fafe. We hope it will not be long  
before our v ice will be heard and our  
arm refpected, by thofe who meditate  
to injure our friends, on ths other fide  
of that river ; in the mean time Cover- j  
nor H?rrifon will be directed to t;;kr I  
proper meafur-&#x27;s to inquire into the cir- i  
cumft inces of the tranfaration, to report  
them to v. for confi deration and for the  
further meafures they may nqnire.  
My Children : By lcte an augeinents  
with France and Spain, we now take  
their pi ic* as your neighbours, friei d?  
and fathers ; and we hope you will have  
na caufe to regret the change. It is lo j  
long lince our forefathers came from  
b-yond the great water, that we have ,  
loft the memory ot it, and ie_m to have  
grown out of this lan), as you have  
done ; never more, will you have occa­  
fion to change yr&gt;ur fathers. VVe are  
all now of one family, born in the  
fame land, and bound to live as bro­  
thers, and trie ftrauger3 from beyond  
the great water are gone frojj among  
us, the great Spirit has given you  
ftrength, and has given us ftrength ; not  
that we might hurt one another, but to  
do each other all the goori in our pow­  
er. Our dwellings indeed are very far a­  
part; but not too far to carry on com­  
merce and ufeful intercourse. V v have  
furs and peltries which we want, and  
we have clothes and other ufeful thing*  
that you want ; let us employ ourfclves  
then in mutually accommodating each  
other. To begin this on our part, it  
wa* necefTary to know what nations in­  
habited the great country called L.ui&#x27;ia­  
na, which embraces all the wateis of  
the Miffiffippiand MifTouri, what num­  
ber of peltries they could furnifh, what  
quantities and kinds of merchar.d&#x27;z­  
they would require, where would be the  
depofits moft convenient for them, and  
to make an exact map of all thefe waters.  
For this purpofe I fent a beloved man,  
Capt. Lewis, one of my own houfehold,  
to learn fome.thing of the people with  
whom we are now united, to let you  
know we were your friends, to invite you  
to come and fee us, and to tell us how  
we can be ufeful to you. I thank you  
for the teadinefs with which you have  
liftened to hi* voice, and for the favor  
you fhewed him in his paffage up the  
MifTouri. I hope your Countrymen will  
favor and proteft him as far as they ex­  
tend. On his return we fhall hear  
what he has feen and learnt, and proceed  
to eftablifh trading houfes where our red  
fhall think beft, and to ex­  
change commodities with them on terms  
wi&#x27;h which they will be fa&#x27;isfied.  
With the fame view* I had prepared  
another party to go up the Red river to  
&#x27; its fource, thence to the fource  
lof the Arkanfa, and down to its  
mouth, but I will now give or­  
der* that they fhall only go a fmall  
diftance un the Red river this feafon,  
and return to tell us what they have  
feen, and that they fhall not fet out for  
the bead of that river till the enfuing  
faring, when you will be at home, and  
will, I hope, guide and guard them on  
their journey. I alfo propofe the next  
year to fend another fmall party up the  
river Kanfas to its fource, thence to the  
head of the river of the Panis, ar-ddown  
jto its mouth, and others no the river on  
the North fide of -he MifLuri. Fir  
I guides along thefe river* we muft mike  
! arrangements with the nations inhabit­  
ing them.  
M) Children : I waa firry to learn  
that a fchilm had taken place in your  
nation, and that a part of your peopls  
had withdrawn with the great track, to  
■ the Arkanfa river, we will fend an a­  
• gent to them and will ufe our btft ofhV.-j  
| o prevail on them to return* and to live  
  
,in union with you. We wifli ti m&lt;ke  
thin alfo our t lends, and &#x27;o make th &gt;t  
fi n.ilhip, and the weight it may give  
us with them, ufeful t&lt;» y»u ar.d th^m.  
We prop-die, my children,tmme_iate­  
ly to eftablifh an ag-.nt to refUe &gt;*icii  
y.»u, who will fpeak to you our words,  
and convey years to us ; who will be  
the guirdian of our peace and friendfhip,  
i convey truth* from the. one to the other,  
j diftlpate all falfehoods which might terd  
to alienate and divide us, and maintain  
a good undemanding and friend flip be­  
tween us ; as the diftance is too g»eat for  
you to come oite. and cell us y-ur wants,  
you will tell them to him on the fpot,  
and he will convey them to us in writing,  
fo that we lhall be fure that&#x27; they come  
from you ; throng!, tbe intervention of  
i&#x27;uch an Ag&#x27;-nt, we fhill hope that our  
friendfhip w 11 l&lt; rever be preferved, no  
wrong will eve be done you by our na­

men, for all people have fme bad men  
among them whom no laws can reftraio.  
As you have taken fo long a journey to

[Nat. Initlligtnctr. I  
My Children, White hairs, Chiefs and Warriort  
of the Of age Nation.  
I repeat to you affurances of the fttisf.uftion  
it hnj given me to receive you lure. Bcfides !  
the labor of fuch a journey, the confidence you i  
have fhewn in the honor and friendfliip of my i  
countrymen is peculiarly gratifying, and I hope ■  
you have foen that your confidence was ju/tly  
placed, that you have found yourfelves, fincc  
you eroded the Mididippi, among brothers and  
friends with whom you were as fjfe as at  
home.  
My Children : I fincertly weep with you over  
the graves of your chiefs and friends, who fell  
by the hands of their enemies lately defending  
the Ofage river. Had they been prifoners, and  
living, we would have recovered them : but no  
voice can awake the dead, no power undo what  
is done ; on this fide of the MilTi/lippi where  
our government has been long eftablifhed, and  
our authority organifed, our friends vifiting us  
are fafe. We hope it will not be long before  
our voice will be heard and our arm refpeited,  
by thofe who meditate to injure our friends, on  
the other fide of that river; in the mean time  
Governor Harrifon will be direded to take pro­  
per mcafures to inquire into the circumftances  
of the tranfaltion, to report them to us for  
confederation and for the further mcafures they  
may require.  
My Children: By htc arrangements with  
France and Spain, we now take their place as  
your neighbors, friends and fathers; and We  
hope you will have no caufe to regret the  
change. It is fo long fince our forefat hers came  
from beyond the great water, that we have loft  
the memory of it, and feem to have grown out  
of this land, as you have done ; never more will  
you have occafion to change your fathers. W&lt;  
are all now of one family, born in the fame land,  
and bound fo live as brothers, and the ftranger  
from beyond the great waters are gone from a­  
mongus. The great Spirit has given you ftrengtl  
and has given us ftrength—not that wc  
might hurt one another, hut to do each  
nther all the good in our power. Our dwel­  
lings indeed arc very far apart; but not too  
far to carry on commerce and nfeful intercourse.  
  
You hare Purs and peltries which we want, and  
we have clothes and other ufcfitl things that you  
want ; let us employ ourfelvcs then in mutually  
iccomtnodating each other. To begin this on  
»ur part, it was neceflary to know what nati­  
ons inhabited the great country called Lotfifia­  
rja, which embraces all the waters of the M f­  
iillippi and MifTouri, what number of peltries  
they could funiilh, what quantities and kinds of  
merchandize they would require, where would  
be the depoiits molt convenient for them, and  
to make an exatf map of alt thefe water*, l or  
this purpofe I fent a beloved man,Capt. l ew is,  
one of my own houfehold, to learn fnrr.cthing of  
the people with whom we are now united, to let  
you know we were your friends, to invite you  
to come and fee us, and to tell us how we can be  
ufeful to you. I thank you for the readinefs  
with which you have liftentd to his voice, ai d  
tor the favour you ihewtd him in his paftage up  
the Millburi. I hope your countrymen wa!i fa­  
vor and protect him as far as they extend. C/u  
his return we lhall hear what he has ften and  
learnt, and proceed to eftablilh trading houfes  
where our red brethren lhall think bed, and to  
exchange commodities with them on terms with  
which they will be fatisfied.  
With the fame views I had prepared another  
party to go up the Red river to its fource, thence  
to the fource of the Arkanfa, and down to its  
mouth, but I will now give orders that they lhall  
only go a fmall diftance up the Red river this  
feafon, and return to tell us what they have  
feen, and that they lhall not fet out for the head  
of that river till the enfuing fpring, when you  
will he at home, and will, I hope, guide and  
guard them on their journey. I alfo propofe  
the next year to fend another fmall party up the  
river Kanfas to its fource, thence to the head of  
the river Of the Panis, and down to its mouth,  
and others up the river on the North fide of the  
MifTouri. For guides along thefe rivers we mult  
make arrangements with the nations inhabiting  
them.  
  
my Children : I was forty to learn that a  
fellifin had taken place in your nation, and that  
a part of your people had withdrawn with the  
great track, to the Arkanfa river. We .will feud  
an agent to them and will ufe our belt offices to  
prevail on them to return, and to Jive in union  
with you. We wifli to make them alfj our  
friends, and to make that friendlhip, and the  
weight it may give us with them, ufcfulto you  
and them.  
We propofe, my children, immediately to ef­  
tablifh an agent to relide with you, who will  
fpcak to you our words, and convey yours to  
us; who will be the guardian of our peace and  
friendfhip, convey truths from the one to the o­  
ther, diflipate all fhlfehoods which might tend  
to alienate and divide us, and maintain a good  
undtrftanding and friendlhip between us; as  
the diflance is too great for you to come often Sc  
tell us your wants, you will tell them to him on  
the fpot, and he will convey them to us in wri­  
ting, fo that we will he fu re that they come from  
you; through the intervention of fiich an A­  
gent, we fhall hope that our friendlhip will fore­  
verhe preferved, no wrong will ever be done you  
by our nation, and we trull that yours will do  
none to us ; and Ihould ungovernable individu­  
als commit unauthorifed outrage on either fide,  
let them be duly punifhed ; or if they efeape*  
let us make to each other the beft fatisfac­  
tion the cafe admits, and not let our peace be  
broken by bad men ; for all people have fomc  
bad men among them whom no laws can ref­  
train. As you have taken fo long a journey to  
fee yoUrfathers, we wifh you not to&#x27; retnrn till  
you fhall have vifited our country and towns to­  
wards the fea coafl. This will be new and fatif­  
fadory to you, and it will give you the fame  
knowledge of the country on this fide of the  
MilTiflippi, which we ar« endeavoring to ac­  
quire of that on the other fide, by fending truf­  
ty perfons to explore them. We propofe to do  
in your country only what we are defirous you  
fhould do in ours; we will provide accommo­  
dations for your journey, for your comfort while  
engaged in it, and for your return in fifety to  
your own country, carrying with you t’hofe  
proofs of efteem with which we diflinguifh our  
friends, and fhall particularly diflinguifh you.  
On your return tell your people that I take them  
all by the hand, that I become their father here­  
after, that they fhall kn*w our nation only as  
friends and benefadors ; that we have no views  
upon them hut to carry on a commerce ufeful to  
them and us ; to keep them in peace with their  
neighbors, that their children may multiply,  
may grow up and live to a good old age, and  
their women no longer fear the tomahawk of a­  
ny enemy.  
My children,thefearc my words; carry them  
to your nation, keep them in your memories Sc  
our friendlhip in your hearts; and may the  
Great Spirit look down upon us, and cover us  
with the mantle of his love !

WASHINGTON Cl I’Y, October 3.  
The following is the ADDUCSS late­  
ly delivered by the PttfcSIDCNT of the  
United Slates, to the chiefs ol the Osage  
Nation. Weofferit to the public, with a  
confidence that the sentiments of good  
will it breathes towards the aborigines of  
the soil, will afford as much pleasure to  
the reader, as they confer houur on the  
government.  
My Children, White Hairs, Chiefs and War­  
riors of the Osage Motion.  
I repeat to you assurances of the satis­  
faction it has given me to receive you  
here. Besides the labor of sucli a jour­  
nev. the confidence you li.tve shewn in  
the honor and friendship of my country­  
men is peculiarly gratifying, and I hope ,  
you have seen that your confidence was just­  
ly placed, that you have found yourselves,  
since you crossed the Mississippi, among !  
brothers and friends with whom you were  
as safe as at home.  
Mi; Children: I sincerely weep with  
vou over the graves of your chiefs and &#x27;  
friends, who fell by the hands of iheir e­  
nemie.s lately descending the Osage river.  
Had they been prisoners, and living we  
would have recove’ed them : but no voice  
can awake the dead, no power undo what I  
is done ; on this side of the Mississippi I  
where our government has been long es­  
tablished, and our authority organized our  
friends visiting us are safe. We hope it &#x27;  
w ill not be long before our voice will be &#x27;  
heard and our arm respected, by those!  
who meditate to injure our friends, on the  
other side of the river ; in the mean time j  
P.nvorn/.. I T _ ...Ml I... -I * n I . _ &#x27;  
  
take proper measures to enquire into the  
circumstances of the transaction, to report  
them to us for consideration and for the  
further measures they may require.  
Aft/ Children: Rv late arrangements  
with France and Spain, we now take their  
place as your neighbors, friends and fa­  
thers ; and we hope you will have nocause  
to regret the change. It is so long since  
our forefathers came from beyond the  
great water, that we have lost the metno­  
rv of it. and sp. m to have grown out of  
this lnnd. as you have done ; never more|  
will you hive occasion to change your fa- j  
•hers. We arc all now of one familv, i  
born in the same land, and bound to live  
as brothers, and the strangers from be­  
vond the great water are gone from a­  
mong us, the great Sprit lias given vou  
strength, and has given 11s strength ; not  
hat v.e might hurt one another, bat to  
f,&#x27;&gt; each other all the good in our power.  
Our dwellings indeed are very far apart :  
hut not too far to carry on commerce and  
useful intercouse. You have furs and  
peltries which we want, and we have  
clothes and other useful things that you  
want; let us employ ourselves then in mu­  
tually accommodating each oilier. To  
begin this on our part, it was necessary j  
to know what nations inhabited the great  
country called Louisiana, which embrace s I  
all the waters of the Mississippi and Mis-!  
souri, what number of peltries they could &#x27;  
furnish, what quantities and kind .of mer­  
chandize they would require, where would ]  
be the deposits mo«t convenient for them, j  
and to make an exacl map of all these!  
Witprs. Fnr tliiti nnriinsp f «cnt ?« k«,l,iv_  
  
ed man, Capt. Lewis, one of my own |  
household, to learn something of the peo­  
ple with whom we ere now united, to let i  
you know we are vonr friends, to invite ,  
you to come and see us, and to tell us how  
we can he useful to you. I thank you for«  
the readiness with which you have listen-,  
ed to his voice, and for the favor you shew­  
ed him in his passage up the Missouri. I&#x27;  
hone your countrymen may favor and pro-1  
tefl him as far as they extend. On his I  
return we shall hear what he has seen am! •  
learnt, and proceed to establish trading!  
houses where our red brethren shall think  
hrst, and to exchange commodities with  
them on terms with which they will be  
satisfied.  
With the same views I had prepared  
another party to go up th« Red river to its  
source, thence to the source of the Ar­  
knnsn, and down to its mouth, hut 1 will  
now give orders that thev will only go a !  
small distance up the Red river this sea­  
son, and return to tell us what they have  
sren, and that they shall not set out lor  
the. head of that river till the ensuing  
spring, when you will he at home, and  
will I hope, guide an^ guard them on  
their journey. I also propose the next  
year to send another small party up the  
river Kansas to it*, source, thence to the  
heid of the liver of the Ranis, and down to  
its month, and o lier:, up the river on the  
north side of the Missouri. For guides!  
along these rivers we must tm ke art .ngc­  
menus with the nations inhabiting then&#x27;  
My Children: I was sorry lokarnth.U  
a schism had taken place in your nation,  
and that a pail of your people hid wi.h­  
drawn with a great track to the Arkunsa I  
river, we wiil send an a^&lt; tit to them and  
will trie our iiest olVic.es to prevail on them  
to return, and to live in union with you.  
We wish to make them also tur iVieuds,  
i  
  
and to make that frieiuldiip and the wo.lit  
it may give us with them, useful to you  
and them.  
We {impose, my children, immediately  
to establish an agent to reyide with you.  
who will speak to you our words, and con­  
vey yours to us; who will be the guardi­  
an of pur peace and friendship, convey  
truths from one to the other, dissipate all  
falsehoods which mii*hr- tend to alienate  
and divide us. and maintain a good un­  
derstanding and friendship between us; as  
the dis ante is too great for you to come  
often and tell us your wants, you will tell  
them to lum on the spot, and he will con­  
vey them to us io writing, so that we shall  
be sure that they come from you : through  
the iiitei ven.ion of such an agent, we shall  
hope that our friendship wii! forever bo  
preserved, no wrong will ever be done you  
by our nation, and we trust that your*  
will do none to us ; and should ungovern­  
able individuals commit unauthorised out­  
rage on either side, lei them be duly pu­  
nished ; or if they escape, let ns make  
io each other the best satisfaction the c is®  
admits, and not let our peace be broken  
by bad men, for all people have some bad  
men among them whom no laws can re­  
strain. As you have taken so long a jour­  
ney to see your fathers, we wish you not  
to return till you shall have visited our  
country and towns towards the sea coast.  
This will be new and satisfactory to you,  
and it will give you the same knowledge  
of the cotinny on this side of the Missis­  
sippi, which we are endeavoring to ac­  
quire of that on the oilier side, by sending  
trusty persons to explore them.  
We nrnnose to do in vonr r.mmtrv  
  
what we aredetarousyou should do incurs ;  
we will pioitle accommodations for your  
journey, for y our comfort while engaged  
in it, and for your re&#x27;urn in s ifety to your  
own cot nt&gt;y, carrying wiih you those  
proofs of esteem with which w ^distinguish  
our friends, arid til) ill particularly distin­  
guish you. (,n youi return ,ell year peo­  
ple that 1 take them all by the hand, that  
1 become their father hereafter, that they  
shall know our nation only &lt;s friends and  
h&#x27;M&#x27;lat’.&#x27;j. , \iij. Wo navi, n«i v . t,.&gt; tipors  
them but to catry 01 a commerce useful  
to them and u&gt;; to keep them in peace  
wit!) their- neighbors, that their children  
may multiply, may grow up and hve to a 1  
good old age, ami their women no longer  
fear the tomahawk of any enemy.  
.My children tlie-e am my words,carry  
them to your nation, keep them in your  
memories, and out ft iendsiiip in your hearts  
and may the Great Spirit look down upon ]  
us, and cotcr us with the mantle of his  
love.

e us from one degree of ignominy  
to another, and, by his threats, awe us into a sub­  
missive and disgraceful surrender of our national  
rights, and national honour.  
We hope, however, that our administration will  
persevere in the stand it has at last made against in­  
solence and incroacliment.  
TALK FOR TALK’S SAKE.  
The following is a talk of Mr. Jefferson to the  
Chiefs of the Osage nation of Indians—Which we  
are told by the National Intelligencer is to afford ar  
immense degree of pleasure to us, and to refleci  
great honour, not upon Mr. Jefferson himself, bui  
upon the government!—So mote it be !  
My Children, White hairs, Chiefs, and Warriouro oj  
the Osage A a: ion,  
I repeat to you assurances of the sitir,faction it ha;  
given me to receive vouhere. Besides the labour o  
such a journey, the confidence you have shewn ir  
the honour and friendship of my ccur.tymen is pecu­  
liarly gratifying, and 1 hope you have seen that youi  
confidence was justly placed, that you have fount  
yourselves, since you crossed the Mississippi, ament  
brothers and friends with whom you were as safe a&#x27;;  
at home.  
  
ji/y (./iildrcn : I sinccmv weep with you nver the  
graves of vour chiefs and friends, who fell hv ti.e  
hands of their enemies lately descending the Osage  
river. H id they been prisoners, mid living, v.o  
■would have recovered them ; but no voice can aunkn  
the dead, no power‘undo w hat is done ; on this side  
of the Mississippi where ettr government has been  
Jong established, and cur authority organized, cur  
friends visiting ns are safe. We hope it will net 1 c  
long before our voice will he henid ar.d our arms  
respected, by these who meditate to injure our  
friends, on the other side of that ri\cr ; in the mean  
time govenionr Havrison will lie directed to take pro­  
per measures to inquire into the circumstances of  
the transaction, to report them to us for considera­  
tion and for the further measures they may re­  
quire.  
Aft/ Children : By late arrangements with France  
and Spain, we now take their place as your nei«h­  
fcours, fHetsdu, and fathers ; and we hope you wid  
have no cause to regret the change. It is so lrng  
since cur lorcfathers came from beyond t!tc great  
water, that we have lost the memory of it, and seem  
to have grown out uf this land, as you have dene ;  
never more will you have occasion to change, your  
fathers. We are now all of enc family, born in the  
same land, and bound to live as brothers, and the  
Strangers from beyond the great waters are gone  
from among us ; the great Spirit has given you  
strength, and has given us strength, not that &#x27;we  
might hurt one another, but to do each other all the  
good in our power. Our dwellings indeed are very­  
far apart ; but not too far to carry on commerce and  
useful intercourse. You have fir.,&quot; and peltries which  
we want, and we have clothes and other useful  
things that you want; let us employ ourselves then  
in mutually accommodating each other. To begin  
this on our part, it was nec.e .sai-y to knew v.hat na­  
tions inhabited the great country called Lcuisi na.  
which embraces all the waters cf the Mississippi and  
Missouri, what number of peltries they could fur­  
nish, what quantities and kinds of mcichandize they  
would require, where would be the deposits most  
convenient for them, and to make an exact map cl  
all these waters.—For this purpose I sent a beloved  
m ill, Capt. Lewis, one of my own hi usehold, to  
learn something of the people with whom we are  
now united, to let you know we were your friends, to  
invite you to come and see us, and to tell us how we  
c n lie a end to you. 1 thank you for the readiness  
with which you have listened to his voice, and for  
the favour yen hav e shewed, him in Ids nassare untlie  
  
Missouri. I U:&gt;| c your countrymen will favour and  
pr tcct him us fur ns they extend. On his return  
we shall hear what lie lias seen and learnt, and pro­  
etid tn establish trading houses w here our red bre­  
thren shall think best, and to exchange commodities  
with them on terms with which they w ill be satis­  
fied.  
With the same views I had prepared another par­  
ty to go up the Ued river to its source, thence to the  
source ot the Arknnsa, and down to its mouth, but  
1 will now gne enters that they shall only go a small  
distance up the Red river this season, and return to  
tell us what they have seen, and that they shall not set  
out for the head of that river till the ensuing spring  
when you will be at home, and will, I hope, guide  
and guard them on their journey. I also propose  
the next year to send another small party up the ri­  
ver Kansas to its source, thence to the head of the  
river of the Pai.is, and down to its mouth, and others  
tip the river on the North side of the Missouri,  
For guides along these rivers we must make arrange­  
ments with the tuitions inhabiting them.  
My Children : I was sorry to learn that a schism  
had taken place la your nation, and that a part of  
your people had withdrawn with the great track, to  
tnc Arkansa river, vve will send an agent to them  
and will use our best offices to prevail on them to re­  
turn, and to live in union with you. We wish to  
make them also our friends,and to make that friend­  
ship, and the weight it may give us w ith them, use­  
ful to you and them.  
We propose, my children, immediately to esta­  
blish an agent to reside with you, who will speak to  
you our words, and convey yours to us ; who will be  
the guardian of our peace and friendship, convey  
truths from the one to the other, dissipate all false­  
hoods which might tend to alienate and div ide us,  
snd maintain a good understanding and friendship  
between us ; as the distance is too great for you to  
come often and tell us your wants, you will lellthwn  
to him on the spot, and he will convey them to ns in  
writing, so that wc shall be sure that they come from  
you ; through the intervention of such an Agent, we  
shall hope that our friendship will forever be preser­  
ved, no wrong will ever be done you by our nation,  
and w e trust that yours will do none to us ; and  
should ungovernable individuals commit unauthorised  
outrage on cither side, let them be duly punished •  
or if they escape let us make to each other the best  
satisfaction the cause admits, awl not let our peace  
fce broken by bad men, for all people have some bad  
Bien among them whom no laws can restrain. As  
  
yim have taken sa long a jouMey to&#x27; tee your fathers,  
we wish you not to return till you shall have visited  
our country aud towns toward the sea coast. This  
will be new and satisfactorv to you, and it wiil give  
you the same knowledge of the country on this side  
of the Mississippi, which we arc endeavouring to j  
acquire of that on the other side, by sending trusty J  
persons to explore them. We propose to do in  
your country only what we are desirous you should  
do in ours ; we will provide accommodations fur  
your journey, for your comfort while engaged in it,  
and for your lets in in safety to your own country,  
carrying with you those proofs of esteem with which  
we distinguish our friends, and shall particularly  
disiinguish you. On your return tell your people  
that 1 take them all by the hand, that I become their  
father hereafter, that they shall know our nation  
only as friends and benefactors ; that we have no  
views upon them but to carry on i commerce useful  
to them and us, to keep-them in peace with their  
neighbours, that their children may multiply, may  
grow up and live to a good old age, and their wo­  
men no longer fear the tomahauk of an enemy.  
My children these are my words carry them to  
your nation, keep them in your memories, and our  
triedship in your hearts, and may the Great Spirit  
look down upon us, and cover us with the mantle of  
his love.

Children, Whitc-Sdns, Cbieft,  
. &#x27; AND &#x27; .&quot;&quot;V  
Warriors of tbe Osage Nation.,  
I repeat to you assurances of the  
-satisfaction it has given me to receive  
you here. Besides the labor ot such  
a journey, the confidence you have  
shewn in the honor and friendship  
of my countrymen is peculiarly grati­  
fying, and I hope you have seen that  
your confidence was justly placed,  
that you have found yourselves, since  
you crossed the Mississippi, among  
brothers and friends with whom you  
were as safe as at home.  
My Children i I sincerely weep  
with you .over the graves of your  
chiefs and friends, who fell by the  
hands of their enemies lately descen­  
ding the Osage river. Had they  
been prisoners, and living, we would  
have recovered them ; but no voice  
can awake the dead, no power undo  
what is done ; on this side of the  
Mississippi where our government  
has been long established, and our  
authority organised, our friends visit­  
ing us&#x27; are safe. We hope it will  
not be long before our voice will be  
heard and our arms respected, by  
those who meditate to injure oUr  
friends on the other side efthat river ;  
in the mean time Governor Harrison  
will be directed to take proper mea­  
sures to inquire into the circumstances  
of the transaction, to report them to  
us fpr consideration, and for the fur­  
ther measures5 they may require.  
My children &#x27;. By late arrange­  
ments with France and Spain, we  
now take their place as your neigh­  
bours, friends and Fathers; and we  
hope you will have no cause to regret  
the change. It is so long since our  
forefathers came from beyond the  
great water, that we have lost the  
memory of it, and seem to have  
grown out of this land,, as you have  
done ; never more will you have oc­  
casion to change your faihers. . Ve  
are all now of one family, born in  
the same land, and bound to live as  
brothers, and the strangers from be­  
yond the great water are gone froma­  
mong us. The Great Spirit has given  
you strength, &amp; has given us strength,  
not that we might hurt one ano-,  
ther, but to do to each other all the  
good in our power. Our dwellings  
hjdeed are very far apart ; but not  
too far to carry on commerce and  
useful intercourse. You have furs  
nd peltries which we want, and we  
have cloathes and other useful things  
that you want ; let us employ our­  
selves then in mutually accommoda­  
ting each other. To begin this m  
our part, it was necessary to know  
what nations inhabited the great  
country called Louisiana, which cm  
braces all the waters of the Mississip­  
pi and Missouri, w hat number of pel  
tries they could furnish, what quan  
tities and kinds of merchandize they  
would require, where would be the  
deposits most convenient for them,  
antl tomake an exact map ot all these  
waters. For this purpose I sent a  
beloved man. Cant. Lewis, one of  
my own household, to learn , some  
thing of the people with whom we  
are now united, to let you know we  
were, your friends, to invite you to  
come and see us, and to tell us how  
we can be useful to you. I&quot; thank  
you for the read jneis with which you  
have listened , to his voice, and for  
the favor you shewed him in his pas  
sage up the Missouri. I hope your  
countrymen will favor and protect  
him as far as they extend. On his  
return we shall hear what he has  
seen and learnt, and proceed to es­  
tablish trading houses &quot;where our red  
brethren shall think best, and &#x27; to  
exchange commodities &quot;with them on  
terms with which they will be satis­  
fied. .  
With the same views I had prepa­  
red another party to go up the&#x27; Red  
river to its source, thence to ttie  
source of the Arkansa, inVl down to  
rrouth, but I will now give order  
  
that they shall only go a small dis­  
tance up the Red river this season,  
and return to tell us what they have  
seen, and that they shall not set out  
for the head of that river till the  
ensuing spring, &#x27;when you will be  
at home, and will I hope guide and  
guard them on their journey, I al­  
so propose the next year to send a­  
nother small party up the river Kan­  
sas to its source, thence to the head  
of thevriver,of the Panis, and down  
to its&#x27;month, and others up the river  
on the frorth side of the Missouri.  
For guides along these rivers we  
must make arrangements with the  
nations inhabiting them.  
My Children t I was sorry to learn  
that a schism had taken place in your  
nation, and that a part of your peo­  
ple had withdrawn with the great  
track, to the Arkansa river, we will  
send an agent to them and will use  
our best offices to prevail on them to  
return, and to live in union with you.  
We wish to make them also our  
friends, and to make that friendship  
and the weight it may give us with  
them, useful to you and them.  
We propose, my children, imme­  
diately to establish an agent to reside  
with you, who will speak to you our  
words, and convey yours to us ; who  
will be the guardian of our peace  
and friendship, convey truths from  
the one to the other, dissipate all  
falsehoods which might tend tp alien­  
ale and divid us, and maintain a  
good understanding and friendship  
between us ; as the distance is too  
great for you to come often and tell  
us your wants, you will tell them to  
him on the spot, and he will convey  
them to us in writing, so that we shall  
be sure that they come from you ;  
through the intervention of such an  
Agent, we shall hope that our friend-&#x27;  
  
ship will forever be preserved, no  
Wrong will be. done ynu hy our nation J  
ad e trust that yours win uo none  
to us ; iind should ungovernable in­  
dividuals commit unauthorised out­  
rage on either side, let them be duly  
punished ; or if they escape, let us  
make to each other the best satisfac­  
tion the case admits, and let not our  
peace be broken by bad men, for all  
people have some bad men among  
them whom no laws can restrain.  
As you have taken so long a jour­  
ney to see your fathers, we wish  
you not to return till you shall have  
visited our country and towns to  
wards the sea coast. This will be  
new and satisfactory to you, and it  
will give you the same knowledge of  
the country on this side of the Missis­  
sippi, which we are endeavoring to  
acquire Qf that on the other side, by  
lending trusty persons to explore  
them. ii­  
We propose to do in your cowy  
only what we are desirous you should  
do in ours ; we will provid.e accom­  
modations for your journey, for your  
comfort while engaged in it, and  
for your return in safety to your own  
country, carrying with you those  
proofs of esteem with which we dis­  
tinguish our-friencs, and shall parti  
cularly distinguish you. On your re  
turn, tell your people that I take them  
all by the hand, that I become their  
father hereafter, that they shall know  
our nation only as friends and bene­  
factors ; that we have no views upon  
them, but to carry cn a commerce  
useful to them and us ; to keep them  
in peace with their neighbours, that  
their children may multiply, may  
grow up and live to a good old age,  
and their women no longer fear the  
tomahawk of any enemy;  
My children, these are my words,  
cany therri to your nation, keep them  
in your memories, and our friendship  
in your hearts, and may the Great  
Spirit look down upon us, and cover  
us with the mantle of his love.

The following is the address lately  
delivered by the President of the Uni­  
ted States to the chiefs of the Osage  
nation. We offer it to the public,  
with a confidence that the sentiments  
of good will it breathes towards the  
aborigines of the foil, will afford as  
much pleasure to the reader, as they  
‘confer honor on the government.  
My Children, White hairs, Chiefs and  
&#x27; Wa_rrv&quot;o}&#x27;r of the Osage nation.  
. I repeat to you affarances of the fatis:  
faction it has given to recejve you here.  
~=DBefides the labor of such a journey,  
the confidence you have thewn in the  
honor and friendthip of my country­  
men is pecaliarly ‘gratifying, and I  
hope you have fouad yenrfelves, since  
you crossed %ﬁefoﬁ‘ﬁpp;, among  
btothers and Tiiends with whom you  
were as {afe asathome, © .  
My Childres s 1 (incerely weep with  
‘you over the graves of your chiefs and  
fiiends who fell by the hands of their  
efiemies lately descending the Ofige  
tiver. Had théy been prisoners, and  
living,we world haverecovered them :  
but noveice can awake the dead, no  
power undo whatis done ; oa this fide  
of the Miflifippi where our govern­  
ment has been long eftablithed, and  
our authority organized, otr friends  
visiting us are fafe. We hope it will  
&quot;not be long before our voice will be  
Heard and our arm refpeQed, by those  
who teditate to injure our fiiends on  
the other fide of that rivers in the  
mezn time Governor Harrison will be  
direCted to take proper measures to  
inquire into the circum@ances of the  
tran{2Clion, to report them to us for  
consideration and for the further mea­  
sures they may requirs,  
- 8y Children: By late arrangements  
with ¥rance and Spain, we now tuke  
their place as your neighbors, friends  
and fathersy and we hope you will  
have no cause to regret rhe change.  
It is so long since cur forefathers came  
froth beyond the great water, that we  
have loft the memory of it, and seen  
to have grown out of this land, as you  
have done ; never mere will you have  
occasion to change your fathers. We  
are all now of cne family, bern in  
the fatme land and bound to live as  
brothers, and the strangers from be­  
yond the great weter are gone from  
among us ; the great Spirit has given  
us firength ; not that we might hurt  
one another, but to do each other all  
the good in car power. Our cwells  
ings indeed are very far apart ; but  
not too far to carry on commerce and  
bieful intercourse. © You have furs  
and peltries which we want, and we  
have clothes and other ufeful things  
that you want ; let us employ our­  
selves then in mutually accommodat­  
ing each other. o begin this on cur  
part it was neceflary to know what  
hations inhabited -the great counuy  
called Louiliana, which embraces all  
the waters in the Mississippi and Mis­  
souri, what number of peltries they  
conld furnifh, what Qusntities and  
kinds of Merchandize they would re­  
quire, where would be the dep«fits  
most convenient for them and to maka  
an exact map of all these waters, For  
this purpose I sent a beloved man,  
Capt. Lewis, one of my own house­  
hold, to learu something of the peo­  
ple with whom we are niow united, to  
let you know we were your friends, té  
envite you to come aud fee us, and to  
tell us how we can be ufeful to you.  
I thank you for the readiness wich  
which you have listened to his voice,  
and for the favor you shewed him in  
his passage up the Miffonri. 1 hope  
your countrymen will favor and pro­  
tect him as far as they extend. On  
his return we shall hear what he hus  
seen and learnt, and proceed to eftab­  
lith trading houses where onr red bre.  
thren (hail think belt, and to exchange  
commodities With theth oh terms with  
which they will be fatisfied. .  
‘With the fame views I had pribared  
another party to go up the Red river to  
its source, therce to the source of A:%  
kanfa, &amp; down to its mouth, but I will  
now give orders that they thall only gb’  
a {mall distance up the Red river this  
season, und return to tell us what they  
have feeh, and that they thall not set  
cut for the head of that river until
