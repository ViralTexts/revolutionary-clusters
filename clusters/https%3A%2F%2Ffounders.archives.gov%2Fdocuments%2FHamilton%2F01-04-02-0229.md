[New York, April 2, 1788]  
To the People of the State of New-York.  
IT has been mentioned as one of the advantages to be expected from the co-operation of the senate, in the business of appointments, that it would contribute to the stability of the administration. The consent of that body would be necessary to displace as well as to appoint. A change of the chief magistrate therefore would not occasion so violent or so general a revolution in the officers of the government, as might be expected if he were the sole disposer of offices. Where a man in any station had given satisfactory evidence of his fitness for it, a new president would be restrained from attempting a change, in favour of a person more agreeable to him, by the apprehension that the discountenance of the senate might frustrate the attempt, and bring some degree of discredit upon himself. Those who can best estimate the value of a steady administration will be most disposed to prize a provision, which connects the official existence of public men with the approbation or disapprobation of that body, which from the greater permanency of its own composition, will in all probability be less subject to inconstancy, than any other member of the government.  
To this union of the senate with the president, in the article of appointments, it has in some cases been objected, that it would serve to give the president an undue influence over the senate; and in others, that it would have an opposite tendency; a strong proof that neither suggestion is true.  
To state the first in its proper form is to refute it. It amounts to this—The president would have an improper influence over the senate; because the senate would have the power of restraining him. This is an absurdity in terms. It cannot admit of a doubt that the intire power of appointment would enable him much more effectually to establish a dangerous empire over that body, than a mere power of nomination subject to their controul.  
Let us take a view of the converse of the proposit

ate a different conduct; I answer that the instances in which the president could be personally interested in the result, would be too few to admit of his being materially affected by the compliances of the senate. The POWER which can originate the disposition of honors and emoluments, is more likely to attract than to be attracted by the POWER which can merely obstruct their course. If by influencing the president be meant restraining him, this is precisely what must have been intended. And it has been shewn that the restraint would be salutary, at the same time that it would not be such as to destroy a single advantage to be looked for from the uncontrouled agency of that magistrate. The right of nomination would produce all the good of that of appointment, and would in a great measure avoid its ills.  
Upon a comparison of the plan for the appointment of the officers of th

y be the subjects of speculation and conjecture.  
Every mere council of appointment, however constituted, will be a conclave, in which cabal and intrigue will have their full scope. Their number, without an unwarrantable increase of expence, cannot be large enough to preclude a facility of combination. And as each member will have his friends and connections to provide for, the desire of mutual gratification will beget a scandalous bartering of votes and bargaining for places. The private attachments of one man might easily be satisfied; but to satisfy the private attachments of a dozen, or of twenty men, would occasion a monopoly of all the principal employments of the government, in a few families, and would lead more directly to an aristocracy or an oligarchy, than any measure that could be contrived. If to avoid an accumulation of offices, there was to be a frequent change in the persons, who were to compose the council, this would involve the mischiefs of a mutable administration in their full extent. Such a council would also be more liable to executive influence than the senate, because they would be fewer in number, and would act less immediately under the public inspection. Such a council in fine as a substitute for the plan of the convention, would be productive of an increase of expence, a multiplication of the evils which spring from favouritism and intrigue in the distribution of the public honors, a decrease of stability in the administration of the government, and a diminution of the security against an undue influence of the executive.

le of most of the states in their local constitutions, encourages us to reprobate the idea.  
The only remaining powers of the executive, are comprehended in giving information to congress of the state of the union; in recommending to their consideration such measures as he shall judge expedient; in convening them, or either branch, upon extraordinary occasions; in adjourning them when they cannot themselves agree upon the time of adjournment; in receiving ambassadors and other public ministers; in faithfully executing the laws; and in commissioning all the officers of the United States.

ent answer.  
We have now compleated a survey of the structure and powers of the executive department, which, I have endeavoured to show, combines, as far as republican principles would admit, all the requisites to energy. The remaining enquiry is; does it also combine the requisites to safety in the republican sense—a due dependence on the people—a due responsibility? The answer to this question has been anticipated in the investigation of its other characteristics, and is satisfactorily deducible from these circumstances, from the election of the president once in four years by persons immediately chosen by the people for that purpose; and from his being at all times liable to impeachment, trial, dismission from office, incapacity to serve in any other; and to the forfeiture of life and estate by subsequent prosecution in the common course of law. But these precautions, great as they are, are not the only ones, which the plan of the convention has provided in favor of the public security. In the only instances in which the abuse of the executive authority was materially to be feared, the chief magistrate of the United States would by that plan be subjected to the controul of a branch of the legislative body. What more could be desired by an enlightened and reasonable people?

Electors are to be chosen immediately by the people. The  
following language is used.  
  
“Does the executive department combine the requisites to safety  
in a republican sense,—a due dependence on the people—a due res-  
ponsibility? The answer to this question has been anticipated in

of the Federalist have done, that electors are to be chosen

In this discussion, in congress Mr. Madison, one of the ablest

boast, considered the removal from office was an executive  
power, and that congress could not restrict its exercise. He  
also considered the power of appointment an executive power,  
and that, had not the constitution so provided, the concurrent

We have already cited Hamilton’s opinion,

decision of the Congress of 1789—a decision

It has been mentioned, as one of the advantages  
to be expected from the codperation of the Senate in  
the business of appointments, that it would con-  
tribute to the stability of the Administration. Zhe  
consent of that body would be necessary to displace as  
well as to appoint. A change of the Chief Magis-  
trate, therefore, would not occasion so violent or so  
general &#x27;a revolution in the officers of the Govern-  
ment as might be expected if he were the sole dis-  
poser of offices. Where a man in any station had  
given satisfactory evidence of his fitness for it, a new  
President would be restrained from attempting a  
change in favor of a person more agreeable to him,  
by the apprehension that the discountenance of the  
Senate might frustrate the attempt, and bring some  
degree of discredit upon himself. Those who can  
best estimate the value of a steady administration  
will be most disposed to prize a provision which con-  
nects the official existence of public men with the ap-  
probation or disapprobation of that body, which, from  
the greater permanency of its own composition, will,  
in all probability, be less subject to inconstancy than  
any other member of the Government.  
  
(The italics in the above quotation are the  
writers. )  
  
If further authority in support of this con-  
tention be necessary, the writer will cite the  
opinion of Daniel Webster, who has been  
called ‘‘the great expounder of the Con-  
stitution,” and who, in the course of a speech  
delivered in the Senate of the United States  
on Feb. 16, 1835, spoke as follows:  
  
Nothing is said in the Constitution about the  
power of removal, because it is not a separate and  
distinct power. It is part of the power of appoint-  
ment, naturally going with it or necessarily resulting  
from it.
