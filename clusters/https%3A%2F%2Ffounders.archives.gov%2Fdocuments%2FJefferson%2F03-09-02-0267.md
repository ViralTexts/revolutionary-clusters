Sir  
Monticello. Jan. 29. 16.  
  
Your letter bearing date Oct 18. 1815. came only to hand the day before yesterday, which is mentioned to explain the date of mine. I have to thank you for the pamphlets accompanying it, to wit, the Solemn review, the Friend of peace or Special interview, &amp; the Friend of peace No 2. the first of these I had received thro’ another channel some months ago. I have not read the two last steadily thro’, because where one assents to propositions as soon as enounced, it is loss of time to read the arguments in support of them. these numbers discuss the 1st branch of the causes of War, that is to say Wars undertaken for the point of honor. which you aptly analogise with the act of duelling between individuals, and reason with justice from the one to the other. undoubtedly this class of wars is in the general what you state them to be, ‘needless, unjust, and inhuman, as well as anti Christian.’The 2d branch of this subject, to wit, Wars undertaken on account of wrong done, and which may be likened to the act of robbery in private life, I presume will be treated of in your future numbers. I observe this class mentioned in the Solemn review p. 10. and the question asked ‘Is it common for a nation to obtain a redress of wrongs by war?’ the answer to this question you will of course draw from history. in the mean time reason will answer it on grounds of probability, that where the wrong has been done by a weaker nation, the stronger one has generally been able to enforce redress; but where by a stronger nation, redress by war has been neither obtained nor expected by the weaker. on the contrary the loss has been increased by the expences of the war in blood and treasure. yet it may have obtained another object equally securing itself from future wrong. it may have retaliated on the aggressor losses of blood and treasure far beyond the value to him of the wrong he had committed, and thus have made the advantage of that too dear a purchase to leave him in a disposition to renew the wrong in future. in this way the loss by the war may have secured the weaker nation from loss by future wrong. the case you state of two boxers both of whom get a ‘terrible bruising’ is apposite to this. he of the two who committed the aggression on the other, altho’ victor in the scuffle, yet probably finds his aggression not worth the bruising it has cost him.to explain this by numbers. it is alledged that Great Britain took from us before the late war near 1000. vessels, and that during the war we took from her 1400. that before the war she seized and made slaves of 6000. of our citizens, and that in the war we killed more than 6000 of our citize her subjects, and caused her to expend such a sum as amounted to 4. or 5,000. guineas a head for every slave she made. she might have purchased the vessels she took for less than the value of those she lost, and have used the 6000. of her men killed for the purposes to which she applied ours, have saved the 4. or 5000 guineas a head, and obtained a character of justice, which is valuable to a nation as to an individual, these considerations therefore leave her without inducement to plunder property and take men in future on such dear terms. I neither affirm  nor deny the truth of these allegations, nor is their truth material to the question. they are possible, and therefore present a case which will claim your consideration in a discussion of the general question whether any degree of injury can render a recourse to war expedient? still less do I propose to draw to myself any part in this discussion. age and it’s effects both on body and mind, has weaned my attentions from public subjects, and left me unequal to the labors of correspondence beyond the limits of my personal concerns. I retire therefore from the question with a sincere wish that your writing may have effect in lessening this greatest of human evils, and that you may retain life and health to enjoy the contemplation of this happy spectacle, and pray you to be assured of my great respect.

course draw from history ; in the mean time, reason will  
answer it on grounds of probability, that where the wrong  
has been done by a weaker nation, the stronger one has  
generally been able to enforce ieacrieal but ‘where by a  
stronger nation, oe by war has been neither obtained  
nor expecte ed by the weaker; on the contrary, the loss has  
been increased by the expenses of the war, in blood and  
treasure: yetit may have. obtained another object, equally  
securing itself from future wrong. I may have retaliated  
on the aggressor, losses f blood: and treasure, far beyond  
the value to him, of the wrong be had coaimitted, and thus  
have made the advantage of that too dear a purchase to  
leave hun tna disposi ifion to renew the w rong in future 5 In  
this way, the loss by the war may have secured the weaker  
nation from loss by future wreng. ‘The case you state of  
two boxers, both of whom get a “terrible bruising,’ is  
it] posite to this; he, of the two who committed the aggres-  
sion on the other, although victer in the scuffle, yet probably  
finds his aggression not worth the bruising if has cost him.  
‘To explain this by numbers, it is alleged, that Great-Britain  
took from us, before the late w ar, near 1000 vessels, and  
that during the war, we took frem her 1460; that beiore  
the war, she seized, and made slaves of 6000 of our ci‘izens,  
and that in the war we killed more than 6000 of her subjects,  
and ee her to expend such a sum as amounted to 4 or  
  
000 guineas ahead for every slave she made. She might  
have Giiretiadad the vessels she took, for less than the  
value of those she lost, and have used the 6000 of her men  
killed, for the purposes to which she applied ours, have  
saved the 4 or 5600 cuineas a head, and obtained a character  
of justice, which is valeable to a nation as to an individual.  
These considerations, therefore, lesve her without induce-  
ment to plunder property » and fake men in future on such  
dear terms. [neither afiirm nor deny the truth of these  
allegations, nor is their truth material (o the question; they  
are possible, and therefore present a case which will claim  
your consideration, in a discussion of the general question ;  
Whether any degree of injury can render a recourse to war  
expedient? Still less do IJ propose, to draw to myself any  
part in this discussion. Age, and its effects both on body  
and mind, has weaned my attentions from publick subjects,

Montickllo,Jan. £2, 1S16.  
SIR,  
Yqpr letter, bearing date Octo­  
b r 18, 18 lj, came only to ban I the day be­  
} re yesterday, whLh is mentioned to ex­  
plain the date of mine. 1 have to thank  
you for the pamphlets accompanying it, to  
wit, the Solemn Review, the Friend of  
i* -ace or Special Interview, and the Friend  
of Rc.-icc, No. 2. The fiist of these I had  
received through another chan, cl soimc  
months ago. I h ive not read the two last  
steadily through, because where one ;.si- nts  
to the propositions as soon as announced, it  
is loss of time to read the arguments in sup­  
port of them.—These numbers discu s the  
fir t branch of the causes of w.:r. th .t is to  
ray, wars undertaken for the fioint of ho­  
nor, which you aptly analogize with the  
act of duelling between individuals, and  
reason with justice from the ore to the oth­  
er. Undoubtedly this class of w .i s is, in  
the general, what you state the n to ’be,  
“ needless, unjust and inhum tn, as well as  
antichristian.”  
The second branch cf thi3 subject, to  
wit, wars undertaken on account of wrong  
done, ■ n 1 which may be likened to the  
act of robbery in private life, I presume  
will be t-e.tted of in your future numbers.  
I observe this class mentioned in the So­  
lemn Review, p. 10, and the question ask  
ed, “ Is it common for a nation to obtain  
a redress of wrongs by war?” The an­  
swer to this question you will cf course  
draw from history ; in the mean time, rea­  
son wil answer it on the grounds &lt; f pro­  
bability, that win re the wrong has been  
done by a weaker nation, the stronger one  
has generally been able to enforce redress,  
but where by a stronger nation, redress by  
war has been neither obtained nor expect­  
ed by the weaker ; on the contrary, the  
loss lias been increased by the expeuces of  
the war, in blood and treasure ; yet i; may  
have obtained another object, tqu dlv se­  
curing itself from future wrong. It may  
have retaliated on the aggressor leasts of  
blood and treasure, far i&gt;. ynnd the v luc to  
him, of the wrong he bad committe , and  
thu3 have made the advantage of that too  
dear a purchase to leave him in a dispo  
sition to renew the wrong in future ; in  
this way, ti.c 1 ss of the war may nave se­  
cured the weaker nation from loss of future  
  
wrong, i he case you state of two boxers,  
both of whom get a M teriibie bruising” ,s  
appos.te to tins : iie, of tiic t wo who commit­  
ted the aggression on ihe other, although  
victor in the scufli-, yet probably finds his  
aggression not worth the bruising it has  
cist him. To explain this by numbers, it  
is alleged, that (beatBritain took ftnni us,  
before the late war, mar 1000 vessels, an:l  
that, during the war, we took from her  
1 too ; t!i it before the war, she seized, and  
made slaves of 6000 of our citizens, and  
that in the late war we killed more than  
6000 of her subjects, and caused her to ex­  
pend such a sum as amounted to 4 nr 5000  
guineas a head for every slave she made,  
bhc might have purchased the vessels she  
took, for less than the value of those slit­  
lost, and have used the 6000 of her men  
killed, for the purposes to which she ap­  
plied ours, have saved her 4 or 5000 gui­  
neas a head, and obtained a character of  
justice, which is valuable to a nation as  
to an individual. These cons derations,  
therefore, leave her Without inducement to  
plunder pr. per y, and take men in future  
on sueh dear terms. I neither affirm nor  
d&#x27;liy the truth of thr&amp;e allegations, ii .ris  
their truth material to the question ; they  
are po&#x27;.sible, and therefore present a cas;  
which will claim yonr consideration, in a  
dis uss»bn of the general question ; whe­  
ther any r.egi ee of injury can render a re­  
course 11 war expedient &gt; fttdl less do I  
propose to draw to myself any part in tins  
discussion. Age, and its effects both on b «•  
dy and mind, lias weaned rny attentions  
from public subjects, and left me unequal  
to the labours of correspondence, beyond  
the limits of my personal concerns. 1 rc~  
tire, therefor*-, Irom the question, with a  
sdeem wish, that your wi rings may have  
effect in lesseni g this g:catcst of human c­  
vils, 8c that you may retain life and health,  
to enj y the contemplation of this happy  
spectacle; and pray you to be assured of

MONTICELF?: &#x27;JanN.29.  
Slß—Your letter, bearing da’€, October 8,  
1815, carge only to hand the day tas‘ore yester­  
“day, which is mentioned to explal *# .e date of  
mine. I have tethank you for the pamphlets  
accompanying it, to wit, the Solemn Review,  
the Friend of Peace or Special Interview, and  
the Friend of Peace, No. 2. The first of these  
I had received through another channel somec  
months ago. I have not read the two last  
steadily th7zo’ because where one assents to  
propositions as soon as anweunced, it” is loss of  
time to read the arguments in supposrt of them.  
These numbers discuss the first branch of the  
causes of war that 1z to say, wars undertzken  
for the point of honor which you aptly analogize  
with the act of duelling between individuals,  
and reason with justice from the one to the oth­  
er. Undoubtedly this class of warsis in the  
general, what vou state them to be, “ needless,  
unjust and inhumén, as well as antichristian.”  
The second branch of this subject, to wit,  
wars undertaken on account of wrang d‘a;g, and  
which may be likened to the act of robbery in  
private life, I presume will be treated of in your  
future numbers. 1 observe this class mention:  
ed in the Selemn Review, p. 10, and the ques­  
tion asked, “Is it common for a nation to ob­  
tain a redress of wrangs by war ? The ans­  
wer to this question you will of course draw from  
history ; in the mean time, reason will answer  
it on gromnds of probability, that where the  
_wrong has been done by a weaker nation, the  
stronger one has generally been able to enforee  
redress ; but where by a stronger nation, ve­  
dress by war has been neither obtained nor ex­  
pected by the weaker ; on &quot;the contrary, the  
loss has been increased by the expences of the  
war, in blood and treasure : it may have ob­  
&#x27; tained anether object equally securing itsalf  
from future wrong. It may have retaliated on  
the aggressor, losses of blood and &#x27;treasure, far  
beyond the value to him,of the wrong-he had  
committed, and thus have made the aavantage  
of that too dear a purchase to leave him in a  
disposition to renew the wrong ia future : in  
this way the loss by the war may have secured  
the weaker nation from loss by ftuture wrong.—  
The case you state of two boxers, both of whom:  
get.a terrible bruising; is epposite to this; he,  
of the twe who committed the aggression on  
the other, altheugh victor in the scuffle, yet  
®:obably finds his aggression not worth the  
bruising it has cést him. 7To explain this by  
numbers, it is alledged that Great Britain  
took frem us, before the late war, near  
1000 vessels,”and that Juring the late wat,  
e took from her 1400 ; that before the war,  
she seized, and made slaves of 6000 of our citi­  
zens, and that in the war we killed more than  
6000 of her subjects, and caused her to expend  
such a gum as amounted to 4 or §OOO guineas  
a head for every slave she made. She might  
have purchased the vessels she took for less  
than the value of those she lost, and have used  
the 6000 of her men killed, for the purposes to  
whichshe applied ours,have saved the 4or 5000  
| guineas @ head, and obtained a eharaclér of  
justice, which is valuable to-a nation as te an  
individual. These considerations, thepefore,  
leave her without inducment to pJunder propem  
ty, and take men in future on such dear terms.  
1 neither affirm nor deny the truth of these il­  
legations, nor is theit truth material to the  
question ; they are possible, and therefore  
present a case which will claim your considera­  
tion, in a discussion of the general question :=—  
Whether any degree of injury can render a re­  
course to war expedient ! Still less do I pro­  
pose to draw to myself any part in this discus­  
sion. Age, and its effects both on body and  
mind, has weaned my attention from public  
subjects, and left me unequal to the labors of

MoxTicrLLO, Jan, 29, 18!6.  
  
SIR«Your letter, boaring date October  
18, 1815, came only to hund the day belore  
yesterday, which is mentioned to explaiin the  
date of mine. 1 have to thaok you tor the  
pampblets accompanying it, to wit, the Sal­  
emn Review, the Friend of Peace er Special  
Interview, and the I&#x27;riend of Peace, No 2.  
The first of these 1 had received through an­  
other channcl some months age. | bhave not  
read the two last steadily through, because  
were one assents Lo propositions as soon as  
ananounced, it is loss of time o 0 resd the ar­  
guments in support of them,«—=These num­  
bers discuss the first branch of the causes of  
war, that is to say, wars undertaken for the  
Point of henor, which you aptly analogige  
with the act of dueling between individuals,  
and reason with justice from the one to the  
other. Undoubtedly this class of wars is, in  
the general, what you state them to be,  
“needless, unjun and inhuman ; as well as  
aatichristian.’  
  
The secand branch of this subjeet, to wit,  
wars undertakeh on account of wrong done,  
and which may be likened tothe act of rob.  
bery in private life, I presume will be treat­  
ed of in your fature numbers. I ohserve this  
cless mentioned in the Solemn Reyizw, poge  
  
y 4  
10 ,&quot;l;}“lbe quesiion aaked, # T Com  
for 8 nation 10 obtain &amp; redress of wionge  
war?” The auswer to this qdestion 76  
will of course draw from history ; in the mean­  
timme, reason will auswer on the grounds of  
probability, that were the wrong has been  
done by weaker pations, the stronger one hss  
generally been able to enforce redress; bus  
.where by a stronger nation, redress by war  
&quot;has been peilhier oblained nor expected by  
the weaker ; on the contrafy, the loss has  
been increased by the expenses of the war,  
in blood and treasure : yet it may have ob­  
tained another übject, equally securing itself  
from future wrong. It may have retaliated  
on the aggressor; losses of bleod and treasure  
far beyond the value to bim, of the wrong he  
had committed, and thus have made the ad­  
vantage of that too dear a purchase to leave  
him in a disposition to renew the wrong in  
future ; in this way, the loss by the war may  
have secured the weaker pation from loss by  
future wrong. The case you state of two  
boxers, both of whom get a ¢ terrible bruis­  
ing,” is apposite to this ; he, of the two who  
committed the aggression on the other; al­  
though victor in the scuffle, yet probably  
finds bis aggression not worth the bruising it  
has cost him. To explaine this by numbers,  
it is alleged, that Great Britain took from us,  
belore the war, near 1000 vessels, and that  
during the war we took from her 1,400 ; that  
before the war, she selzed, and made slaves  
of 6000 of our citizens, and that in the war  
we killed more than 6000 of her subjects,  
and caused her to expend such asum as a­  
mounted to 4 ar 5 thousand guineas a head  
for every slave she made. She might have  
purchased the vessels she took, for less than  
the value of those she lost, and have used the  
6000 of her men killed, for the purposes to  
which she applied ours, have saved-the 4 or  
5000 guineas a head, and obtained a charac­  
ter of justice, which is valued to a nation as  
to an individual. These considerativns, there­  
fore, lecave ber without inducement to phun­  
der property, and take men in fatore on such  
dear terms. I ncither eoffirm ofr deny the  
trath of these allegations, nor is their truth  
material to the question ; they are possible,  
and iherefore present a case which wiil claim  
your consideration, in a discussion of the  
genaral question ; Whether avy degree of  
injury can render a recourse to war expedi  
ent ! Sull less do I propose, to draw to my­  
sclf any part inthis diseussion, Age, and  
its effects both on body and mind, has wean­  
ed my atenticns from puoblic subjects, and  
le{t me unequal to the labours of correspon­  
deace, beyond the limits of my personal con­  
cerns. I reure, thereof from the question,  
with a sinccre wish, that veur writings may .  
nave effsct m lessening this greatest of hu.  
man evils, and that yon may retain life and  
bealth, to enjoy the contemplation of this  
happy spectacie ; and pray you te be assyred  
of my great respect.

veil for the pamphlets accompanying if.  
  
to wit, 1 lie Solemn Uoview, the friend or  
Peace, or Special Interview, and the  
I&#x27;Yiend of Peace, No. 2. The first of  
fee I had received through another  
channel souse months •i.o. 1 have not  
read tie too last steadily th:o? be cause  
where oue assents to propositions as soon  
ns announced, it is loss of time to read  
the uigumentN in support of them These  
numbers discuss the first branch of w ar,  
that is to sav, wars undertaken for the  
point of honor, which you a&lt; I iv analogize  
viih the act of duelling between individ  
nals, and icasnn with justice from out* to  
other, [&#x27;inioubfcdlv this class of)  
v.ars i , in the gc-. e a!, what you state|  
them to l&gt;e, needless, unjust, and inhuman j  
as well a* anti-chrisfian.  
The second branch of this subject, to*  
wit. wit vs undertaken on account of j  
wrrwt* J,,ii#&gt;, and which may be 1 kened&#x27;  
to the act of robbery in piiva&#x27;e life, I  
presume will be t rated of in your future  
numbers. I observe this class mentioned;  
in the Solemn Review, p 10, and the)  
question asked, u Is it common for ana-;  
tioti to obtain a ledress of wrongs by;  
war?” The answer to this question j  
you will of course draw fnm lvstory;  
in the mean time, reason will answer it i  
on grounds of probability, that where j  
die wrongs has been done by a weaker;  
nation, the stronger one has been able  
o enforce redress ; but where, by a  
tronger nation, redress by war has been  
neither obtained or expected by the wea­  
ker—on the contrary ; the loss has been  
increased by the expences of the w ar, in  
loot! and treasure ; yet it may have ob­  
tained another object, equally securing  
’■elffrou future wrong. It may have re­  
atiated on the aggressor, losses oi blood  
and treasure, far beyond the value to him,  
•f the wrong he had committed, and  
us have made the advantage of that too  
eat a purchase in future; in this way  
. e ioss by the war may have secured the  
weaker nation from loss by future wrongs, i  
  
The cases you state of two boxes, both  
of whom get a “ terrible bruising,” b  
opposite to this ; he, of the two who  
commited the aggression on the other, a&#x27;  
fhough victor in the scuffle, yet probablv  
&#x27;inds the aggression not worth the brush  
in it has cost him. To explain this by  
- umbers, it is alledged, that (j. Bri’aii.  
‘ook from us, before the late war, neai  
1000 vessels, and that during the war, we  
rook 1400 ; that before the war, she  
seized and made slaves of 6000 ot oui  
citizens, and that in the war we killer  
more than 6000 of her subjects, and caus­  
ed her to expend such a sum a*- amount­  
ed to 4 or 5000 guinea* a head for every  
slave she made. She might have * -  
chased the vessels she took foi less than  
the value of those she l^st, and have used  
the 6000 of her men killed, for purposes  
*o which she applied ours, have saved  
the 4 or 5000 guiness a head, and obtain  
erl a character of justice which is as va­  
luable to a nation as an individual.  
The^e considerations, h ave her without  
inducement to plunder property, ai d  
rake men in future on such dear term-*.  
I neither affirm or deny the truth ot  
t&#x27; ese allegations nor is their truth mate­  
rial of the question ; they are possible, P  
therefore present a cause to your consi­  
deration. in a discussion of the genera*

MONTICELLO, January 29, 1816.  
  
Srr :—Your letter, bearing date October 18,  
1815, came only to hand the day before yester-  
day, which is mentioned to explain the date of  
mine. I have to thank you for the pamphlets  
accompanying it, towit, Zhe Solemn Review, The  
Friend of Peace, or Special Interview, and The  
Friend of Peace, No. 2. The first of these I  
had received through another channel, some  
monthsago. I havenot read the two last stead-  
ily through, because where one assents to prop-  
ositions as soon as announced, it is loss ot time  
to read the arguments in support of them.  
These Numbers discuss the first branch of the  
causes of War, thatis to say, Wars undertaken  
for the point of honor, which you aptly analo-  
gize with the act of duelling between individu-  
als, and reason, with justice, from the one to the  
other. Undoubtedly, this class of Wars is, in  
the general, what you state them to be, “ need-  
“Jess, unjust, and inhuman, as well as antichris-  
“tian.”  
  
The second branch of this subject, to wit,  
Wars undertaken on account of wrong done, and  
which may be likened to the act of robbery in  
private life, I presume will be treated of in  
your future numbers, I observe this class men-  
tioned in the Solemn Review, p. 10, and the  
question asked, “Is it common for a Nation to  
“obtain a redress of wrongs by War?” The  
answer to this question you will of course  
draw from history; in the mean time, reason  
will answer it on grounds of probability, that  
where the wrong has been done by a weaker Na-  
tion, the stronger one has generally been able to  
enforce redress ; but where by a stronger Na-  
tion, redress by War has been neither obtained  
nor expected by the weaker—on the contrary,  
the loss has been increased by the expenses of  
the War, in blood and treasure; yet it may  
have obtained another object, equally securing  
itself from future wrong. It may have retaliat-  
ed on the aggressor, losses of blood and trea

sure, far beyond the value to him of the wrong  
he had committed, and thus have made the  
advantage of that too dear a purchase in future ;  
in this way, the loss by the War may have secur-  
ed the weaker Nation from loss by future  
wrong.  
  
The case you state of two boxers, both of  
whom get a “terrible bruising,” is apposite to  
this; he, of the two, who committed the ag-  
gression on the other, although victor in the  
scuffle, yet probably finds the aggression not  
worth the bruising it has cost him. To explain  
this by numbers, it is alleged that Great Britain  
  
  
  
took from us, before the late War, near 1,000  
vessels, and that, during the War, we took  
1400: that before the War, she seized and  
made slaves of 6,000 of our citizens, and that  
in the War we killed more than 6,000 of her

sum as amounted to 4 or 5000 guineas a  
head for every slave she had made. She  
might have purchased the vessels she took  
for less than the value of those she lost, and  
have used the 6000 of her men killed, for the  
purposes to which she applied ours; have  
saved the 4 or 5000 guineas a head; and ob-  
tained a character of justice, which is as val-  
uable to a Nation as an individual. These  
considerations leave her without inducement to  
plunder property, and take men, in future, on  
such dear terms. I neither affirm nor deny the  
truth of these allegations; nor is their truth  
material to the question: they are possible, and  
therefore present a case to your consideration,  
in a discussion of the general question: Whe-  
ther any degree of injury can render a recourse  
to War expedient? Still less do I propose to
