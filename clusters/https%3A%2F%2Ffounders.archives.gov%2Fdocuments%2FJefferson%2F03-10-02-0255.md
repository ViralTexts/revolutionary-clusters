Monticello Sep. 5. 16  
  
Your letter of Aug. 16. is just recieved. that which I wrote to you under the address of H. Tompkinson was intended for the Author of the pamphlet you were so kind as to send me, and therefore, in your hands, found it’s true destination. but I must beseech you, Sir, not to admit a  
			 possibility of it’s being published. many good people will revolt from it’s doctrines, &amp; my wish is to offend nobody, to leave to those who are to live under it the settlement of their own  
			 constitution and to pass in peace the remainder of my time. if those opinions are sound, they will occur to others, and will prevail by their own weight, without the aid of names. I am glad to  
			 see  
			 that the Staunton meeting has rejected the idea of a limited convention. the article however, nearest my heart, is the division of the counties into Wards. these will be pure &amp; elementary republics, the  
			 sum of all which, taken together, composes the state, &amp; will make of the whole a true democracy as to the business of the Wards, which is that of nearest and daily concern. the affairs of the  
			 larger sections of counties, of states, &amp; of the Union, not admitting personal transaction by the people, will be delegated to agents elected by themselves; and representation will thus be  
			 substituted where personal action becomes impracticable. yet, even over these representative organs, should they become corrupt and perverted, the division into wards, constituting the people, in  
			 their wards, a regularly organised power, enables them, by that organisation, to crush, regularly and peaceably, the usurpations of their unfaithful agents, and rescues them from the dreadful  
			 necessity of doing it insurrectionally. in this way we shall be as republican as a large society can be; and secure the continuance of purity in our government by the salutary, peaceable, and  
			 regular  
			 controul of the people. no other depositories of power have ever yet been found which did not end in converting to their own profit the earnings of those committed to their charge. George III. in execution of the trust confided to him, has, within his own day, loaded the inhabitants of Great Britain with debts equal to the whole fee-simple value of their island, and under pretext of governing it, has alienated it’s whole soil to creditors who could lend money to be lavished on priests,  
			 pensions, plunder &amp; perpetual war. this would not have been so, had the people retained organised means of acting on their agents. in this example then let us read a lesson for ourselves, and  
			 not  
			 ‘go, and do so likewise.’  
Since writing my letter of July 12. I have been told that, on the question of equal representation, our fellow-citizens in some sections of the state claim peremptorily a right of representation for their slaves. principle will, in this, as in most other cases, open the way for us to correct conclusion. were our state a pure democracy, in which all it’s inhabitants should meet together to transact all their business, there would yet be excluded from their deliberations 1. infants, until arrived at years of discretion. 2. women; who, to prevent depravation of morals, and ambiguity of issue, could not mix promiscuously in the public meetings of men. 3. slaves, from whom the unfortunate state of things  with us takes away the rights of will and of property. those then who have no will could be permitted to exercise none in the popular assembly; and of course could delegate none to an agent in a representative assembly. the business, in the first case, would be done by qualified citizens only; and in the second by the representatives of qualified citizens only.   It is true that, in the General constitution, our state is allowed a larger representation on account of it’s slaves. but every one knows that that constitution was a matter of compromise, a capitulation between conflicting interests and opinions. in truth, the condition of different descriptions of inhabitants in any country is a matter of municipal arrangement, of which no foreign country has a right to take notice. all it’s inhabitants are men as to them. thus, in the New England states, none have the powers of citizens but those whom they call freemen; and none are free men until admitted by a vote of the freemen of the town. yet, in the general government these non-freemen are counted in their quantum of representation, and of taxation. so slaves, with us,  
			 have no powers as citizens; yet in representation in the General government they count in the proportion of 3. to 5. and as 5. so also in taxation. whether this is equal is not here the question. it is a capitulation of discordant sentiments and circumstances, and is obligatory on that ground. but this view shews there is no  
			 inconsistency in claiming representation for them from the other states, &amp; refusing it within our own.

you were so kind as to send me, and

nqt to admit a possibility of its being  
published: many good people will revolt  
from its dactrines, and my wish is to  
offend nobody: to leave to those who  
are to five under it the settlement of their  
own constitution, and to pass in peace  
the remainderof my time. Ifthose opin­  
ions jare sound they will occur to others,  
and will prevail by their own weight,  
without the aid of names. I am glad to  
see that the Staunton meeting haa re­  
jected the idea ofa limited Convention:  
the article however, nearest my heart is  
the devision of the counties into Wards,  
these will be pure elementary republice,  
the sum of all which, taken together  
composes, the state, and will make of the  
whole a true democracy aa to the busi­  
ness of the Wards, which is that of near­  
est daily concern: the affairs of the larger  
sections of countrys, of states, end of the  
Union, not admitting personal transaction,  
by the people, will be delegated to a­  
gents elected by themselves; and rep­  
resentation will thus be substituted where  
personal action becomes impracticable.  
Yet, eyen over these representative or­  
gans, should they become, corrupt and  
perverted, the division into wards, con- I  
stituting the people, in their wards, a re- j  
gularly organized power, enables them

No other depositories of power have ever  
yet been found which did not end. in con­  
verting to their own profit the earnings

George lll.in execution of the trust con­  
fided to him, has, within his own day,  
loaded the inhabitants of Great Britain  
with debts equal to the whole fee-simple  
value of their island, and under pretext

been so, had the people retained organ­  
ized means of acting on their agents. In  
this example then let us read a lesson for  
ourselves, and not *go and do so likewise.’  
Since writing my letter of July 12, I  
have been told that, oil, the question of  
equal representation, opr fellow-citizens,  
in some sections of the state claim pe­  
remptorily a right of representation for  
their slaves. Principle will, in this, as  
in most other cases, open the way for us  
to correct conclusions. &lt; Were our state  
• pure democracy, in which all its inha­  
bitants should meet together to transact  
all their business, there would yet be  
excluded from their deliberations_1.  
infants, until arrived at years of discre­  
tion—2. Women, who, to prevent depra­  
vation of morals and ambiguity of issue,  
could not mix promiscuously in the pub­  
lic meetings of men—3. Slaves, from  
whom the unfortunate state of things  
with us takes away the rights of will and  
of property. Those thenwho have no  
will could be permitted to exercise none  
in the popular assembly; and of course  
could delegate none to an agent in a re­  
presentative assembly.. The business,in  
the first case^ would bo dope by qualifi­  
  
ed citizens only? and in the second, by ]  
the representatives of ‘ qualified citizen*  
only. It is true that in the General Con- &#x27;  
stitution, our State is allowed a large re- 1  
presentation on account of its slaves—  
But every one knows that that Constitu­  
tion was a matter of compromise, a capi­  
tulation between conflicting interests and  
opinions In truth the condition of dif­  
ferent descriptions of inhabitants in any  
j country is a matter of municipal arrange­  
ment, of which no foreign country has a  
right to take notice. All its inhabitants  
are men as to them. Thus in the New  
I England States, none have the powers  
of citizens but those whom they call free­  
menv and none are freemen until admitt­  
ed by a vote of the freemen of the town:  
yet in the general government these non­

slaves, with us, have no powers as citi­  
zens; yet in the representation in the ge­  
neral government they count in propor­

Whether this is equal, is not here the

the larger sections of countries, of stales, and  
of the Union, not admitting personal transac­  
tion by the people, will be delegated to agents  
elected by themselves; and representation will  
thus be substituted where personal action be­  
comes impracticable. Yet, even over these re­  
presentative organs, should they become cor­  
rupt and perverted, the division into wards,  
constituting the people, in their wards, a regu­  
larly organized power, enables them by that or­  
ganization, to crush, regularly and peaceably,  
the usurpations of their unfaithful agents, and  
rescues them from the dreadful necessity of  
doing it insurrectional^* I*1 ibis way we shall  
be as republican as a large society can be: and  
secure the continuance ol purity to our govern­  
ment by the salutary* peaceable and regular  
control of the people, No other depositories  
of power have ever yet been found which did  
not end in converting to their own profit the  
earnings of those committed to their charge.  
George III* in execution of the trust confided  
to him, has* within his own day, loaded the  
inhabitants ol Gieat Britain with debts equal  
to tbe whole fee -simple value of their island,  
  
and under pretext of governing it, has alienated  
its whole soil to creditors who could lend mo­  
ney to be lavished on priests, pensions, plunder  
and perpetual war. This would not have been  
so, had the people retained organized means of  
acting on their agents. In this example then  
let us read a lesson for ourselves, and not ‘go  
and do so likewise.*  
Since writing my letter of July 12, I have  
been told that on the question of equal repre­  
sentation, our fellow-citizens, in some sections  
of the state claim peremptorily a right of rep­  
resentation for their slaves. Principle will, in  
this, as in most other cases, open the way for  
us to correct conclusions. Were our state a  
pure democracy, in which all its inhabitants  
should meet together to transact all their busi­  
ness, there would yet be excluded from their  
deliberations—1. infants, until arrived at years  
of discretion—2 Women, who, to prevent dep­  
ravation of morals and ambiguity of issue, could  
not mix promiscuously in the public meetings  
of men—3. Slaves, from whom the unfortunate  
slate of things with us takes away the rights of  
will and of property. Those then who have no  
[ will could be permitted to exercise none in the  
popular assembly; and of course could delegate  
none to an agent in a representative assembly  
The business in the first case, would be done by  
qualified citizens only; and in the second, by  
the representatives of qualified citizens only.—  
It is true that in the General Constitution, our  
State is allowed a large representation on ac­  
! count of its slaves—But every one knows that  
that Constitution was a matter of compromise,  
a capitulation between conflicting interests and  
opinions. In truth the condition of different  
descriptions of inhabitants in any country is a  
matter of municipal arrangement, of which no  
foreign country has a right to lake notice. All  
its inhabitants are men as to them. Thus in  
the New England Slates, none have the pow­  
ers of citizens but those whom they call freemen  
and none are freemen until admitted by a vote of  
the freemen o! the town: yet in the general gov­  
ernment these non-freemen are .counted in their  
quantum of representation, and of taxation. So  
slaves, with us, have no powers as citizens; yet  
in the representation in the general government  
they count in proportion of 3 to 5, and so also  
in taxation.—Whether this is equal, is not here  
the question. It is a capitulation of discordant  
sentiments and circumstances, and is obligato­  
ry on that ground. But this view shews there  
is no inconsistency in claiming representation  
tor them from other states, and refusing it with­  
in our own.  
Accept the renewal of assurances of mv re­  
spect. TH: JEFFERSON

has rejected the Idea of n limited Convention: The ar­  
ticle, however, nearest my heart, I* the division of  
counties into Ward-*, these will be pure and oleincn­  
tary Republics, the sum of all which,* taken together,  
composes the state, and will make of the whole a true  
democracy a* to the business of the wards which is that­  
ol the nearest and daily concern; the affair! of the lar­  
ger sections of counties, of States, and of the Union,  
not admitting personal transaction by tho people, will&#x27;  
bo delegated to agents elected by themselves; anil rep­  
resenfatlon will thus bo substituted where personal ac­  
tion becomes impracticable. Vet, even our represen­  
tative organs, should they become corrupt and pervert­  
ed, the division into wards, constituting the people, in­  
their wards a regularly organized power, enable* them  
by that organization, to crush, regularly and poaceably,  
the usurpations of their unfaithful agents, and rescuo  
them from tho dreadful necessity ot doing it insurrec­  
tionally. In this way, we shall be as a largo society  
can be; and s«-curc the continuance of purity in our gov­  
ernment by tho salutary, peaceable, and regular con­  
trol of the people. No other depositories of power haves  
ever yet been found, which did not a tel in converting  
to their own profit, the earnings of those committed to­  
their charge, tienrgo ihe III., in execution ol the*,  
tru&#x27;d routided to tiirn, has, within hi-own day, loaded­  
the Inhabitants ol t.&#x27;reat liritr.in with debts equal to tha  
whole fee-simple vnluo ol their island, and under pre­  
texted governing it, has alienated its whole soil to ored­  
itots who could l«»4n! money to lie lavished on priests,  
pensions, plunder and perpetual war. This would not  
have been so, had the people retained organized mean*  
of acting on (heir agents. In this • example then, let  
u« read a lesson for ourselves, ami not “go and do eo  
likewise.” .  
  
Since writing my letter of .Toly 12, I have been toM  
tint, on tlm question of equal representation, our fel­  
low-citizen* in some section* ol the state claim peremp­  
torily a right o( representation for their slaves. I’niici­  
ple will, hi thi*, as in most other casos, open the way  
lor us to a correct conclusion Were our« a pure democ­  
racy, in which all our inhabitants would meet together  
to transact all their business, there would yet he ex­  
cluded from tho deliberation*-!. Infants until arrived  
at years oi discretion—2. Women, who to prevent dc­  
nr»»ation of morals anti ambiguity ol issue, could not  
mix promiscuously in tho public meetings ol men—75.  
Slaves from whom the unfortunate »tate of things wills  
us takes away the rights of will and of property. Those  
then who havo n * will could be permitted to exerciso  
n ine in the popular assembly; and of course could de­  
legate none to an agent in a representative a»sernblv.  
The btiuaes* in tho tir*t case, would lie done by quail,  
tied citizens only; anti in the second, by the repre-enta­  
tiv*s ot qualified citizens only. It is true that, in tho  
general Constitution, our state is allowed a larger rep­  
resenta&#x27;irm on account of its slaves. Hut every oun  
know s that Constitiutinn was a mitter of compromise, ii  
capitulation between conflicting intoresls and opinion*.  
In truth, the condition of different descriptions of In­  
habitant* in any country is a matter of municipal nr*  
rangein*nt, of which no country has a right to (ak«  
| notice. __ All its inhabitants are men as to them. Tbits,  
i in the N. E. States, none have the powers of citizen*,  
but tho-e whom they call Jrecmeii; and none arc free&#x27;  
mtn until admitted by a vote of the freemen of the  
town. Yet, in the general government, theso non­  
frrernen are counted in their quantum of representa­  
tion anti of luxation. So slave*, with us havo no poiy  
I era a* citizens; yet in the representation in the general

I also in taxation. Whether this is equal, is not hare tins  
question. It ii a capitulation of discordant sentiment*

Since writing my letter of July the 12th, 1  
have been told, that on the question of equal  
representation, our fellow-citizens in some sections  
of the State claim peremptorily a right  
of representation!! for their slaves. Principle  
will, in this, oe in most other oases, open the  
way for us to oorreet conclusion. Were our  
State a pure democracy, in which all its inhabitants  
should meet together to trausact  
all their business, there would yet be excluded  
from their deliberations?1. Infants, until arrived  
at years of discretion 2. Women, who,  
to prevent depravation of morals and ambiguity  
of iseue, could not mix promiscuously in  
tho public meetings of men. 3. Slaves, from  
whom the unfortunate state of things with us  
takes away the rights of will and of property.  
1*hose, then, who have no will, could be )&gt;er­  
  
ill 11 m a| bu t&#x27;jirii iw iivhv 111 lur pipui?i iiw ur  
bly ; and of oounr, could delegate none to be  
an agent in a representative assembly. The  
business, in the first cone, would be done by  
qualified citizen* only ; and in the second, by  
the representatives of qualified citizens only.  
It is true, that in the general Constitution, our  
State is allowed a larger representation on account  
of its slaves. Hut every one knows that  
that Constitution was a matter of compromise.  
a capitulation ltetween oontlioting interests  
and opinions. In truth, the condition of different  
descriptions of inhabitants in any country  
is a matter of municipal arrangement, of which  
no foreign country has a right to take notice.  
All its inhabitants are men, as to tlieui. Thus,  
in the New England States, none have the  
powers of citizens but those whom they call  
freemen ; and none are freemen until admitted  
by a vote of the freemen of the town. Vet, in  
the General Government, them? non-freemen  
are counted in their quantum of representation  
and of taxation. So, slaves with us have  
no powers as citizens ; yet, in representation  
in the General Government, they count in the  
proportion of three to five; and so also in taxation.  
Whether this is equal, is not here the .  
question. It is a capitulation of discordant  
sentiments and circumstances, and is obligatory  
on that ground. Hut this view shows 1  
there is no inconsistency in claiming repre- 1  
mentation for them from the other States, and 1  
refusing it within our own. Accept the renewal
