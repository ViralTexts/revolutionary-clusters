According to information given by Mr. Eaton, he has prevailed on  
the brother of the bashaw of Tripoli to repair to Malta, with a view  
to be with our squadron before Tripoli, and to be made use of against  
the bashaw. At this distance it is difficult to judge accurately of the  
project, or to give particular instructions for the management of it. Al-  
though it does not accord with the general sentiments or views of the  
United States to intermeddle with the domestic controversies of other  
countries, it cannot be unfair in the prosecution of a just war, or the ac-  
complishment of a reasonable peace, to take advantage of the hostile co-  
operation of others. As far, therefore, as the views of the brother may  
contribute to our success, the aid of them may be used for the purpose.  
Should this aid be found inapplicable, or his own personal object unattain-  
able, it will be due to the honour of the United States, and to the expecta-  
tions he will have naturally formed, to treat his disappointment with much  
tenderness, and to restore him, as nearly as may be, to the situation from  
which he was drawn, or to make some other convenient arrangement, that  
may be mere eligible to him. In case of a treaty of peace with the ruling  
bashaw of Tripoli, perhaps it may be possible to make some stipulation,  
formal or informal, in favour of the brother, which may be a desirable al-  
leviation of his misfortune.
