tten a few days after Cuningham’s publication, he says was, no doubt, written to apologise to me for the pointed reproaches he had uttered against me in his confidential letters to Cuningham. and thus having ‘no doubt’ of his conjectures, he considers it as proven, goes on to suppose the contents of the letter [19. 22.] makes it place mr Adams at my feet suing for pardon, and continues to rant upon it, as an undoubted fact. now I do most solemnly declare, that, so far from being a letter of apology, as mr Pickering so undoubtingly assumes, there was not a word nor allusion in it respecting Cuningham’s publication.The other allegation respecting myself is equally false. in page 34. he quotes Dr Stuart, as having, 20. years ago, informed him that Genl Washington, ‘when he became a private citizen,’ called me to account for expressions in a letter to Mazzei, requiring, in a tone of unusual severity, an explanation of that letter. he adds of himself ‘in what manner the latter humbled himself and appeased the just resentment of Washington will never be known, as some time after his death the correspondence was not to be found, and a diary for an important period of his presidency was also missing.’ the diary being of transactions during his presidency, the letter to Mazzei  not known here until some time after he became a private citizen,  and the pretended correspondence of course after that, I know not why this lost diary and supposed correspondence are brought together here, unless  for insinuations worthy of the letter itself. the correspondence could not be found indeed, because it had never existed. I do affirm that there never passed a word, written or verbal, directly or  indirectly, between Genl Washington and myself, on the subject of that letter. he would never had degraded himself so far as to take to himself the imputation in that letter on the ‘Samsons in combat.’ the whole story is a fabrication, and I defy the framers of it, and all mankind to produce a scrip of a pen between Genl Washington &amp; myself on the subject, or any other evidence more worthy of credit than the suspicions, suppositions and presumptions of the two persons here quoting and quoted for it. with Dr Stuart I had not much acquaintance. I supposed him to be an honest man, knew him to be a very weak one, and, like mr Pickering, very prone to antipathies. boiling with party passions, and, under the dominion of these, readily welcoming fancies for facts. but come the story from whomsoever it might, it is an unqualified falsehood

 the original, speaking of an Anglican, monarchical, and aristocratical party which had sprung up since he had left us, states their object to be ‘to draw over us the substance, as they had already done the forms of the British government.’ now the forms here meant were the levies, birth-days, the pompous cavalcade to the State house on a meeting of Congress, the formal speech from the throne, the procession of Congress in a body to re-echo the speech in an answer Etc Etc but the translator here, by substituting form in the singular number, for forms in the plural, made it mean the frame or organisation of our government, or it’s form of Legislature, executive, and judiciary authorities, co-ordinate and independant, to which form it was to be  inferred that I was an enemy. in this sense they always quoted it, and in this sense mr Pickering still quotes it, pages 34. 35. 38. and countenances the inference. now Genl Washington perfectly understood what I meant by these forms, as they were frequent subjects of conversation between us. when on my return from Europe, I joined the government in March 1790. at New York, I was much astonished indeed at the mimickry I found established, of royal forms and ceremonies, and more alarmed at the unexpected phaenomenon, by the monarchical sentiments I heard expressed, and openly maintained in every company, and among others, by the high members of the government, executive and judiciary, (Genl Washington alone excepted) and by a great part of the legislature, save only some members who had been of the old Congress, and a very few of recent introduction. I took occasion at various times of expressing to Genl Washington my disappointment at these symptoms of a change of principle, and that I thought them encouraged, by the forms and ceremonies which I found prevailing, not at all in character with the simplicity of republican government, and looking, as if wishfully to those of European courts. his general explanations to me were that when he arrived at New York, to enter on the executive administration of the new government, he observed to those who were to assist him, that, placed as he was in an office entirely new to him, unacquainted with the forms and ceremonies of other governments, still less apprised of those which might be properly established here, and himself perfectly indifferent  to all forms, he wished them to consider and prescribe what they should be; and the task was assigned particularly to Genl Knox, a man of parade, and to Colo Humphries, who had resided some time at a foreign court. they, he said were the authors of the present regulations, and that others were proposed so highly strained that he  absolutely rejected them. attentive to the difference of opinion prevailing on this subject, when the term of his second election arrived he called the heads of departments together, observed to them the situation in which he had been at the commencement of the government, the advice he had taken and the course he had observed in compliance with it; that a proper occasion had now arrived of revising that course, of correcting in it any particulars not approved in experience, and he desired us to consult together, agree on any changes we should think for the better, and that he should willingly conform to what we should advise. we met at my office, Hamilton and myself agreed at once that there was too much ceremony for the character of our government, and particularly that the parade of the installation at N. York ought not to be copied on the present occasion; that the President should desire the Chief Justice to attend him at his chambers that he should administer the oath of office to him in the presence of the higher officers of the government and that the certificate of the fact should be delivered to the Secretary of State to be recorded, Randolph and Knox differed from us, the latter vehemently, they thought it not advisable to change any of the established forms, and we authorised Randolph to report our opinions to the President. as these opinions were divided, an

article of it. my last parting with Gl Washington was at the inauguration of mr Adams in March 1797. and was warmly affectionate; and I never had any reason to believe any change on his part as there certainly was none on mine. but one session of Congress intervened between that and his death the year following, in my passage to and from which as it happened to be not convenient to call on him, I never had another opportunity; and as to the cessation of correspondence observed during that short interval no particular circumstance occurred for epistolary communication, and both of us were too much oppressed with letter-writing to trouble, either the other, with a letter about nothing.The truth is that the federalists, pretending to be the exclusive friends of Gl Washington, have ever done what they could to sink his character, by hanging theirs on it, and by representing, as the enemy of republicans, him who, of all men, is best entitled to the appellation of the father of that republic which they were endeavoring to subvert, and the republicans to maintain. they cannot deny, because the elections proclaimed the truth, that the great body of the nation approved the republican measures. Genl Washington was himself sincerely a friend to the republican principles of our constitution. his faith perhaps in it’s duration might not have been as confident as mine; but he repeatedly declared to me that he was determined it should have a fair chance for success; and that he would lose the last drop of his blood in it’s support, against any attempt which might be made, to change it from it’s republican form. he made these declarations the oftener because he knew my suspicions that Hamilton had other views, and he wished to quiet my jealousies on this subject. for Hamilton frankly avowed that he considered the British constitution, with all the corruptions of it’s administration, as the most perfect model of government which had ever been devised by the wit of man; professing however, at the same time, that the spirit of this country was so fundamentally republican that it would be visionary to think of introducing monarchy here, and that therefore it was the duty of it’s administrators to conduct it on the principles their constituents had elected.Genl Washington, after the retirement of his first Cabinet, and the composition of his second, entirely federal, and at the head of which was mr Pickering himself, had no opportunity of hearing both sides of any question. his measures consequently took more the hue of the party in whose hand’s he was. these measures were certainly not approved by the republicans; yet were they not imputed to him, but to the counsellors around him; and his prudence so far restrained their impassioned course and bias, that no act of strong mark, during the remainder of his adminstration, excited much dissatisfaction. he lived too short a time after and too much withdrawn from information, to correct the views into which he had been deluded; and the continued assiduities of the party drew him into the vortex of their intemperate career, separated him still farther from his real friends, and excited him to actions and expressions of dissatisfaction, which grieved them, but could not loosen their affections from him. they would not suffer this temporary aberration to weigh against the immeasurable merits of his life; and altho’ they tumbled his seducers from their places, they preserved his memory embalmed in their hearts, with undiminished love and devotion; and there  it for ever will remain embalmed, in entire oblivion of every temporary thing which might cloud the glories of his splendid life. it is vain then for

&quot; The other allegation respecting wyelf, is  
equally false. In pige 34, he (Pickering)

he became a private citisen, called me to ac­  
count for expressions used in a latter to  
jHazzei, requiring, in a tone of unusual sever­

himself, that in what manner the latter  
humbled himself and appeased the just resent­

some time after lis death. the correspondence  
was not to be found, and a diary for an im­

hH presidency, the letter to Matiei not known  
her? until tome time after kr btrame a private  
ritizeii, and the pretended correspondence, of  
course, after that. I know not why this lost  
diary and supposed correspondence are brought  
together here, unless for insinuations wor&#x27;.by  
of the letter itself The correspondence could  
not he found, Indeed, because it had never ex­

a word, written or verbal, directly or indi­  
rectly, between General Washington and my­  
self on the subject of that letter He would  
never have degraded himselt so far as to take  
to himself the imputation in that letter on the  
Sampsons in combat. The whole story is a  
fabrication, and I defy the framers of it, and  
all mankind to produce a scrip of a pen be­

subject, or any other evidence more worthy of  
credit than the suspicions, suppositions and  
presumptiot s of the two persona here quoting
