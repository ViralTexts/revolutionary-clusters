The general government must, in this case, not only have a strong soul, but strong organs by which that soul is to operate.  
Here I shall give my sentiments of the best form of government—not as a thing attainable by us, but as a model which we ought to approach as near as possible.  
British constitution best form.  
  
Aristotle—Cicero—Montesquieu—Neckar.  
Society naturally divides itself into two political divisions—the few and the many, who have distinct interests.  
If government in the hands of the few, they will tyrannize over the many.  
If (in) the hands of the many, they will tyrannize over the few. It ought to be in the hands of both; and they should be separated.  
This separation must be permanent.  
Representation alone will not do.  
Demagogues will generally prevail.  
And if separated, they will need a mutual check.  
This check is a monarch.  
Each principle ought to exist in full force, or it will not answer its end.  
The democracy must be derived immediately from the people.  
The aristocracy ought to be entirely separated; their power should be permanent, and they should have the caritas liberorum.  
They should be so circumstanced that they can have no interest in a change—as to have an effectual weight in the constitution.  
Their duration should be the earnest of wisdom and stability.  
’Tis essential there should be a permanent will in a community.  
Vox populi, vox Dei.  
Source of government—the unreasonableness of the people—separate interests—debtors and creditors, &amp;c.  
There ought to be a principle in government capable of resisting the popular current.  
No periodical duration will come up to this.  
This will always imply hopes and fears.  
Creature and Creator.  
Popular assemblies governed by a few individuals.  
These individuals seeing their dissolution approach, will sacrifice.  
The principle of representation will influence.  
The most popular branch will acquire an influence over the other.  
The other may check in ordinary cases, in which there is no strong public passion; but it will not in cases where there is—the cases in which such a principle is most necessary.  
☞ Suppose duration seven years, and rotation.  
One-seventh will have only one year to serve.  
  
One-seventh——two years.  
One-seventh——three years.  
One-seventh——four years.  
A majority will look to a dissolution in four years by instalments.  
The monarch must have proportional strength. He ought to be hereditary, and to have so much power, that it will not be his interest to risk much to acquire more.  
The advantage of a monarch is this—he is above corruption—he must always intend, in respect to foreign nations, the true interest and glory of the people.  
Republics liable to foreign corruption and intrigue—Holland—Athens.  
Effect of the British government.  
A vigorous execution of the laws—and a vigorous defence of the people, will result.  
Better chance for a good administration.  
It is said a republican government does not admit a vigorous execution.  
It is therefore bad; for the goodness of a government consists in a vigorous execution.  
The principle chiefly intended to be established is this—that there must be a permanent will.  
Gentlemen say we need to be rescued from the democracy. But what the means proposed?  
A democratic assembly is to be checked by a democratic senate, and both these by a democratic chief magistrate.  
The end will not be answered—the means will not be equal to the object.  
It will, therefore, be feeble and inefficient.  
Recapitulation  
I. Impossible to secure the union by any modification of fœderal government.  
II. League, offensive and defensive, full of certain evils and greater dangers.  
III. General government, very difficult, if not impracticable, liable to various objections.  
What is to be done?  
  
Answer. Balance inconveniences and dangers, and choose that which seems to have the fewest objections.  
Expence admits of this answer. The expense of the state governments will be proportionably diminished.  
Interference of officers not so great, because the objects of the general government and the particular ones will not be the same—Finance—Administration of private justice. Energy will not be wanting in essential points, because the administration of private justice will be carried home to men’s doors by the particular governments.  
And the revenues may be collected from imposts, excises, &amp;c. If necessary to go further, the general government may make use of the particular governments.  
The attendance of members near the seat of government may be had in the lower branch.  
And the upper branch may be so constructed as to induce the attendance of members from any part.  
But this proves that the government must be so constituted as to offer strong motives.  
In short, to interest all the passions of individuals.  
And turn them into that channel.

the countryfrom sectional violence, and the intrusive  
interference of Utopian philanthropists.  
The difficulties in the convention were extreme;  
some contending that there was no right to form a  
new constitution, that the only power delegated was  
to remodel the old confederative system; while  
others, under the influence of Jefferson, advocated  
the establ ishment of a single legislative body, and  
the organization of a plurality executive, of which  
the judiciary was to be a component part.

Deine gogues will generally prevail.  
And if seperated they will need a mutual check.  
This cherk is a moparch.  
Each principle ought to exlst in full force, or it  
will not answer its end.  
  
The democracy must be derived immediately from  
The aristocracy ought to be entirely separated;  
their power should be permanent and they should

in a community.  
Yox populi, vox Dei.

objects of genorul government and the particular

democracy must be derived directly from the people. The  
aristocracy ought to be entirely separated ; their power should  
be permanent.”

prehend the problem of popular government, cannot but lead  
us to a conviction that his ambition, as well as his argument,  
looked to an office permanent and regal. There was to him
