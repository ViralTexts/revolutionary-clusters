On the 16th instant, I had the honor to inform Congress of a successful attack upon the enemy’s post at Stoney Point, on the preceding night, by Brigadier General Wayne and the corps of light infantry under his command—The ulterior operations in which we have been engaged, have hitherto put it out of my power to transmit the particulars of this interesting event. They will now be found in the inclosed report, which I have received from General Wayne—To the encomiums he has deservedly bestowed on the officers and men under his command, it gives me pleasure to add that his own conduct, throughout the whole of this arduous enterprise, merits the warmest approbation of Congress. He improved upon the plan recommended by me and executed it in a manner, that does signal honor to his judgment  
  
and to his bravery. In a critical moment of the assault he received a flesh wound in the head with a musket ball; but continued leading on his men with unshaken firmness.  
I now beg leave for the private satisfaction of Congress, to explain the motives which induced me to direct the attempt. In my former letters I pointed out the advantages which the enemy derived from the possession of this post and the one on the

 present, not less than 1500 men would be requisite for its complete defence. And from the nature of the works, which were open towards the River, a great deal of labour and expence must have been incurred and much time employed to make them defensible by us. The enemy, depending on their shipping to protect the rear had constructed the works solely against an attack by land. We should have had to apprehend equally an attack by water and must have inclosed the post. While we were doing this, the whole army must have been in the vicinity exposed to the risk of a general action, on terms which it would not be our interest to court, and out of reach to assist in carrying on the fortifications at West Point, or to support them in case of necessity—These considerations made it an unanimous sentiment to evacuate the post, remove the cannon and stores and destroy the works; which was accomplished on the night of the 18th, one piece of heavy cannon only excepted. For want of proper tackling within reach to transport the cannon by land, we were obliged to send them to the fort by water. The movements of the enemys vessels created some uneasiness on their account and induced me to keep one of the pieces, for their protection, which finally could not be brought off, without risking more for its preservation, than it was worth. We also lost a Galley which was ordered down to cover the boats. She got under way, on her return, the afternoon of the 18th. The enemy began a severe and continued cannonade upon her, from which having received some injury, which disabled her for proceeding, she was run a shore. Not being able to get her afloat, ’till late in the flood tide and one or two of the enemy’s vessels, under favour of the night having passed above her, she was set on fire and blown up.

s energy and so much the greater caution.  
They have now brought their whole force up the River and yesterday landed a body at Stoney point—It is supposed not impossible that General Clinton may endeavour to retaliate by a stroke upon West Point and his having stript New York as bare as possible and brought up a number of small boats are circumstances that give a color to the surmise. Though all this may very well be resolved into different motives, prudence requires that our dispositions should have immediate reference to the security of this post; and I have therefore drawn our force together, so as that the whole could act in its defence, on an emergency. Tomorrow, I remove my own Quarters to the Fort.  
It is probable Congress will be pleased to bestow some marks of consideration upon those officers who distinguished themselves upon this occasion. Every officer and man of the corps deserves great credit, but there were particular ones whose situation placed them foremost in danger and made their conduct most conspicuous—Lt Col. Fleury and Major Steward commanded the two attacks—Lieutenants Gibbons and Knox commanded the advanced parties or forlorn hopes; and all acquitted themselves as well as it was possible. These officers have a claim to be more particularly noticed. In any other service, promotion would be the proper reward; but in ours it would be injurious—I take the liberty to recommend in preference some honorary present, especially to the field officers—A brevet captaincy to the other two (as it will have no operation in regimental rank) may not be amiss

Heap QUARTERS;  
New Windsor, July 21st, 1779. &#x27;  
  
Sir,—Oun the 16th inst. I had the honor to in-  
form Congress of a successful attack upon the  
enemy’s works at Stony Point, on the preceding  
night, by Brigadier General: Wayne, and the  
  
corps of Light Infantry under hiscommand. The |.  
  
ulteri@r operations in which we have been en-  
gaged, have hitherto put it out of my power to  
transmit the particulars of this interesting event.  
They will now be found in the enclosed report,  
which I have received from General Wayne.—  
To, the encomiums he has deservedly bestowed  
on the officers and men under his command, it  
gives me pleasure to add that his own conduct,  
throughout the wholeof this arduous enterprise,  
merits the warmest approbation of Congress.  
He improved upon the plan recommended by  
me, and executed it in a manner that does signal  
honour to his judgment and his bravery In a  
critical moment of the assault, he received a  
flesh wound in the head, with a musket ball, but  
continued leading on his men with unshaken  
firmness,  
  
I now beg leave, for the private satisfaction of  
Congress, to.explain the motives which induced  
me to direct the attempt.

enemy began a severe and continued cannonade  
upon her, from which, having received some in-  
jury, which disabled her from proceeding, she  
was run ashore. Not being able to get her afloat

Heap QuARTERS,  
New Windsor, July 21st, 1779.  
| Sir—On the 16th inst. I had the honor to inform Con-  
gress of a successful attack upon the enemy’s works at  
Stony Point, on the preceding night, by Brigadier Gen-  
eralWayne,&amp; the corps of Light Infantry under his com-  
mand. The ulterior operations in which we have been  
engaged, have hitherto put it out of my power to trans-  
mit the particulars of this interesting event. They will  
now be found in the enclosed report, which I have re-  
ceived from General Wayne. ‘To the encomiums he  
has deservedly bestowed on the officers and men under  
his command, it gives me pleasure to add that his own  
conduct, throughout the whole of this arduous enterprise,  
merits the warmest approbation of Congress. He im-  
| proved upon the plan recommended by me, and execu-  
ted it in a manuver that does signal honour to his judg-  
ment and his bravery. Ina critical moment of the as-  
sault, he received a flesh wound in the head, with a mus-  
ket ball, but continued leading on his men with unsha-  
| ken firmness,  
I now beg leave, for the private satisfaction of Con-  
gress, to explain the motives which induced me to di-  
| rect the attempt.
