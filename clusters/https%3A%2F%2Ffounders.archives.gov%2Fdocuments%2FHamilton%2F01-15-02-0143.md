Philadelphia, August 4th, 1793.  
Sir,  
It appearing that repeated contraventions of our neutrality have taken place in the ports of the United States, without having been discovered in time for prevention or remedy, I have it in command from the President, to address to the collectors of the respective districts a particular instruction on the subject.  
It is expected, that the officers of the customs in each district, will in the course of their official functions have a vigilant eye upon whatever may be passing within the ports, harbours, creeks, inlets and waters of such district, of a nature to contravene the laws of neutrality, and upon discovery of any thing of the kind will give immediate notice to the governor of the state and to the attorney of the judicial district, comprehending the district of the customs within which any such contravention may happen.  
To assist the judgment of the officers on this head, I transmit herewith a schedule of rules, concerning sundry particulars, which have been adopted by the President, as deductions from the laws of neutrality, established and received among nations. Whatever shall be contrary to these rules will, of course, be to be notified, as abovementioned.  
There are some other points, which, pursuant to our treaties and the determinations of the executive, I ought to notice to you.  
If any vessel of either of the powers at war with France should bring or send within your district a prize made of the subjects, people or property of France, it is immediately to be notified to the governor of the state, in order that measures may be taken, pursuant to the 17th article of our treaty with France, to oblige such vessel and her prize, or such prize when sent in without the capturing vessel, to depart.  
No privateer of any of the powers at war with France, coming within a district of the United States, can, by the 22d article of our treaty with France, enjoy any other privilege than that of purchasing such victuals as shall be necessary for her going to the next port of the prince or state, from which she has her commission. If she should do anything beside this, it is immediately to be reported to the governor and the attorney of the district. You will observe by the rules transmitted, that the term privateer is understood not to extend to vessels armed for merchandize and war, commonly called with us letters of marque; nor, of course, to vessels of war in the immediate service of the government of either of the powers at war.  
No armed vessel which has been or shall be originally fitted out in any port of the United States by either of the parties at war is henceforth to have asylum in any district of the United States. If any such armed vessel shall appear within your district, she is immediately to be notified to the governor and attorney of the district; [which is also to be done in respect to any prize that such armed vessel shall bring or send in.] At foot is a list of such armed vessels of the above description as have hitherto come to the knowledge of the executive.  
The purchasing within, and exporting from, the United States, by way of merchandize, articles commonly called contraband (being, generally, warlike instruments and military stores) is free to all the parties at war, and is not to be interfered with. If our own citizens undertake to carry them to any of those parties, they will be abandoned to the penalties which the laws of war authorise.  
You will be particularly careful to observe, and to notify as directed in other instances, the case of any citizen of the United States, who shall be found in the service of either of the parties at war.  
In case any vessel shall be found in the act of contravening any of the rules or principles which are the ground of this instruction, she is to be refused a clearance until she shall have complied with what the governor shall have decided in reference to her. Care, however, is to be taken in this, not unnecessarily or unreasonably to embarrass trade or to vex any of the parties concerned.  
In order that contraventions may be the better ascertained, it is desired that the officer who shall first go on board any vessel arriving within your district shall make an accurate survey of her then condition, as to military equipment, to be forthwith reported to you, and that prior to her clearance a like survey be made, that any transgression of the rules laid down may be ascertained.  
[But as the propriety of any such inspection of a vessel of war in the immediate service of the government of a foreign nation is not without question in reference to the usage of nations, no attempt is to be made to inspect any such vessel till further order on the point.]  
  
The president desires me to signify to you his most particular expectation that the instruction contained in this letter will be executed with the greatest vigilance, activity, care and impartiality. Omissions will tend to expose the government to injurious imputations and suspicions, and proportionably to commit the good faith and peace of the country; objects of too much importance not to engage every proper exertion of your zeal.  
With consideration, I am, Sir   Your obedient servant,

cuftoms within which any fuch contra-  
ventions may happen.  
  
To aflitt the judgment of the officers on  
this head, 1 tranfmit herewith a fchedule  
of rules, concerning fundry particuiars,  
which have been adopted by the Prefident,  
as deduétions from the laws of neutrality,  
eftablifhed and received among nations.  
Whatever fhall be contrary to thefe rules.

tionec.  
  
There are fome other points, which,  
purfuant to our treaties, and the deter-  
minations of the executive, I ought to  
notice to you.  
  
If any veffel of either the powers at war  
with France, fhall bring or fend within  
your diftrict,a prize made of the fubjects,  
people or property of France, it is imme-  
diately to be notified to the Governor of

taken, purfuant to the 17th article of our  
treaty with France, to oblige fuch veflel  
and her prize, or fuch prize when fent ia  
without the capturing veffel, to depart.  
  
No privateer of any of the powers at  
war with France, coming within a dif-  
tri of the United States, can by the 22d  
articls of owr treaty with France, enjoy  
any other privilege than that of purchafing  
fuch victuals as fhall be neceffary for her  
going to the next port of the prince or {tate  
from which fhe has her commiffion, If  
the fhould do any thing befides this, it is  
immediately to be reported to the Gover-  
nof and the attorney of the diftriét. You  
will obferve by the rules tranfmitted, that  
the term privateer is underftood not to ex-  
tend to veffels armed for merchandize and  
war, commonly called with us LETTERS  
@F MARQUK, nor, of courfe to veflels of  
war in the immediate fervice of the go-  
vernment of either of the powers at war.  
  
No armed veffel which has been or fhall  
be originally fitted out in any port of the  
United States, by either of the parties at  
war, is henceforth to have afylum in any  
diftri&amp;t of the United States. If any fuch  
armed veifel fhall appear within your dif-  
tri, the is immediately to be notified to  
the Governor and attorney of the diftriat,  
which is alfo to be done, in refpect to any  
prize that fuch armed veffel fhall bring  
or fendin. At foot is a lift of fuch armed  
veflels of the above defcription as have hi-  
therto come to the knowledge of the exe-  
cutive,  
  
The purchafing within, and exporting  
from the United States, by way of mer-  
  
chandize, articles commonly called con-  
traband (being generally warlike infru-  
ments and military ftores) is free to all the  
parties at war, and is not to be interfered  
with. If our own citizens undertake to  
carry them to any of thofe parttes, they  
will be abandoned to the penalties which  
the laws of war authovife.  
  
You will be particularly careful to obs  
ferve, and to notify as dire€ted in other  
inftances, the cafe of any citizen of the  
United States, who fhall be found in the  
fervice of either of the parties at war.  
  
Imecafe any veflel fhall be found in the  
at @E§ contravening any of the rules or  
principles which are the ground of this ine  
ftruétion, fhe is to be refufed a clearance  
until fhe fhall have complied with what  
the Governor fhall have decided in refere  
ence toher. Care, however, is to be ta-  
ken in this, not unneceflarily or unrea~  
fonably to embarrafs trade, or to vex any  
of the parties concerned.  
  
In order that contraventions may be  
the better afcertained, it is defired that the  
ofhicer who fhall firt go on board any vef-  
fel arriving within your diftriét, fhall make  
  
‘an accurate furvey of her then condition,  
  
as to military equipments, to be forth-  
with reported to you, and that, prior to  
her clearance, a like furvey be made, that  
any tranfgreflion of the rules laid down  
may be afcertained.  
  
But as the propriety of any fuch infpec-  
tion of a veflel of war in the immediate  
fervice of a government of a foreign na-  
tion, is not without queftion in reference  
to the ufage of nations, no attempt is to  
be made to infpeét any fuch veffel until  
further order on the point.  
  
The Prefident defires me to fignify to  
you his moft particular expectation, that  
the inftrution contained in this jetter will  
be executed with the greateft vigilence,  
activity, care and impartiality. Omiffions  
will tend to expofe the government to in-  
jurious imputations and fufpicions, and  
proportionably to commit the good faith  
and peace of the country 5 objects of too  
much importance not to engage every pry-  
per exertion of your zeal.

Philadelphia, JnguJ] 4th, 1793.  
Sir,  
tT appearing th.it repeated conrraventi­  
ons of our neu.ralitv have taken place  
in t&#x27;le ports of the United States, without  
having been discovered in time tor preven  
tion or remedy, I have it i&#x27;l command  
fro&#x27;n the Prel&#x27;dent, to address t«&gt; the col  
lectors of the refpeftive di(lii£ts a particu­  
lar inflruction on the fubjeft.  
It is expected, that the officers of the  
cn&#x27;totns in each diftrift, will i;i the course  
of their official fpnflions have a vigilan  
eye upon whatever may be paffirg within  
tile ports, harbours, creeks, inlets and wa­  
ters of fiich diltrifl, of a nature to contra­  
vene the la« s of neutrality, and upon dis­  
covery of any thing of the kind, will rive  
immediate notice to he governor of the  
ft ate. and to the attorney qf the judicial  
&lt;liftrict, comprehending the diltrift ol the  
ciiftonis within which any such contraven­  
tion m.tv happen.  
To a&#x27;fift the judgment of the officers on  
thi„ head, I tra ifmit herewith a schedule  
of rvilrs, concerning fu idry particulars,  
which have been adopted by the&#x27;Prefident,  
as deductions from the laws of nenrrality.  
established and received among nations.  
Whatever (hall be contrary to these rt&#x27;les  
will, of course, be to be notified, as above­  
mentioned.  
There are some other points, which,  
pursuant to our treaties and the determi  
nations of the executive, I to notice  
to you.  
If any veflei of either of the powers at  
-war with France should bring or fend with­  
in your diltrift a prize made of the fubje£ts,  
people or propertv of France, it is inime­  
(liately to be i.&#x27;Otmed to the governor of the  
Hate, in order that measures may be taken,  
pursuant to the 17th article of our treaty  
with France, to rblige such ,ve(Tel and her  
prize, or such prize when fe it in without  
the capturing vefiel, to depart.  
No privateer of any of the powers at  
war with France, coining within adiftrict  
of the United States, can. by the twentv­  
fecond article of our treaty with France,  
enjoy any other privilege than that of 1 pur­  
chaling such vi£tuals as (hall be necelfary  
for her going to the next port of the prime  
orflate Irom which (be has hercommiflion.&#x27;  
If (he should do any thing belide this, it is  
immediately to be reported to the governor  
and the attorney of the diltricl. You will  
observe by the ruies tranfinitted. that the  
term privateer is undei flood not to ex&#x27;end  
to vefl&#x27;tls armed for merchandize and war,  
commonly called with us letters of marque,  
nor. of course, to vefl&#x27;els of war in the im­  
mediate service of the government of  
either of the powers at war.  
No armed vefiel which has been or fha&#x27;l  
be originally fitted out in any port of tne  
United States by either of the parties at

which is also to be done, in refpeft to anv  
prize, that such vefTel fhali bring or fend  
in. At foot is a lilt of such armed vefTel;  
of the above defcriptton as have hitherto  
come to the knowledge of the executive.  
The pnrchaling within, and exporting

chandize, articles commonly called contra­  
band (beinggenerally, warlike instruments  
and military ltores) is free to all the parties  
at war, arid is not to be interfered with.  
If our own citizens undertake to cari v  
tiiem to any of those parties, they will be  
abandoned to the penalties which the lawt  
of war authorise.  
You will be particularly careful to ob­  
serve, nnd to notify as direitsd in other  
instances, the cafe of any citizen of the  
United States, who fliall be found in the  
service of either of the parties at war.  
In cafe any vefiel fliall be found in the

In order that contraventions may be the

Philadelphia, Augufl 4th, 1.793&#x27;  
  
Sir,  
T aoffcaring that repealed contravene

without having been discovered in time

Upon whatever may be passing within the

ravqntion (nay happen. *  
  
l*o afiift the judgment of the officeis  
in thi* head, I transmit herewith a  
fchedulf.of rules, concerning lundty par­  
ticulars, which Toavr been adopted by the

these rules will, of course, be to be noti­  
fied,.. as abovementiontd.  
There are fume other points, which,  
purfoant to oilr treaties and the determi­  
nations of the executive, I ought to no­  
tice to yoB.  
If- any vessel of either of the powers at  
war toithFrance (hould bring or fendwith­  
in your diltrid a prize made of the fub­  
je£b, people of property of France, it is  
immediately to be notified to the Govern­  
or of the (late, in order that meafuics  
may be taken, pursuant to the 17th arti­  
cle of our treaty with France, to dblige  
such vcfl&#x27;el and her prize, or such prize  
when sent in without the capturing ves­  
sel, to depart. |  
No privateer of any of the powers at  
war with France, coming within a diilritt  
of the United States, can, by the 23d  
article of our treaty with France, enjoy  
any Other privilege than that ofpurchafing  
I&quot;tub viduals as Jhallbe Aeceffary for her go­  
ing to tie next port of the prince otflat&#x27;efrom  
•which fht bat her commtjfion. If lhe should  
do any thing bcfide this, it is immedi­  
ately to he reported to the governor and  
the attorney of the diilrift. You willob­  
ferve by the rules transmitted, that the  
term privateer is underltood not to extend  
to veifJs aimed for merchandize and war,  
commonly called with us letters of marque,  
nor, of course, to vefiicls of war i» the im.  
mediate Service of the government of ei­  
thei ot th« powers at war.  
No armed, veifelwhich has bern or (hall  
be originally fitted out 111 any port of the  
United States by either of the .parties at  
war is henceforth to have afyltim in any  
diftri&amp; of the United States. If any  
such armed vtffcl lhallappear within your  
dilliift, (he is immediately to be notified  
to the governor and attorney of the dif­  
tfiHj which isalfo to be done, in refpeft  
to any prize, that such armed vessel (hall  
bring fend in. At foot is a lift of such  
Armed vcffcls of the above description as  
have hitherto come to the knowledge of  
the executive.  
  
The pu&lt;chafing within, and export­  
ing from, ihe United Stales, ly ivay of  
merchandize, articles commonly called  
contiaband (being generally, wailike in­  
ftruraeuts and military stores) is free to  
all the parties at war, and is not to, be in­  
terfered with. If our own citizens an*  
dertake to carry them to any of those  
partie«, they will be abandoned to the  
penalties which the laws of warauthorife.  
You will be particularly careful to ob­  
serve, and to notifyas dire&amp;ed in other  
instances, the cafe of any citizen of the  
United States, who shall be found in the  
service of&#x27; either of the parties at war.  
  
In cafe any vefiel (hall be found in the  
ast of contravening any of the rules or  
principles which are the ground of this  
inftruftion, (he is to be refufed a clear­  
ance until (he (hall have complied with  
  
what the governor (hall have decided in  
reference to her. Cave, however, is to  
be taken in this, notunneceflarily or un­  
reasonably to euibauais trade or to vex  
  
soy of the pvtiesconcrtwd.  
In order ih«t contraventions may be the  
  
betttr afcertaiued, it is de fired that the  
officer who (hall firft go on board any ves­  
sel arriving within your diftriA (hall make  
an accurate furry of her then condition,  
  
as to miiiiary equipment, to be forthwith  
repotted to yon, and that prior to her  
clearance a like fumy be made, that any  
tranfgrelfion of the rules laid down maju  
be afcettained.  
But as the propriety-os any such &gt;n­  
fpe&amp;ion of a vejfel of war in the immediate s  
service of the government of a foreign nati­  
on is not without queltion in refettnee to  
the usage of nations, no attempt is to be  
made to infpeA any such veffeltill further  
order on the point.  
The President desires tjie to fignify *o  
you his mod particular expectation that,  
the inftruftion contained in this Jitter  
will be executed with the greatest vigil­

Phisadelpria, Aupuft 4, 1793-  
SIR,  
T appearing that repeated contraventions of  
our outrality-have takea place in the ports of  
  
the United States, without haying beea dilcovered  
in time for prevention or ‘remedy, I “have it in  
commadd*from the Prefident, to addrefs to the  
collectors of the refpective diftritts a particular ine  
ftruction on the fubject.  
  
itis expected that the officers of the cuftoms ia  
each difirict, will in the courfe, of their. official  
functions have a vigilant eye upoa whatéver may  
be palling within the ports, harbours, Creeks, m=  
lets and waters of fuch diftritts of a mature to con-  
travene tne laws of nutrality, and upon difcovery  
of any. thing of the kind wili give immediate no-  
tice to the governor of the fate and co the attor-  
mey of the judicial diftri€t, comprehending the  
diftrict of the cultoms withia which any fuch con-  
traventions may happen.  
  
To afi che judgement of the cflicers on this  
head, | tranfmit herewith a {Chedule of rules,  
concerning fundry particulars, which have been  
adopted by the Prefident, as deductions from the  
laws of notrality, eftablithed aid seceived amon  
nations. Whasever fhall be costraty to thei  
rules, will of courfe, be notified; as above men-  
tioned,  
  
There are fome other points, which, purfuant to  
onr treaties and the determinations of the executive,  
I ough: to notice to you,  
  
If any veifel of either the powers at war with  
France, fhall bring or feod within your diftri@ a  
prize made of the fubje€ts people or property of  
France, it is immediately to be notified to the  
govermor of the ftate, in order that meafures may  
be taken, purfaant to the 17th article of our treaty  
with France, to oblige fuch veflelyand her prize,  
or fuch prize when fent in without the capturing  
veffel, to depart.  
  
No privateer of any of the powers at war with  
France, coming within a diitri¢t of the United  
States, can by the 22d article of our treaty with  
France, enjoy any other privilege than chat of puar-  
chafing fuch vidtuals as fPall be neceffary for her  
going to the next port of the prince or flate from  
which the hasher commiffion. Jf the fhould do  
any thing befides this, it is immediately to be re-  
ported to the governor and the attorney of the  
diftritt. You will obferve by the rules tran{mitted,  
that the term privateer is underftood not to extend  
to veflels armed for merchandize and war, com-  
monly called with us /eiters of marque, nor, of  
courfe to veffels of war in the immediate fervice of  
the government of either of the powers at war.  
  
No armed veffe] which has been or thai! be  
Originally fitted-out in any port of the United  
States, by either of the parties at war, is hence  
forth to have afylum in any diftridt of the United  
States. If any fuch armed vefiel thal) appear  
within your diftriét, the is immediately tu be noti-  
fied to the governor and attorney of the diftridl ;  
which is alfoto be doné, in refpe&amp; to any prize,  
that fuch armed veffel fhall bring or fend in. At  
foot isa Nift of fuch armed veflels of the above  
defcription as have hitherto come to the knowledge  
of the executive. #  
  
The purchafing withia, and exporting from  
the United States, by way of merchandize, arri-  
cles commonly ca&#x27;led contraband (beibg general-  
ly warlike inflruments and military ftore) ‘is free  
tO ai] the partivs @ war; aad is “tor be inrérfered  
  
  
  
  
  
viva. If puryow™ citizens undertake to carry  
¢ ‘them to any of thofe parties, they will be a-  
‘bandoned to the penalties which the laws of war  
authorile,  
  
You wil! be particularly careful to obferve, and  
to notify aadireted in other inftatices, the cafe of  
any citizen of the United States,” who fhall  
be found in the fervice of either of the parties  
at war.  
  
In ‘cafe any veffe! thal! be found in the a&amp; of  
; contravening any of the-rules or principles which  
4 are the ground of this iuitrugion, fhe is to be re-  
tL ©  fuled a clearance -until’ the thal! have complied  
; with what the governor thall have decided in  
el refezrénce to to her.) Care, however is to. be ta-  
ken mm thisy not unneceffarily or unrealonably to  
eurbarrals trade, or to vex any of the parties  
concerned,” “) | *  
  
Ia Order that contraventions may be the better  
afcertained, it is dehred that the officer who  
fall ficlt go on board any veifel arriving within  
your diftrict, fhail make an accurate furvey of Her  
then condition, as to military equipments, to be  
forthwith reported to you, and that, prior  
to her clearance; a like furvey be made, that  
any tranfgreffion’ of the rales laid down may be  
afce rtained,  
  
But as the propriety of any fuch infpeQion of a  
veffel of war in the immediate fervice of a go-  
veroment of -a foreiga nation, is uot without  
ueltion in refereace to the Ofige of nations, no  
attempt is te be made to&#x27;infpett any fach ‘veffel un-  
til farther orderon the point.  
  
he Prefident defires me to fignify to yoo his  
mom particular expectation, that the infiruction  
contained in chis letter will -be executed with the  
greateft vigilence, activity, care and impartiality.  
Onmiflions will tend to expofe the government to  
injurious imputations and fofpicions, and propor -  
tionably to commit the good faith and peace of the  
covatry ; objets of too much importance not to  
engage every proper exertion of your zeal.

; Philadelphia, Aduguft 41h, 1793.  
IR,  
IT appearing that repeated con­  
travention of our neutrality  
has taken place in the ports of  
the United States, without hav­  
ing been discovered in time for  
prevention or remedy, I have it  
in command from the President,  
to address to the colleors of  
the respective districts a parti­  
cular instruction on the subject.  
It is expected that the officers  
of the customs in each diftrié,  
will in the course of their official  
functions, have a vigilant eye up­  
on whatever may be pafling with­  
in the ports, harbours, creeks,  
inlets and waters of such diftri@  
of a nature to contravene the  
laws of neutrality, and upon dis­  
covery of any thing of the kind,  
will give immediate notice to the  
governor of the state and to the  
attorney of the judicial district,  
comprehending the diftriét of the  
customs within which any such  
contravention ma# happen.  
To aflift the judgment of the  
officers on this head, I transmit  
herewith a {fchedule of rules, con­  
cerning sundry particulars, which  
have been adopted by the Presi­  
dent, as deductions from the laws  
of neutrality, established and re­  
ceived among nations. Whatever  
shall be contrary to these rules  
will, of course, be to be notified,  
as abovementioned.  
There are some other points,  
which, pursuant to our treaties  
  
T HE  
  
and the determination of the ex­  
ccutive, I ought to notice you.  
If any veflel of cither of the  
powers at war with France should  
bring or fend within your district  
a prize made of the {ubjects, peo­  
ple or property of France, it is  
immediately to be notified to the  
Governor of the state, in order.  
that measures may be taken, pur­  
suant to the 17th article of our  
treaty with France, to oblige such  
veflel and her prize, or such prize  
when sent in without the cap­  
turing veflel, to depart.  
No privateer of any of the  
powers at war with France, com­  
ing within a diftri¢t of the U­  
nited States, can, by the 22d ar­  
ticle of our treaty with France,  
enjoy any other privilege than  
that of purchasing such vituals  
as shall be neceflary for her going  
to the next port of the prince or  
state from which she has her  
commiflion. If she should do any  
thing beside this, it is immediately  
to be reported to the governor  
and the attorney of the dittrict.  
You will observe by the rules  
transmitted, that the term priva­  
teer is understood not to extend  
to veflels armed for merchandize  
and war, commonly called with  
us letters of margue, nor of course  
to veflels of war in the immedi­  
ate service of the government of  
cither of the powers at war.  
  
No armed veflel which has  
been or shall be originally fitted  
out in any port of the United  
States by either of the parties at  
war 18 henceforth to have asylum  
inany district of the United States.  
If any such armed vessel shall ap­  
pear within your diftri&amp;, she is  
immediately to be notified to the  
governor_ and attorney of the  
diftri¢t ; which is also to be done  
in respect to any prize, that such  
armed vessel shall bring or fend  
in. At foot isa lift of such ar­  
med veflels of the above descrip­  
tion as have hitherto come to  
the knowledge of the executive.  
The purchasing within, and ex­  
porting from the United Srates,  
by way of merchandize, articles  
commonly called contraband  
(being generally, warlike instru­  
ments and military stores) is free  
to all the parties at war, and is  
not to be interfered with. If  
our own citizens undertake to  
carry them to any of those par­  
ties, they will be abandoned to  
the penalties which the laws of  
war authorife.  
You will be particularly care­  
ful to observe, and to notify as  
dire¢ted in other instances, the  
case of any citizen of the United  
States, who shall be found in the  
service of either of the parties at  
war.  
In case any vessel shall be found  
in the at of contravening any of  
the rules on principles which are  
the ground of this inftruéion,  
she ils to be refufed a clearance

until she shall have coniplied with  
what the governor shall have de­  
cided in reference to her, Care,  
however, is to be taken in this,  
not unneccflarily or unreasonably  
to embarrass trade or to vex any  
of the parties concerned.  
In order that contraventions  
may be the better ascertained, it  
is desired that the officer who  
thall firft go on board any vefiel  
arriving within your district, shall  
make an accurate survey of her  
then condition, “as to military  
cquipment, to be forthwith rc­  
ported to you, and that prior to  
her clearance a like survey be  
made, that any tranfgreflion of  
the rules laid down beafcertained.  
Butas the propriety of any such  
inspection of a veflel of war in  
the immediate service of the gov­  
ernment of a foreign nation is not  
without question in interfercice  
to the usage of nations, no at­  
tempt is to be made to infped  
any {uch veflel &#x27;till further order  
on the point.  
The President desires me to  
(ignify to you his most particular  
expectation that the instruction  
contained in this letter will be  
cxecuted with the greatest vigi­  
lance, activity, care and impar­  
tiality. Omiflions will tend to  
expose the government to injuri­  
ous imputations and f{ufpicions,  
and proportionably to commit  
the good tfaith and peace of the  
country ; objeéts of too much  
Importance not to engage every  
proper exertion of your zeal.
