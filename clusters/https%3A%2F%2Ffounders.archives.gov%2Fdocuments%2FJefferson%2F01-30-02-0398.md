I wish it were possible to obtain a single amendment to our constitution; I would be willing to depend on that alone for the reduction of the administration of our government to the genuine principles of it’s constitution; I mean an additional article taking from the federal government the power of borrowing. I now deny their power of making paper money or any thing else a legal tender. I know that to pay all proper expences within the year would, in case of war, be hard on us. but not so hard as ten wars instead of one. for wars would be reduced in that proportion. besides that the state governments would be free to lend their credit in borrowing quotas.—for the present I should be for resolving the alien &amp; sedition laws to be against the constitution &amp; merely void, and for addressing the other states to obtain similar declarations: and I would not do any thing at this moment which should commit us further, but reserve ourselves to shape our future measures or no measures, by the events which may happen. it is a singular phaenomenon, that while our state governments are the very best in the world without exception or comparison, our general government has, in the rapid course of 9. or 10. years, become more arbitrary, and has swallowed more of the public liberty than even that of England. I inclose you a column cut out of a London paper to shew you that the English tho charmed with our making their enemies our enemies, yet they blush and weep over our sedition law.—but I inclose you something more important. it is a petition for a reformation in the manner of appoin
