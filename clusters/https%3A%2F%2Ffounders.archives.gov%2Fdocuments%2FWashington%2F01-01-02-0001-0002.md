Tuesday 15th. We set out early with Intent to Run round the sd. Land but being taken in a Rain &amp; it Increasing very fast obliged us to return. It clearing about one oClock &amp; our time being too Precious to Loose we a second time ventured out &amp; Worked hard till Night &amp; then returnd to Penningtons we got our Suppers &amp; was Lighted in to a Room &amp; I not being so good a Woodsman as the rest of my Company striped my self very orderly  
  
&amp; went in to the Bed as they call’d it when to my Surprize I found it to be nothing but a Little Straw—Matted together without Sheets or any thing else but only one Thread Bear blanket with double its Weight of Vermin such as Lice Fleas &amp;c. I was glad to get up (as soon as the Light was carried from us) &amp; put on my Cloths &amp; Lay as my Companions. Had we not have been very tired, I am sure we should not have slep’d much that night. I made a Promise not to Sleep so from that time forward chusing rather to sleep in the open Air before a fire as will Appear hereafter.  
  
  
  
  
On this day the party surveyed a tract of land for George William Fairfax on Cates Marsh and Long Marsh, the “names of small streams which flow from the foothill of North mountain to the Shenandoah river and have along their course considerable meadow or marshy land” (TONER [1]J. M. Toner, ed. Journal of My Journey Over the Mountains; by George Washington, While Surveying for Lord Thomas Fairfax, Baron of Cameron, in the Northern Neck of Virginia, beyond the Blue Ridge, in 1747–8. Albany, 1892., 26).  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Wednesday 16th. We set out early &amp; finish’d about one oClock &amp; then Travell’d up to Frederick Town where our Baggage came  
  
to us. We cleaned ourselves (to get Rid of the Game we had catched the Night before) &amp; took a Review of the Town &amp; then return’d to our Lodgings where we had a good Dinner prepar’d for us Wine &amp; Rum Punch in Plenty &amp; a good Feather Bed with clean Sheets which was a very agreeable regale.  
  
  
  
  
Thursday 17th. Rain’d till Ten oClock &amp; then clearing we reached as far as Major Campbells one of there Burgesses about 25 Miles from Town. Nothing Remarkable this day nor Night but that we had a Tolerable good Bed [to] lay on

Fryday 18th. We Travell’d up about 35 Miles to Thomas Barwicks on Potomack where we found the River so excessively high by Reason of the Great Rains that had fallen up about the Allegany Mountains as they told us which was then bringing down the melted Snow &amp; that it would not be fordable for severall Days it was then above Six foot Higher than usual &amp; was Rising. We agreed to stay till Monday. We this day call’d to see the Fam’d Warm Springs. We camped out in the field this Night. Nothing Remarkable happen’d till sunday the 20th.  
  
  
  
Thomas Barwick (Berwick?) was settled in Frederick County as early as 1744 and served as a juror in the county court in February of that year (CARTMELLT. K. Cartmell. Shenandoah Valley Pioneers and Their Descendants: A History of Frederick County, Virginia, From its Formation in 1738 to 1908. Winchester, Va., 1909., 23).  
  
  
  
  
Warm Springs is now Bath, or Berkeley Springs, Morgan County, W.Va.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Sunday 20th. Finding the River not much abated we in the Evening Swam our horses over &amp; carried them to Charles Polks in Maryland for Pasturage till the next Morning.  
  
  
  
Charles Polk had land under cultivation in the area as early as 1748 (NORRIS [1]J. E. Norris, ed. History of the Lower Shenandoah Valley. 1890. Reprint. Berryville, Va., 1972., 68).  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Monday 21st. We went over in a Canoe &amp; Travell’d up Maryland side all the Day in a Continued Rain to Collo. Cresaps right against the Mouth of the South Branch about 40 Miles from Polks I believe the Worst Road that ever was trod by Man or Beast

speaker made a grand speech, telling them  
in what manner they were to dance.
