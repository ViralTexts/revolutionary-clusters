rcular of August 15. 1796 also enclosed.—But the question is in itself important and so intimately connected with the contending local interests of the Union that it seems proper to submit it to your decision.  
The Act “concerning the registering and recording of Ships or Vessels” passed 31. December 1792 declares that Vessels built within the United States and belonging wholly to citizens of the United States, vessels owned by Citizens on the 16 May 1789, and Vessels condemned as prizes or for breach of any law, and no other may be registered—and that registered vessels alone (coasting &amp; fishing vessels excepted) shall be denominated and deemed ships or vessels of the United States entitled to the benefit and privileges appertaining to such ships or vessels.  
Vessels not built within the United States and owned by Citizens since 16 May 1789, are not entitled to register and so far as relates to duties on tonnage and imported Merchandize are considered as foreign bottoms, the lower rate of duty being a privilege or benefit appertaining only to registered vessels technically called “Vessels of the United States”—But they are

rican Vessels and their owners not being forbidden to hold that kind of property, are entitled to receive from Government the same protection which is given to every other Vessel, and every benefit from which they are not precluded by law. They receive, therefore, those passports called Sealetters, which are rendered necessary for the protection and safety of our Vessels in relation to European Nations on account of our treaties with them. But they are refused those passports called Mediterranean passes which are necessary for their protection against the Barbary powers by Virtue of our treaties with them.  
By the Act providing passports for the Ships and vessels of the United States passed 1. June 1796. it is enacted that every Vessel of the United States going to a foreign Country shall be obliged to receive a passport of a form prescribed by the President and paying 10 dollars for the same, and that the Collectors shall be obliged to furnish every such vessel with such a passport.  
Under that law it has been contended that registered Vessels alone were entitled to receive Med
