ian neighbors also a spirit of peace and friendship generally prevails; &amp; I am happy to inform you that the continued efforts to introduce among them the implements &amp; the practice of husbandry &amp; of the houshold arts have not been without success: that they are becoming more &amp; more sensible of the superiority of this dependance, for clothing &amp; subsistence, over the precarious resources of hunting &amp; fishing: &amp; already we are able to announce that, instead of that constant diminution of numbers produced by their wars &amp; their wants, some of them begin to experience an increase of population.  
  
Tripoli.  
To this state of general peace with which we have been blessed, one only exception exists. Tripoli, the least considerable of the Barbary states, had come forward with demands unfounded either in right or in compact, &amp; had permitted itself to denounce war, on our failure to comply before a given day. the style of the demand admitted but one answer. I sent a small squadron of frigates into the Mediterranean, with assurances to that power of our sincere desire to remain in peace; but with orders to protect our commerce against the threatened attack. the measure was seasonable &amp; salutary. the Bey had already declared war in form. his cruisers were out. two had arrived at Gibraltar. our commerce in the Mediterranean was blockaded: and that of the Atlantic in peril. the arrival of our squadron dispelled the danger. one of the Tripolitan cruisers h

n. unauthorised by the constitution, without the sanction of Congress, to go beyond the line of defence, the vessel being disabled from committing further hostilities, was liberated with it’s crew. the legislature will doubtless consider whether, by authorising measures of offence also, they will place our force on an equal footing with that of it’s adversaries. I communicate all material information on this subject, that in the exercise of the important function, confided by the constitution to the legislature exclusively, their judgment may form itself on a knolege &amp; consideration of every circumstance of weight.  
  
Algiers. Tunis.  
I wish I could say that our situation with all the other Barbary states was entirely satisfactory. discovering that some delays had taken place in the performance of certain articles stipulated by us, I thought it my duty, by immediate measures for fulfilling them, to vindicate to ourselves the right of considering the effect of departure from stipulation on their side. from the papers which will be laid before you, you will be enabled to judge whether our treaties are regarded by them as fixing at all the measure of their demands; or as guarding from the exercise of force our vessels within their power: &amp; to consider how far it will be safe and expedient to leave our affairs with them in their present posture.  
  
Census.  
I lay before you the result of the Census lately taken of our inhabitants, to a conformity with which we are now to reduce the ensuing ratio of representation &amp; taxation. you will percieve that the increase of numbers during the last ten years, proceeding in geometrical ratio, promises a duplication in little more than twenty two years. we contemplate this rapid growth, &amp; the prospect it holds up to us, not with a view to the injuries it may enable us to do to others in some future day, but to the settlement of the extensive country, still remaining vacant within our limits, to the multiplication of men, susceptible of happiness, educated in the love of order, habituated to self-government, &amp; valuing it’s blessings above all price.  
  
Finances.  
Other circumstances, combined with the increase of numbers, have produced an augmentation of revenue arising from consumption in a ratio far beyond that of population alone: and tho’ the changes in foreign relations, now taking place so desireably for the whole world, may for a season affect this branch of revenue, yet weighing all probabilities of expence, as well as of income, there is reasonable ground of conf

t to promote. I will cause to be laid before you an essay towards a statement, of those who, under public employment of various kinds, draw money from the treasury, or from our citizens. time has not permitted a perfect enumeration, the ramifications of office being too multiplied &amp; remote to be completely traced in a first trial. among those who are dependant on Executive discretion, I have begun the reduction of what was deemed unnecessary. the expences of diplomatic agency have been considerably diminished. the Inspectors of internal revenue, who were found to obstruct the accountability of the institution, have been discontinued. several agencies, created by Executive authority, on salaries fixed by that also, have been suppressed, and should suggest the expediency of regulating that power by law, so as to subject it’s exercises to legislative inspection &amp; sanction. other reformations of the same kind will be pursued with that caution which is requisite, in removing useless things, not to injure what is retained. but the great mass of public offices is established by law, &amp; therefore by law alone can be abolished. should the legislature think it expedient to pass this roll in review, and to try all it’s parts by the test of public utility, they may be assured of every aid &amp; light which Executive information can yield. considering the general tendency to multiply offices and dependancies, &amp; to increase expence to the ultimate term of burthen which the citizen can bear, it behoves us to avail ourselves of every occasion which presents itself for taking off the surcharge; that it never may be seen here that, after leaving to labour the smallest portion of it’s earnings on which it can subsist, government shall itself consume the whole residue of what it was instituted to guard.  
  
Appropriations.  
In our care too of the public contributions entrusted to our direction, it would be prudent to multiply barriers against their dissipation, by appropriating specific sums to every specific purpose susceptible of definition; by disallowing all applications of money varying from the appropriation in object, or transcending it in amount; by reducing the undefined field of Contingencies, &amp; thereby circumscribing discretionary powers over money; and by bringing back to a single department all accountabilities for money, where the examinations may be prompt, efficacious, &amp; uniform.  
An account of the reciepts &amp; expenditures of the last year, as prepared by the Secretary of the treasury, will as usual be laid before you. the success which has attended the late sales of the public lands shews that, with attention, they may be made an important source of reciept. among the paiments, those made in discharge of the principal &amp; interest of the national debt, will shew that the public faith has been exactly maintained. to these will be added an Estimate of appropriations necessary for the ensuing year. this last will of course be affected by such modifications of the system of expence as you shall think proper to adopt.  
  
Army.  
A statement has been formed by the Secretary at war, on mature consideration of all the forts &amp; stations where garrisons will be expedient, &amp; of the number of men requisite for each garrison. the whole amount is considerably short of the present military establishment. for the surplus, no particular use can be pointed out. for defence against invasion, their number is as nothing. nor is it concieved needful or safe that a standing army should be kept up, in time of peace, for that purpose. uncertain as we must ever be of the particular point in our circumference where an enemy may chuse to invade us, the only force which can be ready at every point, &amp; competent to oppose them, is the body of neighboring citizens, as formed into a militia. on these, collected from the parts most convenient, in numbers proportioned to the invading force, it is best to rely, not only to meet the first attack, but, if it threatens to be permanent, to maintain the defence until regulars may be engaged to relieve them. these considerations render it important that we should, at every session continue to amend the defects, which from time to time shew themselves, in the laws for regulating the militia, until they are sufficiently perfect: nor should we now, or at any time, separate, until we can say we have done every thing for the militia which we could do were an enemy at our door.  
  
The provision of military stores on hand will be laid before you, that you may judge of the additions still requisite.  
  
Navy.  
With respect to the extent to which our naval preparations should be carried some difference of opinion may be expected to appear: but just attention to the circumstances of every part of the Union will doubtless reconcile all. a small force will probably continue to be wanted for actual service in the Mediterranean. whatever annual sum beyond that you may think proper to appropriate, to naval preparations, would perhaps be better employed in providing those articles which may be kept without waste or consumption, &amp; be in readiness when any exigence calls them into use.  Progress has been made, as will appear by papers now communicated, in providing materials for seventy-four-gun ships as directed by law.  
  
Navy Yards.  
How far the authority given by the legislature for procuring &amp; establishing sites for naval purposes, has been perfectly understood &amp; pursued in the execution, admits of some doubt. a statement of the expences already incurred on that subject is now laid before you. I have, in certain cases, suspended or slackened these expenditures, that the legislature might determine whether so many Yards are necessary as have been contemplated. the works at this place are among those permitted to go on; &amp; five of the seven frigates directed to be laid up, have been brought and laid up here, where, besides the safety of their position, they are under the eye of the Executive administration, as well as of it’s agents, and where yourselves also will be guided by your own view, in the legislative provisions respecting them, which may from time to time be necessary. they are preserved in such condition, as well the vessels as whatever belongs to them, as to be at all times ready for sea on a short warning. two others are yet to be laid up, so soon as they shall have recieved the repairs requisite to put them also into sound condition.  As a superintending officer will be necessary at each yard, his duties &amp; emoluments hitherto fixed by the Executive will be a more proper subject for legislation. a communication will also be made of our progress in the execution of the law respecting the vessels directed to be sold.  
  
Fortifications.  
Fortifications. The fortifications of our harbours, more or less advanced, present considerations of great difficulty. while some of them are on a scale sufficiently proportioned to the advantages of their position, to the efficacy of their protection, &amp; the importance of the points within it, others are so extensive, will cost so much in their first erection, so much in their maintenance, and require such a force to garrison them, as to make it questionable what is best now to be done.  a statement of those commenced, or projected, of the expences already incurred, &amp; estimates of their future cost, as far as can be foreseen, shall be laid before you, that you may be enabled to judge whether any alteration is necessary in the laws respecting this subject.  
  
Agriculture Manufactures Commerce Navigation.  
Agriculture, manufactures, commerce &amp; navigation, the four pillars of our prosperity, are then most thriving when left most free to individual enterprize. protection from casual embarrasments however may sometimes be seasonably interposed. if, in the course of your observations or enquiries, they should appear to need any aid, within the limits of our constitutional powers, your sense of their importance is a sufficient assurance they will occupy your attention. we cannot indeed but all feel an anxious solicitude for the difficulties

The Judiciary system of the United states, &amp; especially that portion of it recently erected, will of course present itself to the contemplation of Congress. and that they may be able to judge of the proportion which the institution bears to the business it has to perform, I have caused to be procured from the several states, and now lay before Congress, an exact statement of all the causes decided since the first establishment of the courts, &amp; of those which were depending when additional courts &amp; judges were brought in to their aid.  
  
Juries.  
And while on the Judiciary organisation, it will be worthy your consideration whether the protection of the inestimable institution of juries has been extended to all the cases involving the security of our persons &amp; property.  Their impartial selection also being essential to their value, we ought further to consider whether that is sufficiently secured in those states where they are named by a marshal depending on Executive will, or designated by the court, or by officers dependant on them.  
  
Naturalisation.  
I cannot omit recommending a revisal of the laws on the subject of naturalisation. considering the ordinary chances of human life, a denial of citizenship under a residence of fourteen years, is a denial to a great proportion of those who ask it: and controuls a policy pursued, from their first settlement, by many of these states, &amp; still believed of consequence to their prosperity. and shall we refuse, to the unhappy fugitives from distress, that hospitality which the savages of the wilderness extended to our fathers arriving in this land? shall oppressed humanity find no asylum on this globe? the constitution indeed has wisely provided that, for admission to certain offices of important trust, a residence shall be required, sufficient to develope character &amp; design. but might not the general character &amp; capabilities of a citizen be safely communicated to everyone manifesting a bonâ fide purpose of embarking his life &amp; fortunes permanently with us? with restrictions perhaps to gua

. FOR FEBRUARY ilo».  
  
  
In our ctre too of the public contri-  
betiont entruHed Co our dlrr^ion, it  
would be prudent to multiply barriers  
jgainlt their dilfipation, by appropriat¬  
ing fpeclhc fumt to every I&#x27;pecihc pur-  
pofe iufceptible of dehnition t by dif-  
allowirg ail applications of money vary¬  
ing from the appropriation in obje^ or  
tranlcending it in amount ) by reducing  
ibe undetineJ field of contingencies, and  
thereby circumfcrihing difcrerionary  
powers over money ; and by bringing  
back to a tingle department alt account¬  
abilities for money, where the cxamina.  
lion may be prompt, efficacious, and  
uniform.  
  
An account of the receipts and ex.  
penditures of the lad year, as prepaied  
by the Secretary of the Treafui&#x27;v, will,  
as ufull, be laid before you. The fuc-  
ccfs which has attended the late talcs of  
the public lands thews that, with atten¬  
tion, they may be made an important  
fource of receipt. Among the pavments,  
thole made in difeharge of the principal  
and iniereit of tlve national debt will Ihcw  
that the public faith has been exactly  
maintained. To theie will be added an  
eltiinare of appropriations nccelTary for  
theenfuing year. This lalt will ofcourie  
|&gt;e elfeded by fuch modifications of the  
fyffem of expence as you fhali think pro¬  
per to adopt.  
  
A liatcmciit has been formed by the  
Secrettry at War, on mature confideia-  
tion of all the pods and Ifatioiis whrie  
gtfiSfous will be ex|&gt;edient, and of the  
nunditr c)t men lequihte for each gaiii-  
fon. The whole amount is conlidcrabiy  
fh&lt;&gt;rt of tile prefenr military ellabiini-  
ment. Foi the iuiplus no particular uie  
can be pointed out. For defence ag-Ainit  
invafion, their number is as nothing i iiur  
is it cunlidered needful or late that a  
tianding army ftiould be kept up, in time  
ol peace. Uncertain as we mult ever be  
cl the particular point in our circumfer¬  
ence where an enemy may chufc to invade  
^us, the only toice which can be ready at  
every point, and competent to oppofe  
them, is the body of neighbouring  
Citizens, as formed into a militia. On  
theie collected from the parts molt con¬  
venient, io numbers proportioned to the  
invading force, it is belt to rely, not only  
i to meet the tirli attack, but if it threatens  
to he permanent, to maintain the defence  
until the regulars may he engaged to re¬  
lieve them. Thofe conhderatiuns render  
St important that we fhould, at every  
feflion, continue to amend the defeats,  
&lt;vhicb from time to timefhew thcmfelvci,  
  
in the laws for regulating the miiitia*  
until they are futiiciently perfcH i nor  
fhould we now, or at any time, kparate*  
until we can lay we have done every  
thing for the militia which we could  
do, weie an enemy at our door*  
  
The provilion of military ftoret on.  
hand will he laid before you, that yoa  
may judge of the additions liilJ re^ui-  
lite.  
  
With refpefl to the extent to which  
our preparations fhould be carried, fotne  
dirf&#x27;erence of opinion may he expeded to  
appear ^ hut Juit attention to the circum*  
Ifances of every pait of the union will  
doubt let&#x27;s reconcile all. A fmall force  
will probably continue to he wanted for  
aclual fervice in the Mediterranean.  
Whatever annual fuiii beyond that you  
may think, proper to appropriate to na¬  
val prepaiations,&#x27;would perhaps be bet.  
ter employed in providing thole article!  
which may be kept without walte or  
confuiuption, and be in readinefs when  
any exigence calls them into ufe. Pio-  
grets has been made, as wilt appear by  
papers now communicated, in provid¬  
ing mites iais for Icventy-fuur gun (hips,  
as dire^cd by law.  
  
How far the authority given by thv  
Lcgiliatuie for procuring and elfablilhing  
litts tor naval purpulo, has been |^r-  
fc4fly iindeitiood and purlued in the  
execigtion, admits of fome doubt. \
