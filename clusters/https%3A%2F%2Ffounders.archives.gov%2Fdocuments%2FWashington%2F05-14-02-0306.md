Since the commencement of the term, for which I have been again called into office, no  
fit occasion has arisen for expressing to my fellow Citizens at large, the deep and  
respectful sense, which I feel, of the renewed testimony of public approbation. While on  
the one hand, it awakened my gratitude for all those instances of affectionate  
partiality, with which I have been honored by my Country; on the other, it could not  
prevent an earnest wish for that retirement, from which no private consideration should  
ever have torn me. But influenced by the belief, that my conduct would be estimated  
according to its real motives; and that the people, and the authorities derived from  
them, would support exertions, having nothing personal for their object, I have obeyed  
the suffrage which commanded me to resume the Executive power; and I humbly implore that  
Being, on whose Will the fate of Nations depends, to crown with  
success our mutual endeavours for the general happiness.  
As soon as the War in Europe had embraced those Powers, with whom the United States  
have the most extensive relations; there was reason to apprehend that our intercourse  
with them might be interrupted, and our disposition for peace, drawn into question, by  
the suspicions, too often entertained by belligerent Nations. It seemed therefore to be  
my duty, to admonish our Citizens of the consequences of a contraband trade, and of  
hostile Acts to any of the parties; and to obtain by a declaration of the existing legal  
state of things, an easier admission of our right to the immunities, belonging to our  
situation. Under these impressions the Proclamation, which will be laid before you, was  
issued.  
In this posture of affairs, both new &amp; delicate, I resolved to adopt general rules,  
which should conform to the Treaties, and assert the priviledges, of the United States.  
These were reduced into a system, which will be communicated to you. Although I have not thought myself at liberty to forbid the  
Sale of the prizes, permitted by our treaty of Commerce with France to be brought into  
our ports; I have not refused to cause them to be restored, when they were taken within  
the protection of our territory; or by vessels commissioned, or equipped in a warlike  
form within the limits of the United States.  
It rests with the wisdom of Congress to correct, improve or enforce this plan of  
proceedure; and it will probably be found expedient, to extend the legal code, and the  
Jurisdiction of the Courts of the United States, to many cases which, though dependent  
on principles, already recognized, demand some further provisions.  
Where individuals shall, within the United States, array themselves in hostility  
against any of the powers at war; or enter upon Military expeditions, or enterprizes  
within the jurisdiction of the United States; or usurp and exercise judicial authority  
within the United States; or where the penalties on violations of the law of Nations may  
have been indistinctly marked, or are inadequate; these offences cannot receive too  
early and close an attention, and require prompt and decisive remedies.  
Whatsoever those remedies may be, they will be well administered by  
the Judiciary, who possess a long established course of investigation, effectual  
process, and Officers in the habit of executing it.  
In like manner; as several of the Courts have doubted, under  
particular circumstances, their power to liberate the vessels of a Nation at peace, and  
even of a citizen of the United States, although siezed under a false colour of being  
hostile property; and have denied their power to liberate certain  
captures within the protection of our territory; it would seem proper to regulate their  
jurisdiction in these points. But if the Executive is  
to be the resort in either of the two last mentioned cases, it is hoped, that he will be  
authorized by law, to have facts ascertained by the Courts, when, for his own  
information, he shall request it.  
I cannot recommend to your notice measures for the fulfilment of our duties to the rest of the world, without again pressing upon you the  
necessity of placing ourselves in a condition of compleat defence, and of exacting from  
them the fulfilment of their duties  
towards us. The United States ought not to endulge a persuasion,  
that, contrary to the order of human events, they will for ever keep at a distance those  
painful appeals to arms, with which the history of every other nation abounds. There is  
a rank due to the United States among Nations, which will be withheld, if not absolutely  
lost, by the reputation of weakness. If we desire to avoid insult, we must be able to  
repel it; if we desire to secure peace, one of the most powerful instruments of our  
rising prosperity, it must be known, that we are at all times ready for War. The  
documents, which will be presented to you, will shew the amount, and kinds of Arms and  
Military stores now in our Magazines and Arsenals: and yet an addition even to these  
supplies cannot with prudence be neglected; as it would leave nothing to the uncertainty  
of procuring a warlike apparatus, in the moment of public danger.  
Nor can such arrangements, with such objects, be exposed to the censure or jealousy of  
the warmest friends of Republican Government. They are incabable of abuse in the hands  
of the Militia, who ought to possess a pride in being the depositary of the force of the  
Republic, and may be trained to a degree of energy, equal to every military exigency of  
the United States. But it is an inquiry, which cannot be too solemnly pursued, whether  
the act “more effectually to provide for the national defence by establishing an uniform Militia throughout the United States” has organized them so as  
to produce their full effect; whether your own experience in the several States has not  
detected some imperfections in the scheme; and whether a material feature in an  
improvement of it, ought not to be, to afford an opportunity for the study of those  
branches of the Military art, which can scarcely ever be attained by practice alone?  
The connexion of the United States with Europe, has become extremely interesting. The  
occurrences, which relate to it, and have passed under the knowledge of the Executive,  
will be exhibited to Congress in a subsequent communication.  
When we contemplate the war on our frontiers, it may be truly affirmed, that every  
reasonable effort has been made to adjust the causes of dissention with the Indians,  
North of the Ohio. The Instructions given to the Commissioners evince a moderation and  
equity, proceeding from a sincere love of peace, and a liberality, having no restriction  
but the essential interests and dignity of the United States. The attempt, however, of an amicable negotiation having been  
frustrated, the troops have marched to act offensively. Although the proposed treaty did  
not arrest the progress of Military preparation; it is doubtful, how far the advance of  
the Season, before good faith justified active movements, may retard them, during the  
remainder of the year. From the papers and intelligence, which relate to this important  
subject, you will determine, whether the deficiency in the number of Troops, granted by  
law, shall be compensated by succours of Militia; or additional encouragements shall be  
proposed to recruits.  
An anxiety has been also demonstrated by the Executive, for peace with the Creeks and  
the Cherokees. The former have been relieved with Corn and with clothing, and offensive  
measures against them prohibited during the recess of Congress. To satisfy the  
complaints of the latter, prosecutions have been instituted for the violences committed  
upon them. But the papers, which will be delivered to you, disclose the critical footing  
on which we stand in regard to both those tribes; and it is with Congress to pronounce,  
what shall be done.  
After they shall have provided for the present emergency, it will merit their most  
serious labours, to render tranquillity with the Savages permanent, by creating ties of  
interest. Next to a vigorous execution of justice on the violators of  
peace, the establishment of commerce with the Indian nations in behalf of the United  
States, is most likely to conciliate their attachment. But it ought to be conducted  
without fraud, without extortion, with constant and plentiful supplies; with a ready  
market for the commodities of the Indians, and a stated price for what they give in  
payment, and receive in exchange. Individuals will not pursue such a traffic, unless  
they be allured by the hope of profit; but it will be enough for the the United States  
to be reembursed only. Should this recommendation accord with the opinion of Congress,  
they will recollect, that it cannot be accomplished by any means yet in the hands of the  
Executive. Gentlemen of the House of Representatives  
The Commissioners, charged with the settlement of Accounts between the United and  
Individual States, concluded their important functions, within the time limited by Law;  
and the balances, struck in their report, which will be laid before Congress, have been  
placed on the Books of the Treasury.  
On the first day of June last, an instalment of one million of florins became payable  
on the loans of the United States in Holland. This was adjusted by a prolongation of the  
period of reimbursement, in nature of a new loan, at an interest of five per cent for  
the term of ten years; and the expences of this operation were a commission of three  
prCent.  
The first instalment of the loan of two millions of dollars from the Bank of the United  
States, has been paid, as was directed by Law. For the second it is necessary, that  
provision should be made.  
No pecuniary consideration is more urgent, than the regular redemption and discharge of  
the public debt: on none can delay be more injurious, or an œconomy of time more  
valuable.  
The productiveness of the public revenues hitherto, has continued to equal the  
anticipations which were formed of it; but it is not expected to prove commensurate with  
all the objects, which have been suggested. Some auxiliary provisions will, therefore,  
it is presumed, be requisite; and it is hoped that these may be made, consistently with  
a due regard to the convenience of our Citizens, who cannot but be sensible of the true  
wisdom of encountering a small present addition to their contributions, to obviate a  
future accumulation of burthens.  
  
But here, I cannot forbear to recommend a repeal of the tax on the transportation of  
public prints. There is no resource so firm for the Government of the United States, as  
the affections of the people guided by an enlightened policy; and to this primary good,  
nothing can conduce more, than a faithful representation of public proceedings,  
diffused, without restraint, throughout the United States.  
An estimate of the appropriations, necessary for the current service of the ensuing  
year, and a statement of a purchase of Arms and Military stores, made during the recess,  
will be presented to Congress. Gentlemen of the  
Senate, and of the House of Representatives.  
The several subjects, to which I have now referred, open a wide range to your  
deliberations; and involve some of the choicest interests of our common Country. Permit  
me to bring to your remembrance the magnitude of your task. Without an unprejudiced  
coolness, the welfare of the Government may be hazarded; without harmony, as far as  
consists with freedom of sentiment, its dignity may be lost. But, as the Legislative  
proceedings of the United States will never, I trust, be reproached for the want of  
temper or of candour; so shall not the public happiness languish, from the want of ⟨my  
strenuous and warmest co-operation.

drawn into queftion, by the fufpicions too often entertained by belligerent nations.  
It feemed, therefore, to be my duty to admonifh our citizens of the confequences  
of a contraband trade, and of hoftile adis to any of the parties; and to obtain,  
by a declaration of the exiffing legal fate of things, an eafier admiffien of our  
right to the immunities belonging to our fituation, Under thefe impreffions, the  
proclamation which will be laid before you was iffued.  
  
In this pofture of affairs, both new and delicate, I refolved to adopt general  
rules, which fuould conform to the treatics, and affert the privileges of the United  
States. Thefe were reduced into a [yftem, which will be communicated to yous  
Although I have not thought myfelf at liberty ta forbid the fale of the prizes,

have nt refufed to caufe.them to be reftored when they were taken within the  
protetion of our territory, or by veffels commiffioned or equipped in a warlike  
form within the limits of the United States. 3  
  
It vefes with the wifdom of Congrefs to corre, improve, or enforce this plas  
of procedure; and it will probably found expedient to extend the legal code,  
and the jurif{didtion of the courts of the United States, to many cafes which,  
though dependent on principles already recognimed, demand fome further pro-  
vifions. |  
  
Where individuals fhall, within the United States, array themfelves in hof-  
ility again? any of the powers at war, or enter upon military expeditions or  
enterprizes within the jurifdidtion of the United 8tates, or ufurp and exercife  
judicial authority within the United States ; or where the penalties on violations  
  
of the law of nations may have been indiftinétly marked, or are inadequate ;  
thefe offences cannot receive too early and clofe an attention, and require prompt  
and decifrve remedies.  
  
What/oever thofe remedies may be, they will be well adminifiered by the jus  
  
diciary, who poffe/s a lng eftablifhed courfe of inveftigation, effectual procefs,  
and officers in the habit of executing it. In like manner, as feveral of the courts  
Lave doubted, under particular circumftances, their power to liberate the veffels  
of a nation at peace, and even of a citizen of the United States, although  
Jeixed under a falfe colour of being hoftile property; and have denied their  
porver to liberate certain captures within the protection of our territory ; it would  
Seem proper to regulate their jurifdiftion in thefe points. But if the Executive  
is.to be the refort in either of the two laft mentioned cafes, it is hoped that he will  
be authorized by law to have fa&amp;s afcertained by the courts, when, for his own  
information, he frall requeft it.  
  
T cannot recommend to your notice meafures for the fulfilment of our duties to  
the ref? of the world, without again preffing upon you the neceffity of placing ours  
  
elves in a condition of complete defence, and of exaing from them the fulfil-  
ment of their duties towards us. The United States ought not to indulge a pere  
Juafion, that, contrary to the order of human events, they will for ever keep at @  
diftance thofe painful appeals to arms, with which the hiftory of every other nation  
abounds.— There is a rank due to the United States among nations, which will  
be withheld, if not abjolutely loft, by the reputation of weakne/s. lf we defire to  
avoid infult, we muft be able to repel it : if we defire to Jecure peace, one of the  
oft posverful infruments of our rifing profperity, it muft be known, that we are  
at all times ready for war.  
  
The documents which will be prefented to you will frew the amount and hinds  
of arms and military ftores now. in our magazines and arfenals; and yet an ad-  
dition even to thefe fupplies cannot with pridence be negleéted, as it would leave  
nothing to the uncertainty of procuring a warlike apparatus in the spree |  
public danger. Nor can fuch arrangements, with fuch objedls, be expofed to the  
cenfure or sealouly of the warmeft friends of republican government. They are  
incapable of abufe in the hands of the militia, who ought to poffifs a pride it  
being the depoftory of the force of the Republic, and may be trained to a degree  
  
of energy equal to every military exigency of the United States. But it ts an  
enquiry cbhich cannot be too Jolemnly purfued, whether the a ** more forneny

The conneétion of the United States with Europe has become éxtréntély intere/ts

ile Executive, will be exhibited to Congre/s in a fubjeqnent communication,  
  
’ When %e contemplate’ the wav on our frontiers, it may be truly affirmed, thas  
avery reafmable effort has beet made to adjuft thé canfes of dijfention with thé  
Indians north of the Ohio. The inftrudtions given to thé commiffioners evince &amp;  
moderation and equity proceeding from a fricere love of peace, and a liberality  
having no reftriGtion but the effential intercfts and dignity of the United States:  
The attest, Rotvever, of an amicable negiciation having been fruftrated, the  
broops have marehed to af offenfively. Although the propofed treaty did not ae  
the progrefs of military preparation, it is doubtful how far the advance of th  
feafin, beforé good faith juptified ative movements, may retard them during the  
remainder of the year. From the papers and intelligence which relate to this  
important frbjet?, you will determine wheNier the deficiency in the number of  
hoops granted by laz, frail be compenfated by fuccours of militia, or additional  
eacouragements fhall be propofed to recruits. An anxiety has been alfo demons  
  
Sfrrated by thé Executive, for peace with the Creeks and thé Cherokees. — The for-

of the latter, profecutions have been inffituted for the violences committed upon

After they flall have provided for the prefent emergency, it will merit their  
moft ferious labours to render tr anquillity with the favages permanent, by creating  
ties of intere/t.— Next to a rigorous execution of juftice om the violators of peace,  
the eftablifument of commerce with the Indian nations, in behalf of the United  
States, is moft likely to conciliate their attachment. But it ought to be condudted  
without fraud, without extortion, with conftant and plentiful /upplies, witha  
ready market for the commodities of the Indians, and a flated price for what  
they give in payment and receive in exchange. Individuals will not purfue fuch  
a traffic, unle/s they be allured by the hope-of profit; but it will be enough for the  
United Stites to be reimburfed only, Should this recommendation accord with  
the opinion of Congrefs, they will recollect, that it cannot be accomplifned by any

On the firff day of Fune laff, an inftalment&#x27; of one million of florins became

prolongation of the period of reimburfement, in nature of a mez loan, at an intercft  
of five per cent. for the term of ten years; and the expences of this operation were

_ No pecuniary confideration is. more urgent than. the regular redemptitn and

The produdtivene/s of the public revenues hitherto has continued to equal. the

an unprejudiced caolne/s the welfare of the government may be haxarded; with-  
out harmony, as far at confifts with freedom of fentiment, its dignity may be

SINCE the commencement of the term, for  
which I have been again called into office, no  
fit occasion has arisen for expressing to my fel­  
low citizens at large, the decp and refpeétful  
{enfe, which I feel, of the renewed telftimony  
of public approbation. While on the one  
hand, it awakened my gratitude for all those in­  
fiances of affeftionate partiality, with which I  
have been honoured by my country ; on the o­  
ther, it could not prevent an earnelt with for  
that retirement, from which no private conside­  
ration should ever have torn me. But influen­  
ced by the belief, that my condu&amp; would be  
eflimated according to its real motives ; and  
that the people, and the aut_horitles derived frpm  
them, would support exertions, having nothing  
personal for their objet, 1 have obeyed the  
fuffrage which commanded me to resume the  
Executive Power ; and I humbly imp/l.orc that  
Being, on whose will the fate of nations de­  
pends, to crown with fuccels our mutual en­  
deavours for the general happiness.  
As soon as the war in Europe had -embraced  
those powers with whom the United -Statcs have  
  
the mofl extensive relations ; there was no rea­  
son to apprehend that our intercourse with  
them might be interrupted, and our disposition  
for peace, drawn into question, by the suspi­  
cions, too often entertained by belligerent na­  
tions.—lt fecmed therefore to be my duty to  
admonish our Citizens of the consequences of a  
contraband trade, and of hofltile alts to any of  
the parties ; and to obtain, by a declaration of  
the exifling legal slate of things, an easier ad­  
miflion of our rights to the immuuities, belong­  
ing to our fitnation—Under thofc imprefficns,  
the proclamation, which will&#x27;be laid before you,  
was liflued.  
In this poster of affairs, both new and deli­  
cate. I resolved to adopt general rules, which  
should confirm to the treaties, and assert the  
privileges, of the United States. Thele were  
reduced into a {yftem, which will be communi­  
cated to you. Although I have not thought  
myfelf at liberty to forbid the sale of the pri­  
zes, permitted by our treaty of Commerce with  
France to be brought into our ports ; 1 have  
not refufed to cause them to be reflored, when  
they were taken within the protettion of our  
territory ; or by veflels commiflioned or equip­  
ped 1n a warlike form within the limits of the  
Unaited States.  
  
It reits with the wisdom of Congress to cor­  
rect, improve or enforce this plan of procedure,  
and 1t will probably be found expedient to ex­  
tend the legal code, and the Jurifdiion of the  
Courts of the United States to many cases which,  
though dependent on principles already recogni­  
zed, demand some further provisions.—  
Wohere individuals shall, within the United  
States, array themselves in hoflility againit any  
of the powers at war ; or enter upon military  
expeditions, or enterprizes within the junidic­  
tion of the United States ; or usurp and exercise  
judicial authonty within the United States ; or  
where the penalties on violations of the law of  
nations may have been indiftinttly marked, or  
are inadéquate ; these offences cannot receive  
too early and close an attention, and require  
prompt and decisive remedies.  
Whatsoever those remedies may be, they  
willLbe well administered by the Judiciary, who  
poliiilong citablifhed course of mvethgation,  
cife T 8 process, and officers in the habit of ex­  
ecuting it.—ln like manner, as several of the  
courts have doubted, under particular circum­  
it s, their power to liberate the veflels of a  
at peace, and even of a citizen of the U­  
‘niEPoates, although seized under a falfe colour  
of being hostile property ; and have denied  
their power to liberate certain captures within  
the protettion of our territory ; 1t would seem  
proper to regulate their juri{diétion 1n these  
points. Butif the Executiveis, tobe the re­  
sort 1n either of the two lalt mentioned cases, 1t  
is hoped, that he will be authorized by law, to  
have fafls, alcertained by the courts, when, for  
his own information, he shall requelt it.  
I cannot recommend to your notice measures  
for the fulfilment of our duties to the rest of the  
world, without again prefling upon you the ne­  
ceflity of placing ourselves in a condition of  
complete defence, and of exalling from them  
the fulfilment of t4eir duties towards us. The  
United States ought not to indulge a persuasion,  
that, contrary to the order of human events,  
they will forever keep at a distance those pain­  
ful appeals to arms with which the hiflory of  
every other nation abounds—There 1s a rank  
due to the United States among nations ; which  
will be withheld, if not abfoldtely loft, by the  
reputation of weakness. If we desire to avoid  
insult we must be able to repelit ; we desire to  
{ecure peace, one of the most powerful initru­  
ments of our rising prosperity, it must be known,  
that we are at all umes ready for war.  
The documents which will be prefeated to  
you, will shew the amount, and kinds of arms  
and military {ftorcs now in ‘our magazines and  
-arsenals : and yet an addition even to these sup­  
plies cannot with prudence be negletted ; as it  
would leave nothing to the uncertainty of pro­  
curing a warlike apparatus in the moment of  
public danger—Nor can such arrangements,  
with such objefls, be expoled to the eenfare or  
jealousy of the warmest friends of republican  
government. They are incapable of abuse in  
the hands of the malitia who ought to poflefs a  
pride in being the depository of the f%rce of  
the Republic, and may be trained to a degree of  
energy, equal to every military exigency of the  
United States. But 1t 1s an enquiry, which can­  
not be too solemnly pursued, whether the aét,  
““ more effe€tually to provide for the national  
dcfence, by establishing an unmiform militia  
throughout the United States,”” has organized  
them so as to produce their full effett ; whether  
your own experience in the several States has  
not detested some imperfeftions inthe scheme ;  
and whether a material feature in an Improve­  
ment of It, ought not to be to afford an oppor­  
tunity for the study of those branches of the  
military art, which can {carcely ever be attain­  
ed by praétice alone ?  
The connethion of the United States with  
Europe, has become extremely interesting—  
The occurrences, which relate to it, and have  
pafled under the knowledge of the Executive,  
  
. H E  
  
’will-‘bc exhibited to Congress in a fubléquent  
communication.  
o 4 w I}cn we contemplate the war on our fron­  
tiers, 1t may be truly affirmed, that every rea­  
fongble effort hassbeen made to adjuit the causes  
9{&#x27; difention with the Indians, north of the Ohio.  
Ihe linftruftions given to the commissioners  
- evin a moderation and equity, proceeding from  
a tinzere love of peace, and a liberality, having  
¢ r-liittion but the essential interefls and dig­  
&quot;¢ o the United States. The attempt, how­  
eve, ¥ 2 amiczble negociation Liaving. beeu  
frufirated, the troops have marched to aét offen­  
fively, Although the proposed treaty did not  
arreit the progre{s of military preparation, 1t is  
doubiful, how far the advance of ch {eafon be­  
fore good faith juftified aftive moments, may re­  
tard them, during the remainder of the year.  
From the papers and intelligence which relate  
to this imporant fubjett, you will determine,  
whether tﬁe deficiency in the number of troaps,  
granted by law, shall be compensated by {fuc­  
cours of militia ; or additional encouragements  
shall be proposed to recruits. An anxiety has  
been also demonstrated by the Executive, for  
peace with the Creeks and the Cherokees. The  
former have been relieved with corn and with  
clothing, and offenfive measures againit them  
prohibited, during the recess of Congress—To  
fatisfy the complaints of the latter, prosecutions  
have been inflituted for the violences commat­  
ted upon them.—But the papers, which will be  
delivered toyou, disclose the critical footing on  
which we fland 1n regard to both those tribes,  
and it is with Congress to pronounce what shall  
be done.  
  
After they shall have provided for the present  
emergency, it will merit their most serious la­  
bours, to render tranquility with the savages  
permanent, by creating ties of interelt.—Next  
to a rigorous execution of justice on the vicla­  
tors of peace, the establishment of commerce  
with the Indian nations in behalf of the United  
States, is most likely to conciliate their attach­  
ment, But it ought to be conduted without  
fraud, wichout extortion, with constant and plen­  
tiful supplies, with a ready market for the com­  
modites of the Indians, and a stated price forl  
what by give in payment, and reccive I ex­  
change—lndividuals will not pursue such a traf­  
fick, unless they be allured by the hope of pro­  
fit, but it will be enough for the Umted States %  
to be seimburfed only. Should this recommen­  
datien accord with the opinion of Congrels, they ?  
will recolle&amp;, that it cannot be accomplished by |  
any mecans yet in the hands of the Executive.  
Gertlemen of the House of Representatives,  
The Commffioners, charged with the fettle- |  
ment of accounts between the United and Indi­  
vidua! slates, concluded their important func­  
tions, within the time limited by law ; and the  
balances, struck in their report, which will be  
laid before Congress, have been placed on the  
Bogks of the Treasury.  
On the firft day of June last, an inftalment  
of one million of florins became payable on the  
loans of the United States in Holland, This  
was adjufled by a prolongation of the period of  
reimbursement, in nature of a new loan, at in­  
terest at five per cent. for the term of ten years ;  
and the expences of this operation were a com­  
miflion of three per cent. ’  
The firfl inftalment of the loan of two ml-,  
lions of dollars from the Bank of the United  
States, has been paid, as was direéted by law.  
For the second it is necessary, that provision  
should be made.  
No pecuniary consideration is more urgent,  
than the regular redemption and discharge of  
the public debt : on none can delay be more In­  
jurious or an ecoromy of time more valuable.  
The produétivenefs of the public revenues  
hitherto, has continued to equal the anticipa­  
tions which were formed of it ; but 1t 1s not  
expeficd to prove commensurate with all the  
objefts which have been suggested. Some aux­  
iliary provisions will, thcre%ore, it is presumed,  
be requisite ; and it is hoped that these may be  
made, consistently with a due regard to the con­  
venience of our éitizens, who cannot but be  
{enfible of the true wisdom of encountering a  
small present addition to their contribution, to  
obviaté a future accumulation of burthens.  
But here 1 cannot forbear to pecommend a  
repeal of the tax on the traanortation of the  
public prints. There is no resource {o firm for  
the Government of the United States, as the  
affe@tions of the People guided by an enlighten­  
¢d policy ; and to this primary good, nothing  
can produce more, thana faithful representa­  
tion of public proceedings, diffufed without re­  
{traint, t?nroughout the United States.  
An estimate of the ap ropriations, neceflary  
for the current service o¥ the ensuing year, and  
a statement of a purchase of arms and military  
stores, made during the recess, will be present­  
ed to Congrels.  
Gentlemen of the Senate, and of  
} the House of Reprefentatiuves,  
THE several fubjeéts, to which I have now  
‘referred, open a wide range to your delibera­  
}, tions ; and involve some of the choicest intereils  
kof our common country. Permit me to bring  
&#x27; to your remembrance the magnitude of your  
  
[VorumE xxxVvII.—NUME 1935.  
  
talk. Without an unprejudiced coolness the  
welfare of the government 1 ~ hazarded ;  
without harmony, as far as cc s with free­  
dom of {entiment, its dignity ma; loft. But  
as the legislative proceedings of the United  
States will never, I trust, be reproached for the  
want of temper or of candour ; so shall not the  
public happiness languish, fiom the want of my  
strenuous and warmest co-operations,

property; and have dened their power to  
liberate certam capiures within the pro-  
teStion of our territory; it would feem  
proper to regulate their jurifiétion in  
thete points. But if the executive is to be

cafes, it is hoped that he will be autho-  
rized by law, to have faéts afcertained by  
the courts, when, for his own mforma-  
tion, he thall requett it,  
  
¢ I cannot recommend to your notice  
meafures for the fulfilment of our duties  
to the reft of the world, without again  
prefling upon you the neceflity of placing  
ourfelves im a condition of complete de-  
fence, and of exacting from them the ful-  
filment of tlieir duties toward us. The  
United States ought not to indulge a per-  
fuafion, that, contrary to the ofder of  
human events, they will for ever keep at  
diftance thofe painful appeals to arms,  
with wh&#x27;ch the hiftory of every other na-  
tion abounds. There is arank due to  
the United States among nations, which  
will be withheld, if not abfolutely loft, by  
the reputation of weaknefs. If we defire  
to avoid infult, we muft be able to repel  
it ; if we defire to fecure peace, one of the  
moft powerful inftruments of our rifing  
profperity, it mult be known that we are  
at all times ready for war. The documents  
which will be prefented to you will fiw  
the amount, and kinds of arms and mi&#x27;i-  
tary ftores now in our magazines and  
arfenals ; and yet an addition even to  
thele fupplies cannot with prudence be  
neglected, as it would leave nothing to  
the uncertainty of procuring a warlike ap-  
paratus in the moment of public danger.  
  
* Nor can fuch arrangements, with  
fuch objeéts, be expofed to the cenfure or  
jealoufy of the warmett friends of :epubli-  
can government. They are incapable of  
abufe in the hands of the miiitia, who  
obdght to poffefs a pride in being the depo-  
fitory of the force of the republic, and  
may be trained to a degree of energy equal  
to every military exigency of the United  
States. But it is an enquiry which can-  
not be too folemnly puriue |, whether the  
att,-“* more effe€tually to provide for the  
national defence, by eftablifhing an uni-  
form militia throughout the United States,”  
has organized thein fo as to produce their  
full effect; whether your own experience  
in the feveral States has not deteCted fome  
unperfeétions in the {cheme ; and whether

oug&#x27;t not &#x27;o be, to afford an opportunity  
for the ttudy of thofe branches of the mi-  
litary art which can fearcely ever be ob-  
tained by praétice alone.  
  
* The conneétion of the Unired States  
with Europe has become extremely inte-  
refting. ‘The occurrences which relate to  
it, and have paffed under the knowledge  
of the executive, wiil be exhibited te  
congress i a fubfequent communicstion,  
  
* When we cont mplate the war on our  
frontiers, it may be trvly affirmed, that  
every reafonable effort has been made to  
adjutt the caufes of diffenfion with the  
Indians north of the Ohiv. The inftruc-  
tions given to the commiffioners evince a  
moderation and equity, proceeding from  
a fincere love of peace; and a liberality  
having no reflriétion but the effential in-  
tereft gnd dignity of the United States.  
The attempt, however, of an amicable  
negociation having been frutrated, «tie  
troops have marched to act offeniively.  
Although the propofed treaty did not arrett  
the progrefs of military preparation, it is  
doub:ful how far the advance of the ‘ea-  
fon, before good faith juftified aétive  
movements, may retard them during the  
remainder of the year. From the papers  
  
and intelligence which relate to this im-  
  
portant fubjeéty you will determine whe-  
ther the deficiency in the number of trcops  
granted by law fhall be compenfated by  
fuccours of :ailitia, or additional encou-  
ragements fhal] be propoféd to recruits.  
  
* Ananxiety has been aifo demonttrated  
by the executive for peace with the Cieeks  
and Cherokees. The former have been  
relieved with corn and with clothing, and  
offenfive meafures again them prohibited  
during the recefs of Congrefs. To fatisfy  
the complaints of the latter, profecutions  
have been inftituied for the violences com-  
mitted upon them. But the papers wh ch  
will be delivered to you, difclofe the criti-  
cal footing on wh ch we ftand-in regard to  
both thofe tribes; «ni itis with congreis  
to proncunce what fhali be done.  
  
* After they thall. have provided for the  
prefent emergency, ic will merit their moft  
ferious labonrs to render tranquillity with  
the favages permanent, by creating ties of  
interelt Next to a vigorous execution of  
juitice on the violators of peace, the efta-  
  
blifhment of commerce with the Indian‘

* Gentlemen of the Houfe of Reprefen-  
  
tatives.  
  
© The commiffioners charged with the  
fettlement of the accounts between the  
United and Incivduel states, concluded  
their important functions within the time  
limited by law; and the balances ftruck  
in their report, which will be laid before  
ccongrefs, have been placed on the books  
of the treafury.  
  
On the:zit day of June laft, an inftal-  
ment of one million of florins became  
payable on the loans of the United States  
in Holland. This was 2djufted by a pro-  
longation of the period of re mburfe-  
ment, in nature of a new loan, at an in-  
tereft of 5 per cent. for the term of ten  
‘years ; and the expences of this operation  
were acomm‘ffion of 3 per cent.  
  
¢ The ficit initalment of the loan of  
‘two millions of dollars from the bank of  
the United States has been paid, as was  
direGted by law. For the fecond itis ne-  
ceflary that provifion fhould be made,  
  
‘ No pecuniary confide ation-is more  
urgent, than the redemption and difcharge  
ot the public debt; on none can delay be  
more injurious, or an economy of time  
mere valuable.  
  
The produét&#x27;venefs of the public reve-  
nues hitherto has continued to equal the  
anticipations which wee formed of it;  
‘but it is not expected to prove commen-  
furate with all the objects which have been  
fuggetled. Some auxiltary provifions will,  
therefore, it is prefumed, be requifite ; and  
it is hoped that thele may be made confit-  
tently wish due regard to the conven&#x27;ence  
of our cit gen , wiv cannot but be feahble  
of the true wifdom of encounter.ng a iniall  
prelent addition to their contributions, to  
obviate a future accumulation of burdens.  
  
* But here J cannot forbear to recom-  
mend a repeal of the tax on the tranfpor-  
tation of the pubhke pins. ‘There is no  
refource fo fim for the government of the  
‘United States, as the affeftions cf the  
ypeople guided by an enlightened policy ;  
‘and to this primary good nothing can con-  
  
of public proceedings, diffuled, without  
reitrainty throughout the United States.  
  
* An eftimaie of the appropriations ne-  
ceffary tor the current fervice of the en-  
fuing year, and a flatement of a purchate  
of arms and miliary ftores, made during  
the recefs, will be prefented to congrefs.  
  
© Gentlemen of the Senate, and of the  
Houle of Repretentatives,  
  
* The feveral fubje&amp;s to which I have  
now referred, open a wide range to your  
deliberation, and involve fome of the  
choiceft interefts of our common country.  
Permit me to bring to your remembrance  
the magnitude of your tafk. Without an  
unprejudiced coolnefs, the welfare of the  
government may ‘be hazarded ; “without  
harmony, as far as confiits in freedom of  
fentiment, its dignity may be loft. —But  
as the legiflative proceedings of the United  
States will never, I truft, be reproached  
for the want of temper or candour, fo  
fhail net the public happinefs languith,  
from the want of my firenuous and warm-  
eit co-operation.

ful inftruments of our rifing profperity, it muit be known, that  
we are at all times ready for war.’  
  
After thefe obfervations, dictated by political prudence, he  
proves, that the meafures now recommended cannot experience  
the cenfure or jcaloufy of the warmett friends of republican go-  
vernment, as their defence will not be committed to a native  
ftanding army, or foreign mercenaries, ‘ but to a militia, who  
ought to poflefs a pride in being the depofitary of the force of the  
republic, and may be trained to a degree of energy equal to every

&quot; defence and of exa&amp;ing from them, the

« AS Soon as the war in Europe had  
embraced those powers with whon the  
United States have the most extenfiverela­  
tions, there was reason to apprehend that  
an extensive intercourse with them might  
be interrupted, and our disposition for peace  
drawn into question, by the suspicions too  
often entertained by belligerent nations.  
It seemed therefore to be iny duty, to ad­  
monish dar citizens of the consequence of  
a contraband trade, and hoflile afls to any  
of the parties ; and to obtain, by a decla­  
ration of the exifling legal slate of things,  
an ‘eafier admission of our right to the im­  
munities belonging to our situation. Under  
these impreflions the proclamation, which  
will be laid before you, was issued.  
In this poftare of affairs both néw and  
delicate, I resolved to adopt general rules,  
which should conform to the treatiés, and  
aflert the privileges of the United States.  
&#x27;hefe were reduced into a system, which  
will be cammunicated to you. Although  
I have not thought myfelf at liberty to for­  
bid the sale of the prizes, ;ermittc‘d by  
our treaty of commerce with France to be  
bro’t into our ports, I have not refufed to  
cause them to be reflored when they were  
taken within the proteftion of our territo­  
ry, or by veflels commissioned or equipped  
in a warlike form within the limits of the  
United States. ‘ 1  
It rests with the wisdom of Congress to  
correft, improve, or inforce this plan of  
protettion j and it will probably be found  
expedient to cxtend ihe legal code, and |  
the jurifdi€tion of the&#x27;Courts of the United  
States, to many cases, which, tho’ depen­  
dent on principles already recognized, de­  
mand forae further provisions. = ,  
Where individuals thall withinthe United

any of the powers at war, or enter upon

usurp and exercise judicial authority with­  
in the United States, or where the penal­  
ties on violations of the law of nations  
may have beea diftin&amp;tly marked, or are  
inadequate, these offences cannot receive  
too carly and close an.auention, and re-.  
quire prompt and decisive remedies.

upon them * the necessity of placing us in

ine from other nations the fulilment of

could not avoid the slanders of the press, when he  
issued his proclamation.  
We give below the extracts from Washington  
and Jefferson:  
&quot;As soon as the war in Europe had embraced those pow­  
ers with whom the United States have the most extensive re­  
ations, there was reason to apprehend that our intercourse  
with them might be interrupted, and our disposition for peace  
lrawn into question, by the suspicions too often entertained  
by belligerent nations. It seemed, therefore, to be my duty  
o admonish our citizens of the consequences of a contraband  
rade, and of hostile acts to any of the parties and to ob-  
ain, by a declaration of the existing legal state of things,  
an easier admission of our right to the immunities belonging  
o our situation. Under these impressions, the proclamration  
which I laid be fore you, was issued.  
&quot;In this posture of affairs, both new and delicate, I re­  
olved to adopt general rules, which should conform to the  
reaties, and assert the privileges, of the United States.  
These were reduced into a system, which will be commun­  
ated to you. Although I have not felt myself at liberty to  
orbid the sale of these prizes, permitted by our treaty of  
ommerce with France to be brought into our ports, I have  
ot refused to cause them to be restored, when they were ta­  
ten within the protection of our territory, or by vessels com­  
nissioned and equipped in a warlike form, within the limits  
of the United States.  
&quot;It rests with the wisdom of Congress to correct, improve,  
renforce, this plan of procedure; and it will prohably be­  
ound expedient to extend the legal code, and the jurisdic  
ion of the courts of the United States to many cases which,  
hough dependent on principles already recognized, demand  
ome further provisions  
When individuals shall, within the United States, array  
themselves in hostility against any of the powers at  
nter upon military expeditions or enterprises, within the  
United States; or usurp and exercise judicial anthority with­

| fa the day when George Washington was President of the United  
States, he said, in his address to Congress, at“the opening ses-  
sion of 1793:

our duties to the rest of the world without again pressing upon you the ne-  
cessity of placing ourselves in a condition of complete defense, and of ex-  
acting from them the fulfilment of their duties towards us. The United  
States ought not to indulge a persuasion that, contrary to the order of hu-

arms with which the history of every nation abounds. There is a rank due  
to the United States among nations, which will be withheld, if not absolu-

must be able to repel it; if we desire to secure peace—one of the most pow-

merce with the Indian nations, on be-  
half of the United States is most  
likely to conciliate their attachment.  
But it ought to be conducted without  
fraud, without extortion, with con-  
stant and plentiful supplies; with a  
ready market for the commodities of  
the Indians, and a stated price for  
what they give in payment and re-

not pursue such a traffic unless they

The commerce of a weak nation suffers from  
every rumor of war; the only remedy is to se  
peace, and to secure it other nations must be made  
to know and feel that it will cost them more than  
they can afford to go to war with us; that they will  
gain no glory, territory or money, but that, on the  
contrary, they will probably be the losers. The  
ons one hundred years ago were such that  
Waghington said: &quot;There is a rank due the United

San Diego Tribune: The anti-ex­

Washington on the desirability of this  
nation minding its own business. They  
try to spread the idea that Washing­  
ton was a peace-at-any-price man. Let  
them read and ponder over the follow­  
ing statement by Washington: &quot;The  
United States ought not to indulge a  
persuasion, that, contrary to the order  
of human events, they will forever  
keep at a distance those painful ap­  
peals to arms with which the history
