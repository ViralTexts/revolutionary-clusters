Convention between His most Christian Majesty and the United States of America, for the purpose of defining and establishing the functions and privileges of their respective Consuls and vice-Consuls.  
His Majesty the most Christian King and the United States of  America having by the 29th article of the Treaty of amity and commerce concluded between them, mutually granted the liberty of having, in their respective States and Ports, Consuls, vice-Consuls, Agents and Commissaries, and being willing in consequence thereof to define and establish in a reciprocal and permanent manner the functions and privileges of Consuls and vice-Consuls, which they have judged it convenient to establish of preference. His M. C. Majesty has nominated the Sieur Count of Montmorin of St. Herent, Marechal of his Camps and Armies, Knight of his Orders and of the Golden Fleece, his Counsellor in all his Councils, Minister and Secretary of State and of his Commandments and Finances, having the Department of foreign affairs, and the United States have nominated the Sieur Thomas Jefferson, Citizen of the United States of America and their Minister Plenipotentiary near the King, who after having communicated to each other their respective full powers, have agreed on what follows:  
Art. I. The Consuls and vice-Consuls named by the M. C. K. and the U. S. shall be bound to present their commissions according to the forms which shall be established respectively by the M. C. K. within his dominions, and by the Congress within the U. S. There shall be delivered to them, without any charges, the Exequatur necessary for the exercise of their functions; and on exhibiting the said Exequatur, the Governors, Commanders, Heads of justice, bodies corporate, Tribunals and other Officers having authority in the ports and places of their consulates, shall cause them to enjoy immediately, and without difficulty, the preeminencies, authority and privileges, reciprocally granted, without exacting from the said Consuls and vice-Consuls any fee, under any pretext whatever.  
Art. II. The Consuls and vice-Consuls and persons attached to their functions that is to say, their Chancellors and Secretaries, shall enjoy a full and entire immunity for their Chancery and the papers which shall be therein contained: they shall be exempt from all personal service, from soldiers billets, militia, watch, guard, guardianship, trustee-ship, as well as from all duties, taxes, impositions, and charges whatsoever, except on the estate real and personal of which they may be the proprietors or possessors, which shall be subject to the taxes imposed on the estates of all other individuals: and in all other instances they shall be subject to the laws of the land as the natives are.  
Those of the said Consuls and vice-Consuls who shall exercise commerce shall be respectively subject to all taxes, charges and impositions established on other merchants.  
  
They shall place over the outward door of their house the arms of their Sovereign: but this mark of indication shall not give to the said house any privilege of asylum for any person or property whatsoever.  
ART. III. The respective Consuls and vice-Consuls may establish Agents in the different ports and places of their departments where necessity shall require. These Agents may be chosen among the merchants either national or foreign, and furnished with a commission from one of the said Consuls: they shall confine themselves respectively to the rendering to their respective merchants, navigators, and vessels all possible service, and to inform the nearest Consul of the wants of the said merchants, navigators and vessels, without the said Agents otherwise participating in the immunities, rights and privileges attributed to Consuls and vice-Consuls, and without power under any pretext whatever to exact from the said merchants any duty or emolument whatsoever.  
ART. IV. The Consuls and vice-Consuls respectively may establish a chancery, where shall be deposited the Consular determinations, acts and proceedings as also testaments, obligations, contracts, and other acts done by, or between persons of their nation, and effects left by deceased persons or saved from shipwreck.  
They may consequently appoint fit persons to act in the said chancery, receive and swear them in, commit to them the custody of the seal, and authority to seal commissions, sentences and other consular acts, and also to discharge the functions of notary and register of the Consulate.  
ART. V. The Consuls and vice-Consuls respectively shall have the exclusive right of receiving in their chancery, or on board of vessels, the declarations and all other the acts, which the captains, masters, crews, passengers, and merchants of their nation may chuse to make there, even their testaments and other disposals by last will: and the copies of the said acts, duly authenticated by the said Consuls or vice-Consuls, under the seal of their consulate shall receive faith in law, equally as their originals would, in all the tribunals of the dominions of the M. C. King and of the United States.  
They shall also have, and exclusively, in case of the absence of the testamentary executor, administrator or legal heir, the right to inventory, liquidate and proceed to the sale of the personal estate left by subjects or citizens of their nation, who shall die within the extent of their consulate: they shall proceed therein with the assistance of two merchants of their said nation, or, for want of them,  of any other at their choice, and shall cause to be deposited in their chancery, the effects and papers of the said estates; and no officer military, judiciary, or of the police of the country shall disturb them or interfere therein, in any manner whatsoever: but the said Consuls and vice-Consuls shall not deliver up the said effects, nor the proceeds thereof to the lawful heirs or to their order, till they shall have caused to be paid all debts which the deceased shall have contracted in the country; for which purpose the creditor shall have a right to attach the said effects in their hands as they might in those of any other individual whatever, and proceed to obtain sale of them till payment of what shall be lawfully due to them. When the debts shall not have been contracted by judgment, deed or note, the signature whereof shall be known, payment shall not be ordered but on the creditor’s giving sufficient surety resident in the country, to refund the sums he shall have unduly received, principal, interest and costs: which surety nevertheless shall stand duly discharged after the term of one year in time of peace, and of two in time of war, if the demand in discharge cannot be formed before the end of this term against the heirs who shall present themselves.  
And in order that the heirs may not be unjustly kept out of the effects of the deceased the Consuls and vice-Consuls shall notify his death in some one of the gazettes published within their consulate, and that they shall retain the said effects in their hands four months to answer all just demands which shall be presented: and they shall be bound after this delay to deliver to the persons succeeding thereto what shall be more than sufficient for the demands which shall have been formed.  
ART. VI. The Consuls and vice-Consuls respectively shall receive the declarations, protests and reports of all captains and masters of their respective nation on account of average losses sustained at sea: and these captains and masters shall lodge in the chancery of the said Consuls and vice-Consuls, the acts which they may have made in other ports on account of the accidents which may have happened to them on their voyage. If a subject of the M. C. K. and a citizen of the U. S. or a foreigner are interested in the said cargo, the average shall be settled by the tribunals of the country and not by the Consuls or vice-Consuls; but when only the subjects or citizens of their own nation shall be interested, the respective Consuls or vice-Consuls shall appoint skilful persons to settle the damages and average.  
ART. VII. In cases where by tempest, or other accident, French ships or vessels shall be stranded on the coasts of the U. S. and  ships or vessels of the U. S. shall be stranded on the coasts of the dominions of the M. C. K. the Consul or vice-Consul nearest to the place of shipwreck shall do whatever he may judge proper, as well for the purpose of saving the said ship or vessel, its cargo and appurtenances, as for the storing and the security of the effects and merchandise saved. He may take an inventory of them, without the intermedling of any officers of the military, of the customs, of justice, or of the police of the country, otherwise than to give to the Consuls, vice-Consuls, captain and crew of the vessel shipwrecked or stranded all the succour and favour which they shall ask of them, either for the expedition and security of the saving and of the effects saved, as to prevent all disturbance.  
And in order to prevent all kind of dispute and discussion in the said cases of shipwreck, it is agreed that when there shall be no Consul or vice-Consul to attend to the saving of the wreck, or that the residence of the said Consul or vice-Consul (he not being at the place of the wreck) shall be more distant from the said place than that of the competent Judge of the Country, the latter shall immediately proceed therein, with all the dispatch, certainty and precautions prescribed by the respective laws; but the said territorial Judge shall retire, on the arrival of the Consul or vice-Consul, and shall deliver over to him the report of his proceedings, the expences of which the Consul or vice-Consul shall cause to be reimbursed to him, as well as those of saving the wreck.  
The merchandise and effects saved shall be deposited in the nearest custom house, or other place of safety, with the inventory thereof which shall have been made by the Consul or vice Consul, or by the Judge who shall have proceeded in their absence, that the said effects and merchandise may be afterwards delivered, (after levying therefrom the costs) and without form of process, to the owners, who being furnished with an order for their delivery from the nearest Consul or vice-Consul, shall reclaim them by themselves, or by their order, either for the purpose of reexporting such merchandise, in which case they shall pay no kind of duty of exportation, or for that of selling them in the Country, if they be not prohibited there, and in this last case, the said merchandise, if they be damaged, shall be allowed an abatement of entrance duties proportioned to the damage they have sustained, which shall be ascertained by the affidavits taken at the time the vessel was wrecked or struck.  
ART. VIII. The Consuls or vice-Consuls shall exercise Police over all the vessels of their respective Nations and shall have on board the said vessels all power and Jurisdiction in Civil Matters,  in all the disputes which may there arise. They shall have an entire inspection over the said vessels, their crew and the changes and substitutions there to be made. For which purpose they may go on hoard the said vessels whenever they may judge it necessary. Well understood that the functions hereby allowed shall be confined to the interior of the vessels, and that they shall not take place in any case which shall have any interference with the Police of the ports where the said vessels shall be.  
ART. IX. The Consuls and vice-Consuls may cause to be arrested the Captains, Officers, Mariners, Sailors, and all other persons being part of the crews of the vessels of their respective Nation who shall have deserted from the said vessels in order to send them back and transport them out of the Country. For which purpose the said Consuls and vice-Consuls shall address themselves to the courts, Judges and Officers competent, and shall demand the said deserters in writing, proving by an exhibition of the registers of the vessel or ship’s roll that those men were part of the said crews: and on this demand so proved (saving however where the contrary is proved) the delivery shall not be refused; and there shall be given all aid and assistance to the said Consuls and vice-Consuls for the search, seizure and arrest of the said deserters, who shall even be detained and kept in the prisons of the Country, at their request and expence until they shall have found an opportunity of sending them back. But if they be not sent back within three months, to be counted from the day of their arrest they shall be set at liberty, and shall be no more arrested for the same cause.  
ART. X. In cases where the respective subjects or citizens shall have committed any crime, or breach of the peace, they shall be amenable to the Judges of the Country.  
ART. XI. When the said offenders shall be a part of the crew of a vessel of their Nation, and shall have withdrawn themselves on board the said vessel they may be there seized and arrested by order of the Judges of the Country: these shall give notice thereof to the Consul or vice-Consul, who may repair on board if he thinks proper: but this notification shall not in any case delay execution of the order in question. The persons arrested shall not afterwards be set at liberty until the Consul or vice-Consul shall have been notified thereof; and they shall be delivered to him, if he requires it, to be put again on board of the vessel on which they were arrested, or of others of their Nation, and to be sent out of the Country.  
ART. XII. All differences and suits between the subjects of the M. C. K. in the U. S. or between the citizens of the United states within the dominions of the M. C. K. and particularly all disputes  relative to the wages and terms of engagement of the crews of the respective vessels, and all differences of whatever nature they be, which may arise between the privates of the said crews, or between any of them and their captains, or between the captains of different vessels of their nation, shall be determined by the respective Consuls and vice-Consuls, either by a reference to arbitrators, or by a summary judgment and without costs.  
No Officer of the country, civil or military, shall interfere therein or take any part whatever in the matter: and the appeals from the said consular sentences shall be carried before the tribunals of France or of the U. S. to whom it may appertain to take cognizance thereof.  
ART. XIII. The general utility of commerce having caused to be established within the dominions of the M. C. K. particular tribunals and forms for expediting the decision of commercial affairs, the merchants of the U. S. shall enjoy the benefit of these establishments; and the Congress of the U. S. will provide in the manner the most conformable to its laws for the establishment of equivalent advantages in favour of the French merchants, for the prompt dispatch and decision of affairs of the same nature.  
ART. XIV. The subjects of the M. C. K. and citizens of the U. S. who shall prove by legal evidence that they are of the said nations respectively shall in consequence enjoy an exemption from all personal service in the place of their settlement.  
ART. XV. If any other nation acquires by virtue of any convention whatever, a treatment more favourable with respect to the consular preeminencies, powers, authority and privileges, the Consuls and vice-Consuls of the M. C. K. or of the U. S. reciprocally shall participate therein, agreeable to the terms stipulated by the 2d. 3d. and 4th. articles of the treaty of amity and commerce, concluded between the M. C. K. and the U. S.  
ART. XVI. The present Convention shall be in full force during the term of twelve years to be counted from the day of the exchange of ratifications, which shall be given in proper form, and exchanged on both sides within the space of one year, or sooner if possible.  
In faith whereof we Ministers Plenipotentiary have signed the present Convention, and have thereto set the seal of our arms.  
Done at Versailles the 14th. of November one thousand seven hundred and eighty eight.

polleffors, which fhall be fubject to the taxes.impofed on the eftates of all other indi-  
viduals: and in all other inftances, they fhall be fubje&amp; to the laws of the land, as the na-  
tives are. Thofe of the faid confuls and vice-confuls, who fhall exercife commerce,  
fhall be refpectively fubjeét to all taxes, charges, and impofitions, eftablithed on  
other merchants. They thall place over the outward door of their houfe, the arms  
of their fovereign : but this mark of indication fhall not give to the faid houfe  
any privilege of afylum for any perfon or property whatfoever.  
  
MII. The refpeétive confuls and vice-confuls may eftablith agents in the differ-  
ent ports and places of their departments, where neceffity fhall require. Thefe  
*gents may be chofen among the merchants, either national or foreign, and furnifh-  
ed with a commiffion from one of the faid confuls. They fhall confine themfelves  
1efpectively to the rendering to their refpe€tive merchants, navigators, and veffels,  
all poflible fervice, and to inform the neareft conful of the wants of the faid mer-  
chants, navigators, and veflels—without the faid agents otherwife participating in  
the immunities, 1ights, and privileges attributed to confuls and vice-confuls—and  
without power, under any pretext whetever, to exat from the faid merchants any  
duty or emolument whatfoever.  
  
IV. The confuls and vice-confuls refpeétively may eftablifh a chancery, where  
fhall be depofited the confular determinations, acts, and proceedings, as alfo tefta-  
ments, obligations, contraéts, and ether aéts, done by or between perfons of  
their nation, and effeéts left by deceafed perfons, or faved from fhipwreck. They  
may confequently appoint fit perfons to act in the faid chancery ; receive and {wear  
them in ; commit to them the cuftody of the feal, and authority to feal commiffions,  
ientences, and other confular aéts—and alfo to difcharge the functions of notary  
and regifter of the confulate.  
  
V. The confuls and vice-confuls refpeétively fhall have the exclufive right of  
receiving in their chancery, or on board of veflels, the declarations and all other  
acts, which the captains, mafters, crews, paflengers, and merchants of their na-  
tion may choofe to make there, even their teftaments and other difpofals by laft  
will; and the copies of the faid aéts, duly authenticated by the faid confuls or vice-  
conijuls, under the feal of the confulate, thall receive faith in law, equally as their  
originals would, in all the tribunals of the dominions of the M. C. K. and of the  
united ftates. They fhall alfo have, and exclufively, in cafe of the abfence of the tef-  
tamentary executor, adminiftrator, or legal heir, the right to inventory, liquidate,  
and proceed to the {ale of the perfonal eftate left by fubieéts or citizens of their na-  
uion, who fhall die withia the extent of their confulate; they fhall proceed therein  
wiih the afliftance of two merchants of their nation, or, for want of them, of any  
other attheir choce ; and fhall caufe to be depofited in their chancery, the effects and  
papers of the faid eftates : and no officer, military, judiciary, or of the police of the  
country, fhall difturb them or interfere therein, in any manner whatloever: but  
the faid confuls and vice-confuis fhall not deliver up the faid effects, nor the pro-  
ceeds thereof, to the lawful heirs, or to their ordertil] they fhall have caufed to be paid  
ali debts which the deceafed ihall have contracted in the country ; for which pur-  
pote the creditors fhall have a mght to attach the faid effeéts in their hands, as  
they might in thofe of any other individual whatever, and proceed to obtain fale  
of them till payment of what fhall be lawfully due to them. When the debts fhall  
not have been contra¢ted by judgment, deed, or note, the fignature wheread thal  
be known, payment thall not be ordered but on the creditor’s giving futhcient  
iuvety, retident in the country, to refund the fums he fhall have unduly received, prin-  
cipal, incereii and cofts: which furety neverthelefs fhall ftand duly ditcharged after the  
termof one year in time of peace, and of two in time of war, if the demand in  
cucharge cannot be formed before the end of this term, againtt the heirs who fhail  
  
prelent themiclves. And in order that the heirs may not unjuftly be kept out of  
the effects of the deceafed, the confuls and vice-confuls fhall notify his death in-

fome one of the gazettes publithed within their confulate ; and that they fhall re-  
tain the faid effects in their hands, feven months, to anfwer all demands which  
fhall be prefented: and they fhall be bound after this delay to deliver to the  
perfons fucceeding thereto, what fhall be more than fufficient for the demands  
which fhall have been formed.  
  
VI. The confuls and vice confuls refpeétively fhall reezive the declarations, pro-  
tefts, and reports of all captaims and matters of their refpeétive nations, on account  
of average loffes fuftained at fea ; and thefe captains and mafters hall lodge in  
the chancery of the faid confuls and vice-confuls, the aéts which they may have  
made in other ports on account of the accidents which may have happened to  
them on their voyage. If a fubject of the M. C. K. and acitizen of the U.  
S. or a foreigner, are interefted in the faid cargo, the average fhall be fettled by the  
tribunals of the country, and not by the con{uls or vice-confuls ; but when only  
the fubjeéts or citizens of their own nation fhall be interefted, the refpective confuls  
or vice-confuls fhall appoint tkilful perfons to fettle the damages and average.  
  
VII. In cafes where by tempeft, or other accident, French fhips or vefleis fhall  
be ftranded on the coafts of the U. $.—and thips or veffels of the U. S. thall be  
ftranded on the coafts of the dominions of the M. C. K.—the conful or vice-con-  
ful, neareft to the place of thipwreck, fhall do whatever he may judge proper, as  
well for the purpote of faving the faid fhip or veflel, its cargo and appurtenances,  
as for the ftoring and fecurity of the effects and merchandife faved. He may take  
an inventory of them, without the intermedling of any officers of the military, of  
the cuftoms, of juftice, or of the police of the country, otherwife than to give to the  
confuls, vice-confuls, captain, and crew of the veflel, fhrpwrecked or ftranded, all  
the fuccour and favour which they fhall afk of them, either for the expedition and  
fecurity of the faving and of the effects faved, as to prevent all difturbance. And  
in order to prevent all kinds of difpute and difcuffion, in the faid cafes of thip-  
wreck, itis agreed, that when there thall be no conful or vice-coniul to attend to the  
faving of the wreck, or that the refidence of the faid conful or vice-conful (he not  
being at the place of the wreck) fhali be more diftant from the faid place, than  
that of the competent judge of the country, the latter fhall immediately proceed  
therein with all the difpatch, certainty, and precautions, prefcribed by the re{pec-  
tive laws : but the faid territorial judge thall retire, on the arrival of the conful or  
vice-confu!, and fhall deliver over to him the report of his proceedings, the ex-  
penfes of which the conful or vice-coniul fhall caufe to be reimburfed to him, as  
well as thofe of faving the wreck. The merchandife and effects faved fhall be depotited  
in the neareft cuftom houfe, or other place of tafety, with the inventory thereof, which  
fhall have been made by the conful,or confuls,or by the judge,who fhall have procee ied  
in their abfence, that the faid effeéts and merchandife may be afterwards delivered,  
(after levying therefrom the coft-) and without form of procefs, to the owners,  
who, being furnifhed with an order for their delivery from the neareft conful or  
vice-conful, fhall reclaim them by themiclves, or by their order, either for the  
purpole of re-exporting fuch merchan.ditc, in which cafe they thal pay no kind of  
duties of exportation—or for thatof felling them in the country, if they be not pro-  
hibited there ; and in this laft cafe, the {aid merchandile, if they be damaged, thail  
be allowed an abatement of entrance duties, proportioned to the damage they have  
fuftained, which fhall be afcertained by the affidavits taken at the time the veil]  
was wrecked or fttruck.  
  
VIil. The confuls or vice-confuls fhall ekercife police over all the veffels of  
their refpective nations—and fhali have, on board the {aid veffels, all power and  
surifdiétion in civil matters: in all the difputes which may there arife, they fhall  
have an entire infpection over the faid veffels, their crew, and the chances and  
fubititutions there to be made: for which purpofe they may go on board the faid

confuls and vice-conivwis {hall addrefs themfelves to the courts, judges, ahd offi-  
cers competent ; and fhall demand the faid deferters in writing, proving by anex.  
hibition of the regtfters of the veflel or fhip’s roll, that thoie men were part of the  
faid crews : and on this demand fo proved (faving, however, where the contrary  
is proved) the delivery thall not be refuded : and there dhall be given all aid and  
afliftance to the {aid confuls and vice-confuls, for the fearch, {eizure, and arreft of  
the faid deferters, who hall even be detained and kept in the prifons of the coua-

X. In cafes where the refpe€live fubje&amp;ts or citizens fhall have committed  
any crime, or breach of the peace, they thall be amenable to the judges of the  
eountry.  
  
X1. When the faid offenders fhall be a part of the crew of a veflel of their

ful or vice-coniul fhall have been notified thereof: and they fhall be delivered to  
him, if he requires it, to be put again on board of the veflel in which they were  
arrefted, or of others of thei nation, and to be tent eut of the country.  
  
XII. All differences and iuits between the fubjects of the M. C. K. in the

where they exercise judicial power, as in barbarous or certain  
non-Christian lands, they are regarded as endowing with ex-  
traterritoriality the place where their flag is planted! Not  
infrequently consular offices are made inviolable by express  
agreement. The treaty with the German Empire of Decem-  
ber 11, 1871, stipulates that the local authorities shall not  
on any pretext invade the consular office or dwelling, “except  
in the case of the pursuit of crime.” By the second article  
of the treaty between the United States and France of  
November 14, 1788, it was provided that “they [consuls]  
shall place over the outward door of their house the arms of  
their sovereign,’ which according to former usage imported  
inviolability. By the third article of the treaty between th

too great jurisdiction over the vessels from their respective  
countries— that it gave to French consuls “as complete juris-  
diction over French vessels in our harbors as any of the king’s  
officers could exercise over them in the harbors of France.” In  
the tenth article was this provision:  
  
They [the consuls] may cause to be arrested every vessel carrying  
  
the flag of their respective nations; they may sequester them and  
even send them back respectively from the United States to France  
or from France to the United States. They may cause to be arrested,  
without difficulty, every captain, master, sailor or passenger of their  
said respective nations.. They may cause to be arrested and detained  
in the country the sailors and deserters of their respective nations,  
or send them back or transport them out of the country.  
To have given the consuls power to send vessels back, to  
arrest passengers, and to arrest and return sailors would have  
enabled consuls to prevent all emigration from the country  
which they represented. Both the scheme and the convention  
contained this provision.?, Another objectionable feature of th
