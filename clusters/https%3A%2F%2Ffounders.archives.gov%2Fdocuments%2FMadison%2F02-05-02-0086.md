I have still great difficulty in deciding whether I ought to proceed immediately to spain or remain here till I hear from you after you have become acquainted with what has been concluded with France. The arguments for either course have weight. I shall however certainly not go, if at all, till I see that every thing is adjusted here in the fullest manner possible.

[Enclosure]  
1st. October 1800. Treaty between France and Spain of St. Ildephonso. His Catholic Majesty promises and engages on his part to cede back to the French Republic, six months after the full and entire execution of the conditions and stipulations above mentioned, relative to His Royal Highness, the Duke of Parma “the Colony or Province of Louisiana; with the same extent that it actually has in the hands of Spain, that it had, when France possessed it, and such as it ought to be after the Treaty passed subsequently between Spain &amp; other States.”  
  
30 April 1803.  
France ceded to the United States all the Territory which she had thus acquired of Spain. Of what extent is the acquisition? The question is suggested by a doubt whether it comprizes the territory which was called by the British West-Florida: to decide it, a view must be taken of the facts &amp; pri

d in the Cession of Louisiana, lately made by Spain to France, &amp; by the latter to the United States.  
The intention of the parties is to govern in all treaties, as in other contracts; to ascertain that intention in the present Case, it is necessary to take into view the whole article, &amp; construe it so as to give to each part its fair &amp; obvious import.  
The article consists of three distinct parts or members, the 1st. stipulates that the Cession shall comprize Louisiana in the same extent that it actually has in the hands of Spain: 2d. that it had when France possessed it: 3d. as it ought to be after the treaties passed subsequently between Spain &amp; other powers.  
The import of the first member of the article seems to be clear &amp; distinct, &amp; to depend on a single fact, what Louisiana was in the hands of Spain, at the time this Treaty was made. To establish that fact, it seems to be necessary only to ascertain what the limits of the Province then were, by the Regulations of Spain, respecting it, which it is presumed may be easily done. Has Spain considered West-Florida, since her Treaty with Great-Britain, in 1783, as a part of Louisiana? What is the extent of the jurisdiction of the Governor established at N. Orleans? Does it go to the river Perdigo, or is it confined to the island of New-Orleans, and western bank of the river Mississipi? What is the extent of the jurisdiction of the Governor of St. Augustine? Does it comprise E. Florida only, or both the floridas? I am informed by good authority that since the Treaty of 1783, between Britain &amp; Spain, by which the latter became possessed of the whole of Louisiana, &amp; also of East-Florida, that she has governed it as it was governed by France, comprizing W. Florida, as a part of Louisiana, or in other words, that the distinctions between East &amp; W. Florida, which was created by and Known only to the British, ceased.

tion by Spain, that in case France should be disposed at any

It is useless to enquire what those conditions were, and when  
they were complied with. It is well known that from the date of  
the treaty, both parties considered Louisiana as belonging to France;  
that Spain was satisfied with the manner in which France acquitted  
herself towards the Duke of Parma, and never threw any obstacles  
in the way of the delivery of Louisiana, which was delayed only  
on account of causes foreign to the treaty. If Louisiana had no

The commandant, M. D’Abbadie, over-  
whelmed by his embarrassing duties in  
contact with this storm of indignation, and  
unable to stem or quiet the excitement of  
his mercurial and voluble countrymen,  
died of grief. And so strong was the  
hostility to the Spanish rule, that the trans-

1768. By the treaty of peace in 1763,  
all the territory of France and Spain eas¢ of

By the treaty of St. Ildefonso, October

to cede back to the French republic, upon  
the full execution of certain conditions
