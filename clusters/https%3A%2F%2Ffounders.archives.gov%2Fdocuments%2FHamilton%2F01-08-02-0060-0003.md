e authority of the United States.  
In entering upon the argument it ought to be premised, that the objections of the Secretary of State and Attorney General are founded on a general denial of the authority of the United States to erect corporations. The latter indeed expressly admits, that if there be any thing in the bill which is not warranted by the constitution, it is the clause of incorporation.  
Now it appears to the Secretary of the Treasury, that this general principle is inherent in the very definition of Government and essential to every step of the progress to be made by that of the United States; namely—that every power vested in a Government is in its nature sovereign, and includes by force of the term, a right to employ all the means requisite, and fairly applicable to the attainment of the ends of such power; and which are not precluded by restrictions &amp; exceptions specified in the constitution; or not immoral, or not contrary to the essential ends of political society.  
This principle in its application to Government in general would be admitted as an axiom. And it will be incumbent upon those, who may incline to deny it, to prove a distinction; and to shew that a rule which in the general system of things is essential to the preservation of

ear as that which affirms that the powers of the fœderal government, as to its objects, are sovereign, there is a clause of its constitution which would be decisive.

t implied powers are to be considered as delegated equally with express ones.  
Then it follows, that as a power of erecting a corporation may as well be implied as any other thing; it may as well be employed as an instrument or mean of carrying into execution any of the specified powers, as any other instrument or mean whatever. The only question must be, in this as in every other case, whether the mean to be employed, or in this instance the corporation to be erected, has a natural relation to any of the acknowledged objects or lawful ends of the government. Thus a corporation may not be erected by congress, for superintending the police of the city of Philadelphia because they are not authorised to regulate the police of that city; but one may be erected in relation to the coll

cerning it. An incorporation seems to have been regarded as some great, independent, substantive thing—as a political end of peculiar magnitude &amp; moment; whereas it is truly to be considered as a quality, capacity, or mean to an end. Thus a mercantile company is formed with a certain capital for the purpose of carrying on a particular branch of business. Here the business to be prosecuted is the end; the association in order to form the requisite capital is the primary mean. Suppose that an incorporation were added to this; it would only be to add a new quality to that association; to give it an artificial capacity by which it would be enabled to prosecute the business with more safety &amp; convenience.  
That the importance of the power of incorporation has been exaggerated, leading to erroneous conclusions, will further appear from tracing it to its origin. The roman law is the source of it, according to which a voluntary association of individuals at any time or for any purpose was capable of producing it. In England, whence our notions of it are immediately borrowed, it forms a part of the executive authority, &amp; the exercise of it has been often delegated by that authority. Whence therefore the ground of the supposition, that it lies beyond the reach of all those very important portions of sovereign power, legislative as well as executive, which belong to the government of the United States?

a radical source of error in the reasoning.  
It is essential to the being of the National government, that so erroneous a conception of the meaning of the word necessary, should be exploded.  
It is certain, that neither the grammatical, nor popular sense of the term requires that construction. According to both, necessary often means no more than needful, requisite, incidental, useful, or conducive to. It is a common mode of expression to say, that it is necessary for a government or a person to do this or that thing, when nothing more is intended or understood, than that the interests of the government or person require, or will be promoted, by the doing of this or that thing. The imagination can be at no loss for exemplifications of the use of the word in this sense.  
And it is the true one in which it is to be understood as used in the constitution. The whole turn of the clause containing it, indicates, that it was the intent of the convention, by that

The degree in which a measure is necessary, can never be a test of the legal right to adopt it. That must ever be a matter of opinion; and can only be a test of expediency. The relation between the measure and the end, between the nature of the mean employed towards the execution of a power and the object of that power, must be the criterion of constitutionality not the more or less of necessity or utility.

n laws of the State Governments.  
If these are truly the foundation laws of the several states, then have most of them subverted their own foundations. For there is scarcely one of them which has not, since the establishment of its particular constitution, made material alterations in some of those branches of its jurisprudence especially the law of descents. But it is not conceived how any thing can be called the fundamental law of a State Government which is not established in its constitution unalterable by the ordinary legislature. And with regard to the question of necessity it has been shewn, that this can only constitute a question of expediency, not of right.  
To erect a corporation is to substitute a legal or artificial to a natural person, and where a number are concerned to give them individuality. To that legal or artificial person once created, the common law of every state of itself annexes all those incidents and attributes, which are represented as a prostration of the main pillars of their jurisprudence. It is certainly not accurate to say, that the erection of a corporation is against those different heads of the State laws; because it is rather to create a kind of person or entity, to which they are inapplicable, and to which the general rule of those laws assign a different regimen. The laws of alienage cannot apply to an artificial person, because it can have no country. Those of descent cannot apply to it, because it can have no heirs. Those of escheat are foreign from it for the same reason. Those of forfeiture, because it cannot commit a crime. Those of distribution, because, though it may be dissolved, it cannot die.

law; and law must here mean the law of a State as well as of the United States. There never can be a doubt, that a law of the corporation, if contrary to a law of a state, must be overruled as void; unless the law of the State is contrary to that of the United States; and then the question will not be between the law of the State and that of the corporation, but between the law of the State and that of the United States.  
Another argument made use of by the Secretary of State, is, the rejection of a proposition by the convention to empower Congress to make corporations, either generally, or for some special purpose.  
What was the precise nature or extent of this proposition, or what the reasons for refusing it, is not ascertained by any authentic document, or even by accurate recollection. As far as any such document exists, it specifies only canals. If this was the amount of it, it would at most only prove, that it was thought inexpedient to give a power to incorporate for the purpose of opening canals, for which purpose a special power would have been necessary; except with regard to the Western Territory, there being nothing in any part of the constitution respecting the regulation of canals. It must be confessed however, that very different accounts are given of the import of the proposition and of the motives for rejecting it. Some affirm that it was confined to the opening of canals and obstructions in rivers; others, that it embraced banks; and others, that it extended to the power of incorporating generally. Some again alledge, that it was disagreed to, because it was thought improper to vest in Congress a power of erecting corporations—others, because it was thought unnecessary to specify the power, and inexpedient to furnish an additional topic of objection to the constitution. In this state of the matter, no inference whatever can be drawn from it.  
But whatever may have been the nature of the proposition or the reasons for rejecting it concludes nothing in respect to the real merits of the question. The Secretary of State will not deny, that whatever may have been the intention of the framers of a constitution, or of a law, that intention is to be sought for in the instrument itself, according to the usual &amp; established rules of construction. Nothing is more common than for laws to express and effect, more or less than was intended. If then a power to erect a corporation, in any case, be deducible by fair inference from the whole or any part of the numerous provisions of the constitution of the United States, arguments drawn from extrinsic circumstances, regarding the intention of the convention, must be rejected.  
Most of the arguments of the Secretary of State which have not been considered in the foregoing remarks, are of a nature rather to apply to the expediency than to the constitutionality of the bill. They

use of Representatives. It was there urged, that if the constitution intended to confer so important a power as that of erecting corporations, it would have been expressly mentioned. But the case which has been noticed is clearly one in which such a power exists, and yet without any specification or express grant of it, further than as every particular implied in a general power, can be said to be so granted.  
But the argument itself is founded upon an exaggerated and erroneous conception of the nature of the power. It has been shewn, that it is not of so transcendent a kind as the reasoning supposes; and that viewed in a just light it is a mean which ought to have been left to implication, rather than an end which ought to have been expressly granted

cerning the property of the United States, as the same has been practiced upon by the Government.  
A Bank relates to the collection of taxes in two ways; indirectly, by increasing the quantity of circulating medium &amp; quickening circulation, which facilitates the means of paying—directly, by creating a convenient species of medium in which they are to be paid.  
To designate or appoint the money or thing in which taxes are to be paid, is not only a proper, but a necessary exercise of the power of collecting them. Accordingly congress in the law concerning the collection of the duties on imports &amp; tonnage, have provided that they shall be payable in gold &amp; silver. But while it was an indispensible part of the work to say in what they should be paid, the choice of the specific thing was mere matter of discretion. The payment might have been required in the commodities themselves. Taxes in kind, however ill judged, are not without precedents, even in the United States. Or it might have been in the paper money of the several states; or in the bills of the bank of North America, New York and Massachusetts, all or either of them: or it might have been in bills issued under the authority of the United States.  
No part of this can, it is presumed, be disputed. The appointment, then, of the money or thing, in which the taxes are to be paid, is an incident to the power of collection. And among the expedients which may be adopted, is that of bills issued under the authority of the United States.  
Now the manner of issuing these bills is again matter of discretion. Th

it under the direction of those officers as a fund for answering the bills as presented for payment.  
The constitutionality of all this would not admit of a question. And yet it would amount to the institution of a bank, with a view to the more convenient collection of taxes. For the simplest and most precise idea of a bank, is, a deposit of coin or other property, as a fund for circulating a credit upon it, which is to answer the purpose of money. That such an arrangement would be equivalent to the establishment of a bank would become obvious, if the place where the fund to be set apart was kept should be made a receptacle of the monies of all other persons who should

h the government, will be equal to the effect desired to be produced. All the provisions and operations of government must be presumed to contemplate things as they really are.  
The institution of a bank has also a natural relation to the regulation of trade between the States: in so far as it is conducive to the creation of a convenient medium of exchange between them, and to the keeping up a full circulation by preventing the frequent displacement of the metals in reciprocal remittances. Money is the very hinge on which commerce turns. And this does not mean merely gold &amp; silver, many other things have served the purpose with different degrees of utility. Paper has been extensively employed.  
It cannot therefore be admitted with the Attorney General, that the regulation of trade between the States, as it concerns the medium of circulation &amp; exchange ought to be considered as confined to coin. It is even supposeable in argument, that the whole, or the greatest part of the coin of the country, might be carried out of it.

This indeed is a species of regulation of trade; but is one which falls more aptly within the province of the local jurisdictions than within that of the general government, whose care must be presumed to have been intended to be directed to those general political arrangements concerning trade on which its aggregate interests depend, rather than to the details of buying and selling.

ainst the power of applying their money for the institution of a bank. It is true, that they cannot without breach of trust, lay taxes for any other purpose than the general welfare but so neither can any other government. The welfare of the community is the only legitimate end for which money can be raised on the community. Congress can be considered as under only one restriction, which does not apply to other governments—They cannot rightfully apply the money they raise to any purpose merely or purely local. But with this exception they have as large a discretion in relation to the application of money as any legislature whatever. The constitutional test of a right application must always be whether it be for a purpose of general or local nature. If the former, there can be no want of constitutional power. The quality of the object, as how far it will really promote or not the welfare of the union, must be matter of conscientious discretion. And the arguments for or against a measure in this light, must be arguments concerning expediency or inexpediency, not constitutional right.

Another argument made use ol by he Serre

cl a proposition to empower Congress to make, or  
poratIons, either gene,all , or lor sotm* speed  
purpose W hat w « the precise nature orex.e.  
of this proposition, Or wbat thejeavm,* for refusmg!  
  
U, is not ascertained by any authentic document  
or I vc I by accurate recollection. As far as an  
such document exists, n specifies only canals. I  
this was the amount of it, it would at most onl,  
prove, that it .vas thought inexpedient to give  
power to incorporate tor the purpose of opening  
canals; tor which purpose a special power wouh  
It v e been necessary, except with regard to th&lt;  
H esiern i erritory; there being nothing in any part e  
lue constitu ion respecting the regulation of canals  
Ii must ne confessed, however, that very dilTereu  
accounts re given of the import of the proposition  
and ol the motives for rejecting it. Someathrm ilia  
it was con fined to tiie opening of canals and ob  
structions in rivers; others, that ii embraced tranks  
and others, that it extended to the power of incor­  
porating generally. Some again allege, that it wai  
disagree 1 to, Irecause it was thought improper ti  
ve-t m Congress a power of erecting corporations  
others, because it \v..s thought unnecessary tt  
specify the power, and inexpedient to furnish ar  
additional topic o&#x27;. objection to the constitution.—  
In this state ol ihe matter, no inference whatevei  
&#x27; can be drawn irom it.”  
44 But wha ever may have been the nature of tin  
i&gt;rop .ration, or the reasons for rejecting it, nothing  
is 1 .eluded by it, that is, the proposition, in respec  
to the real merits ol the question. The Secretary  
of ijtaie ill not deny, that whatever may hav«  
been the intentions of the framers of a constitution,  
or ol a law; that intention is to ue sought for in tht  
instrument itself, according to the usual and estab­  
lished rules ol construction. Nothing is moil  
common than lot laws to express and effect more  
or less than wa-. intended. It, then, a power in  
erect a corporation in any case, be deducible by fail  
uiiere.ice irom the whole, or any part, of the nu­  
mero .s provisions of the constitution of the U

tions of sovereign power, legislative as well as executive, which belong to the Goy-  
ernment of the United States. An incorporation seems to have been regarded as  
some great independent substantive thing; as a political engine, and of peculiar  
magnitude and moment; whereas it is truly to be considered as a quality, capacity,  
or means to an end. Thus a mercantile company is formed with a certain capital  
for the purpose of carrying on a particular branch of business. Here the business  
to be prosecuted is the end. The association in order to form the requisite capital  
js the primary means. Suppose that an incorporation were added to this, it would  
ynly be to add a new quality to that association ; to give it an artificial capacity by  
which it would be enabled to prosecute the business with more safety and advantage.

A general legislative authority implies a power  
particular legislative power implies authority to erect corporations in relation to  
eases arising under that power only. To erect a corporation is to substitute a legal  
or artificial person ; and where a mumber are concerned, to give them indiv iduality.  
To that legai or ariificial person once created, the common law of every State of  
itself annexes all those incidents and attributes which are represented as a prostra-  
tion of the main pillars of their jurisprudence ; for the true definition of a corpora-  
tion seems to be this: that it is alegadi person, or a persen created by act of law, con-  
sisting of one or more natural persons authorised to hold property, or a franchise

more conclusively than any words.  
  
There is other and stronger authority to the same effect; stonger than even that  
of the Supreme Court. Hamilton’s defence of the constitutionality of the Bank  
vindicates it as a political machine, and the whole argument of this originator of  
the first great bank, is, that it was a public measure. “The simplest and most  
precise idea of a bank,” he says, “is a deposit of coin or other property, as a fund for  
circulating a credit upon it, which is to answer the purpose of money.”’ Privat-  
interests and direction are involved and employed, as the best means of accomplish-  
ing thispublicend. “Itisa medium of exchange, a regulation of trade, and a gen-  
eral object,” he says, ‘* because itsbills are to circulate in ail the revenues of the coun-

says: &quot;If there be any general principle

that every power vested in the Government

means requisite and fairly applicable to  
the attainment of the end of such power,  
unless they are excepted in the Constitu­

## The pendency of new provisions for the replenishment of the treasury, some of which contemplate a less rigid adherence to the fundamental safeguards against depreciation of the currency than the Secretary of the Treasury himself advises in his late report, seem to make it proper to recur for a moment to the consideration of the very grave question, decided by Congress ten months ago, when the law was passed making the government notes a legal tender for the payment of debts

taxes by borrowing money ; and I cannot see why, if metallic money is  
scarce, and the collection of taxes slow, difficult or impossible, from want  
of a circulating medium, it may not authorize the issue of Treasury notes  
to supply the deficiency.  
  
In the celebrated argument of Mr. Hamrtron on the constitutionality  
of a Bank of the United States, in February, 1791, he says, on this sub-  
ject: “ To designate or appoint the money, ora thing in which taxes are  
to be paid, is not only a proper but a necessary exercise of the power of  
collecting them. The payment might have been required in the commo-  
dities themselves; taxes in kind, (however ill-judged,) are not without  
precedents even in the United States; or it might have been in the  
paper money of the several States, or in the bills of the Bank of North  
America, New-York or Massachusetts, all or either of them; or it might  
have been in bills issued under the authority of the United States.” The
