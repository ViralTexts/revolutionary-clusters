ting Republic of Geneva has been such, that I should be wanting in not giving you the mournful recital of it’s expiring convulsions. Such a detail will be void neither of interest nor utility to your prudent Countrymen: May they reflect on it with attention, and learn by the disastrous example of the most Democratical State that exists on the Continent of Europe, the extreme danger of foreign influence; and above all, how rapid and inevitable it is, to transgress the feeble interval which seperates the abuse of liberty from its ruin!

new faction composed of the dregs of their own party, not numerous it is true, but who under the name of Marseillois and Montagnards, and having the French resident evidently at their head, desired nothing less than the downfall of all religion, preached the most extreme principles of the French, and seemed to aspire to imitate them in every thing or to deliver themselves up to them.

“Public notoriety has informed you of the deplorable scenes, which have plunged the City of Geneva into the depths of affliction, that Republic, for whose welfare we have constantly been interested, resulting from the long and intimate relations as allies, and from the habitual connexions of a close neighbourhood, is now a prey to unheard of calamities, of which it is impossible to foresee either the extent, the duration or the consequences.

ges on persons and properties are preparing and are put into execution in despite of the oaths the established forms and the laws of the state; and Geneva overwhelmed with consternation awaits in terror the fate preparing for her by these bloody Insurgents, who have usurped the right of disposing of the lives and fortunes of their fellow Citizens.  
“We view with extreme grief the mournful destiny of a City, whose happiness and peace were at all times the object of our care, and whose situation so nearly interests the tranquillity of our state, and that of Switzerland; but the knowledge which we have acquired of the criminal participation of several individuals of our country in the horrible excesses which we have just related, aggravates more and more our grief and adds to our indignation. Our paternal sollicitude for the safety and honour of our Country does not permit us to tolerate on our territory those men stained with crimes; we ordain by the present publication, that entrance thereon be interdicted to them and it is our pleasure that all those of our Subjects who shall be known to have had a share in these atrocious scenes, be instantly denounced, and seized, reserving to ourselves to pronounce the just punishments which their guilty conduct in a city so long a time our Ally may have deserved.  
“We doubt not, Dear and Liege, that participating with us the sentiments which animate us, you will redouble your activity and zeal in the execution of this present ordonnance;
