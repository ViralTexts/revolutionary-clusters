, Philadelphia. The extreme effort with which I have endeavored to maintain the harmony and good understanding between Spain and the United States have made me read with a peculiar sensation the article of the message of the president sent to Congress the third of this month on political relations between the United States and the king my master. As in the exposition to which I allude, there exist, it seems to me, various equivocations of a delicate and important propensity, although I do the president of the United States the justice due upon the motives that could have caused this apparent lack of exactitude, my character imposes on me the obligation to enter into the examination of some of his assertions to show that, whether through lack of exact information, or through faulty translations, they appear in some cases not to be correct.  
In the article of the said message relative to Spain, the president, after mentioning that the negotiations for ending existing differences had not had a felicitous issue, continues: “Compensation for the spoliations produced during the previous War, and for which Spain had formally acknowledged herself responsible, she now denies us except under conditions that affect other claims that have no connection with her. Nevertheless, she has renewed the same practice in the present War, and these new spoliations are already to a great amount.” It is well known that in a state of war [there] exists, and probably will always exist, some abuse of the power entrusted to subordinate hands. Even the United States has been unable to be an exception to this general rule, and in the short period of hostilities towards France in the year 1798, in spite of not having armed privateers, and reducing its defensive force to a small number of frigates, neutrals experienced from [the United States] many annoyances, well demonstrated by the numerous claims of the injured powers on this Government, principally on the part of Denmark and Sweden. In the past War there perhaps could have been some abuses of this nature, although very rare, on the part of the royal navy of Spain; but the king my master, animated by the spirit of justice that characterizes him, authorized his chief secretary of state to sign a convention with the American minister near his person by which was stipulated reciprocal compensation for the damages that the subjects and citizens of both might have experienced on the part of officers or individuals of either [country] contrary to human rights or to the Law of Nations. This stipulation resembled that of the same kind in the treaty of friendship and limits made in 1795, and fulfilled religiously by my sovereign, would have now had the same effect, through the ratification of the convention, if there had not been inserted in it an article whose tendency was to impose on Spain an obligation for a responsibility as grave and important in its consequences as [it was] little supported by reason and justice under the circumstances. My court, by direct means as well as through me, has repeatedly shown the American government that it was disposed to carry out the said stipulations provided that the article in the same convention relative to the said responsibility be suppressed, or altered in a way that it believed conformed to justice; and it has been so far from refusing to fulfill the said compensation for claims that have no connection with it, that in reality this connection has been precisely the reason that the said convention has not been carried into effect as the king my master has always wished. It is certain that the two points in their nature do not have a connection with each other; but it is also true that this connection is very great when it is considered it attempts to make these two things, diverse in themselves, parts of the same whole; hence results the disagreeable dilemma for the king my master, whether to refuse to ratify a stipulation that he believes fair, and that he consequently wishes to carry out, or to impose upon himself a responsibility more or less direct in favor of the United States that they, as is well proven, have no right to claim.  
As for the new spoliations, I can assure you, there are very few Spanish vessels that strictly merit this denomination, many of the seizures frequently listed in the American gazettes originating either in acts of contraband trade, or from the lack of papers that they ought to carry on board according to our treaty of 1795, or from other circumstances that the captains or owners of the said seized ships have been very careful to hide; leaving this aside, the citizens of the United States would find the same justice that they experienced on this point under the treaty of 95. I can do no less than observe, having had the honor of informing you some two months ago, that the most strict orders had been given by the king my master that the navigation of Americans employed in licit commerce should not be interrupted; the president has not made any mention of this circumstance as important in its effects for American navigations, as for demonstrating [the king’s] just and peaceful intentions.  
Without it being my intention to use recrimination, I am obliged to notice that when violations of the rights of neutrality occur infinitely more frequent and extensive on the part of England, whose Royal Navy vessels have almost constantly blockaded the ports of the United States; and what is more, when this power daily decrees new principles upon the rights of neutrals, that really undermine them and reduce them to nothing, the name of Great Britain is not found in any column of the president’s message. These circumstances in themselves would not give me the right to accent them if it were not for one, extremely essential, that immediately affects the interests of the king my master; I allude to the huge numbers of American sailors carried off by force from the shelter of the flag under which they ought to find themselves protected, and who find themselves forced to fight in British ships against the subjects of the king my master. This conduct cannot but excite in me the obligation to remind the Government of the United States of it in order that in its wisdom it may take suitable means to correct an abuse that at the same time that it actually violates its neutrality continues so greatly damaging to Spain.  
The president goes on to say: “Our commerce through the River Mobile continues to be obstructed by arbitrary duties, and troublesome searches.” Although this assertion is not accompanied by any remark that could make it look like a national offense, I cannot but observe in passing that according to what I am informed the import and export duties on the Mobile are very moderate, of only six percent; that each power can arrange these matters within the limits of its jurisdiction as it thinks; and that this practice of Sovereignty is executed by the American government at Fort Stoddert, being within its boundary, without Spain pretending to interfere in its regulations. Ultimately, this might be an inconvenience, but in no way can it be presented as a national offense.  
After, he says: “Propositions for adjusting amicably the limits of Louisiana have not been acceded to.” This proposal is not strictly correct, since it is, and has been, the wish and the intention of Spain to adjust amicably the limits of Louisiana: but although her dispositions toward this end may have been, and are, friendly, she cannot sacrifice to them either the dignity or the rights of her crown; so that this matter not having been concluded has not been because of the lack of will for adjusting amicably as the president supposes, but because of the nature of the propositions, which were inadmissible.  
The same paragraph continues: “While the title continues undecided we have abstained from changing the state of things, from taking new positions, or fortifications in the disputed territories with the hope that the other power will not compel us, by a contrary conduct, to follow its example, and generate conflicts of authority whose consequences would not be easy to contain; but we now have reasons to lessen our confidence in this hope.” Truly I cannot comprehend what it is that the president could call unsettled title, much less if he wishes to apply it to that part of West Florida between the Mississippi and Iberville, the Lakes, and the Perdido River. The title to this territory cannot be considered as undecided or unsettled, since putting aside that given by possession, and the treaty of retrocession of Louisiana to France, there is another conclusive circumstance, well known to the American government, that ought to and must dissipate all doubts, if they should exist on this point. The most distinguished publicists agree that the true interpreters of a treaty doubtful in any of its clauses or expressions are the contracting parties themselves when this can be achieved. Spain and France are these in the treaty of retrocession upon which the sale of 30 April is based, from which emanate the pretensions of the American Government; they have declared, as is evident to you, that Spain had no intention to give France more than she had received from her, as the title and the word retrocession used in it indicate; and France had neither claimed nor expected an inch of land to the east of the Mississippi, Iberville, and Lakes. The true intention of the contracting parties being stated and shown in this manner, I will content myself with copying to you here a short paragraph from Vattel among the many other publicists who one could present in support of the rights of the king my master upon this point. In paragraph 274 of the interpretation of treaties, Vattel says: “When we manifestly see what is the sense that agrees with the intention of the contracting Powers, it is not permitted to turn their words to a contrary meaning. The intention sufficiently known furnishes the true matter of the convention of what is promised &amp; accepted, demanded &amp; granted. To violate the Treaty is to go contrary to the intentions sufficiently manifested, rather than against the terms in which it is conceived; for the terms are nothing without the intention that ought to dictate them.” In view of this, the position that the president has taken in the cited paragraph that the right (no doubt alluding to a territorial right) could be doubtful, or unsettled, cannot be admitted, and all persuasions and conclusions emanating from this supposition fall of themselves; leaving that aside, as I have had the honor to inform you previously, whatever alteration may have existed in the territories of His Catholic Majesty, either could have been the effect of a new plan for the frontier that the alienation of Louisiana made necessary, or must have proceeded from the circumstances of the war in which Spain is now engaged with England, and in no way has the goal of disturbing the peace, and good harmony between Spain and the United States.  
The president goes on to say: “Lately forays or incursions have been made into the territories of Orleans, and Mississippi. Our Citizens have been seized, and their property stolen in those same places that Spain has transferred to us and this by regular officers and soldiers of this Government.”  
Although on this point I have no more news than that received from the American gazettes, whose reports one cannot expect to be very impartial, nevertheless, supposing them correct in all their extent, it does not follow from those that I have read, nor does it seem to me credible, that the officers and soldiers of the king my master, might have crossed the American line in order to commit within the jurisdiction of these states the insults that are surmised. The first example of these incursions was given by a lot of American citizens in the month of August 1803, penetrating the territory of Baton Rouge, aided by the Kemper brothers and other malcontents from the Spanish side with them, who made an attempt to seize the fort of Baton Rouge, and imprisoned some mayors and other persons of note. About this matter I had the honor to speak and write to you, but I have not until now had the least response. If seizing the person of American citizens (our citizens have been seized) has some reference to the apprehension of the Kemper brothers inside the American line, I must declare first that, according to what I am informed, the said Kempers are not American citizens; having been established in Spanish territory, they have become subjects of the king my master, and consequently have lost their rights as American citizens; and second, because in the arrest of these subjects according to the extract of a letter from Natchez of 8 Oct. last, published in the Gazette of the United States at Philadelphia, their arrest was accomplished by negroes,mulattoes, and American citizens, who no doubt expected some recompense for delivering them inside the Spanish line, from where it seems some Spanish soldiers were charged with conducting them to Baton Rouge. It is true, it is said also, that part of a cavalry company commanded by a certain Captain Jones had crossed another part of the border and had conducted themselves in a hostile and violent manner toward two families; but if a story of this nature should be certain, I can assure you that the government of the United States shall not fail to receive the appropriate satisfaction from Spain, whose government has too well established its reputation for one to attribute to it knowledge or approbation of acts as improper in their character as useless in their effects. Incidents of this nature often occur on the borders of all countries and only deserve attention when they receive the sanction of the government of the aggressors, or the satisfaction due in such cases is denied.  
I have examined step by step the article of the president’s message relative to Spain, and I have tried to present with candor and truth, although lightly, whatever can elucidate correct ideas about its nature and tendency. Having discharged this obligation belonging to my stat

with particular regret, the article of the president ’s  
message, sent to congress the 3d inst. respecting the  
political relations betwixt the United States and the  
king my master. As in the exposition to which I al­  
lude, there exist in my opinion, several mistakes of  
a delicate and important tendency, although I render  
to the president due justice in regard to the motives  
which may have caused this apparent want of corect­  
ncss, yet my character imposes on me the task of en­  
tering into an examination of some of his assertions  
and of demonstrating that eitner from the want of  
exact information, or owing to defective translations,  
they appeal in some cases not altogether correct.  
In&#x27; the article of the president’s message relative to  
Spain, after mentioning; that the negotiations for the  
settlement of the existing differences had not had a  
satisfactory issue, he says, “ spoliations during the  
former war for which she had formally acknowledg­  
ed herself responsible, have been refused to be com­  
pensated, but on conditions affecting other claims in  
no wise connected with them. Yet the same practices  
are renewed in the present war and are already of  
great amount.” It is very well known that m a state  
of war, there exists and will probably ever exist, a  
certain abuse of force, confided to subaltern hands.  
Even the United States themselves have not been an  
exception to this general rule, and during the short  
period of hostilities with France, in the year 1798  
notwithstanding no privateers were armed and that  
their protecting forces consisted only of a small num­  
ber of frigates, neutrals experienced from them ma­  
ny injuries, well authenticated by the numerous claims  
on this government by the injured powers, principal­  
ly on the part ot Denmark and Sweden.  
Probably there might have existed last war some  
abuses ot this nature, although very rare, on the part  
of the royal navy of Spain ; but the king, my mafter,  
animated by the love of justice, which characterises  
him, authorised his principal secretary of state to sign  
a convention with the American minister near his  
person, in- which were stipulated reciprocal compen­  
sations for the damages and injuries their respective  
subjects and citizens might have sustained from offi­  
cers, or individuals of either, contrary to the right  
and laws of nations. This stipulation, similar to  
that of the same nature in the treaty of frindship  
navigation and limits, concluded in and scrupu­  
lously complied ivith by my sovereign, would now  
have had the same effect by the ratification of the  
convention, had notan article been inserted therein  
tending to impose on Spain the obligation of a respon­  
sibility both detrimental and important in its result  
as well as unsupported by reason and justice under  
the existing circumstances. My court has in a direct  
manner, as wed as through me, repeatedly manifest­  
ed to the American government its readiness to car­  
ry the said stipulations into effect, whenever the arti­  
cle in the same convention relative to the abovemen­  
ticned responsibility, should either be suppressed or  
altered in a manner more conformable to justice • and  
lias beeu so far from refusing to satisfy said compen­  
sations on account of other claims in no wise connect­  
ed with them, that it was precisely because they are  
connected that the said convention has not been car­  
ried into effect, as was and still is the wish of the  
king my master.  
1: is true that the two subjects by their nature are  
not connected with each other in themselves, but it  
;s also true, that this connexion is very great, when  
we consider that un endeavour is made to form out  
  
of these two things, distinct in themselves, compo­  
nent parts of the xcme whole; thereby, placing the  
kinp;, my master, under the disagreeable dilemma of  
either refusing to ratify a stipulation which he con­  
ceives to be just, and therefore wishes to fulfil, or else  
ot taking on himself a responsibility, moreor less di­  
rect, in favour of the United States to which it is well  
proved they have no right to pretend.  
In regard to what concerns the new spoliations I  
can assure you, sir, few are those that can strictly  
merit this denomination on the part of Spanish ves­  
sels, as many of the captures, which so frequently  
figure in the American papers, arise either from acts  
of contraband, or from a want of having on board  
the documents required by the treaty of 1795, or

to demonstrate his just pacifick intentions.  
\\ ilhout any view to recrimination, I find it neces­  
sary to observe, that although the violations of the.  
rights of neutrals are infinitely more f requent and  
extensive on the part of England, whose vessels of  
the royal navy have almost continually blockaded  
the ports of tile United States, and what is more,  
when this power daily establishes new principles on  
the rights ot neutrals, which in reality, tend to un­  
dermine and annihilate them—the name of Oreat­

rhese circumstances In themselves would not au­  
tlmurize any animadversions on my part, were it not  
for a most essential one which immediately affects  
the interests of the king my master. I allude to the  
many thousand .dmrrican sailors violently forced from  
the shelter of the fl ig which ought to protect them,  
| and compelled to fight on board of British ships of  
war, against the subjects of the king my master. 1  
cannot but call the attention of the government of the  
U. States towards such a conduct, that m their wis­  
dom, thev may adopt the necessary measures to cor­  
rect an abuse, which at the same time that it violates  
their neutrality ;s extremely prejudicial to Spain.  
File president adds—M on the Mobile, our com­  
merce passing through that river continues to be ob­  
structed by arbitrary duties and vexatious searches.”  
Although this assertion is not accompanied by anv  
observation whatever, which might cause it to be  
viewed as a national offence, I must observe, that  
according to my information, the duties orj imports  
and exports are very moderate, onlv six per cent.*

it never surely can be pretended as a national of­  
fence.  
He afterwards says—“ propositions for adjusting  
amicably the boundaries of Louisiana have not been  
acceded to.” This assertion is not strictly correct ;  
fi.r it is, and always has been, the wish as’well as the  
intention of Spain, to adjust amicably the limits of  
Louisiana; but however friendly (arnicablej may  
have been her disposition towards it, she cannot sa­  
crifice thereto either the dignity or rights of her  
crown ; so that it was not, as the president suppo­  
ses, owing to the want of a desire of adjusting ami­  
cabiy, that this business was not concluded ; but ra­  
ther from the nature of the proposals, which were  
in themselves inadmissible. The paragraph contin­  
ues—“ While the right is unsettled, we have avoided  
I to change the state of things, by taking new posts, or  
strengthening ourselves in the disputed territories,  
in the hope that the other would not, bv a contrary  
conduct, oblige us to meet their example, and en­  
danger conflicts of authourity, the issue of which may  
not easily be controuled ; but in this hope we have  
now reason to lessen our confidence.”  
In truth, I cannot comprehend what the president  
can call unsettled right; and still less, if he wishes  
to apply it to that part ot \V. Florida comprehended  
within the Mississippi, Iberville, and the river Per­  
dido. The right of this territory cannot be consi­  
dered as unsettled or doubtful; for independent of  
that right arising from actual possession ami from  
the treaty of retrocession of Louisiana to France,  
there is another conclusive circumstance, well known  
to the American government, which ought and must  
dissipate every doubt, if any could even exist on the  
subject. The most distinguished civilians agree, that  
the true interpreters of a treaty, doubtful in any of  
its clauses or expressions, are the contracting parties  
themselves, when this can he obtained. Spain and  
Franco, who were the contracting parties in the  
treaty of retrocession, on which is founded that of  
sale, of the 30th of April, from whence the preten­  
sions of the American government emanate, have  
explained it in the manner already known to you,  
sir ; namely that it was not the intention of Spain to ]  
cede to France more than she had received from  
her, as the title and word retrocession made use of  
therein, clearly imply ; and that France never would  
have pretended or hoped to obtain one inch of land  
east of the Mississippi, Iberville Sc the lakes. The true  
intention of the contracting parties being thus ex­  
pressly manifested. I shall content myself by copy­  
ing a single paragraph from Vatlel, among many o- {  
ther similar ones which I could produce from other  
civilians, in support of the rights of the king, my j  
master, on this subject.  
  
Iii paragraph 274of “ The interpretation of Trea­  
ties,” Vattel says—“ When we manifestly see what  
is the sense that agrees with the intention of the con­  
tracting /lowers, it is not permitted to turn their  
words to a contrary meaning. The intention suffi­  
ciently known furnishes the true matter of the con­  
vention, of what is promised and accepted, demand­  
ed and granted. To violate the treaty, is to go con­  
trary to the intention sufficiently manifested, rather  
than against the terms in which it is conceived ; for  
the terms are nothing without the intention through­  
out to dictate them.&quot; According to this, the posi­  
tion taken by the president, in the said paragraph of  
his message, that the right (no doubt alluding to the  
territorial right) was doubtful or ttnseti/ed, is inad­  
missible, and of course all the iiishv&#x27; ions and conse­  
quences he draws from this supposition, fall com­  
pletely to the ground. Besides, whatever alte­  
ration or change might have taken place in the ter­  
* Note—It is necessary to remark that the navi­  
gation of the Mobille, which appears to furnish the  
president a motive of complaint, is enjoyed by the  
Americans, in consequence of a gracious indulgence  
on the part of Spain ; as no right does yet exist, to  
navigate the waters of that river within the bounda

to my late information these Kempers are not sJmc­  
rtcancttizens, because when they settled themselves  
in the Spanish territory, they became subjects of the  
king, and of course had tost their 1 ights as Ameri­  
, can citizens ? and in the second, tint the arrest of  
these persons, according to a letter from Nb.chez of  
the 8th October last, published in the United States  
Gazette, of Philadelphia, was effected by negroes,  
mulaltoes and American citizens, who. no doubt ex­  
pected some recompense, delivered them vcithin the  
Spanish lines, from whence it appears, some Spa­  
nish soldiers took charge of to conduct them to Baton  
Kouge. It is true,- th-it it has aho been said, that a  
part of a company of cavalry commanded bv a cer­  
tain captain Jones, had entered another part of the  
line and had conducted themselves in a violent and  
improper manner, towards two families ; but should  
this account be true. I can assure von, sir, that the  
government of the United States shall receive due  
satstaction from Spain, the reputation of whose go­  
vernment is too well established, to believe it can in  
any manner be privy to, or approve of acts, as far be­  
neath its character, as tht y are useless in their ef.  
f orts. Incidents of this nature often happen on the  
frontiers of every country, and thev c.nlv deserve at­  
tention when thev receive the sanction of the govern­  
ment of the aggressors, or when in sucli cases, due  
satisfaction is refused.  
I have gone over, step by step, the article of the  
president’s message, which relates to Spain, and I  
have endeavoured to present with candour and truth,  
although in a cursory manner whatever mav rive  
cnrcct rdeas on its nature and tendency. Having

read with particular regret, the article  
of the preside u’s message, sent to  
congress the 3d irstant, fespcctin, the  
political relation * between the United  
States an.l the king my master. As  
• 5:i the exposition to which I allude,  
there exist in my opinion Several mis­  
ta’« s of a delicate and important ten­  
dency, although I render to the pre­  
sident due justice, in regard to the  
motives which nuty have caused this  
apparent want of correctness, yet my  
f character, imposes o.i me the tax of  
entering into an examination of some  
of liis assertions, and of demonstrat­  
ing that either from the want of exact  
information, or owing to defective  
translations, they appear in some cases !  
,. not altogether correct.  
In the article of the president&#x27;* met- 1  
sage relative to Spain, after mentioning 1  
that the negotiations for the settlement  
■ of the existing differences had not had  
* a satisfactory issue, he says “ spoliati­  
ons during tho former war for which  
he had formally acknowledged herself  
  
responsible, nave been ref/^il to be com*  
per,sated, but on conditi ms allotting o  
t her claims in no wi»e connected with  
t! cm. Yet the same practices are re  
newed in the present war ft are already of  
great amount.&quot; !t is very well known  
that in a state of war, there exists amt  
will piobuldy ever exist, a certain abuse  
•■f force, confined to subaltern hands, li  
ven the United Sta&#x27;es themselves have  
not been an exception to this general  
rule, and during the short period of hos­  
tilities with Mance, in the year 1798, not !  
withstanding no privateers were armed  
and that their protecting fore :s consist­  
ed only or a small number of frigates,  
neutrals cxperienc -tl from them many in­  
juries, well authtfricated by the nume­  
rous claims on this government by the  
injured powers, principally on the pan  
of Denmark and Sweden.  
Piobably there might have existed last  
war some abuses of this nature, although  
very rare, on ihe part of tire royal navy  
of Spain; but the king my master, ani­  
mated by the love of justice, which cha  
raclerises him, authorised his principal  
secretary of sta&#x27;c to si,gn a convention  
, with the American minister near his pei­  
son, in which were stipulated reciprocal  
compensations for the damages and inju  
ties their respective subjects and citizens  
m*ght have sustained from officers, or in­  
dividuals of either, c&amp;nliary to the right  
and laws of nations. This stipulation,

intentions.  
Without any view to recrimination, I  
find it necessary to observe, that although  
the violations of the i ights of neutials ai •  
infinitely more frequent and extensive on  
I he part oT England, whose vessels of the  
royal navy have almost continually block­  
aded the ports of the Uniled Stales, and  
what is more, when this power daily es­  
tablishes new principles on the rights of  
natitrala, which in reality, tend lo under,  
mine ; nd annihilate them—the name of  
Great Britain is no where to be found in  
the columns of the president&#x27;s message.  
\ The circumstances in themselves  
would not authorize any animadversions  
on my part, were itnot for a most essen­  
tial one which immediately alTetts the in  
teieats of the king my master—I al­  
lude te many thomand American tiailort  
vi &gt;lently forced from the sb«lti r cf the  
dig which ought to proteCl them, and  
compelled lo fight on board of British  
ships of war, against the subjects of the  
king, my master. I cannot but call the  
attention of the government of the United  
States towards such a conduct, that in  
their wisdom, they may adopt the neces­  
sa;y measures lo cerrect an abuse, which  
at the same time that it violates their neu­  
trality is extremely prejudicial to Spam.  
The president adds, “ On the Mobillc,,  
our commerce passing through that river :  
continues tolje obit rutted by arbitrary du-,  
lies and vexatious searches.&#x27;’ Although  
this assertion is not accompanied by any j  
  
abservaildn whaler, which Thigh* cat}***  
it to be viewed ak a national offence, I  
must observe, that Recording to toy in­  
formation, the duties on imports and ex­  
ports are Very moderate, only 6 per cent.*  
that evety power hsi a right to regulate  
as they please these objects within the  
boundaries of theit\ jurisdiction, «m]  
that this exercise of sovereignty is prac­  
tised by the American government at  
Fort Stodderl; that is, w ithin li.tir lines,  
without any pretensions on the part of  
Spain to interfere in their regulations.  
Hut even admitting it may be trouble­  
some, it never surely can be pretended as  
a national offence.  
He afterwards trays—“ Propositions for  
adjusting amicably ih« boundaries of Lou­  
isi-na h-ve not been acccedcd to. &#x27; This  
assertion is not strict)* correct ; for it is,  
and always has been, the wisli as weii as  
tire intention of Spain, to adjust amicably  
the limits ol Louisiana ; but however  
friendly (amicable) may have been her  
disposition towards it, she cannot sacrifice  
thereto either thed&#x27;gnny or rights of her  
crown ; so that it \us not, as the presi­  
dent supposes, owing to the want of a  
desire of adjusting am:cab/yt that this  
business was not concluded ; but rather  
Trora the nature of the proposals, which  
were iu themselves inadmissible. The  
paragraph continues—“ While the right  
is unsettled, we have avoided to change  
the state of things, by taking new posts,  
or strengthening ourselves in the disputed  
territories, in the hope that the other  
power would not, by a contrary conduit,  
oblige us to meet their example, and  
endangei ronflicls of authority, the issue  
of which may not easily be comrouled ;  
but in this hope we have now reason to  
| lessen our confidence.” In truth, I can­  
not comprehend what the president can  
j call unsettled right ; and st II leas, if he  
I wishes to annlv it to that nnrt ,.r w...  
  
Florida comprehended within the Mis­  
biasippi, Iberville, the lakes, and the rivet  
Perdido. The ii}jht of this territory  
cannot be considered as unartiltd or

there is another conclusive circum­  
stance well known to the American  
government, which ought anil must  
dissipate every doubt, if any could  
ever exist on this subject.  
The most distin guished civilians  
agree, that the true interpreters of a  
treaty, doubtful in any of its clauses  
or expressions, are the contracting  
parties themselves, when this can  
be obtained. Spain and France, who  
were the contract-in nartics in the  
treaty of retrocession, on which is  
founded that of sale of the 30th of A­  
pril, from whence the pretensions  
ot the American government ema­  
nate, have explained it in the man­  
ner already known to you. sir, name­  
ly, that it was not the intention of  
Spain to cede t France more than  
she had received from he, as the  
title and word retrocession therein  
made use of, clearly imply ; and  
that France never would have pre­  
tended or hoped to obtain one inch  
of land east of the Mississippi, Iber­  
ville and the Lakes The true inten­  
tion of the contracting parties - being  
thus clearly manifejteiy i shall content  
myself with copying a single para­

PuILADELPUIA, 6th December, 1805.  
SIR,  
  
The zeal with which I have endeavored to pre-  
serve the harmony and good understanding betwixt  
Spain and the United States, has caused me to read  
with particular regard the article of the president’s  
message, sent to Congress the 3d inst. respecting  
the political relations betwixt the U. States and the  
king my master. As in. the exposition to which I  
allude there exists in my opinion, several mistakes  
of a delicate and important tendency, although I ren-  
  
_ der to the president due justice in regard to the  
motives which may have caused this apparent want  
of correctness, yet my character imposes on me the  
task of entering into an examination of some cf his  
  
* assertions,and of demonstrating that either from the  
want of exact information, or owing to defective  
translations they appearin some cases not altogeth-  
er correct.  
  
In the article of the President’s Message relative  
to Spain, after mentioning that the negociations for  
the settlement of the existing differences had not  
had a satisfactory issue, he says, “« Spoliations dur-  
ing a former war for which she ha  
knowled red herself resp  
  
~~»  
~~ &amp; ‘ ee |  
  
. formally ac-  
onsible, have been refused  
  
2a condiuocs affecting oth.  
  
  
  
  
  
er claims in no wise connected with them. Yet the  
same practices are renewed in the present war, and  
are already of great amount.” It is very well  
known that in a state of war, there exists and wil!  
  
robably ever exist,a certain abuse of force, confi-  
Red to subaltern hands: Even the United States  
themselves have not been an exception to this gen-  
eral rule, and during the short period of hostilities  
with France, in the year 1798, notwithstanding no  
privateers were armed, and that their protecting  
forces consisted only of a small number of frigates,  
neutrals experienced from them many injuries, well  
authenticated by the numerous claims on this gov-  
ernment by the injured powers, principally om the  
part of Denmark and Sweden.  
  
Probably there might have existed last war some  
abuses of this nature, although very rare on the part  
of the royal navy of Spain; but the king my master,  
animated by that love of justice, which characterizes  
him,authorised his principal secretary of state to sign  
a convention with the American minister near his  
person, in which were stated reciprocal compensa-  
tions for the damages their respective subjects and  
citizens might have sustained from officers, or in-  
dividuals of either, contrary to the right and laws of  
nations. This stipulation, similar tothat of the  
same nature in the treaty of friendship, navigation  
and limits, concluded in 1795, and scrupulously com-  
plied with by my sovereign,would now have had the  
same etfect by the ratification of the convention, had  
not an article been inserted therein tending to impose  
on Spain the obligation of a responsibility both detri-  
mental and important in its result, as well as un-  
supported by reason and justice under the existing  
circumstances. My court has in a direct manner, as  
well as through me, repeatedly manifested to the A-  
merican government its readiness to carry the said  
stipulation into effect, whenever the article in the  
same convention relative to the above mentioned res-  
pousibility, should either be suppressed or altered in  
a manner more conformable to justice, and has  
been so far from refusing to satisfy said compensa-  
tions on account of other claims in: no wise connected  
with them, that it was precisely because they are con-  
nected that the said convention has not been carri-  
ed into effect, as was, and stillis, the wish of the  
king my master.  
  
It is true that the two subjects by their nature are  
not connected witheach other in themselves, but it is  
also true, that this connection is very great, when we  
consider that an endeavor is made to form out of  
these two things, distinct in themselves, component  
parts ofthe same whole: thereby placing the king,  
my master, under the disagreeable dilemma of ei-  
ther refusing to ratify a stipulation which he con-  
cives to be just, aud therefore wishes to fulfil, or  
else of taking on hims:lf a responsibility, more or  
  
less direct, in favor of the United States, to which  
  
it is well proved they have no right topretead.  
  
In regard to what concerns the new spoliations, I  
can assure you, sir, few are those&#x27;that can strictly  
merit this denomination on the part of Spanish  
vessels, as many of the captures which so frequent.  
ly figure in the American papers, arise cither from  
acts of contraband, or froma want of having on  
board the documents required by the treaty of 1795,  
or even from other circumstances which the captains  
and owners of said prizes will take good care to  
conceal; besides, on this head, the citizens of the  
United States would receive that justice which they  
have already experienced on the same subject in vir-  
tue of the treaty of 1795. I cannot but observe, that  
although [had the honor of communicating to you,  
sir,two months ago, that the strictest injunctions had  
been given by the king my master, not to interrupt  
the navigation of American citizens, when employ-  
ed in a lawfol trade, no mention is made by the pres-  
ident of this circumstance, as highly important in  
its effects towards the American commerce, as it is  
  
necessary to demonstrate his just and pacific inten-  
tions.  
  
Without any view to recrimination, I find it ne.  
cessary to observe, that although the violations of  
the rights of neutrals are infinitely more frequent  
and extensive on the part of Englaud, whose ves-  
sels of the reyal navy have alinost continually block-  
aded the ports of the United States, and what is  
more, when this power daily establishes new princi-  
ples on the rights of neutrals, which in reality, tend  
to undermine and annihilate them; the name of  
Great-EBrirain is no where to be fuund inthe col.  
umns of the President&#x27;s message.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
These circumstances in themselves would not au-  
thorize any animadversion on my part, were it  
not for a most essential one which immediately af-  
fects the interests of the king, my master—I ailude  
to the many thousand American sailors violently for-  
ced from the shelter of the flag which ought to pro.  
tect them, and compelled to fight on board of Brit-  
ish ships of war, against the subjects of the king my  
master. I cannot but call the attention of the goy-  
  
ernment of the U. States towards such a conduct,  
  
that in their wisdom, they might adopt the necessa.  
ry measures to correct an abuse, which at the same  
time that it violates their neutrality is extremely  
predjudicial to Spain  
  
The president adds, ‘*On the Mobile, our com-  
merce passing that river continues to be obstructed by  
arbitrary duties and vexatious searches.’’ Altho’  
this assertion is not accompanied by any observa-  
tion whatever, which might cause it to be viewed as  
a national offence, I must observe, that according to  
ray inforraation, the duties on imports and exports  
are very moderate, only 6 percent.* that every pow-  
er has a right to regulate as they please these ob-  
jects within the boundaries of their jurisdiction, and  
that this exercise of sovereignty is practised bythe  
American government at Fort Stoddert ; . that is,  
within the lines, without any pretension on the part  
of Spain to interfere in their regulations. But even  
admitting it may be troublesome, it never surely can  
be pretended as a national offence.  
  
He afterwards says—* Propositions for adjust-  
ing amicabl: the boundaries of Louisiana have not  
been acceded to.’? This assertion is not strictly  
correct ; for it is, and always has been, the wish as  
well as the intention of Spain, to adjust amicably  
the limits of Louisiana ; but however triendly ( a@:-  
icable ) may have been her disposition towards it,  
she cannot sacrifice thereto either the dignity or  
rights of hercrown , so that it was not, as the Pres-  
ident supposes, owing to the want ofadesire of  
adjusting amicably, that this business was not con-  
cluded ; but rather fromthe nature of the propo-  
sals, which were in themsejves inadmissible. The  
paragraph continues—‘* While the right is unsettied,  
we have avoided to change the state of things, by  
taking new posts, or stiengthening ourselves in  
the disputed territories, in the hope that the other  
power would not, by a contrary conduct, oblige us  
to meet their example, and erdanger conflicts  
of authority, the issue. of which may not  
easily be centrouled; but in this hope we have  
now reason to lessen our confidence.” Intruth,  
I cannot comprehend what the president can call  
unsestied right ; and still less, if he wishes to apply  
it tothat part of West Florida comprehended with-  
in the Missisippi, Iberville, the lakes and the riv-  
er Perdido —The right of this territory cannot be  
considered as unsettled or doubtful; for indepen-  
dent of that right arising from actual possession  
and from the treaty of retrocession of Louisiana to  
France, there is another conclusive circumstance,  
well known tothe American government, which  
ought and must dissipate every doubt, if any could  
ever exist on this subject. The most distinguish-  
ed civilians agree, that the true interpreters of a  
treaty dovbiful in any of its clauses orexpressions are  
the contracting parties, hemselves when this can beob-  
tained. Spain and France, who were the contract-  
ing parties inthe treaty of retrocession, on which  
is founded that of sale, of the 30th of April, from  
whence the pretensions of the American gov-  
ernment emanate, have explained it in the manner  
already known to you, sir ; namely, that it was not  
the intention of Spain to cece to France more than  
she had received from her, as the title and word  
retrocession made use of therein, clearly imply;

paragraph from VaTTEL among many other sim ar  
ones which lL could produce from other civilians,  
in support ofthe rights of the king my master,  
on this subject. In paragraph 174 of fh, inter-  
pretation of Treaties, Vattel says....¢ When we  
manifestly see what is the sense that agrees with the  
intention of the contracting powers, it 18 Not permitted  
to turn the words to a contrary meaning. The  
intention sufficiently known furnishes the true matter  
of the convention, of what is promised and accepted,  
demanded and granted. To violate the treaty, is to go  
contrary to the intention sufficiently manifested, rather  
than against the terms in which it ts concerved 3s for  
the terms are nothing without the intentions through-  
out to dictate them.”’ According to this, the position  
taken by the president, in the said paragraph of his  
message, that theright (no doubt alluding to the ter-  
ritorial right) was doubtful or unsettled 1s inadmissible,  
®- of course all the inductions &amp; consequences he draws  
trom this supposition, fall completely to the ground.  
Besides, whatever alteration or change might have  
taken place in the territories of his Catholic Majesty  
could never have been as Ihave had the honor to  
inform you, sir, but the effects of a new plan of  
frontiers, which the retrocession of Louisianawould  
of course render necessary ; or else it might pro-  
ceed from the cireumstance of Spain’s being enga-  
ged in a war with England ; but never witha view  
to disturb. the peace and good understandmg be-  
twixt Spain and the United States.  
  
The president continues saying, ‘ inroads have  
recently been made into theterritories of Orleans  
and the Mississippi; ourcitizens have been seized  
and their property plundered in the very parts of the  
former, which had been actually delivered up by  
Spain, and this by the regular ojfficers and soldiers  
of that government,”  
  
Although Ihave not on this subject more infor-  
mation than that received through the American  
news papers, whose accounts cannot be supposed  
very impartial, nevertheless supposing them correct  
intheir extent, from those I have read itis neither  
proved nor do Ithink it possible to believe, that the  
officers and soldiers of the king,my master, have cros-  
sed the American line, to commit within the juris-  
diction of the United States, the pretended insults.  
The first example of these inroads was given by sever-  
al American citizens,who,in August 1804, penetrated  
through the territory of Baton Rouge,and aidedby the  
brother Kempers,and other malcontents of the Span-  
ish side made an atterapt to surprize and render them-  
selves masters ef the fortof Baton Rouge, and actu-  
ally arrested some magistrates and ether persons of  
note. On this subject I had the honor sf spanking  
and writing to you, sir, in due time, but Iam hith-  
erto without the least answer. If the seizing of 4-  
merican citizens (‘* our citizens bave deen seized” )  
has any reference to the arrest of the Kempers, [  
mustin the first place declare, that according to  
my late information these Kempers are not Ameri-  
can Citizens, because when they settled themselves  
in the Spanish territory, they became subjects of the  
king, and of course had lost their rights as Ameri-  
can citizens ; and in the second, thatthe arrest of  
these persons according to a letter from Natches,  
of the 8th October last, published im the United  
States Gazette, of Philadelphia, was effected by  
negroes, mulattoes and Americar citizens, who, no  
doubt, expected some recompense, delivered them  
within the Spanish lines, from whence it appears  
some Spanish soldiers took charge of to conduct  
them to Baton Rouge. It is true that it has also  
been said, that a part of a company of cavalry, com-  
manded bya certain captain Jones, had entered a-  
nother part of the line and had conducted them-  
selves ina violent and improper manner, towards  
two families ; but should this account be true, I can  
assure you, sir, that the government of the Uni-  
ted States shall receive due satisfaction from Spain,  
the reputation of whose government is too well es-  
tablished, to believe it can inany manner be privy  
to, or approve of acts, as far beneath its character  
as they are useless in their effects. Incidents of this  
mature often happen on the frontiers of every coun-  
try, and they only deserve attention when they re-  
Ceive the sanction of the goverment of the agzgres-  
  
pe or whien in such cases, due satisfaction is refu-  
8 .  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
I have gone over step by step, the articleof the  
president’s message which relates to Spain, and  
have endeavored topresent with candor and truth,  
although in a cursory manner, whatever may give  
correct ideas on its nature and tendency

Iberville, the lakes, and the river  
Perdido. The right of this territo­  
ry cannot be conferred as unfettled  
or doubtful ; for independent of that  
right arifing from actual pofleflbn  
and from the treaty of rctiocefiion of  
Louiliana to France, here is another  
conclulive circumftancc, well known  
to the American government, w hich  
ought and mult dillipatc every doubt,  
if any could exifl on this iubjeft.  
I he molt diltinguifhed civilians a­  
gree, that the true interpreters of a  
treaty, doubtful in any of its claufet  
or cxprellions, are the contra&lt;fting  
parties themselves, when this can be  
obtained. Spain and France, who  
were the contracting parties in the  
treaty of rctrocefiion, on which is  
founded that of faie, of the 30th of  
April, from whence the pretentions  
of the American government emin­  
ate, have explained it in the manner  
already known to you, fir .*—namely,  
that it was not the intention of Spam  
to cede to France mere than Ibe had  
received from her, as the title and  
w°rd rctrocefiion made ufe of there  
in clearly imply,- and that France  
never would have pretended or ho­  
ped to obtain one inch of land call of  
the Mifiifippi, Iberville and the  
Lakes. &#x27;I he true intention of the  
contracting parties being thus cx­  
prefsly, manifested, i fhali coment  
n.ykdr by copying a (ingle paragraph  
from V attcl, among fa any other fim­  
ilar ones which I could produce fr*#rn  
  
otTcr civi.ians, in fupport of the  
rights of the kin,;, my mailer, or  
this fibjeft. In paragraph 274 of  
“ the*interpretation of treaties,” Vat­  
tel fays—“ when we maniielily fee  
u hat is [he fenl&#x27;e that agrees with  
the intention of the contracting pow­  
ers, it is not permitted to turn their  
words to a contrary meaning. The  
intention fufliciently known furnithes  
the true matter of the convention, of  
what is promifed and accepted, de­  
manded ana granted. To violate  
the treaty, is to go contrary to the  
intention fulliciemly manifelkd,  
rather than againft the terms in  
which it is conceived ; for the terms  
are nothing without the intentions  
throughout to di£b.te them.” Ac­  
cording to this, the pomion taken  
by the prefident, in the fcud para­  
graph of his medage, that the right  
(no doubt alluding to the territorial  
right) was doubtful or unfcttled, is  
inadnitlidle, and of courfe *11 the in­  
ductions and cor.fequences he draws  
fr.*m this fuppofition, fail complete­  
ly to the ground. ”elides, whatev­
