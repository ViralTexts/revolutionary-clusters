tion, &amp; in the first transport of disappointed hope—Every body  
Sir, who reasons, will acknowledge the advantages which we have derived from the French  
Fleet, &amp; the Zeal of the Commander of it, but in a free, &amp; republican  
Government, you cannot restrain the voice of the multitude—every Man will speak as he  
thinks, or more properly without thinking—consequently will judge of Effects without  
attending to the Causes. The censures which have been levelled at the Officers of the  
French Fleet, would, more than probable, have fallen in a much higher degree upon a  
Fleet of our own (if we had had one) in the same situation—It is the Nature of Man to be  
displeased with every thing that disappoints a favourite hope, or flattering project;  
and it is the folly of too many of them, to condemn without investigating circumstances.  
Let me beseech you therefore my good Sir to afford a healing hand to the wound that,  
unintentially, has been made. America esteems your Virtues &amp; yr Services—and  
admires the principles upon which you act. Your Countrymen, in our Army, look up to you  
as their Patron. The Count and his Officers consider you as a man high in Rank,  
&amp; high in estimation, here and in France; and I, your friend, have no doubt but  
that you will use your utmost endeavours to restore harmony that the honour, glory, and  
mutual Interest of the two Nation’s may be promoted and cemented in the firmest manner.  
I would add mo⟨re⟩ on the subject, but am restrained for want of time &amp;

“Let me beseech you to afford a healing hand  
to the wound that has been unintentionally made.  
America esteems your virtues and your services,  
and admires the principles on which you act.  
Your countrymen in our army look up to you as  
their pattern. The count and his officers consider  
you as a man high in rank, and high in estima-  
tion here, and also in France, and I, your friend,  
have no doubt but you will use your utmost en-  
deavors to restore harmony, that the honor,  
glory, and mutual interest of the two nations may  
be promoted and cemented in the firmest man-

to action than the wishes of Washington, and  
put forth unwearied efforts till harmony was re-  
stored.
