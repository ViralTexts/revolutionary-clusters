Dear Harriet  
Quincy Feb’ry 8th 1815  
  
Your Theological queries, you must consult with your Learned minister. I am not able to solve them. there is certainly a difference in the two tables, in the new Testament. I do not recollect but one reference to the ten Commandments That is in the tenth chapter of Luke, when the Lawyer consulted our Saviour, asking what he Should do to Inherit Eternal Life verse 26 &amp; 27 &amp; 28th He said unto him what is written in the Law? how readest Thou? and he answering said, Thou shalt Love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart, with all thy Soul and with all thy Strength &amp; with all thy mind, and thy Neighbour as thy Self.— And he said unto him, thou hast answered right. this do and thou Shalt Live. Then follows that beautifull explanation of who is thy Neighbour. This I call true Religion the love of God, and our Neighbour, in the enlarged sence of our Saviour, not confined to Country Nation or party,  altho as pope expresses it, “Friend, Country first, and then all humane Race”

ing to the lawyer who tempted him, “ thou  
hast answered right; this do, and thou shalt

fect in the love of God andhis neighbor. And  
it is worthy of notice, that this very passage  
from the law is quoted by Paul and placed in  
opposition to the righteousness of faith. It  
reads thus, “but that no man is justified by  
the law in the sight of God is evident: for, the

It was no doubt, in one sense, a healthy condition of mind which  
Christ required of the lawyer who asked what he should do to inherit  
eternal life; but the health of the soul is something more than “a cer-  
tain enthusiasm of love for human beings as such.” When Christ asked  
the lawyer, “ What is written in the Law?” his answer was, “Thou shalt  
love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and  
with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbor as thy-  
self.” And Christ then said to him, “ Thou hast answered right: this  
do and thou shalt live.” The enthusiasm of humanity is hardly a sufli-  
ciently ample phrase to embrace the first of the two commandments on  
which hang all the Law and the Prophets.
