]  
In order to give color to a right in the Executive to exercise the Legislative power of judging whether there be a cause of war in a public stipulation—two other arguments are subjoined by the writer to that last examined.  
  
The first is simply this, “It is the right and duty of the Executive to judge of and interpret those articles of our treaties which give to France particular privileges, in order to the enforcement of those privileges,” from which it is stated as a necessary consequence, that the Executive has certain other rights, among which is the right in question.  
This argument is answered by a very obvious distinction. The first right is essential to the execution of the treaty as a law in operation, and interferes with no right invested in another Department. The second is not essential to the execution of the treaty or any other law; on the contrary the article to which the right is applied, cannot as has been shewn, from the very nature of it be in operation as a law without a previous declaration of the Legislature; and all the laws to be enforced by the Executive remain in the mean time precisely the same, whatever be the disposition or judgment of the Executive. This second right would also interfere with a right acknowledged to be in the Legislative Department.  
If nothing else could suggest this distinction to the writer, he ought to have been reminded of it by his own words “in order to the enforcement of those privileges”—was it in order to the enforcement of the article of guaranty, that the right is ascribed to the Executive?  
The other of the two arguments reduces itself into the following form: The Executive has the right to receive public Ministers; this right includes the right of deciding, in the case of a revolution, whether the new government sending the Minister, ought to be recognized or not; and this again, the right to give or refuse operation to pre-existing treaties.  
The power of the Legislature to declare war and judge of the causes for declaring it, is one of the most express and explicit parts of the Constitution. To endeavor to abridge or effect it by strained inferences, and by hypothetical or singular occurrences, naturally warns the reader of some lurking fallacy.  
The words of the Constitution are “he (the President) shall receive Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls.” I shall not undertake to examine what would be the precise extent and effect of this function in various cases which fancy may suggest, or which time may produce. It will be more proper to observe in general, and every candid reader will second the observation, that little if any thing more was intended by the clause, than to provide for a particular mode of communication, almost grown into a right among modern nations; by pointing out the department of the government, most proper for the ceremony of admitting public Ministers, of examining their credentials, and of authenticating their title to the privileges annexed to their character by the law of nations. This being the apparent design of the Constitution, it would be highly improper to magnify the function into an important prerogative, even where no rights of other departments could be affected by it.  
To shew that the view here given of the clause is not a new construction, invented or strained for a particular occasion—I will take the liberty of recurring to the cotemporary work already quoted, which contains the obvious and original gloss put on this part of the Constitution by its friends and advocates.  
“The President is also to be authorised to receive Ambassadors and other public Ministers. This, though it has been a rich theme of declamation, is more a matter of dignity than of authority. It is a circumstance, that will be without consequence in the administration of the government, and it is far more convenient that it should be arranged in this manner, than that there should be a necessity for convening the Legislature or one of its branches upon every arrival of a foreign Minister, though it were merely to take the place of a departed predecessor.” Fed. vol. II. p. 237.  
Had it been foretold in the year 1788 when this work was published, that before the end of the year 1793, a writer, assuming the merit of being a friend to the Constitution, would appear, and gravely maintain, that this function, which was to be without consequence in the administration of the government, might have the consequence of deciding on the validity of revolutions in favor of liberty, “of putting the United States in a condition to become an associate in war,” nay “of laying the Legislature under an obligation of declaring war,” what would have been thought and said of so visionary a prophet?  
The moderate opponents of the Constitution would probably have disowned his extravagance. By the advocates of the Constitution, his prediction must have been treated as “an experiment on public credulity, dictated either by a deliberate intention to deceive, or by the overflowings of a zeal too intemperate to be ingenuous.”  
But how does it follow from the function to receive Ambassadors and other public Ministers that so consequential a prerogative may be exercised by the Executive? When a foreign Minister presents himself, two questions immediately arise: Are his credentials from the existing and acting government of his country? Are they properly authenticated? These questions belong of necessity to the Executive; but they involve no cognizance of the question, whether those exercising the government have the right along with the possession. This belongs to the nation, and to the nation alone, on whom the government operates. The questions before the Executive are merely questions of fact; and the Executive would have precisely the same right, or rather be under the same necessity of deciding them, if its function was simply to receive without any discretion to reject public Ministers. It is evident, therefore, that if the Executive has a right to reject a public Minister it must be founded on some other consideration than a change in the government or the newness of the government; and consequently a right to refuse to acknowledge a new government cannot be implied by the right to refuse a public Minister.  
It is not denied that there may be cases in which a respect to the general principles of liberty, the essential rights of the people, or the overruling sentiments of humanity, might require a government, whether new or old, to be treated as an illegitimate despotism. Such are in fact discussed and admitted by the most approved authorities. But they are great and extraordinary cases, by no means submitted to so limited an organ of the national will as the Executive of the United States; and certainly not to be brought, by any torture of words, within the right to receive Ambassadors.  
That the authority of the Executive does not extend to question, whether an existing government ought to be recognized or not, will still more clearly appear from an examination of the next inference of the writer, to wit, that the Executive has a right to give or refuse activity and operation to pre-existing treaties.  
If there be a principle that ought not to be questioned within the United States, it is, that every nation has a right to abolish an old government and establish a new one. This principle is not only recorded in every public archive, written in every American heart, and sealed with the blood of a host of American martyrs; but is the only lawful tenure by which the United States hold their existence as a nation.  
It is a principle incorporated with the above, that governments are established for the national good and are organs of the national will.  
From these two principles results a third, that treaties formed by the government, are treaties of the nation, unless otherwise expressed in the treaties.  
Another consequence is that a nation, by exercising the right of changing the organ of its will, can neither disengage itself from the obligations, nor forfeit the benefits of its treaties. This is a truth of vast importance, and happily rests with sufficient firmness on its own authority. To silence or prevent cavil, I insert however, the following extracts:  
“Since then such a treaty (a treaty not personal to the sovereign) directly relates to the body of the State, it subsists though the form of the republic happens to be changed, and though it should be even transformed into a monarchy—For the State and the nation are always the same whatever changes are made in the form of the government—and the treaty concluded with the nation, remains in force as long as the nation exists.” Vattel, B. II. § 185.  
“It follows that as a treaty, notwithstanding the change of a democratic government into a monarchy, continues in force with the new King, in like manner; if a monarchy becomes a republic, the treaty made with the King does not expire on that account, unless it was manifestly personal.” Burlam. part IV, c. IX, § 16. ¶ 6.  
As a change of government then makes no change in the obligations or rights of the party to a treaty, it is clear that the Executive can have no more right to suspend or prevent the operation of a treaty, on account of the change, than to suspend or prevent the operation, where no such change has happened. Nor can it have any more right to suspend the operation of a treaty in force as a law, than to suspend the operation of any other law.  
The logic employed by the writer on this occasion, will be best understood by accommodating to it the language of a proclamation, founded on the prerogative and policy of suspending the treaty with France.  
Whereas a treaty was concluded on the  day of  between the United States and the French nation, through the kingly government, which was then the organ of its will: And whereas the said nation hath since exercised its right (no wise abridged by the said treaty) of changing the organ of its will, by abolishing the said kingly government, as inconsistent with the rights and happiness of the people, and establishing a republican in lieu thereof, as most favorable to the public happiness, and best suited to the genius of a people become sensible of their rights and ashamed of their chains: And whereas, by the constitution of the United States, the executive is authorised to receive ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls: And whereas a public minister, duly appointed and commissioned by the new Republic of France, hath arrived and presented himself to the executive, in order to be received in his proper character: Now be it known, that by virtue of the said right vested in the executive to receive ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, &amp; of the rights included therein, the executive hath refused to receive the said minister from the said republic, and hath thereby caused the activity and operation of all treaties with the French nation, hitherto in force as supreme laws of the land, to be suspended until the executive, by taking off the said suspension, shall revive the same; of which, all persons concerned are to take notice, at their peril.  
The writer, as if beginning to feel that he was grasping at more than he could hold, endeavours, all of a sudden, to squeeze his doctrine into a smaller size, and a less vulnerable shape. The reader shall see the operation in his own words.  
“And where a treaty antecedently exists between the United States and such nation (a nation whose government has undergone a revolution) that right (the right of judging whether the new rulers ought to be recognized or not) involves the power of giving operation or not to such treaty. For until the new government is acknowledged, the treaties between the nations, as far at least as regards public rights, are of course suspended.”  
This qualification of the suspending power, though reluctantly and inexplicitly made, was prudent, for two reasons; first, because it is pretty evident that private rights, whether of judiciary or executive cognizance, may be carried into effect without the agency of the foreign government; and therefore would not be suspended of course by a rejection of that agency. Secondly, because the judiciary, being an independent department, and acting under an oath to pursue the law of treaties as the supreme law of the land, might not readily follow the executive example, and a right in one expositor of treaties, to consider them as not in force, whilst it would be the duty of another expositor to consider them as in force, would be a phænomenon not so easy to be explained. Indeed as the doctrine stands qualified, it leaves the executive the right of suspending the law of treaties in relation to rights of one description, without exempting it from the duty of enforcing it in relation to rights of another description.  
But the writer is embarked in so unsound an argument, that he does not save the rest of his inference by this sacrifice of one half of it. It is not true, that all public rights are of course suspended by a refusal to acknowledge the government, or even by a suspension of the government. And in the next place, the right in question does not follow from the necessary suspension of public rights, in consequence of a refusal to acknowledge the government.  
Public rights are of two sorts; those which require the agency of government; those which may be carried into effect without that agency.  
As public rights are the rights of the nation, not of the government, it is clear that wherever they can be made good to the nation, without the office of government, they are not suspended by the want of an acknowledged government, or even by the want of an existing government; and that there are important rights of this description, will be illustrated by the following case:  
Suppose, that after the conclusion of the treaty of alliance between the United States and France, a party of the enemy had surprised and put to death every member of congress; that the occasion had been used by the people of America for changing the old confederacy into such a government as now exists, and that in the progress of this revolution, an interregnum had happened. Suppose further, that during this interval, the states of South-Carolina and Georgia, or any other parts of the United States, had been attacked and been put into evident and imminent danger of being irrecoverably lost, without the interposition of the French arms; is it not manifest, that as the Treaty is the Treaty of the United States, not of their government, the people of the United States could not forfeit their right to the guarantee of their territory by the accidental suspension of their government; and that any attempt, on the part of France, to evade the obligations of the Treaty, by pleading the suspension of government, or by refusing to acknowledge it, would justly have been received with universal indignation, as an ignominious perfidy?  
With respect to public rights that cannot take effect in favour of a nation without the agency of its government, it is admitted that they are suspended of course where there is no government in existence, and also by a refusal to acknowledge an existing government. But no inference in favour of a right to suspend the operation of Treaties, can be drawn from either case. Where the existence of the government is suspended, it is a case of necessity; it would be a case happening without the act of the executive, and consequently could prove nothing for or against the right.  
In the other case, to wit, of a refusal by the executive to recognize an existing government, however certain it may be, that a suspension of some of the public rights might ensue, yet it is equally certain, that the refusal would be without right or authority; and that no right or authority could be implied or produced by the unauthorised act. If a right to do whatever might bear an analogy to the necessary consequence of what was done without right, could be inferred from the analogy, there would be no other limit to power than the limit to its ingenuity.  
It is no answer to say that it may be doubtful whether a government does or does not exist; or doubtful which may be the existing and acting Government. The case stated by the writer is, that there are existing rulers; that there is an acting Government; but that they are new rulers; and that it is a new Government. The full reply, however, is to repeat what has been already observed; that questions of this sort are mere questions of fact; that as such only, they belong to the executive; that they would equally belong to the executive, if it was tied down to the reception of public ministers, without any discretion to receive or reject them; that where the fact appears to be, that no Government exists, the consequential suspension is independent of the executive; that where the fact appears to be, that the Government does exist, the executive must be governed by the fact, and can have no right or discretion, on account of the date or form of the Government, to refuse to acknowledge it, either by rejecting its public minister, or by any other step taken on that account. If it does refuse on that account, the refusal is a wrongful act, and can neither prove nor illustrate a rightful power.  
I have spent more time on this part of the discussion than may appear to some, to have been requisite. But it was considered as a proper opportunity for presenting some important ideas, connected with the general subject, and it may be of use in shewing how very superficially, as well as erroneously, the writer has treated it.  
In other respects so particular an investigation was less necessary. For allowing it to be, as contended, that a suspension of treaties might happen from a consequential operation of a right to receive public ministers, which is an express right vested by the constitution; it could be no proof, that the same or a similar effect could be produced by the direct operation of a constructive power.  
Hence the embarrassments and gross contradictions of the writer in defining, and applying his ultimate inference from the operation of the executive power with regard to public ministers.  
At first it exhibits an “important instance of the right of the executive to decide the obligation of the nation with regard to foreign nations.”  
Rising from that, it confers on the executive, a right “to put the United States in a condition to become an associate in war.”  
And, at its full height authorises the executive “to lay the legislature under an obligation of declaring war.”  
From this towering prerogative, it suddenly brings down the executive to the right of “consequentially affecting the proper or improper exercise of the power of the legislature to declare war.”  
And then, by a caprice as unexpected as it is sudden, it espouses the cause of the legislature; rescues it from the executive right “to lay it under an obligation of declaring war”; and asserts it to be “free to perform its own duties, according to its own sense of them,” without any other controul than what it is liable to, in every other legislative act.  
The point at which it finally seems to rest, is, that “the executive in the exercise of its constitutional powers, may establish an antecedent state of things, which ought to weigh in the legislative decisions”; a prerogative which will import a great deal, or nothing, according to the handle by which you take it; and which, at the same time, you can take by no handle that does not clash with some inference preceding.  
If “by weighing in the legislative decisions” be meant having an influence on the expediency of this or that decision in the opinion of the legislature; this is no more than what every antecedent state of things ought to have, from whatever cause proceeding; whether from the use or abuse of constitutional powers, or from the exercise of constitutional or assumed powers. In this sense the power to establish an antecedent state of things is not constituted. But then it is of no use to the writer, and is also in direct contradiction to the inference, that the executive may “lay the legislature under an obligation to decide in favor of war.”  
If the meaning be as is implied by the force of the terms “constitutional powers” that the antecedent state of things produced by the executive, ought to have a constitutional weight with the legislature: or, in plainer words, imposes a constitutional obligation on the legislative decisions, the writer will not only have to combat the arguments by which such a prerogative has been disproved: but to reconcile it with his last concession, that “the legislature is free to perform its duties according to its own sense of them.” He must shew that the legislature is, at the same time, constitutionally free to pursue its own judgment and constitutionally bound by the judgment of the executive.

that the right is alcsibed to the Executive ?  
The other of the two arguments i educes, it­  
felf into the flowing form : The Executive  
h:ts the right to receive public Ministers; this  
right includes the right of deciding, j.| the

cases which-famy may suggest, or which time  
may produce. It will be more proper to ob­

being the apparent design of the Conilitution,  
it would be highly improper to magnify the  
function into an important prerogative, even  
where no rights of otbsr departments could  
be affecfted by it.  
  
To (hew that the view here given of the  
clause is not a new conitru&lt;stion, invented or  
(trained for a particular occaiiou—l will take  
the liberty of recurring to the coteniporary  
work already quoted, which contains the ob­  
vious and original gloss put on this part of the  
Constitution by its friends ant! advocates.  
  
4&lt; The President is also to be authorised to  
receive Arnbafladors and other public Minif­  
te•«. This, though it has bien a rich theme  
of declamation, is more a matter of   
than of authority. It is a circninflance, that  
will be without confcqup.cc in the adminidratiou  
of the government, and it is far more con­  
venient that it (hould be arranged in this  
manner, than that there (hould be a necefliry

right to rcfu&#x27;e to acknowledge a

It is not denied that there may be cares in

Such are in facl cii&#x27;culled and admitted by the

great aj.d extraordinary cases, by no means

That the authority of the Executive doe?  
not extend to question. whether an exilting

w 11 it ill more clearly appeal from an ex nti­

refine a&amp;ivity and operation to pre-jgxiftirig

If the e be a principle that not to I-e

that every nation has a right to aboliih an old  
government and eftabliJh a new one. This  
principle is not ojijy recorded in every public

and scaled with the blood of a host of Ame­  
rican inarrvrs ; but is the only lawful tej;uie  
by which the United States hold tlieir exiit­

It is a principle incorporated with t!-&gt;e

From these two principles results a third,  
that featies formed by tfcic government, a*, e  
treaties of the nation, unleis otherwiie ex­  
prefied i.rf the treaties.  
  
Another roiifeqijenee is that a nation, by  
the right of changing the organ of  
its will, can neither disengage it ft If front the  
obligations, not forfeit the benefits of ifs  
treaties. This is a truth of vast importance,  
and happily reus with fuftice.it firir.r.els on  
its own authority. To silence or prevent ca­  
vil, I insert however, the following extracts ;  
4% Since then iuch a treaty (a treary not per­  
-44 fonal to the fovereig&quot;) directly Teiates to  
44 the body of the State, it fiibfntjs though the  
44 form of the republic happens to be changed,  
44 and though it fliould even transformed  
44 into a monarchy-—For the State aid th«  
44 nation are always the fame whatever r.-han­  
-4&lt; ges are made in the t&#x27;oriu of the govern­  
-44 ment—and the treaty concluded with tie  
44 nation, remains in force as long as the  
t4 nation exists.&quot; Vattel, B. 11. § 185 —  
44 It follows that as a treaty, in twithftand­  
-44 ing t!ie change of a democratic govern­  
-44 ment into a monarchy, continues in force  
44 with the new King, in like manner ; it a  
44 monarchy becomes a republic, the treaty  
44 made with the King does not expire on  
44 that accou.it, un&#x27;efs it was manifeftly per­  
-44 fonal.&quot; Uurlam. part IV, c. IX, § 16,   
  
A; a change of government then makes no  
change in rhe obligations or rights of the  
party to a treaty, it is clcar that the Execu­  
tive can have i&gt;o more right to fpfpend or  
prevent tiie operation of a tieaty, on ;.ccount  
of the change. than to suspend or prevent the  
operation, where no such change has happen­  
ed. Nor can it have any more right to sus­  
pend the operation of a treaty in foice an a  
law, than to suspend the operation of aay  
other law. /To be continued.

rpHE logic employed T&gt;y the writeV oil this  
pccafton, will b* best underflot d by accom­  
modating to it the language of * proclamation,  
founded on the prerogative and-pokey of fuf*  
pemding the treaty with France.  
Whereas a treaty was concluded on the  
day of between the United&#x27; States and the  
Ffench nation, through the kingly government,  
whlclf then the organ will: And  
whereat the said nation hath since exercised its  
right (no wife abridged by the said treaty) of  
changing the organ of it* will, by abnlifhing the  
■ said kingly government, as inconflflent with  
the rights and happinef- of the people., and efta­  
blifhinga republican in lieu thereof, as most fa­  
vorable to the public happihefs, and best suited  
to the genius of a people become sensible of  
their rights and alhamed of their chains: And  
whereas,by the conftitncion of th United States,  
the executive is authorised to receive ambafla­  
dor#, other public mwifters and consuls: And  
whereas a public minister, dujy appointed and  
commiflioned by the new Republic of France,  
• hath arrived and prefeotcd himfelf to the execu­  
tive, in order to lie received in his proper cha­  
ra&lt;fter: Now be it known,&#x27;that by virtue of the  
said right veftbd irt the executive to receive am­  
bafiadors, other public minillers and consuls, &amp;  
of the rights included therein, the executive hath  
refufed to receive the said minister from the said  
republic, and hath thereby caused the a&amp;ivity  
and operation of all treaties with the French na­  
tion, hitherto in ferce &#x27;as fuprerne laius of {he  
landy to be lufprnded until the -executive, by  
taking off the said fufpeniion, ftiMi revive she  
feme; o£-which, all perfom concerned are to  
take n tke, ta theif &quot;irt rbi&lt;&#x27;v/ j ti  
  
The writer, as if beginning to feel that he  
was grasping at more than he could hold, endea­  
vour?, all of a fudden,to squeeze his doctrine in­  
to a Tmaller and a less vulnerab&#x27;e shape.—»  
The reader shall fee the operation in his own  
words.  
  
u And where a treaty antecedently exists  
between the United States and such nation (a  
nation whose government has undergone a revo­  
lution) that right (the right of judging whe­  
ther the new rulers ought to be recognized or  
not) involves the power of giving operation or  
not to such treaty. For until the new govern­  
ment is acknowledged, the treaties between the  
nations, ai fur at leojl as regards public rights %  
are of tourfe suspended.&quot;  
This qualification of the suspending power,  
though relu&amp;antly and inexplicitly made, was  
prudent, for two reasons; firft, because it is  
pretty evident that fri*ate rights, whether of  
judiciary or executive cognizance, may be carri­  
ed into effu&amp; without the agency of the foreign  
government; and therefore would not be fufj  
  
pended of course by a rejr&amp;ion of that agency.  
Secondly, because the judiciunj, being an inde­  
pendent department, and a6Hqg under an oath  
to purfne the law of treaties as the supreme law  
of the laad, might not readily follow the execu­  
tive example, and a right in one expositor of trea­  
ties, to consider them as not-in force, whilst it  
would be the duty of another expositor to confkief  
them as in forcey would be a phenomenon not  
so easy to be explained. Indeed as the do&amp;rine  
  
(lands qualified, it leaves the executive the right  
of fnfpcnding the law of treaties in relation to  
fights of one description, without exempting it  
from the duty of enforcing it in relation to rights  
oranother description.  
t But the writer is embarked in so unfnundan  
argument, that he tfoes not save the reft ps his  
  
inference by this facrifice of. one half of it. It  
is fiot trite, that all public rights .are of courie  
  
suspended by a refufal to acknowledge the, go­  
vernment, or even by a fufpenfioji.of the govern­  
ment. And in the next pUce, the right in  
question does not follow flf.m the neceflary sus­  
pension of public rights, in canfequence of a rer  
suss.l to acknowledge the government.  
Public rights are of two forts; those whiclj  
require the .igency of governments,thofe wlucfc  
may be carried into efjeel without that ag?nc1/,  
. As public rights are the rights of the nation.  
  
not of the government, it is clear that wherever  
they can be made good to the nation, without  
the oflicp of government, they arc not suspend­  
ed by the want of an acknowledged govern­  
ment, or even by the want of an existing go»  
vernment; and that there are-important rights  
of this description, will be illustrated by the  
following cafe:  
Suppose, that after the conchifion of the trea­  
ty of alliance between the United States and  
France, a party of the enemy had surprised and  
put to death every member ofcongrel&#x27;s; that  
the octafion had been used by the people of A­  
• merica for changing the old confederacy into  
such a government as now exi(ls„ and that in  
  
the progrefsof this revolution, an interregnum  
had happened. Suppose further, that during  
this interval, the dates of South-Carolina and  
—- Georgia, or any other parts of the United States,  
hid been attacked,and been put into evident and  
imminent danger of being irrecoverably loft,  
without rhe interpoficion of the French arms; is  
it not manifcfl, that a« the Treaty is the Treaty  
of the United States, not of their government,  
the people of the United States could not forfeit  
their right to the guarantee of their territory  
by the accidental fufjieiifion of their govern­  
ment; and that any attempt, on the part df  
France, to evade the obligations if the Treaty,  
by pleading the suspension of government, or by  
refufmg to acknowledge it, would justly have  
been received with universal indignation, as an  
ignominious perfidy ?  
With refpeA to public rights that cannot take  
rfTrc} in favour of a nation without the agency  
of its government, it is admitted that they are  
fiifpended of course whfie there is no govern­  
  
mem e*iAeftet, an.! a rffufal to re-  
mtt &lt;XiHmj» giovernriJert.&#x27; Sut uo  
in favour to Intend the ope­  
ujatiftn of lyrc&amp;ies, can either  
■ale. }Vhcre exiftenjre of the government  
isfufpentledv it m a hsCestf neCciSiy would  
be a cai&#x27;r happening withau? the a&amp; of tke «*c-  
C*tive, and eonfequcrttly could prove nothing  
for or&quot;againfl. the right.  
In the o&#x27;ther cafe, to wit, of &quot;a refufal by the  
. executive t* recognise an cxijliug government,  
- however cetcain it maybe,-tnat a Cuipenfion of  
some of the public rights might epfue, yet,it is  
equally certain, that the tefuW would be with­  
out right or authority; and that or  
authority could be implicd*or prptf £he  
unauthorised a&lt;st. If a right to da lfr»ateyer  
might bear an analogy to the necessary conle- i  
quence of what was done without right, could  
be inferred from the analogy, there, would be  
no other iimit to power than the limit tQ its in­  
genuity.  
Tt is no answer to fay that it may be doubtful  
whether a government do&lt;? or does noyt exilt;  
or doubtful which may be the existing and a&lt;s­  
- Government. The cafe stated by the wri­  
ter i», that there are existing rulers; that there  
i an acting Government ;..but that they are new  
rulers; and that it is a new Government. The  
full reply, however, is to repeat what has been  
already oljferved ; that flueftiows of thi&amp; fort are  
mere questions of f.i&amp;j us such only, they  
belong to the executive ; that they would equal­  
ly btiong the executive*. if it was tieddown to  
the rtception of public ministers, without any  
diferetion to receive or reje&amp; them; that where  
the fail appears to be, that no government ex­  
lfts, the confeqnenrial suspension is independent  
of the executive; that where the fa&lt;st appears to  
be, that the Government doesexift, the execu­  
tive nitdl be governed by die fa&amp;, a*d can have  
no right or difcrecion, on account of the date  
or form of oho Guven*£?te;?fc, •&quot;&gt; p-Tuft so ac-  
either by reje&lt;shng ltfcpfific mi­  
nister,. or by any other step taken &lt;*n that ac­  
count. If it does icfufe on that account* the  
refufal is a wrongful a&lt;ft, and can neither prove  
nor illustrate a rightful power.  
I have spent more time on this part of the  
difcufiion than may apsear to some, to have  
been requisite. But it was considered as a pro­  
per opportunity for presenting some important  
ideas, conne&amp;ed with the general jArtajeA, and  
it may be of life in (hewing how very fuperfi­  
cially, as well as erroneously, the writer has  
treated it.  
  
In other refpeilsfo particular aninvefligati­  
on was iefs necessary. &quot;For allowing it to be, as  
contended, that a fufperifion of treaties might  
happen from a consequential operation of a right  
to receive public minifrcts, which its ail express  
right veftcd by the constitution &lt; it could be no  
proof, that the fame or aftmilar effe&lt;sfc cOuld be  
produced by the dirc&amp; operation of a conjiruc­  
five power.  
  
Hence the embarraflfments and grbf? contra­  
dictions of the writer in defining, and applying  
his ultimate inference from the operation of the  
executive power with nrini­  
tlers. \
At firft if exhibits an &quot; important • instance  
of the right of the executive to decide the obli­  
gation of the nation with regard to foreign naf  
tions,&quot; v&gt;  
  
R.ifit)g from that, it confers on the   
a right &quot; to put the United States in a condition  
to become an associate in war.&quot;  
And, at its full authorises the execu­  
tive &quot; to lay the legislature under an obligation  
of declaring war.&quot;  
From this towering prerogative, it suddenly  
brings down the executive to the. right of &quot; con-  
Jfjkrt:ti*iliy ujj\ cling the proper or improper ex­  
ercise of the power of the legislature te declare  
war.  
  
And then, by a caprice as une*pe&amp;ed as it i$  
sudden, it espouses the cause 01 the legislature ;  
rescues it from the executive right &quot; to lay it  
under an obligation of declaring war&quot;; and aftwrts  
it to be &quot;free to perform its own duties, accord­  
ing to its own sense of them,&quot; without any other  
eontrdul tjian what it is liable to,in every other  
legifhtive ail.  
The point at which it reft,is,  
that «&#x27; tlit executive in the exercise of its conjlh  
tutional fo-wc i, may eftabliih an antecedent (late  
of things, which ocght to -weigh in thelegjflative  
dttijions ; a prerogative which will import a  
great deal, or nothing, according to the handle  
by which you take it; and which, at the fame  
time, you can take by no handle that does not  
clalh with some inference preceding.  
If &quot; by weighing in the decisions&quot;  
be meant having an influence on the expediency of  
this or that decision in the opinion of the legisla­  
ture ; this is no more than what every antece­  
dent (late of things ought to have, from whate­  
ver cause proceeding; whether from theufeor  
abuf of conflitutional powers, or from the ex­  
ercise of conflitutional or aflumed powers. In  
this sense the power to eftabliih an antecedent  
(late of things is not constituted. But then it is  
of no use to the writer, and isilfoin dire# con­  
tradiction to the inference, that the executive  
may &quot; lay the legislature under an obligation to  
decide in favor of war.  
If the meaning be as is implied by the force  
of the terms « conflitutional poyv;V&quot; thjt the  
antecedent (late of things the exe­  
cutive, pught to have a coifitutional Height with  
the legislature : or, in plainer words, imposes a  
conjlitutional obligation on the legislative decifwnl,  
the writer will not only have to combat the ar­  
guments l.y which such a prerogative has been  
disproved . but to reconcile it with his lad con­  
ceflion, that &quot;the legislature is free to perfoim  
Its duties according to its own lince of them.&quot;  
He miift (hew that the legislature is, at the  
fame time, conjiitututianally fr:e to purfxe its own  
judgment and conjlitutionally bound hy the iuihment  
of tlx executive. &#x27;

&quot;If,&quot; says Mr. Madison, &quot;there be a principle  
that ought not to be questioned within the  
United States, it is, that every nation has a right to  
abolish an old government and establish a new one.  
This principle is not only recorded in every public  
archive, written in every American heart, and seal­  
ed with the blood of a host of American martyrs;  
but it is the only lawful tenure by which the Unlted  
States hold their existence as a nation.&quot;  
These were the sentiments of young America.  
There is yet enough of the spirit of young America  
extant, to frown at the fogyism that would oblite-­  
rate the precious record from our memories.  
In regard to Cuba, then, grant the rule of inter-­  
national law, &quot;that every government de facto is to  
be taken prima facie as the government of  
the people&#x27;s choice! yet the prim facte eve­  
dence may be rebutted. And where is there  
mendacity bold enough to assert that the power  
which throttles Cuba like a night-mare, is not a  
sheer despotism?  
All law writers admit there may be a naked  
tyranny that has no right of protection or respect  
from the laws of nations. Nor can the tyrant claim  
any legal protection even for his personal security.  
Mr. Hadison says:  
It is not denied that there may be cases in which a  
respect to the general principles of liberty- the essential  
right of the people, or the overruling sentiments of hus­  
manity--might require a Government, whether new or  
old, to be treated as an illegitimate despotism.  
Now, I challenge any one to cite to me a single  
element in the power which crushes Cuba, that ens  
titles that power to be respected as the legitimate  
Government of the people of Cuba. The Cubans,  
then, have good cause to revolt. But this power,  
too, in the wantonness of violence, is now being ex­  
erted to an end dangerous to the interests of our  
Southern citizens. And these, together, make ang­  
mented grounds of our sympathy, and excite many i

&quot;Pacificus&quot; had quoted the clause of the  
Constitution authorizing the President to re­  
ceive Ambassadors. &amp;c., as conferring on him  
the right to decide upon the recognition of  
revolutionary Governments. Madison replied  
that &quot;little, if anything, more was intended by  
the clause than to provide for a particular  
mode of communication, almost grown into a  
right among modern nations, by pointing out  
the department of the Government most  
proper for the ceremony of admitting public  
Ministers, of examining their credentials, and  
of authentica ing their title to the privileges  
annexed to their character by the law of na­  
tions. This being the apparent design of the  
Constitution, it would be highly improper to  
magnify the function into an important pre­  
rogative, even where no rights of other de­  
partments could be affected by it.&quot; In sup­  
port of this view he quoted from an article in  
the Federalist. Written by Hamilton himself,  
on this clause of the Constitution. &quot;The  
President is also to be authorized to receive  
Ambassadors and other public Ministers. This,  
though it has been a rich theme of declama­  
tion, is more a matter of dignity than author­  
ity. It is a circumstance that will be without  
consequence in the administration of the Gov  
ernment, and it is far more convenient that it  
should be arranged in this manner than that  
there should be a necessity for convening the  
legislature or one of its branches upon every  
arrival of a foreign Minister, though it were  
merely to take the place of a predecessor.&quot;  
&quot;Had it been foretold,&quot; says Madison, &quot;In the  
ear 1788, when this work was published, that  
before the end of the year 1793 a writer assum­  
ing the merit of being a friend of the Constitu­  
tion, would appear and gravely maintain that  
this function, which was to be without con-  
sequence in the administration of the Govern­  
ment,&quot; might have the consequence of deciding  
on the validity of revolutions in favorsof lib­  
erty, what would have been thought of so vis­  
ionary a prophet?

Discussing the right of the Executive to de­  
termine the recognition of foreign Governments,  
which had been claimed by Hamilton under  
the clause of the Constitution authorizing the  
President to receive ambassadors, Madison said:  
When a foreign Minister presents himself two ques­  
tions immediately arise: Are his credentials from the  
existing and acting Government of his country? Are  
they properly authenticated? These questions belong  
of necessity to the Executive, but they involve no  
cognizance of the quastion whether those exercising  
the Government have the right along with the pos  
session. &quot; It is not denled that there may be  
cases in which a respect to the general principles of  
liberty, the essential rights of the people, or the over­  
ruling sentiments of humanity might require a Gov.  
ernment, whether new or old, to be treated as an  
illegitimate despotism. Such are in fact discussed  
and admitted by the most approved authorities. But  
they are great and extraordinary cases, by no means  
submitted to so limited an organ of the national will  
as the Executive of the United States, and certainly  
not to be brought by any torture of words within the

the flag of Great Rritain,  
In connection with the subject of receiving  
  
Ambassadors and public Ministers, as the clanse  
of the Constitution in reference thereto is relied  
upon by the advocates of the President&#x27;s prerog  
ative to recognire foreign nations, it may not be  
out of place to quote here what Alexander Ham­  
ilton said as to the proper interpretation of that  
clause, when he was advocating the adoption of  
the Constitution in the &quot;Federalist.&quot; He said:  
The President is also to be authorized to receive  
Ambassadors and other Ministers&quot; Thts, though it  
has been a rich theme of declamation, is tore d mar­  
ter of dignity than urhority. It is a circumstance  
that will be without consequence in the administra­  
tion of the Government, and it is far more conventent  
that it should be arranged in this manner, than that  
there should be a necessity for convening the Legis&#x27;a­  
ture or ons of its branches upon every arrival of a  
foreign Minister, though it were merely to take the

From this it appears that the advocates of  
vesting this function in the President at that  
time thought it a matter more of dignity than  
authority, and based their plea principally upon  
the ground of convenience. They never hinted  
at the latent power afterward discovered. Mr.  
Madison, in his reply to the letters of &quot;Pacie  
ficus,&quot; in which Hamilton asserted this new  
doctrine of Executive prerogative, quoted this  
statement of Hamilton&#x27;s in the &quot;Federalist,&quot;  
and then said:  
Had it been foretold in the yoar 1788, when this  
book (the &quot;Federal st&quot;l was published, that before  
the end of the year 1793 a writer, assuming the norit  
  
of being a friead to the Constitution, would appear  
and gravely maintain that this function which was  
to be without consequenc in the admin stration of  
the Government,&quot; might have the consequence of de­  
eding on the validity of revolutions in favor of  
liberty, of putting the United States in a condition to  
become an asseciate in war, nay, of laying the Legis  
isture under an obligation of declaring war, what  
would have been thought of so visionary a prophet?
