viewed by them as an innocent man, and they have authorized no one to seize or deliver him. The evil of protecting malefactors of every dye is sensibly felt here as in other countries, but until a reformation of the criminal Codes of most Nations, to deliver fugitives from them would be to become their accomplices—the former therefore is viewed as the lesser evil.

cious cbaracter. The treaty between this country and  
Great Britain, in 1794, was confined to the crimes of mur­  
der and forgery; the present one of 1842 is more compre  
hensive, though still restricted, as is also the treaty with  
Franoe, of 1845. Mr. Jefferson, (1793,) in a letter in reply  
 to a demand for the surrender of fugitives by the French

of most nations, to deliver fugitives from them would be  
to become their accomplices.&quot; Another objection to  
entering into these treaties is the difficulty in guarding  
against the abuse arising out of demands for the surren  
der of political offenders, under the form of some of the  
crimes enumerated in the treaty. In most instances,  
perhaps, of political offences, the acts cetached from the  
political character of the transaction, would bring th
