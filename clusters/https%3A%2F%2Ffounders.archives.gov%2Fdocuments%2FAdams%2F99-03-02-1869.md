You have quoted a paragraph which the Tory papers in America copied from their accomplices in England, accusing me of being a meddling Advocate for the exclusion of American vessels from the Russian Ports.—I shall not boast to you, how many American vessels have been by my exertions alone, admitted into the Russian Ports, and which but for me would have been excluded from them—There are documents public and private, upon this subject, which I need not display before youµThe Official papers have been and will be received at the Department of State, and there I willingly leave them—Neither is it necessary for me to tell you that not one American vessel has to my knowledge been excluded from a Russian Port since my arrival here—But I promised my brother in my last letter to him, to tell you the origin of these compliments paid me in the English and Anglo-American Newspapers.  
Russia and England being at War, the commercial intercourse between them is of course forbidden; and neither English vessels nor English subjects are allowed to come into the Russian Territories—You already know that one of the expedients by which the English have attempted to evade these prohibitions, was by presenting themselves as Americans with forged Passports and Ships Papers.—The Russian Government admit universally every American recognized as such by the American Minister or Consul—This business since I have been here, continues as it was before to be transacted by Mr: Harris, the Consul who never fails however to consult me, and take my opinion, in every case susceptible of a question. I had not been here a week before I was asked to authenticate a paper, purporting to be a Passport of the Mayor of New York, and an eminent merchant of this City sent me in writing his guarantee that the man named in the Passport was a native citizen of the United States.—The Passport was forged in London, by a Jew named van Sander, who has kept there  a shop for neutral papers for several years; and the man named in it was a Liverpool trader who had never set his foot in the United States—You very naturally perceive that I not only refused the authentication desired of me, but that I did not entirely suppress a sentiment of indignation at the imposition that was attempted to be practised upon me in the guarantee.  
Within a fortnight afterwards two ships entered with Registers, of the same Van Sander fabrication—They were detected by Mr: Harris who laid the papers before me, and who duly informed the Russian Government, that they were forged—The vessels with their Cargoes were confiscated, and their Papers delivered to Mr: Harris, who has sent them to the Department of State—In this he acted entirely with my Countenance and Approbation, which under a weight of mercantile influence existing here in favour of these frauds, was undoubtedly useful if not necessary to him—I certainly did let it be understood, by all the Merchants of St: Petersburg, and of the other Russian Ports, that forged papers, pretended to be American, should find neither connivence nor mercy from me; whenever they should come to my knowledge; and although this determination so explicitly manifested, did not recommend me to the favour of Englishmen in any part of the world, nor even to that of the merchants in St: Petersburg, I do sincerely believe that had it not been for it, the real American flag, would long before this have been excluded from the Ports of Russia, as it has been from those of Denmark and Prussia.  
I have heard by an American Gentleman who was in London, at the time when the news of these disasters to the Americans of the Van Sander stamp arrived there, the consternation which they occasioned among the gang of Banditti who had been drawing that trade, and the bitterness of their gall against the meddling American Minister—But I have had no more forged Passports, with guarantees sent to me to be authenticated, and only two or three more of Mr: Van Sanders Registers have appeared in the Russian Ports, during the present year. They have not the same fate with their predecessors—But the Story that I examined all the Papers of vessels myself, or that I ever meddled with them, unless at the request of Mr: Harris, of the Russian Government, or of the persons to whom the papers belong, is a mere fabrication totally destitute of truth—  
My real offence therefore has been, in contributing to the exclusion of persons,  vessels and cargoes, really English, but coming with the forged signatures and seals of the public officers of my Country.—And the Editors of American newspapers, who have copied from their English fellow-labourers columns of abuse for this conduct pretend that the charge of British influence over them is a calumny.  
In speaking of the mercantile influence here, in favour of these frauds, it may be proper to explain myself further. The merchants of St. Petersburg are almost all foreigners—Great numbers of them are English, or connected with English houses—Their business is almost exclusively commission business—They universally detest this War with England, and long for the restoration of the commercial intercourse with that Country—They want the trade; and they care not under what flag or what papers it comes and goes—The American flag, and American papers, would have been the most convenient of all their shelters, and under the liberal confidence with which the Russian Government admitted every vessel and person coming from friendly Countries and recognized by the American Minister or Consul, as Americans, if our countenance could have been obtained, instead of fifty or sixty vessels from Teneriffe, which have come to Russia, for confiscation, under all sorts of papers, excepting American, we might have seen five-hundred direct from the London market both of merchandize and of papers—The inevitable and just consequence of which would have been that the true Americans would have been confounded with the false, and all of them involved in one general proscription.

“ In speaking cf the mercantile.io-  
Huence here in favor of theses frauds,  
it may be proper to explain myfeit  
further. The merchants of St. Peter{-  
burg are almost il forcigners. Great  
rinmbers of them are English or con.  
pe&amp;ted with Englhith houles. Their  
Business is almost excinfively commis­

this war with England, and loog for  
the restoration of the commercial n­  
tercourfe with thar country. They  
want the tracde ; and they care not

know that ene of the expedients by which  
  
’ the English have attempted to evade these  
probibititions was by presenting themselves  
&lt; a 8 Ameaicans, with forged passports and

&#x27; ever, to consult me, and take my opinion, ir  
every case susceptible of a question. 1 had

authenticate.a paper purporting to be a pase-  
  
port of the Mayor of New-York, and an em­  
inent merchant of this city sent we in writing  
his guaraniee that the mun nov.ed in the pas­  
port was @ native ciizen ¢f he U. Stutes,  
Lhe passport was forged in Jondun Ly a jew  
pamed Vun Sender, who has Kept there @  
shep lor neutral papers for several ve s ;o nd  
the man named 1t was a Liverpool wreder,  
&#x27;who hud never set his foot 1 e U, Suates.  
You very naturally perceive, thar 1 not only

templed 1o be practised on mie in the guar­

“ Witlin a fortnig&#x27; afterwards two ships  
entered with registers of the sume Van Sun­

Hurris who Jaid the pepers belore me, and  
wno duly informed the Russian governmenty  
that they were forged. The vesseis with  
their cargoes were confiscated, and thelr pae  
pers delivered to Mr. Hurris, who hus scnt  
them to the Department of State. In thic he  
acted entirely with my countenance and ape  
probation; which, under a weight of mercons  
tile influence existing here in fuvor of these  
frands, was undoubtediy uscluly it not necese

stood, by all the mercounts of St. Petersburg  
and of the other Russian ports, that forged

whenever they should come o my knowledge  
and althouh this determination, so explicidy  
manifested, hid not recomniended me o the |

•• You have quoted a paragraph which  
some papers in America copied from an En­  
glish publication, accusing me of being a  
meddling advocate for the exclusion of A.  
tncrican vessels from the Russian ports—  
1 shall not boast to you how many American  
vessels have been, by my exertions alone,;  
admitted into the Russian ports, and which, i  
but for me, would have been excluded from \
them There are documents, ■ public and !  
private, on this subject, which 1 .need not  
display before you . The official papers  
have been and will be received at the de.  
partment of state and there I willingly leav -  
them.- Neither is it necessary for me to tell  
you. that not one American vessel has, to  
my knowledge, been excluded from a Ruse  
Sian port since my arrival here.  
“ Russia and England being at war, the  
commercial intercourse between them is, of  
course, forbidden ; and neither English ves­  
sels nor English subjects, are allowed to  
come into the Russian territories. You al­  
ready know, that one ot the expedients by  
which the English have attempted to evade  
these prohibitions, was by presenting them­  
selves as Americans, with forged passports  
and ship’s papers. The Russian govern­  
ment admit, universally, every American,  
recogni2ed as such by the American minis,  
ter or consul. This business, since I have  
been here, continues, as it was before, to be  
transacted by Mr. Harris, the consul, who  
never fails, however, to consult me, and  
take my opinion in every case susceptible of  
a question. I had not been here a week,  
before I was asked to authenticate a paper,  
purporting to be a passport of the mayor of  
New-Yurk ; and an eminent merchant of  
this city, sent me in writing his guarantee  
that the man named in the passport was a  
native citizen oj the U. States. The pass­  
port was forged in London, by a Jew named  
van Sander, who has kept there a shop for  
neutral papers, for several years ; and the  
man named in it, was a Liverpool trad r,  
who had never set his foot in the United  
Stales. You very naturally perceive, that  
I not only refused the authentication desired  
Of roe, but that I did not entirely suppress  
a sentiment of indignation at the imposition  
that was attempted to be practised on mein  
the guarantee.  
  
“ Within a fortnight afterwards, two ships  
entered with false registers of the same  
Van Sander’s fabrication. They were de  
tected by Mr. Harris, who laid the papers  
before me, and who duly informed the Rus­  
sian government, that they were forged.—  
The vessels, with theircftrgoes, were confis­  
cated, and their papers delivered to Mr.  
Harris, who has sent them to the department  
of state. In this, he act d entirely with my  
countenance and approbation, which, under  
U weight of mercantile influence, existing  
hfcie in tavor of these trauds, was undoubt­  
edly usetul, il not necessary tohiin. 1 cer  
tainly did let it be u .derst od by all the mer­  
chants of St. Petersburg, and of the other  
Russian ports, that Jorged fiu/iera, pretend­  
ed to be American, should find neither con­  
nivance nor mercy from me, whenever they  
should come to my knowledge ; and altho&#x27;  
this determination, so explicitly manifested,  
did not recommend me to the tavor of En_  
glishmen, nor even to the merchants in St.  
Petersburg, I do most sincerely believe, that  
had it not been for it, the real American  
flag would long before this have been exclu  
ded from the ports of Russia, as it had Deeu  
Jfrom those of Denmark and Prussia.  
“ I have had no more forged passports*  
With guarantees, sent to me to be authenti­  
cated, and only two or three more of Mr  
Sander’s registers have appeared in the Rus­  
sian ports, during the present year. They  
have met the same fate with their prede*  
cessors. But the story, that I examined all  
the papers of vessels myself, or that I ever  
meddled witu them, unless at the request of  
Mr. Harris, or the Russian government, or  
of the persons to whom the papers belong,  
is a mere fabrication, totally destitute of  
truth.  
“ My real offence,therefore,has been in con­  
tributing to the exclusion of persons, vessels fit  
cargoes really English, but coming with  
forged signatures and seals of the public of­  
fices of my country.  
  
“ In speaking of the mercantile influence  
here in favor of these frauds, it may be pro­  
per to ekplain myself further. The n»er_  
chants of St. Petersburg are almost all to  
reigners Great numbers of them are En­  
glish, orconnected with English houses.—  
&#x27;Their business is almost exclusively com  
mission business. Thev universally detest  
this war with England, and long for the  
restoration ofthe commercial intercourse with  
that country. They want the trade ; and  
they care not under what flag, or what pa­  
pers, it comes and goes. The American  
flag and American papers, would have been  
the most convenient of all their shelters,  
and under the liberal confidence which the  
Russian government admitted every vessel  
and person coming from friendly countries  
and iecognisedby the American minister or  
Consol, as Americans, if our countenance  
CnUld have been obtained, instead ot fifty or  
sixty vessels from Teneriffe, which had  
C&#x27; ne to Russia, for confiscation, under all  
amt of papers excefxtmg American, w« might  
h ive seen five hundred direct from the Lon­  
don market, both o. nnfl* nandize and of  
paptrs.— 1&#x27;he inevitable and just couse­  
q u nee of which would have been confound  
ed wi h the false, and &#x27;&lt;11 ot them involved in  
cine general proscription.

ment admit, universally, every Ameri­  
can, recognised as auch by the Ameri­  
can minster or consul This business,  
alncr 1 be been here, continurs as it  
wjs before, to be transacted by Mr. Har­  
ris, the consul, who never fails, however,  
to consult me,&#x27; and take my opinion, i  
every case susceptible of a question. 1  
had r.ot been here a week, before I was  
1 askecrto authenticate a paper, purport  
icg to be a passport of the mayor of  
New-York; and an emimnt merchan;  
of this city, sent me in writing hj&#x27;r gua­  
rantee that the man named in this pan­  
porwas a&#x27;native citizen of the Unite J  
States. The paaspoit was forged m  
London, by a Jew named Van Sander,  
who has kept there a tbop for neutral  
papers, for several y tara ; and the man  
named in it, was a Liverpool trader, who  
hid never set his foot in the U.Sta:es.  
You very naturally perceive, that I not  
only refused the authentication desired  
of me, but that I did not entirely sup­  
press a sentiment of indignation at tht  
imposition that was attempted to be  
practised on me in the guarantee.  
Within i fortnight afterwards, two  
ships entered with registers of the same  
Van Sandcr&#x27;a fabrication. They were  
detected by Mr. Haitis, who laid thr  
papers before me, and who duly infor­  
med the Russian government that they  
were forged The vessels with their  
cargoes were confiscated, and their  
papers delivered to Mr. Harris, who  
has sent tbem to the department of  
state In this he acted entirely with  
my countenance and approbation, which  
undtr a weight of mercantile influence  
existing -here in favor of these iruds,  
wap undoubtedly useful, if not necessary  
to him. I certainly did let it be under­  
stood by all the merchants of St. Peters­  
burg, and of the other Russian ports,  
forced papers, pretended to be A­  
&#x27; mencan. should find, neither conni  
vance nor mercy from me, whenever  
they should come to my knowledge;  
w .ithrMmh this determination, so  
HU v  
explicitly manifested, did not . recom­  
mend me to the favour of Englishmen,  
nor even to that of the merchants in St.  
Petersburg, 1 do most sincerely believe  
that had it not been for it, the teal A­  
rnerican flag would long before this have  
been excluded from the ports of Russia,  
as it haa been from those of Denmark  
and Prussia  
&#x27; ! I have had no more forged passports,  
with guarantees, tent to me to be au­  
, tbentitated, and onlyttwoor three more  
of Mr.Van Sander&#x27;s registers have tp­  
pcared in the Ruislan ports during the  
presentyear. They have met the same  
,faie with their predecessors, flut the  
story that I examined all the papers of  
.Teasels myself, or that 1 ever meddled  
with them unless at-the request of  
Sir. Harris, of the Russian government,  
or of .the persons to whom the papers  
belong, is a mere fabrication totally dea  
titcte of truth. &quot; &#x27; :  
1 My real oSence, therefore, has beep  
in contributing to the exclusion of pe

but coming with forged signatures and

In speaking of the niercary ile ioQuence  
her.- in faToar of these frauds, it may bt  
  
I proper to explain myself further The  
merchants of Str Peteriburg are almost  
  
all foreigners. Great numbers ot them
