If I was equal to the task of forming a plan for the government of a colony, I should be flattered with your request, and very happy to comply with it; because as the divine science of politicks is the science of social happiness, and the blessings of society depend entirely on the constitutions of government, which are generally institutions that last for many generations, there can be no employment more agreeable to a benevolent mind, than a research after the best.   
  
Pope flattered tyrants too much when he said,  
“For forms of government let fools contest,  
That which is best administered is best.”  
  
Nothing can be more fallacious than this: But poets read history to collect flowers not fruits—they attend to fanciful images, not the effects of social institutions. Nothing is more certain from the history of nations, and the nature of man, than that some forms of government are better fitted for being well administered than others.  
We ought to consider, what is the end of government, before we determine which is the best form. Upon this point all speculative politicians will agree, that the happiness of society is the end of government, as all Divines and moral Philosophers will agree that the happiness of the individual is the end of man. From this principle it will follow, that the form of government, which communicates ease, comfort, security, or in one word happiness to the greatest number of persons, and in the greatest degree, is the best.  
All sober enquiries after truth, ancient and modern, Pagan and Christian, have declared that the happiness of man, as well as his dignity consists in virtue. Confucius, Zoroaster, Socrates, Mahomet, not to mention authorities really sacred, have agreed in this.  
If there is a form of government then, whose principle and foundation is virtue, will not every sober man acknowledge it better calculated to promote the general happiness than any other form?  
Fear is the foundation of most governments; but is so sordid and brutal a passion, and renders men, in whose breasts it predominates, so stupid, and miserable, that Americans will not be likely to approve of any political institution which is founded on it.  
Honor is truly sacred, but holds a lower rank in the scale of moral excellence than virtue. Indeed the former is but a part of the latter, and consequently has not equal pretensions to support a frame of government productive of human happiness.  
The foundation of every government is some principle or passion in the minds of the people. The noblest principles and most generous affections in our nature then, have the fairest chance to support the noblest and most generous models of government.  
A man must be indifferent to the sneers of modern Englishmen to mention in their company the names of Sidney, Harrington, Locke, Milton, Nedham, Neville, Burnet, and Hoadley. No small fortitude is necessary to confess that one has read them. The wretched condition of this country, however, for ten or fifteen years past, has frequently reminded me of their principles and reasonings. They will convince any candid mind, that there is no good government but what is Republican. That the only valuable part of the British constitution is so; because the very definition of a Republic, is “an Empire of Laws, and not of men.” That, as a Republic is the best of governments, so that particular arrangement of the powers of society, or in other words that form of government, which is best contrived to secure an impartial and exact execution of the laws, is the best of Republics.  
Of Republics, there is an inexhaustable variety, because the possible combinations of the powers of society, are capable of innumerable variations.  
As good government, is an empire of laws, how shall your laws be made? In a large society, inhabiting an extensive country, it is impossible that the whole should assemble, to make laws: The first necessary step then, is, to depute power from the many, to a few of the most wise and good. But by what rules shall you chuse your Representatives? Agree upon the number and qualifications of persons, who shall have the benefit of choosing, or annex this priviledge to the inhabitants of a certain extent of ground.  
The principal difficulty lies, and the greatest care should be employed in constituting this Representative Assembly. It should be in miniature, an exact portrait of the people at large. It should think, feel, reason, and act like them. That it may be the interest of this Assembly to do strict justice at all times, it should be an equal representation, or in other words equal interest among the people should have equal interest in it. Great care should be taken to effect this, and to prevent unfair, partial, and corrupt elections. Such regulations, however, may be better made in times of greater tranquility than the present, and they will spring up of themselves naturally, when all the powers of government come to be in the hands of the people’s friends. At present it will be safest to proceed in all established modes to which the people have been familiarised by habit.  
A representation of the people in one assembly being obtained, a question arises whether all the powers of government, legislative, executive, and judicial, shall be left in this body? I think a people cannot be long free, nor ever happy, whose government is in one Assembly. My reasons for this opinion are as follow.  
1. A single Assembly is liable to all the vices, follies and frailties of an individual. Subject to fits of humour, starts of passion, flights of enthusiasm, partialities of prejudice, and consequently productive of hasty results and absurd judgments: And all these errors ought to be corrected and defects supplied by some controuling power.  
2. A single Assembly is apt to be avaricious, and in time will not scruple to exempt itself from burthens which it will lay, without compunction, on its constituents.  
3. A single Assembly is apt to grow ambitious, and after a time will not hesitate to vote itself perpetual. This was one fault of the long parliament, but more remarkably of Holland, whose Assembly first voted themselves from annual to septennial, then for life, and after a course of years, that all vacancies happening by death, or otherwise, should be filled by themselves, without any application to constituents at all.  
4. A Representative Assembly, altho’ extremely well qualified, and absolutely necessary as a branch of the legislature, is unfit to exercise the executive power, for want of two essential properties, secrecy and dispatch.  
5. A Representative Assembly is still less qualified for the judicial power; because it is too numerous, too slow, and too little skilled in the laws.  
6. Because a single Assembly, possessed of all the powers of government, would make arbitrary laws for their own interest, execute all laws arbitrarily for their own interest, and adjudge all controversies in their own favour.  
But shall the whole power of legislation rest in one Assembly? Most of the foregoing reasons apply equally to prove that the legislative power ought to be more complex—to which we may add, that if the legislative power is wholly in one Assembly, and the executive in another, or in a single person, these two powers will oppose and enervate upon each other, until the contest shall end in war, and the whole power, legislative and executive, be usurped by the strongest.  
The judicial power, in such case, could not mediate, or hold the balance between the two contending powers, because the legislative would undermine it. And this shews the necessity too, of giving the executive power a negative upon the legislative, otherwise this will be continually encroaching upon that.  
To avoid these dangers let a distant Assembly be constituted, as a mediator between the two extreme branches of the legislature, that which represents the people and that which is vested with the executive power.  
Let the Representative Assembly then elect by ballot, from among themselves or their constituents, or both, a distinct Assembly, which for the sake of perspicuity we will call a Council. It may consist of any number you please, say twenty or thirty, and should have a free and independent exercise of its judgment, and consequently a negative voice in the legislature.  
These two bodies thus constituted, and made integral parts of the legislature, let them unite, and by joint ballot choose a Governor, who, after being stripped of most of those badges of domination called prerogatives, should have a free and independent exercise of his judgment, and be made also an integral part of the legislature. This I know is liable to objections, and if you please you may make him only President of the Council, as in Connecticut: But as the Governor is to be invested with the executive power, with consent of Council, I think he ought to have a negative upon the legislative. If he is annually elective, as he ought to be, he will always have so much reverence and affection for the People, their Representatives and Councillors, that although you give him an independent exercise of his judgment, he will seldom use it in opposition to the two Houses, except in cases the public utility of which would be conspicuous, and some such cases would happen.  
In the present exigency of American affairs, when by an act of Parliament we are put out of the royal protection, and consequently discharged from our allegiance; and it has become necessary to assume government for our immediate security, the Governor, Lieutenant-Governor, Secretary, Treasurer, Commissary, Attorney-General, should be chosen by joint Ballot, of both Houses. And these and all other elections, especially of Representatives, and Councillors, should be annual, there not being in the whole circle of the sciences, a maxim more infallible than this, “Where annual elections end, there slavery begins.”  
These great men, in this respect, should be, once a year   
  
“Like bubbles on the sea of matter borne,  
They rise, they break, and to that sea return.”  
  
This will teach them the great political virtues of humility, patience, and moderation, without which every man in power becomes a ravenous beast of prey.  
This mode of constituting the great offices of state will answer very well for the present, but if, by experiment, it should be found inconvenient, the legislature may at its leisure devise other methods of creating them, by elections of the people at large, as in Connecticut, or it may enlarge the term for which they shall be chosen to seven years, or three years, or for life, or make any other alterations which the society shall find productive of its ease, its safety, its freedom, or in one word, its happiness.  
A rotation of all offices, as well as of Representatives and Councillors, has many advocates, and is contended for with many plausible arguments. It would be attended no doubt with many advantages, and if the society has a sufficient number of suitable characters to supply the great number of vacancies which would be made by such a rotation, I can see no objection to it. These persons may be allowed to serve for three years, and then excluded three years, or for any longer or shorter term.  
Any seven or nine of the legislative Council may be made a Quorum, for doing business as a Privy Council, to advise the Governor in the exercise of the executive branch of power, and in all acts of state.  
The Governor should have the command of the militia, and of all your armies. The power of pardons should be with the Governor and Council.  
Judges, Justices and all other officers, civil and military, should be nominated and appointed by the Governor, with the advice and consent of Council, unless you choose to have a government more popular; if you do, all officers, civil and military, may be chosen by joint ballot of both Houses, or in order to preserve the independence and importance of each House, by ballot of one House, concurred by the other. Sheriffs should be chosen by the freeholders of counties—so should Registers of Deeds and Clerks of Counties.  
  
All officers should have commissions, under the hand of the Governor and seal of the Colony.  
The dignity and stability of government in all its branches, the morals of the people and every blessing of society, depends so much upon an upright and skillful administration of justice, that the judicial power ought to be distinct from both the legislative and executive, and independent upon both, that so it may be a check upon both, as both should be checks upon that. The Judges therefore should always be men of learning and experience in the laws, of exemplary morals, great patience, calmness, coolness and attention. Their minds should not be distracted with jarring interests; they should not be dependant upon any man or body of men. To these ends they should hold estates for life in their offices, or in other words their commissions should be during good behaviour, and their salaries ascertained and established by law. For misbehaviour the grand inquest of the Colony, the House of Representatives, should impeach them before the Governor and Council, where they should have time and opportunity to make their defence, but if convicted should be removed from their offices, and subjected to such other punishment as shall be thought proper.  
A Militia Law requiring all men, or with very few exceptions, besides cases of conscience, to be provided with arms and ammunition, to be trained at certain seasons, and requiring counties, towns, or other small districts to be provided with public stocks of ammunition and entrenching utensils, and with some settled plans for transporting provisions after the militia, when marched to defend their country against sudden invasions, and requiring certain districts to be provided with field-pieces, companies of matrosses and perhaps some regiments of light horse, is always a wise institution, and in the present circumstances of our country indispensible.  
Laws for the liberal education of youth, especially of the lower class of people, are so extremely wise and useful, that to a humane and generous mind, no expence for this purpose would be thought extravagant.  
The very mention of sumptuary laws will excite a smile. Whether our countrymen have wisdom and virtue enough to submit to them I know not. But the happiness of the people might be greatly promoted by them, and a revenue saved sufficient to carry on this war forever. Frugality is a great revenue, besides curing us of vanities, levities and fopperies which are real antidotes to all great, manly and warlike virtues.  
  
But must not all commissions run in the name of a king? No. Why may they not as well run thus, “The Colony of  to A. B. greeting,” and be tested by the Governor?  
Why may not writs, instead of running in the name of a King, run thus, “The Colony of  to the Sheriff, &amp;c.” and be tested by the Chief Justice.  
Why may not indictments conclude, “against the peace of the Colony of  and the dignity of the same?”  
A Constitution, founded on these principles, introduces knowledge among the People, and inspires them with a conscious dignity, becoming Freemen. A general emulation takes place, which causes good humour, sociability, good manners, and good morals to be general. That elevation of sentiment, inspired by such a government, makes the common people brave and enterprizing. That ambition which is inspired by it makes them sober, industrious and frugal. You will find among them some elegance, perhaps, but more solidity; a little pleasure, but a great deal of business—some politeness, but more civility. If you compare such a country with the regions of domination, whether Monarchial or Aristocratical, you will fancy yourself in Arcadia or Elisium.  
If the Colonies should assume governments separately, they should be left entirely to their own choice of the forms, and if a Continental Constitution should be formed, it should be a Congress, containing a fair and adequate Representation of the Colonies, and its authority should sacredly be confined to these cases, viz. war, trade, disputes between Colony and Colony, the Post-Office, and the unappropriated lands of the Crown, as they used to be called.  
These Colonies, under such forms of government, and in such a union, would be unconquerable by all the Monarchies of Europe.  
You and I, my dear Friend, have been sent into life, at a time when the greatest law-givers of antiquity would have wished to have lived. How few of the human race have ever enjoyed an opportunity of making an election of government more than of air, soil, or climate, for themselves or their children. When! Before the present epocha, had three millions of people full power and a fair opportunity to form and establish the wisest and happiest government that human wisdom can contrive? I hope you will avail yourself and your country of that extensive learning and indefatigable industry which you possess, to assist her in the formations of the happiest governments, and the best character of a great People. For myself, I must beg you to keep my name out of sight, for this feeble attempt, if it should be known to be mine, would oblige me to apply to myself those lines of the immortal John Milton, in one of his sonnets,  
  
“I did but teach the age to quit their cloggs  
By the plain rules of ancient Liberty,  
When lo! a barbarous noise surrounded me,  
Of owls and cuckoos, asses, apes and dogs.

IF I was equal to the taflc of forming a plan for the government  
of a colony, I (hould be flattered with your request, and very  
happy to comply with it ; because as the divine science of politics  
is the science of social happiness, and the bleflings of society de­  
pend entirelv on the const tutions of government, which are gene­  
rally institutions that last for many generations, there can be no  
employment more agreeable to a benevolent mind, than arcfcarch  
after the best.  
  
Pope flattered tyrants too much when he said  
&quot; For forms of government let fools contefl.  
&quot; That which u befl adminiflered is befl.&#x27;*  
Nothing can be more fallacious than this : But poets read history  
to colle£l flowers not fruits—they attend to fanciful images, not  
the effedls of social institutions. Nothing is more certain from  
the history of nations, and the nature of man, than that some forms  
of government are better fitted for being well aaminiftered than  
others.  
  
We ought to conudcr, whnt is the end of government, before  
we determine which is the best form.—Upon this point all Ipe­  
eulative politicians will agree, that the happiness of society is the  
end of government, as all divioes and moral philosophers will  
agree that the happiness of the individual is the end of man. From  
this principle it will follow, that the form of government, which  
communicates ease, comfort, fccunty, or in one word happiness  
to the grcateft number of persons, and in the greatest degree, is the  
best.  
  
All sober enquirers after truth, ancient and modern, Pagan and  
Christian, have declared that the happiness of man, as well as his  
dignity consists in virtue. Confucius, Zoroatler. Socrates, Ma­  
hornet, not to mention authorities really sacred, have agieed in  
this.  
  
Ifrhereisa form of government then, whose principle and  
foundation is virtue, will not every sober man acknowledge it  
better calculated to promote the general happiuefs than any other  
form ?  
  
Fear is the foundation of mod governments ; but is so fordtd  
and brutal a paflion, and renders men, in whose breads it pre­  
dominates, so itupid, and miserable, that Americans will not be  
likely to approve of any political institution which is founded on  
it.  
  
Honour is truly sacred, but holds a lower rank in the scale of  
moral excellence than virtue. Indeed the former is but a part of  
the latter, and confcquently has not equal pretensions to support a  
frame of government produ&amp;ive of human happiness.  
The foundation of every government is some principle or pas­  
sion in the minds of the people. The noblest principles arid moll  
generou affcclions in our nature then, have the fai re ft chance to  
support the noblest and most generous models of government.  
  
A man mul\ be indifferent to thefneers of modern Englishmen,  
to mention in their company, the names ot Sidney, Harrington,  
Locke, Milton, Nedham, Neville, Burnet, and Hoadley. No small  
fc&gt;rtrude is nercflTary to confefs that one has read them. The  
•wrctched condition of this country, however, for ten or fifteen  
years past, has frequently reminded me of their principles and  
xeafonings. They will convince anv cancid mind, that there is  
no good government but what is Rcp&gt; lican. Tnat the only val­  
uable part at the Hritifh Conkru &gt;so; because the very deft-.  
nition of a Republic, is &quot; an lvnpire of Laws, and not of Men.&quot;  
That, as a Republic is t r be ft of governments, so that particular  
arrangement of th:- v/crs of focietv, or in other words that form  
*f government, which is best contrived to fccure an impartial and  
cxatt r xecu&#x27;.ion of the laws, is the best of R publics.  
0»l Republics, there is an inexhaustible variety, because the pos­  
sible combinations of the powers of society, arc capable of innu­  
merable variations.  
  
As pood governments an empire of laws, how shall your laws be  
made? In a large society, inhabitating an extensive country it is  
impoflible that the whole should afTemble, to make laws : The  
firft necefTary step then, is, to depute power from the many, to a  
few of the mod wife and good.—But by what rules (ball you  
choose your Reprefcntatives ? Agree upon the number and quali­  
fications of persons, who shall have the benefit of choosing, or an­  
nex this privilege to the inhabitants of a certain extent of ground.  
The principal difficulty lies, and the greatcfl care should be em­  
ployed in configuring this Reprefentativc AfTembly. It should  
be in miniature, an exa£l portrait of the people at large. It (hould  
think, feel, rcafon, and ast like them. That it may be the interefl  
of this aflembly to do ftrifljuflice at all times, it should be an  
equal representation, or in other words equal interefl among the  
people should have equal interefl in it. Great care should be ta­  
ken to effett this, and to prevent unfair, partial, and corrupt elec­  
tions. Such regulations, however, may be better made in times of  
greater tranquility than the present, and they will spring up of4  
themfclves naturally, when all the powers of government come to  
be in the hands of the people&#x27;s friends. At present it will be faf­  
cfl to proceed in all eftablilhed modes to which the people have  
been familiarifed by habit.  
  
A representation of the people in one AfTembly being obtained,  
a queflion arises whether all the powers of governmenr, legislative,  
executive,and judicial, shall be left in this body? I think a peo­  
ple cannot be long free, nor ever happ), whole government is in  
one AfTembly. My reasons for this opinion arc as follow.  
  
1. A Angle AfTembly isliable to all the vices, follies and frailties  
of an individual. Subjcfl to si&#x27;S of humour, starts of passion,  
flights of cnthufiafm, partialities, of prejudice, and confcquently  
produflive of hasty results and absurd judgments : And ail these  
errors ought to be corrected and defeats fupplicd by some con­  
trolling power.  
  
2. A (ingle afTembly is apt to be avaricious, and in time will not  
scruple to exempt itfelf from burthens which it will lay, without  
compun&amp;ion, on its constituents.  
  
3. A single AU&#x27;einbly is apt to grow ambitious, and after a time  
•will not hefitateto vote itfelf perpetual. This was one fault of the  
long Parliament, but more remarkably of Holland, whose AfTem­  
bly firft voted thrmfelves from annual to septennial, then for  
life, and after a courfeof years, that all vacancies happening by  
death, or otherwise, should be filled by themselves, without any  
application to conflitupnts at all.  
  
4. A Representative Alfembly, altho&#x27; extremely well qualified,  
and absolutely neceflary, as a branch of the legislature, is unfit to  
exercifc the executive power, for want of two cflential properties,  
fecrecyand dispatch.  
  
,5. A Rcprefentative /.ITembly is still less qualified for the judi­  
cial power ; bccaufe it is too numerous, too flow, and too little  
{lolled in the laws.  
  
6, Because a Tingle AfTembly, pofTefled of all the powers of go­  
vernment, would make arbitrary laws for their own intcreft,execute  
all laws arbitrarily for their own intcreft, and adjudge all contro­  
verfics in their own favour.  
  
But shall the whole power of legislation reft, in one AfTembly ?  
Most of the foregoing reasons apply equally to prove that the le­  
gislative power ought to be more complex—to which we may add,  
that if the lcgiflative power is wholly in one AUembly, and the ex­  
ecutive in another, or in a single person, these two powers will  
oppofeand encroach upon each other, until the contefl shall end  
in war, and the whole power, legislative and executive, be ufarped  
by ihe ftrongcil.  
  
The judicial power, in such cafe, could not mediate, ar liolJ  
the balance between the two contending powers, becau.e t c egi­  
flative would undermine it. And this ihews the neceility too, of  
giving the executive power a negative upon the legislative, ot ler­  
wifc this will be continually encroaching upon that.  
To avoid these dangers let a diftinft Atfemblv be constituted, as  
a mediator between the two extreme branches of the legmature,  
that which represents the people and that which is veftcd with the  
executive power.  
Let the Representative AfiTembly then elect by ballot, from  
among themselves or their conllituents, or both, a diitintt Atiem­  
bly, which for the fake of perspicuity we will call a Council. It  
may consist of dny number you please, fay twenty or thirty, and  
(hould have a free and independent exercise ot its judgment, and  
consequently a negative voice in the legislature.  
These two bodies thus constituted, and made integral pruts of  
the legislature, let them unite, and by joint ballot choofc a Gover­  
nor, who, after being dripped of moll of those badges of domina­  
tion callod prerogatives, ihould have a free and independent cxpi­  
cife of his judgment, and be madealfo an integral part oi the le­  
gislature. This I know is liable to obje&amp;ions. .&gt;nd if you please  
you may make him only President ofthe Council, as in Connecti­  
cut : But as the Governor is to be inveiled with the executive  
power, with confentof Council, I think he ought to have a nega­  
tive upon the legislative. If he is annually as he ought tQ  
be, he will alv. ays have so much reverence and aiteciion for the  
people, their Keprelentutives and Counsellors, that although yOu  
give him an independent exercise of his judgment, he will f&lt; ldom  
use it in opposition tothe twohoufes, except in cases the public uti­  
lity of which would be confpicuoua, and some such cases would  
happen.  
  
In the present exigency of American affairs, when, by an ast of  
&#x27;arliomcnt we are put out of the royal prote&amp;ion, and conicquent­  
y difchargcd from our allegiance ; and it has become necelTary to  
flume government for our immediate security, the Gov. Lieut,  
jov. Secretary, Treafurcf, Comm lTarv, Attorney-General, should  
3e cho fen by joint ballot, ol both Houfrs. And thcle and all other  
elections, especially of Representatives and Counsellors, should be  
annual, there not being in the whole circle of the sciences, a max­  
im more infallible than this,&quot; Where annual elc&amp;ions end, there  
slavery begins.&quot;  
  
These great men, in this refpeft, should be, once a year

ly discharged from our allegiance ; and it has become necessary to  
•kmc government for our immediate fecunty, the Gov Lieut.  
Gov. Secretary, TreaCurer, Comm.ffary, Attorney-Genera]l, Ihould  
be chosen by joint ballot, ot both Houses. And thee and all other  
cle£l:ons, especially of Representatives and Councilors, Ihould be  
annual, there not being in the whole circle of the fc.ences, a max­  
im more infallible than this, « Where annual elea.ons end, there  
slavery begins.&quot;  
These great men, in this refpeft, should be, once a year  
&quot; Like bubbles on the sea of matter borne,  
&quot; They rife, they bunk, and to that sea return.&quot;  
This will teach them the great political virtues of humility, pa­  
tience, and moderation, without which every man in power be­  
comes a rav: nous beast of prey. , ,  
This mode of confuting the great offices of date will answer  
■very well for the present ; but if, by experiment, it Ihould be  
found inconvenient, the legislature may, at its leisure, devise other  
methods of creating them, by eleaions ot the people at large, as  
in Omneaicut, or it may enlarge the term for which they (hall  
be chosen to seven years, or three years, or for life. or make any  
other alterations which the society (hall find produtlive ot us ea(e,  
its fafety, its freedom, or in one word, it? happint fs.  
A rotation of all offices, as well ai of Representatives and Coun­  
sellors has many advocates, and is contended for with many plau­  
sible arguments. It would be attended no doubt with many ad­  
vantages, and if the focicty has a fuffirient number of Tunable cha­  
raOe.s to supply the great nun-&#x27;.er of vacancies which would be  
made by such a rotation, I can fee no objection to it. These per­  
sons mav be allowed to fcrve for three years, and then be excluded  
three year&quot;, or for any longer or (horter term.  
Any seven or nine of the legidative Council may be made a  
Quorum, for doing bufincfs as a Privy Council, to advise the Go­  
vernor in the exercifeof the executive branch of power, and in  
*11 afis of state.  
The Governor (hould have the command of the militia, and ot  
*11 your armies. The power of pardons ihould be with the Go1  
\&gt;ernor and Council.  
Judges, juftiees and all other officer&quot;, civil and military, Ihould  
be nominated and appointed by the Governor, with the advice  
»nd consent of Council, unless you choose to have a government  
more popular; if you do, all officers, civil and military, may be  
chosen by joint ballot of both houses, or in order to preserve the  
independence and importance ot each house, by ballot of one  
house, concurred by the other. Sheriffs (hould be chosen by the  
freeholders of counties- so (hould Registers of Deeds and Clerks  
of Counties.  
All officers (hould have commiflions, under the hand of the Go­  
vernor and seal of the Colony.  
The dignity and (lability of government in all its branches, the  
morals ot the people and eveiv blcffing of society, depend so  
mi ch upon an upright and (killful adminiflration otjuftice, that  
the judicial power ought to be diilina from both the legislative  
and executive, and independent upon both, that so it may be a  
check upon both, as both (hould be checks upon that. The  
Judges therefore should always be men of learning md experience  
in the laws, of exemplary morals, great patience, calmness, cool­  
ness and attention. Their minds (hould not be diftraaed with  
jarring interefls; they (hould not be dependant upon any man, or  
bodyof men. To thefeends they (hould hold c&#x27;.tates for life in  
their offices, or in other words their commiflions (hould be during  
good behavior, and their salines ascertained and eftablilhed by law  
For misbehavior the grand Inqucll of the Colonv, the House ot  
Representatives, should impeach them before the Governor and  
Council, where they (hould have time and opportunity to make  
their defence, but if conviaed, (hould be removed from their of­  
fices, and fubjeaed to such other punilhmeot as lhall bethought  
proper.  
A militia law, requiring all men, or with very few exceptions,  
liefides cases ol conscience, to be provided with arms aud ammu­  
nition, to be trained at certain seasons, and requiring counties,  
towns, or other small diftrias, to be provided with public (locks  
of ammunition and entrenching utensils, and with some fettled  
plans for transporting provisions atter the militia, when marched  
to defend their country against sudden invasions, and requiring  
ceiuin diftritls to be provided with field pieces, companies of  
tnatroffes, and perhaps some regiments of light horse, is always a  
wife inlluution, and in the present circuinftanccs of our country,  
indifpenfible. .  
Laws for the liberal education of youth, especially of the lower  
class of pcopie, aie so extremely wife and ufelul, that to a humane  
and generous mind, no cxpence for this purpose would be thought  
exiravagant.  
The very mention of famptuary laws will cxcitc a smile. Wheth­  
er our countrymen have wisdom and virtue enough to submit to  
them I know not. But the happiness of the pcopie might be  
greatly promoted by them, and a revenue laved (juicient to carry  
on this war forever. Frugality is a great revenue, beftdes curing  
*is of vanities, levities, and fopperies, which are real antidotes to  
all great, manly and warlike virtues.  
But mud not all commiflions run in the name of a King ? No.  
&quot;Why may they npt as well run thus, &quot; The Colony of to  
A. B. greeting&#x27;, and be tested by the Governoi ?  
Why may not writs, instead of running in the name of a King,  
run thus, &quot; The Colony of to the Sheriff, &amp;c.&quot; and be  
reded by the Chief Tuftice.  
Why msy not indidtments conclude, &quot; against the peace of the  
Colony of and the dignity of the fame ?&quot;  
A Constitution, founded on these principles, introduces know­  
ledge among the people, and mfpirts them w&#x27;th a confeious dig­  
nity, becoming Freemen. A general emulation takes place, which  
causes good humour, sociability, good manners, and good morals  
to be general. That elevation of sentiment, inspired by such a  
government, makes the common people brave and enterprizing.  
That ambition which is inspired by it makes them lober, indust­  
rious and frugal. You will find among them some elegance, per­  
haps, but more solidity ; a little pleasure, but a great deal o) busi­  
ness—some politencfs.&#x27;but more civility. If you compare futh a  
country with the regions ot domination, whether or  
ariftocratical, you will fancy yourfelf in Arcadia, or ElyTmm.  
If the Colonies (hould alfume governments separately, they  
should be left entirely to their own choice of the forms, and if a  
Continental Constitution (hould be formed, it Ihould be a Con­  
gress, containing a fair and adequate Representation of the Colo­  
nies,&#x27;and iis authority (hould sacredly be confined to these cases,  
viz. war, trade, difputcs between Colony and Colony, the Polt-  
Officc, and the unappropriated lands of the Crown, as they used  
to he called. .  
These Colonies, under such forms of government, and in such a  
union, would be unconquerable by all the Monarchies of Europe.  
You and I, my dear friend, have been sent into life, at a time  
■when the grcateft lawgivers of antiquity would have wished to  
have lived. How few of the human race have ever enjoyed an  
t oportunity of making an eleaion of government tnoie than of  
  
air foil or eTiraate. for themselves or their children. Wii?n !

F I was equal to the tafk of form-  
ing a‘plan forthe government  
of a colony, I fhould be flattered  
with your requeft, and very happy  
to comply with it; becaufe, as the  
divine fcience of politics is the {ci-  
ence of focial happinefs, and the  
bleflings’ of fociety depend entirely  
on the conftitntions of government,  
which are generally inftitutions that  
laft for many generations, there can  
be no employment more agreeable  
to a benevolent mind, than a re-  
fearch aiter the beft.  
  
Pors flattered tyrants teo much  
when he faid,  
  
“ For forms of government let fools con-  
  
tcf.  
“That which is bef adminiftered is beft.”’  
  
Nothing can be more fallacious than  
this; But poets read hiftory to col-  
lect flowers not fruits—they atten  
to fanciful images, not the effects of  
focial inftitutions. Nothing is more  
certain from the hiftory of nations,  
and the nature of man, than that  
fome forms of government are bet-  
ter fired for being well adminifter-  
ed than others.  
  
We ought to confider what is  
the end of government, before we  
determine which is the beft form.—  
Upon this point all {peculative poli-  
ticians will agree, that the happi-  
nels of fotiety is the end of govern-  
  
ment, as all divines and moral phi-  
lofophers will agree, that the happi-  
nefs of the individual is the end of  
man. From this principle it will  
follow, that’ the form of govern-  
ment, which communicates e¢afe,  
comfort, fecarity, or, in one word,  
happinets to the greatett nnmber of  
perions, and in the greateft degree,  
is the beft.  
  
All fober enquirers after truth,  
  
ancient and modern, Pagan and  
Chriftian, have declared that the  
happinefs of man, as well as his dig-  
nity, confifts in virtue. Confucius,  
Zoroafter, Socrates, Mahomet, not  
to mention authorities really facred,  
have agreed in this. .  
* If there is a form of government  
then, whofe priacipleand founda-  
tion is virtue, will not every fober  
mau acknowledge it better calcula-  
ted to promote the general happi-  
nefs than any other torm ?  
  
Fear is the foundation of moft  
governments , but is fo fordid’ahd  
brutal a paffion, and ‘renders men,  
in whofe breafts it predomimates, fo  
  
Atupid and miferable, that Ameri-  
_¢ans will not be likely to approve  
  
of any political inftitution  
founded of it. ,  
  
Honour is troly Sacred, but’holds  
a.lower rank in the {eale of ntoral  
excellencé than virtue. ‘Indeed the  
former ig but part of the latter,  
  
whieh is  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Thoughts on  
  
and confequently has not equal  
pretentions to, fupport a frame of  
governmen: productive of human  
happinels.  
  
The foundation of every govern  
ment is fome principle or paffion in  
the minds of the people. The no-  
bleft principles and moft&#x27; generous  
affections in our nature then, have  
the faireft chance to fupport the  
nobleft and moft generous models of  
  
government.  
  
A man muft be indifferent to the  
fneers of modern Englithmen, to  
mention in their company, the  
names of Sidney, Harrington, Locke,  
Miltun, Nedham, Neville, Burnét,  
and Hoadley. No imall fortitude  
is necefJary to confels chat one had  
read them. The wretched condi-  
tion of this country, however, tor  
ten or fitteen years paft, has fre-  
quentiy reminded me ot their prin-  
ciples and reajonings. They will  
convince any candid mind, that  
there is no good government but  
what is Republican. hat the on-  
ly valuable part of the Britifh Con-  
iticution is fo; becaule the very de-  
fivition of a Republic, is “ an Em-  
pire of Laws, and not of Men.”’  
‘Thar, as a Republic is the beft of  
governments, fo that particular ar-  
rangement ot the powers of focie-  
ty, or in other words that form of  
government, which is beit contriv-  
ed ro fecure an impartial and exact  
execurion of the laws, is the beit of  
Republics.  
  
Ot Republics there is an inex-  
hauitible variety, becaule the pol-  
fible combinations of the powers of  
fociety, are capable of innumera-  
ble variations.  
  
As good government is an empire  
aflaws, how thal! your laws be made?  
In a large fociety, inhibiting an  
extealive country, it is impollible  
that the whole fhouk! affemble, to  
make laws; The firft neceflary

and good.—But by what rules fhall  
  
you chooie your Repretertatives ?  
  
Agree upor. the number and qualifie  
  
cations of perions, who thal have  
  
the benefit’ of choofing, or annex  
  
this privilege to the inhabitants of  
a ceftain extent of ‘greand.  
  
The principal ditheulty lies, and  
the greatett care thould be employe  
ed, in conftituting this Reprefeata-  
tive Affembly. Lt thould be, in mi-  
niature, an exaét pu traitof the peo-  
pie at large. It fhould thiak, feel,  
reafon, and aét like them: » That  
it may be the intereft of this aflem-  
bly to do trict juftice at all timess  
it fhould be an equal reprefentation,  
or in other words, equal interett a-  
mong the people fhould have equal  
intereft in it. Great care fhould be  
taken to effect this, and to prevent  
unfair, partial, and corrupt elec-  
tions. Such regulations, however,  
may be better made in times or  
greater tranquility thanthe prefent,  
and they will ipring up of them-  
felves naturally, when all the pow-  
ers of government come to be in  
the hands of the people’: friends,  
At prefent, it will be fufeft to pro-  
ceed in all eftablithhed modes, ‘to  
which the people have been famiii-  
ariled by habit.  
  
A reprefentation of the —  
in one Affembly being obtained, a  
queftion arifes whether all the pew-  
ers of government, legiflative, ex-  
ecutive, and judicial, fhall be left in  
this body ? L think a peaple cannot  
be long free, nor ever happy, whole  
government is in one Affembly.  
My reafons for this opinion are as  
follow.  
  
t. Afingle Affembly is Hable to  
all the vices, follies, and frailties ot  
an individual. Subject 4 firs of be-  
mour , (tarts of F pafhon, fights of en-  
thu! fia, partialities, of “prejudice,  
and confequently productive ot hat.

And all the? errors ought to be.cor-  
rected and defects fupplied by fome  
controling power,  
  
a. A fingle Affembly ie apt to. be  
avaricious, and in time. will not  
ferepie to exempt itfelt from bur-  
thens which it will Jay, without  
compundtion, on its gonftitments.  
  
. 3 A fingle Affhmbly is apt to  
grow. -arabitions, and after a time  
  
will hot hefitate to vote itlelf per-  
pecual. , This was one fault of the  
ae Parliament, but more remark-  
  
of Holland, whofe Aflembly  
fick voted themfelves from annual  
to fepteniiial, then for life, and af-  
ner a courte of years, that. all var  
pancies, happening by death, or ar  
therwile, thould b filled by. themy  
felves, without any application to  
conttitaents, at all.  
  
4. A Reprefentative Affembly,  
although extremely well qualified,  
and ablulotely neceflary, as.a braach  
of the legiflature, ie unfit to exer:  
cife the executive pawer, fer want  
of two.effential properties, fecrecy  
apd difpateh. !  
  
s. A Reprefeniative Aflembly is  
filllefs adakified for the jndicial powr  
er; becaufe it is too numerons, too  
flow, and foo little tkilled in the laws,  
  
6. Becaufe a fingle Alembly, pof-  
feffed of all the powers of govern-  
ment, would make arbitrary laws  
for their own intereft, execute all  
Jaws arbirrarily for their own iotere  
eft, and adjudge all controverties ip  
their own favour.  
  
But fliall the whole power of le-  
giflation rettiu one Affembly ? Moft  
of the foregoing reafonsapply equal-  
ly, to prove ghar the legillarive pow-  
er ouglit té be more complex—to  
which we may add, that if the, le-  
  
iflative power is wholly in one Af-  
fembly, arid the executive in ano-  
ther, or in ‘a tittgle “perfon, ° thefe  
two powers will oppole and en-  
ai upon each otaer, antl the  
  
contelt ihall’ end ‘in war, and the  
Bites :  
  
Thoughts on Government  
  
whole power, legiflative and execne  
tive, be ufurped by the ftrongeit.  
  
The judicial, power, in fuch caie,  
could not mediate, or hold the bal-  
aoce between the two contending  
powers, becaufe the legiflative would  
uadenmine ut. And this hhews the  
necseffity too, of giving. the execu-  
tive power @ Negative upon the le-  
giflative, otherwile this will be con-  
tinnally encroaching wpon that,  
  
To avoid thefe dangers, let a dif-  
tinct Affembly be conftiauted, as a  
mediator between the \wo extreme  
branches of the legiflature, that  
which reprefents the people, and  
that which is vefted with the exer  
culive power, : 4  
  
Let the Reprefentative AGembly  
then clect by ballot, from among  
themfelves or their. conftituests, or  
both, a diftinct Aflembly, which  
for the fake. of perfpicuiry. we. will  
calla Council, It may contift of any  
number you pleafe, fay twenty or  
shitry, and fhould have a free -and  
independent exercife of its judg-  
ment, and confequently a negative  
voice in. the legiflature.  
  
Thefe two bodies thns conktirne-  
tae made integral parts of the le-  
gillature, let them unite, and by joiat  
ballot choofe a Governor, who, af-  
ter being ftripped of moft of thole  
badges of dominatien called prero-  
gatives, thould haye a free and, in-  
dependent exercile of his judgment,  
and be made alio 2n integral part of  
the legifleture. This | know js li-  
able to objections, and if you pleafe  
you may make him only Prefident  
of the Council, asin Copnedicut.:  
But as the Governer is to be inyelt-  
ed with the executive power, with  
confent of Council, L think he ought  
to have a megative upon the fegiller  
tive. If he 1s anpmally elective, as  
  
che obght to be, be will always have  
  
fo math rerercnce apd affection for

In the prefent exigency of A-  
merican affairs, when, by an adt  
of Parliament, we are put out of  
the royal ‘protection, and conta.  
quently dileharged from our allesi-

to allume government for our im-  
mediate fecurity, the Gov. Lieut.  
Gov. Setretary, Treafurer, Com-  
miffary, and Attorney-General,  
fhould be chofen by joiat ballot, of  
both Houfes. Aadthele and ali other  
eletions, efpecially of Reprefenta-

Thefe great men, in this refpe@  
fhould be, once a year

This. will teach them the great

This mode of conftituting the  
great offices of ftate will anfwer  
very well for the prefent; but if,  
by experiment, it fhould be found  
inconvenient, the legiflature may,  
at its leifure, devife other methods

recently published. In that letter he fays, &quot; There is no good  
government but what is republican—that the only vamable part  
of the Britilh constitution is so—that the legislature ftiould be di­  
vided into two branches, a°d the executive should have a nega­  
tive on both ; but that the executive, as well as both branches of  
the legislative, ought to be annually cle&amp;ive, there not being in  
the whole circle of the sciences a maxim more infallible than this,  
Where annual eleflions end, there tyranny begins. Thcfe great men,  
in this refpeft, should be once a year,  
Like bibbles on the sea of matter borne,  
They the* break, and to that sea return.  
This will .each them the great political virtues of humility, pa­  
tience, and moderation, without which every man in power be­  
comes a ravenous beast of prey.

MY DEAR stn—If I was equal to the task of form-  
ing a plan for the government of a colony, I should  
be flattered with your request, and very happy to  
comply with it; because as the diviae science of  
politics is the science of social happiness, and the  
blessings of society depend entirely on the consti-  
tutions of government, which are generally insti‘u-  
tions that last for many generations, there can be  
no employment more agreeable to a benevolent  
mind, than a research after the best.  
  
Pore flattered tyrants too much when he said  
  
“For forms of government let fools contest,  
“That. which is best administered is best.”  
  
| Nothing ean be more fallacious than this: But peets  
  
read history to collect flowers not fruits—they at-  
tend to fanciful images, not the effects of social in-  
stitutions. Nothing is more certain from the his-  
tory of nations, and the nature of man, than that  
some forms of government are better fitted for be-  
ing well administered than others.  
  
We ought to consider, what is the end of govern-  
ment, before we determine which is the best form.  
—Upon this point all speculative politicians will  
agree, that the happiness of society is the end of  
government, as all divines and moral philosophers  
willagree that the happiness of the individual is  
the end of man. From this principle it will follow,  
that the form of government, which communieates  
ease, comfort, security, or in one word happiness  
to the greatest number of persans, and in the  
greatest degree, is the best. :  
  
All sober enquirers after truth, ancient and ma  
dern, pagan and Christian, have deciared that the  
happiness of man, as well as his dignity consists in  
virtue. Confucius, Zoroaster, Socrates, Mahomet,  
  
‘not to mention autherities reaily sacred, have agreed  
  
in this.  
If there is a form of government then, whose  
  
principle and foundation is virtue, will not every

Honour is truly sacred, but holds a lower rank  
  
ir the scale of moral excellence than virtue.—In-  
  
deed the former is but a part of the latter, and  
consequently has not equal pretensions to suppor!  
a frame of government productive of human hap-  
piness.  
  
The foundation of every governmentis some prin-  
  
ciple or passion in the ininds of the people. —The  
noblest principles and most generous affections in  
our nature then, have the fairest chance to suppor!  
the noblest and most generous models of govern-  
ment.  
  
A man must be indifferent to the sneers of mo-  
dern Englishmen, to mention in their company, the  
names of Sidney, Harrington, Locke, Milton, Ned-  
ham, Nevilie, Burnet, and Hoadley.—No small fort.  
tude is necessary to confess that one has read them.  
The wretched condition of this country, however,  
for ten or fifteen years past, has frequently re-  
minded me of their principles and reasonings.—  
They will convince any candid mind, that there is  
no good government but what is republics. That  
the only valuable part of the British constitution is  
so; because the very definition of a republic, is  
‘an empire of laws, and not of men.” ‘That, as a re-  
public is the best of governments, so that particu-  
lar arrangement, of the powers of society, or in  
other words that form of government, which 1s  
best contrived to secure an impartial and exact ex-  
ecution of the laws, is the best of republics.  
  
Of republics, there is an inexhaustible variety,  
because the possible combinations of the powers of  
society, are capable of innumerable variations.  
  
As good government, is an empire of laws, how  
shall vour laws be made? In a large society, mha-  
biting an extensive country, it is impossible that  
the whole should assemble, to make laws: The  
first necessary step then, is, to depute power from  
the many, to a few of the most wise and good.—  
But by what rules shall you choose your represen-  
tatives? Agreé upon the number and qualifications  
of persons, who shall have the benefit of choosing,  
or annex this privilege to the inhabitants of a cer-  
tain extent of ground.  
  
‘The principal difficulty hes, and the greatest  
care should be employed in constituting this repre-  
sentative assembly. It should be in mimiature, an  
exact portrait of the people at iarge. It should  
think, feel, reason, and act like them. That it  
may be the interest of this assembly to do strict  
justice at all times, it should be an equal represen-  
tation, or m other words equal interest among the  
people should have equal interest in it—Great care  
s.wuld be taken to etfect this, and to prevent unfair,  
partial, and corrupt elections. Such regulations,  
however, may be better made in times of greater  
tranquility than the present, and they wii spring  
up of themselves naturally, whea all the powers of  
covernment come to be in the hands of the peanle’s  
friends. At present it will be safest to proceed in  
aii established modes to which the people have been  
familiarised by habit.  
  
A rvepreseiitation of the people in one assembly  
lxcing obtained, a question arises whether all the  
pewers of government, legislative, executive, and  
mtcicial, shall be ieftip this body? I think a peo-  
file cannot be long free, nor ever happy, whose go-  
vernment isin one assembly. My reasons far this  
opinion are as follow:  
  
1. A single assembly is liable to all the vices,  
follies and frailties of an individual.—Subject to  
fits of humor starts of passion, flights of enthusi-  
asm, partialities of prejudice, and consequently  
productive of hasty results and absurd judgments:  
  
And allthese errors ought to be corrected and de,  
fec\s supplied by some controling power.  
  
2. A single assembly is apt to be avaricious, and  
in time will not scruple to exempt itself from bur-  
thens which it will lay, without compunction, on  
its constituents.  
  
3. A single assembly is apt to grow ambitious,  
and ufter a time will not hesitate to vo‘e itself per.  
petiral, This was one fuuit of the long parliament,  
but more remarkably of Holland, whose assembly  
first voted themselves from annual to septenmai,  
then for life, and after a course of years, that all  
vacancies happening by death or otherwise, should  
be filled by themselves, without any application to.  
constituents at ail.  
  
4. A representative assembly, although extreme.  
ly well qualified, and absolutely necessary as a  
‘ranch of the legislature, is unfit to exercise the  
executive power, for want of two,essential proper-  
ties, secrecy and despztch. ,  
  
5. A representative ass¢mbly, is still less qualifi-  
ed for the judicial power; because it 1s too numer.  
ous, too slow, and too little skilled in the laws.  
  
6. Because a single assembly, possessed of all  
the powers of government, would make arbitrary  
laws for their own interest, execute all laws arbi-  
trarily for their own imterest, and adjudge all con-  
troversies in their own favor.  
  
But shall the whole power of legislation rest in  
one assembly? Most of the foregoing reasons ap-  
ply equally to prove that the legislative power  
ought to be more complex—to which we may add,  
that if the legislative power is wholly in one assem-  
bly, and the executive in another, or in a single  
person, these two powers will oppose and encroach  
upon each other, until the contest shall end in war,  
and the whole power, legislative and executive, be  
usurped by the strongest.  
  
The judicial power, in such case, could not me:  
diate, or hold the balance between the two contend-  
ing powers, because the legislative would under-  
mine it.—And this shews the necessity too, of giv-  
ing the executive power a negative upon the legis-  
lative, otherwise this will be continually encroach-  
ing upon that.  
  
To avoid these dangers let a distinct assembly  
be constituted, as a mediator between the two ex-  
treme branches of the legislature, that which re-  
presents the people and that which is vested with  
the executive power.  
  
Let the representative assembly then elect by  
ballot, from among themselves or their constitu-  
ents, or both, a distinct assembly, which for the  
sake of perspicuity we will call a council. It may  
consist @f any number you please, say twenty or  
thirty, and sheuld havea free and independent ex-  
ercise of its judgment, and cansequently a negative  
voice in the legislature.  
  
‘These two bodies thus constituted, and made in-  
tegral parts of the legislature, let them unite, and  
by joint ballot choose a governor, who, after being  
stript of most of those badges of domination call-  
ed prerogatives, should have q free and indepeh-  
deni exercise of his judgment, and be made also  
an integral part of the legislature. This I know is  
liable to objections, and if you please you may  
make him only president of the council, as in Con  
necticut: But as the governor is to be invested with  
tthe executive power, with consent of council, !  
think he ought to have a negative upon the legisla-  
tive. If he is annually elective, as he ought to be,  
be will always have.so much reverence and affec-  
tion for the people, their representatives and count-  
‘cilors, that dithough you gire him an independent

ulleyiance; and it has become necessary to assume  
sovernment for our immediate security, the gover-  
nor, lieutenant rovernor, secretary, treasurer, com  
missary, atlorney-general, should be chosen by  
juint ballot, of both houses. And these and all  
other elections, especially of representatives and  
councillors, should be annual, there not being in  
the whole circle of the sciences, a maxim more  
infallibie than this, “where annual elections end,  
there slavery begins.”  
  
These great men, in this respect should be, once  
a yeur  
  
“Like bubbles on the sea of matter borne, ’  
  
“They rise, they break, and to that sea return.”  
This will teach them the great political virtues of  
humility, patience, and moderation, without which  
every Man in power becomes a ravenous beast of  
prey. ;  
  
This mode of constituting the great offices of  
state will answer very well for the preseiit, but if;  
by experiment, it should be found incouvenicut,  
iue legislature may at its leisure devise other me-  
thods of creating them, by elections of the people  
ut large, as in Connecticut, or it inay enlarge the  
term for which they shall be chosen to seven years,  
or three years, or for life, or make any other alte-  
rations which the society shall find productive o:  
its éase, its safety, its freedom, or in one word its  
happiness. 4  
  
A rotation of all offices, as well as of represen-  
tatives and councillors, has many advocates, and is  
contended for with many plausible arguments. It  
would be attended no doubt with many advantages,  
and if the society has a sutlicient number of suita-  
ble characters to supply the great number of va-  
cancies which would be made by such a rotation,  
I can see no objection to it. These persons may be  
allowed to serve for three years, and then be ex-  
cluded three years, or for any longer or shorter  
term. ;  
  
Any seven or nine of the legislative council may  
be made a quorum, for doing business as a privy  
council, to advise the governor in the exercise of  
the executive branch of power, and in all acts of  
state.  
  
The governor should have the command of the  
militia, and of all your armies. ‘The power of par-  
dons should be with the governor and council.  
  
Judges, justices and all other officers, civil and  
military, should be nominated and appointed by the  
governor, with the advice and consent of council,  
unless you chouse to have a government more popu-  
tar; if you do, all officers, civil and military, may  
be chosen by joint ballot of both houses, ‘or in or-  
der tu preserve the independence and importance  
ef each house, by ballot of one house, concurred  
by the other. Sheriffs should be ‘chosen by the  
{teeholders of counties—~so should registers of  
deeds and clerks of counties.  
  
All officers should have commissions, under the  
tiand of the governor and seal of the colony.  
  
The dignity and stability of government in all  
its branches, the morals of the people and ¢very  
Dlessing of society, depends so much upon an up-  
right and skillful administration of justice, that  
the judicial power ought to be distinct from both |  
the legislative and executive, and independent up-  
  
estates for life in their offices, or in other words  
their commissions should be during good behaviour,  
and their salaries ascertained and established by  
law. For misbehaviour the grand inquest of the  
colony, the house of representatives, should im-  
peach them before the governor and council, where  
they should have time and opportunity to make  
their defence, but if convicted shoukl be removed  
from their offices, and subjected to such other pu-  
nishment as shall be thought proper.  
  
A militia law requiring all men, or with very  
few exceptions, besides cases of conscience, to be  
provided with arms and ammunition, to be trained  
at certain seasons, and requiring counties, towns,  
or other small districts to be provided with public  
stocks of ammunition and entrenching utensils,  
and with some settled plans for transporting provi-  
sions after the militia, when marched to defend  
their country against sudden invasions, and re-  
quiring certain districts to be provided with field-  
pieces, companies of matrosses, and perhaps some  
regunents of light horse is always a wise institu-  
tion, and in the present circumstances of our coun-  
try indispensable.  
  
Laws for the liberal education of youth, especial-  
ly of the lower class of people, are so extremely  
}wise and useful, that to a humane and generous  
mind, no expence for this purpose would be thougkt  
extravagant.  
  
The very mention of sumptuary laws will excite  
a smile. Whether our countrymen have wisdom  
and vittue enough to submit to them I know not.  
But the happiness of the people might be greatly  
promoted by them, and a revenue saved sufficient  
to carry on this war forever. Frugality is a great  
revenue, besides curing us of vanities, levities and.  
fopperies which are real antidotes to all great, man-  
ly and warlike virtues.  
  
But must not all commissions run in the name  
of a king? No. Why may they not as well run  
thus, “The colony of to A. B. greeting,”  
atid be tested by the governos?  
  
Why may not writs, instead of running in the  
name of the king, run thus, “the colony of  
to the sheriff,” Sc. and be tested by the chief jus-  
tice.  
  
Why may not indictments conclude “against the  
peace of the colony of and the dignity oz  
the same?”  
  
A constitution, founded on these principles, in.  
troduces knowledge among the people, and inspires  
them with a conscious dignity, becoming freemen.  
A general emulation takes place, which causes good.  
humor, sociability, good manners, and good morals  
to be general. ‘That elevation of sentiment, ins  
spired by such a goverament, makes the common  
people brave and enterprising. That ambition  
Which is inspired by ‘it makes them sober, indus-  
trious and frugal. You will find among them some  
elegance, perhaps, but more solidity; a little plea-  
sure, but a great deal of Business—some politeness,  
but more civility. Ifyou compare such a country  
with the regions of domination, whether monarchi-  
cal or aristocratical, you will fancy yourself in Ar-  
cadia‘ or Elisium.
