unty of Suffolk; held at Milton, in which a numerous list of resolutions was passed and transmitted to Congress. The greivances enumerated in these resolutions, are declared to be “gross infractions of those rights, to which we are justly entitled by the laws of nature, the British Constitution and the charter of the province;” and in conformity with this is the subsequent declaration in Congress, “that the inhabitants of the English Colonies in North America by the immutable laws of nature, the principles of the English Constitution, a&amp; the several charters or compacts, have the following rights.”  
“Resolved 1st: That they are entitled to life, liberty &amp; property; and that they have never ceded to any foreign power whatever, a right to dispose of either without their consent.  
2d. That our Ancestors, who first settled these Colonies, were at the time of their emigration from the mother Country entitled to all the rights, liberties and immunities of free and natural-born subjects within the realm of England.  
3d: That by such emigration they by no means forfeited, surrendered or lost any of those rights but that they were, and their descendents now are, entitled to the exercise and enjoyment of all such of them, as their local circumstances enable them to exercise &amp; enjoy.”  
“5th: That the respective Colonies are entitled to the Common law of England, and more especially to the great and inestimable privilege of being tried by their peers of the vicinage according to the course of that law.”  
These are some of the leading principles contained in those declarations, and they fully recognize the complete &amp; perfect existence of the Common law of England, and the Statute law also, so far as it was found consistent with &amp; applicable to the particular situation &amp; circumstances of the Colonies.

I find in 2 peer Williams, a memorandum dated August 1722 to the following effect. It was said by the Master of the Rolls to have been determined by the Lords of the privy council upon an appeal to the king in Council from the foreign plantations.  
“1st: That if there be a new and uninhabited Country found out by English subjects; as the law is the birth-right of every subject, so wherever they go, they carry their laws with them, and therefore such new found Country is to be governed by the laws of England; though after such Country is inhabited by the English, acts of parliament made in England without naming the foreign plantations, will not bind them, &amp;ca.”  
This rule has been recognized by an adjudication of Ch: Jus: McKean, in this State who gave it as the opinion of the Court, that “the Common law of England has always been in force in Pennsylvania; &amp; that all Statutes made in Great Britain, before the settlement of Pennsylvania, have no force here, unless the Colonies are particularly named.”
