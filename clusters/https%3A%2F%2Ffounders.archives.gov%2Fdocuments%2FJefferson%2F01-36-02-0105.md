he should evade. The French feared that the unconditional  
suppression of the second article would leave them still ex-  
posed to the claims of the United States without any chance  
to advance their counter-claims. They did not object to a  
mutual abandonment of claims, which, in the language of Mr.  
Murray, “ would always be a set-off agamst each other.”  
  
At last, on the 31st of July, 1801, the convention was rati-  
fied by Napoleon, then First, Consul, with the addition made  
by our Senate limiting it to eight years, and with the retrench-  
ment of the second article by our Senate—the whole with the  
proviso added by the First Consul * that by this retrenchment  
the two States renounce the respective pretensions, which are  
the object of the said article.”  
  
It was again returned to the United States, and Jefferson,  
who meanwhile had succeeded Adams as President, again  
submitted it to the Senate, which, on the 19th of December,  
1801, resolved “ that the Senate consider the said convention  
as fully ratified, and return it to the President for promul-  
gation.” It was accordingly promulged by the President,  
December 21st, 1801, and thus became the supreme law of  
the land in France and in the United States. Both countries  
were well out of a most troublesome and dangerous difficulty.
