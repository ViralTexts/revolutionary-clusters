Under this Persuasion it was natural for them to pray that he would not put them to such severe Trials.

as we forgive our debtors. And lead us not into  
temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine

On a subsequent occasion the disciples  
came to Jesus, and said to him: * Lord,  
teach us how to pray, as John also taught  
his disciples’’; and in answer to them he  
aaid, as reported in Luke&#x27;s Gospel, chapter  
ii, 2-4:  
  
“When ye pray, say, Our Father, which art

differ in words, without any difference in  
ideas, may be properly designated as the  
‘* Lord’s Prayer,’’ and, as such, an example  
or model of the kind of praying that befits  
human lips. The form, as found in the  
Sermon on the Mount, is the one in com-
