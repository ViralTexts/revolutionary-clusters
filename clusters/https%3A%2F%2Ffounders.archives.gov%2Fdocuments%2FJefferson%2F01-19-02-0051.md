The bill for establishing a National Bank undertakes, among other things  
  
1. to form the subscribers into a Corporation.  
2. to enable them, in their corporate capacities to receive grants of land; and so far is against the laws of Mortmain.  
3. to make alien subscribers capable of holding lands, and so far is against the laws of Alienage.  
4. to transmit these lands, on the death of a proprietor, to a certain line of successors: and so far changes the course of Descents.  
5. to put the lands out of the reach of forfeiture or escheat and so far is against the laws of Forfeiture and Escheat.  
  
6. to transmit personal chattels to successors in a certain line: and so far is against the laws of Distribution.  
7. to give them the sole and exclusive right of banking under the national authority: and so far is against the laws of Monopoly.  
8. to communicate to them a power to make laws paramount to the laws of the states: for so they must be construed, to protect the institution from the controul of the state legislatures; and so, probably they will be construed.  
  
I consider the foundation of the Constitution as laid on this ground that ‘all powers not delegated to the U.S. by the Constitution, not prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states or to the people’ [XIIth. Amendmt.]. To take a single step beyond the boundaries thus specially drawn around the powers of Congress, is to take possession of a boundless feild of power, no longer susceptible of any definition.  
The incorporation of a bank, and other powers assumed by this bill have not, in my opinion, been delegated to the U.S. by the Constitution.  
I. They are not among the powers specially enumerated, for these are  
  
1. A power to lay taxes for the purpose of paying the debts of the U.S. But no debt is paid by this bill, nor any tax laid. Were it a bill to raise money, it’s origination in the Senate would con demn it by the constitution.  
2. ‘to borrow money.’ But this bill neither borrows money, nor ensures the borrowing it. The proprietors of the bank will be just as free as any other money holders, to lend or not to lend their money to the public. The operation proposed in the bill, first to lend them two millions, and then borrow them back again, cannot change the nature of the latter act, which will still be a payment, and not a loan, call it by what name you please.  
3. ‘to regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the states, and with the Indian tribes.’ To erect a bank, and to regulate commerce, are very different acts. He who erects a bank creates a subject of commerce in it’s bills: so does he who makes a bushel of wheat, or digs a dollar out of the mines. Yet neither of these persons regulates commerce thereby. To erect a thing which may be bought and sold, is not to prescribe regulations for buying and selling. Besides; if this was an exercise of the power of regulating commerce, it would be void, as extending as much to the internal commerce of every state, as to it’s external. For the power given  to Congress by the Constitution, does not extend to the internal regulation of the commerce of a state (that is to say of the commerce between citizen and citizen) which remains exclusively with it’s own legislature; but to it’s external commerce only, that is to say, it’s commerce with another state, or with foreign nations or with the Indian tribes. Accordingly the bill does not propose the measure as a ‘regulation of trade,’ but as ‘productive of considerable advantage to trade.’  
  
Still less are these powers covered by any other of the special enumerations.  
II. Nor are they within either of the general phrases, which are the two following.  
  
1. ‘To lay taxes to provide for the general welfare of the U.S.’ that is to say ‘to lay taxes for the purpose of providing for the general welfare’. For the laying of taxes is the power and the general welfare the purpose for which the power is to be exercised. They are not to lay taxes ad libitum for any purpose they please; but only to pay the debts or provide for the welfare of the Union. In like manner they are not to do anything they please to provide for the general welfare, but only to lay taxes for that purpose. To consider the latter phrase, not as describing the purpose of the first, but as giving a distinct and independent power to do any act they please, which might be for the good of the Union, would render all the preceding and subsequent enumerations of power completely useless. It would reduce the whole instrument to a single phrase, that of instituting a Congress with power to do whatever would be for the good of the U.S. and as they would be the sole judges of the good or evil, it would be also a power to do whatever evil they pleased. It is an established rule of construction, where a phrase will bear either of two meanings, to give it that which will allow some meaning to the other parts of the instrument, and not that which would render all the others useless. Certainly no such universal power was meant to be given them. It was intended to lace them up straitly within the enumerated powers, and those without which, as means, these powers could not be be carried into effect. It is known that the very power now proposed as a means, was rejected as an end, by the Convention which formed the constitution. A proposition was made to them to authorize Congress to open canals, and an amendatory one to empower them to incorporate. But the whole was rejected, and one of the reasons of rejection urged in debate was that then they would have a power to erect a bank, which would render the great cities,  where there were prejudices and jealousies on that subject adverse to the reception of the constitution.  
2. The second general phrase is ‘to make all laws necessary and proper for carrying into execution the enumerated powers.’ But they can all be carried into execution without a bank. A bank therefore is not necessary, and consequently not authorised by this phrase.  
  
It has been much urged that a bank will give great facility, or convenience in the collection of taxes. Suppose this were true: yet the constitution allows only the means which are ‘necessary’ not those which are merely ‘convenient’ for effecting the enumerated powers. If such a latitude of construction be allowed to this phrase as to give any non—enumerated power, it will go to every one, for these is no one which ingenuity may not torture into a convenience, in some way or other, to some one of so long a list of enumerated powers. It would swallow up all the delegated powers, and reduce the whole to one phrase as before observed. Therefore it was that the constitution restrained them to the necessary means, that is to say, to those means without which the grant of the power would be nugatory.  
But let us examine this convenience, and see what it is. The report on this subject, page 3. states the only general convenience to be the preventing the transportation and re-transportation of money between the states and the treasury. (For I pass over the increase of circulating medium ascribed to it as a merit, and which, according to my ideas of paper money is clearly a demerit.) Every state will have to pay a sum of tax-money into the treasury: and the treasury will have to pay, in every state, a part of the interest on the public debt, and salaries to the officers of government resident in that state. In most of the states there will still be a surplus of tax-money to come up to the seat of government for the officers residing there. The payments of interest and salary in each state may be made by treasury-orders on the state collector. This will take up the greater part of the money he has collected in his state, and consequently prevent the great mass of it from being drawn out of the state. If there be a balance of commerce in favour of that state against the one in which the government resides, the surplus of taxes will be remitted by the bills of exchange drawn for that commercial balance. And so it must be if there was a bank. But if there be no balance of commerce, either direct or circuitous, all the banks in the world could not bring up the surplus of taxes but in the form of money. Treasury orders then and bills of  exchange may prevent the displacement of the main mass of the money collected, without the aid of any bank: and where these fail, it cannot be prevented even with that aid.  
Perhaps indeed bank bills may be a more convenient vehicle than treasury orders. But a little difference in the degree of convenience, cannot constitute the necessity which the constitution makes the ground for assuming any non-enumerated power.  
Besides; the existing banks will without a doubt, enter into arrangements for lending their agency: and the more favourable, as there will be a competition among them for it: whereas the bill delivers us up bound to the national bank, who are free to refuse all arrangement, but on their own terms, and the public not free, on such refusal, to employ any other bank. That of Philadelphia, I believe, now does this business, by their post-notes, which by an arrangement with the treasury, are paid by any state collector to whom they are presented. This expedient alone suffices to prevent the existence of that necessity which may justify the assumption of a non-enumerated power as a means for carrying into effect an enumerated one. The thing may be done, and has been done, and well done without this assumption; therefore it does not stand on that degree of necessity which can honestly justify it.  
It may be said that a bank, whose bills would have a currency all over the states, would be more convenient than one whose currency is limited to a single state. So it would be still more convenient that there should be a bank whose bills should have a currency all over the world. But it does not follow from this superior conveniency that there exists anywhere a power to establish such a bank; or that the world may not go on very well without it.  
Can it be thought that the Constitution intended that for a shade or two of convenience, more or less, Congress should be authorised to break down the most antient and fundamental laws of the several states, such as those against Mortmain, the laws of alienage, the rules of descent, the acts of distribution, the laws of escheat and forfeiture, the laws of monopoly? Nothing but a necessity invincible by any other means, can justify such a prostration of laws which constitute the pillars of our whole system of jurisprudence. Will Congress be too strait-laced to carry the constitution into honest effect, unless they may pass over the foundation-laws of the state-governments for the slightest convenience to theirs?  
The Negative of the President is the shield provided by the constitution to protect against the invasions of the legislature 1. the  rights of the Executive 2. of the Judiciary 3. of the states and state legislatures. The present is the case of a right remaining exclusively with the states and is consequently one of those intended by the constitution to be placed under his protection.  
It must be added however, that unless the President’s mind on a view of every thing which is urged for and against this bill, is tolerably clear that it is unauthorised by the constitution, if the pro and the con hang so even as to balance his judgment, a just respect for the wisdom of the legislature would naturally decide the balance in favour of their opinion. It is chiefly for cases where they are clearly misled by error, ambition, or interest, that the constitution has placed a check in the negative of the President.  
  
Th: Jefferson Feb. 15. 1791.  
  
  
  
Though the constitution controuls the laws of Mortmain so far as to permit Congress itself to hold lands for certain purposes, yet not so far as to permit them to communicate a similar right to other corporate bodies.

undertakes, among other things,*  
1. To form the subsvib- rs into a corpora­

Lwsof Distribution.  
7. l*o give them the strie and exclusive rig i  
ol banking under ihe national authority ; and  
-o far, ia against the laws of Monopoly.  
8. l o communicate to them a power to make  
aws paramount to theliwsof the Sta’.e; for  
- &gt; bey must be construed, to pro-ect *he iosti­  
turion from the control of thi* S ate legislatures;  
it.,1 so, probably, th; y will be cons rued.  
I consider &#x27;he Toon Llion of the constitution  
a laid on this ground, -hat “ all powets not  
ib lega-cd io the United States by the cons itu­  
;ion, nor prohibited by i: to the States, are re­  
-ci veil to the S.a * w or to the people.” (Twelfth  
amendment) t o take a single step beyond the  
boundaries thus specially drawn around th*­  
p.-wrs of Co»*.gr*ss, .s to i. ke possession of a  
bound.evS h*Vd of bower, no longer susetntibi.  
  
of «ny d*-fini ion.  
The incorporation of a bank, and-the powers  
assumed by this bill, h;ive not, in my opinio ,  
been de&#x27;egatrd 10 the United States by ihe  
constitution.  
I. They are no* among the powers specially  
enumerated Fo- these are,  
1. A power to tan taxes for the purpose of  
paving me debts of the United States. But no  
debt is paid by thi-, bill, nor anv a* laid, Werr  
it a bill o raise mon&lt; vs, its origination in the  
Senate would condemn it by the constitution.”  
2 To “ borrow money.” BiCt this bill nei­  
ther borrows money, nor insures the borrowing  
it. The pcoprifors of ihe hank will be just as  
free as any other money holder.-, to lend or not  
to lend their money to ihe public. The ope­  
raiion proposed in the bill, first 10 lend them  
two millions, and then borrow them back again,  
cannoi change the nature of the latter act,  
which will s&#x27;ill be a payment and not a loan,  
call ii bv what name you please.  
3 “To regulate comm^rcr with foreign na­  
tions, and among the States, and with the In­  
dian tribes.” To erect a bank, and to regulate  
commerce, are very different acts. He who  
erects a bank, creates a “object of commerce  
in its bill.: to does he who makes a bushel of  
wheat, or digs a dollai out of the mines. Yet  
neither of these persons regulates commerce  
thereby. To make a thing which may be 1  
bought and sold, is not to prescribe regula- ;  
tions fot buying and telling. Besides, if ihis  
were an exercise of the power of regulating :  
commence, it would be void, as extending as  
much to ibe internal commerce of every State,  
as io its external. For the powci giv n to Con­  
  
\ •  
Slate, filial is lo say, of the commerce between  
citizen sod citizen,) which remains exclusively  
wiih its own legislature; hut to its txternal  
commerce only, that is to say, its commerce  
with another tatate, or with foreign nations, or  
with the Indian tribes Accordingly, the bill  
does not propose the measure ss a “ regulaiion  
of trade,” but as u productive of considerable  
ad van age to trade.”  
Still lrss are these powers covered by any  
other of the speci.,1 enumerations.  
if. Nor are they within either of the general  
phrases, which are the two following:  
l “ To lay taxes to provide for the gener­  
al welfaiC of the United S ate*;” that is to sav,  
“10 lay taxes for the purpose of providing for the  
general welfare ” For the laying of taxes is  
the power, and the general welfare the purpose  
for which the pow* r is to h. exercised Cun­  
press arc not i*&gt; lay .axes, nd Itbiltjin for any  
vwpose they pie use: hu’ only to pay the debts, or  
provide for the welfare of the Union. In &#x27;ike  
mariner, they .re not not to do any thing they  
please, &#x27;o provide for the general welfare, but  
only to lay taxes ror that purpose. Io consider  
tile latter phr .se, not as describing thepurpo^  
of the firs , but as giving a distinct and inde­  
pendent DOW c to d- anv ac&#x27; hey please, which  
tnighi be for the good of the Union would  
render all the preceding and subsequent enu­  
tneraiiuns of puwer completely useless.. It  
would reduce the whole ius&#x27;rument to a single  
phrase, that of ins&#x27;iiuting a Congress * with  
power to do whatever would be for the good of  
the United Siaus; and as thry would he the  
sole judges of the good «r evil, it would b? also  
a power to do what ever evil.they pleased. It  
i- an es .tblished iule of construction, where a  
phrase will heir either of two meanings, to  
give it that which will allow some meaning to  
the other parts &quot;f he insnument, and not &#x27;hat  
whirk will render nil ’tie otheis useless Cer­  
tainly, no such universal power was meant t«»  
be given them. I&lt; was intrntled &#x27;o lace them  
up struiily within liie enumerated powers, and  
those without which as means, those powers  
could not be cariied into effect. It is known  
lint the very power now proposed as a means  
was rejected as an enei&#x27;iy the convention which  
formed the constitution. A proposition was  
  
made to them, to authorise Congress to open  
canals, and an amendatoiy one, to empower  
them t.i inccrpoia c, Bui the whole was re­  
jected; and one of the reasons of rejection urg­  
ed in the debate was, that they then would  
have a power to erect a bank, which would  
render the great cities, where there were preju  
dices and jealousies on the subject, adverse to  
the reception of the constitution  
2. The second gtneral phrase is, ‘ to make  
all laws necessary, and proper for carrying into  
execu.ion the enumerated powers.’ But they  
can all he carried m o tx-cutinn without a  
bank. A bank, therefore is not necessary, and  
consequently, not authorised by this phrase  
It has hern much urged, that a bank will give  
great facility ot convenience in ’he collet&#x27;ion  
c.r Suppose this weie true: yet the  
constitution allows noly the means which arc  
&#x27; necessary,’ no’ those which are m&lt; rely ‘con­  
venien*,* lot • (feeling ih« enumerated powers.  
U such a latitude of ron» rucli.n be allowed  
to this plna«t. ja iv&gt; give a .y non-enumeraied  
power, j; wi-1 go •feveiy one; for there ts no  
one whi. h ingenuity may noi tortuie in&#x27;o a  
convenience , in some tiny or oilier, to some one of  
so long a li-&gt;t of rnumei ao d powers It would  
swallow up all the oeiega rd powers, and re  
duce the whole to one phrase, as before obser­  
ved. Therefore it was that t o constitution re­  
strain d .hem to the necessary means, that is to  
sjv, io ihose means without which the grant  
of the power woutd be nugatory  
But le us eximine this ‘convenience,’ and  
sec what it i». &quot;1 he repor. on tins subject, page,  
2, s ates the only general convenience to be,  
me preventing &#x27;.he transportation and re trans­  
portation of money between the States and the  
treasury. (For I pa&lt;» over the increase of cir­  
cula&#x27;ing medit m ascrib-d to it as a merit, and  
which, according to my ideas of paper money,  
is clearly a demerit.) E»ery State will have  
to pay a sum of tax money into the treasury;  
*nd the treasury w ill have to pav, in every state,  
a pail of the io&#x27;erest on the public debt, and  
salaiies to the officers of government residing  
in that Stale. In most- of the S:ates, mere  
will still be a surplus of iax money to come up  
to the seal of government, for lh* officers re­  
siding there. The payments of interest and  
the salary in each fvta’e, may be made by treai  
suty orders on the State collector. This will  
lake up the greater part of ihe money he has  
collected in his State, and consequently pie­  
vent the great mass of it from being drawn out  
of the Stale. If there bi a balance of com­  
nvorro «•! f o U/SI&#x27; nf ikot nOMltlCt I \\s» nnp in  
  
which the government resides, the surplus of  
! f.ixes will be remitted by the bills of exchange  
drawn for that commercial balance. &#x27;And so  
it mus* be if thpie were a bank. But if there  
be no balance of commerce, either direct or  
circuitous, all the banks in the world could not  
bring us the surplus of taxes but in the form  
of money. Treasury orders &#x27;hen, and, bills of  
exchange may pievtm the displace merit *&gt;f the  
main m^ss of the money collected, vvithout ths  
aid of any bank: and where these fail, it Cannot  
be picvented, even with that aid  
Perhaps, indeed, bank bills may he a more  
convenient vehicle than treasury orders. But a  
little difference in the degree of convenience,  
cannot constitute the tiecessi’y which the con­  
stitution makes the ground for assuming any  
non-enumeraled power  
Besidesjthe existing batiks will without doubt,  
enter into arrangements for lending their agen­  
cy, and the more favourable, as there will be a  
competition among them for i:. Whereas  
this bill delivers us up bound to the Notional  
bank, who are free to refuse all arrangements  
but on theii own terms, and the public not free  
on such reiusal to employ any other bank.  
That of Philadelphia, I b« Iteve, now does this  
business b\ theii post notes,which by an arrange­  
ment with the treasury are paid by the State col­  
lector to whom&#x27;hey are presented. 1&#x27;his ex­  
pedient alone, suffices to prevent the existence  
of that necessity which may justify the as­  
sumption of a non-enumrraied power, as a  
means for carrying into an enumeiaud one.  
The thing may be done, and has been done, and  
well done wi&#x27;hout this assumption* therefore it  
does not stand on that degree of necessity which  
can honestly justify it. ^  
  
have a currency all over the Stales, would be  
more convenient than one whose currency is  
limited to a single State. So it would be still  
more convenient, that there should be a bank  
whose bills should have a currency all over the  
world. But it does not follow from this supe­  
rior convemency, that ih* re exists any where a  
powrr to esabish such a bank, or that the world  
may not go on very well without it.  
Can it be thought ihat the constitution in­  
tended, that for a shade or two of convcnicnct  
more or less, Congress should be authorized to  
breakdown the most ancient and fundamental  
laws of the several States, such as those against  
mortmain, the laws of alirnage, the rules of de­  
scent,the acts of distribution, the laws of escheat  
and f &gt;rf t ore, and Hi© laws of monopoly No­  
thing but a necessity invincible by any o her  
means, ran justify 6uch a prostration of laws,  
which cons&#x27;itute th» pillars of our whole system  
or jurisprudence Will Congress be too straight  
laced to carry the constitution into honest ef­  
fect, unless they may pas* over the foundation  
laws of the State government®, for thr slightest  
convenience of theirs?  
• The negative of the President is the shield  
provided by the constitution, to protect against  
thr invasion of the legislature, I. the rights of  
the Executive; 2 of &#x27;he Judiciary; 3. of the  
S utesand state legislatures. The present is &#x27;he  
case of a right remaining exclusively with the  
Eia es, and is, consequently, one of &#x27;hose intend­  
ed by the constitu-ion to be placed under his  
protection.  
It must be added ; however, that unless  
the Presidents mind, on a view of every thing  
which is urged for and against this bill, is tol­  
era&#x27;dy clear that it is unauthorized by the con­  
sti&#x27;uiion, if the pro and the con hang so even as  
to balance Iris j idgmeti&#x27;, a just respr ct for the  
wisdom of &#x27;he legislature naturally de­  
cide the bal »nre in favor of their q^inion.  
ft is chiefly for cases where they are clearly  
misled by error, or ambition, or inttrest, that  
the constitution has pjaced a check in the neg­  
ative of the President.

The bill for establishing a National Bank, un­  
dertakes, among other things ...  
1. To form the subscribers into a corporation.  
2. To enable tiieru, in their corporate capaci­  
ties, to receive grants of land ; and so far, is  
jrgainst the laws ef Mortmain. .  
  
8. A Q make alien subscribers capable of hold&#x27;  
ing lands; and so far, is against tho laws of alkn  
age. &#x27;&#x27; ... . ..  
  
4. To transmit these lands, on the death of a  
proprietor, to a certain line of successors; and so  
  
ftr, changes the course of Descents.  
5. To out tho lands out of the reach of for  
  
feiture or escheat ; and so far is against the laws  
  
or Forfeiture and Escheat  
. 6. To transmit personal chattels to successors  
  
a a certain line ; and so far, is against the laws of  
  
JUtstribution.  
  
7. To give them tho sole and exclusive right  
of banking, un&#x27;ler the national authority ; and so  
far, is against the laws of Monopoly.  
3. To communicate to them a power to make  
laws paramount to the laws of the State; for so  
  
they must be construed to protect the institution  
  
from tho controul of the state Legislatures ; and  
  
SO, probably, they will be construed.  
  
I consider the foundation of the Constitution  
  
as laid on this Ground : that &quot;all powers not do  
  
legated to the United States by the Constitution,  
  
nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to  
  
the States or to the People.&quot; Twelfth amend­  
ment. To take a single step beyond the boun  
  
daries thus specially drawn around the powers of  
  
Congress, is to take possession of a boundless  
  
held of power, no longer susceptible of any de  
finition. ,  
  
The incorporation of a Bank, and the powers  
assumed by this bill, have not, in my opinion,  
  
seen delegated to the United States by the Con  
titqtion.  
  
1 They are not among the powers specially  
  
enumerated. For these are  
  
J. A power -to ay taxes for the purpose of  
  
paying the debts of the United Mates. But no  
debt is paid by this bill, nor any tax laid. Were  
it a bill to raise moneys, its origination in the Se  
  
nate &quot;would condemn it by the Constitution.  
&quot;2. To &quot;borrow money.&quot;. But this bill nei  
  
&#x27; ther borrows money, nor insures the borrowing it.  
The proprietors of the Bank will be just as free  
  
as any other money holders to lend or not to  
  
lend their money to the public, 1 he operation  
  
proposed in the bill, first to lend them two mil  
  
lions, and then borrow them back again, cannot  
Change the nature of the latter act, which will  
still be a payment and not a loan, call it by what  
  
name you piease.  
. 3. &quot; To regulate commerce with foreign na­  
tions, and among the States, and with the Indian  
  
tribes.&quot; To erect a Bank, and to regulate com  
  
merce, are very different acts, lie who erects a  
Bank, creates a subject of commerce in its bills :  
  
So does he who makes a bushel of wheat, or digs  
  
- a dollar out of the mines. Yet neither of ..these  
persons regulates commerce thereby. To make  
a thing which may bo bought and sold, is not to  
prescribe regulations for buying and selling. Be­  
sides, if this were an exercise of the power of re­  
gulating commerce, it would be void, as extend­  
ing es much to tbe internal commerce of every  
State, as to its eiternal. For the power given  
Jo Congress by the Constitution, does not ex­  
tend to the internal regulation of tbe commerce  
of a State, (that is to say, of the commerce be­  
tween citizen and citizen) which remains exclu­  
sively with its own legislature: but to its exter­  
nal commerce only, that is to say, its commerce  
with another-Stato, or with foreign nations, or  
with tho Indian tribes. Accordingly, the bill  
does not propose the measure as a &quot; regulation  
of trade,&quot; but as &quot;productive of considerable ad­  
vantage to trade&#x27;  
.. Still less are these powers covered by any  
otber of the special enumeration.  
II. Nor are they within cither of the general  
phrases, which are the two following:  
1 &quot;To lay taxes to provide for the general  
welfare of the United States ;&quot; that is to say, &quot;to  
fay taxes for tlifi purpose of providing for the  
general welfare.&quot; For the&#x27; laying of taxs is, the  
power, and the general welfare the purpose for  
which the power is to be exercised. Congress  
  
are not to lay taxes, ad libitum for any purpose  
they please : but only to pay the debts or pro­  
vide for the welfare of the Union. In like  
manner they are nor to do any thing they phase,  
to provide for the general welfare, but only to  
lay taut for that purpose. To consider the lat­  
ter phrase, not as describing the purpose of the  
first, bat as giving a distinct and independent  
power to do any act they pleaso which might bo  
tor the good of the Union, would render all the  
preceding and subsequent enumerations of power  
completely useless. It would reduce the whole  
instrument to a single phrase, that of instituting  
a Congress with power to do whatever would be  
for the good of the United States; and as they  
would bo the sole judges of the good or evil, it  
would be also a power to do whatever evil they  
pleased. It is an established rule of construc­  
tion, where a phrase will bear cither of two  
meanings, to give it that which will allow some  
meaning to the other parts of the instrument, and  
not that which will render all the others useless.  
Certainly, no such universal power was meant to  
be given them. It was intended to lace them  
up ftraitly within the enumerated powers, and  
ibqse without which as means, these powers  
could not be carried into effect. It is known that  
the very power now proposed as a means was re­  
jected as an end by the Convention which form­  
ed the Constitution. A proposition was made to  
them to authorise Congress to open canals, and  
an amendatory one, to empower them to incor­  
porate. But the whole was rejected ; and one of  
tbe reasons of rejection urged in the debate was,  
ihat tbey then would have power to erect a Bunk,  
which would render the great cities where there  
were prejudices and jealousies on the subject,  
adverse to the reception of the Constitution.  
2. The second genera! phrase is, &quot; to make  
all laws necessary and proper far carrying into

execution the enumerated powers.&quot; t But tbey  
eanva)l be carried, into execution without a Bank.  
A Eanfc, therefore, is not nrceisary, and&quot;, conse?  
quently, not authorised by this phrase. &#x27;  
It has been much urged, that a bank will give  
great facility or convenience in the collection of  
taxes. Suppose this were true ; yet the Con­  
stitution allows only the means which are &#x27;ne­  
cessary, not those which &#x27;are merely conve­  
nient, for effecting the enumerated powers. If  
such a latitude of construction be allowed to this  
phrase, as to give any non-enumerated power, it  
will go to every one: for there is no one which  
ingenuity may not torture into a convenience, in  
  
some way or other, to some one of so long a list of  
  
enumerated powers., It would swallow up all  
the delegated powers, and reduce&#x27; the whole to  
one phrase, as before observed. Therefore it was  
that the Constitution restrained them to the ne­  
cessary means, that is o say, to those means with­  
out which the grant of the power would be nuga­  
tory.But let us examine this &#x27; conveninee, and see  
what it is. .Tho report on this subject, page 2,  
states the only general conveninee to be, the pre­  
venting the transportation and re-transportation  
of money between the States and the Treasury.  
(For I pass over the increase o&#x27;f circulating me­  
dium ascribed to it as a merit, and which accord­  
ing to my ideas of paper money, is clearly a de  
  
merit.) Every Stato will have to pay a sum of  
  
tax money into tho treasury ; and the treasury  
will have to pay, in every State, a part of the in­  
terest on the public debt, and salaries to the of­  
ficers of Government, residing in that State. In  
  
most of the States, there will still be a surplus of  
  
tax money to come up to the soat of govern­  
ment, for the officers residing there. The pay­  
ments of interest and the salary in each State,  
may be made by treasury orders on the State  
  
collector. This will take up the greater part of  
  
the money ho lias collected in his state, and con­  
sequently prevent the great mass of it from being  
  
drawn out of the State. If there be a balance of  
  
commerce in favour of that State against the  
one in which the government resides, the surplus  
of taxes will be remitted by the bills of exchange,  
drawn for that commercial balance.&#x27; And so it  
must be if there were a bank. But if there be  
no balance of commerce, either direct or circui­  
tous, all the banks in the world could not bring  
us the surplus of taxes but in the form of money.  
Treasury orders, then, and bills of exchange,  
may prevent tho displacement of the main mass  
of the money collected, without the aid of any  
bank; and where these fail, it cannot be prevent­  
ed, even with that aid.  
Perhaps, indeed, bank bills may be n more con­  
venient vehicle than treasury orders. But a little  
difference in the degree of convenience, cannot  
constitute the necessity which the Constitution  
makes the ground for assuming anynon-enumerated  
power.  
Besides, the existing banks will, without doubt,  
enter into arrangements for lending their agency,  
and the moro favourable, as there will be a com­  
petition among them for it. Whereas this bill  
delivers us up bound to tho National bank, who  
are freo to refuse all arrangements but on their  
  
own terms, and tho public not free on such re  
i .i i rw r ri i  
  
lusai to employ any otner Dann. i nat oi rnita-  
  
delphia, I believe, now docs this business by  
  
their post notes, which, by an arrangement with  
  
tne treasury, are paid by .tho Mate collector to  
  
whom they are presented. This expedient alone  
  
suffices to prevent the existence of that necessity  
  
which mayjutiiy tho assumption of a non-enume  
  
rated power, as a means for carrying into ef­  
fect an enumerated one. ThS thing rnav be done,  
  
and has been done, and well done, without this  
  
assumption ; therefore it does not stand on that  
  
degree of necessity which can honestly justify it  
  
It may be said that a bank whose bills would  
  
have a currency nil over tho States, would be  
  
more convenient than one whoso currency is ii  
  
mited to a single State. So it would be still more  
  
convenient, that there should be a bank whose  
  
bills should have a currency all over the world.  
  
But, it does not follow, from this superior conve  
  
niency, that there exists any where a power  
to establish such a bank, or that the world may  
  
not go on very well without it.  
  
Can it be thought that the Constitution intend  
  
ed, that for a shade or two of convenience, more  
  
or less, Congress should bo authorized to break  
  
down the most ancient and fundamental laws of  
  
the several States, such as those against mortmain,  
tho laws of alienage, the rules of descent, the  
  
acts of distribution, the laws of escheat and for  
  
feiture, and tho laws of mohoply? Nothing but  
a necessity invincible by any other means, can  
justify such a prostration oflaws, which constitute  
  
the pillars of our whole system of jurisprudence.  
Will Congress be too straight laced to carry the  
constitution into honest effect, unless they may  
pass over the foundation laws of tho State go­  
vernments, for the slightest convenience of theirs?  
The negative of the President is the shield  
provided by tho constitution, to protect against  
the invasion of the legislature, 1, the rights of the  
Executive; 2, of the Judiciary ;&#x27; 3, of the States  
  
&amp; State Legislatures. The present is the case of  
  
aright remaining exclusively with the states, and  
is, consequently, one of those&quot; Intended by the  
constitution to be placed under his protection.  
It must be added, however, that unless the  
President&#x27;s mind, on a view of every thing which  
is urged for fnd against this bill, is tolerably  
clear that it is unauthorised by the constitution,  
if the pro and the con hang so even as to ba­  
Tanco his judgment, a just respect for the wis­  
dom of the legislature would naturally decide the  
balance in favour of their opinion. It is chiefly  
for cases where they are clearly misled by error,  
or ambition, or interest, that the constitution has  
placed a check in the negative of the President.  
THOMAS JEFFERSON.

differentacts. He who erects a bank, creates a sub-

if. Nor are they within either of the general phras-  
és, which are the two following:  
  
1. “To lay taxes to provide tor the general welfare  
of the U. States;” that is to say, ‘*to lay taxes for the  
| purpose of providing for the geveral weifare.” For the  
laying of taxes is the power and the general welfare  
| tha purpose lor which the power 1s to be exercised,  
  
congress are not to lay taxes, ad libitum for any pur-  
| pose they please: butouiy to pay the debts or provide for  
the welfare of the union, in like manner they are not  
  
_them back again, cannot change the nature of the  
  
st the laws of distri- | to do any thing they please, to provide for the genera!  
  
weliare, butonly to fay taxes for that purpose. To  
consider the latter phrase, not as describing the pur-  
pose of the first, but as givinga distinct and inde-  
pendent power to do any act they piease which  
might be tor the good of the union, would render al!  
the preceding and subsequent enumerations of pow-  
er completely useless. It would reduce the whole  
1ustrument toa singie phrase, that of instituting a  
  
| congress with power to do whatever wouid be for  
  
the guod of the United States; and as they would be  
the sole judges of the good or evil, it would be also  
a power tudo whatever evil they pieased. Itis an es-  
tavlished rule of construction, where a phrase will  
bear either of two meanings, to give it that which  
will allow some meaning to the other parts of the  
instrument, aod pot that which will render all. the  
olbers useless. Certainly no such universal POWer  
Was meant io be civen them li was intended to lace  
them up sts aightly within the enumerated powers, 22  
ihoSe withoOul which, as means, these powers could  
not be carried into effect. It is known that the very  
power hOW proposed as a means was rejected as an  
end, by the convention which formed the constitution.  
A pcopusition was made ito them to authorize con-  
Z£€S3 LO open canals, and an amendatory one, to em-  
power them toincorporate. But the whole was re-  
jected; and one of the reasons of rejection urged in  
the debate was, that they then would have power to  
erect a bank, which would render the great cities  
where there were prejudices and Jealousies oa the  
subject, adverse to the reception of the constitution.  
  
2. The second general phrase is “to make all  
LAWs eceesa U aiid proper for carrying into execu-  
tion the enumerated powers.”” But they’ can ail be  
carried into execution withont a bank. A bank,  
therefore, is not necessary, and, consequently, nes

It has been much urged, that |  
facility or convenience in the collection of taxes. |  
  
&#x27;  
  
Suppose this were true; yet the constitution allows}  
only the means which are ‘necessary,’ not those}  
which are merely ‘convenient,’ for effecting the enu- |  
merated powers. If such a Jatilude of construction  
be allowed to this phrase, as to give any non-enu-  
merated power, it will go to every one: for there is  
no one which ingenuity may not torture into a con-  
venience, in some way or other, fo some one of so long 2  
list of enumerated powers. It would swallow up)  
all the delegated powers, and reduce the whole to  
one phrase, as before observed. Therefore it was  
that the constitution restrained them to the necessary  
means, that is to say, that those means without which |  
the grant of the power would be nugatory.  
  
But let us examine this ‘convenience,’ and see  
what itis. Thereport on this subject, page 2, states  
the only general convenience to be, the preventing  
the transportation and re-transportation of money  
between the states and the treasury. (For i pass

to it as a merit, and which, according to my ideas of  
paper money, is clearly a demerit). Every state |  
will have to paya sum of tax money into the trea-|  
sury: and the treasury will have to pay, in every |  
state, a part of the interest on the public debt, and,  
salaries to the officers of government, residing in |  
that state. Jn most of the states, there will stil! be a |  
surplus of tax money to come up to the seat of go-|  
vernment, for the officers residing there. The pay-|  
ments of interest and the salary in each state, may |  
be made by treasury orders on the state collector  
This will take up the greater part of the money he|  
has collected in his state, and consequently prevent  
the great mass of it from being drawn out of the  
state. If there be a balance of commerce in favor  
of that state against the one in which the govern-  
ment resides, the surplus of taxes will be remitted  
by the bills of exchange drawn for that commercial  
balance. And soit must be if there were a bank.  
Bat if there be no balance of commerce, either di-  
rect or circuitous, all the banks in the world could  
not bring us the surplus of taxes but in the form of|  
money. Treasury orders, then, and bills of ex-)|  
change, may prevent the displacement of the main |  
  
mass of the money collected, without the aid of any |  
  
or  
  
bank: and where these fail, it cannot be prevented, |  
even with that aid.  
  
Perhaps, indeed, bank bills may be a more convenient |  
vehicle than treasury orders. Buta little difference!  
inthe degree of convenience, cannot constitute the,  
necessity which the constitution makes the ground)  
for assuming any non-enumerated power.  
  
Besides, the existing banks wil!, without donbt,}  
enter into arrangements for lending their agency,  
and the more favorable, as there will be a competi  
tion among them for it.  
us up bound to the national bank, who are free to!  
refuse ail arrangements but on their own terms, and |  
  
  
  
Whereas this bill delivers|  
  
the public not free, on such refusal, to emplov any&#x27;  
other bank. That of Philadelphia, I believe, now |  
floes this business by their post notes, which, by an  
arrangement with the treasury, are paid by the « inte |  
eoliector to whom they are presented. This |  
jient alone sutlices to prevent the existence

enumerated power, asa means for carrying into!

But it does not fol-  
low, from this superior conveniency, that there ex-  
ists any where a power to establish such a bank, or  
that the world may not go on very well without it.  
  
Sanit be thought thatthe constitution intended,  
that fora shade or two of convenience, more or less,  
congress should be authorized to break down the  
most ancient and fundamental laws of the several  
states, such as those against mortmain, the laws of  
atlienare. the rules of descent, the acts of distribu-  
tion, the Jaws of escheat and forfeiture, and the  
laws of monepoly? Nothing but a necessity invinci-  
ble by any other means, can justify such a prostra-  
tion of laws, which constitute the pillars of our  
whole system of jurisprudence. Will congress be  
too straight laced to carry the constitution into ho-  
nest effect, unless they may pass over the foundation  
laws of the state governments, for the slightest con-  
venience of theirs?  
  
The negative of the president is the shield pro-  
vided by the constitution, to protect against the in-  
vasion of the legislature, 1, the rights of the execu-  
tive; 2, of the judiciary; 3, of the states and state  
legislatures. The present isthe case of a right re-  
maining exclusively with the siates, and is, conse-  
quently, one of those intended by the constitution to  
be placed under his protection.  
  
It must be added, bowever, that unless the presi-  
dent’s mind, ona view of every thing which 1s urg-  
ed for and against this bill, is tolerably clear, that it  
is unauthorized by the constitution, if the pro and  
the con hang so even as to balance his judgment, a  
  
—_ ———  
  
| just respect for the wisdom of the legislature would  
  
naturally decide the balance in tavor of their opin-  
ion. It is chiefly for cases where they are clearly  
misled by error, or ambition, or interest, that the  
constitution has placed a check in the negative of  
the president. THOMAS JEPFERSON.

A proposition was made to authorize Congress to open canals,  
and an amendatory one, to empower them to incorporate for  
this purpose. But the whole was rejected, and one of the rea-  
sons of rejection urged in the debate, was that they would, in  
such case, have a power to erect a Bank; which would render  
the great cities where there existed prejudices and jealousies on  
the subject, adverse to the sandpeten of the Constitution.

II. Nor are they within either of the general phrases, which are  
  
the two following :  
  
1. “ To lay taxes, to provide for the general we!fare of the United  
  
States ;” that is to say, ** to lay taxes for the purpose of providing  
for the general welfare.” For the laying of taxes is the power, and  
the general welfare the purpose for which the power is to be exer-  
cised. Cuongre-s are not to lay taxes, a2 libitum, for any purpse they  
please, but only to pay the debts, or provide for the wifare of the Un=

In like manner, they are not to do any thing they please to provide  
  
for the general welfare ; but only to lay faves for that purpose. To  
consider the latter phrase not as describing the purpose of the first,  
but as giving a distinct and independent power te do any act they  
please which might be for the good of the Union, would render all

l lto bill lor establishing it National Bank, undertakes,  
among other things,  
I. I&#x27;o lot in (lie subscribers into a corporation.  
2. To enable litem, in their roipora e rapacities, lo re­  
ceive grants of lain!; anti so if«r, is against the laws ol  
.Mortmain.&quot;  
3. To make alitn subscribers capable of holding lands;  
and so far, is against the lawn of Alienage.

to a certain line ol successors; and so far, changes the

5. To put the lands out of the reach of forfeiture or es­

Escheat.  
  
6. To transmit personal chattels to successor* in a certain  
line; and sc l.ir, is against the laws of Distribution.  
7. To give them the sole and exclusive right ol bank­  
ing under the national authority; and so far, is against the  
laws of Afonpooly.  
8. To communicate to then) a power to moke laws pa­  
ramount to the laws ot the Stairs; for so they trust tie  
construed, to protect the institution from the con&#x27;rolol the  
State Legislatures; and so, probably, they will be con­  
strued.  
I consider the foundation of the Constitution as laid on  
this ground, that &#x27;all powers not delegated to the United  
Stales by (ho Constitution, nor piohibitcd hy it to the  
Slates, are reserved to the Stairs or to thr People’  
(Twelfth amendment.) To take a single step beyond the  
boundaries thus specially drawn around&#x27;(he powers ol  
Congress, is lo take possession ol a boundless field of pow­  
er, no longer susceptible ol any definition.  
The incorporation ol a hank, and the powers assumed  
hy this bill, have not, in my opinion, been delegated to (he  
U. States by the Constitution.  
I. They are uot among the powers specially enumerat­  
ed. For these are,  
1. A power to lay taxes for the purpose of paying the  
debts of the Untied Stales. Bui no debt is paid by this  
bill, nor any tax laid. Were it a lull to raise money, its  
origination in the Senate would condemn it by the Consti­  
tution.  
2. To ‘borrow money ’ Hut this bili neither borrows  
money, not insures the borrowing it The proprietors ol  
the bank will be just as tree as any other money holders,  
to lend or not to lend their money to the public. The ope­  
ration proposed in the bill, first n&gt; lend them two millions,  
and then borrow them back aga.n.&#x27;C-arruot change the na­  
ture of the latter act, which will still be a payment and  
not a loan, call it by what name you please.  
3. ‘To regulate commerce with foreign nations, and  
among the States, anil with the Indian -tribes.’ To erect a  
bank, and lo regulate commerce,*ve very different acts.  
He who erects a bank, creates a subject of commerce in  
its bills: so does he who makes a btishel of wheat, er digs  
a dollar out of the mines. Vet sieViher of these persons  
regulates commerce thereby. To make a thing which  
may he bought and sold, is not to prescribe regulations for  
buying and selling. Besides, if this were an enercise of  
the power ol regulating commerce, it would be void, as  
extending as much to the internal commerce of every State,  
as to its external. For, the power given to Congress by  
the Constitution, does not extend to the internal regulation  
ol the commerce of a State, (that is to say, of the com­  
merce between citizen and citizen.) whirl) remains exclu­  
sively with its own Legislature; but to its external com­  
merce only, that ia to say, its commerce with another  
Slate, or with foreign nation*, or with the Indian tribe*.  
Accordingly, the bill does not propose the measure ss a  
‘regulation ol trade,’ but as ‘productive of considerable ad­  
vantage lo trade.’  
Htill less are these powers covered by any other of the  
special enumerations.  
II. Nor are they within either of lb* general phrases  
which sre the (wo following:  
1. ‘To lay taxes to piovide for the genersl welfare of  
♦he United State*;’ that is to say, ‘m lay taxes for the pur­  
pose ol providing lor the general welfare.’ For the lay­  
ing ot taxes is the power, and the general welfare the  
purpose lor which the power i* to be exercised. Congress  
sre not to lay (axes, ad libitum, fur any purpose they  
please: hut only to pity the debts, or provide Jor the wel­  
fare of the Union. In like mariner, they ace nor to do  
any thing thaj please, to provide for the general welfare,  
but only to lay tares for that purpose. To consider the  
latter phrase, not as desrribmg rim purpose ot the first,  
but as giving a distinct ami independent power to do any  
act they please, which might be lor the good of the Union,  
would render all the preceding and subsequent enumera­  
tions of power completely useless. It would reduce the  
whole instrument to a single phrase, that of insiitu• i„c ,  
Congress with power to do whatever would be for the  
good of the United Htates; and as they would he the sole  
judges ol the good or evil, it would he also a power lo do  
whatever evil they pleased. It It m established rule of  
construction, where s phrase wilt hear either of two mean­  
♦i’ll .ogh tho Const,lotion control* the laws of Wormian, to fit  
as to permit Congress r&#x27;tolfto hold Isn&#x27;t for certain pnrpo*««, Vet nor  
so fin as to ssrinit them to sernmunisats a Sissl ar right to other eor­  
untat.i fmasl im  
  
in**, lo give it that which will allow wma meaning to the  
other par ts of the instrument, ami not that which will reti­  
tle&lt;- ^ ill.- oilier* u«ele-s. Certainly, no aurli utnverssl  
w«) meant to be given them. It wa« intended to  
U&lt;* iItem up tiraiily within the enumerated powers, and  
those wi&#x27;hout which, as means, these powers could not  
&#x27;•e carried into effect. It is known that tne very power  
now proposed as a means, was rejected as an end by the  
convention w hit It lormed &lt;he Constitution. A proposition  
was made lo them, to aullioriee Congress to open canals,  
and an amendatory one, lo empower them to iiwmpora&#x27;e.  
Hut the whole was rejected; and one ot the lessons ol ic  
jection urged in debate was, that they then would have a  
power to erect a bank, which would render the great cities  
where there were prejudices and jealousies on that sub­  
ject, adverse lo tho reception of the Constitution.  
2. The second general phrase is, &#x27;to make all laws tie*  
cessary and proper for carrying into execution the enutne­  
I rate I powers.’ Hut they can all he carried into exe­  
| ruliou without a hank. A bank, therefore, is not neces­  
sary. and consequently, not authorised by (his phrase.  
Il lias been murli urged, that a ha&lt; k will give great la*  
ciliiy or convenience m the collection ol taxes. Suppose  
tins were true: yet the Constitution allows only the  
means which are “necessary,’ not those which are merely  
&#x27;convenient,’ for effecting the enuint *ated powers. II  
such a latitude of construction he allowed lo this phrase,  
as to give any noti-c&#x27;iutnerated power, it w ill go to every  
one; for there is no one which ingenuity may not tortuie  
into a convenience, in some trey or other, to some one  
ol sntong a list ol enumerated powers. It would swallow  
up all tho delegated powers, ami reduce the whole tonne  
phrase as before observed. I hereto&#x27; e it w as, that the Con­  
stitution restrained them to ttie necessary means; tint is  
to sJy, to those meins, without which the grant ol the  
power would be nugatory.  
Hut let us examine tins &#x27;convenience,’ and see what it  
is. The report on this subject, page 2, states the only  
general convenience to he, the preventing the transports*  
t on and the re-transportation ol money be ween the  
States and the Treasury. (For t pass over the increase of  
circulating medium ascribed to it is a merit, and which,  
according to my idea of paper money, is clearly a deme­  
rit.) Fvrry Stale will have to pay a sum ol tax money  
into the Treasury; and the Treasury will have to pay, in  
every Slate, a pari of the interest on he public debt, and  
salaries 4* the officers ol Government resident in that Sla:c.  
In most o1 riie Sta&#x27;es, tlteie will still be a surplus ol tax mo­  
ney to come -up to the seat ol government, lor the officers  
residing there. The payments ol interest and salary in each  
btate, may be made by Trvusuiy ciders on the State col­  
lector. 3 lrt« will take up the greater part ol the money  
he has collected in his Stale, and consequently prevent  
the great mass ol it Iroiii being draw n out of the Slate.  
II there be a balance ol ciuiimeree in (avor of that Slate,  
against the one in which the Government resides, tlie sur­  
plus of laves will be remitted by (lie bills of exchange  
drawn for that commercial balance. And so it must il  
there were a bank. Hut it there be no bslauce ol com­  
merce, either direct or circuitous, all the banks In the  
wotld could not bring ns the surplus of (axes but In the  
lorm money. Treasury orders, then, and bills of ex­  
change may prevent the displacement ol the main mass oi  
the money collected, without the aijJ of any bank ; and  
where these fail, it cannot be prevented, even with that  
  
Perhaps, indeed, batik bill« may be a more convenient  
vehicle than Treasury orders. But a little difference in  
the degree cd convenience, cannot substitute the necessity  
&quot; Itich the Constitution makes the giouud lor assuming  
any non-enmnerated power.  
Besides; the existing Banks will, without doubt, enter  
into arrangements lor lending their agency, and the more  
favorable, as there will be a competition among them lor it.  
Whereas, this l«N d eh vers us up hound to the National  
Bank, who arc Irec to refuse all arrangement* but on their  
own terms, ami the public not free, on such refusal, to em­  
ploy any other bank. Th ,t ol Philadelphia, I believe, now  
doe, n.i« business by their post notes, which, bv an ar­  
rangement will, ,1,. ...asury, are paid by any State collec­  
tor to « bom they are present*,,. Ti.i, , xgedient alone  
suffices to prevent the exislence of that nccessu t/, wt.un  
may justify the assumption ol a lion-enumerated power, as  
a means for carrying into effect an enumerated one. The  
thing may be done, and has been done, and well done,  
without litis assumption; lltetefore, it does not stand on  
that degree ofnecessity which can honestly justify it.  
It may be said, that a Bank whose bills would have a  
curie,icy all over the Stales, would be more convenient  
Ilian one whose currency is limited to a single Stale. So,  
it would be still more convenient, that there should be 1  
Hank whose bill* should have a currency all over llie  
world But it dues not follow from this superior conve­  
niency, that there exists any where a power to establish  
such a Bank, or that die world may not go on very well  
without it.  
Can it he thought that the Constitution intended, that  
lor a shade or two ol convenience, more or less, Congress  
should he authorised to break down die most ancient and  
fundamental laws of the several Slates, such as dio.«c  
agunsi mortmain, the law s ol alienage, die rules ol de­  
scent, (he acls ol distribution, die law* ol escheat and for­  
feiture, and the laws of monopoly. Nothing tut a ueces­  
sity, invincible by any oilier means, ran justify such a  
prostration ol laws, which constitute the pillars of our  
whole system of jurisprudence. Will Congress be t&lt; o

The reasoning, upon which the constitutionality of a national  
bank is denied, turns upon the strict interpretation of the clause,  
giving aaxiliary powers, necessary and proper to execute the  
other enumerated powers. It is to the following effect. The  
power to incorporate a bank is not among those enumerated in  
the constitution. In the next place all the enumerated powers  
can be carried into execution without a bank.  
is not necessary, and consequently not authorized by this clause  
of the constitution. It is urged that a bank will give great fa-  
cility, or convenience to the collection of taxes. If this were  
true, yet the constitution allows only the means which are neces-  
  
merated powers. If such a latitude of construction were allowed,  
as to consider convenience as justifying the use of such means, it  
would follow up all the enumerated powers. ‘Theretore, the con-

tho enumerated pntvius, and liio-e willi ail ninth,  
as means, these powers could out be carried into  
effect. It is known that the very po er now propos  
ed as a means, was rejected at an end by the L (in­  
vention which framed the Constitution. A pro­  
position was made to them to authorize Congress  
to open canals, iiid an amendatory one, to em  
power them to incorporate, nut the vvtiole wa  
rejected: and one of the reasons urged in debute  
was, that tney then would have power to erect a  
bank, which would render the great cities, where  
there were prejudices and jealousies on that sub  
ject, adver.-e lo the reception of the constitution.  
&quot;2. I lie second general phrase is &#x27; to make  
all laws uccextrry and proper for carrying into  
effect the euuineiated powers.&#x27; But thty can ail  
be carritd into tjfect without a ban!:. A bank  
therefore is not nectssary and consequently not  
authorized by this phrase.  
&quot;It has been much urged that a Bank would  
give ureal facility or convenience in the Collec­  
tion of taxes. Suppose lliis were trut : )xt the  
constitution ullows only the means which are &#x27;ne­  
cessary,&#x27; not those which are merely coutnienf  
for effecting the e lUinerated powers. If such a  
latitude of construction be allowed to this phrase  
as to give any man enumerated power, it will go  
lo ecery one; for there is no one which ingenuity  
may not torture into a conreniertce in some way  
or other, to tome one, of so long a lixt of enumer  
oted powers. , &#x27;  
&quot;I l.would swallow up all the delezaltd powers

Secretary of State to Gen. Washington [see  
vol . 4, page 5J3 published correspondence J up-  
on the bill to charter the first Bank of the U.  
State?, a? early as 1791, shows that he contem-  
plated, and tlmt he describes, a Sub-Treasury  
system similar to the one now proposed ; he docs  
not intimate in his objection to the United  
States Bank, that these State banks should be  
jemployed farther than for the transmission of  
public moneys through bills of exchange or post  
notes :  
  
“Every Slate will have to pay a sum of (ax  
money into the Treasury, and the Treasury  
will have to pay in every State, a part of the  
interest on the public debt and salaries to the  
officers of Government resident in that State.  
In most of the State?, there will still be a sur-  
plus of tax mo wry to come up to the seat of  
Government for the officers residing there. The  
payments of interest and salary in each State,  
may he made by Treasury orders on the State  
collector. This will take up the greater part  
of die money tit- )m» collected in his State, and  
consequently prevent the greater mas? of it  
from being drawn out of the State. If there  
be a balance of commerce in favor of that State  
against the one in which the Government re-  
side?, the surplus of taxes will he remitted hy  
ihe hills of exchange drawn for that commer-  
cial balance. And so it must be if there were  
a hank ; hut if there bo r.o balance of commerce,  
cither direct or circuitous, all the banks in the  
world could not bring us the surplus of taxes  
hut in the form of money. Treasury orders,  
then, ami bills of exchange, may prevent the  
displacement of the main mass of the money  
collected, without the aid of any bank; and  
where these fail, it can not he prevented even  
with that aid.”

On this subject we quote a short paragraph  
from Mr. Jefferson, with which we close our re­  
marks for the present.  
“It may be said, that a bank, whose bhills would  
have currency all over the States, would be more  
convenient than one whose currency is limited  
to a single state. So it would be more conven­  
ient that there should be a bank whose Dbills  
should have a currency all over the world. But  
it does not follow from this superior convenien­  
cy, that there exists any where a power to esta­  
blish such a bank, or that the world may not go  
on very well without it.”  
  
The eflitor of the Patriot insists that Ports­  
mouth is in the Srate of Maine. If he would  
only talk so when the apportionment of the  
State tax is made, he might be of some benefit  
to us, but under present circumstances his good  
intentions are rather to be doubted. We suspect

writing,  
as to its constitutionality. The Secretary of State, and  
Attorney-General, were of opinion, that the bill was  
tmconstitutional, while the Secretaries of the Trea­  
sury and War were of a different opinion, and concur­  
red with the majority in Congress. Mr. Jefferson was  
deciQHjy nnd warmly opposed to this institution, not  
only on t^count of its unconstitutionality, but on ac-;  
count of tht danger to be apprehended to Governmeut i  
from the exorbitancy of its power, nnd the injury which  
it might inflict on &quot;oniniunity. The following is his  
official opinion on the constitutional question­  
The bill for establishing a National Bank, under-1  
takes, among other things,  
1. To form the subscribers into u corporation.  
2. l o enable them, in their corporate capacities, to  
riCC.Te grants of land: and so far is against the laws of  
Mortmain.  
3. To mnfce alien snl??oribcrs caoalilei&gt;f.,in&#x27;&#x27;,:~ ~&#x27;  
and so farjfig&#x27;nyK these lands, on the death of a propri­  
4. to a certain line of successors; and so far changes  
the course of descent*.  
5. To put the lands out of the reach of forfeiture and  
escheat; and so far is against the laws of forfeiture and i  
escheat.  
6. To transmit personal chattels to successors in n j  
certain line; and so far is against the laws of distribu-\
tion.  
7. To give them the sole and exclusive right of bank-!  
ing under the natioual authority; and so far is against  
the laws of monopoly.  
8. To communicate to them a power to make laws  
paramount to the laws of the States; for so thev must  
be construed, to protect the institution from the control  
of the State Legislatures: and so, probably, they will  
be construed.  
I consider the foundation of the Constitution as laid  
on this ground, that &quot;all powers not delegated to the U.  
S. by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States,  
are reserved to the States or to the people.&quot;?(Twelfth  
amendment.) To take a single step beyond the bound­  
aries thus specially drawn around the powers of Con­  
gress is to take possession of a boundless field of power,  
no longer susceptible of any definition.  
The incorporation of a Bank, and the powers assumed  
by this bill, have not, in my opinion, been delegated to  
the United States by the Constitution.  
I. They are not among the powers specially enume­  
rated. For these are:  
1. A power to lay taxes for the purpose of paying the  
debts ol the United States. But no debt is paid by this  
bill, nor any tax laid. Were it a bill to raise money,  
its origination iu the Senate would condemn il by the  
Constitution.  
Ji. To &quot;borrow money.&#x27;&#x27; But this bill neither bor­  
rows money, nor insures the borrowing it. The pro­  
prietors of the Bank will be just as free as any other  
money-holders, to lend or not lend their money to the  
public. The operation proposedfin the bill, first to j  
lend them two millions, and then borrow them back j  
again, cannot change the nature of the latter net, which 1  
Will still be a payment, and not a loan, call it bv what j  
name you please.  
  
3. &quot;To regulate commerce with foreign nations, and  
among the States, and with the Indian tribes.&quot; To  
enact a bank, and to regulate commerce, are two very  
different acts, lie who erects a bank creates a subject  
of commerce in its hills; so does he who makes a  
bushel of wheat, or digs a dollar out of the mines.?  
Yet neither of these persons regulates commerce there­  
by. To make a thing which may be bought and sold,  
is not to prescribe regulations for buying and selling.  
Besides, if this were an excess of the power of regu­  
lating commerce, it would be void, as extending as  
much to the internal commerce of every State as to its  
external; for the power given to Congress by the Con­  
stitution does not extend to the internal regulation of  
the commerce of a State, (that is to say, of the com­  
merce between its citizens,) which remains exclusive­  
ly within its own Legislature, but to its external com­  
merce only; that is to say, its commerce with another  
State, or with foreign nations,or with the Indian tribes.  
Accordingly, the bill does not propose the measure as  
a &quot;regulation of trade,&quot; hut as &quot;productive of consi­  
derable advantage to trade.&quot;  
Still less are these powers covercd by any other of the  
  
special enumerations.  
II. Nor are they with either of the general phrases,  
which are the two full-swing:  
1. &quot; To lay taxes to provide for the general welfare of  
the United Statesthat is to say, &quot; to lay taxes for the  
purpose of providing for the general welfare;&quot; lor the  
laying of taxes is the power, and the general welfare  
the purpose for which the power is to he exercised.?  
Congress are not to lay taxes ad libitum, for any pur­  
pose they please, but only to pay the debts or protidr  
jot the welfare of the Union. In like manner, tiiey are  
not to do any thing they please to provide for the gene­  
ral welfare, but only to lay taxes for the purpose. To  
consider the latter phrase, not as describing the pur­  
pose of the first, bnt as pivin? a distinct and indeoen­  
  
dent power to do any act they please which might be for  
the good of the Union, would render all the preceding  
and subsequent enumerations of power completely  
useless: It would reduce the whole instrument to a  
Mingle phrase, that of instituting a Congress with the  
power to do whatever would be for the good of the U.  
fcj. As they would be the 6ole judges of the good or  
*Til, it would be also a power to do whatever evil they  
pleased. It is an established rule of construction, when  
a phrase will bear either of two meanings, to give it  
Ibat which will allow some meaning to the other parts  
ofthe instrument,and not that which will render all the  
others useless. Certainly no such universal power was  
meant to be given them. It was intended to lace them  
up straight)^ within the enumerated powers, and those  
without which, u means, these powers could not be  
  
carried into effect. It U known that the very power  
now proposed in a means, vviis rejected ?.&lt; an rntl by the  
Convention which formed (lie Constitution. A piopo­  
s&#x27;.tion wan made tothem to authorize Congress to open  
[ canals, and an amendatory one, to empower them to  
&#x27; incorporate. Bat the whole waj injected; and (.no of  
the reasons of rejection urged in tiie deltaic wan, that  
they then would have a power to erect a hank v. hii li  
would render the great cities, where there were prejudi­  
ces and jealousies on that subject, adverse to tiie rccep­  
  
tion of the Constitution.  
ii. The second general phrase, is. &quot;to make ::!! la&#x27;.v?  
ncctssary anil proper for carrying into execution the  
enumerated powers.&quot; But they can all be carrier) into  
execution without a bank. A hauls therefore is n.&lt;t  
ntrcssartj, and consequently not authorised !?y this  
phrase.  
It has been much urged that a bank will give great  
facility or convenience to the collection of taxes. Sup­  
pose this was true; yet the Constitution allows only  
the means which are &quot;necessary,&quot; not those which are  
merely &quot;convenient,&quot; for effecting the enumerated  
powers. If such a latitude of construction be allowed  
to this phrase as to give any non-enumerated power,  
it will go to every one: for there is no one which inge­  
nuity may not torture into a eonrcnience, in same ir/nj  
or other, to some one of so long n list of enumerated  
powers. It would swallow up all delegated powers  
and reduce the whole to one phrase, ns before observed.  
Therefore it was, that the Constitution restrained them  
to the nceessarjf means, that is say, to those means  
without which the grant of the power would be nuga­  
  
lory.  
But let us examine 1 his &quot;convenience,&quot; and see  
what it is. The report of this subject stales the only  
general convenience to be the preventing the transpor­  
tation and re-transportation of money between the  
States and the Treasury. (For I puss over the increase  
of circulating medium ascribed lo it as a merit ; and  
j which, according to my ideas of paper money, is clear­  
ly a demerit ) Every State will have to pay a sum of  
tax money into the Treasury ; and the Treasury will  
have lo pav in every State u part of the interest on  
the public debt and salaries to the officers of Govern  
ment resident in that State. In most of the Slates  
there will still be a surplus of tax money, lo come up  
to the seat of Government, for the officers residing  
there. The payments of interest and salary in each  
State mav be made by Treasury orders on the Stale  
Collector. This will take up the greater part of the  
money he has collected in his Stale, and consequently  
prevent the great mass of it from being drawn out of  
ihe State. If there l&gt;e a balance of commerce in i-ivor  
! of that Stale, against the one in which the Government  
resides, the surplus of taxes will be remitted by the  
bills of exchange drawn for that commercial balance.  
And so it must be, if there were a Bank. But if there  
be no balance of commerce, either direct or circuitous,  
all the Banks in the world could not bring us the sur­  
plus of taxe9 but in the form of money. Treasury or­  
| ders, then, and bills of exchange, may prevent Ihe rlis­  
i placement of the main mass of the money collected,  
i without tilt* aid of anj- Bank ; arid where these fail, it  
cannot be prevented, even with that aid.  
Perhaps, indeed, bank bills may be a more convenient  
vehicle than Treasury orders. But a little difference in  
the degree of convenience cannot constitute the ne­  
cessity which the Constitution makes the ground for  
assuming any non enumerated power.  
Besides, the existing banks will, without dcuht, en­  
ter into arrangements for lending their agency, and the  
more favorable, as there will be a competition among  
them for it; whereas this bill delivers us up bound to  
the National Bank, who ore free to refuse all arrange­  
ments but on their own terms, and the public not free,  
on such refusal, to employ any other bank. That of  
Philadelphia, 1 believe, now does this business by their  
post notes, which, l&gt;_v an arrangement with the Treasu­  
ry, are paid by any State collector to whom they arc  
presented. This expedient alone, suffices lo prevent  
the existence of that necessity which may justify the  
assumption of a non-enumerated power, as a means f?r  
carrying into elfi cl an enumerated one. The Ihing  
may be done, and has been done, and well done, with­  
out this assumption; therefore, it docs not stand on that  
degree of necessity which can honestly justify if.  
Jt may be said, thai a bank whose bills would have  
a currency all over the States, would be more conve­  
nient than one whose currency is limited to a single  
State. So it would be still more convenient that there  
should be a bank whose bills should have a currency  
all over the world. But it does not follow from Ihis  
superior conveniency, that there exists any where a  
power to establish such a bank, or that the world may  
not go on very well without it.  
  
! Can it be thought that the Constitution intended,  
! that for a shade or two of cortrenitacr, more 01 le.-s,  
; Congress should be authorized to break down the most  
ancient and fundamental laws of the several States,  
j such as those against mortmain, the laws of alienage,  
, the rules of descent, the acts of distribution, the laws  
of escheat and forfeiture, and the laws of monopoly:?  
! Nothing but a necessity invincible by any oilier means,  
| can justify such a prostration of laws, which constitute  
; the pillars ofour whole system of jurisprudence. Will  
Congress be too straight-laced to curry the Constitution  
?mo honest effect,unless they may pass over the foun­  
dation laws of the Stale Governments, for the slightest  
convenience to them?  
The negative of the President is the shield provided  
bj&#x27; the Constitution to protect against the invasions of  
the Legislature: 1st, the rights of the Executive; &amp;J,  
of the Judiciary; 3d, e.f the State and State Legisla­  
tures. The present is the ca&lt;e of a. right remaining  
exclusively with the Slates, and is, couscrpieutlv, one  
of those intended by the Constitution to be placed un­  
der his protection , ?titoL unless tlie Presi­  
dent&#x27;s mind, on a view of every thing which is urged  
for and against this bill, is tolerably clear tiiat it is au­  
thorized by the Constitution, if the pro and con hang  
so even as to balance his judgment, a just respect for  
the wisdom of the Legislature would naturally decide  
the balance in favor of their opinion. It is chiefly&#x27; for  
cases where they are clearly misled by error, ambition  
or interest, that the Constitution has placed a check in  
the negative of the President

, as to its constitu-  
tionality. The Secretary of State, and At-  
tornev General, were of opinion that the bill  
was unconstitutional, while the Secretaries  
of the Treasury and War were of a differ  
ent opinion, and concurred with the major-  
ity in Congress. Mr. Jefferson W. 1 S deci  
dedly and warmly opposed to this institution  
not only on account of its unconslitution  
ality, but on account of the danger to be  
apprehended to Government from the ex-  
orbitancy of its power, and the injury which  
it might inflict on community. The follow-  
ing IS his official opinion on the constitu-  
tional question.  
  
The bill for establishing a National Bank,  
undertakes, among other things,  
  
1. To form the subscribers into a corpora-  
tion- . . , -  
  
2. To fciiil&#x27;i&#x27;c tnem, in their corporate  
capacities, to receive grants of land; and  
so far is against the laws of Mortmain.  
  
3. To make alien subscribers capable of  
holding lands; and so far, is against the  
laws ofa/tertuge-  
  
4. To transmit these lands, on tho death  
of a proprietor, to a certain line of succes-  
sors; and so far, changes the course of  
descents.  
  
5. &#x27;fo put the lands out of the reach of  
forfeiture and escheat, and so fur is against  
the Uvis of forfeitvre and escheat.  
  
0. To transmit ]&gt;er.sonal chattels to suc-  
cessors in a certain line; and so far is against  
the laws of distribution.  
  
7. To give them the sole and exclusive  
right of banking under the national authori-  
ty; and .so f ii- i&lt; against the laws of monop-  
oly-  
  
fa. To coiniininic.ite to them a power to  
  
make laws paramount to the laws of the  
States; for so they must be construed, to  
protect the institution from the control of  
the State Legislatures; and so, probably  
they will be construed.  
  
1 consider the foundation of the Constitu  
tion as laid on this ground, “that all powers  
not delegated to the United States by the  
Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the  
States, are reserved to the States or to the  
people.” [VZth amendment.) To take i  
single step beyond the boundaries thus spe  
c: lly drawn around the powers of Congress  
is to take posse ion of a boundless field of  
power, no longer susceptible of any defini-  
tion.  
  
Tho incorporation of a Bank, and the  
powers assumed by this bill, have not, in  
my opinion, been delegated to the United  
States by the Constitution.  
  
I. They are not among the powers spe.ci-  
ally enumerated. For these are,  
  
1. A [lower to Iry taxes for the purfwse of  
paying the debts of the United States. But  
no debt is paid by this bill, nor any tax laid.  
Were it a bill to raise money, its origination  
in the Senate would condemn it by the Con-  
stitution.  
  
2. To “borrow money.” But this bill  
neither borrows money, nor insures the bor-  
rowing it. The proprietors of the Bank  
will be just as free as any other money-  
holders, to lend or not to lend their money  
to tho public. The operation proposed in  
the bill, first to lend them two millions, and  
then borrow them back again, cannot  
change the nature of the latter act, which  
will still be a payment, and not a loan, call  
it by what name you please.  
  
3. “To regulate commerce with foreign  
nations, and among the Stales, and with the  
Indian tribes.” To enact a bank, and to  
regulate commerce, are two very difterent  
act-*. He who erects a bank creates a sub-  
ject of commerce in its bills; so does he  
who makes a bushel of wheat, or digs a  
dollar out of the mines. Yet neither ol  
these persons regulates commerce thereby.  
To make a thing which may be bought and  
sold, is not to prescribe regulations for buy-  
ing and selling. Besides, if this were an  
exercise of the power of regulating com

merce, it would be void, as extending as  
  
much to the internal commerce of every  
Slate as to its external; for the power given  
to Congress by the Constitution docs not  
extend to tho internal regulation of the  
commerce of a State, (that is to say, of the  
commerce between its citizens,) which re-  
mains exclusively within its own Legisla-  
ture, but to its external commerce only; that  
is to say, its commerce with another State,  
or with foreign nations, or with the Indian  
tribes. Accordingly, the bill docs not pro-  
|)ose the measure as a “regulation of trade,”  
but “as productive of considerable advan-  
tage to trade.”  
  
Still less are these powers covered by any  
other of the special enumerations.  
  
II. Nor are they with cither of the gen  
eral phrases, which are the two following:  
  
1. “To lay taxes to provide for the gene-  
ral welfare of the United States;” that is to  
say, &quot;to lay taxes for the. purpose of provi-  
ding for the general welfare;” for the laying  
of taxes is the power, and the general wel-  
fare the purpose for which the power is to  
be exercised. Congress are not to lay taxes  
ad libitum, for any purpose they please, but  
only to pay the dts ot preside for the wel-  
fare of the Union. In like manner, they  
arc not to do any thing they pl.use to pro-  
vide for the general welfare, but only to  
lay taxes for the pur[»ose. To consider the  
latter phrase, not us describing the purpose  
of the first, but as giving a distinct and in-  
dependent power to do any act they [ilease  
which might be for the good of the Union,  
would render all the preceding and subse-  
quent enuinei. tions of [lower completely  
useless. It would reduce the whole instru-  
ment to a single phrase, that of instituting  
a Congress with the [ wer to do whatever  
would be for the good of the United States.  
As they would be the s judges of the  
good or evil, it would be also a [ ower to do  
whatever evils they pleased. It is an estab-  
lished rule of construction, when a phrase  
will bear eiiher of two meanings, to give it  
that which will allow some meaning to the  
other parts of the instrument, and not that  
which will render all the others useless. —  
Certainly no such universal power was  
meant to be given them. It was intended  
to lace them up straighlly within the enu-  
merated powers, and those without which,  
as means, these powers could not be carried  
into effect. It is known that the very pow-  
er now pro[K)sed as a mea: -, was rejected  
as an end by the convention which formed  
the Constitution. A proposition was made  
to them to authori&#x27;ze Congress to open ca-  
nals, and HU amendatory one, to empower  
them to incor[)orale. But the wlr c was  
rejected; and one of the reasons of rejection  
urged in the debate was, that they then  
would have power to erect a bank, which  
would render the great cities, where there  
were prejudices and jealousies on that su  
ject, adverse to the rece[)iion of the Con^ti-  
tution.  
  
2. The second general phrase is, “to  
make all laws necessary and proper for car  
rying into execution the enumerated pow-  
ers.” But they can all be carried into exe-  
cution without a bank. A bank, therefore  
is not necessary, and consequently not au-  
thorized by this phrase  
  
It has been much urged that a bank will  
give great facility or convenience to the  
collection of taxes. Suppo.se this were  
true; yet the Constitution allows only the  
means which are “necessary,” not those  
which are merely “convenient,” for cflecl-  
  
mg the enumerated powers. If such a lat-  
itude of construction be allowed to this  
phrase as to give any non-enumerated pow-  
er, it will go to every one: for there is no  
one which ingenuity may not torture into a  
convenience, in some may or other, to some  
one of so long a list of enumerated o-.wers.  
It would swallow up all the delegated pow-  
ers, and reduce the whole to one phrase, as  
before observed. Therefore it was, that the  
Constitu n restrained them to the necessa-  
ry means; that is to s.ay, to those means  
without which the grant of the power would  
be nugatory.  
  
But let us examine this “convenience,”  
and see what it is. The re| -rt of this sub-  
ject states the only general convenience to  
be the preventing the transp .rta&#x27;ionand re-  
transportation of money between the States  
and the Treasury. (For I p -’s over the in-  
crease of circulating medium ascribed to it  
as a merit, and which, according to my  
ideas of paper money, is clearly a demerit.)  
Every Stale will have to pay a sum of tax  
money into the Treasury; and the Treasury  
will have to pay in every State a part of the  
interest on the public debt, and salaries to  
the officers of Government resident in that  
Slate. In most of the Slates there will still  
be a surplus of tax money, to come up to  
the seat of government, for the officers resi  
ding there. The payments of interest and  
salary in each State may be made by Trea-  
sury orders on the State Collector. This  
will take up the greater part of the money  
he has collected in his State, and co. e-  
quenily prevent the great mass of it from  
being drawn out of the State. If there be  
a balance of commerce in favor of tliat State,  
against the one in which the Government  
resides, the surplus of taxes will be remit-  
ted by the bills of exchange drawn for that  
commercial balance. And so it must bo if  
there were a bank- But if there be no bal-  
ance cf commerce, either direct or circuit-  
ous, all the banks in the world could not  
bring us the surplus of taxes but in tho form  
of money. Treasury orders, then, and bills  
of exchange, may prevent the displacement  
of the main mass of the money collected,  
without the aid of any bank; and where  
these fail, it cannot be prevented, even with  
that aid.  
  
l’erha[)s, indeed, bank bills may be a  
more convenient vehicle than Treasury or-  
ders. But a little difference in the degree  
of convenience cannot constitute the neces-  
sity which the Constitution makes the  
ground for as--uming any non-enumcrated  
potver.  
  
Besides, the c.xisting banks will, without  
doubt, enter into arrangements for lending  
their agency, and the more favorable, as  
there will be a competition among them for  
it; whereas this bill delivers us up bound to  
the National Bank, who are free to refuse  
all arrangements but on their own terms,  
and the public not free, on such refusal, to  
employ any other bank. That of Philadel-  
phia, I believe, now does this business by  
their post notes, which, by an arrangement  
with the Treasury, are paid by any Stale  
collector to whom they are presented. This  
expedient alone, buffices to prevent the ex-  
istence of that neces., y which may justify  
the assumption of a non-enumerated power,  
as a means of carrying into effect an enu-  
merated one. The thing may be done, and  
has been done, and well done, without this  
assumption; therefore, it does not stand on  
that degree of necessity which can honestly  
justify it.  
  
It may be said, that a bank whose bills  
would have a currency all over the States,  
would be more convenient than one whose  
currency is limited to a single State. So it  
would be still more convenient that there  
should be a bank whose bills should have a  
currency all over the world. But it does  
not follow from this sup rior conveniency,  
that there c.xists any where a [wwer to es»  
tablish such a bank, or that the world may  
not go on very well without it.  
  
Can it be thought that the Constitution  
intended that for a shade or two of con.  
venience, more or loss. Congress should  
be authorized to bieak down tho most  
ancient and fundamental laws of the sev-  
eral States, such as those against mortmain,  
the laws of alienage, the rules of des-  
cent, the acts of distribution, the laws of  
escheat and forfeiture, and the laws of mo-  
no[K)ly? Nothing but a necessity invinci-  
ble by any other means, can justify such a  
prostration of laws, which constitute the  
pillars of our whole system of jurisprudence  
Will Congress be too straightlaced to carry  
the Constitution into honest cflect, unless  
they may pass over the foundation laws of  
the State governments, for the slightest con-  
venience to them?  
  
The negative of the President is the  
shield provided by the Cnnstitulioii to pro-  
tect against the invasions of the Legislature :  
1st, the rights ol the Executive; 2d, of the  
Judiciary; 3d, of the States and Stale Le  
gis.atures. The present is the case of a  
right remaining exclusively with the Stales,  
and is, consequenlly, one of those intended  
by the Constitution to be [daced under hi  
protection.  
  
It must be added, however, that unless  
the President’s mind, on a view of every  
thing which is urged for and against this  
bill, is tolerably clear that it is not authorized  
by the Constitution; if the pro and con hang  
so even as to balance his judgment, a just  
respect for the wisdom of the Legislature  
would naturally decide the balance in favor  
of their opinion. It is chiefly for cases  
where they are clearly misled by error, am  
bition or interest, that the Constitution has  
placed a check in the negative of the Presi  
dent.

them to authorize Congress to open canals, and an amendatory

&quot;The bill establishing a bank undertakes, among  
other things:  
1st. To form the subscribers into a corporation  
2d. To enable them in their corporate capacities  
to receive grants of land; and so far is against the  
laws of mortmain.  
3. To make alien subscribers capable of hold­  
ing lands; and so far is against the laws of alienage.  
4h. To transmit these lands on the death of a pro­  
prietor to a certain line of successors; and so far  
changes the course of descents.  
5th. To put the lands out of the reach of forfel­  
ture and escheat; and so far is against the laies of  
forfeiture and escheat.&quot;  
6th. To transmit personal chattels to successors  
in a certain time; and so far is against the laies  
of distribution.  
7th. To give them the sole and exclusive right of  
banking under the national authority; and so far is  
against the laws of monopoly.  
8th. To communicate to them power to make laws  
paramount to the laws of the States, for so they  
must be construed to protect the institution from the  
control of the State Legislatures, and so, probably,  
they will be construed.&quot;  
Now, sir, where is the Constitutional difficulty  
xpressed in all this? It is put on the ground of a  
violation of certain State laws. Well, suppose!  
were to reason here against the Constitutional pow­  
er of Congress to pass the bill because it violated  
some law of Virginia, what would be thought of  
me? If I could fortunately show that it violated  
some ordinance or law of South Carolina, then I  
think we could make a pretty strong case for nul­  
lification.  
Mr Jefferson does not stop here, it is true. He  
then undertakes to show, what every body will ad­

&quot;The negative of the President, is the shield provided  
by the Constitution, to protect against the invasions of the  
Legislature. 1. The rights of the Executive. 2. Of the Ju­  
diciary. 3. Of the States, and State Legislutures. The  
present is the case of a right remaining exclusively with  
the States, and consequently one of those intended by the  
Constitution to be placed under his protection. It must be  
added, however, that unless the President&#x27;s mind, on a view  
of every thing which is urged for and against this bill, is  
tolerably clear, thatit is unauthorised by the Constitution.  
If the pro, and the con, hang so even as to balance his judg.  
ment, a just respect for the wisdom of the Legislature would  
naturally decide the balance in favor of their opinion. It  
is chietly for cases where they are clearly misled by error,  
ambition or interest, that the Constitution has placed a check

Jefferson calls the ‘general phrases” of the consti-  
tution, italicised by himself:  
  
“ “To lay taxes to provide for the general welfare  
of the United States;’ that is to say, ‘to lay taxes for  
the purpose of providing for the general welfare.’—  
For the laying of taxes is the power, and the general  
welfare the purpose for which the power is to be ex-  
ercised. Congress are not to lay taxes ad libitum, for  
any purpose they please, but only to pay the debts or pro-  
vide for the welfare of the union.”  
  
It has been stated that it was wise to assume the  
debts of the states in 1790, because those debts were  
contracted during war, and principally in defence of  
the states; but that the states should not be relieved  
now, because their debts were contracted in time of  
— although principally for objects of great pub-  
  
ic importance. And the distinction which is urged  
by some, that debts contracted by a state for defence

I power to authorise* Congress to charter a  
Bank of the United States? All will agree  
  
: tne power is not expre-stv grnmeo. uno oi  
! (he leaders&#x27; of the W hig party says, tire clause  
in the Constitution that gives Congress “pow­  
; er to.lay tax- s for the purpose of paying the  
debts of the United States,” authorises&#x27; the  
creation of a Bank. Another distinguished  
leader declares the clause authorising Con­  
gre.-&#x27;s to‘-borrow money,” gives the power  
to create a Bank. Yet another, difleriug with  
j the former, declares .that it arises under the  
I clause, “to regulate commerce with foreign  
nations, and among the States, and with the  
; Indian tribes.” This cannot be so. “To  
| erect a Bank and regulate commerce, are  
very different acts, lie who erects a Bank,  
creates a subject of commerce in its bills:  
i so does he who makes a bushel of wheat, a  
bale of cotton, or digs a dollar out of the  
I mines.” “Yet neither of these powers regu­  
late commerce thereby.” Still another de­  
j dares the power to erect a Bank is to be  
j found in the clause that authorises Congress  
•■to Jay taxes, to provide for the general wel­  
fare of the United States.” That is to saw  
“to lay taxes for the purpose, of providing  
for the general welfare.” “For the laying of  
taxes is die power, and the general welfare  
the purpose for which the power is to he ex­  
ercised. Congress is not to lay taxes, ad. j  
libitum, for any purpose they please; but  
only Input/ the debts or provide for the gen­  
eral welfare of the Union. In like manner,  
| they are not to do any thing they please, to  
| provide for lire general welfare, but only to  
I lay taxes for that purpose.” Thus it is mani­  
fest that this danse does not give Congress  
S power to charter a Bank. Another clause in  
the Constitution under which some one of  
tiic leaders contend for the power, is, “To  
make all laws necessary and prop* r for car -  
rying into execution the cutuut rated powers.”  
But they can all be carried into execution  
| without a Bank. A Batik, therefore, is not  
I necessary, and consequently, not authorised  
i by this phrase. Thus, gentlemen, we sec  
that no two of them agree upon the clause  
i under which the power to create a Bank  
arises. It&#x27; the power to charter a Bank is so

Has he ever read what the founder of the Demo

If the gentleman has, he has failed to discover  
what Democratic doctrine is, as much as did the  
gentleman four years ago. Here, sir, is what the  
founder of the Democratic party says in relation  
to this very clause of the Constitution: To lay  
taxes, is the power, and the general welfare the  
purpose for which that power is to be exercised.  
Congress is not ad libitum to lay taxes for any  
purpose they please, but only to pay the debts  
and provide for the general welfare of the Union.  
They are not to do anything they please—to vote  
appropriations for the Collins line, for instance—  
for the general welfare, but only to lay taxes for  
that purpose. That is the Democratic doctrine.  
We cannot legislate here for the ceneral welfare  
of the country, unless we lay taxes for the pur-  
pose. Does the gentleman propose by this bill to  
lay taxes for the purpose of providing for the gen-  
eral welfare? No, he proposes to distribute money  
to Collins &amp; Co., and calls that providing for th

A power to lay taxes for the common defence ana general welfare of  
the United States is not in common sense a general power. (1 Story,  
Const., § 922.)  
  
The power to lay taxes is a power exclusively given to raise revenue,  
and it can constitutionally be applied to no other purposes. The appli-  
cation for other purposes is an abuse of the power; and, in fact, how-  
ever it may be in form disguised, is a premeditated usurpation of  
authority. (1 Story, Const., § 963.)  
  
To Judge Story, the suggestion that this power to levy taxes for  
the general welfare was an unlimited one seemed entirely absurd.  
  
To consider the latter phrase not as describing the purpose of the  
first, but as giving a distinct and independent power to do any act they  
please which might be for the good of the Union, wculd render all  
the preceding and subsequent enumerations of power completely  
useless. It would reduce the whole instrument to a single phrase, that  
of instituting a Congress with power to do whatever would be for  
the good of the United States; and, as they would be the sole judges  
of the good or evil, it would also be a power to do whatever evil  
they pleased. (1 Story, Const., § 926.)
