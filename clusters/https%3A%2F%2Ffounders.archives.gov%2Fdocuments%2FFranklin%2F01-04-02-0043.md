From these three things, viz, the extreme Subtilty of the electrical matter, the mutual repulsion of its parts, and the strong attraction between them and other matter, arise this effect, that when a quantity of electrical matter is applied to a mass of common matter of any bigness or length within our observation (which has not already got its quantity) it is immediately and

en hereafter; and that those called electrics per se, as glass &amp;c. attract and retain it the strongest, and contain the greatest quantity.  
We know that the electrical fluid is in common matter, because we can pump it out by the globe or tube; and that common matter has near as much as it can contain; because, when we add a little more to any portion of it, the additional quantity does not enter, but forms an electrical atmosphere: and we know that common matter has not (generally) more than it can contain; otherwise all loose portions of it would repel each other, as they constantly do when they have electric atmospheres.  
The form of the electrical atmosphere is that of the body it surrounds: this shape may be rendered visible in a still air, by raising a smoke from dry resin dropt into a hot tea spoon under the electrised body, which will be attracted and spread itself equally on all sides, covering and concealing the body. And this form it takes, because it is attracted by all parts of the surface of the body, though it cannot enter the substance already replete. Without this attraction it would not remain round the body, but be dissipated in the air.  
The atmosphere of electrical particles surrounding an electrified sphere is not more disposed to leave it, or more easily drawn off from any one part of the sphere than from another, because it is equally attracted by every part. But that is not the case with bodies of any other figure. From a cube it is more easily drawn at the corners than at the plane sides, and so from the angles of a body of any other form, and still most easily from the angle that is most acute; and for this reason points have a property of d

hinks that though the effluvia of cinnamon and the electrical fluid should mix within the globe, they would never come out together through the pores of the glass, and thus be conveyed to the prime conductor; for he thinks that the electrical fluid itself cannot come through, and that the prime conductor is always supplied from the cushion, and this last from the floor. Besides, when the globe is filled with cinnamon, or other non-electrics, no electricity can be obtained from its outer surface, for the reasons before laid down. He has tried another way, which he thought more likely to obtain a mixture of the electrical and other effluvia together, if such a mixture had been possible. He placed a glass plate under his cushion, to cut off the communication between the cushion and the floor; he then brought a small chain from the cushion into a glass of oil of turpentine, and carried another chain from the oil of turpentine to the floor, taking care that the chain from the cushion to the glass touched no part of the frame of the machine. Another chain was fixed to the prime conductor, and held in the hand of a person to be electrified. The ends of the two chains in the glass were near an inch from each other, the oil of turpentine between. Now the globe being turned, could draw no fire from the floor through the machine, the communication that way being cut off by the thick glass plate under the cushion; it must then draw it through the chains, whose ends were dipt in the oil of turpentine. And as the oil of turpentine being in some degree an electric per se, would not conduct what came up from the floor, the electricity was obliged to jump from the end of one chain to the end of the other, which he could see in large sparks; and thus it had a fair opportunity of seizing some of the finest particles of the oil in its passage, and carrying them off with it: but no such effect followed, nor could he perceive the least difference in the smell of the electrical effluvia thus collected, from what it had when collected otherwise; nor does it otherwise affect the body of the person electrified. He likewise put into a phial, instead of water, a strong purging liquid, and then charged the phial, and took repeated shocks from it; in which case every particle of the electrical fluid must, before it went through his body, have first gone through the liquid when the phial is charging, and returned through it when discharging; yet no other effect followed than if the phial had been charged with water. He has also smelt the electrical fire when drawn through gold, silver, copper, lead, iron, wood, and the human body, and

lin, in a letter to Mr. Collinson some time since, mentioned his intending to try the power of a very strong electrical shock upon a turkey, I desired of Mr. Collinson to let Mr. Franklin know, that I should be glad to be acquainted with the result of that experiment. He accordingly has been so very obliging as to send this account, which is to the following purpose. He made first several experiments on fowls, and found that two large thin glass jars gilt, holding each about 6 gallons, and such as I mentioned I had employed in the last paper I laid before you upon this subject, were sufficient when fully charged to kill common hens outright; but the turkies, though thrown into violent convulsions and then lying as dead for some minutes, would recover in less than a quarter of an hour. However, having added three other such to the former two, though not fully charged, he killed a turkey of about ten pounds weight, and believes they would have killed a much larger. He conceited, as himself says, that the birds killed in this manner eat uncommonly tender.  
In making these experiments, he found that a man could, without great detriment, bear a much greater shock than he imagined: for he inadvertently received the stroke of two of these jars through his arms and body, when they were very near fully charged. It seemed to him an universal blow throughout the body from head to foot, and was followed by a violent quick trembling in the trunk, which went gradually off in a few seconds. It was some minutes before he could recollect his thoughts so as to know what was the matter; for he did not see the flash, tho’ his eye was on the spot of the prime conductor, from whence it struck the back of his hand; nor did he hear the crack, though the bystanders said it was a loud one; nor did he particularly feel the stroke on his hand, tho’ he afterwards found it had raised a swelling there of the bigness of half a swan shot, or pistol bullet. His arms and the back of his neck felt somewhat numbed the remainder of the evening, and his breast was sore for a week after, as if it had been bruised. From this experiment may be seen the danger, even under the greatest caution, to the operator, when making these experiments with large jars; for it is not to be doubted but that several of these fully charged, would as certainly, by increasing them, in proportion to the size, kill a man as they before did the turkey.  
Upon the whole, Mr. Franklin appears in the work before us to b

Society he gives an account of these experiments.* ‘‘ He made  
first several experiments on fowls, and found that two large, thin  
glass jars gilt, holding each about six gallons, were sufficient,  
when fully charged, to kill common hens outright ; but the turkeys,  
though thrown into violent convulsions, and then lying as dead for  
some minutes, would recover in less than a quarter of an hour.  
However, having added three other such to the former two, though  
not fully charged, he killed a turkey of about ten pounds weight,  
and believes that they would have killed a much larger. He con-  
ceited, as himself says, that the birds killed in this manner eat un-  
commonly tender.’’ ‘‘ In making these experiments he found that  
a man could, without great detriment, bear a much greater shock  
than he had imagined ; for he inadvertently received the stroke of  
two of these jars through his arms and body, when they were very  
nearly fully charged. It seemed to him an_ universal blow  
throughout the body from head to foot, and was followed by a vio-  
lent, quick trembling in the trunk, which went off gradually in a  
few seconds. It was some minutes before he could recollect his  
thoughts, so as to know what was the matter; for he did not see  
the flash, though his eye was on the spot of the prime conductor  
from whence it struck the back of his hand; nor did he hear  
the crack, though the bystanders said it was a loud one; nor  
did he particularly feel the stroke on his hand, though he afterward  
found it had raised a swelling there of the bigness of half a pistol  
bullet. His arms and the back of the neck felt somewhat numbed  
the remainder of the evening, and his breast was sore for a week  
after, as if it had been bruised. From this experiment may be  
seen the danger, even under the greatest caution, to the operator,  
when making these experiments with large jars, for it is not to be  
doubted but several of these fully charged would as certainly, by  
increasing them in proportion to the size, kiil a man as they before  
did a turkey.”’
