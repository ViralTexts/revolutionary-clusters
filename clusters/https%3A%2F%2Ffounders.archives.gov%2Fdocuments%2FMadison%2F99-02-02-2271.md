ined a publication, edited since in a pamphlet form; from two  sons of  
the late Mr. Bayard; its object being to vindicate the memory of their father agst. certain passages in the writings of  
Mr. Jefferson.  
The filial anxiety which prompted the publication, was natural &amp; highly commendable. But it is to be  
regretted, that in performing that duty, they have done great injustice to the memory of Mr. Jefferson, by the hasty  
&amp; limited views taken of the evidence deducible from the sources to which they had appealed.  
The first passage on which they found thus their charges is in the following words.  
&quot;February 12. 1801:—Edward Livingston tells me that Bayard applied to day or last night, to General Smith and  
represented to him the expediency of coming over to the States who vote for Burr; that there was nothing in the way of  
appointment which he might not command, and particularly mentioned the Secretaryship of the Navy. Smith asked him if he  
was authorized to make the offer. He said he was authorized. Smith told this to Livingston, and to Wilson Cary Nicholas  
who confirms it to me.&quot; &amp;c. (see Jeffn’s Memoirs Vol. 4. p 52)  
From this Statement it appears, that Mr. J--n was told by Mr. Livingston, that he had it from Genl. Smith  
that Mr. Bayard had applied to him (Genl. Smith) with an offer of a high appointment, if he would come

Jefferson relating to the remote transaction, not within the scope of the precise question. 2. the declaration of Genl.

. Burr he says—&quot;I did not commit these things to writing at the time but I do  
it now, because in a suit between him (Col. Burr) and Cheetham, he had a deposition of Mr. Bayard taken which seems to  
have no relation to the suit, nor to any other object than to Calumniate me. Bayard pretends to have addressed to me,  
during the pending of the Presidential Election in Feby. 1801, through Genl. Samuel Smith, certain conditions on which my  
election might be obtained; and that Genl. Smith after conversing with me gave answers for me. This is absolutely false.  
No proposition of any kind was ever made to me on that occasion by Genl. Smith, nor any answer authorized by me; and this  
fact Genl. Smith affirms  at this moment.&quot;  
The reply given to this memorandum by the authors of the publication is a reference to the Depositions of Mr.  
Bayard &amp; Genl. Smith in the cause of Gillespie &amp; Smith.  
It appears that Mr. Jefferson attending merely to the matter of Mr. Bayards deposition, did not distinguish  
between the suit of Burr &amp; Cheetham, and that of Gillespie &amp; Smith; in the latter of which the

) told him (Genl. Smith) I should not be satisfied, nor agree to yield, till I had the assurance  
from Mr. Jefferson himself; but that if he Genl. Smith would consult Mr. Jefferson, and bring the assurance from him, the  
election should be ended. The Genl. made no difficulty in consulting Mr. J--n: and proposed giving me his answer in the next  
morning. The next day upon our meeting; Genl. S. informed me that he had seen Mr. J-- and stated to him the points  
mentioned; and was authorized by him to say that they corresponded with his views &amp; intentions; and that we (Mr B &amp;c) might confide  
in him accordingly. The opposition of Vermont &amp;c &amp;c was immediately withdrawn &amp; Mr.

&quot;He (Mr. B.) then stated that he had it in his power (and was so disposed) to terminate the election, but he  
wished information as to Mr. Jefferson’s opinions on certain subjects, and mentioned (I think) the same three points  
already alluded to as asked by Col: Parker and General Dayton, and received from me the same answer in substance (if not  
in words) that I had given to General Dayton. He added a fourth, to wit: What would be Mr. Jefferson’s conduct as to the  
public officers? He said he did not mean confidential officers, but, by way of elucidating his question, he added, such as  
Mr. Latimer of Philadelphia, and Mr. McLane of Delaware. I answered that I had never heard Mr. Jefferson say any thing on  
that subject. He requested that I would inquire, and inform him the next day. I did so. And the next day (Saturday) told  
him, that Mr. Jefferson had said that he did not think such officers ought to be dismissed on political grounds only,  
except in cases where they had made improper use of their offices, to force the officers under them to vote contrary to  
their judgments. That as to Mr. McLane, he had already been spoken to in his behalf by Major Eacleston, and from the  
character given him by that gentleman, he considered him a meritorious officer, of course that he would not be displaced,  
or ought not to be displaced. I further added that Mr. Bayard might rest assured (or words to that effect) that Mr.  
Jefferson would conduct as to those points agreeably to the opinions I had stated as his. Mr. Bayard then said, we will  
give the vote on Monday, &amp; we separated

The first charge will be found in the ninth  
volume of the congressional edition of Mr. Jef  
ferson&#x27;s works, page 202. It is in these words:  
&quot;February 12, 1801.?Edward Livingston  
tella me that Bayard applied to-day, or last  
night, to General Samuel Smith, and repre­  
sented to him the expediency of his coming  
over to the States who vote for Burr; that there  
was nothing in the way of appointment which  
he might not command, and particularly  
mentioned the Secretaryship of the Navy.  
Smith asked him if he was authorized to make  
the offer. He said he was authorised. Smith  
told this to Livingston and to W. C. Nicholas,  
who confirms it to me.
