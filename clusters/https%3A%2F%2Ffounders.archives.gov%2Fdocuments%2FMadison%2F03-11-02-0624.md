Mint of the United States Jany 1st 1817.  
  
I have now the honour of laying before you, a Report of the operations of the Mint during the last year.  
From the statement of the Treasurer, herewith transmitted, it will appear, that within the above period, there have been struck &amp; emitted—  
In silver coins, 67,153 pieces, amounting to 28,575 dollars &amp; 75 Cents &amp; in copper coins, 2,820,982 pieces, amounting to 28,209 dollars &amp; 82 Cents.  
The amount of the latter would have been considerably greater, had it not been for a disappointment in the supply of copper. Measures, however, are now taken to prevent such disappointments in future.  
The stagnation which has for some time existed in the circulation of specie currency, has, almost totally, prevented the usuel deposits of gold &amp;  
  
silver bullion, for coinage. But there is now a prospect, that this will not long continue to be the case. The Mint having at this time in its vaults, deposits of these metals to a very considerable amount.  
The repairs of the Mint, which you were pleased to authorize, are now nearly completed. A substantial brick building has been erected on the site formally occupied by an old wooden building; &amp; in the apparatus, &amp; arrangement of machinery, which have been adopted, many important improvements have been introduced. Among these is the substitution of a steam engine, for the horse power heretofore employed. A change which, it is believed, will not only diminish the expenses of the establishment, but greatly facilitate all its principal operations. I have the honour to be Sir, with the greatest respect &amp; esteem, Your most Obed. Servt.

Mint of the United States, Jan. 7, 1817.  
  
Sim,—I have now the honor of laying before  
you a report of the operations of the Mint during  
the last year.  
  
From the statement of the Treasury herewith  
transmitted, it will appear, that within the above  
period, there have been struck and emitted—  
  
In silver coins, 67,153 pieces, amounting to  
28,575 dollars and 75 cents ; and in ead coins,  
2,820,982 pieces, amounting to 28,209 dollars and  
82 cents.  
  
The amount of the latter would have been con-  
siderably greater, had it not been for a disappoint-  
ment in the supply of copper. Measures, how-  
ever, are now taken to prevent such disappoint-  
ments in future.  
  
The ion which has for some time exist-  
ed in the circulation of specie currency, has al-  
most totally prevented the deposits of gold and  
silver bullion for coi But there is now a  
prospect that this will not long continue to be the  
case—the Mint having at this time in its vaults  
deposits of these metals to a very considerable  
amount. ,  
  
The repairs of the Mint, which you were  
pleased to authorize, are now nearly completed.  
A substantial brick building has been erected on  
the site formerly occupied by an old wooden  
building ; and in the apparatus and arrangement  
of machinery, which have been adopted, many im-  
portant improvements have been introduced. A-  
mong these is the substitution of a steam engine  
for the horse power heretofore empleyed. A  
change which, it is believed, will&#x27;not only diminish  
the expenses of the establishment, but greatly fa-  
ciJitate all its principal operations.  
  
I have the honor to be, sir,  
With the greatest respect and esteem,  
Yonr most obedient servant,
