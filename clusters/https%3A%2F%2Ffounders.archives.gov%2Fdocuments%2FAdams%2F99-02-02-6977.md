 to the Revolution, may be considered as one continued Struggle, between the Prince and the People, all tending to that happy Establishment, which Great Britain has Since enjoyed.  
“The absolute Rights of Englishmen, as frequently declared in Parliament, from Magna Charta, to this time, are the Rights Of Personal Security, Personal Liberty and of Private Property.  
“The Allegiance of British Subjects being natural, perpetual and inseparable from their Persons, let them be in what Country they may; their Rights are also natural inherent and perpetual.  
“By the Laws of Nature and of Nations; by the Voice of Universal Reason, and of God, when a Nation takes Possession of a desert, uncultivated uninhabited Country, or purchases of Savages, as was the Case with far the greatest part of the British Settlements; the Colonists transplanting themselves and their Posterity, tho’ Separated from the principal Establishment, or Mother Country, naturally become part of the State with its ancient possessions, and intitled to all the essential Rights of the Mother Country. This is not only confirmed by the practice of the antients, but by the Moderns ever Since the discovery of America. Frenchman, Spaniards and Portugats are not greater Slaves abroad than at home; and hitherto Britons have been as  free, on one Side of the Atlantic as on the other: and it is humbly hoped that his Majesty and the Parliament will in their Wisdom be graciously pleased to continue the Colonies in this happy State.”  
“It is presumed, that upon these Principles, The Colonists have been by their Several Charters declared natural Subjects, and entrusted with the power of making their own local Laws, not repugnant to the Laws of England, and with the Power of taxing themselves.” “This legislative power is subject to the same charter to the kings negative as in Ireland. This effectually secures the dependence of the Colonies on Great Britain. By the 13th: of George 2nd: Chapter 9th: even foreigners having lived seven years, in any of the Colonies, are deemed natives on taking the oaths of allegiance; &amp;c. and are declared by the said act to be his majestys natural born subjects of the kingdoms of Great Britain, to all intents Constructions and purposes, as if any of them had been born within the kingdom. The reasons given for this naturalization in the preamble of the act are, that the increase of the people is the means of advancing the wealth or of any nation or Country. And many foreigners and strangers, from the lenity of our Ggovernment, the purity of our religion, the benefit of our laws the advantages of our trade and the security of our property, might be induced to come and settle in some of his Majesty’s Ccolonies in America, if they were partakers of the advantages &amp; privileges, which the native born subjects there enjoy.  
“The several acts of parliament and charters, declaratory of the rights and liberties of the colonies are but an affirmance of the common law and law of nature in this point. There are, says my Lord Coke, regularly three incidents to subjects born. (1) Parents under the actual obedience of the king. (2) That the place of his birth be within the king’s dominions. (3) The time of his birth to be Cchiefly Cconsidered. “For he cannot be a subject born of one kingdom, that was born under the allegiance of a king of another kingdom. See Calvin’s case and the several acts &amp; decision on naturalization, from Edward the third to this day. The common Law is received and practised upon here and in the rest of the colonies; and all ancient and modern acts of parliaments, that can be considered as part of or in amendment of the common Law, together with such acts of parliament, as expressly name the plantations, so that the power of the British parliament is held sacred and as uncontrolable in the colonies, as in England. The question is not upon the general Ppower or Rright of the Parliament; but whether it is not circumscribed within some equitable and reasonable Bbounds?. It is hoped it will not be considered as a new doctrine, that even the authority of the parliament of Great Britain is circumscribed by certain bounds, which,  if exceeded, their acts become those of mere power without right, &amp; consequently void. The judges of England have declared in favour of these sentiments, when they expressly declare; that acts of Pparliament against natural equity are void. That acts against the fundamental principles of the British constitution are void. A very important question here presents itself. It essentially belongs to the society, both in relation to the manner, in which it desires to be governed, &amp; to the conduct of the citizens. This is called the Llegislative Ppower. The nation may entrust the exercise of it to the prince or to an assembly: or to an assembly and the Pprince joinedtly, who have then a right of making new &amp; abrogating old laws. It is here demanded whether, if their power extends so far, as to the fundamental laws, they may change the constitution of the state? The principles we have laid down lead us to decide this point with certainty, that the authority of these legislators does not extend so far, &amp; that they ought to consider the fundamental laws as sacred, if the nation has not in very express terms given them the power to change them. For the constitution of the state ought to be fixed; &amp; since that was first established by the nation; which afterwards trusted certain persons with the legislative power, the fundamental laws are excepted from their commission. It appears that the society had only resolved to make provision for the state’s being always furnished with laws, suited to particular conjunctures, &amp; gave the legislature for that purpose the power of abrogating the ancient civil &amp; political laws, that were not fundamental, &amp; of making new ones. But nothing leads us to thingk that it was willing to submit the constitution itself to their pleasure.”  
When a nation takes possession of a distant country &amp; settles a collony there that country though seperated from the principle establishment or mother country naturally becomes a part of the state equally with its ancient possessions. Whenever the political laws or treaties make no distinction between them every thing said of the territory of a nation ought also to extend to its colonies. An act of Parliament made against natural equity as to make a man judge in his own cause would be void Hob 87 Trin 12 Jac. Day v. Savage S. C. &amp; P. cited Arg 10 Mod 115 Hill 11 Ann C. B. in case of Thornby &amp; Fleetwood “but says that this must be a clear case &amp; judges will strain hard rather than interpret an act void, ab initio” This is granted but still their authority is not boundless if subject to the controul of the judges in any case. Holt chief justice thought what Lord Coke says, in Dr: Bonham’s case, a very reasonable &amp; true saying, that if an act of parliament should ordain the same person both party &amp; judge, in his own case, it would be a void act of parliament, &amp; an act of parliament can do no wrong tho’ it may do several things that look pretty odd, for it may discharge one from the allegiance he lives under &amp; restore to the state of nature but it can not make one that lives under a government both party and judge per Holt C. J. 12 Mod. 687. 688 Hill 1. 3 W 3 B. R in the case of the city of London v Wood. It appears in our books that in several cases the common law should controul acts of parliament &amp; sometimes adjudge them to be utterly void for when an act of Parliament is against com-right &amp; reason or repugnant &amp; impossible to be performed the common law shall controul it &amp; adjudge it to be void; &amp; therefore 8 E 3. 30 Thomas Tregors Case upon the statute of W 2 Cap 38 &amp; Art sup Chart 9 Herle said that sometimes statutes are made contrary to law &amp; right, which the maker of them perceiving will not put them into execution. This doctrine is agreeable to the law of Nature and Nations and to the divine dictates of Natural &amp; revealed religion. It is contrary to reason that the supreme power should have a right to alter the Constitution This would imply that those who are intrusted with Sovereignty by the people have a right to do as they please. In other words that those who are invested with power to protect the people and support their rights &amp; liberties have a rieght to make slaves of them. This is not very remote from a flat Contradiction. Should the parliament of Great Britain follow the example of Some other foreign States Sweden, Denmark, France &amp;c and vote the King absolute &amp; despotic; would such an act of parliament make him so? Would any Minister in his senses advise a prince to accept of such an offer of power? It would be unsafe to accept of such a donation because the parliament or donors would grant more than it was in their power lawfully to give, the law of Nature never invested them with a power of surrendering their own liberty and the people certainly never entrusted any body of men with a power to surrender theirs in exchange for slavery. But if the whole state be Cconquered if the Nation be subdued in what manner can a victor treat it without transgressing the bounds of justice? What are his rights over the conquest? Some have dared to advance this monstrous principle that the conqueror is absolute master over this conquest that he may dispose of it as his property treat it as he pleases according to the common expression of treating a state as a conquered country and hence they derive one of the sources of despotic Government. But enough of those that reduce men to the state of Transferable goods or use them like beasts of burden who deliver them up as the property or patrimony of another man Let us argue upon principles countenanced by reason &amp; becoming humanity. The whole right of the conquerer proceeds from the just defence of himself which contains the support &amp; prosecution of his rights. Thus when he has totally subdued a nation with whom he had been at war, he may without dispute cause justice to be done him with regard to what gave rise to the war &amp; require payment for the expence &amp; damage he has sustained; he may according to the exigency of the place impose penalties on it as an example, he may should prudence so dictate disable it from undertaking any pernicious design in for the future. But in securing all these views the mildest means are to be preferred. We are always to remember that the law of nature permits no injury to be done to an enemy unless in taking measures necessary for a just defence &amp; a reasonable security. Some princes have only imposed a tribute on it, others have been satisfied in stripping it of some of its privileges dismembering it of a province or keeping it in awe by fortresses; others as their quarrel was only with the Sovreign in person have left a nation in the full enjoyment of its rights only setting a sovreign over it. But if the conquerer thinks propper to retain the sovreignty of the vanquished state &amp; has such a right; the manner in which he is to treat the state still flows from the same principles If the sovreign be only the just object of his complaint reason declares that by his conquest he acquires only such rights as actually belonged to the dethroned sovreign &amp; on the submission of his people he is to govern it according to the laws of the state. If the people do not voluntarily submit, the State of war subsists. When a sovreign as pretending to have the absolute disposal of a people whom he has conquered is for enslaving them he causes the state of war to subsist between this people &amp; him. Mr: De Vattel B. 3. C. 10 Sec 201. R. It is now near three hundred years Since the Continent of N America was 1st: discovered and that by British Subjects the Cabots discovered the Continent before the Spaniards. Ten Generations have passed away thro’ infinite toils and bloody Conflicts in Settling this Country. None of those ever dreamed but that they were intitled at least to equal privileges with those of the same rank born within the realm.  
British America has been hitherto distinguished from the slavish Colonies round about it as the fortunate Britons have been from most of their neighbours on the Continent of Europe. It is for the Interest of Great Britain that her Colonies be ever thus distinguished. Every man must wilfully blind himself that dont see the immense value of our acquisitions in the late war and that tho’ we did not retain all at the Conclusion of Peace that we obtained by the Sword; yet our gracious Sovereign at the same time that he has given a divine lesson of equitable moderation to the Princes of the earth, has retained sufficient to make the British arms the dread of the universe, and his name dear to all Posterity.  
To the freedom of the British Constitution and to their increase of Commerce tis owing that our Colonies have flourished without diminishing the inhabitants the of our mother Country quite contrary to the effects of plantations made by most other nations which have suffered at home in order to aggrandize themselves abroad. This is a remarkably the case of Spain. The subjects of a free and happy Constitution of Government have a thousand Aadvantages to Colonize above those who live under despotic princes.  
“We see how the British Colonies on the continent, have outgrown those of the French.—Notwithstanding they have ever engaged the Salvages to keep us back.—Their advantages over us is the West-Indies are, (1.) A Capital neglect in former reigns, in suffering them to have a firm possession of so many valuable Islands, that we had a better title to than they. (2) The French enable to push their Settlements effectually on the Continent, have bent their views to Islands, and poured vast numbers into them. (3) The climate and business of these Islands is by nature much better adapted to Frenchmen and to Negroes than to Britons. (4) The labour of Slaves, Black or white, will be ever cheaper than that of freemen free men, because that of the Individuals among the former, will never be worth so much as with the latter; but this difference is more than supplied; by numbers under the advantages abovementioned. The French will ever be able to sell their West-India produce cheaper than our own Islanders; and yet while our own Islanders can have such a price for theirs, as to grow much richer than the French, or any other of the King’s Subjects in America, as is the case, and what the Northern Colonies take from the French, and other foreign Islands, Centers finally in return to Great Britain for her Manufactures, to an immense value, and with a vast profit to her. It is contrary to the first principles of policy to clog such a Trade with duties, much more to prohibit it, to the risque if not certain destruction of the fishery. “It is allowed by the most accurate British writers on commerce, Mr. Postlethwait in particular, who seems to favour the cause of the Sugar Islands, that one half of the immense commerce of Great Britain is with her Colonies. It is very certain that without the fishery seven eights of this commerce would cease. The fishery is the center of motion, upon which the wheel of all the British commerce in America turns. Without the American trade, would Britain, as a Commercial State, make any great figure at this day in Europe? “Her trade in woolen and other manufactures, is said to be lessening in all parts of the World, but America where it is increasing, and capable of infinite increase, from a concurrence of every circumstance in its favour. Here is an extensive territory of different climates, which in time will consume, and be able to pay for as much manufactures as Great Britain and Ireland can make, If true maxims are persued. The French for reasons already mentioned, can underwork, and consequently undersell the English manufactures of Great Britain in every market in Europe. But they can send none of their manufacturers here; and it is the wish of every honest British American that they never may; ’tis best they never should, we can do better without the manufactures of Europe, save those of Great Britain, than with them: But without the West-India produce we cannot; without it our fishery must infallibly be ruined. When that is gone our own Islands will very poorly subsist. No British manufactures can be paid for by the Colonists. What will follow? One of these two things, both of which it is the interest of Great Britain to prevent. (1.) The northern Colonists must be content to go naked, and turn Savages. Or (2) Become manufacturers of linnen and woolen, to cloath themselves; which if they cannot carry to the perfection of Europe, will be very destructive to the interests of Great Britain. The Computation has been made, and that within bounds, and it can be demonstrated, that if North America is only driven to the fatal necessity of manufacturing a suit of the most ordinary linnen or woolen for each inhabitant annually, which may be soon done, when necessity the Mother of invention shall opperate Great Britain &amp; Ireland will loose two millions per annum, besides a diminution of the revenue to nearly the same amount. This may appear parodxical, but a few years experience of the execution of the Sugar act, will sufficiently convince the parliament not only of the inutility, but destructive tendency of it, while calculations may be little attended to—That the  trade with the Colonies has been of surprising advantage to Great Britain, notwithstanding the want of a good regulation is past all doubt.—Great Britain is well known to have increased prodigiously both in numbers and in wealth since she began to colonize.—To the growth of the plantations Britain is in a great measure indebtteed, for her present riches and strength.—As the wild wastes of America have been turned into pleasant habitations, and flourishing trading towns; so many of the little Villages and obscure boroughs in Great Britain have put a new face, and all suddenly started up, and become fair markets, and manufacturing towns, and opulent cities. London itself, which bids fair to be the metropolis of the world, is five times more populous than it was in the days of Queen Elizabeth, such are the fruits of the spirit of  Commerce and liberty. Hence it is manifested how much we all owe to that beautiful form of civil Government, under which we have the happiness to live.—  
“It is evidently the interest, and ought to be the care of all those intrusted with the administration of Government to see that every part of the British empire enjoys to the full the rights they are intitled to by the laws, and the advantages which result from their being maintained with impartiality and vigour.—This we have seen reduced to practice in the present and preceeding reigns; and have the highest reason from the paternal care and goodness that his Majesty, and the British Parliament, have hitherto been graciously pleased to discover to all his Majesty’s dutiful and loyal subjects, and to the colonists in particular, to rest satisfied, that our privileges will remain sacred and inviolate.—The connection between Great Britain and her Colonies is so natural and strong, as to make their mutual happiness depend upon their mutual support.—Nothing can tend more to the destruction of both, and to foward the measures of their enemies, than sowing the seeds of jealously, animosity and dessention between the mother Country and the Colonies.  
“A conviction of the truth and importances of these principles, induced Great Britain during the late War, to carry on so many glorious enterprizes for the defence of the colonies; and those on their part to exert themselves beyond their ability to pay, as is evident from the parliamentary reimbursements.  
“If the Spirit of Commerce was attended to, perhaps, duties would be every where decreased, if not annihilated, and prohibitions multiplied.—Every branch of trade that hurts a Community, should be prohibited for the same reason that a private Gentleman would break off commerce with a sharper or an extensive usurer. ’Tis to no purpose to higgle with such people, as you are sure to loose by them.—’Tis exactly so with a Nation, if the balance is against them, and they can possibly subsist without the Commodity—as they generally can in such cases, is like a Composition a prohibition is the only remedy; for a duty in such case, is like a Composition with a thief, that for five shillings in the pound returned, he shall rob you at pleasure; when if the thing is examined to the bottom, you are at five Shillings expence in travelling to get back your five shillings, and he is at the same expence in coming to pay it, so he robs you of but ten shillings in the pound, that you thus wisely compound for. To apply this to trade, I believe every duty that was ever imposed on commerce or in the nature of things can be, will be found to be divided between the state imposing the duty, and the Country exported from. This if between the several parts of the same Kingdom or dominions of the same Prince, can only tend to embarress trade, and raise the price of labour above other States, which is of very pernicious consequence to the husbandman, manufacturer, mariner and merchant, the four tribes that support the whole hive. If your duty is upon the a commodity of a foreign state, it is either upon the whole useful and gainful, and therefore necessary for the husbandmen, and manufacturer, mariner or merchant, as finally bringing a profit to the state by a balance against your State—There is no medium that we no know of.—If the commodity is of the former kind, it should be prohibited; but if the latter, imported duty free, unless you would raise the price of labour by a duty on necessaries, or make the above wise composition for the importation of commodities you are sure to loose by—The only test of a useful commodity is the gain upon the whole to the State; such should be free; the only test of a pernicious trade is the loss upon the whole, or to the community, this should be prohibited. If therefore it can be demonstrated that the Sugar and molasses trade from the northern colonies to the foreign Plantations is upon the whole a loss to the community, by which term is here meant the three kingdoms and the British dominions taken collectively, then and not ’till then should this trade be prohibited.—This never had been proved, nor can be; the Country Contrary being certain to wit, that the nation upon the whole hath been a vast gainer by this trade, in the vend of and pay for its manufactures; and a great loss by a duty upon this trade will finally fall on the British husbandman, manufacturer, mariner &amp; Merchant, and consequently the trade of the Nation be wounded, and in constant danger of being eat out by those who can undersell her.—“The art of underselling, or rather of finding means to undersell, is granted is the grand secret of thrift among commercial States, as well as among individuals of the same State.—Should the British Sugar Islands ever be able to supply Great Britain and her northern Colonies with those articles, it will be time enough to think of a total prohibition; but untill that time, both prohibition and duty will be found to be diametrically opposite to the first principles of policy. Such is the extent of this Continent, and the increase of its inhabitants, that if every inch of the British sugar Islands was as well cultivated as any part of Jamaica, or Barbadoes, they would not now be able to supply Great Britain, and the Colonies on this continent. But before Such further improvements can be supposed to take place in our islands, the demands will be proportionably increased by the increase of the inhabitants on the continent. Hence the reason is plain why the British Sugar Planters are growing rich, and ever will be greater than they can possibly supply, so long as they English hold this continent, and are unrivalled in the fishery.—  
“We have every thing good and great to hope from our gracious Sovereign, his Ministry and his Parliament; and trust that when the Services and Sufferings of the British American colonies are fully known to the Mother Country, and the Nature and importance of the plantation trade more perfectly understood at home, that the most effectual measures will be taken for perpetuating the British empire in all parts of the World. An empire built upon the principles of justice, moderation and equity, the only principles that can make a State flourishing, and enable it to elude the machinations of its secret and inveterate enemies

gers, from the lenity of our government, the  
purity of our religion, the benefit of our laws,  
the advantages of our trade, and the ſecurity  
of our property, might be induced to come  
and ſettle in ſome of his Majeſty&#x27;s colonies in  
Ameiica; if they were partakers of the ad-  
vantages and privileges, which the natural  
born ſubjcts there enjoy.“  
The ſeveral acts of parliament and char-  
ters declaratory of the rights and liberties of  
the colonies, are but in affirmance of the com-  
mon law, and law of nature in this point.“  
There are, ſays my Lord Coke, regularly  
three incidents to ſubjects born. (1.) Parents  
under the actual obedience of the King. (2.)  
That the place of his birth be within the  
King&#x27;s dominions.. (3.) The time of his  
birth to be chiefly confidered : For he cannot  
be a ſubject born of one kingdom, that was  
born under the allegiance of the King of ano-  
ther kingdom ; albeit afterwards the kingdom  
deſcends to the King of the other kingdom.  
See Calvin&#x27;s caſe, and the ſeveral acts of par-  
liament and deciſions on naturalization, from  
Edward the Third to this day. The common  
law is received and practiſed upon here, and  
in the reſt of the colonies; and all antient  
and modern acts of parliament that can be  
_ conſidered as part of, or in amendment of the  
common law, together with all ſuch acts of  
parliament as expreſly name the plantations ;  
ſo that the power of the Britiſh parliament is  
held as facred and as vncontroulable in the  
| —— colonies  
  
  
( 109 ) |  
colonies as in England. The queſtion is not  
upon the general power or right of the par-  
liament, but whether it is not circumſcribed  
within ſome equitable and reaſonable bounds ?  
It is hoped it will not be conſidered as a new  
doctrine, that even the authority of the par-  
liament of Great- Britain is circumſcribed by  
certain bounds, which if exceeded, their acts  
become thoſe of meer power without right,  
and conſequently void. The judges of Eng-  
land have declared in favour of theſe ſenti-  
ments, when they expreſly declare, that ads  
of parliament againſt natural equity are void.  
That ads againſt the fundamental principles of  
| the Britiſh conſlitution are void“. This doc-  
trine  
  
— —

— 4 2  
  
A very important queſtion here preſents itſelf. It eſ-  
ſentially belongs to the ſociety to make laws both in relation  
to the manner in which it deſires to be governed, and to the  
conduct of the citizens: this is called the Legiſſative Power.  
The nation may entruſt the exerciſe of it to the Prince, or to  
an aſſembly; or to the aſſembly and the Prince jointly ; Who  
have then a right of making new, and abrogating old laws.  
It is here demanded whether, if their power extends ſo far as  
to the fundamental laws, they may change the conſtitution of  
the ſtate? The principles we have laid down lead us to decide  
this point with certainty, that the authority of theſe legiſlators  
does not extend ſo far, and that they ought to conſider the  
fundamental laws as ſacred, if the nation has not in very ex-  
preſs terms given them the power to change them. For the  
conſtitution of the ſtate ought to be fixed; and ſince that was  
firſt eſtabliſned by the nation, which afterwards truſted certain  
perſons with the legiſlative power, the fundamental laws are  
excepted from their commiſiion. It appears that the ſociety  
had only reſolved to make proviſion for the ſtate&#x27;s being always  
furniſhed with laws ſuited to particular conjunctures, and gave  
the legiſlature for that purpoſe, the power of abrogating the  
antient civil and political laws, that were not fundamental,  
and of making new ones: but nothing leads us to think that  
it was willing to ſabmit the conſtitution itſelf to their pleaſure.

In other words, that thoſe who are inveſted  
with power to protect the people, and ſup-  
port their rights and liberties, have a right to  
Make ſlaves of them. This is not very remote  
from a flat contradiction. Should the parlia-  
ment of Great-Britain follow the example of  
ſome other foreign ſtates*, and vote the King  
abſolute and deſpotic ; would ſuch an act of  
parliament make him ſo? Would any mini-

ſuch an offer of power ? It would be unſafe  
to accept of ſuch a donation, becauſe the par-  
liament or donors would grant more than was  
ever in their power lawfully to give. The law

proſecution of his rights. Thus when he has totally ſubdued  
a nation with whom he had been at war, he may without diſ-  
pute cauſe juſtice to be done him, with regard to what gave  
riſe to the war, and require payment for the expence and da-  
  
  
prudence ſo diQate, diſable it from undertaking any pernicious  
deſigns for the future. But in ſecuring all theſe views the  
mildeſt means are to be preferred. We are always to remem-  
ber, that the law of nature permits no injury to be done to an  
enemy, unleſs in taking meaſures neceſſary for a juſt defence,  
and a reaſonable ſecurity. Some princes have only impoſed a  
  
  
privileges, diſmembeting a province, or keeping it in awe by  
fortrefles ; others as their quarrel was only with the ſovereign  
in perſon, have left a nation in the full enjoyment of all its  
rights, only ſetting a ſovereign over it. But if the conquerox  
thinks proper to retain the ſovereignty of the vanquiſhed ſtate,  
and has ſuch a right; the manner in which he 1s to treat the  
ſtate {till flows from the ſame principles. If the ſovereign be  
only the juſt object of his complaint, reaſon declares that by  
  
  
to the dethroned ſovereign, and on the ſubmiſſion of his people  
he is to govern it according to the laws of the ſtate, If the  
people do not voluntarily ſubmit, the ſtate of war ſubſiſts.“  
* When a ſovereign as pretending to have the abſolute dif-  
  
  
them, he cauſes the ſtate of war to ſubſiſt between this people  
and him.” Mr. D&#x27; Vattel, B. 3. C. 10. ſec. 201.  
  
Ihe Cabots diſcovered the Continent beſore the Spaniards,  
  
(113)  
it, as the fortunate Britons have been from  
- moſt of their neighbours on the continent of  
Europe. It is for the intereſt of Great-Bri-  
| tain that her colonies ſhould be ever thus di-  
ſtinguiſhed. Every man muſt wilfully blind  
himfelf that don&#x27;t ſee the immenſe value of our  
acquiſitions 1 in the late war ; and that though  
we did not retain all at the conclufion of the  
peace that we obtained by the ſword ; yet our  
gracious Sovereign, at the ſame time that he  
has given a divine leſſon of equitable mode-  
ration to the princes of the earth, has retained  
ſufficient to make the Britiſh arms the dread of  
the univerſe, and his name dear to all poſterity.  
To the freedom of the Britiſh conſtitution,  
and to their increaſe of commerce, it is owing  
that our colonies have flouriſhed without di-  
miniſhing the inhabitants of the mother coun-  
try; quite contrary to the effects of planta-  
tions made by moſt other nations, which  
have ſuffered at home, in order to aggrandize  
themſelves abroad. This is remarkably the  
cCaſe with Spain. The ſubjeRs of a free and  
happy conſtitution of government, have a  
thouſand advantages to colonize above thoſe  
who live under deſpotic princes. We ſee how  
the Britiſh colonies on the continent, have  
vut-grown thoſe of the French, notwithſtand-  
ing they have ever eng:ged the Savages to  
keep us back. Their advantages over us in  
the Weſt-Indies are, among other caufes per-  
haps, partly owing to theſe, I. A capital neg-

black or white, will be ever cheaper than

advantages abovementioned. The French will  
ever be able to ſell their Weſt-India produce  
cheaper than our own iflanders : and yet while  
our own iſlanders can have ſuch a price for  
theirs, as to grow muchricher than the French,  
or any other of the King&#x27;s ſubjects in America,  
as is the cafe, and what the northern colonies  
  
  
her manufactures, to an immenſe value, and  
with a vaſt profit to her: it is contrary to the  
firſt principles of policy to clog ſuch a trade  
with duties, much more to prohibit it to  
the riſque if not certain deſtruction of the fiſh-  
ery. It is allowed by the molt accurate Bri-  
tiſh writers on commerce, Mr. Poſtlethwait  
in particular, who ſeems to favour the cauſe  
of the ſugar iſlands, that one half of the im-  
menſe commerce of Great-Britain is with her  
  
  
upon which the wheel of all the Britiſh com-  
merce in America turns. Without the Ame-  
rican trade, would Britain, as a 9  
  
( 115 )  
  
Nate, make any great figure at this day in Eu-  
rope ? Her trade in woollen and other manu-  
factures, is ſaid to be leſſening in all parts of  
the world, but America, where it is increaſ-  
ing, and capable of infinite increaſe, from a  
concurrence of every circumſtance in its fa-  
vour. Here is an extenſive territory of dif-  
ferent climates, which in time will conſume,  
and be able to pay for as many manufactures  
as Great-Britain and Ireland can make, if true  
maxims are purſued. The French, for rea-  
ſons already mentioned, can underwork, and  
conſequently underſell the Engliſh manufac-  
tures of Great-Britain in every market in Eu-  
rope. But they can ſend none of their ma-  
nufactures here; and it is the wiſh of every  
honeſt Britiſh American that they never may;  
it is beſt they never ſhould ; we can do better  
without the mene te of Europe, ſave  
thoſe of Great-Britain, than with them: But  
without the French Weſt-India produce we  
cannot; without it our fiſhery mult infallibly  
be ruined. When that is gone, our own  
iſlands will very poorly ſubfiſt. No Britiſh  
manufactures can be paid for by the coloniſts.  
What will follow? One of theſe two things,  
both of which it is the intereſt of Great-Bri-  
  
  
muſt be content to go naked, and turn Savages;  
or, 2. Become manufacturers of linen and  
woollen, to clothe themſelves ; which, if they  
cannot carry to the perfection of Europe, will  
be very deſtructive to the intereſts of Great-  
Britain. The. computation has been made,  
and that within bounds, and it can be de-  
monſtrated, that if North-America is only

ſides a diminution of the revenue to nearly the  
ſa ne amount. This may appear paradoxical,  
but a tew years experience of the execution of  
the ſugar act, will ſufficiently convince the  
parliament not only of the inutility, but de-  
ſt:uQive tendency of it, while calculations  
may be little attended to. That the trade  
with the col: nies has been of ſurprizing ad-  
vantage to Great-Britain, notwithſtanding the  
want of a good regulation is paſt all doubt,  
  
  
ſince ſhe began to colonize, To the growth  
of the plantations Britain is in a great mea-  
ſure indebted for her preſent richesand ſtrength,  
As the wild waſtes of America have been turn-  
ed into pleaſant habitations, and flouriſhin  
  
trading towns; ſo many of the little villages  
and bn boroughs in Great-Britain have  
put on a new face, and ſuddenly ſtarted up,  
arkets, and manufacturin  
  
towns, and opulent cities, London itlelt,  
which bids fair to be the metropolis of the  
world, is five times more populous than it was  
in the days of Queen Elizabeth. Such are the  
  
  
Hence it is manifeſt how much we all owe to  
  
  
which we have the happineſs to live.  
It is evidently the intereſt, and ought to be  
2 1  
  
(117)  
the care of all thoſe intruſted with the admini-  
ſtration of government, to ſee that every part  
of the Britiſh empire enjoys to the full the  
rights they are inti:led to by the laws, and the  
advantages which reſult from their being main-  
tained with impartiality and vigour. This we  
  
  
and preceding reigns ; and have the higheſt.  
reaſon, from the paternal care and goodneſs,  
that his Majeſty, and the Britiſh parliament,  
have hitherto been graciouſly pleaſed to diſ-  
cover to all his Majeſty&#x27;s dutiful and loyal ſub-  
jects, and to the coloniſts in particular, to reſt  
  
  
and inviolate. The connechon between Great-  
Britain and her colonies is fo natural and ſtrong,  
as to make their mutual happineſs depend upon  
their mutual ſupport. Nothing can tend more  
to the deſtruction of both, and to forward the  
meaſures of their enemies, than ſowing the  
ſeeds of jealouſy, animoſity and diflention be-  
_ tween the mother country and the colonies. |  
A conviction of the truth and importance of  
theſe principles, induced Great-Britain during  
the late war, to carry on ſo many glorious en-  
terprizes for the defence of the colonies ; and  
thoſe on their part to exert themſelves beyond  
their ability to pay, as is evident trom the Par-  
liamentary reimburſements. f  
If the ſpirit of commerce was attended to,  
perhaps, duties would be every where de-  
creaſed, if not annihilated, and prohibitions  
multiplied. Every branch of trade that hurts  
a community, ſhould be prohibited, for the

ported duty free; unleſs you would raiſe the  
price of labour by a duty on neceflaries, or  
make the above wiſe compoſition for the im-  
portation of commodities you are fure to loſe  
by. The only teſt of a uſeful commodity is  
  
the gain upon the whole to the ſtate ; ſuch  
ſhould be free ; the only teſt of a pernicious  
trade is the Joſs upon the whole, or to the  
community ; this ſhould be prohibited. If  
therefore it can be demonſtrated that the ſugar  
and molaſſes trade from the northern colonies  
to the foreign plantations is upon the whole a  
loſs to the community, by which term is here  
meant the three kingdoms and the Britiſn do-  
minions taken collectively, then, and not till  
then, ſhould this trade be prohibited. This  
never has been proved, nor can be; the con-  
trary being certain, to wit, that the nation  
upon the whole hath been a vaſt gainer by  
this trade, in the vend of and pay for its ma-  
nufactures; and a great loſs by a duty upon  
this trade will finally fall on the Britiſh huſ-  
bandman, manufacturer, mariner and mer-  
chant, and conſequentlly the trade of the na-  
tion be wounded, and in conſtant danger of  
being eat out by thoſe who can underſell her.  
The art of underſelling, or rather of finding  
means to underſell, is the grand ſecret of thrift  
among commercial ſtates, as well as among  
individuals of the ſame ſtate. Should the  
Britiſh ſugar iſlands ever be able to ſupply  
Great-Britain and her northern colonies wi:h  
_ thoſe articles, it will be time enough to think  
of a total prohibition ; but until that time,  
both prohibition and duty will be found to be  
 Gametrically oppotite to the firſt principles of  
RE policy.

and intitled to all the eſſential rights of the  
mother country. This is not only confirmed  
by the practice of the antients, but by the  
moderns ever ſince the diſcovery of America.  
Frenchmen, Spaniards, and Portugueſe are no  
greater ſlaves abroad than at home; and hi-  
therto Britons have been as free on one fide of  
the Atlantic as on the other: And its humbly  
hoped that his Majeſty and the Parliament,  
will in their wiſdom be graciouſly pleaſed to  
continue the coloniſts in this happy ſtate.  
It is preſumed, that upon theſe principles,  
the coloniſts have been by their ſeveral ==  
ters declared natural ſubjects, and entruſted  
with the power of making heir own local  
laws, not repugnant to the laws of England,  
and with he power of taxing themſelves. |  
This legiſlative power is ſubject by the ſame  
charter to the King&#x27;s negative, as in Ireland.  
This effectually ſecures the dependence of the  
colonies on Great-Britain, —By the thirteenth  
of George the Second, chapter the ninth, even  
foreigners having lived ſeven years in any of  
the colonies, are deemed natives on taking the  
oaths of allegiance, &amp;c. and are declared by  
the ſaid act to be his Majeſty&#x27;s natural born  
ſubjects of the kingdom of Great-Britain, to  
all intents, conſtructions and purpoſes, as if  
any of them had been born within the king-  
dom. The reaſons given for this naturaliza-  
tion in the preamble of the act are, that the  
increaſe of the people is the means of advanc=  
ing the wealth and ſtrength of any nation or  
country; and that many foreigners and ſtran-  
  
. gers,  
  
| ( 108)  
, from the lenity of our government, -the  
purity of our religion, the benefit of our laws,  
the advantages of our trade, and the ſecurity  
of our property, might be induced to come  
and ſettle in ſome of his Majeſty&#x27;s colonies in  
America ; if they were partakers of the ad-  
vantages&#x27; and privileges, which the natural  
  
born ſubjects there enjoyÞ.”  
The ſeveral acts of parliament and char-  
ters declaratory of the rights and liberties of  
the colonies, are but in affirmance of the com-  
mon law, and law of nature in this point.  
There are, ſays my Lord Coke, regularly  
three incidents to ſubjects born. (1) Parents  
under the actual obedience of the King. (2.)  
That the place of his birth be within the  
King&#x27;s dominions. (3) The time of his  
birth to be chiefly conſidered : For he cannot  
be a ſubject born of one kingdom, that was  
born under the allegiance of the King of ano-  
ther kingdom; albeit afterwards the kingdom  
deſcends to the King of the other kingdom.  
See Calvin&#x27;s caſe, and the ſeveral acts of par-  
liament and deciſions on naturalization, from  
Edward the Third to this day. The common  
law is received and practiſed upon here, and  
in the reſt of the colonies; and all antient  
and modern acts of parliament that can be  
conſidered as part of, or in amendment of the  
common law, together with all ſuch acts of  
parliament as expreſly name the plantations;

colonies as in England. The queſtion is not  
upon the general power or right of the par-  
  
  
within ſome equitable and reaſonable bounds ?  
It is hoped it will not be conſidered as a new  
doctrine, that even the authority of the par-  
liament of Great-Britain is e dy

become thoſe of meer power without right,

ments, when they expreſly declare, that ad.

—

1A very important queſtion here preſents itſef. It eſ-  
ſentially belongs to the ſociety to make laws both in relation  
to the manner in which it deſires to be governed, and to the  
conduct of the citizens: this is called the Legiſlative Porver.  
The nation may entruſt the exerciſe of it to the Prince, or to  
an aſſembly ; or to the aſſembly and the Prince jointly ; who  
have then a right of making new, and abrogating old laws.  
It is here demanded, whether, if their power ext ſo far as  
to the fundamental laws, they may change the conſtitution of  
the ſtate ? The principles we have laid down lead ns to decide  
this point with certainty, that the authority of theſe —  
does not extend ſo far, and that they ought to co the  
fundamental laws as ſacred, if the nation has not in very ex-  
preſs terms given them the power to change them. For the  
conſtitution of the ſtate ought to be fixed ; and fince that was  
firſt eſtabliſhed by the nation, which afterwards truſted certain  
perſons with the legiſlative r, the fundamental laws are  
excepted from their — It a that the ſociety  
had only reſolved to make proviſion for the ſtate&#x27;s being always  
furniſhed with laws ſuited to particular conjunctures, and gave

ancient civil and political laws, that were not fundamental,  
and of making new ones: but nothing leads us to think that  
it was willing to ſubmit the conſtitution itſelf to their pleaſure.

trine is agreeable to the lav. of nature and na-

it, as the fortunate . Britons have been from  
moſt of their neighbours on the continent of  
Europe. It is for the intereſt of Great-Bri-  
tain that her colonies ſhould be ever thus di-  
ſtinguiſhed. Every man muſt wilfully blind  
himſelf that don&#x27;t ſee the immenſe value of our  
acquiſitions in the late war; and that though  
we did not retain all at the concluſion of the  
&#x27; peace that we obtained by the ſword ; yet our  
2 Sovereign, at the ſame time that he  
as given a divine leſſon of equitable mode-  
ration to the princes of the earth, has retained  
ſufficient to make the Britiſh arms the dread of  
the univerſe, and his name dear to all poſterity.  
To the freedom of the Britiſh conſtitution,  
and to their increaſe of commerce, it is owing  
that our colonies have flouriſhed without di-  
miniſhing the inhabitants of the mother coun-  
try; quite contrary to the effects of planta-  
tions made by moſt other nations, which  
have ſuffered at home, in order to aggrandize  
themſelves abroad. This is remarkably the  
caſe with Spain. The ſubjects of a free and  
happy conſtitution of government, have a  
thouſand advantages to colonize above thoſe  
who live under deſpotic princes. We ſee how  
the Britiſh colonies on the continent, have  
out- grown thoſe of the French, notwithſtand-  
ing they have ever engaged the Savages to  
keep us back. Their advantages over us in  
the Weſt-Indies, are among other cauſes per-  
1 K partly owing to theſe, 1. A capital neg-  
lect in foriner reigns, in ſuffering them to  
have a firm poſſeſſion of ſo many valuable  
iſlands, that we had a better title to than  
they. 2. The French unable to puſh their  
  
2 ſet -  
  
(114)  
ſettlements effectually on the continent, have  
bent their views to the iſlands, and poured  
vaſt. numbers into them. 3. The climate  
and buſineſs of theſe iſlands is by nature much  
better adapted to Frenchmen and to Negroes,  
than to Britons. 4. The labour of ſlaves,  
black or white, will be ever cheaper than  
that of freemen, becauſe that of the individu-  
als among the former, will never be worth  
ſo much as with the latter; but this difference  
is more than ſupplied ; by numbers under the  
advantages abovementioned. The French will  
ever be able to fell their Weſt-India produce  
cheaper than our own iſlanders : and yet while  
our own iflanders can have fuch a price for  
theirs, as to grow much richer than the French,  
or any other of the King&#x27;s ſubjects in America,  
as 1s the caſe, and what the northern colonies  
take from the French, and other foreign iſlands,  
centers finally in returns to Great-Britain for  
her manufactures, to an immenſe value, and  
with a vaſt profit to her: it is contrary to the  
firſt principles of policy to clog ſuch a trade  
with duties, much more to prohibit it to  
the riſque if not certain deſtruction of the fiſh-  
cry. It is allowed by the moſt accurate Bri-  
tiſh writers on commerce, Mr. Poſtlethwait  
in particular, who ſeems to favour the cauſe  
of the ſugar iſlands, that one half of the im-  
menſe commerce of Great-Britain is with her  
colonies. It is very certain that without the  
fiſhery ſeven-cights of this commerce would  
ceaſe. The fiſhery is the center of motion,  
upon which the wheel of all the Britiſh com-  
merce in America turns. Without the Ame-  
rican trade, would Britain, as a commercial  
ſtate,  
  
( 115 )  
ſtate, make any great figure at this day in Eu-  
rope? Her trade in woollen and other manu  
factures, is ſaid to be leſſening in all parts of  
the world, but America, where it is increaſ-  
ing, and capable of infinite increaſe, from a  
concurrence of every circumſtance in its fa-  
vour. Here is an extenſive territory of dif-  
ferent climates, which in time will conſume,  
and be able to pay for as many manufactures  
as Great-Britain and Ireland can make, if true  
maxims are purſued. The French, for rea-  
ſons already mentioned, can underwork, and  
conſequently underſell the Engliſh manufac-  
tures of Great- Britain in every market in Eu-  
rope. But they can ſend none of their ma-  
nufactures here: and it is the wiſh of every  
honeſt Britiſh American that they never may;  
it is beſt they never ſhould ; we can do better  
without the manufactures of Europe, fave  
thoſe of Great-Britain, than with them: But  
without the French Weſt-India produce we  
cannot ; without it our fiſhery muſt infallibly  
be ruined. When that is gone, our own  
iſlands will very poorly ſubſiſt. No Britiſh  
manufactures can be paid for by the coloniſts.  
What will follow? One of theſe two things,  
both of which it is _ intereſt of Great-Bri-  
tain to prevent. 1. The northern coloniſts  
muſt be content to * naked, and turn Savages;  
or, 2. Become manufacturers of linen and  
woollen, to clothe themſelves ; which, if they  
cannot carry to the perfection of Europe, will  
be very deſtructive to the intereſts of Great-  
Britain. The computation has been made,  
and that within bounds, and- it &#x27;can be de-  
monſtrated, that if North-America is oaly  
  
Q 2 driven  
  
( 116 )  
driven to the fatal neceſſity of manufacturing  
a ſuit of the moſt ordinary linen or woollen  
for each inhabitant anfmally, which may be  
ſoon done, when neceſſity, the mother of  
invention, ſhall operate, Great-Britain and  
Ireland will loſe two millions per annum, be-  
ſides a diminution of the revenue to nearly the  
ſame amount. This may appear paradoxical,  
but a few years experience of the execution of  
the ſugar act, will ſufficiently convince the  
parliament not only of the inutility, but de-  
ſtructive tendency of it, while calculations  
may be little attended to. That the trade  
with the colonies has been of ſurpriſing ad-  
vantage to Great-Britain, notwithſtanding the  
want of a good regulation is paſt all doubt.  
Great-Britain is well known to have increaſed  
prodigiouſly both in numbers and in wealth  
ſince ſhe began to colonize. To the growth  
of the plantations Britain is in a great mea-  
ſure indebted for her preſent richesand ſtrength.  
As the wild waſtes of America have been turn-  
ed into pleaſant habitations, and flouriſhing  
trading towns; ſo many of the little villages  
and obſcure boroughs in Great-Britain have  
put on a new face, and ſuddenly ſtarted up,  
and become fair markets, and manufacturing  
towns, ard opulent cities. London itſelf,  
which bids fair to be the metropolis of the  
world, is five times more populous than it was  
in the days of Queen Elizabeth. Such are the  
fruits of the ſpirit of commerce and 11  
Hence it is manifeſt how much we all owe to  
that beautiful form of civil government, under  
which we have the happineſs to live.  
  
It is evidently the intereſt, and aught tobe  
e  
  
(.117-)  
  
the care of all thoſe intruſted with the admini-  
ſtration of government, to ſee that every part  
of the Britiſh empire enjoys to the full the  
rights they are entitled to by the laws, and the  
advantages which reſult from their being main-  
tained with impartiality and vigour. This we  
have ſeen reduced to practice in the preſent  
and preceding reigns; and have the higheſt  
reaſon, from the paternal care and goodneſs,  
that his majeſty, and the Britiſh parliament,  
have hitherto been graciouſly pleaſed to diſ-  
cover to all his Majeſty&#x27;s dutiful and loyal ſub-  
jects, and to the coloniſts in particular, to reſt  
ſatisfied, that our privileges will remain ſacred  
and inviolate. The connection between Great-  
Britain and her colonies is ſo natural and  
as to make their mutual happineſs depend upon  
their mutual ſupport. Nothing can tend more  
to the deſtruction of both, and to forward the  
meaſures of their enemies, than ſowing the  
. ſeeds of jealouſy, animoſity and diſſention be-  
tween the mother country and the colonies,  
  
A conviction of the truth and importance of  
theſe principles, induced Great-Britain during  
the late war, to carry on ſo many glorious en-  
terprizes for the defence of the colonies, and  
thoſe on their part to exert themſelves beyond  
their ability to pay, as is evident from the par-  
liamentary reimburſements. |  
  
If the ſpirit of commerce was attended to,  
perhaps, duties would be every where de-  
creaſed, if not annihilated, and prohibitions  
multiplied. Every branch of — that hurts  
  
  
| torſive  
  
( 118 )  
torſive uſurer. It is to no purpoſe to higgle  
with ſuch people, you are ſure to loſe by them.  
It is exactly ſo with a nation, if the balance  
is againſt them, and they can poſſibly ſubſiſt  
without the commodity, as they generally can  
in ſuch caſes, a prohibition is the only remedy ;  
for a duty in ſuch caſe, is like a compoſition  
with a thief, that for five ſhillings in the pound  
turned, he ſhall rob you at pleaſure ; when  
if the thing is examined to the bottom, you  
are at five ſhillings expence in travelling to  
get back your five ſhillings, and he is at the  
fame expence in coming to pay it, ſo he robs  
you of but ten ſhillings in the pound, that you  
thus wiſely compound for. To apply this to  
trade, I believe every duty that was ever im-  
poſed on commerce, or in the nature of things  
can be, will be found to be divided between  
the ſtate impoſing the duty, and the country  
exported from. This, if between the ſeveral  
parts of the ſame kingdom or dominions of the  
ſame Prince, can only tend to embarraſs trade,  
and raiſe the price of labour above other ſtates,  
which is of very pernicious conſequence to the  
huſbandman, manufacturer, mariner and mer-  
chant, the four tribes that ſupport the whole  
hive. If your duty is upon a commodity of a  
foreign ſtate, it is either upon the whole uſe-  
ful and gainful, and therefore neceſſary for  
the huſbandman, manufacturer, mariner or  
merchant, as finally bringing a profit to the  
ſtate by a balance in her favour; or the im-  
r will work a balance againſt your  
ate. There is no medium that we know of.  
If the commodity is of the former kind, it  
ſhould be prohibited ; but if the latter, im-  
_ porte  
  
Fd _ 1  
ported duty free; unleſs you would raiſe the  
rice of labour by a duty on neceſſaries, or  
make the above wiſe compoſition for the im-  
portation of commodities you are ſure to loſe  
by. The only teſt of a uſeful commodity is  
the gain upon the whole to the ſtate; ſuch  
ſhould be fee ; the only teſt of a pernicious  
trade is the loſs upon the whole, or to the  
community ; this ſhould be prohibited. If  
therefore it can be demonſtrated that the ſugar  
and molaſſes trade from the northern colonies  
to the foreign plantations is upon the whole a  
loſs to the community, by which term is here  
meant the three kingdoms and the Britiſh do-  
minions taken collectively, then, and not till  
then, &#x27; ſhould this trade be prohibited. This  
never has been proved, nor can be ; the con-  
trary being certain, to wit, that the nation  
upon the whole hath been a vaſt gainer by  
this trade, in the vend of and pay for its ma-  
nufactures; and a great loſs by a duty upon  
this trade will finally fall on the Britiſh huſ-  
bandman, manufacturer, mariner and mer-  
chant, and conſequently the trade of the na-  
tion be wounded, and in conſtant danger of  
being eat out by thoſe who can underſell her.  
The art of underſelling, or rather of finding  
means to underſell, is the grand ſecret of thrift  
among commercial ſtates, as well as amon  
individuals of thc ſame ſtate. Should the  
Britiſh ſugar iſlands ever be able to ſupply  
Great-Britain and her northern colonies with  
thoſe articles, it will be time enough to think  
of a total prohibition ; but until that time,  
both prohibition and duty will be found to be  
diametrically oppoſite to the firſt principles of  
  
policy.  
  
. | $544  
policy. Such the extent of this continent,  
and the increaſe of its inhabitants, that if every  
inch of the Britiſh ſugar iſlands was as wal  
cultivated as any part of Jamaica or Barbadoes,  
they would not now be able to ſupply Great-  
Britain, and the colonies on this&#x27; continent;  
But before ſuch farther improvements can be  
ſuppoſed to take place in our iſlands, the de-  
mands will be proportionably increaſed by the  
increaſe of the inhabitants on the continent.  
Hence the reaſon is plain why the Britiſh ſu-  
gar planters are growing rich, and ever will,  
  
ecauſe the demand for their produce has, and  
ever will be greater than they can poſhbly  
ſupply, ſo long as the Engliſh hold this con-  
tinent, and are unrivalled in the fiſhery.  
We have every thing good and great to hope  
from our gracious Sovereign, his Miniſtry and  
his Parliament; and truſt that when the ſervices  
and ſufferings of the Britiſh American colonies  
are fully known to the mother country, and  
the nature and importance of the plantation  
trade more perfectly underſtood at home, that  
the moſt effectual meaſures will be taken for  
perpetuating the Britiſh empire in all parts of  
the world. An empire built upon the prin-  
ciples of juſtice, moderation and equity, the  
only principles that can make a ſtate flouriſh-  
ing, and enable it to elude the machinations  
of its ſecret and inveterate enemies

do no wrong, though it may do several things that look  
pretty odd, and illustrates the effect of narrow views of  
policy, of the doctrine of ‘the omnipotence of Parliament,’  
and of the consequent unfamiliarity with questions of gen-  
eral jurisprudence upon judges of the greatest vigor of  
mind and of the profoundest learning in the municipal law  
and in the forms and usages of the judicial system of their  
own country.”
