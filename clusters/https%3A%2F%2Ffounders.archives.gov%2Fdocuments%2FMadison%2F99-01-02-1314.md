					&quot;In consequence of the just objections which your conduct had furnished against your continuance here as the organ of communication on the part of His Catholic Majesty, it was signified at Madrid, in the Month of April last, thro’ the Mission of the United

					This letter was answered, on the succeeding day, by one in which he prefixes to some very unsound remarks, in terms not always the most delicate, on his transactions with the Philadelphia Editor; and on the letter of the American Ministers requiring his  
						recall, a declaration in these words: &quot;As I have not come to form plots, to excite conspiracies, or to promote any attempts against the Government of the United States, and as, to this hour, I have not directly or indirectly committed acts of that tendency, which alone could justify the tenor and object of your letter, to which I now reply, it results that my coming was an act innocent, legal, and which leaves me in possession of all my rights and privileges both as a public man, and a private  
						individual. Making use of these I intend to remain in the City of four miles square, in which the Government resides, as long as may suit the interests of the King my Master, and my own personal convenience; adding as I ought to do, that I shall not lose sight of these two  
						considerations, in relation to the time and the season, of fulfilling our mutual wishes for my departure from the United States.&quot;
