Or, if a poetical dress will be more acceptable to the fancy of the Juvenile student;  
‘Quisnam igitur liber? Sapiens, sibique imperiosus:  
Quem neque pauperies, neque mors, neque vincula terrent:  
  
Responsare cupidinibus, contemnere honores  
Fortis, et in seipso totus teres, atque rotundus;  
Externi ne quid valeat per laeve morari:  
In quem manca ruit semper Fortuna.’
