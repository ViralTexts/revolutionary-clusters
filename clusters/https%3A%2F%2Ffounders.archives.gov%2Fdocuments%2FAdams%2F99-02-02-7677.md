The grounds and principles on which the “3third article of the Treaty of 83. was contended for on our part and finally yielded on the part of the British” were these. First, that the Americans and the adventurers to America were the first discoverers and the first practisers of the fisheries. 2dly That New England and especially Massachusetts, had done more in defence of them, than all the rest of the British Empire. That the various projected expeditions to Canada, in which they were defeated by British negligence; the conquest of Louis-burg in ’45—the subsequent conquest of Nova Scotia, in which New England had expended more blood and treasure than all the rest of the British Empire, were principally effected with a special view to the security and protection of the fisheries. 3dly: That the Inhabitants of the United States had as clear a right to every branch of these Fisheries, and to cure fish on Land, as the inhabitants of Canada or Nova Scotia. That the Citizens of Boston, New York or Philadelphia, had as clear a right to those fisheries and to cure fish on land, as the inhabitants of London, Liverpool, Bristol, Glasgow or Dublin. 4thly. That Third Article was demanded as an ultimatum, and it was declared that no Treaty of peace should ever be made without that Article. And when the British Ministers found that peace could not be made without that Article, they consented; for Britain wanted peace if possible more than we did—5thly. We asked no favour we requested no grant and would accept none. We demanded it as a Right, and we demanded an explicit acknowledgement of that, as an indispensable condition of peace; and the Word Right was in the article as agreed to by the British Minister, but they afterwards requested that the word Liberty might be substituted instead of Right; they say it amounted to the same thing, for liberty was right and privilege was right, but the word right might be more unpleasing to the People of England than Liberty, and we did not think it necessary to contend for a word.—To detail the conferences and conversations which took place for six weeks on this subject, would require volumes if they could now be remembered.

Montezillo, Aug. 10, 1822.  
  
Dear Sir--The grounds and principles on which  
the third article of the treaty of ’83 was contended  
for on our part, and finally yielded on the part of  
the British, were these: First, that the Americans  
and the adventurers to America were the first dis-  
coverers and the first practisers of the fisheries.—  
2diy. That New-England, and, especially, Massa-  
chusetts, had done more in defence of them, than  
all the rest of the British empire; that the various  
projected expeditions to’ Canada, in which they  
were defeated by British negligence; the conquest  
of Louisburg in °45; the subsequent conquest of  
Nova Scotia, in which New-England had expended  
more blood and treasure than all the rest of the  
British empire, were principally effected with a  
special view to the security and protection of the  
tisheries. Sdly. That the inhabitants of the Unit-  
ed States had as clear a right to every branch of  
these fisheries, and to cure fish on land, as the in-  
habitants of Canada or Nova Scotia; that the citi-  
zens of Boston, New-York, or Philadelphia, had  
as clear a right to those fisheries, and to cure fish on  
land, as the inhabitants of London, Liverpool, Bris-  
  
—  
  
ticle was demanded as an ultimatum, and it was de-  
clared that no treaty of peace should ever be made  
without that article. And when the British minis-  
ters found that peace could not be made without  
that article, they consented; for Britain wanted  
peace, if possible, more than we did. 5thly. We  
asked no favor; we requested no grant, and would  
accept none. We demanded it asa right, and we  
demanded an explicit acknowledgment of that  
right, as an indispensable condition of peace; and  
the word “right” was in the article as agreed to by  
the British minister, but they afterwards requested  
that the word “liberty” might be substituted in-  
stead of right; they said it amounted to the same  
thing, for iberty was right, and privilege was right,  
but the word right might be more displeasing to  
the people of England than dderty, and we did  
not think it necessary to contend fora word. To  
detail the conferences and conversations, which  
took place for six weeks on this subject, would  
require volumes, if they could be remembered.—  
Mr. Jay is the only person now living, who was  
officially concerned in that negociation, and I am  
not afraid to appeal to his memory for the truth of  
these facts.  
  
Lord St. Hellens, then Mr. Fitzherbert, though  
not officially concerned in the negociation, was in-  
structed by the British minister to assist at our  
conferences, and he was freely and candidly admit-  
ted by us. I dare appeal to his lordship’s memory  
for the truth of these facts. There is another ex-  
cellent character still living, Mr. Benj. Vaughan,  
of Hallowell, Maine, who was then a confidential  
friend of lord Shelburn, and an intimate friend  
to the British negociators, and I dare appeal to his  
recollections of the representations made to him  
of the conferences concerning the fisheries,  
- Oswald, Mr. Fitzherbert, and Mr. White-  
  
9  
6thly. We considered that treaty as a division of  
the empire. Our independence, our rights to ter-  
ritory and to the fisheries, as practised before the  
revolution, were no more a grant from Great Bri-  
tain to us, than the treaty was a grant from us of  
Canada, Nova Scotia, England, Scotland and Ire-  
land, to the Britons. The treaty was nothing more  
than mutual acknowledgments of antecedent rights.  
  
If there isany other question that you wish me to  
answer, I shall be happy to do it, so long as my  
strength may last.  
  
Thad omitted what follows: 7thly. We urged  
upon the British ministers, that it was the interest  
of England herself,that we should hold fast forever  
all the rights contained in. that article, because all  
the profits we make of those fisheries went regu-  
larly to Great Britain in gold and silver to pur-  
chase and pay for their manufactures; that if it  
were in her power, which it was not, to exclude  
us from, or abridge these rights, they would be the  
dupes of their own weak policy.  
  
Sthly. That if we should consent to an exclu-  
sion, the stipulation would not be regarded; our bold  
and hardy seamen would trespass; they must keep  
a standing naval force On the coast to prevent  
them; our people would fight and complain, and  
this would be speedily and infallibly the source  
of another war between the two nations.

fisheries. We were the denizens of all the English empire  
upon our coast, from the equator to Labrador. In the natu-  
ral connexion of this important subject, we cannot forbear  
to quote the doctrine of the venerable John Adams, to whom  
New-England is so much indebted for the preservation of her  
most valuable interests. We considered the treaty of 1783, he  
said, as a division of the empire. Our independence, our rights  
to territory and to the fisheries, as practised before the Revolu-  
tion, were no more a grant from Britain to us, than the treaty  
was a grant Jrom us of Canada, JVova Scotia, 4~c. The  
treaty was nothing more than mutual acknowledgments of  
antecedent rights. In defence of a portion of those rights,  
particularly the fisheries, New-England, and especially Massa-  
chusetts, had done more than all the rest of the British empire.  
In the various projected expeditions to Canada, not defeated  
through their negligence, in the conquest of Louisburgh in  
1745, in the final conquest of Nova Scotia, New-England  
had expended more blood and treasure, than all the rest of the  
British empire. In regard to that portion of these rights, mos
