d to insert in the margin, the  
extract from the &quot;Federalist&quot; referred to in the text. Be so good as to supply the omission by subjoining in the margin  
the following transcribed passages from No. 39.*  
*No. 39. &quot;It is true, that in controversies relating to the boundary between the two jurisdictions, the tribunal which is  
ultimately to decide, is to be established under the general government. But this does not change the principle of the  
case. The decision is to be impartially made, according to the rules of the Constitution; and all the usual and most  
effectual precautions are taken to secure this impartiality. Some such tribunal is clearly essential to prevent an appeal  
to the sword, and a dissolution of the compact; and that it ought to be established under the general, rather than under  
the local governments; or, to speak more properly, that it could be safely established under the first alone, is a  
position not likely to be combated.&quot;  
Perhaps it may be not amiss, also to erase from the date of the letter, the day of  
the month, making the entire month the date. With cordial esteem
