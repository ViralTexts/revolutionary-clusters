The Orators task was not without its delicacy and its difficulty—His duty was to pronounce a Panegyric, and all the titles of his Hero to Glory were acquired in contending against the cause for which he finally lost his life—There were no services to the Russian Empire to speak of, for the first day of his active service had terminated his Career—
