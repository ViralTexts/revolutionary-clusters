rfectly sure of having the command of it in their own hands though in the king’s name.At the Court of St. James’, the 6th of June, 1783, present the king’s most excellent majesty in council—Whereas by an act of parliament passed this session, intitled “An act for preventing certain instruments from being required from ships belonging to the United States of America, and to give to his majesty for a limited time, certain powers, for the better carrying on trade and commere between the subjects of his majesty’s dominions and the inhabitants of the said United States;&quot; it is owing among other things enacted, that during the continuance of the said act, it shall and may be lawful for his majesty in council, by order or orders to be issued and published from time to time, to give such directions and to make such regulations with respect to duties, drawbacks or otherwise, for carrying on the trade and commerce between the people and territories belonging to the crown of Great Britain, and the people and territories of the said United States, as to his majesty in council shall appear most expedient and salutary, any law, usage or custom to the contrary notwithstanding. His Majesty doth, therefore, by and with the advice of his privy council, hereby order and direct, that pitch, tar, turpentine, indigo, masts, yards and bowsprits, being the growth or production of any of the United States of America, may, until further order, be imported directly from thence into any ports of this kingdom, either in British or American ships, by British subjects or by any of the people inhabiting in and belonging to the said United States or any of them; and that the articles above recited shall and may be entered and landed in a port of this kingdom, upon payment of the same duties, as the same are or may be subject and liable to, if imported by British subjects in British ships from any British island or plantation in America, and no other, notwithstanding such pitch, tar, turpentine, indigo, masts, yards and bowsprits, or the ships in which the same may be brought, may not be accompanied with the certificates or other documents heretofore required by law; and his majesty is hereby farther pleased, by and  
  
with the advice aforesaid to order and direct, that any tobacco, being the growth or production of any of the territories of the said United States of America, may likewise, until further order, be imported directly from thence, in manner above mentioned, and may be landed in this kingdom and upon the importer paying down in ready money the duty commonly called the old subsidy, such tobacco may be warehoused under his majesty’s locks, upon the importer’s own bond for payment of all the farther duties due for such tobacco, within the time limited by law, according to the net weight and quantity of such tobacco at the time it shall be so landed, with the same allowances for the payment of such farther duties, and under the like restrictions and regulations in all other respects, not altered by this order, as such tobacco is and may be warehoused by virtue of any act or acts of parliament in force. And the right honorable the lords commissioners of his majesty’s treasury, and the lords commissioners of the admiralty, are to give the necessary directions herein, as to them may respectively appertain.Signed, Stephen Cottrell.To
