No sooner was I able to move; than I found it necessary to make a Bustle amongst the waiters, and demand a Cleaner abode; by this time Brisler was upon his feet; and as I found I might reign mistress on Board without any offence I soon exerted my Authority with scrapers mops Brushes, infusions of viniger; &amp;c. and in a few hours you would have thought yourself in a different Ship.

Our accommodations on Board are not what I could wish, or hoped for. We cannot be alone, only when the Gentlemen are thoughtfull enough to retire upon deck, which they do for about an hour in the course of the day; our state rooms are about half as large as Cousin Betsys little Chamber, with two Cabbins in each. Mine had 3, but I could not live so; upon which Mrs. Adams’es Brother gave up his Berth to Nabby, and we are now stowed, two and two. This place has a small grated window, which opens into the Companion, and is the only air admitted. The door opens into the Cabbin where the Gentlemen all Sleep; and where we sit dine &amp;c. We can only live with our door Shut, whilst we dress and undress. Necessity has no law, but what should I have thought on shore; to have layed myself down to sleep, in common with half a dozen Gentlemen? We have curtains it is true, and we only in part undress, about as much as the Yankee Bundlers, but we have the satisfaction of falling in, with a set of well behaved, decent Gentlemen, whose whole deportment is agreeable to the strickest delicacy both in words and action.

 I did not write every day, I should lose the days of the month, and of the week, confined all day to day on account of the weather; which is foggy, misty, and wet. You can hardly judge how urksome this confinement is; when the whole ship is at our Service; it is little better than a prison; we Suppose ourselves near the western Islands. O dear variety! how pleasing to the humane mind is Change; I cannot find such a fund of entertainment within myself as not to require outward objects for my amusement. Nature abounds with variety, and the mind unless fixed down by habit, delights in contemplating new objects, and the variety of Scenes which present themselves to the Senses, were certainly designd to prevent our attention from being too long fixed upon any one object; and this says a late celebrated medical writer; greatly conduces to the Health of the animal frame.

ocked from side to side with a force you can form no Idea of without experience; I have been more wearied and worn out with the motion and exercise of a calm, than in rideing 50 miles in a day. We have had 3 days in succession nearly calm. The first is the most troublesome, as the motion of the Sea Subsides in a degree. It is however a great trial of ones patience, to think yourself within a few days of your desired port, to look at it, as the promised land; and yet to be held fast.  
  
  
“Ye too ye winds, I raise my voice to you  
In what far distant region of the Sky  
Hush’d in deep Silence, Sleep you when tis Calm?”  
  
I begin to think that a Calm is not desireable in any situation in life, every object is most Beautifull in motion, a ship under sail trees Gently agitated with the wind, and a fine women danceing, are 3 instances in point; Man was made for action, and for Bustle too I believe. I am quite out of conceit with calms. I have more reason for it too, than many others, for the dampness of the ship has for several day threatned me with the Rheumatisim, and yesterday morning I was seazed with it in good earnest; I could not raise my Head, nor get out of bed without assistance, I had a good deal of a fever and was

Canteburry is a larger town than Boston, it contains a Number of old Gothick Cathedrals, which are all of stone very heavy, with but few windows which are grated with large Bars of Iron, and look more like jails for criminals, than places designd for the worship of the deity. One would Suppose from the manner in which they are Gaurded, that they apprehended devotion would be stolen. They have a most gloomy appearence and realy made me shudder.

From Chatham we proceeded, on our way as fast as possible wishing to pass Black Heath before dark. Upon this road, a Gentleman alone in a chaise past us, and very soon a coach before us stoped, and there was a hue and cry, a Robbery a Robbery. The Man in the chaise was the person robbed and this in open day with carriages constantly passing. We were not a little allarmed and every one were concealing their money. Every place we past, and every post chaise we met were crying out a Robbery. Where the thing is so common I was Surprized to see such an allarm. The Robber was pursued and taken in about two miles, and we saw the poor wretch gastly and horible, brought along on foot, his horse rode by a person who took him; who also had his pistol. He looked like a youth of 20 only, attempted to lift his hat, and looked Dispair. You can form some Idea of my feelings when they told him aya, you have but a short time, the assise set next Month, and then my Lad you Swing. Tho every robber may deserve Death yet to exult over the wretched is what our Country is not accustomed to. Long may it be free of such villianies and long may it preserve a commisiration for the wretched.

The American Ladies are much admired here by the Gentlemen, I am told, and in truth I wonder not at it. O my Country; my Country; preserve; preserve the little purity and simplicity of manners you yet possess. Believe me, they are jewells of inestimable value.

From thence I went to see the celebrated Mrs. Wright, Mr. Storer, and Smith, accompanying us. Upon my entrance (my Name being sent up) she ran to the Door, caught me by the Hand, “Why is it realy and in truth Mrs. Adams, and that your daughter? Why you dear Soul you, how young you look! Well I am glad to See you, all of you Americans! Well I must kiss you all.” Having passt the ceremony upon me and Nabby, she runs to the Gentleman. “I make no distinction,” says she, and gave them a hearty Buss, from which we had all rather have been excused; for her appearence is quite the slattern. “I love every body that comes from America,” says she, “here,” running to her desk, “is a card I had from Mr. Adams. I am quite proud of it, he came to see and made me a noble present, dear creature I design to have his Head.” “There,” says she pointing to an old Man and women who were sitting in one corner of the room, “is my old Father and Mother. Dont be ashamed of them because they look so. They were good folks,” (these were there figures in wax work), “they turnd quakers and never would let their children eat meat, and that is the reason we were all so injenious; you had heard of the ingenious Mrs. Wright in America I suppose.” In this manner She ran on for half an hour. Her person and countanance resemble an old maiden in your Neighbourhood Nelly Penniman, except that one is neat, the other the Queen of sluts, and her tongue runs like, Unity Badlams. There was an old Clergyman sitting reading a paper in the midle of the room, and tho I went prepaird to See strong representations of real Life, I was effectually deceived in this figure for 10 minuts, and was finally told that it was only Wax.

and her orchard, to attend her husband at the Court of St. James ;  
and we see the purity and strength of her character, in the supe-  
tiority she evidently displays, to the brilliant and seductive fol-  
lies of fashionable circles. In these circles, her virtues were  
much admired, even by those whose manners were opposed  
to them; and she reports something similar of her coun-  
trywomen in general.  
  
“The American ladies are much admired here by the gentlemen, I  
am told, and in truth I wonder not at it. O, my country, my country!  
preserve the little purity and simplicity of manners you yet possess.  
Believe me, they are jewels of inestimable value; the softness, pecu-

men, is wholly laid aside here for the masculine attire and manners of

‘ From Chatham we proceeded on our way as fast as possible, wishing  
to pass Blackheath before dark. Upon this road, a gentleman alone in  
a chaise passed us, and very soon a coach before us stopped, and there  
was a hue and cry, “ A robbery, a robbery!” The man in the chaise  
was the person robbed, and this in open day with carriages constantly  
passing. We were not a little alarmed, and every one was concealing  
his money. Every place we passed and every post-chaise we met was  
crying out, “ A robbery!”? Where the thing is so common, I was sur-  
prised to see such an alarm. The robber was pursued and taken in  
about two miles, and we saw the poor wretch, ghastly and horrible,  
brought along on foot; his horse ridden by a person who took him,  
who also had his pistol. He looked like a youth of twenty only, at-  
tempted to lift his hat, and looked despair. You can form some idea of  
my feelings when they told him, “Ay, you have but a short time; the  
assize sits next month; and then, my lad, you swing.” Though every  
robber may deserve death, yet to exult over the wretched is what our  
country is not accustomed to. Long may it be free from such villanies,  
and long may it preserve a commiseration for the wretched ! —vol. ii

her; but, with a little pardonable self-complacency,  
Mrs. Abigail says, “ No sooner was I able to move than  
I found it necessary to make a bustle among the waiters,  
and, as I found I might reign mistress on board,  
without any offence, I soon exerted my authority with

enough to retire upon deck, which they do for about an hour in the course of

buss, from which we would all rather have been excused, for her appear-  
ance is quite the slattern. ‘I love everybody that comes from America,’
