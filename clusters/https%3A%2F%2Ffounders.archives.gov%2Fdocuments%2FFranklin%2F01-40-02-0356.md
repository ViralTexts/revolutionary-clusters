comes by sale from the state. However operative it may be  
as to citizens of the state, (on which it is unnecessary to  
give any opinion), the question before us is, whether such  
improvements can be claimed in this case consistently with  
the treaty of peace of 1783.  
  
By the fifth article of that treaty, it is agreed, “ that all  
persons who have any interest in confiscated lands, either  
by debts, marriage settlements, or otherwise, shall mect with  
no lawful impediment in the prosecution of their just rights.”  
By the sixth article it is agreed, that, “ there shall be no  
future confiscations made, nor any prosecutions commenced  
against any person or persons for or by reason of the part  
which he or they may have taken in the war; and that no  
person shall on that account suffer any future loss or dam-  
age, either in his person, liberty, or property.” We think,  
that the truce efiect of these provisions is to guaranty to the  
party all the rights and interests which he then had in con-  
fiscated and other lands, in the full force and vigour which  
they then possessed. He was to mect with no impediment

interpretation of the treaty which terminated the Revolutionary  
War in 1784. But, unfortunately, its language was differently  
interpreted by the contracting parties. It provided that the  
American frontier should begin “from the north-west angle of

the Atlantic Ocean.” But what was meant by the rivers falling

St. John be thus described ? or were those rivers only intended  
which flowed directly into the sea? In other words, was the line  
to be drawn north and south of the upper bend of the St. John ?
