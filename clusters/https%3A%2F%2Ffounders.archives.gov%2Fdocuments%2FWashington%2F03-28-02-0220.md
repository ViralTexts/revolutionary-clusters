The Board of General officers appointed to examine into the Case of Major André have reported:  
  
  
1st  
“That he came on shore from the Vulture sloop of War in the night of the 21st of September last on an interview with General Arnold in a private and secret manner.  
  
  
2dly  
“That he changed his dress within our Lines and under a feigned name and in a disguised habit passed our works at Stoney and Vere-Planks Points the Evening of the 22d of September last and was taken the morning of the 23d of September last at Tarrytown in a disguised habit being  
then on his way to New York; and when taken he had in his possession several Papers which contain’d intelligence for the Enemy.”  
  
  
The Board having maturely considered these Facts do also report to his Excellency General Washington:  
“That Major Andrè Adjutant General to the British Army ought to be considered as a spy from the Enemy and that agreeable to the Law and usage of nations it is their opinion he ought to suffer Death.”  
The Commander in Chief directs the execution of the above Sentence in the usual way this afternoon at five ô clock precisely.  
At a divison General Court martial the 11th of September last Lieutenant Colonel Commandant sherman President Major Albert Chapman was tried upon the following Charges:  
  
  
1st  
“For Embezzling public property and endeavouring to induce the Quartermaster of the regiment to assist him in embezzling powder for his own private use.  
  
  
2d  
“For making up two enormous bills against Colonel Nelson an inhabitant of Morristown for taking up a strayed horse the property of said Nelson and that without any expence to himself.  
  
  
3d  
“For giving a Certificate to a soldier in the 7th regiment that he was inlisted for three years only, when he had repeatedly mus-ter’d him for during the war and sworn to the Muster Rolls.[”]  
  
  
The Court on considering the first and third Charges against Major Chapman are of opinion the charge of Embezzling public property is not supported therefore do acquit him of it; but find him guilty of the other part of the first and third charge being a breach of Article 5th  Section 18th of the Articles of War and do sentence him to be reprimanded in Division orders.  
The General is sorry to be under the disagreeable necessity of differing in opinion with the Court, but he thinks the Sentence entirely inadequate to charges of

lency, General Washington: That Major  
André, Adjutant-General to the British  
army, ought to be considered as a spy from  
the enemy, and that agreeably to the law  
and usage of nations, it is their opinion he  
ought to suffer ‘‘ DEATH.’’  
  
The Commander-in-Chief directs the  
execution of the above sentence in the  
usual way, this afternoon at five o’clock  
precisely.  
  
At a division general court-martial, the  
11th of September last, Lieu&#x27;-Col? Com*  
Sherman president, Major Albert Chap-  
man was tried upon the following charges :  
  
1st. For embezzling public property and  
endeavoring to induce the Q. M. of the  
regiment to assist him in embezzling pow-  
der for his own private use.  
  
2d. For making up two enormous bills  
against Colonel Nelson, an inhabitant of  
Morristown, for taking up a strayed horse,  
the property of said Nelson, and that with-  
out any expense to himself.  
  
3d. For giving a certificate to a soldier  
in the 7th regiment that he was enlisted  
for three years only, when he had repeat-  
edly mustered him for during the war and  
sworn to the muster rolls.  
  
The Court, on considering the 1st and  
3d charges against Major Chapman, are of  
opinion that the charge of embezzling  
public property is not supported, therefore  
do acquit him of it; but find him guilty  
of the other part of the rst and 3d charges,  
being a breach of article 5th section 18th  
of the articles of war, and do sentence  
him to be reprimanded in Division Orders.  
  
The General is sorry to be under the  
disagreeable necessity of differing in  
opinion with the court, but he thinks the  
sentence entirely inadequate to charges of
