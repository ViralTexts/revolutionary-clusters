The interest, which you have taken in the safety of John Mitchell, as expressed in your letter of the 19th of January last, would be an inducement to me to go, as far in relieving him, as public propriety will admit. But the Attorney-general having made a report of which the enclosed is a copy, I think it advisable to postpone the further consideration until his trial shall have taken place.  
It has afforded me great pleasure to learn, that the general conduct &amp; character of the Army has been temperate &amp; indulgent; and that your attention to the quiet and comfort of the western inhabitants has been well received by them. Still it may be proper constantly &amp; strongly to impress upon the Army that they are mere agents of Civil power: that out of Camp, they have no other authority, than other citizens: that offences against the laws are to be examined not by a military officer, but by a Magistrate: that they are not exempt from arrests and indictments for violations of the law; that officers ought to be careful, not to give orders, which may lead the agents into infractions of law; that no compulsion be used towards the inhabitants in the traffic, carried on between them and the army: that disputes be avoided, as much as possible, and be adjusted as quickly as may be, without  
  
urging them to an extreme: and that the whole country is not to be considered as within the limits of the camp.

aufor. Aper several years&#x27; of service in the  
executive &#x27;chair, he found himself confronted  
with what was then esteemed a formidable insur  
rection. It was under such circumstruces that  
he carefully penned instructions to the General  
commanding the forces for putting down the re­  
bellion. We have published the whole order.  
We republish here a single paragraph:

impress upon the army that they are the mere  
agents of civil power; that they have no more  
authority tha itizens; that offense  
against th be examined, not by a  
military magistrate.  
Such was the language of the first President.  
Every true American citizen knows that he  
rightly interpreted the relations of the military  
to the civil authority. &quot;The army are mere  
agents of civil power.&quot; The words should be  
impressed deep upon the hearts of the American  
people; nung in gold upon the national banner;  
engraven deep upon the very rocks of the earth  
our race of freemen tread.  
It is unnecessary to compare the conduct of  
WAshingron and of Lincoln. The contrast is  
as apparent as it is great. Washington declared  
that offenses against the law are to be examined  
not by a military officer but by a magistrate.&quot;
