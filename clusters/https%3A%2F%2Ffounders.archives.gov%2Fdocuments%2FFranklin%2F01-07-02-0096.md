e goldsmith’s business, he must remember that there is one accomplishment without which he cannot possibly thrive in that trade, (i.e. to be perfectly honest). It is a business that though ever so uprightly managed, is always liable to suspicion; and if a man is once detected in the smallest fraud it soon becomes public, and every one is put upon their guard against him; no one will venture to try his hands, or trust him to make up their plate; so at once he is ruined. I hope my nephew will therefore establish a character as an honest and faithful, as well as skilful workman, and then he need not fear employment.  
And now as to what you propose for Benny I believe he may be, as you say, well enough qualified for it, and when he appears to be settled, if a vacancy should happen, it is very probable he may be thought of to supply it; but it is a rule with me, not to remove any officer that behaves well, keeps regular accounts, and pays duly; and I think the rule is founded on reason and justice. I have not shown any backwardness to assist Benny, where it could be done without injuring another. But if my friends require of me to gratify not only their inclinations, but their resentments, they expect too much of me. Above all things I dislike family quarrels, and when they happen among my relations, nothing gives me more pain. If I were to set myself up as a judge of those subsisting between you and brother’s widow and children, how unqualified must I be, at this distance, to determine rightly, especially having heard but one side. They always treated me with friendly and affectionate regard, you have done the same. What can I say between you, but that I wish you were reconciled, and that I will love that side best that is most ready to forgive and oblige the other. You will be angry with me here, for putting you and them too much upon a footing, but I shall nevertheless be, Dear sister, your truly Affectionate brother,  
B.

* Above all things, I dislike family quarrels,  
and when they happen among my relations  
nothing gives me more pain. If I were to set  
myself up as a judge of those subsisting be-  
tween you and your brother&#x27;s widow and chil-  
dren, how unqualified must I be at this distance  
to determine rightly, especially having heard  
butone side. They always treated me with  
friendly and affectionate regard; you have done  
the same. What can I say between you but  
that I wish you were reconciled, and that I will  
love that side best that is most ready to forgive  
and oblige the other. You will be angry with  
me here for putting you and them too much  
upon a footing, but I shall nevertheless be, dear  
sister, your very aftectionate brother.”
