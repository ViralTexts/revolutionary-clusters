In Committee of Safety  
In Obedience to the above Order of Congress, this Committee have enquired into the Premises, and, upon the best Information obtained, find, that the Commanders of the New England Army  about the 14th. ultimo received Advice that Genl. Gage had issued Orders for a Party of Troops under his Command, to post themselves on Bunkers Hill, a Promontory just at the Entrance of the Peninsula of Charlestown; upon which it was determined, with the Advice of this Committee, to send a Party who might erect some Fortifications upon said Hill and defeat this Design of our Enemies. Accordingly on the 16th. Ultimo Orders were issued that a Detachment of one thousand Men should march that Evening to Charlestown, and entrench upon that Hill; just before 9 oClock they left Cambridge, and proceeded to Breeds Hill, situated on the further Part of the Peninsula West of Boston, for by some Mistake this Hill was marked out for the Entrenchment instead of the other; many things being necessary to be done preparatory to the Entrenchments being thrown up, which could not be done before lest the Enemy should discover and defeat the Design, it was nearly 12 oClock before the Works were entered upon. They were then carried on with the utmost Diligence and Alacrity, so that by the Dawn of the Day, they had thrown up a small Redoubt about eight Rods square; at this Time an heavy Fire began from the Enemy’s Ships, a Number of floating Batteries and from the Fortifications of the Enemy on Cops Hill in Boston, directly opposite to our little Redoubt; an incessant Shower of Shot and Bombs was rained by these upon our Works, by which only one Man fell; the Provincials continued to labour indefatigably till they had thrown up a small Breastwork extending from the East Side of the Redoubt to the Bottom of the Hill, but were prevented from compleating it by the intolerable Fire of the Enemy.  
Between 12 and 1 oClock a Number of Boats and Barges filled with the regular Troops, from Boston, were observed approaching towards Charlestown; these Troops landed at a Place called Moretons Point situated a little to the Eastward of our Works; this Brigade formed upon their landing, and stood thus formed till a second Detachment arrived from Boston to join them: having sent out large flank Guards, they began a very slow March towards our Lines; at this instant Smoak and Flames were seen to arise from the Town of Charlestown, which had been set on Fire by the Enemy, that the Smoak might cover their Attack upon our Lines, and perhaps with a Design to rout and destroy one or two Regiments of Provincials who had been posted in that Town; if either of these was their Design, they were disappointed, for the Wind shifting on a sudden carried the Smoak another Way, and the Regiments were already removed. The Provincials within their Entrenchments impatiently waited the Attack of the Enemy, and reserved their Fire till they came within ten or twelve Rods, and then began a furious Discharge of small Arms; this Fire arrested the Enemy, which they for some Time returned without advancing a Step, and then retreated in Disorder, and with great Precipitation to the Place of landing, and some of them sought Refuge within their Boats; here their Officers were observed, by the Spectators on the opposite Shore, to run down to them, using the most passionate Gestures, and pushing their Men forward with their Swords; at length they rallied and marched up with apparent Reluctance to the Entrenchment; the Americans again reserved their Fire untill the Enemy came within 5 or 6 Rods, and a second Time put the Regulars to Flight, who ran in great Confusion towards their Boats; similar and superior Exertions were now necessarily to be made by the Officers, which, notwithstanding the Men discovered an almost insuperable Reluctance to fighting in this Cause, were again successfull; they formed once more, and having brought some Cannon to bear in such a Manner as to rake the Inside of the Breastwork from one End of it to the other, the Provincials retreated within their little Fort; the Ministerial Army now made a decisive Effort; the Fire from the Ships and Batterys as well as from the Cannon in the Front of their Army was redoubled; the Officers in the Rear of their Army were observed to goad forward the Men with renewed Exertions, and they attacked the Redoubt on three Sides at once; the Breastwork on the outside of the Fort was abandoned, the Ammunition of the Provincials was expended, and few of their Arms were fixed with Bayonets, can it then be wondered that the Word was given by the Commander of the Party to retreat? but this he delayed till the Redoubt was half filled with Regulars, and the Provincials had kept their Enemy at Bay—for some Time confronting them with the Butts of their Muskets. The Retreat of this little handful of brave Men would have been effectually cut off had it not happened that the flanking Party of the Enemy, which was to have come upon the Back of the Redoubt was checked by a Party of Provincials, who fought with the utmost Bravery, and kept them from advancing further than the Beach; the Engagement of these two Parties was kept up with the utmost Vigor, and it must be acknowledged that this Party of the Ministerial Troops evidenced a Courage worthy a better Cause; all their Efforts however were insufficient to compel the Provincials to retreat till their main Body had left the Hill; percieving this was done, they then gave Ground, but with more Regularity than could be expected of Troops who had been no longer under Discipline, and many of whom never before saw an Engagement.  
In this Retreat the Americans had to pass over the Neck which joins the Peninsula of Charlestown to the main Land; this Neck was commanded by the Glascow—Man of War, and two floating Batteries placed in such a Manner as that their Shot raked every Part of it; the incessant Fire kept up across this Neck had from the Beginning of the Engagement prevented any considerable Reinforcement from getting to the Provincials on the Hill and it was feared that it would cut off their retreat, but they retired over it with little or no Loss.  
With a ridiculous Parade of Triumph, the Ministerial Troops again took Possession of the Hill which had served them as a Retreat in their Flight from the Battle of Concord; it was expected that they would prosecute the supposed Advantage they had gained by marching immediately to Cambridge which was distant but two Miles, and was not then in a State of Defence; this they failed to do; the Wonder excited by such Conduct soon ceased, when by the best Accounts from Boston we were told, that out of three thousand Men who marched out upon this Expedition, no less than fifteen hundred (ninety two of which were commissioned Officers) were killed or wounded, and about twelve hundred of them either killed or mortally wounded; such a Slaughter was perhaps never before made on British Troops in the Space of about an Hour, during which the Heat of the Engagement lasted, by about fifteen hundred Men, which were the most that were at any one Time engaged on the American Side.  
The Loss of the New England Army amounted according to an exact Return, to one hundred and forty five killed and missing, and between three and four hundred and four wounded; thirty of the first were wounded and taken Prisoners by the Enemy; among the dead was Major General Joseph Warren, a Man whose Memory will be endeared to his Countrymen and to the worthy in every Part and Age of the World, so long as Virtue and Valour shall be esteemed among Mankind; the heroic Coll. Gardner of Cambridge has since died of his Wounds; the brave Lieut. Coll. Parker of Chelmsford who was wounded and taken Prisoner perished in Boston Goal; these three with Major Moore and Major Mcclay who nobly struggled in the Cause of their Country, were the only Officers of Distinction whom we lost; some of great Worth, tho’ inferior in Rank were killed, whom we deeply lament; but the Officers and Soldiers in general who were wounded are almost all upon the Recovery.  
  
The Town of Charlestown, the Buildings of which were in general large and elegant, and which contained Effects belonging to the unhappy Sufferers in Boston, to a very great Amount, was entirely destroyed, and its Chimnies and Cellars now present a Prospect to the Americans exciting in their Bosoms an Indignation which nothing can appease but the Sacrifice of those Miscreants who have introduced Horror, Desolation and Havock into the happy Abodes of Peace and Liberty.  
Tho’ the Officers and Soldiers of the Ministerial Army meanly exult in having gained this Ground, yet they cannot but attest to the Bravery of our Troops, and acknowledge that the Battles of Fontenoy and Minden according to the Number engaged and the Time the Engagement continued were not to be compared with this; and indeed the Laurels of Minden were totally blasted in the Battle of Charlestown.  
The Ground, purchased thus dearly, by the British Troops, affords them no Advantage against the American Army now strongly entrenched on a neighbouring Eminence.  
The Continental Troops, nobly animated by the Justice of their Cause, strongly urge to decide the Contest by the Sword, but we wish for no further Effusion of Blood if the Freedom and Peace of America can be secured without it; but if it must be otherwise, we are determined to struggle and disdain Life without Liberty.  
Oh Britons! be wise for yourselves before it is too late, and secure a commercial Intercourse with the American Colonies before it is forever lost; disarm your ministerial Assassins, put an End to this unrighteous and unnatural War, and suffer not any rapacious Despots to amuse you with the unprofitable Ideas of your Right to tax and officer the Colonies, ’till the most profitable and advantageous Trade of the Colonies is irrecoverably lost. Be wise for yourselves and the Americans will contribute to rejoice in your Prosperity.

N obedience to the order of the  
congrets, this committee have en-  
quired into the premifes, and upon  
the belt information obtained, find,  
that the commanders of the New  
England army had, about the 14th ult.  
received advice that general Gaye had  
ified orders for a party of the croops  
under his command, to polt themfelves  
on Bunker&#x27;s Hill, a promontory juft  
at the entrance of the peninfula at  
Charleflown, which orders were  
foon to be executed ; upon which it  
was determined, with the advice of  
this committee, to fend a party who  
might erett fome fortifications upon  
the faid hill, and defeat this defign of  
our enemies, Accordingly on the 16th  
ult. orders were iffued, that a detach  
ment of 1000 men fhould that even-  
ing march to Charleflown, and en-  
trench upon thathill. Juft before nine  
o&#x27;clock they left Cambridge, and pro-  
ceeded to Breed’s Hill fituated on  
the farther part of the peninfula next  
to Botton, (for by fome miftake this  
hill was marked out for the entrench-  
ment inflead of the other.) Many things  
being necellary to be done prepara-  
tory to the entrenchments being thrown  
up, which could not be done before  
left the enemy thould difcover an  
defeat the defign, it was nearly twelve  
o&#x27;clock before the works were enter-  
ed upon. They were then carried on  
with the utmoft diligence and alacrity ;  
fo that by the dawn of the day they  
had thrown up a {mall redoubr, about  
eight rods fquare. At this time a  
heavy fire began from the enemy&#x27;s  
fhips, a number of floating batteries,  
and from a fortufication of the ene-  
my&#x27;s, upon Cops Hill in Bolton, di-  
rectly oppofite to our little redoubt.  
An inceflant fhower of thot and  
bombs was rained by thele upon our  
works, The provincials continued  
to labour indefatigably ll they had  
thrown up a {mall brealt-work, ex-  
tending from the ecalt fide of the  
redoubt to the bottom of the hill,  
but were prevented completing it  
by the intolerable fire of the enemy.  
Between twelve and one o&#x27;clock,

firuated a little to the ecathward of  
our works, Thrs beyade formed  
upon their land ng, and flood thus  
formed ril*a fecond detachment ar-  
rived from Boflon to join them ;  
having fent out large flank guards,  
they began a very flow march to.

fmoke and ftlaines were {een  
rife from the town of Charl wh,  
which had been fet on tire by the  
enemy, that the fmoke meght cover  
their atrack upon our lines, and per-~  
haps with a detign to rout or detlroy  
one or two regiments of provincial  
who had been potted in that town,  
If either of thefe was their defign,  
they were difappointed, for the wind  
fhifting on a fudden, carried the  
fmoke another way, and the repi-  
ments were already removed, The  
provincials within their entrench-  
ments impatiently waited the ariack  
of the enemy, and referved their five  
till they came within ren or twelve  
rods, and then began a furions d  
  
charge of {mall arms. This fire ar-  
refled the enemy, which they for  
fome time returned, without advanc-  
ing aftep, and then retreated in difvr-  
der and with great precipitation tw  
the place of landing, and fome of  
them fought refuge even within their  
boats. Here the officers were ob -  
ferved by the fpeftators on the op-  
polire fhore, to run down to then,  
uling the moft pafhonate geftures,  
and pufhing the men forward with  
therr fwords. Art length they were  
rallied, and marched up with appa-  
rent reluttance towards the enrren }-  
ment : the Americans again reler “df

The fire from the {hips and batteries,  
  
as well as from the cannon in the front  
  
of their army, was redoubled, The  
  
officers in the rear of their army,  
  
were obferved to goad forward the  
  
men with renewed exertions, and they  
attacked the redoubt on three fides at  
  
once. ‘The brteall-work on the out-  
fide of the fort was abandoned; the  
ammuniuon of the provincials was ex-  
pended, and few of their arms were  
fixed with bayonets. Can it then be  
wondered that the word was given by  
the commander of the party to retreat ?  
But this he delayed till the redoubt  
was half filled with regulars, and the  
provinctals had kept the enemy at bay  
jome time, confronting them with the  
but ends of their at The re-  
treat of this little handful of brave  
mien would Have been effectually cut  
off, had it not Happened that the flank-  
ing party of the enemy, which was to  
have come upon the back of the re-  
doubt, was checked by a party of the  
provincials who fought with the utmolt  
bravery, and kept them from advanc-  
ing farther than the beach; the en-  
gagement of tlicfe two parties was kept  
up with the utmofi vigour ; and it mull  
be ackriowledgzed that this party of  
the minifterial troops evidenced a cou-  
rage worthy of a better cauife ; all their  
eiforts, however, were infufficient to  
compel the provincials to retreat till  
their main body had left the hill; per-  
ceiving this was done, they then gave  
ground, but with more regularity than  
could be expected of troops who had  
been no longer under difcipline, and  
many of whom never before faw an  
engagement.  
  
In this retreat, the Americans had  
to pafs over the neck which joins the  
peninfula of Charleflown to the  
main land. This neck was command-  
ed by the Glafgow man of war, and  
two floating batteries, placed in fuch  
a manner, that their {hot raked every  
part of it. The inceffant fire kept up  
acrofs this neck had, from the begin-  
ning of the engayement, prevetted  
any confiderable reinforcements from  
getting to the provincials on the hill,  
and it was feared it would cut off their  
retreat, but they retired over it with  
little or no lofs.  
  
With a ridiculous parade of tri-  
umph, the minillerial genera&#x27;s again  
took polfefhion of the hill which had

ferved them as a retreat in flight from  
the battle or Concord, It was ex-  
pected that they would profecute the  
{uppofed advantage they had gained  
by marching tmmediately to Cam-  
bridge, which was diffant but two  
niles, and which was notthenina flate

men who marched out upon this ex-

of which were commithoned ofhcers)  
were killed or wounded ; and about  
1200 of them of e:ther kil&#x27;ed or mor.  
tally wounded. Such a flaughter was  
pethaps never betore made upon Bn-  
th troops in the {pace of about ai  
hour, during which the heat of the  
engagement lalled, by about 1500 men,  
which were the molt that were any  
time engaged on the American fide,  
  
The fot of the New-England army  
amounted, according to an exact re-  
turn, to 145 killed and mifling, and  
go4 wounded ; thirty of the firit weré  
wounded and taken prifoners by the  
enemy. Aniong the dead Was major

memory will be endeated to his coun-  
trymien, and to the worthy in every  
part and age of the world, fo long as

died of his wounds; and the brave

foner, perifhed in Boflon jail. Thefe

situation, they least expected the Americans would look them in  
the face.  
  
The alarm being immediately given, orders were issued that  
a continual fire should be kept playing upon the unfinished works,  
from the ships, the floating batteries in the river, and Copp’s Hill,  
a fortified post of the British in Boston, directly opposite the  
American redoubt; but, with extraordinary perseverance, the Ame-  
ricans continued to strengthen their works, not returning a shot  
till noon, when a number of boats and barges, filled with regular  
troops from Boston approached Charlestown. ‘The day was ex-

the rail fences, but others were altogether exposed, so that their  
bravery in close combat was put to the test, independent of de-

that the commandersof the New England army had, about the 14th ult.,  
received advice that general Gage had issued orders for a party of the  
troops under his command to post themselves on Bunker’s Hill, a pro-  
montory just at the entrance of the peninsula at Charlestown, which or-  
ders were soon to be executed; upon which it was determined, with the  
advice of this committee, to send a party, who might erect some fortifi-  
cations upon the said hill, and defeat the design of our enemies. Ac-  
cordingly, on the 16th ult., orders were issued that a detachment of one  
thousand men should that evening march to Charlestown, and intrench  
upon that hill. Just before nine o’clock they left Cambridge, and pro-  
ceeded to Breed’s Hill, situated on the further part of the peninsula,  
next to Boston, (for by some mistake this hill was marked out for the  
intrenchment instead of the other). Many things being necessary to be  
done preparatory to the intrenchments being thrown up, which could  
not be done before, lest the enemy should discover and defeat the de-  
sign, it was nearly twelve o’clock before the works were entered upon.  
They were then carried on with the utmost diligence and alacrity; so  
that by the dawn of day they had thrown up a small redoubt about eight  
rods square. At this time a heavy fire began from the enemy’s ships,  
a number of floating batteries, and froma fortification of the enemy’s  
upon Copp’s Hill, in Boston, directly opposite our little redoubt. An  
incessant shower of shot and bombs was rained by these upon our  
works. The Americans continued to labour indefatigably till they had  
thrown up a small breast-work, extending from the east side of the re-  
doubt to the bottom of the hill, but were prevented completing it by the  
intolerable fire of the enemy.  
  
Between twelve and one o’clock a number of boats and barges, filled  
with the regular troops from Boston, were observed approaching to-  
wards Charlestown; these troops landed at a place called Moreton’s  
Point, situated a little tothe eastward of our works. This brigade form-  
ed upon their landing, and stood thus formed till a second detachment  
arrived from Boston to join them; having sent out large flank guards,  
they began a very slow march towards our lines. At this instant, smoke  
and flames were seen to arise from the town of Charlestown, which had  
been set on fire by the enemy, that the smoke might cover their attack  
upon our lines, and perhaps with a design to rout or destroy one or two of  
our regiments who had been posted in that town. Ifeither of these was  
their design, they were disappointed; for the wind shifting on a sudden,  
carried the smoke another way, and the regiments were already re-  
moved. Our troops, within their intrenchments, impatiently awaited  
the attack of the eriemy, and reserved their fire till they came within  
ten or twelve rods, and then began a furious discharge of small arms.  
This fire arrested the enemy, which they for soine time returned, with-  
out advancing a step, and then retreated in disorder and with great pre-  
cipitation to the place of landing, and some of them sought refuge even  
within their boats. Here the officers were observed by the spectators on  
the opposite shore, to run down to them, using the most passionate ges-  
tures, and pushing the men forward with their swords. Atdength they  
were rallied, and marched up, with apparent reluctance, towards the  
intrenchments; the Americans again reserved their fire until the ene-  
my came within five or six rods, and a second time put the regulars to  
flight, who ran in great confusion towards their boats. Similar and su-  
perior exertions were now necessarily made by the officers, which, not-  
withstanding the men discovered an almost insuperable reluctance to  
jighting in thie cause, were again successful. They formed once

more, and having brought some cannon to bear in. such a manner as to  
rake the inside of the breast-work from one end of it to the other, our  
troops retreated within their little fort. The ministerial army now madc  
a decisive effort. The fire from the ships and batteries, as well as from  
the cannon in the front of their army, was redoubled. The officers in  
the rear of their army were observed to goad forward the men with re-  
newed exertions, and they attacked the redoubt on three sides at once.  
The breast-work on the outside of the fort was abandoned; our ammu-  
nition was expended, and but few of our troops had bayonets to affix to  
their muskets. Can it then be wondered that the word was given by the  
commander of the party to retreat? but. this. he delayed till the redoubt  
was half filled with regulars, and our troops had kept the enemy at bay  
some time, confronting them with the butt end of their muskets. The  
retreat of this little handful of brave men would have been effectually  
cut off, had it not happened that the flanking party of the enemy, which  
was to have come upon the back of the redoubt, was checked by a par-  
ty of our men, who fought with the utmost bravery, and kept them from  
advancing farther than the beach; the engagement of these two parties  
was kept up withthe utmost vigour; and it must be acknowledged that  
this party of the ministerial troops evinced a courage worthy of a better  
cause: all their efforts however were insufficient to compel their equally  
gallant opponents to retreat, till their main body had left the hill; per-  
ceiving this was done, they then gave ground, but with more regularity  
than could be expected of troeps who had no longer been under disci-  
pline, and many of whom never before saw an engagement.  
  
In this retreat the Americans had to pass over the neck which joins  
the peninsula of Charlestown to the main land. This neck was com-  
manded by the Glasgow man of war, and two floating batteries, placed  
in such a manner as that their shot raked every part of it. The incessant  
fire kept up across this neck had, from the beginniug of the engage-  
ment, prevented any censiderable reinforcements from getting to our  
troops on the hill, and it was feared it would cut off their retreat, but  
they retired over it with little or no loss.  
  
With a ridiculous parade of triumph, the ministerial generals again  
took possession of the hill which had served them as a retreat in flight  
from the battle of Concord, It was expected that they wouid prosecute  
the supposed advantage they had gained, by marching immediately to  
Cambridge, which was distant but two miles, and which was not then in  
a state of defence. This they failed to do. The wonder excited by such  
conduct soon ceased, when, by the best accounts from Boston, we are  
told, that of 3000 men who marched out upon this expedition, no less  
than 1500 (ninety-two of whom were commissioned officers) were killed  
er wounded; and about 1200 of them either killed or mortally wounded.  
Such a slaughter was perhapsnever before made upon British troops in  
the space of about an hour, during which the heat of the engagement  
lasted, by about 1500 men, which were the most that were at any time  
engaged on the American side.  
  
The loss of the New England army amounted, according to an exact  
return, to 145 killed and missing, and 304 wounded: thirty of the first  
were wounded and taken prisoners by the enemy. Among the dead was  
major general JosepH WaRREN, a man whose memory will be endeared  
to his countrymen,and to the worthy in every part and age of the world,  
so long as virtue and valour shall be esteemed among mankind. The he-  
roic colonel Gardner, of Cambridge, has since died of his wounds; and  
\e brave lieutenant colonel Parker, of Chelmsford, who was wounded

Moore, and major M‘Clary,* who nobly struggled in the cause of their  
country, were the only officers of distinction which we lost. Some offi-  
cers of great worth, though inferior in rank, were killed, whom we deep-  
ly lament. But the officers and soldiers in general, who were wounded,  
are in a fair way of recovery. The town of Charlestown, the buildings of  
which were large and elegant, and which contained effects belonging to  
the unhappy sufferers in Boston, to a very great amount, was entirely  
destroyed, and its chimnies and cellars now present a prospect to the  
Americans, exciting an indignation in their bosoms, which nothing can  
appease but the sacrifice of those miscreants who have introduced hor-  
ror, desolation, and havoc into these once happy abodes of liberty, peace,

In. obedience to the order of the Congress, this  
committee have enquired into the premises, and  
upon the best information obtained, find, that the  
commanders of the New England army had about  
the 1 -It&#x27;iult.. received advice that Gen. Gage had  
issued ohlers for a parfy of the troops under his  
command to post themselves on Bunkers Hill, a  
pro n nlofy just at the entrance of the peninsula  
at C i ndestown, which orders were soon to be  
eyehole 1 ..upon which it was determined, with  
the idvL-e of this committee, to semi a party who  
tji^jHit erect some fortification upon the said hill,  
an t defeat this design nfottr enemies Accor-  
dingly on the 16tfi ult orders were issued, that a  
(feta&#x27; hoi ant of 1,000 men should that evening  
m ireh tv. Charlestown, and entrcar.lt upon that  
Hill. Jhst before 9oYIock, they left Cambridge  
and proceeded to Breed’s Hill, situated on the  
farther p i t of the peninsula, next to Boston; for,  
by some mistake, this hill was marked out for the  
entrenchment instead of the other. Many things  
being nbcess tVy to he done prep iratory to the en-  
trenchments being thrown up, which could riot  
be done before, least the enemy should discover  
and defeat the design, it was nearly nvelveo’clock  
before the work was entered upon. They were!  
then carried on with the utmost rfilligcnce and i  
idacritv, so that by the dawn of the. Jn v, they had i  
thrown up a small redoubt, about eight rods!  
square. At this time a heavy lire began from I  
the eneS|y , s T siiips a number of do.it ing batteries,  
from h forticatiod.of the enemy&#x27;s upon Copp’s  
  
ililj.in Boston, directly opposite to our little re.  
d &gt;u it. Ai in :e-- lit shower of shot and bombs,  
was rained by these upon our works. The pro-  
’VHiciab conliudqtl to labor indefatigably till they  
had thrown up a small breastwork extending from  
the east side of the redoubt h&gt; the bottom ol the  
hjll.lfutiiwqre prevented from completeing it by  
the intolerable fire of the enemy.  
  
Between twelve and oiie o’clock a number of  
boats and barges, filled with the regular troops  
from Boston, were observed approaching towards  
Charlestown. Tnese troops landed at a place |j  
r died Morton&#x27;s’ point, situated a little to the  
ei - 1 Ward of our works. This brigade formed,  
upon their landing - , and stood thus formed till a;  
seco-.d detachment arrived from Boston to join  
them. Having sent out large flank guards, they  
began a very slow march ton a’ - •• jr lines At j  
this instant, saaojte a llame- were seen io arise |  
from the town oljGharlestown, &#x27;which liad been

oyer their attack upou our lines, and perhaps |  
yifh i i sign to&#x27; rout or destroy one or two regi-,  
Ventsof Provincials who had iieeu posted in that  
twn. 11&#x27; either of these was their design, they  
vfcie disappointed ; for the wind shifted on asud-  
4,, carried the smoke another way, and the  
rgiments were already removed. The Provin-  
c Is, within them entrenchments, impatiently

ral&#x27;ie I, aj marched up witli ap parent reluctance |  
towards entrenchment. The Americans  
again resei&#x27;ea their fire until the enemy came  
w ithin lived- six rods, and n second time put the  
regulars to light, who ran in great confusion  
towards &#x27;hat. boats. Similar and superior exer-  
tio.-s were no necessarily made by the officers

from the ship* and utteries, as well as from the

In this refreat, the Americans had to pass over

In obedience to the order of the Con-  
gress, this committee have inquired into  
the premises, and upon the best informa-  
tion obtained, find that the Commanders  
of the New-England army dad, about the  
14th ult. received advice chat Gen. Gage  
had issued orders for a party of the trooys  
under his command to post themselves on  
Bunker’s Hiil, a promontory just at the  
entrance of the Peninsula at Charlestown,  
which orders were soon to be executed ;  
upon which it was determined, with the  
advice of this committee, to send a party,  
who might erect some fortifications upon  
the said hill, and defeat this design of our  
enemies. Accordingly on the 16th ult.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
100 men should that evening march to  
Charlestown, and entrench upon that hill.  
Just before 9 o’clock they left Cambridge,  
and proceeded to Breed’s Hill, situated  
on the further part of the Peninsula next  
to Boston, (for by some mistake this Hill  
was marked out for the entrenchment in-  
stead of the other) many things being ne-  
cessary to be done preparatory to the en-  
trenchment’s being thrown up, which  
could not be done before, lest the enemy  
should discover and defeat the design, it

was nearly twelve o’clock before the  
They were  
then carried on with the utmost diligence  
and alacrity ; so that by the dawn of the  
day they had thrown up a small redoubt,  
about eight rods square. At this timea  
heavy fire began from the enemy’s ships,  
a number of floating batteries, and from a  
| fortification of the enemy’s upon Copp‘s  
_Hillin Boston, directly opposite to our  
| little redoubt.  
shot and bombs was rained by these upon  
| our works. The Provincials continued to  
  
labour indefatigably till they bad thrown  
  
up asmall breast work, extending from  
| the east side of the redoubt to the bottom  
| of the Hill, but were prevented complet-  
ing it by the intolerable fire of the enemy.  
  
Between twelve and one o’clock a  
number of boats and barges, filled with  
| the regular troops from Boston, were ob-  
served approaching towards Charles-  
| town; these troops landed at a place call.  
ed’ Moreton’s Point, situated a little to the  
| eastward of our works. The brigade  
| formed upon their landing, and stood thus  
| formed till asecond detachment arrived  
&#x27; from Boston to join them ; having sent  
| our large flank guards, they began a very  
slow march towards our lines. At this in-  
stant, smoke and flames were seen to  
arise from the town of Charlestown,  
| which had been set on fire by the enemy,  
that the smoke might cover their attack  
upon our jines, and perhaps witha de-  
sign to rout or destroy one or two regi-  
ments of Provincials who had been post-  
edinthat town. If either of these was  
their design, they were disappointed, for  
the wind shifting on a sudden, carried the  
smuke another way, and the regiments  
were already removed. The Provincials  
within their entrenchments impatiently  
waited the attack of the enemy, and re-  
served their fire till they came within 10  
or 12 rods, and then began a furious dis-  
charge of small arms. This fire arrested  
the enemy, which they for some time re-  
turned, without advancing a step, and  
then retreated in disorder and with great  
precipitation to the place of landing, and  
some of them sought refuge even within  
their boats. Here the officers were ob-  
served by the spectators on the opposite

shore, to run down to them, vsing the  
most passionate gestures, and pushing the  
men forward with their swords. Atlength  
they were rallied, and marched up with  
apparent reluctance towards the entrench- ,  
ment ; the Americans again reserved  
their fire until the enemy came within  
five or six rods, and a second time put the  
Regulars to flight, who ran in great con-  
fusion towards their boats. Similar and  
superior exertions were now necessarily  
made by the officers, which, notwithstand-  
ing the men discovered an almost insu-  
perable reluctance to fighting in this cause.  
were again successful. ‘They formed  
once more, and having brought some can-  
non to bear in such a manner as to rake  
the inside of the breast work from one  
end of it to the other, the Provincials re-  
treated within their little fort. The mio-  
isterial army now made a decisive effort  
The fire from the ships and batteries, as  
well as from the cannon in the front of  
their army, was redoubled. The officers  
in the rear of their army, were observed  
to goad forward the men with renewed  
  
  
  
  
  
On the outside of the fort was abandoned;  
the ammunition of the Provincials was  
expended, and few of their arms were fix-  
ed with bayonets. Can it then be won-  
dered that the word was given by the  
commander of the party to retreat ? But  
this he delayed till the redoubt was half  
filled with Regulars, and the Provincials  
had kept the enemy at bay some time,  
confronting them with the butt ends of  
their muskets. The retreat of this little  
handfal of brave men would have been  
effectually cut off, had it not happened that  
the flanking party of the enemy which  
was to have come upon the back of the  
redoubt, was checked by a party of the  
Provincials, who fought with the utmost  
bravery, and kept them from advancing  
farther than the Beach ; the engage-  
meat of these two parties was kept-up  
with the utmost vigour; and it must be  
acknowledged that this party of the mia-  
isterial troops evidenced a courage wor-  
thy a better cause ; all their efforts, how-  
ever, were insufficient to compel the Pro-  
vincials to retreat till their main body bad  
left the dill; perceiving this was done,  
they then gave ground, but with more  
regularity than could be expected of  
troops who had no longer been under dis-  
cipline, and many of whom never before  
Saw a0 engagement.  
  
In this reireat, the Americans had to

gow man of war, andtwo floating batte-  
| ries, placed in such a manner,as that their  
| shot raked every part of it. The inces-  
| sant fire kept up across this Neck, had,  
from the beginuing of the engagement,  
prevented any considerable reinforce-  
ments from getting to the Provincials on  
the Hill, and it was feared it would  
| cut off their retreat, but they retired over  
, it with little or no loss.  
| With aridiculous parade of triumph,  
| the ministerial Generals again took pos-  
session of the Hill which had served them  
as aretreatin flight from the-battle of  
Concord. It was expected that they  
_ would prosecate the supposed advantage  
they had gained by marching immediate-  
ly to Cambridge, which was distant but  
&#x27; two miles, and which was not then in a  
state of defence. This they failed to do.  
| The wonder excited by such conduct soon  
ceased, when by the best accounts from  
| Boston we are told, that of 3000 men who  
| marched oat upon this expedition, no lesa  
| than 1500 (92 of which were commission-  
, ed officers) were killed or wounded ; and  
about 1200 of them either kiiled or mor-  
tally wounded. Such a slaughter was  
perhaps never before made upon British  
troops in the space of about an hour, dur-  
ing which the heat of the engagement  
lasted, by aboat 1500 men, which were  
the most that were at apy time engaged  
on the Awerican side.  
  
The loss of the New-England army  
amounted according toan exact return, to  
145 killed and missing, and 304 wounded ;  
$0 of the first were wounded and taken  
prisoners by the enemy. Among the dead  
was Major General Joseph Warren, a  
man whose memory will be endeared to  
his countrymen, and to the worthy in  
every part and age of the world, so long  
as virtue and valor shall be esteemed  
among mankind. The heroic Col. Garn-  
nER of Cambridge, has sioce died of his  
wounds ; and the brave Lieut. Col Par-  
KER of Chelmsford, who was wounded and  
taken prisoner, perished in Boston gaol.  
These three, with Major Moore and Ma-  
jor M’Creany, who nobly struggled in the  
cause of their country, were the only  
officers of distinction which we lost. Some  
officers of great worth, though inferior in  
rank, were killed, whom we deeply la-  
ment. But the officers and soldiers in gen-  
eral, who were wounded are in a fair way  
of recovery The town of Charlestown,  
the buildings of which were in general  
large and elegant, and which contained  
effects belonging to the unhapoy sufferers  
in Boston toa very great amount, was

In Committee or Sarety, July 25, 1775,  
  
In obedience to the above order of Congress, this  
committee have inquired into the premises, and upon  
the best information obtained, find that the com.  
manders of the New England army had, about the  
14th ult., received advice that General Gage had  
issued orders for a party of the troops under his com-  
mand to post themselves on Bunker’s Hill, a pro-  
montory just at the entrance of the peninsula of  
Charlestown, which orders were soon to be executed:  
Upon which it was determined, with the advice of  
this committee, to send a party, who might erect  
some fortitications upon said hill, and defeat this  
design of our enemies. Accordingly, on the 16th  
ult., orders were issued that a detachment of one  
thousand men should that evening march te Charles.  
town, and intrench upon that hill, Just before nino  
o’clock they left Cambridge, and proceeded to Breed’s  
Hill, situated on the farther part of the peninsula  
next to Boston; for, by some mistake, this hill was  
marked out for the intrenchment instead of the other,  
Many things being necessary to be done preparatory  
to the intrenchments being thrown up, (which could  
not be done before, lest the enemy should discover  
and defeat the design,) it was nearly twelve o’clock  
before the works Were entered upon; they were then  
carried on with the utmost diligence and alacrity, so  
that by the dawn of the day they had thrown up a  
small redoubt, about eight rods square. At this time  
a heavy fire began from the enemy’s ships, a number  
of floating batteries, and from a fortification of the  
enemy’s upon Copp’s Hill in Boston, directly oppo.  
site to our little redoubt. An incessant shower of  
shot and bombs was rained by these upon our works,  
by whiclronly one man fell; the Provincials contin-  
ued to labor indefatigably till they had thrown up a  
small breastwork, extending from the east side of the  
redoubt to the bottom of the hill, but were prevented

Betwoen twelve and one o’clock a number of boats  
and barges, filled with the regular troops from Bos  
ton, were observed approaching towards Charles.  
town. These troops landed at a place called More-  
ton’s Point, situated a little to the eastward of our  
works. This brigade formed upon their landing, and  
stood thus formed till a second detachment arrived  
from Boston to join them. Having sent out large  
flank guards, they began a very slow march towards  
our lines. At this instant smoke and flames where  
seen to arise from the town of Charlestown, which  
had been set on fire by the enemy, that the smoke  
  
with a design to rout or destroy one or two regiments  
of Provincials who had been posted in that town. If  
either of these was-their design, they were disap.  
pointed, for the wind shifting on a sudden, carried  
the smoke another way, and the regiments were al-  
ready removed. The Provincials, within their in.  
trenchments, impatiently awaited the attack of the  
enemy, and reserved their fire till they came within  
ten or twelve rods, and then began a furious discharge  
of small arms. ‘This fire arrested the enemy, which  
  
  
  
the utmost bravery, and kept them from advancing  
farther than the beach. The engagement of these  
two parties was kept up with the utmost vigor; and  
it must be acknowledged that this party of the Min-  
isterial troops evidenced a courage worthy of a bet-  
ter cause, All their efforts, however, were insuffi-  
cient to compel the Provincials to retreat, till their  
main body had left the hill. Perceiving this was  
done, they then gave ground, but with more regu-  
larity than could be expected of troops who had no  
longer been under discipline, and many of whom  
never befure saw an engagement. e  
  
In this retreat the Americans had to pass over the  
neck, which joins the peninsula of Charlestown to  
the main land. This neck was commanded by the  
Glasgow man-.of-war and two floating batteries,  
placed in such a manner as that their shot raked  
every part of it. The incessant fire kept up across  
this neck, had, from the beginning of the engage-  
ment, prevented any considerable reinforcement from  
getting to the Provincials upon the hill, and it was  
feared would cut off their retreat, but they retired

intrenchment. The Americans again reserved their  
fire until the enemy came up within five or six rods,  
and a second time put the regulars to flight, who ran  
in great confusion towards their boats. Similar and  
superior exertions were now necessarily made by the  
officers, which, notwithstanding the men discovered  
an almost insuperable reluctance to fighting in this  
cause, were again successful. They formed once  
more, and having brought some cannon to bear in  
such a manner as to rake the inside of the breast  
work from one end of it to the other, the Provincials  
retreated within their little fort. The Ministerial  
army now made a decisive effort ; the fire from the  
ships and batteries, as well as from the cannon in  
the front of their army, was redoubled. The officers  
in the rear of their army were observed to goad for-  
ward the men with renewed exertions, and they at-  
tacked the redoubt on three sides at once. The  
breastwork on the outside of the fort was abandoned;  
the ammunition of the Provincials was expended,  
and few of their arms were fixed with bayonets.  
Can it then be wondered that the word was given by  
the commander of the party, to retreat? But this he  
delayed till the redoubt was half filled with regulars,  
and the Provincials had kept the enemy at bay some  
time, confronting them with the but-end of their  
muskets.  
  
The retreat of this little handfol of btave men  
would have been effectually cut off, had it not hap-  
pened that the flanking party of the enemy, which  
was to have come up on the back of the redoubt, was  
checked by a party of Provincials, who fought with

rt In the Massachusetts Committee of Safety’s account  
of the battle is the following passage : ‘ Though the officers  
and soldiers of the ministerial army meanly exult in hav­  
ing gained this ground, yet they cannot but attest to the  
bravery of our troops, ami acknowledge that the battles of  
Fontenoy and Minden, according to ihe numbers engaged  
and the time the engagement continued, were not to be  
compared with this; and totally blasted in the battle of  
Charlestown were the laurels of Minden. The ground  
purchased thus dearly by the British troops affords them  
no advantage against the American army, now strongly  
entrenched on a neighboring eminence.” In later times,  
among the actions that resembled in some particulars the  
fight we are describing, was that of the bridge of Arcola,  
when General Bonaparte, having seized a flag, rushed, at  
the head of a column, to a spot within two hundred paces  
of the bridge, where he was repulsed by a murderous fire.

some fortifications upon said hill, and defeat this  
design of our enemies. Accordingly, on the  
16th ult., orders were issued that a detachment  
of one thousand men should that evening march  
to Charlestown, and intrench upon that hill.  
Just before nine o’clock they left Cambridge,  
and proceeded to Breed’s Hill, situated on the  
farther part of the peninsula, next to Boston ;  
for, by some mistake, this hill was marked out  
for the intrenchment instead of the other. Many  
things being necessary to be done preparatory  
  
to the intrenchments being thrown up (which |  
  
could not be done before, lest the enemy should  
discover and defeat the design,) it was nearly  
twelve o’clock before the works were entered  
upon; they were then carried on with the ut-  
most diligence and alacrity, so that by the dawn  
of the day they had thrown up a small redoubt,  
about eight rods square. At this time a heavy  
fire began from the enemy’s ships, a number of  
floating batteries, and from a fortification of the  
enemy’s upon Copp’s Hill, in Boston, directly  
opposite to our little redoubt. An incessant  
  
shower of shot and bombs was rained by these |  
  
upon our works, by which only one man fell ;  
the Provincials continued to labour indefatigably  
till they had thrown up a small breastwork, ex-  
tending from the east side of the redoubt to the  
bottom of the hill, but were prevented complet-  
ing it by the intolerable fire of the enemy.  
Between twelve and one o’clock a number of  
boats and barges, filled with the Regular Troops  
from Boston, were observed approaching to-  
wards Charlestown. These troops landed at a  
place called Moreton’s Point, situated a little to  
the eastward of our works. This Brigade formed  
upon their landing, and stood thus formed till a  
second detachment arrived from Boston to join  
them. Having sent out large flank guards, they |  
began a very slow march towards our lines. At  
this instant, smoke and flames were seen to arise  
from the Town of Charlestown, which had been  
set on fire by the enemy, that the smoke might  
cover their attack upon our lines, and perhaps  
with a design to rout or destroy one or two  
Regiments of Provincials who had been posted in  
that Town. If either of these was their design,  
they were disappointed, for the wind shifting on  
a sudden, carried the smoke another way, and  
the Regiments were already removed. The Pro-  
vincials, within their intrenchments, impatiently |  
awaited the attack of the enemy, and reserved  
their fire till they came within ten or twelve |  
rods, and then began a furious discharge of  
small-arms. This fire arrested the enemy,  
which they for some time returned, without |  
advancing a step, and then retreated in disor-  
  
  
  
der, and with great precipitation, to the place of  
landing ; and some of them sought refuge even  
within their boats. Here the officers were ob-  
  
served by the spectators on the opposite shore,  
to run down to them, using the most passionate  
gestures, and pushing the men forward with  
their swords. At length they were rallied, and  
marched up with apparent reluctance towards  
the intrenchment. The Americans again re-  
served their fire until the enemy came up within  
five or six rods, and a second time put the Regu-  
lars to flight, who ran in great confusion to-  
wards their boats. Similar and superiour exer-  
tions were now necessarily made by the officers,  
which, notwithstanding the men discovered an  
almost insuperable reluctance to fighting in this  
cause, were again successful. They formed once  
more, and having brought some cannon to bear  
in such a manner as to rake the inside of the  
breastwork from one end of it to the other, the  
Provincials retreated within their little fort.  
The Ministerial Army now made a decisive ef-  
fort; the fire from the ships and batteries, as  
well as from the cannon in the front of their  
Army, was redoubled. The officers in the rear  
of their Army were observed to goad forward the  
men with renewed exertions; and they attacked  
the redoubt on three sides at once. The breast-  
work, on the outside of the fort, was abandoned;  
the ammunition of the Provincials was expended ;  
and few of their arms were fixed with bayo-  
nets. Can it then be wondered that the word  
was given by the commander of the party, to re-  
treat? But this he delayed till the redoubt was  
half filled with Regulars, and the Provincials had  
kept the enemy at bay some time, confronting  
them with the but-end of their muskets.  
  
The retreat of this little handful of brave men  
would have been effectually cut off, had it not  
happened that the flanking party of the enemy,  
which was to have come up on the back of the  
redoubt, was checked by a party of Provincials,  
who fought with the utmost bravery, and kept  
them from advancing farther than the beach.  
The engagement of these two parties was kept  
up with the utmost vigour; and it must be ac-  
knowledged that this party of the Ministerial  
Troops evidenced a courage worthy of a better  
cause. All their efforts, however, were insuf-  
ficient to compel the Provincials to retreat, till  
their main body had left the hill. Perceiving  
this was done, they then gave ground, but with  
more regularity than could be expected of troops  
who had no longer been under discipline, and  
many of whom never before saw an engagement.  
  
In this retreat, the Americans had to pass over  
the neck, which joins the peninsula of Charlestown  
to the main-land. This neck was commanded  
by the Glasgow, man-of-war, and two floating  
batteries, placed in such a manner as that their  
shot raked every part of it. The incessant fire  
kept up across this neck, had, from the beginning  
of the engagement, prevented any considerable

no loss. okt  
  
With a ridiculous parade of triumph, the Min- |  
jsterial troops again took possession of the hill, |  
which had served them as a retreat in their |  
flight from the battle of Concord. It was ex- |  
  
cted that they would prosecute the supposed |  
advantage they had gained, by marching imme- |  
diately to Cambridge, which was distant about |  
two miles, and which was not then in a state of  
defence. This they failed to do. The wonder  
excited by such conduct soon ceased, when, by  
the best accounts from Boston, we were told that  
of three thousand men who marched out upon  
this expedition, no less than fifteen hundred  
(ninety-two of whom were commissioned officers)  
were killed or wounded, and about twelve  
hundred of them either killed or mortally  
wounded. Such a slaughter was perhaps never  
before made upon British troops in the space of  
about an hour, during which the heat of the en-  
gagement lasted, by about fifteen hundred men,  
which were the most that were at any time en-  
gaged on the American side.  
  
The loss of the New-England Army amounted,  
according to an exact return, to one hundred  
and forty-five killed and missing, and three hun-  
dred and four wounded. Thirty of the first  
were wounded and taken prisoners by the enemy.  
Among the dead was Major General Joseph  
Warren, a man whose memory will be endeared  
to his countrymen, and to the worthy in every  
part and age of the world, so long as virtue and |  
valour shall be esteemed among mankind. The |  
heroick Colonel Gardner, of Cambridge, has since  
died of his wounds ; and the brave Lieutenant-  
Colonel Parker, of Chelmsford, who was wound- |  
ed and taken prisoner, perished in Boston jail. |  
These three, with Major Moore and Major Mc:- |  
Clary, who noble struggled in the cause of their |  
country, were the only officers of distinction which |  
we lost. Some officers of great worth, though in- |  
feriour in rank, were killed, whom we deeply la- |  
ment; but the officers and soldiers in general |  
who were wounded, are in a fair way of recovery. |  
  
The ‘Town of Charlestown, the buildings of |  
which were in general large and elegant, and |  
which contained effects belonging to the unhap-  
py sufferers in Boston to a very great amount,  
was entirely destroyed; and its chimneys and  
cellars now present a prospect to the Americans,  
exciting an indignation in their bosoms which  
nothing can appease but the sacrifice of those  
miscreants who have introduced desolation and  
havock into these once happy abodes of liberty,  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
peace, and plenty.  
  
| bers engaged, and the time the engagements con-  
tinued, were not to be compared with this; and,  
indeed, the laurels of Minden were totally blasted  
in the battle of Charlestown. The ground pur-  
chased, thus dearly purchased by the British  
Troops, affords them no advantage against the  
American Army, now strongly intrenched on a  
neighbouring eminence. The Continental Troops,  
nobly animated from the justice of their cause,  
sternly urge to decide the contest by the sword ;  
but we wish for no farther effusion of blood, if  
the freedom and peace of America can be secured  
without it. But if it must be otherwise, we are  
determined to struggle. We disdain life without  
liberty.  
  
Oh, Britons! Be wise for yourselves before  
it is too late, and secure a commercial inter-  
course with the American Colonies before it is  
forever lost; disarm your Ministerial assassins; put  
an end to this unrighteous and unnatural war ;  
and suffer not any rapacious despots to amuse  
you with the unprofitable ideas of your right to  
tax and officer the Colonies, till the most profitable  
and advantageous trade you have is irrevocably  
lost. Be wise for yourselves, and the Americans  
will contribute to and rejoice in your prosperity.
