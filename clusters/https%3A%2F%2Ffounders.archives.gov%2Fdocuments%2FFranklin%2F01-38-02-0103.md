Sir  
Passy. Sepr. 22d. 1782  
I return the Papers with some corrections. I did not find Coal mines under the Calcareous rock in Derbyshire. I only remarked that at the lowest Part of that rocky Mountain which was in sight, there were Oyster Shells mixed with the Stone; &amp; part of the high County of Derby being probably as much above the level of the Sea, as the Coal Mines of Whitehaven were below, it seemed a proof that there had been a great Bouleversement in the Surface of that Island some part of it having been depressed under the Sea, &amp; other Parts which had been under it being raised above it. Such Changes in the superficial Parts of the Globe seemed to me unlikely to happen if the Earth were solid to the Center. I therefore imagined that the internal parts might be a fluid more dense, &amp; of greater specific gravity than any of the Solids we are acquainted with; which therefore might swim in or upon that Fluid. Thus the surface of the Globe would be a Shell, capable of being broken &amp; disordered by the violent movements of the fluid on which it rested. And, as Air has been compressed by Art so as to be twice as dense as Water, in which case if such Air &amp; Water could be contained in a strong glass Vessel, the Air would be seen to take the lowest place &amp; the Water to float above &amp; upon it; &amp; as we know not yet the degree of Density to which Air may be compressed, &amp; M. Amontons calculated, that its Density encreasing as it approached the Center in the same proportion as above the Surface it would at the depth of [blank in MS] Leagues be heavier than Gold, possibly the Dense Fluid occupying the internal Parts of the Globe might be Air compressed. And as the force of Expansion in dense Air when heated is in proportion to its density; this central air might afford another Agent to move the Surface; as well as be of use in keeping alive the central fires:— Tho’ as you observe the sudden Rarefaction of Water coming into Contact with those fires, may be an Agent sufficiently strong for that purpose, when acting between the incumbent Earth &amp; the fluid on which it rests.  
If one might indulge Imagination in supposing how such a Globe was formed, I should conceive, that all the Elements in separate Particles being originally mixed in confusion &amp; occupying a great Space they would as soon as the Almighty Fiat ordained Gravity or the mutual Attraction of certain Parts, &amp; the mutual repulsion of other Parts to exist all move towards their common Center: That the Air being a fluid whose Parts repel each other, though drawn to the Common Center by their Gravity, would be densest towards the Center &amp; rarer as more remote; consequently all Matter lighter than the central Parts of that Air, &amp; immersed in it, would recede from the Center &amp; rise till they arrived at the region of the Air which was of the same specific Gravity with themselves, where they would rest; while other Matter, mixed with the lighter Air would descend &amp; the two meeting would form the Shell of the first Earth leaving the upper Atmosphere nearly clear. The original Movement of the Parts towards their common Center would form a Whirl there; which would continue in the turning of the new formed Globe upon its Axis &amp; the greatest Diameter of the Shell would be in its Equator. If by any Accident afterwards the Axis should be changed, the dense internal Fluid by altering its form must burst the Shell &amp; throw all its Substance into the confusion in which we find it. I will not trouble you at present with my fancies concerning the manner of forming the rest of our System. Superior Beings smile at our theories &amp; at our presumption in making them. I will just mention that your observation on the Ferruginous Nature of the Lava which is thrown out from the Depths of our Volcanoes gave me great pleasure. It has long been a supposition of mine that the Iron contained in the substance of the Globe has made it capable of becoming, as it is, a Great Magnet. That the Fluid of magnetism exists perhaps in all space; so that there is a Magnetical North &amp; South of the Universe as well as of this Globe, &amp; that if it were possible for a man to fly from Star to Star he might govern his course by the Compass. That it was by the Power of this general Magnetism this Globe became a particular Magnet. In soft or hot Iron the fluid of Magnetism is naturally diffused equally— When within the influence of a Magnet, it is drawn to one end of the Iron, made denser there &amp; rarer at the other. While the Iron continues soft &amp; hot it is only a temporary Magnet: If it cools or grows hard in that situation, it becomes a permanent one, the Magnetic fluid not easily resuming its Equilibrium. Perhaps it may be owing to the permanent Magnetism of this Globe, which it had not at first, that its Axis is at the present kept parallel to itself, &amp; not liable to the changes it formerly suffered, which occasioned the Rupture of its Shell, the submersion &amp; Emersions of its Lands &amp; the confusions of its Seasons. The present Polar &amp; equatorial Diameters differing from each other near ten Leagues. It is easy to conceive in case some Power should shift the Axis gradually, &amp; place it in the present Equator, &amp; make the New Equator pass through the present Poles, what a sinking of the Waters would happen in the present equatorial regions, &amp; what a rising in the present polar Regions; so that vast tracts would be discovered that now are under Water, &amp; others covered that now are dry, the Water rising &amp; sinking in the different Extreams near five Leagues. Such an operation as this, possibly, occasioned much of Europe, &amp; among the rest this Mountain of Passy on which I live, &amp; which is composed of Limestone Rock &amp; Seashells, to be abandoned by the Sea &amp; to change its antient Climate, which seems to have been a hot One. The Globe being now become a permanent Magnet we are perhaps safe from any future change of its Axis. But we are still subject to the Accidents on the Surface which are occasioned by a Wave in the internal ponderous Fluid; &amp; such a Wave is produced by the sudden violent Explosion you mention happening from the Junction of Water &amp; fire under the Earth, which not only lifts the incumbent Earth that is over the Explosion, but impressing with the same force the fluid under it, creates a Wave that may run a thousand Leagues, lifting &amp; thereby shaking successively all the countries under which it passes. I know not whether I have expressed myself so clearly, as not to get out of your Sight in these Reveries.— If they occasion any new enquiries &amp; produce a better Hypothesis they will not be quite useless. You see I have given a loose to the Imagination, but I approve much more your Method of philosophizing, which proceeds upon actual Observation, makes a collection of facts, &amp; concludes no farther than those facts will warrant. In my present circumstances, that mode of studying the Nature of the Globe is out of my Power &amp; therefore I have permitted myself to wander a little in the wilds of fancy. With great Esteem I have the honor to be Sir &amp;c,  
B Franklin  
  
PS. I have heard that Chemists can by their art decompose Stone &amp; Wood, extracting a considerable Quantity of Water from the one &amp; Air from the other. It seems natural to conclude from this that Water &amp; Air were ingredients in the original Composition. For Men cannot make new Matter of any kind. In the same manner may we not suppose, that when we consume Combustibles of all kinds, &amp; produce Heat or light, we do not create that Heat or light; we only decompose a Substance which received it originally as a part of its composition? Heat may thus be considered as originally in a fluid State but attracted by organized Bodies in their growth, becomes a part of the Solid. Besides this, I can conceive that in the first Assemblage of the Particles of which this Earth is composed, each brought its Portion of the loose heat that had been connected with it, &amp; the whole when pressed together produced the Internal fire which still subsists.

Passy, September 22, 1782.  
SIR,  
  
RETURN the papers with fome corrections. I did not find  
coal mines under the calcareotfs rock in Derbyfhire. | only re-  
marked, that at the loweft part of that rocky mountain, which was  
in fight, there were oyfter fhells mixed with the flone ; and part of  
the high county of Derby being probably as much above the level of  
the fea, as the coal mines of Whitehaven were below, it feemed a  
proof that there had beeaa great bouleverfement in the furface of that  
ifland, {ome part of it having been deprefled under the fea, and  
ozher parts, which had been under it, being raifed above is. Such  
changes in the fuperficial parts of the g&#x27;obe, feemed to me unlikely  
to happen, if the earth were folid to the centre. I therefore ima-  
gined that the internal parts might be a fluid more denfe, and of  
greater {pecific gravicy than any of the folids we are acquainted  
with; which therefore might {wim in or upon that fluid, ‘Thas the  
furface of the globe would be a fhell,&#x27; capable of being broken and  
difordered by the violent movements of the fluid on which it refted.  
And, as air has been compretied by art fo as to be twice as denfe as  
water, in which cafe, if fuch air and water could be contained in a  
firong glafs veflel, the air would be feen to take the lowelt place, and  
the water to float above and upon it ; and, as we know not yet the  
degree of deufity to which air may be comprefled, and M. Amontons  
calculated, that its denfity increafing as it approached the centre in  
the fame proportion as above the furtace, it would, at the depth of  
leagues, be heavier than gold, poflibly the denfe fluid occu-  
pying the internal parts of the globe might be air comprefled. And  
as the force of expantion in dente air when heated, is in proportion  
ro its denfity ; this central air might afford another agent to move  
the furface, as well as be of ufe in keeping alive the central fires:  
tho’, as you obferve, the fudden rarefaction of water, coming into  
contaét, without thofe fires, may be an agent fufficiently flrovg for  
that purpofe, when acting between the incumbent earth and the fluid  
on which it refs.  
  
If one might indulge imagination in fuppofing how fuch a globe  
was formed, | fhould conceive, that all the elements in feparate par-  
tides, being originally mixed in confufion, and occupying a great  
f{pace, they would (as foon as the Almighty fiat ordained gravity, or  
the mutual attra@ion of certain parts, and the mutual repolfion of  
other parts, to exifi) all move towards their common centre : That  
the air being a fluid whofe parts repel each other, tho’ drawn to the  
common centre by their gravity, would be denfeft towards the cen:

tre, and rarer as more remote ; confequently, all bodies, lighter  
than the central parts of that air, and immerted in it, would recede  
from the centre, and rile till they arrived at that region of the air,  
which was of the fame {pecific gravity with themfelves, where they  
would reft ; while other matter, mixed with the lighter air, would  
defcend, and the two meeting would turm the fhell of the firft earth,  
leaving the upper atmolphere nearly clear. The original move-  
ment of the parts towards their common centre would form a whirl  
there ; which would continue in the turning of the new formed globe  
upon its axis, and the greatelt diameter of the fhell would be in its  
equator. If by any accident afterwards the axis thould be changed,  
the denfe internal fluid, by altering its form, muit burit the fhel! and  
throw all its fubftance into the confulion in which we find it. i will  
not trouble you at prefent with my fancies concerning the manner of  
forming the rett of aur fyftem. Superior beings fmile at our theories,  
and at our prefumption in making them. I will juit mention that  
your obfervation of the ferruginous nature of the lava, which is  
thrown out from the depths of our volcanoes, gave me great plea-  
fure. It has long been a tuppofition of mine, that the iron contain-  
ed in the fubftance of the globe has made it capable of becoming, as  
it is, a great magnet ; that the fluid of magnetifin exifts perhaps in  
all fpace ; fo that there is a magnetical North and South of the uni-  
verfe, as well as of this globe, and that if it were poffible for a  
man to fly from ftar to ftar, he might govern his courfe by the  
compals ; that it was by the power of this general magnetifm this  
globe became a particular magnet. In foft or hot iron the fluid of  
magnetifm is naturally diffufed equally : when within the intluence  
of a magnet, it is drawn to one end of the iron, made denfer there  
aud rarer at the other. While the iron continues foft and hot it is  
only a tempowary magnet: If it cools or grows hard in that fitua-  
tion, it becomes a permanent one, the magnetic fluid not eafily re-  
fuming its equilibrium. Perhaps it may be owing to the permanent  
magnetifm of this globe, which it had not at firft, that its axis is at  
prefent kept parrallel to itfelf, and not liable to the changes it for-  
merly fuffered, which occationed the rupture of its fheli, the fub-  
merfions and emerfions of its lands, and the confu‘ion of its feafons.  
The prefent polar and equatorial diameters differing from each other  
near ten leagues, it is ealy to conceive in cale fome power thould  
fhift the axis gradually, and place it in the prefent equator, and  
make the new equator pafs through the prefent poles, what a linking  
of the waters would. happen in the prefent equatorial regions, and  
what a rifing in the prefent polar regions ; fo that vait tracts-would  
be difcovered that now are under water, and others covered that  
now are dry, the water rifling and finking in the different extremes  
near five leagues. Such an operagion as tiris poflibly occafioned much  
of Europe, and among the re(te&amp;is mountain of Pafly on which | live,  
and which is compofed of limeftone, rock and fea-fhells, to be aban-  
doned by the fea, and to change its ancient climate, which feems to  
have been ahot one. The globe being now become a perfect mag-  
net, we are perhaps fafe from any future change of its axis. But

create that heator light; but only decompofe a fubftance  
which received it originally as a part of its compofition?  
Heat may thus be confidered as originally in a fluid ftate,  
but, attracted by organized bodies intheir growth, becomes  
a part of the folid. Befides this, I can conceive that in

Paffey, September 22, 1782.  
SIR,  
  
21, 1788.  
  
Read Nov, I RETURN the papers with fome corrections.  
  
I did not find coal mines under the Calcareous  
rock in Derby Shire. I only remarked that at the loweft  
part of that rocky mountain which was in fight, there  
were oyfter fhells mixed in the ftone; and part of the high  
county of Derby being probably as much above the level  
of the fea, as the coal mines of Whitehaven were below  
it, feemed a proof that there had been a great bouleverfe-  
ment in the furface of that Ifland, fome part of it having  
been depreffed under the fea, and other parts which had  
been under it beiny raifed above it. Such changes in the fu-  
perficial parts of the globe feemed to me unlikely to happen  
if the earth were folid tothe centre. I therefore imagined  
that the interral part might be a fluid more denfe, and of  
greater fpecific gravity than any of the folids we are ac~  
  
A quainted  
  
  
  
2 CONJECTURES on THE  
  
quainted with; which therefore might fwim in or upon  
that fluid. Thus the furface of the globe would be a fhell,  
capable of being broken and difordered by any violent  
movements of the fluid on which it refted. And as air  
has been compreffed by art fo as to be twice as denfe as  
water, in which cafe if fuch air and water could be con-  
tained in a ftrong glafs veflel, the air would be feen to  
take the loweft place, and the water to float above and  
upon it; and as we know not yet the degree of denfity  
to which air may be comprefled; and M. Amontons cal-  
culated, that its denfity increafing as it approached the  
centre in the fame proportion as above the {furface, it  
would at the depth of. leagues be heavier than gold,  
poflibly the denfe fluid occupying the internal parts of the  
globe might be air comprefled. Andasthe force of ex-  
panfion in denfe air when heated is in proportion to its  
denfity ; this central air might afford another agent to  
move the furface, as well as be of ufein keeping alive the  
fubterraneous fires: Though as you obferve, the fudden  
rarefaGliion of water coming into contact with thofe fires,  
may alfo be an agent fufficiently ftrong for that purpofe,  
when acting between the incumbent earth and the fluid on  
which it refts.  
  
If one might indulge imagination in fuppofing how  
fuch a globe was formed, I| fhould conceive, that all the  
elements in feparate particles being originally mixed in  
confufion and occupying a great {pace, they would as foon  
as the almighty fiat ordained gravity or the mutual attrac-  
tion of certain parts, and the mutual repulfion of other  
parts to exift, all move towards their common centre:  
That the air being a fluid whofe parts repel each other,  
though drawn to the common centre by their gravity,  
would be denfeft towards the centre, and rarer as more  
remote; confequently all matters lighter than the central  
part of that air and immerfed in it, would recede from the  
  
centre

centre and rife till they arrived at that region of the air  
which was of the fame fpecific gravity with themfelves,  
where they would reft; while other matter, mixed with  
the lighter air would defcend, and the two meeting would  
form: the fhell of the firft earth, leaving the upper atmof-  
phere nearly clear. The origiaal movement of the parts  
towards their common centre, would naturally form a  
whirl there; which would continue in the turning of the  
new formed globe upon its axis, and the greateft diameter  
of the fhell would be in its equator. If by any accident  
afterwards. the axis fhould be changed, the denfe internal  
fluid by altering its form muft burft the fhell and throw  
all its fubftance into the confufion in which we find it.  
  
I will not trouble you at prefent with my fancies con-  
cerning the manner of forming the reft of our fyftem.  
Superior beings {mile at our theories, and at our prefump-  
tion in making them. I will juft mention that your ob-  
fervation of the ferruginous nature of the lava which is  
thrown out from the depths of our valcanos, gave me great  
pleafure. Ithas long been a fuppofition of mine that the  
iron contained-in the fubftance of this globe, has made it  
capable of becoming as it is a great magnet. That the  
fluid of magnetifm exifts perhaps in all f{pace; fo that there  
isa magnetical North and South of the univerfe as well  
as of this globe, and that if it were poflible for a man to  
fly from ftar to ftar, he might govern his courfe by the  
compafs. That it was by the power of this general mag-  
netifm this globe became a particular magnet. In foft or  
hot iron the fluid of magnetifm is naturally diffufed equally;  
when within the influence of a magnet, it is drawn to one  
end of the iron, made denfer there, and rarer at the other,  
while the iron continues foft or hot, it is only a temporary  
magnet: If it cools or grows hard in that fituation, it be-  
comes a permanent one, the magnetic fluid not eafily re-  
fuming its equilibrium. Perhaps it may be owing to the  
  
A 2. permanent  
  
  
  
  
  
4 CONJECTURES on rue  
  
permanent magnetifm of this globe, which it had not at  
firft, that its axis is at prefent kept parallel to itfelf, and  
not liable to the changes it formerly fuffered, which occa-  
fioned the rupture of its fhell, the fubmerfions and emer-  
fions of its lands and the confufion of its feafons. * The  
prefent polar and equatorial diameters differing from each  
other near ten leagues ; it is eafy to conceive in cafe fome  
power fhould fhift the axis gradually, and place it in the  
prefent equator, and make the new equator pafs through  
the prefent poles, what a finking of the water would hap-  
pen in the prefent equatorial regions, and what a rifing in  
the prefent polar regions ; fo that vaft tra&amp;ts would be dif-  
covered that now are under water, and others covered that  
now are dry, the water rifing and finking in the different  
extremes near five Jeagues—Such an operation as this,  
poflibly, occafioned much of Europe, and among the reft,  
this mountain of Pafly, on which I live, and which is com-  
pofed of lime ftone, rock and fea fhells, to be abandoned  
by the fea, and to change its ancient climate, which feems  
to have been a hot one. The globe being now become  
a permanent magnet, we are perhaps fafe from any future  
change of its axis. But we are ftill fubje&amp; to the acci-  
dents on the furface which are occafioned by a wave in the  
internal ponderous fluid; and fuch a wave is producible  
by the fudden violent explotion you mention, happening:  
from the jun@tion of water and fire under the earth, which  
not only lifts the incumbent earth that is over the explofi-  
on, but impreffing with the fame force the Auid under it,.  
creates a wave that may run a thoufand leagues lifting and  
thereby fhaking fucceffively all the countries under which  
it pafles. I know not whether I have exprefled myfelf fo  
clearly, as not to get out of your fight in thefe reveries,  
If they occafion any new enquiries and produce a: better  
hypothefis, they will not be quite ufelefs. You fee I have  
given a loofe to imagination; but I approve much more

your method of philofophizing, which proceeds upon ac-  
tual obfervation, makes a collection of facts, and concludes  
no farther than thofe fas will warrant. In my prefent  
circumftances, that mode of ttudying the nature of this  
globe is out of my power, and therefore I have permitted  
myfelf to wander a litelein the wilds of fancy. With  
great efteem 1 have the honour to be, &amp;c.  
  
P..S. I have heard that chemifts can by their art de-  
compofe filone and wood, extra€ting a confiderable quan-  
tity of water from the one, and air from the other. It  
feems natural to conclude from this, that water and air  
were ingredients in their original compofition. For men  
cannot majwe gew matter of any kind. In the fame man-

of iKc high county of Dei by oeingpro-  
Wbiy ai much above the level of the  
  
(ea, as the coal mines of Whitehaven  
were below&#x27;, it Iccnied a proof, that  
there had been a great bouLverfemeut  
in the furfacc of that illa.ul, I&#x27;ome part  
of it having been deprefl&#x27;ed under the  
lea, and otlicr parts, which had been  
under it, being railed above it. Such  
changes in the fapcrficial parts of tb.c  
Globe Iccmed to me unlikely to hap¬  
pen if the Earth were loliei to the  
centre. I therefore imagine!, that tiie  
internal parts might be a duid more  
denfe, and of greater fptcilic gravity  
tlianaNVof the folids weave acquainted  
with, which, therefore, mlgh.t i&#x27;wim in  
or upon that fluid. Thus the furfacc  
of tne Globe Would be a Iheil capable  
«f being broken and dilordcred bv ^hc  
violent movements of the fluid on which  
it refted. And as air as been com-  
prclTcd &#x27;oy art Co as to be tw ice as dcnlc  
  
is water, in vbifh ca!V, if fiich ?ir  
and wattr couiJ be coutaihed in a itrong  
g!afs vtlTcl, the air \vould he Iccn to  
take the lowed place, and the water to  
float above and iipen it ; and as we  
know notvitthc decree « f dtnhty to  
which air may be conipitlfed, and M.  
Amontons calculated, that its dcnfity  
increafing as it approached the centre  
in the lainc propoition as above the  
I&#x27;urtacc, it would, at the depth of  
leagues, be heavier than gold, pofltbly  
the dcnle fluid occupying the internal  
parts of the Globe might be air cem-  
prefled. And as the force ot expanlion  
in denfc air when heated, is in propor¬  
tion to-its dcnfity, this central air might  
afford another agent to move the lur-  
facc, as well as be of ule in keeping  
alive the central fires ; though, as you  
obferve, tlic fudden rarefaction of wa¬  
ter, coming into contact, without thole  
fires, may be an ag^nt lulFicienily flrong  
for that purpoie, when acting between  
the incumbent catih and the fluid on  
which it reds.  
  
Jf one might indulge Imagination in  
fiippofing how fuch a Globe was formed,  
  
I ihould ct&#x27;Ticcive, that til r&#x27;tic tlenu*nt:»  
in ieparate particles being originally  
mixed in confalien, and occupying a  
great fpacc, they would (as foon as the  
Almighty di d ordained gravity, or the  
mutual attraction of ccitain parts, and  
the mutual Vepulfiouof others, to cxid)  
all move towards their common centre :  
1 hat the air being a fluid whole parts  
repel each other, though drawn ttj the  
common centre by their gravity, would  
bt den It ft towards the centre, andrarcr  
as more remote ; confcepicntly all bo-  
die* lighter than .the central parts of  
that air, and immerfed in it, would  
Ticedf Irom the centre, anti rife till  
they arrived at .that region of the air  
which was of the lame Ipecific gravity  
with themfclves, where tl»ty would  
red ; while ether matter, mixed wiih  
the lighter air, would defeerd, and  
the two meeting wouKl form the (hell  
ct the firft earth, leaving the upper  
atu.ofpherc nearly clear. The original  
movement of the parts towards their  
cemmon centre would form a whirl  
there ; which would continue upon tlic  
fetui ning of the new-formttl globe upon  
its axis, and the greateft diameter of  
the ihtll would be in its c(]uator. if  
by any accident afterwards the axis  
iTiOuld be changed, the denfc internal  
fluid, by altering its form, mud. burd  
the Ihtil, and throw all iu fubdaucc in;o  
  
the confufion in whicii we find it. I  
will not trouble* you Ct prefent with  
my fancies concerning the forming the  
red of our lvden\ Superior Keings  
fmi’.e at rur ihei&#x27;iiss, and at our pre-  
fuaiption ill rcakingthem. I willjud  
nieution that ytur obl&#x27;ervation of the  
ferruginous nanire of the lava which  
is thrown out from the depths of our  
volc.iiH)es, gave me great plexfurc. It  
has long been a fuppifition of mine,  
that the irou contained in the fubdanct  
of the globe, has made it capable of  
becoming, as it is, a great magnet ; that *  
the fluid of magnctifm perhaps cxifts  
in all fpacc i fo that there is a mag-&gt;  
netical North and South of the uni-  
vcrle, as wcllas of this giobe, and that if  
it were ^xiHible* for a man&#x27;to&#x27;fly from  
flar to dar, he might govern h.iscourfe  
by the compafs ; that it was by the  
•power &#x27;of this general magneiifm thit  
globe became a p.irticular magnet. In  
loft or liot iron the fluid of magnctifin  
is naturally dift&#x27;ufcd cuually j when  
within the influence of tlie magnet, it  
is drawn to one end of the iron, made  
denier tiiere and rarer at the other.  
W&#x27;hilc tlic iron continues foft and hot, it  
is only a tcniporary magnet ; if it cools  
or grows hard in that lituation, it be¬  
comes a permanent one, the magnetic  
fluid net eaiily refuming its equilibrium.  
Perhaps; it may be owing to the perma*  
lu nt magnctifin of this globe, whkh&#x27;it  
bad not at firfl, that its axis is at prefent  
kept parallel to itfelf, and not liable to  
the changes it formerly fuffered, which  
occafioned the rupture of its Ihcll, the  
fuhmeriions and enrerfions rf irt lands,  
and the confulion of its fcafous. The  
prefent polar and equatorial diameters  
differing from each other near ten  
leagues, it is cafy to conceive, in cafe  
fume power liiouhl fliift the axis gra¬  
dually, and piacc it in the prefent equa¬  
tor, and make the new equator paft  
throueh the prefent pules, what a fink¬  
ing of tlie waters would Iiappen in the  
prefent equatorial regions, and what a  
riflngin the prefent polar regions; fo  
that vaft trails would be difeovered that  
new arc under water, and others co¬  
vered that now arc dry, the wate^  
rifing and finking in the different ex¬  
tremes near five leagues. Such an ope¬  
ration as this poffibly cxcafioned much  
of Europe, and among&#x27;the reft this

when w ithin the influence of the magnet,

After remarking, that there are manifold indications of fome  
of the higheft parts of the land having been formerly covered by  
the fea, Dr Franklin obferves—  
  
‘ Such changes in the fuperficial parts of the globe, feemed to me  
unlikely to happen, if the earth were folid to the centre. I therefore  
imagined, that the internal parts might be a fluid more denfe, and of great-  
er {pecific gravity than any of the folids we are acquainted with, which  
therefore might {wim in or upon that fluid, ‘Thus the furface of the globe  
would be a thell, capable of being broken and difordered by the violent  
movements of the fluid on which it refted. And as air has been com.  
prefled by art fo as to be twice as denfe as water, and as we know not  
yet the degree of denfity to which air may be compreffed, and M. A-  
montons calculated, that its denfity increafing as it approached the cen-  
tre, in the fame proportion as above the furface, it would, at the depth  
of leagues, be heavier than gold, poffibly the denfe fluid occupy-  
ing the internal parts of the globe might be air compreffed. And as  
the force of expanfion in denfe air, when heated, is in proportion to its  
denfity, this central air might afford another agent to move the furface,  
as well as be of ufe in keeping alive the fubterraneous fires; though, as  
you obferve, the fudden rarefaGtion of water coming into contact with  
thofe fires, may alfo be an agent fufficiently ftrong for that purpofe,  
when acting between the incumbent earth and the fluid on which jt  
3 elts.  
  
‘ If one might indulge imagination in fuppofing how fuch a globe  
was formed, I fhould conceive, that all the elements in feparate parti-  
cles being originally mixed in confution, and occupying a great {pacc,  
they would (as foon as the almighty fiat ordained gravity, or the mu-  
tual attraction of certain parts, and the mutual repulfion of others, to  
exift) all move to their common centre: that the air being a fluid, whofe  
parts repel each other, though drawn to the common centre by their  
gravity, would be denfeft towards the centre, and rarer as more re-  
mote; confequently, all matters lighter than the central parts of that  
air, and immerfed in it, would recede from the centre, and rife till they  
arrived at that region of the air which was of the fame fpecific gravity  
with themfelves, where they would reft ; while other matter, mixed with  
the lighter air, would defcend, and the two meeting would form the  
hell of the firft earth, leaving the upper atmofphere nearly clear, The  
original movement of the parts towards their common centre, would  
naturally form a whirl there ; which would continue upon the turning  
of the new-formed globe upon its axis, and the greateft diameter of the  
thell would be in its equator. If, by any accident afterwards, the axis  
fhould be changed, the denfe internal fluid, by altering its form, muft  
burft the fhell, and throw all its fubftance into the confufion in which  
we find it. I will not trouble you at prefent with my fancies concern-  
ing the manner of forming the reft of our fyitem. Superior beings

He afterwards makes his theory much finer and more extrava-  
gant, by combining with it a very wild {peculation upon magnet-  
iffy ; and, notwithftanding the additional temptation of this new  
piece of ingenuity, he abandons it in the end with as much un-  
concern, as if he had had no fhare in the making of it. We  
fhall dd the whole paflage.  
  
‘ Tt has long been a fuppofition of mine, that the iron contained in  
the furface of the globe has made it capable of becoming, as it is, a  
great magnet ; that the fluid of magnetifm perhaps exifts im all fpace;  
fo that there is a magnetical north and fouth of the univerfe, as welt  
as of thie globe, and that if it were poffible for a man to fly from ftar  
to ftar, he might govern his courfe by the compafs ; that it was by the  
power of this general magnetifm this globe became a particular mag.  
net. Ip foft or hot iron the fluid of magnetifm is naturally diffufed  
equally ; when within the influence of the magnet it is drawn to one  
end of the iron, made denfer there and rarer at the other. While the  
iron contiaues foft and hot, it is only a temporary magnet; if it cools  
or grows hard in that fituation, it becomes a permanent one, the mag-  
netic fluid not eafily refuming its equilibrium. Perhaps it may be ow-  
ing to the permanent magnetifm of this globe, which it had not at  
firft, that its axis is at prefent kept parallel to itfelf, and not liable to  
the changes it formerly fuffered, which occafioned the rupture of ite  
fhell, the fubmerfions and emerfions of its lands, and the confufion of its  
feafons. The prefent polar and equatorial diameters differing from each  
other near ten leagues, it is cay to conceive, in cafe fome power fhould  
fhift the axis gradually, and place it in the prefent equator, and make  
the new equator pafs through the prefent poles, what a finking of the  
waters would happen in the prefent equatorial regions, and what a rif-  
ing in the prefent polar regions; fo that vaft tracts would be difcover-  
ed, that now are under water, and others covered, that are now dry,  
the water rifing and finking in the different extremes near five leagues.  
Such an operation as this poffibly occafioned much of Europe, and  
among the reft this Mountain of Pafly on which I live, and which is  
  
compofed of limeftone rock and fea- fhells, to be abandoned by the  
fea, and to change its ancient climate, which feems to have been a hot  
one. The globe being now become a perfect magnet, we are, perhaps,  
fafe from any change of its axis. But we are ftill fubje&amp;t to the accidents  
on the ate which are occafioned by a wave in the-internal ponderous  
fluid; and fych a wave is producible by the fudden violent explofion  
you mention, happening from the jun&amp;ion of water and fire under the  
earth, which not ovly lifts the incumbent earth that is over the explo-  
fion, but imprefling with the fame force the fluid under it, creates a  
wave, that may run a thoufand leagues, lifting, and thereby fhaking,  
fucceffivgly, all the countries under which it paffes. 1 know not, whe-

cations of some of the highest parts of the land  
having been ‘ormerly covered by the sea, Dr.  
Franklin observes—  
  
‘Such changes in the sup@ficial parts of the  
globe seemed to me unlikely to bappen, if the  
earth were solid to the ceutre. J therefore ima-  
gimed, that the interval parts might be a fluid  
more deuse, and of greater specific gravity than  
any of the solids we are acquainted with, which  
therefore might swim in or upon that fluid. Thus  
the surface of the globe would be a shell, capa-  
ble of being broken and disordered by the vi-  
vlent movements of the fluid on which it rested.  
And as air has been compressed by art so as to  
be twice as dense as water, and as we know not  
yet the degree of density to which air may be  
compressed, and M. Amontons ealeulated, that  
its density increasing as it approached the centre,  
inthe same proportion as above the surface, it  
would, at the depth of leagues, be heavier  
than gold, possilly the dense fluid occupying the  
internal parts of the globe might be air compress-  
ed. And as the force of expansion in dense air,  
  
  
  
when heated, is in proportion to its density, this  
central air might afford auother agent to move  
the surface, as well as be of use in keeping alive  
the subterraneous fires; though, as you observe,  
the sndden rarefaction of water coming into eon-  
tact with those fires, may also be an agent suffi-  
ciently strong for that purpose, when acting be-

it rests.  
‘If one might indalge imagination in supposing  
how such a globe was , I should conceive, .  
that all the elements in separate particles being  
originally mixed in confusion, and oceupying a  
great space, they would (as soon as the alinighty  
at ordained gravity, or the mutual attraction of  
certain parts, and the mutual repulsion of others,  
to exist) all move to their common centre : tha  
the air being a fluid, whose parts repel each other  
though drawn to the common centre by their gra-  
vity, would be densest towards the centre, and  
rarer as more remote; consequently, all matters  
lighter than the central parts of that air, and im-  
mersed in it, would reeede from the centre and  
rise till they arrived at that region of the air  
which was of the same specific gravity vith  
themselves, where they would rest; while other  
matter, mixed with the lighter air, would descend,  
and the two meeting would form the shell of the  
first earth, leaving the upper atmosphere nearly  
clear. The original movement of the parts te-  
wards their common centre, would naturally form  
awhirl there; which,would continue upon the  
turning of the new formed globe upon its axis,  
and the greatest diameter of the shell would be  
in its equator. If, by any accident afterwards,  
the axis should be changed, the dense internal  
fluid, by altering its form, must burst the shell,  
and throw all its substance into the confu-  
sion in which we find it. I will not trouble you at

Sir, ‘assy, September 22, 1782.  
  
I return the papers with some corrections. I did not  
find coal-mines under the calcareous rock in Derbyshire, I  
only remarked, that at the lowest part of that rocky mountain  
which was in sight, there were oyster shells mixed with the  
stone; and part of the high country of Derby being probably  
as much above the level of the sea as the coal-mines of  
Whitehaven were below, it seemed a proof that there had  
been a great bouleversement in the surface of that island,  
some part of it having been depressed under the sea, and  
other parts, which had been under it, being raised above it,  
Such changes in the superficial parts of the globe seemed to  
me unlikely to happen if the earth were solid at the centre,  
I therefore imagined that the internal parts might be a fluid  
more dense, and of greater specific gravity than any of the  
solids we are acquainted with ; which therefore might swim  
in or 7 that fluid. Thus the surface of the globe would  
be a shell, capable of being broken and disordered by the  
violent movements of the fluid on which it rested. And as  
air has been compressed by art so as to be twice as dense as  
water, in which case, if such air and water could be contained  
in a strong glass vessel, the air would be seen to take the  
lowest place, and the water to float above and upon it; and,  
as we know not yet the degree of density to which air ma  
be compressed, and M. Amontons calculated, that its densi-  
  
| spel om as it approached the centre in the same propors  
as above the surface, it would, at the depth of leagues,  
be heavier than gold, possibly the dense fluid occupying the  
  
  
  
  
  
internal parts of the globe might be air compressed. And  
as the force of expansion in dense air when heated, is in pro-  
portion to its density ; this central air might afford another  
agent to move the surface, as well as be of use in keeping  
alive the central fires; though, as you observe, the sudden  
rarefaction of water, coming into contact with those fires, may  
be an agent sufficiently strong for that purpose, when act-  
ing bet the i t earth, and the fluid on which it  
  
  
  
If one might indulge imagination in supposing how such a  
globe was emod, I Shcald sanecien, that vil the elements in  
separate particles, being originally mixed in confusion, and  
occupying a great space, me would (as soon as the Almigh-  
ty fiat ordained gravity, or the mutual attraction of certain  
parts, and the mutual repulsion of other parts, to exist)  
all move towards their common centre ; that the air being  
a fluid whose parts repel each other, though drawn to the  
common centre by their gravity, would be densest towards  
the centre, and rarer as more remote; Pipe ome all  
bodies, lighter than the central parts of that air, im-  
mersed in it, would recede from the centre and rise till they  
arrive at that region of the air which was of the same spe-  
cific gravity with themselves, where they would rest ; while  
other matter mixed with the lighter air, would descend, and the  
two, meeting, would form the shell of the first earth, leaving the  
upper atmosphere nearly clear, The original movement of  
the parts towards their common centre would form a whirl  
there: which would continue in the turning of the new formed  
globe upon its axis, and the greatest diameter of the shell  
would be in its equator. If by any accident afterward the  
axis should be changed, the dense internal fluid, by altering  
its form, must burst the shell, and throw all its substance into  
the confusion in which we find it. I will not trouble you at  
present with my fancies concerning the manner of forming  
the rest of our system. Superior beings smile on our Theo-  
ries, and at our presumption in making them, I will just  
mention that your observation of the ferruginous nature of  
the lava, which is thrown out from the de ths of our volca-  
noes gave me great pleasure. It has long been a supposition  
of mine, that the iron contained in the sub of the globe  
has made it capable of becoming, as it is, a great magnet ;  
that the fluid of mequeion exists perhaps in all space ; so  
that there is a magnetical North and South of the universe,  
as well as of this globe; and that if it were possible for a  
man to fly from star to star, he might govern his course by  
the compass : that it was by the power of this general mag-  
netism this globe became a particular — In soft or  
hot iron the fiuid of magnetism is naturally diffused equally ;  
when within the influence of a magnet, it is drawn to one end  
of the iron, made denser there and rarer at the other. While  
the iron continues soft and hot, it is only a temporary mag-  
net ; if it cools or grows hard in that situation, it becomes a  
permanent one, the magnetic fluid not easily resuming its  
equilibrium. Perhaps it may be owing to the permanent  
magnetism of this globe, which it had not at first, that its  
axis is at present kept parallel to itself, and not liable to the  
changes it formerly suffered, which occasioned the rupture of  
its shell, the submersions and emersions of its lands, and the  
confusion of its seasons. ‘The present polar and equatorial  
diameters differing from each other near ten leagues, it is  
easy to conceive, in case some power should shift the axis  
gradually, and place it in the present equator, and make the  
new equator pass through the present poles, what a sinking  
of waters would happen in the present equatorial regions,  
and what a rising in the present polar regions; so that  
vast tracts would * discovered that now are under water,  
and others covered that now are dry, the water rising  
and sinking in the different extremes near five leagues!  
Such an operation as this possibly occasioned much of Eu-  
rope, and, among the rest, of this mountain of Passy, on  
which I live, and which is composed of li , rock, and  
sea-shells, to be abandoned by the sea, and to change its an-  
cient climate, which seems to have been a hot one. The  
globe being now become a perfect magnet, we are perhaps  
safe from any future change of its axis. But we are still  
subject to the accidents on the surface, which are occasioned  
by a wave in the internal ponderous fluid: and such a wave  
is produced by the sudden violent explosion you mention,  
happening from the junction of water and fire under the earth,  
which not only lifts the incumbent earth that is over the ex-  
plosion, but impressing with the same force the fluid under it,  
creates a wave that may run a thousand leagues, lifting, and  
thereby shaking successively, all the countries under which  
it passes. I know not whether I have expressed myself so  
clearly, as not to get out of your sight in these reveries. If  
they occasion any new inquiries, and produce a better hypo-  
thesis, they will not be quite useless. You see I have given  
a loose to imagination, but I approve much more your method  
of philosophizing, which proceeds upon actual observation,  
makes a collection of facts, and concludes no farther than  
those facts will warrant. In my present circumstances, that  
mode of studying the nature of the globe is out of my power,  
and therefore I have permitted myself to wander a little in  
the wilds of fancy. With great esteem, I have the honor to  
ey Sir, &amp;e.  
B. FRANKLIN,  
  
P. S. I have heard that chemists can by their art decom-  
pose stone and wood, extracting a considerable quantity of  
water from the one, and air from the other. It seems natural  
to conclude from this, that water and air were ingredients in  
their original composition ; for men cannot make new matter  
of any kind. In the same manner do we not suspose, that  
when we consume combustibles of all kinds, and produce  
heat or light, we do not create that heat or light, we only  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
decompose a substance which received it originally as a  
of its compealien ? Heat may thus be considered be so  
inally in a fluid state; but, attracted by organized bodies in  
their growth, becomes a part of the solid. Besides this, {  
can conceive that, in the first assemblage of the particles of  
which this earth is composed, each brought its portion of the  
loose heat that had been connected with it, and the whole,  
when pressed together, produced the internal fire which still  
subsists,
