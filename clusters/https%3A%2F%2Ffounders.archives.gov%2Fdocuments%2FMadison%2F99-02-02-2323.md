Apl. 8. 1831  
  
  
  
I have duly recd. your letter of Mar. 30. In answer to your enquiries &quot;respecting the part acted by Govr.  
Morris (whose Life you observe you are writing) in the Federal Convention of 1787, and the political doctrines maintained  
by him&quot;, it may be justly said that he was an able, an eloquent, and an active member, and shared largely in the  
discussions succeeding the 1st. of July, previous to which, with the exception of a few of the early days, he was absent.  
Whether he accorded precisely with the &quot;political doctrines of Hamilton&quot; I cannot say. He certainly did not  
&quot;incline to the democratic side&quot;, and was very frank in avowing his opinions when most at variance with those prevailing  
in the Convention. He did not propose any outline of a Constitution as was done by Hamilton. But contended for certain  
Articles, (a Senate for life particularly) which he held essential to the stability and energy of a Government capable of  
protecting the rights of property against the spirit of democracy. He wished to make the weight of wealth to balance that  
of numbers, which he pronounced to be the only effectual security to each, against the encroachments of the other.  
The finish given to the style and arrangement of the Constitution, fairly belongs  
to the pen of Mr. Morris; the task having, probably, been handed over to him by the Chairman of the Committee, himself a  
highly respectable member, and with the ready concurrence of the others. A better choice could not have been made, as the  
performance of the task proved. It is true that the state of the materials, consisting of a Reported draft in detail, and  
subsequent resolutions accurately penned, and falling easily into their proper places, was a good preparation for the  
symmetry and phraseology of the Instrument: but there was sufficient room for the talents and taste stamped by the author  
on the face of it. The alterations made by the Committee are not recollected. They were not such as to impair the merit of  
the Composition. Those, verbal &amp; others, made in the Convention, may be gathered from the Journal, and will be  
found also to leave that merit altogether unimpaired.  
The anecdote you mention may not be without a foundation; but not in the extent supposed. It is certain that  
the return of Mr. Morris to the Convention was at a Critical stage of its proceedings. The Knot felt as the Gordian one,  
was the question between the larger &amp; the smaller States on the rule of voting in the Senatorial Branch of the  
Legislature; the latter claiming, the former opposing the rule of equality. Great zeal &amp; pertinacity had been  
shewn on both sides; and an equal division of Votes on the question, had been reiterated and prolonged, till it had become  
not only distressing but seriously alarming. It was during that period of gloom that Dr. Franklin made the proposition for  
a religious service in the Convention, an account of which was so erroniously given, with every semblance of authenticity,  
thro’ the National Intelligencer, several years ago. The crisis was not over When Mr. M. is said to have had an interview  
and conversation with Genl. Washington and Mr. R. Morris, such as may well have occurred. But it appears that on the day of  
his re-entering the Convention, a proposition had been made from another quarter to refer the knotty question to a  
Committee with a view to some compromize; the indications being manifest that sundry members from the larger States were  
relaxing in their opposition, and that some ground of compromize was contemplated, such as finally took place, and as may  
be seen in the printed Journal. Mr. Morris was in the deputation from the large State of Pennsylvania, and combated the  
compromise throughout. The tradition is however correct, that on the day of his resuming his seat, he entered with anxious  
feelings into the debate, and in one of his speeches painted the consequences of an abortive result to the Convention in  
all the deep colours suited to the occasion. But it is not believed that any material influence on the turn which things  
took, could be ascribed to his efforts. For, besides the mingling with them, some of his most disrelished ideas, the  
topics of his eloquent appeals to the members, had been exhausted during his absence, and their minds were too much made  
up to be susceptible of new impressions.  
It is but due to Mr. M. to remark that to the brilliancy &amp; fertility of his genius, he added what is  
too rare, a candid surrender of his opinions when the lights of discussion satisfied him that they had been too hastily  
formed, and a readiness to aid in making the best of measures in which he had been overruled.  
In making this hastened communication I have more confidence in the discretion with which it will be used,  
than in its fulfilment of your anticipations. I hope it will at least be accepted as a proof of my respect for your  
object, and of the sincerity with which I tender you a reassurance of the cordial esteem &amp; good wishes, in which

DISCIPLINE.  
By Geonor Hensert.  
O TRROW away thy rod,  
O throw away thy wrath!  
My gracious Saviour and my God,  
O take the gentle path !  
Thou seest my heart&#x27;s desire  
Still unto thee is bent ; ‘  
Still does my longing soul aspire  
‘uv an entire consent.  
Not even a word or look  
Do I approve or own,  
Bun by the model of thy hook,  
Thy sacred book alone.  
Although I fail, 1 weep 5  
Although 1 halt in pace,  
Yet still with trembling steps I creep  
Unto the throne of grace.  
O, then, let wrath remove

## The North American review

exertions could not have had much influence in producing the  
final result. In relation to the other subject of inquiry, Mr.  
Madison remarks, that the finish given to the style and ar-  
rangement of the Constitution fairly belongs to the pen of Mr.  
Morris; the task having probably been handed over to him by  
the chairman of the committee, himself a highly respectable  
member, and with the ready concurrence of the others. A  
better choice could not have been made, as the performance  
of the task proved. It is true, that the state of the materials,  
consisting of a reported draft in detail, and subsequent resolu-  
tions accurately penned, was a good preparation for the sym-  
metry and phraseology of the instrument; but there was suffi-  
cient room for the talent and taste, stamped by the author on  
the face of it. The alterations made by the committee are  
not recollected. They were not such, as to impair the merit  
of the composition. It thus appears, by the liberal testimony  
of the venerable individual, to whom, perhaps, more than to any  
other man, we owe the blessings which the adoption of this  
great instrument has brought upon us, that the honor due to  
Gouverneur Morris, as the writer of our Constitution, is hardly  
inferior to that which belongs to Mr. Jefferson, as the author  
of the Declaration of our independence. The task of both  
was rendered lighter, by the previous discussion of the subject

Morris, he says,

succeeding the Ist of July, previous to which, with the excep-

In one particular, we think that Mr. Morris’s opinion of the  
character of the party which came in with Mr. Jefferson, induced  
him to form exaggerated estimates of the dangers to which he  
thought the Constitution exposed. He was apprehensive, that  
as the power of the general government was so great, and was  
increasing so fast, the Constitution would be destroyed, and  
an unbalanced monarchy established on its ruins. We considet
