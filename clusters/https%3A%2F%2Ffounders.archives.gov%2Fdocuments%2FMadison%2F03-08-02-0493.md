[6 February 1815]  
  
Among the many evils produced by the wars, which, with little intermission, have afflicted Europe, and extended their ravages into other quarters of the globe, for a period exceeding twenty years, the dispersion of a considerable portion of the inhabitants of different countries, in sorrow and in want, has not been the least injurious to human happiness, nor the least severe in the trial of human virtue.  
It had been long ascertained, that many foreigners flying from the dangers of their own home, and that some Citizens, forgetful of their duty, had co-operated in forming an establishment on the Island of Barrataria, near the mouth of the river Mississippi, for the purposes of a clandestine and lawless trade. The Government of the United States caused the establishment to be broken up and destroyed: and having obtained the means of designating the offenders of every discription, it only remained to answer the demands of justice, by inflicting an exemplary punishment.  
But it has since been represented that the offenders have manifested a sincere penitence; that they have abandoned the prosecution of the worse cause, for the support of the best; and, particularly, that they have exhibited in the defence of New-orleans, unequivocal traits of courage and fidelity. Offenders, who have refused to become, the associates of the Enemy in the war upon the most seducing terms of invitation; and who have aided to repel his hostile invasion of the territory of the United States; can no longer be considered as objects of punishment, but as objects of a generous forgiveness.  
It has, therefore, been seen, with great satisfaction, that the General Assembly of the state of Louisiana earnestly recommend those offenders to the benefit of a full pardon: And in compliance with that recommendation, as well as in consideration of all the other extraordinary circumstances of the case, I James Madison, President of the United States of America do issue this Ploclamation [sic], hereby granting, publishing and declaring, a free and full pardon of all offences committed in violation of any Act or Acts of the Congress of the said United States, touching the revenue, trade, and navigation thereof; or touching the intercourse and commerce of the United States with foreign nations, at any time before the eighth day of January in the present year one thousand eight hundred and fifteen, by any person or persons whomsoever being inhabitants of New-orleans and the adjacent country, or being inhabitants of the said Island of Barrataria, and the places adjacent. Provided, that every person, claiming the benefit of this full pardon, in order to entitle himself thereto, shall produce a certificate in writing from the Governor of the state of  
  
Louisiana, stating that such person has aided in the defence of New-orleans, and the adjacent Country, during the invasion thereof as aforesaid.  
And I do hereby further authorise and direct all suits, indictments, and prosecutions, for fines, penalties, and forfeitures, against any person, or persons, who shall be entitled to the benefit of this full Pardon, forthwith to be stayed, discontinued, and released: And all civil officers are hereby required, according to the duties of their respective stations, to carry this Proclamation into immediate and faithful execution.  
Done at the City of Washington, the sixth day of February, in the year one thousand eight hundred and fifteen, and of the Independence of the United States the thirty ninth

Among the many evils produced by the wars,  
which, with little intermission, have afflicted*  
i Europe, and extended their ravages into other  
I qiiaiters of the globe, for a period exceeding 20  
I years, the dispersion of a considerable portion  
i of the inhabitants of different countries, in sor¬  
row and in want, has not been the least Injurious  
to human happiness, nor the least severe in the  
trial of human virtue.  
  
It has been long ascertained, that many fo¬  
reigners flying from the dangers of their own  
home, and that some citizens forgetful of their  
duty, had co-operated in forming- an establish¬  
ment on the Island ofBarrataria, near the mouth  
of the river Mississippi, Ibr the purpose of a  
clandestine and lawless trade. The govern-  
inent of the United States caused the establish¬  
ment to be broken up and destroyed : and,  
having obtained the means of designating the  
offenders of every description, it only remained  
to answer the demands ot* justice, by inflicting  
an exemplary punishment.  
  
But it has since been represented, that the  
offenders have manifested a sincere penitence ;  
that&#x27; they have abandoned the prosecution of  
the worst cause for the support of the best;  
and particularly, that they have exhibited, in  
the defence of New Orleans, unequivocal traits  
of courage and fidelity. Offenders, who have  
refused to become the associates of the enemy  
in the war, upon the most seducing terms of in¬  
vitation ; and who have aided to repel his hos¬  
tile invasion of the territory of the United  
States; can no longer- be considered as objects  
of punishment, but as objects of a generous for¬  
giveness.  
  
It has, therefore, been seen, with great satis-  
facti in, that the general Assembly of the state of  
Louisiana earnestly recommend those offender*  
to the benefit of a full pardon : And in compli¬  
ance with that recommendation, as well as in  
consideration of all the other extraordinary cir¬  
cumstances of the ca.se, I James Madison^ Presi¬  
dent of the United States of America, do issue  
this proclamation, hereby granting, publishing  
and declaring, a free and full pardon of all offen¬  
ces committed in violation of any act or acts of  
the congress of the said United States, touch¬

The President of the United States issued a proclamation declaring “a  
free and full pardon of all offenses committed in violation of any act or  
acts of Congress touching the revenue, trade or commerce of the United  
States with foreign nations at any time before the 8th of January, 1815,  
by any person or persons whatsoever, being inhabitants of New Orleans  
and the adjacent country, or being inhabitants of the island of Barataria

“It had been long ascertained that many foreigners, flying from the dangers of their  
own home, and that some citizens, forgetful of their duty, had_co-operated in forming an  
establishment on the island of Barataria, near the mouth of the river Mississippi, for the

establishment to be broken up and destroyed, and having obtained the means of designat-

by inflicting an exemplary punishment.  
  
“But it has been represented that the offenders have manifested a sincere repentance;
