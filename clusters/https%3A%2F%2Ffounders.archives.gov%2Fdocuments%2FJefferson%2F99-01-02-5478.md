Monticello Apr. 20. 07.  
  
Your favor of the 6th. on the subject of Burr’s offences was recieved only 4. days ago. that there should be  
anxiety &amp; doubt in the public mind in the present defective state of this proof is not wonderful; and this has been  
sedulously encouraged by the tricks of the judges to force trials before it is possible to collect the evidence dispersed  
through a line of 2000. miles from Maine to Orleans. the federalists too give all their aid, making Burr’s cause their  
own, mortified only that he did not separate the union or overturn the government, &amp; proving that had he had a little  
dawn of success they would have joined him to introduce his object, their favorite monarchy, as they would any other  
enemy, foreign or domestic, who could rid them of this hateful republic for any other government in exchange. the first  
ground of complaint was the supine inattention of the Administration to a treason stalking through the land in open day.  
the present one that they have crushed it before it was ripe for execution, so that no overt acts can be produced. this  
last may be true; tho’ I believe it is not. our information having been chiefly by way of letter, we do not know of a  
certainty yet what will be proved. we have set on foot an enquiry through the whole of the country which has been the  
scene of these transactions, to be able to prove to the courts, if they will give time, or to the public by way of  
communication to Congress, what the real facts have been. for obtaining this we are obliged to appeal to the patriotism of  
particular persons in different places, of whom we have requested to make the enquiry in their neighborhood, and on such  
information as shall be voluntarily offered. aided by no process or facilities from the federal courts, but frowned on by  
their new born zeal for the liberty of those whom we would not permit to overthrow the liberties of their country, we can  
expect no revealments from the accomplices of the chief offender. of treasonable intentions the judges have been obliged  
to confess there is probable appearance. what loophole they will find in it, when it comes to trial, we cannot foresee.  
Eaton, Stoddert, Wilkerson, and two others whom I must not name, will satisfy the world, if not the judges, on that head.  
and I do suppose the following overt acts will be proved 1. the enlistment of men, in a regular way. 2. the regular  
mounting of guard round Blannerhasset’s island when they expected Govr. Tiffin’s men to be on them, modo guerrino  
arraiati. 3. the rendezvous of Burr with his men at the mouth of Cumberland. 4. his letter to the acting governor of  
Misipi, on holding up the prospect of civil war. 5. his  
capitulation regularly signed with the aids–of the governor, as between two independant &amp; hostile commanders. but a  
moment’s calculation will shew that this evidence cannot be collected under 4. months, probably 5. from the moment of  
deciding when &amp; where the trial shall be. I desired mr Rodney expressly to in inform the Chief justice of this,  
inofficially. but mr Marshal says ‘more than 5. weeks have elapsed since the opinion of the Supreme court has declared  
the necessity of proving the overt acts, if they exist. why are they not proved?’ in what terms of decency can we speak of  
this? as if an express could go to Natchez or the mouth of Cumberland &amp; return in 5. weeks, which has never taken less  
than twelve. again ‘if in Nov. or Dec. last a body of troops had been assembled on the Ohio, it is impossible to suppose  
the affidavits establishing the fact could not have been obtained by the last of March.’ but I ask the judge where they should  
have been lodged? at Frankfort? at Cincinnati? at Nashville? St. Louis? Natchez? New Orleans? these were the probable  
places of apprehension &amp; examination. it was not known at Washington till the 26th. of March that Burr would escape from  
the Western tribunals, be retaken &amp; brought to an Eastern one: and in 5. days after (neither 5. months nor 5. weeks as  
the judge calculated) he says it is ‘impossible to suppose the affidavits could not have been obtained.’ where? at  
Richmond he certainly meant, or meant only to throw dust in the eyes of his audience. but all the principles of law are to  
be perverted which would bear on the favorite offenders who endeavor to overturn this odious republic. ‘I understand, sais  
the judge, probable cause of guilt to be a case made out by proof furnishing good reason to believe’ &amp;c. speaking  
as a lawyer, he must mean legal proof, i.e. proof on oath at least. but this is confounding probability and proof. we had  
always before understood that where there was reasonable ground to believe guilt, the offender must be put on his trial.  
that guilty intentions were probable, the judge believed. and as to the overt acts, were not the bundle of letters of  
information in mr Rodney’s hands, the letters and facts published in the local newspapers, Burr’s flight, &amp; universal  
belief or rumor, of guilt probable ground for presuming the facts of enlistment, military guard, rendezvous threat of  
civil war, or capitulation, so as to put him on trial? is there a candid man in the US. who does not believe some one, if  
not all, of these overt acts to have taken place?  
If there ever had been an instance in this or the preceding administrations of federal judges so applying  
principles of law as to condemn a federal, or acquit a republican offender, I should have judged them in the present case  
with more charity. All this however will work well. the nation will judge both the offender, &amp; judges for themselves. if  
a member of the Executive or Legislature does wrong, the day is never far distant when the people will remove him. they  
will see then &amp; amend the error in our constitution which makes any branch independant of the nation, they will see that  
one of the great co-ordinete branches of the government, setting itself in opposition to the other two, and to the common  
sense of the nation, proclaims impunity to that class of offenders which endeavors to overturn the constitution, and are  
themselves protected in it by the constitution itself: for impeachment is a farce which will not be tried again. if their  
protection of Burr produces this amendment it will do more good than his condemnation could have done. against Burr  
personally I never had one hostile sentiment. I never indeed thought him an honest frank-dealing man, but considered him  
as a crooked gun or other perverted machine whose aim or stroke you could never be sure of. still, while he possessed the  
confidence of the nation, I thought it my duty to respect in him their confidence, &amp; to treat him as if he deserved it:  
and if his punishment can be commuted now for an useful amendment of the constitution, I shall rejoice in it.—my sheet  
being full I percieve it is high time to offer you my friendly salutations and assure you of my constant &amp;  
affectionate esteem &amp; respect.

Mo.nticei.lo, April 21), 1807.  
Dear Sir.—Your favor of the tith instant, on the  
subject of Burr’s offences, was received only four  
days ago. That there should be anxiety and doubt  
in the public mind, in the present defective&#x27;state of  
the proof, is not wonderful; and this has been sedu­  
lously encouraged by the tricks of the judges to force  
trials before it is possible to collect the evidence, dis­  
persed through a line of two thousand, miles from  
Maine to Orleans. The federalists too, give all  
their aid, making Burr’s cause their own, modified  
only that he did not separate the Union or overturn  
the government, and proving that had he hud a lit­  
tle dawn of success, they would have joined him to  
introduce his object, their favorite monarchy, as they  
would any other enemy, foreign or domestic, who  
could rid thorn of this hateful republic for any other  
I government in exchange.  
  
me nrsi ground ot complaint was tno supine in­  
attention of the administration to a treason stalking  
through the laud in open day. The present one,  
that they have crushed it before it was ripe for exe­  
cution, so that no overt acts can be produced. This  
last may be true ; though I believe it is not. Our  
information having been chiefly by way of letter, we  
do not know of a certainty what will yet be proved.  
We have set on foot an inquiry through the whole of  
the country which has been the scene of these trans­  
actions, to be able to prove to the courts, if they will  
give time, or to the public by way of communication  
to Congress, what the real facts have been. For ob­  
taining this we are obliged to appeal to tho patriot­  
ism of particular persons in different places, of whom  
we have requested to make the inquiry in their  
neighborhood, and on such information as shall he  
voluntarily offered. Aided by no process of facili­  
ties from the federal courts, hut frowned on by ihoir  
new born zeal for the liberty of their country, we  
can expect no revealnients from the accomplices of  
the chief offender. Of treasonable intentions, the  
judges have been obliged to confess there is probable  
appearance. What loophole they will find in the case,  
wnen it coroes to trial, we cannot foresee. Faton,  
Stoddurt, Wilkisson, and two others whom I must  
not name, will satisfy the world, if not the judges, of  
Burr’s guilt. And I do suppose the following overt  
acts will be proved. 1. The enlistment of men, in  
a regular way. 2. The regular mounting of guard  
round Blannerliassett’s island when they expected  
Governor Tiffin&#x27;s men to he on them, motloguerrino  
arraiati. 3. The rendezvous of Burr with his men  
at the mouth of Cumheiland. 4. His letter to the  
acting Governor of Mississippi, holding up the pros­  
pect of civil war. 5. His capitulation reglarly sign­  
ed with the aids of the Governor, as between two  
independent and hostile commanders.  
but a moment’s calculation will shew that this  
evidence caunot be collected underfour months, pro­  
bably live, from the moment of deciding when and  
wneie the trial shall be. I desired Mr Rodney ex­  
piussly to inform the Chief Justice of this, inofficial­  
ly. but Mr Marshall says, ‘more than five weeks  
nave elapsed since the opinion of the {Supreme Coui t  
has declared the necessity of proving the overt acts  
it they exist. VV liy are they not proved /’ In what  
terms of decency can we speak of this? As if an  
express could go to Natchez, or lo the mouth of  
Cumberland, and return in five weeks, to do which  
ha* never taken less than twelve. Again, * if, in  
November or December lust, a body of troops had  
been as.-etnbled on the Ohio, it is impossible to sup­  
pose the ultidavils establishing tiie fact could not  
nave been obtained by the last of March?’ But I  
ask tiie Judge where they should have been lodged ?  
At i&#x27;lankfort? at Cincinnati? at Nashville? St  
Louis? Natchez? Nevv-Orleans? These were the  
probable places of uppieheusion and examination,  
it was uot known at Washington till the 2oth of  
March that Burr would escape from the western  
tnbunals, be retaken and brought to an eastern one:  
and in five days alter (neither five months nor five  
weeks us the Judge calculated) he sa»s, it is * impos­  
sible to suppose the evidence could not have been  
obtained.’ Where? At Richmond he certainly  
meant, or meant only to throw dust in the eyes of his  
audience. But all the principles of law are to be  
perverted which w.mld bear on the favoiite offenders  
who endeavor to overtu.n this odious republic. * I  
understand,’ suys the Judge, •probable cause of guilt  
to be a case made out of proof furnishing good  
reason to believe,’ &amp;c. Speaking as a lawyer, he  
must mean legul proof, i. e. proof on oath, at least.  
But this is confounding probability and proof. We  
had always before understood that where there w as  
[ reasonable ground to believe guilt, the offender must  
! be put on his tiial. That guilty intentions were  
probable, the Judge believed. And as to the overt  
acts, were not the bundle of letters of information in  
Mr Rodney&#x27;s hands, the letters and fucts published  
in the local newspapers, Burr’s (light, and the uni­  
versal belief or rumor of his guilt, probable ground  
for presuming the facts of enlistment, military guard,  
rendezvous, threat of civil war, or capitulation, so ns  
to put him on trial ? Is there a candid mun in the  
United {States wo does not believe some one, if not  
all, of these overt acts to have taken place ?  
If there ever had been an instance in this or the  
preceding administations, of federal judges so apply­  
ing principles of law as to condemn a federal or ac­  
quit a republican offender, 1 should have judged  
them in the pieseutcase with more charity. All this,  
however, will work well. The nation will judge  
both the offender and judges for themselves. If a  
memlttr of the executive or legislature does wrong,  
the day is never far distant when the people will re­  
move him. They will see then and amend the er­  
ror in our constitution, which makes any branch in­  
dependent of-the nation. They trill see that one of  
the greut co-ordinate brunches oj the government, set­  
ting itself in opposition to the other tiro, and to the  
common sense oj the nation, proclaims impunity to  
that class of offenders which endeavors to overt urn the  
constitution, and arc thews el res protected in it by the  
constitution itself: for impeachment is a farce which  
will nut be tried again. If their protection of Burr  
produces this amendment, it will do more good than  
his condemnation would have done. Against Burr,  
personally, I never had one hostile sentiment. I  
never indeed thought him an honest, frunk-deal­  
ing man, but considered him as a crooked gun, or  
other perverted machine, whose aim or shot you  
could never he sure of. Still, while he possessed  
the confidence of the nation, I thought it my duly  
to respect in him their confidence, and to treat him  
as if lie deserved it: and if his punishment can he  
commuted now for an useful amendment of the con­  
stitution, 1 shall rejoice in it. Mv sheet being full,  
I perceive it is high time to offer you my friendly  
salutations, and assure you of my constant and affec­  
tionate esteem and respect. TH: JEFFERSON
