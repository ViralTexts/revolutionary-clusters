 and duties and the obviousness of the principle are a security that no inconveniences will be permitted to arise from repetitions of it.  
The purchase of arms and military accoutrements by an agent of the french Government, in this Country, with an intent to export them to France, is the subject of another of the memorials. Of this fact, we are equally uninformed, as of the former. Our Citizens have been always free to make, vend, and export arms. It is the constant occupation and livelihood of some of them. To suppress their callings, the only means perhaps of their subsistence because a war exists in foreign and distant countries, in which we have no concern, would scarcely be expected. It would be hard in principle, and impossible in practice. The law of nations, therefore, respecting the rights of those at peace, does not require from them such an internal derangement in their occupations.  
  
It is satisfied with the external penalty pronounced in the President’s proclamation, that of confiscation of such portion of these arms as shall fall into the Hands of any of the belligerent powers on their way to the ports of their enemies. To this penalty our Citizens are warned that they will be abandoned and that even private intraventions may work no inequality between the parties at war, the benefit of them, will be left equally free and open to all.  
The capture of the British Ship Grange, by the French frigate l’Embuscade, has, on inquiry been found to have taken place within the Bay of Delaware and Jurisdiction of the United States, as stated in your memorial of the 2d instant—the Government is therefore, taking measures for the liberation of the Crew and restitution of the Ship and cargo.  
It condemns in the highest degree the conduct of any of our citizens, who may personally engage in committing hostilities at sea against any of the nations, parties to the present war, and will exert all the means with which the laws and constitution have armed them to discover such as offend herein and bring them to condign punishment.

Instructions are consequently given to the proper law officer to institute such proceedings as the laws will justify, for apprehending and punishing certain individuals of our Citizens suggested to have been concerned in enterprises of this kind, as mentioned in one of your memorials of the 8th instant.  
The practice of commissioning, equipping and manning Vessels, in our ports to cruise on any of the belligerent parties, is equally and entirely disapproved, and the Government will take effectual measures to prevent a repetition of it. The remaining point in the same memorial, is re

The quotation which has just been made shows that such  
questions are not new. A long correspondence arose upon this  
subject in 1794, when war broke out between France and England,  
America being neutral, and was continued during 1795 and 1796.  
The correspondence, which lies before us in the American State  
Papers, is, at the present moment, both amusing and instructive,  
now that the tables are turned, and the neutral of those days is the  
belligerent of our own time. The belligerents of those days were

of some of them. To suppress their  
callings, the only means perhaps of their

further citations, that from the days

Hammond, as follows:  
Our citizens have always been free to make, vend,  
and export arms. It is the constant occupation and  
livelfhood of some of them. To suppress their call­  
ing, the only means perhaps of their subsistence, be­  
cause a war exists in foreign and distant countries,

such an internal derangement of their occupations.  
Daniel Webster, Secretary of State, wrote  
in 134.  
  
Mr. Becarregas declares that his Government finds  
itself under the necessity of protesting solemnly  
against the aggressions which the citizens of the  
United States are reiterating upon the Mexican terri­  
tory, and of declaring in a positive manner that it  
will consider as a vlolation of the treaty of amity the  
toleration of that course of conduct which he alleges

Snow, another great authority, says: &quot;As to
