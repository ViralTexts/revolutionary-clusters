 or inattention of the framers of the  
treaty to the locality and courses of the river, has produced the  
monstrous absurdity, that there is actually no readily practicable  
communication between Lower Canada and New Brunswick,  
without crossing a part of the American territory, now called the  
province of Maine.  
  
It then proceeds westward along the forty-fifth degree of lati-  
tude, till it reaches the St. Lawrence, cutting off, in a most artifi-  
cial and unnatural manner, the water communications of Lake  
Champlain and Lake George, with the St. Lawrence ; thence  
along the middle of the St. Lawrence into Lake Ontario, through  
the water communication between it and Lake Erie, through the  
middle of Lake Erie to the water communication with Lake Hu-  
ron, through that, and then across Lake Huron in a northerly di-  
rection, and through the straits of St. Mary into Lake Superior.  
  
That no geographical blunders took place in the drawing of this  
extensive line from the St. Lawrence to Lake Superior, may be  
ascribed to the plain direct course, which did not admit of igno-  
rance or inattention deyiating either to the right or the left. But  
the line is thenceforward described to extend through Lake Supe-  
rior northward to the isles Royal and Philippeaux, to the Long  
Lake, and the water communication between it and the Lake of  
the Woods ; thence through that lake to the northernmost point  
thereof, and thence in a due line west to the river Missisippi.

As the United States succeeded  
to the territorial rights of England  
this possession could only be held  
for their benefit; and as they had  
contributed to the retaking Pensa-  
cola and East Florida, there was  
no ground for a claim of indemni-

amicably adjusted by the treaty of  
peace in 1783. By the provisional

&quot;Perhaps there is a distinction between good  
feeling and diplomacy which I do not clearly ap-  
preciate, and I can only say that I have never  
essayed to divide the two. But as the only  
diplomacy I ever professed or ever practiced  
was the diplomacy of simple good faith and  
honor, good fecling naturally ran in the same  
current and never was forgotten. When Ben­  
samin Franklin, John Adams, John Jay, and A  
Henry Laurens signed the treaty with George   
III in April, 1783, they prefaced that momen-  
tous act by the words which by your favor I  
will read to you:  
Whereas, Reciprocal advantages and mutual con­  
venfence are found by experience to form the only  
permanent foundation of peace and friendship be­  
tween States, it is agreed to form the articles of the  
proposed treaty on such principles of liberal equityI  
and reciprocity, as that partial advantages tthose  
seeds of discord) being excluded, such a beneficial and  
satisfactory intercourse between the two countries  
may be established as to promise and secure to both  
perpetual peace and harmony
