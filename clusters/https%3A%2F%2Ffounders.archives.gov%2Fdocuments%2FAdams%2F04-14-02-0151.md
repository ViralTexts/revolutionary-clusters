h gratified by your anecdotes respecting the proceedings in the Senate upon the Treaty— The opposition gentlemen must indeed be at a loss for the materials of censure upon the Government, when they are willing to make use of such disapprobation as I ever express’d or felt concerning any part of its administration.  
				The orations in honour of that venerable man, who now only lives in memory, as a model for Statesmen and heroes, gave me likewise great pleasure, though not all worthy of the illustrious character they commemorate— Poor as our country unfortunately is in the most elegant departments of literature, I cannot but hope that some native unsophisticated American will be found to give the world a specimen  
  
of biography, which may be in its way, as useful and honourable as the life it will record— A subject, in every respect so admirable ought to be amply treated by the wisest head, and the most excellent heart contained in the Union.  
				Webster’s letters to Dr: Priestley, are sensible, and temperate—perhaps too temperate; a virtue which is apt to degenerate into frigidity— He has treated with less severity than it deserved the insidious and hypocritical attempt of the Doctor to attack our Government and Constitution; upon the pretence of defending himself— The doctor seems to have felt peculiar sensibility, at Porcupine’s calling him an hypocrite, for the sting of Satire is never so sharp, as when pointed by truth— Now if there were no other instance to give than one I mentioned in my last; the Doctor’s assertion, that he wishes for a total revolution of Government in England, but that it may be effected peaceably, this alone would suffice to stamp him for an hypocrite; that is, a man who pretends to virtues which he does not possess.— Shallow as Doctor Priestley’s political opinions are, he is not fool enough to believe this possible, or to wish sincerely what he knows to be impossible.— The real wish therefore is for the revolution, and the added proviso, that it may be peaceably effected, is a mere pretence to sentiments of humanity, which he did not feel, and therefore pure genuine hypocrisy.  
				It is not at-all surprizing that the American jacobins should be dissatisfied with the late changes in France, and the new Constitution there, which has so formally abjured all their favourite tenets— The french jacobins are as little pleased with it; but as long as the first Consul shall be a victorious general they dare not stir.— The State of France has been very much ameliorated in every respect by this change— Internally a dangerous rebellion has been suppressed, and externally victory has returned in every quarter to their banners.— A power greater than that of any limited monarch in Europe has indeed been committed to the first Consul; but his character improves by success; he has done very few improper things since he attained his present station, and many wise things— His fate now depends again upon the chance of War, and as every present prospect promises him a career of victory calculated to increase still higher his military reputation, it is probable that his power may acquire a consistency, that could not be expected when he ventured upon the bold attempt which seated him at the head of the french Nation— It is indeed yet impossible to consider him as a principled man— His ambition like that of other conquerors scruples little  
  
what means it employs; but it has certainly great and noble views, and the prospects of France in case of his failure are in every particular so much worse than what she may hope from seeing him established firmly, that I believe this is really to be wished.  
				There is nothing in which the french policy has been so much improved and amended under the present administration, than as in their treatment of other nations, and especially of the neutral States— All their plundering and barbarous decrees against neutral navigation have been rescinded; and they have established as a court of final appeal in admiralty causes, a tribunal which they call the Council of prizes. They have commenced their sessions and their first decision was an act of signal justice to citizens of the United States— The ship Pigou of Philadelphia had been taken by two national frigates, and condemned by the two inferior courts of Admiralty—in the second instance, both vessel and cargo; for the want of a rôled’equipage. But as it appear’d the want of this paper was owing to the yellow fever’s being at Philadelphia, when the vessel sail’d, the Council of prizes have revers’d the sentences of the lower Courts, decreed the restoration and of the ship and cargo; and costs and damages to the appellants. Such at least is the account I find in the last Paris news-papers, though I have it not from either of our Commissioners— If the fact be so, as I believe it is, and the Council of prizes proceed to act with the same equity and regard for the laws of Nations, in other cases, the negotiations of our Commissioners will be greatly facilitated, and the issue will shew how really prudent and politic the appointment of this mission to France was.— Yet this incident serves to show how little we can calculate upon the effects of public measures upon the public mind— From most of our accounts, it should seem that this very measure has weakened the influence of the person at the head of the American Government— That it alienated many of the friends to the Government, without gaining any of its enemies— The next election will doubtless shew how far these surmizes are well grounded. But neither our age nor Country have been the first to discover that  
				  
					“An habitation giddy and unsure  
					Hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart.”

&quot; I was much by y.our anriec­  
ilotes refpedting the proceedings in the Se­  
nate Vipon the Tieaty.. The opposition gen­  
tlemen mud indeed be at a loss for the ma­  
terials of ceil lure upon the Government,  
when they are willing to m..ke trie of such  
dilapprobatian as I everexpreffed or felt con­  
cerning any part ot its atlminiftration.  
  
Ihe orations in honor of that venerable  
man,, who now only lives in memory, as a  
model for statesmen and heroes, gave me  
li*wife great pleaiure, though not all w.n­  
thy of&#x27; the illultnous charter they com­  
memorate. Pnor our country ui)for;u­  
n*tc&#x27;y 18 jn the mull elegant departments,Qt  
literature, I cannot but hope that some na­  
tive unsophisticated American will be found  
to give the wo: Id a specimen of biography,  
which may be in its way, as ufeful and ho­  
norable as the life it will record a fubjeft  
in every refpe,ft so admirable ought to be  
amply treated by the wisest head, and the  
mod excellent heart cainained in the union.  
  
WeblYer&#x27;s letter* to Dr. Priestley are  
frnfibte, arid temperate—perhaps too tempe­  
rate. a virtue which is apt to degenerate in­  
to frigidity. He has treated with less seve­  
rity than it delerved, the inlidious and hypo­  
critical attempt of the Dodtor to attack our  
government and conllitution, upon the pte­  
tence ef defending himfelf. The Dodtor  
seems to have felt peculiar fcnfibility, at  
Porcupine&#x27;s calling him an hypocrite; for  
the fling of satire is never so (harp, as when  
pointed by trnth. Now if there were 110  
other inflance to prive, than one I men­  
tioned in niy lali, the DiCtoi&#x27;s aflertion that  
he wishes for a total revolution of govern­  
ment in England, but that it may be effect­  
ed peaceal-lj, this alone would fuffice to  
lUmp.hiui far an hypocrite ; that is a man  
who pie.tpnd&amp;.to virtues which he does not  
pofle(s. Shallow as Dodtor Prieltley&#x27;s politi­  
cal opinions are, he is not fool enough to  
believe this polfible, or to wilU liacerely  
what li* knows to be impofliblr. The real  
wish therefore is for the revolution, and the  
aUded proviso, that it may be peaceably  
effected, is * mere prrtence to sentiments of  
humanity, which he did not feel, and theie­  
fore pure genuine hypocricy.  
It is not at all surprising tlut the Arr.e­  
rican Jacobins fliould be dilfitisfied with the  
1-ite changes in Fiance, and the new con­  
stitution there, which hasfo formally abjui­  
ed all their favorite tenets. The French  
Jacobins are as little pit a fed with it -r but  
as long as the full Consul Hull be a vlfto­  
rious general, they dare not (tir. The state  
of Fiance n«s been very much ameliorated  
ia every refpedt by this change—lnternally,  
a dangerous lebellion has been suppressed, I  
and externally,vi&amp;ory has returned in every  
quarter to their bann-rs. A power, greater I  
than that of any limited monarch in Europe,  
has indued tieen committed to the fultCm- i  
ful ; but hischarafter improves byfuccefs ;  
he has done very few improp-r things, since !  
he attained his phrfent Ration, and many ;  
wife things. His fate now depends again  
Upon the chance &gt;f war, and as every pie­  
-Iclit prulpe£t promiles him a career of  
viftory, calculated to incrrafe Hill higher  
hi* military reputation, it i* probable that  
hie power may acquire a conliflencv, that  
could not be expetted when he ventuied up­  
on the bold attempt which leated him at the  
head of the French nation. It is indeed  
yet imppflible to consider him as a princi­  
pled man. His ambition like that of other  
conquerors scruples little what means it em­  
ploy, but it has certainly great and noble  
views, and the profpeAi of France, in cafe  
of his failuie, are in every particular so  
much worse than what she may hope from  
feeing him eUablillted firmly, that 1 believe  
this is really to be wilhed.  
There is nothing in which the French  
policy has been so much improved and a­  
nirfilded under the pre fell 1 administration, as  
in their treatment of other nations, and ef|w­  
ciallv of the neutrjl dates—all their plun­  
dering and barbarous decrees againll neutral  
navigation, Inve been refcindcd. and they  
have effablifhrj as a coivrt of final appeal in  
admiralty causes, a tribunal, which they  
call the Council of Prizes. They have com­  
menced their sessions, and their si*(l deciiion  
was an art of figliaj jullice to citizens of the  
United States. The Ship Pipou of Phila­  
delphia, had been taken, br two national  
frigates, and condemned hy the two inferior&#x27;  
Courts of Admiralty—-in the i&#x27;econd inft.mce  
both vessel and cargo, for the want of a role  
d&#x27;equipage. But »sit appeared the want of  
this paper was owing to the Yellow Fever  
being at Philadelphia, when &#x27;.he vefTcl fail­  
ed, the Council of Piizes ha\e reverftd the  
fen tenets of t! e Lower Court, decreed the  
refloration of the fliip and cargo, and cofls  
and damages to the appealants. Sucli at  
leaff isthe account I find in the lall Paris  
Papers, though I have it not from either of  
our Commiffiom-rs. If the faiil be so, as I  
believe it is, aiut the Consul of Prizes pro­  
ceed to aft with »he fame equity and regaid  
for the laws of nations, in other cases, ihe  
negotiations of our donlmiljioners will be  
greatly facilitated, and the ifTue will lliew  
how really prudent and politic the appoint­  
ments of this initfiou to France was. Yet  
this incident serves to fliew how little we  
can calculate upon the clefts us public niea­  
fures upon the public mind. From moss of  
our acceun •• it should leem lhat tins very  
measure has weakened i&#x27;fluenc* of the  
person at the head of the American Govern­  
ment. That it alienated many of the j  
Frieuds to the government, without gaining j  
any of it* enemies. The iwxt eleftißii will  
doubtUfi fliew how far tliefe furniife. are  
well grounded. But neither our age nor  
country have been tlie firft to dilcover t&gt; it.

How changed the popular breath in Europe  
now! The French Emperor and the Sardinian  
Monarch receive an ovation from the English, and  
municipal addresses flow in toboth of them from all  
parts of the United Kingdom. The British Queen  
is similarly greeted in Paris, and Canrobert, late  
one of the Decembrist generals, but now a dip  
lemat, can call forth enthusiastic popular de­  
menstratiens at Stockholmn. The late expulsion
