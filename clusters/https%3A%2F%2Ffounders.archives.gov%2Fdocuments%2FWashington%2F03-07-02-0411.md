y expectation the Enemy began to advance upon us, and after some skirmishing the Head of their Column reached Trenton about 4 OClock, whilst their rear was as far back as Maidenhead. They attempted to pass Sanpink Creek, which runs through Trenton at different places, but finding the Fords guarded, halted &amp; kindled their Fires—We were drawn up on the other side of the Creek. In this situation we remained till dark, cannonading the Enemy &amp; receiving the fire of their Field peices which did us but little damage.  
Having by this time discovered that the Enemy were greatly superior in number and that their design was to surround us, I ordered all our Baggage to be removed silently to Burlington soon after dark, and at twelve OClock after renewing our fires &amp; leaving Guards at the Bridge in Trenton and other passes on the same stream above, marched by a roundabout Road to Princeton, where I knew they could not have much force left and might have Stores. One thing I was certain of, that it would avoid the appearance of a retreat, (which was of course or to run the hazard of the whole Army being cut off) whilst we might by a fortunate stroke withdraw Genl Howe from Trenton and give some reputation to our Arms. happily we succeeded. We found Princeton about Sunrise with only three Regiments and three Troops of light Horse in it, two of which were on their march to Trenton—These three Regiments, especially the Two first, made a gallant resistance and in killed wounded and Prisoners must have lost 500 Men, upwards of One hundred of them were left dead in the Feild, and with what I have with me &amp; what were taken in the pursuit &amp; carried across the Delaware, there are near 300 prisoners 14 of which are Officers—all British.  
This peice of good fortune is counterballanced by the loss of the brave and worthy Genl Mercer, Cols. Hazlet and Potter, Captn Neal of the Artillery, Captn Fleming who commanded the first Virginia Regiment and four or five other valuable Officers who with about twenty five or thirty privates were slain in the feild—Our whole loss cannot be ascertained, as many who were in pursuit of the Enemy, who were chaced three or four Miles, are not yet come in.  
  
  
  
  
The rear of the Enemy’s Army laying at Maidenhead (not more than five or Six miles from Princeton) was up with us before our pursuit was over, but as I had the precaution to destroy the Bridge over Stoney Brooke (about half a mile from the Feild of action) they were so long retarded there as to give us time to move off in good order for this place. We took Two Brass Feild peices but for want of Horses could not bring them away. We also took some Blankets—Shoes—and a few other trifling Articles—burnt the Hay &amp; destroyed such other things as the shortness of the time would admit of.  
My Original plan when I set out from Trenton was to have pushed on to Brunswic, but the harrassed State of our own Troops (many of them having had no rest for two nights &amp; a day) and the danger of loosing the advantage we had gained by aiming at too much induced me by the advice of my Officers to relinquish the attempt, but in my Judgement Six or Eight hundred fresh Troops upon a forced march would have destroyed all their Stores and Magazines—taken as we have since learnt their Military Chest containing 70,000£ and put an end to the War. The Enemy from the best intelligence I have been able to get were so much alarmed at the apprehension of this, that they marched immediately to Brunswick without halting except at the Bridges, (for I also took up those on Millstone on the different routs to Brunswick) and got there before day.  
From the best information I have received, Genl Howe has left no men either at Trenton or Princeton. The truth of this I am endeavouring to ascertain that I may regulate my movements accordingly—The Militia are taking spirit and I am told, are coming in fast from this State, but I fear those from Philadelphia will scarcely submit to the hardships of a winter Campaign much longer, especially as they very unluckily sent their Blankets with their Baggage to Burlington—I must do them justice however to add, that they have undergone more fatigue and hardship than I expected Militia (especially Citizens) would have done at this inclement Season. I am just moving to Morris town where I shall endeavour to put them under the best cover I can. hitherto we have been without any and many of our poor Soldiers quite bear foot &amp; ill clad in other respects. I have the Honor to be with

the injury done to the college. Of this battle of Princeton it  
would be interesting to give almost in full Washington’s letter,  
written January 5, to the President of Congress. He writes,  
after telling of the fight at Assanpink bridge :  
  
Having by this time discovered that the enemy were greatly superior in  
number, and that their design was to surround us, I ordered all our bag-  
gage to be removed silently to Burlington soon after dark, and at twelve  
o&#x27;clock, after renewing our fires and leaving guards at the bridge in Tren-  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
THE BATTLE OF PRINCETON. 43  
ton and other passes on the same stream above, marched by a roundabout  
road to Princeton, where I knew they could not have much force left and  
might have stores. One thing I was certain of—that it would avoid the  
appearance of a retreat (which was of consequence, or to run the hazard  
of the whole army being cut off), whilst we might by a fortunate stroke  
withdraw General Howe from Trenton and give some reputation to our  
arms. Happily we succeeded. We found Princeton, about sunrise, with  
only three regiments and three troops of light horse in it, two of which  
were on their march to Trenton. ‘These three regiments, especially the  
two first, made a gallant resistance, and in killed, wounded, and prison-  
ers must have lost five hundred men ; upwards of one hundred of them  
were left dead on the field, and, with what I have with me and what were  
taken in the pursuit and carried across the Delaware, there are near three  
hundred prisoners, fourteen of whom are officers, all British.  
  
This piece of good fortune is counterbalanced by the loss of the brave  
and worthy General Mercer, Colonels Hazlet and Potter, Captain Neal,  
of the artillery ; Captain Fleming, who commanded the First Virginian  
Regiment, and four or five other valuable officers, who, with about twenty-  
five or thirty privates, were slain on the field. Our whole loss cannot be  
ascertained, as many who were in pursuit of the enemy (who were chased  
three or four miles) are not yet come in. The rear of the enemy&#x27;s army,  
lying at Maidenhead, not more than five or six miles from Princeton,  
was up with us before our pursuit was over, but as I had the precaution  
to destroy the bridge over Stony Brook, about half a mile from the field  
of action, they were so long retarded there as to give us time to move off  
in good order for this place.  
  
Of the destruction of this bridge we read elsewhere that Majo

We took two brass field-pieces, but for want of horses could not bring  
them away. We also took some blankets, shoes, and a few other trifling  
articles, burned the hay and destroyed such other things as the shortness  
of time would admit. My original plan, when I set out from Trenton,  
was to push on to Brunswick, but the harassed state of our troops, many  
of them having had no rest for two nights and a day, and the danger of

losing the advantage we had gained by aiming at too much induced me,  
by the advice of my officers, to relinquish the attempt; but, in my judg-  
ment, six or eight hundred fresh troops upon a forced march would have  
destroyed all their stores and magazines, taken (as we have since  
learned) their military chest, containing £70,000, and put an end to the  
war. The enemy, from the best intelligence I have been able to get,  
were so much alarmed at the apprehension of this that they marched im-  
mediately to Brunswick without halting, except at the bridges (for I also  
took up those on Millstone on the different routes to Brunswick), and got  
there before day.  
  
From the best information I have received, General Howe has left no  
men either at Trenton or Princeton. The truth of this I am endeavoring  
to ascertain that I may regulate my movements accordingly. The militia  
are taking spirits, and, I am told, are coming in fast from this State ;  
but I fear those from Philadelphia will scarcely submit to the hardships  
of a winter campaign much longer, especially as they very unluckily sent  
their blankets with their baggage to Burlington. I must do them the  
justice, however, to add that they have undergone more fatigue and hard-  
ship than I expected militia, especially citizens, would have done at this  
inclement season. I am just moving to Morristown, where I shall en-  
deavor to put them under the best cover I can. Hitherto we have been  
without any, and many of our poor soldiers quite barefoot, and ill-clad in  
other respects. I have the honor to be, ete.
