Washington February 25th 1815  
  
Peace having, happily, taken place, between the United States and Great Britain, it is desirable to guard against incidents, which, during periods of war in Europe, might tend to interrupt it: and, it is believed, in particular, that the navigation of American vessels exclusively by American Seamen, either natives, or such as are already naturalized, would not only conduce to the attainment of that object, but, also, to encrease the number of our Seamen, and, consequently, to render our Commerce and Navigation independent of the service of foreigners, who might be recalled by their Governments under circumstances the most inconvenient to the United States: I recommend the subject, therefore, to the consideration of Congress; and, in deciding upon it, I am persuaded, that they will sufficiently estimate the policy of manifesting to the world, a desire on all occasions, to cultivate harmony, with other nations by any reasonable accommodations, which do not impair the enjoyment of any of the essential rights of a free and independent people. The example on the part of the American Government will merit, and may be expected to receive, a reciprocal attention from all the friendly powers of Europe.

deace having happily taken place between  
the U. States and G. Britain, it is desirable to  
guard against accidents, which, during the  
periods of war in Europe, might tend to inter-  
rupt it : and it is believed, in particular, that  
the navigation of American vessels exclusive-  
ly by American seamen, either natives or such  
r &gt;2 are already naturalized, would not only  
conduce to the attainment of that object, but,  
also, to increase the number of our seamen,  
and, consequently to render our commerce and  
navigation independent of the service of  
foreigners, who might be recalled by their  
governments, under circumstances the most  
inconvenient tn the V. States I recommend  
the subject therefore to the consideration of  
Congress, and, in deciding upon it, I am  
presuaded, that they will sufficiently estimate  
the policy of manifesting to the world a  
desire, on all occasions, to cultivate harm &gt;ny  
with other nations, by any reasonable accom-  
modations, which do not impair the enjoyment  
of any of the essential rights ofa free and inde-  
pendent people The example on the part of  
the American government will merit, and may  
be expected to receive a reciprocal attention  
ftomrdl the friendly powers of Europe.

Peace haviag happily taken place between

able to guard against accidents; which during

the navigation of American vessels exclusively  
by American seamen, either natives or such as

to the attainment of that object, but alsqito in­
