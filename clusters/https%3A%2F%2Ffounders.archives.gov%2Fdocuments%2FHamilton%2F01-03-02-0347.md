 future happiness and respectability.  
The principles of all the arguments I have used or shall use, lie within the compass of a few simple propositions, which, to be assented to, need only to be stated.  
First, That no man can forfeit or be justly deprived, without his consent, of any right, to which as a member of the community he is entitled, but for some crime incurring the forfeiture.  
Secondly, That no man ought to be condemned unheard, or punished for supposed offences, without having an opportunity of making his defence.  
  
Vide Address of Congress to the people of Great Britain, September 5, 1774.  
  
  
  
Thirdly, That a crime is an act committed or omitted, in violation of a public law, either forbidding or commanding it.  
  
Blackstone, Vol. IV, page 5.  
  
  
Fourthly, That a prosecution is in its most precise signification, an inquiry or mode of ascertaining, whether a particular person has committed, or omitted such act.  
Fifthly, That duties and rights as applied to subjects are reciprocal; or in other words, that a man cannot be a citizen for the purpose of punishment, and not a citizen

Thus we have another example how easy it is for men to change their principles with their situations—to be zealous advocates for the rights of the citizens when they are invaded by others, and as soon as they have it in their power, to become the invaders themselves—to resist the encroachments of power, when it is the hands of others, and the moment they get it into their own to make bolder strides than those they have resisted. Are such men to be sanctified with the hallowed name of patriots? Are they not rather to be branded as men who make their passions, prejudices and interests the sole measure of their own and others rights?  
This history of mankind is too full of these melancholy instances of human contradiction.

, because this would be to fly in the face of the treaty, and appearances were to be preserved. This consideration was strengthened by another. The course of the law must have been dilatory. The elections were to be entered upon. It was deemed inexpedient, that the voice of the citizens at large (which must have been the case if the act of the legislature, in question, had been left to its natural course) should govern these elections. If the returning citizens were not at this juncture gratified, tumults were by some apprehended.  
This was a plausible step, and on that account the more dangerous. If we examine it with an unprejudiced eye, we must acknowledge not only that it was an evasion of the treaty, but a subversion of one great principle of social security, to wit, that every man shall be presumed innocent until he is proved guilty: This was to invert the order of things; and instead of obliging the state to prove the guilt, in order to inflict the penalty, it was to oblige the citizen to establish his own innocence, to avoid the penalty. It was to excite scruples in the honest and conscientious, and to hold out a bribe to perjury.  
That this was an evasion of the treaty, the fourth proposition already laid down will illustrate. It was a mode of inquiry who had committed any of those crimes to which the penalty of disqualification was annexed, with this aggravation, that it deprived the citizen of the benefit of that advantage which he would have enjoyed by leaving, as in all other cases, the burthen of the proof upon the prosecutor.  
To place this matter in a still clearer light, let it be supposed, that instead of the mode of indictment and trial by jury, the legislature was to declare that every citizen who did not swear he had never adhered to the King of Great-Britain, should incur all the penalties which our treason laws prescribe. Would this not be a palpable evasion of the treaty, and a direct infringement of the constitution? The principle is the same in both cases, with only this difference in the consequences; that in the instance already acted upon, the citizen forfeits a part of his rights,—in the one supposed he would forfeit the whole. The degree of punishment is all that distinguishes the cases. In either justly considered, it is substituting a new and arbitrary mode of prosecution to that antient and highly esteemed one, recognized by the laws and the constitution of the state; I mean the trial by jury.  
Let us not forget that the constitution declares that trial by jury in all cases in which it has been formerly used, should remain inviolate forever, and that the legislature should at no time, erect any new jurisdiction which should not proceed, according to the course of the common law. Nothing can be more repugnant to the true genius of the common law, than such an inquisition as has been mentioned into the consciences of men.  
A share in the sovereignty of the state, which is exercised by the citizens at large, in voting at elections is one of the most important rights of the subject, and in a republic ought to stand foremost in the estimation of the law. It is that right, by which we exist a free people; and it certainly therefore will never be admitted, that less ceremony ought to be used in divesting any citizen of that right, than in depriving him of his property. Such a doctrine would ill suit the principles of the revolution, which taught the inhabitants of this country to risk their lives and fortunes in asserting their liberty; or in other words, their right to a share in the government. That portion of the soverignty, to which each individual is entitled, can never be too highly prized. It is that for which we have fought and bled; and we should cautiously guard against any precedents, however they may be immediately directed against those we hate, which may in their consequences render our title to this great privilege, precarious. Here we may find the criterion to distinguish the genuine from the pretended whig. The man that would attack that right, in whatever shape, is an enemy to whiggism.  
If any oath, with retrospect to past conduct, were to be made the condition, on which individuals, who have resided within the British lines, should hold their estates; we should immediately see, that this proceeding would be tyrannical, and a violation of the treaty, and yet when the same mode is employed to divest that right, which ought to be deemed still more sacred, many of us are so infatuated as to overlook the mischief.  
To say that the persons, who will be affected by it, have previously forfeited that right, and that therefore nothing is taken away from them, is a begging of the question. How do we know who are the persons in this situation? If it be answered, this is the mode taken to ascertain it, the objection returns, ’tis an improper mode, because it puts the most essential interests of the citizen upon a worse footing, than we should be willing to tolerate where inferior interests were concerned; and because to elude the treaty it substitutes to the established and legal mode of investigating crimes, and inflicting forfeitures, on that is unknown to the constitution, and repugnant to the genius of our law.  
Much stress has been laid upon a couple of unmeaning words in the act, to enforce the penalties of which, the oath was invented. It is declared, that the persons, who have done the several things enumerated in the act, shall be ipso facto

ether he has really done the act. From this we perceive the words ipso facto are mere expletives, which add nothing to the force or efficacy of the law.  
It has been said too, that an oath to determine the qualifications of electors, is an usual precaution in free governments; but we may challenge those who make the assertion, to show that retrospective oaths have ever been administered, requiring electors to swear that they have not been guilty of past offences. In all the violence of party which has at different periods agitated Great Britain, nothing of this kind has ever been adopted; but even where religious fanaticism has given an edge to political opposition, and in an undecided contest for the crown, they have never gone further than to prescribe oaths for testing present dispositions towards the government on general principles, without retrospection to particular instances of past mal-conduc

It is remarkable, though not extraordinary, that those characters, throughout the states, who have been principally instrumental in the revolution, are the most opposed to persecuting measures.

duals, first impressions and early habits give a lasting bias to the temper and character. Our governments hitherto have no habits. How important to the happiness not of America alone, but of mankind, that they should acquire good ones.  
If we set out with justice, moderation, liberality, and a scrupulous regard to the constitution, the government will acquire a spirit and tone, productive of permanent blessings to the community. If on the contrary, the public councils are guided by humour, passion and prejudice; if from resentment to individuals, or a dread of partial inconveniences, the constitution is slighted or explained away, upon every frivolous pretext, the future spirit of government will be feeble, distracted and arbitrary.

 its eye upon America. The noble struggle we have made in the cause of liberty, has occasioned a kind of revolution in human sentiment. The influence of our example has penetrated the gloomy regions of despotism, and has pointed the way to inquiries, which may shake it to its deepest foundations. Men begin to ask every where, who is this tyrant, that dares to build his greatness on our misery and degradation? What commission has he to sacrifice millions to the wanton appetites of himself and the few minions that surround his throne?  
To ripen inquiry into action, it remains for us to justify the revolution by its fruits.  
If the consequences prove, that we really have asserted the cause of human happiness, what may not be expected from so illustrious an example? In a greater or less degree, the world will bless and imitate!  
But if experience, in this instance, verifies the lesson long taught by the enemies of liberty; that the bulk of mankind are not fit to govern themselves, that they must have a master, and were only made for the rein and the spur: We shall then see the final triumph of despotism over liberty. The advocates of the latter must acknowledge it to be an ignis fatuus, and abandon the pursuit. With the greatest advantages for promoting it, that ever a people had, we shall have betrayed the cause of human nature.

to inflict the penalty, it was to oblige the citizen to establish  
his own innocence to avoid the penalty. It was to excite  
scruples in the honest and conscientious, and to hold out a  
bribe to perjury... . It was a mode of inquiry who had  
committed any of those crimes to which the penalty of dis-  
qualification was annexed, with this aggravation, that it  
deprived the citizen of the benefit of that advantage, which  
he would have enjoyed by leaving, as in all other cases, the  
burden of the proof upon the prosecutor.  
  
“To place this matter in a still clearer light, let it be sup-  
posed that, instead of the mode of indictment and trial by  
jury, the legislature was to declare that every citizen who  
did not swear he had never adhered to the King of Great  
Britain should ineur all the penalties which our treason laws  
prescribe. Would this not be a palpable evasion of the  
treaty, and a direct infringement of the Constitution? The  
principle is the same in both cases, with only this difference  
in the consequences—that in the instance already acted upon  
the citizen forfeits a part of his rights; in the one supposed  
he would forfeit the whole. The degree of punishment is  
all that distinguishes the cases. In either, justly considered,  
it is substituting a new and arbitrary mode of prosecution  
to that ancient and highly esteemed one recognized by the  
laws aud constitution of the State. I mean the trial by  
jury.  
  
“Let us not forget that the Constitution declares that trial  
by jury, in all cases in which it has been formerly used,  
should remain inviolate forever, and that the legislature  
should at no time erect any vew jurisdiction which should  
not proceed according to the course of the common law.  
Nothing can be more repugnant to the true genius of the  
common law than such an inquisition as has been inentioned  
into the consvienees of men. . . . If any cath with retro-  
spect to past conduct were to be made the condition on  
which individuals, who have resided within the British lines,  
should hold their estates, we should immediately see that  
this proceeding would be tyrannical, and a violation of the  
treaty; and yet, when the same mode is employed to divest

of us are so infatuated as to overlook the micchief.  
  
“To say that the persons who will be affected by it have  
previously forfeited that right, and that, therefore, nothing  
is taken away from them, is a begging of the question. Tow  
do we know who are the persons in this situation? If it be  
answered, this is the mode taken to ascertain it—the objec-  
tion returns—’tis an improper mode; because it puts the  
most essential interests of the citizen upon a worse footing  
than we should be willing to tolerate where inferior interests  
were concerned; and because, to elude the treaty, it substi-  
tutes for the established and legal mode of investigating  
crimes and inflicting forfeitures, one that is unknown to the  
Constitution, and repugnant to the genius of our law.”

every citizen who did not swear that he  
had never adhered to the King of Great  
Britain should incur all the penalties which  
our treason laws prescribe : would this not  
bo a palpable ovasion of tho treaty and a  
direct infringement of the constitution ?  
Tho principle is the same in both cases,  
with only this difference in the conae  
quences, that in tho instance already acted  
upon the citizen forfeits a part JF his rights,  
in the one supposed he would forfeit the  
whole. The degree of punishment is all  
that distinguishes the cajas. In either,  
justly considered, it is substituting a new  
and arbitrary mode of prosecution, to that  
ancient and highly esteemed one recognized  
by the laws and the constitution of the  
State I mean the trial by jury.  
&quot;Let us not forget that the constitution  
declared that trial by jury in all cases in  
which it has been formerly used should re­  
main inviolate forever, and that the Legis­  
lature should at no time erect any new  
jurisdiction which should not proceed ac­  
cording to the course of the common law.  
Nothing can be more repugnant to the true  
genius of tha common law than such an  
inquisition as has been motioned into the  
consciences of men. If any oath  
with respect to past conduct had been made  
tho condition on which individuals who  
have resided within the British lines should  
hold their estates, we shou&#x27;d immediately  
see that this proceeding would be tyranni­  
cal and a violation of the treaty : nnd yet,  
when the same path is employed to divest  
that right which ought to be deemed still  
more sacred, many of us are so situated as to  
overlook the mischief.  
&quot;To say that the. person who will be  
affected by it have previously forfeited thek­  
right, and that thefere nothing is taken  
away from them, is a begging of the ques­  
tion. How do we know who are the par­  
ties in this situation? If it ho answered  
tlik k the mode taken to ascertain It, the  
objection returns, it ia an improper mode,  
because it puta the most essential interests  
of the citieen upon a worse footing than  
we should be willing to tolerate rhere in­  
ferior interests are concerned, and because,  
if allowed, it substitutes for the esrnblisJied  
and legal mode of investigating cr.mes and  
inflicting forfeitures one that is unknown  
to the constitution and repugn sot to the  
genius of law&quot;  
Similar views have frequently been ex­  
pressed by the judiciary incase involving  
analogous questions. They are presented  
with great force in the matter of Zoney, (7  
Porter,) but we do nofdeem itneteeaary to  
pursue the subject further. The judgment

He&#x27; says : &quot; Let us not forget that the  
Constitution declares that trial by jury,  
in all cases in which it has been formerly  
used, should remain inviolate forever;  
and that the Legislature should at no  
time, enact any new tribunal which  
should not proceed according to th  
course of the common law.  
&quot;Nothing can be more repugnant to  
the true genius of the common law than  
such an inquisition aa has been men  
tioned, into the consciences of men.  
&quot; A share in the sovereignty of the  
State which is exercised by the citizens  
at large, in voting at elections, is one of  
the most important rights of tbe subject,  
and in a republic, ought to stand fore­  
most in the estimation of the law. It is  
that right by which we exist as a free  
people, and it certainly, therefore, will  
never be admitted that less ceremony  
ought to be used in divesting any citUss  
of this right than in depriving him of his  
property. Such a doctrine would ill suit  
tbe principles of the revolution, which  
taught the inhabitants of this country to  
risk their lives and fortunes in asserting  
their liberty; or, in other words, their  
right to a share in the government  
Tbat portion of the sovereignty to which  
each individual is entitled can never be  
too highly prized. It is tbat for which  
we have fought and bled, and we should  
cautiously guard against any precedents,  
however they may be &#x27;directed against  
those we hate, which may, in their con­  
sequences, render oui title to this great  
privilege precarious. Here we may find  
the criterion to distinguish the genuine  
from the pretended Whig. The man that  
would attack that right, in whatever  
shape, is an enemy to Wbigism.
