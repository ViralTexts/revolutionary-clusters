Montpellier Ocr. 30. 1823  
  
I have recd. from Mr. Jefferson your letter to him, with the correspondence between Mr. Canning &amp; Mr. Rush, sent for his and my perusal, and our opinions on the subject of it.  
From the disclosures of Mr. Canning it appears, as was otherwise to be inferred, that the success of France agst. Spain would be followed by attempts of the Holy Alliance to reduce the revolutionized colonies of the latter to their former dependence.  
The professions we have made to these neighbours, our sympathy with their Liberties &amp; Independence, the deep interests we have in the most friendly relations with them, and the consequences threatened by a command of their resources by the great powers confederated agst. the Rights &amp; Reforms of which we have given so conspicuous &amp; persuasive an example, all unite in calling for our efforts to defeat the meditated crusade. It is particularly fortunate that the policy of G. Britain, tho’ guided by calculations different from ours, has presented a co-operation for an object the same with ours. With that co-operation we have nothing to fear from the rest of Europe; and with it the best reliance on success to our just &amp; laudable views. There ought not to be any backwardness therefore, I think, in meeting her in the way she has proposed; keeping in view of course the spirit &amp; form of the Constitution in every step taken in the road to war, which must be the last step, if those short of war should be without avail.  
It can not be doubted that Mr. Canning’s proposal tho’ made with the air of consultation as well as concert, was founded on a predetermination to take the course marked out, whatever might be the reception given here to his invitation. But this consideration ought not to divert us from what is just and proper in itself. Our co-operation is due to ourselves &amp; to the world: and whilst it must ensure success in the event of an appeal to force, it doubles the chance of success without that appeal. It is not improbable that G. B would like best to have the sole merit of being the Champion of her new friends, notwithstanding the greater difficulty to be encountered, but for the dilemma in which she would be placed. She must in that case either leave us as neutrals to extend our commerce &amp; navigation at the expence of hers, or make us Enemies by renewing her paper blockades, and other arbitrary proceedings on the Ocean. It may be hoped that such a dilemma will not be without a permanent tendency to check her proneness to unnecessary wars.  
Why the British Cabinet should have scrupled to arrest the calamity it now apprehends, by applying to the threats of France agst. Spain the “small effort” which it scruples not to employ in behalf of Spanish America, is  
  
best known to itself. It is difficult to find any other explanation than that interest in the one case has more weight in her casuistry than principle had in the other.  
Will it not be honorable to our country &amp; possibly not altogether in vain, to invite the British Govt. to extend the avowed disapprobation of the project agst. the Spanish colonies, to the enterprize of France agst. Spain herself; and even to join in some declaratory act in behalf of the Greeks? On the supposition that no form could be given to the Act clearing it of a pledge to follow it up by war, we ought to compare the good to be done, with the little injury to be apprehended to the U.S. shielded as their interests would be by the power &amp; the fleets of G. Britain united with their own. These are questions however wch. may require more information than I possess, and more reflection than I can now give them.  
What is the extent of Mr. Canning’s disclaimer as to “the remaining possessions of Spain in America?” Does it exclude future views of acquiring Porto Rico &amp;c. as well as Cuba? It leaves G. B free as I understand it, to in relation to Spanish possessions in other Quarters of the Globe.

OgT. 30, 1823.  
Dear Sir: I have just received from Mr.  
Jelferson your letter to him, with the corre­  
spondence between Mr. Canning and Mr. Rush,  
sent for his and miy berusal, and our opinions  
on the subject of it.  
From the disciosures of Mr. Canning it ap­  
pears, as was otherwise to be inferred, that the  
success of France axanst Spain would be fol­  
lowed by an attempt of the holy allies to re­  
duce the revolutionized colonies of the latter to  
their former dependence.  
Ihe professions we have made to these neigh­  
bors, our sympathies with their liberties and  
independence, the deep interest we have in the  
most friondly relations with thom, and the con­  
seduences threatened by a command of their  
resources by the great bowers, confederated  
against the rights and reforms of which wo  
have given so conspicuous and persuasive an  
example, all unite in cailing for our efforts to  
defeat the meditated crusado. It is particu­  
larly fortunate that the polley of Great Britain,  
though guided by calcmlations different from  
ours, has presented a cooperation for an object  
the same with ours. With that cooperation we  
have nothing to fear from the rest of Europe,  
and with it the best assurance of success to our  
laudable views. There ought not, therefore.  
to be any backwardness, I think, in meeting  
her in the way she has proposed; keeping in  
view, of course, the spirit and forms of the Con­  
stitution in every step taken in the road to  
war, which must be the last step if those short  
of war should be without avall.  
It cannot be doubted that Mr. Canning&#x27;s pro­  
posal, though made with the air of consultation  
as well as concert, was founded on a predeter­  
mination to take the course marked out, what­  
ever might be the reception given here to his  
invitation. But this consideration ought not  
to divert us from what is just and proper in  
itself. Our cooperation is due to ourselves and  
to the world, and while it must insure success  
in the event of an appeal to force, it doubles  
the chance of success without that appeal. It  
is not improbable that Great Britain wonld like  
best to have the merit of being the sole chamn­  
pion of her new friends, notwithatanding  
the greater difficulty to be encountered,  
but for the dilemma in which she  
would be blaced. She must, in that  
case, either leave us, as noutrals, to extend  
our commerce and navigation at the expense  
of hers, or make us enemies by renewing her  
paper blockades and other arbitrary proceed­

that the success of France against Spain

pendence.  
  
The professions we have made to these

ties’ and independence, the deep interest  
we have in the most friendly relations  
with them, and the consequences threat-  
ened by a command of their resources by  
the great powers confederated against the  
rights and reforms, of which we have given  
so conspicuous and persuasive an example,  
all unite in calling for our efforts to defeat  
the meditated crusade. It is particularly,  
fortunate the policy of Great Britain,  
though guided by calculations different  
from ours, has presented a co-operation  
for an object the same with ours. With  
that co-operation we have nothing to: faar  
from the rest of Europe, and with it the  
best assurance of success to our laudable

view, of course, the spirit and forms of the  
Constitution in every step taken in the  
road to war, which must be the last step  
if ge short of war should be without  
avail.  
  
It cannot be doubted that Mr. Canning’s ©  
proposal, though made with the air of con-  
sultation, as well as concert, was founded  
on a predetermination to take the course  
marked out, whatever might be the re-  
ception given here to his invitation. But  
this consideration ought not to divert ug  
from what is just and proper in itself.  
Our co-operation is due to ourselves and to  
the world; and while it must insure suc-  
cess, in the event of an appeal to force,  
it doubles the chance of success without

ma will not be without a permanent tend-  
ency to check her proneness to unneces-

Why the British Cabinet should have

Montpklieb, Oct. 30, 1823.  
Dear Sir: I have received from

There ought not to be any back­  
wardness, therefore, I think, in  
meetiner her in the way she has  
proposed; keeping in view, of&quot;  
course, the spirit and forms of the  
Constitution in everystep taken in  
the road to war which must be the  
last step, if those short of war  
should be without avail.  
It cannot be doubted that Mr.  
Canning&#x27;s proposal, tho&#x27; made with  
the air of consultation as well as  
concert, was founded on a predeter­  
mination to take the course marked

such a dilemma will not be without

the threats of France against  
Spain the &quot;small effort&quot; which it  
scruples not to employ on behalf of

ours, has presented a cooperation for an object the same with ours. With that  
cooperation we have nothing to fear from the rest of Europe ; and with it the&quot;  
best reliance on success to our just &amp; laudable views. There ought not to be  
any backwardness therefore, I think, in meeting her in the way she has proposed ;  
keeping in view of course the spirit &amp; form of the Constitution in every step  
taken in the road to Avar, Avhich must be the last step, if those short of Avar should --  
be Avithout avail.  
  
“ It cannot be doubted that M*&#x27;- Canning’s proposal tho’ made Avith the air  
of consultation as Avell as concert, was founded on a predetermination to take the  
course marked out, Avhatever might be the reception giA’en here to his invitation.  
But this consideration ought not to divert us from Avhat is just &amp; proper in  
itself. Our cooperation is due to ourselves and to the world: and whilst it must  
ensure success in the event of an appeal to force, it doubles the chance of success  
Avithout that appeal. It is not impossible that G.B. would like best to have  
the sole merit of being the champion of her new friends, notwithstanding the  
greater difficulty to be encountered, but for the dilemma in Avhich she would  
be placed. She must in that case either leave us as neutrals to extend our com¬  
merce &amp; navigation at the expense of hers, or make us Enemies by reiiCAving her

))aj»er blockades, and other arbitrary proceedings on the Ocean. It may be hoped  
that such a dilemma will not be without a permanent tendency to check her  
])ronenes8 to unnecessary wars.  
  
“ Why the British Cabinet should have scrupled to arrest the calamity it now  
ap]ireliends, by ai)plying to the threats of France ag&#x27;- Spain the ‘ small  
etl&#x27;oi t ’ which it scruples not to employ in behalf of Spanish America, is best  
known to itself. It is difficult to find any other explanation than that interest in  
the one case has more weight in her casuistry than principle had in the other.  
  
“ A\&#x27;ill it not be honorable to our country &amp; possibly not altogether in vain,  
to invite the British Gov*- to extend the avowed disapprobation of the project  
ag&quot;* the Spanish Colonies, to the enterprize of France ag**- Spain herself; and  
even to join in some declaratory act in behalf of the Greeks ? On the sup¬  
position that no form could be given to the act clearing it of a pledge to follow  
it up by war, we ought to compare the good to be done, with the little injury  
to be apprehended to the U.S. shielded as their interests would be by the  
)&gt;ower &amp; the iieets of G. Britain united with their own. These are questions  
however w&#x27;** may require more information than I possess, and more reflection  
than I can now give them.  
  
*• What is the extent of M*- Canning’s disclaimer as to the ‘ remaining posses¬  
sions of Spain in America ’ \ Does it exclude future views of acquiring Porto  
Hico &amp;c. as well as Cuba ? It leaves G.B. free as I understand it, in relation  
to Spanish possessions in other quarters of the globe.  
  
“ I return the correspondence of M&quot;&quot;- E. &amp; C. with assurances of the  
highest respect &amp; sincerest regard.
