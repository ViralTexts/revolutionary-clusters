Dear Child  
Philadelphia, February 22, 1756.  
I condole with you, we have lost a most dear and valuable relation, but it is the will of God and Nature that these mortal bodies be laid aside, when the soul is to enter into real life; ’tis rather an embrio state, a preparation for living; a man is not completely born until he be dead: Why then should we grieve that a new child is born among the immortals? A new member added to their happy society? We are spirits. That bodies should be lent us, while they can afford us pleasure, assist us in acquiring knowledge, or doing good to our fellow creatures, is a kind and benevolent act of God—when they become unfit for these purposes and afford us pain instead of pleasure—instead of an aid, become an incumbrance and answer none of the intentions for which they were given, it is equally kind and benevolent that a way is provided by which we may get rid of them. Death is that way. We ourselves prudently choose a partial death. In some cases a mangled painful limb, which cannot be restored, we willingly cut off. He who plucks out a tooth, parts with it freely since the pain goes with it, and he that quits the whole body, parts at once with all pains and possibilities of pains and diseases it was liable to, or capable of making him suffer.  
Our friend and we are invited abroad on a party of pleasure—that is to last for ever. His chair was first ready and he is gone before us. We could not all conveniently start together, and why should you and I be grieved at this, since we are soon to follow, and we know where to find him. Adieu.

dies should be lent to us while they  
can afford ns pleasure, assist us in-  
acquiring knowledge, or in doing  
good to our fellow creatures, is a

When they become unfit for their

Dear Curip:—I condole with you. We  
have lost a most dear and valuable relation, but  
it is the will of God and nature that these mor-  
tal bodies be laid aside when the soul is to en-  
ter into real life. Existence here on earth is  
hardly to be called life. °Tis rather an embryo  
state, a preparation to living—a man is not  
completely born until he is dead. Why, then,  
should we grieve that a new child is born  
among the immoitals—a new member added to  
their society.  
  
We are spirits. That bodies should be lent  
to us while they can afford us pleasure, assist us  
in acquiring knowledge, or in doing good to  
our fellow creatures, is a kind and benevolent  
actof God. When they become unfit for their  
purposes, and afford us pain instead of pleas-  
ure, instead of an aid become an incumbrance,  
and answer none of the intentions for which  
they were given, it is equally kind and benev-  
olent that a way is provided by which we may  
get rid of them. That way is Death.  
  
We, ourselves, prudently, in some cases,  
choose a partial death. A mangled, painful  
limb, which cannot be restored, we willingly  
cut off. He that plucks out a tooth parts with  
it freely, since the pain goes with it; and he  
that quits the whole body, parts with all the  
pains and possibility of pains and disease it  
was liable to, or capable of making him suffer.  
  
Our friend and we are invited abroad on a  
party of pleasure, that is to _ forever. His  
cuair* was first ready and has gone before us.  
We could not conveniently all start together ;

MISS E. HUBBARD.  
Dear Child: I condole with you. We have lost  
  
a most dear and valuable relation, but it is the will of  
  
God and nature that these mortal bodies be laid aside  
  
when the soul is to enter into real life. ‘Tis rather  
  
an embryo state—a preparation to living. A man is  
not completely born until he is dead. Why, then,  
should we grieve that a new child is born among the  
immortals, a new member added to their society ?  
We are spirits. That bodies should be lent to us  
while they can afford us pleasure, assist us in acquiring  
knowledge, or in doing good to our fellow-creatures,  
is a kind and benevolent act of God. When they

which they were given, it is equally kind and benevo-  
lent that a way is provided by which we may get rid

it was liable to or capable of making him suffer.  
  
Our friend and we are invited abroad on a party  
of pleasure that is to last forever. His chair was  
first ready, and he has gone before us. We could

you or I be grieved at this, since we are soon to fol-
