ost convenient for a representative legislature; nor is there any point on which the policy of the several states is more at variance; whether we compare their legislative assemblies directly with each other, or consider the proportions which they respectively bear to the number of their constituents. Passing over the difference between the smallest and largest states, as Delaware, whose most numerous branch consists of twenty-one representatives, and Massachusetts, where it amounts to between three and four hundred; a very considerable difference is observable among states nearly equal in population.

ht to be reversed. The truth is, that in all cases a certain number at least seems to be necessary to secure the benefits of free consultation and discussion, and to guard against too easy a combination for improper purposes: As on the other hand, the number ought at most to be kept within a certain limit, in order to avoid the confusion and intemperance of a multitude. In all very numerous assemblies, of whatever characters composed, passion never fails to wrest the sceptre from reason. Had every Athenian citizen been a Socrates, every Athenian assembly would still have been a mob.  
It is necessary also to recollect here the observations which were applied to the case of biennial elections. For the same reason that the limited powers of the congress and the control of the state legislatures, justify less frequent elections than the public safety might otherwise require; the members of the congress need be less numerous than if they possessed the whole power of legislation, and were under no other than the ordinary restraints of other legislative bodies.

Within three years a census is to be taken, when the number may be augmented to one for every thirty thousand inhabitants; and within every successive period of ten years, the census is to be renewed, and augmentations may continue to be made under the above limitation. It will not be thought an extravagant conjecture, that the first census will, at the rate of one for every thirty thousand, raise the number of representatives to at least one hundred. Estimating the negroes in the proportion of three-fifths, it can scarcely be doubted that the population of the United States will by that time,

The only means then which they can possess, will be in the dispensation of appointments. Is it here that suspicion rests her charge? Sometimes we are told that this fund of corruption is to be exhausted by the president in subduing the virtue of the senate. Now the fidelity of the other house is to be the victim. The improbability of such a mercenary and perfidious combination of the several members of government standing on as different foundations as republican principles will well admit, and at the same time accountable to the society over which they are placed, ought alone to quiet this apprehension.

The members of the congress are rendered ineligible to any civil offices that may be created or of which the emoluments may be increased, during the term of their election. No offices therefore can be dealt out to the existing members, but such as may become vacant by ordinary casualties; and to suppose that these would be sufficient to purchase the guardians of the people, selected by the people themselves, is to renounce every rule by which events ought to be calculated, and to substitute an indiscriminate and unbounded jealousy, with which all reasoning must be vain. The sincere friends of liberty who give themselves up to the extravagancies of this passion are not aware of the injury they do their own cause. As there is a degree of depravity in mankind which requires a certain degree of circumspection and distrust: So there are other qualities in human nature, which justify a certain portion of esteem and confidence. Republican government presupposes the existence of these qualities in a higher degree than any other form. Were the pictures which have been drawn by the political jealousy of some among us, faithful likenesses of the human character, the inference would be that there is not sufficient virtue among men for self-government; and that nothing less than the chains of despotism can restrain them from destro

friend General Hamilton presumed upon the same ground: ‘ as  
there is a degree of depravity in mankind,’ said this excellent man,  
‘which requires a certain degree of circumspection and distrust,  
so there are other qualities in human nature which justify a certain  
portion of esteem and confidence. Republican government pre-  
supposes the existence of those qualities in a higher degree than  
any other form.’ Five and thirty years have added largely to our  
experience since the Federalist was written ; this however is a pomt  
upon which further experience was not required. That there is  
in human nature some obscure remnant of original goodness, as  
well as an innate infirmity, we firmly believe, remembering m

tion is fixed by act of Congress as may be  
deemed expedient ”; when Alexander Hamil¬  
ton (in The Federalist, No. 65) said “&#x27;With¬  
in three years a census is to be taken when  
the number may be augmented (from 65) to  
one for every thirty thousand; and within  
every successive period of ten years the cen¬  
sus is to be renewed, and augmentations may  
be continued under the al&gt;ove limitation,” he  
meant that that was to be by the repeated,  
stated, and slow process of Congressional  
and State Legislative action on the Constitu¬  
tion itself; the statesmen who in 1788 fram¬  
ed the Constitution, three years later, by the  
act of Congress establishing the first ratio,  
ignorantly or deliberately violated the words  
which they had written; and from that day  
to this our whole federal history on this point  
has been unconstitutional, though it is too  
iate now to call it in question.

their election, there is no point on which  
the policy of the several States is more at  
variance, whether we compare the legisla-

or consider the proportions which they  
respectively bear to the number of their  
constituents. Passing over the difference  
between the smallest and largest states  
—as Delaware, whose most numerous  
branch consists of twenty-one represen-

amounts to between three and four hun-
