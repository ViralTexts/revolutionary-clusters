 am of opinion that it is absolutely necessary to give the State Courts concurrent jurisdiction with the district Courts in these penalties, or none will ever be prosecuted for. I think I am right in my conception of the State of this matter, but refer you to the parts of the two acts from whence it is formed: In the judiciary act Sec. 9, you will see that the district Courts are to have “exclusive original Cognizance of all Suits for penalties and forfeitures incurred under the Laws of the United States”: In the Census Act Sec. 6. the penalty for not rendering to an Assistant a true return is “twenty dollars to be sued for and recovered by such assistant, the one half for his own use, and the other half for the use of the United States.” In the small States it may be practicable to enforce these penalties, but in the large States, the matter will be considered i

this act, the court thinks that the proceedings on  
forfeitures accruing under it, may well be governed  
by the 9th section of the act to establish the judicial  
courts of the United States, which confers, on  
the district courts, jurisdiction of all seizores un-

section, taking the whole together, that nothing  
more is necessary to give jurisdiction in cases of  
this nature, than that the seizure should be within  
the district, without any regard to the place where  
  
the forfeiture accrued. It would, in many cases,  
  
be attended with much delay and injury, without  
any one advantage, were it necessary to send

against any association under this act may be had in any State court in which  
the association is located, having jurisdiction in similar cases.” This is an  
action of debt for a penalty, and in similar cases this Court has jurisdiction,  
and therefore it necessarily follows that the act intended to give jurisdiction in  
this particular case. It is true that the judiciary.act of 1789, section io, first  
statutes at large, page 77, declares that the District Courts of the United  
States have exclusive original cognizance of all suits for penalties and forfeit-

that various acts of Congress, since 1789, have in terms professed to give  
jurisdiction to State courts over actions brought to recover certain specified  
penalties, and therefore it cannot be successfully contended that the policy of  
Congress not to confer on State Courts jurisdiction over penalties is so clearly
