Whereas the Congress of the United States, by a joint resolution of the two Houses, have signified a request that a day may be recommended, to be observed by the people of the U. States with religious solemnity, as a day of Public Humiliation and Prayer; and whereas in times of public calamity, such as that of the war, brought on the U. States by the injustice of a foreign government, it is especially becoming, that the hearts of all should be touched with the same, and the eyes of all be turned to that Almighty Power, in whose hand are the welfare and the destiny of nations: I do, therefore, issue this my Proclamation, recommending to all, who shall be piously disposed to unite their hearts and voices in addressing, at one and the same time, their vows and adorations, to the great Parent and Sovereign of the Universe, that they assemble on the second Thursday of September next, in their respective religious congregations, to render him thanks for the many blessings he has bestowed on the people of the United States; that he has blessed them with a land capable of yielding all the necessaries and requisites of human life, with ample means for convenient exchanges with foreign countries; that he has blessed the labours employed in its cultivation and improvement; that he is now blessing the exertions to extend and establish the arts and manufactures, which will secure within ourselves supplies too important to remain dependent on the precarious policy, on the peac[e]able dispositions of other nations, and particularly that he has blessed the United States with a political constitution founded on the will and authority of the whole people, and guaranteeing to each individual the security, not only of his person and his property, but of those sacred rights of conscience, so essential to his present happiness, and so dear to his future hopes: that with those expressions of devout thankfulness be joined supplications to the same Almighty Power, that he would look down with compassion on our infirmities, that he would pardon our manifold tran[s]gressions, and awaken and strengthen in all the wholesome purposes of repentance and amendment; that in this season of trial and calamity, he would preside in a particular manner, over our public councils, and inspire all citizens with a love of their country, and with those fraternal affections and that mutual confidence, which have so happy a tendency to make us safe at home and respected abroad; and that, as he was graciously pleased, heretofore, to smile on our struggles against the attempts of the government of the empire, of which these states then made a part, to wrest from them the rights and privileges to which they were entitled in common with every other part, and to raise them to the station of an independent and sovereign people; so he would now be pleased, in like manner, to bestow his blessing on our arms in resisting the hostile and persevering efforts of the same power, to degrade us on the ocean, the common inheritance of all, from rights and immunities, belonging and essential to the American people, as a co-equal member of the great community of independent nations; and that, inspiring our enemies with moderation, with justice and with that spirit of reasonable accommodation, which our country has continued to manifest, we may be enabled to beat our swords into plough shares, and to enjoy in peace, every man, the fruits of his honest industry, and the rewards of his lawful enterprize.  
If the public homage of a people can ever be worthy the favorable regard of the Holy and Omniscient Being to whom it is addressed, it must be that, in which those who join in it are guided only by their free choice, by the impulse of their hearts and the dictates of their consciences; and such a spectacle must be interesting to all christian nations; as proving that religion, that gift of Heaven for the good of man, freed from all coercive edicts, from that unhallowed connexion with the powers of this world, which corrupts religion into an instrument or an usurper of the policy of the state, and, making no appeal but to reason, to the heart and to the conscience, can spread its benign influence every where, and can attract to the Divine Altar those free-will offerings of humble supplication, thanksgiving and praise, which alone can be acceptable to Him whom no hypocrisy can deceive, and no forced sacrifices propitiate.  
Upon these principles, and with these views, the good people of the U. States are invited, in conformity with the resolution aforesaid, to dedicate the day above named, to the religious solemnities therein recommended.  
Given at Washington, this twenty-third day of July in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and thirteen.

same, and the eyes of all be turned to that Al­  
mighty Powe . in whose hand are the welfare  
and the destiny of natiotis: 1 do therefore, is­  
sue my proclamation, recommending to all,  
who shall be piously disposed to unite their  
hearts and voices in addressing, at one and the  
same time, their vows and adorations, to the  
great Parent and Sovereign of the Universe,  
that they assemble on the second Thursday in  
September next, in their respective religious  
congregations, to render him thanks for the  
many blessings lie has bestowed on the people of  
the United Stales: that he has blsssed them  
with a Mud capable of yielding all the necessa­  
ries and requisites of human lite, with ample  
inonns for convenient exchanges with foreign  
countries; that he has blessed the labors rm­  
filoyed in its cultivation and improvement; that  
ic is now blessing the exertions to extend and  
establish the arts and manufactures, which  
will secure within ourselves supplies too impor­  
tant to remain dependent on the precarious po­  
licy, oil the peaceable dispositions of other na­  
tions, and particularly that he hat blessed the  
United States with apolitical constitution foun­  
ded on the will and authority of the whole peo­  
ple ami guaranteeing to cacti individual the  
security, not only of his person mid his pro­  
perly, but of those sacred rights of conscience,  
so essential to bift present happiness, and so  
dear to his future hopes :—that with those ex­  
pressions of devout thankfulness be joined  
supplications to the same Almighty Power,  
that lie would look down with compassion on  
our infirmities, that he would pardon onr mani­  
fold transgression*, and awaken and strengthen  
in a I the wholesome purposes of repentance U.  
amendment; that in tlus season of tiiaiandcs  
lumity, he would preside in a particular man­  
ner, over our public Councils, and inspire all  
Cituens with a love of their country, and with  
those fraternal a Heel ions and that mutual con­  
fidence, which have so happy a tendency to  
make us sale at home and respected abroad;  
and that, as he was graciously pleased, hereto­  
fore, to smile on our struggles against the at­  
tempts of tlie government of the empire, ol  
which these states then made a part, to wres*  
from them tba rights and privileges to which  
tlwy were entitled in common with every other  
part, audio raise them to tho station .of an in­  
dependent and sovereign people ; so he would  
now be pleased, in like manner, to bestow hi*  
olcts-ug on ^ur arms in resisting tbc hostile tv  
  
persevering efforts of the same power, to de­  
grade us on the ocean, the common inherit­  
ance ot all, from rights and immunities belong­  
uig and essential to the American people, as a  
co equal member ot the great community of  
independent nations; and that, inspiring our  
enemies with moderation, with justice 8c with  
that spirit ot seasonable accommodation, which  
our country has continued to manifest, we may  
be enabled to beat our swords into ptougli*  
shares, and to enjoy in peace, every man, the  
truits ot his honest industry, and the rewards  
of his lawful enterprise.  
If the public homage of a people can ever  
be worthy the favorable regard of the Holy  
and Omniscient Being to whom it is ad­  
dressed, it must be that, in which those who  
join in it arc guided only by their free choice  
by the impulse of their hearts aud the die*  
tatCH of their consciences; and such a spec­  
tacle must be interesting to all Christian na­  
tions ; as proving that religion, that gift of  
Heaven for the good of man, fieed from all  
coercive edicts, from that unhallowed con­  
nexion with the powers of this world, which  
corrupts religion into an instrument or an u­  
surper of the policy of the state, and, ma  
king no appeal but to reason, to the heart  
and to the conscience, can spread its benign  
influunce every where, and can attract to  
the Divine Altar those free will offerings of  
humble supplication, thanksgiving &amp; praise,  
which alone candle acceptable to Him whom  
no hypocrisy can deceive, aud no forced sa­  
crifices propitiate.  
Upon these principles, and with these  
views, the good people of the United States  
are invited, in conformity with the resoluti­  
on aforesaid, to dedicate the day above nam­  
HJ* to religious solemnities therein re­

is especially becoming that the hearts of all  
should be touched with the same, anc the  
cyes of all be turned to that Almighty Pow­  
er, in whose hand are the welfare and the  
destiny of nations : I do. therefore, issue this  
my Proclamation, recommending to all, who  
shall be piously disposed to unite their hearts  
and voices in addressing,at one and the same  
time, their vows and adorations, to the great  
Parent and Sovereign of the Universe : that  
they assemble on the second Thursday of  
September next in their respective religious  
congregations, to render him thanks for the  
many blessings he has bestowed on the peo­  
ple of the United States ; that he has blessed  
them with a land capable of yielding all the  
necessaries and requisites of human life, with  
ample means for convenient exchanges with  
foreign countries ; that he has blessed the  
labors employed in its cultivation and im­  
provement ; that he is now blessing the exer­  
tions to extend and establish the arts and  
manufactures, which will secure within. our­  
sclves supplies tor important to remdin de­  
pendgnt, on the precarious policy, on the  
peageable dispositions of other nations, and  
partioulavly that he has blassed the United  
xu‘og with &amp; political constitution founded on  
he will and aathority of the whole people,  
sud guargnteeing to each individual the secu­  
!&amp;y. not only of his person and his property,  
ut of those &#x27;sacred rights of conscience, so  
essontial to hig present happines, and so dear  
to his fdture hopes : that with those expres­  
sions of davout thankfulness bcgoined sup­  
lications to the same Almighty Power, that  
Kc would look down with compassion on our  
plirmities, that he wouid pardon our mani-  
  
POETRY.  
  
fuld transgressions, aad awaken and strength­  
en in all the wholesome purposes of repen­  
tance and amendment : that in this season of  
trial and calamity, he would preside in a par­  
ticular manner, over our public councils, and  
inspire all citizens with a love of their coun­  
try, and with those fraternal affections and  
that mutual confidence, which have so happy  
a tendency to make, us sale at home and re-  
  
spected abroad ; and that, as he was graci­  
ously pleased, heretofore, to smile on our  
struggles against the attempts of the govern­  
ment of the empire, of which these States  
then made a party; to wrest from them the  
rights and privileges in which they were en-  
  
titled in common with every other part, and  
to raise them to the station of an independent  
and sovereign pcople ; so he would now be  
pleased, in like manner, 10 bestow his bles­  
sings on our arms in resisting the hostile and  
persevering efforts of the same power, to de­  
grade us on the ocean, the common inheri­  
tance of all, from rights and immunities, be­  
longing and essential to the American peo­  
ple, as a co-equal member of the great com­  
munity of independent nations ; and that, in­  
spiring our enemies with moderation, with  
justice and with that spirit of reasonable ac­  
commodation, which our country has contin­  
ued to manifest, we may be enabled to beat  
our swords into plough shares, and to enjoy  
in peace, every man, the fruits of his honest  
industry, and the rewards of his lawful en­  
terprize.  
If the public homage of a people can ever  
be worthy the favorable regard of the Holy  
and Omniscient Being to whom it is addres­  
sed, it must be that, in which those who  
joined in it are guided only by their free  
choice, by the impulse of their hearts and  
the dictates of their consciences ; and such a  
spectacle must be interesting to.all christian  
nations ; as providing that religion, the gift  
of Heaven for the good of man, freed from  
all coercive edicts, from that unhallowed con­  
nexion with the powers of this world, which  
corrupts religion into an instrument or an u­  
surper of the policy of the state, and making  
no appeal but to reason, to the heart and to  
the conscience, can spread its bevign influ­  
ence every where and can attract to the Di­  
vine Alter those frec-will offerings of hum­  
ble supplication, thanksgiving and praise  
which alone can be acceptable to Him whom  
no hypocricy can deceive, and no forced sac­  
rifices propitiate.  
Upon these principles, and with these  
views, the good people of the United States  
are invited, in conformitg with the resolution  
aforesaid, to dedicate the day above named,to  
the religious solemnities therein recommen­  
ded.  
  
Given at Washington, this twenty-thitd  
day of July in the year of our Lord one  
thousand eight hundred and thirteen.

Yes, in the very proclamation of the Pre­  
sident, this war is called, though not in

while at the same time it is denounced

on the LTitfcd States by the injustice of  
a foreign government, it is especially be­

becoming, that the hearts of all should

dividual security, not only of his  
person and his property, but of those  
sacred rights of conscience, £O CSSCll-

those expressions of devout thankful.  
ness be joined supplications to the  
same Almighty Power, that he would  
look down with compassion on our  
infirmities, that he would pardon our  
manifold transgressions, and awaken  
and strengthen in all the wholesome  
purposes of repentance and amend-  
ment ; that in this season of trial and  
calamity, he would preside in a par-  
ticular manner over our public coun-  
cils, and inspire all citizens with a  
love of their country, and with those  
fraternal affections, and that mutual  
confidence, which have so happy a  
tendency to make us safe at home  
and respected abroad; and that, as  
he was graciously pleased, heretofore,  
to smile on our struggles against the  
attempts of the government of the  
empire of which these states then  
made a part, to wrest from them the  
rights and privileges to which they  
were entitled in common with every  
other part, and to raise them to the  
station of an independent and sove-  
reign people ; so he would now be  
pleased, in like manner, to bestow  
his blessing On our arms in resisting  
the hostile and persevering efforts of  
the same power to degrade us on the  
ocean, the common inheritance of all,  
from rights and immunities, belong-  
ing and essential to the American  
people, as a co-equal member of the  
great community of independent na-  
tions ; and that, inspiring our ene-  
mies with moderation, with justice,  
and with that spirit of reasonable ac-  
commodation, which our country has  
continued to manifest, we may be  
enabled to beat our swords into  
ploughshares, and to enjoy in peace,  
every man,the fruits of his honest indus-  
try and the rewards of his lawful enter-  
prise. If the public homage of a peo-  
ple can ever be worthy the favoura-  
ble regard of the holy and omniscient  
Being to whom it is addressed, it  
must be that in which those who  
join in it are guided only by their  
free choice, by the impulse of their  
hearts and the dictates of their con-  
sciences, and such a spectacle must  
be interesting to all Christian nations;

heaven for the good of man, freed  
from all coercive edicts, from that  
unhallowed connexion with the pow-

Upon these principles, and with

United States are invited, in confor-

dedicate the day above-named to the
