A favourable opportunity offering by Mr. Austin of writing to you, I embrace it, in compliance to your pappa’s request as well as my own inclination.  
The uncertainty of a conveyance to you has prevented many of your Friends from writing to you, and when an opportunity has offerd the fear of a miscarrage has obliged them to say little else than what regards the State of their Health and the place of their abode.  
But having taken the pen I am determined to write freely regardless of consequences.  
When you left your Native land it was in a state little able to defend itself against the force which had invaded it, but providence remarkably smild upon our virtuous exertions in defence of our injured and oppressed land, and has opened resources for us beyond our most sanguine expectations, so that we have been able not only to repel, but conquer, the Regular Troops of Britain, the Mercinaries of Germany, the Savages of the wilderness and the still more cruel paricides of America with one of the most celebrated British Generals at their head.  
I have the pleasure Sir to inform you that the British arms have submitted to American fortitude, courage and bravery, and have received terms tho humiliating to them the most generous ever granted to an Enemy cruel and inhumane as these have been.  
But true courage is always humane, and we submit the punishment of their crimes to that Being who has stiled himself the Husband of the widow, the Father of the orphan and the avenger of the oppressed. Cruel have been the depredations of these foes of the rights of Humane Nature. Our Commerce has been distroyed, our cities burnt with fire, our Houses plunderd, our women a sacrifice to brutal Lust, our children murderd, and the hoary head of age has oftentimes glutted their savage malice.  
These Sir are indisputable facts and will I hope be recorded by the faithfull Historyan to the everlasting infamy and disgrace of Britain, and would almost tempt one to immitate the parent of Hannible and swear the rising generation to Eternal Enmity against them.—But as christians tho we abhor the deeds we wish them reformation and repentance.  
We most sincerely wish for peace upon honorable terms. Heaven is our witness that we rejoice not in the Effusion of Blood, nor the Carnage of the Humane Speicies but having forced us to draw the Sword we are determined never to sheathe it the Slaves of Britains—and whether it is creditted or not tis a truth for which we have great reason to be thankfull, we are at this day in a much better situation to continue the war for 6 years to come, than we were to contend for 6 months in the commencment of it. We have defended ourselves against a force which would have shaken any kingdom in Europe without becomeing tributary to any power whatever, and I trust we shall continue too, with the blessing of heaven.  
Providence has permitted for wise ends that every one of the united States should feel the cruel depredations of the Enemy, that each one should be able to sympathize with the other—and this so far from weakening has served to strengthen our bond of union. Tis a thirteenfold cord which all the Efforts of our Enemies have not been able to break.  
The perticuliars of the Capture of General Burgoyne and his whole Army will be transmitted you by other hands. I hope soon to congratulate you upon a similar account from the Southard, but whether I am can or not you may rely upon it that the invincible american Spirit is as far from being conquerd as it was the day the cruel mandates were issued against her. She gathers strength by oppression and grows firmer by resistance. Tis the cause of truth and justice and will finally prevail tho the combined force of Earth and hell rise against it.  
To this Cause I have sacrificed much of my own personal happiness by giving up to the counsels of America one of my dearest connexions and living for more than 3 years in a State of widowhood.  
A return to your native land with a heart and mind truly american would rejoice all your connexions perticuliarly your Friend and former Correspondent,

October 30, 1777.  
  
Dear Sir,  
  
FAVOURABLE opportunity  
  
offering by Mr. Austin of writ-  
ing to you, in compliance with the  
request of your papa, as well as my  
own inclinations, I embrace it. There  
have been but few opportunities of  
conveyance either to or from you, and  
the uncertainty whether a letter would  
reach you has been the occasion that  
little else has been wrote than the  
place of one’s abode and their state of  
health.  
  
But whether this meets with the  
fate of some others or not, I am de-  
termined to congratulate you upon  
our present situation. When you left  
your native land, it was in a state little  
able to defend itself, to all human  
appearance, against the force which  
had invaded it: but Providence has  
remarkably smiled upon our virtuous  
exertions in defence of our injured  
and oppressed land, and has opened  
resources for us beyond our most san-  
guine expectations; so that we have  
been able not only to repel, but con-  
ag the regular troops of Britain,  
the mercenaries of Germany, the sa-  
vages of the Wilderness, and the still  
more cruel parricides of America, with  
one of the most celebrated British  
generals, Burgoyne, at their head.  
  
I have the pleasure to inform you,  
Sir, that the British arms have sub-  
mitted to American fortitude, courage  
and bravery, and have received terms,  
though humiliating to them, the most  
generous ever granted to an enemy.  
Their deserts they never can receive  
in this world, nor we inflict, but must  
submit them to that Being who will  
equally distribute both rewards and  
punishments, and who hath assured us  
that he will espouse the cause of the  
widow, the futherless and the op-  
pressed.  
  
Cruel have been the depredations of

these foes of the rights of human na-  
ture: our commerce has been destroy.  
ed, our cities burnt, our houses plun-  
dered, our women sacrificed to brutal  
lust, our children murdered, and even  
the hoary head of age has oftentimes  
glutted their savage malice. hese  
are indisputable facts, and will, |  
hope, be recorded by the faithful his-  
torian, to the everlasting infamy and

us to imitate the example of the parent  
of Hannibal, and swear the rising gene-  
ration to eternal enmity against them.  
But as Christians, though we abhor  
their deeds, we wish them reformation  
and repentance. We most sincerely  
wish for peace upon honourable terms.  
Heaven is our witness that we do not  
rejoice in the effusion of blood, or  
the carnage of the human species; but  
having forced us to draw the sword,  
we are determined never to sheath it  
the slaves of Britons ; and whether it  
is credited or not, it is a truth for  
which we have great reason to be  
thankful, that we are at this day ina  
much better situation to continue the  
war for six years to come, than we  
were to contend for six months in the  
commencement of it. We have de-  
fended ourselves hitherto against a  
force which would have shaken any  
kingdom in Europe, without becom-  
ing tributary to any power whatever,  
and trust we shall continue to, with  
the blessing of Heaven.  
Providence has permitted for wise  
ends, that every one of the United  
States should feel the cruel depreda-  
tions of the enemy; that each one  
should be able to sympathize with the

all the efforts of our enemies have not

the capture of General Burgoyne and  
his whole army I leave to be transmit-

may be able to congratulate you upon @  
similar account from the Southward ;  
but whether I am or not, as the events  
of war are uncertain, you may rely  
upon it that the invincible Amencan  
spirit is as far from being conque  
as it was the day the cruel mandates  
were issued against her. Our cause,  
Sir, is, I trust, the cause of truth an  
justice, and will fipally prevail, though

To this cause I have sacrificed much  
of my own personal happiness, by giv-  
ing up to the councils of America  
one of my nearest connexions, and  
living for more than three years in a  
state of widowhood. I hope before  
long you will be able to return to  
your native land with a heart truly  
American ; as such, no one will rejoice  
more to see you than your affectionate
