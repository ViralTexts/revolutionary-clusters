A plan for the establishment of an University in the federal City, has frequently been the subject of conversation; but in what manner it is proposed to commence this important institution; on how extensive a scale—the means by which it is to be effected; how it is to be supported; or what progress is made in it; are matters altogether unknown to me.  
It has always been a source of serious reflection &amp; sincere regret with me, that the youth of the United States should be sent to foreign countries for the purpose of education.

For this reason, I have greatly wished to see a plan adopted by which the arts, Sciences &amp; Belles letters, could be taught in their fullest extent; thereby embracing all the advantages of European tuition with the means of acquiring the liberal knowledge which is necessary to qualify our citizens for the exigencies of public, as well as private life; and (which with me, is a consideration of great magnitude) by assembling the youth from the

GenTLEMEN—A plan for the establishment of a university in the Federal City  
has frequently been the subject of conversation; but, in what manner it is pro-  
posed to*commence this important institution, on how extensive a scale, the  
means by which it is to be effected, how it is to be supported, or what progress  
is made in it, are matters altogether unknown to me.  
  
It has always been a source of serious reflection and sincere regret with me,  
that the youth of the United States should be sent to foreign countries for the  
purpose of education. Although there are doubtless many, under these circum-  
stances, who escape the danger of contracting principles unfavorable to repub-  
lican government, yet we ought to deprecate the hazard attending ardent and  
susceptible minds, from being tco strongly and too early prepossessed in favor  
of other political systems, before they are capable of appreciating their own.  
  
For this reason I have greatly wished to see a plan adopted, by which the  
arts, sciences, and belles-lettres could be taught in their fullest extent, thereby  
embracing all the advantages of European tuition, with the means of acquiring  
the liberal knowledge, which is necessary to qualify our citizens for the exigen-  
cies of public as well as private life; and (which with me is a consideration of  
great magnitude) by assembling the youth from the different parts of this rising  
republic, contributing from their intercourse and interchange of information to  
the removal of prejudices, which might perhaps sometimes arise from local  
circumstances.  
  
The Federal City, from its centrality and the advantages which in other  
respects it must have over any other place in the United States, ought to be  
preferred, as a proper site for such a university. And if a plan can be adopted  
upon a scale as extensive as I have described, and the execution of it should  
commence under favorable auspices in a reasonable time, with a fair prospect  
of success, I will grant in perpetuity fifty shares in the navigation of the Poto-  
mac River towards the endowment of it.  
  
What annuity will arise from these fifty shares, when the navigation is in full  
operation, can at this time be only conjectured; and those, who are acquainted  
with it, can form as good a judgment as myself.  
  
As the design of this university has assumed no form with which I am  
acquainted, and as I am equally ignorant who the persons are, who have taken  
or are disposed to take the maturing of the plan upon themselves, I have been  
at a loss to whom I should make this communication of my intentions. If the  
Commissioners of the Federal City have any particular agency in bringing the  
matter forward, then the information, which I now give to them, is in its proper  
course. If, on the other hand, they have no more to do in it than others, who  
may be desirous of seeing so important a measure carried into effect, they will  
be so good as to excuse my using them as the medium for disclosing these my  
intentions; because it appears necessary, that the funds for the establishment  
and support of the institution should be known to the promoters of it; and I  
see no mode more eligible for announcing my purpose.

“ GENTLEMEN, — A plan for the establishment  
of a university in the Federal City has frequently  
been the subject of conversation, but in what man-  
ner it is proposed to commence this important  
institution, or on how extensive a scale, the means  
by which it is to be effected, how it is to be sup-

altogether unknown to me. It has always been a  
source of serious reflection and sincere regret with  
me that the youth of the United States should be  
sent to foreign countries for the purpose of educa-  
tion. Although there are many who escape the  
danger of contracting principles unfavorable to  
republican governments, yet we ought to depre-  
cate the hazard attending ardent and susceptible  
minds from being too strongly and too early preju-  
diced in favor of other political systems, before  
they are capable of appreciating their own. For  
this reason I have greatly wished to see a plan  
adopted by which the arts, sciences, and belles-  
lettres could be taught in their fullest extent,  
thereby embracing all the advantages of European  
tuition, with the means of acquiring the liberal  
knowledge which is necessary to qualify our citi-  
zens for the exigencies of public as well as private

great magnitude) by assembling the youth from

conjectured; and those who are acquainted with  
it can form as good a judgment as myself. As

the design of this university has assumed no form  
with which I am acquainted, and as I am equally  
ignorant who the persons are, who have taken or  
are disposed to take the maturing of the plan upon  
themselves, I have been at loss to whom I should  
make this communication of my intentions. If the

Edmund Pendleton.  
  
WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 28.  
  
At Philadelphia: “A plan for the establishment of a  
university in the Federal city has frequently been the sub-  
ject of conversation; but, in what manner it is proposed to  
commence this important institution, on how extensive a  
scale, the means by which it is to be affected, how it is to  
be supported, or what progress is made in it, are matters  
altogether unknown to me.”— Washington to the Commis-  
sioners of the Federal District.  
  
In continuing this letter, Washington wrote, ‘‘It has always been a  
source of serious reflection and sincere regret with me, that the youth of  
the United States, should be sent to foreign countries for the purpose of
