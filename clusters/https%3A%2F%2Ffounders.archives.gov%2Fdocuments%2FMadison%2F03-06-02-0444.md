War Department July 25th. 1813.  
The time, at which we have reason to expect an ascendancy on Lake Ontario, has arrived. If our hopes on that head be fulfilled, though but for a short period, we must avail ourselves of the circumstances, to give to the Campaign, a new &amp; increased activity.  
For this purpose, our forces on the Ontario should be concentrated, because neither Section of them, as they are now divided, is competent to any great object.  
The point of concentration is more doubtful.  
1st. If at fort George, our utmost success can but give us the command of the peninsula, which if General Harrison succeed against Malden, will be of diminished interest both to us &amp; to the Enemy: to us, because Malden will more completely cover our Western frontier &amp; controul the Savages, than forts George &amp; Erie: to the Enemy, because, Malden lost, our inroad upon the peninsula will but have the effect of shortening, not of dividing, the Enemy’s line of operations. In a word, success at this point will not give to the Campaign a character of decisive advantage.  
2nd. If on the other hand, we make Sackett’s-harbour our point of concentration, Kingston may become the object of our attack, which by the way will but be returning to the original plan of Campaign prescribed to General Dearborn. This place is of much importance to the Enemy, &amp; will no doubt be defended by him with great obstinacy, &amp; with all the resources which can be safely drawn from other points. That it may be carried by a joint application of our naval and Military means is not however to be questioned. The inclosed diagram will shew the number &amp; character of the Enemy’s defenses. His batteries on No 1 cannot be sustained but by his fleet. These carried, he is open to a descent at No. 2 &amp; 3. If he divide his force between both—we oppose one half of his strength with the whole of ours. If he concentrate at No 2. we seize No. 3 &amp; command both the town &amp; Shipping. If he concentrate at No. 3. we will occupy No 2, &amp; with nearly the same results.  
Cotemporary with this movement, another may be made on the side of Lake Champlain, indicating an intention of attacking Montreal &amp; it’s dependencies &amp; really attacking them, if to save Kingston, these posts have been materially weakened.  
3d. Another, &amp; different operation, to which our means are Competent, would be a movement from Sackett’s-harbour to Madrid on the St. Lawrence. At this place the River may be most easily crossed. The ground opposite to it is a narrow bluff, skirted by the River on one side, &amp; a Swamp of great extent &amp; of difficult passage on the other. This gained &amp; fortified, our fleet continuing to command the water line from the head of the river to Ogdensburg, &amp; Lake St. Francis occupied with a few gun boats &amp; barges—the Army may march on to Montreal in concert with General Hampton. The only natural difficulty to the execution of this plan would be presented by a branch of the grand River which must be crossed—but at this season, tho deep, it is believed to be fordable

The time at which we have reason to ext  
pect an ascendancy on l^ake Ontario, has ar-  
rive&lt;l. If our h&lt;^s on that head be fullilled,  
Uiough but for a short period, we must avail  
ourselves of the circumstance, to give to the  
campaign a new and increasing activity.  
  
For this purpose, our forces on the Ontario,  
should be concentrated, because neither sec¬  
tion of them, as they are now dlvide&lt;l, is com*-  
petent to any great object.

The point of com entration is more doubtful.  
  
1st. If at Fort George, our utmost success  
can but give us the command ot the peninsula,  
which, if General&#x27;Harrison succeeds against  
Malden, will be of diminished interest, both  
to ’US and to tlie enemy; to us, because Mal¬  
den will more completely cover our western  
frontier, and control the savages, than Forts  
George and Eirie; to the enemy, because Mal¬  
den lost, our inroad upon the peninsula, will  
have the effect of shortening, not of dividing  
the enemy’s line of operations; in a word, suc¬  
cess at this point, will not give to the cam¬  
paign a character of decisive advantage.  
  
2&lt;1. If, on the other hand, we make Socket’s  
Harbour the point of concentration, Kingston  
may become the object of our attack, wdiich,  
by the way, will but be returning to the origi¬  
nal plan of the campaign, prescril)€d to Gene¬  
ral Dearborn. This place is of much impor¬  
tance to the enemy, and will no doubt be de¬  
fended by him with great obstinacy, and with  
all the resources which can be safely drawn  
from other points. That it may be taken by  
a joint application of our naval and military  
means, is not, however, to be questioned. The  
enclosed diagram, will show the number and  
character of the enemy’s defences. His bat¬  
teries on No. 1, cannot be sustained but by his  
fleet. These carried, he is open to a descent  
at Nos. 2 and 3. If he divides his force between  
both, we oppose one half of his strength with  
the whole of ours. If he concentrates at No.  
  
2, w&#x27;e seize No. 3, and command both the town  
and the shipping. If lie concentrates at No.  
  
3, we occupy No. 2, and with nearly the same  
results.  
  
Contemporary with this movement, another  
may be made on the side of Lake Champlain;  
indicating an intention of attacking Montreal  
and its depend/encies, and really attacking  
them, if to save Kingston, these posts have  
been materially weakened.  
  
2d. Another and diflerent operation, to  
which our means are competent, would be a  
movement from Sacket’s Harbour to Madrid,  
on the St. Lawrence. Here the river may  
be most easily crossed. The ground opposite  
to it is a narrow bluff, skirted by the river on  
one side, and a swamp of great extent, and of  
difficult passage on the other. This gained  
and fortified, our fleet continuing tO/Command  
the water line from the head of the river to  
Ogdensburg, ami Lake St. Francis occupied  
with a few gun boats and barges, the army  
may march against Montreal, in concert with  
General Hampton. The only natural difficulty  
to the execution of this pl^, would be pre¬  
sented by a branch of the (rrand River which  
must be crossed; but at this season, though  
deep. It is believed to be fordable
