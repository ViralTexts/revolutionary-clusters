ime too is the present, before the admission of the Western states. I am very differently affected towards the new plan of opening our land office by dividing the lands among the states and selling them at vendue. It separates still more the interest of the states which ought to be made joint in every possible instance in order to cultivate the idea of our being one nation, and to multiply the instances in which the people shall look up to Congress as their head. And when the states get their portions they will either fool them away, or make a job of it to serve individuals. Proofs of both of th

My reason is that I fear the terms in which I speak of slavery and of our constitution may produce an irritation which will revolt the minds of our countrymen against reformation in these two articles, and thus do more harm than good.

he United States. I thank you for your attention to my outfit for the articles of household furniture, clothes and a carriage. I have already paid twenty eight thousand livres and have still more to pay. For the greatest part of this I have been obliged to anticipate my salary from which however I shall never be able to repay it. I find that by a rigid economy bordering however on meanness I can save perhaps five hundred livres a month in the summer at least. The residue goes for expences so much of course and of necessity that I cannot avoid them without abandoning all respect to my public character. Yet I will pray you to touch this string which I know to be a tender one with Congress with the utmost delicacy. I had rather be ruined in my fortune than in their esteem. If they allow me half a year’s salary as an outfit I can get thro my debts in time. If they raise the salary to what it was or even pay our house rent and taxes I can live with more decency

I sincerely wish you may find it convenient to come here. The pleasure of the trip will be less than you expect but the utility greater. It will make you adore your own country, it’s soil, it’s climate, it’s equality, liberty, laws, people and manners. My god! How little do my countrymen know what precious blessings they are in possession of, and which no other people on earth enjoy. I confess I had no idea of it myself. While we shall see multiplied instances of Europeans going to live in America, I will venture to say no man now living will ever see an instance of an American removing to settle in Europe and continuing there. Come then and see the proofs of this, and on your return add your testimony to that of every thinking American, in order to satisfy our countrymen how much it is their interest to preserve uninfected by contagion those peculiarities in their government and manners to which they are indebted for these blessings.

admiration could not have been a novelty, as  
Mr. Lodge points out; nor, on the other  
hand, is it just to say that Mr. Jefferson was  
dominated by feelings and ideas gathered by  
him in France. He would always, as Mr.  
Morse says, have been a democrat, if he had  
never sailed out of sight of American shores;

time in France, he told Monroe to come there

country, its soil, its climate, its equality, lib-

economy, bordering on meanness, 1 ran  
save perhaps tive hundred livres a month,  
at least in the summer. The residue goes  
for expenses so much of course and ne­

abandoning all respect to my public  
character. Vet 1 will pray you to touch  
this string, which I know u&gt; be a tender  
one with congress, with the utmost deli­  
cacy. I had rather be ruined in my for­  
tune than m their esteem. If they allow  
me half a year&#x27;s salary as an outfit. I can  
get through my debts in time. If they  
raise the salary to what it was. or even  
pay our house rent and taxes. I can live  
with more decency.

which it is not necessary to dissent. During  
the days of his diplomatic service abroad,  
writing to James Monroe, he says:  
  
**T sincerely wish that you may find it convenient  
to come here; the pleasure of the trip will be less  
than you expect, but the utility greater. It will make  
you adore your own country, its soil, its climate, its

It was about the time that Barlow was  
persuading the Frenchmen to come to  
America that Jefferson wrote from Paris  
to Monroe urging him to come to Paris,  
for ‘‘ it will make you adore your own  
country, its soil, its climate, its equality,
