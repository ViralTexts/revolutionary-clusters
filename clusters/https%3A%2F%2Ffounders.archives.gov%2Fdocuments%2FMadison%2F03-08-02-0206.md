Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives.  
Washington September 20th 1814  
  
Notwithstanding the early day which had been fixed for your session of the present year, I was induced to call you together, still sooner, as well that any inadequacy in the existing provisions for the wants of the Treasury might be supplied, as that no delay might happen in providing for the result of the negociations on foot with Great Britain; whether it should require arrangements adapted to a return of peace, or further and more effective provisions for prosecuting the war.  
That result is not yet known. If, on one hand, the repeal of the orders in Council, and the general pacification in Europe, which withdrew the  
  
occasion on which impressments from American vessels were practised, suggest expectations that peace and amity may be re-established; we are compelled, on the other hand, by the refusal of the British Government to accept the offered mediation of the Emperor of Russia, by the delays in giving effect to its own proposal of a direct negociation; and above all, by the principles and manner in which the war is now avowedly carried on; to infer that a spirit of hostility is indulged, more violent than ever, against the rights and prosperity of this Country.  
This increased violence, is best explained by the two important circumstances, that the great contest in Europe, for an Equilibrium guaranteeing all its states against the ambition of any, has been closed without any check on the overbearing power of Great Britain on the ocean; and that it has left in her hands disposeable armaments, with which, forgetting the difficulties of a remote war against a free people, and yielding to the intoxication of success, with the example of a great victim to it before her eyes, she cherishes hopes of still further aggrandizing a power already formidable, in its abuses, to the tranquility of the civilized and commercial world.  
But whatever may have inspired the Enemy with these more violent purposes, the public councils of a nation, more able to maintain than it was to acquire its Independence, and with a devotion to it, rendered more ardent by the experience of its blessings, can never deliberate but on the means most effectual for defeating the extravagant views or unwarrantable passions, with which alone the war can now be pursued against us.  
In the events of the present Campaign, the Enemy, with all his augmented means, and wanton use of them, has little ground for exultation unless he can feel it in the success of his recent enterprizes against this Metropolis, and the neighbouring Town of Alexandria; from both of which his retreats were as precipitate, as his attempts were bold and fortunate. In his other incursions on our Atlantic frontier, his progress, often checked and chastised, by the martial spirit of the neighbouring Citizens, has had more effect in distressing individuals, and in dishonoring his arms, than in promoting any object of legitimate warfare. And in the two instances mentioned, however deeply to be regretted on our part, he will find in his transient success, which interrupted for a moment only the ordinary public business at the seat of Government, no compensation for the loss of character with the world, by his violations of private property, and by his distruction of public Edifices, protected as monuments of the arts, by the laws of civilized warfare.  
On our side, we can appeal to a series of achievements, which have given new lustre to the American arms. Besides the brilliant incidents in the minor operations of the campaign, the splendid victories gained on the Canadian side of the Niagara, by the American forces under Major General Brown, and Brigadiers Scott and Gaines, have gained for these Heroes, and their  
  
emulating companions, the most unfading laurels; and having triumphantly tested the progressive discipline of the American soldiery, have taught the Enemy, that the longer he protracts his hostile efforts, the more certain and decisive will be his final discomfiture.  
On our Southern border, victory has continued also to follow the American Standard. The bold and skilful operations of Major General Jackson, conducting troops drawn from the Militia of the States least distant, particularly of Tennessee, have subdued the principal Tribes of hostile savages; and by establishing a peace with them, preceded by recent and exemplary chastisement, has best guarded against the mischief of their cooperation, with the British enterprizes which may be planned against that quarter of our Country. Important Tribes of Indians on our North Western Frontier, have also acceded to stipulations, which bind them to the interests of the United States, and to consider our Enemy as theirs also.  
In the recent attempt of the Enemy on the city of Baltimore, defended by Militia and volunteers aided by a small body of Regulars and Seamen, he was received with a spirit which produced a rapid retreat to his ships; whilst a concurrent attack by a large Fleet was successfully resisted by the steady and well directed fire of the fort and batteries opposed to it.  
In another recent attack by a powerful force on our Troops at Plattsburg, of which regulars made a part only, the enemy, after a perseverance for many hours, was finally compelled to seek safety in a hasty retreat, with our gallant bands pressing upon him.  
On the Lakes, so much contested throughout the war, the great exertions for the command made on our part, have been well repaid. On Lake Ontario our Squadron is now, and has been for some time in a condition to confine that of the Enemy to his own port; and to favor the operations of our land forces on that Frontier.  
A part of the Squadron on Lake Erie has been extended into Lake Huron, and has produced the advantage of displaying our Command of that Lake also. One object of the expedition, was the reduction of Mackinaw, which failed with the loss of a few brave men, among whom was an officer justly distinguished for his gallant exploits. The expedition, ably conducted by both the land and the Naval commanders, was otherwise highly valuable in its effects.  
On Lake Champlain, where our superiority had for some time been undisputed, the British squadron lately came into action, with the American commanded by Captain McDonough. It issued in the capture of the whole of the Enemy’s ships. The best praise for this Officer and his intrepid comrades is in the likeness of his triumph to the illustrious victory which immortalized another officer, and established, at a critical moment, our command of another Lake.  
  
On the ocean the pride of our Naval arms has been amply supported. A second Frigate has indeed fallen into the hands of the Enemy, but the loss is hidden in the blaze of heroism with which she was defended. Captain Porter, who commanded her, and whose previous career had been distinguished by daring enterprize and by fertility of genius, maintained a sanguinary contest against two ships, one of them superior to his own, and under other severe disadvantages, till humanity tore down the colours, which valor had nailed to the mast. This officer and his brave comrades have added much to the rising glory of the American flag, and have merited all the effusions of gratitude, which their country is ever ready to bestow on the champions of its rights and of its safety.  
Two smaller vessels of war have also become prizes to the Enemy; but by a superiority of force, which sufficiently vindicates the reputation of their commanders; whilst two others, one commanded by captain Warrington, the other by captain Blakely, have captured British ships of the same class, with a gallantry and good conduct, which entitle them, and their companions to a just share in the praise of their country.  
In spite of the naval force of the Enemy accumulated on our coasts, our private cruisers also have not ceased to annoy his commerce, and to bring their rich prizes into our ports; contributing thus with other proofs, to demonstrate the incompetency and illegality of a Blockade, the Proclamation of which is made the pretext for vexing and discouraging the commerce of neutral Powers with the United States.  
To meet the extended and diversified warfare adopted by the Enemy, great bodies of Militia have been taken into service for the public defence, and great expences incured. That the defence every where may be both more convenient and more economical, Congress will see the necessity of immediate measures for filling the ranks of the regular Army; and of enlarging the provision for special corps, mounted and unmounted, to be engaged for longer periods of service than are due from the Militia. I earnestly renew, at the same time, a recommendation of such changes in the system of the Militia, as by classing and disciplining for the most prompt and active service, the portions most capable of it, will give to that great resource for the public safety, all the requisite energy and efficiency.  
The monies received into the Treasury during the nine months ending on the thirtieth day of June last, amounted to thirty two millions of dollars, of which near eleven millions were the proceeds of the public Revenue, and the remainder, derived from loans. The disbursements for public expenditures during the same period, exceeded thirty four millions of dollars, and left in the Treasury, on the first day of July, near five millions of dollars. The demands during the remainder of the present year already authorized by congress, and the expences incident to an extension of the  
  
operations of the war, will render it necessary that large sums should be provided to meet them.  
From this view of the national affairs, Congress will be urged to take up without delay, as well the subject of pecuniary supplies, as that of military force, and on a scale commensurate with the extent and the character which the war has assumed. It is not to be disguised, that the situation of our country calls for its greatest efforts. Our Enemy is powerful in men, and in money; on the land, and on the water. Availing himself, of fortuitous advantages, he is aiming, with his undivided force, a deadly blow at our growing prosperity, perhaps at our national existence. He has avowed his purpose of trampling on the usages of civilized warfare, and given earnests of it, in the plunder and wanton distruction of private property. In his pride of maritime Dominion, and in his thirst of commercial monopoly, he strikes, with peculiar animosity, at the progress of our navigation and of our manufactures. His barbarous policy has not even spared those monuments of the arts and models of taste, with which our country had enriched and embellished its infant Metropolis. From such an adversary, hostility in its greatest force and in its worst forms, may be looked for. The American people will face it with the undaunted spirit, which in their Revolutionary struggle, defeated his unrighteous projects. His threats and his barbarities, instead of dismay, will kindle in every bosom an indignation, not to be extinguished but in the disaster and expulsion of such cruel invaders. In providing the means necessary, the national Legislature will not distrust the heroic and enlightened patriotism of its constituents. They will cheerfully and proudly bear every burden of every kind, which the safety and honor of the Nation demand. We have seen them every where paying their taxes, direct and indirect, with the greatest promptness and alacrity. We see them rushing with enthusia[s]m to the scenes where danger and duty call. In offering their blood, they give the surest pledge, that no other tribute will be withheld.  
Having foreborne to declare war, untill to other aggressions had been added the capture of nearly a thousand American vessels, and the impressment of thousands of American seafaring Citizens; and untill a final declaration had been made by the Government of Great Britain, that her hostile orders against our commerce would not be revoked, but on conditions as impossible as unjust, whilst it was known that these orders would not otherwise cease, but with a war which had lasted nearly twenty years, and which, according to appearances at that time, might last as many more; having manifested on every occasion, and in every proper mode, a sincere desire to arrest the effusion of blood, and meet our Enemy on the ground of justice and reconciliation; our beloved country, in still opposing to his persevering hostility, all its energies, with an undiminished disposition towards peace  
  
and friendship on honorable terms, must carry with it, the good wishes of the impartial world, and the best hopes of support from an omnipotent and kind Providence.

The result is not yet known : if on  
one hand the repeal of the orders in  
council, and the general pacification of  
Europe, which withdrew the occasion  
on which inpressments from Ameri*  
can ressels were practised, suggest ex«  
pectations that peace and amity may  
be established, we are compelled on  
the other band, by the refusal of the  
British government to accept the of¬  
fered mediation of the Emperor of  
Russia, by the delays in giving effect  
to its own proposals of a direct nego-  
ciation, and, above all, by the princi¬  
ples aad manner in which the war is  
now avowedly carried on, to infer that  
a strict hostility is indulged more vio¬  
lent than ever against the rights and  
prosperity of this country. This in¬  
creased violenoe is best explained by  
two important circun.stancea, that the  
mat contest in Europe for an equili-  
Drinm, guaranteeing all its states a-  
gainst the ambition of any, has been  
closed without aqy check on the over¬  
bearing power of Great Britain on the  
ocean, and that it has left in her hands  
disposable armoury, with which, for¬  
getting tlm difficukiea of a remote avar  
against a free people, and yielding to  
the intoxicatioD of success with the  
example of a great victim to it before  
her eyes, she cherishes hopes of still  
further aggrandising a power already  
formidable in its abuses to ilie tiUn-  
q^uillity of the civilized and commer¬  
cial world. But whatever may have  
inapired the enemy with these more  
violent purposes, the public councils  
of a nation, more aUe to maintain than  
it was to acquire its independence, and  
with a devotion to it rendered more  
ardent by the experience of its bless¬  
ings, can never deliberate but on the  
means most effectual foe defeating the  
extravagant measures of unwarrant¬  
able passion, with which alone the war  
can now be pursued against us. In tlie  
events of the present campaign, with  
all its augmented means and wanton  
  
use of them, he has little ground for  
exultation, unless he can fm it in the  
success of his Kcent enterprise against  
this metropolis and the neighbouring  
town of Alexandria, from both of  
which his retreats were as precipitate  
as his attempts were bold and fortu-  
nateJ In his other incursions on our  
Atlantic frontier, his progress, often  
checked and chastised by the martial  
spirit of the neighbouring citizens, has  
had more effect ia distressing indivi¬  
duals and in dishonouring his arms,  
than in promoting any object of legi¬  
timate warfare. And ia the two in.  
stances mentioned, however deeply to  
Le regretted on our part, in his tran*  
sient success, which interrupted for a  
moment only the ordinary public busi.  
ness at the seat of government, no com¬  
pensation can accrue for the loss of  
character with the world, by his vio¬  
lation of private property, and his de¬  
struction of public edifices, protected  
as monuments of the arts by the laws  
of civilized warfare. On our side we  
can appeal to a aeries of achievements  
which have given new lustre to the  
American arms. Besides the brilliant  
incidents in the minor operations of  
the campaign, the splendid victories  
  
S lined on the Canadian side of the  
iagara by the Americait forces un¬  
der Major-General Brown, and Briga¬  
diers Scott and Gaines, have gained  
for these heroes and their emulated  
companions the most unfading laurels;  
and having triumphantly proved the  
progressive disoipnne of the American  
soldiery, have taught the enemy that  
the longer he protracts bis hostile ef¬  
forts, the more certain and decisive  
will be his final discomfiture. On the  
southern border victory has continued  
also to follow the Ameriosm standard.  
The bold and skilful operations of  
Major-General Jackson, conducting  
troops drawn from the militia of the  
states least distant, particularly of  
Tenesee, have subdued the principal

tribes of hostile savages ; and by esta-  
blishing a peace with them, preceded  
recent and exemplary chastise-  
ment, we have guarded against the  
mischief of their co-operations with  
the British enterprises which may be  
planned against this quarter of our  
country. Important tribes of Indians  
on our north-western frontier have also  
acceded to stipulations which bind  
them to the interest of the United  
States, and to consider our enemy as  
theirs also.  
  
In the recent attempts of the enemy  
on Baltimore, defended by militia and  
volunteers, aided by a small body of  
regulars and seamen, he was received  
with a spirit which produced a rapid  
retreat to the ships, whilst a concur¬  
rent attack by a large fleet was suc¬  
cessfully resisted by the steady and  
well-directed Are of the fort and bat¬  
teries opposed to it. In another re¬  
cent attack by a powerful force on  
our troops at Plattsburg, of which  
regulars made a part only, the enemy,  
after a perseverance for many hours,  
was finsdly compelled to seek safety  
in a hasty retreat, our gallant bands  
pressing upon him. On the lakes, so  
much contested throughout the war,  
the great exertions for the command  
made on our part have been well re¬  
paid on Lake Ontario. Our squadron  
IS now and has been for some time in  
a condition to confine that of the ene¬  
my to his own port, and to favour  
the operations of our land forces on  
that frontier. On Lake Champlain,  
where our superiority had for some  
time been undisputed, the British squa¬  
dron lately came into action with the  
American, commanded by Captain  
Macdonough : it issued in the capture  
of the whole of the enemy’s ships.  
The best praise of this officer and his  
intrepid comrades is in the likeness of  
his triumph to the illustrious victory  
which immortalized another officer,  
  
and established, at a critical moment,  
our command of another lake. On  
the ocean, the pride of our naval arms  
has been amply supported: a second  
frigate has indeed fallen into the hands  
of the enemy, but the loss is hidden  
in the blaze of heroism with which  
she was defended. Captain Porter,  
who commanded her, and whose pre¬  
vious career had been distinguished by  
daring enterprise and by fertility of  
genius, maintained a sanguinary con¬  
test against two ships, one of them  
superior to his own, and other severe  
disadvantages, till humanity tore down  
the colours which valour had nailed  
to the mast. This officer and his  
comrades have added much to the  
glory of the American flag, and have  
merited all the effusions of gratitude  
which their country is ever ready to  
bestow on the champions of its rights  
and of its safety.  
  
Two smaller vessels of war have  
also become prizes to the enemy, but  
by superiority of force, which suffi¬  
ciently vindicates the reputation of  
their commanders ; whilst two others,  
one commanded by Captain Warring¬  
ton, the other by Captain Blakely,  
have captured British ships of the same  
class with a gallantry and good con¬  
duct which entitled them and their  
commanders to a just share in the  
praise of their country.  
  
In spite of the naval forces of the  
enemy accumulated on our coasts, our  
private cruisers also have not ceased  
to annoy his commerce, and to bring  
their rich prizes into our ports; con¬  
tributing thus, with other proofs, to  
demonstrate the incompetency and the  
illegality of a blockade, the proclama¬  
tion of wtiich has been made the&#x27;pre¬  
text for vexing and discouraging the  
commerce of neutral powers with the  
United States.  
  
To meet the extended and diversi¬  
fied warfare adopted by the enemy.

great bodies of militia have been taken  
into the service of the public defence,  
and great expenses incurred. That  
the defence every where may be both  
more convenient and more economi*  
cal, congress will sec the necessity of  
immediate measures of filling the ranks  
of the regular army, and enlarging the  
provisions for special corps, mounted  
and dismounted, to be engaged for a  
longer period of service than are due  
from the militia. I earnestly renew  
at the same time a recommendation  
of such changes in the system of the  
militia, as, by classing and disciplining  
on the most prompt and active ser¬  
vice the portion most capable of it,  
will give to that resource for the pub¬  
lic safety all the requisite energy and  
efficiency.  
  
A part of the squadron on Lake  
Erie has been extenaed to Lake Hu¬  
ron, and has produced the advantage  
of dispbying our command of that  
lake also. One object of the expedi¬  
tion was the reduction of Mackinan,  
which failed, with the loss of a few  
brave men, among whom was an offi¬  
cer distinguished for his gallant ex¬  
ploits ; and the expedition, ably con¬  
ducted by both land and naval com¬  
manders, was otherwise valuable in its  
effects.  
  
The monies received into the trea¬  
sury during the nine months ending  
the 13th of June last amounted to  
thirty-two millions of dollars, of which  
eleven millions were the proceeds of  
the public revenue, and the remainder  
derived from loans. The disburse¬  
ments for public expenditures during  
the same period exceed thirty-four  
millions of dollars, and left in the  
treasury on the 1st of July near five  
millions of dollars.  
  
The demands during the remainder  
of the present year already authorised  
by congress, and the expenses incident  
to an extension of the operations of  
  
the war, will render it necessary that  
large sums should be provided to meet  
them. From this view of the national  
affairs, congress will be urged to take  
up without delay, as well the subject  
of pecuniary supplies, as that of mili¬  
tary force, and on a scale commen¬  
surate with the extent and character  
which the war has assumed.  
  
It is not to be disguised that the  
situation of our country calls for its  
greatest efforts: our enemy is power¬  
ful in men and money, on the land  
and on the water ; availing himself of  
fortunate circumstances, he is aiming  
with an undivided force a deadly blow  
at our growing prosperity, perhaps  
at our national existence. He has  
avowed his purpose of trampling on  
the usages of civilized warfare, and  
given earnest of it in the plunder and  
wanton destruction of private proper-  
  
ty-  
  
In the pride of maritime dominion,  
and in his thirst of commercial mono¬  
poly, he strikes with peculiar animo¬  
sity at the progress of our navigation  
and manufactures: his barbarous po¬  
licy has not even spared those monu¬  
ments of taste with which our coun¬  
try had enriched and embellished our  
infant metropolis. From such an ad¬  
versary, hostility in its greatest force  
and worst forms may be looked for.—  
The American people will face it with  
the undaunted spirit, which, in their  
revolutionary war, defeated his un¬  
righteous projects ; his threats and  
his barbarities, instead of dismay, will  
kindle in every bosom an indignation  
not to be extinguished but in the dis¬  
aster and expulsion of such cruel in¬  
vaders. In providing the means ne¬  
cessary, the national legislator will not  
distrust the enlightened patriotism of  
his constituents. They will cheerfully  
and proudly bear every burthen of  
every kind which the safety and honour  
of the nation demaodi.

We have seen them every where  
give their taxes, direct and indirect,  
with the greatest promptness and ala&gt;  
crity: we have seen them rushing  
with enthusiasm to scenes where dan¬  
ger and duty call; and, offering their  
blood, they give their surest pledge  
that no other tribute will be with¬  
held.  
  
Having forborne to declare war  
until to other aggressions had been  
added the capture of nearly 1000  
American vessels, and the impress¬  
ment of thousands of seafaring citi¬  
zens, and until a final declaration had  
been made by the government of Great  
Britain, that her hostile orders against  
onr commerce would not be revoked  
bnt on conditions as impossible as un¬  
just, whilst it was known that these  
orders would not otherwise cease but  
with a war which had lasted nearly  
twenty years, and which, according  
to appearances at that time, might last  
as many more—having manifested on  
every occasion, and in every proper  
mode, a sincere desire to meet the  
enemy on the ground of justice, our  
resolution to defend our beloved coun¬  
try, and to oppose to the enemy&#x27;s per¬  
severing hostility all our energy, with  
an undiminished disposition towards  
peace and friendship on honourable  
terms, must carry with it the good  
wishes of the impartial world, and the  
best hopes of support from an omni¬  
potent and kind Providence.

K not to be disguised, that the fcihn*  
tion of our country calls for its great  
rst efforts. Our enemy is powerful  
in men and money ; on the land and  
on the water. Availing himself of

• return or peace, or Timber and mo»effectiv«pr$&gt;  
■visions for prosecuting the&#x27;«rar.  
That result is put yet known. If, on ope band,  
the repeal of the orders in council, and tbe geoefai  
pacification in Europe, which withdrew tbe occa­  
sion on which impressments from American ves­  
sels were practised, suggetfcexpectaiiuns that peaei  
and amity may be re-established; we are com) ailed,&#x27;  
on the other band, by the refusal pi the British go­  
vernment to accept the offered mediation of the  
emperor of Russia, by the delays in giving effect to  
its own pioposal of a direct uegortalion ; and, a­  
hove all, by the principles and manner in which  
the war is now avowedly earned on, to infer that a  
•spirit of hostility is induiged more violent than e­  
■eer, against the. rights and prosperity of this  
country.  
This increased violence is best explained by the  
two important circumstances, that the great con­  
test in Europe, for an equilibrium guaranteeing all  
its states against tbe ambition of any, has been  
closed without any check on the overbearing power  
of Qrrat-Britain on the ocean ; and that it has lelt  
in her hands disposable armaments, with which,  
forgetting the difficulties ol a remote war against a  
tree people ; and yielding to the intoxication of suc­  
cess, with tbe example of a great victim to it be­  
fore her eyes, she cherishes hopes of still further  
•ggTaud.zing a power already formidable in its a­  
buses to the tranquility of the civilized OQd com­  
xuercial world.  
But whatever may have inspired the enemy with  
these more violent purposes, the public councils ol  
• nation, umre able to maintain than it was to ac­  
quire its independence, and with a devotion to it,  
rendered more ardent by the experience of i s bles­  
sings, can never deliberate but on the meuns most  
effectual for defeating the extravagant views or uro­  
warrantable passions, with which aioue the war  
can n&quot;*v be pursued sfgainsl us.  
  
am fc. r pj vampiu^n, me enc­  
my, wth all bis augimr.u-1 mean:-, l.J wanton  
use of them, has little ground lot equitation, un­  
less he can feel it in-the success of his recent -u­  
terprize against this Met input&#x27;s am] the neighbor­  
ing town of Alexandria ; from both of which his  
retreats were as precipitate, as his attetap.s were  
bold and fortunate. In his other incursions ou oui  
Atlantic (rentier, his progress, often checked and  
chastised, by the martial spirit of {% neighboring  
citizens, has had more effect in d&#x27;strissnig n et .id­  
uals, aud in dishonoring his arms, than in promo­  
ting any object of legitimate w..i!are. And m the  
two instances mentioned, however deeply to be le­  
gretled on our part, he will find, 10 bis transient  
success, which inlet rupu-d fora moment only the  
ordinary public business at the srat of government,  
no compensation for the loss of character with the  
world, by his violations of private property, and  
by his destruction of public edifices, protected as  
monuments of the arts by the laws of civilized  
warfare.  
On our side we can eppeal to a series of achieve­  
ments, which have given new lustre to the Ameri­  
can arcus. Besides the brilliant incidents in tbe  
minor operations of the campaign, the splendid  
•victories gained on the Canadian side of the Nia  
para, by tbe American forces under uiaj. general  
idiown, and brigadiers Scott and Gaines, have  
gain d for these heron, arid their emulating com­  
panions, the most unlading laurels ; and having  
triumphantly tested the progressive discipline of tbe  
American soldiery, have taught the enemy that the  
louger he protruits his hostile efforts, the mre  
Certain and decisive will be bis final discomfiture.  
On our southern border victory has continued  
also to follow the American standard. The hold  
arid sku ul operations of .M jor General Jaekson,  
conduct.eg troops drawn from the militia of the  
a&#x27;-.ies 1 as: diet.nt, particularly of Tennessee,  
hove subdued the principal tribes ol hostile sava­  
ges, and by establishing * peace wwh them, pre­  
ceded by recent and exempBry chastisement, has  
best guarded against the misfbief of their co ope­  
ration with the Brit sh emerprizes which may be  
planned against that quarter ol our country. Im­  
portant trines of Indians on our north-western i  
frontier have also at cede] to stipulations, wlit.a  
bind hem to he* interests of the Uuiteu Slates,  
and to, eofltiidvr our enemy as theirs also.  
In the recent attempt of the enemy on the city  
of Baltimore, d. f; tided by militia and volunteers,  
aided by a small body of regulars and seamen, he  
was received with n spirit which produced a rapid  
retreat to his ships, v.nilst a concurrent attack by  
* large fleet was siicccs« uliy res.«tr.i by u,e suady  
and well-directed fire of the fart and batteries op­  
  
jNwa 10 11.  
v *.i another recent attack by a powerful force on  
our ipnops at Plallsburg, of whim rgulars made  
a part only, the enemy, alter a perseverance lor  
many hours, was finally comptlled to seek safety  
in a hasty retreat* with out gallant bands pressing  
upon him.  
On the lakes, so much contested throughout the  
wur, the gient exertions for the command made on  
our part, have been .well repaid. On Lake OnU­  
no, our squAdr&amp; is now, and has been for some  
tune, in a condition to confine that of the enemy  
to his own poit; and to favor the operations of our  
land forces on that frontier.  
A part of the squa lmn on Lake Erie has been  
extended into Lake Huron, and bss produced the  
advantage of&#x27;displaying nur command of that lake  
also. One object of the expedition, was the re­  
duction of Mackinaw, which failed with the loss  
&lt;if a fetr brave men, among whom was an officer  
justly distinguished tor bis gallant exploits. The  
expedition, ably conducted by both the land and  
the naval commanders, was otherwise highly velu­  
able in its elicits.  
On Lake Cbetnplain, where our superiority had  
for some time beep undisputed, the British squadron  
lately came luto&#x27;action, with the American, com­  
manded by Captain Macdonough. It issued in the  
capture of the whole of the enemy&#x27;s shtps. The  
bevt praise for this officer and his intrepid comrades  
i» in the likeness of his tnumph to the illustrious  
victory, which immortalized enotSet,officer, uud  
established, at a critical moment, diir command  
of another lake. i.,g  
On the ocean the pride rtf our naval arms lias  
ham amply supported. A second frigate has in­  
deed fallen fn’.o the hands of tSe enemy, but the  
loss is hidden ia the blaze of heroism vsttb which  
*be was s dtfriiJed, Captain Porter, ftho ■com­  
manded her, and whose pie\tows cdTeef hailleen  
distinguished by daring enterpm? and by fertility  
of g-uius, maintained a sanguinary contest against  
two ships, one of then superior lu bis uwa, and  
  
node* other severe disadvantages, till humanity  
tare down the Colors, whirl) valor had nailed to  
the mast. This officer nod his brave comrades  
have added much to the rising glory of the Ameri­  
can flag, acd have merited all the effusions of gra­  
titude which their country is ever ready to bestow  
ion the champions of its rights and of its safety.  
Two smaller vessels 01 war have also become  
prizes to the enemy ; but by a superiority of force  
which sufficiently vindicates the reputation of their  
cojnmanders; whilst two others, ane commanded  
by Captain Warrington, the other by ^&lt;puiu  
Blakely, have captured British ships of the same  
class, with a gallauuy and good conduct, which  
entitle them and tbeir companions to a just share  
in the piaise of tbeir country.  
Io spite of the naval force of the enemy accu­  
mulated on our coasts, our private cruizers also  
have not reased to aonoy his commerce, and to |  
bring their rich prizes into our ports ; contributing  
thus, with other prnols, to demonstrate the in-1  
competency nnd illegality of a blockade, the pro­  
clamation ol which is mivde the pretext for vexing  
and discouraging the commerce of neutral powers  
with the United Stales.  
To meet the extended and diversified warfare  
adopted by the enemy, great bodies ol militia have  
been taken into service lor the public defence, and  
great expenses incurred. That the defence every  
where may be boih more ronvemeut and mure eco­  
nomical, Congress will se* the necessity of imme­  
diate measures ior filling the ranks of the regular  
army ; and of enlarging tl.e provision for special  
corps, mounted and unmounted, to be engaged for  
longer periods ol service than are due from the mi­  
litia. I eirnestly renew, at the same time, a re­  
commendation ot such changes in the system of  
militta, as, by classing and disciplining for the  
most prompt and active servire the portions uiosf  
capable of it, will give to that great resource  
tor the public safety, ail the requisite energy and  
efficiency.

nine months ending on the thirtieth day of June  
last, amounted to thirty-two millions of dollars,  
of which near eleven millions wore the proceeds oi  
the public revenue, end the remainder derived from  
loans, 1 he disbursements for public expenditures  
diiring the same period exceeded thirty-four mil­  
lions of dollars, and left in the treasury, no the  
first day of Jaly, near five millions of dollars.  
The demands duriug the reroaindei of the present  
yeat already authorised by Congress, and the ex­  
penses incident to an extension of the operations  
of the war, will render it necessaiy that large sums  
should be provided to meet them.  
from this view of the national affairs, Congress  
will be urged to lake up without delay, as well  
the subject of pecuniary supplies as that of mili­  
tary force, and on a scale commensurate with the  
extent and the character which the war has as­  
sumed. It 13 not to be disguised, that the situa­  
tion of our country calls for its greatest efforts.  
Our enemy is powerful in men and in money ; on

thirst of commercial monopoly, he strikes with  
peculiar animosity at the progress of our naviga­  
tion and of our manufacluies. Ills barbarous poli­  
cy has not evtn spared those monuments «&gt;f the arts  
and models of taste, with which our country had en­  
riched and embellished us infant metropolis. From  
such an adversary, hostility in its gieaiest force  
and in us woist forms, may be looked tor. The  
American people will fare it with the undaunted  
spirit which in their revolutionary struggle defeated  
his uurigbleous projects. His threats and his bar­  
barities, instead of dismay, will kindie in every bo­  
som an indignat.on not to be extinguished hut in  
the disaster and expulsion ol such cruel invaders.  
In provid’ng the means necessary, the National  
Legislature will not distrust the heroic and enlight­  
ened patriotism of its &#x27;constituents. They will  
cheerfully and proudly bear every burden ol every  
kind, which lb« safety and honor of the nation de­  
mand. We have seen them every where paying  
their taxes, direct and indirect, with the greatest  
promptness and alacrity. W’e see them rushing  
with eBthusHsm to the scenes where danger and du­  
ty call. In oflering their blood, they give the sur­  
est pledge that no other tribute will be withheld.  
Having torebone to declare war until to other ag­  
gress&#x27;nns lud been added tbe capture of marly a  
thousand American vessels, and the impressment  
of thousands of American sea-faring citizens ; and  
until a final declaration lad been made by the go­  
vernment of Greal-Britain, that her hostile oiders  
against our commerce would aot he tevoked, but  
on conditions as impossible as unjust ; whilst it  
was known that these orders would not otherwise  
cease, but with a war which had lasted nearly 20  
years, and which, accordiag to appearances at that  
time, might fast as many more ; having manif.-st- 1  
ed on every orcation, and iu every proper mode, a ,  
sincere desire to arrest the effusion of blood, and  
meet our enemy on the ground of justice and re­  
conciliation, our beloved couutry, in still opposing  
to his persevering hostility all its energies, with an !  
undimmisbed disposition towards peace and friend­  
ship on honorable terms, must carry with it tbe  
good wishes of tbe impartial world, and tbe best  
hopes of support from an Omnipotent and kind :  
Providence.

National Intelligencer Extra,  
iFits/nngton, Sept. 20,  
I o’clock P. M.  
This day the President of the United States  
transmitted to Congress, by Mr. Kdward  
Coles, his Secretary, the following Message :  
Fellsv)-Citizen* of the Senate, and of tin  
riouse of Representative* :  
Notwithstanding the early day which had  
been fixed for vmir session of the present  
year, I was induced to call you together still  
sooner, as well tlial an* inadc&lt;|u;&lt;« y in the  
c x sting provivlons for the wants of the Trea­  
sury might lie supplied, as&#x27;hat no delay might  
htijip-n in providing for the result of the nc­  
gociatimis on font with (ireat Britain, wheth­  
er it should mpiire arrangements adapted to  
a relurn of peace, 01 further ami more ef­  
fective provisions for prosecuting the war.  
&#x27;Ihat result is not yet known. If, on one  
hand, the repeal of the orders In council, and  
t:»c gtncr.il pacification in K Tope, which  
withdrew the * rcamon on widen imprest*  
  
ments from American vessels were practised  
suggest expectations that peace and amity  
may be re-established : we are compelled, oi»  
the other hand, by the refusal of the Hi irisli  
government to accept the offered mediation  
of the lhnperor of Kussia, by the delays, in  
firing effect to its own proposal of a direct  
negotiation ; ami, «ibove all, by the principles  
and manner in wliicti the war Is no&quot;, avowed­  
ly carried on, to idler that a spirit of hostility  
is indulged more violent than ever, a-au.st  
the rights and ;iro*pent) of this conn try 7  
This inei cased \ tolenec is best explained hr  
the two imp-rumt circumstances, that the  
gieat cout.*it m Europe, for an equilibrium  
guaranteeing ah its states again sc- the ambiti­  
tion oi any, has been closed without any  
check ou the overbearing power oi Great­  
Britain on the oceau; and that it lias left m  
iier hands disposable armaments, with which,  
forgetting the diiHr.ultius ol a remote war i­  
gaiust a free p-ople ; and, yielding to the in­  
toxiCat’ori fjf sm sias, with the example of a  
I5ie.1t uctim to t oeiov*: her&lt;-• es,-.*&gt;■• ctv&#x27;-.&#x27;.sb  
cs hopes af stdl turlnrr aggrandizing a power  
already formidable in its abuses to lie tran­  
quility of the civilized and c.ammerciiil world;  
Hut whatever may have inspired the enemy  
with these more vi dent ptnqn &gt;vs, t!ie public  
councils of a nation, more able to maintain  
tli ju it was to acquire its independence, an I  
ivn.11 a devotion to it, rendeVed more ardent  
by the experience of its blessing&#x27;s, van never  
deliberate but on the means most effectu.d  
for defeating the extravagant views or un­  
warrantable passions, with which alone the  
war can now lie pursued against us.  
lu the events of the present campaign, the  
enemy , with ail Ins augmented means, and  
Wdntou usd of them, has tittle ground for e&lt;­  
ultation, unless he can feel it in the success of  
his recent enterprises against this Metrop­  
olis and the neighboring town of Alexandria ;  
from both of winch his retreats were as pre­  
cipitate, as hi attempts were bold and f rtu­  
n.ite. lit his other, incursions on our Atlantic  
frontier, his progress, oft 11 checked and chas­  
tised, by the martial spirit of the neigh her*  
ing ritizens, has had more effect in distressing  
individuals, and in dishonoring his arms, than  
111 promoting any object ot legitimate wai­  
fire. And in the two instances mentioned,  
however deeply to be regretted on our pan,  
he will find, in his transient success which  
interrupted for a moment only the ordinary  
public business .it tne scat of government, no  
coinpensati.in 1 r the loss of character with  
the world, n s violations of private proper­  
ty, and by h destruction of public edifice-,  
protected as monuments of the arts, by ti e  
laws of civilized warfare.  
On our side we can nppeal to a serin-, of  
achievements, which have given new lustre  
to the American arms. Besides the brilliant  
incidents in the miliar operations of the cam­  
paign, the splendid victories gained on the  
Canadian side of the Niagara, !&gt;, the Amer­  
ican forces under Major General Brown,  
Brigadiers Scott and Gaines,, have gained for  
those heroes, and their emulating compan­  
ions, the most unfading laurels ; and having  
............tl.. 1 .... ..  
  
*.I&quot;.J 1 .J* ’ V- VlldUl  
pline of the American soldiery, have taught  
the enemy that the longer lie protracts his  
hostile efforts, the more certaiu and deceive  
will be !us final discomfiture.  
On our southern border victory has con­  
tinued also to follow the American standard.  
The bold and skilful operations of Maj. lien.  
Jackson, conducting troops drawn from the  
militu of the states least distant, particular­  
ly of Tennessee, have subdued the principal  
tribes of hostile savages, and by establishing  
a peace with them preceded by recent and  
exemplary chastisement, has best guar eil u  
gainst the mischief of their Co-operation with  
the British enterprises which may be planet#*,  
against that quarter of our country. Impor­  
tant tribes of Indians on our north western  
frontier have also acceded to stipulations,  
which bind them to the interests of the United  
St.tU j, and to consider our enemy as th*iis  
also.  
In the recent attempt of the’ enemy on the  
city of .Baltimore, defended by militia and  
volunteers, aided by a small body of regulars  
and seamen, he was received with a spirit  
which produced a rapid retreat to his ships,  
whilst a concurrent attack by a large fleet  
was success fully resisted by the stead) and  
well directed lira of the fort and batteries op­  
posed to it.  
In another recent attack by a powerful  
force on our troops at Plattsbnrg, of which re­  
gulars made a part only, the enemy, after a  
perseverance for many hours, was fi.a&#x27;dy k  
compelled to seek safety in a nasty retreat,  
with our gallant bands pressing upon hi a.  
(in the lakes, mi much c n.t steel throughout  
the war, the great exertions tor the cnnin and  
made oil our part, ha\«- been well repaid.—  
On lr.k Ontario, oui squadron is now, and has  
been to some time, in a condition to Confine  
that of the enemy tohiso vn port; and to fa­  
vor the operations of (airland forces on that  
tin. .tier.  
A part of the squadron on Lake F.rie has  
been extended in o Lake Huron, ami has pro­  
duce:! tne advantage of displaying our cnni­  
miin i (n th.it lake also.—()nr objei t of the cx­  
pcdi’ iri, was the reduction of Mackinaw,  
which failed with the loss of a few brave men,  
ulining whom w.w an officer justly distinguish­  
ed I • his gallant exploits. The expedition  
ably conducted by both tlit; land and the naval  
commanders was otherwise huh v valuable m

d wn the colors, which valor lmd nailed to  
tlve mast. Tltis officer and his brave com­  
rades have add«d much to the rising glory ot  
the American flag, and have merited all the  
effusions of gratitude which their country is  
ever ready to bestow on the champions of  
its r ights and of its safety.  
Two smaller vessels of war hav e also be­  
came prizes to the enemy ; but by a sujxsriur­  
ity of force which sufficiently vindicates the  
reputation of Their commanders ; whilst two  
others, eve commanded by Capt. Warrington,  
the other by Capt. Blakely, have captured Bri­  
tish ships of the same class, with a gallantry  
aul good conduct, which, entitle them tk. their  
companions, to a jiisi share in the praise of  
their countrv.  
In spite of the naval force of the enemy ac­  
cumulated cn our coasts, our private cruisers  
also have not ceased to annoy his commerce,  
4-d to bring their rich prizes into our ports ;  
contributing thus with other proofs, to demon*  
trate the inc &gt;mpetencv and illegality of a  
%.bl..r kude, the proclamation of which is made  
the pretext for vexing and discouraging the  
commerce of neutral powers with the United  
States.  
To meet the extended and diversified warfare s­  
dopted L&gt; tin- enemy, great Imdien of militia have been  
t .ken into service for the public defence,and great ex­  
it*.. incurred. That the defence everv where may  
be both more convenient and more economical, Con­  
ft v-s will seethe necessity of iuuucdinte measures far  
fcl&#x27;ing die rank* oft he regular army ; and of enlarging  
tl e ] rovl-uun for s(iccutl corpa, mounted and unmount

S&#x27; e due from the militia, i earnestly mjew, at the

&#x27;1 In* monies received into tlie Treasury during tlie  
nine mouths ending on thu thirtieth day of Juiie Lest,  
amounted tothirty-two millions of dollaj-s, of which  
n*au- eleven millions were the proceeds of the public,  
revenue, and the t* maindei derived from loans. The  
disbursements tor public expenditures during the same  
pcr.od exceeded thirty-four mitlions of dollars, and left  
in the 11easury, on the first day of July, near five mil­  
lions of dullara. The demands during the remainder  
rl the present year already authorised by Cougress, and  
the er.p. nces incident to a&#x27;* extension of the operations  
ot the war, w ill render it necessary that large sums  
should he provided to meet them.  
t rota this view of the national affairs, Congress will  
bp urged to take up without delay, as well tlie subject  
ot pecuniary supplies as that of military force, ami on a  
xi-al*- commensurate with the. extent und tlie character  
s* h cli the war has assumed. It is not to be dis­  
gttised, that the situation of our country calls for  
its gr attest efforts. Our enemy is powerful in men  
am* mi money ; on the land and on the water. Availing  
lihiip* It of fortuitous advantages, tie is aiming, with his  
undivided t roc, r deadly blow nl ourgmvVing prusj*eri­  
t&#x27;, perhaps at our national existence. Hu has avowed  
hi* purpose ot tramplingon the usages *&gt;f civilized war­  
fare, and given ourncsts ofit, in the plunder an*! wan­  
ton destruction of private property. In his pride of  
liu.ritime dominion and in histhirst of commercial ina­  
liopoly, he strikes with pefulhir animosity at the pro­  
15 ,-vs ot onr navigation and of our manufactures.  
His barbarous policy has mil even spared those mon­  
uments ot the arts and models of ta«te, with which *&gt;nr  
• iiintrv had enriched and embellished its infant Me­  
tro|&gt;* I&#x27;i uni such an adve|-sjir\, hostility in its greatest  
force Sc in its worst forms may In looked for. The A­  
luericitii people will tikee it with tin- undaunted spirit  
&gt;diich in our revolutionary struggle defeated his unrigh­  
te*His pixjects.  
I lie tin vat- Si his barbaritiespnstead of dismay, will kin­  
dle in evt ry bosom an indignation nut to la* * xtinguisli­  
e*l hut in the disaster anil expulsion of such cruel inva  
d* !•*. In providing the means necessary, the National  
Legislature will not distrust the heroic and enlighten­  
ed patriotism of its constituents. They will cheerfully  
nt:d proudly bear every buiden of everv ki.id, which  
tlie suit ty rimI honor of the nation demand. We have  
s* cn them every where paying their taxes, direct and  
m.iircct, with the greatest promptness and alacrity.—  
We see them rushing with enthusiasm to the scenes  
where (lunger and duty call. In offering their blood,  
they give the surest pledge that 1.0 other tribute \\ ill be  
Withheld.  
Having forhomc to declare w ar until to other ag­  
gr* ssions had been added the capture of nearly a thou­  
sand American vessels,and the impressment ofthou­

Notwithstanding the early dey which hed been  
fixed for your session of the present year, I was in-  
duced to call you together stiil sooner, as well that  
any inadequacy in the existing provisions for the  
Wants of the treasury might be supplied, as that no  
deliy might happen in providing for the result of the  
hegooistions on foot with Great Britain, whether it  
should require arrangements adapted to a retuin of  
peace, or further and more effective provisions for  
Prosecuting the war.  
  
That result jis not yet known. If, on one hand,  
the repeal of the orders in council, and the general  
pacitication in Enrope, which withdrew the occasion  
fon which impressments from American vessels were  
;practised, surcest expectations that peace and ami-  
ty may be re-established; we are compelled, on the  
‘other hand, by the refusal of the Britsh government  
ito accept the offered mediation of the emperor of  
Ritssia; by the delays in giving effect to its own pro-  
posal of a direct negociation; and above all, by the  
principles and manner in which the war is now avow-  
edly carried on, to infer that a spirit of hostility is  
indulged more violent than ever, against the rights  
jand prosperity of this country.  
  
This mereased violence is best explained by the  
;two unportant circumstances, that the great contest  
(in Europe, for an equilibrium guaranteeing all its  
states against the xmbition of any, has been closed  
}without any check on the overbearing power of  
‘Creat Britain on the ocean; and that it has left um:  
her hands disposable armaments, with which, for-  
yeiting the difficulties ofa remote war against a free  
people; and yielding to the intoxication of success,  
hwith ihe example of a great victim to it before her  
eyes, she cherishes hopes of still further aggtandiz-  
ing a power clready tormidable in its abuses to the  
i tranquility of the civilized and commercial wor!d.  
  
| But, whatever maj lisve inspired the enemy with  
these more violent purposes, the public councils of  
&#x27;2 Nation, more uble to maintain than it was to ac-  
iquire its independence, and with a devotion to it,  
rendered more ardent by the experience of its bless-  
(ings, can never deliberate but on the means most  
effectual for defeating the extravagant views or un-  
warrantable passions, wilh which alone the war can  
now be pursued against us.  
  
In the events of the present campaign, the enemy,  
with all his sugmented means, and wanton use of  
them, has little ground for exultation, unless he can  
feel it in the success of his recent enterprizes against  
}this Metropolis, and the neighboring town of Alex-  
landria; from both of which his retreats were as pre-  
cipitate, as his atempts were bold and fortunate.  
In his other incursions on our Atlentic frontier, his  
progress, often checked and chastised by the martial  
spirit of the neignboring citizens, has had more ef-  
fect in distressing incividuals, and in dishonoring his  
arms, than in promoting any object of legitimate  
varfare. And in the two instances mentioned, how-  
ever deeply to be regretted on our part, he wiil find  
in his transient success, which interrupted for a mo-  
ment only the ordinary public business at the seat of  
rovernment, no compensation for the loss of charac:  
ter with the world, by his violations of private pro-  
perty, and by his destruction of public edifices, pro-  
tected, as monuments of the arts, by the laws of ct-  
Vilized warfare.  
  
On our side we can appeal to a series of achiev-  
ments, which have given new lustre to the Ameri-  
‘can arms. Besides the brilliant incidents in the mt-  
inor #perations of the campaign, the splendid victo-  
lries pained on the Canadian side of the Niagara, by

brigadiers Scott and Gaines, have gained for these  
heroes and their emulating companions, the most  
unfading laurels; and having triumphantly tested  
the progressive discipline of the American soldiery,  
have taught the enemy that the longer he protracts  
his hostile efforts, the more certain and decisive will  
be his final discomfiture.  
  
On our southern border victory has continued al-  
so to follow the American standard. ‘The bold and  
skilful operations of major-general Jackson, con-  
ducting tovops drawn érom the militia of the states  
Jeast distant, particukirly of Tennessee, have sub  
dued the principal tribes of hostile savages, and, by  
establishing a peace with them, preceded by recent  
ani exemplary ciiastisement, has best guarded a-  
gainst the mischief of their co-operation with the  
British enterprizes which may be planned against  
that quarter of our country.  
Indians on our north-western frontier, have also ac-  
ceded ts stipulations which bind them to the inte-  
rests of the United States, and to consider our ene-  
my as theirs also.  
  
In the recent attempt of the enemy on the city of  
  
Baltimore, defended by militia and volunteers, aid-  
ed by a small body of regulars and seamen, he was  
received with a spirit which produced a rapid re-  
treat to his ships; whilst a concurrent attack by a  
large fleet was successfully resisted by the steady  
and well directed tire of the fort and batteries oppo-  
sec to it.  
  
In another recent attack by a powerful force on  
our troops at Plattsburg, of which regulars made a  
part only; the enemy, after a perseverance for many  
hours, was finally competled to seek safety in a has-  
ty retreat, with our gallant bands pressing upon  
him.  
  
Qn the Lakes, so much contested throughout the  
war, the great exertions for the command made on  
our part have been well repaid. On lake Ontario,  
our squadron is now, and las been for some time, in  
a condition to confine that of the enemy to his own  
port, and favor the operations of our land forces on  
that frontier.  
  
A purt of the squadron on lake Erie has been ex-  
tended into lake Huron, and has produced the ad-  
vantage of displaying our command of that Inke al-  
so. One object of the expedition was ‘the reduction  
of Mackinaw, which failed with the loss of a few  
brave men, among whom was an officer justly dis-  
tinguished for his gallant exploits. ‘Phe expedi-  
tion, ably conducted both by the land and the na-  
val commanders, was otherwise highly valuable in  
its effects.  
  
Oa Ivke Champlain, where superiority had for  
some time been indisputed, the British squadron  
lately came into action, with the American, com-  
manded by capt. Macdonough. [t issued in the cap-  
ture of the whole of the enemy’s ships. The best  
praise for this officer and his imtrepid comrades, is  
in the likeness of his trkamph to the illustrious vic-  
tory, which immortalized another officer, and esta-  
blished, at a critical moment, our command of ano-  
ther like.  
  
On tl  
  
Important tribes of,  
  
ie ocean, the pride of our naval arms has|the usages of civil;  
  
the rising glory of the American flag, and have me-  
rited all the effusions of gratitude which their coun-  
try 1s ever ready to bestow on the champions of its  
rights and of its safety.  
  
Two smaller vessels of war have also become  
prizes to the enemy, but by a superiority of force,  
which sufficiently vindicates the reputation of their  
commanders; whilst two others, one commanded  
by captain Warrington, the other by captain Blake-  
ly, have captured British ships of the same class,  
With a gallantry and good conduct, which entitle  
them, and their companions, to a just share in the  
praise of their country.  
  
In spite of the naval force of the enemy accumu.  
jlated on our coasts, our private cruisers 2lso have  
jnot ceased to annov his commerce, and to bring their  
irich prizes into our ports; contributing thus, with  
other proofs, to demonstrate the incompetency and  
illegality of a blockade, the proclamation of which  
is made the pretext for vexing and discouraging  
the commerce cf neutral powers with the United  
States.  
  
To meet the extended and diversified warfare  
adopted by the enemy, great bodies of militia have  
been taken into service for the public defence, and  
great expenses incurred. That the defence every  
where may be both more convenient and more eco-  
nomical, Congress wiil see the necessity of imme-  
diate measures for filling the ranks of the regular  
army, and of enlarging the provision for special  
jcorps, mounted and unmounted, to be engaged for  
longer periods of service than are due from the mi-  
litia. Tearnestly renew, at the same time, a recom-  
mendation of such changes in the system of the mi-  
litray 9s by classing, ant disciplining for the most  
prompt and active service the portions most capa-  
ble of it, will give to that great resource for the  
| public safety, all the requisite energy and efficiency.  
| The monies received into the Treasury during  
ithe nine months ending on the 30th day of June  
last, amounted to 32 millions of dollars; of whicls  
near 11 millions were the proceeds of the public re-  
venue, and the remainder derived from loans. The  
disbursements for public expenditures during the  
same period exceeded 34 millions of dollars, and  
left in the Treasury on the Ist day of July, near 5  
millions of dollars. The demands during the res  
imainder of the present year, already authorized by  
Congress, and tire expences incident to an extension  
of the operations of the war, will render it necessag  
ry that large sums should be provided to meet them.  
| From this view of the national affairs, congress  
will be urged to take up, without delay, as weil  
the subject of pecuniary supplies as that of military  
force, and 6n a scexle commensurate with the extent  
and the character which the war has assumed. It is  
not to be disguised, that the situation of our country  
calls for its greates: efforts. Our enemy is powerful  
in men and money; on the land and on the water.—  
Availing himself of fortuitous advantages, he is  
aiming, with his undivided force, a deadly blow at  
our growing prosperity, perliaps at our national ex-  
istence. Le has avowed his purpose of trampling on  
ed warfare, and given carnests

be re-^jrtablishcd; we are romprllvd, on the  
other hand, by the refusal of the British go-  
Terjment to arcept the oflercd mediation of  
the em|&gt;eror of Russia, by the delays in  
giving efiert to its own prn{&gt;o..al of a direct  
negotiation, and above all, by the principles  
and manner in which the war is now avowed*  
ly carried on, to infer that a spirit of hostility  
is indulged more violent than ever, against  
the righU and prosperity of this country.  
  
This increased violation is best explained by  
the two important circumstances, that the  
great contest of Enro|&gt;e, for an equilibrium  
guarantying all its states against the ambi¬  
tion of any, has been closed without any check  
«in the overbearing power of Great-Bi&#x27;itain on  
the ocean; and that it has left in her hands  
disposable armaments, with which, (orgotting  
the difficulties of a remote war against a free  
people; and yielding to the intoxication of  
success, with the example of a great victim to  
it before her eyes, she cherishes liopcs of sti’l  
further aggrandiEinga|H)wer already formida¬  
ble in its abuses to the tranquillity of the ci¬  
vilized and comnnwrial world.  
  
But whatever may have inspired the enemy  
with these more violent piirjioses, the public  
oouncils of a nation, more ahle to maintain  
than it was to acquire its independence, and  
with a devotion to it rendered more ardent by  
the experience of its blessings can nevcfr de¬  
liberate but on the means most effectiial for  
defeating the extravagant views of unwarrant¬  
able passions, with which alone the war can  
now be pursued against us.  
  
In the event of the present campaign, the  
enemy, with his augmented means, and wan¬  
ton use of them, has little groiiud for exulta¬  
tion, unless he can feel it in the success of iiis  
recent enterprise against this metropolis and  
the neighitoin&#x27;ing town of Alexandria; from  
both of which bis retreats were as precipitate,  
as his attempts were l)old and fortunate- In  
his other incursions on our Atlantic frontier,  
bis progress, often checked and chastised, by  
the martial spirit of the neighiMniring citizens,  
has had more cflTect in distressing individuals,  
and in dishonouring his arms, than in promo¬  
ting any object of legitimate warfare. And in  
the instances mentioned, however &lt;leeply to be  
regretted on our part, he will find, in liis tran¬  
sient success, which internijitcd for a moment  
only the ordinary public business at the scat of  
government, no compensation for the loss of  
character with the world, by his violation of  
private property, and by his destruction of  
public edifices, protected as moiuiments of the  
arts by the laws of civilized warfare.  
  
On our side we can appeal to a series of  
acliievments, which have given new lustre to  
tile .American arms. Besides the brilliant in¬  
cidents in the minor operations of the cam¬  
paign, the splendid victories gained on tlie  
t&#x27;anadian side of the Niagara, by the .\ineri-  
forces under Major General Brown, and  
  
Brigadiers Scott and Gaines, have gained Fur  
these lieroes, and their einnlatingconipanioiu,  
the most unfading laurels; and having triinn-  
phaiitly tested the progressive discipline of tlie  
American soldiery, have taught the enemy that  
the longer he ,protracts his hostile efforts, the  
more curtain and decisive will be bis final dis¬  
comfiture.  
  
On our southern border victory has continu¬  
ed also to follow the American standard.  
The liold and skilful operations of Major Ge¬  
neral Jackson, conducting troops drawn from  
tlie militia of the states least distant, particu¬  
larly of Tenn&lt;‘sce, have subdued the principal  
trilies of hostile savages, and by cstablishiiir  
a peace with tliem, preceded by recent and  
exemplary chastisement, has best guarded  
against llic mischief of their co-operation  
with the Britisii enterprises which may be  
planned against that quarter of oiir rountry.  
important trities of Indians on our northwest^  
ern frontier liave also aecetled to stipulations  
which bind them to the interest of the United  
States, and to consider onr enemy as theirs also.  
  
Ill the recent attemiit of the enemy on the  
city of Baitiiiiore, by militia and volunteers,  
aided by a small body of regulars and seamen,  
he was received with a s|&gt;irit which pnidiiccd a  
rapid retreat to his slii|)s, whilst a concurrent  
attack by a large fleet was successfully resisted  
by the steady and well directed fire of the  
licirt and batteries opposed to it.  
  
In another recent attack by a powerful  
force on our troops at Plattshnrgli, of which re¬  
gulars made a part only, and the enemy, after  
a perseverance for many liours, was finally  
compelled to seek safety in a hasty retreat,  
with our gallant bands pi&#x27;ussing upon him.  
  
On the lakes, so much contested thronghoiit  
the war, the great exertions tor tlie command  
made on our part have been well repaid. On  
Lake Ontario, our squadron is now, and hat  
been for some time, in condition to confine  
that of the enemy to his own port; and to  
favour the opcratiiuis of our land forces on  
that ti&#x27;eiilior.  
  
A part of the squadron on Lake Erie has  
been extended to Ijakc Huron, and has prodn-  
red the advantage of displaying our command  
on tliat lake al-o. One object of the expedi¬  
tion was the reduction of Makkinaw, wliich  
failed with the loss of a few brave men, among  
w&#x27;lioni was an officer justly distinguished for  
his gallant exploits. The expedition, ably con¬  
ducted oy liotli tiie land and naval command¬  
ers, was otherwise highly valuable in its effects.  
  
On Lake C&#x27;lianiplaiii, where our superiority  
had for some time been undisputed, the Bri-  
tisii squadron lately came kitu action, with the  
American, commanded by Captain M‘Do-  
nongli. It issued in the capture of the whole  
of the enemy’s ships. Tlie best praise fir

(Utabtished at a critical moment, our command  
of another lake.  
  
On the ocean the pride of our naval arms  
has been amply supported. A second frigate  
has indeed fallen into the hands of the enemy,  
but the loss is hidden in the bliize of heroism  
yrith which she was defended. Captain Porter,  
who commanded her, ami whose previous ca-

•od of its safety.  
  
Two smaller vessels of war have also become  
prizes to thecnemy.butby asuperiority offbree  
which sufficiently vindicates tlie reputation of  
their connnaiiders; whilst two others one  
cominaiided by Captain.Warrington, the other  
hy Captain Blakely, have captured British  
ships of the same class, with a gallantry and  
good contluet which entitles them and their  
oompanions, to a just share in the praise of  
their country.  
  
In spite of the naval force of the enemy ac¬  
cumulated on our coasts, our private ci&#x27;uiscrs  
also have not ceased to annoy his commerce,  
and to bring their prizes into our ports ; con¬  
tributing thus, with other proofs, to demon¬  
strate the incoinpeteney and illegality of a  
blockade, tbe proclamation of which is made  
the pretext Ibr vexing and disconragrng tbe  
commerce of neutral powers with the United  
States.  
  
To meet the extended and diversified war-  
Ikre adopted by the enemy, great bodies of  
militia have been taken into service for the  
public defence, and great expenses incurrerl.  
TJiat the defence « very wliere may be both  
more convenient and more ceonoinieal, con¬  
gress will see tlie necessity of immediate inea-  
nres for tilling the ranks of the regular army;  
and of enlarging the provision for special  
corps, inonnted aiiil uninonnted, to be enga¬  
ged for longer perimis of service than arc due  
hOHitJie militia. I earnestly renew, at the same  
time, a rccumiueiulatinn of such changes in  
tbe system of militia, as by classing and dis¬  
ciplining for the most prompt and active ser¬  
vice the |)oi tious most capable of it, will give  
to tliat great resource for the public safety,  
all the requisite energy and efficiency.  
  
The iroiieys received into the treasury du-  
tiug the nine months ending uii the 13th day  
of June last, amounting to thirty two millions  
of dollars; of which eleven millions were the  
proceeds of the public revenue, and the re¬  
mainder derived from loans. The disburse-  
meuts for public expendilures during tbe  
•amo perioil, exceeded thirty-four millions of  
  
dollars, and l«^ft in the treasury, oh the first  
day of July, near five millions of dollars. The  
demands during the remainder of the present  
year already authorized by congress, and the  
expenses incident to an extensiouof the ope¬  
rations of the war, will render it necessary  
that large sums should be provided to meet  
them.  
  
From this view of the national afliurs, con¬  
gress will be urged to take up, without delay,  
as well the siili^ct of pecuniary supplies, a»  
that of military forc», and a scale coinnien-  
snratc with the extent and character which  
the war has assumed. It is not to be disguised,  
that the situation of our country calls fur iU  
greatest eflurts. Onr enemy is powerful in  
men and money ; on the land and on the wa¬  
ter. Availing himself of fortuitous advanta¬  
ges, he is aiming, with his undivided lorce, a  
deadly blow at our growing prosperity, jicr-  
baps at our national existence. He has avow¬  
ed his purpose of trampling on the usages of  
civilized warfare, and given earnests of it, in  
the plunder ami wanton destruction of private  
&gt; property. In his pride of maritime doiniuion,  
and in his thirst of commercial monopoly, he  
strikes with peculiar animosity at the prt&gt;-  
grt&gt;ss of our navagation and of our manufac¬  
tures. His barbarous policy lias not even spa¬  
red those inoniiments of the arts and models of  
taste, with which our country had enriched  
and embellished its infant metropolis. From  
sncli an adversary, hostility in its greatest  
three and in its worst forms, may be looked  
tor. The American people will lace it with  
the undaunted spirit, which in their revolu¬  
tionary struggle deleated his unrighteous pro¬  
jects. His threats and his barbarities, instead  
of dismay, w ill kindle in every bosom an in-  
tlignatiuii not to be extinguished but in tlie  
disaster am! expulsion of such cruel invaders.  
Ill providing the means necessary, the nation¬  
al legislature will not distrust the heroic and  
enlightened patriotism of its constituents.  
&#x27;I&#x27;hey will clieerlully and proudly bear every  
burden of every kind, which the safety and  
honour of the nation demand. We have seen  
them every where paying their taxes, direct  
and indirect, with the greatest promptness  
and alacrity. VVe see them rushing with en-  
tlinsiasm to the scenes where danger aud duty  
call. Ill offering their blood, they give Die  
surest pledge that no other tribute will be  
withheld.  
  
Having furebornc to declare war, until t*  
other aggi&#x27;essions bad been added tbe capture  
of nearly a thousand American vessels, aud  
the iiiqircssment of thousands of American  
seafaring citizens : and until a final declara¬  
tion had been made by the government of  
Great-Britain, that her hostile orders against  
onr commerce would not be revoked, but oft  
conditions as impossible as unjust; whilst it  
  
I was known that these orders would not other¬  
wise cease, but with a war which lasted near¬  
ly twenty years, and which, according to ap-

more; having iiianit&#x27;ested on every ocrjision,  
and in every proper mode, a sincere desire to  
arrest the ettiisiou of blood, and meet our ene*

our beloved country in still opposing to his

Notwith tandlng the es.rlv day which had  
been fixed for you1 &lt;e«sh n r.r ,|ie (,!tv^nt  
year, I was muted call you to tnge ht r.  
still sooner, as well that any intuit quacy in  
tht existing provisions for the wai ts of rhe  
Treasury might lie supplied, as that oo delay  
might happen in providing for the revolt o«  
the negociations on foot with Gfeat Britain, «  
whether it should require arrangements a«  
dapted to a return of peace, or further and  
more effective provisions for prosecuting the  
war.  
  
I hat result is not yet known. If, on one  
hand, the repeat &lt; f the order* in council,and  
the general pacifica* ion in fcur«.pe, which  
withdrew the occasion on which impress*  
iricnts from American vessels were practl*  
srd, suggest expectations ttiae peuct and  
amity may be re»est&amp;blifched j wc are com­  
pelled, on the other hand, by the ri fusel  
of the .British goverrrent to acc&lt; pt tne offer  
#U mediation of the Emperor of Kus-ia. by

by the principles and manner in vhich the  
Hr *» l,f’w avowedlv carried on. to infer  
that a spirit ol hostility it* indulged mere vi  
oient than ever, ag«iOfcl the rights and pros  
pt i.y of this country.  
1 h«» incieased violenre is best explained  
by the two important circumstances, tint  
the great contest in Europe, for an equil­  
ibrium guaranteeing all its s&#x27;a’es against • h»  
ambi(ir,n of any, has been closed without  
a^jr check on the overheating power 01  
&lt;»reat lb .tain nti the«cean; ar.d that it ha*  
left in her hands di«posahlcarmaments, with  
which, forgetting he diflirul ir* ol a remote  
war against a free people; and yielding to  
the intoxicat&#x27;d n ol success, with the exam  
pie of a v&#x27;eat victim to It lie fore her eyes.  
al«e cherished hopes of slid fuiiher aggran­  
d rainy; a power already formidable in it- a  
b sea to the tranquility ef the civil zed anti  
•ommercial world.  
But, whatever may have inspired the ene­  
Tn f with these more violent purposes, the*  
public councils of a nation, more able to main i  
tain than it wastoacquir I - independence. .  
w&gt;d w h !% devotion to it, F^ndertd more ar- &lt;  
dmt bf experience ot u* bleaaiugs, can i  
  
^ever deliberate but on the meant moat ef-1  
icctual fordeteating the extravagant views &#x27;  
or unwarrantable passions, with which alette i  
the war can now be pursued against us. I  
In the event* of the present campaign, the l  
enemy, with all his augmented mean*, and !  
wanton use of then), has little ground for ex ]  
ultation unless he can feel it in the success of  
I &#x27;y* re0ent enter prison, against this Metropo*  
lis, and the neighbouring towttef Alexandria; I  
trom both of which his retreats v. ere as pre­  
cipitate, as his attempts were bold and for*  
t unate. In his other incursions on our Allan  
tic frontier, his progress often checked and  
chastised by the martial spirit of the neigh*  
bouring citizens, has had more eB&#x27;ect in iiis»  
l ressing individuals, and in dishonouring hi  
arms, than in promoting any object of legi­  
iritimatc warfare. And in the two instance*  
mentioned, however deeply to be regretted  
on our part, he * ill find iu his transient sue  
cess, which interrupted for a moment only  
  
v*«&#x27; uiuiim.j |juuuc uusiness at tne seat ot  
government, no comjiensr.tton for the loss of  
character with the world, by hit violations  
ot privae property* and by his destruction of  
public edifices, piotectcd, a&gt;* monuments of  
the arts, by the laws of civilised warfare.  
On our tide we can appeal to a series of  
achievements, which have given new lustre  
to the American arms, beside* the brilliant io  
cidenhi in .the minor operations of the cam  
paign. ihe splendid victories gained oo the  
Canadan side of the Niagara, by the Ameiu  
. can forces under Maj. Gen. Brown, and Brl­  
» Ifadicrs Scott and Games, have gained for  
1 these herocu, and their emulating compani­  
t on-&#x27;, the most tmfadiag laurels; and having  
1 triumphantly tested the progressive disci­  
u *&gt;e American soldiery, have taught  
v the enemy, that the longer he protracts bis  
l tb® more certain and decisive  
will be his final discomfiture­  
  
wu our soutnern border victory has con­  
^*° to follow the American standard  
—- -- &#x27;uuinuio sianuara  
I he bo.d and skilful operations of Maj Gen.  
Jackson, couducting troops drawn from the  
militia of the states least distant, particular •  
ly of Tennessee, have subdued the priori  
pal tribes of hostile savages, and by estab*  
lishing a peace with them, preceded by re*  
cent and exemplary chastisement, has best  
guarded a&amp;amst the mischief oftheir co*on­  
eraiion with the ltritish enterprises which  
may be planned agaiusc that quarter of our  
country. Important tribes of Indians on our  
north western frontier, have also acceded to  
stip ulation* which bind them to the interests  
ot tiie Untied States, and to consider our en*  
emy as theirs also.  
In the recent attempt of the enemy on  
iiecity of U.t.timoie, defended by militia and  
volunteers, aided by a small body of t eg  
ulars and seamen, he was received with a  
spirit which produced a rapid retreat to his  
ship* ; whilst a concurrent attack by a large  
fleet was successfully resisted by the steady  
and well directed fire of the fort and butte*  
ries opposed to it.  
Io another recent attack by a powerful  
force on our troops at Plattsburg, of winch  
regulars made a part ouly, the enemy, after  
a perseverance for many hours, was finally  
compelled to seek safety in a hasty retreat  
with our gallant bands pressing upon him.  
On the Lakes, so much contested through,  
out the war, the great exertions lor the  
command made on our part, have been wed  
repaid. On Lake Ontario cur rquadron is  
now, and has been for some time, in a coudi  
non to confine that of the enemy to his  
port; and to favor the operations of our land  
i forces oq that frontier.  
A part of the squat&#x27;run on Lake Erie ha*  
been extended into Lake Huron, and has  
pooduced the advantage of displaying ou  
command of that Lake also—One object t  
the expedition, was the reduction ot Mack  
maw, which failed with the loss of a fei  
brave men, among when was &amp;(&gt; officer iuai  
ly distinguised for his gallant exploits. Th  
expedition, ably conducted by both the cava  
anti the land .commanders, was otherwis  
highly valuable in its effects.  
Oh Lake Champlain, where our tuperi  
only hod for some time been undisputed, th  
British squ.tdmn lately came into acfios  
with the American, commanded by Captai  
Macdonough It issued in the capture t  
the whole of the enemy&#x27;s ships. The b*t  
praise tor this officer and his intrepid com  
radcs is in the likeness of hi* triumph to th  
illustrious victory, which immortalised ano  
her officer and established, at a critical mo  
meat our command of another Lake.  
On the Ocean th* pride cf our Nava  
arms has been amply supported. A secoiu  
fn fate has indeed fallen into the hands o  
the enemy,t&gt; t the loss is hidden in the bias­  
of her ism with which she was defended  
Captain Porter, who commanded her, «n&lt;  
wnose previous career had been distinguishei  
by d irmg enterprise &amp; bv fertility of gen us  
maintained a sangui,ary contest against twi  
ships, cne of them superior to In* own, ant  
uncer other severe disadvantages, rj|i j,u  
masity o re d&gt; wn the colors, which valor hat  
nailed to the mast. This officer and hisbrav*  
comrades have added much to the rislne  
Sfory of the American fUg, and hrvenieri*  
ie&lt;1 all the effusions of gratitude which their  
country is ever ready to bestow on the cham*  
lions of its rights and of its safftc  
  
I WO smaller vessels of war have also be.  
tome p tjtca to the enemy ; bur by a supe.  
nor.ty of force which sufficiently vindicates i  
toe reputation of their commanders : whilst  
two others, one commanded by Captain  
Warrington, the c*rr by Captain Blakely  
have captured British ships cf the same  
class with a gallantry and good conduct,  
wh.ch entitle them and their companions  
to ajust .hare in the praise of their country!  
In spite of the naval force of the enemy  
accumulated on onr coasts, private eruisrra  
a,so have not ceased to annoy his commerce,  
nd to bring their rich prises into our port, •  
contributing thus with other proofs, to de  
monstrate the ineompetency and illegality  
•f a blockade, the pioclamation of which is  
made the pretext h»r vexing and discutiru­  
Whe commerce of neutral powers with  
the United States.  
I * Tne*t rhe, ex»cnded and diversified  
warfare adopted by the enemy, great bodies  
&#x27;rf militia hare been taken into service  
or ‘he P«Mfc defence, and great expeners&#x27;  
ncurred. 1 hat the defence every where  
may be both more convenient and more tco  
oomital, Congress will see the necessity ,.|  
immediate measures for filling the nnks of  
• he regular army ; and of enlarging the pro  
vision tor special corps, mounted and un&#x27;  
mounted, to he engaged for longer periods of  
service than are due from the militia. I ear»  
neatly renew at the same time, a recommen­  
J*loo for such clang a ml.. sv$rtm of m dtV»  
by classing nod disciplining for the most  
  
prompt and active service the portions moat  
capable of it, will give .to that great resource  
lor the public safety, all the requisite ener«  
Sly and efficiency.  
The monies received into the Treasury  
during the nine months ending on the thirti.  
etb «lay o( Ju ie last, amounted to thirty-two  
millions of dollars, of which near eleven mil  
lions were the proceeds of the pubic revenue,  
*\nd the remainder derived from loans. The  
disbursements for pubic expenditures during  
the saint* oeriod exceeded thirty four millU  
*&#x27;• n dollars, and »eft in the Trexsurv, on  
the first day of July, near five millions of dol  
Jars. The demaud3 during the remainder  
o&#x27; the present, vest* already authorised hy  
Congress, and the ex pence? incident to an  
extension ofths operations nl the war. will  
render it necessity that large sums should  
se provided to meet tlfrm  
  
rruin mis view ot -he national affairs J  
Congress will be ur^ed to take up without  
delay, as well the subjcfct of pecuniary sup.  
plies as that of nritli&#x27;HVv force, and n a scale  
commensurate with the extent and the cha  
racter which the war has assumed• It is  
not to be disguised, thu the situation of our  
country Calls for its greatest efforts. Our e&#x27;  
neniy is powerful in men and in montv&#x27;} on  
»be land and nr the water. Availing himself  
nf fortuitous advantages, he is aiming, with  
his undivided ft ce, a deadly blow at our  
growing prosperity, perhaps at our national  
existence. He has avowed his purpose of  
trampling on tint ttk-igcs of civilized warfare,  
and given earnests of it, in the plun * and  
wanton destruction of private proper./. In  
bis pride of maritime dominion a-id in his  
thirst of commercial monopoly, he strikes  
with peculiar ainmaiv at the progress of  
our navigation and of our manufactures.—  
His barbarous policy has not even spared  
those monument* of the arts and models of  
taste, with which our country had enriched  
and embellished its infant Metropolis.  
&gt; roin such at} adversary, hostility in its great­  
est force awl its worn forma, may be looked  
for. The American people will face it with the  
undaunted spirit which in our revolutionary  
jj1 defeated his unrighteous projects.—^—  
*f* threats and barbarities, instead of dismay,  
will kindle in every bosom an inuignation uot  
to be extinguished but in the disaster and ex.  
pulMvn of such cruel invaders. In prov ding  
the means necessary, the National Legislature  
will not distruit the heroi^ and enlightened pa­  
triotism of its consiituents. They will cheer­  
fully and proudly bear every burden of every  
kind, which the safety and honor of the nation  
demand. We have seen them every where pay­  
ing their taxes, direct and indirect, with the  
greatest promptness aiuf alacrity. We see  
them rushing with enthusiasm to the scenes  
*;here dang- r and duty call. In offering their  
blood, they give the surest pled;,., that no oili­  
er tribute will be withheld.

Waskington City, Tuesday, Sept. 20, 1814.  
This Day the PRESIDENT of the United  
States.transmitted to Congress, by Mr. Edw.  
Coles, his Secretary,&#x27;the following g  
l | MESSAGE.  
Fellasw Citizens of the Senate and of the  
‘ House of® Representalives,  
Notwithstanding the early day which had been  
fixed-for your session of the present year, I was  
induced to call you together still sooner, as well  
that any inadequacy in. the existing provisiom:  
for the want of the treasury might be supplied, ax  
that no deiay might happen in providing for the  
result of the negociations on foot with Great Bri­  
tain, whether it should require arrangéments a­  
dapted toa return of peace, or iarther and more  
effective provisions for prosecuting the war. -  
~ The result is not yet known. If, on ome hand,  
the repeal of the orders iu couucil, and the gener­  
al pacification of Europe, which withdi¢w the  
&#x27; occasion on which impressments from American  
-vessels were practised snggested expectaiions that  
- peace and. amity may be re-establishaed ; we are  
compelled, ou the other hand, by the refusal of  
the British government to accept the offered me­  
diation of the Emperor of Russia, by the delays  
in giving effect, to-its own proposal of a direct  
negotiation .;and above all; by the prineiple:  
and manner in Which the war is now avowedly  
carried on, to infer that a spirit of hostility is  
indulged more violent than &#x27;ever, against the  
rights and prosse_rit.y of this country.  
This inereased violence is best explained by  
two important citcumstances, that the great cen­  
test in Eanrope, for an equilibrium guaranteeing  
all its States against the ambition of any, has  
been closed without any check on the overbear­  
ing power of Great Britainon the ocean; and  
that it has left in.her hands disposable arma­  
ments, With which, forgetting the difficulties of a  
temote war against a free people ; and yielding  
to the intoxication of success, with the example  
of a great victitl to it before her eyes, she cher­  
“ishes hopes of still ‘further aggrandizing a ‘power  
alveady formidable in its abuses to the tranguil­  
ity of the civilized and eommetcial world.  
But whatever may have inspired the: enemy  
‘with these more violent purposes, the public coun­  
cils of a nation, niore able to maintain than it  
was to acquire its independence, aund with a de­  
votion to it, rendered more ardent by the expe­  
(‘?“Eé‘OHW,W cir never “deliberate but  
on the mean: most effectual for defeating the ex­  
travagaut * views or&gt; _ﬁi}j(‘gr«ahmlﬂl passions,  
with_which alone the war can now be: pursued:  
agßinat Wi N 70T e Uiy o B  
In the events of the present campaign, the ene­  
my, with all his atgmented nieans, and wanton  
‘use of them, has little ground for exultation,  
unless he can feel&#x27;it in the success of his recent en­  
terprizes against this metropolis and the neigh­  
boringtown of ‘Alexandria ; from both of which

_On the southern border victory has continued

and skillul operations of Maj. Gen. Jackson,  
éonducting troops drawn from the militia of the  
siates least distant, particularly of Tennessee,  
bave subdued the principal tribes of hostile sav­  
ages; and by establishing &amp; peace with them pre­  
ceded by recent and exemplary chastisement,  
has 1&amp;t guarded agminst the mischief of their  
co-operation with the British enterprises which:  
may be planned aghinst that quarter of oar  
country. Importani tribes of Indians on enr  
north western frontier have also acceded to stip­  
w&#x27;aiivns, waich bind them to the interests of the  
: l};nited States and to counsider our enemy as theirs  
alsd, | :  
In the recent attempt of the enémy on the city  
of Baltimoure, défended by wilitia gad volunteers,  
aide.d by a small body of regtars and seamen,  
he was ieceived with &amp; spirit which produced a  
rapid reiveat to his thips, whilst a coucurrent  
atiack by a large fleet was successfully vesisied  
by the steady and well directed site of the fort  
aud batteries opposed to it, : ;  
In another recent attack by a powerful force  
Gu our troops at Platrsburgh, of which regulars  
madie a pare only, the enemy afier a peisever­  
ance for many hours, was finally compelled to  
seck safety in a hasty retreai, with oar gal  
lant bands piessing upon him. i  
On the Lakes, so much contested through­  
out the war, the great exertions for the com­  
mand made on our part have been well re­  
p:d. Onlake Ontario, our squadron is now  
and has bees for some time iu.a condition 1o  
confine that of the enemy to his own port,  
snd ¢ fuvor the operations of our land forces  
on ih«t frontier. S &#x27; :  
A part of the squadron on L. Erie hasbeen  
exwended to L. Huron, and has produced the  
&amp; ivantage of displaying our command on that  
lake also. Qune ouject of the expedition was  
the reduction of Mackinaw, which failed  
with ithe loss of a few brave men, aaiong  
whom was an officer justly distinguished for  
his gallant exploits. The expedition ably  
conducted by beth the land and naval com­  
manders, was otherwise valuable in its  
effects. &#x27; ,  
On Lake Champlain, where our superior­  
ity bud for some time heen undiiputed the  
British squadron lately came into actiop  
w:th the American, commanded by Captain  
M’Donough. It issued in the capture of the  
wholc of the evemy&#x27;s ships. The best praise  
of this officer and hia intrepid cumrades, is  
in the likeness of his triamph to the iliusiri.  
ous victory which iffimortalizrd amother offi.  
cor, and established at &amp; criiical momeant,  
our command of another lake.  
~ On the Ocean, the pride of our naval arms  
has. been amply supporied. &quot;A second frigate  
has indecd fallen into the hands of. the enemy,  
but the .loss is hidden in the blaze of heroism  
with which she. was delended. Capt. Porter,  
who eommanded her, and whose previous ca­  
reer had been distinguished by daring enterprise  
and by a fertility of genius, maipiained a san­  
guinary contest against two ships, one of them  
stperior to his owm, &amp; under other severe disadvan­  
tages, till humanity tore dowan the colors which  
valor had pailed to the mast. This officer and  
his brave /comindes have udded much~to the  
rising glory of the American fiag, and bave  
merited all the effusions of gratitude which their  
country is ever ready to bestow om the champi­  
ons of its rights ani of its safety. 5  
Two smauller vessels of warpave alsg become  
prizes to the enemy, but by a snperiority of  
force which sufficiently vindicates the reputation  
of their commanders; whilst two otbers, one  
commanded by Capt. Warrington, the other by  
Capt. Biakely, have captured British ships of  
the same ciass, with a gailantiy and good con­  
dnct, which entitle them and their eompanions  
to a just share of the praise of their country.  
In spite of the naval force of the enemy accu­  
milated on our coasts, our private craisers also  
have ndt ceased to annoy his commerce, and td  
bring rich prizes into our ports; contributing  
thus, with-other &#x27;proofs, to demonstrate the in­  
competency and the illegality oi a blockade,  
the proclamation of which is made the pretext  
for vexing and discouraging ‘the commerce of  
neutral powers with the United States. &#x27;  
To meet the extended and diversified warfare  
adopied by the encmy, great bodies of militia  
have Leen taken into service for the public de­  
fence, and great expenses incuired. That the  
‘delence every where may be both more conven­  
ient and wore economical, Congress will see the  
necessity of immediate measures for flling the  
ranks of the regular army ; and of enlarging the  
provisions for special corps, mounted and un­  
mounted, to he engaged for longer periods of  
service than are due from the militia. I earnest­  
ly renew at the same time, &amp; lecommendation of  
such ¢hanges im the system of militia;, as by  
clas:ing and diseiplining for the most prompt  
and active service the portions most capable of  
ity will give to that great resource for the public  
rafety, all the requisite energy and efficiency.  
- The monies received into the Treasury during  
the 9 months ending on the 13th day of June last,  
amounted to 32 millions of dollars, of which 11  
millions were the procecds of the public revenue,  
and the remainder derived from loans. The  
disbarsements for &#x27; public expenditures during  
same period exceeded 34 millions of dollars, and  
left in the Treasury, on the Ist-day of July, near  
five mitlions of dollars. The demands daring  
the remainder of the presemt year already au­  
thorised by Congress, and the expenses incident  
to an exiention of the operations of ‘the war,  
will render it necessary that large sums should  
‘be: ?novidéd*to meet them.. .~ .. .. ¢  
-~ From this view of the national affairs, Con­  
gress will be urged to take up without delay, a­  
well the subject of pecunmiary supphies as that  
of military force, and on a scale commen­  
surate with the extent and character which the  
war has assumed. It is not to be disguised, that  
the situation of our couniry callsfur ils greatesi  
efforts. Qurenemy is powerful in men and mo­  
_Bey; on the land and on the water. Availng  
himself of fortuitous circumstances, he is aiming,  
with an undivided force, a deadly blow at our  
growing prosperity, perifaps ai our national ex­  
-Istence.~~He has avowed his purpose of tramp­  
ling on the usages of civilized wartare, and given  
earnests of it, in the plunder and ‘wanton-de­  
struction of private property. In his pride of  
muaritime dominion, and in his thiist of cops­  
‘mercial monopoly, he strikes with_ peculiar ani­  
mosity at the progress of W*ﬁiﬁg’dﬂoh and of  
our manufactures. His barbarous policy had  
not even-spared those monuments of taste, with  
‘which our couniry had enriched and embellish­  
-ed its infant metm em;e G  
~ From suchan adversary, hostility in its greates,  
seated his unightenus projects. His threats and  
“his barba will Kindie in  
‘ed but in the disu:ter and expulsion of such cruel  
  
invaders. TYn providirg the wetrs tmysiﬁ  
the Natioral Legislature will not distrmst th§  
enlightened patriotism of it constituents. - They  
will cheerfully and proudly bear every burden  
of every kind, which the safety and homour of  
the pation demand.” We have seen them every  
where paying taxes, direct and indirect, withthe  
greatest promptness and alacrity. We see themt -  
rushing with enthusiasm to scenes where danger  
and duty call. Inoffering their blood, they give  
the surest pledge that-no other tribute wili be  
withheld. , &#x27;  
Having forborne to declare waruntilte other  
aggressions had been added the capture of nearly  
a thonsand American vestels, and the impresmens  
of thousands of American sea-faring citizens, and  
‘putil 2 final declaration had beer made by the  
govarnment of Great Britain, that her hostile or-  
Jders against our commerce would not be revoked  
bat un conditions as impossibic as unjust ; whiist  
it was known that these orders would not other.  
wise cease,hut with a war which had lasted nearly  
20 years; &amp; which, according (0 appeaiances at  
that time, might last as many more : having  
manifested on every cccasion, and in every pio­

of Lilood, and meet cur enemgn the ground of  
Jjustice and reconcilation, our beloved cCOuntTy In

NEWPORT, WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBILR 28, 1814.  
  
In apoiber rcce&#x27;.k attack by a po;  
{orce on our “troops at Platisborg, of b  
regulars made a part oniy,the enemy, alter a  
perseverance for many hours, was fnally  
compelled 10 seek salety in a hasty retrsat,  
with our gallant bands pressing upon him.  
On the Lakes so moch contestea through­  
oul the war the great exertions for the com­  
nend made on our part have been well repaid.  
Da Lake Qutario, oar squadron is now, and  
nas been for sumetime,inacondirion to confine  
hat of the enemy to his ewa port; and to  
favor the operations of our land force on that  
Croutier. &#x27;  
  
A part of the squidron on Lake Erie, has  
been extended to Loke Huron, and has pro­  
~tuced the advaniage of displaying our com-.  
nand of that Lake also. One object of the  
~xpedition was the reduction of Mackinaw,  
whicn failed with the loss of a few brave men,  
&#x27;mong whom was an officer justly distinguish­  
ot for mis gallant exploits. The expedition,  
biy conducted by boitn the land and naval  
commanders,was ctherwise valuable in iws ef­  
teCts. |  
  
On Lake Champlain, where our superiori­  
ty had for sume time been undisputed, the  
British squadron lately came into action with  
he Aimnerican, commanded by Captain Mac­  
tonough. It ‘issued in the capiure of the  
whole of the cuemy’s snips.—=The best praise  
tor this officer and his intrepid comrades, is  
in the ikeness of {\in trvumph to the illustri-  
Jus victoy which immortialized another offi  
very and establisned at a critical moment, out  
commind of another Lake  
  
On the ocean the pride of our naval arms  
has Been amply supported. A second frigate  
nas indeed fallen into the hands of the enemy.  
out the loss is hidden in the blaze of heroisin  
vith which she was defended. Capt. Porter,  
vao commanded her, and whose previous ca­  
reer had been distinguished by daring enter­  
puize and by fertility of genivs, maintained a  
sangutnary contest against two ships, one of  
thein supecior to his own, and under oiher se­  
vere disadvantages,till huinanity tore dowao the  
colors, which wvalor had nailed to the mast.  
Pois officer and his bravé comrades have ad-  
Jed much to the rising glory of the American  
flagy, and bave merited ail the effusions of  
giatitude which their country is ever rcady  
o bestowv on the champions of its riglits and  
ol its safery,  
V&#x27;wo smaller vessels of war have also be.  
come piiacs to the enemy, but by a superior­  
&#x27;y of force which sufficiently vindicates the  
  
cpwaton of thelr commonders 3 whilst two  
aheig, one commanded by Cupt. Warritig­  
ony the otlier by Caplaid Blakely, have cap­  
ared British ships of the same tlass, with a  
salleniy and gooud conduct which entitle lb&amp;.

o spite of he aaval force of the enemy  
occuadiated on our coasis, our private cruis­  
. 9 4iso bove uot ceased to annoy his com­

Y ot a blockade, the proctamation of which is  
made the pretext lor vexiog and and. discou­  
, raging the commerce ol neuiral powers with  
“the Unhed States.  
  
&quot; To meet the extended and diversified war­  
fare udopted by the enemny, great bodies of  
militta uave been taken ingo service for the  
oublic delences, and great ‘c&#x27;lxpencct incurred,  
I hat the delence every where may be both  
more convenient and economical, Congress  
will see the necessi&#x27;y of immediate measures  
  
e fithing the ranks of the regular army ; and  
ol enlarging the provision for special corps,  
mounted and unmounted, to be engaged for  
onger periods ol service than are due from  
e miiniia. 1 earnestly renew at the same  
ime, a recomm: ndatton of such changes in |  
no system of militia, as, by classing and dis­  
ciplming for the most ptompt and active ser­  
viee, the portions most capable ol it, will give  
to that great resource for the public safety, all  
he reqaisite energy and efficiency.  
I&#x27;ne monies received into the Treasury  
dunng the mne manths ending on the 13th  
day of June last, amounted to thirty-two mil­  
lions of dollars, of which eleven millions were -  
the proceeds of the public revenue, and the .  
  
emainder decived from loans. The dis­  
hi:sements for public expenditurés during  
he same period exceeded thirty-four millivns  
of dollars. Tne demands duriog the remain­  
ler of the present year alreadgy&#x27; authorized  
  
vy Congress, and the expences incident to an  
  
‘xtension of the operations of the war, will  
rcader it necessary that large sums should be  
proviied to meet them,  
  
From this view of the national affairs Con­  
gress will be arged to take up without delay,  
is well the subject of pecuniary sapplics as  
that of military force, and on a scale commen­  
arate with the extent and character which  
he war has assumed. [t is not to be dis.  
gutsed, that the sttuation of our country calls  
i Its greatest efforts, Our enemy is power­  
il 1o men and money 1 on the land and on  
e water. Availing himiself of furtuiions ad­  
vantages, he is aiming, with an undivided  
ircey &amp; deadly blow to our growing prosper­  
y. perhaps to our national existence. He  
is avowed bis purpose of trampling on the  
1-ages of civilized warfare, and given earn­  
sis of ity 10 the plander and destruction of  
vivate property. [ln his pride of mariiime  
ymimon, and in his thirst of commercial  
nonopoly he strikes with peculiar animosity  
it the progress of our ll&quot;r‘.:ﬁoll and of our  
manufacturers.  
  
His barbarous policy has not even spared  
those monuments of aste, with which our  
couniry bad enriched and embeliished its in­  
fant metropolis. From such an adversary,  
hostility ip its greatest force and in its worst  
forms, may be looked for. The American  
people will face it with the undaunted spirit  
which in their revolutionary struggle defeat­  
ed his unrighteous projects. His threéats  
and his barbarities, insteatl of dismay, will  
kindle in every bosorh an indignation oot 1o  
be cxtinguished but in the disaster and ex­  
pultion of such cruel invaders. In providing  
the means necessary, the National L egislature  
will oot distrust the herowc and enhightencd  
patriotism of its constituents. They will  
cheerlully und proudly bear every vurden of  
every kind, waich the safety ahd honor of the  
nation demand. We have seen them every  
where paying their taxes, direct, and indirect,  
with the greatest promptoess and alacrity,  
We see them rushing with eothusiasm to  
the scenes where danger and duly cail. In  
offering their blood they give the surest  
pledge that no other tribute wall be withheld.  
Having forborne to declare war until 10 other ag­  
gressions had been added the capture of nearly  
thousund Amercican vesscls, and the impressment  
of thousands of American seufaring® citizens, and  
watil &amp; final declaration bud been wade by the s:v­  
ernment of Great Britiun, that her hostile orders  
against our commerce, would not be revoked; but on  
conditions as impossible as unjust ; whilst it was  
known that these o ders would not otherwise cease,  
but with 2 war which had lasted nearly (wenty  
years, and which, according to appearunce ut that  
time, might last as muny more; having manifested  
on every occasion, and in every proper mode, « sin­  
cere desjre to arrest the effusion ot biood, snd meet  
our encmy ou the ground of justica and reconcilias

ISotwiiiiKiandi&amp;g the early d&lt;vy which had  
been fixed for your session of the present  
year, 1 was in :tl ed to call you together,  
siiil sooner, as well that any inadequacy in  
t ie existing provisions for the wants of the  
Treasury might be supplied, as that no de­  
lay might happen in providing for the re  
suit of the negotiation on foot with Great  
Britain ,whether it should require arrange­  
ments adapted to a return of peace, or fur­  
ther and mqye effective provisions for pro­  
secuting tl e war.  
&#x27;Foe result is not vet known. If, on one  
hand, the repeal of the orders in coum il,  
ani the general pacification in Europe, j  
which withdrew the occasion on which im I  
pressments from American vessels were !  
practised, suggest expectations that peace  
and amity may be reestablished; we are  
compelled on the other hand, by the refu  
sal u the British government to accept the  
offered mediation of the. Emperor of Fi is  
sia, by tt;c delays in giving effect to its  
own [ reposal of a dire.&#x27;I negotiation ; and  
above all, by the principles and manner in  
which the war is now avowedly carried on.  
to infer that a spirit of hostility is indulged  
more violent than ever, against the rigats  
and prosperity of this country.  
Thus increased violence is best explained  
by the two important circumstances, that  
i. e g; eat contest in Europe, for an equili­  
brium guaranteeing all its stutes against  
the ambition of any, has been closed with  
out any check on the overbearing,power of j  
Great-Britain on the ocean ; and that it  
has left in her hands disposable armaments,  
with which, forgetting the difficulties of a  
remote war against a free people, and yield­  
ing to the intoxication of success, with the  
example of a great victim to it hefo;e J.er  
eyes, she cherishes hopes of still further  
aggrandizing a power already formidable  
in its abuses to the tranquility of the ci­  
vilized end commercial world.  
But, whatever may have inspired the  
enemy with these move violent purposes,  
the public councils of a nation, more able  
to maintain than it was to acquire its inde  
pendence, and with a devotion to it, ren  
derod move ardent by the experience of its I  
b»essiugs, can never deliberate but on the j  
| means most effectual for defeating the ex- j  
iravagant views or unwarrantable passions,  
with wiiich alone the war can now be pur­  
sued against us.  
In tue events of the present campaign,  
the enemy, with all his augmented means,  
and wanton use of them, has little ground  
for exultation unless lie can feel it in the  
success of his recent enterprises against this  
Metropolis, and the neighboring town of  
Alexandria ; from both of which his re­  
treats were as precipitate, as his attempts  
j were bold and fortunate. In his other in­  
curaions on our Atlantic frontier, his pro  
t gress often checked and chastised by the  
martial spirit of the neighboring citizens,  
has had more effect in distressing individu  
als, and in dishonoring his arms, than in  
promoting any object of legitimate warfare.  
And in the two instances mentioned, how­  
  
ever deeply to be regretted on our part, he  
will find in his transient success, which in­  
terrupted for a moment only the ordinary  
public business at the seat of government,  
no compensation for the loss of character  
with the world, by his violations ot private  
property, and by his destruction of public |  
edifices, protected as monuments of the  
arts, by the laws of civilized warfare.  
On our side we can appeal to a series of  
achievements, which have given new lustre  
to the American arms. Besides the bril­  
liant inci ients in the minor operations of  
the campaign, the splendid victories gain­  
ed on the Canadian side of the Niagara, by  
the American forces under Major General  
Brown, and Brigadiers Scott and Gaines,  
have gained for these heroes, and their e  
mu kiting companions, the most unladed  
laurels; and having triumphantly tested  
the progressive discipline of the American  
soldiery, have taught the enemy, that the  
longer l.e protracts his hostile efforts, the  
more certain and decisive will be his final  
discomfiture.  
On our southern border, victory has con­  
tinued al-o to follow the American stan­  
dard. &#x27;Plie bold ami skilful operations of  
Major General Jackson, conducting troops  
drawn from the militia of the states least  
distant, particularly of Tennessee, have  
subdued the principal tribes of hostile sa­  
vages, and by establishing a peace with  
them, preceded bv recent and exemplary  
chastisement, lias best guarded against the  
mischief of their cooperation with the  
British enterprises which maybe planned  
against that quarter of our country. Im­  
portant tribes of Indians on our north wes­  
tern frontier, have also acceded to stipula­  
tions which bind them to the interest of the  
United States, and consider our enemy as  
theirs aiso.  
In the recent attempt of the enemy on  
the city of Baltimore, defended by militia  
and volunteers, aided by a small body of  
regulars and seamen, he was received with  
a spirit which produced a rapid retreat to  
his chips ; whilst a concurrent attack by a  
large fleet was successfully resisted by the  
steady and well directed fire of the fort and  
batteries opposed to it.  
In another recent attack by a powerful  
force on our troops, at Plattsburg i, of  
which regulars made a part only, the ene  
mv, after a perseverance for many hours,  
was finally compelled to seek safety in a  
hasty ic?rent, with our gallant bands pres­  
sing upon him.  
On the Lakes, so much contested through­  
out the war, the great exertions for the  
command made on our part, have been  
well repaid. On Lake Ontario our squad  
ron is now, and has been for some time in  
a condition to confine that of the enemy in  
his own port; and 10 favor the operations  
of our land forces on that frontier.  
A part ot the squadron on Lake Erie  
has been extended into Lake Huron, and  
has produced the advantage of displaying  
our command of that Lake also. One ob  
j-i-t of the expedition was the reduction of  
Mackinaw, which failed with the loss of a  
few bravo men, among whom was an offi­  
cer jusdy distinguished for his gallant ex­  
. ioits. The expedition, ably conducted by  
both the land arid the naval commanders,  
was at demise highly valuable in its effects.  
On Lake Champlain, where our superi­  
ority had for some time been undisputed,  
the British squadron lately came into ac­  
tion with the American, commanded by  
Captain Macdonowgh. It issued in the  
capture of the whole of the enemy’s ships.  
Tuc bast praise for this officer and his in­  
trepid comrades is in the likeness of lii*&gt;  
triumph to the illustrious victory, which  
immortalized another officer, ande&amp;tabifth  
edat a critical moment, our command of  
another Lake.  
On the ocean the pride of our naval arms  
has been amply supported. A second frig  
ate has indeed fallen into the hands of the  
enemy, but the ioss is hidden in the blaze  
of heroism with which she was defended.—  
Captain Porter, who commanded her, and  
whose previous career had been distinguish­  
ed by daring enlerprize and by fertility of  
genius, maintained a sanguinary contest a-»  
gainst two sfiips, one of them superior to  
his own, and under other severe disadvan­  
tages, till humanity tore down the colors  
wtiich valor had nailed to the mast. This  
officer and his brave comrades have added  
much to the rising glory of the American  
lhg, and have merited all the effusions of  
gratitude which their country is ever ready  
to bestow on the champions of its rights  
and of its safety.  
Two smaller vessels of war have also be­  
come prizes to the enemy ; but by a super­  
iority of force, which sufficiently vindicates  
the reputation of their commanders-, whilst  
two others, one commanded by Captain  
I Warrington, the other by Captain Blakely,  
have captured British ships of the same  
class, with a gallantry and good conduct,  
which entitle them, and their companions,  
to a just share in the praise of their coun­  
try.  
In spite of the naval force of the enemy  
  
I ^9  
accumulated on our coast, our private  
cruisers also have not ceased to annoy his “\
commerce, and to bring their rich prices  
into our ports; contributing thus, with o­  
thcr proofs, to demonstrate the incompe­  
tency and illegality of a blockade, the  
proclamation of which is made the pretext  
for vexing and discouraging the commerce  
of neutral powers with the United States. _  
To meet the extended and diversified  
warfare adoptod by the enemy, great bodies &lt;;  
of militia have been taken into service for  
the public defence, and great expenses in­  
curred. That the defence every where  
may lie both more convenient and more  
economical, Congress will see the necessi­  
ty of immediate measures for filling the  
ranks of the regular army, and of enlarg­  
ing the provision for  
Jo (jC &#x27;  
er periods of serviefe than are due from the  
militia. I earnestly renew, at the same  
time a recommendation of such changes in  
the system of the militia, as by classing  
and disciplining for the most prompt and  
active service the portions most capable of  
it. will give to that great resource for the  
public safety all the requisite energy and  
efficiency.  
The monies received into the Treasury  
during the nine months ending on the  
thirtieth day of June last, amounted to  
thirty-two millions of dollars, of which  
near eleven millions were the proceeds of  
the public revenue, and the remainder de­  
rived from loans. The disbursements for  
public expenditures during the same period  
exceeded thirty-four millions of dollars, and  
left in the Treasury, on the first day of  
July, near five millions of dollars. The  
demands during the remainder of the  
present year already authorised by Con­  
gress, and the expenses incident to sn ex­  
tension of the operations of the war, will  
render it necessary that largo sums should  
be provided to meet them.  
From this view of the national affairs,  
Congress will be urged to take up, without  
delay, as well the subject of pecuniary sup­  
plies as that of military force, and on a  
scale commensurate with the extent and the  
character which the war has assumed. It  
is not to be disguised, that the situation of  
our country calls for its greatest efforts.—  
Our enemy is powerful in men anti money;  
on the land and on the water. Availing  
himself of fortuitous advantages, he is aim­  
ing with his undivided force, a deadly blow  
at our growing prosperity, perhaps of our  
national existence, lie has avowed his pur­  
pose of trampling on the usages of civilized  
warfare, and given earnests of it, in the  
plunder and wanton destruction of private  
property. In his pride of maritime domini­  
on aud in his thirst of commercial monopo­  
ly, he strikes with peculiar animosity at the  
progress of our navigation and of our manu­  
factures His barbarous policy has not e­  
ven spared those monuments of the arts  
aud models ot taste, with which our coun­  
try had enriched and embellished its infant  
Metropolis. From such an adversary, hos­  
tility in its greatest force and in Its worst  
forms may be looked for. The American *  
people will face it with the undaunted spi­  
rit, which in our revolutionary struggle  
defeated his unrighteous projects. j[5i*  
threats and his barbarities, instead of dis­  
may, will kindle in every bosom an indig­  
nation not to be extinguished but in the  
disaster and expulsion of such cruel inva­  
ders. In providing the means necessary,  
the National Legislature will not distrust  
the heroic and enlightened patriotism of its &gt;  
. onstituents. They will cheerfully and  
proudly bear every burden of every kind  
which tho safety and honor of the nation  
demand. We have seen them everywhere  
paying their taxes, direct aud indirect, with  
the greatest promptness and alacrity. We  
see them rushing with enthusiasm to the  
scenes where danger and duty call. In of­  
fering their blood they give the surest pledfc »  
that no other tribute will be withheld.  
Having forborne to declare war until to  
other aggressions had been added the cap­  
ture of neaily a thousand American vessels,  
and the impressment of thousands of Ame­  
rican sea faring citizens, and until a final  
declaration had been made by the Govern­  
ment of Great Britain, that her hostile or­  
ders against our commerce would not be re­  
voked, but on conditions as impossible as  
unjust; whilst it was known that their or­  
ders would not otherswise cease, but with a  
war which had lasted nearly twenty years,  
and which, according to appearances at  
that time, might last as many more; hav­  
ing manifested on every occasion, and in  
every proper mode, a sincere desire to ar­  
rest the effusion of blood, and meet our ene­  
my on the ground of justice and reconcilia­  
tion, our beloved country, in still opposing  
to his persevering hostility all its energies,  
with an undiminished disposition towards  
peace and friendship on honorable terms,  
must carry with it the good wishes of the  
impartial world, and the best hopes of sup­  
port from an Omnipotent and kind Provi­  
dence.

the enemy, that the longer be protracts  
his hostile efforts, ,the more certain  
ind decisive will be his final discom­  
fiture .- y -  
On our southern border victory has  
continued also to folbw the Ameri­  
can standard. ; The bold and &#x27;skilful  
operations of .Major General Jackson, j  
copaucting troops drawn from the mi­  
litia oftho states least distant, parti  
cularly of Tennessee, have subdued  
the principal, tribes of hostile savages.  
and, by establishing a rpeace with  
them, preceded by recent and exem  
plary chasUsemmt, has best guarded  
atratnst.the mischief of their co-ope  
ration (with the British enterprizes  
whrchjmay be planned against that  
qdarter ot our country Impirtan.  
tribes .of Indians on our north wes  
tern frontier, have also acceded to  
stipulations which bind them to the  
interests ot the United States, and to  
consider our enemies as theirs also  
In the recent attempt-of the enemy  
on thexity&#x27;of Baltimore, defended by  
militia and volunteers,. aided by. h  
smalt body of regulars and seamen, he  
was received with a spirit which pro  
duced; a rapid retreat to his ships ;  
whilst a concurrent attack by a large  
fleet was successively resisted by the  
steady and well directed fire of the  
fort and batteries opposed to it  
In another recent attack by a pow­  
erful force on our troops at Plattsburg,  
ot which regulars made a oart, only,  
the enemy, after a perseverance for  
many hours, was finally compelled to  
seek safety in 1 4hasty retreat,with our  
gallant bands pressing upon him.  
On the .Lakes, so much contested  
throughout the war, the great exer­  
tions for the command made on our  
part, have been well repaid. On Lke  
Ontario our squadron is now, and has  
been for some time, m a condition to  
confine that of the enemy to his own  
port ; and to favor the operations of  
our land forces on that frontier  
; A ; part of the squadron on Lake,  
Erie l has been; extended into Lake  
Huron, and has produced the advan  
tage; of displaying our command of  
that Lake also (Joe object ot the  
expedition was the reduction of Mac  
inaw, which&#x27;failed, with the loss of a  
few.brave men, among whom was an  
officer justly distinguished for his gaU  
iaot exploits. The expedition, ably  
conducted by both tbe land and the  
naval commanders, wis otherwise  
highly valuable in its effects.  
On Lake Cham plain, where jour  
superiority had for some time been  
undisputed, the British squadron late-  
I v came into action, with the Ameri  
can, commanded by Captain Macdo­  
nough. It issued in the&#x27;eapture of  
the. whole of the eoemy,s ships. The  
best praise t r this officer and FuV in­  
trepid comrades is, in the likeness of  
his triumph to the illustrious&#x27; victory,  
which immortalized another officer,  
and established, at a critical moment,  
our command of another Lake &#x27;J V  
Oa the Ocean the pride of our Na  
vaj arms has been amply supported.  
A second frigate has indeed fallen in­  
to the hands of the enemy,&#x27; but the  
loss is hidden in the blaze of heroism  
with which the was dcTended. Capu  
Porter,v who commanded her,&quot;.&#x27; and

filling the ranks of the regular army ;  
and of enlarging the provision for  
special corps, mounted and unmount­  
ed, to be engaged for longer periods  
of service than are due from the mili  
tia. I earnestly renew, at the same  
time, a recommendation of such chan- &#x27;  
ge in the system r f.the militia, as by  
classing and disciplining for the most  
prompt and active service the portions  
most capable of) it, will give to that  
great resource for the public safety,  
all the requisite energy and efficiency  
The monies received into the Trea­  
sury during the nine months ending  
00 the thirtieth day of June last, a­  
roounted to thirty-two millions of dol­  
lars, of which near eleven millions  
were the proceeds of the public&#x27; re­  
venue, and the remainder derived  
from loans. The disbursements for  
public expenditures during the same  
period exceeded, thirty-four millions  
of dollars, and left in the Treasury,  
on the first day of July, near five mil­  
lions of dollars J The demands dur­  
ing the remainder of the present year  
already authorised by Congress, and  
the expences incident to an extension !

PRESIDENTS MESSAGE.  
Tuesday, Sept. 20,  
1 o&#x27;clock, P. M.  
This duy the President of the  
United States transmitted to Con­  
gress, by Mr. Edward Coles his  
Secretary, the following message :  
Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and  
cf the House of Representatives.  
Notwithstanding the early day  
which had been fixed for your  
session ol the present year, I was  
induced to call you together, still  
sooner, as well that any inadequa­  
cy in the existing provisions for  
the wants of the Treasury might  
be supolied, as that no delay  
might happen in providing for  
the result of the negotiations on  
foot with Great Britain, whether  
it ahouid require arrangements a­  
daptedtoa return of peace, or  
further and more effective provi­  
sions for prosecuting the war.  
That result, not yet known.  
If, on one hand, the repeal of the  
orders in council, and the general  
pacification in Europe, which  
WlUtUi - .  
l.. American  
,mpreS5men .  
esscls were pracuseu, .u5bw  
expectations tnai peace auu  
may be reesttblisned ; we arc  
compelled, on the other hand, by  
the refusal of the British govern,  
ment to accept the -offered medi­  
ation of the Emperor of Russia,  
  
by the&quot;dela s in giving effect to  
  
its own proposal ot a direct ne­  
gotiation ; and, above all, by the.  
principles and manner in which  
the war is now. avowedly carried  
on, to iofert hat i spirit &#x27; o ? Kbl.  
tilityis indulged more violent  
than ever, against jhe rights and  
prosperity of this country.  
This increased violence is best  
explained by the two important  
circumstances, that the great con­  
test Europe, for An equilibrium  
guaranteeing all its states against  
the ambition of any, has been clo  
sed withoqtancheck on the o­  
verbearmg power of Great Bri­  
tain on the ocean ; and that it  
has left in her hands disposable  
armaments, with which, forget­  
ting the difficulties of a remote  
war against a, free people ; and  
yielding to the intoxication of  
.t&#x27; . V 1 n  
success, wun ine example 01 a  
great victim to it before her eyes,  
she cherishes hopes of still fur­  
ther aggrandizing a power already  
formidable in its abuses to the,  
tranquility of the civilized and  
commercial world.  
But whatever may have inspi  
red the enemy with these more  
violent purposes, the pubhc coun  
cils of a nation, more able to main&#x27;!  
tain th in it vas to acquire its in­  
dependence, and with a devotion  
to it, rendered more ardent bv  
the experience vf its blessings,  
can never d--iiber..tt but on the  
means most effectual lor defeating  
the extravagant vieW-i or unwar­  
ranUbie passions, wita which a  
lone the war can now be pursued  
against us.  
In the events of the present  
campaign, the enemy, with all his  
augmented means, and wanton  
use of them, has little ground for  
exultation, unless he can feel it in  
the success of his recent enter-  
prizes against this Metropolis and  
the neighboring town of Alex  
andria ; from both of which his  
retreats were as precipitate, as his  
attempts were bold and fortunate.  
In his other incursions on our At  
Untie frontier, his progress, often  
checked and chastised, j by the  
martial spirit of the neighboring  
citizens, has had more effect in  
distressing individuals, j and in  
dishonoring his arms, tlnh in pro­  
moting any object of legitimate  
warfare. And in&#x27;the two instan-  
ces mentioned- however deeply  
1.0 be: regretted on our part, he  
wi.i had, in his transient! success,  
which interrupted for a j moment  
only the ordinary publicfbusiness  
ness at the seat of government,  
no compensation for the loss of  
character with the world, by his  
violations of private property, and  
by his destruction of public edi-  
ficts, protected as monuments of  
the arts by the laws of : civilized  
warfare.  
On our side we can appeal to a  
serious of achievements, which  
have given new lustre to the AV  
merican arms. Besides; the bril  
liant incidents in the niiuor ope  
rations of the campaign, the splen­  
did victories gained on the Cana  
dian side of the Niagara,by the A­  
mericau forces under Major Ge  
nerai Brown, and Brigadiers  
Scott and Gaines, have gained  
for these heroes, and their emu­  
lating companions, the most un­  
fading laurels ; and having tri­  
umphantly tested the progressive  
discipline of the American sol­  
diery, have taught the enemy that  
the longer he protracts his hostile  
efforts, the more certain and de-  
Icisive will be his anal discomfi  
ture. H  
On our southern border victofy  
has continued also to I follow the  
American standard- The bold and  
skilful operations of MlvjorGenc­  
ral Jackson, conducting troops  
drawn from the militia of the

gainst the mischief of their co -  
  
operation with the British enter­  
prize which may be, planned a­  
gainst that quarter of our country.  
Important tribes&#x27; of &#x27;Indians on our  
north western frontier have also  
acceded to stipulations, which  
bind them to the interests of the  
United States, and to consider  
our enemy as theirs also. f  
In the recent attempt of thl  
enemy on the city of Baltimore,  
defended bv militia and volun­  
teers, aided by a small body ot  
regulars and seamen, he was re­  
ceived with a spirit whidi produ­  
ced a rapid retreat to his ships,  
whilst a concurrent attack by a  
large fleet was successfully resis­  
ted by the steady and well direc  
ted fire of the fort and batteries  
opposed to it.  
In another recent attack by a  
powerful force on our troops at  
Piatt sburg, of which regulars  
made a part only, the enemy, after  
a perseverance for many hours,  
was finally compelled to seek safe­  
ty in a hasty retreat, with our gal  
  
lant bands pressing upon him. A  
! On the lakes so much contes­  
ted throughout the vur, the great  
exertions for the command made  
on our part, have be n well repaid.  
On lake Ontario our 6quadron is  
now, and has been for some time  
in a condition to contine that ot  
the enemy to his own port 1 and  
to favor the operations of our  
land forces on that frontier.  
A part of the squadron on Lake  
Erie has been extended into Luke  
Huron, and has produced the ad  
vantage of displaying our com  
mand of that lake also One ob­  
ject of the expedition, wathe  
reduction of Mackinaw, which  
failed with the loss of a few brave  
men, among whom was an officer  
justly distinguished for his gal­  
lant exploits. The expedition a­  
bly conducted by both the land  
and the naval commanders, was  
otherwise highly valuable in its  
effects.  
Oh Lake Champlaln, where  
our superiority had lor some time  
been undisputed, the British  
squadron lately came into action,  
with the American commanded  
by Captain Macdonough. It is  
sued in the capture of the whole  
of the enemy&#x27;s ships. The best  
praise Tor this officer and his in­  
tripid comrades is in the likeness  
of his triumph to the illustrious  
victory, which immortalized a­  
hother officer and established, at a  
critical moment, our command of  
another Lake.  
On the Ocean the pride of our  
Naval arms has been amply sup  
ported. A second frigate has in­  
deed fallen into the hands of the  
enemy, but the loss is hiddenHn  
the blaze of heroism with which  
she 3as defended. Captain Por­  
ter, who commanded her, and  
whose previous career had been  
distinguished by daring enter­  
prize and by fertility of genius,  
maintained a sanguinary contest  
agiinst two ships, one of thtm su  
perior to his own, and under oth-  
er severe disadvantages, till hu­  
nanity tore down the colors,  
which valor had nailed to the  
mast. This officer and his brave  
comrades have added niuch to  
the rising glory of the American  
flag, and have merited all the ef­  
fusions of gratitude which their  
country is ever ready to bestow  
on the champions &quot;of its rights and  
its safety.  
Two smaller vessels of war  
have also become prizes to the  
enemy ; but by a superiority of  
force which sufficiently vindicates  
the reputation of their comman­  
ders ; whilst two others, one com  
manded bv Captain Warriogton,  
the other by Capt. Blakelv, have  
captured British shipsnbTtHesame  
class, with a gallantry and good  
conduct, which&#x27; entitle them and  
their companions, to a just share  
in the praise of their country  
In spite of the naval force of  
the enemy accumulated on our  
coasts, out private cruisers also  
1 have not ceased to annoy his com-  
  
  
merce, and to bring their rich pri­  
zes into our parts ; contributing  
thus, with other proofs, to de  
monstrate the incompetency and  
illegality of a blockade, the procla  
  
mation ol which is made the pre-  
textfor vexing and discouraging &#x27;  
  
the commerce of neutral powers  
with the United States  
To meet the extended. and di­  
versified warfare adopted by the  
enemy, great bodies of miliri .  
have been taken iuto servicefor  
the public defence, and great es  
pences incut red. 1 hat the de &quot;  
fence even where mjy. be both  
more convenient and &#x27;mBre eco?  
nomical, Congress will see the ne­  
cessity of immediate measures  
for filling the ranks of the regu  
lar army ; and of enlarging the ,  
provision for speci al corps, moun­  
ted and unmounted, to be eng.;  
ged for longer periods offscrvice-N  
than are due from the militia. I  
earnestly renew, at the same time,  
a recommendation of such chan­  
ges in the system of milafa, as,  
by classing &amp; ditiplining for the  
most prompt &amp; active serv ice the  
portions most capable of it, will  
give to that great resource for  
the public safety, all the requisite  
energy and tfficiency.  
The monies received into the  
Treasury during the nine months  
ending on the thirtieth day of June  
last, amounted to thirty two mil­  
lions of dollars, of which near e­  
leven millions were the proceeds&#x27;  
of the public revenue, and the re­  
mainder derived from loans. The  
disbursements for public expendi­  
tures during the same period ex­  
ceeded thirty four millions cf dol-lars,  
and left in the Treasury on  
the first day of July, near fiv  
million of dollars. 1 he demands  
during the remainder of the pre  
sent year&quot; already authorised Lv  
Congress, and the expencea inci  
dent to an extension of the (ope  
ations of the vr, will reiider k  
necessary that large sums shouhl  
be provided to meet them.  
From this view of the nation 1  
affairs, Congress will be und  
take up without delay, as w L  
the suujact of pecuniary supplier  
us mat 01 military force land oti  
a scale commensurate with the ex­  
tent and the character which the  
I T.&#x27;  
war nas assumed, it is not to oe  
disguised, that thdl situation of  
our country calls for its grates-:  
efforts. Our enemy is poerful  
iu men ana in money ; on ine lant!  
and on the water. Availing him  
  
self of fortuitous advantages, hry ( &#x27;  
is aiming, with his undivided Hl  
force, a deadly blow at our grow- &#x27;y  
ing prosperity, perhaps at ohr na- T ,  
tional existence. He has aiowed &#x27; J  
his purpose of trampling.in the  
usages of civilized warfare, and s  
given earnests of it, in the plun .  
der and wanton destruction of pri &#x27; v  
vate property. In his plide of 5  
  
i  
iiiuutuiv uwuiiuiwu dUQ ID ni&amp;  
thirst of commercial monopoly, &#x27;  
he strikes with peculiar  
  
ity at the progress of pur na-  
vigation and of our manufdetures. &#x27;  
His barbarous policy; tias not I :  
even spared those monuments of , .  
  
me ana ana moaeis ot tastrj with -  
which our country had enriched  
and embellished its infant Metro- i  
polis. From such an adversary, I  
hostility in its greatest force antrj  
in its worst forms, may be looked v  
for. The American people will&quot;,  
face it with the undaunted spirit  
which in our revolutionary strug-!  
gle defeated his unrighteous pro-  
jects. His threats and his bar­  
barities, instead of dismay, will  
kindle in every bosom an indigna-  
tion not to be extinguished but ii i  
tne disaster and expulsion of su h  
cruel invaders. In nrovMIn- h- &#x27;

“ The result,” says he, “ is not yet known.  
If, on one hand, the repeal of the Orders in  
Council, and the general pacification in Europe,  
which withdrew the occasion on which im-  
pressments from American vessels were prac-  
tised, suggest expectations that peace and  
amity may be re-established ; we are compel-  
led, on the other hand, by the refusal of the  
British government to accept the offered me-  
diation of the Emperour of Russia, by the de-  
lays, in giving cficct to its own proposal of  
a direct negotiation ; and above all, by the

“ This increased violence,” continues the  
President, “is best explained by the two impor-  
tant circumstances, that the great contest in  
Europe, for an equilibrium guaranteeing all  
its states against the ambition of any, has been  
closed without any check upon the overbear-  
ing power of Great-Britain on the ocean ; and,  
that it has left in her hands disposeable arma-  
ments, with which, forgetting the difficulties  
of a remote war against a free people 5 and  
yielding to the intoxication of success, with  
the example of a great victim to it before her  
eyes, she cherishes hopes of still further ag-  
grandising a power, already formidable in its  
abuses to the tranquillity of the civilized and

tion of publick edifices, protected as monuments  
of the arts, by the laws of civilized warfare:  
  
On our side we can appeal toa series of a-  
ehievermnts, which have givennew lustre to  
the Americanarms. Besides the brilliant in-  
cidents in the mimor operations of the cam-  
prign thesplendid victories gained on the Cun-  
adian side of the Niagara, by the American  
forces under Major. General Brown, and  
Brigadiers Scott and Gaines, have gained fer  
these heroes, and their emulating comp:znions,  
the most unfadins lanrels ; and having trium-  
phantly tested the progressive discip!ine of the  
American soldicry, have tavent the enemy,  
tht the longer he protracts his hostile efforts,  
the more certain and decisive will be bis final  
discomfiture.  
  
On our Southern border victory hascontinu-  
edatsc to follow the American standard. ‘The  
bold and skilfal cperations of Maj. Gen. Jack-  
son, conducting troops drawn from the militia  
of the states least disiant, particularly of ‘Ten-  
nessee, have subdued the principal tribes of  
hostile savages, and by establishing a peace  
with them preceded by recent and exempla-  
ry chastisement, has best guarded against the  
mischief of their co-operation with the British  
enterprizes which may be planned against that  
quarter of our country. Important tribes of  
Indians on our North Western frontier have  
also acceded to stipulations, which bind them  
to the interests of the United States, and to  
consider our enemy as theirs also.  
  
In the recent attempt of the enemy on the  
city of Baltimore, defended by militia and vol-  
unteers, aided by a small body of regulars and  
seamen, he was received with a spirit which  
produced arapid retreat to his ships, whilst a  
concurrent attack by a large fleet was success-  
fully resisted by the steady and well directed  
fire of the fort and batteries opposed to it. ,  
  
In another recent attack by a powerful force  
onour troops at Plattsburgh, of which regu-  
Jars made a part only, the enemy, after a per-  
severance for many hours, was finally com-  
pelled to seek safety in a hasty retreat, with our  
gallant bands pressing upon him.  
  
On the lakes, so much contested throughout  
the war, the great exertion for the command  
made on our part, have been well repaid. On  
Lake Ontario, cur squadron is now, and has  
been for some time, in a condition to confine  
that of the enemy to his own port; amd to fa-  
vourthe operations of cur land forces on that  
frontier,  
  
A part of the squadron on Lake Erie has  
been extended into Lake Huron, and has pro-  
duced the advantage of displaying our com-  
miand of that lake also.—-One object of the ex-  
pedition, was the reduction of Mackinaw,  
which failed with the loss of afew brave men,  
among whom was 2n cfficer justly distinguish-  
ed for his gallant exnioits. ‘The expedition  
ably conducted by both the !and and the naval  
cominanders, was otherwise highly valuable  
in its effects,  
  
On Lake Champlain, where our superiori-  
ty had for some time been undisputed, the  
British squadron lately came into action, with  
the American, commanded by captain Mac-  
donough,. It issued in the capture of the whole  
  
  
  
r 110 Y  
  
ofthe enemy’s ships. The best praise for  
this officer and his intrepid comrades is in the  
likeness of his triumph to the ilustrieus victo-  
ry, which immortalized another officer, and  
established, at a critical moment, our com-  
mand of another lake.  
  
On the ocean the pride of of our naval arms  
has becn amply supported. A second frigate  
has indeed fallen into the hands of the enemy,  
but the loss is hidden in the blaze of heroism  
‘with which she was defeade?. Capt. Porter,  
who commanded her.and whose previouscar-  
eer had been distinguished by daring enicr-  
prize and by fertility of genius, maintaineda  
sanguinary contest against two ships, one of  
them superiour to his qwn,’and under other  
severe disadvantages, tifl humanity tore down  
the colours, which valour bad nailed to the  
mast. ‘Khis officer and his-brave comrades  
have added munch to the rising glory ofthe A-  
merican flag, &amp; have merited all the effusions  
of gratitude which their country is ever ready  
to bestow on the champions ofits rights and of  
its safety.  
  
T&#x27;wo smaller vessels of war have also be-  
come prizes to the enemy ; bu! by a superior?-  
  
?  
  
ty of force which sufficiently vindicates the re-  
putation of their commanders ; whilst two o-  
thers, ene commanded by capt. Warrington,  
the other by capt. Blakely, have captured  
British ships of the same class, with a gallant-  
ry and good conduct, which entitle them and  
their companions, to a just share in the praise  
of their country.  
Inspiteofthe naval forceof theenemy accum-  
ulated onour coasts, our private cruisers also  
have not ceased to annoy h&#x27;s commerce, and  
to bring their rich prizes into our ports , con-  
tributing thus, with other proofs, to demon-  
strate the incompetency and illegality of a  
blockade, the proclamation of which is made  
the pretext for vexing the commerce ofneutral  
wers with the United States. ;  
  
To meet the extended and diversified war-  
fare adopted by the enemy, great bodies of  
militia havewbeen taken into service for the  
publick defence, and great expences incurred.  
That the a every where may be both  
more convenient and economical, Congress  
will see the necessity of immediate measures  
for filling the ranks ofthe regular army ; and  
of enlarging the provision for special corps,  
mounted aad unmounted, to be engaged for  
longer periods of service than are due from the  
militia. I earnestly renew, atthe same time,  
a recommendation of such changes in the sys-  
tem of militia, as by classing and disciplining  
for the most prompt and active service the  
portions most capable of it, will give to that  
great resource for the publick safety, all the re-  
guisite energy and efficiency.  
  
The monies. received into the treasury dur-  
ing the nine months ending on the thirtieth  
day of June last, amounted to thir!y-two mil-  
lions of dollars, of which near eleven millions  
were the proceeds of the publick revenue, and  
the remainder derived ‘from —loans.—  
The disbursements for publiek expenditures  
during the same period exceed thirty-four mil-  
Vons of dollars, and leftin the treasury, on the  
first day of July, pear five millions of dollars,  
  
  
  
The demands during the remainder of the pre.  
sent year already authorised by Congress, &amp;  
the expences ineident tean extension of theo.  
perations of the war, will render it necessary  
ii large sums should be provided to’ mect  
them.  
  
From this view of the national affairs, Con.  
  
gress will be urged to take up without delay, as  
  
well the subject of pecuniary supplies as that of  
a military force, and ona seale commensurate  
with the extent and the character which the  
  
war bas assumed. It is not to be disgnised,.  
  
that the situation of our country calls fer its  
ereatest eflorts. Our enemy is powerful in  
men and money ; on the land and on the wa.  
ter. Avvailing himselfoffortuttous advantages ;  
he is aiming, with his undivided force, adead-  
ly blow_at our growing prosperity, perhaps at  
eur national existence. He has avowed his  
purpose of trampling on the usages of civilized  
warfare, and given earnests of it, in the pion.  
der and wanton destruction of private proper-  
tv. fi his pride of maritime dominion and in  
his thirst of commercial monopoly, he strikes  
with peculiar animosity at the progress of our  
navigation and of our manufactures. His bar-  
barous policy has not even spared those monu-  
ments of the arts and models of taste, with  
which our country had enriched andembeilish-  
ed its infant metropolis. From such an adver.  
sary, hostility in its greatest force and in its  
worst forms, may belooked for. The Ameri-  
can people will face it with the undaunted spirit  
which in their revolutionary struggle defeated  
his unrighieous projects. His threats and his  
barbarities, instead of dismay, will kindle in  
every bosom an indignation not te be extin-  
guished but inthe disasterand expulsion ofsuch  
cruel invaders. In providing the means neces-  
sary, National Legislature will not distrust the  
heroic and enlightened patrictism of its constit-  
vents. They will cheerfully and proud!y bear  
every burden of every kind, which the safety  
and honour of the nation demand. We have  
seen them every where paying their taxcs, di-  
rect &amp; indirect,. with the greatest promptness  
and alacrity. Wesee them rushing with en-  
thusiasm to the scenes wher edenger and duty  
call. In offering their blood they give the  
surest pledge that no other tribute will be with-  
held.  
  
Having forborne to declare war until to  
other aggressions had been added the capture  
of nearly a thousand, American vessels and  
the impressment of thousands of American sea-  
faring citizens ; and until a final declaration  
had been made by the government of Great  
Britain, that her hostile orders against our  
commerce would not be revoked, but on con-  
ditions as impossible as unjust ; whilst it wes  
known that these orders would not otherwise  
cease, but with a war which had lasted nearly  
twenty years, and which according to appear-  
ances at that time might last as many more ;  
having manifested on every oceasion, and in  
every proper mode, a sincere desire to arrest  
the elfusion of blood, and meet cur enemy on  
the ground of justice and reconciliation, our be.  
loved country, in still opposing to his per-  
severing hostility all its energies, with an un-  
diminished disposition towards peace &amp; friend

whert our luperiority had for  
•on&gt;e tinie been undisputed, the British  
squadron lately came into action with the  
American, curomauded by Cwptnin Macdo-  
nough; it issued ^ in the capture of the  
whole of the enemy&#x27;s, ships. The best  
praise of tiiis olTicer and liis intrepid com¬  
rades is in the likeness of his triumph to the  
illustrious victory which immortalised ano¬  
ther officer, and estahhshed, at a critical mo¬  
ment, our command of another lake. On  
the ocean, the pride of our naval arms has  
been amply supported ; a second frigate has  
indeed fallen into the hands of the enemy,  
but the loss is hidden in the blase of heroism  
with which she was defended. Capi. Por¬  
ter, who commanded, her, and whose pre¬  
vious career had been distinguished by da¬  
ring enterprise and by fertility of genius,  
uiaintuined a sanguinary contest against tuo  
ships, one of them superior to his own, and  
other severe disadvantages, till humanity  
tore down the colours which valour had  
nailed to the mast. This officer and his  
comrades have added much to the glory of  
the American flag, ami have merited all the  
effusions of gratitude which their country is  
ever ready to bestow on the champions of  
its rights and of its safety.  
  
Two smaller vessels of war have also bc-  
•oroe prizes to the enemy, hut by superio¬  
rity of force, which sufficiently vindicates  
the reputation of their Comiuandeis ; whilst  
two others, one coiuinaiided by Cajit. War¬  
rington, the other by Capt. Blakely, have  
captured British ships of the same class with a  
gallantry and good conduct, which entitle  
them and their Commanders to a just share  
in the praise of their country.  
  
In spite of the naval forces of the enemy  
accumulated on our coasts, our private Crui-  
cers also have not ceased to annoy his com¬  
merce, and to bring their rich prizes into  
our ports; contributing thus, with other  
proofs, to demonstrate the incompetency  
and the illegality of a blockade, the pru-  
claniation of which has been mede the pre¬  
text for vexing and discouraging the com¬  
merce of neutral powers with the United  
StQttS.  
  
. &#x27;J&#x27;o meet the extended and diversified  
warfare adopted by the enemy, great bo¬  
dies of niihtia have been taken nilu the ser¬  
vice of the public defence, and great expen¬

more economical. Congress will sec the  
necessity of immediate measures of filling  
the ranks of the regular army, and enlar¬  
ging the provisions fur special corps, mount¬

lunger period of service than is due from  
the miluia. -I earnestly renew at the same

A part of the squadron on Lake Erie baa  
been extruded to Lake Huron, and has pro¬  
duced the advantage of displaying our  
command of that Lake also. One object of  
the expedition was the reduction of Mack-  
inau, which failed, with tbe lost of a few  
brave men, among whom was an officer dit-  
tinguished fur his gallant exploits i and the  
expedition, ably conducted by both land  
and naval commanders, was otherwise va¬  
luable in its effects.

The monies received into the Treasury, du¬  
ring the nine months ending the I54h of  
June last, amounted to 3:1 millions of dollars,  
of which 11 millions were the |&gt;risceeds of  
the public revenue, and the remainder de¬  
rived Iruin loans. The disbursements for  
Public Expenditures during the same period  
exceed 34 millions of dollars, and left in  
the Treasury, on the 1st of July near fivo  
iiiillions of dollars. • ^  
  
The demands during the remainder of the  
present year already authorised by Congress,  
and the ex|&gt;ences incident tu an extension  
of the operations of the war, will render it  
necessary that large suras siiould be provided  
to meet them. From this view of the nati¬  
onal affairs. Congress will be urged to take  
up without delay, as well the subject of  
pecuniary supplies, as that of military force,  
and on a scale commensurate with the ex¬  
tent and character which the war has as¬  
sumed.  
  
It is not to be disguised that the situation  
of our country calls for its greatest efforts ;  
our enemy is powerful in men and money,  
on the land and on the water; availing him¬  
self of fortunate circumstances, he is aiming  
with an undivided force a deadly blow at  
our growing prosperity, pethaps at our na¬  
tional existence. He has avowed his purpose  
of trampling on the usages of civilixed war¬  
fare, and given earnest of it in tbe plunder  
and wanton destruction of private property.  
  
In the pride of maritime dominion, and in  
his thirst of commercial monopoly, lie strikes  
with peculiar animosity* at the progress ol‘  
our iiavigaiioii and manufactures: his bar¬  
barous policy bas not even sparad those  
luonumeats of taste with which our country  
had enriched and embellished our infant  
metropolis. From such an adversary, hos¬  
tility in its greatest force and worst forma  
may be looked for. Ilie American people  
will face it with tbe undaunted spirit which,  
in llieir &quot;revolutionary war, defeated his un¬  
righteous projects.; his threats and his bar¬  
barities, instead of dismay, will kindle ui  
every bosom an indignation not to be extin¬  
guished, but in the disaster and expulsion of  
such cruel invaders. In providing the means  
necessary, the national legislator will nut dis¬  
trust the enlightened patriotism of his con¬  
stituents. They will cheerfully and proudly  
bear every burtbaii uf every kind whka  
  
  
Foreign InielUgenee,  
  
the safety and honour of the nation de¬  
mand.  
  
We have seen tliein every \vhere give  
their taxes, direct and indirect, with the  
greatest proraptntss and fdacrity : we have  
seen them rushing with enthusiasm to scenes  
where danger and duty rail; and odinng  
tlieir hli»od, tliey give their surest pledge  
lliflt no «»ilier tribute will be withheld.  
  
Having lortx^rii to declare w’ur until to  
other aggressions had been added the cap¬  
ture ot iKHrly lOOO American vessels, and  
the imjiressiiient of thousands of seafaring  
cilir.ens, and until a final declaruiion had  
heeii made hy the Government of Great  
llritain, that her hostile orders against our  
ccmimerce would not be revoked, hut on  
conditions as irnpos^ible as unjust ; wdnlst it  
was known that these orders would not  
otherwise c ease hut with a war, which had  
lasted nearlv 20 years, and which, according  
to appearance at that time, might last as  
many more—ha\ing manifested on every  
occasion and in every proper mode, a sin¬  
cere desire to meet the enemy on the ground  
of justice, our resolution to lieiend our be¬  
loved countr&gt;, and to oppose to the enemy&#x27;s  
persevering hostility all our energy with an  
itndimini’thed disposition towards peace and  
friendship on hoiioiirahle terms, must carry  
with it all the good wishes of the iniparliHi  
world, and the best hopes of support from  
an omnipoteiit and kind Providc&#x27;nce.

Principles and manner in which the war is

forgetting the difficulties of a remote war  
against a free people, and yielding to the in-  
toxication of success with the example of a great  
victim to it before her eyes, she cherishes hopes  
of still further aggrandising a Power already  
formidable in its abuses tothe tranguillity of the  
civilized and commercial world, But whatever  
may have inspired (ie enemy with these more  
violent purposes; the public councils of a nation,  
more able to maintain than it was to acquire  
its independence, and with a devotion ww it  
rendered more ardent by the experience’ of  
its blessings, can never deliherate but on the  
means most effectual for defeating the extrava~  
gant measures of uuwarrantable passion, with  
Wiich alone the war can now he pursued against  
u. In the events of the present Campaign, tie  
enemy,with all hisaagmented means, and wanton  
use of them, has little ground for exuliation, ua-  
less he can feel it in the success6f his recent en-  
terprizes against this Metropolis and the neigh-  
bouring towns of Alexandria, from both of which  
his retreat was as, precipitate as his attempts  
were bold andforiunate, In his other ineur-  
sions on our Atlafftic frontier, his progress, often  
checked and chastised by the martial spirit of  
the neighbouring citizens, has had more effect  
in distressing individuals, and in dishonouring his  
arms, than in promoting any object of legitimate  
warfare; and in the tno instances mentioned,  
however deeply to be regretted on our part ip  
his transient success, which interrupted for a  
moment only the ordinary public business at the  
seat of Government, no compensation can ac-  
crue for the loss of character with the world by  
this violation of, private preperty, and his de-  
struction of public edifices, protected as mony-  
ments of the arts by the Jaw of civilized war-  
fare.—On our side we cai’ appeal to a series of  
achievements, which have givco new lustre to the  
American arms, besides the brilliant incidents in  
the minor operations of the campaign, the sples.-

Niagara, by the American forces under r Major-  
General Brown, aud Brigadiers Scott an  
Gaines, have gained for these heroes and their,  
emulating companions the mostunfading laurels,  
and having triumphantly provedthe progressive  
discipline of the American soldiery, have taught  
the enemy, that the longer he protracts his hos-  
tile efforts, the more certain and decisive will  
be his final discomfiture. On the southern bor-  
der, victory has continued also to follow the  
American standard. The bold and skilfal apes

recent and exemplary chastisement, we have  
guarded against the mischief of their co-opera-  
tion with the British enterprises, which may be  
planned against this quarter of our country.—  
Important tribes of Iudians on our north-west-  
ern frontier, have also acceded to the stipula-  
tions whicd hinds them to the interest of our  
United States, and to consider our enemy as  
theirs also. In the recent attempts of the enemy  
on Baltimore, defended by militia and volun-  
teers, aided by a small body of reguiars and  
seamen, he was received with a spirit which  
produced a rapid retreat to the ships, whilst a  
concurrent attack by alarge fleet was succes:fal-  
ly resisted by the steady and well-directed fire  
ofthe fort and batteries opposed to it.  
ther recent attack bya powerful force on our  
troops at Plattsburg, of which regulars made a  
  
In ano-  
  
part only, the enemy, after a perseverance for  
many hours, was finally compelled toscek safety  
ina basty reireat,our gallant bands pressing upon  
him, —On the Lakes, so much contested throuzh-  
out the war, the great exertioas for the com-  
maud made on our part bive been well repaid,  
  
on Lake Ontario. Our navy is now and has been |  
  
for some time, in a condition to confine that of  
the enemy to his own port, and to favour the  
operations of our laad forces on that frontier. On  
Lake Champlain, where our supcriority had for  
some time been undisputed, the British squa-  
dron lately came into action with the American,  
commahded by Capt. M‘Donough. Tt ended in  
the capture of the whole of the enemy’s slips.  
The best praise of this officer and his intrepid  
comrades, is in the likeness of bis triumph  
to the illustrious victory which immortalized  
another Oficer, and established, at a critical  
moment, our comman! of another Lake.  
Oa the Ocean, the pride of our naval arms has  
Deen amply supported. A second frigate has  
indeed fallen into the hands of the enemy, but  
the loss‘is hidden in the blaze of heroism with  
whieh she was defended. Captain Porter, who  
commarded her, and whose previous career had  
  
  
  
been distinguished by daring enterprise and by  
fertility of genius, maintained a sanguinary con-  
test against two ships, one of them superior to his  
own, and other severe disadvautages, till huma-  
nity tore down the colours which valour had  
nailed to the mast ; this officer and his comrades  
have added much to the glory of the Ame-  
rican flag, and have merited all the effusions of  
gratitude which their couniry is very ready to  
bestow on the champions of its rights and of its  
safety. Two smaller vessels of war have also  
become prizes to the enemy ; but by superiority  
of force, which sufficiently vindicates the tepu-  
tation of their commanders; whilst two others,

by Capt. Blakely, have captured Briti,, shins  
of the same class, with a gallantry and 200 | « BS  
duct which entitled them and their COMpanions  
to a just share in the praise of their country,

have not ceased to annoy his commerce, and ‘  
bring their rich prizes into our paris; cyt.  
buting thus, with other proofs, to demonstrate (iy  
incompetency and the illegality of a blockade,  
the proclamatian of which is made the pretext fur  
vexing and discouraging the commerce of Ney-  
tral Powers with the United States, To meet the  
exteaded and diversified warfare adopted by the  
-enemy great bodies of militia have been taken into  
the service of the public defeace, and great ex.  
pencesiacurred, That the defence every wheie  
may be bath more convenient, and more econoni-  
cal, Congress will see the necessity of immed-  
ate measures for filling the ranks of the regular  
army 3; and of enlarging the provisions for special  
corps, mounted and dismounted,to be engaged lor  
atonger period of service, than are due from the  
militia, Learnestly renew, at the same time,a  
recommendation of such chanzes in the system of  
the militia, as by ciassing and disciplining, on the  
most prompt and uetive service, the portions  
most capable of it, will give to that great re-  
source for-the public safety, all the requisite  
energy and efficiency. A part of the squadron  
on Luke Ege has been extended to Lake Horon,  
and has produced the advantage of displaying out  
command of that Lake also. One object of the  
expedition was the reduction of Mackinac, which  
failed with the less of a few brave men, among  
whom was an officer justly distinguished for his  
gallant exploits, the expedition, ably coa  
ducted by both land and naval Commands,  
was otherwise valuable in its effects. —The mo  
nies received into the Treasury, during the vine  
mouths euding on the 13:h day of Jane las,  
amounted to 32 millions of dollars, of which 11  
millions were the proceeds of the public revenue,  
and the remainder derived from loans, The dix  
bursemenis for public. expenditures during the  
same period exceed $4 millions of dollars; and  
left in the Treasury, on the Ist of July, near five  
millions of dollars, The demands daring the  
mainder of the present year, already authorived  
by Congress, and the expenses incident to a0 ¢*  
tension of the operations of the war, will render  
necessary that large sums should be provided  
to meet them. ‘ ; ;

paragraphs from the message of September 20,  
1814.  
&quot; On our side we can appeal to a series of  
achievements which have given new lustre to  
the American arms. Besides the brilliant in­  
cidents in the minor operations of the cam­  
paign, the splendid victories gained on the Ca­  
nada side of the Niagara ny the American  
forces under Major General Brown and Briga­  
dier* Scott and.Gaines, have gained for those  
heroes and their emulating companions, the  
mo-it unfading laurels. On our Southern border  
victory has continued to follow the American  
standard. The bold and skilful operations of  
Major General Jackson, conducting troops drawn  
from the militia of the States least distant, par­  
ticularly of Tennessee, have subdued the pow­  
erful tribes of hostile savages, and by establish­  
ing a peace with them, preceded by recent and  
exemplary chastisement, nas best guarded against  
die mischief of their co-operation with the Bri­  
tish enterprises which may be planned agaiust  
that quarter of our country. Important tribes of  
Indians on our North-western frontier have also  
acceded to stipulations which bind them to the  
interest of the United States, and to consider  
our enemy as theirs also.  
&#x27;&#x27;In the recent attempt of the enemy on the  
city of Baltimore, defended by militia and vol­  
unteers, aided by a small body of regulars and  
seamen, he was received with a spirit which  
produced a rapid retreat of his ships; whilst a  
concurrent attack by a large Heet was success­  
fully resisted by the steady and well directed  
fire of the fort and batteries opposed to it.  
11 In another recent attack by a powerful force  
of our troops at Plattsburg, of which regulars  
made a part only, theenemv,after a perseverance  
for many hours, was finally compelled to seek  
safety in a hasty retreat with our gallant bands  
pressing upon him.&quot;  
Now the Globe is guilty of falsehood, both  
positive and negative. Mr. Madison was &#x27;&#x27;sum­  
ming up&quot; the events?not of the war, but?of  
the Campaign of 1811. If the Globe bad copied  
the preceding paragraph this would have been  
apparent. That paragraph commences: &#x27;? In  
\ ffie events of the present campaign&quot; \c. and  
goes on briefly to touch upon the successes of  
the enemy?the capture of the Metropolis and  
of Alexandria, and his predatory warfare on our  
coast, and then follows, by w&amp;y of contrast, the  
paragraph which the Globe has quoted. In thi

not even allude lo the operations of General  
Harrison on the Northern frontier. F’rom  
this official record, made at the time, whilst  
the country was still bleeding at every pore,  
and evidently designed to arouse and sustain  
the spirit and energies of the nation, it can-  
not be discovered that there was any such  
officer as Gen. Harrison in the field. The  
President of the United Slates passed over  
in silence all his operations, and seems dis-  
posed to throw the mantle of oblivion over  
both his deeds and his name. To justify  
this statement, we make an extract from  
the message:  
  
“On our side we can appeal to a series of  
achievements wliich have given new lustre  
lo the Ainerican arms. Besides the brilliant  
incidents in the minor operations of tho  
campaign, the splendid victories gamed on  
the Canada side of the Niagara hy the A-  
nicrican forces under Major General Brown  
and Brigadiers Scott and Gaines, have gain-  
ed for those heroes and tiicir emulating com-  
panions the most unfading laurels. On our  
Southern border victory has continued lo  
follow the American standard. &#x27;J&#x27;ho bold  
and skilful operations of Major General  
Jackson, conducting troops drawn from the  
militia of the Stales least distant, particu-  
larly of &#x27;I’cnnesseo, have subdued the pow-  
erful tribes of hostile savages, and by es-  
tablishing a peace with them, preceded by  
recent and exemplary chastisement, has  
best guarded against the mischief of their  
co-operation with the British enterprises  
which may be planned against that quarter  
of our country. Important tribes of Indians  
on our Noitliwcstern frontier have also ac-  
ceded to stipulations which bind them to  
the interest of the United Slates, and to  
con&#x27;ider our enemy as theirs also.  
  
“In the recent attempt of the enemy on  
the city of Baltimore, defended by militia  
and volunteers, aided by a small body of  
regulars and seamen, ho was received with  
a spirit which produced a rajiid retreat to  
liis ships; whilst a concurrent attack by a  
large fleet was successfully resisted by the  
steady and well directed fire of the fort and  
batteries opposed to it.  
  
“In another recent attack by a [lowerful  
force on our troops at Plaltshurgh, of wliich  
regulars made a part only, the enemy, af-  
ter a [lersovei-ance for inuny hours, was  
finally compelled to seek safety in a hasty  
retreat with our gallant bands pressing upon  
him.”  
  
He then proceeds to review, the naval  
actions on the lakes and at sea. It thus ap-  
pears that Mr. Madison, whom Mr. Webster  
now professes lo admire, who was at Ihe  
head of llio Government, and commander&#x27;  
in&#x27;cliicf of tlie army; who a|)pointcd the

The United States forebore to declare war, said he,

contraband of war, British officers had a right to
