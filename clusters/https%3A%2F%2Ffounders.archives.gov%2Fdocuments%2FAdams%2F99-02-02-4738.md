t, by another experiment. If our Ministers should be again insulted, the Justice of our Cause would be more apparent to all Men in Europe as well as America. We should gain time to augment our Navy to provide our Arsenals to fortify our Ports and prepare on all points for the worst. It was thought however most prudent to call a special session of Congress that they might judge for themselves of the Part which they ought to Act and the measures they ought to take to vindicate the national honor and make preparations for the worst. Congress assembled on the 15 of May 1797. The President in his Speech declared that “believing that neither the honor nor the interest of the United States absolutely forbid the repetition of Advances, for securing Peace and friendship with France, he should institute a fresh Attempt at negotiation.” Both

Gentlemen of the Senate  
The Proposition of a fresh negotiation with France, in consequence of Advances made by the French Government, has excited so general an Attention and so much Conversation, as to have given occasion to many manifestations of the Public opinion, from which it appears to me that a new modification of the Embassy, will give more general satisfaction to the Legislature and to the Nation, and perhaps better Answer the purpose We have in View. It is upon this Supposition And with this expectation that I now nominate  
Oliver Elsworth Esqr Chief Justice of the United States  
Patrick Henry Esqr late Governor of Virginia, and  
William Vans Murray Esqr, our Minister Resident at the Hague, to be Envoys Extraordinary and Ministers Plenipotentiary to the French Republic, with full Powers to discuss and settle, but a Treaty, all Controversies between the United States and France.  
It is not intended that the two former of these Gentlemen, shall embark for Europe, untill they shall have received from the Executive Directory, Assurances  
in continuation c.

signified by their Secretary of foreign Relations, that they shall be received in Character, that they shall enjoy all the Prerogatives attached to that Character by the Law of Nations and that a Minister or Ministers of equal Powers shall be appointed and commissioned to treat with them.

Paris The 7th Vendemiaire of the 7th Year of the French Republick, one and indivisible  
The Minister of Exterior Relations to Citizen Pichon, Secretary of Legation of the French Republic near the Batavian Republic  
I have received successively, Citizen, your Letters of the 22d and 22d Fructidor. They afford me, more and more reason to be pleased with the measure you have adopted, to detail to me, your conversations with Mr Murray. These conversations, at first merely friendly, have acquired consistency, by the sanction I have given to them, by my Letter of the Eleventh Fructidor. I do not regret that you have trusted to Mr Murrays honor a Copy of my Letter. It was intended for you only, and contains nothing but what is conformable to the Intentions of Government. I am thoroughly convinced, that should explanations take place, with confidence, between the two Cabinets, irritation would cease, a crowd of misunderstandings would disappear, and the Ties of friendship, would be, the more strongly united, as each Party would discover the hand, which sought to disunite them.  
But I will not conceal from you, that your Letters of the 2d and 3d Vendemiaire just received, surprize me much. What Mr Murray is still dubious of, has been very explicitly declared, even before the Presidents Message to Congress of the 3d Messidor (21 June W.V.M.) last, was known in France. I had written it to Mr Gerry, namely on the 24th. Messidor and 4. Thermidor; I did repeat it to him before he sat out. A whole paragraph of my Letter to you of the 11. Fructidor, of which Mr Murray has a Copy, is devoted to develope still more the fixed determination of the French Government Republic. According to these bases you were right to assert, that whatever Plenipotentiary the Government of the United States might send to France to put an end to the existing differences, between the two countries, would be undoubtedly received, with the respect due to the Representative of a free, independent and powerful nation.  
I cannot persuade myself, Citizen, that the American Government need any further declarations from Us, to induce them, in order to renew the negotiations, to adopt such measures, as would

pondence with Mr Gerry and in my Letter to you of the 11. Fructidor, and which I have herein before repeated in the most explicit manner. Carry therefore Citizen to Mr Murray those positive expressions, in order to convince him of our sincerity, and prevail upon him to transmit them to his Government.

.  
Paris 2 Octr. 1798  
Sir  
On hearing of your late nomination as Commander in chief of the American Armies I rejoice at it, not because I believe the War which that nomination contemplates is yet inevitable and that it will furnish an occasion for a farther display of your military Talents but because it may enable you to exert your influence to a greater effect in preventing the War. By becoming more the Centre of information than you could be in your retirement, you will be better able to judge of the dispositions of both Countries, and to offer such counsels to your own Government as may tend to remove the Obstacles that still oppose themselves to a reconciliation.  
Were you now President of the United States I should not address you this letter; because, not knowing my inclination for the tranquility of a retired life, you might think that I was seeking a place, or had some farther object in view than the simple one of promoting peace, between the two republics. But I hope under present Circumstances that your will believe my motive to be pure and unmixed, and that the Object of my Letter is to call your Attention to the true state of facts.  
Perhaps few men, who cannot pretend to have been in the secrets of either Government, are in a better situation than myself to judge of the motives of both; to assign the true causes and trace out the progress of their unhappy misunderstanding; or to appreciate their present dispositions, pretentions &amp; wishes. I am certain there is none who labors more sincerely for the restoration of harmony upon terms honorable to the United States, and Advantageous to the cause of liberty.  
I will not in this place go over the history of past transactions. It would be of little use. The object is to seize the malady in its present state, and try to arrest its progress. The dispute at this moment may be characterised simply and litterally a misunderstanding. I cannot persuade myself to give it a harsher name, as it applies to either Government. It is clear that neither of them, has an interest in going to War with the other; and I am equally convinced that neither of them has the inclination; that is, I believe the ballance of inclination as well as of Interest on both sides, is in favour of peace. But each Government, though sensible of this Truth with respect to itself, is ignorant of it, with respect to the other. Each believes the other determined on War, and ascribes all its Conduct to a deeprooted hostility. The least they can do therefore under this impression is to prepare for an event, which they both believe inevitable, while they both wish to avoid it.  
But by what fatality is it that a Calamity so dreadfull must be rendered inevitable, because it is thought so? Both Governments have Tongues and both have ears. Whey will they not speak? Why will they not listen? The causes that have hitherto prevented them are not difficult to assign. I could easily explain them, as I believe, to the satisfaction of all parties; and with out throwing so much blame on either Government, as each of them, at present, ascribes to the other. But I will avoid speaking of any past provocations, on either side. The point that I wish to establish in your mind is, that the French Directory is at present sincerely desirous of restoring harmony, between this Country and the United States, on terms honourable and advantageous to both Parties. I wish to convince you of this, and through you the American Government, because that Government, being desirous of the same Thing, would not fail to take such steps as would lead immediately to the object.  
In offering you my proofs of the present disposition on this side, you will permit me to observe that some of them, are from their nature incapable of being detailed, and others improper to be trusted to the casualties of a Letter. But I will mention a few that are ostensible, and, so far as they go, undeniable. First The Directory has declared, that it will receive and treat with any Minister,  
in Continuation e.  
Page 24. 26. 27  
from America, who shall appear to be sent, with a sincere intention of treating and terminating existing difficulties. I have no doubt but this was the intention when the last Envoys were sent; but from some unfortunate Circumstances the Directory did not believe it. Second, As a preliminary it has been declared that in the negotiation there shall be no question of loans of money, or Apologies for offensive speeches pronounced by the Executive on either side. Third, All Privateers Commissions given to Privateers in the West Indies are recalled; and when new Commissions are issued the owners and Commanders are to be restricted under bonds to the legal objects of Capture. Fourth An Embargo, that was laid on American ships, within the Republic in consequence of a report that a War had been begun on the part of the United States, was taken off as soon as it was ascertained, that such War had not been begun. And a new declaration was at the same time sent to America of the Wishes of France to treat. These Facts will doubtless come to your knowledge, through other Channells, before you receive this letter. But there are other facts, which in my Mind are equally clear, though to you, they will be destitute of corroborating circumstances, and must rest on my own information and opinion—1st. That this Government contemplates a just indemnity for spoliations on American Commerce, to be ascertained by Commissioners in a manner, similar to the one prescribed in our treaty with England. 2d. That the Legislation will soon be changed here, with respect to neutrals, and that all flaggs will be put on the footing of the Law of Nations. 3d that a public Agent would have been sent named and sent to Phyladelphia, soon after Mr Gerry’s departure, were it not for Apprehensions that he would not be received have been received. There was a doubt whether the American Government would not have already taken such measures of hostility, as to be unwilling to listen to terms of Accommodation; and the Directory did not choose to risk the chance of seeing its offers refused. 4th. That the Directory considers these declarations and transactions as a sufficient overture on its part; that it has retreated to an open ground that is quite unsuspicious; that a refusal on the part of the American Government to meet on this ground, will be followed by immediate War; and that it will be a War of the most terrible and vindictive kind.  
This, Sir, is my view of the present state of Facts. Should it make that impression on your mind, which I desire, for the sake of humanity that it may, you will judge whether it does not comport with the Independence of the United States and the Dignity of their Government to send another Minister to form new treaties with the

Citizen,  
  
I have fuccelfively received your lctter&lt;-  
of the 2zd and 27th Fructidor. They  
give me reafon to he more and more pleat-  
ed with the courfc which you have taken  
in giving me an account of your conver-  
fation with Mr. Murray. Thefe conver-  
fations, at firft merely friendly, have af-  
fumed a character, by the approbation  
which I transmitted to you, on the nth  
Fructidor. I do not regret that you have  
entrufted a copy of my letter to the ho-  
nor of Mr. Murray. This piece which  
was dedined only for you alone, contains  
nothing but what is conformable to the  
thoughts of the government- I am per-  
feclly Satisfied that when explanations are  
oiiCe made, with confidence, between the  
two cabinets, acrimony will ceafe, a croud  
of niifunderftandings will difappcar, and  
the ties of friendship will become the clo-  
fer ; as on both fides, they will know the  
hand which endeavored to break them.  
  
But I do not conceal from you that your  
letters of the 2d and 3d Vendemaire,  
which I received this moment, furprjfe  
me very much. Of what Mr. Murray is  
doubtful ftill, has been declared very ex-  
plicitly, even before the uieffagc of the  
prefident to congrefs, of the 3d of la.i.  
Meffidor, was known in France. I had  
written it to Mr. Gerry, efpccially, on  
the 24th Meflidor, and the 4th Thermi-  
ior. I repeated it to him, before his de-  
parture. A whole paragraph of the let-  
ter which you have received from me,

which is in Mr. Murray&#x27;s poffehton, is

## [Letters from Paris, to the citizens of the United States of America, on the system of policy hitherto pursued by their government relative to their commercial intercourse with England and France, &c. By Joel Barlow.  1800](https://archive.org/details/bim_eighteenth-century_letters-from-paris-to-t_barlow-joel_1800/page/n34/mode/1up?view=theater)

„ Paris, Oct. 2, 1798.  
  
On hearing of your late nomination as Com-  
mander in Chief of the American armies, I rejoice  
at it; not becauſe I believe the war which this  
nomination contemplates is yet unavoidable, and  
that it will furniſh an occaſion for a farther diſplay  
of your military talents; but becauſe it may en-  
able you to exert your influence to a greater effect  
in preventing the war. By becoming more the  
centre of information than you could be in your  
retirement, you will be better able to judge of  
the diſpoſitions of both governments, and to offer  
  
E 2 ſuch  
  
4  
  
ſuch counſels to your own as may tend to remove  
the obſtacles that ſtill oppoſe themſelves to a re-  
conciliation. | IN 5  
  
Were you now Preſident of the United States, I  
ſhould not addreſs you this letter; becauſe, not  
knowing my inclination for the tranquillity of re-  
tired life, you might think that I was ſeeking a  
  
place, or had ſome other object in view than the  
_ limple one of promoting peace between the two  
  
Republics. But I hope, under preſent circum-  
ſtances, you will believe my motive to be pure  
and unmixed; and that the object of my Letter is  
only to call your attention to the true ſtate of  
facts. 4911 1 101 K  
Perhaps few men, who cannot pretend to have  
been in the ſecrets of either government, are in a  
better ſituation than myſelf to judge of the mo-  
tives of both; to aſſign the true cauſes of their  
unhappy miſunderſtanding; or to appreciate their  
preſent diſpoſitions, pretenſions and wiſhes. I  
am certain that no one labours more ſincerely for  
the reſtoration of harmony, on terms honourable  
to the United States, and: advantageous to the  
cauſe of liberty.  
  
I u ill not in this place go over the hiſtory of paſt  
tranſactions. It would be of little uſe. The ob-  
ject is to ſeize the malady in its preſent ſtate, and  
try to arreſt its progreſs. The diſpute at this mo-  
ment may be characterized ſimply and literally a  
miſunderſtanding. I cannot perſuade myſelf to gi1e  
it a harſher name, as it applies to either govern-  
ment. It is clear that neither of them has an in-  
tereſt in going to war with the other; and J am  
convinced that neither of them has the inclination.  
That is, I believe, the balance of inclination as  
well as of intereſt, on both ſides, is in favour of  
  
peace.  
4 5 But  
  
- ww  
  
1  
  
But each government, though ſenſible of this  
  
  
termined on war; and aſcribes all its conduct to  
a deep rooted hoſtility. The leaſt they can do  
therefore, under theſe impreſſions, is to prepare  
for an event that they both believe inevitable:  
while they both wiſh to avoid it.  
  
By what fatality is it that a calamity ſo dreadfill  
  
  
Both governments have tongues, and both  
  
  
they not liſten? The cauſes that have hitherto  
prevented them are not difficult to aſſign. I could  
caſily explain them, as I believe, to the ſatisfac-  
tion of all parties ; and without throwing ſo much  
blame on either government, as each of them at  
preſent aſcribes to the other. But I will avoid  
ſpeaking of any paſt provocations on either ſide.  
The point which I wiſh to eſtabliſh in your mind  
is, that the French Directory is at preſent ſin-  
cerely deſirous of reſtoring harmony between this  
country and the United States, on terms advan-  
tageous to both parties. I wiſh to convince you  
of this, and through you the American govern-  
ment, becauſe that government, being defirous of  
  
  
as would lead immediately to the object. |  
In offering you my proofs of the preſent diſ-  
poſition on this ſide, you will permit me to ob-  
ſerve, that ſome of them are from their nature  
incapable of being detailed, and others improper  
to be truſted to the caſualties of a Letter. Bur I  
will mention a few that are oſtenſible, and, fo far  
as they go, undeniable, 1ſt, The Directory has  
declared, that it will receive and treat ae any  
miniſter from America, who ſhall appear EW be  
ent  
  
— I TIER 203 —  
  
ap —————  
  
= 2»  
  
ſent with a real intention of treating and termi-  
nating exiſting difficulties. I have no doubt but  
ſuch was the intention when the laſt envoys were  
ſent; but, from ſome unfortunate circumſtances,  
the Directory did not believe it. 2dly, As a pre-  
liminary, it has declared, that in the negociation  
there ſhall be no queſtion of loans of money, or  
apologies for offenſive ſpeeches pronounced by  
the Executive on either fide. zdiy, All com-  
miſſions given to privateers in the Weſt-Indies are  
recalled; and when new commiſſions. are given,  
the owners ard commanders are to be reſtricted  
under bonds to the legal objects of capture. 4thly,  
An embargo that had been laid on American veſ-  
ſels within the Republic, in conſequence of a re-  
port that a war had been begun on the part of the  
United States, was taken off as ſoon as it was afſ-  
certained that ſuch war had not been begun; and  
a new declaration was at that time ſent to America  
of the wiſhes of France to treat “.  
  
Theſe facts will doubtleſs come to your know-  
ledge through other channels before you receive  
this Letter. But there are other facts which in  
my mind are equally clear; though to you they  
will be deſtitute of corroborating circumſtances,  
and muſt reſt on my own information and opt-  
nion: iſt, That this government contemplates a  
Juſt indemnity for ſpoliations on the American

not speak i Why will they not listen ? The  
causes which have hitherto pi evented them  
are not difficult to assign. 1 could e asily ex­  
plain them, as I believe, to the satisfaction of  
both parties, and without throwing so much  
blame on either government, as each of them  
at present ascribes to the other. But I will a*  
void speaking of any past provocation on either  
  
sme. l he point that I wish to establish in  
your mind is, tVat the French Directory is at  
present sincerely desirous of restoring harmo­

on terms honorable and advantageous to both  
parties. J wish loconviiice you of this, and  
through you, the American government, be­  
cause that g Tiitnent being desirous of the  
same thing, would not fail to take such steps  
as Would lead immediately to theobject.  
In offering you my proofs of the present  
disposition on this side, yon will permit me  
to observe, that some of them are from their  
n *•&#x27;*•« incapable of being detailed, and o­  
thcis improper to lie trusted tothe casualties

are ostensible, and so far as they&#x27; go, m deni­  
able. l ira, rhe Directory has declared,  
I that it will receive and treat with any  
I Ulster from America, whosludl appear tube  
front with a siiicerr intention of treating anil  
terminating ei.isttng difficulties. 1 have no  
: doubt but this was the intention when the lust  
, Km oj s were sent; but from some unfortu­  
nate circtimsiam.es, »:ite Directory did not  
| believe it. Second, as a preliminary, it lifts  
|b&lt;en declared, that in the negociution there j  
I shall be no «ju« uion ot loans of money, or  
j apologies tor oftVnsive speeches protinunccd  
j by the executive on cither side. Fluid, all  
j commissions given to privateers in the W.  
! Indies are recalled, sod when new comini.,­  
i sinus are issued, the owners and comman­  
ders are to be restricted, under bonds, to the

go that whs laid on American ships within

dreadful must be retnlcred inevitable be­

French Directory is at present sincereiy  
des rous of restoring harmony between this

cause ihal government being desirous of

jioooservr, thin some of then* are irons

[others improper lo be trusted to the ca­  
sualtics ot a letter. But 1 will mention a.  
few tint are ostensible, and so far as they  
[go, undeniable. First, the Directory has  
i th dared that it will receive and treat with  
| any Minister from America, who shall ap­  
pear to be sent with a sincere intention of  
treating and terminating existing difficul­  
ties. I have no doubt but this was the in­  
tention when the last envoys wire sent)  
hut from some unfortunate circumstances  
the Directory did not believe it. Second,  
ns a p: eliminary, it has been declared that  
in the negotiation there shall he no (juts.,  
t on of loans of money, or apologies tor of­  
fensive speeches pronounced by the exe_  
  
cuuve on either s»ue. I ivru, an commis­

ti. es arc r&lt; called, and when new commis­  
sions are issued, the owners and comin.m­  
dcis are to be restricted, under bonds, to  
the legal object of Capture. Fourth, ar»  
embargo tliat was laid on American sh ps  
within the ttpubhc, in consequence 01 is  
repoit that w^r hud been begun on the  
p:*.rt of the United s*ia»e&lt;«. whs taken oP u»  
scon us it was ascertained that such w «r  
bad not been begun. And a new declara­  
tion was at the s.tine time sent to America,  
of the wishes of France to treat. These  
tacts will doubtless come to your know­  
ledge through other channels, before you  
receive tins letter, ltut there are other  
frtds which in n»y mind are equally clear,  
though to you will be destitute of corrobn,  
rating circumstances und must res&#x27; on my  
own information and op nidi. Is.. That  
this government contemplates a just in­  
demnity for spoliations on Armiicun c&gt; wi­  
nterer, to be ascertained by cotnnii*: toners  
in a manner similar to the oar prescribed  
in our ticaty with England. 2d, That the  
legislation will Siam be changed t ere with  
respect to neutrals, and that all fUgs will  
be put on the footing of the law ot nations.  
2d, That a public agent would have btvn  
named and sent to Philadelphia soon utter  
Mr. CJcrry’s depiTrturc, were it not lor the  
apprehensions that he would not have b**er»  
recived. There was n doubt whether the  
American government would not have al­  
ready taken such measures ol hostility as  
to be uuwilhng to listen to terms ot accom­  
modation, and the directory did not choose  
to risk the chance of seeing its offers re­  
fused. 4th, That the Directory considers  
these declarations and transactions ns a suf­  
ficient overture on its part. That it has  
letreated to an open ground that is quite  
unsuspicious. That a refusal onthepnrtof  
the American government to meet on this  
ground, will he followed by immediate war,  
land that it will br a war of the most tern*  
ble and vindictive kind.  
This, sir, is my view of the present state  
of facts. Should it make that impression  
on your mind, which 1 desire for the sake  
of humanity that it may, you will judge  
whether it does not comport with the in- y  
dependence of the United States t&gt;nd the  
dignity of their government, to send ano­

equally convinced that neither of them had the in  
dilution ; that is, ,1 believe the balance of inclina
