[31 October 1785]  
I. Whereas Almighty God hath created the mind free; that all attempts to influence it by temporal punishments or burthens, or by civil incapacitations, tend only to beget habits of hypocrisy and meanness, and are a departure from the plan of the Holy author of our religion, who being Lord both of body and mind, yet chose not to propagate it by coercions on either, as was in his Almighty power to do; that the impious presumption of legislators and rulers, civil as well as ecclesiastical, who being themselves but fallible and uninspired men, have assumed dominion over the faith of others, setting up their own opinions and modes of thinking as the only true and infallible, and as such endeavouring to impose them on others, hath established and maintained false religions over the greatest part of the world, and through all time; that to compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves, is sinful and tyrannical; that even the forcing him to support this or that teacher of his own religious persuasion, is depriving him of the comfortable liberty of giving his contributions to the particular pastor, whose morals he would make his pattern, and whose powers he feels most persuasive to righteousness, and is withdrawing from the ministry those temporary rewards, which proceeding from an approbation of their personal conduct, are an additional incitement to earnest and unremitting labours for the instruction of mankind; that our civil rights have no dependence on our religious opinions, any more than our opinions in physics or geometry; that therefore the proscribing any citizen as unworthy the public confidence by laying upon him an incapacity of being called to offices of trust and emolument, unless he profess or renounce this or that religious opinion, is depriving him injuriously of those privileges and advantages to which in common with his fellow-citizens he has a natural right; that it tends only to corrupt the principles of that religion it is meant to encourage, by bribing with a monopoly of wor[l]dly honours and emoluments, those who will externally profess and conform to it; that though indeed these are criminal who do not withstand such temptation, yet neither are those innocent who lay the bait in their way; that to suffer the civil magistrate to intrude his powers into the field of opinion, and to restrain the profession or propagation of principles on supposition of their ill tendency, is a dangerous fallacy, which at once destroys all religious liberty, because he being of course judge of that tendency will make his opinions the rule of judgment; and approve or condemn the sentiments of others only as they shall square with or differ from his own; that it is time enough for the rightful purposes of civil government, for its officers to interfere when principles break out into overt acts against peace and good order; and finally, that truth is great and will prevail if left to herself, that she is the proper and sufficient antagonist to error, and has nothing to fear from the conflict, unless by human interposition disarmed of her natural weapons, free argument and debate, errors ceasing to be dangerous when it is permitted freely to contradict them:  
II. Be it enacted by the General Assembly, That no man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship, place, or ministry whatsoever, nor shall be enforced restrained, molested, or burthened in his body or goods, nor shall otherwise suffer on account of his religious opinions or belief; but that all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to maintain, their opinion in matters of religion, and that the same shall in no wise diminish, enlarge, or affect their civil capacities.  
III. And though we well know that this assembly elected by the people for the ordinary purposes of legislation only, have no power to restrain the acts of succeeding assemblies, constituted with powers equal to our own, and that therefore to declare this act to be irrevocable would be of no effect in law; yet we are free to declare, and do declare, that the rights hereby asserted are of the natural rights of mankind, and that if any act shall be hereafter passed to repeal the present, or to narrow its operation such act will be an infringement of natural right.

PBILADELPSBIA, Feb, 1.  
The General Aflembly of Virginia, at their  
late session, have passed no less than one hundred  
and twelve Alts; a copy ofone of which fol­  
lows :  
An ACT for eflablifbing ReLicious FREEDOM,  
WHEREAS Almighty God hath created  
: the mind free ; that all attempts to in­  
fluence it by temporal puaifhments, or burthens,  
or by civil incapacitations, tend only to beget  
habits of hypocrisy and meanness, and are a de.  
parture from the plan ot the Holy Author of  
our religion, who, being Lord both of body and  
mind, yet chose not to propagate it by coercions  
on either, as was in his Almighty power to do ;  
that the impious presumption of legiftators and  
rulers, civil as well as ecclesiastical, who, being  
themselves but fallible and uninspired men, have  
afflumed dominion over the faith of others, set­  
ting up their own opinions aod modes of thinks  
ing as the only true and infallible, and as such  
endeavouring to impose them on others, hath  
established and maintained falfe religions over  
the greatest part of the world, and through all  
time ¢ That to compel a man to furnifh contri­  
butions of money for the propagation of opini­  
ons which he disbelieves, is finful and tyrannical  
that even the forcing him to support this or that  
preacher of - his own religious persuasion, is de­  
priving him of the comfortable liberty of giving  
his contributions to the particular pastor whose  
morals he would make his pattern, and whose  
powers he feels most persuasive to righteousness,  
and is with-drawing from the ministry those  
temporal rewards, which, proceeding from an  
approbation of their personal conduét, are an  
additional incitement to earnest and unremitting  
labours for the instruction of mankind ; that our  
  
civil rights have no dependence on oiir religioiis  
opinions, any more than our opinions in phyfié  
or geometry ; that therefore the proscribing any  
citizen as unworthy the public confidence, by  
laying upon him an incapacity of being called  
to offices of trust and emolument, unless hé  
profefs or renounce this or that religious opinion,  
18 depriving -him injuriously of those privileges  
and advantages to which in common with his  
fellow citizens he has a natural right; that it  
tends only to corrupt the principles of that reli­  
gion it is tneant to encourage, by bribing, with  
a monopoly of worldly honouts and emoluments,  
those who will externally profefs and conform to  
it 3 that though indeed those are criminal who do  
not withstand such temptation, yet neither are  
those innocent who lay the bait in their way 3  
that to fuffer the civil magistrate to intrude his  
powers into the field of opinion, and to restrain  
the profeffion or propagation of principles on  
supposition of their ill tendency, is a dangerous  
fallacy, which at once destroys all religious liber~  
ty, because he being of course judge of that ten”  
dency will make his opinions the rule of judg.  
ment, and approve or condemn the featiments  
of others only as they shall square with or diffet  
from his own ; that it is time enough for the  
rightful purposes of civil government for its  
officers to interfere when principles break out  
into overt afts against peace and good order 3  
and finally, that truth is great and will prevail  
if left to herfelf; that the is the proper and fuf­  
ficient antagonist to error, and has nothing to  
fear from the confli®, unless by human interpo~  
fition disarmed of her natural weapons, free ar.  
gument and debate, errors ceasing to be danger 4  
ous when it is permitted freely to contradick  
them : . &#x27;  
Be it therefore enalted by tbe Genmeral Assembly;  
That no man shall be compelled to frequent ot  
support any religious worship, place, or minister  
whatsoever, nor shall be enforced, restrained;  
molested, or burthened in his body or goods, not  
shall otherwise fuffer on account of his religious  
opinions or belief 5 but that all men shall be  
free to profefs and by argument to maintain their  
opinions in matters of religion, and that the fame  
shall in no wife diminish, enlarge, or affeét theit  
civil capacities. o :  
And though we well know that this assembly;  
ele€ted by the people for the ordinary purposes  
of legislation only, have no power to restrain the  
alls of succeeding Assemblies, constituted with  
powers equal to our own, and that chetefore to  
declare this a&amp; irrevocable wou&#x27;d be of no  
effe&amp;t in law, yet we are free to declare, and do

MAXIMS AND OBSERVATIONS, 477  
  
false religions over the greatest part of the world, and through all time ;  
that to compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation  
of opinions which he disbelieves, is sinful and tyrannical ; that even the  
forcing him to support this or that teacher of his own religious persuasion,  
is depriving him of the comfortable liberty of giving his contributions to  
the particular pastor, whose morals he would make his pattern, and whose  
powers he feels most persuasive to righteousness, and is withdrawing from  
the ministry those temporary rewards, which, proceeding from an appro-  
bation of their personal conduct, are an additional incitement to earnest and  
unremitting labours for the instruction of mankind; that our civil rights  
have no dependence on our religious opinions, any more than our opinions  
in physics or geometry; that therefore the proscribing any citizen as un-  
worthy the public confidence, by laying upon him an incapacity of being  
called to offices of trust and emolument, unless he profess, or renounce  
this or that religious opinion, is depriving him injuriously of those privi-  
leges and advantages to which in common with his fellow-citizens he has  
a natural right ; that it tends only to corrupt the principles of that religion  
it is meant to encourage, by bribing with a monopoly of worldly honours and  
emoluments those who will externally profess and conform to it; that  
though indeed those are criminal who do not withstand such temptation,  
yet neither are those innocent who lay bait in their way; that to suffer  
the civil magistrate to intrude his powers into the field of opinion, and to  
restrain the profession or propagation of principles on supposition of their  
ill tendency, is a dangerous fallacy, which at once destroys all religious  
liberty, because he, being of course judge of that tendency, will make his  
opinions the rule of judgement, and approve or condemn the sentiments of  
others only as they shall square with or differ from his own ; that it is time  
enough for the rightful purposes of Civil Government, for its officers to in-  
terfere when principles break out into overt acts against peace and good  
order ; and finally, that truth is great and will prevail if left to herself ;  
that she is the proper and sufficient antagonist to error, and has nothing to  
fear from the conflict, unless by human interposition disarmed of her natural  
weapons, free argument and debate, errors ceasing to be dangerous when  
it is permitted freely to contradict them.  
  
II. Be it enacted by the General Assembly,—That no man shall be com-  
pelled to frequent or support any religious worship, place or ministry what-  
soever, nor shall be enforced, restrained, molested or burthened in his body  
or goods, nor shall otherwise suffer on account of his religious opinions or  
belief ; but that all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to main-  
tain, their opinions in matters of religion, and that the same shall in no  
wise diminish, enlarge, or effect their civil capacities.

offer. &quot; Whereas Almighty &#x27;Godd hath  
created the mind frre; that all attempts  
to influence it by temporal punishments  
or bnrdens,.or by civil  
iiecapacitations, tend only to beget  
habits of hypocrisy and meanness, and  
are a departure from the plan of the  
holy author of our religion ; who, being  
Lord both of body and mind, yet chose  
not to propagateit by coercions on  
either, as was in his almighty power to  
do: that the impious presumption of  
legislators and rulers, civil as well as  
ecclesiastical, who, being themselves  
but. fallible and uninspired men, have  
assumed dominion over the faith of  
others, setting up their own opinions  
and modes of thinking as the only true  
and infallible, and as such endelcvoriag  
to impose them on others, hath  
established or maintained filse  
religions over the greatest part of the  
world, and through all time: that to  
compel a man to filrnish contributions  
of money for the propagation of  
opinionswhichioe disbclieves, is sinful  
and tyrannical; that even the forcing  
hint to support this or that preachceye  
f .his own religious persuasion, is  
depriving imn of&#x27; the comfortable  
liberty of giving his contributioins to  
the particular pastor whose morals lie  
would make his pattern, and whose powers  
he feels most persuasive to  
righteousness, and is withdrawing from  
the ministry those temporal rewards,  
which, proceeding fronm an approbation  
of their personal conduct, ire an  
additional incitement to earnest and  
unremitting labours for the instruction  
of mankind : that our civil rights have  
no dependence on our religious opinions,  
any more than on our &#x27;opinions in physic  
and geometry : tlhat, therefore, the  
proscribing any citizen as unworthy of  
the public confidence, by laying upon  
him an incapa. city of being called to  
offices of trust and emolument, unless  
he profess or renounce this or that  
religious opifiion, is depriving him  
injuriously of those privileges and  
advantages to which, in common with his  
fellow-citizens, he has a natural right  
: that it tends only to corrupt tie  
principles of&#x27; that religion it is meant  
to encourage, by bribing with a monopoly  
of worldly hoonurs and emolunments those  
who will externally profess or conform  
to it : that though, indeed, those are  
criminal who do not withstand such  
temptation, yet neither are those  
innocent who lay tile bait in their way  
; that to stffer the civil magistrate to  
intrude his powers into the iceld of  
opinion, and to restrain tile profession  
or propagation of principles on  
suspicion of their ill tendency, is it  
dangcrous fallacy, which at once  
destroys all religious liberty ;  
because, he &#x27;being, of course, judge of  
that tendency, will make his opinions  
tile nile of judgment, and approve or  
condemn the sentiments of others only as  
they shall square with or differ from  
his own: that it is time enough, for  
tile rightful purposes of civil  
government, for its officers to  
interfere whlro&#x27; principles break out  
into overt acts against peace and good  
order: and, finally, that truth is  
great, and will prevail if left to  
herself; that she is the&#x27;proper and  
sufficient antagonist to error, and has  
nothing to fear from the conflict,  
unless by human interposition disarmed  
of ler natural weapons -free argnnnent  
and debate-errors ceasing to be

compelled to frequent or support any  
religious worship, place, or ministry  
whatsoever; nor shall be enforced,.

ginia, December 16th, 1784. ,  
1. Whereas, Almighty God iath .cre­  
ated the mind free, that all attempts to  
influence it by temporal punishments or  
burtheus,or by civil incapacitation,tend on­  
ly to beget habits of hypocrisy and mean­  
ness, and are a departure from the .plan  
of the Holy author of our religion, who  
being Lord both of body and mind, yet  
chose not to propagate it by coercions on  
either, as was in his Almighty power to  
do; that the impious presumption of Leg­  
islators and Rulers, civil as well as eccle­  
siastical, who being themselves but fallible  
and uninspired men, have assumed domin­  
ion over the faith of others, setting up  
their own opinions and modes of thinking  
as the only Jrue and infallible, and as such  
endeavoring to impose them on others,  
hath established and maintained false re­  
ligious over the greatest part of the world,  
and through all time; that to compel a  
man to furnish contributions of money  
for the propagation of opinions which he  
disbelieves, is sinful and tyrannical; that  
even the forcing him to support this or  
that teacher of his own religious persua­  
sion, is depriving him of the comfortable  
liberty of giving his contributions to the  
particular pastor, whose morals he would  
make his patern, and whose powers he  
feels most persuasive to righteousness,  
and is withdrawing from the ministry  
those temporal rewards, which, proceeding  
from an approbation of their iersonal con­  
duct, are an additional incitement to earn­  
est and unremitting labors for the instruc­  
tion of mankind; that our civil rights have  
uo dependence on our religious opinions  
any more than ur opinions of physics or  
geometry; that therefore the proscribing  
any citizen as unworthy the public confi­  
dence, by laying upon him an incapacity  
of being called to offices of trust and em­  
olument unless he profess, or renounce this  
or that religious opinion is depriving him  
injuriously of those privileges and advan­  
tages, to which, in common with hisfellow-citizens,  
he has a natural right; that  
it tends only to corrupt&#x27; the principles of  
that religion it is meant to encourage, by  
bribing with a monopoly of worldly hon­  
ors and emoluments, those who will exter­  
nally profess and conform to it; that though  
indeed those are criminal who do not  
withstand temptation, yet neither are  
those innocent who lay the bait in their  
way; that to suffer the civil magistrate to in­  
trude his powers into the field of opinion,  
and to restrain the profession or propoga­  
tion of principles on supposition of their  
ill tendency, is a dangerous fallacy, which  
at once destroys all religious liberty, be­  
cause he, being of course . judge of that  
teudency, will make his opinion the rule of  
judgment, and approve or condemn the  
sentiments of others only ; as they shall  
square with or differ from his own; that it  
is time enough for the rightful purpose of  
Civil Government, fyr its officers to inter­  
fere when principles break out into overt  
acts against peace and good order; and  
finally, that Truth is great and will pre vail  
if left to herself; that She is the proper and  
sufficient antagonist to error, and has no­  
thing to fear from the conflict, unless by  
mman interposition disarmed of her nat  
ural weapons, free argument and debate;  
errors ceasing to be dangerous, when it  
is permitted freely, to contradict them.  
2. Be it enacted by the General Assem  
bly, That no man shall be compelled to  
frequent or support any religious worship,  
place of Ministry ; whatsoever, nor shall  
be enforced, restrained, molested, or bur-  
thened iu his body or goods,-nor&quot;shall he  
otherwise suffer on account of his religious  
opinions or belief; but tliat all men shall  
be free to profess, and by argumeut to
