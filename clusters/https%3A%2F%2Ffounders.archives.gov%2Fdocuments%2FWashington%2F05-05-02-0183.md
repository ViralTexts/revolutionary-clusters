Dear Sir,  
New York March 28th 1790.  
  
Your letter of the 15th enclosing the Act of Assembly authorising an agreement with Mr Alexander came to my hand in the moment my last to you was dispatched.  
I am sorry such jealousies as you relate should be gaining ground, &amp; poisoning the minds of the Southern people. But, admit the fact which is alledged as the cause of them, and give it full scope, does it amount to more than what was known to every man of information before, at, and since the adoption of the Constitution? Was it not always believed that there are some points which peculiarly interest the Eastern States? And did any one who reads human nature, &amp; more especially the character of the Eastern people, conceive that they would not pursue them steadily by a combination of their force? Are there not other points which equally concern the Southern States? If these States are less tenacious of their interest, or, if whilst the Eastern move in a solid phalanx to effect their purposes, the Southern are always divided, which of the two is most to be blamed? That there is diversity of interests in the Union none has denied. That this is the case also in every State is equally certain—and that it extends even to Counties, can be as readily proved. Instance the Southern &amp; Northern parts of Virginia—the upper &amp; lower parts of So. Carolina &amp;ca—have not the interests of these always been at varience? Witness the County of Fairfax, has not the interests of the people thereof varied, or the Inhabitants been taught to believe so? These are well known truths, and yet it did not follow that seperation was to result from the disagreement.  
To constitute a dispute there must be two parties. To understand it well both the parties &amp; all the circumstances must be  
  
fully understood. And to accomodate differences good temper &amp; mutual forbearance is requisite. Common danger brought the States into Confederacy, and on their Union our safety &amp; importance depend. A spirit of accomodation was the basis of the present Constitution; can it be expected then that the Southern or the Eastern part of the Empire will succeed in all their Measures? certainly not. but I will readily grant that more points will be carried by the latter than the former, and for the reason which has been mentioned—namely—that in all great national questions they move in unison, whilst the others are divided; but I ask again which is most blameworthy, those who see &amp; will steadily pursue their interests, or those who cannot see, or seeing, will not act wisely? and I will ask another question (of the highest magnitude in my mind) and that is, if the Eastern &amp; Northern States are dangerous in Union, will they be less so in seperation? If self interest is their governing principle, will it forsake them, or be less restrained by such an event? I hardly think it would. Then, independent of other considerations what would Virginia (and such other States as might be inclined to join her) gain by a seperation? Would they not, most unquestionably, be the weaker party?  
Men who go from hence without feeling themselves of so much consequence as they wished to be considered—disappointed expectants—and malignant designing characters that miss no opportunity to aim a blow at the Constitution, paint highly on one side without bringing into view the arguments which are offered on the other. It is to be lamented that the Editors of the several Gazettes of the Union do not more generally &amp; more connectedly publish the debates in Congress on all great National questions that affect different interests instead of stuffing their papers with scurrility &amp; malignant declamation, which few would read if they were apprised of the contents. That they might do this with very little trouble is certain. The principles upon which the difference in opinion arises, as well as the decision, would, in that case, come fully before the public, &amp; afford the best data for its judgment.  
Mr Madison, on the question of discrimination, was actuated, I am persuaded, by the purest motives; &amp; most heartfelt conviction; but the Subject was delicate, &amp; perhaps had better not have

Deah Sir: I am sorry such jealousies us you  
relate should be gaining gtound, and poison­  
ing the minds of the Southern people. fiut,  
a.lmtl the fact which is alltgtd as the cause cf  
them, and give it full scope, dots it amount to  
more than what was known toevety man of in­  
formation before, at, anil since the adoption of

who reads human nature, and more especially  
the charac’cr of the Eastern people, conceive  
that they would not pursue them steadily, by a  
combination of their force? Are there not  
other points which equally conctrn the South­  
ern Sta&#x27;es? If these States are le-s tenacious  
of their interest, or if, whilst the Eastern move  
in a solid phalanx to effect their purposes, the  
Southern are always divided, which of the two  
is most to be blamed? That there are diver­  
sity of interests in the Union, no. one has de­  
nied—that this is the case also in every State,  
is equally certain—and that it extends even  
to ■ ountics.can be as readily proved. In-t«nce  
- the Southern and Northern parts of Virginia,  
the upper and lower parts of South Carolina,  
Sec. Have not the interests of these alw.tjs  
been at variance? Witness the county of Fair­  
fax. Has not the interrs&#x27;sof the people thereof  
vaiied, or the inhabitants been taught to be­  
lieve so? These are well known truths; and  
yet it did net follow that usurpation was to re­  
sult irom the disagreement. To constitute a  
dispute, there must be two parties. To under­  
stand it well, bo&#x27;h the parlies and all the cir­  
cumstances must be fully understood; and to  
accommodate differences, ttmper and mutu­

ger brought the S&#x27;a es into confederacy; and  
on their union our safety and importance de­  
pend A spirit of accommodation was tic  
basis of the present Constitution. Can it be  
expected, then, (hat the Southern or the East­  
ern part of the empire will succeed in all  
their measures? Ceitainly not. But I will rea­  
dily grant that moie points will be carried by  
the latter than the former, and for the rca­

ask again, which is most blameworthy, those  
who see and will s eadily pursue their interests,  
or those who cannot sec, or seeing, will not act  
wisely? And I will ask another question, (of  
the highest magnitude, in ntv mind,) and that  
is, if &#x27;hr Eastern an t Northern States arc dan­  
gerous in union, will they be less so in sepnm­  
lion? II self-interest is their governing pi in­  
ciple, will it forsake them or he iess restrained  
by s&gt;uch an event? I hardly think it would —  
Then, Independent of other considerations,  
what would Virginia (and such other Siatrs as  
mtgi t be inclined to join her) gain by a sepa­  
rator*? Would they not, most unquestionably,  
be the weaker part)? Men who go from her.ee  
wi ht-ut fitting themselves of so much conse­  
quence as they wished to be considcied—dis­

whicu are offered on the other. It is to be la­  
mented that the editors of the several gazettes  
of the Union do not more generally and more

scurrility and malignant declamation, which

Washington had little sympathy with  
these sectional jealousies, and that the noble  
language in which he rebukes them, cannot  
be too largely cited. “ I am sorry,” ob­  
serves he, “ such jealousies as you speak of,  
should be gaining ground and poisoning the  
minds of the Southern people ; but, admit  
the fact which is alleged as the cguse of  
them, and give it full scope, does it amount  
to more than was known to every man of  
information before, at, and since the adop­  
tion of the Constitution ? Was it not  
always believed that there are some points  
which peculiarly interest the Eastern  
States ? And did any one who reads human  
nature, and more especially the character of  
the eastern people; conceive that they would  
not pursue them steadily by a combination  
of their force ? Are there not other poicts  
which equally concern the Southern States?  
If these states are less tenacious of their  
interest, or if while the eastern move in a  
solid phalanx to effect their views, the  
southern are always divided, which of the  
two is most to be blamed ? That there is a  
diversity of interests in the Union, none has  
denied. That this is the case, also, in every  
state, is equally certain ; and that it even  
extends to the counties of individual states  
can be as readily proved. Instance the  
southern and northern parts of Virginia,  
the upper and lower parts of South Carolina.  
Have not the interests of these always been  
at variance ? Witness the county of Fair­  
fax : have not the interests of the people of  
that county varied, or the inhabitants been  
taught to believe so ? These are well known  
truths, and yet it did not follow that sepa­  
ration was to result from the disagreement.  
“ To constitute a dispute there must be  
two parses. To understand it well, both  
parties and all the circumstances must be  
heard; and, to accommodate differences, tem­  
per and mutual forbearance are requisite.  
Common danger brought the States into  
confederacy, and on their union our safety  
and importance depend. A spirit of accom­  
modation was the basis of the present Con­  
stitution. Can it be expected, then, that  
the Southern or Eastern parts of the empire  
will succeed in all their measures ? Cer­  
tainly not. But I will readily grant that  
more points will be carried by the latter  
than the former, and for the reason which  
has been mentioned, namely, that in all  
great national questions, they move inj uni­  
son, whilst the others are divided. But I  
ask again, which is most blameworthy,  
those who see and will steadily pursue their  
interests, or those who cannot see, or seeing,  
will not act wisely ? And I will ask anoth­  
er question, of the highest magnitude In my  
mind, to wit: if the eastern and northern  
States are dangerous in umon, will they be  
less so in separation ? If self interest is their  
governing principle, will it forsake them, or  
be restrained by such an event ? I hardly  
think it would. Then, independently of  
other considerations, what would Virginia,  
and such other States as might be inclined  
to join her, gain by a separation ? Would

Has the South forgotten that memorable letter of  
WAsHInGTon to David Steaer, which although writ­  
ten seventy years ago, is just as pertinent to the  
slave qnestion now as it was then? &quot;Was it not  
always believed,&quot; he says, &quot;that there are some  
points which peculiarly interest the Eastern States?  
And did any one, who reads human nature, and more  
especially the character of the Eastern people, con­  
ceive that they would not pursue them steadily by a  
combination of their force? Are there not other  
points, which equally concern the Southern States?  
If these States are less tenacious of their interest,  
or if, whilst the Eastern moved in a solid phalanx  
to effect their views, the Southern are always di­  
vided,--which of the two is most to be blamed?&quot;  
I press upon you the demand of Washington,  
if, in the face of a North aggressively united,  
we are nof, to have a South even defensive  
ly united, which of the two is most blamable for  
the disastrous consequences to ensue. Disastrous to  
the North as well as the South. For if the North is to  
go on in this course of unconstitutional assault on the  
rights of the South--if this Federal Government is  
to be perverted into a consolidated one, if the equil­  
abrium of the Union is to be overthrown, if the Con­
