[New York, June 27, 1804]  
Sir  
  
The letter which I had the honor to receive from you under date of yesterday, states among other things, that in Genl Hamilton’s opinion, Col: Burr has taken a very indefinite ground, in which he evinces nothing short of predetermined hostility; and that Genl Hamilton thinks it inadmissable that the enquiry should extend to his confidential as well as other conversations. To this Col. Burr can only reply that secret whispers traducing his fame and empeaching his honor, are at least equally injurious, with slanders publickly uttered; That Genl H. had at no time and in no place a right to use any such injurious expressions; and that the partial negative he is desposed to give with the reservations he wishes to make, are proofs that he has done the injury specified.  
Col: Burr’s request was in the first instance proposed in a form the most simple, in order that Genl Hamilton might give to the affair that course to which he might be induced by his temper and his knowledge of facts. Col. B. trusted with confidence that from the frankness of a soldier and the candor of a gentleman he might expect an ingenuous declaration; that if, as he had reason to believe Genl H. had used expressions derogatory to his honor, he would have had the magnanimity to retract them; and that if, from his language injurious inferences had been improperly drawn he would have perceived the propriety of correcting errors, which might thus have been widely diffused. With these impressions Col. Burr was greatly surprised at receiving a letter which he considered as evasive and which in manner he deemed not altogether decorous. In one expectation however, he was not wholly deceived, for the close of Genl Hamilton’s letter contained an intimation that if Col. Burr should dislike his refusal to acknowledge or deny, he was ready to meet the consequences. This Col. B. deemed a sort of defiance, and would have felt justified in making it the basis of an immediate message. But as the communication contained something concerning the indefiniteness of his request: As he believed it rather the offspring of false pride than of reflection, and as he felt the utmost reluctance to proceed to extremities, while any other hope remained, his request was repeated in terms more explicit. The replies and propositions on the part of Genl H. have in Col. B’s opinion been constantly in substance the same.  
Col: Burr disavows all motives of predetermined hostility. A charge by which he thinks insult is added to injury, he feels as a gentleman should feel, when his honor is impeached or assailed, and without sensations of hostility or wishes of revenge, he is determined to vindicate that honor at such hazard as the nature of the case demands.  
The length to which this correspondence has extended only tending to prove that the satisfactory redress, earnestly desired cannot be obtained, he deems it useless to offer any proposition except the simple Message which I shall now have the honor to deliver.  
I have the honor to be with great respt.   Your Obt &amp; very hum Servt

SIR,  
  
The letter which I had the honor to re-  
ceive from you, under date ot yefterday,  
  
ftates among other things, that in General [  
  
Hamilton’s opinion, Col, Burr has taken  
a very indefinite ground, in which he evir-  
  
ces nothing thert of predetermined hofti ity, }  
and that Gen. Hamilton thinks itinadmil- §  
fible tha: the enquiry fhould extend to his §  
  
confidential as well as other converfations.  
Inthis Col. Burr canonly reply, that fe-  
cret whifpers traducing his fame, and im-  
  
peaching his honor, are, at leaft, equally §  
  
injurious with flanders publickly utterec :  
That G. H. had, at notime, and inno  
place, a right to ufe any fuch injurious  
  
expreffions ; and that the partial negative §  
  
he is difpofed to give, with the referva-  
tions he wifhes to make, are proofs that he  
has done the izjury fpecified.  
  
Col. Burr’s requeft, was in the firft in-  
tance, propofed ina form the moft fimple,  
inorder that Gen. Hamilton might give to  
the affair that courfe to which he might be  
induced by his temper and his knowledge

DIR, .  
The letter which I had the honour to re­  
ceive from you, under date of yesterday,  
states, among other tilings, that in General  
Hamilton’s opinion/ Col Burr has taken a  
W xcry indefinite ground, in which he  
evinces nothing short of predetermined  
hostility, and that General Hamilton thinks  
it inadmissible that the enquiry should ex­  
tend to his confidential as well as other con­  
veraatiOnsv^To this Col. Burr can only re­  
ply, that^steret .whispers traducing his  
fame, and impeaching his honour, are, at  
least, equallylnjuriousyKith slanders, pub­  
lickly uttered ; That ©en. Hamilton had  
at no time, and in no place, a right to use  
any such injurious expressions ; and that  
the parti§l. negative he is disposed to give,  
with the .reservations he wishes to make,  
are proofs that he lias done the injury spe­  
cified. • t v*  
vol. fury’s request was, in the first in­  
stance, proposed in a form the most sim­  
ile, in order that General Hamilton might  
  
give to the affair that course to which he  
might be induced by his temper and his  
knowledge of facts* Colonel Burr trusted  
with confidence, that, from the frankness of  
a soldier, and the candour of a gentleman,  
he might expect an ingenuous declaration.  
&#x27;Chat if, as he had reason to believe, Geti.  
Hamilton had issued expressions derogato­  
ry to his honour, he would have had the  
magnanimity to retract them ; and that if,  
from his language, injurious inferrcnces  
had been improperly drawn, he would have  
perceived the propriety of c orrectingerrours,  
which might thus have been widely diffus­  
ed. With these impressions, Col. Burr  
was greatly surprised at receiving a letter  
which he considered as evasive, and which  
was conceived in a manner deemed not alto­  
gether decorous. In one expectation, how­  
ever, he was not wholly deceived, for the  
dose of Gen. Hamilton’s letter contained an  
intimation that if Col. Burr should dislike  
his refusal to acknowledge or dtfny, lie was  
ready to meet the consequences. This  
Col. Burr deemed a sort of defiance, and  
would have rested justified in making it the  
basis of an immediate message. &#x27;But as  
the communication contained something  
concerning the indefiniteness of the re­  
quest, as he believed it rather the offspring  
of false pride than of reflection, and as he  
felt the utmost reluctance to proceed to ex­  
tremities, while any other hope remain­  
ed, his request was repeated in terms more !  
explicit. The replies and propositions on j  
the part of Gen. Hamilton have, in Colonel  
Burr’s opinion, been constantly in substance  
die same.  
Col. Burr disavows all motives of pre­  
determined hostility, a charge by which  
he thinks insult added to injury—He feels  
as a gentleman should feel when hislionour  
is impeached or assailed, and, without sen­  
sations of hostility or wishes of revenge,  
he is •determined to vindicate that honour,  
at such hazard as the nature of the case  
demands.  
The length to which this correspondence  
has extended, only tending to prove that  
the satisfactory redress, earnestly desired,  
cannot be obtained, he deems it useless to  
offer any propositions, except the simple  
message which I shall have the honour to  
  
ueiiVL&#x27;i. i  
I have the honour to be, with,1 great  
Respect, your obedient and very  
Humble servant.

thinks it uiadmmible that tbe enquiry Hiould  
extend to his confidential as well as other con­  
Tcrfatlons. In this Col. Hurr can only reply,  
that fee ret whifpers traducing his fame, and im­  
pcaching his honor, arc at leaft, equally injuriou i  
with Handers publicly uttered : that Gen. H.  
had, at no time, and in no place, a right to ufc  
any fuch injurious exprellions; and that the  
particular negative he isdifpofed to give, with  
the refervatioii3 he willies to make, are proofs  
that he has done the injury fpccitied.  
Cql. Burr’b rcquelt was, in the tirft inftancc,  
propol&#x27;ed in a form the moft Pimple, in order  
that Gen. Hamilton might give to the affair that  
courfe to which he might be induced by his  
temper and knowledge of farts. Col. B irr trail­  
ed with confidence, that from the franknefs of  
a foldier, and the candor of a gentleman, he  
might expert an ingenuous declaration. That  
if» as he had reafon to believe, Gen. II. had ufed  
ekpreffions derogatory to his honor, he would  
have had the magnanimity to retrart them ; and  
that if, from his language, injurious inferences  
h-ul been improperly drawn, he would have per­  
ceived the propriety of concerting errors, which  
might thus have been widely dift&#x27;ufeil. With  
thefe impreflions, Col. Burr was greatly l&#x27;lirprifed  
at receiving a letter which he conlidered as eva­  
five, and which in a manner he deemed not al­  
together decorous. In one exportation, liowe­  
  
ver, he was not wr.ouy oecciveu, rur me tune or  
Gen. Hamilton’s letter contained an intimation  
that if Col. Burr fhouid diflike his refulal to ac­  
knowledge or deny, he was ready to meet the  
confequences. This Col. Durr deemed a fort of  
defiance, and would haVe fell juftified in making  
it the bafis of an immediate meil&#x27;age. But as the  
communication contained foinething about the  
indefinitenefs of the rcquelt ; as lie believed it  
rather t*he offspring of falfe pride than of reflec­  
tion, and as he felt the utmolt reluctance to pro­  
ceed to extremities, while any other hope re­  
mained, his requclt was repeated in terms more  
explicit. The replies and propolitions on the  
part of Cen. Hamilton, have in Col. Burr’s opi­  
nion, been conftautly in fubttance the fame.  
Colonel Burr di fa vows all motives of prede­  
termined Uoftilily, a charge by which he thinks  
infult added to injury. He feels as a gentleman  
fhouid feci when his honor is impeached oraf­  
failed, and without fenfirtions of holtility or  
wilhes of revenge, he is determined to vindicate  
that honor at fuch hazard as the nature of the  
Cafe demands.  
Tiie length to which this correfpondence has  
extended, only tending to prove that the iatis­  
fae&#x27;lory red rtfs, earneftly defired, cannot be ob­  
tained, he deems it ufelefs to olfer any propoli­  
tion,except the fimple mellage which I liiall now  
have the Iionor to deliver.  
I have the honor to be,  
With great refpedt,  
Your obedient &amp; very humble ferv’t,

flance, proposed in a form the most simple,  
in order that gen. Hamilton might give to  
the affair that course to which he might be  
induced by his temperiand his knowledge  
of salts. Col. Burr trulted with confidence,  
that from the frankne(s of a loldier and the  
candour of a gentleman, he/might expe&amp; an  
ingenious declaration, That if, as he had  
rcafon to believe, Gen, H. had used expref­  
fiods derogatory to his honor, he would have  
had the magnanimity 1o retra&amp; hem; and that  
if from his language injurious inferences had  
bezn imiproperly drawn, he wou!d have per­  
ccived the propriety of correfling errors  
which might thus have been widely abused.  
Wiih these impreflions, col. Burr was great­  
ly (utprifed at receiving a letier which he  
considered as evasive, and which in 2 shan­  
ner he deem:d notaltogether decorous. In  
one expeltation, however, he was not who!-  
ly deceived, for the close of Gea. Haril­  
ton’s letter contained an intimation that if  
col. Burr should difl ke his refufal to ac­  
koowledge or deny, he was ready t 6 meces  
the conlequenices. This col. Burr deemed  
a fort of defiance, and would have felt jufl.  
tified in making it the basis of an irhmediate  
meflage. But as the communication con.  
tained foricthing concerning the indefinite­  
nels of the request : as hie believed it rather  
the osttoring of falfe pridé than of refle@ion,  
and as he felt the vtmoft rélaltance to pro­  
ceed to exrremiries, while any bther hope  
remained, his reqaeft was repeaed in terms  
mote explicit. The replies afid proposi­  
tions on the part of Gen. Hamilton have in  
Col. Byri’s opinion been conflanily in lub­  
flante the lame. s  
Col. Burr difavowd al! motives of prede­  
termined hoflility, a charge by which he  
thinks ififalt added to injury—he feels as a

peached or amilcd,.&#x27;and without sensations,  
ot holtility or wishes of revenge, heis deter--

Sir,  
  
The letter which I had the honor to receive from  
you, under date of yesterday, states that among other  
things, that in Gen. H.’s opinion Col. B. has takena  
very indefinite ground, in which he evinces nothing  
short of predetermined hostility, and that Gen. Hamil-  
ton thinks it inadmissible that the enquiry should ex-  
tend to his confidential as wellas other conversations.  
In this Col. Burr can only reply, that secret whispers  
traducing his fame and impeaching his honor are, at  
least, equatly injurious with slanders publicly uttered ;  
that Gen. H. had, at no time, and in no place, a right  
togise any such injurious expressions; and that the  
partial negative he is disposed to give, with the reser-  
vations he wishes to make, ae proofs that he has done  
the injury specified.  
  
Col Burr’s request was, in the first instance, pro-  
posed in a form the most simple, in order that Gen. H.  
might give to the affair that course to which he might  
be induced by his temper and his knowledge of facts,

nesg ofa soldier and the candor of a gentlemen he |

sjgus derogatory to his honor, he would have had the
