London, February 23, 1808.  
  
Sir—Mr. Canning has just sent  
me a note, of which a copy is en-  
closed, relative to an intended al-  
teration, upon the subject of cot-  
ton, in their bill for carrying into  
execution the late orders in coun-  
cil. You-will perceive that he  
lays some stress upon the acci-  
dental observations, which (as al-  
ready explained to you in my let-  
ter of the 26th of last month) were  
drawn from me, some time since,  
upon the singularly offensive pro-  
ject of imposing a transit duty  
upon our cotton. I mentioned to  
you in my letter of the 2d instant,  
that he appeared to have misap-  
prehended the tendency of these  
observations, and that, in a subse-  
quent conversation, he shewed a  
  
‘disposition to remove this obnox-  
  
ious feature from their plan, for  
the purpose of substituting an ab-  
solute interdict of the export of  
that article, under an idea that we  
should then cease to object to it ;  
but that I thought it my duty to  
decline to give him any encou-  
ragement to do so, although I  
agreed, as he scemed to wish it,  
to mention his disposition to you.  
A few days ago, he sent for me  
—, and renewed his proposal,  
  
an immediate change, with res-  
pect to cotton, from a prohibitory  
duty, toa direct prohibition. My  
answer was the same in substance  
as it had been before. He then  
suggested thealternative arrange-  
  
ment, which you will see state;  
in his note ; but, adhering to the  
determination I had formed, upon  
the first appearance of the orders  
in council, to make no compro.  
mise (without precise directions  
from my government) with the  
system which they announce, by  
becoming a party to its details, |  
received this proposal as I had  
done the other.  
  
The British government, how  
ever, had resolved to adopt this  
last mentioned plan, whether if  
received my concurrence or not  
upon a presumption that it would  
be more acceptable to us, and  
  
rhaps, too, under the idea, tha  
it was more defensi#le, than theitil  
original scheme; and the pur-  
pose of Mr. Canning’s note, is  
merely to signify to me, in a man  
ner as friendly and respectful as  
possible to the United States,  
their intention to propose it to  
parliament.—One object of all  
this is, certainly, to concilfaté us,  
although it may be another, to  
free their system, as far as they  
can, from the disadvantage of  
one of the formidable reproaches  
which their opponents cast upop  
it. But the wise and magnani-|  
mous course would be, at once  
to tread back their steps upon the  
whole of this ill-judged measure,  
instead of relying upon small and  
unsubstantial modifitations, which  
neither produce an effect upon its  
character and principle, nor miti-  
gate the severity of its practical  
consequences. I might, if |  
thought it advisable, take the oc-  
casion, which Mr. Canning’s note  
undoubtedly furnishes, to press  
upon him once more, the policy,  
as well as the justice of such a  
course ; but I believe it, under all  
circumstances, to be more pru

Mr. Canning lias just sent me a note, of  
which a copy is enclosed, relative to an in­  
tended alteration, upon the subject of cotton,  
in their bill for carrying into execution the  
late orders in council. You will perceive  
that he lays some stress upon the accidental  
observations, which (:is already explained  
to you in my letter of the ?f&gt;th of last month)  
were drawn from me some time since upon  
tile singularly offensive project ot imposing  
a transit duty upon our cotton. I mention­  
ed to you, in my letter of the 2d instant, that  
he appeared to ha*‘e misapprehended the  
tendency of these observations, and that in  
a subsequent conversation he shewed a dis­  
position to remove the obnoxious feature  
from their plan, for the purpose of substitu­  
ting an absolute interdict of the export of  
that article, under an idea that we should  
thenccr.se to object to it; but that 1 thought  
it my duty to decline to give him anv en­  
couragement to do so, although I agreed, as  
he.seemed to wish it, to mention his dispo­  
sition Co you. A few days ago, he sent for  
me again, and renewed his proposal of an  
immediate change, with respect to cotton,  
from a prohibitory duty to a direct prohibiti­  
on. My answer was the snmc in substance  
ns it had been before. He then suggested  
the alternative arrangement, which you will  
«ee stated in his note; but, adhering to the  
determination 1 had formed upon the first  
appearance of the orders in council to make no  
compromise (without precise direction from  
my government) with the system they an­  
nounce, by becoming a party to its details,  
I received die ptupuaui «is I h»d dune die u­  
ther.  
The British government, however, had  
resolved to adopt the last mentioned plan,  
whether it received my concurrence or not,  
Upon a presumption that it would be more  
acceptable to us; and, perhaps too, under  
the idea that it was more defensible than  
their original scheme ; and the purpose of  
Mr. Canning’s note is merely to signify to  
me, in a manner as friendly and respectful  
as possible to the United States, their in­  
tention to propose it to parliament. One  
Object of all this is certainly, to conciliate  
Us. although it may he another, to free their  
system, as far as they can, from the disad­  
vantage of one of the formidable reproaches  
which their opponents cast upon it. But the  
w ise and magnanimous course would he at  
once, to trend back their steps upon the  
whole of tit&#x27;s ill-jiulged measure, instead of  
relying upon small and unsubstantial modi­  
fications, which neither produce an effect  
upon its character and principle, nor miti­  
gate the severity of its practical consequen­  
ces. I might, if I thought it advisable, take  
the occasion, which Mr. Canning’s note un­  
doubtedly furnishes, to press upon him once  
more the policy, as well as the justice of such  
a course; but I believe it, under all circum­  
stances, to be more prudent to wait for your  
Instruction, which must, I think, be very  
soon received.  
I have already had the honor to send you  
two copies of the resolutions, moved in the  
house of commons, by the chancellor of the  
exchequer, as tables of export duties, to  
which ttieir bill should refer. I have enclo­  
sed in another letter, with which this will be  
accompanied, a copy of the hill itself, which  
will, however, undergo several alterations.  
Those will be found to be explained (as far  
hs I am acquainted with them) in the let­
