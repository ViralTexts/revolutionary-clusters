Sir,  
Department of State Philadelphia, Monday morning May 12. 1800  
  
I have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated last Saturday, stating that “as you perceive a necessity of introducing a change in the administration of the Office of State, you think it proper to make this communication of it to the present Secretary of State, that he may have an opportunity of resigning, if he chooses:” and that “you would wish the day on which his resignation is to take place to be named by himself.”  
Several matters of importance in the office, in which my agency will be useful, will require my diligent attention until about the close of the present quarter. I had, indeed, contemplated a continuance in office until the fourth of March next; when, if Mr. Jefferson were elected President (an event which in your conversation with me last week you considered as certain) I expected to go out of course. An apprehension of that event first led me to determine not to remove my family this year to the city of Washington: because to establish them there would oblige me to incur an extraordinary expence, which I had not the means of defraying: whereas, by separating myself from my family, and living there eight or nine months, with strict economy, I hoped to save enough to meet that expence, should the occasion occur. Or, if I then went out of office, that saving would enable me to subsist my family a few months longer; and perhaps aid me in transporting them into the woods, where I had land, tho’ all wild and unproductive, and where, like my first ancestor in New-England, I expected to commence a settlement on bare creation. I am happy that I now have this resource; and that those most dear to me, have fortitude enough to look at the scene without dismay, and even without regret.—Nevertheless, after deliberately reflecting on the overture you have been pleased to make to me, I do not feel it to be my duty to resign.  
I have the honor to be, / with great respect, / Sir, / Your most obedient Servant,  
  
Timothy Pickering.

May 12th, 1800.  
  
Sir—I have to acknowledge the receipt of you  
letter, dated last Saturday, stating “as you per-  
ceive a necessity of introducing a change in tly  
‘dministration of the office of state, you think it),  
proper to make this communication of it to the 1  
present secretary of state, that he may have a!  
opportunity of resigning, if he chooses ;” an  
that “you would wish the day on which his re-  
jignation js to take place to be named by him-  
self.”  
  
Several matters of importance in the office, in  
which my agency will be useful, will require my  
diligent attention until about the close of the pre-  
sent quarter. I had Indeed, contemplated a con-  
rinuance in office until the fourth of March next ;  
when, if Mr. Jefferson were elected president  
an event which in your conversation with me las:  
veek you considered as certain) I expected to go  
ut of course. An apprehension of that event  
urst led me to determine not to remove my fami-  
y this year to the city of Washington; because  
to establish them there would oblige me to incur |  
}an extraordinary expense, which I had not the  
means of defraying: whereas, by separating my-  
self from my family, and living there eight or  
nine months, with strict economy, I hoped to  
meet that expense, should the occasion occur  
Or, if l then went out of office, that suving would  
cnable me to subsist my family a few months lon-  
ger; and perhaps aid me in transporting them  
into the woods, where I had land, though all wild  
ind unproductive, and where, like my first ances-  
  
  
  
  
  
ors in New-England, I expected to commence  
evtlement on bare creation. Iam happy that |  
now have this resource ; and those most dear to  
ne, have fortitude enough to look at the scene  
  
  
  
  
  
without dismay, and cyen without regret—Ney-  
  
ertheless, after deliberately reflectingon the over.  
ture you have been pleased to make to me, I do  
not feel it to be my duty to resign.  
  
I have ihe honox to be,  
  
With great respect, sir,  
Your obedient servant,  
Timoruy PicKertne
