I was one only of a band devoted to the cause of independance, all of whom exerted equally their best endeavors for it’s success, and have a common right to the merits of it’s acquisition. so also in the civil revolution of 1801. very many and very meritorious were the worthy patriots who assisted in bringing back our government to it’s republican tack. to preserve it in that, will require unremitting vigilance. whether the surrender of our opponents, their reception into our camp, their assumption of our name, and apparent accession to our objects, may strengthen or weaken the genuine principles of republicanism, may be a good or an evil, is yet to be seen. I consider the party division of whig &amp; tory, the most wholesome which can exist in any government, and well worthy of being nourished, to keep out those of a more dangerous character. we already see the power, installed for life, irresponsible responsible to no authority (for impeachment is not even a scare-crow) advancing with a noiseless and steady pace to the great object of consolidation. it’s the foundations are already deeply laid, by their decisions, for the annihilation of constitutional state-rights, and the removal of every check, every counterpoise to the ingulphing power of which themselves are to make a sovereign part. if ever this vast country is brought under a single government, it will be one of the most extensive corruption, indifferent, and incapable of a wholesome care over so wide a spread of surface. this will not be borne, and you will have to chuse between reformation &amp; revolution. if I know the spirit of this country, the one or the other is inevitable. before the canker is become inveterate, before it’s venom has reached so much of the body politic as to get beyond controul, remedy should be applied. let the future appointments of judges be for 4. or 6. years, and renewable by the President &amp; Senate. this will bring their conduct, at regular periods, under revision and probation, and may keep them in equipoise between the general and special governments. we have erred in this point, by copying England, where certainly it is a good thing to have the judges independant of the king. but we have omitted to copy their caution also, which makes a judge  removable on the address of both legislative houses. that there should be public functionaries independant of the nation, whatever may be their demerit, is a solecism in a republic of the first order of absurdity and inconsistence.

authority, (for impeachment is not even a scare  
crow), advancing, with a noiseless and steady pace,  
to the great object of consolidation. The foundations  
are already deeply laid, by their decisions, for the  
annihilation of constitutional state rights, and the  
removal of every check, every counterpoise to the  
ingulfing power of which themselves are to make a  
sovereign part. If ever this vast country is brought  
under a single government, it will be one of the  
most extensive corruption, indifferent and incapa.  
ble of a wholesome care over so wide a spread of  
surface. ‘This will not be borne, and you will have  
to choose between reformation and revolution. If  
I know the spirit of this country, the one or the  
other, is inevitable. Before the canker is become  
inveterate, before its venom has reached so much  
of the body politic as to get beyond control, reme.-  
dy should be applied. Let the future appoiniments  
of judges be for four or six years, and renewable by the  
president and senate, This will bring their conduct,  
at regular periods, under revision and probation,  
and may keep them in equipoise between the ge.  
neraland special government... We have erred in  
this point, by copying England, where certainly it is  
a good thing to have the judges independent of the  
king; but we haye omitted to copy their caution also,  
which makesa judge removable on the address of  
both legislative houses. That there should be pub-  
lic functionaries, independent of the nation, what-  
ever may be their demerit, is a solecism in a republic,  
of the first order of absurdity and inconsistence.  
To the printed inquiries respecting our schools,  
itis not in my power to give an answer. Age, debi-  
lity, an ancient dislocated, and now stiffened wrist,  
render writing so slow and painful, that Iam oblig-  
ed to decline every thing requiring writing. An  
act of our legislature willinform you of our plan  
of primary schools; and the annual reports show  
that it is becoming completely abortive, and must  
be abandoned very shortly, after costing us to this  
day 180,000, and yet to cost us $45,000 a year more,  
until it shall be discontinued; and if a single boy  
has received the elements of a common education,  
it must be insome part of the country net known  
to me. Experience has but too fully confirmed the  
early predictions of itsfate. But on this subject  
I must refer to others, more able than I am, to go  
into the necessary details; and I conclude with the  
assurances of my great esteem and respect.

To wM. T. BArrY.  
Moxticello, July 24, 18  
If ever this vast country is  
brought under a single government, it will  
be one of the most extensive corruption, in­  
different and incapable of a wholesome care  
over so wide spread a surface. This will  
not be borne, and you will have to choose  
between reformation and revolution. If I  
know the spirit of this country, the one or  
other is inevitable. Before the canker has  
become inveterate, before its venom has  
  
reached so much of the body politic as to get  
  
beyond control, the remedy should bean  
  
Let the future appointments of judges be  
  
for four or six years, and renewable by the  
President and Senate. This will bring  
  
conduct at regular period under re  
  
vision and probation, and may keep them  
equipoised between its general and special  
gavernments. We have erred in this point  
  
by copying England, where certainly it is a  
good thing to have judges removable on the  
  
address of both legislative Houses. That  
hould be public functionaries inde-

in 1822, he wrote to William T. Barry: “We already see  
the power, installed for life, responsible to no authority  
(for impeachment is not even a scarecrow), advancing  
with noiseless and steady pace to the great object of con-  
solidation. The foundations are already deeply laid by  
their decisions for the annihilation of constitutional State  
rights, and the removal of every check, every counter-  
poise to the ingulfing power of which they themselves  
are to make a sovereign part. If ever this vast country  
is brought under a single government, it will be one of  
the most extensive corruption, fndifferent and incapable  
of a wholesome care over so wide a spread of surface.  
This will not be borne, and you will have to choose be-  
tween reformation and revolution. If I know the spirit  
of this country, the one or the other is inevitable. Be-  
fore the canker is become inveterate, before its venom  
has reached so much of the body politic as to get beyond  
control, remedy should be applied. Let the future ap-  
pointment of judges be for four or six years, and renewa-  
ble by the President and Senate. This will bring their  
conduct, at regular periods, under revision and probation,  
and may keep them in equipoise between the general and  
special governments. We have erred on this point by  
copying England, where, certainly, it is a good thing to  
have the judges irfdependent of the King. But we have  
omitted to copy their caution also, which makes a judge  
removable on the address of both legislative houses. That  
there should be public functionaries independent of the  
nation, whatever may be their demerit, is a solecism in a  
republic of the first order of absurdity and inconsistency.
