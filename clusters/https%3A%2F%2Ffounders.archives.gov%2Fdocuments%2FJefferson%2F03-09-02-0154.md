Boston Decr 11 1815  
  
Since the return of General Dearborne from his visit to monticello, I am highly gratify’d in hearing that you enjoy your health &amp; that you are so happily situated in your domestic retirement.—During the convulsions of Europe, &amp; the events which have taken place in our own Country, a person of your accurate observation must have experienced the most anxious solicitude for the result of those important controverceis.—As to France we are all disapointed in a termination of a revolution, which promised a releif from the tyranny of establishments, which are advocated (even in America) as legitimate.—But the “ways of heaven are dark &amp; intricate,” &amp; we are oblig’d to submit to the decrees of providence, however contrary to what we may think, are productive of the general happiness of Mankind.—As France has fallen by an Alliance of Tyrants, America must expect to rise by a Union of freemen acting in their Constitutional capacity—Their destiny is a lesson of admonition to Us.—  
It must afford you the highest consolation to find, that the honor &amp; Glory of our Country, have been promoted, by the very means which our enemies had predicted would be ruinous &amp; destructive—nothing but the interposition of providence could have produced so much good, from what was consider’d by many, as productive of so much Evil.—The united states were compel’d into a controvercy in defence of their maritime rights, which if they had faild in vindicating, would probably have check’d, if not eventually have terminated their future prosperity as a nation.—at the beginning of the controvercy conflict, the prospect was gloomy &amp; perilous: repeated disasters almost appal’d us in the prosecution, while the internal enemy Enemy were dayly becoming formidable, by every insidious management which faction could generate—amidst these complicated difficulteis, we have succeeded in our Appeal to Heaven, &amp; every American must feel a pride, that the energeis of an administration beset with such a Phalanx of opposition, have triumph’d, not only over the forign Enemy, but baffled the efforts of a more dangerous combination of domestic Foes.—As the present state of our Country demands some extraordinary efforts in Congress to bring forward the Agricultural &amp; manufacturing Interests of the united States, I am induced to mention the plea often used by the freinds of England, that the Work Shops of Europe are recommended by you, as the most proper to furnish to furnish Articles of manufactures to America.—By which they infer, that it is  Your opinion, the manufactures of this Country are not proper objects for Congressional pursuits.—They frequently enlarge on this Idea, as corresponding with your sentiments, &amp; endeavor to weaken our efforts in this particular, by quoting you as the advocate of foreign importations, manufactures, to the exclusion of our own.—not that these persons are influenced by  any generous on or freindly motive towards you, but they think it will answer their purposes, if such sentiments can be promulgated with any appearance of respect to your opinion—I am sensible that they mean to misrepresent your real intentions, being convinced, that the latitude which these persons take with your abstract remarks on manufactures is far beyond which what your you orginally contemplated.—A Nation whose feilds are abundantly covern’d with merino Sheep Flax &amp; Cotton, it is hoped, will not long depend on Looms at 3000 miles distance, to furnish them with Cloathing, provided their ingenuity &amp; enterprize are adequate to produce such necessary Articles from their internal resources, &amp; industry.—  
you will pardon my remarks, &amp; excuse my writing you on this subject—but it would be an essential service at this Crizis, when the sub question of manufactures will come so powerfully before Congress by petitions from various important establishments, if you would condescend to explain more minutely your Idea of the Work Shops of Europe, in the supply of such articles as can be manufactur’d among ourselves.—As it could not be your intention to discourage all domestic manufactures, &amp; render useless our raw materials, an explanation from you on this subject would greatly contribute to the advancement of those manufactures, which have now risen to a respectable state of maturity &amp; improvement.—If the general Idea shd prevail, that you prefer foreign Work Shops to domestic, the high Character you sustain among the freinds of our Country, may lead many them to a discouragment of that enterprize, which is vewed by many as an essential object of our Independance—I should not have taken the freedom to suggest my Ideas, but being convinc’d of your patriotism &amp; devotedness to the good of your Country, have urged me to make these observations.—your candor will allow pardon if they are incorrect.—  
I should be happy in receiving a reply, for in the present state of political controvercy &amp; intrigue, the real republicans must rely on our “long tried patriots” (among which you stand foremost) to guide &amp; direct in the future pursuits of Goverment—Though retir’d from public life, yet your private Council is essential, &amp; we must solicit your aid, to substantiate in Peace, what we obtaind in War.—The patriot is always call’d on Duty, while the exigencies of the his Country need his advice, &amp; his exertions are requird to carry it into operation.—We are limited but to a few years to discharge our trust as Citizens, &amp; we must become the more active as the period shortens.—The old patriots if not employd in navigating the Ship, yet they are vew’d as Beacons by which the  helmsmen must steer to the Haven of Safety—  
Your freinds in this quarter would be highl

Sina—Since the return of gen. , from  
his visit to Monticello, Lam highly gratified in hear  
ing that you enjoy your health, and that you are so  
happily situated in your demestic retirement.  
  
During the convulsions in Europe, and the events  
which have taken» place in our country, a person of  
your accurate observation must have experienced  
the most anxious solicitude, for the result of these  
important conrrvoversies, As io France, we are all  
disappointed in the termination ofa revolution which

federal papers as “legitimate.” But the “ways of  
Heaven are dark and iniricate,” and we are obliged  
to submit to the decrees of Providence, however  
contrary to what we may think, are productive to  
the general happiness of mankind. As France hag  
fallen by an alliance of foreign despots, America  
must expect to rise by a unron of freemen, acting  
in their constitutional capacity. The destiny of

As te present state of our country demands  
gome exiraordinary etiorts in congress to bring for-  
ward tee agricultural and manufacturing interests of  
the United States, um induced to mention a plea,  
efie:, ised by the friends of England, that the work  
shops af Furope are recommended by you, as the most  
proper to furnish articles of manufacture to the ciii-  
zens of ihe United States, by which they infer that  
it is your opinion, the »anuracrounes of this coun.  
try are not proper objects for congressional pur-  
suits. They frequently enlarge on this idea as cor-  
responding with your sentiments, «nd endeavor to  
weaken our exertions in this particular, by quoting  
you asthe advocate of foreign manufiuctures, to tue  
exciusion of domestic. Not that these persons have  
any friendly motive towards you, but they think it  
will answer their purposes, if such sentiments can  
be promulgated with an appearance of respect to  
your opinion. [ am sensibie that many of these  
persons mean to misrepresent your real intentions,  
being convineed that tiie latitude they take with  
your remarks on manufactures, is far beyond what  
you contemplated at the period they were written.  
The purity of your mind could not lead you to ant-  
eipute the perfidy of foreign nations, which has since  
  
ken place—If you had, it is impossibie that you  
would have discouraged the manufuciures of a na-  
tion, whose fields iave since been abundantly cover-  
ev with mermo sheep, flax and co‘ton,or depended  
on looms at 6VUU miles distance, to furnish tie citi-  
zens With clothing, when their internal resources  
were adequate to produce such necessaries by their  
doinestic industry. You will pardon my remarks,  
an excuse my freedom in writing you on this: sub-  
ject. Butit woutd be an essential service at this  
Crisis, when the subject of manufactures will come  
so powerfully before congress, by petitions from  
Various establishments, if you would condescend to  
express more minutely, your idea of the ‘‘iwork-sheps  
of Europe,’ in the supply ef such articles as can  
be manufactured among ourseives. An explanation  
from you on this subject would greatly contribute  
to the advancement of those manufaciures, which  
have risen during the laie war to a respectable siate  
of maturity and improvement. Domestie manutac-  
tures is the objec: contemplated; mstead of estab-  
lishments under the sole control of capitalists, our  
Cluidren may be educated under the inspection of  
their parents while the habits of industry may be  
duly inculcated.  
  
If tne general idea should prevail that you prefer  
foreign work-shops to domestic, the high character  
you sustain amotg® che friends of our country, may  
lead Uiem to a discouragement of that enterprize  
  
whicii is viewed by many as an essential objeci of  
  
our naional independence. | should noi have taken  
  
the freedom of suggcsimg my ideas, but being con-  
  
vinced of your patri@tsm, and devotedness to the  
. CaN  
  
good ef your countPy, have urged me to make the  
  
  
  
letter, for in the present state of political contro-  
versy and intrigue, the real republicans must rely  
on our “long-tried patriots,” (among whom you  
stand pre-eminently ) to guide and direct in the fa-  
ture pursuits of the government.—,Though retired  
from public life, yet your private council is essential,  
and we must solicit your aid to help the administra-  
tion to substantiate by wise measures in peace, what  
we have obtained in war. The patriot is always  
called on duty, while the exigencies of his country  
need his advice, and his exertions are required  
to carry his principles into operation. We are  
limited but to a few years, to discharge our trust  
as citizens, and we must become more active  
as the period shortens. The real patriot neve

During the convulsions in Europe, and

vation must have experienced the most  
anxious solicitude for the result of these  
important controversies. As to France,  
we are all disappointed in the termina-  
tion- of a revolution, which promised a  
relief from the tyranny of establishments,  
which have been inconsiderately advoca-  
ted in the federal papers as legitimate.”  
But the ** ways of Heaven are dark and  
* intricate,” and we are obliged to sub-  
mit to the decrees of Providence, however  
contrary to what we may think are pro-  
ductive to the general happiness of man-  
kind. As France has fallen by an alli-  
ance of foreign despots, America must

acting in their constitutional capacity.

templating, that the energies of an Ad-  
ministration, beset with such a phalanx  
of opposition, have triumphed, not only  
over a foreign enemy, but have baffled the  
wily projects of a more dangerous body  
of internal foes.—I would not wish to  
be censorious, but the fact is too er-  
Not that we consider  
every nominal federalist was thus inimical,  
but the artful proceedings of certain leac-  
ers urged many honest men to adopt those  
resolutions which have produced num-  
berless serious events. We can easily  
distingnish between the enticers and the  
enticed.  
  
As the present state of our country de-  
mands some extraordinary efforts in Con-  
gress to bring forward the Agricultural  
and Manufacturing interests of the United  
States, I am induced to mention a plea, of-  
ten used by the friends of England, that  
the work-shops of Europe are recommend -  
ed by you, as the most proper to furnish  
articles of Manufacture to the citizens of  
the United States, by which they inter  
that it is your opinion, the Manufactures  
of this country are not proper objects  
for Congressional pursuits. —They fre-
