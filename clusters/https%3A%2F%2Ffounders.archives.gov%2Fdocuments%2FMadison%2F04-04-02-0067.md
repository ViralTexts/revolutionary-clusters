I received by yesterday’s Mail your letter of the 14th. inviting, in the name of the Committee of arrangement, my presence at the celebration in the Metropolis of the U.States, of the fiftieth anniversary of their Independence.  
I am deeply sensible of what I owe to this manifestation of respect on the part of the Committee; and not less so of the gratifications promised by an opportunity of joining with those, among whom I should find myself, in commemorating the event which calls forth so many rejoicing reflections on the past, and anticipations of the future career of our Country. Allow me to add that the opportunity would derive an enhanced value from the pleasure with which I should witness the growing prosperity of Washington, and of its Citizens, whose kindness during my long residence among them, will always have a place in my grateful recollections.  
With impressions such as these, it is with a regret, readily to be imagined, that I am constrained to decline, the flattering invitation you have  
  
communicated. Besides the infirmities incident to the period of life I have now reached, there is an instability of my health at present, which would forbid me to indulge my wishes, were no other circumstance unpropitious to them.  
This explanation will I trust be a sufficient pledge, that altho’ absent all my feelings will be in sympathy with the sentiments inspired by the occasion. Ever honored will be the day which gave birth to a nation, and to a System of self-government, making it a new Epoch in the History of Man. Be pleased to accept Sir, for yourself &amp; the Committee assurances of my respectful consideration, and of my best wishes.

Montre.ier, June 20, 1826.  
  
Dear Sir: I received by yesterday&#x27;s mail  
your letter of the 14th, inviting in the name of  
the Committee of Arrangement, my presence  
atthe celebration, in the Metropolis of the  
United States, of the Fifueih Anniversary of  
American Independence. .  
  
1 am deeply sensible of what I owe to this  
manifestation of respect, on the part of the  
Committee ; aud not less so of the gratifica-  
tions promised by an opportunity of joing  
with those, among whom ] should find myself,  
in commemorating the event which calls forth  
so many reflections on the past, and apticipa  
tions of the future career of ourcountry. Al  
low me to addjthat the opportunity would de-  
rive an enhauced value, from the pleasure  
with which | should witness the growing pros-  
perity of Washington, and of its citizens,  
whose kindness, during my long residence  
among them, will always have a place in my  
ratetul recollections.  
  
W ith impressions such as these, it is with re-  
gret, readily to be imagined, that | am con-  
strained to decline the flattering invitation you  
have communicated. Besides the iwwfirmities  
incident to the period of life 1 have now reach  
ed, there 1s an instability of my health at pres-  
ent, which would forbid me to indulge my  
wishes, were no other circumstances unpropi-  
tous to them.  
  
This explanation will, I trust, be a sufficient  
pledge that, although absent, all my seelings  
will be im sympathy with the sentuments 10-  
spired by the occasion. Ever honored will be  
the day which gave birth to a nation, and to a  
system of self government, making it a new  
epoch in the bistory of man.  
  
Be pleased to accept, Sir, for yourself and  
the ( ommittee, assurances of my respectiul  
consideration, aad of my best wishes.  
  
JAMES MADISON
