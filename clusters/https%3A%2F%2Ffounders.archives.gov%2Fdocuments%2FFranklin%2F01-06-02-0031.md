cript copy of it remained in the hospital for many years — it was there in the 1820s for example, when Roberts Vaux, a Manager from 1823 to 1834, endorsed it: “Dr. Franklin’s Manuscript.” By 1895, however, it seems to have disappeared, for Morton and Woodbury did not mention it in their history of the hospital published in that year. Where it had gone no one knows; but in 1933 it was offered for sale by a Berlin bookseller and, through the generosity of Dr. A. S. W. Rosenbach, who bought it, and of individual managers of the Hospital, it was returned to its former place.

PENNSYLVANIA HOSPITAL.  
An intention of founding an hospital seems  
to haye been entertained as early as 1707,  
when it is known to have been agitated at a  
meeting of the people called Quakers. Ap-  
plication was made to the proprietary for a  
charter and assistance, at the same time  
when this was done for the ‘town and coun-  
ty school,’ being the same now under the  
care of a corporation chosen from that reli-
