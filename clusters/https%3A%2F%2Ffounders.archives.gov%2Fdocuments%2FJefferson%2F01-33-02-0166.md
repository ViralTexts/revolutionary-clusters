Three days after his inauguration Jefferson  
wrote to Monroe :  
  
‘‘T have firmly refused to follow the counsels  
of those who have advised the giving offices to  
some of their leaders in order to reconcile. I  
have given and will give only to Republicans  
under existing circumstances. But I believe  
with others that deprivations of office, if made on  
the ground of political principles alone, would re-  
volt our new converts and give a body to leaders  
who now stand alone. Some, I know, must be  
made. They must be as few as possible, done  
gradually, and bottomed on some malversation or  
inherent disqualification. Where we shall draw  
the line between retaining all and none is not  
yet settled, and will not be until we get our ad-  
ministration together, and perhaps even then  
we shall proceed a talons, balancing our measures  
according to the impression we perceive them to  
make.
