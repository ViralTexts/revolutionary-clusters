Sir,  
						Department of State April 30th. 1808  
					  
					My last was of the 4th. inst, and went by a British packet from New York. I now forward a copy of it.  
					Congress ended their Session on the night of the 25 inst. The series of newspapers, herewith sent, affords a view of their proceedings subsequent to the communications last made to you. Some other prints are included which throw light on the workings of  
						public opinion and the State of public affairs.  
					You will find that the critical posture of our foreign relations has produced provisions of different kinds for our greater security; and particularly that no pains have been spared to stop every leak by which the effect of the Embargo laws might be  
						diminished. I refer you also to the report made to the Senate, by a committee on the documents relating to the affair of the Chesapeake, and on the letters of Mr. Champagny and Mr. Erskine; and indicating the spirit which may be expected to influence the future policy of this  
						Country, if kept under the excitement resulting from the system now pursued against it.  
					You will observe at the same time, that whilst a determination is sufficiently evinced against a dishonorable acquiescence in the despotic Edicts enforced on the high seas, the United States are ready to resume their export trade as soon as the aggressions  
						on it shall cease; and that in a hope that this might happen during the recess of Congress, the President is authorized, in such an event, to suspend in whole or in part, the several Embargo laws.  
					The conditions on which the authority is to be exercised appeal equally to the justice and policy of the two great belligerent powers which are now emulating each other in a violation of both. The President counts on your endeavours to give to this appeal  
						all the effect possible with the British Government. Genl. Armstrong will be doing the same with that of France. The relation in which a revocation of its unjust decrees by either, will place the United States to the other is obvious; and ought to be a  
						motive to the measure, proportioned to the desire which has been manifested by each to produce collision between the United States and its adversary; and which must be equally felt by each, to avoid one with itself.  
					Should the French Government revoke so much of its decrees as violate our neutral rights, or give explanations and assurances having the like effect, and entitling it therefore to a removal of the Embargo as it applies to France, it will be impossible to  
						view a perseverance of Great Britain in her retaliating orders, in any other light than that of war without even the pretext now assumed by her.  
					In order to entitle the British Government to a discontinuance of the Embargo as it applies to Great Britain, it is evident that all its decrees, as well those of Jany. 1807 as of Novr. 1807, ought to be rescinded as they apply to the United States; and

Depfiartment of State,  
April 30, 1808,  
  
My last was of the 4th inst. and  
went by a British packet from  
New York, I now forward a co-  
py of it.  
  
Congress ended their session  
on the night of the 25th instant.  
The series of newspapers, here-  
with sent, affords a view of their  
proceedings subsequent to the  
communications last made to you,  
Some other prints are included  
which throw light on the work-  
ings of public opinion and the  
  
‘state of public affairs.  
  
You will find that the critical  
posture of our foreign relations,  
has produced provisions of differ-  
ent kinds for our greater securi-  
ty ; and particularly that no pains  
have been spared to stop every  
  
“Jeak by which’ the effect of the  
  
ergbargo laws might be diminish-  
ed. I refer you also to the re-  
port made to the senate by acom-  
mittee on the documents relating  
to the affair of the Chesapeake,  
and on the letters of M. Cham-  
pagny and Mr. Erskine ; and in-  
dicating the spirit which may be  
expected to influence the future  
policy of this country, if kept un-  
der the excitement resulting  
from the system now pursued  
against it.  
  
You will observe at the same  
time, that, whilst a determina-  
tion is sufficiently evinced against  
a dishonorable acquiescenee in  
the despotic edicts enforced on  
the high seas, the United States  
are ready to resume their export  
trade as soon as the aggressions  
on it shall cease: and that in a  
hope that this might happen dur-  
ing the recess of congress, the

laws.

ral Armstrong will be doing the  
same with that of France. The  
relation in which a revocation of  
its unjust decrees by either, will

which must be equally felt by  
each to avoid one with itself.  
  
Should the French government  
revoke so much of its decrces as  
violate our neutral rights, or give  
explanations and assurances hav-  
ing the like effect, and entitling  
it therefore to a removal of the  
embargo as it applies to France,  
it will. be impossible to view a  
perseverance of Great Britain in  
her retaliating orders, in any other  
light than that of war, without  
even the pretext now assuined by  
her.  
  
In order to entitle the British  
government to a discontinuance  
of the embargo, as it applies to  
Great Britain, it is evident that  
all its decrees, as well those of  
January, 1807, as of November,  
1807, ought to be rescinded, as  
they apply to the United States ;  
and this is the rather to be looked  
for from the present administra-  
tion, as it has so strenuously con-  
tended that the decrees of both  
dates were founded on the same  
principles, and directed to the  
same object.  
  
Should the British government  
take this course, you may autho-  
rise an expectation that the pre-  
sident will, within a reasonable  
lime, give effect to the authority  
vested in him on the subject of  
the embargo laws.  
  
Should the orders be rescinded  
in part only, it must be left to his  
free judgment to decide on the  
case. In either event, you will  
lose no time in transmitting the  
information to this department  
and to general Armstrong ; and  
particularly in the event of such  
a course being taken by the Bri-  
tish government, as will render a  
suspension of the embargo cer-  
  
tain or probable, it will be proper  
  
141  
  
for you to make the communica-  
tion by a courier to general Arm-  
strong, to whom a correspondent  
instruction will be given, and to  
provide a special conveyance for  
it hither, unless British arrange-  
ment shall present an opportuni-  
ty, equally certain and expedi-  
tous.

“ My last was of the 4th instant, and

I refer you also to the report made to the Se­

You will observe, at the same time, that  
whilst a determination is sufficiently evinced

•happen during .he recess of Congress, the

’1 The conditions on which the authority is  
to be exercised, appeal equally to the justice  
, and policy of the two great belligerent pow­  
, ers, which are now emulating each other in  
a violation of both. The President counts  
on your endeavors to give to this appeal, all  
! the effect possible with the British govern­  
( ment. General Armstrong will be doing the  
same with that of France. The relation in  
which a revocation of its unjust decrees by  
either will place the United States to the o­  
, ther is obvious, and ought to be a motive to  
the measure, proportioned to the desiic  
which has been manifested bv each to pro­  
duce collision between the United States and  
its adversary, and which must be equally  
felt by each, to avoid one with itself.  
Shou.d the French government revoke so  
much of its decrees as violate our neutral  
j rights, or give explanations and assurances  
having the like effect, and entitling it there­  
fore to a removal of the embargo, as it ap­  
plies to France, it will be impossible to view  
a perseverance of Great-Britain, in her re­  
taliating orders, in any other light than that  
of war, without even the pretext now assu­  
med by her.  
In order to entitle the British government  
to a discontinua nce of the embargo, ns it ap­  
plies to Great Britain, it is evident that all  
its decrees, as well those of January, 1807,  
! as nt November, 1807, ought to he rescind  
; cd, as they apply to the United States, and  
j this is the rather to he looked for, from the  
present administration, as it has so strenu­  
ously contended that the decrees of both  
dates were founded on the same principles  
and directed to the same object.  
Should the British government take this  
course, you may authorize an expectation  
that the President will, within a reasonable  
time, give effect to the authority vested in

Should the orders be rescinded, in part only,
