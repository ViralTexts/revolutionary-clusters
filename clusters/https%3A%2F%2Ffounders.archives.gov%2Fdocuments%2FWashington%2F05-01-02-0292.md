My Dear Sir  
Mount Vernon March 11th 1789  
  
I was favored last evening by yours of the 20th Ulto and am glad to be confirmed in the idea that a spirit of unanimity is becoming still more prevalent.  
My having company with me at present &amp; my being occupied with my private concerns, will be considered by you as sufficient reasons for my writing in a laconic manner. I will therefore reply to the principal scope of your letter with all that brevity, frankness &amp; friendship, which, in such cases, one friend has a right to expect from another.  
Should it become inevitably necessary for me to go into the chair of government, I have determined to go into it, free from all positive engagements of every nature whatsoever. This is the answer I have already given to a multiplicity of applications; and I have assigned as the true reason of my conduct, the predominant desire I had of being at liberty to act with a sole reference to justice &amp; the public good. But without deviating from that line of proceeding which I had chalked out for myself, I may be permitted to say to you, my dear Sir, that you need not doubt my inclinations are very sincere &amp; very strong to serve you, if I can do it, consistently with my duty to the public. This I say, because I have known you in public life: for I do not intend to be swayed, in the disposal of places, by motives arising from the ties of friendship or blood.  
What offices there may be under the new Government, or what pretensions may be urged in favor of the different candidates I cannot pretend to foretell: all I will add at present, is, that you may rest assured I am, with sentiments of real affection Your friend and Very

MouNt VErNON, March 11, 1789.  
Mr Dear Sir: I was favoured last evening by yours  
of the 20th ultimo, and am glad to be confirmed in the  
idea, that a spirit of unanimity is becoming still more pre­  
valent. My having company with me at present, and  
being much occupied with my private concerns, will be  
considered by you as sufficient reasons for my writing in a  
laconic manner. I will, therefore, reply to the principal  
scope of your letter with all that brevity, frankness, and  
friendship, which in such cases one friend has a right to  
expect from another  
Should it become ineritably necessary for me to go into  
the chair of government, I have determined to go free from  
all positive engagements of every nature whatsoerer. This  
is the answer I hare already giren to a multiplicity of ap  
plications; and I have assigned, as the true reasons of my  
conduct, the predominant destre I had of being al tiberty to  
act with a sole reference to justice and the public good.  
But without deviating from that line of proceeding, which  
I had chalked out for myself, I may be permitted to say  
to you, my dear sir, that you need not doubt my inclina­
