Quincy Jan. 23d 1818  
  
I thank you for your kind letter of the 12th of this Month. As I esteem the Character of Mr Henry an honour to our Country and your Volume a masterly deliniation of it, I gave orders to purchase it as soon as I heard of it: but was told it was not to be had in Boston. I have seen it only by great favour on loan, a Copy from the Author would be esteemed worth many by purchase. It may be sent me by the Mail.  
From a personal Acquaintance, perhaps I might say, a Frienship with Mr Henry, and from all I have heard or read of him for more than forty years I have always considered him as a Gentleman of deep Reflection, keen sagacity, clear foresight daring Enterprize, inflexible Intrepidity and untainted Integrity, with an ardent Zeal for the Liberties the Honour and felicity of his Country, and his Species. All this you, (justly as I believe) represent him to have been. There are however some Remarks to be made Upon your Work, which if I had Eyes and hands I would, in the spirit of friendship, attempt. But my hands Eyes and Life are but for a Moment.  
When Congress had finished their Business as they thought, in the Autumn of 1774, I had with Mr Henry, before We took leave of each other, some familiar Conversationwith him, in which I expressed a full Conviction: that all our Resolves, Declarations of Rights, Enumeration of Wrongs, Petitions and Remonstrances and Addresses Associations and Non Importation Agreements; Though they might be expected by the People of America and necessary to cement their Union; would be but Waste Water in England. He thought they might be of some use among the People of England but would be totally lost upon the Government. I had just received a hasty Letter written to me by Major Joseph Hawley of Northampton containing “A few broken Hints” as he called them, of what was proper to be done, and concluding with these Words  
“After all; We must fight.”  
This Letter I read to Mr Henry, who listened to it with great attention and as soon as I had pronounced the Words “After all We must fight” he erected his Head and with an Energy and Vehemence that I can never forget, broke out with “By God I am of that Mans Mind.” I put the Letter into his hand, and when he had read it he returned it to me with an equally Solemn Asseveration that he agreed entirely in Opinion with the Writer. I considered this to be a Sacred Oath upon a very great Occasion I could have sworn it as religiously as he did. It was no Contradiction to what you say in some Part of your Book that he never took the Name of God in vain.  
As I know the Sentiments with which Mr Henry left Congress in November 1774, and knew the Chapter and Verse from which he had borrowed the Sublime Phrase “We must fight;” I was not at all Surprised at your History in the 122d Page, in the Note, and some of the preceeding and following Pages. Mr Henry only pursued in March 1775 the Views and Vows of November 1774.  
The other Delegates from Virginia returned to their State in full Confidence that all our Grievances would be redressed. The last Words which R. H. Lee said to me when We parted were, “We shall infallibly carry all our Points. You will be compleatly relieved; all the offensive Acts will be repealed, the Army and Fleet will be recalled and Britain will give up her foolish Project.” Washington only was in doubt. He never spoke in publick In private he advocated a Non Exportation as well as a Non Importation Agrement. With both he thought We should prevail. Without Either, he thought it doubtfull. Henry was clear in one Opinion, Lee in an Opposite Opinion and Washington doubted between them.  
Oralory will always command Admiration: but it deserves no great Veneration. It consists in Grace of Attitude and Motion, Intonations of the voice, and Expressions of the Countenance. Could Demosthenes comprehend these three Things, in his “Action”?  
To speak of American Orators ancient or modern would lead me too far, and indeed out of my depth. I must conclude with fresh Assurances of the high Esteem of your humble Servant  
John Adam

Quincy, January 23, 1818.  
Sin—lI thank you for your kind letter of the  
12th of this month. As] esteem the character:  
of Mr. Henry an honor to our country, and  
your volume a masterly delineation of it, I  
gave orders to purchase it as soon as I heard of  
  
it; but was told it was not to be had in Boston.  
i have seen it only by great favor on a short  
loan. A copy from the author would be worth  
many by purchase. It may be sent to me by  
the mail.  
  
From a personal acquaintance, perhaps, I  
might say a friendship, with Mr. Henry, of  
more than forty years, and from all that [have  
heard or read oi him, I have always considered |  
him as a gentleman of deep reflection, keen  
sagacity, clear foresight, daring enterprize,  
inflexible intrepidity and untainted integrity;  
with an ardent zeal for the liberties, the honor  
and felicity of his country and his species. All  
this you, justly as I believe, represent him to  
have been. ‘There are, however, remarks te be  
made upon your work, which, if I had the  
eyes and hauds, I would, in the spirit of,  
friendship, attempt. But my hands, and eyes,  
and life, are but tur a moment.  
  
When congress had finished their business,  
as they thought, in the autumn of 1774, I had,  
with Mr. Henry, before we took leave of each  
other, some familiar conversation, in which I  
expressed a full tonviction that our resolves,  
declaration of rights, enumeration of wrongs,  
petitions, remonstrances and addresses, asso-  
ciationg and non-importation agreements,how-  
ever they might be expected in America, and  
however necessary to cement the union of the  
colonies. would be but waste water in Eneland.  
Mr. Henry said they might make some impres-  
sign among the people of England, but agreed

with me that they would be totally lost upon  
the government. I had just received a short:  
and hasty letter, written to me by major Joseph  
Hiawley, of Northampton, containing ‘a few  
broken hints,” as he called them, of what he  
thought was proper to be done, and concluding  
with these words, “‘aFTHR ALL WE MUST FIGHT.’  
This letter I read to Mr. Henry, who listened  
with great attention, and as soon as I had pro-  
nounced the words, “after all we must fight,”’  
he raised kis head, and, with an energy and  
vehemence that I can never forget, broke out  
with “py G— I am or rHar MAN’s Mind.” I  
put the letter into his hand, and when he had  
read it he returned it to me, with an equally  
solemn asseveration, that he agreed entirely in  
opinion with the writer. 1 considered this as  
a sacred oath, upon a very great occasion, and  
could have sworn it as religiously as he did,  
and by no means inconsistent with what you  
say, in some part of your book, that he never  
took the Sacred Name in vain.  
  
As I knew the sentiments with which Mr.  
Henry left congress in the autumn of 1774, and  
knew the chapter and verse from which he had  
borrowed the sublime expression, “we must  
fight,” I was not at all surprised at oa his-  
tory, in the 122d page, in the note, and in some  
of the preceding and following pages. Mr.  
Henry only pursued,in March, 1775, the views  
and vows of November, 1774.  
  
The other delegates from Virginia returned  
to their state in full confidence that all our  
grievances would be redressed. The last words  
that Mr. Richard Henry Lee said to me when  
we parted, were, “we shall infalliably carry all  
our points. You will be completely relieved;  
ail the offensive acts will be repealed; the army  
and fleet will be recalled, and Britain will give  
up her foolish project.”  
  
Washington only was in doubt. He never  
spoke in public. In private he joined with those  
who advocated a non-exportation as well as a  
non-importation agreement. With beth he  
thought we should prevail; without either he  
thought it doubtful. Henry was clear in one  
epinion, Richard Henry Lee in an opposite  
opinion, and Washington doubted between the  
two. Henry, however, appeared, in the end,  
to be exactly in the right.

Quincy, Jan. 23, 1818.  
  
Sin,—I thank you for your kind letter of the  
12th of this month. As I esteem the character ot  
Mr. Henry an honor to our country, and your vo  
lume a mastetly delineation of it, I gave orders to  
purchase it as soon as I heard of it; but was told  
it was not to be had in Boston. I have seen it  
only by great favor onashortloan. A copy fforii  
  
the author would be worth many by purchase: It  
  
may be sent to me by the mail. =r  
  
From a personal acquaintance, perhaps I might  
say a friendship, with Mr. Henry of more thaii  
forty years, and from all that I have heard or read  
of him, { have always considered him as a gentle=  
man of deep reflection, keen sagacity, clear fore-  
sight, daring enterprize, inflexible intrepidity,  
and untainted integrity; with an ardent zeal for  
the liberties, the honor and felicity of his country  
represent Wil cote Eten, US res to  
ever, remarks to be made upon your work,.  
which, if I had the eyes and hands, I wouid, in  
the spirit of friendship, attempt. But my hands;  
and eyes, and life, are but for a moment:  
  
When congress had finished their busitiess, a5  
they thought, in the autumn of 1774, 1 had, with  
Mr. Henry, before we took leave of each other;  
some familia conversation, in which I expressed  
a full conviction that our resolves, declaration of  
rights, enumeration of wrongs, petitions, remon-  
strances and addresses, associations and non-ima  
portation agreements, however they might be ex:  
pected in America, and however necessary to ce-  
ment the union of the colonies, would be but  
waste water in England. Mr. Henry said they  
might make some impression among the people  
of England, but agreed with me that thev would  
be totally lost upon the government. 1 had just  
received a short and hasty letter, written to me  
by major Joseph Hawley, of Northampton, cons  
taining “a few broken hints,’ as he called them,  
of what he thought was proper to be done, and  
concluding with these words, ‘* after all we niiist  
fight? Yhis letter readte Mr. Henry, who lis

tened with great attention, and as soon as I had  
pronounced the words, “ after all we must fight,”  
he raised his head, and, with an energy and ve-  
hemence that I can never forget, broke out with  
“ By G Lam of that man’s mind.” 1 put the |  
letter into his hand, and when he had read it he  
returned it to me, with an equally solemn asse-  
veration, that he agreed entirely in opinion with  
the writer. I considered this as a sacred oath,  
upon a very great occasion, and could have sworn  
it as religiously as he did, and by no means in-  
consistent with what you say, in some part of  
  
our book, that he never took the Sacred Name  
  
  
  
am  
knew the sentiments with which Mr. Hen-  
berget? congress in the autumn of 1774, and knew  
the chapter and verse from which he had borrow-  
  
ed the sublime expression, “we must fight,” I  
was not at all’surprised at your history, in the  
122d page, in the note, and in some of the pre-  
ceding and following pages. Mr. Henry only  
pursued, in March, 1775, the views and vows of  
November, 1774.  
  
The other delegates from Virginia returned to  
their state in full confidence that all our griev-  
ances would be redressed. The last words that  
Mr. Richard Henry Lee said te me when we part-  
ed, were, “ we shall infalliably carry all our points.  
You wil! be completely relieved; all the offensive acts  
will be repealed; the army and fleet will be recalled;  
and Britain will give up her foolish project.”  
  
Washington only was in doubt. He never  
spoke in public. In private he joined with those  
who advocated a non-exportation as well as a  
non-importation agreement. With both he  
thought we should prevail; without either he ||  
thought it doubtful. Henry was clear in one opi-  
nion, Richard Henry Lee in ay opposite opinion,  
and Washington doubted between the two. Hen

superficial and ornamental, will always command  
admiration—yet it deserves little veneration.  
Flashes of wit, coruscations of imagination and  
gay pictures—what are thes? Strint ter toy  
reason and pure integrity, are the only essential  
ingredients in sound oratory. I flatter myself  
that Demosthenes, by his “action! action! action!”

lead me too far, and beyond my depth. I must

tict*rv, January 22, hlH.  
Sib 1 thank you for your kind IftIT of the 12th  
of thia month. A* I wioBWi the character of Mr.  
Henry an honor to our country, and your volume  
? ma-trrly delineation of it, I gate order- to pin  
rhaar it aa aoon aa I heard of it: hut waa told it *n  
not to he had in It*ton. 1 have aeen it only, by  
great favor, on loan. A ropy by the autimr would  
he ea teemed worth many hy purchaar. It may he  
?ent ine hy the mail.  
From a peraonal acquaintance. per hap* I might  
ay, a friendship with Mr lienry, and from all I  
have heard or read of him for more than forty yeara,  
I have a I way* enmidarod him a gentleman of deep  
relief lion, keen aagaeity, rlear foreaight, daring  
euterpriae, indexible intrepidity, ami untainted integrity;  
with an ardent ml trr the lihertiea, the  
honor and felicity of hia country and Bpecie*. All  
thia you (juxtly, a? I believe) rcpreaent him to have  
been. There are, however, aoim remarka to lie  
made upon your work, which, if I had eyea and  
handa, I would in the apiritof frirndahip attempt.  
But my hnnda, eyea. ami life, are hut for a moment.  
When t&#x27;ongreea had finished their buaineaa, aa  
they thought. in the autumn of 1774, I had, with  
Mr. Henry, before we took Jeaveof each other, aome  
familiar ronvrraalion, in whieh I exproaaed a full  
conviction thai all our reaolvea, do. la rati, .no of  
rigfita, enumeration of wrenga, petition* and remonatranrca  
and addrcaana, aaaiM-iationa ami nonimportation  
agreeinenta, though they might he expet  
ted by the people of America, and nr. .weary to  
cement their union, would be hut warle water in  
  
I tin gland. Be thought they might be of mnr u*  
among tlie ppfplf ?l Knfl??H, but would he totally  
lost upon the government. I bad jiwt rereived ?  
hMty mkf, written to mc by Major Joseph Haw  
le^r, of Northampton, containing &quot;a frw broken  
lunta,&quot; aa lie railed thein.of what was proper to lie  
lone, lad concluded with the* w#rd? &quot;After all,  
we moat fight.&quot;  
Thla letter I read to Mr. Henry, who listened to  
it with great attention, and hp aoon aa I pi enounced  
the worda &quot;after all, we miwt fight&quot;- lie arreted  
hia head, and, with an energy ano vehemence that  
I mo new forget, broke out with -&quot;By O d. /  
am &lt;d thnt mtin&#x27;i mind&#x27;&quot; I put the letter into hia  
hand, and when he had read it, he returned it to  
me, with an &lt;rpiaJly solemn asseveration, that lie  
agreed entirely in opinion with the writer, 1 considered  
this to he a Marred oath upon a very great  
occasion I could have aworn it aa religiously aa  
he did. It waa no contradiction to what you aay in  
ome part of yonr book- that he never took the  
nain&lt; of God in vain.  
Aa I know the aentimenta with which Mr. Henry  
left Congress in 1774, and knew the . hnpter and  
  
verse from which he hud borrowed the sublime !  
phrase &quot;we must fight,&quot; I wi? not at lill surprised 1 {  
at your history in the 122d page, in the note, and  
some of the preceding and following pages. Mr.  
Henry only pursued in March, 1776, the views and 1  
vows of November, 1774.  
The other delegates from Virginia returned to f  
their State in full confidence that all our grievances H  
would be redressed. The last words which R. H.  
Lee said to me when we parted, were?&quot;We shall, 0  
infallibly, carry all our points. You will be coinplainly  
relieved. All lite offensive acts will be re- fi  
pealed. The army and fleet will be recalled, and p  
Britain will give up her foolish project.&quot; &gt;1  
Washington, only, was in doubt. He never spoke  
in public. In private, he advocated a uon-cxporta- ?  
tion as well as a non-importation agreement. With &gt;&#x27;  
both, he thought, we should prevail; without either,  
be thought it doubtful. Henry was clear in one ij  
opinion; Lee in an opposite opinion; and Washington  
doubted between them.  
Oratory will always command admiration. But &#x27;&#x27;  
it deserve* ho great veneration. It consists in grace t  
of attitude anil motion, intonations of the voice and d  
expressions of the countenance. Could Deinos- u  
thencs comprehend these three things in his action  
?  
To sneak of American orators, ancient or mod­  
  
ern, would lead me too far, and indeed out of my  
depth. I must conclude, with fresh assurances of  
the high esteem of  
Your humble servant,

 QuieY, January 23, 1818.  
Sir: I thank you for your kind letter of  
the 12th of this month.  As I esteem the  
character of Mr. Henry an honor to our  
country, and your volume a masterly de­  
lineation of it, I gave orders to purchase it  
as soon as I heard of it; but was told it was  
  
not to be had in Boston. I have seen it  
only, by great favor, on loan. A copy by  
the author would be esteemed worth many  
by purchase. It may be sent me by the  
mail.  
From a perconal acquaintance, perhaps I  
might say, a friendship with Mr. Henry,  
and from all I have heard or read of him  
for more than forty years, I have always  
considered him a gentleman of deep reflec­  
tion, keen sagacity, clear foresight, daring  
enterprise, inflexible intrepidity and un­  
tainted integrity; with an ardent zeal for  
the liberties, the honor and felicity of his  
country and species. All this you (justly,  
as I believe) represent him to have been.  
There are, however, some remarks to be  
made upon your work, which, if I had eyes  
and hands, I would, in the spirit of friend­  
ship attempt. But my hands, eyes and  
life are but for a moment.  
When Congress had finished their busi­  
ness, as they thought, in the autumn of  
1771, I had, with Mr. Henry, before we  
took leave of each other, some familiar con­  
versation, in which I expressed a full con­  
viction that all our resolves, declarations of  
rights, enumeration of wrongs, petitions  
and remonstrances and addresses, associa­  
tions and non-importation agreements,  
though they might be expected by the  
people of America, and necessary to ce­  
ment their union, would be but waste wa­  
ter in England. He thought they might  
be of some use among the people of Eng­  
land, but would be totally lost upon the go­  
vernment. I had just received a hasty let  
  
ter, written to me by Major Joseph Haw­  
ley, of Northampton, containing &quot;a few  
broken hints,&quot; as he called them, of what  
was proper to be done, and concluding  
with these word--&quot;After all we must  
fight.&quot;  
This letter I read to Mr. Henry, who  
listened to it with great attention, and as  
soon as I pronounced the words--&quot;after all  
we must fight&quot;--he erected his head, and,  
with an energy and vehemence that I can  
never forget, broke out with--&quot;By   
am of that man&#x27;s mind!&quot; I put the let­  
ter into his hand, and when he had read it,  
he returned it to me, with an equally so­  
lemn asseveration, that he agreed entirely  
in opinion with the writer. I considered  
this to be a sacred oath upon a very great  
occasion. I could have sworn it as reli­  
giously as he did. It was no contradic­  
tion to what you say in some part of your  
book,-that he never took the name of God  
in vain.  
As I know the sentiments with which  
Mr. Henry left Congress in 1774, and knew  
the chapter and verse from which he had  
borrowed the sublime phrase &quot;we must  
fight,&quot; I was not at all surprised at your  
history in the 122d page, in the note, and  
some of the preceding and following pages.  
Mr. Henry only pursued in March, 1775,  
the views and vows of November, 1774.  
The other delegates from Virginia re­  
turned to their State in full confidence that  
all our grievances would be redressed.  
The last words which R. I. Lee said to  
me, when we parted, were--&quot;We shall,  
infallibly, carry all our points. You will  
be completely relieved. All the offensive  
acts will be repealed. The army and fleet  
will be recalled, and Britain will give up  
her foolish project.&quot;  
Washington, only, was in doubt. He  
never spoke in public. In private, he ad­  
vocated a non-exportation as well as a non­  
importation agreement. With both, he  
thought, we should prevail: without either,  
he thought it doubtful. Henry was clear  
in one opinion; Lee in an opposite opin­  
ion; and Washington doubted between  
them.  
Oratory will always command admira­  
tion. But it deserves no great veneration.  
It consists in grace of attitude and motion,  
intonations of the voice and expressions of  
the countenance. Could Demosthenes  
comprehend these three things in his  
action?&quot;  
To speak of American orators, ancient or  
modern would lead me too far, and indeed,  
out of my depth. I must conclude, with  
fresh assurances of the high esteem of  
Your humble servant,

Ouinhv. Jannarv Q3 ..101 ft.  
&#x27; Sir : I tbanlt you for your kind letter of the 12th.  
of this month. ; As I esteem the character of Mr.  
Henry fcn honor to. our country,1 and your volums a  
masterly delineation of-it, I gave orders to purchase  
it as soon as I heard of it ; but .was told it was not  
to be had in Boston:&#x27; &quot; I&#x27; hare seen it only, by great  
fevoron loan.&#x27; A&#x27; copy by the author would be es­  
teemed worth many by purchase.;. It may be sent  
me by the mail. ... .. , . - r . ...  
;. From a personal acquaintance, perhaps, t might  
say; a friendship with Mr Henry, and from all I have  
heard or read of him for more than forty years, I &quot;have  
always considered him a gentleman of deep reflection.  
keen sagacity, clear .foresight, daring enterprise, in­  
flexible intrepidity, arid untainted -integrity ; with an  
ardent zeal for the liberties&#x27;, the honor and felicity of  
his country and species. All this you (justly as I  
believe) represeBtiiioLlo haveJeeh r There-are how­  
ever, some remarks .to be made upon your work,  
winch, if I had eyes and hands, I would in the spirit  
of friendship attempt.-. But my hands, eyes, and life,

. When Congress had finished their business, as  
they thought, in the autumn, of 1764,1 had, with Mr.  
Henry, before we took leave of each. otheT, some, fa­  
miliar conversation in which I expressed a full con­

enumerations of wrongs, petitions and remonstran­  
ces and addresses, associations and-non importation  
agreements, though they might be expected by the  
people of America, and necessary to cement their  
union, would be but waste water in England. He  
thought they might be of some use among the peo­  
ple of England, but would be totally lost upon the  
government. I had just received a hasty letter, writ­  
ten tome by Major Joseph Hawley, of Northampton,  
containing &quot;a few broken hints,&quot; as he called them,  
of what was proper to be done, and concluded with  
these words &quot; After all we Tnust fight.&quot;  
This letter I read to Mr. Henry, who listened to it  
with great attention, and as soon as I pronounced the  
words 44 after all, we must fight &quot; he erected his  
head, and, with an energy and vehemence that I can  
never forget, broke out with 44 By Gdt I am of  
that man mind. I pot the letter into his hand, and  
when he had read it, he returned it to me, with an  
equally solemn asseveration, that he agreed entirely

a sacred oath upon a very great occasion. I could  
have 8 worn it as religiously as he did. It was no  
contradiction to what you say in some part of your  
book that he never took the name of God in vain.  
As I know the sentiments with which Mr. Henry  
left Congress in 1774, and new the chapter and verse  
from which he had borrowed the sublime phrase  
44 we must fight, I. was not at all surprised at your  
history in the 122d page, in the note, and some of the  
nrecedingr and following paeres. Mr. Henry only  
pursued in March 1775, the views and vows of No­  
vember, 1774.  
The other delegates from Virginia returned to their  
State in full confidence that all our grievances would

up her foolish project.&#x27;
