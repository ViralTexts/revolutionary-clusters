Treaty—with the—Creeks  
The 2d Article proposes the following boundary—viz.—“from where the former line strikes the River Savannah, thence up the said River to a place on the most Northern branch of the same, commonly called the Keowee, where a No. East line to be drawn from the Top of the Occunna Mountain shall intersect, thence along the said line in a South West direction to Tugaloe River, thence to the top of the Currahee Mountain, thence to the head of the most Southern branch of the Oconee River (that is to say the River Apalachy) including all the Water⟨s⟩ of the same, thence down the said River to the confluence of the Okmulgy, thence on a So. Wt direction to the most Southern part of the River Saint Mary, thence down the said River to the old Line.”  
By the 3d article the Remaining Territory of the Creek Nation was to be solemnly guaranteed to them by the Union—and secured by a line of Posts if necessary.  
Article 4th requires that all the Towns &amp; Tribes of this Nation within the limits of the United States; shall acknowledge them  
  
selves to be under the protection of them and no other Sovereign whosoever—also that they will not treat with any State, or with Individuals of any State.  
Article 5th authorises the Creeks to punish any Settlers on the Guaranteed Lands as they will be put out of the protection of the United States.  
Article 6th—Stipulates a free trade between the United States &amp; the Creek Nation—and gives to the latter a secure Post at Brands b

Article 11th Property to be restored—and all Prisoners to be set at liberty.  
Article 12th Notice of any hostile Intentions of any tribe, or person whosoever, against the Peace, Trade and interest of the United States, is to be given.  
Article 13th All animosities for past grievances shall henceforth cease, and the contracting Parties will carry the foregoing treaty into full effect.  
The first article of this proposed treaty only declared that there should be perpetual Peace between the Citizen⟨s⟩ of the United States, and all the Towns, Tribes and Individuals of the Upper and lower Creeks.

k to the Cherokees exhorting them to be cautious in listening to bad men—and informing them of the promises of the Creeks to conduct themselves peaceably.  
Commissioners  
are decidedly of opinion that the failure of the Treaty at this time with the Creek Nation can be attributed only to their principal chief Mr McGillivray. 1st From the repeated declaration of the Kings-head men &amp; warriors of their wishes to establish a permanent Peace. 2d from the proposed boundary being offered to the Great Council of the Nation only as the Basis of amicable Negotiation. 3d from the deception &amp; precipitate retreat of McGillivray without stating his objections to the draught of a treaty either verbally or in writing. 4th From enquiries &amp; his own declarations, that without obtaining a full equivalent for the Sacrafice he would not renounce the close connexion which he has formed with the Spanish government in the hour of distress—a connexion honourable &amp; lucrative to himself, and advantageous to the Crk Nation.  
5th From his frequent Intimations that no Treaty could be formed unless a free &amp; exclusive Port should be granted to him upon the Altamaha or the River St Mary. And 6th from the most positive refusal to acknowledge the Creek Nation to be within the limits, or under the Protection of the United States, although in express contradiction to a former letter written by him on the 5th of Septr 1785 to General Pickens.  
The Commissioners are moreover of Opinion that the Treaties of

 like on the People of that State—That all animosities with the Creek Nation should henceforth cease. That some person should be dispatched to the said Nation with the ultimate draught of a Treaty to establish perpetual Peace &amp; Amity. That when such a draught of a Treaty shall be properly executed by the leading men of the Nation, all the presents intended for the Indians, and now in the State of Georgia should be distributed among them. That if the Indians shall refuse to execute such draught of a treaty. They humbly submit That the Arms of the Union should be called forth for the Protection of the People of Georgia, in the Peaceable &amp; Just possession of their Lands; and in case the Creeks shall commit further Hostilities &amp; depredations upon the Citizens of the United States that the Creek Nation ought to be deemed the Enemies of the U.
