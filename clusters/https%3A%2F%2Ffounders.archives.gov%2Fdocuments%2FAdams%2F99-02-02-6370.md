Dear Sir  
Quincy post 14 Dec. 1814  
  
Mr Adams’s System is that of Pope, in his Essay on Criticism;  
“First follow Nature and your Judgment frame  
By her just Standard, which is still the Same.”

As few of the Gentlemen of the Theatre, I believe, venture to look into any other

iples were not  
commonplace to Pope’s own generation,  
but that, on the contrary, when the  
Essay is taken in relation to the  
courseof literature from Aristotle down  
through the Middle Ages to the time  
of Queen Anne, it is seen to mark an  
epoch. And the main significance of  
this epoch is, as I understand Mr.  
Courthope, the return after a long  
interval to a conception of the rela-

Aristotle poetry is “a direct imitation

ch Forestry Chief  
Fernow says is the proper number to grow upon an  
acre. Again, a hemlock tree will grow in the shade  
where a white pine tree will die, and hence | presume  
by mixing hemlocks and white pines, as is the case in  
Durham, more trees can be grown to the acre than  
there could be of white pines alone.  
  
I must admit that what little I know of forestry has  
been obtained from something more than half a cen-  
tury of observation of the forests themselves, and with  
but little benefit from the books published on this  
subject. In boyhood I had followed Pope’s precept
