larly inform. I feel myself happy in being the person thro’ whom the Marquis has conveyed this early trophy of the Spoils of Despotism and the first ripe ⟨fru⟩its of American principles transplanted into ⟨Eur⟩ope to his great Master and Patron—when he mentioned to me the present he entended you my heart leaped with Joy—It is something so truly in character that no remarks can illustrate it, and is more happily expressive of his remembrance of his American friends than any letters can convey. That the principles of America opened the Bastile is not to be doubted, and therefore the Key comes to the right place.  
I beg leave to suggest to your Excellency the propriety of congratulating the King and Queen of France (for they have been our friends) and the National assembly on the happy example they are giving to Europe. You will see by the King’s Speech, which I enclose that he prides himself on being at the head of the Revolution, and I am certain that such a congratulation will be well received and have a good effect.  
I should rejoice to be the direct bearer of the Marquis’s present to your Excellency but I doubt I shall not be able to see my much loved America till next spring. I shall therefore send it by some American Vessel to New York. I have permitted no drawing to be taken here, tho’ it has been often requested, as I think there is a propriety that it should first be presented.  
⟨But⟩ Mr West wishes Mr Trumbull to make a painting ⟨of⟩ the presentation of the Key to you.

So little did these Frenchmen realise the tremen-  
dous march of events in France, or the cause of the  
storm, which really was the American Republic. There  
were evils in France, though rather fewer than in other  
nations of Europe, and none to excite a revolution. It  
was a vision of the Golden Age across the Atlantic  
which possessed France. Paine wrote to Washing-  
ton, ‘‘that the principles of America opened the Bas-  
tille is not to be doubted, and therefore the Key comes  
to the right place.”  
  
Early in May, 1791, Lafayette writes to Washing-  
ton: ‘*I send you the rather indifferent translation of  
Mr. Paine [‘ Rights of Man,’ Part I.] as a kind of  
preservative and to keep me near you.”
