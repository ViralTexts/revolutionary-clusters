My Dear  
Phyladelphia June 11. 1775  
  
I have been this Morning to hear Mr. Duffil, a Preacher in this City whose Principles, Prayers and Sermons more nearly resemble those of our New England Clergy than any that I have heard.  
His Discourse was a kind of Exposition on the thirty fifth Chapter of Isaiah.—America was the Wilderness and the Solitary Place, and he said it would be glad, rejoice, and blossom as the Rose. He laboured to strengthen the weak Hands, and confirm the feeble Knees. He said to them that were of a fearful Heart, be strong, fear not: behold your God will come with Vengeance, even God with a Recompence will come and save you. No Lyon shall be there, nor any ravenous Beast shall go up thereon, but the redeemed shall walk there—&amp;c.  
He applied the whole Prophecy to this Country, and gave us, as animating an Entertainment, as I ever heard. He fill’d and swell’d the Bosom of every Hearer.  
I hope you have received a Letter, in which I inclosed you, a Pastoral Letter from the Synod of New York and Phyladelphia: by this you will see that the Clergy, this Way, are but now beginning to engage in Politicks, and they engage with a fervour that will produce wonderfull Effects.  
  
  
June 17  
  
I can now inform you that the Congress have made Choice of the modest and virtuous, the amiable, generous and brave George Washington Esqr., to be the General of the American Army, and that he is to repair as soon as possible to the Camp before Boston. This Appointment will have a great Effect, in cementing and securing the Union of these Colonies.—The Continent is really in e

 others wrote me often, last Fall—not a Line from them this Time.  
I have found this Congress like the last. When We first came together, I found a strong Jealousy of Us, from New England, and the Massachusetts in Particular. Suspicions were entertained of Designs of Independency—an American Republic—Presbyterian Principles—and twenty other Things. Our Sentiments were heard in Congress, with great Caution—and seemed to make but little Impression: but the longer We sat, the more clearly they saw the Necessity of pursuing vigorous Measures. It has been so now. Every Day We sit, the more We are convinced that the Designs against Us, are hostile and sanguinary, and that nothing but Fortitude, Vigour, and Perseverance can save Us.  
But America is a great, unwieldy Body. Its Progress must be slow. It is like a large Fleet sailing under Convoy. The fleetest Sailors must wait for the dullest and slowest. Like a Coach and six—the swiftest Horses must be slackened and the slowest quickened, that all may keep an even Pace.  
It is long since I heard from you. I fear you have been kept in continual Alarms. My Duty and Love to all. My dear Nabby, Johnny, Charly and Tommy come here and kiss me.  
We have appointed a continental Fast. Millions will be upon their Knees at once before their great Creator, imploring his Forgiveness and Blessing, his Smiles on American Councils and Arms

looked upon as their intemperate zeal:  
  
“T have found this Congress like the last. &quot;When we first came  
together I found a strong jealousy of us from New England, and  
the Massachusetts in particular. Suspicions entertained of designs  
of independency; an American republic; Presbyterian principles,  
and twenty other things; but the longer we sate the more clearly  
they saw the necessity of pushing vigorous measures. It has been  
so now. Every day we sit the more we are convinced that the  
designs against us are hostile and sanguinary, and that nothing but  
fortitude, vigor, and perseverance can save us. But America is an  
unwieldy body. Its progress must be slow. It is like a large fleet  
sailing under convoy —the fieetest sailors must wait for the dullest  
and slowest. Like a coach and six—the swiftest horses must be  
slackened, and the slowest quickened, that all may keep an even  
pace. Itis long since I heard from you. I fear you have been  
kept in continual alarms. My duty and love to all. My dear chil-  
dren, come here and kiss me. We have appointed a continental  
fast. Millions will be upon their knees at once, imploring His for-  
giveness and blessing; His smiles on American councils and arms.
