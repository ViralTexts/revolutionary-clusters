To the Senate and  House of Representatives of the United States.—  
Nov. 8. 1808.  
  
  
  
It would have been a source, fellow Citizens, of much gratification if our last communications from Europe had enabled me to inform you, that the belligerent nations, whose disregard of neutral rights has been so destructive to our commerce, had become awakened to the duty and true policy of revoking their unrighteous edicts. that no means might be omitted to produce this salutary effect, I lost no time in availing myself of the Act Authorising a suspension in whole or in part of the several embargo laws. our Ministers at London and Paris were instructed to explain to the respective governments there, our disposition to exercise the Authority in such manner as would withdraw the pretext on which the Aggressions were originally founded, and open the way for a renewal of that commercial intercourse which it was alledged, on all sides had been reluctantly obstructed. As each of those governments had pledged it’s readiness to concur in renouncing a measure which reached it’s adversary through the incontestable rights of neutrals only, and as the measure had been assumed by each as a retaliation for an asserted acquiescence in the aggressions of the other, it was reasonably expected that the occasion would have been seized by both for evincing the sincerity of their professions, and for restoring to the commerce of the U.S. it’s legitimate freedom. the instructions to our Ministers with respect to the different belligerents were necessarily modified with a reference to their different circumstances, and to the condition annexed, by law to the Executive power of suspension requiring a degree of security to our commerce which would not result from a repeal of the Decrees of France. instead of a pledge therefore for a suspension of the embargo as to her in case of such a repeal it was presumed that a sufficient inducement might be found in other considerations and particularly in the change produced by a compliance with our just demands by one belligerent, and a refusal by the other, in the relations between this other and the U.S. to Great Britain, whose power on the Ocean is so ascendant, it was deemed not inconsistent with that condition to state explicitly, that on her rescinding her orders in relation to the U.S. their trade would be opened with her, and remain shut to her enemy, in case of his failure to rescind his Decrees also. from France no answer has been received, nor any indication that the requisite change in her decrees is contemplated. the favorable reception of the proposition to Great Britain was the less to be doubted as her Orders of Council had not only been referred for their vindication to an Acquiescence on the part of the U.S. no longer to be pretended, but as the arrangement proposed, whilst it resisted the illegal decrees of France, involved moreover substantially, the precise advantages professedly aimed at by the British Orders the Arrangement has nevertheless been rejected.  
This candid and liberal experiment having thus failed and no other event having occurred on which a suspension of the embargo by the Executive was Authorised, it necessarily remains in the extent originally given to it. we have the satisfaction however to reflect that in return for the privations imposed by the measure, and which our fellow Citizens in general have borne with patriotism, it has had the important effects of saving our mariners, and our vast mercantile property, as well as of affording time for prosecuting the defensive and provisional measures called for by the occasion. it has demonstrated to foreign nations the moderation &amp; firmness which govern our councils, and to our Citizens the necessity of uniting in support of the laws and the rights of their country, and has thus long frustrated those usurpations and spoliations which, if resisted involved war, if submitted to, sacrificed a vital principle of our national independence.  
Under a continuance of the belligerent measures, which in defiance of laws which consecrate the rights of neutrals, overspread the Ocean with danger, it will rest with the wisdom of Congress to decide on the course best adapted to such a state of things, and bringing with them, as they do, from every part of the Union, the sentiments of our Constituents, my confidence is strengthened that in forming this decision they will, with an unerring regard to the escential rights and interests of the nation, weigh and compare the painful alternatives out of which a choice is to be made. nor should I do justice to the virtues which on other occasions have marked the character of our fellow Citizens, if I did not cherish an equal confidence that the alternative chosen, whatever it may be, will be maintained with all the fortitude and patriotism which the crisis ought to inspire.  
The documents containing the correspondences on the subject of the foreign edicts against our commerce with the instructions given to our Ministers at London and Paris are now laid before you.  
The communications made to Congress at their last session explained the posture in which the close of the discussions relating to the attack by a British Ship of War on the frigate Chesapeak left a subject on which the nation had manifested so honorable a sensibility. every view of what had passed authorised a belief that immediate steps would be taken by the British Government for redressing a wrong, which the more it was investigated appeared the more clearly to require what had not been provided for in the Special mission. it is found that no steps have been taken for the purpose. on the contrary it will be seen, in the documents laid before you, that the inadmissible preliminary which obstructed the adjustment, is still adhered to; and moreover that it is now brought into connection with the distinct and irrelative case of the Orders in Council. the instructions which had been given to our Minister at London, with a view to facilitate if necessary, the reparation claimed by the U.S. are included in the documents communicated.  
Our relations with the other Powers of Europe have undergone no material changes since your last session. the important negociations with Spain, which had been alternately suspended and resumed, necessarily experience a pause, under the extraordinary &amp; interesting crisis which distinguishes her internal situation.  
With the Barbary Powers we continue in harmony, with the exception of an unjustifiable proceeding of the Dey of Algiers towards our Consul to that regency. It’s character and circumstances are now laid before you, and will enable you to decide how far it may, either now or hereafter, call for any measures not within the limits of the Executive Authority.  
With our Indian neighbors the public peace has been steadily maintained, some instances of individual wrong have, as at other times, taken place. but in no wise implicating the will of the nation, beyond the Missisipi the Ioways, the Sacs and the Alibamas have delivered up for trial and punishment individuals from among themselves accused of murdering Citizens of the U.S. on this side the Missisipi the Creeks are exerting themselves to arrest offenders of the same kind, and the Choctaws have manifested their readiness and desire for amicable and just arrangements respecting depredations committed by  disorderly persons of  their tribe. And generally, from a conviction, that we consider them as a part of ourselves and cherish with sincerity their rights and interests, the attachment of the Indian tribes is gaining strength daily, is extending from the nearer to the more remote, and will amply requite us for the justice and friendship practised towards them. husbandry and houshold manufacture are advancing among them more rapidly with the Southern than northern tribes, from circumstances of soil and climate: and one of the two great divisions of the Cherokee Nation have now under consideration to solicit the Citizenship of the U.S. and to be identified with us in laws and government, in such progressive manner as we shall think best.  
In consequence of the appropriations of the last Session of Congress for the security of our Seaport towns and harbors, such works of defense have been erected as seemed to be called for by the situation of the several places, their relative importance and the scale of expense indicated by the amount of the appropriation. these works will chiefly be finished in the course of the present season, except at New York and New Orleans, where most was to be done, and altho a great proportion of the last appropriation has been expended on the former place, yet some further views will be submitted to Congress for rendering it’s security entirely adequate against naval enterprize. a view of what has been done at the several places, and of what is proposed to be done, shall be communicated as soon as the several reports are received.  
Of the Gunboats Authorised by the Act of December last, it has been thought necessary to build only one hundred and three in the present year. these, with those before possessed, are sufficient for the Harbours and waters most exposed, and the residue will require little time for their construction when it shall be deemed necessary.  
Under the Act of the last Session for raising an additional military force, so many Officers were  immediately appointed as were necessary for carrying on the business of recruiting, and in proportion as it advanced, others have been added.  we have reason to believe their success has been satisfactory, altho’ such returns have not yet been received as enable me to present you  a statement of the numbers engaged.  
I have not thought it necessary, in the course of the last season to call for any general detachments of militia or of Volunteers, under the laws passed for that purpose. for the ensuing season however they will be required to be in readiness should their service be wanted. some small and special detachments have been necessary to maintain the laws of embargo on the portion of our northern frontier which offered peculiar facilities for evasion. but these were replaced as soon as it could be done by bodies of new recruits. by the aid of these, and of the armed vessels called into service in other quarters, the Spirit of disobedience and abuse, which manifested itself early, and with sensible effect while we were unprepared to meet it, has been considerably repressed.  
Considering the extraordinary character of the times in which we live our attention should unremittingly be fixed on the safety of our country. for a people who are free, and who mean to remain so, a well organized and armed militia is their best security. it is therefore incumbent on us, at every meeting, to revise the condition of the militia, &amp; to ask ourselves if it is prepared to repel a powerful enemy at every point of our territories exposed to invasions. some of the States have paid a laudable attention to this object. but every degree of neglect is to be found among others. Congress alone having the power to produce an uniform state of preparation in this great Organ of defence, the interests which they so deeply feel in their own &amp; their country’s security will present this as among the most important objects of their deliberation.  
Under the Acts of Mar: 11. &amp; Apr: 23. respecting arms, the difficulty of procuring them from abroad, during the present situation and dispositions of Europe, induced us to direct our whole efforts to the means of internal supply. the public factories have therefore been enlarged additional machineries erected, and in proportion as artificers can be found or formed, their effect, already more than doubled, may be increased so as to keep pace with the yearly increase of the Militia.  the Annual sums appropriated by the latter act have been directed to the encouragement of private factories of arms, and contracts have been entered into with Individual undertakers to nearly the amount of the first years appropriation.  
The suspension of our foreign commerce, produced by the injustice of the belligerent Powers, and the consequent losses and sacrifices of our Citizens, are subjects of just concern. the situation into which we have thus been forced has impelled us to apply a portion of our industry and Capital to internal manufactures and improvements. the extent of this conversion is daily increasing and little doubt remains that the establishments formed and forming will, under the Auspices of cheaper materials and subsistence, the freedom of labor from taxation with us, and of protecting duties and prohibitions, become permanent. the commerce with the Indians too, within our own boundaries is likely to  receive abundant aliment from the same internal source and will secure to them peace and the progress of civilization undisturbed by practices hostile to both.  
The accounts of the receipts and expenditures during the year ending on the 30th. day of September last, being not yet made up, a correct statement will hereafter be transmitted from the Treasury. in the mean time it is ascertained that the receipts have amounted to near eighteen millions of Dollars, which with the eight millions and an half in the treasury at the beginning of the year, have enabled us, after meeting the current demands &amp; interest incurred, to pay two millions three hundred thousand dollars of the principal of our funded debt, and left us in the treasury on that day near fourteen millions of dollars. of these, five millions three hundred and fifty thousand dollars will be necessary to pay what will be due on the first day of January next; which will complete the reimbursement of the eight per cent stock. these paiments with those made in the six years and an half preceding, will have extinguished thirty three  millions five hundred and eighty thousand dollars of the principal of the funded debt, being the whole  which could be paid or purchased within the limits of the law and of our contracts, &amp; the amount of principal thus discharged will have liberated the revenue from about two millions of dollars of interest, and added that sum annually to the disposable Surplus. the probable accumulation of the surplus is of revenue, beyond what can be applied to the paiment of the public debt, when ever the freedom and safety of our commerce shall be restored, merits the consideration of Congress. shall it be unproductive in the public vaults? shall the revenue be reduced? or shall it not rather be appropriated to the improvements of roads, canals, rivers, education, and other great foundations of prosperity and union under the powers which Congress may already possess, or such amendment of the constitution as may be approved by the States? while uncertain of the course of things, the time may be advantageously employed in obtaining the powers necessary for a system of improvement should that be thought best.  
Availing myself of this the last occasion which will occur of addressing the two House of Legislature at their meeting, I cannot omit the expression of my sincere gratitude, for the repeated proofs of confidence manifested to me, by themselves and their predecessors since my call to the administration, and the many indulgencies experienced at their hands. the same grateful acknolegements are due to my fellow Citizens generally whose support has been my great encouragement under all embarrassments. in the transaction of their business I cannot have escaped error. it is incident to our imperfect nature: but I may say with truth my errors have been of the understanding, not of intention, and that the advancement of their rights and interests has been the constant motive for every measure. on these considerations I solicit their indulgence. looking forward with anxiety to their future destinies, I trust that in their steady character unshaken by difficulties, in their love of liberty, Obedience to law, &amp; support of the public Authorities, I see a sure guarantee of the permanence of our republic; and retiring from the charge of their affairs I carry with me the consolation of a firm persuasion that Heaven has in store for our beloved country, long Ages to come of prosperity and happiness.

IT would have been a source,  
fellow citizens, of much gratifica-  
tion, if our last communications,  
from Europe had enabled me to  
inform you, that the belligerent  
nations, whose disregard of neu-  
tral rights has been so destruc-  
tive to our commerce, had be-  
come awakened to the duty and  
true policy of revoking their un-  
righteous edicts. That no means  
might be omitted to produce this  
salutary effect, I lost no time in  
availing myself of the act autho-  
rising a suspension, in whole or  
in part, of the several embargo  
laws. Our ministers at London  
and Paris ait instructed to ex-  
plain to the respective govern-  
ments there, our ispediion to  
exercise the authority in such  
manner as would withdraw the  
pretext on which the aggressions  
were originally founded, and open  
_ the way for a renewal of that com-  
mercial intercourse 4vhich it was  
  
alledged on all sides had been re-  
luctantly obstructed. As each of  
those governments had pledged  
its readiness to concur in renour-  
cing a measure which reached its |  
adversary through the incontesti-  
ble rights of neutrals only, and as  
the measure had been assumed  
by each as a retaliation for an as-  
serted acquiescencein the aggres-  
sions of the other, it was reason-  
ably expected that the occasion  
would have been seized by both  
for evincing the sincerity of their  
professions, and for restoring to  
the commerce of the United  
States its legitimate «freedom.  
The instructions to our ministers,  
with respect to the different be!-  
ligerents, were necessarily modi-  
fied with a reference to their dif-  
ferent circumstances, and to the  
condition annexed by law to the  
executive power of suspension,  
requiring a degree of security to  
our commerce which would not  
result from a repeal of thedecrees  
of France. Instead of a pledge,  
therefore, for a suspension of the  
embargo as to her in case of such  
a repeal, it was presumed that a  
sufficient inducement might be  
found in other considerations, and  
particularly in the change produ-  
ced by a compliance with our just  
demands by one belligerent, and  
a.refusal by the other, in the rela-

tions between this other and the  
United States. To Great Bri-  
tain, whese power on the ocean is  
so ascendant, it was deemed not  
inconsistent with that condition to  
state explicitly, that on her res-  
cinding her orders in relation to  
the United States, their trade  
would be opened with her, and  
remain shut to her enemy, in case  
of his failure to rescind his de-  
crees also. From France no an-  
swer has been received, nor  
any indication that the requisite  
change in her decrees is con-  
templated. The favorable re-  
ception of the proposition to Great  
Britain was the less to be doubt-  
ed as her orders of council had  
not only been referred for their  
vindication to an acquiescence on  
the part of the United States no  
longer to be pretended, but as the  
arrangement proposed, whilst it  
resisted the illegal decrees of  
France, inyolved, moreover, sub-  
stantially, the precise advantages  
professedly aimed at *by the Bri-  
tish orders. The arrangement  
has, nevertheless, been rejected.  
This candid and liberal experi-  
ment having thus failed, and no  
other event having occurred on  
which a suspension of the embar-  
go by the executive was authori-  
zed, it necessarily remains in the  
extent originally given to it. We  
have the satisfaction, however, to  
reflect, that in return for the pri-  
vations imposed by the measure,  
and which our fellow-citizens in  
general have borne with patriot-  
ism, it has had the important ef-  
  
‘fects of saving our mariners, and  
  
our vast mercantile property, .as  
well as of affording time for pro-  
secuting the defensive and_pro-  
visional measures ealled for by  
the occasion. It has demonstra-  
  
ted to foreign nations the mode-  
ration and firmness which govern  
our councils, and to our citizens  
the necessity of uniting in support  
of the laws and the rights of  
their country, and has, thus long  
frustrated those usurpations and  
spoliations which, if resisted, in-  
volved war, if submitted to, sa-  
crificed a vital principle of our  
national independence.  
  
Under a continuance of the  
belligerent measures, which, in  
defiance of laws which conse-  
crate the rights of neutrals, over-  
spread the ocean with danger, it  
will rest with the wisdom of con-  
gress to decide on the course best  
adapted to such a state of things 5  
and bringing with them, as they  
do, from every part of the union,  
the sentiments of our constitu-  
ents, my confidence is strength-  
ened that in forming this decision,  
they’ will, with an unerring re-  
  
rd to the essential rights and  
interests of the nation, weigh and  
compare the painful alternatives  
out of which a choice is to be  
made. Nor should I do justice to  
the virtues, which, on other occa-  
sions have marked the character  
of our fellow citizens, if I did not  
cherish an equal confidence, that  
the alternative chosen, whatever  
it may be, will be maintained  
with all the fortitude and patri-  
otism which the crisis ought. to  
inspire.  
  
The documents containing the  
correspondences. on the subject  
of the foreign edicts against our  
commerce, with the instructions  
given to our ministers at Lon-  
  
don and Paris, are now laid be-

clese of the discussions. relative  
to the attack by a British ship of  
war on the frigate Chesapeake  
left a subject on which the na-  
tion had manifested so hono-  
rable a sensibility. Every view  
of what had passed authorized a  
belief that immediate steps would  
be taken by the British govern-  
ment. for redressing a wrong,  
which, the more it was investi-  
gated, appeared the more clearly  
to require what had not been pro-  
vided for in the special mission.  
  
It is found that no steps have  
been taken for the purpose. On  
the contrary it will be seen in the  
documents laid before you, that  
the inadmissible preliminary,  
which obstructed the adjustment,  
is still adhered to; and, moreo-  
ver, that it is now brought into  
connection with the distinct and  
irrelevant case of the orders in  
council. The instructions which  
had been given to our minister at  
London, with a view to facilitate,  
if necessary, the reparation claim-  
ed by the United States, are in-  
cluded in the documents commu-  
nicated.  
  
Our relations with the other  
powers of Europe have under-  
gone no material changes since  
The impor-  
tant negociations with Spain,  
which had been alternately sus-  
pended and resumed, necessarily  
experience a pause, under the  
extraordinary and interesting cri-  
sis which distinguishes her inter-  
nal situation, .  
  
With the Barbary powers we  
continue in harmony, with the  
exception of an unjustifiable pro-  
ceeding of the dey of Algiers to-  
wards our consul to that regency.  
Its character and circumstances  
are now laid before you, and will  
  
enable you to decide how far it  
may either now or hereafter call  
for any measures not within the  
limits of the executive authority.  
  
With our Indian neighbors the  
public peace has been steadily  
maintained. Some instances of  
individual wrong have, as at other  
times taken place, but in no wise  
implicating the will of the nation.  
Beyond the Mississippi the Io-  
ways, the Sacs, and the Alibamas,  
have delivered up for trial and  
punishment, individuals from 2-  
mong themselves,accused of mur-  
dering citizens of the United  
States. On this side of the Mis-  
sissippi, the Creeks are exerting  
themselves to arrest offenders of  
the same kind, and the Choctaws  
have manifested their readiness  
and desire for amicable and just  
arrangements respecting depre-  
dations committed by disorderly  
persons of their tribe. And, ge-  
nerally from a conviction that we  
consider them as a part of our-  
selves, and cherish, with sinceri-  
ty, their rights and interests, the  
attachment of the Indian tribes is  
gaining strength daily, is extend-  
ing from the nearer to the more  
remote, and will amply requite us  
for the justice and friendship prac  
tised towards them. Husbandry  
and household manufacture are  
advancing among them, more ra-  
pidly with the southern than  
northern tribes, from circumstan-  
ces of soil and climate, and one of  
the two great divisions of the  
Cherokee nation, have now under  
consideration to solicit the citi-  
zenship of the United States, and  
to be identified with us in laws  
and government in such progres-  
sive manner as we shall think  
best.

priations of the last session of  
congress for the security of our  
sea-port towns and harbors, such.  
works ef defence have been erect-  
ed as seemed to be called fer by  
the situation of the several pla-  
ces, their relative importance, and  
the scale of expense indicated by  
the amount of the appropriation.  
These works will chiefly be fi-  
nished in the course of the pre-  
sent season, except at New-York  
and New-Orleans, where most  
was to be done: and although a  
great proportion of the last ap-  
propriation has been expended on  
the former place, yet some fur-  
ther views will be submitted to  
congress for rendering its secu-  
rity entirely adequate against na-  
val enterprize. “A view of what  
has been done at the several pla-  
ces, and of what is proposed to be  
done, shall be communicated as  
soon as the several reports are  
received.  
  
Of the gun-boats authorised by  
the act of December last, it has  
been thought necessary to build  
only one hundred and three in  
the present year. These, with  
those before possessed, are sufli-  
cient for the harbors and waters  
most. exposed, and the residue  
will require little time for their  
construction when it shall be deem-  
ed necessary. Under the act of  
the last session for raising an ad-  
ditional military force, so many  
officers were immediately ap-  
pointed as were necessary for  
carrying on the business of re-  
cruiting, and in proportion as it  
advanced, others have been ad-  
ded. We have reason to believe  
their success has been satisfacto-  
ry, although such returns have  
net yet been received as enable  
  
AMERICAN REGISTER:  
  
me to present you a statement of  
the numbers engaged.  
  
I have not thought it necessary,  
in the course of the last session to  
call for any general detachments  
of militia or of volunteers, under  
the laws passed for that purpose.  
For the ensuing season, however,  
they will be required to be in  
readiness, should their service be  
wanted. Some small and spécial  
detachments have been necessary  
to maintain the laws of embargo,  
on that portion of our northern  
frontier which offered peculiar  
facilities for evasion, but these  
were replaced, as soon as it could  
be done, by bodies of new recruits.  
By the aid of these, and of the  
armed vessels called into service  
in other quarters, the spirit of  
disobedience and abuse, which  
manifested itself early, and with  
sensible effect ®hile we were un-  
prepared to meet it, has been  
considerably repressed. :  
  
Considering the extraordinary  
character of the times in which  
we live, our attention should un-  
remittingly be fixe: on the safety  
of our country. For a people who  
are free, and who mean to remain  
so, a well organized and armed  
militia is their best security. Itis  
therefore incumbent on us, at eve-  
ry meeting, to revise the condi-  
tion of the militia, and to ask our-  
selves if it is prepared to repel a  
powerful enemy at every point of  
our territories exposed to inva-  
sion? Some of the states- have  
paid a laudable attention to this  
object: but every degree of ne-  
glect is to be found among others.  
Congress alone having the power  
to produce an uniform state of  
preparation in this great organ of  
defence, the interests which they

so deeply feel in their own and  
their country’s security, will pre-  
sent this as among the most im-  
portant objects of their delibera-  
tion.  
  
Under the acts of March ele-  
venth and April twenty-third, res-  
pecting arms, the difficulty of  
procuring them from abroad  
during the present situation and  
dispositions of Europe, induced  
us to direct our whole efforts to  
the means of internal supply.  
The public factories have there-  
fore been enlarged, additional  
machineries erected, and in pro-  
portion as artificers can be found  
or formed, their effect, already  
more than doubled, may be in-  
creased so as to keep pace with  
the yearly increase of the militia.  
The annual sums appropriated by  
the latter act have been directed  
to the encouragement of private  
factories of arms, and contracts  
have been entered into with indi-  
vidual undertakers to nearly the  
amount of the first year’s appro-  
priation.  
  
The suspension of our foreign  
commerce, produced by the in-  
justice of the belligerent powers,  
and the consequent losses and sa-  
crifices of our citizens, are sub-  
jects of just concern. The situ-  
ation into which we have thus  
been forced has impelled us to  
apply a portion of our industry  
and capital to internal manufac-  
tufes and improvements. The  
extent of this conversion is daily  
increasing, and little doubt re-  
mains that the establishments  
formed and forming, will, under  
the auspices of cheaper materi-  
als and subsistence, the freedom  
of labor from taxation with us,  
and of protecting duties and pro-  
hibitions, become permanent.

The commerce with the Indians  
too, within our own boundaries,  
is likely to receive abundant ali-  
ment from the same internal  
source, and will secure to them  
peace and the progress of civili-  
zation undisturbed by practices  
hostile to both.  
  
The accounts of the receipts  
and expenditures during the year  
ending on the thirtieth day of  
September last, being not yet  
made up, a correct statement  
will hereafterbe transmitted from  
the treasury. Inthe mean time  
it is ascertained that the receipts  
have amounted to near eighteen  
millions of dollars, which, with  
the eight millions and a half  
in the treasury at the beginning  
of the year, have enabled us after  
meeting the current demands,  
and interest incurred, to pay two  
millions three hundred thousand  
dollars of the principal of our  
funded debt, and left us in the  
treasury on that day near fourteen  
millions of dollars. Of these,  
five millions three hundred and  
fifty thousand dollars, will be ne-  
cessary to pay what will be due  
on the first day of January next,  
which will complete the reim-  
bursement of the eight per cent.  
stock. ‘These payments, with  
those made in the six years and  
a half preceding, will have ex-  
tinguished thirty-three millions  
five hundred and eighty thousand  
dollars ot the principal of the  
funded debt, being the whole  
which could be paid or purchased  
within the limits of the law and  
of our contracts, and the amount  
of principal thus discharged will  
have liberated the revenue from  
about two millions of dollars of  
interest, and added that sum an-  
nually to the disposable surplus.

The probable accumulation of  
the surpluses of revenue beyond  
what can be applied to the pay-  
ment of the public debt, when-  
ever the freedom and safety of  
our commerce shall be restored,  
merits the consideration of Con-  
gress. Shall it lie unproductive  
in the public vaults? Shall the  
revenue be reduced? Or shall it  
not rather be appropriated to the  
improvements of roads, canals,  
rivers, education, and other great  
foundations of prosperity and  
union under the powers which  
congress may already possess, or  
such amendment of the constitu-  
tion as may be approved by the  
states? While uncertain of the  
course of things the time may be  
advantageously employed in ob-  
taining the powers necessary for  
a system of improvement, should  
that be thought best.  
  
Availing myself of this, the  
last occasion which will occur of  
addressing the two houses of the  
legislature at their meeting, I  
cannot omit the expression of my  
sincere gratitude for the repeated  
proofs of confidence manifested  
tome by themselves and their  
predecessor$ since my to the  
administration, and the many in-  
dulgences eéxperienced at their  
hands. The same grateful ac-  
knowledgments are due to my  
fellow citizens generally, whose  
support has been my great en-  
couragement under all embar-  
rassments. In the transaction of  
their business I cannot have es-  
caped error. It is incident to  
our imperfect nature. But I  
may say with truth my errors  
  
have been of the understanding, .  
  
not of intention, and that the ad-  
vancement of their rights snd in-

Message to both Houses of Congress.  
  
To THE SENATE AND House or REPRESENTATIVES OF THE  
UnitTep STATES.  
  
IT would have been a source, fellow-citizens, of much grati-  
fication, if our last communications from Europe had enabled me  
  
to inform you, that the belligerent nations, whose disregard of  
  
neutral rights has been so destructive to our commerce, had be-  
come awakened to the duty and true policy of revoking their  
unrighteous edicts. That no means might be omitted to produce  
this salutary effect, I lost no time in availing myself of the act  
authorizing a suspension, in whole or in part, of the several  
embargo laws. Our ministers at London and Paris were in-  
structed to explain to the respective governments there, our dis-  
position to exercise the authority in such manner as would with-  
draw the pretext on which the aggressions were originally found-  
ed, and open the way for a renewal of that commercial inter-  
course which it was alledged on all sides had been reluctantly  
obstructed. As each of those governments had pledged its rea-  
diness to concur in renouncing a measure which reached its ad-  
versary through the incontestable rights of neutrals only, and as  
the measure had been assumed by each as a retaliation for an  
asserted acquiescence in the aggressions of the other, it was  
reasonably expected that the occasion would have been seized by  
both for evincing the sincerity of their professions, and for re-  
storing to the commerce of the United States, its legitimate  
freedom. ‘The instructions to our ministers with respect to the  
different belligerents were necessarily moduled with a reference  
to their different circumstances, and to the condition annexed by  
law to the executive power of suspension requiring a degree of  
security to our commerce which would not result from a repeal  
of the decrees of France. Instead of a pledge therefore of a  
suspension of the embargo as to her in case of such repeal, it  
was presumed that a suflicient inducement might be found in  
other considerations, and particularly in the change produced by  
a compliance with our just demands by one belligerent, and re-  
fused by the other, in relations between this other and the United  
States. ‘To Great Britain, whose power on the ocean is so as-  
cendant, it was deemed not inconsistent with that condition, to  
state explicitly that on her rescinding her orders in relation to the

United States their trade would be opened with her, and remain  
shut to her enemy in case of his failure to rescind his decrees  
also. From France no answer has been received, nor any indi-  
cation that the requisite change in her decrees is contemplated.  
The favourable reception of the proposition to Great Britain was  
the less to be doubted, as her orders of council had not only been  
referred for their vindication to an acquiescence on the part of  
the United States no longer to be pretended, but as the arrange-  
ment proposed, whilst it resisted the illegal decrees of France,  
involved moreover substantially, the precise advantages profes-  
sedly aimed at by the British orders. ‘The arrangement has  
nevertheless been rejected.  
  
This candid and liberal experiment having thus failed, and no  
other event having occurred on which a suspension of the em-  
bargo by the executive was authorized, it necessarily remains in  
the extent originally given to it. We have the satisfaction,  
however, to reflect that in return for the privations imposed by  
the measure, and which our fellow citizexs in general have borne  
with patriotism, it has had the important effects of saving our  
mariners and our vast mercantile property, as well as of affording  
time for prosecuting the defensive and provisional measures  
called for by the occasion. It has demonstrated to foreign na-  
tions the moderation and firmness which govern our councils,  
and to our citizens the necessity of uniting in support of the laws  
and the rights of their country; and has thus long frustrated  
those usurpations and spoliations which, if resisted, involved  
war, if submitted to, sacrificed a vital principle of our national  
independence.  
  
Under a continuance of the belligerent measures, which in  
defiance of laws which consecrate the rights of neutrals over-  
spread the ocean with danger, it will rest with the wisdom of  
Congress to decide on the course best adapted to such a state of  
things ; and bringing with them, as they do, from every part of  
the union, the-sentiments of our constituents, my confidence is  
strengthened that in forming this decision, they will, with an un-  
erring regard to the essential rights and interests of the nation,  
weigh and compare the painful alternatives out of which a choice  
is to be made :—Nor should I do justice to the virtues which on  
other occasions have marked the character of our fellow citizens,  
if I did not cherish an equal confidence, that the alternative  
chosen, whatever it may be, will be maintained with all the  
fortitude and patriotism which the crisis ought to inspire.  
  
The documents containing the correspondence on the subject  
  
‘of the foreign edicts against our commerce, with the instructions  
  
given to our ministers at London and Paris, are now laid before  
you.  
  
The communication made to Congress at their last session ex-  
plained the posture in which the close of the discussions relative

to the attack by a British ship of war on the frigate Chesapeake, left a  
subject on which the nation had manifested so honourable a sensibility.  
Every view of what had passed authorized a belief that immediate steps  
would be taken by the Briush government for redressing a wrong, which,  
the more it was investigated, appeared the more clearly to require what  
had not been provided for in the special mission. It is found that no  
steps have been taken for the purpose. On the contrary it wiil be seen  
in the documents laid before you, that the inadmissable preliminary, which  
obstructed the adjustment, is still adhered to; and moreover, that it is  
now brought mto connection with the distinct and irrelative case of the  
orders in council. The instructions which had been given to our minis-  
ter at London, with a view to facilitate, if necessary, the repzration  
claimed by the United States, are included in the documents communi-  
cated.  
  
Our relations with the other powers of Europe have undergene no  
material changes since your last session. The important negeciations  
with Spain, which had been alternately suspended and resumed, neces-  
sarily experience a pause, under the extraordinary and interesting crisis  
which distinguishes her internal situation.  
  
With the Barbary powers we continue in harmony, with the exception  
of an unjustifiable proceeding of the Dey of Algiers towards our consul  
to that regency. Jis character and circumstances are now laid before  
you, and will enable you to decide how far it may either now or hereaf-  
ter call for any measures not within the limits of the executive authority.  
  
With our Indian neighbours the public peace has been steadily main-  
tained.—-Some instances cf individual wrong have, as at other times,  
taken place, but in novvise implicating the will of the nation. Beyond  
the Mississippi, the Ioways, the Sacs, and the Alibamas, haye delivered  
up for trial and punishment individuals from among themselves, accused  
of murdering citizens of the United States. On this side the Missis-  
sippi the Crecks are exerting themscives to arrest offenders of the same  
kind, and the Choctaws have manifested their readiness and desire fcr  
amicable and just arrangements respecting depredations committed by  
disorderly persons of theirtribe. And generally, from a conviction that  
we consider them as a part of ourselves, and cherish with sincerity their  
rights and interests, the attachment of the Indian tribes is gaining strength  
daily, is extending from the nearer to the more remote, and will amply  
requite us for the justice and friendship practised towards them. Hus-  
bandry and household manufacture are advancing among them, more  
rapidly with the southern than northern tribes from circumstances of soil  
and climate, and one of the two great divisions of the Cherokee nation  
have now under consideration to solicit the citizenship of the United  
States, and to be identified with us in laws and governnient in such pro  
gressive manner as we shall think best.  
  
In consequence of the appropriations of the last session ef Congress  
for the security of cur seaport towns and harbours, such works of de-  
fence have becn erected as seemed to be called for by the situation of  
the several places, their relative importance, and the scale of expense  
indicated by the amount of the appropriation. These works will chiefly  
be finished in the course of the present season, except at New-York and  
New-Orleans, where most was to be done: and although a great propor  
tion of the last appropriation has been expended on the former place, yet  
some further views will be submitted to Congress for rendering its secus  
rity entirely adequate against naval enterprize. A view of what has

been done at the several places, and of what is proposed to be done,  
shall be communicated as soon as the several reports are received.  
  
Of the gun boats authorized by the act of December lest, it has been  
thought necessary to build only one hundred and three in the present  
year. These, with those before possessed, are sufficient for the harbours  
and waters most exposed, and the residue will require little time for  
their construction when it shall be deemed necessary.  
  
Under the act of the last session for raising an additional military  
force, so many officers were immediately appointed as were necessary  
for carrying on the business of recruiting, and in proportion as it ad-  
vanced, others have been added. We have reason to believe their suc-  
cess has been satisfactery, although such returns have not yet been  
received as enable me to present you a statement of the numbers engaged.  
  
I have not thought it necessary, in the course of the last season to call  
for any general detachments of militia or of volunteers, under the laws  
passed fer that purpose. For the ensuing season however they will be  
yequired to be in readiness, should their service be wanted. Some snrall  
and special detachments have been necessary to maintain the laws of  
embargo, in that portion of our northern frontier which offered peculiar  
facilities for evasion. But these were replaced as soon as it could be  
done by bodies of new recruits. By the aid of these, and of the armed  
vessels called into service in other quarters, the spirit of disobedtence  
and abuse, which manifested itself early and with sensible effect whils  
we were unprepared to meet it, has been considerably repressed.  
  
Considering the extraordinary character of the times in which we live,  
our attention should unremittingly be fixed on the safety of our country.  
For a people who are free, and who mean to remain so, a well.organized  
and armed militia is their best security. It is therefore incumbent on us,  
at every meeting, to revise the condition of the militia, and to ask our  
selves if it is prepared to repel a powerful enemy at every point of our  
territories exposed to invasion ’ Some of the states have paid a laudable  
attention to this object: but every degree of neglect is to be found among  
others. Congress alone having the power to produce an uniform state  
of preparation in this great organ of defence; the interest which they so  
deeply feel in their own and thei country’s security will present this as  
among the: most important objects of their deliberation,  
  
Under the acts of March 11, and April 23, respecting arms, the  
difficulty of procuring them fron: abread during the present situation and!  
disposition of Europe, induced us to direct eur whole efforts to the  
means of internal supply. ‘Fhe public factories have therefore been  
enlarged, additional machineries erected and in proportion. as artificers:  
can be found or formed, their effect, already more than doubled, may  
be increased, se as to keep pace with the yearly increase of the militia.  
The annual sums appropriated by the latter uct have been directed to the  
encouragement of private factomes of arms, and contracts have beer  
entered into with individual undertakers te nearly the amount of the-first  
year’s appropriation.  
  
The suspension of our foreign commerce, produced by the injustice  
of the belligerent powers, and the consequent losses and sacrifices of  
our citizens, are subjects of just concern. The situation into which we  
have been forced has impelled us to apply a portion: of our industry and  
eapital to internal manufactures-and improvements: The extent of this  
conversion’is-daily increasing, and lite: doubt remains that the establish  
ments formed and forming, will, under the auspices of cheaper materi-

als and subsistence, the freedom of labour ffm taxation with us, and of  
protecting duties and prohibitions, become permanent. The commerce  
with the Indians too, within our own boundaries, is likely to receive abun-  
dant aliment from the same internal source, and will secure to them peace  
and the progress of civilization undisturbed by practices hostile to both.  
The accounts of the receipts and expenditures during the year ending  
on the thirtieth day of September last, being not yet made up, a correct  
statement will hereafter be transmitted from the treasury. In the mean  
time it is ascertained that the receipts have amounted to near eighteen  
millions of dollars, which with the eight millions and an half in the  
treasury at the beginning of the year, have enabled us after meeting the  
current demands, and interest incurred, to pay two millions three hun-  
dred thousand dollars of the principal of cur funded debt, and left us in  
the treasury on ti.at day near fourteen millions of dollars. Of these five  
millions three hundred and fifty thousand dollars will be necessary to pay  
what will be due on the first day of January next, which will complete  
the reimbursement of the eight per-cent stock. These payments, with  
those made in the six years and an half preceding, will have extinguished  
thirty-three millions five hundred and eighty thousand dollars of the  
principal of the funded debt, being the whole which could be paid or  
purchased within the limits of the law and of our contracts, and the  
amount of principal thus discharged will have liberated the revenue from  
about two millions of dollars of interest, and added that sum annually  
to the disposable surplus. ‘The probable accumulation of the surplusses  
of revenue beyond what can be applied to the payment of the public  
debt, whenever the freedom and safety of our commerce shall be re-  
stored, merits the consideration of Congress. Shall it lie unproductive  
in the public vaults! Shall the revenue be reduced? or shall it not rather

Tiie arrangement has nevertheless  
been rejected.  
This candid and liberal experiment  
aaving thus failed, and no other event i  
naving occurred on which a suspen­  
sion of the embargo by the Executive  
was authorised, it necessarily remains  
in the extent originally given to it.  
We have the satisfaction, however, to  
reflect that in return for the privations  
imposed by the measure, and which  
•ur fellow-citizens in general have  
borne with patriotism.) it has had the ■  
Important effects&#x27; of saying our miri- i  
nets and our vast mercantile property, i  
as Well as id&#x27;affording time for prose- ■ &lt;  
the defensive ar.d provisional :

It has demonstrated to foreign ha- &lt;  
i . !■■ mtl fii nines* &lt;  
  
National Intelligencer.  
  
which govern our councils, and to our  
ckizteno the necessity of uniting in  
support of the laws and the rights of  
their country ; and has thus long  
frustrated those usurpations and spo­  
liations which, if resisted involved  
war, it submitted 10, sacrificed a vi­  
tal principle of our national indepen­  
dence.  
Under a continuance of the belli­  
gerent measures, which in defiance of  
laws which consecrate the rights of  
neutrals overspread the Qpcan with  
danger, it will rest with the wisdom  
of Congress to tocide on the course  
adapted to such a state of things ;  
and bringing with them, as they do,  
from every part of the union, the  
sentiments of our constituents, my  
confidence is strengthened that in  
forming this decision, thay will, with  
an unerring regard to the essential  
rights and interests of the nation,  
weigh and compare the painful alter­  
natives out ci which a choice is to be  
made. Nor should Ido justice lo the  
virtues which on other occasions have  
marked the character of our fellow  
citizen-:, if I did not cherish an equal  
confidence, that the alternative cho­  
sen, whatever it may be, will be  
maintained with all the fortitude and  
patriotism which the crisis ought to  
inspire.  
The documents, containing the  
correspondences on the subject of the  
foreign Celicts againil our commerce,  
with llie instructions given to our Mi­  
nisters at London and Paris, are now  
laid before you.  
The communications, made to Co n  
press at their last session, explained  
&#x27;the posture in which the close of&quot; the  
discussions relative to the attack by  
a British ship of war on the frigate  
Chesapeake left a subject on which  
the nation had manifested so honora­  
ble a sensibility. Every view of what  
fcad passed authorised a belief that im­  
rnedialH steps would be taken by the  
British government for redressi  
wrong, which, the more it was inves­  
tigated, appeared the more clearly to  
require what had not been pro­  
for in the special mission. It is found  
no steps have been taken tie the  
purpose. On the contrary it will be  
seen, in the documents 1 id before  
you, that the inadmissiblepre&#x27;limtnary,  
which obstructed the adjustment] is  
still adhered to ; and moreover thai it  
is now brought into connection with  
the distinct and ii relative case of the  
orders in council. The instructions  
which bad hern given to our minister  
at London, with a view to facilitate, if  
necessary, the rep nation claimed by  
the United States, arc included in the  
doc time i its communicated.  
Our relations with tlieoiher powers  
of Europe have, undergone no mate­  
rial changes since your last session.  
The in.po;i,hi ;ons with  
Spain, which had been alternately  
suspended and resumed, necessarily  
experience v pause, under the. ex­  
traordinary and interesting crisis  
which distinguishes her internal si­  
tuation.  
With the Barbary powers we conti­  
nue in harmony] with the exception of  
an unjastifiabje proceeding of the  
Dey of Algiers towards our consul to  
thai regency. Its character and cir­  
cumstances are now laid before you,  
•and will enable yon to &quot;decide hov&lt; far  
it may either now or hereafter call for  
any measures not within the limits of  
the Executive authority.  
With our Indian neighbors the  
public peace has been steadily main­  
tained. Some instances of individual  
wrong htrvC] as at other times, taken  
place, but in no wise implicating the  
will of the nation. Beyond the Mis­  
sissippi the loways, the Sacs and the  
Alibamas have delivered up for trial  
and punishment individuals from a*  
mom; themselves a&lt; eti cd of murder­  
ing citizens&#x27;of the United States. On  
• this side the Mississippi the Cl­  
are exerting themselves to arrest of­  
fenders of the same kind, and the  
Choctaws have manifested their rea­  
cab.i ssand desire bar amicable and  
  
arrangements respecting depredations  
committed hy disorderly persons of  
their tribe. And generally, from a  
conviction that we consider them as a  
part of ourselves, and cherish with  
sincerity their right** and interests,  
the attachment of the Indian tribes is  
gaining strength daily, is extending  
from the nearer to the more remote,  
and will amply requite us for the jus­  
tice and friendship practised towards  
them. Husbandry and household  
manufacture are advancing among  
them, more rapidly with the Southern  
than Northern tribes, from circum­  
stances of soil and climate, and one  
of the two great divisions of the Che­  
rokee nation have now under conside­  
ration to solicit the citizenship of the  
United Slates, and to be identified  
with us in laws and government in  
such progressive maimer as we shall  
think best.  
In consequence of the appropria­  
tions of the last session of Congress  
IV i the security of our seaport towns  
and harbors, such works of defence  
have been erected as seemed to be  
called for by the situation of the   
ral place&#x27;s&quot;, their relative importance,  
and the scale of expense indicated by  
the amount of the appropriation.  
These works Will chiefly be finished  
in the course of the present season,  
except ai New-York and New-Or­  
leans, where most was to be done :  
and al though a great proportion of the  
last appropriation has been expended ,  
on the former place, yet some further &#x27;  
views will be submitted te Con]  
for rendering its security entirely ad &gt;  
quale against naval enterprize. A  
view of wbut has been done at the se­  
veral places, and of what is proposed  
lobe don«», shall be communicated as  
soon as the several reports are receiv­  
ed.  
Of the gun-boats authorised by the  
act of December last, it has been  
thought necessary to build only one  
hundred and three in the present  
year. These, with those before pos­  
sessed, are sufficient for -he harbors  
and waters most exposed, and the re­  
sidue will require littlo time for their  
1 Miction when it snail be deemed  
necessary.  
Under the at&gt;t ofthe I &lt;st session  
For raising an ad lition il military force,  
so many officers were immediately  
appointed as were necessary for Car­  
rying on the business of recruiting,  
and in proportion as it advanced, o­  
tiiers have been added. We have  
reason to believe their success has  
been satisfactory, although such re­  
turns have not yet been received as  
enable vnc to present you a statement  
of th: numbers engaged.  
I have not thought it necessary, in  
the Course of the last season to call  
for any general detachments of mili­  
tia or of volunteers, under the laws  
passed for that purpose. For the en­  
ruing season however they will be re­  
quired io be in readiness, should their  
service be wanted. Some small and  
special detachments have been i.eces­  
to maintain the laws of embargo,  
en that portion of our northern IVon- &#x27;  
tier which offered peculiar facilities  
for evasion. Hut these were replac- &#x27;  
ed as soon as it could be done by &#x27;  
bodies of new ncuits. By ihe aid &#x27;  
of these, and of the armed vessels I  
called into service in other quarters] &#x27;  
the spirit of disobedience and abuse, &#x27;  
which manifested itself early and with &#x27;  
ble eflfcet while we were tyipre &#x27;  
pared to meet it, has been consider*- :  
bly repressi d. &#x27;  
Considering the extraordinary cba- i  
racier of the times in which wv live, 1  
our a tcntioh should uhre-ftiitlingly be f  
fixed on the safety of our country. &#x27;  
For *, people who are i&#x27;rec, and who &#x27;  
mean to remain so, a wri! organised &#x27;  
and armed militia is the ir best seCllri&quot; )  
ly. Itii therefore incumbent on us, I  
at every meeting, to revise the Condi- &#x27;  
tion il the militia, and to r.A our- &#x27;  
,ifit is prepared to repel a pow- I  
erful enemy .it every point of our *  
territories exposed to invasion ? Some *  
ol the states have paid a laudable at- s  
  
* tcnlion to this object : but eve,y dr.-*&#x27;  
f gree of neglect is to be found among  
1 ethers. Congress alotm having the  
1 power lo produce an uniform state of  
1 preparation in this greafDfgan of dft­  
, fence ; the interests which they so  
i deeply feel in their own and their  
r country&#x27;s security will present this  
, as among the most important objects of  
- theit deliberation.  
s Under the acts of March 11, and  
1 April 23, respecting arms, the diffr  
r cully of procuring them from abroad  
i during the present situation and dispo­  
. sitions of Europe, induced us to direct  
» our whole efforts to the means of in­  
- tenia! supply. The public factories  
- have therefore been enlarged, addi­  
s tional machineries crected,and in pro­  
:1 portion as artificers can be foui  
i formed, their effect, already more than  
1 doubled, may be increased) so as to  
keep pace with the yearly increase of  
- the militia. The annual sums appro­  
s priated&#x27; by the latter »c*i have been  
s directed lo the encouragement of pri?  
B vate factories of arms, and ton tract&#x27;s  
c have been cnteri A into with individual  
a undertakers to nearly the amount of  
,j the first year&#x27;s approprHtti  
y The suspension Qfotifc foreign com­  
i, mercc, produced by the injustice of  
1 the belligerent powers, and the con­  
sequent los=cs and sacrifices of our  
. citizens, are subjects of just concern.  
: The situation into v. hich we have thus  
» been forced has impelled iistoapply  
\ a portion of our industry and capital  
v Ito internal manufactures and iniprove­  
s ments. The extent of this conversion  
. is daily increasing, and bale dor  
i mains that the esr . oied

j expenditures during the year ending  
on the thirtieth day of Sept&lt; i  
, being not yet made up, a correct  
( statement will herealWb* transmitted  
r from the treasury. In the mean time

. arid an lv if in the treasury at the  
timing of the year, have  
. bled us after meeting the Sffrrent  
. demands, and interest incurred, to  
pay two millions three hundred thou- [  
sand dollars of the principal of our  
i funded debt, and left.us in the treasury  
I on that day near fourteen millions of  
. dollars. Of these, five millions three  
. hundred and fifty thousand dollars will  
. be necessary to pay what will bo due  
. on the first day of January next, which  
will complete the reimbursement of

How far it may also be proper to impose  
additional duties upon sucli foreign goods, as  
are dr can be manufactured within the Uim­  
Wd States; is certainly a question entitled  
to their deliberation. These aids to D. Ma­

comparatively greater abridgement of trade.  
. • Washington, Nov. 8.  
TMIS *AYi AT 12 o’clock, TUV, HKESI­  
DENT of the Unitk.d States commu­  
nicated. by Mi Coles, hissechkta­  
K I , T.H E FOLLOWING G/i TO both  
Houses of Congress.  
To the &#x27;Senate and Hout&#x27;e of Rdfireaenta­  
, tivcnof the United Stair*.  
It would have been a source, Fellow-Citi­  
zens, of much gratification, if our list com­  
munications from Europe Kad enabled me to  
inform you, that the belligerent nations  
whose disregard of neutral rights has been  
so destructive to our Commerce, had become  
awakenCd to the duty and true policy of re­  
voking their unrighteous edicts. That no  
means might be omitted to produce this sa­  
lutary effect, I lost no time in availing my­  
self of the act aushorising a suspension iri  
whu&#x27;e or in part, of the several embargo  
laws. Our ministers at London and Haris  
were instructed to explain to the respective  
governments therfe, our disposition to exer­  
cise the authority in such manner as would  
  
pretext on wnicn the aggressi­  
ons were originally founded, and open the  
way for a renewal of that commercial inter­  
course which it was allcdged on all sides had  
been reluctantly obstructed. As each of those  
governments had pledged its readiness to  
concur la renouncing a measure whicn reach­  
ed hs adversary through the iricontestible  
rights of neutrals pniy, and as the measure  
had been assumed by each as a retaliation  
tor an asserted acquiescence in the aggressions  
of the .t h r, ic was reasonably expected that  
the occasion would have been seized by both  
for evincing the sincerity of heir professions,  
ami for restoring to the Commerce of the U.’  
States its legitimate freedom. The instruc­  
tions to our ministers with respect to the dif­  
ferent belligerents were necessarily modifi­  
ed with a reference totiicii-different circum­  
stances. and to the condition annexed by law  
to the Executive power ofsuspension, requir­  
ing R degree of security to our Commerce  
which would not rcsiili from a repeal nt the  
decrees of France Instead of a pledge,  
therefore, of a suspension of the embargo as  
to her incase of such repeal, it wa*.pn -min­  
ed tliatjH sufficient inducement might be found  
in other considerations, and particularly in  
the chaifge produced by a compliance with  
c.ur just demands by one belligerent, and a  
refusal by the other, in the relations between  
this other and tlie United States To (treat  
Britain, whose power on the ocean is so as­  
cendant, it was deemed not inconsistent with  
that condition, to state explicitly, that on  
her rescinding her orders in relation to the  
United States, tlieir trade would l&gt;e opened  
with her, and remain shut to her enemy, in  
case of his failure to rescind his decrees itisn.  
From France no answer has been received,  
nor any indication that the requisite clfangtr  
in her decrees is contempla&#x27;cd. The favor­  
able reception of the proposition to Great Bri­  
tain was the less to be doubted as her orders  
&gt;f Council had not only been referred for their  
vindication to an acquiescence on the part of  
the United States no longer to be pretended,  
hut hs the arrangement proposed, whilst it  
resisted the illegal decrees of France, in  
vnlvcd moreover substantially, the precise  
advantages piWssedly aimed at by the Bri­  
tish orders. The arrangement has never­  
, uiclesa been rejected.  
  
. THli candid a«nl liberal experiment hav­  
ing thii&lt; failed, and no otljer ev^nt having  
occm &#x27;rf d nit which :t suspension of the Kin­  
ia»gt» by tl»e,executive was authorised, itne­  
cessardy remains in the extent originally gi­  
ven to it. We have the satisfaction, howeT  
ver, to reflect that in ; slum for the privati­  
ons imposed hvthe pleasure, and whicii our  
tellrvw-citizen-, in general have liorne with  
patriotism, it lias had the important effects  
of saving our mariners ittd on»- vast me yean -  
tile property, as well as of atfo:xling time for  
prosecuting the defenrive and provisional  
measures called for by the occasion. It has  
demotjstratcd to foreign nations the modern  
tioii and firmness which governed onycouu­  
chs, and to our citizens the necessity of uni­  
ting in support of the laws and the rights of  
their country ; a.nd has tints long frustrated  
those usurpations and spoliations which, if  
resisted involved war, if submitted to, sacri­  
ficed a vital principle of our national indepen­  
dence.  
Under a continuahc&#x27;e of tlie belligerent  
measures, which In defiance of laws which  
consecrates the rights of neutrals, over­  
spread the ocean with danger, it will rest  
with the wisdom yf Congress to decide  
on the course best adapted to such a state of  
things; and bringing with them, as they do,  
from every part of the union, the sentiments  
of our constituents, my Confidence is strengih­  
entd that in forming this decision, thvv will  
with an unerring regard tothc essential right*  
and interests of the nation, weigh mid com­  
pare the painful alternativesodt ot which a  
choice is to he made. Nor should 1 do jus­  
tiee to the virtues which on other occasions  
have marked the character of our fellow ci­  
tizens, if I did not cherish an equal confi  
dence, that the alternative chosen, whate  
ver it may be, will he maintained with all  
the fortitude and patriotism which the crisis  
ought to inspire.  
  
| i lie documents Containing thr» rnrrpQnnn I  
cleiH-.es on tile subject of the foreign edicts  
against our commerce, with the instruction­  
giren to our ministers at London and Paris  
are now laid before you.

their last session, explained the :i rur. in  
which the close of the discussions reiat &#x27;■  
the attack by a British ship ot war on tm- ;  
frigate Chesapeake, left a subject or. which ;  
the nation had manifested so h .aorablr  
sensibility. Every view of what hud pas.-e 1 j  
authorised a belief that immedi ite s ep &gt;  
would be taken by the Hfitidi y wcrninem  
for redressing a wrong, which, toe more i‘  
was investigated, appeared ’.he more clear­  
ly to requite, what had nut be provided for  
m the special mission. It is Found that no  
steps have been taken for the purpose. On  
the contrary it Will be seen, in ti\e documents  
lu&gt;d before you, that the inadmissible pre.i­  
minary, which obstiO.tcd tne adjustment,  
is still adhered to; and moreover that it is  
now brought into connection with the distinct  
and irrelative case of the orders in council  
1 lie instructions which had.beer given to our  
minister at London, with a view to ficili  
tate, if necessary, the reparation claimed  
by the United States, are included in the do­  
cuments communicated.  
Our relations with the other powers of  
Europe have undergone no material changes  
since your last session. The important he •  
gociatious with Spain, which had peen a!ler­  
• nately suspended and resume :, iiect” nrily  
experience a pause, linger the extr: una­  
I r&gt;r and.interesting crisis which distiugishes  
her internal situation.  
. With the Barbary’ powers we continue in  
harmony, with the exception of an unjustifia­  
ble proceeding olthe Dev of Algiers towards  
pur consul to that regciicv its character ck

the Ioways, the Sacs and the Alibumashaie  
delivered up for trial and punishment indi­  
viduals Irom among them-rlves accused of  
• murdering citizens ol the United States.—  
On this side the Mississippi the Creeks are  
.exerting themselves to arrest offenders of  
I the same kind, and the Chott iw» have ma­  
nifested tbetr readiness and desire for ami­  
jCaine and just arrangements respecting de­  
i predations committed by disorderly persons  
1 ot ttieir tribe. And generally, from a c. mvic­  
. tion that \ye consider tiiem as a part of our­  
i selves, and cherish with sincerity their fights  
jahd interests, the attachment of the Indian  
tribes is gaining strength daily, ii extending  
;from the nearer to the more remote, and will  
amply requite us fi&gt;r the justice and friend­  
s’.ij&gt; practised towards them. Husbandry  
jand household manufacture are advancing a  
mong them, more rapidly with the Southern  
than Northern tribes, from circumstances  
of soii and climate, and one of tile f wo great  
divisions of the Cherokee nation have now  
finder consideration to solicit the citizenship  
of the United States, ami to lie identified with  
ns in lav/s and government in such progres­  
sive riianrier as we shall think be&gt;&gt;t.  
  
■ *n consequence of the, appropriations of  
j the last session of Congress for the seeuvitv  
j of • • r se &gt;rt towns and lia b &gt;rs, such  
Works of defence have been erected as seem*  
. ed to l)e called ior by tlie situation of the sc-r  
j vtfral p aces, their relative importance, and  
i l&#x27;|c sr tie* oi expense indicated hy t:ie aim .mt  
lot the appropriation. These works will  
j cl«ir*fly be finished in the course of tlie pre­  
sert season, exceptat New-York and New*  
Orleans, where most was to lie &#x27;one : and  
although a great proportion of the last ap­  
propriation has hefcn expended on the fotaiier  
i I,,ace, vet some further views will be submit­  
j ted to Congress for rendering its secuntv eti­  
; tirely adequate against naval emi. pri/.e. A  
j view r.f what has been do . .* at tlie several p&#x27;i.t­  
11 es, tfe (&gt;t what is pv ijinsed to )&gt;e done, shall hr  
j communicated as soon as the several reports  
are receive |.  
Ot the gun-boats authorised hy the act of!  
l)ecCoilier last, it has been thought neocssij  
i y to Imild only one hiindred and three in flic  
present year. I lies#, witn ilioif before pov­  
sessed, are .uflicienl for the harbors and wa  
ters i,last exposed, and the residue wili re  
cpiiie little time lor their construction when  
it shall |&gt;e deemed necessary.  
, Under the net of the : isr session for rai  
sing an additional military force, so many of­  
ficers were immediately appointed as were  
necessary lor carrying on the uismes-, of re  
cumin*. ^*&gt;d in proportion as it advanced,  
Mil id* have l»evn added. We liavr leas&quot;!  
to believe tlieir success ha’tb-en srtisf actor !  
although such return# b...ve cat yet been u­  
ceivqd as enable.me to present you a »uu  
merit of tlie uuiliucfj engaged.  
I have not thougnt it necessary, in th.  
course of th.* last season to call for a#»v  
nevat detachments of militis or of &#x27;■&gt;! . .  
leers, under the lav.# j&gt;m#ed An* tU.it purpose.  
  
IFor *he rpsu’ij&#x27;; s Ttsnn however, thel; ■will«  
retired p&gt; be in readiness, should,their  
service be wanted. S me small and special  
dotucli reiits have been necessary to muin­

on of our mo them Iron tier which, offeree?  
peculiar facilities tor evasion. But these  
were replaced as si.mii as it could be done by  
bodies of new recruits. B&gt; the aid. of these  
and of the armed vessels called. into, seryhie  
in other t}uarte|&gt;. tin- spirit of dished fence  
*ind abuse, which manifested itself early&#x27;, tf:  
with sensible effect while we were unpre­  
pared to meet it, has been considerably re­  
pressed. , .  
C ntsidering the extraordinary character  
of the times in which we live, our attention  
should unremittingly he fixed on the safety  
of our country. For a people who ire fiec,  
an ‘ who mean to remain so, a well organi­  
zed and armed mili ia is their best seen vi;,  
It is therefore incu&#x27;pbent on us, at every  
meeting, to revise the condition of the mili­  
tia, and to ask ourselves if it is prepared to re­  
pel a powerful enemy at every point of out*  
territories .exposed to invasion? Some of  
the States have paid a laudable attention to  
tliis object; but every degree i t neglect is to  
be found among others. Congress alone ha­  
ving the power to produce an uniform state  
ol preparation in this gre it &lt;&gt;rg m of defence  
—the interests which they so deeply feel in  
their own and their country’s security will  
present this as among the most important ob  
jects of tneir deliberation.  
Under the acts of Marsh 11 and April 23,  
respecting avina. the difficulty ol procu­  
ring them from abroad, during the present  
situation and dispositions of liurone, induced  
us to direct oar whole offbrts to tile means  
of internal supp&#x27;y. T ie public factories  
have therefore been enlarged, additional ma­  
chineries erected, and in propoi&quot;ion as ;i.rtifi  
eers can he* found or formed, tlieir eflect, al­  
rc.‘.t*y iuO&#x27;i&#x27;v vhuii tiwumu, iiidj uc iiijuiruftcu,  
so us to keep pace with the yearly increase  
of the militia. The n.ivmal sums appropri­  
»ted by the latier act have been directed to  
the encouragement of private factories of  
anns, and cantracrs have been entered into  
with individual undertakers to nearly the a­  
m on mot the first year’s appropriation.  
  
j lie suspension of our foreign com nercc,  
p dined bv me injustice of the bel.igerent  
; rv. ers, and tie. consequent losses and sac.ri­  
rices of t ir ctiac&#x27;.is, are subjects of just con­  
cern. The situation into which we have ihus  
beer, forced h..s inipe led us to apply a por­  
tion ol our iridustry and capital, to internal  
manufactures and impioverpeiits. The ex  
(ent of this conversion is daily cncreasing  
and little doubr remains that the establish  
meats formed and forming, will, under die  
auspices of cheaper . materials ami subsist  
• ace, the freed.&gt;u. oflaborfrorii.taxation with  
ns, and oi protecting duties and prohibitions,  
become permanent. The cotnnieico with  
the Indians too, wi hin our own boundaries,  
is nicely to receive abundant i -m from  
the same internal source^ and «!&quot;: secure to

12 o’clock to morrow.  
On motion of Mr. Smilie, the usual rule  
was adopted for furnishing the members  
with newspapers.  
1 he tidily hour of meeting having been

President’s Message.  
WASHINGTON CITY, Nov. 8.  
rhis day at 12 o’clock, the President of the  
United States communicated, by Mr.  
Coles, his Secretary, the following MES­  
SAGE to both houses of Congress.  
lb the Sena te and Home of Rrfirenenta­  
tivet of the United Staten.  
It would have been a source, fellow citi­  
ens. of much gratification, if our last com­  
umications from Europe had enabled me &#x27;  
&gt; inform yon, that the belligerent nations, &#x27;  
those disregard of neutral rights has been  
i destructive to our commerce, had become i  
  
iwakened to the duty and true policy of re*  
roking their unrighteous edicts. That no  
neans might be omitted to produce thissa­  
titary effect, I lost no time in availing my­  
self of the act authorising a suspension, in  
whole or in part, of the several embargo  
laws. Our ministers at London and Paris  
were instructed to explain to the respect­  
ive governments there, our disposition to  
exercise the authority in such manner  
as would withdraw the pretext on which  
the aggressions were originally founded,  
and open the way for a renewal of that  
commercial intercourse which it was alleg­  
ed on all sides had been reluctantly obstruc­  
ted. As each of those governments had  
pledged its readiness to concur in renounc­  
ing a measure which reached its adversa­  
ry through the incontestible rights of neu­  
trals only, and as the measure had been  
assumed by each as a retaliation for an as­  
serted acquiescence in the aggressions of  
the other, it was reasonably expected that  
the occasion would have been seized by  
both for evincing the sincerity of their pro­  
fessions, anil for restoring to the commerce  
of the United States its legitimate freedom.  
The instructions to our ministers with re~  
spect to the different belligprents were ne„  
ccssarily modified with a reference totheir  
different circumstances, and to the condi­  
tion annexed by law to the Executive pow­  
er of suspension requiring a degree of se­  
curity to our commerce which would not  
result from a repeal of the decrees of  
France. Instead of a pledge therefore of a  
suspension of the embargo as to her in case  
of such a repeal, it was presumed that a  
sufficient Inducement might lie found in o­  
ther considerations, and particularly in the  
change produced by a compliance with our  
just demands by one belligerent, and a re­  
fusal by the other, in the relatotis between  
this other and the 1 brited States. To Great  
Hritain, whose power on the ocean is so as­  
cendant, it was deemed not inconsistent  
with that condition, to state explicitly, that  
on her rescinding her orders in relation to  
the United States their trade would be o„  
  
emy, in case of his failure to resrind his de­  
crees also. From France no answer has  
been received, nor any indication that the  
requisite change in her decrees iscontem.  
plated. The favorable reception of the I  
proposition to Great Britain was the less to  
be doubted as her Orders of Council had  
not only been referred for &#x27;heir vindication  
to an acquiescence on the part of the United  
States no longer to be pretended, but as the  
arrangement proposed, whilst it resisted the  
illegal decrees of France, involved moreo­  
ver substantially, the precise advantages i  
professedly aimed at by the British Orders. [  
The arrangement has nevertheless been  
rejected.  
This candid and liberal experiment ha­  
ving thus failed, and no other event having  
occurred on which the suspension of the em­  
bargo by the Executive was authorised, it  
necesssrilv remains in the extent original,  
ly given to it. We have the satisfaction  
however to reflect, that in return for the  
privations imposed by the measure, and  
which our fellow citizens in general have  
borne with patriotism, it has had the im­  
portant effects of saving our mariners, and  
our vast mercantile property, as well as of  
affording time for proeeru&#x27;ing the defen  
sive and provisional measures called for by  
the occasion. It has demonstrated to fo­  
reign nations the moderation and firmness  
which govern our councils, and to our citi­  
zens the nccessi y of uniting in support of  
the laws and the rights of their country,  
and has thus long frustrated those usurp &lt;­  
tions and spoliations which, if resisted in­  
volved war, if submitted to, sacrificed a  
vital principle of our national independ­  
ence  
Under a continuance of the belligerent  
measures, which in defiance »f laws which  
consecrate the rights of r.cuirals, over­  
spread the ocean with danger, it will rest  
with the wisdom of Congress to d. culeoni  
the course best adapted to such a state of  
things ; and bringing with them, as they do,  
from every part of the union, the senti.  
mental of our constituents, my confidence is  
strengthened that in forming this decision,  
they will, with an unerring regard to the  
essential rights and interests of the nation,  
weigh and compare the painful alternatives  
out of which a choice is to be made. Nor  
should 1 do jus&#x27;ice to trie virtues, which on  
other occasions have marked the character  
of our fellow citizens, if f did n «t cherish  
an equal confidence, that the alternative  
chosen, whatever it may be, will be main  
tnined with all the fortitude and patriotism  
which the crisis ought to inspire.  
  
4 iic uocumeius, coni,lining uic corres­  
pondences on the subject of the foreign  
edicts against our commerce, with the in­  
structions given to our Ministers at Lon­  
don and Paris, are now laid before you.  
Thr.communi&#x27; a ions, made to Congress  
at their last session, explained (he pos u c  
io wh:ch the close of th&lt;; discussions rela  
tive to the Bitack by a Brithh ship of war  
on the frigate Ch&#x27;-s.ipeake left a *ubjt£ton  
wli cl» the na ion had mnnifeated »o honor,  
able a sensibih&#x27;y. Kvery view of what  
liad passed authorised a belief th it imme.  
di ite steps would be taken by tlie British  
government for redressing a wrong, which  
the more it was investigated, appeared the  
more clearly to require wha1 had not been  
provided for in the special mission. It is  
found that no steps have been taken for  
the purpose. On the contraty it will be  
seen, in the documents laid before yon, that  
the inadmissible preliminary, which ob.  
»*nifled the adjustment, is still adhered to;  
and moreover that it is now brought into  
connexion with the distinft and irrelative  
case of the orders in conned. The instruc.  
tions which had been g»v«n to our minis,  
ter at London, with a view to facilitate, if  
necessary, the reparation claimed by du­  
ll. States, are included in the documents  
communicated.  
Our relations with ’!&lt;e other powers of  
F.urope have undergone no material chan,  
ges since your last session. The impor.  
lant negociations with Spain, which had  
&gt;een ahernacly suspended and resumed,  
ecessarily experience a pause, under the  
extraordinary a»d interesting crisis which  
listinguishcn her internal situation.  
With the Barbary powers we continu  
n harmony, with the cxcep.ion of an uru  
  
ustifiable proceed&#x27;ng of the Dey of Al­  
giers towards our consul to that regency.  
Its character and circumstances are now  
laid before you, and will enable you to de­  
:ide how far it may either now or hereaf­  
ter call for any measures not within the  
limits of the Executive authority.  
With our Indian neighbors the public  
peace has been steadily maintained. Some  
instances of ind v.dual wrong have as at  
other times tak.n place, but in no wise  
implicating the will of the nation. Be­  
yond the Mississippi the Inways, the Sacs  
and the Alibamas have delivered up for  
trial and punishment individuals from a.  
mong themselves accused of murdering  
citizens of the U S. On this side of the  
Mississippi, the Creeks a e exciting them­  
selves to arrest offenders of the xamek&#x27;mH,  
and the Cho&#x27;/law* hnv* manifested h&#x27;iir  
readiness ar.d desire for nni cable and just  
arrangements res;e&#x27;ltng depredators  
committed by dh irdrriy petsons of iheir  
ribe. Ami generally, from a eoftfeifluMi  
that we constd.-r them as a j an ofm-.  
selves, und cherish with sincerity thdr  
rights and interests, the a-&#x27;achmcnt of the  
Indian tribes is gaining strengih daily, is  
extending from »hc nearer to the more ic­  
mote, and will amply requ&#x27;te us for tiie  
justice and friendship practiced towards  
hem. Husbandly and household inainu  
facture are advancing am mg them, more  
rapidly with the Southern than Northern  
• ribes, from circumstances of soil and cli­  
mate, and one of the two great divisions «.f  
the Cherokee nation have now under con­  
sideration to solicit the citizenship of the  
U S. and to be identified with us in laws  
and government in such progressive man­  
ner as we shall think best.  
In consequence of the appropriations of  
the last session of Congress Tor the seco­  
ril v nf mif ei. . . __i i_t  
  
, - ~ 1-- HIM! IU1IUUI9) sucn  
works ol defence have been ere6\ed as  
seemed to be called for by the situation  
ol the several places, their relative impor.  
Unce, and the scale of expense indica-ed  
by the amount of the appropi iation.—  
These works will chiefly he finished in the  
course of the present season, except at  
New York and New Orleans, wlieie most  
was to be done : and although a great  
proportion ol the last appropriation has  
been expended on the former place, yet  
some further views will be submit ed to  
Congres3 for rendering its security entire*  
ly adequate against naval enterprise. A  
view ol what has been done at the several  
places, andof what is proposed to be done,  
shall be communicated as soon as the sc«  
Veral repor s are received.  
Of the gun-boats authorised by the a&amp;  
of D-cember last, it has been thought ne­  
cessary to build onTy one hundred and  
three in the present year. These, with  
those before possessed, are sufficient for  
the harbors and waters most exposed, and  
the residue will require little time fur  
&#x27;heir construction when it shall be deemed  
necessary.  
Under the a6t of the last session for rai*  
g an additional military foice,so many  
/fficers were immediately appointed as  
were necessary f.,r carrying on the busi­  
ness &lt;&gt;f iccruiiing, and in proportion as it  
tdvanef-d others have been added- We  
nave reason to believe their success has  
&#x27;•ecu sa isfaclory, although such returns  
have not yet been recuv d as enable me  
in present you a statement of the numbers  
engaged.  
1 hrverot thought it necessary, in the  
course ol the last se isoo to call foi any  
general detachments of militia or of vo|.  
unteers, un»ier the taws passed for that  
purpase. For the ensuing season however  
thiy will be required to be in readiness, -  
•h.&#x27;uld their set vice be wanietl. Some  
small and special detachments have been  
necessary to maintain the laws of etn*  
bargo, on that portion of our northern fron«  
ier which offered peculiar facilities for e­  
vasion, but these were re. laced as ^o .n as  
it cmiid be done by bodies of new recruits*  
Uy the aid of these, and of the armed ves­  
sels called into service in other quarers,  
the spoil of disobedience and abuse, which  
man.Tested iis.-lf early, and with sensible  
eff ct while we were unprepared to meet  
it, has been considerably reorenspd.  
  
Considering the extraordinary character  
of ihe times in which we live, our attention  
should unremittingly he fixed on the safe­  
v ol our country. For a people who are  
free, a d who mem to remain so, a well  
organised and armed militia is their best  
security, j. is therefore incumbent on us,  
a&#x27; every meeting, to revise the condition  
of the militia, and to ar&gt;k ourselves if it is  
prep red to repel a powerful enemy at e­  
very p int of our territories exposed to  
ititra-.ion ? Some oft he states have paid a  
laudable attention to this object : but eve­  
ry degree of neglect is o be fount! among  
others. Congress alone having the pow­  
er to produce an uniform state of prep* a*  
lion in this great organ of defence, &lt;he in.  
lerests which they so deeply feel in their  
own and their country’s security will pre­  
^ent this as among the most important ob­  
jects of their tlehbciation.  
Under ihe acts of March 11 and April  
93, respecting arms, the difficulty of pro­  
curing then, Itom abroad during the pre.  
Mt-m situation and dispositions of Europe  
induced us to direct our whole eff irts to  
the means of internal supply. The pub­  
l*c factories have therefore been enlarged,  
additional machineries erec*ed, and in pro.  
portion as artificeis can he found or form­  
ed their effect, already more than doubled,  
may be increased so as to keep puce with  
he yearly increase of the militia. The  
annual sums appropriated by the latter  
«»ci have been d reeled to the encourage­  
ment ot private lactories of arms, and con­  
tracts have been entered into with individ­  
ual undertakers to nearly (he amount of  
.he first year* appropriation*

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

The suspension oT our foreign com- i  
tneree, produced by the injustice of  
the belligerent powers, and the conse­  
quent losses and sacrifices of our citi­  
zens, are subjects of just concern.  
The situation into which we have thus  
been forced has impelled us to apply  
n portion of our industry and capital to  
internal manufactures and improve­  
ments. The extent of this conversion  
is daily increasing and little doubt re­  
mains that the establishments formed  
and forming, will, under the auspices  
of cheaper materials and subsistence,  
the freedom of labor from taxation  
with us, and of protecting duties and  
prohibitions, become permanent. The  
commerce with the Indians too, with­  
in our own boundaries, is likely to re­  
ceive abundant aliment from the same  
internal source, and will secure to  
them peace and the progress of civili­  
zation undisturbed by practices hostile  
to both.  
The accounts of the receipts and  
expenditures during the years ending  
on the thirtieth day of September last,  
being not yet made up, a correct  
statement will hereafter be transmitted  
from the treasury. In the mean time  
it is ascertained that the receipts have  
amounted to near eighteen millions of  
dollars, which with the eight millions  
and an half in the treasury at the be­  
ginning of the year ha\ e enabled U1­  
after meeting the current demands,  
and interest incurred, to pay two mil­  
lions three hundred thousand dollars  
of the principal of our funded deb:,  
and left us in the Treasury on that da  
near fourteen millions of dollars. ().  
these five millions three hundred and  
fifty thousand dollars will benecessa  
to pay what will be due on the first  
  
dav ot January next, which will com­  
plete the reimbursement of the 8 per  
cent, slock. These payments, with  
those made in the six years and an  
half preceding, will have extinguished  
thirtv-three millions live hundred and  
eighty thousand dollars ot the principal  
of the funded debt, being the whole  
which could be paid or purchased  
within the limits of the law and of our  
contracts, and the amount of piincipal  
thu3 discharged will have liberated  
the revenue from about two millions  
of dollars of interest, and added that  
sum annually to the disposable sur­  
plus. The probable accumulation ol  
the surpltisses of revenue bevood what  
ran be applied to the payment of the  
public debt, whenever the freedom and  
safety of our commerce shall be re­  
stored, merits the consideration of  
Congress. Shall it lie unproductive  
in the public vaults ? shall tile revenue  
be reduced ? or shall it not rather be  
appropriated to the improvements of  
roads, canals, rivers,, education, and  
other great foundations of prosperity  
and union under the powers which  
Congress may already p &gt;s .ess, or such  
amendment of the constitution as may  
be approved by the states ? While un­  
certain of the course of things the time  
may be advantageously employed in  
obtaining the powers necessary for a  
system of improvement, should that  
be thought best.  
Availing myself of this, the last oc­  
casion which will occur, of address­  
ing the two Houses of Legislature  
at their meeting, 1 cannot omit the  
expression of my sincere gratitude,  
for the repeated proots of confidence  
manifested to me bv themselves and  
their predecessors since mv call to the  
administration, and the many indul­  
gences experienced at their hmcls.  
The same grateful acknowledgments  
are due to my fell, av-citizens general­  
ly, whose support has been mv great  
encouragement under all embarrass­  
ments, In the transaction of their bu­  
  
sincss I cannot have escaped error.  
It i3 incident to our imperfect nature.  
Hut I may say with truth mv errors  
have b.*en ol the understanding, not of  
intention, and that the advancement of  
their rights and interests has been the  
constant motive for every measure.  
On these considerations I solicit their  
indulgence. Looking Toward with  
anxiety to their future destinies, I trust  
that in their steady character, unsha­  
ken by difficulties, in their love of li­  
berty, obedience to law, and support

IT would have Veen a aouree, fellow*  
citizens, of much gratification, if our  
hat communications from Europe, had en­  
abled me to inform you, that tbe^ bellige­  
rent nations, whose disregard 01 neutral  
rights hak been ao destructive to oar com­  
merce, had become awakened to the du­  
ty and true policy of revoking thc-r unrigh­  
teous edicts. That ao means might be o­  
mitted to produce this salutary effect, 1  
lost no time in availing myself of the act  
authorising s suspension, in whole, or in  
part, of the several embargo laws. Our  
ministers at London and Paris were in­  
structed to explain to the respective go­  
vernments there, our disposition to exer­  
cise the authority in such Atanner as would  
withdraw the pretext on which the ag­  
graaiiona were originally founded, and  
open the way for a renewal of that com­  
mercial fmewmwto which k was al­  
ledfed on akaidas bad been reluctantly ob­  
sfcW*:  
only, and as the i  
__aed by each&#x27; ax a retaliation for  
an asserted acquiescent in the aggressi­  
ons of the other, it was reasonably ex­  
pected that the occasion would hare been ,  
seized bv both for evincing the sincerity  
- • • &#x27; - • v&#x27;t. ^ - • &#x27;  
oftheirpeafearions, arid for restoring to  
the commerce of the United States its le­  
gitimate freedom. The instructions to &lt;W  
ministers with respect to the different bel­  
1 .gents wers necessarily modified with a  
reference to their different circumstances,  
and to the condition annexed byilaw to the  
executive (tower of suspension, requiring  
a degree of security to onr commerce  
which would not result from a repeal at  
the decrees of France.-Instead cf s pledge,  
therefore, for a suspension of the embar­  
go as to her in cast of such a repeal, it  
was presumed that a sufficient inducement  
might be found in other caossderationa,  
and parucularly in the change produced by  
a compliance with our just demands by one  
belligerent, and a refusal by the other;  
in the relations between this other and the  
United States. To G. Britain, xvltoac  
[tower on the ocean is so ascendant, it was  
deemed not inconsistent with that conditi­  
on, to state explicitly, that on her rescind­  
ing hW orders in fetation to fife United

- - 3 Y N s  
President’s Meflage.  
| — S e e R e  
WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, Nov. 8, 1808.  
‘This day, at twelve o’clock, the President of the United  
States communicated in writing, by his Secretary: Mr.  
Cotxs, to both houses of Congress, the following -  
MESSAGE.  
&lt;  
To the Senate and Houfz of Representatives,  
&#x27; OF THE UNITED STATES.  
I T would have been a source, Fellow-Citizens, of much  
gratification, if pur last communications from Earope  
had enabled me to inform you, that the beiligerent na­  
tions, whose disregard of neutral rights has been so destruc­  
tive to our commerce, had become awakened to the duty  
and true policy of revoking their unrighteous edits.” That  
no means might be omitted to produce this salutary effe&amp;,  
1 loft no time in availing myfelf of the a&amp; authorizing a  
suspension, in whole or in part, of the several embargo  
laws. * Our ministers at London and Paris were inftru&amp;ted  
to explain te the respective governments there, our dispo­  
sitions to exercise the authority in such manner as would  
withdraw the pretext on which the aggreflions were orig­  
‘inally founded, and open the way for a renewal of that  
commercial intercourse which it was alledged on all sides,  
had been reluGantly obftrudted. As each of those govern­  
ments had pledged its readiness to concur in renouncing  
a measure which reached its adversary through the incon­  
testable rights of ncutrals only, and as the measure had  
been aflumed by each as a retaliation for an asserted ac­  
quicfcence in the aggreflions of the other, it was reasona­  
bly expected that the occasion would have béen seized by  
both for evincing the sincerity of their profeflions ; aad for  
r:ftoring to the commerce of the United States its legiti­  
inate fieedom. The inftiu&amp;ions to our minilters with re­  
fpe&amp; to the different belligerents were neceflarily modified  
with a reference to their difl:rent circamfiances, and to the  
conditions annexed by law to the executive power of sus­  
pension, requiring a degree of security to our commerce  
which “would not result from a repeal of the decrees of  
France. Inltead of a pledge, therefore, for a suspension  
of the embargo as to her, in case of such a repeal, it was  
presumed that a fufficient indacement might be found in  
other considerations, and particularly in the change pro­  
duced by a compliance with our juit demands by one bel­  
ligerent, and a refufal by the other, in the relations between  
this other and the United States. To Great Britain, whose  
power on the ocean is so ascendant, it was deemed not in­  
consistent with that condition; to state explicitly ; that on  
her rescinding her orders in relation to the United States,  
their trade would be opened with her, and remain thut to  
her enemy, in case of his failure to rescind his decrees al{o.  
From France no answer has been received, nor any indi­  
cation that the requisite change in her decrees is contem­  
plated. The favorable reception of the proposition to  
Great Britain was the less to be doubted, as her orders of  
council bad not only been referred for their vindication to  
an acquicfcence on the part of the United States no longer  
to be pretended, but as the arrangement proposed, whillt  
it resisted the illegal decrees of France, involved moreover,  
substantially, the precise advantages profefledly aimed at  
by the Britith orders. The arrangement has nevertheless  
been rejeéted. -  
This candid and liberal experiment having thus failed,  
and no other event having occurred on which a suspension  
es the embargo by the executive was authorized, it neces­  
sarily remains in the extent originally given to it.  
We have the fatisfa&amp;ion however, to refle&amp;, that in re­  
turn for the privations imposed by the measure, and which  
our fellow-citizens in general have borne with patriotism,  
it has bad the important effeéts of saving our mariners and  
. our vast mercastile property, as weil as of affording time  
for prosecuting the defenfive and provisional measures  
called for by the occasion. It has demonstrated to foreign  
nations the moderation and firmnefs which govern our  
coungils, and to our citizens the neceflity of uniting in sup­  
port of the laws and the rights of their country ; and has  
thus long frufirated those usurpations and spoliations which  
if resisted, involved war, if fubmirtted to, facrificed a vital  
principle of our national independences :  
Under a continuance of the belligerent measures which,  
in defiance of laws which consecrate the rights of neutrals,  
overspread the ocear with danger, it will relt with the wis­  
dom of Congrels to decide on the course best adapted to  
such a Rate of things ; and bringing with them, as-they  
do, from every part of the Union, the sentiments of  
our constituents, my confidence is strengthened that  
in formiog this decision, they will, with an unerring  
regard to the essential rights and interests of the nation,  
weigh and compare the painful alternatives out of which  
® choice is to be made. Nor should Ido jußice to the  
virtues which on other occasions have marked the charac­  
ter of our fellow-citizens, if I did not cherith an equal con­  
fidence that the alternative chosen, whatever it may be,  
will befhaintained with all the fortitude and patriotism  
which the crisis ought to inspire. .  
The documents containing the correspondences on the  
fubjedt of the foreign edicts azainft our commerce, with the  
infirutions given to our ministers at London anrd Paris,  
are now laid before you. ;  
The communications made to congress at their last fef­  
~ fion explained the posture in which the close of the difeuf­  
fions relating to the attack by a Britith ship of war on the  
frigate Chesapeake left a fubje&amp; on which the nation had  
manifelted so honorable a sensibility. Every view of what  
had pafled, authorized a belief that immediate steps would  
be taken by the British government for redrefling a wrong,  
“which the more it was invefligated, appeared the more  
clearly to require what had not been provided for in the  
“special miflion. It is found that no Reps have been taken  
for the purpefe. On the contrary .it will be seen, in the  
documents laid before you, that the inadmissible prelimina­  
vy which obftruéted the adjultment, is still adhered to ;  
aud moreover, that it is now brought into conneéion with  
the diltiné&amp; and irrelative case of the orders in council ——  
The instructions which had been given to our minister at  
London, with a view to facilitate, if necessary, the repara­  
tion claimed by the U, States, are included in the docu­  
_ gments communicated,. St g  
~ &lt;+ Our relatiens with the other powers of Europe bave  
_undergone no material changes since your last fefion.

With our Indian neighbors the public peace has been  
steadily maintained. Some inßances of individual wrong  
have, as at other times, taken place ; but in no wife impli­  
cating the will of the nation. Beyond the Mifliflippi the  
loways, the Sacs and the Alibamas bave delivered up for  
trial and punifbment individuals from among themfeives,  
accused of murdering citizens of the United States. On.  
this fide the Miflilippi the Creeks are exerting themselves,  
to arrelt offenders of the fame kind, and the Cho&amp;taws  
have manifelted their readiness and desire for amicable and  
jult arrangements refpe@ing depredations committed by  
disorderly persons of their tribe ; and generally, from a  
convition that we confider them as a part of ourselves,  
and cherish with sincerity their rights and interests. The  
attachment of the Indian tribes is gaining Rrength daily,  
is extending from the nearer to the more remote, and will  
amply requite us for the justice and friendthip praétifed to­  
wards them. Husbandry and household manufactures are  
advancing more rapidly with the southern than northern  
tribes, from circumstances of {oil and climate : and one of  
the two great divisions of the Cherokee nation, have now  
under consideration to solicit the citizenship of #.c United  
States, and to be identified with us in laws and govern­  
ment, in such progreflive manner as we shall think best.  
In consequence of the appropriations of the last feilion  
of Congress for the security of our seaport towns and har­  
bors, such works of defence have been ereéted as seemed to  
be called for by the situation of the several places, their rela­  
tive importance, and the scale of expence indicated by the  
amount of the appropriation. - These works will chiefly be  
finithed in the course of the present season, except at New-  
York and New-Orleans, where most was to be done ; and  
although a great proportion of the lak appropriation has  
been expended on the former place, yet some further  
views will be submitted to congress for rendering its secu­  
rity entirely adequate againlt naval enterprize. A view  
of what has been done at the several places, and of what  
is proposed to be done, shall be communicated as soon  
as the several reports are received.” -  
Of the gun boats authorifed by the a&amp; of December last,  
it has been thought neteffary to build only one hundred  
and three in the present year, these, with those before pof­  
{efled, are fufficient for the harbors and waters most expof­  
‘ed, and the residue will require little time for their con­  
struction when it shall be deemed necessary.  
Under the a&amp; of the Jaft {eflion for raising an additional  
military force, so manylofficers were immediately appoint­  
ed as were neceflary for carrying on the business of re­  
cruiting, and in propottion as it advanced, others have  
been added. We have reason to believe their success has  
been {atisfactory, although such returns have not vet been  
received, as enable me to present you a tatement of the  
numbers engaged.  
I have not thought it\neceffary in the course of the 12t  
feflion to call for any general detachments of militia or of  
volunteers, under the laws pafled for that purpose, for the  
ensuing season ; however, they will ‘be required to be in  
readiness, should their service be wanted. Some small and  
{pecial detachments have been necefliry to maintain the  
laws of the embargo, on that portion of our northern  
frontier which offered peculiar facilities for evasion—but  
these were replaced as soon as it could be done by bodies  
of new recruits—by the aid of these, and of the armed ves­  
sels called into service in other quarters, the spirit of diso­  
bedience and abuse, which manifelted itfelf early, and with  
sensible effeét while we were unprepared to meet it, has  
been considerably reprefled.  
Considering the extraordinary charaéer of the times in  
which we live, our attention should unremittingly be  
fixed on the fafety of our country—for a people who are  
free, and who mean to remain f{o, a well organifed and  
armed militia is their best security—it is therefore incum­  
bent on us at every meeting, to revise the condition of  
the militia, and to ask ourselves if iy is prepared to repel a  
powerful enemy at every point of our territories exposed  
to invasion ? Some of the states have paid a laudable at.  
tention to this obje@ : but every degree of neglet is to be  
found among others. Congrels alone having the power  
to produce an uniform state of preparation in this’ great  
-organ of defence, the interests which they so deeply feel  
in their own and their country’s security, will present this  
as among the most important objeéts of their deliberation.  
- Under the aé&amp;s of March 11, and April 23, refpe&amp;ing  
arms, the difficulty of procuring them from abroad, dur­  
ing the present situation and dispositions of Europe, indue­  
ed us to dire&amp; our whole efforts to the means of internal  
supply, The public factories have therefore been enlarged,  
additional machineries ereéted, and in proportion as arti­  
ficers can be found or formed, their effeét already more  
than doubled, may be encreafed so as to keep pace with  
the yearly increase of the militia. &#x27;The annual sums appro­  
priated by the latter a&amp;, have been direéted to the encour­  
agement of private faétories of arms ; and contra@s have  
been entered into with individual undertakers to nearly the  
amount of the firt year’s appropriation.  
The suspension of our foreign commerce, produced by  
the®njultice of the belligerent powers, and the consequent  
losses and facrifices of our citizens, are {ubje&amp;@s of just con­  
cern. &#x27;The situation into which we have thus been forced,  
has impelled us to apply a portion of our industry and cap:  
ital to internal manufaétures and improvements. The ex­  
tent of this conversion is daily increasing, and little doubt  
remains that the establishments formed and forming, will,  
under the auspices of cheaper materials and {ubfiftence,  
the freedom of labor from taxation with us, and of pro­  
tecing duties and prohibitions, become permanent. The  
commerce with the Indians too, within our own bounda­  
ries, is likely to receive abundant aliment from the fame  
internal source, and will secure to them peace and the pro­  
gress of civilization, undisturbed by praéices hollile.to both.  
. The accounts of the receipts and expenditures during  
‘the year ending on the 30th day of September last, being  
not yet made up, a corre&amp; @fatement will hereafter be  
tranf{mitted from the treasury ; in the mean time it is as­  
certained that the receipts have amounted to near eighteen  
millions of dollars, which with the eight millions and an  
half in the treasury at the beginning of the year, have en.  
abled us after meeting the current demands and interest  
incurred, to pay two millions three bundred thousand dol­  
lars of the principal of our funded debt, and left us in the  
treasury on that day near fourteen millions of dollars ; of

enced at their hands. The fame grateful  
acknowledgements are due to my fellow  
citizens generally, whose support has been  
my great encouragement under all embar­  
rafflments, In the tranfacion of their bus­

cident to our imperfe@ nature; but 1 may  
fay with truth, my errors have been of the  
understanding, notof intention ; and that  
the advancement of their rights and inter­

meafurc. On these considerations I solicit  
their indulgence— Looking forward with  
anxicty te their future deltinies. I trust  
thatin their steady chara&amp;er, unshaken by  
difficulties in their love of liberty, obedicnce  
to law, and support of the public authori­

Heaven has in store for our beloved coun­

Washington, Nov. 8, 1808. -  
  
-~ This day at noon the following message,  
  
was presented to both houses :  
  
‘To.the Senate and House of Representatives  
¢ ; oA the United States,  
It-would have been a source, fellow citizens, of  
gratification, if ou last communications from  
‘Europe had enabled me to inform you, that the  
belligerent nations, whose di d of neutral  
rights, has been so destructive to cur commerce,  
- had become so awakened to the dury and true po-

fect,] lost notime in availing my self of the actauthor-

verai embargo laws. Oor ministers at Londonand  
at Paris, were instructed to explain, to the respec-  
tive goveruaments there, our disposition to exerci.  
the authority in such manner as would withdraw  
‘the prevext on which the aggressions were origin-  
ally toyaded, and open the way for a renewal of  
‘that commercial in‘ercourse, which it was alledg-

Was reasonably expecred that the occasion would  
have been seized by but, for evincing the sinceri-

with a reference to their different circums.ances,  
and to the condition annexed by law to the execu.

merce of the United States, their trade would be  
opened with her, and remain shut to her enetny, in  
cate of this failure to rescind his decrees also.———  
from France no answer has been received, nor any  
indication that the requisite change in her decrees  
isconternplated. The favorable reception of the  
proposition to Great-Britain was the less to be  
doubted, as her orders of council had not only been  
teférréd for their vindita:ion, to an acquieScente  
on the part of the United States, no longer to be  
pretended. Bur, as the arrangem¢nt proposed,  
whilst it resisted the illegal decrees of France, in-  
volved, moreover, substantially the precise advan-  
tages professediy aimed at by the British orders,  
&quot;The arrangement has, nevertheless, Been rejecied.  
  
This candid and liberal experiment having thus  
failed, and no o:her even: having occurred on which  
a suspension of the embargo by the executive was  
authorized, it mecestari!y remais in the extent .o-  
riginally given toit. We have the satisfaction,  
  
however, to reflect, that in return for the priva- -  
  
tions imposed by the measure, and which our fel-  
low-citizens in general have borne with patriot-  
ism, it has had the imporiant effects of saving cur  
mariners, and our vast mercantile property, as well  
as of affdérding time for prosecuiing the defensive  
and provisional measures called for by the occasion.  
It has den onstrated to Foreign nations the firmness  
which govern our councils, and to ourciizens the  
necessity of uniting in support of the laws aid the  
rights of their country; and has thus long trustra-  
tedthose usurpations and spoliations which, if re-  
sisted, involved war; if submitted to, sacriljiced a  
vital principle of our national independence.  
Under a continuance of the belligerent measures,  
which in defiance of laws which consecrate the  
rights of neutrais, overspread the ocean with dan-  
ger, it will rest with the wisdom of congress te de-  
cide on the course best adapted to such a state of  
things ; and bringing with them, as they do, from  
every part of the union, the sentiments of our ¢on-  
‘stituents; my confidence is strengthefied that in  
  
forming this decision, they&#x27;will, with an unerring |  
  
regard to the essential rights and interests of the  
nation, weigh and compare the painful alternatives  
out of which a choice is to be made.  
I do justice to the virtues which en other occasions  
have marked the character of our fellow-citizens,  
if 1 did not cherish an equal confidence that the al-  
ternative chosen, whatever it may be, will be main-  
tained with all the fortitude and patriotism which  
thé crisis ought to inspire. |  
  
The documents containing the correspondences  
on the subject of the foreign edicts againse our. com-  
merce, with the imstructicns given to our ministers  
at London and Paris, are now laid before you.  
  
The communications made to congress at their  
last session, explained the postute in which the  
close of the discussions relating to the attack by a  
British ship of war on the frigate Chesapeake, left  
a subject on which the nation had manifested so  
honorable a sensibility. Every view of what had  
passed authorized a belief that immediate steps  
wold be taken by the British government for re-  
dressing a wrong, which, the mote it was investi-  
gated, 4 ye the more clearly to require what  
had not been provided for in the special mission.  
It is found that no sieps have been taken for the  
Furpose. On the contrary, it will be seen, in the  
documents lzid before you, that the madnvissible  
preliminary which obstructs the adjustment, is still  
adhered to; and moreover that it is ncw brought  
iv.to connexion with the distinct and irrelative cise  
of the orders in ceuncil. . The ins ructions which  
had been given to our ministers at London, with a  
vew to facilivate, if necessary, the separation  
claimed by the United States, are included in the  
Cocumen’s communicated.  
  
Our relations with the other powers of  
have undergone no material changes since your  
last session, the important negociations with Spain,  
which had been alternately suspended and resumed,  
necessarily experience a jause, under the extraor-  
dinary and interesting crisis which distinguishes  
her internal situation.  
  
With the B.rbary powers we continue in harmo-  
ny, with the exception of an unjustifiable proceed-  
ing of the dey of Algiers towards our consul to  
that ney. Is character art: circumstances are

the Creeks are exerting them-

Choctaws have manifested :heir readiness and de.  
  
sire for amicable and just arrangements, respecting  
depredations committed by disorderiy persons of  
  
their tribe,—And generally from a conviction that  
we consider them as a part of ourselyes, and cher-  
ish with sitfcerity their rights and interests, the at-  
tachment of the Indian tribes is gaining strength  
daily, is extending from the nearer to the more te.  
mote, and will amply requite us for the justice and  
friendship practised towards them ; husbandry and  
household manufacture are advancing among them  
more rapidly with the southern than the northen  
tribes, from circumstances of soil and climate: and  
one of the two great divisions of the Cherokee na-  
tion, have now under consideration, to solicit the  
citizenship of the U. States, and to be identified  
with us in laws and government, in such progres.

&#x27; In-consequence of the appropriations of the last  
session of congress for the security of our sea port  
towns and harbors, such works of defence haye  
been erected as seemed to be called for by the situ-

tance, and thé scale of expeuce indicated by. the  
amount of the appropriation. These works will  
chiefly be finished in the course of the present sea-  
son, except at New-York and New-Orleans, where  
most was to be done; andalthough a great propor-  
tion of the last appropriation has been expended on  
the former place, vet some further views will be  
submitted to congress for rendering its security en-  
tirely adequate against naval enterprize. A vitw

what is proposed to be done, shall be communica-

residue wiil require little time for their consttuction,  
when it shall be deemed necessary. :  
  
Under the act of the last session, for raising an  
additional military force, so many officers were im-  
  
 Mhediately appointéd as were necessary for carry-

have reason to believe their success has been. satis-  
factory, although such re:urns have not yet been  
received, as enable me to present you a statement  
of the numbers engaged.  
  
I have not thought it necessary, in the course cf  
the last session, to call for any gereral detachments  
of militia, or of volunteers under the laws passed  
tor that purpose; for the ensuing season, howev-  
er, they will be required to be in readiness, should  
their service be wanted. Some smail and special  
detachments have been necessary to main:ain the  
laws of the embargo, on that portion of our nor-

evasion—but thése were rep!aced as soon as itcould

these, and of the armed vessels called into service  
in other quarters, the spirit ot disobedience ard 3-

and who mean to remain so, a well organized  
and armed miiivia is their best security—t

to be found among others. Congress alone  
having the power to produce an: uniform  
state of preparation in this great organ of  
defence, the interests which they so deeply  
feel in their own and their country’s secu-  
rity, will present titis as among the most  
important objects of their deliberation.  
  
Under the acts of March 11, and April  
23, respecting arms, the difficulty of. pro-  
curing them from abroad during the pres-  
eit situation and dispositions of Europe, in-  
duced us to direct our whole efforts to the  
means of internal supply ; the public facto-  
ries have therefore been enlarged, addition-  
al machineries erected, and in proportion  
as artificers can bé found or formed, their  
effect, already more than doubled, may be  
encreased so as to keep pace with the year-  
ly increase of the militia. The annual  
sums appropriated by the latter act, have  
been directed to the encouragement of pri-  
vate factories of arms; and contracts have  
been entered into with individual underta-  
kers, to nearly the amount of the first year’s  
appropriation. su  
  
‘The suspension of our foreign commerte  
produced by the injustice of the belligerent  
powers, and the consequent losses and sac-  
rifices of our citizens, are subjects of just  
concern. The situation into which we  
have thus been forced, has impelled us to  
apply a portion of our industry and capital  
to internal manufactures.and improvements.  
The extent of this conversion is daily in-  
creasing, and little doubt remains that the  
establishments formed and forming, will,  
under the auspices of cheaper materials  
and subsistence, the freedom of labor from  
  
taxation with us, and of protecting duties :  
  
and prohibitions, become permanent. The  
commerce with the Indians too, within our  
own boundarics, is likely to receive abun-  
dant aliment from the same internal source,  
and will secure to them peace and the prog-  
_ress of civilization, undisturbed by practices  
hostile toboth.:).  
  
The accout’s of the receipts and expen-  
ditures during the year ending on the 30th  
day of September Jast, being not yet made  
up, a correct statement will hereafter be  
transgnitted from the treasury. In the  
mean time, it is ascertained, that the re-  
ceipts have amounted to near ciehteen mil-  
lions of dollars, which. with the eizht mil-  
lions and an half.in the treasury at the be-  
ginning of the year, have enabled us, -af-  
ter mecting the current demands and inter-  
est Incurred, to pay two millions three  
hundred theusand. dollars of the principal  
  
of our funded debt, and Jeft usin the trea- -  
  
sury on that day, near fourteen millions of  
collars ; of these, five millions three hun-  
dred and fifty thousand dollars, will be ne-  
cessary to pay what will be due on the Ist  
day of Jan. next, which will complete the  
rehybursement of the civht per cent. stock;  
these payments, with those made in the  
six ycars anda half preceding, will have  
extinguished thirty-three millions, fire  
hundred and eighty thousand dollars of the  
principal of the funded debt, beine the  
whole which could he paid or purchased  
Within the limits of the law end of our con-

from about two millions of dollars of inter-

of the surplusses of revenue, beyond what  
can be applied to the payment of the pub-  
lic debt, whenever the freedom and safety  
of our commerce shall be restored, merits  
the consideration of Congress. Shall it be

be appropriated to the improvements of

grateful acknowledgments are due to my

IT would have been a source,  
fcUow citizens, of mu h gratifica

from Europe had enabled me to  
inform you, that the bclligcrcm  
nations, whose disregard of neu

revoking their unrighteous edicts.  
That no means might be omitted  
to produce this salutary effect, I  
bst no time in availing mself o;  
the act authorising a suspensi m,  
in whole or in part of the several  
embargo laws. Oar miniters at  
London and Paris were instructed  
to explain to the respective tp.  
vcrnmtnts there, our disposition  
to exrrcise the authority in such  
manner as would withd aw the  
pretext on which the agg essioni  
were origiuaily founded, and oprn  
the wavtoTa renewal of that com

ilUgcd on all sidfs had been r -  
lucunily Obstructed, As each o!

r?a;&#x27;.nrss to concur in renouncing  
1 .  
a measure wntcn reaencu its au  
ersary through the incontcstiulr  
lights of neutral only, and as th  
measure h d been assumed b  
eich a&amp; a retaliation for an asserted  
acquiescence in the aggressions of  
the other&#x27;, it was reasonably ex  
pcitcd that the occasion woulu  
Lave been seized by both for e  
incing the sincerity of their pro  
fcssioVs, and for restoring to the  
commerce of the United States its  
legiunvite freedom. Thr instruc­

P&amp;r icularly in the change produ  
eJ b a compliance with bur jus:

her orders in relation t3 the Uni­

Under a continuance ot the bv-

bringing with them, as they do,  
ium every part ot the union, the

Congress at their last ?ision, ex­  
plained the posture in which the  
close of the discussions relative to  
the attack by a British 6hip of war  
n the frigate Chesapeake, left a  
subject on which; the nation had  
manifested so honorable a sensibi­  
lity. Every view of what had  
passed authorised a belief that im­  
I -nediate steps would&quot; be taken b)  
the British government tor re­  
dressing a wrohgj which, the more  
it was investigated, appeared thi  
nore clear y to require what had

mission. It is found that no steps  
l ive been taken for the purpose­  
On the contrary it will be seen, in  
the documents laid before you, that  
tne iuadmissable preliminary,  
which bstructed the adjustment,  
is still adhered to ; and moreover  
that is now brought intj connec

-.&#x27;With our Indian neighbors; the  
  
pdblic peace has &#x27;been steadil)  
maintained. Some instances ol  
imlividu d wrong have, as at other  
times, taken nlace. but in no wise  
implicating the will of the nation.  
Beyond the Mississippi the.lo  
ways, the Sacs and the AHbamas,  
have delivered up for tritl and pu  
nishnient individuals from among  
themselves accused of murdering  
citizsns of the United States  
On this side the Mississippi the  
Creeks are exerting themsevts to  
arrest offenders of the same kind.  
and the Choctaw.s have manifested  
their readiness nd desire for am  
icable and just arrangements re3  
pecting depredatioo3 committed  
y disorderly persons of their  
tribe. And generally, from a con  
viction that we consider them as a  
part of ourselves, and cherish with  
sincerity their rights and interests.  
the attachment of the Indian tribes  
isgaining strength daily, &#x27;n extend  
ing from the nearer to the more  
remote, and will amply requite us  
for the justice and friendship prac  
ticed towards them. Husbandry  
and household manufacture are  
advancing among them, more ra  
pidly with the Southern than  
Northern tribe3,from circumstan­  
ces of soil and climate, and one ol  
the two great divisions o I theChe  
rokee nation have now under coi:.  
sideratinn to solicit the citizen  
ship of the United &#x27;States, a.id t ;  
be identified with us in laws and  
government in such progressive  
manner as we shall think best.  
In consequence of the appropri  
ations of the last session of Con­  
gress lor the security&#x27;of ourstaport  
town and harbors, such works of  
d-fence have been erected ns s?em.  
ed to be called for by the situation  
of the several places, their relative  
importance, and the scale of ex  
pence indicated by the amount of  
the appropriation. 1 hese works  
wiil chiefly be finisied in the course  
of the present season, except at  
New-Yjrkct New-Orleans, whert­  
most was t be done; and altho1  
u great proportion of the l.tst ap  
propriation has been expended on  
the former place, yet some  
views will be submitted to Con  
gress for rendering its security  
tirely adequate against naval enter-  
pnze,. A view ot what hasbeen  
done at the several places, a(nd of  
what is proposed to be done, shall  
be communicated as sc6n as the  
several reports are received.  
Ol the gun-boats authorised bv  
the act of December last, it his  
!jeen thought nepfcssary to build  
only one hundred and three in the  
present year. These, with those  
)elore possessed, are sufficient tor  
rhe harborSSc ivaters most expos  
ed &amp; the residue will require li;tle  
time fortneir construction when it  
shall b&amp;xleemecl necessary.  
Under the act of the fast session  
for raising au additional militar)  
force, s many officers were imme­  
diately appointed as were necessa.  
A for carrying on he business of  
recruiting, and in proportion as it  
advanced others have been added.  
WchaVe reason to believe their  
success has been satisfactory, altho&#x27;  
such returns have not been yet re­  
ceived as enabled me to present  
vou a statement of the numbers en­  
giged. . .  
I have not thought it necessary,  
in the course of the last season, to  
call for any general detachments of  
militia or of volunteers, under the !  
!aws p issed for that purpose For  
the easing Season, however, they  
will be required to be in readiness  
should their service be wanted.  
Some small &amp; spcial detachments  
have been necessary to maintain  
the laws of Embargo, on that  
-ortion of our northern frontier  
vhich offered peculiar facilities for  
evasion. But these were replac  
ed as sopn&#x27;as it could be done bv

our territories exposed to inva

paid a laudable attention to this  
object ; but every degree of pe-  
glect is to he found, among others.  
Congress alone having the power  
to prouuee an uniform state ot pre­  
naration in &#x27;this great organ of de­  
fence : the interests which thev so  
deeply feel-in their own and their  
country&#x27;s security will present this  
as among the most important ob­  
jects of their deliberation;  
Under the acts of March 11th,  
and Aoril i23d, respecting arms,  
the difficulty of procuring them  
from abroad during the present si  
tuition and dispositions of Europe,  
induced us to direct our whole

It Vould liave&#x27;becn a source, ft How-citizens, of  
  
much gratification, tf our last conimunicauons from  
  
r.urope had ena!)led me to inform you, that the br  
ligerent nations, whose disregard of neutral rights  
  
has been so destmctire to our commerce, had be­  
come awakened to the duty arid true poiicy of revo  
  
king their unrighteous edicts.&#x27;, tTbat no means  
  
nuirht be omitted to produce this salutary effect, I  
  
lost no time in Tailin!j myself of the act authorising  
  
uspcmion,in wliale or in part, of the several env  
baivo laws. - Our. minister ta Ixmlon and Farls  
  
were kistructedto explain to the respective gotvm  
roenta there, our disposition to exercise the author!  
  
ty in ucb ma!UK-r a would niihdraw the pretext  
  
on which the aggressions were originally founded,  
  
and open the way Kr a renewal of that commercial  
  
intercourse which it&#x27; was alledged on all sides had  
  
been reluctantly obstructed. As each of those gov  
ernments lad pledged iu rcauiics to concur in re  
  
nounging a measure which readied its adverwy  
  
Uiivugh the incontestable ntruts ot neutrals inn  
  
ly, and as tlie; measure had been assumed by each  
as a retuTlation for an asserted acquiescence in tlie  
  
aggressions of the other, it was reasonably expected  
that tlie occasion would have lcen seiied by both for  
evincing the rinccrity of their professions, and for  
  
restorhig .to the commerce of the United Slates its  
legitimate freedom, v The instructions to our mi­  
nisters with respect to the different belligerents were  
  
&#x27;.leccssoruy mouihed with a reference to thcur pllier.  
ent circumstances, and to the condition annexed by  
  
law to the Execuuve power of suspension rcquumj  
a dcirree of security to Our commerce which would  
  
not result from a repeal of (he decrees of France--  
  
l:utead. 01 a pledge thereiore ot a suspension ot the  
  
nbargo as to her m case of such repeti U was pre  
  
sumed that a aufficient inducement might be found  
in other considerations, and particularly in the change  
  
produced by a compliance w Uh our just demands by  
  
one belligerent, and a refusal by tlie other, in&#x27; the  
  
relations between this other and the United otatcs.  
  
To Great-Britain, whose power on the ocean is so  
  
ascendant,, it was deemed not inconsistent with that  
condition, to &#x27;state expbeitly, that on her rescinding  
  
her Uruers in relation, to. the United States their  
  
trade would be opened with her, and remain shut to  
  
her enejoy, m case, of hia failure to rescmd his de­  
decrccs also. . From France; no answer has been  
received, nor any indicution that the requisite change  
  
ul her decrees ii, contemplated.: . 1 be favourable re  
  
ccpuon ot Uia proposition to Grest Untain was the  
  
less to be doubted as her Orders of Cotincil had not  
only been referred fof their vindication to an acqui­  
escence&#x27; on; the part of the Vhited States no longer  
to be pretended, but as the arrangement proposed,  
whilst it? resisted the illegal decrees of France, in;  
volved moreover substantuuly, tlie precise advanta­  
ges professedly einied at by the British Orders  
i&#x27;he arrangement lias nevertheless been rejected. V  
vfTyA&#x27; candid an4; liberal experiment having thus  
failed, and iio.ethcr event liaving occurred on which  
a suspciiaoh &#x27;of the embargo by the Executive &quot;was  
kuthbtised, it nccessariljf remains iu the extent ori­  
ginally jgivcntO it. !&#x27; We liave thi; satisfaction; how­  
ever to reflect that in return for the privations imr  
posed by the measure, and which bur fellow-citizens  
in generai have borne-with patriotism it has. had! the

IT would have been a tourer, fellow­  
citizens, of much gratification, if our lall  
communications from Furope hat! enabled  
fie to inform you, that the belligerent \* 1­  
tiouH, wuofc difregard to neutral rights  
hu been fo definitive to our commerce,  
had become awakened to the duty an l  
true policy of revoking their unrighteous  
ediifts. That no means might be omitted  
to produce this falutary effect, I loft no  
time m availing myfelf of the a&lt;5l author­  
izing a fufpenfion, in whole or in part, of  
the feverai embargo laws. Our mmiftcr*  
at London and at Paris were inftrti&amp;ed to  
explain to the rtfpeftive governments  
there, our difpofition to cxercife the au­  
thority in fueh manner as would with­  
draw the pretext ou which the aggrefli &gt;na  
were originally founded, 5c open the way  
for a renewal of that commercial intcr­  
eourfe which it was alledged en all Tides  
had been reluctantly ubftru&amp;ed. As each  
of thole governments had pledged its rta­  
dinefs to concur in renouncing a meal&#x27;ure  
which reached its adverfary through the  
inconiefttble rights of neutrals only, and  
  
as the mealure had been aflumtd by each  
as a retaliation for an aflcited acquiescence  
in the aggieflions of the other, it was ren­  
fenably expired that the occafion would  
have been ieixed by both for evincing the  
fincerity of their proftflions, and for rc­  
ftoring to the commerce of the United  
States its legitimate freedom. The in­  
ftrutfions to our aiioifters with reljpc&lt;5t to  
the different belligerents were nectfiariiy  
modified with a reference to their different  
circumftances, &amp; to the condition annexed  
by law to the Executive powerot futpenfion  
rtquirinq a degree of iecurity to our com­  
merce which would not refult from a re­  
ped of the deertes of France. Inftead  
of a pledge therefore ot a fufpenfion of  
the embargo as to her in cafe of fucb re­  
peal, it was prel&#x27;umed that a fuffieient in­  
ducement might be found in other contki­  
eration#, and particularly iu the change  
produced by a compliance with our ju:t  
demands by one belligerent, and a leiolal  
by the other, in the relations between this  
other and the United States. To Great  
Britain, whole power on the ocean is io  
attendant, it was deemed not inconfiftcnt  
with that condition, to Hate explicitly,  
that on her rescinding her orders in rcla*  
lion to the United States their hade would  
lie opened with htr, and remain fhui to  
her cnerm in cafe ot his failure to refeind  
hi &gt; deertes alft&gt;. Fronj France no anfwcr  
  
na* Dcen rtCfiveu, not any indication that  
the requilitz change in tier choices is con­  
templated. The favorable reception of  
the proportion to Great fitit;;n was the  
JtTi to be doubted as her orders of council  
h id not only been reftrred for their vtuoi  
cation to ail acquicfcence on the part of  
the United States no longer to be pretend*  
ed, but as the arrangement propofed,  
whilll it refilled the illegal decrees ot  
France, involved moreover fubilautially,  
the prccile advantages profcficdly aimed  
at by the Bt itiHi orders. T he arrangement  
has nevtrtheitfs been rejected.  
This candid and libera! experiment having  
thus tailed, and no other event having occured

F.xecutive war authorised, it uecelTarily re­

We have the fatufactioa, howevar, to reflect  
that in return for the privations imposed by  
the n.eafure, ami which our fellow citizen*  
in general have borne with patriotifm, it h:u

ace, yet leme further views will be  
ftibmirttd to Cougrefs tor rendering its iecuri­  
ty entirely adequate again!! naval enterprize.  
A view ot what lias been done at the leveral  
p ace*, and t t what u propofed to be done,  
ihait be communicated as loou mr tlie feveral  
reports are received.  
Of the gun-boats authorized by the adt of  
December l&lt;dt, it has been thought ncccf­  
ary to build only cue hundred and three  
i iu the prelent ytv\ Theft, wiih thole before  
po defied, are lucfhient lor the harbours and  
wafers mod expofed and the reftdje will re­  
i quire little time for their conftructiori wheu  
it dull be deemed necefiary.  
Uuder the alt of the trait leftinn for raifmg  
an additional military force, fo many officers  
were immediately appointed as were necelfa­  
ry for carrying on the buliuefs of recruiting,  
aud in proportion as it advauced,others have  
been added. We have reafon to believe their  
fucceis has beed falbfaltory, although tuch  
teiurns have not yet been received as enable  
me to prelent you a flaiemeut of the num­  
bers engaged.  
J have not thongbt it necefTuy, in the  
courte ot the lall lea ion to call for any  
general detachment of militia or of volun­  
teers, urulei the laws pafled foi that pur­  
pole. f^r the enluing feafon however  
they will be rtqtiiicd to be in icadind* ,  
iliould their feivicc be v anted. Some  
fmail and fpecial detachment a have been  
; necclbiry to maintain the laws of embargo,  
J on that portion of our northern frontier  
which oflctcil pecufi.ii facilities for rvafion.  
lint little were replaced as loon as it could  
i be done by bodies of new recruits. By the  
, aid ofthcie, and of the armed vtlfels cal­  
. icd into fei vicc in other quarters, the fpir­  
it uf drtbbcxiknce and abide which mar.i­  
, lilted itfclf early, and with llnlihlc effect  
while wc were unprepared to meet it, has  
been cunliderably irpreflld.  
i  
  
ConGite’-mg the extraordinary cl.arader  
of the times in which we live, our atten­  
tion fhould unremittingly It fixed on the  
fafety of our country. Fut a people who  
ate free, and who mean to remain f &gt;, a  
well organHcd and armed militia is their  
I btft fecurity. It is therefore incumbent  
on us, at every meeting, to revife the con*  
d it ion of the militia, and to afie ourfelves  
if it is prepared to re- &lt;Aa powerful enemy  
, at every point v&gt;f our territories expofed  
to in va ft on ? Some of the States have  
paid a laudable attention to this objed :  
but every degree rtf oegWf is to be found  
among others. Congref# alone having the  
power to i&gt;roduce an uniform ftate of prep­  
aration in this great organ of defence ; the  
interelts which they fodeeply feel in their  
own and their country’s ftrtuity will pie­  
fent this as among the moft important ob­  
jed&quot; of their deliberation.  
Under the ads of March u, and April  
tj, refpeding arms, the difficulty of pro­  
curing them fom abroad during the pre­  
fent fituation and difpofitions of Europe,  
induced us to dired our whole efforts to  
the means of internal fupply. The pub­  
lic fadories have therefore been enlarged,  
additional machineriesereded, and in pro­  
portion as artificers can be found or form­  
ed, their i ffed, already more than doub­  
led, may be increafcd, foas to keep pace  
with the yearly inertafe of the militia.—  
The annual fumg appropriated by the lat­  
ter ad have been duxded to the encour­  
agement of private fadories of arms, and  
contrads have been entered into with in­  
dividual undertaker? to nearly the amount  
of the firft year ’s appropriation.  
The l&#x27;ufpenfion of our foreign com­  
merce produced by the injulbce of the  
belligerent powers, and the confequent  
lofles and fact dices of our citizen^, are lub­  
jeds of juft concern. The fituation into |  
which we have thus been forced has impel- ‘  
led us to apply a portion of our indutlry  
  
ami capital to internal mamiLcturcs and  
improvements. The extent of this con­  
vertion is daily increafing, and little doubt  
remains that the eftabhlbments formed Sc  
foiming,will, nuder the aufpices ot cheap­  
er materials and lubiiftcr.ce, the freedom  
of labor from taxation with us, md of pro*  
| testing dutits and prohibitions, become  
permanent. The commerce with the In­  
| duns too, within our own boundaries, is  
likely to receive abundant aliment trom  
the lame internal fource, and will fee ure j  
to them peace and tile progref* of civiliza­  
tion undidur bed by practices holtikto both. I  
The accounts of the receipts and expen­  
ditures uuring the year ending on the ,  
thirtieth day of September latt, being not  
yet made up, a correct ftatement will  
hereafter be tianfmitted from the tieatu­  
ry. Jri the mean time it is a let mined  
that the receipts have amounted to near  
1 tighten millions of dollats, which with the  
eight millions and an half in tne trtafury  
at the beginning of the year, have enabled j  
us after meeting the current demands, and  
interett incurred, to pay two millions  
three hundred thoufand dollars of the  
principal ot our funded debt, and left us in  
j the trcaiury on that day near fourteen  
millions ot dollars. Of thefe, five mil- &#x27;  
lions three hundred and fifty thoufand  
dollars will be neccflury to pay w hat will be  
due on the firli day of Jan. next, which will  
complete the rcimburiement of the eight  
* per cent, flock. 1&#x27;licfc payments, with  
| thofc made in the fix years and an half  
  
prcccuing, win nave CAiuigeo,ucu iuuiy­  
threc millions five hundred and eighty  
thoufand dollars of the principal of the  
funded debt, being the whole which could  
be paid or purchafed within the limits of j  
the law 2nd of our contracts, and the a­  
mountof prtncrp.d thus discharged will  
have liberated the revenue irom about two  
millionsof dollars of ititereft, and added  
that fum annually to the difpofable fur­  
plus. The probable accumulation of the  
lurpltilTeftof icvcnuc beyond what can be*  
applied to the payment of the public debt,  
whenever the freedom and fatety of our  
commerce lhall be reft or ed, merits the  
conlideration of Congrels. Shall it lie  
unproductive in the public vaults i Shall  
the revenue be reduced ! or lhall it not  
rather be* appropriated to the improve­  
ments of roaus, canals, rivers, education,  
and other great foundations of prol&#x27;perity  
and union, under the powers which Con­  
grefs may already poilefs, or luch amend­  
ment of the conftitution as may be approv­  
ed by the dates i While uncertain of the  
courfe of things the time may be advanta­  
geoufly employed iu obtaining the powers  
tieceflary tor a lyltem of impiovcmuit,  
Ibould that be thought belt.  
Availing myltlf of this, the laft occafion  
which will occur of addrefting the two  
lioufes of Lcgdlaturc at their meeting,  
I cannot omit the expreliion ot my lincere  
gratitude, for the repeated proofs of con­  
ridcnce manifetted to me, oy thcmfclves  
and their predectilors lince my call to the  
adminiftratiou,and the many md dgencits  
experienced at their hands. &#x27;1 he fame  
grateful acknowledgements are due to my  
ftllovv-cilizens generally, whole lupport  
lias been my guat encouragement under  
all embarrallments. In the tranfuctiou of  
their bulinets 1 cannot have tfeaped error.  
| li is incident to our impelled nature.—  
But I may fry with uuttt my errors have  
been of the inulerftauding, not of iuteii •  
lion, and that the advancement ol their  
rights and iutmfts has been the conftant  
motive for every metfure. On thcle ccn­  
fidcrations I lolicit their indulgence.—  
Looking forward with anxiety to then iu­  
  
ture dcftinies, I truft ?baf in their ftcady  
character, unftnken by difficulties, in their  
love of liberty, obedience to law, and fup­  
port of the public authorities, I fee a fun  
guarantee of the permanence of otir re­  
public : and refiling from the charge of  
their r»ft&#x27;iirs,I canv with me the conf &gt;latnn  
of a fir m ptrfuafion that Heaven has in

Awerica.—Message of the President of the  
United States pyro sate and House of

It would have been a source,

munications from Europe had enabled me  
to inform you, that the belligerent nations,  
whose disregard of neutral right has been so  
destructive to our commerce, had become  
awakened to the duty and the policy of re-  
voking their unrighteous edicts That no  
means might be omitted to produce this sa-  
lutary effect, I lost no time in availing my-  
self of the act authorising. a suspension in  
whole, or in part of the several embargo  
laws. Our ministers at London and Paris  
were instructed toexplain to the respective  
governments there, our disposition to exer-  
cise the authority in such manner as would  
withdraw the pretext on which the aggres-  
sions were originally founded, and open  
the way for.a renewal of that commercial  
intercourse, which it was alledged, on all  
sides, had been reluctantly obstructed. As  
each of these governments had pledged its  
readiness to concur in renouncing a measure,  
which reached its adversary through the in-  
contestible rights of neutrals only, and as the  
measure had been assumed by each as a re-  
taliation for an asserted acquiescence in the  
aggressions of the other, it was reasonably  
expected that the occasion would have been  
seized by both, for evincing the sincerity of  
their professions, and for restoring to the  
United States its legitimate freedom. ‘The  
instructions to our ministers, with respect to  
the different belligerents, were necessarily  
modified with a reference to their different  
circumstances, and to the condition annex-  
ed by law tothe executive power of suspen-  
sion, requiring a degree of security to our  
commerce, which would not result from a  
repeal of the decreesof France. Instead of  
a pledge, therefore, for a suspension of the  
embargo as to her, in case of such a repeal,  
it was presumed that a sufficient inducement  
might be found in other considerations, and  
particularly in the change produced by a  
compliance wish our just demands, by one  
belligerent, and a refusal by the other, in  
the relations between this other and the  
United States.  
power on the ocean is so ascendant, it was  
deemed not inconsistent with that condition,  
to state, explicitly, that on her rescinding  
her orders in relation to the commerce of the  
Unied States, their trade weuld be opened  
with her,’ and remain shut to her enemy, in  
case of his failure to rescind his decress also.  
From Franceno answer has been received,  
nor any indication that therequisite change in  
her decrees is contemplated, The favoura-  
ble reception of the proposition to Great  
Britain was the less to be doubted, as her  
orders of council had not only been referred  
for their vindication to an acquiescence on

the part of the United States, no longer to  
be pretended ; but as the arrangement pro-  
posed, whilst it resisted the illegal decreés  
of France, involved, moreover, substantially  
the precise advantage’ professedly aimed  
at by the British orders. The arrange-  
ment has, nevertheless, been rejected.  
This candid and liberal experiment having  
thus failed, and no other event having occur-  
red on which a suspension of the embargo by  
the executive was authorised, it necessarily  
remains in the extent originally given to it.  
We have the satisfaction, however, to re-  
flect, that in return for the privations 1m-  
posed by the measure, and which our fellow-  
citizens, in general, have borne with pa-  
triotism, it has had the important effects of sav-  
ing our mariners, and our vast mercantile  
property, as well as of affording time for  
prosecuting the defensive and provisional  
measures called for by the occasion. It has  
demonstrated to foreign nations the modera-  
tion and firmness which govern our councils,  
and to our citizens the necessity of uniting  
in support of the laws and the rights of their  
country; and has thus long frustrated those  
usurpations and spoliations which, if resist-  
ed, involved war; if submitted to, sacri-  
ficed a vital principle of our national inde-  
pendence.—Under a continuance of the bel-  
ligerent measures, which, in defiance of  
laws which consecrate the rights of neutrals,  
overspread the ocean with danger, it will  
rest with the wisdom of Congress to decide  
on the course best adapted to such a state of  
things ; and bringing with them, as they do,  
from every part of the Union, the senti-  
ments of our constituents, my confidence is  
strengthened that in forming this decision,  
they will, with an unerring regard to the es-  
sential rights and interests of the nation,  
weigh and compare the painful alternatives  
out of which a choice is to be made. Nor  
should I do justice to the virtues which on  
other occasions have marked the character of  
our fellow-citizens, if I did not cherish an  
equal confidence that the alternative chosen,  
whatever it may be, will be maintained  
with all the fortitude and patriotism which  
the crisis ought to inspire. The docu-  
ments containing the correspondences on  
  
the subject of the foreign edicts against our  
  
commerce, with the instructions given to  
  
our ministers at London and Paris, are now  
  
laid before you.—The communication made  
  
to Congress at their last session explained  
  
the posture in which the close of the discus-  
  
sions relating to the attack by a British ship  
  
of waron the frigate Chesapeake, left a sub-  
  
ject on which the nation had manifested so  
  
honourable a’sensibility. Every view of what  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
had passed authorised a belief that immediate  
steps would be taken by the British govern-  
ment for redressing a wrong, which, the  
more it was investigated, appeared the more  
clearly to require what had not been provid-  
ed for inthe special mission. It is found  
that no steps have becu taken for the pur-  
pose. On the contrary, it will be seen in  
the documents laid before you, that the in-  
admissible preliminary which obstructs the  
adjustment is still adhered to ; and, more-  
over, that it is mow brought into connexion  
with the distinct and irrelative case of the  
orders in council., The instructions which  
had been given to our ministers at London,  
with a view to facilitate, if necessary, the  
reparation claimed by the United States, are  
included in the documents communicated.—  
Our relations with the other powers of Eu-  
trope have undergone no material changes  
since your last session. ‘The important ne-  
gociations with Spain, which had been alter-  
nately suspended and resumed, necessarily  
experience a pause, under the extraordinary  
and interesting crisis which distinguishes her  
internal situation. — With the Barbary powers  
we continue in harmeny, with the exception  
of an unjustifiable proceeding of the Dey of  
Algiers towards our consul to that regency.  
Its character and circumstances are now laid  
before you, and will enable you to decide  
how far it may, either now or hereafter,  
call for any measures not within the limits  
of the executive authority.—With our In-  
dian neighbours the public peace has been  
steadily maintained. Some instances of in-  
dividual wrong have, as at other times, taken  
place, but in no wise implicating the will of  
the nation. Beyond the Mississippi, the  
foways, the Saca, and the Alibamas, have  
delivered ap, for trial and punishment, in-  
dividuals from among themselves accused  
  
of murdering citizens of the United States, .  
  
on this side the Mississippi : the Creeks are  
exerting themselves to arest offenders of the  
same kind, and the Choetaws have manifest-  
ej their readiness and desire for amicable and  
just arrangements, respecting depredations  
committed by disorderly persons of their  
tribe. And generally from a conviction that  
we consider them as a part of ourselves, and  
cherish with sincerity their rights and in-  
terests, the attachment of the Indian tribes  
is gaining strength daily, is extending from  
  
the nearer to the more remote, and will am-.

them more rapidly with the southern than  
  
the northern tribes, fiom circumstances of  
  
soil and climate: and one of the two great  
divisions of the Cherokee nation have now  
under consideration, to solicit the citizen-  
ship of the United States, and to be iden-  
tified with usin laws and government, in such  
progressive manner as we shail think best.-—  
In cousequence of the appropriations of the  
last session of Congress for the security of  
our sea-port towns aud harbours, such  
works of defence have been erected as seem-  
ed to be ealled for by the situation of the  
several places, their relative importance,  
and the scale of expence indicated by the  
amount of the appropriation. These works  
will chiefly be finshed in the course of the  
present season, except at New York and  
New Orleans, where most was to be done ;  
and although a great proportion of the last  
appropriation has been expended on the  
former place, yet some further views wil!  
be submitted to Cangress for rendering its  
security entirely adequate against naval en-  
terprize. A view of what has been done at  
several places, and of what is proposed to  
be done, shall be communicated as soon as  
the several reports are received.—Of the  
gun boats authorized by the act of December  
last, it has been thought necessary to build  
only 103 in the present year; these, with  
those before possessed, are sufficient for  
the harbours and waters most exposed, and  
the residue will require little time for their  
construction, when it shall be deemed ne-  
cessary.—Under the act of the last session,  
for raising an additional military force, so  
many officers weve immediately appointed  
as were necessary forcarrying on the dusiuess  
of recruiting ; and in proportion as it advanc-  
ed, others have been added, We have reason  
to believe their success has been satisfactory,  
although such returns have not been received,  
as eaable meto present youa statement of  
the numbers engaged.—I have not thought  
it necessary, in the course of the last sea-  
son, to call for any general detachments of  
militia, or of volunteers, under the laws  
passed for that purpose ; for the ensums  
season, however, they will be required to  
be in readiness, should their service  
  
wanted. Some small and special detach-  
ments have been necessary to maintain the  
laws of embargo, on that portion of our  
northern frontier which offered pect!i2!  
facilities for evasion ; but these were replaced  
as soon as it could be done, by bodies ©  
  
  
  
} new recruits. (Yo be continued)

lation to the commerce of the United States, their trade  
“ would be opened wit her, and remain shut to her enemy,  
in case of his failure to rescind his Decrees also, From  
France no answer has been reccived, nor any indication  
&#x27; that the requisite change in her Decrees is contemplated.  
The favourable reception of the proposition to Great Bri-  
tain was the less to be, doubted, as her Orders of Council  
‘ bad not only been referred for their vindication to anac-  
, quiescence oh the part of the United States, no longer to

.returhi fer the privations imposed by the measure, and  
which our fellow-citizens in géneral have borne with pa-  
triotism, it has had the important effects of saving our  
yoariners.and our vast mercantile property, as well as of  
affording time for prosecuting the defensive and provisional

to fereign nations the mederation and firmness which

ditional military force, so many ollicers were immediately  
appoitted as were necessary for carrying on tho. business  
of recruiting ; and -in proportion as it advanced, others  
have been added, We have reason to believe their suc-  
cess has been satisfactory, althongh such returns have not  
been received, as enable me to present youa statement of  
the numbers engaged.  
  
** I have not theught.it necessary, in the course of the  
last season, to call for any general detachments of Militia,  
or of Volancers, under the laws passed for that parpose ;  
for the ensuing season, however, they will be required to

aud of the armed vessels called into service in other quar-  
ters, the spirit of disobedience and abuse, which mani-  
fested itselé early, and withsensible effect, while we were  
unprepared to meet it, has been considerably repressed.  
  
** Considering the extraordinary character of the times  
in which we live, our atteution should uoremittingly be  
fixed on the safety of our country, Fora people who  
are free, and who mean to remain so,a well organised and  
armed Militia isthéir best security. It is, therefore, in-  
eumbent on us at every meeting to revise the condition of  
the Militia, aid to ask ourselves if it is prepared to repel  
a powerful evemy at every point of our territories ex-  
posed to invasion, Some of the States have paid a kwud-  
able attention (o this object, but every degree of neglect  
is to be found among others, Congress alone having the  
power to predyce an unjform state of preparation in this  
great organ of defence, the interests which they so deeply  
feel in their owa&#x27;and their country’s security, will pre-  
sent this as among the most important objects of their de-  
liberation,  
  
‘* Under the Acts of March’ 11, and April 23, re-  
specting armg, the difficulty of procuring them’ from a-  
broad, during the present situation and dispositions of  
Europe, indaced us to direct our whele efforts to the means  
of internal supply ; the public factories have, therefore,  
been enlarged, ddditional machiveries erected, and, in  
p&#x27;oportion as actificers ean be found or formed, their ef-  
fect, already more than doubled, may be increased so as  
to keep pace with the yearly increase of the Militia.  
The anoval sums appropriated by. the latter .Act, have  
been directed to the eucouragement of private factories  
of arms; and contracts have been,entered into with isidi-  
vidual undertakers, to ncarly th® amount of the first  
year’s appropriation, .  
  
** The suspension of our foreign commerec, produced  
by the injustice of the Belligereut Powers, and the cop-  
sequeut losses aud sacrifices of our Citizens, are subjects  
of just concern, The situation into which we Neve thus  
been forced, tas impelled us te apply a portion of our in-  
dustry and capital to internal manufactures and impreve-

and little doubt remaing that, the establishments formed

ascertained, (hat. the receipts have amounted ty ucar  
  
eighteen millions of dollars, which, with the eight mil-,  
lions and a half in the Treasury at the beginning of the

gratitude, for the repeated proofs of contidence mani-  
fested to me by themselves and their predecessors, since  
my call to the administration, and the many indulgencies  
experienced at their bands; the same grateful acknon.  
ledgments are due to my fellow-citizens gencrally, whose  
support has been my great encouragement under all eu,  
barrassments, . Io the transaction of their business, I can-  
not haye escaped error—it is incident to our imperfect  
nature; but I may say with truth, my errors have been  
of the understanding, not of intention ; and that the ad-  
  
‘yancement of their rights and interests has been the con-  
  
stapt motive for every measure On these considerations  
I solicit their indulgence. Looking forward with anxiety  
to their future destinies, [ trust, that in their steady cha-  
racter, unshaken by difficulties, in their love of liberty,  
obedience to law, and support of the public-authorities, I  
see a sure guarantee of the permanence of our Republic ;  
and, retiring from the charge of their affairs, l carry with  
  
‘ine the consolation of a tirm persuasion, that Heaven has  
  
in store for our ‘beloved Country long ages to come of

«The Creeks,” says the President,  
in his speech, ‘are exerting them-  
selves to arrest offenders against the  
laws; and the Choctaws have mani-  
fested their readiness and desire for  
amicabie and just arrangement respect:  
ing depredations committed by dis-  
orderly persons: and generally, from  
a conviction, that xe consider them  
as a part of ourselves, and cherish,

By the aid of these, and of the armed  
vessels called into service in other quar-  
ters, the spirit of disobedience and abuse,  
which manifested itself early, and with  
sensible effect, while we were unprepar-  
ed to meet it, has been considerably re-  
pressed. — Considering the extraordinary  
character of the times, in which we live,  
our attention should unremittingly be fix-  
ed on the safety of our country. Fer a  
people who are free, and who mean to re-  
mainso, a well organized and armed militia  
is their best security. It is therefore incum-  
bent*on us, at every meeting, to revise the  
condition of the militia, and to ask ourselves  
if it is prepared to repel a powerful enemy  
at every point of our territories exposed to  
invasion. Some of the states have paid a  
laudable attention to this object, but every  
degree of neglect is to be found among  
others. Congress alone having the power  
to produce an uniform state of preparation  
in this great organ of defence, the interests  
which they so deeply feel in their own and  
their country’s security, will present this as  
among the most important objects of their  
deliberaztion.—Under the acts of March 11,  
and April 23, respecting arms, the difficulty  
of procuring them from abroad, during the  
present situation and dispositions of Europe,  
induced us to direct our whole efforts to the  
  
‘means of internal supply ; the public  
  
factories have, therefore, been enlarged,

additional machineries erected, and in pro-  
Portion as artificers can be found or formed,  
their effect, already more than doubled, may  
be increased so as to keep pace with the  
yearly increase of the militia, The annual  
sums appropriated by the latter act, have  
been directed to the encouragement of private  
factories of arms ; and contracts have been  
entered into with individual undertakers, to  
nearly the amount of the first year’s appro-  
priation—Tbe suspension of ‘our foreign  
commerce, produced by the injustice of the  
belligerent powers, and the consequent losses  
and sacrifices of our citizens, are subjects of  
just concern. The situation into which we  
have thus been forced, has impelled us to  
apply a portion of our industry and capital  
to internai manufactures and improvements.  
The extent of this conversion is daily in-  
creasing, and little doubt remains that the  
establishments formed and forming, will,  
under the auspices of cheaper materials and  
subsistence, the freedom of labour from tax-  
ation with us, and of protecting daties and pro-  
hibitions, become permanent. ‘The commerce  
with the Indians too, within ourown bounde  
aries, is likely to receive abundant aliment  
from the same internal source, and will  
secure to them peace and the progress of civili-  
zation undisturbed by practices hostile toboth.  
The accounts of the receipts and expendi-  
tures during the year ending onthe 30th  
day of September last, being not yet made  
up, a correct statement will hereafter be  
transmitted from the treasury, In the mean-  
time, it isascertained, that the receipts have  
amounted to near eighteen millions of dol-  
lars, which, with the eight millions and a  
half in the treasury atthe beginning of the  
year, have enabled us, after meeting the  
current demands and interest incurred, to  
pay two millions three hundred thousand  
dollars, of the principal of our funded debt,  
and left us in the treasury on that day, near  
fourteen millions of dollars; of these, five  
millions three hundred and fifty thousand  
dollars will be necessary to pay what will  
be due on the first day of January next,  
which will complete the reimbursement of  
the eight per cent. stock. These payments,  
with those made in the six years and a. half  
preceding, will have extinguished thirty.  
three millions five hundred and eighty thou-  
sand dollars of the principal of the funded  
debt, being the whole which could be paid  
or purchased within the limits of the law  
and of our contracts; and the amount of  
principal thus discharged, will have liberated  
the revenue from about two millions of dol-  
Jars of interest, and added that sum annually

experienced at their hands ; the same grate-  
ful acknowledgments are due to my fellow-  
citizens generally, whose support has been  
my great encouragement under all embar-  
rassments. In tke transaction of their  
business, I cannot have escaped error—it is  
incident to our imperfect nature; but I  
may say, with truth, my errors have been  
of the understanding, not of intention ;  
and that the advancement of their rights and  
interests has been the constant motive for  
  
every measure. On these considerations, F-  
  
solicit their indulgence. Looking forward  
with anxiety to their future destinies, I  
trust, that in their steady character, un-  
shaken by difficulties, in their love of li-  
berty, obedience to law, and support of  
the public authorities, I see a sure guarantee  
of the permanence of our republic ; and,  
retiring from the charge of their affairs, I  
carry with me the consolation of a firm  
persuasion, that heaven has in store for our  
beloved country, long ages to come of pros-  
perity and happiness. —T Hos. JEFFERSON.

** It would have been n source, fellow-  
eituensK of touch gratification, if our last  
foiurpuuiculioiis from Europa hud enuhted  
fnc to luformyoti, that the belligerent nations,  
whoNC disregard of neutral right has been «o  
destructive to our commerce, had become  
Ewakeoed to the duty und tiie policy of  
fevoking their unrighteous edicts. That no  
means mjght be omitted to produce this  
military effect, I lost no time in availing  
mystdf of the Act authorising a suspension,  
fu whole, or in part, of the several embargo  
law^s^./ Our ministers&#x27; at London and Pans  
were instructed to explain to the respective  
govemuicnts there our disposition to exercise  
the authority ip such ntanner as would wiih-  
&lt;^raw the pretext on which the aggressions  
were or&#x27;igtnally ^&#x27;oundeil,. and open the way  
a renewal pf that commercial intercourse,  
Vhich it was alleged, on all sides, had been  
reluctantly obstructed. As each of these  
^verpmepts had pledged its readipess td  
concur in renouncing a measure, which  
jeached its adversary through the incontesti-  
nle &#x27;rights of.neutrals only, and as theineHsuro  
had been assumed by each as a retaliation  
for an asserted acquiescence in the aggres*  
sions of the other, it was reasonably rx[&gt;ecte&lt;l  
that the occasion would have been seized by  
both&#x27;,, for evincing the sincerity of their pro¬  
fessions, and fur restoring to the United Slates  
its Irgitimure fracduni* The instructions to  
our ministers, with respect to the different  
Jfelhgercnts, were necessarily modified with a  
reference to their different circumstances,  
and to the condition annexed by law to the  
.executive power of suspension, requiring e  
itegrec of security to our commerce, whicii  
would rot result from a repeal of the decrees  
of France. Instead of a pledge, therefore,  
. lor.a suspension of the embargo as to her, in  
case of such a repeal, it was pretumed that a  
iulficibot iu4uccfaeat miglit be found in  
  
other consideratmni, and particularly 4ii thf  
change produced by a compliance with &lt;our  
just demands, by one belligerent, and •  
refusal by the other, lu the reUttons butweea  
such country and the United States. To  
Great Bcitaiiu whose power on the ocean. U  
so Hscendauf, it was rleemed not uiconaisteut  
wiUithat oondition, to static explicitly, that  
on her re.scinditig her orders in relation to  
the commerce of the United States, their  
trade would be opened with her. and reuuia  
shut to her enemy, in case of his failure  
,10, rescind his decrees also. From France  
no auswer has been received, nor any in¬  
dication that the requisite change ip her  
decrees is conteniplated. The favourable  
reception of tlie proposition to Great Hntaia  
was the less to be doubted, as her Orders of  
Council had not only been referred lor their  
vindication to an acquiescence on the part  
of the United States, no longer to be  
pretended; but as the arrangemetit proposed*  
whilst it resisted the illegal decrees qf&#x27;  
France, involved, moreover, .substantially.,  
the precise advantages professedly aimed af  
by the Uritish Onlers. The arrangemetit  
has, nevertheless, been rejectad. j  
  
** This caiiflid and lilx&#x27;rNl experiment  
having llius failed, and no other evenf having  
occurred on wh:ch a suspension of the en^-  
bargo by the executive whs authorised, it  
necessarily remains in the extent originijdJy  
given to It. \V« have the satiafactioa*  
however, to reflect, that m return for tlia

538 AMessageof the President to the United States,  
  
freedom. The inftruétions to our miniflersy  
with refpe&amp; to the different Belligerents,  
were neceflarily modified with a reference to  
their different circumstances, and to the  
condition annexed by law to the executive  
power of fufpenfion, requiring a degree of  
security to our commerce, which would not  
refult from a repeal of the decrees of France.  
Initead of a pledge, therefore, for a fufpention  
of the embargo as to her, in cafe of fuch a  
sepeal, it was prefumed that a fuflicient in-  
ducement might de found in other confide-  
rations, and particularly in the change pro-  
duced by a compliance with our juft demands,  
by one Helligerent, and a refufal by the  
other, in the relations between this other  
and the United States. To Great Britain,  
whofe power on the ocean Its fo afcendant, it  
wis deemed not inconfiftent with that con-  
dition, to ftate, explicitly, that on her  
refcinding her orders in relation to the com-  
merce of the United States, their trade  
would be opened with her, and remain fhut  
to her enemy, in cafe of his failure to rescind  
his decrees allo. From France no anfwer has  
been received, nor any indication that the  
requifite change in her decrees is contem-  
plated. The favourable reception of the  
propofition to Great Britain was the lefs to  
be doubted, as her orders of council had not  
only been referred for their vindication to an  
acquiefcence on the part of the United  
States, no longer to be pretended ; but as the  
arrangement propofed, whilft it refifted the  
illegal decrees of France, invoived, moreover,  
fubftantially the precife advantages profef-  
fedly aimed at by the Britith orders. The  
arrangement has, neverthelefs, been rejected.  
  
This candid and liberal experiment having  
thus failed, and no other event having oc-  
curred on which a fulpenfion of the embargo  
by the executive was authorifed, it neces-  
farily remains in the extent originally given  
toit. We have the satisfaction, however,  
to refleét, thatin return for the privations  
impofed by the meafure, and which our fel-  
low-citizens in general have borne with  
patriotifm, it has had the important effects of  
faving our mariners, and our vatt mercantile  
property, as well as of affording time for  
profecuting the defenfive and provifional  
meatfures called for by the occafion. it has  
demonftrated to foreign nations the mode-  
ration and firmnels which govern our coun-  
cils, and to our citizens the neceility of uni-  
ting in fupport of the laws-and the rights of  
their country; and has thus long truftrated  
thofe ufurpations and fpoliations which, if  
retifted, involved war 5 if fubmitted to, facri-  
ficed a vital principle of our national inde-  
pendence.  
  
Under a continuance of the belligerent  
meafures, which, in cefiance of laws which  
confecrate the rights of neutrals, overf{pread  
the ocean with danger, it will ret with the  
wifdom of congrefs to decide an the courfe  
Beit adapted to fuch a Mate of things; and

which the clofe of the difcuftion relating to  
the attack by a Britith thip of war on the

the nation had manifefted fo honourable a  
fenfibility. Every view of what had paffed  
authorized a belief that immediate fteps would  
be taken by the Britith government for re-  
drefling a wrong, which, the more it wa  
inveftigated, appeared the more clearly to  
require what had not been provided for in  
the fpecial miflion. It is found that no fteps  
have been taken for the purpofe. On the  
contrary, it will be feen in the documents  
laid before you, that the inadmiflible preli-  
minary which obftruéts the adjuftment is ftill  
adhered to; and, moreover, that it is now  
brought into connexion with the difting and

inftructions which had been givea to our

for the enluing feafon, however, they will  
be required to be in readinefs, fhould their  
fervice be wanted. Some {mall and {pecial  
detachments have been necefiary to maintain  
the laws of embargo, on that portion of our  
Northern frontier which offered peculiar fa-  
cilities for evafion ; but thefe were replaced,  
as foon as it could be done, by bodies of new  
recruits. By the aid of thefe, and of the  
armed veflels called into fervice in other  
quarters, the fpirit of difobedience and abufe,  
which manifefted itfelf early, and with fenfi-  
ble effect, while we were unprepared to meet  
it, has been confiderably repreffed.  
  
Confidering the extraordinary character of  
the times in which we live, uur attention  
fhould unremittingly be fixed on the fafety  
of our country. Fora people who are free,  
and who remain fo, a well organized and ar-  
med Militia is the beit fecurity. It is  
therefore incumbent on us at every meeting,  
to revife the condition of the Militia, and  
to afk ourfelves if it is prepared to repel a  
powerful enemy at every point of our terri-  
tories expofed to invafion. Some of the  
States have paid a laudable attention to this  
objeft, but every degree of negle&amp; is to be  
found among others. Congrefs alone having  
the power to produce an uniform ftate of  
preparation in this great organ of defence,  
the interefts which they fo deeply feel in  
their own and their country’s fecuricy, will  
prefent this as among the moft important ob-  
jects of their deliberation.  
  
Under the Aéts of March 11, and April  
23, refpefting arms, the difficulty of procu-  
ring them from abroad, during the prefent  
fituation and difpofitions of Europe, induced  
us to direét our whole efforts to the means  
of internal fupply, the public faftories have,  
therefore, been enlarged, additional machie  
neties erected, and, in proportion as arti-  
ficers can be found or formed, thicir effect,  
already more than doubled, may be increafed  
fo as to keep pace with the yearly increafe  
ofthe Militia, The anoual fums appropria-  
ted by the latter act, have been diretted to  
  
-the encouragement of private faftories’ of  
  
arms ; and contracts have been entered into  
with individual undertakers, to searly the  
amount of the firft year’s appropriation.  
  
The fufpenfion of our foreign commerce,  
produced by the injuttice of the Belligerent  
Powers, and the confequent ioffes and facri-  
fices of our Citizens, are fubjects of juft  
concern. The fituation into which we have  
thus been forced, has impelled us toapply a  
portion of our induftry and capital to inter-  
nal manufactures and improvements. The  
extent of this converfion is daily eacreafing,  
and little doubt remains that the eftadlith-  
ments formed and forming, will, under the  
avfoices of cheaper materials and fubliftence,

millions three hundred thoufand dollars of  
the principal of our funded debt, and left us  
in the ‘Treafury on that day, near four-

would have been inevitable—The instruc-  
tions to our ministers, says the president, with  
respect to the different belligerents, were ne-  
cessarity modified with a reference to their  
different circumstances, and to the condition,  
aunexed by law to the executive power of sus-  
pension, requiring a degree of security to our  
  
repeal of the decrees of France. Instead of  
a pledge, therefore, for a suspension of the  
embargo as to her,. in case of such a repeal, it  
was presumed that a sufficient inducement  
might be found in other constdergtions, and  
particularly in the chauge produced by acom-  
pliance with our just demands, by one belli-  
gerent, and a refusal by the other, in the  
relation between this other and the United.  
States. To Great Britain, whose power on  
the ocean is so ascendant, it was deemed not  
inconsisient with that condition, to state  
explicitly, thaton her rescinding her orders,  
in relation to the commerce of the United  
States, their trade would be opened with her,  
and remain shut to her enemy, in case of his  
failure to rescind his decrees also, From  
Frange no answer has heen received, nor auy  
indication that a requisite change in her de-  
erees is contemplated. ‘The favourable recep-  
tion of the proposition to Great Britain wes  
the less to be doubted, as her orders of coun-  
cil had not only been referred for their vindi-  
cation 10 at a¢quiescence on the part of the  
United States, ng longer to be pretended :&#x27;  
batas the arrangement proposed, whilst ‘it  
resisted the illegal decrees of &#x27;rauce, involved,  
moreover, substantially, the precise advanta-  
ges professedly aimed at by the British orders.  
The arrangement has, nevertheless, been  
ej:eted —Phis candid and liberal experiment  
  
  
  
960]  
  
having thus failed, and no other event  
having occurred on which a suspension of the  
embargo by the executive was authorised, it  
necessarily remains in the extent originally  
given to it. — We have the satisfaction, how-  
ever, to reflect that in return for the privations  
imposed by the measure, and which our fel-  
low-citizens in genetal have borne with patri-  
otism, it has had the important effect of  
saving our mariners, and our vast mercantile  
property, as well as of affording time for pro-  
secuting the defensive and provisional mea-  
sures called for by the oceasion. It has de-  
monstrated to foreign nations the moderation  
and firmness which governs our couneils,  
and to our citizens the necessity of uniting in  
support of the laws and the rights of their  
couatry ; and has thus long frustrated those  
usurpations and spoliations, which, if resisted,  
involved war; if submitted to, sacrificed a  
vital principle of our national independence.”

frigate Chesapeake, left a subject on which  
the nation had manifested so honourable a

be*taken by the British government for re-  
dressing a wrong, which, the more it was  
investigated, appeared the more clearly to  
require what had not been provided for in the  
special mission. It is found that no steps  
have been taken for the purpose. On the  
contrary, it will be seen in the documents  
laid before you, that the inadmissible preli-  
minary which obstructs the adjustment is still  
adhered to ; and, moreover, that it is now

That Mr. Jefferson meant by Protection pre­  
cisely what we do, is proved by his Message  
of Dee. 2, 1806, when anticipating the payment  
of our Debt and a surplus of revenue, he asks:  
To what other objects shall these surpluses be approe  
priated, and the whole surplus after the entire diacharge­  
priate de abile bebt? Shall ase suppress the impost, and  
dire that adrantage to foreign, orer domestie inanufuc

So, in his last Annual Message (Nov. 8, 1808.  
Mr. Jefferson says:

portion of our industry and capital to interna matufac  
fures and improvements. The extent of this conversion  
is daily increasing; and little doubt remaits that the­

Few, even of those called &quot;protection ex­  
tremists,&quot; has ever taken stronger grounds  
than does Mr. Jefferson in this report in favor  
of the protection of American industry and  
of our navigation interests. So, throughout  
his own administration, he maintained Madi  
son&#x27;s protective tariff of July 4, 1789, with its  
several subsequent modifications, enlarging  
its protective field and duties. In his second  
inaugural he congratulates the country, with  
  
evident pride and satisfaction, on the abolish­  
ment of all internal revenue taxation. In his  
  
eighth annual message of Nov. 8, 1808, he  
says  
The suspension of our foreign commerce, pro­  
duced by the injustice of the belligerent powers  
and the consequent losses and sacrifices of our  
citizens, are subjects of just concern. The situa  
tion into which we have been thus forced has im­  
pelled us to apply a portion of our industry and
