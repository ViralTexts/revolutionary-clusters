ots to the Senate, in a distinct capacity, are comprised in their participation with the Executive in the appointment to offices, and in their judicial character as a court for the trial of impeachments. As in the business of appointments the Executive will be the principal agent, the provisions relating to it will most properly be discussed in the examination of that department. We will therefore conclude this head with a view of the judicial character of the Senate.  
A well constituted court for the trial of impeachments, is an object not more to be desired than difficult to be obtained in a government wholly elective. The subjects of its jurisdiction are those offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or in other words from the abuse or violation of some public trust. They are of a nature which may with peculiar propriety be denominated POLITICAL, as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself. The prosecution of them, for this reason, will seldom fail to agitate the passions of the whole community, and to divide it into parties, more or less friendly or inimical, to the accused. In many cases, it will connect itself with the pre-existing factions, and will inlist all their animosities, partialities, influence and interest on one side, or on the other; and in such cases there will always be the greatest danger, that the decision will be regulated more by the comparitive strength of parties than by the real demonstrations of innocence or guilt.  
The delicacy and magnitude of a trust, which so deeply concerns the political reputation and existence of every man engaged in the administration of public affairs, speak for themselves. The difficulty of placing it rightly in a government resting entirely on the basis of periodical elections will as readily be perceived, when it is considered that the most conspicuous characters in it will, from that circumstance, be too often the leaders, or the tools of the most cunning or the most numerous faction; and on this account can hardly be expected to possess the requisite neutrality towards those, whose conduct may be the subject of scrutiny.  
The Convention, it appears, thought the Senate the most fit depositary of this important trust. Those who can best discern the intrinsic difficulty of the thing will be least hasty in condemning that opinion; and will be most inclined to allow due weight to the arguments which may be supposed to have produced it.  
What it may be asked is the true spirit of the institution itself? Is it not designed as a method of NATIONAL INQUEST into the conduct of public men? If this be the design of it, who can so properly be the inquisitors for the nation, as the representatives of the nation themselves? It is not disputed that the power of originating the inquiry, or in other words of preferring the impeachment ought to be lodged in the hands of one branch of the legislative body; will not the reasons which indicate the propriety of this arrangement, strongly plead for an admission of the other branch of that body to a share in the inquiry? The model, from which the idea of this institution has been borrowed, pointed out that course to the Convention: In Great Britain, it is the province of the house of commons to prefer the impeachment; and of the house of lords to decide upon it. Several of the State constitutions have followed the example. As well the latter as the former seem to have regarded the practice of impeachments, as a bridle in the hands of the legislative body upon the executive servants of the government. Is not this the true light in which it ought to be regarded?  
Where else, than in the Senate could have been found a tribunal sufficiently dignified, or sufficiently independent? What other body would be likely to feel confidence enough in its own situation, to preserve unawed and uninfluenced the necessary impartiality between an individual accused, and the representatives of the people, his accusers?  
Could the Supreme Court have been relied upon as answering this description? It is much to be doubted whether the members of that tribunal would, at all times, be endowed with so eminent a portion of fortitude, as would be called for in the execution of so difficult a task; &amp; it is still more to be doubted, whether they would possess the degree of credit and authority, which might, on certain occasions, be indispensable, towards reconciling the people to a decision, that should happen to clash with an accusation brought by their immediate representatives. A deficiency in the first would be fatal to the accused; in the last, dangerous to the public tranquillity. The hazard in both these respects could only be avoided, if at all, by rendering that tribunal more numerous than would consist with a reasonable attention to œconomy. The necessity of a numerous court for the trial of impeachments is equally dictated by the nature of the proceeding. This can never be tied down by such strict rules, either in the delineation of the offence by the prosecutors, or in the construction of it by the judges, as in common cases serve to limit the discretion of courts in favor of personal security. There will be no jury to stand between the Judges, who are to pronounce the sentence of the law and the party who is to receive or suffer it. The awful discretion, which a court of impe

per substitute for the Senate, as a court of impeachments. There remains a further consideration which will not a little strengthen this conclusion. It is this—The punishment, which may be the consequence of conviction upon impeachment, is not to terminate the chastisement of the offender. After having been sentenced to a perpetual ostracism from the esteem and confidence, and honors and emoluments of his country; he will still be liable to prosecution and punishment in the ordinary course of law. Would it be proper that the persons, who had disposed of his fame and his most valuable rights as a citizen in one trial, should in another trial, for the same offence, be also the disposers of his life and his fortune? Would there not be the greatest reason to apprehend, that error in the first sentence would be the parent of error in the second sentence? That the strong bias of one decision would be apt to overrule the influence of any new lights, which might be brought to vary the complexion of another decision? Those, who know any thing of human nature, will not hesitate to answer these questions in the affirmative; and will be at no loss to perceive, that by making the same persons Judges in both cases, those who might happen to be the objects of prosecution would in a great measure be deprived of the double security, intended them by a double trial. The loss of life and estate would often be virtually included in a sentence, which, in its terms, imported nothing more than dismission from a present, and disqualification for a future office. It may be said, that the intervention of a jury, in the second instance, would obviate the danger. But juries are frequently influenced by the opinions of Judges. They are sometimes induced to find special verdicts which refer the main question to the decision of the court. Who would be willing to stake his life and his estate upon the verdict of a jury, acting under the auspices of Judges, who had predetermined his guilt?  
Would it have been an improvement of the plan, to have united the Supreme Court with the Senate, in the formation of the court of impeachments? This Union would certainly have been attended with several advantages; but would they not have been overballanced by the signal disadvantages, already stated, arising from the agency of the same Judges in the double prosecution to which the offender would be liable? To a certain extent, the benefits of that Union will be obtained from making the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court the President of the court of impeachments, as is proposed to be done in the plan of the Convention; while the inconveniencies of an intire incorporation of the former into the latter will be substantially avoided. This was perhaps the prudent mean. I forbear to remark upon the additional pretext for clamour, against the Judiciary, which so considerable an augmentation of its authority would have afforded.  
Would it have been desirable to have composed the court for the trial of impeachments of persons wholly distinct from the other departments of the government? There are weighty arguments, as well against, as in favor of such a plan. To some minds, it will not appear a trivial objection, that it would tend to increase the complexity of the political machine; and to add a new spring to the government, the utility of which would at best be questionable. But an objection, which will not be thought by any unworthy of attention, is this—A court formed upon such a plan would either be attended with heavy expence, or might in practice be subject to a variety of casualties and inconveniencies. It must either consist of permanent officers stationary at the seat of government, and of course entitled to fixed and regular stipends, or of certain officers of the State governments, to be called upon whenever an impeachment was actually depending. It will not be

that it may intimidate a modest and conscientious statesman, or  
other functionary, from accepting office; nor so weak and  
torpid, as to be capable of lulling offenders into a general

against this junction seems to us to be its interference with the

Another mode of constituting a court of impeachments would  
be the appointment of a special tribunal for this purpose, to  
which it is objected, that ‘it would tend to increase the com-  
plexity of the political machine, and add a new spring to the  
operations of the government, the utility of which would be at  
least questionable, and might clog its just movements.’ A court  
of this nature would be attended with heavy expenses; and

hearts of men. I will read a few words­  
from the Ftdcralwl bearing on the question  
before us:  
A well constituted court for the trial of im­  
peachment, is an object not more to be desired  
than difficult to be obtained in a government  
wholly elective. The subiects of Its jurisdiction  
are those o&amp;enses which proceed from the mis­  
cenductof public men, or in othcrword9, from  
the abuse or violation of some public, trust. They  
are of a nature which may with peculiar propriety  
Redenominated poiica.as theyrelate chiefly to  
injuries done immediately to the sacietv its nil&quot;.  
The prosecution of them, for this reason, will  
seldom fail to agitate the passions of the whole  
community, and to divide it into parties, more  
or less friendly, or inimical, to the accused. In  
many cases it will connect itself with the pre­  
existing factions, and will onllst all their ani­  
mosities, partialities, influence,, and interest on  
onesido or on the other; and in such cases there  
will always bo the greatest danger, that the de­  
cision will be regulated mora by the compara­  
tive strength of parties, than by the real de­  
monstrations of innocence or guilt.  
Tho delicacy and magnitude of a trust, whieh  
so deeply concerns the political reputation and  
existence ot overy man cngageam tne adminis­  
tration of public affairs, speak fo themselves.  
Tbo difficulty of placing it rightly inn govern­  
ment resting entirely oa the basis of periodical  
elections, will as readily be perceived, when it  
is considered that the most conspicuous charac­  
ters in it will, from that circumstance, hntnn  
often the lead erg or the tools of the mrst cun­  
ning or tho most numerous faction; and on this  
account, can naraiy uo expected to possess tne  
roquisite neutrality toward those whose conduct  
may bo the subject of scrutiny.  
The convention, it appears, thought the Sen  
ate the most fit depository of this Important  
trust. Those who can best discern the Intrinsic  
difficulty of the thing, will be loast hasty in  
condemning that opinion, and will be most in­  
clined to allow due weight to the arguments.  
wnicn may ne supposeu to nave proaucea it.  
Wliat.it raav be asked, is the trnesnirit nf thn  
institution itself? Is it not designed as a method  
of national inquttt into the conduct of public  
men 7 If this bethelesign of it, who con so  
properly be the inquisitors for the nation as the  
representatives of the nation themselves? It is  
not disputed that the power of originating the  
inquiry, or in other words, of preferring tho im­  
peachment, ought to be lodged in the hands of  
one branch of toe legislative bodyf will not tho  
reasons which indicate the propriety of this ar­  
rangement, strongly plead for an admission of  
the other branch of that body to a share of the  
inquiry? The model, from which the idea of  
this institution has been borrowed, pointed out  
that course to the convention. In Great Britain  
it is the nrovinco of the Houao of Commons to  
refer tho impeachment; and of the House of  
ords to decide- upon it. Several of the State  
constitutions nave loiiowea tne example. As  
well the latter as tne lormer, seem to have re­  
garded the practice of impeachments as a bridle  
tn the hands of the legislative body, upon the  
executive servants of the government. Is not  
this the true light in which it ought to be re­  
garded?&#x27;A&#x27; here else than in tbeSenateeoolJ here bssn  
found a tribunal sufficiently dignified or suffi­  
ciently independent? What other bdy would  
be likely to feel confidence onough in its own  
sitnation, to preserve unawed and uninfluenced,  
the necessary impartiality between an indi­  
vidual accused, end the representatives of the  
people, nis accusers r  
Could the Supreme Court be relied upon as  
answering this description? It is much to be  
doubted whether the members of that tribunal  
would, at ail times, be endowed with so eminent  
a portion ot fortitude as would be called tor in  
the execution of so difficult a task ; and it is still  
more to be doubted, whether tbey would D033ess  
the degree of credit and authority which might.  
on certain occasions, do lnuiipensaoie towards  
reconciling the people to a decision that would  
happen to clash with an accusation brought by  
their immediate representative!, A deficiency  
in the first, would be fatal to the accused in the  
last, dangerous to the pnblio tranquility. The  
hazard in both these respects could only be  
avoided, it at all, by rendering that tribunal  
more numerous than would consist with a  
reasonable attention to economy- The necessity  
for a numerous court for the trial of Impeach­  
ments is eouallv dictated bv the nature of the  
proceeding. This Jean never be tied down by  
such strict rules, either In the delineation of the  
offense by the prosecutors, or in the construc­  
tinn of it bv the iudee&quot;. as in common c93  
serve to limit the discretion of courts in favor of  
personal security,  
This court, therfore, is clothed&#x27; with  
larger powers than are prescribed for the  
trial of offenders before the ordinary courts  
of the country, and has, unquestionably,  
the right ot admitting or excluding mem­  
bers. Surely there ought to be no ques­  
tion with this court, as to what it ca
