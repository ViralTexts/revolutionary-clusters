of their grants with the result that there  
would be conflicting claims, and this was  
one of them. The province of Maryland  
was granted to Lord Baltimore in 1632 by  
Charles I the who later on in some dis­  
pute with his subjects at home lost his  
head.) This was an older grant than that  
of the province of Pennsylvania made  
by Charles II. to William Penn in 1681.  
The grant of Lord Baltimore reads:  
All the land from thirty-eight degrees  
north latitude unto that part of Delaware  
bay which lieth under the fortieth degree  
of north latitude, and all that tract of  
land from the aforesaid bay of Delaware

really north of Philadelphia, and it is al-

The General Government, as represented by the Continental  
Congress and later by the United States, recognized these
