1775 and 1776, and his opera­  
tions near Boston in these years.  
ChAPTer II--1774 to 1776.  
To the president of Congress an­  
nouncing this appointment, General  
Washington replied in the following  
words:  
&quot;MR. PrESIDent- Though I am  
truly sensible of the high honor done  
me in this appointment, yet I feel  
great distress from a consciousness  
that my abilities and military exper­  
ience may not be equal to the exten­  
sive and important trust. However,  
as the Congress desire it, I will enter  
upon the momentuous duty, and exert  
every power I possess in their service,  
and for support of the glorious cause.  
I beg they will accept my most cor­  
dial thanks for this distinguished tes­  
timony of their approbatien.  
&quot;But lest some unlucky event  
should happen unfavorable to my rep­  
utation, I beg it may be remembered  
by every gentleman in the room, that  
I this day declare, with the utmost  
sincerity, I do not think myself equal  
to the command I am honored with,  
&quot;As te pay, sir, I beg leave to as­  
sure the Congress that as no pecun­  
iary consideration could have tempt-  
ed me to accept this arduous employ­  
ment, at the expense of my domestic  
sase and happiness, I do not wish to  
make any profit from it. I will keep  
an exact account of my expenses;  
those I doubt not they will discharge,  
and that is all I desire.
