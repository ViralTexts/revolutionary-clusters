discover such, it will be requisite to oblige all who travel in any part of the country, under the same penalties to carry with them certificates either of their coming from places not infected or of their passing the line by permission—for when a person gets off thus clandestinely, will be

When the sick persons are gone to the hospitals particular care should be observed in destroying their cloathes and bedding and other articles which are supposed to harbour the quintessence of contagion, these should be taken out of the town in the night and burnt, buried very deep, or sunk in the Sea. for many persons may be recovered from a disease the

tain the sick should be well cleaned and aired, for as nastiness is a great scourse of infection so cleanliness is the greatest preservative, which shews to us the true reason why the poor are most obnoxious to contagious disorders, for while the contagion is kept nursed up in a house it is impossible but the air should become tainted in so eminent a degree as to spread the infection into the neighbourhood on the first outlet—the shutting up of houses so infected is only keeping so many seminaries of contagion sooner or later to be dispersed abroad: for the waiting a month or longer from the death of the last patient, will avail no more than keeping a bale of infected goods unpacked, the poison will fly out, whenever the pandora’s box is opened. and it has been remarked of the Persians that though their country is surrounded every Year with the plague they seldom or never suffer any thing by it themselves: and it is likewise known that they are the most cleanly people of any in the world, and that many among them make it a great part of their religion to remove filthiness and nuisances of every kind from all places about their cities and dwellings.

n the middle of the day if it prove warm weather. To keep at a distance from the sick ought to be strictly adhered to, and to such who have but lately recovered—for the greater security herein it will be adviseable to avoid all crowds of people—nay the magistrates should oblige all who get over the disease to confine themselves for some time before they appear abroad—The advice to keep at a distance from the sick is also to be understood of the dead bodies, which should be buried at as great a distance from dwelling-houses as may be put deep in the earth at some distance from each other, and covered with the exactest care—the Coffins should be well rubbed with spirits of tar, or camphorated spirits of wine; the dead bodies should be carried out in the night, while they are  
  
yet fresh and free from putrefaction; and there ought to be fire-grates with some kettles of tar or resin set near the graves, as soon as the remains are interred—As all reasonable provisions should be made for the sound and sick who perform quarantine, so the strict keeping of it ought to be inforced by the severest penalties—and if a ship comes from any place where the contagion has raged at the time of the ships departure from it, with more than usual Violence; it will be the securest method to sink all the goods and even the ship sometimes, especially if any on board has died of the disease—Nor ought this further caution to be omitted that when the contagion has ceased in any place by the approach of winter, it will not be safe to open a free trade with it too soon—because there are instances of the distemper’s being stopt by the winter’s cold, and yet the seeds of it not destroyed, but only kept unactive till the warmth of the following spring has given them new life and force—which I fear will be the same with the Yellow fever which has been so destructive in the continent of Ame[r]ica! If the within rules had been strictly adhered to when the fever first broke out at Grenada—I am certain that the contagion would not have made so rapid a progress.
