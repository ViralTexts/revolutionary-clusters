ce from his Eastern tour; now, every day to be expected.  
I shall take the liberty now, my dear sir, to suggest a matter, which would (if I am not too short sighted a politician) mark your administration as an important œra in the Annals of this Country, if it should be recommended by you, &amp; adopted by the Assembly.  
It has been long my decided opinion, that the shortest, easiest &amp; least expensive communication with the invaluable &amp; extensive Country back of us, would be by one, or both of the rivers of this State which have their sources in the apalachian mountains. Nor am I singular in this opinion—Evans, in his Map and Analysis of the middle Colonies which (considering the early period at which they were given to the public) are done with amazing exactness. And Hutchins since, in his topographical  
  
description of the Western Country, (good part of which is from actual surveys)—are decidedly of the same sentiments;

l or could effect. Taking Detroit then (which is putting ourselves in as unfavourable a point of view as we can be well placed, because it is upon the line of the British territory) as a point by which, as I have already observed, all that part of the trade must come, it appears from the statement enclosed, that the tide waters of this State are nearer to it by 168 miles than that of the river St Lawrence; or than that of the Hudson at Albany by 176 miles.  
Maryland stands upon similar ground with Virginia. Pennsylvania altho’ the Susquehanna is an unfriendly water, much impeded it is said with rocks &amp; rapids, &amp; nowhere communicating with those which lead to her capital; have it in contemplation to open a communication between Toby’s Creek (which empties into the Alleghany river, 95 miles above Fort Pitt) &amp; the west branch of Susquehanna; &amp; to cut a Canal between the waters of the latter, &amp; the Schuylkill; the expence of which is easier to be conceived than estimated or described by me. A people however, who are possessed of the spirit of Commerce—who see, &amp; who will pursue their advantages, may atchieve almost anything. In the meantime, under the uncertainty of these undertakings, they are smoothing the roads &amp; paving the ways for the trade of that Western World. That New York will do the same so soon as the British Garrisons are removed; which are at present insurmountable obstacles in their way, no person who knows the temper, genius &amp; policy of those people as well as I do, can harbour the smallest doubt.  
  
Thus much with respect to rival States—let me now take a short view of our own; &amp; being aware of the objections which are in the way; I will enumerate, in order to contrast them with the advantages.  
The first &amp; principal one is, the unfortunate Jealousy, which ever has &amp; it is to be feared ever will prevail, lest one part of the State should obtain an advantage over the other part (as if the benefits of trade were not diffusive &amp; beneficial to all)—then follow a train of difficulties viz:—that our people are already heavily taxed—that we have no money; that the advantages of this trade are remote; that the most direct rout for it is thro’ other States, over whom we have no controul; that the routs over which we have controul, are as distant as either of those which lead to Philadelphia, Albany or Montreal; that a sufficient spirit of commerce does not pervade the Citizens of this Commonwealth; that we are in fact doing for others, what they ought to do for themselves.

t receiving its benefits—common policy therefore points clearly &amp; strongly, to the propriety of our enjoying all the advantages which nature &amp; our local situation afford us; and evinces clearly that unless this spirit could be totally eradicated in other States, as well as in this, and every man made to become either a cultivator of the Land, or a manufacturer of such articles as are prompted by necessity, such stimulas should be employed as will force this spirit; by shewing to our Countrymen the superior advantages we possess beyond others; &amp; the importance of being upon a footing with our Neighbours.

&amp; which will, so soon as matters are settled with the Indians, &amp; the terms on which Congress mean to dispose of the Land, &amp; found to be favourable, are announced —settle faster than any other ever did, or any  
  
one would imagine. This then when considered in an interested point of view, is alone sufficient to excite our endeavours; but in my opinion, there is a political consideration for so doing, which is of still greater importance.  
I need not remark to you Sir, that the flanks &amp; rear of the United States are possessed by other powers—&amp; formidable ones, too; nor, how necessary it is to apply the cement of interest, to bind all parts of the Union together by indissoluble bonds—especially that part of it, which lies immediately west of us, with the middle States. For, what ties, let me ask, shou’d we have upon those people? How entirely unconnected with them shall we be, and what troubles may we not apprehend, if the Spaniards on their right, &amp; Gt Britain on their left, instead of throwing stumbling blocks in their way as they now do, should hold out lures for their trade and alliance. What, when they get strength, which will be sooner than most people conceive (from the emigration of foreigners who will have no particular predilection towards us, as well as from the removal of our own Citizens) will be the consequence of their having formed close connexions with both, or either of those powers in a commercial way? It needs not, in my opinion, the gift of prophecy to foretell.  
The Western settlers, (I speak now from my own observation) stand as it were upon a pivot—the touch of a feather, would turn them any way—They have look’d down the Mississippi, until the Spaniards (very impoliticly I think, for themselves) threw difficulties in their way; &amp; they looked that way for no other reason, than because they could glide gently down the stream; without considering perhaps, the fatigues of the voyage back again, &amp; the time necessary to perform it in: &amp; because they have no other means of coming to us but by a long Land transportation &amp; unimproved roads. These causes have hitherto checked the industry of the present settlers; for except the demand for provisions, occasioned by the increase of population, &amp; a little flour which the necessities of Spaniards compel them to buy, they have no excitements to labour. But smooth the road once, &amp; make easy the way for them, &amp; then see what an influx of articles will be poured in upon us—how amazingly our exports will be encreased

For my own part, I think it highly probable, that upon the strictest scrutiny (if the Falls of the Great Kanhawa can be made navigable, or a short portage had there)—it will be found of equal importance &amp; convenience to improve the navigation of both the James &amp; Potomac. The latter I am fully persuaded affords the nearest communication with the Lakes; but James river may be more convenient for all the settlers below the mouth of the Gt Kanhawa, &amp; for some distance perhaps above, &amp; west of it: for I have no expectation that any part of the trade above the falls of the Ohio

There is in the State of Pennsylvania at least 100,000 souls west of the Laurel hill, who are groaning under the inconveniencies of a long land transportation; they are wishing, indeed they are looking for the improvement &amp; extension of inland navigation; &amp; if this cannot be made easy for them, to Philada (at any rate it must be lengthy), they will seek a Mart elsewhere—the consequence  
  
of which would be, that the State, tho’ contrary to the policy &amp; interests of its Sea-ports, must submit to the loss of so much of its trade, or hazard not only the trade but the loss of the Settlement also: for an opposition on the part of Government to the extension of water transportation, so consonant with the essential interests of a large body of people, or any extraordinary impositions upon the exports or imports to, or from another State, would ultimately bring on a separation between its Eastern &amp; Western Settlements—towards which, there is not wanting a disposition at this moment in that part of it, which is beyond the mountains.  
I consider Rumsey’s discovery for working Boats against stream, by mechanical powers (principally) as not only a very fortunate invention for these States in general, but as one of those circumstances which have combined to render the present epocha favourable above all others for fixing, if we are disposed to avail ourselves of them, a large portion of the trade of the Western Country in the bosom of this State irrevocably.

The political importance of establishing commercial con-  
nections with the West seems to have impressed Washing-  
ton most profoundly. He reminds Harrison how “the  
flanks and rear of the United States are possessed by other  
powers, and formidable ones too” [Spain and England].  
He dwells upon the necessity of cementing all parts of the  
Union together by common interests. The Western States  
stand now, he says, “upon a pivot.” A touch would turn  
them. The stream of commerce would glide gently down  
the Mississippi unless shorter and easier channels were  
made for it to Atlantic seaports. Washington urges that  
commissioners be appointed to make a careful survey of the  
Potomac and James rivers to their respective sources and  
that a complete map of the whole country intervening be-  
tween the seaboard, the Ohio waters, and the Great Lakes,  
be presented to the public. “These things being done,” he  
says, “I shall be mistaken if prejudice does not yield to  
facts, jealousy to candor, and, finally, if reason and nature,  
thus aided, do not dictate what is right and proper to be  
done.”

NoTE 2.— Pennsylvania — although the Susquehanna is an unfriendly  
water, much impeded, it is said, with rocks and rapids, and nowhere com-  
municating with those which lead to her capital,— has it in contemplation  
to open a communication between Toby’s Creek, which empties into the  
Allegheny River 95 miles above Fort Pitt, and the west branch of the  
Susquehanna, and to cut a canal between the waters of the latter and the  
Schuylkill, the expense of which is easier to be conceived than estimated  
or described by me. A people, however, who are possessed of the spirit of  
commerce, who see and who will perceive its advantages, may achieve  
almost anything. In the meantime, and the uncertainty of these under-  
takings, they are smoothing the road and paving the ways for the trade of  
the western world.— Gen. Washington to Gov. Harrison, Oct. 10, 1784.

by means of the Potomac and James Rivers, says: “It has long been my  
decided opinion that the shortest, easiest and least expensive communica-  
tion with the invaluable and extensive country back of us would be by one  
or both of the rivers of this State, which have their sources in the  
Apalachian Mountians. Nor am I singular in this opinion. Evans, in his  
map and analysis of the Middle Colonies, which, considering the early  
period at which they were given to the public, are done with amazing  
exactness, and Hutchins* since, in his Typographical Description of the  
Western Country, a good part of which is from actual surveys, are decidedly  
of the same sentiments.”

“The navigation of the Ohio,” he continues, “ being well known, they  
will have less to do in the examination of it; but, nevertheless, let the  
courses and distances be taken to the mouth of the Muskingum, and up  
that river (notwithstanding it is in the ceded lands) to the carrying place  
to the Cuyahoga; down the Cuyahoga to Lake Erie, and thence to Detroit.  
Let them do the same with Big Beaver Creek, although part of it is in the  
State of Pennsylvania; and also with the Scioto. In a word, let the waters  
east and west of the Ohio, which invite our notice by their proximity, and  
by the ease with which land transportation may be had between them and  
the lakes on one side, and the Rivers Potomac and James on the other, be  
explored, accurately delineated, and a correct and connected map of the  
whole be presented to the public.”  
  
He estimated that if the improvements here indicated should be con-  
structed, the distance from Detroit, “ by which all the trade of the North-  
western part of the United Territory must pass” to the tide- waters of Vir-  
ginia, could be made 176 miles less than to those of the Hudson at Albany.
