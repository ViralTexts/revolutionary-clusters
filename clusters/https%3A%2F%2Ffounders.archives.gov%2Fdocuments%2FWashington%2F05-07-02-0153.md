And the general Assembly of the Commonwealth of Virginia, by an Act passed on the third day of December, One thousand seven hundred and eighty nine, and intituled “An Act for the Cession of ten miles square, or any lesser quantity of Territory, within this State, to the United States in Congress assembled, ⟨for⟩ the permanent Seat of the General Government,” did enact, That a tract of Country not exceeding ten miles square, or any lesser quantity to be located within the limits of the said State, and in any part thereof, as Congress might by Law direct,

And the Congress of the United States by their Act passed the sixteenth day of July one thousand seven hundred and ninety &amp; intituled “An act for establishing the temporary and permanent Seat of the Government of the United States” authorized the President of the United States to appoint three Commissioners to survey under his direction, and by proper metes and bounds, to limit a District of Territory not exceeding ten miles square, on the River potomac, at some place between the mouths of the Eastern Branch and Connogochegue, which District so to be located and limited, was accepted by the said Act of Congress, as the District for the permanent Seat of the Government of the United States.  
Now therefore, In pursuance of the Powers to me confided, and after duly examining and weighing the advantages and disadvantages of the several situations within the Limits aforesaid, I do hereby declare and make known, that the location of one part of the said district of ten miles square, shall be found by running four lines of experiment in the following manner, that is to say, Running from the Court House in Alexandria in Virginia, due south west half a mile, and thence a due south East course, till it shall strike Hunting Creek, to fix the beginning of the said four lines of Experiment.

To show the futility of the objection, we insert  
the acts of cession. ‘The cession of Maryland was  
made in November, 1778, and is as follows : **An  
act to cede to Congress a district of ten miles square  
im this state for the’seat of government of the United  
States.”  
  
“Be it enacted, by the General Assembly of  
Maryland, that the representatives of this state in  
the House of Representatives of Congress of the  
United States, appointed to assemble at New York,  
on the first Wednesday of March next, be, and they  
are hereby authorised and required on the behalf of  
this state to cede to the Congress of the United  
States, any district in this state, not exceeding ten  
miles square, which the Congress may fix upon  
and accept for the seat of government of the United  
States.” Laws of Maryland, vol, 2, chap. 46  
  
The cession from Virginia, was made by act of  
the Legislature of that State, on the 3d of December,  
1778, in the following words :  
  
“Be it enacted by the General Assembly, That  
a tract of country, not exceeding ten miles square,  
orany lesser quaatity, to be located within the lim-  
its of thé state, and in any part thereof, as congress  
may, by law, direct, shall be, and the same is here-

soil, as of persons residing or to reside thereon,  
pursuant to the tenor and effect of the eight section  
of the first article of the government cf the Consti-  
tution of the United States.”  
  
But were there no provisos to these acts? The  
Maryland act had none. That part of the District  
therefore, which includes the cities of Washington  
and Georgetown has nothing with which to ward  
off the power of Congress. ‘The Virginia act had

living within the sound of the roar of  
the Atlantic surf. The centre of our  
sea-coast then fell between the Potomac  
and the Susquehanna; and the Potomac  
had this advantage, that its waters  
would float a navy. So, on the 16th of  
July, 1790, by a vote of thirty-two ayes  
to twenty-nine noes—only three major-  
ity—an Act was passed, entitled “An  
Act establishing the temporary and per-  
manent seat of government of the United  
States.” The “temporary’”’ gave the  
location to Philadelphia for ten years;  
the “permanent,” to the banks of the  
Potomac for all future time. Pennsyl-  
vania and Virginia each had their sugar-  
plum, but Virginia’s was decidedly the  
largest and sweetest. The first section  
provided “that a district of territory,  
not exceeding ten miles square, to be

being made to insert “ on the river Potomac at some place between the

buildings, President Washington appointed Thomas Johnson and David  
Carroll, of Maryland, and David Stuart, of Virginia, commissioners, under

Statement of the Case.  
  
Tue act of Maryland, entitled “An act to cede to Congress  
a district of ten miles square in this State for the seat of the  
Government of the United States,” 1788, c. 46, was in the  
following terms: “ Be it enacted by the General Assembly of  
Maryland, that the representatives of this State in the House  
of Representatives of the Congress of the United States,  
appointed to assemble at New York, on the first Wednesday  
of March next, be and they are hereby authorized and required,  
on behalf of this State, to cede to the Congress of the United  
States any district in this State, not exceeding ten miles square,  
which the Congress may fix upon and accept for the seat of  
Government of the United States.” (Kilty’s Laws of Mary-  
land.)  
  
On December 3, 1789, 13 Hening, c. 32, by an act entitled  
“An act for the cession of ten miles square, or any lesser  
quantity of territory within this State, to the United States,  
in Congress assembled, for the permanent seat of the General  
Government,” Virginia ceded to the Congress and Government

and it was declared that members would  
forego their election rather than go to  
a congress on its banks. Numbers of  
eastern adventures had gone to the  
southern states, and all had found their  
graves there. Mr. Madison declared  
the banks of the Susquehanna more un­  
healthy tnan those of the Potomac.  
Fisher Ames said that the gentleman  
from Virginia &quot;seemed to think that the  
banks of the Potomac a paradise and  
that river an Euphrates.&quot;  
The &quot;act for establishing the tempo­  
rary and permanent seat of the gov­  
ernment of the United States&quot; was ap­  
proved by President Washington on  
July 16, 1790. It provided for the loca­  
tion by the president of a district ten  
miles square on the river Potomac &quot;at  
some place between the mouth of the  
eastern branch and Conogochegue.&quot;  
Three commissioners were to purchase or  
accept lands and erect government build­  
ings prior to the first Monday in Decem­  
ber, 1800, when the seat of government  
should be transferred to this district and  
all offices should cease to be exercised  
elsewhere.
