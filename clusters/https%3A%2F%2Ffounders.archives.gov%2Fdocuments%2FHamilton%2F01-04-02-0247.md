er, that the constitution proposed by the convention contains, as well as the constitution of this state, a number of such provisions.  
Independent of those, which relate to the structure of the government, we find the following: Article I. section 3. clause 7. “Judgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honour, trust or profit under the United States; but the party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to indictment, trial, judgment and punishment, according to law.” Section 9. of the same article, clause 2. “The privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it.” Clause 3. “No bill of attainder or ex post facto law shall be passed.” Clause 7. “No title of nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no person holding any office of profit or trust under them, shall, without the consent of congress, accept of any present, emolument, office or title, of any kind whatever, from any king, prince or foreign state

ring the life of the person attainted.”  
It may well be a question whether these are not upon the whole, of equal importance with any which are to be found in the constitution of this state. The establishment of the writ of habeas corpus, the prohibition of ex post facto laws, and of TITLES OF NOBILITY, to which we have no corresponding provisions in our constitution, are perhaps greater securities to liberty and republicanism than any it contains. The creation of crimes after the commission of the fact, or in other words, the subjecting of men to punishment for things which, when they were done, were breaches of no law, and the practice of arbitrary imprisonments have been in all ages the favourite and most formidable instruments of tyranny. The observations of the judicious Blackstone  
  
Vide Blackstone’s Commentaries, vol. I, page 136.  
  
in reference to the latter, are well worthy of recital. “To bereave a man of life (says he) or by violence to confiscate his estate, without accusation or trial, would be so gross and notorious an act of despotism, as must at once convey the alarm of tyranny throughout the whole nation; but confinement of the person by secretly hurrying to goal, where his sufferings are unknown or forgotten, is a less public, a less striking, and therefore a more dangerous engine of arbitrary government.” And as a remedy for this fatal evil, he is every where peculiarly emphatical in his encomiums on the habeas corpus act, which in one place he calls “the BULWARK of the British constitution.”  
  
Idem, vol. 4, page 438.  
  
  
Nothing need be said to illustrate the importance of the prohibition of titles of nobility. This may truly be denominated the corner stone of republican government; for so long as they are excluded, there can never be serious danger that the government will be any other than that of the people.  
To the second, that is, to the pretended establishment of the common and statute law by the constitution, I answer, that they are expressly made subject “to such alterations and provisions as the legislature shall from time to time make concerning the same.” They are therefore at any moment liable to repeal by the ordinary legislative power, and of course have no constitutional sanction. The only use of the declaration was to recog

art of a declaration of rights, which under our constitutions must be intended as limitations of the power of the government itself.  
It has been several times truly remarked, that bills of rights are in their origin, stipulations between kings and their subjects, abridgments of prerogative in favor of privilege, reservations of rights not surrendered to the prince. Such was MAGNA CHARTA, obtained by the Barons, sword in hand, from king John. Such were the subsequent confirmations of that charter by subsequent princes. Such was the petition of right assented to by Charles the First, in the beginning of his reign. Such also was the declaration of right presented by the lords and commons to the prince of Orange in 1688, and afterwards thrown into the form of an act of parliament, called the bill of rights. It is evident, therefore, that according to their primitive signification, they have no application to constitutions professedly founded upon the power of the people, and executed by their immediate representatives and servants. Here, in strictness, the people surrender nothing, and as they retain every thing, they have no need of particular reservations. “WE THE PEOPLE of the United States, to secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this constitution for the United States of America.” Here is a better recognition of popular rights than volumes of those aphorisms which make the principal figure in several of our state bills of rights, and which would sound much better in a treatise of ethics than in a constitution of government.

e nation, than to a constitution which has the regulation of every species of personal and private concerns. If therefore the loud clamours against the plan of the convention on this score, are well founded, no epithets of reprobation will be too strong for the constitution of this state. But the truth is, that both of them contain all, which in relation to their objects, is reasonably to be desired.  
I go further, and affirm that bills of rights, in the sense and in the extent in which they are contended for, are not only unnecessary in the proposed constitution, but would even be dangerous. They would contain various exceptions to powers which are not granted; and on this very account, would afford a colourable pretext to claim more than were granted. For why declare that things shall not be done which there is no power to do? Why for instance, should it be said, that the liberty of the press shall not be restrained, when no power is given by which restrictions may be imposed? I will not contend that such a provision would confer a regulating power; but it is evident that it would furnish, to men disposed to usurp, a plausible pretence for claiming that power. They might urge with a semblance of reason, that the constitution ought not to be charged with the absurdity of providing against the abuse of an authority, which was not given, and that the provision against restraining the liberty of the press afforded a clear implication, that a power to prescribe proper regulations concerning it, was intended to be vested in the national government. This may serve as a specimen of the numerous handles which would be given to the doctrine of constructive powers, by the indulgence of an injudicious zeal for bills of rights.  
On the subject of the liberty of the press, as much has been said, I cannot forbear adding a remark or two: In the first place, I observe that there is not a syllable concerning it in the constitution of this state, and in the next, I contend that whatever has been said about it in that of any other state, amounts to nothing. What signifies a declaration that “the liberty of the press shall be inviolably preserved?” What is the liberty of the press? Who can give it any definition which would not leave the utmost latitude for evasion? I hold it to be impracticable; and from this, I infer, that its security, whatever fine declarations may be inserted in any constitution respecting it, must altogether depend on public opinion, and on the general spirit of the people and of the government.  
  
To show that there is a power in the constitution by which the liberty of the press may be affected, recourse has been had to the power of taxation. It is said that duties may be laid upon publications so high as to amount to a prohibition. I know not by what logic it could be maintained that the declarations in the state constitutions, in favour of the freedom of the press, would b

to be restrained.  
  
And here, after all, as intimated upon another occasion, must we seek for the only solid basis of all our rights.  
There remains but one other view of this matter to conclude the point. The truth is, after all the declamation we have heard, that the constitution is itself in every rational sense, and to every useful purpose, A BILL OF RIGHTS. The several bills of rights, in GreatBritain, form its constitution, and conversely the constitution of each state is its bill of rights. And the proposed constitution, if adopted, will be the bill of rights of the union. Is it one object of a bill of rights to declare and specify the political privileges of the citizens in the structure and administration of the government? This is done in the most ample and precise manner in the plan of the convention, comprehending various precautions for the public security, which are not to be found in any of the state constitutions. Is another object of a bill of rights to define certain immunities and modes of proceeding, which are relative to personal and private concerns? This we have seen has also been attended to, in a variety of cases, in the same plan. Adverting

be open to the people, in relation to the conduct of their representatives in the general government; and the impediments to a prompt communication which distance may be supposed to create, will be overballanced by the effects of the vigilance of the state governments. The executive and legislative bodies of each state will be so many centinels over the persons employed in every department of the national administration; and as it will be in their power to adopt and pursue a regular and effectual system of intelligence, they can never be at a loss to know the behaviour of those who represent their constituents in the national councils, and can readily communicate the same knowledge to the people. Their disposition to apprise the community of whatever may prejudice its interests from another quarter, may be relied upon, if it were only from the rivalship of power. And we may conclude with the fullest assurance, that the people, through that channel, will be better informed of the conduct of their national representatives, than they can be by any means they now possess of that of their state representatives.  
It ought also to be remembered, that the citizens who inhabit the country at and near the seat of government, will in all questions that affect the general liberty and prosperity, have the same interest with those who are at a distance; and that they will stand ready to sound the alarm when necessary, and to point out the actors in any pernicious project. The public papers will be expeditious messengers of intelligence to the most remote inhabitants of the union.

e provision respecting the debts due to the United States. This has been represented as a tacit relinquishment of those debts, and as a wicked contrivance to screen public defaulters. The newspapers have teemed with the most inflammatory railings on this head; and yet there is nothing clearer than that the suggestion is entirely void of foundation, and is the offspring of extreme ignorance or extreme dishonesty. In addition to the remarks I have made upon the subject in another place, I shall only observe, that as it is a plain dictate of common sense, so it is also an established doctrine of political law, that “States neither lose any of their rights, nor are discharged from any of their obligations by a change in the form of their civil government.

It is evident that the principal departments of the administration under the present government, are the same which will be required under the new. There are now a secretary at war, a secretary for foreign affairs, a secretary for domestic affairs, a board of treasury consisting of three persons, a treasurer, assistants, clerks, &amp;c. These offices are indispensable under any system, and will suffice under the new as well as under the old. As to ambassadors and other minist

member of the convention that framed it. Did these men, and  
many of those who acted together on both these occasions, mean  
one thing in 1779, and another in 1788, and yet use the same  
terms? What they originally meant by the freedom of the press  
has already been seen. ‘They unquestionably meant the same  
in the second instance.  
  
An objection to the constitution was founded on its want of a  
bill of rights ; and its adoption was strenuously opposed because  
it did not originally contain a declaration that the liberty of the  
press should be inviolably preserved. What answer was made  
to this objection by the authors of “‘ The Federalist’ — written  
by John Jay, James Madison, and Alexander Hamilton ?’—a  
work that was composed to remove objections, and induce the  
people to adopt that instrument as the national convention re-  
ported it. ‘They said nothing about the privilege of libelling, or  
the impunity that ought to be secured to libellers. In the eighty-  
fourth number of that work, it is said: “The security of the  
press, whatever fine declarations may be inserted in any consti-  
tution, must altogether depend on public opinion, and on the  
general spirit of the people and of the government. And here,  
after all, must we seek for the only solid basis of all our rights.”  
This single sentence is replete with the philosophy of all anterior  
political history, and is confirmed by the subsequent history of  
these United States.  
  
In the state conventions that discussed the national constitu-  
tion, the objection was in some instances raised, that the press  
was not secure—that it might be subjected to the control of a li

The history and the fate of the sedition law, strongly confirms  
Hamilton’s remarks, in that number of the Federalist from which  
we have already made a quotation. ‘“ Bills of rights,” said he,  
‘‘in the sense and to the extent they are contended for, are not  
only unnecessary in the proposed constitution, but would even  
be dangerous. ‘They would contain various exceptions to pow-  
ers not granted ; and, on this very account, would afford a co-  
lorable pretext to claim more than were granted. Why, for in-  
stance, should it be said that the liberty of the press shall not be  
restrained, when no power is given by which restrictions may be  
imposed? It is evident that it would furnish to men disposed to  
usurp, a plausible pretence for claiming that power.”

In the Constitution, as it was originally  
adopted, not a syllable is to be found in re-  
lation to the Liberty of the Press; nor was  
it necessary that it should have declared  
“the Liberty of the Press shall be inviola-

the Federalist it is a iked: — “What is the  
Liberty of the Press? Who can give it  
auy definition which would not leave the  
Utmost latitude for evasion? I hold it to be  
impracticable; and from this 1 infer, that  
its security, whatever fine declarations may  
be inserted in any constitution respecting  
it, must altogether demand on public opinion.  
and on the general spirit of the people and  
of the government.”

in No. 84 of the Federalist, &quot;The practice of  
arbitrary imprisonments has been in all ages the  
favorite, and most formidable instrument  
tyranny.&quot; Blackstone says, &quot;To bereave a  
man of life or by violence to confiscate his es  
tate without accusation or trial, would he so  
gross and notorious an act of despotiem as must  
at once convey the alarm of tyranny through­  
out the whole nation; but confinement of the  
person by secretly hurrying him to jail, where  
his sufferings are unknown or forgotten, is a less  
public, a less striking, and therefore a more  
dangerous engine of arbitrary government.&quot;  
In another place he speaks of the habeas cor  
pus act as the bulwark of the British Consti  
tution,&quot; because it affords a remedy for arbi­  
trary arrests and imprisonments.  
When I read history, recollecting that hu  
man nature is ever the same, and in the light  
of that view, the acts of Mr. Lincoln through  
less than two years of time, an involuntary  
fear seizes upon me--a shudder runs through  
my veins for the liberties of my countrymen.  
Eternal vigilence is the price of liberty. If  
these arbitrary imprisonments are right, bring  
them to the broad light of day, that their au­  
thors may be justified; if wrong, that the peo­  
ple may consider their remedies under the Con­  
atitutton. t

No. LXXXIV, pages 491-92,.of the Fed­  
erlist, he answers the objection against the  
than proposed Constitution of the United  
States, that it did not sufficiently guard  
the liberties of the citizen, and then says:  
“The establishment of the writ of ha­  
beas corpus1 the prohibition of ex post  
facto laws and of titles of nobility, to which  
we have no corresponding provision in  
our [New York] Constitution, are perhaps  
greater securities to liberty than any it  
contains. Tbe creation of crimes after  
the cosuDiaition of fact, or, in other  
words, tbe subjecting of men to punish­  
ment for things which, when they were  
done, ware breaches of no law, and tbe  
practice of arbitrary imprisonments, have  
been btfH ages tbe favorite and most form­  
idabialbHrntnents of tyranny. Tbe obser­  
vationoof the judicious Black :stone in ref- j  
erenee tb tbe tetter are well worthy of re­  
cital ; *To bereave a man of life,’ says he,  
*orby violence to confiscate bis estate w ith­  
out accusation or trial, would be so gross

ing him oflTto jail, where his sufferings arc  
unknown or forgotten, is a less public, a  
less striking, and therefore a more dan­

And as a remedy for this fatal evil, be is  
everywhere peculiarly emphatical in his  
encomiums on the habeas corpus act,  
which in one place he calls tbe bulwark  
of tbe British Constitution.&quot;  
That arbitrary imprisonment is the  
most “ dangerous engine” of tyranny, has  
never been questioned since Charles II.  
signed the habeas corpus act; yet in free,  
democratic America, a drunken Secretary  
boaeta to the world that by tbe tinkling  
of a bell he can have the best citizen of  
Ohio and New York arrested and impris­

limitations upon the power of Congress,  
and that the history of the constitution  
shows that in the adoption of these articles  
it was not file purpose of the people to en­  
large, but to restrain the power of Congress.

States contained no bill of rights, says : &quot;I  
affirm that bills of rights iu the sense and to  
the extent they are contended for are not

would contain various exceptions to powers  
not granted, and on this very account  
would afford a colorable pretext to claim  
more than _were granted; for why declare  
that things shall not he done which there is  
no power to do? Why, for instance, should  
it be said that the liberty of the press shall  
not bo restrained when no power is given  
by which restrictions may be imposed? I  
will not contend that such a provision will  
confer a regulating power, but it is evident  
it would afford to men disposed to us oaf a  
plausible pretense for claiming that Bower.&#x27;&#x27;

sequent confirmations ot that charter by suc-

Rights assented to by Charles the First in the

Declaration of Rights presented by the lords

It is evident, therefore, that, according to their

was unanimously rejected upon the ground that such a bill would con-  
tain various exceptions to powers not granted, and on this very ac-  
count would afford a pretext for asserting more than was granted.—  
(Lloyd’s Debates, 433, 437.) In the discussions before the people,  
when the adoption of the Constitution was pending, no objection was  
urged with greater effect than this absence of a bill of rights, and in  
one of the numbers of the Federalist, Mr. HAMILTON endeavored to  
combat the objection. After stating several reasons why such a bill  
was not necessary, he said: “I go further and affirm that bills of  
rights, in the sense and to the extent they are contended for, are not  
only unnecessary in the proposed Constitution, but would even be  
dangerous. They would contain various exceptions to powers not  
granted, and on this very account would afford a colorable pretext to  
claim more than were granted. For why declare that things shall  
not be done which there is no power to do? Why, for instance,  
should it be said that the liberty of the press shall not be restrained  
when no power is given by which restrictions may be imposed? I  
will not contend that such a provision would confer a regulating  
power, but it is evident that it would furnish to men disposed to usurp  
a plausible pretence for claiming that power. They might urge, with  
a semblance of reason, that the Constitution ought not to be charged  
with the absurdity of providing against the abuse of an authority  
which was not given, and that the provision against restraining the  
liberty of the press afforded a clear implication that a right to pre-  
scribe proper regulations concerning it was intended to be vested in  
the national government. This may serve as a specimen of the nu-  
merous handles which would be given to the doctrine of constructive
