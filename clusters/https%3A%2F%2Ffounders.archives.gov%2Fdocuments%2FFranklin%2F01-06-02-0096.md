Dear Katy  
Philadelphia Oct. 16. 1755  
Your Favour of the 28th of June came to hand but the 28th of September, just 3 Months after it was written. I had, two Weeks before, wrote you a long Chat, and sent it to the Care of your Brother Ward. I hear you are now in Boston, gay and lovely as usual. Let me give you some fatherly Advice. Kill no more Pigeons than you can eat. Be a good Girl, and don’t forget your Catechise. Go constantly to Meeting—or Church—till you get a good Husband; then stay at home, and nurse the Children, and live like a Christian. Spend your spare Hours, in sober Whisk, Prayers, or learning to cypher. You must practise Addition to your Husband’s Estate, by Industry and Frugality; Subtraction of all unnecessary Expences; Multiplication (I would gladly have taught you that myself, but you thought it was time enough, and wou’dn’t learn) he will soon make you a Mistress of it. As to Division, I say with Brother Paul, Let there be no Divisions among ye. But as your good Sister Hubbard (my Love to her) is well acquainted with The Rule of Two, I hope you will become as expert in the Rule of Three; that when I have again the Pleasure of seeing you, I may find you like my Grape Vine, surrounded with Clusters, plump, juicy, blushing, pretty little rogues, like their Mama. Adieu. The Bell rings, and I must go among the Grave ones, and talk Politicks. Your affectionate Friend

P.S. The Plums came safe, and were so sweet from the Cause you mention’d, that I could scarce taste the

PHILAdELPHIA, October 16, 1755,  
Dear haty--Your favor of the 28th June  
came to hand but the 23d September, just  
three months after it was written. I had two  
weeks before written you a long chat, and  
sent it to the care of your brother ward. I  
hear you are now in Boston, gay and lovely  
as usual. Let me give you some fatherly  
advice: Kill no more pigeons than you can  
eat.3e a good girl, and don&#x27;t foget your  
catechize; go constantly to meeting or church,  
till you get a good husband; then stay at home  
and nurse the children. Spend your spare  
hours in sober whist, prayers, or learning to  
cypher. You must practice addition to your  
husband&#x27;s estate by industry and frugality.  
Subtraction of all unnecessary expenses.  
Multiplication-he will soon make you master  
of it. As to division, I say, with brother  
Paul, &quot;Let there be no division among ye;&quot;  
but as your good sister Hubbard (my love to  
her) is well acquainted with the rule of two,  
I hope you will become so expert in the rule  
of three, that when I have again the pleaure  
of seeing you I may find you like my grape  
vine, surrounded with clusters, plump, juicy,  
blushing, pretty little, rogues, just like their  
mamma. Adieu--the bell rings, and I must

menths afier it was written. I had two weeks  
before written you a long chat and sent it to the  
care of your brother Ward.  
  
| I hear you are now  
| in Boston, gay and lovely as usual. Let me  
|| give you some fatherly advice: Kill no more pi-  
| geonsthan you can eat. Be a good girl, and  
don’t forget your catechize; go constantly to  
meeting, or church, till you get a good husband;  
then stay at home and nurse the children and  
live like a christian. Spend your spare hours  
in sober whist, prayers, or learning to cipher.  
You must practice addition to your husband’s  
estate by industry and frugality. Subtraction of  
all unnecessary expenses. Muliiplication—he  
will soon make you mistress of it. As to divis-  
ion, I say with brother Paul, “Let there be no  
division among ye;” but as your good sister  
| Hubbard, (ny love to her) is well acquainted  
with the rule of two, I hope you will become as  
| expert in the rule of three, that when I have  
again the pleasure of seeing you I may find you  
| like my grape vine, surrounded with clusters,  
plump, juicy, blushing, pretty little rog ics, just  
like their mamma. Adieu, the bell rings and I  
|| must go among the grave ones and talk politics.
