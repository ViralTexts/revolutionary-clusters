[New York, February 3, 1802]  
  
The Message observes that “in our care of the public contributions entrusted to our direction, it would be prudent to multiply barriers against the dissipation of public money, appropriating specific sums to every specific purpose, susceptible of definition; by disallowing all applications of money varying from the appropriation in object, or transcending it in amount by reducing the undefined field of contingencies, and thereby circumscribing discretionary powers over money, and by bringing back to a single department all accountabilities for money where the examination may be prompt, efficacious and uniform.” In this recommendation we can be at no loss to discover additional proof of a deliberate design in the present Chief Magistrate to arraign the former administrations. All these suggestions imply in them a former either negligent or defective attention to the object recommended; some of them go further and insinuate that there had been at least a departure from correct plans which had before been instituted. The censure intended to be conveyed is as unjust as the conceptions which have dictated it, are crude and chimerical. In all matters of this nature the question turns upon the proper boundaries of the precautions to be observed; how far they ought to go; where they should stop; how much is necessary for security and order; what qualifications of general rules are to be admitted to adapt them to practice, and to attain the ends of the public service. It is certainly possible to do too much as well as too little; to embarrass, if not defeat the good which may be done, by attempting more than is practicable; or to overbalance that good by evils accruing from an excess of regulation. Men of business know this to be the case in the ordinary affairs of life: how much more must it be so, in the extensive and complicated concerns of an Empire? To reach and not to pass the salutary medium is the province of sound judgment: To miss the point will ever be the lot of those who, enveloped all their lives in the mists of theory, are constantly seeking for an ideal perfection which never was and never will be attainable in reality. It is about this medium, not about general principles, that those in power in our government have differed; and to experience, not to the malevolent insinuations of rivals, must be the appeal, whether the one or the other description of persons have judged most accurately. Yet discerning men may form no imperfect opinion of the merits of the controversy between them, by even a cursory view of the distinctions on which it has turned.  
Nothing, for instance, is more just or proper than the position that the Legislature ought to appropriate specific sums, for specific purposes; but nothing is more wild or of more inconvenient tendency than to attempt to appropriate “a specific sum for each specific purpose, susceptible of definition;” as the Message preposterously recommends. Thus (to take a familiar example) in providing for the transportation of an army; oats and hay for the subsistence of horses, are each susceptible of a definition, and an estimate, and a precise sum may be appropriated for each seperately; yet in the operations of an army, it will often happen that more than a sufficient quantity of the one article may be obtained, and not a sufficient quantity of the other: If the appropriations be distinct, and the officer who is to make the provision be not at liberty to divert the fund from one of these objects to the other, (as the doctrine of the Message implies) the horses of the army may in such a case starve; and its movements be arrested—in some situations even the army itself may likewise be starved, by a failure of the means of transportation.  
If it be said that the inconvenience here suggested, may be avoided, by making the appropriations for forage, generally, and not for the items which compose it separately: The answer is, first, that this, by uniting and blending different things, susceptible each of a precise definition, is an abandonment of the principle of the Message; secondly, That it would be only a partial cure for the mischiefs incident to that rigorous principle. It might happen that the badness of roads would injure the waggons of the army more than was anticipated, and so much more as to exhaust the specific fund appropriated for their repairs; it might also have happened from various causes that at an earlier period of the campaign, the consumption of forage had been less than was calculated, so that there was a surplus of the fund destined for this object: If in such a case the public Agents could not transfer that surplus to the repairs of the waggons; here in like manner, the motions of the army might be suspended, and in the event famine and ruin produced.  
This analysis might be pursued, so as to prove that similar evils are inseparable, from a much more qualified application of the principle in the message, and so to demonstrate that nothing more can safely or reasonably be attempted, than to distribute the public expences, into a certain number of convenient sub-divisions or departments; to require from the proper officer estimates of the items, which are to compose each head of expence, and after examining these with due care, to adapt the appropriations to the respective aggregates; applying a specific sum to the amount of each great subdivision:—the pay of the army; military stores; quarter-master stores; &amp;c. &amp;c. This with even more detail than could well be executed, has been uniformly done, under the past administrations of the present Government, from the very beginning of its proceedings. More will in the experiment be found impracticable and injurious; especially in seasons and in situations, when the public service demands activity and exertion. In like manner, the former practice of the government, has corresponded with the rule, taken it its true and just sense, of “disallowing all applications of money, varying from the appropriation in object, or transcending it in amount.” It is confidently believed, that whoever shall allege or insinuate the contrary, may be challenged to point out the instance in which money has been issued from the Treasury for any purpose, which was not sanctioned by regular appropriation, or which exceeded the appropriated amount; or where there was an expenditure of money allowed, that was not strictly within the limits of such an appropriation; except indeed, upon the impracticable idea of minutely separating, and distinguishing the items, which form the aggregate of some general head of expenditure.  
  
It is likewise material, to have it well understood, that generally speaking, the distinction between the appropriations for different objects, can only be strictly observed at the Treasury itself; which can easily take care that more money shall not go out for any purpose, than is authorised by law; and can see that this money is fairly expended by the proper officer, in conformity with the general spirit of the appropriation prescribed by the law. But it is in most cases impossible for the officer, charged with a particular branch of the public service, to separate nicely, in the details of expenditure, the different funds which may have been placed in his hands. Thus, (still drawing our examples from the military department, where the danger of misapplication is always the greatest) if several sums be placed in the hands of the Quarter-Master General, for different objects, he must of necessity, distribute a large proportion of them among his principal deputies, and these again among subordinate agents. Unless this distribution be pursued through the remotest ramifications, down to the moment of final expenditure, it is evident that it must fail throughout; and it is no less evident that it cannot be so far pursued. The mere accountantship would be an insuperable obstacle; it would require in every the most inferior agent, a profound knowledge of accounts, and would impose both on principals and subordinates the duty of keeping such a multiplicity of accounts, as, if even practicable, would exhaust the funds issued for the public service, in mere clerkship. Another most mischievous consequence would ensue. The exigencies of the public service are often so variable, that a public agent would frequently find himself full-handed for one purpose; empty-handed for another, and if forbidden to make a transfer, not only the service would suffer, but an opportunity, with very strong temptation, would be given to traffic with the public money for private gain: while the business of the government would be stagnated by the injudicious and absurd impediments of an overdriven strictness. Happily it is not very material that the principle of distinct appropriations for separate objects should be carried through all the details. The essential ends of it are answered, if it be strictly pursued, in the issuing of money from the treasury; and if this department be careful that the principal lines of discrimination are not transgressed.  
  
The theory of the message plainly contemplates, that in no case shall the actual money appertaining to one fund, be expended for the purpose of another; though each fund may be sufficient for its object, and though there may be an appropriature for each object. This is another excess of theory; which with a full treasury would often disable the Government, from fulfilling its engagements, and from carrying on the public businness. To execute this plan consistently with the exigencies of national expenditure, would probably require, in ordinary, a triplication of the revenues, or a capital necessary for the whole amount of that expenditure, and would very often lock up from circulation, large sums, which might be of great importance to the activity of trade and industry. Such are the endless blessings to be expected from the notable schemes of a Philosophic projector! strict to a fault, where relaxation is necessary; lax to a vice where strictness is essential!  
As to “reducing the undefined field of contingencies, and circumscribing discretionary powers over money,” observations similar to those which have been already made, occur. The term reducing, implies that the thing must have already existed in a degree; and indeed it is manifest, that all the minute casualties of expenditure, especially in the naval and military departments, cannot be forseen and defined. The question then must be, has not the limit been sufficiently narrow for the situation of the Government, in the scenes through which it has passed; comprehending for a great part of the time Indian wars and foreign hostilities? Certainly, if viewed on a proportionable scale, the extent appears to have been as moderate as could have been desired; and no blame can justly attach to the administration on this account.  
As to “bringing back to a single department all accountabilities for money,” there never has been a deviation from that system. The Department of the Treasury has uniformly preserved a vigilant superintendance over all accountabilities for public money. A particular accountant indeed has been appointed in the War and Navy Departments, but he has been subordinate to the Treasury Department, which has prescribed regulations for his conduct, and has constantly revised his proceedings. It is true, that by his connection with the particular department for which he is accountant, there are cases in which he is to be guided by the directions of the Head of that Department; but though these directions, if not plainly contrary to the rules prescribed by the Treasury, would exempt him from responsibility, the directions themselves pass under the review of the treasury, as a check upon the head of the department to which he is attached; and in cases of abuse, they would serve to establish a responsibility of the principal. To say, that this interferes with a prompt examination of accounts, is to affirm, that a division of labor is injurious to dispatch; a position contrary to all experience. The fact, without doubt, is, that it contributes essentially to dispatch: and that whatever new modification may be adopted, either the accounts of the other departments will never keep pace with the current of business in times of activity, or that modification must adhere to the principle of employing distinct organs.  
If it be the design to exclude, in every case, the intervention of the head of the particular department, some or all of these evils will follow: The service of that department will suffer, by unduly restricting its head, in cases in which he must be the most competent judge, and by obliging him, in order to avoid eventual difficulties, to resort, in the first instance, to another department, less alive than himself to the exigencies of his own, for a cautious and slow, perhaps a reluctant acquiescence in arrangements which require promptness; if, in the spirit of confidence and accommodation, the officers of the treasury yield a ready compliance with the wishes of the head of such department, they may inadvertently co-operate in measures which they would have disapproved and corrected on a deliberate and impartial revision. If this spirit be not shewn, not only the immediate service of the department may be improperly impeded, but sensations, unfriendly to the due harmony of the different members of the administration, may be engendered. Collusion stands on one, discord on the other side of the dilemma.  
The existing plan steers a middle and a prudent course; neither fettering too much the heads of the other departments, nor relinquishing too far the requisite controul of the treasury. Its opposite supposes all trust may be placed in one department—none in the others. The extravagant jealousy of the overbearing influence of the treasury department, which was so conspicuous in the times of the two former secretaries, has of a sudden given way to unlimited confidence! The intention seems to be to surround the brow of their immaculate successor, with the collected rays of legislative and executive favor. But vain will be the attempt to add lustre to the dim luminary of a benighted administration!

tions of rivals, must be the appeal, whether the  
one or the other description of persons have judg-  
ed most accurately. Yet discerning men may  
form no imperfect opinion of the merits of the  
controversy between them, by even a cursory view  
of the distinctions on which it has turned.  
  
Nothing, for instance, is more just or proper  
than the position, that the legislature ought to  
appropriate specific sums, for specific purposes ;  
but nothing is more wild or ef more inconvenient  
tendency than to attempt to appropriate “ a spe-  
cific sum for each specific purpose, susceptible of  
definition ;” as the Message preposterously recom-  
mends. Thus (to take a familiar example) in pro-  
viding for the transportation of an army ; oats and  
hay for the subsistence of horses, are each suscep-  
tible of a definition, and an estimate, and a pre-  
cise sum may be appropriated for each separate-  
ly; yetin the operations of an army, it will often  
happen that more than a sufficient quantity of the  
one article may be obtained, and not a sufficient  
quantity of the other. If the appropriations be  
distinct, and the officer who is to make the provi-  
sion be not at liberty to divert the fund from one  
of these objects to the other (as the doctrine of  
the Message implies), the horses of the army may  
in such a case starve; and its movements be ar-  
rested—in some situations even the army itself  
may likewise be starved, by a failure of the means  
of transportation.  
  
If it be said, that the inconvenience here sug-  
gested, may be avoided, by making the appropri-  
ations for forage, generally, and not for the items  
which compose it separately: The answer is,  
first, that this, by uniting and blending different  
things, susceptible each of a precise definition, is  
an abandonment of the principle of the Mes-  
sage ; secondly, That it would be only a partial  
cure for the mischiefs incident to that rigorous  
principle. It might happen that the badness of  
roads would injure the waggons of the army more  
than was anticipated, and so much more as to ex-  
haust the specific fund appropriated for their re-  
pairs; it might also have happened from various  
causes that at an earlier period of the campaign,  
the consumption of forage had been less than was  
calculated, so that there was a surplus of the fund  
destined for this object: If in such acase the pub-  
lic agent could not transfer that surplus to the re-  
pairs of the waggons; here in like manner, the  
motions of the army might be suspended, and in  
the event famine and ruin produced.  
  
This analysis might be pursued, so as to prove  
that similar evils are inseparable, from a much  
more qualified application of the principle in the  
message, and so to demonstrate that nothing more  
can safely or reasonably be attempted, than to dis-  
tribute the public expenses, into a certain number  
of convenient subdivisions or departments; to  
require from the proper officers, estimates of the  
items, which are to compose each head of expense,  
and after examining these with due care, to adapt  
the appropriations to the respective aggregates ;  
applying a specific sum to the amount of each  
great subdivision :—the pay of the army ; military  
stores; quarter-masters’ stores, kc. &amp;c. This,  
with even more detail than could well be execut-  
ed, has been uniformly done, under the past ad-  
ministrations of the present government, from  
the very beginning of its proceedings. More will  
in the experiment be found impracticable and in-  
jurious ; especially in seasons and in situations,  
  
when the public service demands activity and ex-  
  
ertion. In like manner, the former practice of  
the government, has corresponded with the rule,  
taken in its true and just sense, of “ disallowing  
all applications of money, varying from the ap-  
propriation inobject, or transcending it in amount.”  
It is confidently believed, that whoever shall al-  
lege or insinuate the contrary, may be challenged  
to point out the instance in which money has been  
  
  
  
53  
  
issued from the treasury for any purpose, which  
was not sanctioned by regular appropriation, or  
which exceeded the appropriated amount ; or where  
there was an expenditure of money allowed, that  
was not strictly within the limits of such an appro-  
priation ; except indeed, upon the impracticable  
idea of minutely separating, and distinguishing the  
items which form the aggregate of some general  
head of expenditure.  
  
It is likewise material, to have it well under-  
stood, that generally speaking, the distinction be-  
tween the appropriations for different objects, can  
only be strictly observed at the treasury itself;  
which can easily take care that more money shall  
not go out for any purpose, than is authorized by  
law; and can see that this money is fairly ex-  
pended by the proper officer, in conformity with  
the general spirit of the appropriation prescribed  
by the law. Butit isin most cases impossible for  
the officer, charge@ with a particular branch of  
the public service, to separate nicely, in the de-  
tails of expenditure, the different funds which may  
have been placed in his hands. Thus, still  
drawing our examples from the military depart-  
ment, where the danger of misapplication is al-  
ways the greatest) if several sums be placed in  
the hands of the quarter-master general, for dif-  
ferent objects, he must of necessity, distribute a  
large proportion of them among his principal de-  
puties, and these again among subordinate agents. ,  
Unless this distribution be pursued through the:  
remotest ramifications, down to the moment of  
final expenditure, it is evident that it must fail  
throughout; and it is no less evident that it can-  
not be so far pursued. The mere accountantship  
would be an insuperable obstacle ; it would re-  
quire in every the most inferior agent, a profound  
knowledge of accounts, and would impose both  
on principals and subordinates the duty of keep-  
ing such a multiplicity of accounts, as, if even  
practicable, would exhaust the funds. issued for  
the public service, in mere clerkship. Another  
most mischievous consequence would ensue. The  
exigencies of the public service are often so vari-  
able, that a public agent would frequently find him-  
self full-handed for one purpose ; empty-handed  
for another, and if forbidden to make a transfer,  
not only the service would suffer, but an oppor-  
tunity, with very strong temptation, would be giv-  
en to traffic with the public money for private  
gain: while the business of the government would  
be stagnated by the injudicious and absurd impedi-  
ments of an over-driven strictness. Happily it is  
not very material that the principle of distinct ap-  
propriations for separate objects should be carried  
through all the details. The essential ends of it  
are answered, if-it be strictly pursued, in the is-  
suing of money from the treasury; and if this  
department be careful that the principle lines of  
discrimination are not transgressed.  
  
The theory of the Message plainly contem-  
plates, that in no case shall the actual money ap-  
pertaining to one fund, be expended for the pur-  
pose of another ; though each fund may be suffi-  
cient for its object, and though there may be an  
appropriature for each object. This is another ex-  
cess of theory ; which with a full treasury would  
often disable the government, from fulfilling its  
engagements, and from carrying on the public bu-  
siness. To execute this plan consistently with  
exigencies of national expenditure, would proba-  
bly require, in ordinary, a triplication of the re-  
venue, ora capital necessary for the whole amount  
of that expenditure, and would very often lock  
up from circulation, large sums, which might be  
of great importance to the activity of trade and  
industry. Such are the endless blessings to be  
expected from the notable schemes of a philoso-  
phic projector! strict to a fault, where relaxation  
isnecessary ; laxtoa vice, where strictness is es-  
sential !

Asto “ reducing the undefined field of contin-  
gencivs, and circumscribing discretionary powers

have been already made, occur. The term re-  
ducing, implies that the thing must have already

that all the minute casualities of expenditure, espe-  
éially in the naval and military departments, can-

to be guided by the directions of the head of  
that department ; but though these directions, if  
not plainly contrary to the rules prescribed by the  
treasury, would exempt him from responsibility,  
the directions themselves pass under the review  
of the treasury, as a check upon the head of the  
department to which he is attached; and in cases  
of abuse, they would serve to establish a responsi-  
bility of the principal. To say, that this inter-

affirm, that a division of labour is injurious to  
dispatch ; a position contrary to all experience.  
The fact, without doubt, is, that it contributes es-

HE Meffage obferves that “in our care  
  
of the public contributions entrufted  
  
to our direction, it would be prudent to mul-  
tiply barriers againft the diffipation of public  
money, appropriating {pecific furns to cvery  
{pecific purpofe, /ufceptible of defination ;  
by difallowing all applications of money-va-  
rying from the appropriation in object, or tran-  
fcending it in amount, by reducing the unde-  
fined field of contingencies, and thereby cir-  
cumfcribing difcretionary power over mon-  
ey, and by bringing back toa {ingle depart-  
ment all accountabilities for money where the  
examination may be prompt, eflicacious and  
uniform.” In this recommendation we can  
be at no lofs to difcover additonal proof ot  
a deliberate defign in the prefent Chief Ma-  
  
| giftrate to arraign the former adminiftrations.  
  
All thefe fuggettions imply in them a former  
either negligent or defeétive attention to the  
obje&amp;ts recommended ; fome of them go  
further and infinuate that there had been at  
leaft a departure from corre¢t plans which  
had before been inflituted. The cenfure in-  
tended to be conveyed is as unjuft as the  
conceptions which have dittated it, are crude  
and chimerica]. In all matters of this nature  
the queftion turns upon the proper bounda-  
ries of the precautions to be obferved ; how  
tar they ought to go; where they fhould  
fiop; how much is neceffary for fecwrity,  
and order; what qualifications of general  
rules are to be admitted to adapt them to  
pra€tice, and to attain the ends of the public  
fervice. It is certainly poflible to do too  
much as well as too little ; to -embar-  
rafs, if not defeat the good which may be  
done, by attempting more than is pra€licable ;  
or to overbalance that good by evils accruing  
from an excefs of regulation, Men of bufi-  
ne{fs know this to be the cafe in the ordinary  
affairs of lite ; how much more mutt it be fo,  
in the extenfive and complicated concerns of  
an Empire? To reach and not to pafs the  
falutary medium is the province of found  
judgment : To mifs the point will ever be  
the lot of thofe who, enveloped ail their lives  
in the mifts of theory, are conftantly feeking  
for an ideal perfection which never was and  
uever will be attainable in reality. It %«

about this medium, not about general princi-  
cee that thofe in power in our government  
}  
  
ave differed; and to experience, not to the  
malevolent ‘nfinuations of rivals; muft be the  
appeal, whether the one or the other defcrip-  
tion of perfons have judged moft accurately.  
  
Yet difcerning men may form no imperfeét  
opinion of the merits of the controv erfy be-  
  
tween them, by even a curfory view of the  
diftinctions on which it has turned,  
  
Nothing, for inflance, is-more juft or prop-  
er than the pofition that the Legiilature ought  
to appropriate fpecific fums, for {pecific pur-  
pofes ; ; but nothing is more wild or of more  
  
snésnvenieniten: lency than to attempt to ap-  
propriate ‘a fpecific {um for each fpecific  
purpofe, /u/ceptible of definition,” as the  
Meffage prepolteroufly recommends. Thus  
(to take a familiar example) in providing for  
the tranfportation of an army ; eats and hay  
for the fubfiftence of horfes, are each fufcep-  
tible of a definition, and an eftimate, and a  
precife fum may be appropriated, for cach  
fepar ately ; yet in the operations of an army,  
it will often happen that more than a fufh-  
cient quantity of the one article may be ob-  
tained and not a fufficient quantity of the oth-  
er: If the appropriations be diftinét, andthe  
officer who is to make the provifion be not at  
liberty to divert the fund from one of thefe  
efts to the a) (as the dotirine ot the  
  
the horfes of the army may

itfelt may likewile be ftarved, by a failure of  
  
the means of ttanfportation. Ii it be faid  
that the inconv ‘shie nce here fuggelted, may  
be avoided, by making the appropriations  
for for. ige, ger nerally, ‘ana not for the items  
which compole it feparately : The anfwer 1s,  
fir, that this, by 1 wading and blending dif-  
fe; rent things, fufceptible each of a  
  
precife  
def  
  
inition, is an abando pone of the princt-  
ple of the Melfiage; fecondly, That it would  
be fhe a wartial crre for she mifchiefs inci-  
  
dent to that rigorous principle. It might  
happen that the bad Inefs of roads would 1 injure  
the waggons of the army more than was anti-  
cipated, and fo much more as to exhauft the  
fpecific fund appropriated for their repairs ;  
  
it might alfo have happened from various  
caufes that at an earlier pe riod of the campaign,  
the confumption of forage had been lefs than  
was calculated, fo that there*was a furplus ot  
the fund deflined for this objet: If in fuch  
a cafe the public Agent could not transfer  
that furplus to the repairs of the waggons ;  
here in like manner, the motions of the army  
might be fufpended, and in the event famine  
and ruin produced,  
  
This analyfis might be purfued, fo as to  
prove that fimilar evils are infeparable from  
a much more qualified application of the prin-  
ciple in the meffage, and fo to demonttrate  
that nothing more can fafely or reafonably be  
attempted, than to diftribute the nublic ex-  
pences, into a certain number of convenient  
fub-divifions or departments; to require from

which are to compofe each head of&#x27;ex pence,  
and after examining thefe with due care, to  
adapt the appropriations to the refpedtive ag-  
gregates ; applying a fpecific fum to the  
amount of each great fub-divifion :—the pay  
of the army ; military ftores ; quarter-mafter  
ftores ; &amp;c. &amp;c. This with even more de-  
tail than could well be executed, has been  
uniformly done, under the paft adminiftra-  
tions of the prefent government, from the very  
beginning of its proceedings. More will in  
the experiment be found impracticable and  
injurioys ; ; elpecially in feafons and in fitua-  
tions, whet the public fervice demands ac-  
tivity and exertion. In like manner,. the  
former praétice of the government, has cor-  
refponded with the rule, taken in its true and  
  
juft fenfe, of ‘* difallowing all applications of  
  
money, varying from the appropriation In  
objeét, or tranfcending it in amount. It is  
confidently believed, that whoever fhall al-  
ledge or infinuate the contrary, 4 be chal-  
lenged to point out the inftay in which  
money has been iffued from the Treafury for  
any purpofe \ which was not fanétioned by  
regular appropriations, or which exceeded  
the appropriated amount; or where there  
was an expenditure of money allowed, that  
was not ftriét!y within the limits of fuch an  
appropriation ; except indeed, upon the im.  
pra€itcabl e idea of minutely feparating, and  
diftinguifhi ing the items which form the ag-  
gregate of fome general h read of expenditure.  
It is Itkewile material, to have it well un-  
derf{lood, that generally {pe aking, the diflinc-  
tion between the appropriations tor different  
objeéts, can only be firict!y obferved at the  
Treafury itfelf; which can eafily take care  
that more money fhall not go out for any  
purpofe, than is authorifed by law ; and can  
fee tat this money is fairly expended b ry the  
proper ofhcer, in conformity w th the gener-  
al {pirit of the appropri jation pre {cribed by  
the law. But it 1s in moft cafes impoffible  
paitic: ila  
branch of the publie fervice, to feparate nice-  
ly, in the details of expenditure, the different  
  
funds which may have been placed in his |

EXAMINATION  
OF THE PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE.  
NUMBER Xi. Conc&#x27;uded,  
The theory of the Meffage plainly con-  
  
templates, that in no cafe fhall the adfual  
  
ed forthe purpofe of another ; though each  
fund may be fufficient for its obje&amp;, and tho’  
there may be an appropriature for each ob-  
je&amp;t. This is another excefs of theory ;  
which with a full trea/ury would often d:fa-  
ble the Government, trom fulfilling its en-  
  
  
  
&#x27;  
  
gagements, and trom carrying on the public  
bufinefs. To execute this plan confiftently  
with exigences of national expenditure,  
would probably require, in ordinary, a tripli-  
cation of the revenue, or a capital neceflary  
&#x27;for the whole amount of that expenditure,  
‘and would very often lock up from circula-  
ition, large fums, which mig&#x27;t be of great  
  
patsy to the aétivity of trade and in-  
  
duftry. Such are the endlefs bleffings to be  
| expeéted trom the notable {chemes of a Phi-  
  
‘ lofophic projector! ftriét to a fault, where  
  
relaxation is necefJary ; lax to a vice where  
| ftricinefs is effential.  
| As to “reducing the undefined field of  
contingencies, and circumfcribing difcre-  
tionary powers over money,” obfervations  
fimilar to thofe which have been already made,  
occur. The term reduciag, implies that the  
thing muft have already exifted ina degreeg  
and indeed it is maniteft, that all the minute  
cafualties of expenditure, efpecially in the  
‘naval and military departments, cannot be  
forfeen and defined. The queftion then muft  
be, has not the limit been fufficiently narrow  
for the fituation of the Government, in the  
feenes through which it has paffed; com-  
prehending for a great part ef the time In-  
dian wars and foreign hoftilities ? Certainly,  
if viewed on a proportionable feale, the extent  
appears to have been as moderate as could  
have been defired ; and no blame can juitly  
attach to the adminiftration on this account.  
As to ‘bringing back toa {ingle depart-  
ment all accountabilities for money,’ there  
never has been a deviation from that fyftem.  
The Department of the Treafury has uni-  
formly preferved a vigilant fuperentendance  
over all accountabilities for public money.  
A particular accountant indeed has been  
  
  
  
appointed in the War and Navy. Depart-

regulations for his conduét, and has conftantly |  
  
revifed his proceedings. It is true, that by  
his conneétion with the particular depart-  
ment for which he is accountant, there are  
cafes in which he is to be guided by the direc-  
tions of the Head of that Department; but  
though thefe direétions, if not plainly con-  
trary to the rules prefcribed by the Treafury,  
would exempt him from refponfibility, the  
direGtions themfelves pafs under the review  
of the treafury, as a check upon the head of  
the department to which hers attached ; and  
in cafes of abule, they would ferve to eftab-  
lith arefponfibility of the principal. To fay,  
that this interferes with a prompt examina-  
tion of accounts, is toaffirm, that a divifion  
of labor is injurious to difpatch; a pofition  
contrary to all experiznce. The faét, with-  
out doubt, is, that it contributes effeniially to  
difpatch: and that whatever new modifica-  
tion may be adopted, either the accounts of  
the other departments will never keep pe  
with the current of bufinefs in times of aéti-  
vity, or that modification muft adhere to the  
principle of employing diftin€&amp; organs.  
  
If it be the defign to exclude, in every cafe,  
the intervention of the head of the particular  
department, fome or all of thefe evils will tol-  
low: The fervice of that department will fut-  
fer, by unduly reftri€ting its head, in cafes in  
which he muft bethe moft competent judge,  
  
  
  
and by obliging him, in order to avoid event-  
ual difficulties, to refort, in the firft inftance,  
to another department, lefs alive than himfelf  
to the exigencies of his own, for a cautious  
and flow, perhaps a reluctant acquiefcence in  
arrangements which require promptnefs ; 1f, |  
in the fpirit of confidence and accommoda-  
tion, the officers of the treafury yield a ready  
compitance with the wifhes of the head of  
fuch department, they may madvertently co-  
operate in meafures which they would have  
dufapproved and corre¢ted on a deliberate and  
impartial revifion. If this fpirit be not  
ihewa, not only the immediate fervice of the  
department may be improperly impeded, luit  
fenfations, untriendly to the due harmony of  
the different members otf the adminiftration,  
may be enge.Mered. Collufion ftands on  
one, difcord on the other fide of the dilemma.  
Tie exifting plan fteers a middle anda pru-  
dent courfe; neither fettering too much the}  
heads of the other departments, ner relin-  
quifhing too far the requifite controul of the  
treafury. Its oppofite fuppofes all truft may |  
e placed in one department—none in the |  
others. The extravagant jealoufy of the |  
overbearing influence of the treafury depart- |  
ment, which was fo confpicuous in the times  
the two ot former fecretaries, has of a fudden  
given way to unlimited confidence! The  
intention feems to be to furround the brow  
oftheir immaculate fucceffor, with the col-  
Je&amp;ted rays of legiflative and executive faver.

canfeetbM this money is fairly expended bytne  
proper effiver, m conformity with the general fpir­  
it ot the appiopriation prelcribcd by the law. But  
it is in motl cafe* impcflibk for the officer, charg­  
ed with a particular branch of the public fervice,  
to fipoate nicely, in the details of expenditure,  
the d flerent funds which may have betn placed in  
h a hands. Thus, ((till drawing our examples  
from the military department, where the danger  
• of mifapplication is always the greateft) if fev­  
»ml turns be placed in the hands of the Qnaitcr  
Matter Geneial, for different objects, he mutt ct  
rrccttity, dirtubute a Urge proportion of them a  
mong his principal deputies, and thel’e aga-o among  
fub&gt;tdictate agents. U niffs chit diArihution be  
pur feed throuch theremoteft ramifications, down  
to the moment of final expenditure, it is evident  
that it mutt fail throughout ; and it is no lets evi­  
dent that it cannot be to far purfued. Thcmeie  
accoui untfhip would be an iniuperabk obftacle;  
it would require in every the mod inferior agent,  
a profound knowledge of account?, and would im  
p-ofc both on principals and fubordiuatea the duty  
of ketping fuch a multipicity of accounts, as if ev­  
en practicable, would exhault the funds iflued for  
the public krvice, in mere ckrklhip. Ai other  
iroft mifchievous confequence would erfue.  
The exigencies ot the public fervice are often fo  
. variable, that a bup’ic ageot would frequently find  
himttlr full-handed for one purpofe; empty-hard,  
ed tor another, and it tor bidden to make atrznster­  
rot only the fervice would lufler, but an opportuni­  
ty, with very ftrong temptation, would he giver, to  
- trafic with the public money for private gam;  
While the bufinef- ci6jvfri i;ient would be flatt­  
ed by the injudicious and abturd impediments of au  
over driven Imettnefs. Happily it is nut very material  
that the principle of dilliodt appropriation* for lepa­  
rate objects Ihouid be carried through all the* details.

in no cafe fhaH the actual mc»ey apperta uing to ore

**ch fund may be lufficirnt lor it* objedk, and though  
there may be an appropriatute foi each object, i t*is  
is another txcds&#x27;ol theory ; which with a fail ireafutj

Asjto “ i educing the undefined field of contingencies, !  
and circumjcritung dilcretionary powers over money,”  
obfervation* fimilar to thole which have been already  
made, occur. The term reducing, implies that the thing  
rnoft have already exifted n a degree ; and indeed it  
is manifeil. that all the minute cafualitie* of expendi­  
ture. efpecia ly in the naval and military departments,  
cannot be foicfeen and defined. The queftion then  
mult be has uot the limit been lufficientlv narrow for  
the fituaitOn of the Government, in the fetors through  
which it ha« palled ,* comprehending for a great part  
of the time Indian wars and foreign hoftmties ? Cer­  
tainly, if viewed on a proportlorabk lca.e, the extent  
appears to have been as moderate as could have been  
defined ; ar.d no blame «an jullly attach to the adminif.  
tration on thisaceouut.  
As to “ krmgrrg kuk to a finglc department all ac­  
countabilities lor Barney,” there never libs been a de­  
viation from that fvrtcm. 1 he Dc par&#x27;merit ot the  
Treafury has uniformly preferved a vigilant foperm­  
tcndauce over aft accountabilities for public money. —  
A particular accountant indeed has been appointed in  
ehc War and Navy Departments, but he has bccu  
fubordiuate to the Treafury Department, which has  
prefcribcd regulations for h&gt;» conduct, and has con*  
ftant.y reviled his proceedings. It is true, that by his  
connection with the particular department for which  
he is accountant, there are cafes in which he is to be  
guided by the directions of the Head of that depart­  
ment ; but though the fie directions, it not plainly con­  
  
• jury iu me iu cs piwiiwcu me i ud:ury, would j  
exempt him from relponGbility. the directions them­  
&#x27; felves psf* under the review of the realury ar a check  
upon the head of the department to which he is at­  
tached ; and in cafe of abufe, they would fetve to ef­  
tabliih a refpocGbility of the principal. To fay, that  
this interferes with a prompt examination of accounts,  
is to affirm that a divifion cf lat or i» injurious to dif.  
patch : a pofition contrary \m all experience. The  
fadl, without doubt, is that it contributes efientially to  
difpatch arm that whatever new modification may be  
adopted, tither the accounts of the other departments  
will never keep pare with the current of buGnefs in  
times of aCliviry, or that modification rnuft adhere to  
the principle of employing d (find organs.  
If it be the deGgn to exclude, iu every cafe, the in­  
tervention of the head of the partcular department,  
fomc or all of thefe evils will fo low .* The fcrvice of that  
department will fuffer, by unduly fellridling its head,  
in cafes in which he mud be the moil competent judge,  
and by obliging him, in order to avoid cvertuai diffi­  
culties, to refort, in the Grff in fiance, to another de­  
gartin-nt, lefs alive than himfelf to the exigencies of  
ts own, for a cautious and flow, perhaps a reluclxnt  
actjniefcence in arangementt which require prompt,  
ntfs ; if, in the fpint of confidence and accommodation,  
the officers of the trealury yield a ready compliance  
with the withes of the head of fttfh department, they  
way inadvertently co-operate in mcifures which they  
would have difapproved and corredled on a deliberate  
and impartial revsfion. If this fpirit be not ihewn, not  
only the immediate iervice of the department may be  
improperly impeded, put fenations, unfriendly to the  
due harmony of the different members of the adromif.  
ttation, may be engendered. CotfuGoo ttands ou one,  
difeord on the other fide of the dilemma.  
The ending p’ao fleers a middle and a prudent  
courfe; neither fettering too much the heads of the  
Other departments, nor rrlinquifhitig too far the requi­  
re controui of the treafury. Its oppoGte fuppotes all  
truft m#y be placed in in one department, ni ne in the  
&#x27; others. The extravagant jrtloufy of the overbearing  
inliuence of the treafury department, which was fo  
ronfpieuous in lh^ times of the two former fccretaries,  
has of a fuiior n given way to an un imited confidence !  
The intention Term* to huround the brow of their  
aWhaculatr »1 «r with th: collcilrd rays
