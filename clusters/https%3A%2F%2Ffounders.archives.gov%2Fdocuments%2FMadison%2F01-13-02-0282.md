he House on 1 February proceeded to the question on the passage of the bill. Smith (South Carolina), protesting that the bill had been “taken up rather unexpectedly yesterday,” moved that it be recommitted to the Committee of the Whole for the purpose of making amendments. Laurance and Gerry declared that those who wished to make changes should have brought them forward the previous day. JM replied “that at this moment it was not of importance to determine how it has happened that the objections which several gentlemen now say they have to offer, against the bill—were not made at the proper time—it is sufficient for them if the candor of the house should lead them now to recommit the bill, that in a committee of the whole they may have an opportunity to offer their objections.” Ames remarked that it was “absurd to go into a committee of the whole to determine whether the bill is constitutional or not,” but JM insisted that “there was the greatest propriety in discussing a constitutional question in the committee of the whole.” The motion for recommitment was defeated, 34 to 23, and the main question was resumed on 2 February (Gazette of the U.S., 2 and 19 Feb. 1791; Gen. Advertiser, 5 Feb. 1791).  
  
  
  
Mr. Madison began with a general review of the advantages and disadvantages of banks. The former he stated to consist in, first, the aids they afford to merchants who can thereby push their mercantile operations farther with the same capital. 2d. The aids to merchants in paying punctually the customs. 3d. Aids to the government in complying punctually with its engagements, when deficiencies or delays happen in the revenue. 4th. In diminishing usury. 5th. In saving the wear of the gold and silver kept in the vaults, and represented by notes. 6th. In facilitating occasional remittances from different places where notes happen to circulate. The effect of the proposed bank, in raising the value of stock, he thought, had been greatly overrated. It would no doubt raise that of the stock subscribed into the bank; but could have little effect on stock in general, as the interest on it would remain the same, and the quantity taken out of the market would be replaced by bank stock.  
The principal disadvantages consisted in, 1st. banishing the precious metals, by substituting another medium to perform their office: This effect was inevitable. It was admitted by the most enlightened patrons of banks, particularly by Smith on the Wealth of Nations. The common answer to the objection was, that the money banished was only an exchange for something equally valuable that would be imported in return. He admitted the weight of this observation in general, but doubted whether, in the present habits of this country, the returns would not be in articles of no permanent use to it. 2d. Exposing the public and individuals to all the evils of a run on the bank, which would be particularly calamitous in so great a country as this, and might happen from various causes, as false rumours, bad management of the institution, an unfavorable balance of trade from short crops, &amp;c.  
It was proper to be considered also, that the most important of the advantages would be better obtained by several banks properly distributed, than by a single one. The aids to commerce could only be afforded at or very near the seat of the bank. The same was true of aids to merchants in the payment of customs. Anticipations of the government would also be most convenient at the different places where the interest of the debt was to be paid. The case in America was different from that in England: the interest there was all due at one place, and the genius of the monarchy favored the concentration of wealth and influence at the metropolis.  
He thought the plan liable to other objections: It did not make so good a bargain for the public as was due to its interests. The charter to the bank of England had been granted for 11 years only, and was paid for by a loan to the government on terms better than could be elsewhere got. Every renewal of the charter had in like manner been purchased; in some instances, at a very high price. The same had been done by the banks of Genoa, Naples, and other like banks of circulation. The plan was unequal to the public creditors—it gave an undue preference to the holders of a particular denomination of the public debt, and to those at and within reach of the seat of government. If the subscriptions should be rapid, the distant holders of paper would be excluded altogether.  
In making these remarks on the merits of the bill, he had reserved to himself, he said, the right to deny the authority of Congress to pass it. He had entertained this opinion from the date of the constitution. His impression might perhaps be the stronger, because he well recollected that a power to grant charters of incorporation had been proposed in the general convention and rejected.  
Is the power of establishing an incorporated bank among the powers vested by the constitution in the legislature of the United States? This is the question to be examined.  
After some general remarks on the limitations of all political power, he took notice of the peculiar manner in which the federal government is limited. It is not a general grant, out of which particular powers are excepted—it is a grant of particular powers only, leaving the general mass in other hands. So it had been understood by its friends and its foes, and so it was to be interpreted.  
As preliminaries to a right interpretation, he laid down the following rules:  
An interpretation that destroys the very characteristic of the government cannot be just.  
Where a meaning is clear, the consequences, whatever they may be, are to be admitted—where doubtful, it is fairly triable by its consequences.  
In controverted cases, the meaning of the parties to the instrument, if to be collected by reasonable evidence, is a proper guide.  
Cotemporary and concurrent expositions are a reasonable evidence of the meaning of the parties.  
In admitting or rejecting a constructive authority, not only the degree of its incidentality to an express authority, is to be regarded, but the degree of its importance also; since on this will depend the probability or improbability of its being left to construction.  
  
Reviewing the constitution with an eye to these positions, it was not possible to discover in it the power to incorporate a Bank. The only clauses under which such a power could be pretended, are either—  
1. The power to lay and collect taxes to pay the debts, and provide for the common defence and general welfare: Or,  
2. The power to borrow money on the credit of the United States: Or,  
3. The power to pass all laws necessary and proper to carry into execution those powers.  
The bill did not come within the first power. It laid no tax to pay the debts, or provide for the general welfare. It laid no tax whatever. It was altogether foreign to the subject.  
No argument could be drawn from the terms “common defence, and general welfare.” The power as to these general purposes, was limited to acts laying taxes for them; and the general purposes themselves were limited and explained by the particular enumeration subjoined. To understand these terms in any sense, that would justify the power in question, would give to Congress an unlimited power; would render nugatory the enumeration of particular powers; would supercede all the powers reserved to the state governments. These terms are copied from the articles of confederation; had it ever been pretended, that they were to be understood otherwise than as here explained?  
It had been said that “general welfare” meant cases in which a general power might be exercised by Congress, without interfering with the powers of the States; and that the establishment of a National Bank was of this sort. There were, he said, several answers to this novel doctrine.  
1. The proposed Bank would interfere so as indirectly to defeat a State Bank at the same place. 2. It would directly interfere with the rights of the States, to prohibit as well as to establish Banks, and the circulation of Bank Notes. He mentioned a law of Virginia, actually prohibiting the circulation of notes payable to bearer. 3. Interference with the power of the States was no constitutional criterion of the power of Congress. If the power was not given, Congress could not exercise it; if given, they might exercise it, altho it should interfere with the laws, or even the constitution of the States. 4. If Congress could incorporate a Bank, merely because the act would leave the States free to establish Banks also; any other incorporations might be made by Congress. They could incorporate companies of manufacturers, or companies for cutting canals, or even religious societies, leaving similar incorporations by the States, like State Banks to themselves: Congress might even establish religious teachers in every parish, and pay them out of the Treasury of the United States, leaving other teachers unmolested in their functions. These inadmissible consequences condemned the controverted principle.  
The case of the Bank established by the former Congress, had been cited as a precedent. This was known, he said, to have been the child of necessity. It never could be justified by the regular powers of the articles of confederation. Congress betrayed a consciousness of this in recommending to the States to incorporate the Bank also. They did not attempt to protect the Bank Notes by penalties against counterfeiters. These were reserved wholly to the authority of the States.  
The second clause to be examined is that, which empowers Congress to borrow money.  
Is this a bill to borrow money? It does not borrow a shilling. Is there any fair construction by which the bill can be deemed an exercise of the power to borrow money? The obvious meaning of the power to borrow money, is that of accepting it from, and stipulating payment to those who are able and willing to lend.  
To say that the power to borrow involves a power of creating the ability, where there may be the will, to lend, is not only establishing a dangerous principle, as will be immediately shewn, but is as forced a construction, as to say that it involves the power of compelling the will, where there may be the ability, to lend.  
The third clause is that which gives the power to pass all laws necessary and proper to execute the specified powers.  
Whatever meaning this clause may have, none can be admitted, that would give an unlimited discretion to Congress.  
Its meaning must, according to the natural and obvious force of the terms and the context, be limited to means necessary to the end, and incident to the nature of the specified powers.  
The clause is in fact merely declaratory of what would have resulted by unavoidable implication, as the appropriate, and as it were, technical means of executing those powers. In this sense it had been explained by the friends of the constitution, and ratified by the state conventions.  
The essential characteristic of the government, as composed of limited and enumerated powers, would be destroyed: If instead of direct and incidental means, any means could be used, which in the language of the preamble to the bill, ‘might be conceived to be conducive to the successful conducting of the finances; or might be conceived to tend to give facility to the obtaining of loans.’ He urged an attention to the diffuse and ductile terms which had been found requisite to cover the stretch of power contained in the bill. He compared them with the terms necessary and proper, used in the Constitution, and asked whether it was possible to view the two descriptions as synonimous, or the one as a fair and safe commentary on the other.  
If, proceeded he, Congress, by virtue of the power to borrow, can create the means of lending, and in pursuance of these means, can incorporate a Bank, they may do any thing whatever creative of like means.  
The East-India company has been a lender to the British government, as well as the Bank, and the South-Sea company is a greater creditor than either. Congress then may incorporate similar companies in the United States, and that too not under the idea of regulating trade, but under that of borrowing money.  
Private capitals are the chief resources for loans to the British government. Whatever then may be conceived to favor the accumulation of capitals may be done by Congress. They may incorporate manufacturers. They may give monopolies in every branch of domestic industry.  
If, again, Congress by virtue of the power to borrow money, can create the ability to lend, they may by virtue of the power to levy money, create the ability to pay it. The ability to pay taxes depends on the general wealth of the society, and this, on the general prosperity of agriculture, manufactures and commerce. Congress then may give bounties and make regulations on all of these objects.  
The States have, it is allowed on all hands, a concurrent right to lay and collect taxes. This power is secured to them not by its being expressly reserved, but by its not being ceded by the constitution. The reasons for the bill cannot be admitted, because they would invalidate that right; why may it not be conceived by Congress, that an uniform and exclusive imposition of taxes, would not less than the proposed Banks ‘be conducive to the successful conducting of the national finances, and tend to give facility to the obtaining of revenue, for the use of the government?’  
The doctrine of implication is always a tender one. The danger of it has been felt in other governments. The delicacy was felt in the adoption of our own; the danger may also be felt, if we do not keep close to our chartered authorities.  
Mark the reasoning on which the validity of the bill depends. To borrow money is made the end and the accumulation of capitals, implied as the means. The accumulation of capitals is then the end, and a bank implied as the means. The bank is then the end, and a charter of incorporation, a monopoly, capital punishments, &amp;c. implied as the means.  
If implications, thus remote and thus multiplied, can be linked together, a chain may be formed that will reach every object of legislation, every object within the whole compass of political economy.  
The latitude of interpretation required by the bill is condemned by the rule furnished by the constitution itself.  
Congress have power “to regulate the value of money”; yet it is expressly added not left to be implied, that counterfeitors may be punished.  
They have the power “to declare war,” to which armies are more incident, than incorporated Banks, to borrowing; yet is expressly added, the power “to raise and support armies”; and to this again, the express power “to make rules and regulations for the government of armies”; a like remark is applicable to the powers as to a navy.  
The regulation and calling out of the militia are more appurtenant to war, than the proposed bank, to borrowing; yet the former is not left to construction.  
The very power to borrow money is a less remote implication from the power of war, than an incorporated monopoly bank, from the power of borrowing—yet the power to borrow is not left to implication.  
It is not pretended that every insertion or omission in the constitution is the effect of systematic attention. This is not the character of any human work, particularly the work of a body of men. The examples cited, with others that might be added, sufficiently inculcate nevertheless a rule of interpretation, very different from that on which the bill rests. They condemn the exercise of any power, particularly a great and important power, which is not evidently and necessarily involved in an express power.  
It cannot be denied that the power proposed to be exercised is an important power.  
As a charter of incorporation the bill creates an artificial person previously not existing in law. It confers important civil rights and attributes, which could not otherwise be claimed. It is, though not precisely similar, at least equivalent, to the naturalization of an alien, by which certain new civil characters are acquired by him. Would Congress have had the power to naturalize, if it had not been expressly given?  
In the power to make bye laws, the bill delegated a sort of legislative power, which is unquestionably an act of a high and important nature. He took notice of the only restraint on the bye laws, that they were not to be contrary to the law and the constitution of the bank; and asked what law was intended; if the law of the United States, the scantiness of their code would give a power, never before given to a corporation—and obnoxious to the States, whose laws would then be superceded not only by the laws of Congress, but by the bye laws of a corporation within their own jurisdiction. If the law intended, was the law of the State, then the State might make laws that would destroy an institution of the United States.  
The bill gives a power to purchase and hold lands; Congress themselves could not purchase lands within a State “without the consent of its legislature.” How could they delegate a power to others which they did not possess themselves?  
It takes from our successors, who have equal rights with ourselves, and with the aid of experience will be more capable of deciding on the subject, an opportunity of exercising that right, for an immoderate term.  
It takes from our constituents the opportunity of deliberating on the untried measure, although their hands are also to be tied by it for the same term.  
It involves a monopoly, which affects the equal rights of every citizen.  
It leads to a penal regulation, perhaps capital punishments, one of the most solemn acts of sovereign authority.  
From this view of the power of incorporation exercised in the bill, it could never be deemed an accessary or subaltern power, to be deduced by implication, as a means of executing another power; it was in its nature a distinct, an independent and substantive prerogative, which not being enumerated in the constitution could never have been meant to be included in it, and not being included could never be rightfully exercised.  
He here adverted to a distinction, which he said had not been sufficiently kept in view, between a power necessary and proper for the government or union, and a power necessary and proper for executing the enumerated powers. In the latter case, the powers included in each of the enumerated powers were not expressed, but to be drawn from the nature of each. In the former, the powers composing the government were expressly enumerated. This constituted the peculiar nature of the government, no power therefore not enumerated, could be inferred from the general nature of government. Had the power of making treaties, for example, been omitted, however necessary it might have been, the defect could only have been lamented, or supplied by an amendment of the constitution.  
But the proposed bank could not even be called necessary to the government; at most it could be but convenient. Its uses to the government could be supplied by keeping the taxes a little in advance—by loans from individuals—by the other banks, over which the government would have equal command; nay greater, as it may grant or refuse to these the privilege, made a free and irrevocable gift to the proposed bank, of using their notes in the federal revenue.  
He proceeded next to the cotemporary expositions given to the constitution.  
The defence against the charge founded on the want of a bill of rights, presupposed, he said, that the powers not given were retained; and that those given were not to be extended by remote implications. On any other supposition, the power of Congress to abridge the freedom of the press, or the rights of conscience, &amp;c. could not have been disproved.  
The explanations in the state conventions all turned on the same fundamental principle, and on the principle that the terms necessary and proper gave no additional powers to those enumerated. (Here he read sundry passages from the debates of the Pennsylvania, Virginia and North-Carolina conventions, shewing the grounds on which the constitution had been vindicated by its principal advocates, against a dangerous latitude of its powers, charged on it by its opponents.) He did not undertake to vouch for the accuracy or authenticity of the publications which he quoted—he thought it probable that the sentiments delivered might in many instances have been mistaken, or imperfectly noted; but the complexion of the whole, with what he himself and many others must recollect, fully justified the use he had made of them.  
The explanatory declarations and amendments accompanying the ratifications of the several states formed a striking evidence, wearing the same complexion. He referred those who might doubt on the subject, to the several acts of ratification.  
The explanatory amendments proposed by Congress themselves, at least, would be good authority with them; all these renunciations of power proceeded on a rule of construction, excluding the latitude now contended for. These explanations were the more to be respected, as they had not only been proposed by Congress, but ratified by nearly three-fourths of the states. He read several of the articles proposed, remarking particularly on the 11th. and 12th. the former, as guarding against a latitude of interpretation—the latter, as excluding every source of power not within the constitution itself.  
With all this evidence of the sense in which the constitution was understood and adopted, will it not be said, if the bill should pass, that its adoption was brought about by one set of arguments, and that it is now administered under the influence of another set; and this reproach will have the keener sting, because it is applicable to so many individuals concerned in both the adoption and administration.  
In fine, if the power were in the constitution, the immediate exercise of it cannot be essential—if not there, the exercise of it involves the guilt of usurpation, and establishes a precedent of interpretation, levelling all the barriers which limit the powers of the general government, and protect those of the state governments. If the point be doubtful only, respect for ourselves, who ought to shun the appearance of precipitancy and ambition; respect for our successors, who ought not lightly to be deprived of the opportunity of exercising the rights of legislation; respect for our constituents who have had no opportunity of making known their sentiments, and who are themselves to be bound down to the measure for so long a period; all these considerations require that the irrevocable decision should at least be suspended until another session.  
It appeared on the whole, he concluded, that the power exercised by the bill was condemned by the silence of the constitution; was condemned by the rule of interpretation arising out of the constitution; was condemned by its tendency to destroy the main characteristic of the constitution; was condemned by the expositions of the friends of the constitution, whilst depending before the public; was condemned by the apparent intention of the parties which ratified the constitution; was condemned by the explanatory amendments proposed by Congress themselves to the Constitution; and he hoped it would receive its final condemnation, by the vote of this house

ANECDOTE  
  
[Whole No. 190.]  
  
CONGRESS.  
  
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.  
WEDNESDAY, Feb&#x27;. 2.  
  
The BANK BILL under confederation..  
MR.MADISON began with a general resview of  
the advantages and di fad vantages-os banks.  
The former he stated to confi.ft in,firft,the aids they  
afford to merchants who can thereby push their  
mercantile operations farther with thfefaine capi­  
tal.—2d.The aids to merchants in paying punctu­  
ally the customs.—3d. Aids to the government iu  
complying punctually with its engagements,  
when deficiencies or delays happen in the reve­  
nue.—4th. In diminifliing uf&#x27;ury.—sth. In lav­  
ing the wear of the gold and lilver kept in the  
vaults, and reprefenied by notes.—6th. In fa­  
cilitating occafiona! remittances from different  
places where notes happen to circulate. Theef­  
fecft of the proposed bank, in railing the value  
of stock, he thoughf, had been greatly overrated.  
It would no doubt raifethatof the stock fubferib­  
ed into the bank; but could have little effeCl on  
stock in general, as the interest on it would re­  
main the fame, and the quantity taken out of the  
market would be replaced by bank stock.  
The principal diladvantages confitted in, ifr.  
banishing the precious inetals, by fnbftituting  
anotlier medium to perform their office : This  
effect was inevitable. It was admitted by th£  
nioft enlightened patrons of banks, particularly  
by Smith 011 the Wealth of Nations. The com­  
mon anf&#x27;wer to the objection was, that the money  
banished was only an exchange for something  
equally valuable that would be imported in re­  
turn. He admitted the weight of this observa­  
tion in general, but doubted whether, in the pre­  
fe»t habits of this country, the returns would  
not be in articles of no permanent ufeto it. 2d.  
Expoling the public and individuals to all the  
evils of a run on the bank, which would be par­  
ticularly calamitous in so great acountry as this,  
and might happen from various causes, as falfe  
rumours, bad management of the institution, &amp;ji  
unfavorable balance of trade from fliort crops, &amp;c.  
  
It was proper to be considered alfb, that the  
mod important of the advantages would be bet­  
ter obtained by feweral banks properly distri­  
buted, than by a single one. The aids to com­  
merce could only he afforded at or very near the  
feat of the bank. The fame was trhe of aids to  
merchants in the payment of customs. Antici­  
pations of the&#x27; government would also be niolt  
convenient at the different places where the in­  
terest of the debt was to be paid. The cafe in  
America was different from that in England : the  
interest there was all due at one place, and the  
genius of the monarchy favored the concentra­  
tion of wealth and influence at the metropolis.  
  
He thought the plan liable to other objections r  
Tt did not make so good a bargain for-the public  
as was due to its iuterefts- The charter to the  
bank of England had been granted for it years  
only, and was paid for by a loan to the govern­  
ment on terms better than could be elfewliere  
got. Every renewal of the charter had in like  
manner been purchased ; in some instances, at a  
very high price. The fame had been done by  
ihe banks of Genoa, Naples, and otherlikebanks  
of circulation. The plan was unequal to the  
public creditors—it gave an undue preference to  
the holders of a particular denomination of the  
public debt, and to those at and within reach of  
ihe feat of government. If the fubl&#x27;criptions  
should be rapid, the diflant holders of paper  
would be excluded altogether.  
In making these remarks on the merits of the  
bill, he had°referved to himfelf, he said, the right  
to deny the authority of Congress topafsir. lie  
had entertained this opinion from the dare of  
the constitution. His impression might perhaps  
be the stronger, because he weil recollected that  
a power to grant charters of incorporation had  
been proposed in the general convention and re­  
-3 Is the power of eftablifiiing an incorporated bank  
among the powers veiled by the constitution in  
the legillature of IHe United States? This is the  
question to be examined.

After some general remarks on the limitations  
of all political power, he took notice of the pe­  
culiar manner in which the federal government  
is limited. It is not ageneral grant, out of which  
particular powers are excepted—it is a grant of  
particular powers only, leaving the general mass  
in other hands. So it had been understood by  
its friends and its foes, and so it was to be inter­  
preted.  
  
As preliminaries to a right interpretation, he  
laid down the following rules :  
  
An interpretation that destroys the very cha­  
ra&lt;fteriftic of the government cannot be just.  
  
Where a meaning is clear, the conferences,  
whatever they may be, are to be admitted—  
where doubtful, it is fairly triable by its conse­  
quences.  
  
In controverted cases, the meaning of the par­  
ties to the inftrunient, if to be collected by rea­  
sonable evidence, is a proper guide.  
Cotemporary and concurrent expositions are a  
reasonable evidence of the meaning of the par­  
ties.  
  
In admitting or rejecting a conflrutflive au­  
thority, not only the degree of its incidentality  
to an express authority, is to be regarded, but  
the degree of its importance also ; lince on this  
will depend the probability or improbability of  
its being left to conftru&lt;stion.  
Reviewing the constitution with an eye to  
tliefe positions, it was not poflible to discover in  
it the power to incorporate a Bank. The only  
clauses under which such a power could be pre­  
tended, are either—  
  
1. The power to lay and colled; taxes to pay  
the debts, and provide for ihe common defence  
and general welfare : Or, - ✓  
2. The power to borrow money on the credit  
of the United States : Or,  
  
3. The power to pass all laws neceflary and  
proper to carry into execution those powers.  
The bill did not come within the firft power.  
It laid no tax to pay the debts, or provide for the  
general welfare. It laid no tax whatever. It  
■was altogether foreign to the fubje&lt;ft.  
  
No argument could be drawn from the terms  
&quot; common defence, and general welfare.&quot; The  
power as to these general purposes, was limited  
to acfts laying taxes for them ; and the general  
purposes themlelves weie limited and explained  
by the particular enumeration subjoined. To  
■underltand these terms in any sense, that would  
juftify the power in question, would give to Con­  
gress an unlimited power ; would render nuga­  
tory the enumeration of particularpowers ; would  
fupercede all the powers refervedto the state go­  
vernments. These terms are copied from the  
articles of confederation ; had it ever been pre­  
tended, that they were to be understood other­  
wise than as here explained ?  
  
It had been said that &quot; general welfare&quot; meant  
cases in which a general power might be exerci­  
sed by Congress, without interfering with the  
powers of the States; and that the eftablifliment  
of a National Bank was of this fort There  
■were, he said, several answers to this novel doc-  
  
trine  
  
x. The proposed Bank would interfere so as  
indirectly to defeat a State Bank at the fame &#x27;  
place 2. It would directly interfere with the  
rights of the States, to prohibit as well as to eftab­  
lifti Banks, and the circulation of Bank Notes.  
He mentioned a law of Virginia, actually prohi­  
biting the circulation of notes payable to bearer.  
3. Interference with the power of the States was  
110 conftitutiotial criterion of the power of Con­  
gress. If the power was not given, Congress  
could not exercise it ; if given, they might exer­  
cise it, altho it should interfere with the laws, or  
even the constitution of the States.—4. If Con­  
gress could incorporate a Bank, merely because  
the act would leave the States free to establish  
Banks also ; any other incorporations might be  
xnade by Congress. They could incorporate com­  
panies of manufacturers, or companies for cutting  
canals, or even religious societies, leaving simi­  
lar incorporations by the States, like Stare Banks  
to themselves: Congress might even establish re­  
ligious teachers in every parish, and p?y them  
oilt of the Treasury of the United States, leaving  
other teachers unmolelted in their functions.   
These inadmissible confeqiiences condemned the  
controverted principle.  
  
The cafe of the Bank established by the for­  
mer Congress, had been cited as a precedent.   
This was known, he said, to have been the child  
of neceflity. It never could be juftified by the  
regular powers of the articles of confederation.  
Congress betrayed a consciousness of this in re­  
commending to the States to incorporate the Bank  
also. They did not attempt to protect the Bank  
Notes by penalties against counterfeiters. These  
were reserved wholly to the authority of the  
States.  
  
The second clause to be examined is that, which  
empowers Congress to borrow money.  
Is this a bill to borrfl/w money ? It does not  
borrow a fliilling. Is there any fair conftru&lt;slion  
l&gt;y which the bill can be deemed an exercise of  
the power to borrowmoney ?—The obviousmean­  
ing of the power to borrow money, is that of ac­  
  
eepting it ftoni, and stipulating payment to tliofe  
who are able and &quot;milling to lend.  
To fay that the power to borrow involves a  
power of creating the ability, where there inay  
be the will, to lend, is not only eftablifliinga dan-  
  
gerous principle, as will be immediately fliewn,  
but is as forced a construction, as to fay that it  
involves the power of compellingthe will, where  
there may be the ability, to lend.  
  
The third clause is that which gives the power  
to pass all laws necefl&#x27;ary and proper to execute  
  
the fpecified powers.  
Whatever meaning this claufemay have, none  
can be admitted, that would give an unlimited  
discretion to Congress.  
Its meaning mull, according to the natural and  
obvious force of the terms and the context, be  
  
limited to means necejfary to the end, and incident  
to the nature of the fpecified powers.  
  
The clause is in fa (ft merely declaratory of  
what would have resulted by unavoidable impli  
  
cation,as the appropriate,and as it were,technical  
means of executing those powers. In this (enfe  
it had been explained by the friends of the con­  
stitution, and ratified by the Hate conventions.  
  
The elfential charatfteriftic of the government,  
as composed of limited and enumerated powers,  
would be destroyed : If inltead of direct and in­  
cidental means, any means could be used, which  
in the language of the preamble to the bill, &#x27; might  
be conceived to be conducive to the fuccefsful  
conducting of the finances ; or might be conceiv­  
ed to tend to give facility to the obtaining of loans.&#x27;  
He urged an attention to the ditFufe and duiftile  
terms which had been found requisite to cover  
the stretch of power contained in the bill. He  
compared them with the terms nece[fary and proper,  
used in the Constitution, and alked whether it  
was possible to view the two defer Options as fyno­  
ninious, or the one as a fair and fafe commentary  
on the other.  
  
If, proceeded he, Congress, by virtue of the  
power to borrow, can create the means of lend­  
ing, and in purfiTance of&#x27;thefe means, can incor­  
porate a Bank, they may do any thing whatever  
creative of like means.  
  
The Eaft-lndia company has been a lender to  
the Britifli government, as well as the Bank, and  
the South-Sea company is a greater creditor than  
either. Congress then may incorporate similar  
companies in the United States, and that too not  
under the idea of regulating trade, but under  
that of borrowing money.  
Private capitals are the chief resources for loans  
to the Britilh government. Whatever then may  
be conceived to favor the accumulation of capi-  
  
tals may be done by Congress. They may incor­  
porate manufacturers. They may give tnonopo-  
  
ies in every branch of domeitic industry  
  
If, again, Congress by virtue of the power to  
borrow money, can create the ability to lend,  
they may by virtue of the power to levy money,  
create the ability to pay it. The ability to pay  
taxes depends on the general wealth of the so­  
ciety, and this, on the general prosperity of  
agriculture, manufactures and commerce. Con­  
gress then may give bounties and make regula­  
tions on all of these objedls. \
  
The States have, it is allowed on all hands, a  
concurrent right to lay and collect taxes. This  
power is secured to them not by its being ex­  
pressly reserved, but by its not being ceded by  
the constitution. The reai&#x27;ons for the bill can­  
not be admitted, because they would invalidate  
  
that righc ; why may it not be conceived by Con­  
gress, that an uniform and exglufive impohtion  
of taxes, would not less than the proposed Banks  
&#x27; be conducive to the fuccefsful conducting of the  
national finances, and tend to give facility to the  
obtaining of revenue, for the use of the govern-  
  
ment ?&#x27;  
  
The doctrine of implication is always a tender  
one. The danger of it has been felt in other  
governments. The delicacy was felt in the adop­  
tion of our own ; the danger may also be felt,  
if we do not keep close to our chartered author­  
ities.  
  
Mark the reasoning on which the validity of  
the bill depends. To borrow money is made the  
end and the accumulation of capitals, implied as  
the meant. The accumulation of capitals is then  
the end, and a bank implied as the means. The  
bank is then theend, and a charter of incorpo­  
ration, a monopoly, capital punishments, &amp;c.  
implied as the i?ieans.  
If implications, thus remote and thus multi­  
plied, can be linked together, a chain may be  
formed that will reach every object of legislation,  
every object within the whole compass of politi­  
cal economy.  
The latitude of interpretation required by the  
bill is condemned by the rule furniflied by the  
constitution itfelf.  
Congress have power &quot; to regulate the value  
of money yet it is expressly added not left to  
be implied, that counterfeitors may be puuiflied.  
They have the power &quot; to declare war,&quot; to  
which armies are more incident, than incorpo­  
rated Banks, to borrowing ; yet is expressly ad  
ded, the power &quot;to raise and support armies  
and to this again, the express power &quot; to make  
  
758  
  
rules and regulations for the government of ar­  
mies a like remark is applicable to the powers  
  
as to a navy,  
  
The regulation and calling out of the militia  
are more appurtenant to war, than the proposed  
bank, to borrowing ; yet the former is not left  
to conftrudlion.  
  
The very power to borrow money is a less re­  
mote implication from the power of war, than  
an incorporated monopoly bank, from the pow­  
er of borrowing—yet the power to borrow is iloc  
left to implication.  
  
It is not pretended that every ii-ifertioi] oroinif­  
fion in the constitution is the effed of fyltematic  
attention. This is not the character of any hu­  
man work, particularly the work of a body of  
men. The examples cited, with others &quot;that  
might be added, fufTiciently inculcate nevertheless  
a rule of interpretation, very different from that  
on which the bill relbs. They condemn the cx­  
ereife of any power, particularly a great and im­  
portant power, which is not evidently and jieccl­  
farily involved in an exprefspower.  
It cannot be denied that I lie power proposed  
to be exercised is an important power.  
As a charter of incorporation the bill creates  
an artificial person previously not exiftingin law.  
It confers important civil rights and attributes  
which could not otherwise be claimed. It is,  
though not precisely similar, at least   
to the naturalization of an alien,by which certain  
new civil characters are acquired by him. Would  
Congress have had the power to naturalize, if it  
had not been expressly givea ?  
In the power to make bye laws, the bill dele­  
gated a fort of legislative power, which is un­  
questionably an adt of a high and important na­  
ture. He took notice of the only restraint on  
the bye laws, that they were not to be contrary  
to the law and the conllicution of the bank ; and  
alked what law was intended ; if the law of the  
United States, the scantiness of their code would  
give a power, never before given to a corpora­  
tion—and obnoxious to the States, whose laws  
would then be fuperceded not only by the laws  
of Congress, but by the bye laws of a corpora­  
tion within their own juridiction. If the law  
intended, was the law of the State, then the  
State might make laws that would destroy an in­  
stitution of the United States.  
  
The bill gives a power to purchase and ho&#x27;cl  
lands ; Congress themselves could not purchase  
lands within a State &quot; without the consent of  
its legislature.&quot; Mow could they delegate a pow­  
er to others which theydid not pollefs themselves  
It takes from our fucceilors, who have equal  
rights with ourselves, and wrh the aid of expe­  
rience will be more capable of deciding on the  
fubjeCl, an opportunity of exercising that right,  
for an immoderate term.  
  
Ittakes from our constituents the opportunity  
of deliberatingon the untried mealure, although  
their hands are also to be tied by it for the fame  
  
erra  
  
It involves a monopoly, which afFedis the equal  
rights of every citizen.  
  
It leads to a penal regulation, perhaps capital  
punishments, one of the moll: foleinn aits of so­  
vereign authority.  
  
From this view of the power of incorporation  
exercised in the bill, it could never be deemed  
an acceflary or subaltern power, to be deduced  
by implication, as a means of executing another  
power ; it was in its nature a diftintTt, an inde­  
pendent and fubltantive prerogative, which not  
being enumerated in the constitution could never  
have been meant to be included in it, and not  
being included could never be rightfully exer­  
cised.  
  
He here adverted to a diftincftion, which he  
said had not been fufficiently kept in view, be­  
tween a power necefl&#x27;ary and proper for the go­  
vernment or union, and a power neceifary and  
proper for executing the enumerated powers. In  
the latter cafe, the powers included in each of  
the enumerated powers were not exprefled, but  
to be drawn from the nature of each. In the  
former, the powers composing the government  
were expressly enumerated. This constituted  
the peculiar nature of the government, no power  
therefore not enumerated, could be inferred from  
the general nature of government. Had the  
power of making treaties, for example, been  
omitted, however neceflarj&#x27; it might have been,  
the defect could only have been lamented, orfup­  
plied by an amendment of the constitution.  
But the proposed bank could not even be called  
necessary to the government; at molt it could  
be but convenient. Its uses to the government  
could be supplied by keeping the taxes a little in  
advance—by loans from indi vid uals—by the other  
banks, over which the government would have  
eqnal command ; nay greater, as it may grant  
or refufe to these the privilege, made a free and  
irrevocable gift to the proposed bank, of using  
their notes in the federal revenue.  
He proceeded next to the coteniporary exposi­  
tions given to the constitution.  
The defence against the charge founded on  
the want of a bill of rights, presupposed, he said.  
that the powers not given were retained; ani

that tliofe given Were not to be extended l&gt;y re­  
mote implications. On any other fuppoiition,  
the power ot Congress. to abridge the freedom  
of the press, or the rights of conicience, &amp;c.  
could not have been disproved.  
  
The explanations in the Itate conventions all  
turned on the fame fundamental principle, and  
011 the principle that the terms necell&#x27;ary and  
proper gave no additional powers to thole enu­  
merated. [Here he read sundry paflages from  
the debates of the Pennsylvania, Virginia and  
North-Carolinaconventions, fbewing the grounds  
on which the conflitution had been vindicated  
by its principal advocates, against a dangerous  
latitude of its powers, charged 011 it by its oppo­  
nents.] He did ni»t undertake to vouch for the  
accuracy or authenticity of the publications  
which he quoted—be thought it probable that  
the sentiments delivered might in many instances  
have been mistaken, or imperfedlly noted ; but  
the-complexion of the whole, with what he him­  
felf and many others must recollecit, fully jufti­  
iied the use he had made of them.  
  
The explanatory declarations and amendments  
accompanying the ratiffcations of the several  
states formed a striking evidence, wearing the  
fame complexion, He referred those who might  
doubt on the fubjed:, to the several acts of rati-  
  
fication  
  
The explanatory amendments proposed by  
Congress themselves, at least, would be good au­  
thority with them; all these renunciations  
power proceeded on a rule of conftrucftion, &lt;SP&#x27;  
eluding the latitude now contended for. These  
explanations were the more to be respected, as  
they had not only been proposed by Congress,  
but ratified by nearly three-fourths of the rtates.  
He read several of the articles proposed, remark­  
ing particularly on the&#x27; nth. and 12th. the-for­  
mer, as guarding against a latitude of interpre­  
tation—the latter, as excluding every source of  
power not within the constitution itfelf.  
  
With all this evidence of the sense in which  
the constitution was understood and adopted, will  
it not be said, if the bill fliould pass, that its  
adoption was brought about by one set of argu­  
ments, and that it is now administered under tke  
influence of another set ; and this reproach will  
have the keener sting, because it is applicable to  
so many individuals concerned in both the adop­  
tion and administration.  
  
In fine, if the power were in the constitution,  
the immediate exercife&#x27;of it cannot beeflential—  
if not there, the exercise of it involves the guilt  
of ufurpatioii, and establishes a precedent of in­  
terpretation, levelling all the barriers which li­  
mit the powers of the general government, and  
protect those of the state governments. If the  
point be doubtful only, refpeft for ourselves,  
who ought to shun the appearance of precipitan­  
cy and ambition ; refpeift for our fucceflors, who  
ought not&#x27;lightly to be deprived of the opportu­  
nity of exercising the rights of legiilation ; re­  
spect for our constituents who have had no op­  
portunity of making known their sentiments,  
-and who are theinfelves to be bound down to the  
ineafure for so long a period ; all these consider­  
ations require that the irrevocable decision Ihould  
at leaftbe suspended nntil another feflion.  
It appeared on the whole, he concluded, that  
the power exercised by the bill was condemned  
by the silence oftheconftitutioti ; was condemned  
by the rule of interpretation ai ifing out of the  
constitution ; was condemned by its tendency to  
destroy thevnain charatfteriftic oftlie constitution;  
was condemned by the expofitiortis of the friends  
of the constitution, whilst depending before the  
public ; was condemned by the apparent intention  
of the parties which ratified the constitution ;  
was condemned by the explanatory amendments  
proposed by Congress themselves to the Constitu­  
tion ; and he hoped it would receive its final  
condemnation, by the vote of this house.

ble. This, however true it might be generally, would not probably be the cafe in  
thiscountry, at prefent; it wasto be feared that the returns would not be in fub{an-  
tial articles, of permanent ufe.  
  
2d. Expofing the public and individuals to all the calamitous confequences of a run  
on the babk in fo extenfive a country, whenever falfe rumours, bad management of  
she inftitution, an unfavourable balance of trade, or any other caufe fhould produce

He objefed to the plan of a fingle bank. ‘The principal advantages would be  
better obtained from feveral banks, properly diftributed. he aids to commerce  
could only be afforded at or very near the feat of the bank ‘The fame was true of  
aids to merchants in the payment of cuftoms. Anticipations of the government would  
alfo be the moft convenient at the different places where the intereit of the debt was  
to be paid. The cafe in America was differeit from that in England: the intereft  
there was all due at one place, and the genius of the monarchy favoured the concen-  
tration of wealth and influence at the metropolis.  
  
He thought the plan liable to other objections : It did not make fo good a bargain  
fur the public as was duc to its interefts. ‘The charter to the bank of England had  
heen granted for ¥5 years only, and was paid for by a loan to the government on  
terms better than could be elfewhere get. Every renewal of the charter had in like  
manner been purchafed ; in fome inftances, at a very high price. The fame had been  
done by the banks of Genoa, Naples, and other like banks of circulation  
  
lu making thefe remarks on the merits of the bill, he had referved to himfelf, he  
faid, the right to deny the attherity of congrefs to pafsit. Hc had entertained this  
opinion from the date of the conflitution. His impreflien might perhaps be the  
ftronger, becaufe he well recollected that a power to grant charters of incorporation  
had been propvufed in the general convention and rejected  
  
Is the power of flablifoing an incorporated bank among the powers velled by the confitue  
tion in the legifature of the United States ? Lhis is the quettign to be examined.  
  
After fome general remarks on the limitations of all political power, he took no-  
fice of the peculiar manner in which the federal government is limited. It is not a  
general grant, owt of which particolar powers are excepted—it isa grant of particular  
powers only, leaving the general mafs in other hands. So it had been underftood by  
its friends and its foes, and fo it was to be interpreted.  
  
As preliminaries to a right interpretation, he laid down the following rules :  
  
An interpretation that deftroys the very characteriftic of the goverrment cannot  
be ju  
  
Where a meaning is clear, the confequences, whatever they may be, are to be ad-  
mitted—where doubtful, it isto be examined by its confequences.  
  
In controverted cafes, the meaning of the parties to the inftrument, if to be col-  
lected by reafonable evidence, is a proper guide.  
  
_ _Cotemporary and concurrent expofitions are a reafonable evidence of the meaning  
of the parties.  
  
in admitting or rejecting a conftructive authority, not only the degree of its inci-  
dentality to an exprefs authority, is to be regarded, but the degree of its importance  
alfo ; fince on this will depend the probability or improbability of its being left te  
confitaGion  
  
Reviewing the conftitution with an cye to thefe pofitions, it was not poffible to dif-  
cover in it the power to mcorporate a bak. ‘he only claufes under which fuch a  
power could be pretended, are cither-—  
  
1. The power to lay and collcé? taxes to pay the debts, and prowide for the cémmn defence  
and general welfare: Or,  
  
a» The power to borrow money on the credit of the United States; Qe,  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Proceedings of Congrefs. 419  
  
3- The power to pafs all laws aecefary and proper to carry inte execution the! porwers.  
  
The bill did not come within the frf power. It laid no tax ta pay the debts, of  
provide for the general welfare. It laid notax whatever. It was altogether fo-  
reign to the fubject.  
  
No argument could be drawn from the terms “ common defence, and general welfare.&quot;  
The power, as to thefe general purpofes, was limited to acts laying taxes for them ;  
and the general purpofes themfelves were limited and explained, by the particular eau:  
meration fubjoined. To underftand thefe terms in any fenfe that would juftify the  
power in quettion, would give to congrefs an unlimited power; would render nugatory  
the enumeration of particular powers; would fuperfede all the powers referved to the  
ftate governments. Thefe terms are copied from the articles of confederation ; had ie  
ever becn pretended, that they were to be underftood otherwife than as here explained?  
  
It had been faidthat “ general welfare” meant cafes in which a general power might  
be exercifed by congrefs, without interfering with the powers of the ftates; and  
that the eftablifiment of a cational bank was of this fort. There were, he faid, fe-  
veral anfwers to this novel de&amp;trine.  
  
I. The propofed bank would interfere fo as indire@tly to defeat a flate bank at  
the fame place.—2. It would dire@ly interfere with the rights of the fates, to prebibis  
2s well as to eftablifh banks, and the circulation of bank notes. He mentioned a law  
of Virginia, aGtually prohibiting the circulation of notes payable to bearer. 3. Inter-  
fcrence with the power of the {tates was no conftitutional criterion of the power of  
congrefs. If the power was not given, congrefs could not exercife it ; if given, they  
might exercife it, although it fhould interfere with the laws, or even the conttitation  
of the ftates.—4. If congrefs could incorporate a bank, racrely becaufe the a@ would  
leave the ftates free to eftablifh banks alfo, any other incorporations might be made  
hy congrefs. They could incorporate companies for cutting canals, or even religious  
fucieties, leaving fimilar incorparations to the ftates. Congrefs might even eftablith  
religious teachers in every parifh, and pay them out of the treafury of the united  
tates, leaving other teachers unmolefted in their fun@tions.—Thefe inadmiffible con-  
fequences condemued the controverted principle.  
  
The cafe of the bank eftablithed by the former congrefs, had been cited as a frece-  
dent.— This was known, he faid, to have been the child of neceflity. It never could  
be juftified by the regular powers of the articles of confederation. Congrefs betrayed  
a confcioufnefs of this in recommending to the ftate# to incorporate the bank alfo;  
They did not attempt to prote*: the bank notes by penalties againft counterfeiters.  
‘Thefe were referved wholly to the authority of the ftates.  
  
The fecond claufe tobe examined, is that which @mpowers congrefs to borrow moncy.  
  
Is this a bill to borrow money? It does not borrow a hhilling Is there any fair  
conftruction by which the bill can be deemed an exereife of the power to borrow me-  
ney ?—The obvious meaning of the power to borrow money, is that of accepting it  
from, and ftipulating payment to, thole who are able and willing to lend.  
  
To fay that the power to berrow involves a power of creating the ability, where  
there may be the will, to lend, is not only eftablidhing a dangerous principle, as will  
be immediately fhewa, but is as forced a conftrution, as to fay that it iavolves the  
power of compelling the will, where there may be the ability, to lend.  
  
The third clawe is that which gives the power to pafs all laws neceary and proper  
to execute the {pecitied powers.  
  
Whatever meaning this claufe may have, none can be admitted, that would give  
an unlimited difcretion to congrefs  
  
Its meaning mutt, according to the natural and obvious force of the terms and the  
context, be limited to means nece/fary co the end, and incident to the nature of the {pecifi-  
ed powers.  
  
The claufe is, in faét, merely declaratory of what would have refulted by unavoid-  
able implication, as the appropriate, and as it were, technical means of executing  
thofe powers. ‘In this fenfe it had been explained by the friends of the cunftitution,  
and ratified by the ftate conventions.  
  
The effential charaéteriftic of the government, as compofed of limited and enume-  
rated powers, would be deftroyed, if inttead of direé&amp; and incidental means, any  
means could be ufed, which, in the languase of the preamble tothe bill, * might be  
conceived to be conducive to the fuccefsful conducting of the finances; or might be  
conceived tu tend to give facility to the obtaining of loans.’ He urgedan attention to the

diffufe and du@ile terms which had been found requifite to cover the ftretch of power  
contained in the bill. He compared them with the terms necefJary and proper, ufed in  
the coniticution, and aiked whether it was poflible to view the two defcriptions as fy-  
nonimous, or the one as a fair and fafe commentary on the other.  
  
If, proceeded he, congrefs, by virtue of the power to borrow, can create the  
means of jending, and in purfuance of thefe means, can incorporate a bank, they may  
do any thing whatever creative of like means. ao  
  
The Eatt-india company has been a lender to the Britifh government, as well as  
the bank, and the outh-Sea company is a greater creditor than either. Congrefs  
then may incorporate fimilar companies in the united ftates, and that too not under  
the idea of regulating trade, but unde: that of borrowing money.  
  
Private capitals are the chief refources for loans to the Britifh government. What-  
ever then may be conceived to favour the accumulation of capitals may be done by  
congrels, ‘hey may incorporate manufacturers. They may give monopolies in ¢-  
very branch of domettic induftry.  
  
lf, again, congrefs by virtue of the power to borrow money, can create the abi-  
lity to lend, they may, by virtue of the power to levy money, create the ability to  
pay it. The ability to pay taxes depends on the general wealth of the fociety, and  
this, on the geueral profperity of agriculture, manufactures, and commerce. Con-  
grefs then may give bounties and make regulations on all thefe objects.  
  
‘The ttates have, it is allowed on all hands, a concurrent right to lay and colle&amp; tax-  
es. This power is fecured to them, not by its heing exptefsly referved, but by its not  
being cecaed by the conftitution. ‘The reafons for the bill cannot be admitted, be-  
caufe they would invalidate that right; why may it not be conceived by congrefs,  
that an uviform and exclufive impofition of taxes, would, not lefs than the propofed  
bank, ‘ be condweive to the fucceisful conducting ef the national finances, and tend to  
give facility to the obtaining of revenue, for the ufe of the government ?”  
  
The doctrine of implication is always a tender one, The danger of it has been felt  
in other governments. ‘Ihe delicacy was felt in the adoption of our owm ; the dan-  
ger may alfo be felt, if we do not keep clofe to our chartered authorities.  
  
Mark the reafoning on which che validity of the bill depends. To borrow money  
is made the end and the accumulation of capitals, implied asthe means. The accumula-  
tion of capitals is then the end, asd a bank implied asthe means. The bank is then  
the end, and a charter of incorporation, a monopoly, capital punifhments, &amp;c. ime  
plic i as the means.  
  
I{ implicatious, thus remote and thus multiplied, can be linked together, a chain  
may be formed that will reach every object of legiflation, every object within the  
whole compats of political economy.  
  
The latitude of interpretation required by the bill is condemned by the rule fur-  
nifhed by the confitution itfelf.  
  
Congrefs have power “ to regulate the value of money ;’  
(not left to be implied) that counterfeiters may be punifhed.  
  
They have the power “to declare war,’’ to which armies are more incident, than  
incorporated banks, to borrowing ; yet it is exprefsly added, the pewer “ to raife and  
fupport armies;” and to this again, the exprels power “ to make rules and regulations  
for the government of armies; ’’ a like remark 1s applicable to the powers as to a navy.  
  
The regulation and calling out of the militia are more appurtenant to war,.than  
the propoied bank, to borrowing ; yet the former is not left to conftruction.  
  
‘The very power to borrow money is a le.s remote implication from the power of  
war, than an incorporated monopoly bank, from the power of borrowing—yet the  
powcr to borrow is not left to implication.  
  
it is not pretended that every infertion or omiflion in the conftitution is the effect  
of tytematic attention. ‘This is not the character of any human work, particularly  
the work of a body of men. ‘Ihe examples cited, with others that might be added,  
fufficiently inculcate neverthelefs a rule of interpretation, very different from that on  
which the bill reits. ‘Chey condemn the exercile of any powers particularly a great  
and important power, which is not evidently and weceflarily involved in an exprefs  
power.  
  
It cannot be denied that the power propofed to be exercifed is an important power.  
  
Asa charter of incorporation the bill creates an artificial perfon previoufly not ex-  
iling in law. It confers important civil rights and attributes, which could not other

wife be claimed. It is, though not precifely fimilar, at lcaft equivalent, to the na-  
turalization of an alicn, by which certain new civil characters are acquis ed by him.  
Would congrefs have had the power to naturalize, if it had not been expresily  
given?  
  
In the power to make bye-laws, the bill delegated a fort of legiflative power,  
which is unqueftionably an act of a high and important nature. He took notice of  
the only reitraint on the bye-laws, that they were not to be contrary to the law and  
the conftitution of the bank ; and atked what law was intended? If the law of the  
united ftates, the fcantinefs of their code would give a power, never before given  
to a corperation—and obnoxious to the ftates, whofe laws would then be fupericded  
not only by the laws of congrefs, but the bye-laws of a corporation within their own  
jurifdiction. If the law intended, was the law of the ftate, then the fate might  
make Jaws that would deftroy an inftitution of the united ftates. .  
  
The bill gives a power to purchafe and hold lands; congrefs themfelves could not  
purchafe lands within a ftate “ without the confent of its legiflature.’”? How could  
they deiegate a power to others which they did not poflefs themfelves ?  
  
It takes from our fucceffors, who have equal rights with ourfelves, and with the  
aid of experience will be more capable of deciding on the fubject, an opportunity of  
exercifing that right, for an immoderate term  
  
It takes from our conftituents the opportunity of deliberating on the untried mea-  
fure, although their hands are alfo to be tied by it for the fame term  
  
It involves a monopoly, which affects the equal rights of every citizen.  
  
It leads to a penal regulation, perhaps capital punifhments, one of the moft fo-  
Jenin acts of fovereign authority.  
  
From this view of the power of incorporation exercifed in the bill, it could never  
be deemed an acceffary or fubaltern power, to be deduced by implication, asa means  
of executing another power ; it was in its nature a diltinet, an independent, and fub-  
ftantive prerogative, which not being enumerated in the conitirution could never have  
heen meant to be included in it, and not being included could never be rightfully ex-  
ercifed.  
  
He here adverted to a diftin&amp;ion, which he faid had not been fufficiently kept in  
view, between a power neceflary and proper for the government or union, and a  
power neceflary and proper for executing the enume¢rated powers. In the latter  
cafe, the powers included in each of the enumerated powers were not expreffed, but  
to be drawn from the nature of each. In the former, the powers compofing the co-  
vernment were expresily enumerated. This conftituted the peculiar nature of  
government ; no power therefore not enumer , could be mnferred from the gene-  
ral nature of government. Had the power of making treaties, for example, been  
omitted, however neceflary it might have been, the defect could enly have been la-  
mented, or fupplied by an amendment of the con(titutron.  
  
But the propofed bank could not even be called neceflary to the government; at  
moft it could be but convenient. Its ufes to the government could fupplied by  
keeping the taxes a little in advance—by loans from individuals—by the other banks,  
over which the government would have equal command, nay greater, as i may  
grant or refufe to thefe the privi&#x27;eze, and make a free and irrevocable gift to the pro-  
poled bank, of ufing their notes in the federal revenue  
  
He proceeded next to the contemporary expofitions given to the conftitution.  
  
The defence againft the charge founded on the want of a bill of rights, prefup-  
pofed, he faid, that the powers not given were retain d; and that thofe given were  
not tuo be extended by remote implications. On any other luppofition, the power of  
congrefs to abridge the freedom of the prefs, or the rights cf conicience, &amp;c. could  
not have been difproved  
  
The explanations m the fate conventions all turned on the fame fundamental prin-  
  
ciple, that the terms “ne ry and proper” gave no additional powers tothotfe cna-  
merate

the more to be refpected, as they had not only been propofed by congrefs, but rati-  
ficd by neariy tiree-ivurths of the itates. He read teveral of the articles propofed,  
remarking particuariy on the 11th. and 12. the former, as guarding againft a latitude  
of interpretatiou—the letter, as exciuding every fource of power not within the con-  
ftitution ited.  
  
W ith ali this evidence of the fenfe in which the confitution was underftood and  
adopted, wail at mot be fad, af che bill should pafs, that its adoption was brought a-  
bout vy one det of arguments, aud that ut is now adaunilered under the influence of  
anether icc? and this reproach wali have the kcener fting, becaufe it us applicable to  
fo mony individuals concernéd in both the adoption and admuniltration.  
  
In Huc,if the power were in the conititution, the immediate exercife of it cannot  
be cilential—it not there, the exercile of it involves the guilt of ufurpation, and e-  
tabliihes a precedent of interpretation, levelling all the barriers which limit the power  
of the general gevernment, and protect thole of the ilate governments. If the point  
be doub:tul only, reipect for ouricives, who ought to fhun the appearance of preci-  
pitancy and ambition ; refpect tor our fucceflors, who ought net lightly to be depriv-  
ed of the opportuuity of cxerciling the mghts of legylaton ; refpect for our conititu-  
ents who lave had no opportynity of niaking known their fentunents, and who are  
themfelves to be bound down to the meafure for &#x27;o long a period; all thefe confidera-  
tious require that tac arrevocable decilion ihould at leaft be fulpended until another  
{eflion.  
  
it appeared, on the whole, he concluded, that the power exercifed by the bill was  
condemned by the fiience of the conititution ; was condemned by the rule of inter-  
pretation arifing out of the conititution ; was condemned by its tendency to deftroy

A as the subject will probably be again agi­  
tated, during the present session of Con­  
gress, it may not be improper, at this time,  
to re publish this speech. It will show the  
light in which this matter was seen nineteen  
years ago, and in which it ought to he re­  
viewed at this day, since the Constitution  
is still silent, as it relates to the power of  
granting charters of incorporation.

HOUSE OF REPRESEJW&#x27;ATIVES,  
or THE  
UNITED STATES.  
Wednesday, Feb. 2, 1791.  
THE BAN K-KILL  
UNDER CONSIDERATION.  
MR. MADISON began with a general re­  
view of the advantages and disadvai • ges of  
but ks. The former he stated to consist in, first,  
tlie aids they afiuidlo merchants who can there­  
by push their mercantile operations farther with  
the *air.e capital 2d. The aids to merchants  
in D ying punctually the customs. 3d. Aids to  
the government in complying punctually with  
its engag ments, when deficiencies or delays  
happen in the revenue. 4th. In diminishing u­  
aury. 5th. In saving the wear of the gold and  
siher kept in the vaults, and represented by  
nop‘8. 6th In facilitating occasional .rcnrmtAli­  
cea from different pi .ccs where notes happen lo  
circulate. The effect of the proposed bank, in  
raising the value of stock, he thought, had been  
greatly overrated. It would no doubt raise that  
of the stock subscribed into the hank ; but could  
I tor little effect on slock in general, as th*t in­  
terest on it would remain the same, and the  
quantity frakau out of the market would be re­  
  
p^eea ry bank stock.  
l&#x27;l.e principal disadvantages consisted in, 1st.  
banishing the precious metals, by substituting  
another medium to perform their offi-rn : This  
effect was inevitable It was admitted by the  
most enlightened patrons of banks, particularly  
by Smith on the Wealth of Nations. The com­  
mon answer to the objection was, that the mo­  
ney banished was only an exchange for some­  
thing equally valuable that would be imported in  
return. He admitted the weight of this nhst-r­  
vuticu in &quot;general, but doubted whet her, in the  
present habits of this country, the returns would  
hot he in articles of no permanent use to it._  
21. Exposing the public and individuals to nil  
the evils off a run on the bank, which would be  
particularly calamitous in ho great a country as  
tins, *nd injgiit happen from various causes, ak  
false rum us, bad management of the instituti­  
on, an unfavorable b.xlmce of trade from short  
crops, &amp;.c.  
It was proper to he considered also, that th*  
m ist import .mt of the advantages would be bet­  
t. &lt; buii.nl by several banks properly distribu  
ti than by a single one. The aids to commerce  
eeni l onlj be afforded at or very wear the seat of  
t ic hank The same w .s true oi aids to mer­  
chants in the payment of customs. Anticipati­  
ons oi the government would also be most con­  
veuient at the different places where the inte­  
rc.-t of the debt was to be paid. The case in  
America was different from that in England :_  
the interest there teas all due at one plac«, and  
the genius of.the monarchy favored the con­  
ci ntration of wealth and influence at the me­  
lt opohs.  
  
• it- in uigui tnc plan liable to other ohjecti­  
c.&#x27;.j : It did not make so good a bargain for the  
public &#x27;.s was due to its interests. The charter  
to the bank of England iiud been granted for 11  
years only, and was paid lot by u loan to the  
government on (arms better than could be else­  
where got. Every renewal of the charity had  
in like manner been purchased ; in some instan­  
ces at a Very hiph price. The f ame had been  
dot e by &#x27;the banks of Genoa, Naples and other  
lik&#x27;- h?oks of circulation. The plan whs unequal  
to the public creditors—it gave an undue pre­  
ference u&gt; the holders of a panic ular denotninati*  
on oi tile public debt, and to those at aiul with­  
in reach of the seat of government If the sub­  
scription* should be rapij, the distent holders ©f  
p .pi r &quot;vuld be excluded dtigethi-r.

by its friends and its fo«.E, aad ao it was to be

justify the powecin question, \Hrould give ta Con­  
fess an unlimiVd power; would rentier mi­  
gatory th« enuaiersiion of particular powers ;  
would supercedt all tlia powers reserved to the  
stale governm-nts. These terms are copied  
front the articles of confederation ; had it evei  
been pretended, that they were to be understood  
otherwise than as here explained !  
It had been said that “ general welfare” meant  
cases in which a general power might he exercis­  
ed by Congress, without interfering with the pow  
ers of the States ; and that the est iblishment • !  
a National Dank was of this sort. There were,  
he Said, several answers to this novel doctrine  
1. The proposed Dank would interfere so as I  
indirectly to defeat a sluts bank at the •aine place. J  
2 It would directly interfere with the rights ol i  
the states, to prohibit as well as to establish banks  
and the circulation of bank notes, llo mentioned ;  
a law of Virginia, actually prohibiting the circu- |  
lation of notes payabe to heart r. 3. Iaterfer-&#x27;  
ence with the power of the slates was no coksti- j  
tutiorul criterion of the power of Congress. If&#x27;  
j the power was not given, Congress could not ox-!  
er, ise it; if given, they Hiiglit exardise it, al- I  
! though it should interfere with the laws or even I  
the constitution of the states. 4. If Congress j  
could incorporate a bank, merely because the act !  
I would leave the states free to establish banks i  
also ; any other incorporations might be made by :  
Congress. They could incorporate companies of&#x27;  
inaoufai turers, or companies lor cutting canals,  
or even retig.oils societies, leaving similar incor­  
porations by the states, like state banks to them  
selres : Congress m&#x27;urbtcven establish religious  
teachers in every purisli, and pay them out of the  
Treasury of the United States, leaving other:  
teachers unmolested in their functions.-— These |  
i inadmissible consequences condemned the con­  
troverted principle.  
The case of the bank established by the former  
\ Coiigies3, had been cite 1 as »• precedent. This  
was known, lie said, to have been the child ofue­  
I cessily. It never could be justified by the regu­  
lar powers of tile articles ot confederation. Cm­  
1 gress betrayed a consciousness of this in recom­  
j mending to tlia states to incorporate the bank ul­  
| so. They did not attempt to protect, tile bauk  
notes by penalties agdnst counterfeiters. These  
j were reserved wholly to the authority of die  
• states.  
  
The second clause to bx? examined isf that  
which empowers Congress to borrow money.  
Is this a bill to borrow money ? It does not  
borrow a shilling. I* there any fair construction  
by which the bill can be dec.ned an exercise of  
the powsr to borrow money ? The obvious mean­  
ing of the power to borrow money, is that of ac­  
cepting it from, and stipulating pa} inenl to those  
who are able and uit/ir.g to lend.  
To sav that the power to borrow involves a  
power of creating the ability, where there may  
&#x27; he the will to lend, is not only establishing a dan­  
gerous principle, as will he immediately shewn,  
but is as forced u construction, as to say that &gt;t  
involves the power of compelling the will, where  
there may he the ability to lend.  
The third clause is that which gives the power  
to pass ati laws necessary and propet to exeeute  
the specified powers.  
Whatever meaning this clause may hare,none  
can be admitted,that would give an unlimited dis­  
cretion to Congress.  
its meaning must, according to the natural and  
obvious force ot the terms ami the context, be  
J limited to means neorttwy to the r d, and incident  
| to the nature of lue specified powers.  
The clause is in i«»u merely declaratory of vvhat  
would have resulted by unavoidable implication,  
as the appropriate, and as it were, technical  
moans of executing C use powets In this sense  
it tiuu been explained by the friends of the con­  
stitution, ..nd rallied by ti e state conventions.  
The essentialcharaett r stic of the government,  
as composed *1 limited and enumerated powers,  
would be destroyed : if instead of direct and in­  
cidental means, any means could be used, which  
in the language of the preamble to the bill,  
* might be conceived to be conducive to the suc­  
cessful conducting of the finances ; or might be  
conceived to tend to give facility to the obtaining  
of loans.’ He urged an attention to the diffuse  
and ductile terms which had been found requisite  
to cover the stretch of power contained in the  
bill. He compared them w ith the terms •tecessa­  
j ry aiul proper, used in the Constitution, and asked  
i whether it was possible to view the two descrip  
tions us symmimous, or the one as a lair and safe  
j commentary on the other.  
  
] ii| |nub^ucu lie, kyunjjicss, uy virtue Of il&#x27;.c  
power to borrow, can create the means *,f lend­  
ing, and in pursuance of these means, can Incor­  
porate a bank, they may do any thing whatever  
creative of like means.  
The East India company has been a lender to  
the British government, as well as the bank, and  
i the South .^ua company is a greater creditor than  
1 either. Congress then may incorporate similar  
( companies in Ike United States, and that too not  
under the idea *f regulating u ads, but under that  
of harrowing money.  
Private capitals are the chief resources for loans  
to the Briir.i government. Whatever then may  
b conceived la favor the accumulation ofcapitals  
m-y sc done by Congress. They may incorpo­  
rate manufacturers. They may&#x27; give monopolies  
•n every hrai r.h of domestic industry  
^ it, again, Congres, by virtue of the power to  
borrow money, can create the ability to lend,  
tiiry mav hy virtue of the power iw levy money,  
ci eaSe the ability to pay it. The ability to pay  
t.&lt;xi s depends on the general wealth of the soci­  
ety, and this, on the general prosperity of agri­  
cullure, ni.iMtifaclurcs and commerce. Congress  
then may gin: bounties and make regulations on  
allot these objects.  
I lie state* have, it is allowed on all hands, a  
concurrent right to lay and collect taxes. Tins  
power is secured to them not by its being express­  
ly reserved, but by its not being ceded by lb­  
constitute n. The reasons for the bill cannot he  
admitted, because they would invalidate that  
light ; why may it not be concr %ed by congress,  
that an uniform and exclusive imposition of tax­  
es, would nottle.** than the propw-e-l banks, * be  
conducive to the successful c6nductii&lt;g of die na­  
tional linances, and tend to five facility to the ob­  
t iniug oi revenue, for the use ot the ttoveru*  
ment ?’ °  
1 l.c doctruu of implication is always a lender  
o..e. i he danger of it lia. been f&gt;dl in other go­  
vernments. The d&lt; iicucy was felt in the aif .p­  
tion ot our own; the danger may also be felt, ii  
vve do lint keep close to our chartered authorities.  
.Mark the reasoning on which the validity of  
the bill depends. To borrow money is made ,iie  
end and the accumulation of capitals tit.plied an  
the meant The accumulation of capitals is then  
die end, and a bank implied as the mc«ns. The  
I I) ink is (lien tuc tn./9 arid the cIi tier of incorpo­  
1 ration, a mini -poly, capital punishments, &amp;c. on­

dial on which the hill vests They condemn the  
exercise of any power, particularly a great and  
important power, which is rot evidently and tie­  
ccssariiy involv . 1 in an express power.  
It cannot •&gt;« denied that the power proposed to  
be exercised is an important power.  
As a charter or incorporation the hill creates  
an artillcial person previously not existing in law.

which could not otherwise be claimed, ft is,  
though not precisely .similar, at It* i*t equivalent,

In the power to make bye laws, the hill delcga­

and obnoxious to the slates, whose laws would  
then be superceded not only by the laws of Con­  
gress, but by the bye-laws ol a corporation with­  
in tlieir own jurisdiction. If the law intended,  
was the law of the state, then the slate m.g’it  
make laws that would destroy an insiituliou of  
the U. Slates.

rights of every c ,vu.  
It leads to u pctiai regulr.t ion, perhaps capital  
punishments, one vf the most solemn acta cl  
sovereign authority.  
From this view of the power of incorporation  
cxerc.sud m the till, it could never be deemed  
an accessary or suba*U r« power, to l«e deduced  
by implication, as a means &gt;f executing a o in r  
power ; it was in its nature a distinct, an inde­  
pendent •■nd substantive prerogative, which not  
being enumerated m the constitution could nev­  
er have been meat t to he included in it, and  
not being included could never be ii/yhU’ullvcx  
ercised.  
Ho here adverted to a distinction, which he  
said had not been .suflicirnl l\ kept in view, be­  
tween a power necessary and proper lor the gov­  
ernment or union, and a p ,ver n«*c**s&gt;:arv a.;.I  
proper tor executing the enumerated powers, in  
the latter case, the powers included in each wl&#x27;j  
tlie enutmiraird powets were not rxpresei d, tmt  
to be drawn from the nature of each. Ju m- for­

were expressly enumerated. This constituted

It will not be allcdgcd that the first part of this  
clause has any ix la(ion to the subje t ; of ihe Isst  
it may be said, “ that by general welf are, is meant  
cases, in which a general power m,gut be exerci­  
sed by congress, w ithout inter!* ring with the  
pnwi rs of tiie states : anil that the establishment  
of i nat ional bank was ot this sort ” In answer  
to this, it appears to this assembly manifest,* that  
th proposed bank would interfere so as directly  
to . fleet a state bank at the same place ; that it  
would diretlv intcrh re with the rights of the  
states to prohibit as well as to establish banks, 8c.  
the circulation ot bank notes ; that into, ference  
with the power of tiie states, is no constitutional  
criterion of the power of Congiess If the pow­  
er was not given, congress could »u&lt;t exercise it;  
if given, th.-y might ex, rc.s t, although it should  
nilei ieie wiib iiici-iwa, ui cYCPi ti c CiiiiSiitiiuuii  
ot tiie states ; that if congress could incorporate  
a bunk, merely ber. use the act would leave the  
Malts tree to establish banks also, any other m­  
corpiuation might be made by congress; they  
might even establish religious teachers in ivery  
palish, and pay tln-m out ot me treasury of tiie  
United State*, teavu-g olht r teachers unmolested  
in their functions ’ And it must be fresh in the  
recollection of the Senators and representatives  
of this Mate in Congress, how loudly and dis­  
tinctly, on a late occasion, the people of Mary­  
land « xpresaeri their indignation at an attempt to  
en. mirage religion? establishments; their feel  
ings upon this subject are yet alive, and Ibis as­  
sembly is convinced that nothing would do grea­  
ter violence to their sentiments and opinions, m n  
any act which should indirt-tly invest congress  
with a power to erect or promote such establish  
ments.  
The second clause is, that which empowers  
congress to borrow money. The obvious mean­  
ing ot the power to borrow money, is that of ac  
cepting it from, and stipulating pay orient to, those  
wdio ale a&#x27;de and willing to lend. To say that tne  
power to borrow involves a p wer of creating the  
ability, where there m y be tne will to lend, is as  
forcttl a const&#x27;uction, as to say mat it involves  
the pow. r of comp-1ling the will, w here there  
may he the abmty to lend  
The third clause i«, that which gives the pow­  
er to pass all laws necessary and proper to exe  
cute ih&lt;-specified powers—** Whatever meaning  
this cl;-use nt «y have, none can he admitted that  
would give an unlimited discretion to congress*  
Its meaning must, according to the nutui d and  
obvious force of the tc; ms, and the context, be h  
mi&#x27;.ed to means necessary to tbr end, and incident  
  
to the nature of the specijieupisuers The clause  
is in f.ct, merely tic&lt; i tiutory ol what would hav­  
re suite tl by unavoidable implication, as the »p­  
propriate, and as it wire technical, means of e x­  
ecuting these powers” Let its pursue ibis im  
plied power a little further, and we shall cle&lt;ly  
perceive its unsutiudnea* and absurdity. “ To  
borrow money i-&gt; ma»&#x27;e tin end, and the accumu­  
Ihdon of capitals implied as t&#x27; e means. The ac­

MR. MADISON began with a general re  
view of me advantages and disadvantages of  
banks. The former lie stated to consist, in,  
flis , the atds they afford to merchants who  
can thereby push their mncantile opeia&#x27;i  
om farthei with the same capital. 2d. The  
aid^ to merchants in paying punctually the  
customs. 31 Aids to the government in  
Complying punctually with its engagements,  
when deficiencies or delavs happen in tile  
revenue. 4lb In diminishing u^ury. 5th.  
In saving the wear of the gold and silver  
kepi in the vaults and represented by notes.  
6 n. In facilitating occasional remittancts  
from different ptuces where notes happen to  
cncuiate. Tin. eff c of the proposed bank,  
in laising the value of stock, lie thought,  
hull been gteatly overrated It wuuld no  
doubt raise that of the si ck subscribed in  
to the bank ; but could have little effect on  
st«ck in general, us he interest on it would  
remain the same, imd the quantity token  
oio ot the market wouldoe icplaccdby Dunk  
stock.  
1 lie principal disadvantages consisted in,  
In banishing the ptecious metals, by sub.,  
su tiling anotuer medium to perform their  
office ; This effect was inevitable. It was  
$ »u muted by the most enlightened patrons of  
l»mks. particularly by Smith on the  
Wealth of Nations. The common answer  
to .he objection w is, thatthe money banish  
e&gt;l was only an exchange for something e*  
q.tally valuable that would be imported in  
return. He admitted the weight of this ob»  
serration in general, but doubted whether,  
in the present habits of this country, the  
return would not be in articles of no perma.  
nent use to ir. 2d. Exposing the public &amp;  
individuals to all the evils of a run on the  
bank, which would be particularly calami*,  
tens in so great a country as this, &amp; might  
happen from various causes, as false ru  
nuns, bad management of the institution, an  
uutavoi able balance of trade from short  
crops, &amp;c.  
It was proper to he considered also, that  
the most important of the advantage* would  
be better obtained by several banks proper­  
ly dis.ributed than by a single me. The  
aids to commerce could o lv be afforded at or  
very neat the seat of the bank. The same  
was ’rue of aids to merchants in the pay.  
nieu&gt; ot customs. Anticipations of the go  
veimnnn would also be most convenien^at  
the different place.* where the interest of  
the deln w«,s o be paid. The case in A­  
nie:ica was different from that inE gla.tl s  
the nrerest lher&gt; was all due at one place,  
and he genius ot the monarchy favored the  
Ci net n ration of wealth and influence at the  
me. 11 pols.  
  
iic it u^iii viic i&lt;tuic iu omer oojec­  
ti&lt;ais: I .i.d n v make so g&lt;&gt;&lt; d a bargain (or  
the j.uMic is wa* due 10 i s interests. The  
ci) ’ii i to the bank of E. gland tiad been  
gi?i ted lor 11 yeaisoniy iicw^s paid for by  
a man to the govei nmeiu on terms better  
than couidbe elsewhere got. Every renew­  
al of the charter had in l:ke manner been  
purchased ; in some instances at a very  
hig1. price The same had been dons- by  
the Hanks ut Genoa, Naples and other like  
banks of Circulation. The plan was une  
qual to the public creditors——it gave an  
undue preference to the holders of a parti.,  
cuiar denomination of the public debt; and  
U&gt; those at and within teacii of the seat of  
government. 11 the subscriptions should be  
rapid, the distant holders ot paper would be  
excluded altogether.  
In making these remarks on the merirsof  
the bill, he had reserved to himself, he said,  
the right to deny the authority of congress  
to pass it. He had entertained this opinion  
from the date of tile constitution. His im  
piession might perhaps be the stronger,  
because he well recollected, that a power  
to grant charters of incorporation had been  
proposed in the general convention and re  
jected.  
Is the power of establishing an incorfio  
raft&#x27;d bunk among the powers vested by ihe  
cot s i ution in the legislature of the U. S ?  
This is the question to lift examined.  
After s&lt; me general remarks on th/i limi  
tations of nl political power, he took notice  
ol the peculiar manner in which the fede­  
ral government is inn ed. It is not a gtn_  
eiul giant, out of which particular powers  
an « xcrpied. It is a gram ot particular j  
p&gt; wets only, leaving tin general mass in o­  
thei hands So it had beeti uniters ood by  
its blends and its foes, and ao it was to be  
inte. pr ed.  
  
,\s i- eiiminarie* to a rigut interpretation,  
he cud down ihi f&gt;Uu«i.&lt;g rules:  
A m trpietaiion that destroys the very  
ch.naciei isuc ot tne government cannot be  
Where a meaning is clear, theconseq ien  
ces. v.hatevei tiny may be, aie tube ad­  
m i«d—where doubtful, it is fairly triable  
by i s coin i quencea.  
1 controverted ca.cs, the meaning of the  
tuts o the iimminent, if to be collected  
by i easonabir evidence, is a proper guide.  
ole ..potary and concurrent expositions  
are a reasonable evidence of the meaning of  
the parties.  
In admitting or rejecting a constructive  
an lenity, not only the degree of hs inci­  
dtn&#x27;alily to an express Authority, is to be  
regarded, but ihe degree of its importance  
also; since on this will depend ihe proba^  
bitty or improbability of us being left to  
Co struction.  
Reviewing the constitution with an eye to  
thi e positions, it was not possible to disco­  
ver in it the power to incorporate a bank.  
The only clauses under which such a pow  
er could be pretended, are either—  
1 The power to lay and collect taxes, to  
pay the dents, and provide for the Common  
tlth nee and general welfare ; Or,  
U Tire1 power to borrow money on the ere  
dit of ihe U. b , Or,  
3. The power to pass all laws necessary  
ai d proper to carry into execution those  
powers.  
1 i.e bill did not come within the first pow­  
er. It laid no a* to pay the debts, or pi o„  
vidi lor the general welfare. It laid notax  
win ever. 1 was altogether foreign to he  
subject.

prse-&gt;, w.i limited to act* la) mg taxes for

these trim in any sense, that would justify  
the pi W&#x27; r it» questu n, would givu to con.  
g.e.-s at. unlimitedpow^r, *euld tender ou.  
  
gatory the enumeration of particular pow.  
lets; wouldsuperetde all the powers res« rv  
ed to the state government&#x27;&#x27;. These terms  
are copied from the articles of cmitede  
ration ; had it ever been pretended, that  
they were to be understood otherwise than  
as here explained ?  
It had been said that •* general welfare*’  
meant cases in which a general power might  
be exercised by congress, without interfering  
with the powers of he states; Sc that the e&gt;»  
tablishment of a National Bank was of this  
sort. There were, he said, several answers  
to this novel doctnnu.  
  
1 i he proposed Bank would interfere  
so as to indirectly to defeat a st te bank at 1  
the same place. 2. It would directly in  
terlere with the rights of the states to firo.  
/tibie as well as to establish banks and he  
circulation of bank notes. He mentioned  
a law of Virginia, actually prohibiting the  
ciixula.ion of notes payable to bearer. 3­  
Interference with the power of the states  
was no constitutional criterion of the power &#x27;  
of Congress. «If the power was not gi­  
ven. Congress could not exercise it, if  
given, they might exercise it although it  
should interfere with the laws or even the  
constitution of the slates. 4. If Congress  
could incorporate a bank, merely because  
the act would leave the states free to esta­  
blish bank - also; any other incorporations  
might be made by Congress. They could in­  
corporate companies of manufacturers, or  
c mpanies for cutting canals, or even reli­  
gious societies, leaving similar incorporati­  
ons by the states, like state banks to them­  
selves. Congress might even establish re­  
ligious teachers in every parish, and pay !  
them out of the Treasury of the U. Sta es, !  
leaving other teachets unmolested in their  
functions, l&#x27;hese inadmissible aonseqtien  
ces condemned the con roverted principle.  
  
l he cat-e m the bank established b\ the  
former Congress, had been cited as a pre  
cedent. This was known, he said, to have  
been the child ot necessity. I: never could!  
be justified by the regular powers of the ar j  
tides ot confederation. Congress betrayed i  
a consciousness of this in recommending to!  
the s&#x27;a&#x27;es to incorporate the bank also.— |  
They did not attempt to protect the bank  
notes by penalties against counterfeiters.—  
These were reserved wholly to the authori.  
ty of the states.  
The second clause to be examined is,  
that which empowers Congress to borrow 1  
money.  
Is this a bill to borrow mnnev * It does  
not borrow a shilling. Is thne any fair  
const! uctiun by which the bill can be deem  
ed an exercise of&#x27;lie power &gt;o borrow ino_  
net ? 1 he obvious meaning of the po&#x27;wei  
to borrow money, is that of accepting it  
h orn, and stipulating payment to those sho &#x27;  
are able and wl/tnt&#x27; to lend.  
To say !ha&lt; the power to borrow involves  
a power ot cri at«ng tie ability, where there  
may be &#x27;he will to lend is not onlv esta„  
blishing a dangerous principle, as will be  
immediately shewn, but is as forced a con  
siructinn as to say that it involves the  
power ot compelling &#x27;he will, where there j  
may be he ahi ity to lend.  
  
* ‘«trd ciuui&gt;6 is that which gives the  
power to p ss all luws necessary and pro.  
per in execute the specified powers.  
Whatever meaning this clause mav have,  
none can be admitted, that would give an  
unlimited discretion to Congress.  
I s me tiling must, according to the nr.tu  
I ral and obvious force of the terms and the  
context, be inured to means neccnsary to  
the end arid incident to the nature of th«  
specified powers  
The clause is in fact merely declaratory 1  
of what would have resulted by unavoida.  
ble implication, as the appropriate, &amp; as it  
were, technical means of executing those 1  
powers In this sense it had been explain  
ed by the friends of the constitution, and !  
ratified by the state conventions.  
The essential characteristic of the gov- .  
eminent, as composed of limited and enu  
merated powers, would be destroyed, if  
instead of direct and incidental means, any  
means could be used, which in the language  
of the preamble to the bill, •• might be con  
ceived o be conducive to the successful  
conducing of the finances; or mignt he  
conceived &lt;olend to give facility to the ob  
taming of loans ” He urged an attention  
to the diffuse and ductile terms which had  
been found requisite to cover the stretch of  
power contained in the bill He ccmpared  
them with the terms necessary and/iroficr,  
used in the Constitution, and asked whether  
it was possible to view the two descripti  
onsas synonirnous, or the one as a fair and  
s ife commentary on the ofher.  
If, proceeded he. Congress, by virtue of  
the power to borrow, cau create the means  
of lending, and in pursuance of these  
means, can incorporate a bank, they may  
do any ihtng whatever creative of like  
means.  
  
i ne r.ast inaia company Has been a lend  
er toihe British government, as well as the  
b nk. and the South Sea companv is a great.,  
er creditor than either. Congress then may  
incorporate similar companies in the U.  
States and that too not under the idea of  
regulating trade, bat under that of borrow,  
ing money.  
Private capitals are the chief resources &#x27;  
for loans to the Bri&#x27;bh government. What  
ever then may be conceived to favor the  
accumulation of capitals, may be done by  
Congress. They may incorporate manu­  
facturers. They may give monopolies in  
every branch of domestic indus&#x27;ry.  
If, again. Congress, by virtue of the  
power to borrow money, can create the a­  
bili&#x27;y to lend, they may by virtue of the  
power to levy money, cieate the ability to.  
pay it. The ability to pay taxes depends!  
on the general wealth of the society, and  
this, on he general prosperity of agricul.  
tore, manufactures and commerce Con­  
gress then may give bounties and make re  
gulations on all of these objec&#x27;s.  
The s&#x27;ftics hn.e, it is allowed on all  
hands, a concurrent right to lay and collect  
taxes. This power is secured fo them not  
by its being expressly reserved, but by its  
not being ceded by the constitution. The  
reasons tor the bill cannot be admitted, be  
cause they would invalidate that right;  
why may it not be conceived by congress,  
that an uniform and exclusive imposition of  
taxes, would not less than the proposed  
banks, “be conducive to the successful  
conducting of the national finances, and  
tend to give Jacili&#x27;y to the obtaining of re­  
venue for th£ use of the government }”  
The doctrine of implication is nlwavs a  
tender one. The danger of it has been felt  
in other governments. The delicacy was  
felt in the adoption of our own ; the dan­  
ger may also he felt, if we do not keep close  
to our chartered authorities.  
  
Mavk the reasoning on which the vali.  
dity ut the bill depends. To borrow money  
is uiude (ho end and the accumulation et  
  
capitals itufilied as the means. The accu.  
imit-ui&quot;&quot; • pi i a is is then the end. and a  
bai&#x27;k implied as tlie means. The bank, is  
then the end. anil the charter of incorpn  
ration, a monopoly, capital punishments.  
8cc implied as the means  
It implications, thus remote and thus  
multiplied, can be linked together, a chain  
may he formed that will reach every ob  
jec of legislation, every object within the  
whole compass of political osconoiny.  
The ta&#x27;itude of interpretation required  
by the hill is condemned by the rule fur.  
nished by the constitution itself.  
Congress have power “ to regulate the  
value &lt;&gt;| money yet it is expressly added,  
not lett to be implied, that counter feitet s !  
may be punished.  
They have the power “ to declare war j  
to which armies are more incident, than  
incorporated banks, to borrowing; yet is  
expressly added, the power to raise and  
support armies;” and to this again, the  
express power “ to make rules and regu­  
lations tor the government ot armies a  
like remark is applicable to the powers as  
| to a navy.  
  
i ne regulation and calling out of the  
militia, are more appurtenant to war, than  
the proposed bank, to borrowing, yet the  
former is not left *o con reaction.  
It is not pretended that every insertion or  
omission in the constitution is the i If ct ui  
systematic attention Thi* is not the cha_  
racter of any human work &gt; articularly the  
work of a body of men The examples  
cited, with others that might be added, sut  
ficiently inculcate never heless a rule of in­  
terpielation, ver-, different from that on  
which the bill res&#x27;s. hey condemn the ex.,  
ercise of any powe-, particularly a great and  
important power, which is not evidently md  
necessarily involved in an express pow r.  
It cannot be denied that the power pro.  
posed to be exe cised is an important p-nv _  
er.  
As a charter or incorporation the bill cre­  
ates an artificial person previously not ex­  
isting in law It confers important civil  
right and attribu es, which could not other,  
wise be claimed. It is, though not precisely  
similar, at lea-t equivalent, to the naturali.  
zation of an alien; by which*certain new civil  
characi? s are acquired b&gt; hnn. VV&lt;&lt;uid  
cong: ess have had the power to na uraiia» ,  
it it bad no&#x27; been expressly given t  
In the power to make b e laws, the bi.l  
d« legated a sort of legislative power, which  
is noq.i siiouably an act of a high and im  
p.mant name. I e tiwk notice of the only  
restraint on the bye laws, that they were  
no&gt; to be contrary to the law &amp; the constitu&#x27;i  
on of ihe bank ; and ask d what law was in  
tended ; if the law of the United Stales, the  
scaiiiiness o iheir code would give a power  
never before given to a corpora ion—and ob  
noxious to &#x27; he states, whose laws would then  
be superceded not only by the laws of con  
gress, but by the bye laws of a corporal ion  
within their own jurisdiction If tiie law m­  
- tended, was the law of the state, then the  
sta es might make laws that would destroy  
an institution of the United S ates.  
The bill gives a power «o purchase and  
hold lands; congress themselves could not  
purchase lands within a state •• without ihe  
consent of its legislature.” How couid mey  
delegate a power to others w.uch tney did  
not possess themselves ?  
  
ii iaK.es trom our successors, who have  
equal rights with ourselves, and with the aid  
of experience will be more capable ut decid  
ing on the subject, an opportunity of exerci­  
sing that right, for an immoderate term.  
It takes from our constituents the »ppor  
tunity of deliberating on the untried mea  
sure, although heir hands are also to be  
tied by it for the same term.  
It involves a monopoly, which affects the  
equal rights of every ciusen  
leads to a penal reg lauan, pci haps ca­  
pital pu .ishments. one &lt;&gt;t the most solemn  
acts of -overcign authouty.  
From this view of me power of incorpo­  
ration, exc ci*ed in the bill, it could never  
be deemed an accessary or a suba ieni  
power, to b«- deduced by implication as a  
me ns of executing another power ; u was  
in i s nature a distinct, an independent and  
substantive prerogative which not being e  
numerated in the c&gt; nstitution, couid never  
have been meant to be inc.uded m it, and  
not bring included, could never be righliul­  
ly exercised.  
  
He here adverted to a distinction which  
he said had not been sufficient!) ^ep- in vc w 1  
between a power necessity and proper tor  
the government or union, and a power ne­  
cessary and proper for executing tue enu­  
merated powers In the latter ea-e, the  
p*w rs included in each of the enumerated  
powers, were not expressed, but to btt diawn  
trom the nature of each. In the former, the  
powers composing the government were ex  
pressiy enu ■ erated. This constituted the  
peculiui nature of the government: no pow  
er therefore not enumerated, could be in­  
ferred from the general nature of govern  
men Had the power of making treaties,  
tor examp e, been omitted however neces.  
saiy it might have been, the defect could  
only have been lamented, or supplied by an  
amendment of the Constitution  
But the proposed bank coul i not even be  
called necessary to the government; at most  
it c.-uld he but convenient. Its uses to ihe  
government could be supplied by keeping the  
taxes a little in advance*—by loans from m  
dividuals—by the other banks, over which  
the government would have equal command ;  
nay grea er, as it may grant or refuse to  
these the privilege, made a tree and trrevo  
cabie gilt to the proposed bank, of using  
their notes in the federal revenue.  
lie proceetled next to the cote nporary ex­  
positions given to the constitution.  
The defence against «he charge founded  
on the warn of a bill of rights, presupposed,  
he said, that the powers not given weie re .  
tained ; and that those given were no. to oe  
ex ended by remote implications. CJn any  
other supposition, the power ot congress to  
abridge the freedom of he press, or the  
rights of conscience, &amp;c could not have been  
disproved  
The explanations in • lie s ate conventions  
all turned on the some fundamental princi&quot;  
pies, and on the principle that the tei ms  
necessary ar.d proper gave no additional  
powers to those enumerated. [Here he read  
sundry passages from the debates of die  
Pennsylvania, Virginia and N. Carolina  
conventions, site wing the grounds on which  
the constitution had been vindicated by its  
principal advocates, against a flangerous la­  
titude of its powers, chargcdon it by its op  
ponents ] lie did not undertake to vouch  
for the. accuracy or authenticity of the pub­  
lications whic.lt he quoted-he thought it  
probable that the sentiments delivered  
might in many instances have been misfa  
ken, or imperfectly noted; but the com­  
plexion et the whole, with what he hunseli  
  
tod many others mast recollect, fully justi­  
ce 1 i he use he had made of them.  
l&#x27;he explanatory declarations and amend­  
ments accompanying the ratifications of the  
several states formed a striking evidence,  
nearing the same complexion. He refer  
red those who might doubt on the subject,  
to the several acts of ratification.  
The explanatory amendments proposed  
by congress themselves, at least, would be  
good authority with them; all these renun­  
ciations of power proceeded on a rule of cun  
struct ion, excluding the latitude now conten  
ded tor. These explanations were the  
move to be rispected. as they had not only  
been proposed by congu ss. but ratified by  
nearly threefourths of the states. He read  
several of the articles proposed, remarking  
particularly on the Uih and 12&#x27;h, the for­  
mer as guarded against a latitude of inter  
pretation——tUe la&#x27;tet, as excluding every  
source of power not within the constitution  
itself  
  
wi.n an tms evidence ot the sense in |  
which &#x27;he constitution was understand  
and adopted, will it not be snid. if the bill  
sh &gt;ul:’. pass, that its adoption was brought  
alx»u by one set of arguments, and h i&#x27; it  
is onw administered under the infi iritr.e of  
another set; and this reproach w il have  
the keener,sting, because it is appl cable to  
so many individuals concerned in both the  
ad p &#x27;on and the ad ninistra&#x27;ion  
In , if the power were i i the cons&#x27;itu  
lion, tiie im.nedi c exerc se of it cannot be  
j essential-it not there, he exercise if it  
involves the guilt of usurpri&#x27;ion a.id esM &#x27;

have had no opportunity of m king known  
their sentiment and who are themselves  
to be h und dow i to the ineusure for so long  
a period ; all these - on &#x27;derations require  
thar tlie irrevocable decision should at least  
be suspended until another session.  
Ituppeared on the whole, he concluded,  
that the power exercised by the bill was  
condemned by the silence of the constitution ;  
was condemned by trie rule of interpretation  
arising out of the constitution ; was condemn­  
ed by its tendency to destroy the main cha­  
racter of the constitution ; was condemned  
by the expositions of the friends of the con­  
stitution, whde depending before the pub­  
lic; was condemned by the apparent inten­  
tion of the parties which ratified the con­  
s&#x27;itn ion; was condemned by the explanato­  
ry amendments proposed by congress them­  
selves to the cons itution ; and he hoped it  
would receive its final condemnation by

ty, and Mr Clay as its lea­  
der, iu opposition to the Bank charter in 1611. The  
war came, and the disorganization produced by it,  
gave birth to the Bank under the pretence of neces­  
sity. Mr Madison and Mr Clay changed their faith  
upon the plea of necessity. Mr Jefferson and Gene­  
ral Jackson adhered to the Constitution and the ori­  
ginal principles upon which they were opposed to  
the Bank in 1791 and 1611, and at the period of the  
establishment of the present Dank.  
MR. MADISON’S SPEECH  
In the House of Representatives of the United States,  
February &#x27;Id, 1791.  
THE BANK BILL UNDER CONSIDERATION.  
Mr Madison began with a general review of the  
advantages and disadvantages of Banks. The for­  
mer he stated to consist in, first,—the aids they af­  
ford to merchants, who cun thereby push their mer­  
cantile operations further with the same capital; 2d,  
the aids to merchants in paying punctually the cus­  
toms ; 3d, aids to the Government in complying  
punctually with its engagements, when deficiencies  
or delays happen in the revenue; 4lh, in diminish­  
ing usury ; 5th, in saving the wear of the gold and  
silver kept in the vaults, and represented by notes;  
6th, in facilitating occasional remittances from differ­  
ent places where notes happen to circulate. The ef­  
fect of the proposed Bank in raising the value of  
stock, he thought had been greatly overrated. It  
would, no doubt, raise that of the stock subscribed in  
the Bank, but could have little effect on the stock in  
general, as the interest on it would remain the same,  
and the quantity taken out of the market would be  
replaced by Bank slock.  
The principal disadvantages consisted in, first—  
banishing the precious metals, by substituting ano­  
ther medium to perform their office. This effect  
was inevitable. It whs admitted by the most en­  
lighted patrons of Banks, particularly by Smith, on  
the Wealth of Nations. The common answer to the  
objections was, that the money banished was only  
an exchange for something equally valuable that  
would l&gt;e imported in return. He admitted the  
weight of this observation, in general, but doubted  
whether, in the present habits of this country, the re­  
turn would not he in articles of no permanent use to  
it. 2d, Exposing the public and individuals to all  
the evils of a run on the Bank, which would be par­  
ticuarly calamitous in so great u country as this, and  
might happen from various causes—as false rumors,  
bad management of the institution, an unfavorable  
balance of trade, from short crops, &amp;c.  
It was proper to be considered, also, that the most  
important of the advantages would be better obtain­  
ed bv several Banks properly distributed, than by a  
single one. The aids to commerce could only be af­  
forded at or ver^ near the seat of the Bank. The  
same was true oi aids to merchants in the payment of  
customs. Anticipations of the government would  
also be most convenient at the different places where  
the interest ef the debts was to be paid. The case  
  
in America was different from that in England. The  
interest there was all due at one place, and the ge­  
nius of the monarchy favored the concentration of  
wealth and influence at the metropolis.  
He thought the plan liable to other objections. It  
did not make so good a bargain for the public, as was  
due to its interests. The charter to the Bank of  
England had been granted for eleven years only, and  
was paid for by a loan to the Government, on terms  
better than could be elsewhere got. Every renewal  
of the charter had, in like manner, been purchased ;  
in some instances at a very high price. The same  
had been done by the Banks of Genoa, Naples, and  
other like Banks of circulation. The plan was une­  
qual to the public creditors—it gave an undue pre­  
ference to the holders of a particular denomination of  
the public debt, and to those at and within reach of  
the seat of Government. If the subscriptions should  
be rapid, the distant holders of paper would be ex­  
cluded altogether.  
In making these remarks on the merits of the bill, he  
had reserved to himself, he said, the right to deny the  
authority of Congress to pass it. He had entertained  
this opinion from the date of the Constitution. His  
impression might, perhaps, be the stronger, because  
he well rkcollected, that (i power to grant char­  
ters of incorporation htui been proposed in general con­  
vention, and rejected.  
Is the power of establishing an incorporated Bank  
among the powers vested by the Constitution in the  
Legislature of the United States ? This is the ques­  
tion to be uncxnmii)t?d. After some general remarks  
on the limitations of all political power, he took no­  
tice of the peculiar manner in which the Federal  
Government is limited. It is not a general grant out  
of which particular powers are excepted. It is a  
grant of particular powers only, leaving the general  
mass in other hands. So it had been understood by its  
friends and its foes, and so it was to be interpieted.  
As preliminaries to a right interpretation, he laid  
down the following rules:  
An interpretation that destroys the very character­  
istic of the Government, cannot be just.  
Where a meaning is clear, the consequences,  
whatever they may be, are to be admitted. Where  
doubtful, it is fairly triable by its consequences.  
In controverted cases, the meaning of the parties  
to the instrument, if to be collected by reasonable  
evidence, is a proper guide.  
Contemporary and concurrent expositions are a  
  
rensonuuie evidence oi me meaning 01 me parlies.  
In admitting or rejecting a constructive authority,  
not only the degree of its inoidcntality to an express  
authority is to be regarded, but the degree of its impor­  
tance also; since, on this will depend the probability  
or improbability of its being left to construction.  
Reviewing the Constitution with an eye to these  
positions, it was not possible to discover in it the pow­  
er to incorporate a Bank. The only clauses under  
which such a power could be pretended, are either—  
1st, The power to lay and collect taxes, to pay the  
debts and provide for the common defence and gene­  
ral welfare; or,  
2d, The power to borrow money on the credit of  
the United States; or,  
3d, The power to pass all laws necessary and pro­  
per to carry into execution those powers.  
The bill did not come within the first power. It  
laid no tax to pay the debts or provide for the gene­  
ral welfare. It laid no tax whatever. It was alto­  
gether foreign to the subject.  
No argument could be drawn from the terms com­  
mon defence and general icelfurc. The power, as to  
these general purposes, was limited to acts laying  
taxes for them ; and the general purposes themselves  
were limited and explained by the particular enume­  
ration subjoined. To undersiand these terms in any  
sense that would justify the power in question,  
would give to Congress an unlimited power—would  
render nugatory the enumeration of particular pow­  
ers—would supersede all the powers reserved to the  
State governments. These terms are copied from  
the articles of confederation. Had it ever been pre­  
tended that they were to be understood otherwise  
than as here explained? It had been said that “gene­  
ral welfare&quot; meant cases in which a general power  
might be exercised by Congress, without interfering  
with the powers of the States; and that the esta­  
blishment of a National Bank was of this sort. There  
were, be said, several answers to this novel doctrine.  
1st. The proposed Bank would interfere so as indi­  
rectly to defeat a State Bank at the same place.  
2d. It would directly interfere with the rights of the  
States to prohibit, as well as to establish Bunks, and  
the circulation of Bank notes. He mentioned a law  
of Virginia actually prohibiting the circulation of  
notes payable to bearer.  
3d. Interference with the power of the States was  
no constitutional criterion of the power of Congress.  
If the power was not given, Congress could not exer­  
cise it; if given, they might exercise it, although it  
should interfere with the laws or even the constitu­  
tion of the States.  
4th. If Congress could incorporate a Bank, merely  
because the act would leave the States free to esta­  
blish Banks also, any other incorporations might be  
made by Congress. They would incorporate compa­  
nies of manufacturers, or companies for cutting canals,  
or even religious societies, leaving similar incorpora­  
tions by the States, like Slate Banks, to themselves ;  
Congress might even establish religious teachers in eve­  
ry parish, and pay them out of the Treasury of the U­  
nited States, leaving other teachers unmolested in their  
functions. The inadmiss&#x27;ble consequences con­  
demned the controverted principle. The case of the  
Bank established by the former Congress, had been  
cited as a precedent. This was known, he said, to  
hare been the. child of necessity. It never could be jus­  
tified by the regidar powers of the articles of confedera­  
tion. Congress betrayed a consciousness of this, in re­  
commending to the States to incorporate the Bank also.  
They did not attempt to protect the Bank notes by pen­  
alties against counterfeits. These were reserved whol­  
ly to the authority of the States.  
  
miii nrisiitiu i luuav iv uv i-j uiiiiucii , co mui iiun ii 1,111­  
pottera Congress to borrow money.  
I&gt; this a bill to borrow money ? It does not borrow  
a shilling! Is there any fair construction by which  
the bill can be deemed an exercise of the power to  
borrow money ? The obvious meaning of the power  
to borrow money, is that of accepting it from, and sti­  
pulating payment to those who are able and wilting  
to lend. To say that the power to borrow, involves  
a power of creating the ability, where there may be  
the will to lend, is not only establishing a dangerous  
principle, as will be immediately shewn, hut is as  
forced a construction as to say, that it involves the  
power of compelling the will, where there may be  
the ability to lend.  
The third clause is that which gives the power to  
pass all laws necessary and proper to execute the speci­  
fied powers.  
Whatever meaning this clause may have, none  
can be admitted, that would give an unlimited dis­  
cretion to Congress. Its meaning must, according  
to the natural and obvious force of the terms, and the  
context, be limited to means necessary to the end and  
incident to the return of the special powers.  
The clause is in fact, merely declaratory of what  
would have resulted by unavoidable implication as  
the appropriate, and, as it were, technical means of  
executing thoso powers. In this sense it had been  
explained by the friends of the Constitution, and ra­  
tified by the State Governments.  
The essential characteristic of the Government, as  
composed of limited and enumerated powers, would  
be destroyed, if, instead of direct and incidental  
means, anv means could be used, which, in the lan­  
guage of the preamble of the bill, “ might be con­  
ceived to be conductive to the successful conducting  
of the finances; or might be conceived to tend to give  
facility to the obtaining of loans.” lie urged an at­  
tention to the diffuse and ductile terms which had  
been found requisite to cover the stretch of power  
contained in the bill. He compared them with the  
terms necessary and proper, used in the Constitution,  
and asked whether it was possible to view the two  
descriptions os synonymous, or the one as a fair and  
safe commentary on the other?  
If, proceeded he, Congress, by virtue ofthe power  
to borrow, can create the means of lending, and in  
pursuance of these means can incorporate a Bank,  
they may do any thing whatever, creative of like  
means.  
The East India Company has been a lender to the  
British Government, as well as the Bank, and the  
South Sea Company is a greater creditor than cither  
—Congress, then, may incorporate similar companies  
in the United States; and that, too, not under the  
! idea of regulating trade, but under that of borrowing  
money.  
Private capitals aro the chief resources for loans to  
the British Government. Whatever, then, may be  
conceived to favor the accumulation ofccpitals, may  
be done by Congress. They may incorporate ma­  
nufacturers. They may give monopolies in every  
branch of domestic industry.  
  
If, again, Congress, by virtue of the power  
row money, can create the ability to lund, to­  
by virtue of the power to levy money, create  
lity to pay it. The ability to pay taxes depe  
the general w ealth of the society ; and this on  
neral prosperity of agriculture, manufactur.  
commerce. Congress then, may give bounti  
make regulations on all of these objects.  
The States have, it is allowed on all hands  
current right to lay and collect tuxes. This  
is secured to them, not by its being expressly  
ed, but by its not being ceded by the Const  
The reasons for the bill cannot be admitted, L  
they would invalidate that right. Why may  
be conceived by Congress, that an uniform a  
elusive imposition of taxes would not, less th  
proposed Bank, “be conducive to the successl  
ducting of the national finances, and tend to gi  
cility to the obtaining of revenue for the use  
Government?”  
The doctrine of implication is always a tendi  
The danger of it has been felt in other Governi  
The delicacy was felt in the adoption of our  
the danger may also be felt, if wc do uot keej  
to our chartered authorities.  
Mark the reasoning on which the validity &lt;  
bill depends. To borrow money is made the  
and the accumulation of capituls implied a  
means. The accumulation of capitals is the  
end, and a Bunk implied as the means. The  
is then the end, and the charter of incorporati  
monopoly, capital punishments, &amp;c. impled a  
means.  
If implications, thus remote, and thus multi|  
can be linked together, a chain may be former  
will reach every object of legislation, every o  
within the whole compass of political economy.  
The latitude of interpretation required by the  
is condenced by the rule furnished by the Con;  
tion itself.  
Congress have power “ to regulutc the valu  
money yet it is expressly added, not left to be.  
plied, that counterfeits may be punished.  
They have the power “to declare warto w  
armies are more incident, than incorporated Bi  
to borrowing; yet is expressly added, the powei  
raise and support armies;” and to this, again, the  
press power “to make rules and regulations for  
government of armies ” A like remark is app  
ble to the powers as to a navy.  
  
more appurtenant to war than the proposed Ban  
borrowing; yet the former is not left to construct  
It is not pretended that every insertion or omis:  
in the Constitution is the effect of systematic at  
tion. This is not the character of any human w«  
particularly the work of a body of men. The  
amples cited, with others that might be added, si  
ciently inculcate, nevertheless, a rule of interpn  
tation very different from that on which the bill re  
They condemn the exercise of any power, parti  
larly a great and important power, which is not  
dently and necessarily involved in an express pow  
It cannot be denied that the power proposed to  
exercised is an important power.  
As a charter, or incorporation, the bill creates  
artificial person, previously not existing in law.  
confers important civil rights and attributes, wh  
could not otherwise he claimed. It is, though 1  
precisely similar, at least equivalent, to the natur  
ization of an alien, by which certain new civil of  
racters are acquired by him. WoulJ Congress ha  
had the power to naturalize, if it had not been c  
plessly given?  
In the power to make by-laws, the bill delegatee  
sort of legislative power, which is, unquestionabl  
an act of a high and important nature, lie took n  
tice of the only restraint on the by-laws, that the  
were not to le contrary to the law and the constit  
tion of the Bank; and asked what law was intendeij  
Ifthe law of the United States, the scantiness of the  
code would give a power never before given to a co  
poralion—and obnoxious to the States, whose law  
would then be suspended, not only by the laws .  
Congress, but by the hy-latcs of a corporation, with  
their own jurisdiction. If the law intended was th&#x27;  
law of the State, then the States might make law|  
that would destroy an institution of the U. State.  
The bill gives a power to purchase and hold landel  
Congress themselves could not purchase lands with  
in a State, “without the consent of its Legislature.’  
IIow could they delegate a power to others, which  
they did not possess themselves ? It takes from ou  
successors, who have equal rights with ourselves!  
and, with the aid of experience, will be more capable  
of deciding on the subject, an opportunity ofexercis!  
ing that right for an immoderate term.  
It takes from our constituents the opportuniny ol  
deliberating on the untried measure, although theii  
hands are also to be tried by it for the same term  
It involves a monopoly, which affects the equal  
rights of every eitizen.  
It leads to a penal regulation, perhaps capital pun  
ishments, one of the most solemn acts of sovereign  
authority.  
From this view of the power of incorporation ex  
crcised in the bill, it could never be deemed an ac­  
cessory or a subaltern power to be deduced by im­  
plication, as a means of executing another power; it  
was, in its nature, a distinct, an independent and  
substantive prerogative, which, not being enumerated  
in the Constitution, could never have been meant to  
be included in it; and, not being included, could ne­  
ver be rightfully exercised.  
He here adverted to a distinction, which he said  
had not been sufficiently kept in view, between a  
power necessary and proper for the government or  
Union, and a power necessary and proper for execu­  
ting the enumerated powers. In the latter case, the  
powers included in each of the enumerated powers,  
were not expressed, but to be drawn from the nature  
of each. In the former, the powers composing the  
government were expressly enumerated. This con­  
stituted the peculiar nature of the government. No  
  
power, mererore, not enumerated, could ue inierrea  
from the general nature of government. Had the  
power of making treaties, for example, been omitted,  
however necessary it might have been, the defect  
could only have been lamented, or supplied by an  
amendment of the Constitution.  
But the proposed Bank could not even be called  
necessary to the government; at most it could be but  
convenient. Its uses to the government could be  
supplied by keeping the taxes a little in advance—by  
loans from individuals—by the other Banks, over  
which the government would have equal command,  
nay, greater, as it may grant or refuse to these the  
privilege, made a free aqd irrevocable gift to the  
proposed Bank, of using their notes in the Federal  
revenue.  
He proceeded next to the contemporary exposi­  
tions given to the Constitution.  
The defence against the charge founded on the  
want of a Bill of Rights, presupposed, he said, that  
the powers not given were retained, and that those  
given were not to be extended by remote implica­  
tions. On any other snpposition the power of Con­  
gress to abridge the freedom of the press, or the  
rights of conscience, &amp;c.. could not have been dis­  
proved.  
The explanations of the State Conventions, all  
turned on the same fundamental principles, and on  
the principle that the terms necessary and -proper  
gave no additional powers to those enumerated.—  
[ Here he read sundry passages from the debates of  
the Pennsylvania, Virginia and North Carolina Con­  
ventions, shewing the grounds on which the Consti­  
tution had been vindicated by its principal advocates,  
against a dangerous latitude of its powers, charged  
on it by its opponents.] He did not undertake to  
vouch for the accuracy or authenticity of the publi­  
cations which he quoted ; he thought it probable that  
the sentiments delivered might, in many instances,  
have been mistaken, or imperfectly noted; but the  
complexion of the whole, with what he himself and  
many others must recollect, fully justified the use he  
had made of them.  
The explanatory declarations and amendments ac­  
companying the ratifications of the several States,  
formed a striking evidence, wearing the same com­  
plexion. He referred those who might doubt on  
the subject, to the several acts of ratification.  
The explanatory amendments proposed by Con­  
gress themselves, at least, would he good authority  
with them; all these renunciationsofpower proceeded  
on a rule of construction, excluding the latitude now  
contended for? These explanations Were the more  
to be respected, as they had not only been proposed  
by Congress, but ratified by nearly three-fourths of  
the States. He read several of the articles propos­  
ed, remarking particularly on the 11th and 12th: the  
former as guarded against a latitude of interpretation;  
the latter as excluding every source of power not  
within the Constitution itself.  
With all this evidence of the sense in which the  
Constitution was understood, and adopted, will it not  
be said, if the hill should pass, that its adoption was

brought about by one set of arguments, and that it is  
now administered under the influence ofanother set:  
and this reproach will have the keener sting, because  
it is applicable to so many individuals concerned in  
both the adoption aud the administration. In fine, if  
the power were in the Constitution, the immediate  
exercise of it cannot be essential; if not there, the  
exercise of it involves the girt of usurpation, and es­  
tablishes a precedent of interpretation levelling all  
the barriers which limit the powers of the General Go­  
vernment, and protect those of the State Governments.  
If the point be doubtful only, respect for ourselves,  
who ought to shun the oppearance of precipitancy  
and ambition. Respect for our successors, who ought  
not lightly to be deprived of the opportunity of exer­  
cising the rights of legislation ; respect for our con­  
stituents, who have had opportunity of making  
known their sentiments, and who are themselves to  
be bound down to the measure for so long a period ;  
all these considerations require that the irrevocable  
decision should at least be suspended until another  
session.  
It appeared on the whole, he concluded, that the  
power exercised by the bill was condemned by the  
silence of the Constitution ; was condemned by the  
rule of interpretation arising out of the Constitution ;  
was condemned by its tendency to destroy the main  
character of the Constitution ; was condemned by  
the exposition of the friends of the Constitution, while  
depending before the public; was condemned by the  
apparent intention of the purties which ratified the  
Constitution ; was condemned by the explanatory a­  
inendments proposed by Congress themselves to the  
Constitution ; and he hoped it would receive its final  
condemnation by the vote of this house.

actually prohibiting the circulation  
of notes payable to bearer.

criterion of the power of Congress.  
  
If tha power was not riven, Coii-i,

Mr. Madison Jbegan with fa general review of the  
advantaged and disadvantages of Banks. TheJormcr  
, he statefto consistin, first-the aids they ardto  
: merchants, who can thereby push .thwBfljMBg  
operations farther with the same capital; 2d, the ads  
;. to merchants in paying punctua ly the customs&#x27;, 3d,  
m aids to th.e Government irr complying punctuaUy with  
  
ta Anmmonfa whp.n deficiencies or aeiays iiappen

xrirf, K of the cold and silver kept m the vaults,  
Anrpnrnted bv notes ; 6th, in facilitating occa  
sional remittances from different places where notes  
Wmen to circulate. The effect of the proposed  
Bank in! raisins the value of stock, he thought had  
been greatly, overrated. . It would, no doubt, raise  
that of the stock subscribed in the Bank: but could  
have little effect on the stock in general, as the? interest  
on it would remain the same, and the quantity taken  
; out of the market would be replaced by Bank stock.  
iThe principal disadvnCages consisted in, first  
banishing the precious jnetals, by substituting ano-  
1 was inpvitnKlp ft wa ailmittfi1 hv the most&#x27;enliffht  
thp mpriiiim tn wr nrm thir nttiCfi. 1 Ills t-ncow  
cried patrons of Banks, particularly by Smith, on the  
jWeaitn ot Nations. 1 he common aiiswei w  
jeetion, was, that the money banished was only an  
exchange for something equally valluable that would  
be iraported.in return. :. He admitted the weight of  
thfe observation, in general, but doubted wnetner, m  
the present habits of this country, the refirn would  
not be in articles of no permanent use to it. Zd, fix-  
tvosins the public and individuals to all the evils 01 a

mpnt nf thp. institution; an unfavorable balance ot  
trade? from short crops, &amp;c.  
V- It&#x27;was proper to be considered, also, that the most  
imoortant of the advantages would be better obtained  
by several Banks properly distributed, than by a sin­  
gle one.&quot; Tiie aids to commerces could only be afford  
ed at or verv near the seat of the Bank. The same  
.was true of aids to merchants in the payment of cus­  
toms. Anticirations of the government would also  
be most convenient at the. different places where the  
interest of the debt was to be 1 paid. The case in  
America was different from that of England. The  
interest there was -all due at one place, and the ge  
nius of , the monarchy favored the concentration o:  
wealth and influence at the metropolis,  
f 1 He thought the plan liable to other objections  
did not make so frood a bargain for the public, as was  
t tin to : its intp.resrtR. The charter to the Bank of  
England had been granted for eleven years only, and  
was paid for by a loan to the Uoveriimem, on terms  
better than could be elsewhere got. Every re­  
newal of the charter had in lite manner, been  
purchased; in some instances at a very high  
.5Lf 1 Tli nma o A Kooti fin np liv thfi Banks  
, uitvc. i luc aaiu iiuu j  
of Genoa, Naples, and other like Banks of cir  
culation. The plan was unequal to the public  
creditors it gave an undue preference to the  
holders of a particular denomination of the  
public debt, and to those-al arid within reach  
of the seat of Government. If the subscrip  
tions, should be rapid, the distant holders of  
paper-would be excluded altogether. (  
, In ?naking these remarks on the merits of  
the bill, he had reserved to himself, he f aid, the  
right to deny the authority of Congress to pass  
it. 7e had entertained this opinion from the  
date of the Constitution. His impressioi  
mightf perhaps, be the stronger, because ii  
&quot;wkll recollected, .that &quot;a power to grai  
E  
charters of incorporation had been &#x27;proposed  
i?i general convention, and rejected.  
&#x27; Is&#x27;thc nower of establishing an incorporated  
.Barajfc&#x27;amotig the powers vested by ti Consti­  
I tution in the legislature of ihe United States?  
This is the question to be examined. After  
ome general remarks on the limitations of all  
political powei, he took notice of the peculiar  
manner in vhich the Federal Government is  
limited. It is not a general grant out of which  
particular powers are excepted. It is a grant  
of particular powers only, leaving the general  
mass in other hands. , oo it had been under­  
stood by its friends and its foes, and so it was  
to be interpreted. .  
-As preliminaries to aright interpretation,  
he1 laid dovn the following rules :  
An interpretation that destroys the very  
characteristic of the Government, canriotbo just.  
- &#x27; Where a meaning is clear, the consequences,  
. Trlifvfr. Vpv Thau Vif. n&quot;r tn li nrlmittfl &#x27;-  
- TVhere doubtful, it is fairly triable by its con­  
sequences.. j  
In controverted cases, the meaning of the  
, parties to the instrument, if to be collected by  
- j reasonable evidence,: is a proper guide.  
; Contemporary and concurrent expositions are a  
f - j reasonable evidence of the meaning ol the parties  
In admitting or rejecting a constructive au­  
l thority not only the degree of its incideiitality  
to an, express authority is to be regarded, but  
&#x27; the degree of rts importance also since, - on  
this will depend the probability or improba  
bility of its being left to construction-  
Reviewing the Constitution with an eve to  
these positions, it was not possible to discover  
r in it the power to incorporate a Bank. The  
onlyf classes under which such a power could  
be pretended, are either  
?&#x27; 1st, The power to lay and collect taxes, to  
pay&quot; the debts and provide for the common de  
fence and general welfare ; or, &#x27; I &#x27;  
i l2d The power to borrow money on the ere  
dit of the United States ; or, f  
3d, the power to pass all laws necessary and  
. proper to carry into execution those powers.  
The bill did not come within the first power.  
It laid no tax to pay the debts or provide for  
the general welfare. It laid no tax whatever.  
It was altogether foreign to the subiect.  
No argument could be drawn from the terms  
common defence and sreneral welfare. The  
PTer as to these general purposes, was limi  
ted to acts laying taxes for them; arid the gen  
&quot; Purposes therhselves were limited and ex-  
plamedby the particular enumerattenisubjoined.

j. &#x27;1st.&#x27; The proposed Bank would Interfere so  
fcrf indirectly .to defeat a State Bank at the  
same place, . I  
2d. ft would directly interfere with the right?  
  
TT J  
  
of the States id prohibit, as well as to establish  
Banks, and the circulation of Bank notes. He  
mentioned; a law of Virginia actually prbhibi-  
irig the circulation of notes payable to bearer.  
3d. Interference with the power of the States  
was no constitutional criterion of the power of  
Congress. If the power was j not given, Con  
gress could not exercise it ; if given, they migm  
exercise it, although it should mteriere w  
the laws or even the constitution of the ies.  
4th. If Congress could incorporate a Bank,  
merely because the act would leave the Mates  
n Ranks alSO, aiiy umti v,va-  
miirht be made by Uongress. laey  
wouldincorporate companies of manufacturers  
nr rJmrtnniKs for cutting canals or even reli  
gious societies, leaving similar incorporations  
bv the States, hkc um &quot; ,  
rntrrp mizht even establish religious teach  
ers in every parish, and pay them out of the  
Treasury of the United States, leaving . Other  
teachers unmolested in their functions. These  
inadmissible consequences condemned the com  
tro verted principle. The&quot; case of the Bank es  
tablished by the former Congress, had been  
cited as a precedent. This tods known, he said,  
to have been the child of necessity. It never  
could be justified by the regular powers of the  
articles of confederation. Congress betrayed  
a consciousness of this, in recommending to  
the States to incorporate the Bank also. They  
did not attempt to protect the Bank notes by  
penalties against counterfeiters. These were  
reserved wholly to the authority of the States.  
The second clause to be examined, is that  
which empowers Congress to borrow money.  
Is this a bill to borrow money f It does not  
borrow a shilling ! Is there any fair construc  
tion by which the bill can be deemed an  
exercise of the power to borrow money? The  
obvious meaning of the power to borrow mo­  
ney is that of accepting it from, and stipula­  
ting payment to those who are able and willing  
to Tend. To say that the power to borrow,  
involves a power of creating: the abiliy, where  
there may be Hhe willt ? lend, is not only es  
tablishing a dangerous principle, as will be  
immediately shewn, but is as forced a construc­  
tion as to say,ahat it involves the power, of  
compelling the will, where there may be the  
ability to lend. &#x27;: i;  
The third clause is that which gives the pow-,  
er to pass all laws necessary and proper to ex­  
ecute the specified powers.  
Whatever meaning this clause may have,  
none can be admitted, that would give an un­  
limited discretion to Congress. Its meaning  
must, according to the natural and obvious  
force of the terms, and the context, be limited  
to means necessary to the end and incident to  
the return of the specified powers.  
The clause is in fact, merely declaratory of  
what would have resulted by unavoidable im  
plication as the appropriate, and, as it were,  
technical means of executing those powers.  
In this sense it had been explained by the  
friends of the Constitution, and ratified by the  
State Conventions. &#x27;  
The essential characteristic of the Govern­  
ment, as composed of limited and enumerated  
powers, would be destroyed, if, instead of di­  
rect and incidental means, j any means could  
be used, which in the language of the preamble  
of the bill, &quot; might be conceived to beCondu­  
cive to the successful conducting of the finan­  
ces; or, might be conceived to tend to give fa­  
cility to the obtaining of loans.&quot; . He urged  
an attention to the diffuses and ductile terms  
  
which had been found requisite to cover thefduced by implication as a means of executin

stretch of power contained in the bill. He  
compared them with the terms necessary arid  
proper, used in the Constitution, and asked  
whether it wa3 possible to view the two des­  
criptions as synonymous, or the one as a fair  
and safe commentary on the other?  
If, proceeded he, Congress, by virtue of the  
power to borrow, can create the means oi lend­  
ing, and in pursuance of these means can in­  
corporate a Bank, they may dojany thing what  
ever, creative of like means.  
The East India Company: has been. a lender  
to the British Government, as well as the Bank,  
and the South Sea Company is a greater cred­  
itor than either Congress, then, may incor­  
porate similar companies in the United States ;  
and that, too, not under the idea of regulating  
trade, but under that of borrowing money.  
Private capitals are the chief resources for  
loans to the &quot;British Government. Whatever,  
then, may be conceived to favor the accumu  
lation of capitals, may be done by.Congress.  
They may incorporate manufacturers. They  
may give monopolies-in every branch of do  
mestic industry.  
If again, &#x27;Congres by virtue of the power  
to borrow money, can create the ability -to. Zen a,  
they may by virtue ofthe power to levy money,  
create the ability to pay it. The ability to  
pay taxes depends on the general wealth of the  
society; and this on the general prosperity of  
agriculture, manulacturres, and commerce.  
Congress then, nqtay give bounties, and make  
regulationr on all ol these objects.  
The States have, it is allowed on all hands, a  
concurrent right to lay and collect taxes. This  
power is secured to them, not by its being ex  
pressly reserved, but by its not being ceded by  
the Constitution. The reasons for the bill  
cannot be admitted, because they would inval  
idate that right. Why may it not be conceived  
by Congress, that an uniform and exclusive  
imposition of taxes would not, less than the  
proposed Bank, &quot;be conducive to the successful  
conducting of the national finances, and tend  
to give facility to the obtaining of revenue for  
the use ofthe Government?&quot;  
The doctrine of implication is always a ten  
der one. The danger; of it has been felt iri  
other Governments. The delicacy was felt  
in the adoption of our own ; the danger may  
aiso De leu, ii we ao not Keep ciose to our  
chartered authorities. t  
Mark the reasoning on which the validity of  
the bill depends. To borrow money is made  
the end, and the accumulation of capitals im  
vlied as the means. The accumulation of  
capitals is then the end, and a Bank implied as  
the means. The Bank is then the end, and the  
charter oft incorporation, a monopoly, capital

to

given  
In the power to make by-laws, the bill dele  
gated a sort of legislative power, which is,  
unquestionably, an act of a high and important  
nature. He took notice of the only restraint  
on the by-laws, that they were not to be contra­  
ry to the law and constitution of the Bank; and  
asked what law was intended ? Ifthelawof the  
United States, the scantiness of their code would  
give a power never before given to a corporation  
and obnoxious to the States, whose laws  
would then be superseded, not only by the  
laws of Congress, . but by the by-laws jof a  
rnrnoration. within -their own iurisdiction.  
- f 7 r f  
If the law intended was the law ofthe State,  
then the States might make laws that would  
destroy an institution of the United States. :  
The&#x27; bill gives a power to purchase and hold  
lands. Congress themselves could not purchase  
lands within a State, &quot;without the consent of  
its Legislature.&quot; How. could they delegate a  
power to others, which they did not possess  
themselves? It takes from our successors,  
who have equal rights with ourselves, and,  
with the aid of experience, will be more capable  
Of deciding on the subject, an opportunity of  
exercising that right for an immoderate term.  
It takes from. our constituents the opportuni­  
ty of deliberating on the untried measure, al-  
though their hanus are also to be tied by it for  
the same term.  
It involves a monopoly, which affects the  
equal rights of every citizen.  
It leads to a penal regulation, perhaps capi­  
tal punishments, one of the most solemn acts  
of sovereign authority. r ;  
From this view ofthe power of incorporation  
exercised in the bill, it could never be deemed  
an &#x27;accessory or&#x27;a subaltern power to be de-  
J A  
another power ; it was, in its nature, a distinct,  
an independent and substantive prerogative,  
which, not being enumerated in the Constitu  
tion, could never have been meant to be inclu­  
ded in it ; and, not being included, could never  
be rightfully exercised. &#x27;  
He here adverted to a distinction, which he  
said had not been sufficiently kept in view, be  
tween a power necessary and proper for the  
government or Union, and a power necessary  
and proper for executing the enumerated pow­  
ers. In the latter case, the powers included in  
each of the enumerateVi powers, were not ex  
pressed, but to he drawn from the nature of  
each. In the former, the powers composing  
the government were expressly enumerated.  
This constituted the peculiar nature ofthe gov­  
ernment. No power, therefore, not enumera­  
ted, could be inferred from the general nature  
of government. Had the power of making  
treaties, for example, been omitted, however  
necessary it might have been, the defect could  
only have been lamented, or supplied by an a­  
mendment ofthe Constitution.  
But the proposed Bank could not even be  
called necessary to the government; at most it  
could be but convenient. Its uses to the j gov­  
ernment could be supplied by keeping the taxes  
a little in advance: by loans from individuals  
by the other Banks, over which the government  
would have equal command, nay, greater! as it  
may grant or refuse to these the privilege,  
made a -free and irrevocable gift to the proposed  
Bank,ofusing their notes in the Federal revenue.  
He proceeded next to the contemporary ex  
positions given to the Constitution.  
The defence against the charge founded on  
the want of a Bill of Rights, presupposed, he  
said, that the powers not given were retained,  
and that those given were not to be extended  
br remote implications. On any other suppo­  
sition, the power of Congress to abridge the  
lreedom ofthe press or the rights of consci  
ence, &amp;c, could not have been disproved. ,  
The explanations in the State Conventions,  
all turned on the same fundamental principles,  
and on the principle that the terms necessary  
and proper gave no additional powers to I those  
enumerated. Here he read sundry passages  
irom tne debates oi tne rennsylvania, Virginia,  
and North Carolina Conventions, shewing the  
grounds on which the Constitution had j been  
vindicated by its principal advocates, against a  
dangerous latitude of its powers, charged on it  
by its opponents. He did not undertake to  
vouch for the accuracy or authenticity of the  
publications which he quoted; he thought it  
Probable that the sentiments delivered might,  
in many instances, have been mistaken, pr im  
perfectly noted; but the complexion of the  
whole, with what he himself and many others  
must recollect, fully justified the use he had  
made of them.  
The explanatory amendments proposed by  
cougresa tnemselyes, at least, would be good  
autnonty witn tnem ; all these renunciations  
of power proceeded on a rule of construction,  
excluding the latitude now contended for.

Mr. Madison began tviilt a general review «| the V,|.

staled to conslrt, in, fust, the aids they afTonI to merchants

6 h. in facilitating occasional remitl.uu-es t om different  
places where notes happen to circulate. The ellerlol thr  
proposed bank, in raising the value of stork, he thought  
had been greatly overrated. It would no doubt ra,*c That

was admittedly the most enlightened patrons of Hanks­

common answer lo the objection was, that the money

valuable that would be imported in return, lie admi&#x27;

been sufficiently kept in view between a power neee»«aiy  
and proper lor • lie Government or Union, and a power ne­  
cessary and proper tor ext-cu&#x27;lng the enumerated powers.  
In the latter case, the powers included in each ol the  
enuuieiated powers, were not expressed, but to be drawn  
from the nature ot each. In the loriuer, &#x27;he powers com­  
posing the Government were expressly enumerated.  
Hus constituted the peculiar nature ol the Government:  
no power then fore not enumerated, rould be Interred lioin  
the general nature ot Government. Had the power ol  
in.&#x27;kmg treaties, lor example, been omitted, howevci ne­  
cessary it might have been, the defect could only have  
been laiiicuicd, 01 supplied by an amend men&#x27; to the Con*  
atituiiuu.  
Hut the proposed bank could not even be called neces­  
sary to tlie government; at most it could he but cimve  
men&#x27;. Its uses to the government could be supplied by  
keeping the taxes a little in advance—by loans Irom mill  
&#x27;•duals—by the other h»nk.s, over which the government  
would have equal command; nay, greater, aa it may grant  
or relu-e to the»e the piiviicgc, made a Iree and inevoc.i

Federal revenue.  
lie proceeded next to the cotemporary expositions given  
to the Con-titu&#x27;ion.  
&#x27;1 lie delence against the charge founded on the want ol  
a bill of rights, pre supposed, lie said, that the jowei* not  
given were letained; and that those given w ere not to lie  
extended by remote implications. On any other suppo-i­  
lion, the power of Congress to abridge the Irecdom ol the  
pie-s, or the rights ol conscience, fee. could not have hem  
disproved.  
Tim explanations in tlie State conventions all turned on  
tlie saint lumlatnnial principles, and on the p&gt;inciple that  
the term* necessary and proper gave no additional powers  
to those enumerated. [Here lie read sundry passages from  
Hie debate* ol the Pennsylvania, Virginia and N. Caroli*  
na con Vent.ons, ‘hewing the grounds on which the Consti*  
tution had been vindicated by its principal advocates  
against a dangerous latitude ol its powers, rhaiged on u  
| by its opponents ] He did not undertake to vouch for he  
a-cm acy &lt;u authenticity ol the publications which l.e quo  
j tt-‘d he thought it probahlo that the sentiment&#x27; delivered  
! tuight, in many instances, have been mistaken, or Imper­  
leciiy noted ; hut (he complexion of (lie whole, with what  
lie Idniscll ami many otiiers must recollect, fully justified  
the u-e lie had made ot them.  
The explanatory &lt;l&lt; claraiions and amendments arrompa­  
; riying the r atilira ion* ol lliesevcr.il States lorm. d a sink  
ing evidence, wearing the same complexion. He retired  
those who tn&#x27;ght doubt on the subject, to the scve.al ads  
ol ratification.  
  
I lie explanatory amendments proposed by Cong re &lt;s  
themselves, at least, woiil.l In- goo I authority w itl&gt; them:  
all these renunciations of power proceeded on a rule of  
construction, excluding the lati ude now contended for.

by nearly three-louitha of (ho SU^e*. rfc I&#x27;ll*  
ol the. articles proposed, rental king particularly on the lVh  
ami lib: lite loruier, as guarding against a latitude ol  
interpretation; the latter, as excluding every source oi  
power not within the Constitution itscll.  
&quot;HU ail this evidence ot the sense in winch (lie Con­  
stitution was understood ami adopted, will it not lie said  
il (lie bill should p»-s, that its adoption was brought ahuui  
hy one set ol arguments, ami that it is now aihnil.ist. red  
under the influence ol another set; ami this reproach will  
have the keener s ing, berat.se il is applicable to so many  
individuals, concerned in both the a (option and the ad­  
ministration.  
in hue, il the power were in the Constitution, the Im­  
mediate exercise ot it cannot be essential - ii not tlicie,  
the exercise ol it involves the gmh ol usurpation, ami  
establishes a precedent ol interpretation, levelling ail the  
harriers which limit the powers ol I lie General Govern­  
ment, and protect those ol the St te Govc^ncnts. il  
the point lie doubtful only, respect for ourWves. w ho  
ought to shun the appearance of precipitancy and atnhi­  
lion; raped for our successors, who oiiglr. not lightly to  
be deprived of lire opportunity ol exercising the tighis of  
legislation; respect lor onr constituents, who have had no  
opportunity ol making know n their sentiments, and whn  
are themselves to tie Hound down to the measure fur so  
loi g a period; all these considerations requite that (lie ir­  
revocable decision should at least he suspended until ano­  
ther se.-sion.  
It appeared on the whole, he concluded, that the power  
exercised .by the bill was condemned hy the silence ot  
the Cons itulion; was condemned by the title of intetpre­  
ta on arising out of the Constitution; tvas condemned hy

Mr. Maoiaow begau with a general review of lh? ad­  
vantages and disadvantages of banka The former he  
etatea to conaiat in. Fir it The aula they afford to  
merchanta, who can thereby puah their mercantile ope­  
ration* farther with the aame capital. Second The  
aida to merchants in paying punctually, the cuatonia ?  
Third. Aida to the Government, in complying punc,  
tually with its engagements, when deficiencies and de­  
laya happen in the revenue. Fourth In diminishing  
usury. Fifth. In saving the wear of gold and silver,  
kept in vaults, and repreeented by notea. Sixth In  
facilitating ot^asional retnitlanrea from different placea  
where notea happen to circulate. The effect hi the  
proposed bank in raiairig the value of stock, he thought,  
. had been greatly overrated. It no doubt would raise  
that uf stock subscribed into the bank, but could liave  
little effect on atock in general, as the interest on it  
would remain the same, and the quantity taken out of  
the market would be replaced by tho bank stock.  
The principal disadvantage consisted in, First, Ban­  
ishing trie precious metals, by substituting another me­  
dium to perform the office. Thia effect was inevitable.  
It waa admitted by the most enlightened patrons of  
banka, particularly by Smith en the Wealth ol Nationa  
The common ans ver to the objection was, thst the mo­  
ney liamshed was only an exchange for something  
equally valual&gt;k&gt;, that would be imported in return. He  
admitted the weight of tlua observation, in general, but  
doubled wliclhcr, nr the present habits of this country,  
&quot;the return would not be in srticles of no permanent use  
to it. Second, E.t|&gt;oatng the public and individuala to  
?II the evils of a run on the hank, which would be parti- r  
cularly calamitous in so great a country as this, and  
might happen from various causes, as lalse rumors, bad  
management of liic institution, an unfavorable balance  
of trade, from short crops, 6tc. It was proper to be  
considered, also, that the moat important ol the advan­  
tages would be better obtained by several hanks, pro­  
perly distributed, than by a single one. The aids to  
commerce could onlv be afforded at, or verjr near the  
seat of the bank. The same was true of aids to mer­  
chants in the payment of customs. Anticipations of  
the Government, would, also, be meat convenient at  
the different places where the ukterest of the debt was  
to be paid. The case in America was different from  
that in England ; the interest there was all due at oiie  
place, and the genius of the monarchy favored the con­  
centration of wealth and influence at the metro|&gt;olis  
He thought tlie plan liable to other objections; il  
did not make so good a bargain for liio public as waa  
due its interests. The charter to the Bank of England  
had been granted only for eleven years, and was paid  
for by a loan to the Government, on terms lictter than  
could be elsewhere got. Every renewal of the charter  
had, in like manner, been purchased ; in some instances  
at a very high price. -The same had been done by the  
banks of Geuoa, Naples, and other like banks of circu­  
lation. The plan was unequal to the public creditors ;  
it gave an undue preference td the holders of ? particu­  
lar denomination ol&#x27; the public debt; and to tlwse at,  
and within reach of the seat ol Government. If the  
subscriptions should be rapid, the distant holders of  
paper would lie excluded altogether.  
In making itiese remarks on the merits of the bill, he  
had reserved to himself, he said, the right to deny the  
authority of Congress to pass. He had entertained this  
opinion from the dale of the Constitution. His impres­  
sions might, perhaps, be the stronger, because he well  
recollected that a power to grant charters ol incorpora­  
tion had been proposed in ihe general convention, and  
rejected. Is tho power of establishing an incorporated  
bank among the powers vested by the Constitution, in  
the legislature of the L&#x27;uiled Stales! This is the  
question to be-examined..  
After some general remarks on the Limitations of all  
political power, he took notice of the peculiar manner in  
which the Federal Government is limited. It is not  
only a general grant out ol which particular powers,  
arc excepted ; it is a grant of parlioular powers, leaving  
the general mass in other hands. So it had been un­  
deisiood by its friends and its loes ; and so it was to  
be interpreted.  
As preliminaries to a right interpretation, be laid  
down the following rules :  
An interpretation that destroys the very characteristic  
of the Government cannot be just.  
Where a meaning is clear, the consequences, what­  
ever thev may be, are to be admitted; whatever they  
may lie, are to be admitted ; where doubtful, it is fairly  
triable by its consequences ,  
In contioverted cues, the meaning of the parties to  
the instrument, if lo be collected by reasonable evi­  
dence, is a proper guide.  
Contemporary and current expositions are a reasona­  
ble evidence ot the meaning of tne parties.  
In admitting or rejecting a constructive authority,  
not-only tne degree ol its incideota&#x27;ltly to an express  
authority is to Ue.Tcgarded, but the degree of its impor­  
tance also ; since on this will depend me probablity or  
improbability of us being lcll to construction.  
Reviewing the constitution with an eye to these po­  
sitions, it was not possible to discover ill it tho power  
lo incorporate a bank. I tie only clauses under whicli  
such power could tie pretended, was either.  
First. The power to lay and collect taxes to pay the  
debts and provide lor the common defence and general  
weitare ; or, v  
Second. The power to borrow money on tho credit  
of the United States, or,  
Third, i&#x27;iie po.ver to pass all laws ncccssary to car­  
ry into execution those powers.  
Tlie hill did not come within the first power. It laid  
no tax to pay the debts, or provide lor tne general wei­  
tare. Il laid no lax whatever. It was altogether for­  
eign to the subject.  
No argument could be drawn from the terms &quot; com­  
mon delence and general weitare.&quot; The power as to  
these general purposes was limited to sets laying taxes  
for the in; and tlie general purposes themselves were  
limited and explained by the particular enumerations  
subjoined. To understand these terms in any sense  
that would justify the power m question, would give to  
Congress an unlimited power ; would render nugatory  
the enumeration ol particular powers; would supersede  
all the powers reseived lo liio state governments.-?  
These terms are copied from lUe articles ol confedera­  
tion ; had it ever been pretended that they were to be  
understood otherwise than as here explained ! It had  
been said, that &quot; general weitare&quot; ineaiil cases in which  
a general power iingnt be exercised by Congress, with­  
out interlcnng with me power of the stales ; and that  
the establishment of a National Bunk was of this sort.  
There were, he said, several answers lo this novel doc­  
trine.  
First. Tlie proposed bank would interfere, so as in­  
directly to deleal a slate bank al the same place.  
Second 11 would directly interfere with tne rights of  
states 10 prohibit, as well as lo eslablish, banks, and  
Ihe circulation of bank notes He mentioned a law ot  
| V&#x27;irgtuia, actually prohibiting the circulation ol notes  
puy^iiic to bearer.  
Third. Interference with the powers of the folates  
was no constitutional criterion of the power of Con­  
gress. Il the power was not given, Congress could not  
exercise it; it given, they might exercise it, although  
it should ititurlere with tlie laws, or even the constitu­  
tion, of the stales.  
Fourth If Congress could incorporate a bank, merely  
because the act would leave the slates free to establish  
banks also, any otner incorporation might be made by  
Congress. They could not incorporate companies of  
manutacturers, or companies for culling canals, or even  
for reiigious societies, leaving similar incorporations by  
the slates, like state banks, to themselves; Congress  
might even establish religious teachers in every&#x27;parish,  
and pay them put of the treasury of llie United Mates,  
leaving other teachers unmolested in iheir functions.?  
l hc?e inadmissible consequences condemned tho con­  
troverted principle.  
The case ol the bank, established by the former Con­  
gress, had been cited aa a precedent &#x27;l&quot;his wss known,  
he said, to have been the child ol necessity. It never  
could be justibed by the regular powers of the articles  
of confederation. Congiess betrayed a consciousness  
of this, In recommending to tlie slates to incorporate  
the bank also They did not attempt lo protect the  
bank notes. 1st penalties against COO Diet fitters I hese  
were reserved wholly tol^ie authority of the states.  
The second clause to tie examined is that which em­  
powers Congress to borrow money  
Is this a bill to borrow money ? It does not borrow a  
shilling. Ia there any fair construction by which the  
bill can be deemed an exercise of the power to borrow  
money &lt; The obvious meaning ol ihe power to borrow  
money, ia, that accepting paymente from, and stipu­  
lating payments to, those who ire able and mtling to  
lend  
  
To say that the power to borrow involve* the power  
of creating the ability, where there may be the will to  
load, ia not only establishing a dangerous urntple, aa  
will be immediately shewn, but ia aa forced a conetrue­  
tton, aa to **y, that itiuvolve* the power of compelling  
tlie will, where there may be the ability to leud.  
The Ikiri clause ia that which gives the power to  
peas all law* necessary and proper to execute the (pa­  
cified powers. *&quot;  
Whatever meaning this clauae may have, none can  
be admitted that would give an unlimited discretion to  
Cougrese -  
lis meaning must, according to the natural and obri?  
oiis force of the terms and the context, be limited to  
mean* ne&lt; e**ari/ to the end, and inn4tnt to tho nature,  
of the specified powers.  
The clause is, in fsct. merely declaratory of what  
would have resulted, by unavoidable implication, as the  
appropriate, a* it were, technical means of executing  
those powers In this sem? it had been explained, by  
the friends of the constitution, ani ratified by the stale  
conventions.  
The essential characteristic of the government, aa  
composed of limited and enumerated powers, would be  
destroyed, if, instead of direct and incidental means any  
means could be uaed, which, in the language of the pre­  
amble to the bill, might be conceived to oe conducive  
to the auccesaful conducting of the finances, or might  
be eoneeired to tend to give facility to the obtaining of  
loans. He urged sn attention to the diffuse snd ductile  
terms which had been found requisite to cover the  
stretch of power contained in tbe bill. He compared  
them to the terms neeeutry and proper, used in the  
constitution, and asked whether it was possible to view  
the two descriptions as synonymous, or the one aa a  
fair and safe commentary on the other  
If, proceeded be. Congress, by virtue of the power  
to borrow, can create the mean* of lending, and, in pur­  
euance of theae means, can incorporate a bank, they  
uiav do any thing whatever creative of like meana.  
The East India Company haa been a leader to the  
British Government, a* well as the Bank, and the South  
Sea Company is a greater creditor than either. Con­  
Sres* may then incorporate similar companiea in the U.  
tales, and that, too. not under the idea of regulating  
trade, but under that of borrowing money.  
Private capitala are the chicf resources for loans to  
the British Government. Whatever these may be con­  
ceived to favor the accumulation of capital, may be done  
by Congress. They may Incorporate manufacturers.?  
Thev may give monopolies in every branch of domestic  
industry.  
If, again. Congress, by virtue of the power to borrow  
money, ran create the ability to lend, they insy, by vir­  
tue of the power to levy money, create the ability to  
pay it. Tho ability to pay taxes depends on the gen­  
eral prosperity of agriculture, manufacture*, and coin­  
merce. Congress may then give bounties, and make  
regulations on these objects.  
i&#x27;he states have, it is sllowed on all hands, a concurrent  
right to lay and collect taxea. This power is secured to  
them, not bv its being expressly reserved, but tjy its not  
being ceded by the constitution. The reasons for the  
bill cannot be admitted, because they would invalidate  
that right; why may it not be conceived by Congress,  
that a uniform and exclusive irn|X&gt;sitioti of taxes would  
not, less than the proposed bank, be conducive to the  
successful conducting of tho national finances, and tend  
to give facility to the obtaining of a public revenue for  
the use of the Government 1  
The doctrine of implication is always a tender one.?  
Tho danger of it ha?l?een felt in other Government*.?  
The delicacy was felt in the adoption of our own; the  
danger may also be felt if we do not keep close to our  
chartered authorities. m  
Mark the reasoning on which the validity of the bill  
depends. To borrow money is made the end, and the  
accumulation of capital implied a* the meant. The  
accumulation of capital is, then, the end, and a bank  
implied as the mean*. The bank ia then the end, and  
a charter of incorporation, a monopoly, capital punish­  
ments, 6cc. implied a* the mean*.  
If implications, thus remote, and thus multiplied, can  
be linked together, a chain may be formed, that will  
reach every object of legislation, every object within the  
whole compass of political economy.  
The latitude of interpretation required by the bill i*  
condemned by the rule furnished by the constitution  
itself.  
Congress have power &quot; to regulate the value of mo­  
ney,&quot; yet it is expressly added, not left to be implied,  
that counterfeiter* may be punished. They have the  
power&quot; to declare war,&quot; to which armies are more in­  
cident than incorporated banks to Itorrowing. yet it ia  
expressly added, the power &quot;to raise and support ar­  
mies ;&quot; snd to thi* again, the express power, ?&#x27; to make  
rules snd regulations for the government of armie* &#x27; a  
like remark is applicable to-the power* as to a navy.  
The regulation and calling out of the militia are more  
appurtenant to war, than the proposed bank te borrow­  
ing ; yet the former is not left lo construction.  
The very power to borrow money is a les* remote  
implicition fron&gt; the power of war, than an incorpo­  
rated monopoly bank from tlie power of borrowing?yet  
the power to borrow is not left to implication.  
It is not pretended, that every insertion or omi**ion  
? in the constitution is the effect of systematic attention.  
Thi* i* not the character of any human work, particu­  
larly tl?e work of a body of men. The example cited,  
with other* that might be added, eufficictitly inculcate,  
nevertheless, a rule of interpretation very different from  
that on^which the bill rest*. They condemn the exerciea  
of any power, particularly * great *nd important power,  
which is not evidently and necea*anly involved in an  
express power.  
It cannot be denied that the power proposed to be  
exercised, is an important power.  
As a charter of mcorporatioiv-the bill create* *n arti­  
ficial person, previously not existing in Uw. It confer*  
important civil rights and attribute*, which could not  
otherwise be claimed. It .s, although not precisely*  
similar, equivalent to the naturalization of an alien, by  
which certain new civil character* are acquired by him.  
Would Congress have had the power to naturalize, if it  
had not been expressly given 1  
In the power to m*ke bv-lawa, the bill delegated a  
sort of legislative power, which is unqueatibn*hly *n  
?ct of a high and important nature. Ho took uotic* of  
the only restraint on the by-laws, that they were not to  
be contrary to the law and constitution of the bank, *nd  
a?ked. what law was intended ? If tl.e l*w of the U.  
State*, the scantiness of their code would give * power,  
never before given to a corporation, and obnoxioua to  
tho states, whose l?ws would then be superseded, not  
only by the laws of Congrea*. but by the by-law* of ?  
corporation within their own jurisdiction. If th* law  
intended was the law of the (late, then the *t*te might  
make law* that would ifcatroy an institution of the Uui­  
ted State*.  
The bill give* a power to purchase and hold land* :  
Congress could not purchase lands within a Slate,  
&quot; without the consent of its Legislature.&quot; How could  
they delegate a power to other* which they did not poe­  
tess themselve*! ,  
It lakes from our auccessor*, who h*ve equal right*  
with ourselves, and an opportunity of exerciaing that  
right for an immoderate term.  
It takes from our constituent* the opportunity of de­  
liberating on the untried me**ure, although their hand*  
are also to be tied by it. for the Mine tenn.  
It involves a monopoly which effects the equal right*  
of every citixen.  
It leads to a penal regulation, perhaps capiUl puni*h­  
mcnt?one of the mo*t solemn *ct* of sovereign au  
thonty.  
From thi* view of the power of incorporation exer­  
cised hi tbe bill, it never could be deemed *n acce**ory  
or subaltern power, to be deduccd by implication, a* a  
means of executing another jiower. It was in its nature  
a distinct, and independent, *nd *ub*t*nlive preroga­  
tive, which, not being enumerated in the constitution,  
could never have been meant to he included in a, *nd,  
not being included, could never be rightfully exercieed.  
He had sdvcrtcdTto * distinction, which h* **id had  
not been sufficiently kept 111 view, lietween a power na­  
cessaiy and proper for the Government or Union, and a  
power neceseary for executing ihe enumerated power* in  
the latter case ; the |?owvr* included in e*ch of the enume­  
rated i&gt;owcr* were not expressed, but lo l?e drawn from _  
the nature of each. In the former, the jiowsrs composing  
the Government were expressly enumerated. This con­  
stituied ihe peculiar nature ?f the Government; no pow­  
er, therefore, not enumerated, could l&gt;e inferred frourthe  
general nature of Government. Had the power of  
making treaiiea, for example, been omitted, however  
necessary it might hsve been, ihe defect could only hsve  
been lamented, or supplied by an amendment of the con­  
?tiluion.  
But tbe propoaed b*nk could not even be c*lled ne­  
cessary to the Govcrninrtit; at most, it could be but  
convenient. Its uses te the Government could be sup­  
plied by keeping the taxes a litile in advance ; by loane  
from individual*; by the other benk* over which the  
Government would h*ve equ*l command, nay. gmier.  
a* it may grant or refuae te thc*e ihe privilege, m*de a  
free and irrevocable gilt to the proposed b.nk, of using  
their note* in the feaeral revenue.  
He proceeded neit to the contemporary exposition*  
given lo the constitution.  
The defence against ihe charge founded on ihe want: ot

given, were retained , and that those glv??

jMtaooM, have been mistaken, or imperfectly noted ,  
but the completion of the whole, with what he himself,  
and many other* inuat recollect, fully justified the use he

The explanatory declarations and amendments ac­  
companying the ratification* of the several a tales, formed  
a striking evidence, wearing the *ame completion. He  
those who might doubtj to the several acts of

The explanatory amendments, proposed by Congress  
themselves, *1 Icaat, would be good authority with them;  
all these annuncialiona of power proceeded on a rule  
of construction excluding the latitude now contended  
far. The?e explanations were the more to be respect­

but ratified by nearly three-fourths of the States. He  
read several of the articles proposed, remarking particu­

about by one set of arguments, snd that it is now admin­  
istered under the influence of auother act 1 And thia  
reproach will have the keener sting, because it is appli­  
cable to ao many individaals concerned in both the  
adoption and administration.  
In fine, if (he power were in the conatitution, the im­  
mediate exercise of it cannot be esaential; if not there,  
the exerciae of it involvea the guilt of uaurpation, and  
establishes a precedent of interpretation, levelling all the  
barrier* which limit the powers of the General Govern­  
ment and protect those of the Slste governments. If  
the point be doubtful only, respect for our*clve*, who  
ought to shun the sppesrance of precipitancy and ambi­  
tion ; respect for our auccessors, who ought not lightly  
to be deprived of the opportunity of exercising the rights  
of legislation ; respect for our constituents, who hsve  
hsd no opportunity of making known their sentiments,  
and who are thcmaelvea to be bound down to the  
measure for so long a period &#x27; all these considerations  
require that the irrevocable decision should at luaal be  
auspended until another aession.  
It appeared on the whole, he concludtd. that the pow­  
er exercised by the bill was condemned by the silence  
of the constitution ; was condemned by tho rule of in­  
terpretation, arising out of the coustitution ; wss con­  
demned by its tendency to destroy the main character­  
latic of the conatitution ; waa condemned by the exposi­  
tions of the friends of the constitution, whilst depending  
liefore the public ; wss condemned by the apparent in­  
tentions of the parties, which ratified the constitution ;  
was coudemncd by the explanatory amendments pro­  
hy Congress themselves to the constitution ; and  
* he hopea it would receive ita final condemnstioa by the  
vote of this House.

dison said, that &quot;in making these remarks  
on the merits of the bill, he hal reserved  
to himself tho right to deny the authority  
of Congress to pass it. He had enter  
tained this opinion from the due ot the  
Constitution. His impression might be  
stronger, because he well remembered  
that a power to grant charters cf incorpo­  
ration had been proposed in General Con  
vention and rejected.&quot; He continues: &quot;Is  
the power of establishing an incorporated  
bank amonrr the nowers vested by the  
Constitution in the Legislature of the U.  
States? This is tho question to be cxam-  
ncd.&quot; After some general remarks on  
tho limitation of all political powers, he  
took notice of tho peculiar manner in  
which the Federal Government is limited.  
t is a ecneral grant, out of which parti&#x27;  
lar nowers are exceDted. It is a grant of  
particular powers only, leaving a mass in  
. u  
other hands.&quot;  
&quot;As preliminaries to a right interpreta  
tion, ho laid down tho iollowing rules:  
An interpretation that destroys the very  
characteristic of the Government, cannot  
bo just. Where a meaning is plain, the  
consequences whatever they may be, are  
lo bo admitted. Whore doubttut, u is  
fairly triable by its consequences. In ad­  
mitting or rejecting a constructive autho­  
rity, not only the degree of its incidcntal-  
itvto an express authority is to bo regar  
ded, but the-degree of its importanco also;  
since on this will depend the prooaDiiiiy  
of its being loft to construction.&quot;  
&quot;Reviewing the Constitution with an  
eye to these positions it was impossible to  
discover in it the power to incorporate a  
bank. The only clauses under which  
such apowcr could bo claimed are either  
1st, The power to lay and collect taxes,  
to nav debts, and provide for tho common  
defence and general welfare or 2d, The  
power to borrow money on tho credit ot  
tho United States or 3d, The power to  
oass all laws necessary and proper to  
carry into effect these powers.&quot;  
&quot;The bill did not como within ttio nrsi  
.. . .L. J.Li-  
power, it laid no tax to pay mo ueuis or  
provido for the general welfare. No ar­  
guments could be drawn from tho terms  
&quot;common dclonce and general wenare.  
To understand these terms in any sense  
  
that would give tOiCongress an unlimite  
  
power, would render nugatory the cnume  
ration ol particular powers would su­  
persede all the powers reserved to the  
State Governments.&quot;  
&quot;The second clause to bo examined, is  
that which empowers Congress to borrow  
money. Is this a bill to borrow money?  
It does not borrow a shilling. Tho obvi­  
ous moaning of the power to borrow  
money, is that of accepting it from, and  
stipulating payment to, those whoare able  
and willing to lend. To say that tho  
power to borrow involves a power cre  
ating the ability, where there is tho will  
to lend, is not only a dangerous principle,  
but as forced a construction as to say tnut  
it involves the power of compelling the  
will, where there is the ability to lend.&quot;  
&quot;The third clause is that which gives  
the power to pass all laws necessary and  
proper to executethe specified powers.&quot;  
&quot;Whatever meaning tho clause may  
have, none can be admitted that would  
give an unlimited discretion to Congress.  
Its meaning must, according to the natural  
and obvious force of the terms, be limited  
to means necessary to the end, and inci­  
dent to the execution of the special pow  
ers, i no essential characteristic ot the  
government, as composed of limited and  
enumerated powers, would be destroyed,  
if instead of direct and incidental means,  
any means could bo used which, in the  
preamble of the bill, &quot;might be conceived  
to be conducive to the successful conduct­  
ing of the finances, or might be conceived  
to tend to give facility to the obtaining of  
oans.&quot;  
&quot;Ho urged an attention to tho diffuse  
and ductile terms which had been found  
requisite to cover the stretch of power  
contained in tho bill. He compared them  
with the terms &#x27;necessary and proper,&#x27;  
used in tho constitution, and asked whether  
it was possible to view the two descrip  
tions as synonomous?&quot;  
Mr. Midison continues: &quot;lhc doctrine  
of implication is always a tender one.  
The danger of it has been lelt m other  
governments. The delicacy was felt in  
the adoption of our own; and the danger  
may also be felt, if we do not keep close  
TO OUR CHARTERED AUTHORITIES.&quot;  
&quot;If implications, thus remote and thus  
multiplied, can be linked together, a chain  
may be formed mat will renoh, very ob-  
icut ol -leinsiaiion every uujeui . wiuuti  
the whole compass ot political economy.  
He concluded this masterly argument  
by asserting that,1&quot; appeared on tho  
whole that the nower exercised ny tne  
bill was  
4 Condemned by the silence of tho Con  
stitution.  
&quot;Condemned by the rule of interpreta­  
tion arising out of the Constitution.  
&quot;Condemned by its tendency to destroy  
the main characteristic of the Constitution.  
&quot;Condemned by the expositions of the  
friends of the Constitution whilst depend­  
ing before the public.  
&quot;Condemned by tho apparent intention  
of the parties which ratified the Constitu­  
tion.&quot;Condemned by the explanatory amend­  
ments proposed in Congress to the Consti­  
tution.&quot;And ho honed it would receive its final  
condemnatiou by the vote of this House.

preliminaries to a right interpretation, he laid down these rules: ‘ An interpretation  
that destroys the very characteristic of the government cannot be just. Where a  
meaning is clear, the consequences, whatever they may be, are to be admitted ;  
where doubtful, it is fairly triable by its consequengs. In controverted cases the  
meaning of the parties to the instrument, if to be collected by reasonable evidence,  
is a proper guide. Contemporary and concurrent expression are reasonoble evi-  
dence of the meaning of the parties. In admitting or rejecting a constructive  
authority, not only the degree of its incidentality to an express authority is to be  
regarded, but the degree of its importance also; since on this will depend the pro-  
bability or improbability of its being left to construction.” Considering the Con-  
stitution by these rules, Madison could discover no authority in it to incorporate

House of Rrjirrstntati&amp;Sy Ftbruary 2, 1791.  
Mr. MADISON began with a general review of the  
advantages and disadvantages of Banks. The former  
he stated to consist in?1st, The aids they afford to  
merchants who can thereby push their mercantile ope­  
rations farther will the same capital?2nd, The aid*  
to merchants in paying punctually the customs?3rd,  
Aids to the (Government in complying punctually with  
its engagements, when deficiencies or delays happen  
in the revenue?4th, In diminishing usury?5th, In  
saving the wear of the gold and silver kept in the  
vaalts, and represented by notes?6lh, In facilitating  
occasional remittance*) from different places where  
notes happen to circulate. The effect of the proposed  
Bank in raising the value of stock, he thought, had  
been greatly overrated, it would no doubt raise that  
of the stock subscribed into the Bank ; but could have  
little effect on stock, in general, as the interest on it  
would remain the same, and the quantity taken out of  
the market would be replaced by Bank stock.  
The principal disadvantages consisted in?1st,  
Banishing the precious metals, by substituting another  
medium to perform their office. This effect was inevi­  
table. It was admitted by the most enlightened pa­  
trons of Banks, particularly by Smith, on the Wealth of  
Nations. The common answer to the objection was,  
that the money banished was only an exchange for  
something equally valuable, that would be imported in  
return. He admitted the weight of this observation,  
in general, but doubted whether, in the present habits  
of this country, the return would not be in articles of  
no permanent use to it?2nd, Exposing the public and  
individuals toall the evils of a run on the Bank, which  
would be particularly calamitous in so great a country  
at this, and might happen from various causes, as false  
rumors, bad management of the institution, an unfa­  
vorable balancs of trade, from short crops, &amp;c.  
It was proper to be considered also, that the most im­  
portant of ihe advantages would be better obtained by  
several banks, properly distributed, than by a single  
one. The aids to commerce could only be afforded at  
or very near the seat of the bank. The same was true  
of aids to merchants in the payment of customs. An­  
ticipations of the irovernment would also be most con­  
venient at the different places, where the interest of  
the debt was to be paid. The case in America was dif- j  
ferent from that in England: the interest there was all  
due atone place, and the genius of the monarchy fa­  
vored the concentration of wealth and influence at the  
metropolis.  
He thought the plan liable to other objections; It  
did not make so good a bargain for the public, as was  
due to its interests. The charter of the Bank of En­  
gland had been granted for eleven years only, and was  
paid for by a loan to the government, on terms better  
than could be elsewhere got. Every renewal of the  
charter had in like manner been purchased; in some  
instances at a very high price. The same had been  
done by the Banks of Genoa, Naples, and other like  
Banks of circulation. The plan was unequal to the  
public creditors. It gave an undue preference to the  
holders of a particular denomination of the public  
debt, and to those at and within the reach of the seat  
of government. If the subscriptions should be rapid,  
the distant holders of paper would be excluded alto­  
  
gether.  
In making these remarks on the merits of the bill,  
he had reaerved to himself, he said, the right to deny  
the authority of Congress to pa68 it. He had enter­  
tained this opinion from the date of the Constitution.  
His impression might perhaps be the stronger, because  
he well recolleced, that a power to grant charters of  
incorporation had been proposed in the general con­  
vention and rejected.  
Is the power of establishing an incorporated Bank  
among the powers vested by the Constitution in the  
Legislature of the U. 8.? This is the question to be  
examined. After some general remarks on the limi­  
tations of all political power, he took notice of the pe­  
culiar manner in which the Federal Government is  
limited. It is not a general grant, out of which parti­  
cular powers are excepted. It is a grant of particular  
powers only, leaving the general mass in other hands  
So it had been understood by both its foes and its  
friends, and so it was to be interpreted.  
As preliminaries to a right interpretation, he laid  
down the following rules:  
An interpretation that destroys the very characteris­  
tic of the Government cannot be just.  
Where a meaning is clear, the consequences, what­  
ever they may be, are to be admitted. Where doubt­  
ful, it is fairly triable by its consequences.  
In controverted cases, the meaning of the parties to  
the instrument, if to be collected by reasonable evidence,  
is a proper guide.  
Contemporary and concurrent expositions are a rea­  
sonable evidence of the meaning of the parties.  
In admitting or rejecting a constructive authority,  
not only the degree of its incidentally to an express  
authority is to be regarded, but the degree of its  
importance also; since, on this will depend the proba­  
bility or improbability of its being left to construction.  
Reviewing the Constitution, with an eye to these  
positions, it was not possible to discover in it the  
power to incorporate a Bank. The only clauses un­  
der which such a power could be pretended, are, ei­  
ther?  
1st. The power to lay and collect taxes, to pay the  
debts, and provide for the common defence and general  
welfare?or,  
3d. The power to borrow money on the credit of the  
U. S.?or,  
3d. The power to pass all laws necessary and proper  
to carry into execution those powers.  
The Bill did not come within the first power. It laid  
no tax }o pay the debts or provide for the general wel­  
fare. It laid no tax whatever. It was altogether fo­  
reign to the subject.  
jYo argument could be draxen from the terms &quot;com­  
mon defence and general welfare.&quot; The power, as to  
these general purposes, was limited to Acts laying tax­  
es for them; and the general purposes themselves were  
limited and explained by the particular enumeration  
subjoined. To understand these terms in any sense  
that would justify the power in question, would give to  
Congress an unlimited power?would render nugatory  
the enumeration of particular powers?would supersede  
all the powers reserved to the State Governments.?  
These terms are copied from the Articles of Confedera­  
tion. Had it ever been pretended that they were to be  
understood otherwise than as here explained? It had  
been said that &quot;general welfare&quot; means cases in which  
a general power might be exercised by Congress, with­  
out interfering with the powers of the States; and that  
the establishment of a National Bank was of this sort.  
There were, he said, several answers to this notel doc­  
trine.  
1st. The proposed Bank would interfere so as indi­  
rectly to defeat a Slate Bank at the same place.  
2d. It would directly interfere with the rights of the  
8tates to prohibit, as well as to establish, Banks, and  
the circulation of Bank notes. He mentioned a law  
of Virginia, actually prohibiting the circulation of  
notes payable to bearer.  
3d. Interference with the power of the States was no  
  
constitutional criterion of the power of Congress. If  
the power was not given, Congress could not exercise  
it; if given, the/ might exercise it, although it should  
interfere with the laws, or even the Constitution of the  
States.  
4th. If Congress could incorporate ft Bank, merely,  
becaure the Act would leave the States free to establish  
Banks also, anjr other incorporations might be made bj ,  
Congress. Thej could incorporate companies of ma­  
nufacturers, or companies for cutting canals, or eren re­  
ligious societies, leaving similar incorporations by the  
States, like State Banks, to themselves. Congress  
might even establish religious teachers in every parish,  
and pay them out of the Treasury of the U. S , leav­  
  
iti&lt;j clou- UboUjs UHwoifslaJ ia li.pU fn?idlUr?i.-~  
*}&#x27;heaa inadmissible ccndetjuenees oondomnfd th$ con­  
troverted principle. The ouee of the Bunk established  
by the former Congress, had been oiled as a precedent.  
This was known, he said, to have been the child of ne­  
cessity. It never could be justified by the regular  
powers of the Articles of Confederation. Congress  
betrayed a consciousness of this, in ricommtnding to  
the Slates to incorporate the Bank nUo. They did not  
attempt to protect the Bank notes by penalties against  
counterfeiters. These were reserved wholly to the au­  
thority of the Stales.  
The second clause to be examined, is that which em­  
powers Congress to borrow money.  
Is this a bill to borrow money.&#x27; It does not borrow  
a shilling! Is there any fair construction by which the  
bill can be deemed an exercise of the power to borrow  
money? The obvious meaning of the power to borrow  
money, is that of accepting it from, and stipulating pay­  
ment to, those who are able and willing to lend. To  
say that the power to borrow involves a power creating  
the ability, where there may be the will to lend, is not  
only establishing a dangerous principle, (as will be im­  
mediately 6hown,) but is as forced a construction as to  
say that it involves the power of compelling the will,  
where there may be the ability to lend.  
The third clause is that, which gives the power to pac.s  
all laws necessary ana proper to execute the specified  
powers.  
Whatever meaning this clause may have,-none can  
be admitted that would give an unlimited discretion to  
Congress. Iu meaning must, according lo the natural  
and obvious force of the terms, and the context, be li­  
mited to means necessary to the end, ujd incident to  
the nature of the specified powers.  
The clause is, in fact, merely declaratory of what  
would have resulted by unavoidable implication as the  
appropriate, and, as it were, technical mCana of execut­  
ing those powers. In this sense it had been explained  
by the friends of the Constitution, and ratified by the  
State Conventions.  
The essential characteristic of the Government, as  
composed of limited und enumerated pwwers, would be  
destroyed, if instead of direct and incidental means,  
any means could be used which, in the language of  
the preamble to the Hill, &quot;might be conceived to be  
conducive to the successful conducting of ihe finances;  
or mijjht be conceive;! ?.&lt;&gt; tend to give facility to the  
obtaining of loans.&#x27;* le urged an attention to the  
diffuse and ductile lei . is which had been found re­  
quisite to cover the strc&#x27;.ch of power contained in the  
Bill. He compared ther &lt; with the terms necessary and  
proper, used in the Constitution, and asked whether  
it was possible lo view the two descriptions as synony­  
mous, or the one as a fair and safe commentary on the  
other?  
If, proceeded he, Congress, by virtue of the power  
to borrow, can create the means of lending, arid in  
pursuance of these means, can incorporate a Bank,  
they may do any thing whatever, creative of like  
means.  
The East India Company has been a lender to the  
British Government, as well as the Bank, and the South  
Sea Company is a greater creditor than either. Congress,  
then may incorporate similar companieg in the U. s&#x27;; and  
that, too, not under the idea of regulating trade, but un­  
der that of borrowing money.  
1&#x27;rivate capitals are the chief resources for loans to the  
Bri tish Government. Whatever, then, may be conceiv­  
ed to favor the accumulation of capitals, may be done  
by Congress. They may incorporate manufacturers.  
They may give monopolies in every branch of domes­  
tic industry.  
If. again, Congress, by virtue of the power to borrow  
money, can create the ability to lend, they may, by  
virtue of the power to levy money, create the ability  
to pay it. The ability to pay taxes depends on the ge­  
neral wealth of the society; and this on the general  
prosperity of agriculture, manufactures, and com­  
merce. Congress, then, may give bounties and make  
regulations on all of these objects.  
The States have, it is allowed on all hands, a con­  
current right to lay and collect taxes. This power is  
secured to them, not by its being expresslv reserved,  
but by its not being ceded by the Constitution. The  
reasons for the bill cannot be admitted, because they  
would invalidate that right; why may it n?t be con­  
carta by Congress, that an uniform and exclusive im­  
position of taxes would not less than the proposed  
banks, &quot;be conducive to the successful conducting 0f  
the national finances, and tend to give fucility to&#x27;the  
obtaining of revenue for the use of the Government?&quot;  
The doctrine of implication is always a tender one.  
The danger of it has been felt in other Governments!  
The delicacy was felt in the adoption of our own; the  
danger may also be felt, if icc do not Lien close to our  
chartered authorities.  
Mark the reasoning on which the validity of the  
Bill depends. To borrow money is made the end, and  
the accumulation of capitnls implied as the means  
The accumulation of capitals is then the end, and a  
Bank implied as the means. The Bank is then the  
end and the charter of incorporation, a monopoly, ca­  
pital punishments, Ac., implied as the means.  
If implications, thus remote, and thus multiplied  
con be linked together, a chain may be formed that  
will reach every object of legislation, every object  
within the whole compass of political economy.  
The latitude of interpretation required by the Bill is  
it?dfemned ^ lhe fUle furnisl,ed by the Constitution  
Congress have power to &quot;regulate the value of mo­  
ney ; yet it is expressly added, not left to be implied,  
that counterfeiters may be punished.  
They hare the power &quot;to declare war,&quot; to which ar­  
mies are more incident, than incorporated Banks to  
borrowing; yet is expressly added the power to raise  
and support armies ;&quot; and to this again, the express  
power &quot;to make rules and regulations for the Govern­  
ment of armies&quot;?A like remark is applicable to the  
powers as to a Navy.  
The regulation and calling out of the Militia, nrc  
more appurtenant to war, than the proposed Bank to  
  
borrowing ; yet the former is not k*ft to construction.  
It is not pretended that everv insertion or omission in  
the Constitution is the effect of systematic attention.  
This is not the character of any human work, parti­  
cularly the work of a body of men.  
The examples cited, with others that might be added,  
sufficiently inculcate, nevertheless, a rule of interpre­  
tation very different from that on which the Bill rests.  
They condemn the exercise of any power, particularly  
a great and important power, which is not evidently  
and necessarily involved in an express power.  
It cannot be denied, that the power proposed to be  
exercised is an important power.  
As a charter of incorpora^kn, the bill creates an ar­  
tificial person previously nJBxisting in law. It con­  
fers important civil rights iron attributes, which could  
not otherwise be claimed. It i?, though not precisely  
similar, at least equivalents tfie naturalization of an  
alien, by which ceitain n&lt;*w crvil characters are ac­  
quired by him. Would Congress have had the power  
to naturalize, if it had not be&lt;n expressly gven?  
In the power to make bye laws, the bill delegates a  
sort of legislative power, which is unquestionably an  
act of a high and important nature. He took notice of  
the only restraint on the bye-laws, that they were not  
to be contrary to tlu law and the constitution of the  
Bank; and asked what law icns intended; if the law of  
the United States, the scnrntiness of their code would  
give a power never b-..&#x27;ate given to a corporation, and  
obnoxious to the State* whose laws would then be su­  
perseded, not only by t&#x27;tC laws of Congress, but by the  
bye laws of a corporat on within their own jurisdic­  
tion. If the law intended was the Jaw of the Slate,  
then the States might make laws that would destroy  
an institution of the U. S.  
The Bill gives a power to purchase and hold lands.  
Congress themselves c-.iuld not purchase lands within a  
State, &quot;without the consent of its Legislature &quot; How  
eould they delegate a po^cr to others, which they did  
not possess themselves? It takes from our successors,  
who have equal rights with ourselves, and with the aid  
of experience, will be more capable of deciding on the  
subject, an opportunity of exercising that right for an  
immoderate term.  
It takes from our constituents the opportunity of de­  
liberating on the untried measure, although their hands  
are also to be tied by it for the same term.  
It involves a monopoly, which affects the equal  
rights of every citizen.  
It leads to a penal regulation, perhaps capital pu­  
nishments, one of the most solemn acts of sovereign  
I authority.  
From this view of the power of incorporation exer­  
cised in the Bill, it could never be deemed an accessary  
or a subaltern power to be deduced by implication, as a  
means of executing another power; it was, in its nature,  
a distinct and independent and substantive preroga­  
tive, which not being enumerated in the Constitution,  
could never have been meant to be included in it;  
and, not being included, could never be rightfully ex­  
ercised.  
He here adverted to a distinction which, he said, had  
not been sufficiently kept in view, between a power  
necessary and proper for the government of the Union,  
and a power necessary and proper for executing the  
enumerated powers. In the latter case, the powers in­  
| eluded in each of the enumerated powers, were not  
expressed, but to be drawn from the nature of each.?  
In the former, the powers composing the Government  
were trprcssly t.numerated. This constituted the pecu­  
liar nature of the Government. No power, therefore,  
not enumerated, could be inferred from the general na­  
ture of Government. Had the power of making trea­  
ties, for example, been omitted, however necessary it  
might have been, the defect could only have been la­  
mented, or supplied by an amendment of the Consti­  
tion.  
But the proposed Bank could not even be called ne­  
cessary to the government; at most it could be but con­  
venient. Its uses to the government could be supplied  
by keeping the taxes a liulc in advance?by loans from  
  
individual*; by the other Banks, over which the Govern­  
ment would have equal command; nay greater, as it  
may grant or refuse to these the privilege, made a free  
and irrevocable gift to the proposed Bank, of using  
their notes in the federal revenue.  
He proceeded next to the contemporary expositions  
given to the Constitution.  
The defence against the charge founded on the want  
I of a Bill of Rights, pre-aupposed, be said, that the pow­  
ers not given were retained, and that those given were  
not to be extended by remote implications. On any  
other supposition, the power of Congress to abridge the  
freedom of the press, or the rights of conscience, &amp;c.,  
  
COuiJ MtU ilftV* U#? d!?pfA#?d.  
Tli* explanations In thd Stato Cunvsfttiuw ail turn?  
ft] on the aasiiH fundamental prinoiplee, and on th|ft  
principle that the U&gt;rni? necessary and proper, gave j  
no additional powers to those enumerated. [Here he  
read sundry passages from the debates of the Pennsyl­  
vania, Virginia, and North Carolina Conventions,  
showing the grounds on which the Constitution had  
heen vindicated by its principal advocates, against a  
dangerous latitude of its powers charged on it by its  
opponents]  
He did not undertake to vouch for the accuracy or  
authenticity of the publications which he quoted. He  
thought it probable, that the sentiments delivered,  
might, in many instances, have been mistaken, or im­  
perfectly noted ; but the complexion of the whole,  
witli what he himielf, and many others must recollect,  
fully justified the use he had made of them.  
The explanatory declarations and amendments ac­  
companying the ratifications of the several States,  
formed astrikingevidence, wearing the same complex­  
ion. He referred those who might doubt on the sub­  
ject, to the several acts of ratification.  
The explanatory amendments proposed by Congress  
themselves, at least, would be good authority with  
them; all these renunciations of power proceeded on a  
rule of construction, excluding the latitude now con­  
tended for. These explanations were the more to be  
respected, as they had not only been proposed by Con­  
gress, but ratified by nearly three-fourths of the States.  
He read several of the articles proposed, remarking  
particularly on the 11th and 12th: the former as guard­  
ing against a latitude of interpretation, the latter as ex­  
cluding every source of power not within the Consti­  
tution itself.  
With all this evidence of the sense in which the  
Constitution was understood and adopted, will it not  
be said, if the bill should pass, that its adoption was  
brought about by one set of arguments, and that it is  
now administered under the influence of another set r  
And this reproach will have the keener sting, because  
it is applicable to bo many individuals concerned in  
both the adoption and the administration.  
In fine, if the power were in the Constitution, the  
immediate exercise of it cannot be essential?if not  
there, the exercise of it involves the guilt, of usurpa­  
tion, and establishes a precedent of interpretation, levell­  
ing all the barriers which limit the powers ofthe General  
Government, and protecting those of the State Govern­  
ments. If the point be doubtful only, respect for our­  
selves, who ought to shun the appearance of precipi­  
tancy and ambition?respect for our successors, who  
ought not lightly to lie deprived of the opportunity of  
exercising the rights of legislation; respect for our  
constituents, who have had no opportunity of making  
known their sentiments, and who arc themselves to be  
bound down to the measure for so long a period; all  
these considerations require, that the irrevocable deci­  
sion should at least be suspended until another session.  
It appeared, on the whole, he concluded, that the  
power exercised by the Dill?  
Was condemned by the silence of the Constitution.  
Was condemned, by the rule of interpretation arising  
out of the Constitution.  
Was condemned by its tendency to destroy the main  
characteristic ofthe Constitution.

the Constitution, whilst depending befor* the public.  
Was condemned by the apparent intention of the par  
ties which ratified the Constitution.  
Was condemned\&gt;y the explanatory amendments pro­  
posed by Congress themselves to the Constitution.

by tiie vote of this House

IMr. Madison began with a review of the ad­  
vantages and dssadvantages of Banks. The former  
he stated to consist in—1st, The aids they afTord to  
the merchants who can thereby push thetr mercan­  
tile operations farther with the same capital—2nd,  
I’he aids to merchants in paying punctually the  
customs 3d, Aids to the Ooveniment in comply-

gold and silver kept in the vaults, and represented  
by notes—-6th, In facilitatingoccasional remittances  
from difiercnt places wdiere notes happen to circu­  
late. The effect of the proposed Bank in raising  
the value of stock, he thought, had been greatly  
overrated. It would no doubt raise that of the stock  
sul)scribed into the Bank; but could have little efr  
lect on the stock, in general, as the interest on it  
would remain the same, and the quantity taken out

tnf.dium to perform their oflice. This effect was  
iiv vitable. It was admitted by the most enlighten-  
e*l patrons of Banks, particularly by Smith, on the  
\\ ealth of Nations. The common answer to the  
obj clion was, that the money banished was only on  
e.Nch uigc for something equally valuable, that would  
be h&#x27;lported in return. He admitted the weight of  
this o!&#x27;Se”vation, in general, but doubted whether, in  
the present habits of this country, the return would  
not be ill articles of no permanent use to it—-2nd,  
r^xposing tiie public and individuals to all the evils  
of a r:;n on the Bank, which would be particularly  
cal&#x27;iiuitous in so great a country as this, and might  
happ n from various causes, as lalse rumors, bad  
management of the institution, an unfavorabbe ba­  
lance ot trade, from short crops, &amp;c.  
It \\as proper to be considered also, that the most  
iii&#x27;poitant of the advantages would be better obtained  
by several Banks, properly distributed, than by a  
single one. The aids to commerce could only be  
a (forded at or very near the seat of the Bank. The  
same was true of aids to merchants in the payments  
of customs. -Vnticipations of the government would  
also I e UKjst convenient at thcdillercnt places, where  
the iute;cst of the debt was to be paid. The case  
m A’ueiica was diflerent from that in England; the  
inten ii there was all duo at one place, and the ge  
nius of that monarchy favored the concentiation of  
weakii and influence at the metropolis.  
It di\l -^’‘iblc to otbor objections-  
It did not make so good a bargain for the public,  
u. interests. The charter of the  
lianl. of England had been granted for eleven vears  
only, and was paid for by a loan to the gvernment,  
on terms better than could be elsewhere n-ot. Eve­  
ry renewal of the charter had in like mSnner been  
purchased; in some instances at a very high price.  
1 he same had been done by the Banks of Genoa,  
Naples, and other like Banks of circulation. Tiie  
plui V. as unequal to the public creditors It gave  
an undue preference to the Jiolders of a particular  
denomination of the public debt, and to those at and  
uitliin the reach of the seat of government. If the  
subscriptions should be rapid, the distant holders of  
paper would be excluded altogether.  
In making these remarks&#x27;^on the merits of the  
bill, he had reserved to himself, he said, the right to  
deny the authority of Congress to pass it. He had  
entertained this opinion from the date of the Coii^ni-  
tution. His impression might perhaps be the strong­  
er, because he well recollected, that a power To  
grant charters ol incorportion had been proposed in  
the general convention and rejected.

establish Banks also, any other incorporations might  
be made bv Congress. They could incorporate  
  
companies ot manufacturers^ ur companies for cut-  
tifig canals, OT even religiou.s societies, leaving-sim-  
ilar incorporations by the Stales, like State Banks,  
to themselves. Congress might also establish reli­  
gious teachers in every parish, and pay them out of  
the Ireasury ol the (. nited States, leaving other  
teachers unmolested in their functions. U&#x27;hese in-  
admissable consequences condemned the controvert­  
ed principle. 1‘he case of the Bank established by  
the former Congress, had been cited as a precedent.  
This was known, he saki, to have been the child of  
necessity. It never could be justified by the regu-  
lar powers of the Articles of Confederation. Con­  
gress betrayed a consciousness of this, in rccom-  
mending to the States to incorporate a Bank also.  
They did not attempt to protect the Bank notes by  
penalties against counterfeiters. These were re­  
served wholly to the authoiity.of the States.  
The second clause to be examined, is that which  
empowers Congress to borrow money.  
Is this a bill to borrow money 7 It docs not bor­  
row a shilling! Is there any fair construction by  
which the bill can be deemed an exercise of the  
po^^ er to borrow money The obvious meaning  
of the power to borrow money, is that of accepting  
It from, and stipulating payment to those who are  
able and willing to lend. To say that the power  
to borrow involves a power creating the ability  
where there may be the will to lend, is not onlv cs-  
tab ishing a dunprous principle, (as will be imme-  
diately shown.) but is as forced a construction as to  
sav that It involves tiie power of compelling the will  
where there n&#x27;lay be power to lend. ’  
1 he thiid clause is that, which gives the power  
to p.ys all laws ueccssary and proper to execute the  
specitied powers.  
AV hatever meaning this clause may have, none  
can be admitted that would give an unlimited  
discietion to C ongress. Its meaning must, accord-  
in^ to tnc natural and obvious fl)rce of the terms  
and the contcxt. be limited to means neces.sary to  
the end, and incident to the nature of the specified  
powers. ^  
1 he clause is, in fa.-t, merely declaratorv of  
what would have resulted by unavoidable im^Hca-  
tion as the appropriate, and, as it were, t^*chnical  
means ot executing those powers. In this sense it  
had been explained by the friends of the Constitu­  
tion, and ratified by the State* Conventions.  
The essential characteristic of the Government  
as composed of limited and enumerated powers  
would be destroyed, if instead of direct and inciden­  
tal means, any means could be used which in th^&#x27;  
languagoof the preamble to the Bill, ‘-&#x27;mioht bo  
conceived to be conducive to the successful cmiduct-

r I • I . -- - general  
gr.int, out ol which particular powers are excepted.  
It is a grant oi parf.iculfir pov&#x27;ers oiily^ leaving the  
general mass in other han^ls. So it had been un-  
dei stood by^both its foes and its friends, and so it was  
to be interpreted.  
As preliminaries to a right interpretation, he laid  
down the following rules:  
An interpretation that destro}&#x27;s the very character­  
istic of the Government cannot be just.  
\\ here a meaning is clear, the conseqitences.  
whatever they may be, are to be admitted. Where  
doubtful, it is fairly triable by its consequences.  
In controverted cases, the. inednins&#x27; oj the parties  
io the instrument., if to be collected by .reasonable  
evidence, it is a proper guide.  
Jontemporary and current expositions are a rea­  
son ible evidence of the meaning of the parries.  
In admitting or rejecting a constructive autliori-  
ty, not only the degree of its incidentality to an ex  
press authority is to be regarded, but the degree of  
its importance also; since, on this will depend the  
probtibility or improbability of its being left to con­  
struction.  
Reviewing the Constitution, -with an ej-e to these  
positions, it was not possible to discover in it the  
power to incorporate a Bank. The only clauses  
under which such a power could be pretended, are,  
either—  
1st. The power to lay and collect taxes, to pay  
the debts, and provide for the commcn defence and  
g&#x27;. neral welfare—or,  
2il. The power to borrow money on the credit  
of the U. S.—or,  
3d. The power to })ass all laws necessary and  
proper to carry into execution those powers.  
The Bill did not came within the first power.   
It laid no tax to pay the debts or provide for the ge­  
neral welfare. It laid no tax whatever. It was  
altogether foreign to the subject.  
No argument could he drarcn from the terms  
•‘common defence and general w-elfare.” The pow­  
er, as to these general purposes, was limited to Acts  
laying taxes for them; and the general purposes  
  
terms  
requisite to cover the stretch  
of power contained in the Bill. He compared them  
with the terms necessary and proper, used in the  
Constitution, and asked whether it was possible to  
view the two descriptions as synonymus, or the cue  
as a fair and safe-eommentary on the other?  
If, proceeded he. Congi-ess&#x27; by virtue of the pow­  
er to borrow, can create the means of lending, and  
in pursuance ot these means, can incorporate a  
Bank, they may do anything whatever, creative of  
like me.Tiis.  
The East India Company has been a lender to  
the British Government, as well as the Bank, and  
the South Sea Company is a greater creditor \han  
either. Congress, then, may jacorporate similar  
companies in the United States; and that, too, not  
under the idea of rcgiilathig tra.ie, but under that of  
borrowing money.  
Private capitals arc the chief resources of loans  
to the British Government. Whatever,, then, mav  
.be conceived to be favorable to the accumulation of  
capitals, may be done by Congress. They may in­  
corporate manufacturers. They may give monopo­  
lies in every branch of domestic industrj^.  
If, .&#x27;igain, Congress, by virtue of the power to  
borrow money, can create the ability to lend, they  
by \utue of the power to levy money, cre­  
ate the ability to pay it. The ability to pay tax­  
es depends on the general wealth of the society; and  
this on the general prosperity of agriculture, manu-  
fiictures and commerce. Congress, then, may give  
pounties and ?na/:e reguUitioiis on all of these ob­  
jects.  
The States have, it is allowed on all hands, a con­  
current right to lay and collect taxes. This power  
is secured to them, not by its being expressly re-  
.serveel, but by its not being ceded bj’ the Constitu­  
tion. I’he reasons for the Bill cannot be admitted  
bccause they would invalidate that right; why niay  
it not be conceived by Congress, that a uniform and  
exclusive imposition of taxes would not less than  
the proposed Bank, “ be conducive of the successful  
conducting of the national finances, and tend to give  
facility to the obtaining of reve^nuo for the use of

V^rniTiCntj^ Tlio Jclicicy wus iclt lu tlio adopiiuii  
ot our own j the dangev &#x27;may also befelt^ ij icc do  
-not keep close to our chartered anihorities.  
M-irk the reasoning on which the validity of the  
Bill depends. To borrow money is made the end,  
and the accumulation of capitals, implied as the  
means. The accumulation of capitals is then the  
end, and a Bank implied as the means. The Bank  
is then end, and the charter of incorporation, a  
monoply, capital piniishments, &amp;c., implied as the  
means.  
If implications, tlius remote, and thus multiplied,  
can be linked together, a chain may be formed that  
will&#x27;rtach every object of legislation, every object  
within the whole compass of political economy.  
The latitude of interpretation required by the  
Rill, is condemned by the rule furnished by the  
Constitution itself.  
Congress have power to regulate the value of  
money;’ yet It is expressly added, not left to be  
implied, that counterfeiters may be punished.  
They have the power “ to declare war,” to which  
armies are more incident, tiian incorporated Banks  
to borrowing ; yet is expressly added the pov;er to  
‘•raise and suj&#x27;j)ort armies;’’ and to this again, the  
express power -• to make rules and regulatlous for  
the Government of armies.&#x27;’—A like remark is ap­  
plicable to the powers as to a navy.  
The regulation and caHing out of die Militia, arc  
more appurtenant to war, than the proposed Bank  
to borrowing ; yet the former is not left to construc­  
tion. It is not pretended that every insertion or  
omission in the Constitntion is ths effect of systemat-  
tic aUention. Thif? is not the character of any hu­  
man work, particularly the v/ork of a boJy of men.  
Tiie examples cited, wiih others that might be  
milled, sufiiciently incul:ate. nevertheless, a rule ol  
interpretation very different from tiiat on v/hich the  
Bill rests, &#x27;i&#x27;hey condenm tiie exercise of any pow­  
er, parlicularly a great and import.Jiit power, which  
is not evidently and necessarily involved in an ex­  
press poorer  
It cannot be denied, that the power proposed to  
be exercised is an important powtn-.  
As a charter of incorporation, the bill creates au  
artiMcial person previously not existing in law. it  
confers important civil rights and attributes, which  
could not otiierwise be claimed. It is. though not  
precisely similar, at least equivalent to the .’laturali-  
zation of an alien, by which ceitain new civil charac­  
ters are acquired by him Would Congress have  
had the power t-.^ luitiiralizr*, if it had not been ex­  
pressly given?  
In the power to make bye-Iaws, tiie bill delegates  
a sort of legislative power, which is unquestionably  
an act of a high and important nature. He took  
notice of the only restraint on the bye-laws, that  
they v/ere not to be contrary to tlie law and the  
constitution of the Bank; and asked what law icas  
intended; if the law of the United States, the scan­  
tiness of their code would give a j)Ower never before  
given to a corporation, and obnoxious to the States,  
whose laws would then be superseded, not only  
by the laws of Congress, but by the by&#x27;-‘laws ul  
a corporation within own jurisdiction. Ii th&#x27;  
law intended was the lavr of the State, then the  
States might make laws that would destroy an in-  
btitution of the U. S.  
The Bill gives a power to purchase and Iiold  
lands. Congress themsel.-fS could not purcha.se  
lands within a State, *• withou* tlic consent of its l^e-  
gislature.” How could they delegate a power to  
otliers, which they did not posst:ss themselves? It  
takes from our succcssors, who have equal rights  
with ourselves, and with the aid of experience,  
v.dll be more capable of deciding on tlie subject, an  
opportunity of exercising that right for an immo­  
derate term.  
I* takes from our constituents the opportunity of  
d*rl:bcrating on the untried measure, although their  
hands are also to be tied by it for the same term.  
It involves a monoply, which afiects the equal  
rights of every citizui.  
It leads to a penal regulation, perhaps capital pu­  
nishments, one of the most solemn acts of sovereign  
authority.  
From this view ol tiie power of incorjioration  
exercised in the Bill, it could never be deemed an )  
accessary or a subaltern power to be deduced by |  
implication, as a means of executing another pow­  
er ; it was, in its nature, a distnict and independent  
aui substantive prerogative, v/hich not being enu­  
merated in the Constitution, could never hp&#x27;e been  
meant to be included in it; and, not being included,  
could never be rightfully excrcised.  
He here adverted to a distinction which, he said;had  
not been sufficiently kept in view, between a power  
necessary and proper for the goverment of the Union, j  
and a power necssary and proper for executing the j  
enumerated powers, in the latter case, the powers :  
included in each of the enumerated powers, were  
not expreessed, but to be-drawn from the nature of  
each. In the former, the powers composing the  
Government were exprcsshj enu me rated. This con­  
stituted the peculiar nature of the Government. No  
power, therefore, not enumerated, could be inferred  
from the general nature of Government. Had the  
making of treaties, for example, been omitted, how­  
ever necessary it might have been, tke defect&#x27;could  
only have been lamented or supplica by an amend­  
ment of the Constitution.  
But the proposed Bank could not, even be called  
necessary to the government; at most it could be but  
convenient. Its uses to the government could be  
supplied by keeping the taxes a little in advance—  
by loxins from individuals; by *the other Banks, over  
whicH’ the Government would have equal command;  
nay, greater, as it may grant or refuse to these the  
privilege, made a free and irravocaible gift to the  
proposed Bank, of using their notes in the federal  
re%’enue.  
He proceeded next to the cotemporary expositions  
given to the Constitution.  
The defence against the charge founded on the  
want of a Bill of Riglits, pre-supposed, lie Kiid, that  
the pow’^rsjaot given were retained, and that those  
given w&#x27;ere not to be extended by remote implica­  
tions. On any other supposition, the power of Con­  
gress to abridge the freedom of the press, or the  
rights of consciene, &amp;c., could not have been dis­  
proved,  
The explanations hi the State Conventions all  
turned on the same fundamental .principles, and on  
the principle that the terms necessary and proper,  
gave no additional powers to those enumerated.—  
(Here li€ read sundry passages from the debates of  
the Pennsylvania, Virginia, aijd’^r^orth Carolina  
Conventions, showing the grounds oii which the  
Constitution had been vindicated by its principal  
advocates, against a dangerous latitude of its pow­  
ers charged on it by its opponents.]  
He did not undertake to vouch for the accuiacy  
or authenticity of the publications which he quoted.  
He thought it probable, that the sentiments deliver­  
ed, might, in many instances, have been mistaken,  
or imperfectly noted; but the complection of the  
whole, with wdxat he liimself, and many others must  
rccollect, fully justified the use he had made of  
them.  
The explanatory declarations and-amendments  
accompanying the ratifications of the several States,  
lorraed a striking evidence, wearing the same com-  
flexion. He referred those v/ho might doubt .on  
tlie gultjoct. the sevci&#x27;al acts of ratification  
  
Tiie explanatory anr..mdmcnls proposed by Con­  
gress themselves, at least, would be good authority  
with them; all these renunciations of powder pro­  
ceeded on a rule of construction, excludingIthe lati­  
tude now contended for. These explanations were  
the more to be respected, as they had not oniy been  
proposed by Congress, but ratified by nearly tfcree-  
fourths of the States. He read several of the arti­  
cles proposed, remarking particularly on the 11th  
and 12th: the former as guarding against a latitude  
of interpretation, the latter as excluding eveiy  
source of power not within the Constitution itself  
With all this evidence of the sense in which the  
Constitution was understood and tidopted, will it  
not be said, if the bill should pass, that its adoption  
was brought about by on^ set ot arguments, aiul  
that it is now administered under the uifluence of  
another set? And this reproach will have the  
keener sting, because it is applicable to so many  
individuals Concerned in both the adoption and the  
administration.  
lii fine, if the power were in the Constitution,  
ti.e immediate cxercise of it cannot be css.&#x27;iiiiul—if  
not there, tlie exercise of it involvts the ffuilt | at the next  
usurpation, anl establishes a precedi nt ot in.- rpir- Mecklcnburg Coui  
tation, levelling all the bnrriers which limit th.  
powers of the General Government, and prott ct-  
ing those of the State Governments. If the pom*  
be°doubtful only, respect for ourselves, who ought  
to shun the appearance of precipitancy and ambi­  
tion—respect for otir successors, who ought not  
lightly to be deprived of the opportunity of exercis-  
iiio&quot; the rights of legislation ; respect for our consti­  
tuents, who have had no opportunity of making  
known their sentiments, and who are themselves to  
be bound down to the measure for so long a period;  
all these considerations require, that the irrevoca­  
ble decision should at least be suspended until an­  
other session.  
It appeared on the whole, he concltidtd, that the  
power exercised by the Bill—  
Was condemned by the silence of the Constitu­  
tion.  
Was condemned by the rule of interpre&#x27;tation  
arising out of the Constitution.  
Was condemned by its tendency to destroy the  
main characteristic ot the Constitutie^i.  
Was co7idemncd by the expositions of the friends  
of the Constitution, whilst depending before the  
public.  
Was condemned by the apparent intention of th.*&#x27;  
parties which ratified the Constitution.  
Was condemned by the explanatory amf’ndmnnts  
proposed by Congress themselves to the Constitu­  
tion  
And he hoped it would receive its final condem-  
n.ailon by the vote of this House.

it may be well to place on record the objections taken by  
Madison, the ablest member of the republican opposition, to the  
bill of incorporation. Madison asked whether the power of  
establishing an incorporated bank was vested by the constitution  
in the legislature of the United States, and answering his own  
question, he expressed himself in the following terms :— The  
only clauses in the constitution under which such a power could  
be pretended are either; 1, The power to lay and collect taxes  
to pay the debts and provide for the general defence and welfare ;  
or, 2, The power to borrow money on the credit of the United  
States; or 3, The power to pass all laws necessary and proper  
to carry into execution those powers. The bill did not come  
within the first power. It laid no tax to pay the debts or pro-  
vide for the general welfare. No argument could be drawn  
from the terms ‘common defence and general welfare.” To  
understand these terms in any sense that would justify the  
power in question, would give to Congress an unlimited power,  
which would render nugatory the enumeration of particular  
powers, and supersede all the powers reserved to the state  
governments. It had been said that ‘general welfare’ meant  
cases in which a general power might be exercised by Congress,  
without interfering with the powers of the states; and that  
the establishment of a national bank was of this sort. To  
this novel doctrine there were several answers. 1. The pro-  
posed bank would interfere so as indirectly to defeat a state  
bank at the same place. 2. It would directly interfere with the  
rights of the states to prohibit as well as to establish banks and  
the circulation of bank notes. 3. Interference with the power  
of the states was no constitutional criterion of the power of  
Congress, for if the power was not given to Congress it could not

be exercised. 4. If Congress could incorporate a bank merely  
because the act would leave the states free to establish banks  
also, any other incorporations might be made by Congress.  
They might incorporate companies of manufacturers or com-  
panies for cutting canals, or even religious societies, leaving  
similar incorporations by the states, like state banks, to  
themselves.”  
  
These opinions are still those of the republican party proper,  
which Madison and Jefferson formed, and which Abraham  
Lincoln and Mr. Seward are now supposed to lead; while th

“To what purpose,” said Marshall, C. J., speaking for this  
court in Madison v. Marbury, “are limitations committed to  
writing, if these limits may at any time be passed by those  
intended to be restrained. The distinction between a gov-

“A distinction,” as Mr. Madison said,* “is to be kept in  
view between a power necessary and proper for the govern-  
ment or Union and a power necessary for executing the  
enumerated powers.” In the latter case, the powers included  
in the express powers were not expressed, but to be drawn  
from the nature of each. In the former, the powers com-  
posing the government were expressly enumerated. This  
constituted the peculiar nature of the government ; no power, there-  
fore, not enumerated could be inferred from the general nature of  
the government. Tad the power of making treaties, for ex-  
ample, been omitted, however necessary it might have been,  
the defect could only have been lamented, or supplied by an  
amendment of the Constitution.
