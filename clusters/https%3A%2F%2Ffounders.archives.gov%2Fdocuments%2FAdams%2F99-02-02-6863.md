Quincy March 7. 1818  
  
Be pleased to accept my cordial Thanks for the present of and elegant Copy of your Sketches of Mr Henry. I know not whether I shall ever have time to make you any other return than Thanks. But as I see you wish to investigate the Sources of the American Revolution, if you will give me leave, I will give you Such hereto as my memory affords to assist you.  
In 1764 was published in Boston a pretty little Pamphlet “The Sentiments of a British American” the Motto of which ought to have warned Great Britain to desist from her Tyranical System of Taxation.  
			Asellum in prato timidus pascebat Senex.Is, hostium clamore Subito territus, Swadebat Asino fugere, ne possent capi. Att ille Centus: quæso num binas mihi Clitellas impositurum victorem putas? Senex negavit. Ergo quid refert mea Cui Serviam? Clitellas dum portem meas. Phaedrus.  
Considering “An Act for granting certain duties in the British Colonies and Plantations in America,” of the 4.4.3. he says “The first Objection is, that a Tax is laid on Several Commodities, to be raised and levied in the Plantations, and to be remitted home to England. This is esteemed as a grivance, in as much as they are laid without the Consent of the Representatives of the Colonists. It is esteemed an essential British Right, that no Person Shall be Subject to any Tax; but what, in person or by his representative he has a Voice in laying.”  
I am indebted to you, Sir, for the Reperusal of this pretty little Thing. I had never Seen it, for 54 Years and Should never have Seen it again: but your Book has excited me, having no copy of it to borrow it as a great favour for a Short time. It was written by Oxenbridge Thatcher a Barrister at Law in Boston. There is So much resemblance between this pamphlet and Mr Jays Address to the People of England written ten years afterwards, That, as Johnson Said of his Rasselas and Voltaires Candide, one might be Suspected to have given Birth to the other.  
Majora canamus.  
In 1764 was published in Boston “The Rights of the British Colonies asserted and proved, by James Otis Esq, This Work was read in the House of Representatives of Massachusetts in Manuscript in 1764 and though not ordered by them to be publised it was printed with their Knowledge. In it these Propositions are asserted as fundamental.  
“1. That the Supream and Subordinate Powers of Legislation Should be free and Sacred in the hands, where the Community have once rightfully placed them.  
2. The Supream national Legislative cannot be altered justly, till the Commonwealth is dissolved, nor a Subordinate Legislative taken away without forfeiture or other good Cause. Nor can the Subjects in the Subordinate Government be reduced to a State of Slavery, and Subject to the despotick Rule of others.  
3. No Legislative, Supreme or Subordinate, has a right, to make itself arbitrary.  
4. The Supream Legislative cannot justly assume a Power of ruling by extempore arbitrary decrees, but is bound to dispense Justice by known Settled rules, and by duely authorized, independent Judges.  
5. The Supreme Power cannot take from any Man, any part  of his Property, without his Consent, in Person, or by his Representative.  
6. The Legislature Power cannot transfer the Power of making Laws to any other hands.  
These are the bounds, which by God and Nature are fixed; hitherto have they a right to come, and no farther.  
1. To govern by Stated Laws.  
2. “Those Laws Should have no End, ultimately but the public Good good of the People.  
3. “That Taxes are not to be laid on the People, but by Their Consent, or by deputation.  
4. “Their whole Power is not transferable.  
These are the first Principles of Law and Justice; and The great Barriers of a free State, and of the British Constitution in particular. I ask, I want no more.”  
This Work, which in 1764 was as familiar to me, as my Alphabet I had not Seen for 54 Years, and Should never have Seen it again if your Sketches for which I again thank you, had not arroused me. With some Pains and as a great favour I have obtained the Loan of it for a Short time. In page 73, is an elaborate and learned demonstration that all Acts of Parliment laying Taxes on the Colonies without their Consent, are void.  
In an Appendix to this Work is a Copy of Instructions given by The City of Boston, at their annual Meeting in May 1764. to their Representatives, Royal Tyler, James Otis, Thomas Cushing and Oxenbridge Thatcher Esq’rs. These Instructions were drawn by Samuel Adams who was one of the Committee appointed by the Town for that purpose.  
These Instructions are a Sample of that Symplicity, Purity and harmony of Style which distinguished all the productions of Mr Adams’s Pen. I wish I could transcribe the whole: but the Paragraph, most directly to the present Purpose is the following  
“But what Still heightens our Apprehensions is, that these unexpected Proceedings may be preparatory to new Taxations upon Us: for, if our Trade may be taxed, why not our Lands? Why not the produce of our Lands, and every Thing We possess or make Use of? This We apprehend annihilates our Charter Right to govern and tax ourselves. It Strikes at our British Priviledges, which, as We have never forfeited them, We hold in common with our fellow Subjects who are natives of Britain. If Taxes are laid upon Us in any Shape, without our having a legal Representation where they are laid, are We not reduced from the Character of free Subjects, to the miserable State of tributary Slaves.?”  
This whole Work was published more than a Year before Mr Henrys Resolutions were moved.  
Excuse the trouble I give you, and believe me to be, Sir, / your obliged Friend / and humble Servant  
John Adam

Quincy, March 7, 1818.  
  
Dear s1r—Be pleased to accept my cordial  
thanks for the present of an elegant copy of  
your Sketches of Mr. Henry. I know not whe-  
ther I shall ever have time to make you any  
other return than thanks; but as I see you  
wish to investigate the sources of the American  
revolution, if you will give me leave, I wili  
sive you such hints as my memory affords, to  
assist you.  
  
In 1.764 was published in Boston, a pamphlet  
“The sentiments of a British American,” the  
motto of which ought to have warned Great  
Britain to desist from her tyrannical system of  
taxation:  
  
*Asellum in prato timidus pascebat senex.  
  
Is hostium clamore subito territus  
  
Suadebat asino fugere, ne possent capi.  
  
Ait ille lentus; queso num binas mihi  
  
Clitellas impositurum victorum putas?  
  
Senex negavit. Ergo quid refert mea  
  
Cui serviam? Clitellas dum portem meas.”’  
  
Paxpnvs.  
  
Considering an act of parliament ef the  
fourth year of George the third, for granting  
certain duties in the British colonies and plan-  
tations in America, he says the first objection  
is, that ‘a tax is laid on several commodities,  
to be raised and levied in the plantations, and  
to be remitted home to England.” This is  
esteemed as a grievance, inasmuch as they are  
laid without the consent of the representatives  
of the colonists. It is esteemed an ESSENTIAL  
BririsH RIGHT, THAT NO PERSON SHALL BE  
SUBJECT TO ANY TAX BUT WHAT IN PERSON, OR  
BY HIS REPRESENTATIVE, HE HAS A VOICE IN  
LAYING.  
  
I am indebted to you, Mr. Wirt, for the re-  
perusal of this pretty little thing. I had not  
seen it for fifty-four years, and should never  
have seen tt again, if your book had not excited  
me, having no copy of it, to borrow it, asa  
great favor, for a short time. It was written  
by Oxenbridge Thatcher, a barrister at law, in  
Boston. There is so much resemblance be-  
tween this pamphlet and Mr. Jay’s address to  
the people of England, written in congress ten  
years afterwards, that, as Johnson said of his  
Rasselas and Vottaire’s Candid, the world  
might suspect that the one gave eccasion to the  
other.  
  
In this year, 1764, was published in Boston,  
“The rights of the British colonies asserted  
and proved—by James Otis, esq.”” This work  
was read in manuseript in the house of re-  
presentatives of Massachusetts, in 1764, and!  
  
“4. That the supreme and subordinate powers of  
legislation should be free, and sa¢red in the hands  
where the community have once rightfully placec  
them.  
  
“2. The supreme national legislature cannot be.  
altered, justly, till the commonwealth is dissolved;  
not a subordinate legislature taken away without  
forfeiture or other good cause. Nor can the sub-  
jects of the subordinate government be reduced to  
a state of slavery, and reduced to the despotic  
rule of others.  
  
“3. No legislature, supreme or subordinate, has  
aright to make itself arbitrary.  
  
“4, The supreme legislative cannot j:.&#x27; tly assume  
a power of ruling by extempore, arbitrary decrees;  
but is bound to dispense justice, by Known set-  
tled rules, and by duly autherised, incependent  
judges.  
  
“&lt;5, THE SUPREME POWER CANNOT TAKE FROM ANY  
MAN ANY PART OF HIS PROPERTY, WITHOUT HIS CON-  
SENT IN PERSON, OR BY HIS REPRESENTATIVE.  
  
“6. The legislature cannot transfer the power of  
making laws to any other hands.”  
  
“These are the bounds which, by God and na-  
ture, are fixed—Hitherto have they a right to come,  
and no farther:  
| &quot;Ist. To govern by stated laws:  
  
“2dly. Tliose laws should have no end ultimately  
but the good of the people.  
  
“3dlty. That taxes are not to be laid upon the  
pecple, but by their consent or by deputation.  
  
“4ihly. Their whole power is not transferable.”  
  
These are the first principles of law and  
justice; the great barriers of a free state, and  
of the British constitution in particular.——i  
ask, I want, no more.  
  
This work, Mr. Wirt, which, in 1764, was  
as familiar to me as my alphabet, [ had not  
seen for fifty-four years, and should never have  
seen itagain, if your “Sketches,” for which I  
again thank you, had not aroused me. With  
some pains and as great a favor, I have ob-  
tained the loan of it, from Wm. Smith Shaw,  
esq. the indefatigable collector of literary cu-  
riosities in the Athenzeum.  
  
In page seventy-three of Mr. Otis’ pamphlet  
is a learned and elaborate demonstration, that  
all acts of parliament, laying taxes on the  
colonies without their consent, were null and  
void.  
  
In an appendix to this work, is a capy of  
instructions given by the city of Boston, at  
their annual meeting in May, 1764, to their  
representatives, Royal Tyler, James Oris,  
Thomas Cushing and Oxenb:idge Thatcher,  
esqs. These instructions were drawn by Sa-  
muel Adams, who was one of the committee,  
appointed by the town. for that purpose. These  
instructions are a sample of that simplicity,  
purity and harmony of style, which distin-  
gnished all the productions of Mr, Acams’  
pen. I wish I could transcribe the whole; but  
the paragraph most directly to the present pur-  
  
ose, is the following:

Dear Str,—Be pleased to accept my cordial  
thanks for the present of an elegant copy of your  
Sketches of Mr. Henry. 1 know not whether I

you will give me leave, I will give such hints as  
my memory affords, to assist you.

“ The Sentiments of a British American,” the  
motto of which oursht to have warned Great Bri-  
tain to desist from her tyrannical system of taxa-  
tion—

Phedrus.  
  
Considering an act of parliament of the fourth

ties in the British colonies and plantations in  
America, he says the first objection is, that “a

| sent of the representatives of the colonies. It is  
esteemed an essential British right that no person  
shall be subject to any tax but what in person, or by  
his representative, he has a voice in laying.  
  
I am indebted to you, Mr. Wirt, for the re-pe-  
rusal of this pretty fittle thing. I had not seen it  
| for fifty-four years, and should never have scen it  
‘again, if your book had not excited me, having no

much resemblance between this pamphlet and

ten in congress, ten years afterwards, that, as  
Johnson said of his Rasselas and Voltaire’s Can-  
did, the world might suspect that the one gave  
occasion to the other.

read in manucript in the house of representatives  
of Massachusetts, in 1764, and though not ordered  
by them to be published, it was printed with

serted as fundamental.  
  
“1. That the supreme and subordinate powers  
of legislation should be free, and sacred in the  
hands where the community have once rightfully

“2. The supreme national legislature cannot  
be altered, justly, till the commonwealth is dis-  
solved; nor a subordinate legislature taken away  
without forfeiture or other good cause. Nor can  
the subjects of the subordinate government be

“ 4thly. Their whole power is not transfera-  
ble.”  
  
These are the first principles of law and jus-  
tice; the great barriers of a free state, and of the  
British constitution in particular.—I ask, I want,  
no more.  
  
This work, Mr. Wirt, which, in 1764, was as  
familiar to me as my alphabet, I had not seen for  
fifty four years, and should never have seen it  
again, if your “Sketches,” for which I again  
thank you, had not aroused me. With some  
puins, and as great a favor, I have obtained the  
loan of it, from Wm. Smith Shaw, Esq. the inde-  
fatigable collector of literary curiosities in the  
Athenzum.  
  
{n page seventy three of Mr. Otis’ pamphlet is  
a learned and elaborate demonstration, that all  
acts of parliament, laying taxes on the colonies  
without.their consent, were null and void.  
  
In an appendix to this work, is a copy of in-  
structions given by the city of Boston, at their  
annual meeting in May, 1764, to their represen-  
tatives, Royal Tyler, James Oris, Thomas Cush-  
ing and Oxenbridge Thatcher, Esqs. These in-  
structions were drawn by Samuel Adams, who  
was one of the committee, appointed by the  
town, for that purpose. These instructions are  
a sample of that simplicity, purity and harmony  
of style, which distinguished all the productions  
of Mr. Adams’ pen. I wish I could transcribe  
the whole; but the paragraph most directly to  
the present purpose is the following.  
  
“ But what still heightens our apprehensions  
is, that these unexpected proceedings may be  
preparatory to new TaxaTrons upon us. For, if  
our trade may be taxed, why not our lands?  
Why not the produce of our lands and every  
thing we possess or make use of? This, we ap-  
prehend, annihilates our charter right to govern  
and tax ourselves. It strikes at our British pri-  
vilerces, which, as we have never forfeited them,  
we hold in common with our fellow subjects,  
who are natives of Britain. if taxes are laid up-  
on us, in any shape, without our having a legal  
representation where they are laid, are we not  
reduced from the character of free subjects to  
the miserable state of miserable slaves.”  
  
This whole work was published more than a  
year before Mr. Henry’s resolutions were moved  
or composed.  
  
Fxcuse the trouble I give you, and believe  
me to be, sir, your obliged friend and humble  
servant, JOHN ADAMS

Phedrus.  
  
Considering an act of parliament of the fourth  
year of George the third, for granting certain du-  
ties in the British colonies and plantations in  
America, he says the first objection is, that “a  
tax is laid on several commodities, to be raised  
and levied in the plantations, and to be remitted  
home to England.” ‘This is esteemed asa grie-  
  
vance, inasmuch as they are laid without the cou-  
sent of the representatives vr tie coronres. is  
  
esteemed an essential British right that no person  
shall be subject to any tax but what in person, or by  
his representative, he has a voice in laving.  
  
I am indebted to you, Mr. Wirt, for the re-pe-  
rusal of this pretty little thing. I had not seen it  
for fifty-four years, and should never have seen it  
jagain, if your book had not excited me, having no  
jcopy of it, to borrow it, as a great favor, for «

cher, a barrister at law, in Buston. There is so  
much resemblance between this pamphlet and  
Mr. Jay’s address to the people of England, writ-  
ten in congress, ten years afterwards, that, as  
Johnson said of his Rasselas and Voltaire’s Can-  
did, the world might suspect that the one gave  
occasion to the other.  
  
In this year, 1764, ‘was published in Boston,  
“The rights of the British colonies asserted and  
proved—by James Otis, esq.” This work was  
read in manucript in the house of representatives  
of Massachusetts, in 1764, and though not ordered

LOckE on PrOperTy.  
The philosopher Locke, in his  
great work, says:  
The supreme power cannot take  
from any man any part of his pro  
perty without his own consent. For  
the preservation of property, being  
the end of government, and that,  
for what men enter into society, it  
necessarily supposes and requires  
that men should have property, with  
out which they must be supposed to  
lose that, by entering into society,  
which was the end for which they  
entered into it; too gross an absur­  
dity for any one to own. Men,  
therefore, in society, having pro  
perty, they have such a right to the  
goods, which, by the law of the com­  
munity, are theirs, that nobody  
hath a right to take their substance,  
or any part of it, from them, with
