Sir,  
Colo. Morris’s on the Heights of HarlemSeptr 2[5]th 1776.  
  
From the hours allotted to Sleep, I will borrow a few moments to convey my thoughts on sundry important matters to Congress.   
  
I shall offer them with that sincerety which ought to characterize a Man of candour; and with the freedom which may be used in giving useful information, without incurring the imputation of presumption.  
We are now as it were, upon the eve of another dissolution of our Army—the remembrance of the difficulties wch happened upon that occasion last year—the consequences which might have followed the change, if proper advantages had been taken by the Enemy—added to a knowledge of the present temper and Situation of the Troops, reflect but a very gloomy prospect upon the appearance of things now and satisfie me, beyond the possibility of doubt, that unless some speedy, and effectual measures are adopted by Congress; our cause will be lost.  
It is in vain to expect that any (or more than a trifling) part of this Army will again engage in the Service on the encouragement offered by Congress—When Men find that their Townsmen &amp; Companions are receiving 20, 30, and more Dollars for a few Months Service (which is truely the case) it cannot be expected; without using compulsion; &amp; to force them into the Service would answer no valuable purpose. When Men are irritated, &amp; the Passions inflamed, they fly hastily, and chearfully to Arms, but after the first emotions are over to expect, among such People as compose the bulk of an Army, that they are influenced by any other principles than those of Interest, is to look for what never did, &amp; I fear never will happen; the Congress will deceive themselves therefore if they expect it.  
A Soldier reasoned with upon the goodness of the cause he is engaged in and the inestimable rights he is contending for, hears you with patience, &amp; acknowledges the truth of your observations; but adds, that it is of no more Importance to him than others—The Officer makes you the same reply, with this further remark, that his pay will not support him, and he cannot ruin himself and Family to serve his Country, when every member of the community is equally Interested and benefitted by his Labours—The few therefore, who act upon Principles of disinterestedness, are, comparitively speaking—no more than a drop in the Ocean. It becomes evidently clear then, that as this contest is not likely to be the Work of a day—as the War must be carried on systematically—and to do it, you must have good Officers, there are, in my judgment, no other possible means to obtain  
  
them but by establishing your Army upon a permanent footing; and giving your Officers good pay. this will induce Gentlemen, and Men of Character to engage; and till the bulk of your Officers are composed of Such persons as are actuated by Principles of honour, and a spirit of enterprize, you have little to expect from them. They ought to have such allowances as will enable them to live like, and support the Characters of Gentlemen; and not be driven by a scanty pittance to the low, &amp; dirty arts which many of them practice to filch the Public of more than the difference of pay would amount to upon an ample allowe—besides, something is due to the Man who puts his life in his hand—hazards his health—&amp; forsakes the Sweets of domestic enjoyments—Why a Captn in the Continental Service should receive no more than 5/. Curry per day for performing the same duties that an Officer of the same Rank in the British Service receives 10/. Sterlg for, I never could conceive; especially when the latter is provided with every necessary he requires upon the best terms, and the former can scarce procure them at any Rate. There is nothing that gives a Man consequence, &amp; renders him fit for Command, like a support that renders him Independant of every body but the State he Serves.  
With respect to the Men, nothing but a good bounty can obtain them upon a permanent establishment; and for no shorter time than the continuance of the War, ought they to be engaged; as Facts incontestibly prove, that the difficulty, and Cost of Inlistments, increase with time. When the Army was first raised at Cambridge, I am perswaded the Men might have been got without a bounty for the War—after this, they began to see that the contest was not likely to end so speedily as was immagined, &amp; to feel their consequence, by remarking, that to get the Militia In, in the course of last year, many Towns were induced to give them a bounty—Foreseeing the Evils resulting from this and the destructive consequences which unavoidably would follow short Inlistments, I took the liberty in a long Letter written by myself (date not now recollected, as my Letter Book is not here) to recommend the Inlistments for and during the War, Assigning such Reasons for it, as experience has since convinced me were well founded—At that time Twenty Dollars would, I am perswaded, have engaged the Men for this term. But it will not do to look back, and if the present opportunity is slip’d, I am perswaded  
  
that twelve months more will Increase our difficulties four fold—I shall therefore take the freedom of givg it as my opinion, that a good Bounty be immediately offered, aided by the proffer of at least 100 or 150 Acres of Land and a Suit of Cloaths &amp; Blankt to each Non Comd Officer &amp; Soldier, as I have good Authority for saying, that however high the Mens pay may appear, it is barely sufficient in the present scarcity &amp; dearness of all kinds of goods, to keep them in Cloaths, much less afford support to their Families—If this encouragement then is given to the Men, and such Pay allowed the Officers as will induce Gentlemen of Character &amp; liberal Sentiments to engage, and proper care &amp; precaution used in the nomination (having more regard to the Characters of Persons, than the number of Men they can Inlist) we should in a little time have an Army able to cope with any that can be opposed to it; as there are excellent Materials to form one out of: but while the only merit an Officer possesses is his ability to raise Men—while those Men consider, and treat him as an equal; &amp; (in the Character of an Officer) regard him no more than a broomstick, being mixed together as one common herd, no order, nor no discipline can prevail—nor will the Officer ever meet with that respect which is essensially necessary to due subordination.  
To place any dependance upon Militia, is, assuredly, resting upon a broken staff. Men just dragged from the tender Scenes of domestick life—unaccustomed to the din of Arms—totally unacquainted with every kind of Military skill, which being followed by a want of Confidence in themselves when opposed to Troops regularly traind—disciplined, and appointed—superior in knowledge, &amp; superior in Arms, makes them timid, and ready to fly from their own Shadows. Besides, the sudden change in their manner of living (particularly in the lodging) brings on sickness in many; impatience in all; &amp; such an unconquerable desire of returning to their respective homes that it not only produces shameful, &amp; scandalous Desertions among themselves, but infuses the like spirit in others—Again, Men accustomed to unbounded freedom, and no controul, cannot brooke the Restraint which is indispensably necessary to the good Order and Government of an Army; without which Licentiousness, &amp; every kind of disorder triumphantly reign. To bring men to a proper degree of Subordination is not the work of a day—a Month—  
  
or even a year—and unhappily for us, and the cause we are Ingaged in, the little discipline I have been labouring to establish in the Army under my immediate Command, is in a manner done away by having such a mixture of Troops as have been called together within these few Months.  
Relaxed, and as unfit as our Rules &amp; Regulations of War are for the Government of an Army, the Militia (those properly so called, for of these we have two sorts, the Six Months Men and those sent in as a temporary aid) do not think themselves subject to ’em, and therefore take liberties which the Soldier is punished for—this creates jealousy—jealousy begets dissatisfactions—and these by degrees ripen into Mutiny; keeping the whole Army in a confused, and disordered State; rendering the time of those who wish to see regularity &amp; good Order prevail more unhappy than Words can describe—Besides this, such repeated changes take place, that all arrangement is set at nought, &amp; the constant fluctuation of things deranges every plan, as fast as adopted.  
These Sir, Congress may be assured, are but a small part of the Inconveniences which might be enumerated, &amp; attributed to Militia—but there is one that merits particular attention, &amp; that is the expence. Certain I am that it would be cheaper to keep 50 or 100,000 Men in constant pay than to depend upon half the number, and supply the other half occasionally by Militia—The time the latter is in pay before and after they are in Camp, Assembling &amp; Marching—the waste of Ammunition—the consumption of Stores, which in spite of every Resolution, &amp; requisition of Congress they must be furnished with, or sent home—added to other incidental expences consequent upon their coming, and conduct in Camp, surpasses all Idea; and destroys every kind of regularity &amp; œconomy which you could establish amg fixed and Settled Troops; and will in my opinion prove (if the scheme is adhered to) the Ruin of our Cause.  
The Jealousies of a standing Army, and the Evils to be apprehended from one, are remote; and in my judgment, situated &amp; circumstanced as we are, not at all to be dreaded; but the consequence of wanting one, according to my Ideas; formed from the present view of things, is certain, and inevitable Ruin; for if I was called upon to declare upon Oath, whether the Militia have been most Serviceable or hurtful upon the whole I should subscribe to the latter. I do not mean by this however to arraign the  
  
Conduct of Congress, in so doing I should equally condemn my own measures (if I did not my judgment) but experience, which is the best criterion to work by, so fully, clearly, and decisively reprobates the practice of trusting to Militia, that no Man who regards order, regularity, &amp; Œconomy; or who has any regard for his own honour, character, or peace of Mind, will risk them upon this Issue.  
No less Attention should be paid to the choice of Surgeons than other Officers of the Army. they should undergo a regular examination; and if not appointed by the Director Genl &amp; Surgeons of the Hospital, they ought to be subordinate to, and governed by his directions—the Regimental Surgeons I am speaking of—many of whom are very great Rascals, countenancing the Men in sham Complaints to exempt them from duty, and often receiving Bribes to Certifie Indispositions with a view to procure discharges or Furloughs; but independant of these practices, while they are considered as unconnected with the Genl Hospital there will be nothing but continual Complaints of each other—The director of the Hospital charging them with enormity in their drafts for the Si

e, in numberless Instances, drawn for Medicines—Stores—&amp;ca in the most profuse and extravagent manner, for private purposes.  
Another matter highly worthy of attention, is, that other Rules and Regulation’s may be adopted for the Government of the Army than those now in existence, otherwise the Army, but for the name, might as well be disbanded—For the most atrocious offences (one or two Instances only excepted) a Man receives no more than 39 Lashes, and these perhaps (thro the collusion of the Officer who is to see it inflicted) are given in such a manner as to become rather a matter of sport than punishment; but when inflicted as they ought, many hardend fellows who have been the Subjects, have declared that for a bottle of Rum they

e choice of the New sett even if it should take double the time to compleat the Levies—An Army formed of good Officers moves like Clock work; but there is no Situation upon Earth less enviable, nor more distressing, than that Person’s who is at the head of Troops, who are regardless of Order and discipline; and who are unprovided with almost every necessary—In a word, the difficulties which have forever surrounded me since I have been in the Service, and kept my Mind constantly upon the stretch—The Wounds which my Feelings as an Officer have received by a thousand things which have happened, contrary to my expectation and Wishes—the effect of my own conduct, and present appearance of things, so little pleasing to myself, as to render it a matter of no Surprize (to me) if I should stand capitally censured by Congress—added to a consciousness of my inability to govern an Army composed of such discordant parts, and under such a variety of intricate and perplexing circumstances, induces not only a belief, but a thorough conviction in my Mind, that it will be impossible unless there is a thorough change in our Military System for me to conduct matters in such a manner as to give Satisfaction to the Publick, which is all the recompense I aim at, or ever wished for.  
Before I conclude I must appologize for the liberties taken in this Letter and for the blots and scratchings therein—not having time to give it more correctly. With truth I can add, that with every Sentiment of respect &amp; esteem I am Yrs &amp; the Congresses Most Obedt &amp; Most H. Servt

Col. Morris’s, on the Heights of  
aerlem, Sept. 24, 1776.  
“ Sir,  
  
* From the hours allotted to sleep, 1  
will borrow a few moments to convey  
my thoughts on sundry impertant mat-  
ters to Congress. I shall offer them  
with the sineerity which ought to cha-  
racterizea man of candour, and with  
the freedom which may be used in giv-  
ing useful information, without incar-  
ring the jmputation of presunyptien.  
  
** We are now, as it were, upon the  
eve of another dissolution of our army.  
  
The remembrance of the difficulties.  
  
which happened upon the occasion last  
year, the consequences which might  
have followed the change, if proper ad-  
gantages had hecy taken by the enemy,  
  
jadded to a knowledge of the present  
temper and situation of the troops, re-  
li. ct Dut a gloumy prospect — the ap  
pearance. s of tuings now, aod-satisly me  
beyond wee puss: Diity of doubt, that,  
uiless same speedy and effectual mea-  
sures ure adopted by Congress, our  
caase will be lust,  
  
“It is in vain to expect that any, or  
more than 4 irttling part of this army  
will agai: «ngage in the service on the  
encouragement oficred by Congress,  
when wen find that thew towusmen  
and companions sre receiving twenty,  
towty, and more dollars, for a few  
months’? service, (which is truly the  
case) it cannot be expected, without us-  
ing compulsion ; and to foree them into  
thy service would answer no valuable  
purpose. &quot;When men are irritated, and  
the pussions inflamed, they fly hastily  
and cheerfully .to arms; bat after the  
lirst emotions are over * * *, a soldier,  
reasoned with upon the goodness of the  
cause he is engaged in, and the inesti-  
mable rights he is contending for, hears  
you with patience, and acknowledges  
the truth of your observations, but adds,  
that it is of no more importance to him  
than others. ‘The officer makes you  
the same reply, with this further re-  
mark, that his pay will not support him,  
and he cannot ruin himself and family  
to serve his country, when every mem-  
ber of the community is interested and  
benefited by his labours.  
  
“ It becomes evidently clear then,  
that as this contest is not likely to be  
the work of a day,—as the war must  
be carried on svstematically,—and to  
do it you must have good officers,—  
there are, in my jadgment, no other pos-  
jsible means to obtain them bat by esta-  
|blishing your army upon a permanent  
fvoting, and giving your officers good  
‘pay, ‘This will induce gentlemen and  
jmen of character to engage : and, till  
the bulk of your officers are composed  
of such persons as are achuated by prin-  
ciples of honour and a spirit of enter-  
prise, you have little to expect from  
them. ‘They ought to have such allow-  
jances as will enable them to live hke  
‘ard support the characters.of gentle-  
men, Besides, something is due to the  
rman who puts his life in Feiaié) hands,  
hazards his health, and forsakes the  
sweets of domestic enjoyment. Why  
&amp; captain in the continental service  
should receive no more than five shill-  
ings currency per day for performing  
the same duties that an officer of the  
same rank in the British service re  
ceives ten shillings sterling for, I never  
jeould conceive, especially when the lat-  
\ter is provided with every necessary he  
  
requires upon the best terms, and the  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
former can scarce procure them at any  
rate. There is nothing that gives a man  
consequence and renders him fit for  
conumnand, like a support that renders  
him independent of every body but the  
state he serves.  
  
“ With respect to the men, nothing but  
a good bounty can obtain them upon a  
permanent establishment ; znd fer no  
shorter tie than the continuance of the  
War, oug it they to be engaged ; as facts  
incontesubly prove that the drfficulty  
and enlistments increase with time.—  
When the army was raised at. Cam-  
bridge, I am persuaded that the men  
might have been got, with a bounty for  
the war. After this they began to see  
that the contest was not likely to end so  
speedily as was imagined, and to feel  
their consequence by remarking, that,  
to get in the militia in the course of the  
last year, many towns were induced to  
give them bounty,  
  
“ Foreseeing the evils resulting from  
this, and the. destructive consequences  
which unavoidably would follow shorg  
enlistments, I took the liberty in a long  
letter (date not now recollected, as my  
letter book is not here) to reeommend  
the enlistments for and during the war,  
assigning such reasons for it as experi-  
ence has since convinced me were well  
  
founded. At that time, twenty dollars ©  
  
would, I am persuaded, have engaged  
the men for this term. But it will not  
do to look back : and if the present op-  
portunity is slipped, Iam persuaded that  
twelve months more will increase our  
difficulties fourfold. I shall therefore  
take the freedom of giving it as my o-  
pinion, that a.good bounty be immedi  
  
ately offered, aided by the proffer of at  
least 2 hundred or a handred and fiity  
acres of land, and a suit of clothes and  
blanket to each non commissioned offi-  
cer and soldier ; as I have good author-  
ity for saying, that, however high the  
men’s pay may appear, it is barely suf-  
ficient, in the present scarcity and dear-  
ness of all kinds of goods. to keep them  
in clothes, much less afford support to  
their families.  
  
“ If this encouragement then is given  
to the men, 2nd shch pay allowed the of-  
ficers. as will induce gentlemen of char-  
acter and liberal sentiments to engage,  
and proper care and precaution used in  
the nomination (having more regard to  
the characters of persons than the num-  
ber of men they can ealist.) we should  
in a little time have an army able to  
cope with any that can be opposed to it,  
as there are excellent nraterials to form  
one out of But while the only merit  
an officer possesses is his ability to raise  
men, while those men consider and

have followed the change, if proper advantages had been taken  
by the enemy, added to a knowledge of the present temper and  
situation of the troops, reflect but a very gloomy prospect upon  
the appearances of things now, and satisfy me beyond the possi-  
bility of doubt, that, unless some speedy and effectual measures  
are adopted by congress, our cause will be lost.  
  
It is in vain to expect, that any, or more than a trifling part  
of this army will again engage in the service on the encourage-  
ment offered by congress. When men find that their townsmen  
and companions are receiving, twenty, thirty, and more dollars  
for a few months’ service (which is truly the case) it cannot be  
expected, without using compulsion, and to force them into the  
service, would answer no valuable purpose. When men are ir-  
ritated, and the passions inflamed, they fly hastily and cheerfully  
to arms: but after the first emotions are over, a soldier reasoned  
with upon the goodness of the cause he is engaged in, and the  
inestimable rights he is contending for, hears you with patience,  
and acknowledges the truth of your observations, but adds that  
it is of no more importance to him than others. ‘The officer  
makes you the same reply, with this further remark, that his  
pay will not support him, and he cannot ruin himself and family  
to serve his country, when every member of the community is  
equally interested and benefited by his labours.  
  
It becomes evidently clear then, that, as this contest is not  
likely to be the work ofa day; as the war must be carried on  
systematically; and to do it you must have good officers; there  
are, in my judgment, no other possible means to obtain them,  
but by establishigg your army upon a permanent footing, and  
giving your officers good pay. This will induce gentlemen, and  
men of character to engage: and, till the bulk of your officers  
are composed of such persons as are actuated by principles of  
honour and a spirit of enterprise, you have little to expect  
from them. They ought to have such allowances as will enable  
them to live like and support the characters of gentlemen. Be-  
sides, something is due to the man who puts his life in your hands,  
hazards his health, and forsakes the sweets of domestic enjoy-  
ment. Why a captain in the continental service should receive  
  
no more than five shillings currency per day, for performing the

same duties that an officer of the same rank in the British ser-  
vice receives ten shillings sterling for, I never could conceive,  
especially when the latter is provided with every necessary he re-  
quires, upon the best terms, and the former can scarcely procure  
them at any rate. There is nothing that gives a man conse-  
quence, and renders him fit for command, like a support that  
regders him independent of every body but the state he serves.  
  
With respect to the men, nothing but a good bounty can ob-  
tain them upon a permanent establishment: and for no shorter  
time than the continuance of the war, ought they to be engaged,  
as facts incontestibly prove that the difficulty and cost of enlist-  
ments increase with time. When the army was first raised at  
Cambridge, I am persuaded the men might have been got, with-  
eut a bounty, for the war. After this, they began to see, that  
the contest was not likely to end so speedily as was imagin-  
ed, and to feel their consequence by remarking, that to get in  
the militia in the course of the last year, many towns were indu-  
ced to give them a bounty.  
  
Foreseeing the evils resulting from this, and the destructive  
consequences which unavoidably would follow short enlistments,  
I took the liberty in a long letter (date not recollected, as my  
letter book is not here) to recommend the enlistments for and du-  
ring the war, assigning such reasons for it as experience has  
since convinced me were well founded. At that time, twenty  
dollars would, I am persuaded, have engaged the men for this  
term. But it will not do to look back: and, if the present oppor-  
tunity is slipped, I am persuaded that twelve months more will  
increase our difficulties four-fold. I shall therefore tak@*she  
freedom of giving it as my opinion, that a good bounty be imme-  
diately offered, aided by the proffer of at least a hundred ora  
hundred and fifty acres of land, and a suit of clothes and blanket  
to each non-commissioned officer and soldier; as I have good au-  
thority for saying, that, however high the men’s pay may appear,  
it is barely sufficient, in the present scarcity and dearness of all  
kinds of goods, to keep them in clothes, much less afford support  
to their families.  
  
If this encouragement then is given to the men, and such pay  
allowed the officers as will induce gentlemen of character and li

beral sentiments to engage, and proper care and precaution used  
in the nomination (having more regard to the characters of per-  
sons than the number of men they can enlist) we should in a lit-  
tle time, have an army able to cope with any that can be oppo-  
sed to it, as there are excellent materials to form one. But  
while the only merit an officer possesses, is his ability to raise  
men; while those men consider and treat him as an equal, and,  
in the character of an officer, regard him no more than a broom-  
stick, being mixed together as one common herd, no order nor  
discipline can prevail; nor will tie officer ever meet with that re-  
spect which Its essentially necessary to due subordination.  
  
To place any dependence upon militia is assuredly resting  
“upon a broken staff: men just dragged from the tender scenes of  
domestic life; unaccustomed to the din of arms; totally unac-  
quainted with every kind of military skill; which being followed by  
a want of confidence in themselves, when opposed to troops re-  
gula:ly trained, disciplined, and appointed; superior in know-  
ledge and superior in arms, makes them timid and ready to fly  
from their own shadows. Besides, the sudden change in their  
manner of living, particularly in their lodging, brings on sick-  
ness in many, impatience in all; and such an unconquerable de-  
sire of returning to their respective homes, that it not only pro-  
duces shameful and scandalous desertions among themselves, but  
infuses the like spirit into others.  
  
Again; men accustomed to unbounded freedom and no con-

therefore take liberties which the soldier is punished for. This  
creates jealousy: jealousy begets dissatisfaction; and these by  
degrees ripen into mutiny, keeping the whole army in a con-  
fused and disordered state; rendering the time of those who wish  
to see regularity and good order prevail, more unhappy than  
words can describe. Besides this, such repeated changes take  
place, that all arrangement is set at nought, and the constant  
fluctuation of things deranges every plan as fast as adopted.  
  
  
  
  
  
These, sir, congress may be assured, are but a small part of  
the inconveniences which might be enumerated, and attributed  
to militia: but there is one that merits particular attention, and  
that is the expense. Certain I am, that it would be cheaper to  
keep fifty or a hundred thousand in constant pay, than to depend  
upon half the number, and supply the other half occasionally by  
militia: The time the latter are in pay, before and after they  
are in camp, assembling and marghing; the waste of ammunition,  
the consumption of stores, which, in spite of every resolution or  
requisition of congress, they must be furnished with, or sent  
home; added to other incidental expenses consequent upon their  
coming and conduct in camp, surpasses all idea, and destroys  
every kind of regularity and economy which you could establish  
among fixed and settled troops, and will, in my opinion, prove, if  
the scheme is adhered to, the ruin of our cause.  
  
The jealousies of a standing army, and the evils to be appre-  
hended from one, are remote, and, in my judgment, situated and  
circumstanced as we are, not at all to be dreaded: but the con-  
sequence of wanting one, according to my ideas, formed from  
the present view of things, is certain and inevitable ruin. For,  
if I was called upon to declare upon oath, whether the militia  
have been most serviceable or hurtful upon the whole, I should  
subscribe to the latter. I do not mean by this, however, to ar-  
raign the conduct of congress: in so doing I should equally con-  
demn my own measures, ?{ I did not my judgment: but experi-  
ence, which is the best criterion to work by, so fully, clearly, and  
decisively reprobates the practice of trusting to militia, that no  
man who regards order, regularity and economy, or who has any  
regard for his own honour, character, or peace of mind, will risk  
them upon this issue.

there is no situation upon earth less enviable nor more distress-

my mind eonstantly upon the stretch; ‘the wounds, which my

a consciousness of my inability te govern an army composed of  
such discordant parts, and under such a variety of intricate and  
perplexing circumstances; induce not only a belief, but a tho-  
rough conviction in my mind, that it will be impossible, unless  
there is a thorough change in our military system, for me to con-  
duct matters insuch a manner as to give satisfaction to the pub-  
lic, which is all the recompense I aim at, or ever wished for.  
Before I conclude, I must apologise for the liberties taken in

“The remembrance of the difficulties which happened upon  
, pecasion last year, and the consequences which might  
the . followed the change, if proper advantages had been |  
ae the enemy, added to a knowledge of the present  
os yer and situation of the troops, afford buta very gloomy |  
: sper! in the appearance of things now, and satisfy me,  
co the possibility of a doubt, that, unless some speedy  
oat effectual measures are adopted by Congress, our cause  
will be lost. — [tis in vain to expect that any more than a  
trifling part of this army will again engage in the service on  
the encouragement ottered by Congress.  
«“ When men find that their townsmen and companions  
are receiving twenty, thirty, and more dollars for a few  
montis’ service, Which is truly the case, it cannot be ex-  
ected without using compulsion, and to foree them into  
the service would answer no valuable purpose. When  
men are irritated, and their passions inflamed, they fly  
hastily and cheerfully to arms; but after the first emotions |  
are over, to expect among such people as compose the  
pulk of an army, that they are influenced by any otber |  
principles than those of interest, is to look for what never |  
did, and I fear never will happen; the Congress will |  
deceive themselves, therefore, if they expectit. A soldier  
reasoned with upon the goodness of the cause he is en-  
gaged in, and the inestimable rights he is contending for,  
hears you with patience, and acknowledges the truth of  
your observations ; but adds that it is of no more import-  
ance to him than to others. The officer makes you the  
same reply, With this further remark : that his pay will not  
support him, and he cannot ruin himself and family to |  
  
serve his country, When every member of the community  
is equally interested and benefited by his labors. The few, |  
therefore, Who act upon principles of disinterestedness,  
comparatively speaking, are no more than a drop in the  
ocean. |  
  
“{t becomes evident to me, then, that as this contest is ||  
notlikely to be the work of a day, as the war must be carried ||  
on systematically, and to doit you must have good officers,  
there are no Other possible means to obtain them but by  
establishing your army upon a permanent footing, and  
giving your officers good pay. This will induce gentiemen  
and men of character to engage; and till the bulk of your  
officers is composed of such persons as are actuated by  
principles of honor and a spirit of enterprise, you have  
jitue to expect from them. They ought to have such allow-  
ances as Will enable them to live like and support the  
character of gentlemen, and not be driven by a seanty pit- |  
tance to the low and dirty arts which many of them prac- |  
tice, to filch from the public more than the difference of  
pay would amount to upon an ample allowance.  
  
‘Besides, something is due to the man who puts his life  
in your hands, hazards his health, and forsakes the sweets  
of domestic enjoyment. Why a captain in the continental  
service should receive no more than five shillings currency  
per day for performing the same duties that an officer of the  
same rank in the British service receives ten shillings  
sterling for, I never could conceive; especially when the  
latter is provided with every necessary he requires upon  
the best of terms, and the former can scarce procure them |  
at any rate. There is nothing that gives a man conse-  
quence, and renders him fit for command, like a support  
that renders him independent of every budy but the State  
he serves.  
  
“With respect to the men, nothing but a good bounty  
can obtain them upen a permanent establishment ; and for  
no shorter time than the continuance of the war ought  
they to be engaged, as facts incontestably prove that the  
difieulty and cost of enlistment increase with time.  
  
‘*When the army was first raised at Cambridge, I am per-  
suaded the men ought to have been got without a bounty for  
the war. After this they began to see that the contest was  
not likely to end so speedily as was imagined, and to feel  
their consequence by remarking, that to get in their militia  
in the course of the last year, many towns were induced  
to give them a bounty.  
  
“ Foreseeing the evils resulting from this, and the de-  
structive consequences which unavoidably would follow  
short enlistments, [ teok the liberty, in a long letter, to ||  
recommend the enlistments for and during the war, assign- |  
ing such reasons for it as experience has sinee convinced  
me were well founded. At that time twenty dollars would,  
{am persuaded, have engaged the men for this term. But  
it will not do to look back ; and if the present opportunity  
isslipped, I am persuaded that twelve months more will  
increase our difficulties fourfold. I shall, therefore, take  
the freedom of giving it as my opinion, that a good bounty ||  
  
should be immediately offered, aided by the proffer of at |  
jeast a hundred or a hundred and fifty acres of land, and a  
suit of clothes and blanket to each non-commissioned  
officer and*soldier, as I have good authority for saying that,  
however high the men’s pay may appear, it is barely suffi -  
cient, in the present scarcity and dearness of all kinds of  
£00ds, te keep them in clothes, much less to afford support  
to their families.  
  
“If this encouragement, then, is given to the men, and |  
such pay allowed the officers as will induce gentlenen of  
character and liberal sentiments to engage, and proper care  
and precaution are used in the nomination, more regard  
being had to the characters of persons than to the number  
of men they can enlist, we should in a little time have an  
army able to cope with any that can be opposed to it, as  
Ulere are excellent materials to form one out of.  
  
“But while the only merit an officer possesses is his  
ability to raise men, while those men consider and treat |  
him as an equal, and in the character of an officer regard |  
him no more than a broomstick, being mixed together as  
one common herd, no order nor diseipline can prevail, nor  
Will the officer ever meet with that respect which is essen-  
wally necessary to due subordination. _  
  
To place any dependence upon militia is assuredl

On the 24th of September, 1776, at Harlaem, he wrote: ar0t  
&quot; From the hours allotted to sleep I will borrow a few mo- P* ^  
ments to convey my thoughts on sundry important matters T  
to Congress. I shall offer them with the sincerity which d6],  
ought to characterize a man of candor, and with the&#x27;freedom [ (  
which may be used in giving useful information without in- &quot;  
curring the imputation of presumption. &quot;  
&quot; We are now, as it were, upon the eve of another disso- I th  
lotion of our aatny.&quot; [The term of service for almost the *n7  
whele army was to expire at or before the ond of the year.] on&#x27;J  
&quot; Tho remembrance of the difficulties which happened upon coin  
the occasion last rear, and the consequences which might of t  
have folio iced the change, if proper advantagee had been taken ther  
by the enemy, added to a knowledge of the present temper pi? 1  
and situation of the troops, afford but a very gloomy pros- P- 2  
pect in the appearance of things now, and satisfy me, beyond 0  
the possibility of a doubt, that, unless some speedy and ef- Wai  
fectual measures are adopted by Congress, our cause will be (|  
lost. It is in vain to expect that any more than a trifling  
part of this army will again engage in the service on the en- *?.P  
oouragement offered by Congress. * _,e  
  
&quot; When men iind that their townsmen and oempanions are J*&quot;&quot;  
rooeiving twenty, thirty, and more dollars for a few months&#x27;  
service, which is truly the case, it cannot be expected with- *?&#x27;  
out using compulsion, and to force them into the servioe  
would answer no valuable purpose. When men ?r? irritated, J  
and their passions inflamed, they fly hastily and cheerfully tb0&#x27;  
to arms ; but after the first emotions are over, to expect O  
among such people as compose the bulk of an army, that 0ne&lt;  
thay are influenced by any other principles than those of in- Ta{(  
terest, is to look for what never did, and I fear never will,  
happen ; the Congress will deceive themselves, therefore, if *&#x27;  
they expeot it. A soldier reasoned with upon the goodness bad  
of the cause he is engaged in, and the inestimable rights he &quot;?&#x27;  
is contending for, hears you with patience, and acknowledges &quot;?.v&quot;  
the truth of your observations; but adds that it is of no more &#x27;*?&#x27;  
importance to him than to others. The effloer makes you the &#x27;enjj  
same reply, with this further remark : that his pay w}ll not  
support him, and he cannot ruin himself and family to serve  
his country, wheit every member of the community is equally &#x27;*ac  
Interested and benefited by bis labors. The few, therefore, 1  
who act upon principles or disinterestedness, comparatively  
speaking, are no more than a drop in the ooean.  
&quot; It becomes evident to me, then, that as this contest is not j&#x27;*01  
likely to be the work of a day, as the war must be carried on J01?  
systematically, and to do It you must bare good offlcors, there .  
are no other poesiblo means to obtain them but by establishlog  
your army upon a permanent footing, and giving your  
officers gocd pay. This will induco gentlemen and men of ml&#x27;1  
character to engage ; and till the bulk ot your officers Is com- ot  
posed of such persons as are actuated by principles of honor the  
and a spirit of enterprise, you have Utile to expert from them. Kre&#x27;  
They ought to have such allowances as will enable thenj to J&quot;IB  
live like and support the charaoter of gentlemen, and not be j&quot;?*  
driven by a scanty pittance to the low and dirty arts which &quot;n*  
many of them practise, to filch from the public wore than 0,0,1  
the difference of pay would amount to npon an ample allow- T  
ance. Wa  
&quot; Besides, something is due to the man who puts his life in tioo  
your hands, hazards his health, and forsakes the sweets of al,g  
domestic enjoyment. Why a captain in the continental servioes  
should receive no more than five shillings currency per ...  
day for performing the same duties that an oflieer of the same  
rank in the British service receives ten shillings sterling for,| &quot;

ihing that give# a man consequenoe, and renders falu I  
&gt;mtiiand, like a support that renders him independent I  
&#x27;body but the State be serves.  
With respect to the men, nothing but a goed bounty cs  
in them upon a permanent establishment; and for i  
Lor time than tbe continuance of the war ought they (  
gaged, as faetj incontestably prove that the difficult  
cost of enlistment increase with time.  
When the army was first raised at Cambridge, I am pel  
td the men ought to have been got without a bounty ft  
rar. After this they began to see that tbe contest wi  
ikely to end so speedily as was imagined, and to fe&lt;  
consequence by remarking, that to get in their rniliti  
e course of thelast year, many towns were induced I  
them a county.  
&#x27;oreeeeing the evils resulting from this, und the destrui  
consequences which unavoidably would follow short ei  
ents, 1 took the liberty, in a long letter, to rocon  
i the enlistments for, and (luring the war, assigning sue  
ins for it as sxperiouce has since convinced me were we  
led. At that time twenty dollars would, 1 am persuade!  
engaged the men for this term. But it will not do &lt;  
back; and If the present opportunity Is slipped, 1 ai  
taded that twelve months more will increase our ditliou  
our fold. I shall, therefore, take the freedom of givin  
my opinion, that a good bounty should be immediate)  
ed, aided by the prober of at least a hundred or a hui  
and tifty acres of land, and a suit of clothes and blunki  
ch non-commissioned olliosr and soldier, as I have goc  
ority for saying that, however high the men&#x27;s pay ms  
ar, It is barely sufficient, in the present scarcity as  
uess of all hluus of goods, to keep them in clothes, tnu*  
:o sfiord support to their families.  
If this enoouragement, then, is given to the ineD, an  
pay allowed the officers as will induce gentlemen i  
acter and liberal sentiments to engage, ana proper cat  
precaution are used in the nomination, more regard hi  
had to the characters of persons than to the number &lt;  
they can enlist, we should in a little time have an arm  
to cope with any that can be opposed to it, as there ai  
llent materials to form one out of.  
Hut while the only merit an officer possesses Is his abllil  
iise men, while those men consider and treat him as i  
I, and in the character of an officer regard him no rnoi  
a broomstick, being mixed together nMrfkusiui  
, no order nor discipline can prevail,  
meet with that respect which is essenu^^^^HPry f  
iubordination.  
To place any dependence upon militia is alSuredly res

n writing to the President of Congress   
Washington makes the following remarks,   
wkich should be remembered by our peo­  
ple at this time. Something is due to   
the man who puts his life in your hands—  
hazards his health and forsakes the sweets   
of home and his domestic enjoyments.   
My opinion is that a good bounty should   
be offered, added by the proffer of at least   
100 to 150 acres of land and a suit of   
clothes and a blanket to a non commis­  
sioned officer and soldier. However high   
the man&#x27;s pay may appear, it is barely   
sufficient, in the present scarcity and dear   
nese of all kinds of goods, to keep them   
in clothes, much less to afford support to   
their families.&quot;
