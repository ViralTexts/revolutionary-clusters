4th. Forded the Susquehanna; nearly a mile wide, including the Island—at the lower end of wch. the road crosses it.  
On the Cumberland Side I found a detachment of the Philadelphia light horse ready to receive, and escort me to Carlisle 17 miles; where I arrived at about 11 Oclock. Two miles short of it, I met the Governors of Pennsylvania &amp; New Jersey with all the Cavalry that had rendezvouzed at that place drawn up—passed them—and the Infantry of Pennsylvania before I alighted at my quarters.

 Dunlap, a prominent Philadelphia printer. In 1771 he became printer of the Pennsylvania Packet and in 1784 joined with David C. Claypoole to publish the paper as a daily. Dunlap &amp; Claypoole were printers to the Continental Congress during the Confederation and in 1794 were publishing the Daily Advertiser in Philadelphia. Dunlap had served in the 1st Troop of Philadelphia Light Horse during the Revolution and was captain of the troop during the insurrection (Pa. ArchivesSamuel Hazard et al., eds.

15th. Left Bath by seven oclock; &amp; crossing the Cacapohon Mountain, &amp; the Potomack River by a very rough road, we breakfasted at one Goldens—distant about 7 Miles—Bated our horses at a very indifferent place abt. 13 Miles further on—and lodged at the Old Town 33 or 34 Miles. This distance from the extreme  
  
badness of the Road, more than half of it being very hilly, &amp; great part of it Stoney, was a severe days Journey for the Carriage horses; they performed it however, well.  
  
  
  
16th. After an early breakfast we set out for Cumberland—and about 11 Oclock arrived there.  
Three miles from the Town I was met by a party of Horse under the command of Major Lewis (my Nephew) and by Brigr. Genl. Smith of the Maryland line, who Escorted me to the Camp; where, finding all the Troops under Arms, I passed along the line of the Army; &amp; was conducted to a house the residence of Major Lynn of the Maryland line (an old Continental Officer) where I was well lodged, &amp; civily entertained.

19th. In company with Genl. Lee, who I requested to attend me, that all the arrangements necessary for the Army’s crossing the Mountns. in two columns might be made; Their routs, &amp; days Marches fixed, that the whole might move in Unison—and accompanied by the Adjutant General and my own family we set out, abt. eight oclock, for Bedford, and making one halt at the distance of 12 Miles, reached it a little after 4 oclock in the afternoon being met a little out of the Encampment by Govr. Mifflin—Govr. Howell—&amp; several other Officers of distinction.  
Quarters were provided for me at the House of a Mr. Espy.  
  
Prothonotary of the County of Bedford—to which I was carried &amp; lodged very comfortably.  
The Road from Cumberld. to this place is, in places, stoney but in other respects not bad. It passes through a Valley the whole way; and was opened by Troops under my command in the Autumn of 1758. The whole Valley consists of good farming land, &amp; part of it—next Cumberland—is tolerably well improved in its culture but not much so in Houses.  
  
  
  
On 19 Oct., Dr. Wellford noted in his diary that “this morning the President of the United States set out for Bedford on his return to the right wing of the Army, &amp; from there to the seat of Government. . . . The Cavalry this morning escorted the President about five miles from (camp), when he requested the Troops to return, &amp; taking leave spoke to Major George Lewis as follows: ‘George, You are the eldest of five nephews that I have in this Army, let your conduct be an example to them, and do not turn your back until you are ordered.’ Major Lewis made a suitable reply, but from this address of the President it was conjectured that the Troops would not be entirely disbanded at the end of the three months’ service.  
  
  
  
  
“Mem: The President’s five nephews are Major George Lewis, Commandant of the Cavalry. Major Laurence Lewis, Aid de Camp to Major Genl. Morgan. Mr. Howell Lewis, in Capt. Mercer’s troop. and Mr. Saml. Washington (son of Col. Ch’s Washington), and Mr. Laurence Washington (son of Col. Saml. Washington), both of whom are light horsemen in the troop lately commanded by Capt.

Matters being thus arranged I wrote a farewell address to the Army through the Commander in Chief—Govr.

ment had taken to suppress the insurrection and gave his own views as to its cause: “During the session of the year 1790, it was expedient to exercise the legislature power, granted by the constitution of the United States, ‘to lay and collect excises.’ In a majority of the States, scarcely an objection was heard to this mode of taxation. In some indeed, alarms were at first conceived; until they were banished by reason and  
  
patriotism. In the four western counties of Pennsylvania, a prejudice, fostered and embittered by the artifice of men who labored for an ascendency over the will of others by the guidance of their passions, produced symptoms of riot and violence. It is well known, that Congress did not hesitate to examine the complaints which were presented; and to relieve them, as far as justice dictated, or general convenience would permit, But the impression, which this moderation made on the discontented, did not correspond, with what it deserved. The arts of delusion were no longer confined to the efforts of designing individuals. The very forbearance to press prosecutions was misinterpreted into a fear of urging the execution of the laws; and associations of men began to denounce threats against the officers employed. From a belief, that, by a more formal concert, their operation might be defeated; certain self-created societies assumed the tone of condemnation. Hence, while the greater part of Pennsylvania itself were conforming themselves to the acts of excise; a few counties were resolved to frustrate them. It was now perceived, that every expectation from the tenderness which had been hitherto pursued, was unavailing, and that further delay could only create an opinion of impotency or irresolution in the government. Legal process was, therefore, delivered to the Marshal, against rioters and delinquent distiller

with Gen’ [Henry] Lee, who I requested to attend me, that

4 oclock in the afternoon being met a little out of the En-  
campment by Gov&quot; Mifflin Gov’ Howell—&amp; several other

At Bedford: “ October 20.—Called the Quarter Master  
General, Adjutant General, Contractor, &amp; others of the  
Staff departm’ before me, &amp; the Commander in chief  
[Henry Lee], at 9 oclock this morning, in order to fix on  
the Routs of the two columns &amp; their stages ;—and when  
they w‘ be able to put the Army in motion.—Also to obtain  
a correct return of the strength—and to press the command-  
ing Officers of Corps to prepare with all the Celerity in their  
power for a forward movement.—Upon comparing acc* it  
was found that the army could be put in motion [on the]  
23*—and it was so ordered. . . . Matters being thus arranged  
I wrote a farewell address to the Army through the Com-  
mander in chief Gov&quot; Lee—to be published in orders—and  
having prepared his Instructions and made every arrange-  
ment that occurred, as necessary I prepared for my return  
to Philadelphia in order to meet Congress, and to attend to  
the Civil duties of my Office.” — Washington’s Diary.
