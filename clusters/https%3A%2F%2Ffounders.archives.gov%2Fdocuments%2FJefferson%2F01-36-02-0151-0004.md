Gentlemen  
[1 Jan. 1802]  
  
I concur with you in the sentiments expressed in your kind address on behalf of the inhabitants of the town of Cheshire, that the constitution of the United States is a Charter of authorities and duties, not a Charter of rights to it’s officers; and that among it’s most precious provisions are the right of suffrage, the prohibition of religious tests, and it’s means of peaceable amendment. nothing ensures the duration of this fair fabric of government so effectually as the due sense entertained, by the body of our citizens, of the value of these principles, &amp; their care to preserve them.  
I recieve, with particular pleasure, the testimony of good will with which your citizens have been pleased to charge you. it presents an extraordinary proof of the skill with which those domestic arts, which contribute so much to our daily comfort, are practised by them, and particularly by that portion of them most interesting to the affections, the cares &amp; the happiness of man.  
To myself, this mark of esteem from freeborn farmers, employed personally in the useful labors of life, is peculiarly grateful. having no wish but to preserve to them the fruits of their labour, their sense of this truth will be my highest reward.  
I pray you, gentlemen, to make my thanks for their favor acceptable to them, &amp; to be assured yourselves of my high respect and esteem.

GentleMen:I concur with you in the sen­  
timents expressed in your kind address in behalf  
of the inhabitants of the town of Cheshire. The  
Constitution of the United States is a charter of  
authorities and duties, and not a charter of rights  
to its officers, and that among its most generous  
provisions are the right of suffrage, the prohibi­  
tion of religious tests, and its means of peaceable  
amendment. Nothing ensures the duration of  
this fair fabric of Government so effectually as the  
due sense entertained by the body of our citi­  
zens, of the value of those principles, and their  
care to preserve them.  
I receive with particular pleasure that testi­  
mony of good-will, with which your citizens have  
been pleased to charge you for me. It presents  
an extraordinary proof of the skill with which  
those domestic arts which contribute so much to  
our daily comfort are practiced by them, and par­  
ticularly by that portion of them most interesting  
to the affections, the care and the happiness of  
man.  
To myself this mark of esteem from free-born  
farmers, employed personally in the useful labors  
of life, is peculiarly grateful. Having no wish but  
to preserve to them the fruits of their labor, their  
sense of this truth will be my highest reward.
