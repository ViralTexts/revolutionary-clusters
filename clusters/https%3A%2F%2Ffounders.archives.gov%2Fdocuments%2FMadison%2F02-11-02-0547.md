Sir  
London May 17. 1806.  
  
After my interview with Mr. Fox on the 25. ulto. I waited a fortnight without hearing from him. This new instance of delay surprised me, because he had shewn a sensibility to the former one, and did not seem aware of the necessity of adding to it. Independent of the general object, the war with Prussia and the blockades incident to it, the doctrine and practice respecting which it was necessary to arrange, furnished a new motive for a communication with him. On mature reflection I thought it best to call informally, which I did on the 11th; with a view to enter on these topicks in the familiar manner I had heretofore done. Mr. Fox was at the Office but did not receive me. He sent the expression of his regret at not being able to do it, being as he said just going to attend the Cabinet who were waiting for him. I called again on the 13th and experienc’d the same result, tho’ I had left word that I should then be there. I was informed by his desire that a summons from the King to attend him at the Palace prevented his receiving me on that day. I met him on the 15th. at the Drawing Room but had no opportunity of speaking to him. Sir Fras. Vincent, the first Under Secretary of State being acquainted with my desire, promised to arrange with him an interview and to inform me of it. These are the only circumstances worthy notice which  
  
have occurred here since my last, ’till to-day. I mention them that you may be better enabled to judge correctly in all respects of the light in which the incident of this day ought to be viewed. Early this morning I received from Mr. Fox a note of which a Copy is enclosed, which you will perceive embraces explicitly a principal subject depending between our governments, tho’ in rather a Singular mode. A Similar communication is I presume made to the other Ministers, tho’ of that I have no information. The Note is couched in terms of restraint and professes to extend the blockade further than was heretofore done; nevertheless it takes it from many Ports already blockaded, indeed from all East of ostend and West of the Seine, except in articles contraband of war &amp; enemies property, which are seizable without a blockade. And in like form of exception, considering every enemy as one power, it admits the trade of Neutrals within the same limit, to be free, in the productions of enemies colonies in every but the direct route between the colony and the parent country. I have however been too short a time in the possession of this paper to trace it in all its consequences in regard to this question. It cannot be doubted that the Note was drawn by the government in reference to the question, and if intended by the Cabinet as a foundation on which Mr. Fox is authorised to form a treaty, and obtained by him for the purpose, it must be viewed in a very favorable light. It seems clearly to put an end to further Seizures on the principle which has been heretofore in contestation. I am engaged by invitation with Mr. Fox on the 19th. when it is probable I may have an opportunity of conversing with him and thereby enabled to form a satisfactory opinion on the subject. I hasten however to forward you the enclosed with the above details as it is important for you to have them. It is worthy of attention that at the Drawing Room on the 15th. it was whispered about that the Bill for prohibiting the importation of British goods &amp;c. has passed the Senate, of which it was said that intelligence had that morning been received. It evidently produced some sensation which was doubtless the stronger from the idea then entertained that the Bill was to commence its operation at an early day. I observe however with pleasure that on the whole the measure is considered by the Govt. Papers, on account of the distant period at which it does commence rather as a pacific than a hostile one. I persuade myself that the present Ministry will See in the circumstance of delay, a strong proof of the disposition of the U. States not only to preserve the relations of peace with G. Britain, but of their confidence that the Ministry is animated with the same desire. I cannot help remarking likewise the fact that this paper was sent me immediately after the passage of the Bill was Known.

 a strong presumption that the Govt. Papers judge correctly of the Sentiments of the Govrt. on that point.

which \ ou will perceive embraces expiicitlv&#x27;  
a principal subject depending between our

i slime, made to tlie other ministers, cli High  
ol that 1 have no information. The note is  
couched in terms o. restraint, and professes  
to extend the blockade further than v\ a*

from many ports alt eu!y block...tied, indeed  
Imm all east ol Osteud and west of Jie Seine,  
except in articles contraband of war and en­

considering every enemy as rue power, ic  
admits the trade of neutrals, within the same  
limit, to be free, in the procl.icti ms of ene­  
mies colonies, in every but the direct route  
between the colony and the parent c untrv.  
j 1 have however been too short a time in hes  
p issessio. of this paper to trace it in all its  
consequences ii regard to tills question. Jr  
cann.it be doubted, that the note was drawn  
by the government in refe rence to the ques­  
tion, and if intended by the cabinet as a foun­  
dation ou whicli Mr.’Fox is authorized to.  
form a treaty, ife obtained by him for the pur­  
pose, it must be viewed in a very favora­  
ble light. ■ It seems clearly to put an end  
to further seizures, on the principle  
which has been heretofore in contestation.  
I am engaged, by invitation, with Mi Fox,  
on the 19th, when it is probable I may have

thereby enabled to form a satisfactory opini­  
on on the subject. I hasten however t&lt;» for­

as it is important for you to have them. It is  
Worthy of attention, that at ’lie Drawing  
I(oorp, on the 15th it was wh&#x27;»p *red about,  
that the bill for prohibiting the inipot tiort  
ol Hfi.ish goods, See. had passed the ,.tc,  
of which it was said, that ititel.igcurr &#x27;tad  
that morning been received It evidently  
produced some sensation, which was doubt­  
less the stronger, iimiii the idea then enter­

me isure is considered by tbc government  
paper*, yn account of the distant priind it  
whicli it doe:, commence, rather ns a p.’cif
