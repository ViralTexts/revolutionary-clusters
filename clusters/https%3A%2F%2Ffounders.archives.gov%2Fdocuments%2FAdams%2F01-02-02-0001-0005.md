 Cows, Walls, Fences, Workmen, Office, Books, and Clerks. I want to hear the News, and Politicks of the Day. But here I am, at Bissills in Windsor, hearing my Landlord read a Chapter in the Kitchen and go to Prayers with his Family, in the genuine Tone of a Puritan.  
  
  
  
1771. Saturday June 8th.  
  
  
Bissill says, there are Settlements, upon this River, for 300 Miles— i.e. from Seabrook Saybrook where it discharges itself. The River, in the Spring, when the Snow melts, swells prodigiously and brings down the Washings of Mountains and old Swamps, rotten Wood and Leaves &amp;c. to inrich the Intervale Lands, upon its banks.  
At eleven O Clock arrived at Wrights in Weathersfield. I have spent this Morning in Riding thro Paradise. My Eyes never beheld so fine a Country. From Bissills in Windsor to Hartford Ferry, 8 Miles, is one continued Street—Houses all along, and a vast Prospect of level Country on each Hand, the Lands very rich and the Husbandry pretty good. The Town of Hartford is not very compact, there are some very handsome and large Houses, some of brick. The State House is pretty large, and looks well. I stopped only to oat my Horse and get my Head and Face shaved, and then rode to Weathersfield 4 miles, on the West Side of the River.—Here is the finest Ride in America, I believe. Nothing can exceed the Beauty, and Fertility of the Country. The Lands upon the River, the flatt low Lands, are loaded with rich, noble Crops of Grass, and Grain and Corn. Wright says, some of their Lands, will yeild 2 Crops of English Grass, and two Ton and an half at each Crop, and plenty of after feed besides—but these must be nicely managed and largely dunged. They have in Weathersfield a large brick Meeting House, Lockwood the Minister. A Gentleman came in and told me, that there was not such another Street in America as this at Weathersfield excepting one at Hadley, and that Mr. Ingersol the Stamp Master told him, he had never seen in Phyladelphia nor in England, any Place equal to Hartford and Weathersfield

ast, and I am not yet homeward bound. I wish Connecticutt River flowed through Braintree. But the barren rocky Mountains of Braintree are as great a Contrast as can be conceived to the level smoth, fertile Plains of this Country. Yet Braintree pleases me more.  
I long to be foul of Deacon Belchers Orchard. I am impatient to begin my Canal, and banks, to convey the Water all round, by the Road and the House. I must make a Pool in the Road by the Corner of my Land at the Yard in front of the House, for the cool Spring Water to come into the Road there—that the Cattle, and Hogs, and Ducks may regale themselves there.  
Looking into the Almanac, I am startled. Superior Court Ipswich is the 18th. day of June. I thought it a Week later 25. So that I have only next Week to go home 150 Miles. I must improve every Moment. It is 25 miles a day if I ride every day next Week

Read also another Sermon on the Reward of Justice. “There is, says the Dr., a Duty of Justice towards the Public. There is incumbent upon Men the very same Obligation, not to wrong the Community; as there is, not to violate any private Mans Right, or defraud any particular Person of his Property. The only Reason, why Men are not always sufficiently sensible of this; so that many, who are very just in their Dealings between Man and Man, will yet be very fraudulent or rapacious with Regard to the Public; is b

 supporting and countenancing all Bernards Measures, and the Commissioners and Army and Navy, and Revenue, and every other Thing we complain of.  
I read to day an Address from the Convention of Ministers, and from the Clergy in the northern Part of the County of Hampshire and from the Town of Almesbury Amesbury, all conceived in very high Terms, of Respect and Confidence and Affection. Posterity will scarcely find it possible, to form a just Idea of this Gentlemans Character. But if this wretched Journal should ever be read, by my own Family, let them know that there was upon the Scene of Action with Mr. Hutchinson, one determined Enemy to those Principles and that Political System to which alone he owes his own and his Family’s late Advancement—one who thinks that his Character and Conduct have been the Cause of laying a Foundation for perpetual Discontent and Uneasiness between Britain and the Colonies, of perpetual Struggles of one Party for Wealth and Power at the Expence of the Liberties of this Country, and of perpetual Contention and Opposition in the other Party to preserve them, and that this Contention will never be fully terminated but by Warrs, and Confusions and Carnage. Caesar, by destroying the Roman Republic, made himself perpetual Dictator, Hutchinson, by countenancing and supporting a System of Corruption and all Tyranny, has made himself Governor—and the mad Idolatry of the People, always the surest Instruments of their own Servitude, laid prostrate at the Feet of both. With great Anxiety, and Hazard, with continual Application to Business, with loss of Health, Reputation, Profit, and as fair Prospects and Opportunities of Advancement, as others who have greedily embraced them, I have for 10 Years together invariably opposed this System, and its fautors. It has prevailed in some Measure, and the People are now worshipping the Authors and Abetters of it, and despizing, insulting, and abusing, the Opposers of it.—Edward and Alfred  
  
closed their long Glories with a Sigh to find  
th’ unwilling Gratitude of base Mankind.

.  
Overtook Judge Cushing in his old Curricle and 2 lean Horses, and Dick his Negro at his Right Hand driving the Curricle. This is the Way of travelling in 1771. A Judge of the Circuits, a Judge of the Superiour Court, a Judge of the Kings Bench, Common Pleas, and Exchequer for the Province, travells, with a Pair of wretched old Jades of Horses, in a wretched old Dung Cart of a Curricle, and a Negro, on the same seat with him, driving.—But we shall have more glorious Times anon—When the Sterling Salaries are ordered out of the Revenue, to the Judges &amp;c., as many most ardently wish—and the Judges themselves, among the rest I suppose. Stopped at Martins in Lynn with J. Cushing, oated, and drank a Glass of Wine—And heard him sigh and groan the Sighs and Groans of 77, tho he is yet active. He conversed in his usual, hinting, insinuating, doubting, scrupling Strain.  
Rode with King a D. Sherriff who came out to meet the Judges, into Salem, put up at Goodhues. The Negro that took my Horse soon began to open his Heart.—He did not like the People of Salem, wanted to be sold to Captn. John Dean of Boston. He earned 2 Dollars in a forenoon, and did all he could to give Satisfaction. But his Mistress was cross, and said he did not earn Salt to his Porridge, &amp;c. and would not find him Cloaths &amp;c.  
Thus I find Discontents in all Men. The Black thinks his Merit rewarded with Ingratitude, and so does the white. The Black estimates his own Worth, and the Merit of his Services higher than any Body else. So does the White. This flattering, fond Opinion of himself, is found in every Man.  
I have hurt myself to day, by taking cold in the forenoon and by drinking too much Wine, at Kettles and at Martins. I drank 1/2 Pint at Kettles and 2 Glasses at Martins.

June 25, 1771, that ““Mr. Lowell, who practised much  
in New Hampshire, gave me an account of many  
strange judgments of the Superior Court at Ports-  
mouth.” In those days, and for years after the Rev-  
olution, the judges made the law to suit the case.  
They cared so little for precedents that a certain Chief  
Justice, on being reminded that his decision contra-  
dicted one he had previously given, quoted the prov-  
erb, “Every tub must stand on its own bottom.”  
  
Many of the judges had not been tied to the law.  
One, John Dudley, was a farmer and trader. He had  
little learning of any kind, and seldom spoke good  
English. But such were his sagacity, discrimination,  
common-sense, patience and integrity that he was

the front and side galleries were crowded with  
rows of lads and lasses who performed all

as at Northampton, the women had appar-

Besides, as was demanded in the course of these debates, if  
the ruling class in England have the will, have they the time

inflicted by seven centuries of mismanagement? Is not the  
“empire ” too extensive to admit of such exclusive attention to  
the wants and wishes of a single country? Does it come within  
the circumference of possibility? Ireland needs special legisla-

happens, besides, that many, and English rulers among the rest,  
who are very just in their dealings between man and man, will yet

way of travelling in 1771; a Judge of Circuits, a judge  
of the Superior Court, a judge of the King’s Bench, Com¬  
mon Pleas, and Exchequer for the Province, travels with  
a pair of wretched old jades of horses in a wretched old  
hnng-cart of a curricle, and a negro on the same seat with  
dim driving.”  
  
The negro was doubtless the judge’s property. Adams’s  
account of arriving at the King’s Arms, with a glimpse of  
slavery here, is thus noticed :  
  
&quot; Put up at Goodhue’s. The negro that took my horse  
soon began to open his heart; he did not like the people  
of Salem ; wanted to be sold to Capt. John Dean of Bos¬  
ton ; he earned two dollars in a forenoon, and did all he  
coiild to give satisfaction, but his Mistress was cross, and  
said he did not earn salt to his porridge, etc.”  
  
Then the distinguished guest,—one of these days to be  
President of the United States, of which he then never  
dreamed—adds a delicate confession as follows :  
  
”I have hurt myself to-day by biking cold in the fore¬  
noon, and by drinking too much wine at Kettels and at  
Martin’s. I drank half a pint at Kettels and two glasses  
at Martin’s.”
