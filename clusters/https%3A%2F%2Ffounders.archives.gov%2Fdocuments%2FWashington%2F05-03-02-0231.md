Gentlemen of the Senate,  
[New York] August 6th 1789  
  
My nomination of Benjamin Fishbourn for the place of Naval Officer of the Port of Savannah not having met with your concurrence, I now nominate Laclan McIntosh for that place. Whatever may have been the reasons which induced your dissent, I am persuaded they were such as you deemed sufficient—Permit me to submit to your consideration, whether on occasions, where the propriety of nomiminations appear questionable to you, it would not be expedient to communicate that circumstance to me, and thereby avail yourselves of the  
  
information which led me to make them, and which I would with pleasure lay before you. Probably my reasons for nominating Mr Fishbourn may tend to shew that such a mode of proceeding in such cases might be useful. I will therefore detail them.  
First. While Colonel Fishbourn was an Officer in actual service, and chiefly under my own Eye, his conduct appeared to me irreproachable; nor did I ever hear any thing injurious to his reputation as an Officer or a Gentleman—At the Storm of Stony Point, his behaviour was represented to have been active, and brave, and he was charged by his General to bring the account of that success to the Head Quarters of the Army.  
Secondly—Since his residence in Georgia he has been repeatedly elected to the Assembly as a Representative of the County of Chatham in which the Port of Savannah is situated, and sometimes of the Counties of Glynn and Camden—he has been chosen a Member of the Executive Council of the State and has been lately President of the same—he has been elected by the Officers of the Militia in the county of Chatham Lieutenant Colonel of the Militia in that district—and on a very recent occasion, to wit, in the month of May last, he has been appointed by the Council (on the suspension of the late Collector) to an Office in the Port of Savannah, nearly similar to that for which I nominated him—which Office he actually holds at this time—To these reasons for nominating Mr Fishbourn, I might add that I received private letters of recommendation, and oral testimonials in his favor, from some of the most respectable characters in that State: but as they were secondary considerations with me, I do not think it necessary to communicate them to you. It appeared therefore to me that Mr Fishbourn must have enjoyed the confidence of the militia Officers in order to have been elevated to a military rank; the confidence of the Freemen to have been elected to the Assembly; the confidence of the Assembly to have been selected for the Council; and the confidence of the Council to have been appointed Collector of the Port of Savannah.

GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE: My nomination of  
Benjamin Fishbourn for the place of Naval Officer  
of the Port of Savannah not having met with your  
soncurrence, I now nominate Lochlan McIntosh  
for that office.  
  
Whatever may have been the reasons which in-  
duced your dissent, 1 am persuaded they were such  
as you deemed sufficient. Permit me to submit to  
your consideration whether, on occasions when  
the propriety of nominations appears questionable  
to you, it would not be expedient to communicate  
that circumstance to me, and thereby avail your-  
selves of the information which led me to make  
them, and which I would with pleasure lay before  
  
ou. Probably my reasons for nominating Mr.  
  
shbourn may tend to show that such a mode of  
roceeding in such cases might be useful, I will,  
Rrerefore. detail them.  
  
First—While Col. Fishbourn was an officer in ac-  
sual service, and chiefly under my own eye, his con-  
4uct appeared to me irreproachable, nor did I ever  
bear anything injurious to his reputation as an ot-  
ficer or asagentieman. At the storming of Stuny  
Point his behavior was represented to have been  
active and brave, and he was charged by his Gen-  
sral to bring the account of that success to the  
bead-quarters of the Army.  
  
Second~Since his residence in Georgia he has  
been repeatedly elected to the Assembly asa Repre-  
sentative of the County of Chatham, in which the  
port of Savannah {s situated, and sometimes of the  
counties of Glynn and Camden: he has been chosen  
a member of the Executive Council of the State,  
and has Jately been President of the same; he has  
been elected by the officers of the Militia in the  
County of Chatham Lieutenant-Colonel of the Mih-  
tia in that district; and.on a very recent occasion,  
to wit, in the month of May last, he has been ap-  
pointed by the Council (on the suspension of the  
late Collector) to an office in the port of Savan-  
pab nearly similar to that for which I nominated  
him, which office he actually holds at this time.  
fo these reasons for nominating Mr. Fishbourn 1  
might add that I received private letters of recom-  
mendation and oral testimony in his favor from  
some of the most respectable characters in that

State; but as they were secondary considerations  
with meIdo not think it necessary to communi-  
cate them to you.  
  
It q comer, therefore, to me that Mr. Fishbourn  
must have enjoyed the confidence of the Militia offi-  
cers in order to have been elected to a military rank,  
the confidence of the freemen to have been elected to  
the Assembly, the confidence of the Assembly to have  
been selected for the Council, and the confidence of  
the Council to have been appointed ‘Collector of

message, dated New York, Aug. 6, 1789:  
&quot;EnTLeMen oF THe SenAte: My nomination  
of Benjamin Fishbourn for the place of naval  
officer for the port ofs Savannah not having  
met with your concurrence, I now nominate  
Lachlan Melntosh for that office.  
&quot;Whatever may have been the reasons which  
induced your dissent, I am persuaded they  
were such as you deemed sufficlent. Permit  
me to submit to your consideration whether,  
on occasions where the propriety of nomina­  
tions appears questionable to you, it would not  
be expedient to commnunicate that circum­  
stance to me, and thereby avall yourselves of  
the information which led me to make them,  
and which I would with pleasure lay before  
you. Probably my reasons for nominating  
Mr. Fishbourn? may tend to show that such a  
mode of proceeding, in such cases, might be  
nseful. I will therefore detail them.  
&quot;Eirst. While Col, Fishbourn was an officer,  
in actual service, and chiefly under my own  
eyes, his conduct appeared to me irreproach  
able; nor did I ever hear anything injurions to  
his reputation as anofficer tor a gentloman.  
At the storming of Stony Point, his behaylor  
was represented to have been active and brave,  
and he was charged by his general to bring the  
account of that success to the headquarters of  
the army.  
&quot;Secondly. Since his residence in Georgla,  
he has been repeatedly elected to the assembly  
as a representative of the county of Chatham,  
in which the port of Savannah is situated, and  
sometimes of the counties of Glynn and Cam-  
den; he has been chosen a momber of the  
executive council of the state, and has lately  
been president of the same; he has been  
elected by the officers of the militia, in the  
county of Chatham, lieutenant colonel of the  
militia in that district; and, on a very recent  
occasion, to wit, in the month of May last,  
he has been appointed by tha council  
on the suspension of the late colle­  
ton to an oce in the por  
of Savannah, nearly similar to that for which  
I nominated him, which office he actually holds  
at this time. To these reasons for nominating  
  
Mr. Fishbourn I might add that I received  
private letters of recommendation and orcltesti­  
monials in his favor from some of the most re­  
spectable characters in that state; but as they  
were secondary considerations with me, I do  
not think it necessary to communicate them  
to you.  
&quot;It appeared, therefore, to me that Mr. Fish­  
bourn must have enjoyed the constdence of the  
milia officers in order to have been elected  
to a military rank; the conidence of the free­  
men, to have been elected to the assembly;  
the confidence of the assembly, to have been  
selected for the council, and the confidence of  
the council, to have been appointed collector  
of the port of Savannah.

of record. An instance of this is the case of Benjamin Fish-  
bourn, nominated to be naval officer of the port of Savannah.  
The Senate having rejected him, probably on grounds involving  
political or personal opposition, Washington nominated Lachlan  
McIntosh, observing in his message of August 7, 1789, that he  
presumed the reasons for the Senate’s action were sufficient, but  
adding: “ Permit me to submit to your consideration whether, on  
occasions where the propriety of nominations appear questionable  
to you, it would not be expedient to communicate that circum-  
stance to me, and thereby avail yourselves of the information  
which led me to make them, and which | would with pleasure lay  
before you.” He gives his reasons for having nominated Fish-  
bourn, who served under his eye in the war and whose condu  
was “irreproachable.”” He behaved gallantly at the storming of  
Stony Point. Since his residence in Georgia he had bee

Mit $  vise deserves to be reproduced: &quot;While Col.  
ENe $ 1.e.3. Fishbourn was an officer in actual service and  
N $0. chiefly under my own eve, his conduct appeared  
 $$ to me irreproachable; nor did I ever hear any-  
e 13 1j9s thing injurious to his reputation as an officer or  
 $ .6 a gentleman. At the storming of Stony Point his  
 $. i behavior was gepresented to have been active  
N$ C2,&quot; and brave, ang he was charged by his General  
a    
e e  
ane witewrsteiseteoue  
eaie  
  
to bring the account of that success to the head­  
quarters of the army.  
Secondly- Since his residence in Georgia he  
has been repeatedly elected to the Assembly a  
a representative of the county of Chatham, in  
which the port of Savannah is situated, and  
sometimes of the counties of Glynn and Cam­  
dent he has been chosen a member of the Exee­  
utive Council of the State, and has latelr been  
President of the same; he has been elected by  
the officers of the militia in the county of Chat­  
ham Lieutenant-Colonel of the militia in that  
district, and on a very recent occasion, to wit,  
in the month of May last, he has been appointed  
by the Council (on the suspension of the late  
Collector) to an office in the port of Savannah  
nearly similar to that for which I nomi­  
nated him, which office he actually holds at  
this time. To these reasons for nominating Mr.  
Fishbourn I might add that I received private  
letters of recommendation and oral testimonials  
in his favor from some of the most respectable  
characters in that State; but as they were  
secondary considerations with me, I do not  
think it necessary to communicate them to you.  
&quot;It appeared, therefore, to me that Mr. Fish­  
bourn must have enjoyed the confidence of  
the militia officers in order to have beon elected  
to a military rank; the confidence of the freemen  
to have been elected to the Assembly; the con­  
dence of the Assembly to have been selected for  
the council, and the confidence of the council to  
have been appointed Collector of the Port of  
Savannah.
