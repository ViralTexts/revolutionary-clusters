[Annapolis, September 14, 1786]  
To the Honorable the Legislatures of Virginia, Delaware Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York.  
The Commissioners from the said states, respectively assembled at Annapolis, humbly beg leave to report.  
That, pursuant to their several appointments, they met, at Annapolis in the State of Maryland, on the eleventh day of September Instant, and having proceeded to a Communication of their powers; they found, that the States of New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia had, in substance, and nearly in the same terms, authorised their respective Commissioners “to meet such commissioners as were, or might be, appointed by the other States in the Union, at such time and place, as should be agreed upon by the said Commissioners to take into consideration the trade and Commerce of the United States, to consider how far an uniform system in their commercial intercourse and regulations might be necessary to their common interest and permanent harmony, and to report to the several States, such an Act, relative to this great object, as when unanimously ratified by them would enable the United States in Congress assembled effectually to provide for the same.”  
That the State of Delaware, had given similar powers to their Commissioners, with this difference only that the Act to be framed in virtue of those powers, is required to be reported “to the United States in Congress Assembled, to be agreed to by them, and confirmed by the Legislatures of every State.”  
That the State of New Jersey had enlarged the object of their Appointment, empowering their Commissioners, “to consider how far an uniform system in their commercial regulations and other important matters, might be necessary to the common interest and permanent harmony of the several States,” and to report such an Act on the subject, as when ratified by them “would enable the United States in Congress Assembled, effectually to provide for the exigencies of the Union.”  
That appointments of Commissioners have also been made by the States of New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and North Carolina, none of whom however have attended; but that no information has been received by your Commissioners of any appointments having been made by the States of Connecticut, Maryland, South Carolina, or Georgia.  
That the express terms of the powers to your Commissioners supposing a deputation from all the States, and having for object the Trade and Commerce of the United States, Your Commissioners did not conceive it advisable to proceed on the business of their mission, under the Circumstance of so partial and defective a representation.  
Deeply impressed however with the magnitude and importance of the object confided to them on this occasion, your Commissioners cannot forbear to indulge an expression of their earnest and unanimous wish, that speedy measures may be taken, to effect a general meeting, of the States, in a future Convention, for the same and such other purposes, as the situation of public affairs, may be found to require.  
If in expressing this wish, or in intimating any other sentiment, your Commissioners should seem to exceed the strict bounds of their appointment, they entertain a full confidence, that a conduct, dictated by an anxiety for the welfare, of the United States, will not fail to receive an indulgent construction.  
In this persuasion your Commissioners submit an opinion, that the Idea of extending the powers of their Deputies, to other objects, than those of Commerce, which has been adopted by the State of New Jersey, was an improvement on the original plan, and will deserve to be incorporated into that of a future Convention; they are the more naturally led to this conclusion, as in the course of their reflections on the subject, they have been induced to think, that the power of regulating trade is of such comprehensive extent, and will enter so far into the general System of the foederal government, that to give it efficacy, and to obviate questions and doubts concerning its precise nature and limits, may require a correspondent adjustment of other parts of the Fœderal System.  
That there are important defects in the system of the Fœderal Government is acknowledged by the Acts of all those States, which have concurred in the present Meeting; That the defects, upon a closer examination, may be found greater and more numerous, than even these acts imply, is at least so far probable, from the embarrassments which characterise the present State of our national affairs—foreign and domestic, as may reasonably be supposed to merit a deliberate and candid discussion, in some mode, which will unite the Sentiments and Councils of all the States. In the choice of the mode your Commissioners are of opinion, that a Convention of Deputies from the different States, for the special and sole purpose of entering into this investigation, and digesting a plan for supplying such defects as may be discovered to exist, will be entitled to a preference from consideration, which will occur, without being particularised.  
Your Commissioners decline an enumeration of those national circumstances on which their opinion respecting the propriety of a future Convention with more enlarged powers, is founded; as it would be an useless intrusion of facts and observations, most of which have been frequently the subject of public discussion, and none of which can have escaped the penetration of those to whom they would in this instance be addressed. They are however of a nature so serious, as, in the view of your Commissioners to render the Situation of the United States delicate and critical, calling for an exertion of the united virtue and wisdom of all the members of the Confederacy.  
Under this impression, Your Commissioners, with the most respectful deference, beg leave to suggest their unanimous conviction, that it may essentially tend to advance the interests of the union, if the States, by whom they have been respectively delegated, would themselves concur, and use their endeavours to procure the concurrence of the other States, in the appointment of Commissioners, to meet at Philadelphia on the second Monday in May next, to take into consideration the situation of the United States, to devise such further provisions as shall appear to them necessary to render the constitution of the Fœderal Government adequate to the exigencies of the Union; and to report such an Act for that purpose to the United States in Congress Assembled, as when agreed to, by them, and afterwards confirmed by the Legislatures of every State will effectually provide for the same.  
Though your Commissioners could not with propriety address these observations and sentiments to any but the States they have the honor to Represent, they have nevertheless concluded from motives of respect, to transmit Copies of this report to the United States in Congress assembled, and to the executives of the other States.  
  
By order of the Commissioners  
  
  
Dated at Annapolis

du&amp; diated by an anxiety for the wel-  
fare. of the Dated States, will not fail  
to receive aa indulgent conftru&amp;tion.—  
  
In this perfuahion, your Commiffion-  
ers fubmit an opinion, -_ the Jae of  
extending the powers of their ties  
to ater thinle, the thofe of commerce,  
which has been adopted by the State of  
New- » was an i ement on  
the original plan, and will deferve to be  
incorporated inte that of a future Con-  
vention. They are the more agg ese  
led to this conclufion, as in the courfe  
of their refleétions on the fubjeét, they  
have been induced to think, that the  
power of regulating trade is of fuch  
comprehenfive extent, and will enter fo  
far into the general {yftem of the federal  
government, that to give it efficacy, and  
to obviate queftions and doubts concern-  
ing its precife nature and limits, may  
require a correfpondent adjuftment of  
their parts of the federal {yftem.  
  
That there are important defe&amp;s in  
the fy@ems of the federal government, is  
acknowledged by the a&amp;ts of all thofe  
States which haveconcurred in the prefent  
mecting ; that the defeéts upon a clofer  
examination may be found greater, and  
more numerous, than even thefe a&amp;s  
imply, is at leaft fo far probable, from  
the embarraffments which charaéterife  
the prefent ftateof our national affairs,  
foreign and domeftick, as may reafona-  
bly be fuppofed to merita deliberate and  
candid diicufhon, in fome mode which  
will unite the fentiments and councils  
of all the States. In the choice of the  
mode, your Commiffioners are of ea  
on, that a Convention of deputies trom  
the different States, for the {pecial and  
fole purpofe of eatering into this invef-  
a cy and digefting a plan for fup-  
plying fuch defects as may be difcover-  
ed to exift, will be entitled to a prefer-  
ence, from confiderations which will oc-  
cur without being particularifed.  
  
Your Caneuiione decline an enur  
meration of thofe national cireumftances  
on which their opinion, refpeéting the  
  
  
  
333  
  
propriety of a future Convention, with  
more powers, is founded ; as  
it would be an ufelefe intrufion of facts  
and obfervations, mot of which have  
been frequently the fubjec&amp;t of publick  
pix Sl and none of Seu can a  
efc pemetration ¢ tow  
they would in this inftance be addreffed.  
They are however of a nature % ferious,  
as, in the view of yor: Commiffione  
to render the fituation of the Unit  
States delicate and critical, calling for  
an exertion of the united virtue and  
wifdom of all the members of the confe-  
deracy.  
  
Under this impreffion, your Commif.  
fionert, with the moft refpectful defer-  
ence, beg leave to fuggelt their unani-  
mous conviction, that it may effentially  
tend to advance the intereft of the Uni-  
on, if the States by whom they have  
been refpectively dele ated would them-  
felves concur, and ufe their endeavours  
to procure the concurrence of the other  
States in the appointment of Commiffion-  
ets too meet at Philadelphia on the {e-  
cond Monday in May next, to take into  
confideration the fituation of the United  
States, to devife fuch further provilons  
as thall appear to them neceffary to ren-  
der the conftitution of the federal po-  
vernment adequate to the exigencics of  
the Union ; and to report fuch an a&amp;  
for that ¢ to the United States in  
Congres embled, as when agreed to  
by them, and afterwards confirmed by  
the Legiflature of every ftate, will efce-  
tually provide for the (ame.  
  
Though your Commiflioners could  
not with propriety addrefs thefe obferva-  
tions and fentiments to any but the ftates  
they have the honour to reprefent ; they  
have neverthele(s concluded, from mo-  
tives of refpeft, to tranfmit copics of  
this report to the United States in Con-  
grefs afflembjed, and tothe Executives  
of the other Rates,

on the original plan, and will  
deferve to be incorporated  
into that of a future conven-  
tion. They are the more natu-  
rally led to this conclufion, as,  
in the courfe of their reflec-  
tions on the fubject, they  
have been induced to think,  
that the power of regulating  
trade, is of fuch comprehen-  
  
| five extent, and will enter fo  
  
far into the general fyftem of  
the federal government, that,  
to give it efiicacy, and to  
obviate queftions and doubts  
concerning its precife nature  
and limits, may require a  
correfpondent adjuftment of  
other parts of the federal  
fyftem.  
  
That there are important de-  
fects in the fyftem of the fede-  
ral government, isacknowledg-  
ed by the acts of all thofe ftates  
which have concurred in the  
prefent meeting ; that the de-  
fects uponacloferexamination  
may be found greater, and more  
numerous, than even thefe acts  
imply, is at leaft fo far proba-  
ble, from the embarraffments  
which characterife the prefent  
ftate of our national affairs, fo-  
reign and domeftic, as may rea-  
fonably be fuppofed to merit a  
deliberate and candid difcuf-  
fion, in fome mode which will  
unite the fentiments and coun-  
cils of all the ftates. In the  
choice of the mode, your com-  
miffioners are of opinion, that  
a convention of deputies from  
the different ftates, for the  
  
fpecial and fole purpofe of en-  
tering into this inveftigation,  
and digefting a plan for fup-  
plying fuch defects as may be  
difcovered to exift, will be en-  
titled to a preference, from  
confiderations which will oc-.  
cur without being particula-  
rifed.  
  
Your commiffioners decline  
an enumeration of thofe na-  
tions! circumftances on which  
their opinion, refpecting the  
propriety of a future conventi-  
on, with more enlarged pow-  
ers, is founded; as it would  
  
e an ufelefs intrufion of facts  
and obfervations, moft of  
which have been frequently  
the fubject of public difcuffion,  
and none of which’can have  
efcaped the penetration of  
thofe to whom they would in  
this inftance be addreffed.  
They are however of a nature  
fo ferious, as, in the view of  
your commiflioners, to render  
the fituation of the united  
ftates delicate and critical,  
calling for an exertion of the  
united virtue and wifdom of  
all the members of the confe-  
deracy.  
  
Under this impreffion, your  
commilflioners, with the moft  
re{pectful deference, beg leave  
to fuggeft their unanimous  
conviction, that it may effen-  
tially tend to advance the in-
