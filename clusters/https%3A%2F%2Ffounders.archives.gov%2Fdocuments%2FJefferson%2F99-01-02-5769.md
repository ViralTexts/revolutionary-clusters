Sir  
  
Washington June 17. 07.  
  
In answering your letter of the 9th. which desired a communication of one to me from Genl. Wilkinson  
specified by it’s date, I informed you in mine of the 12th. that I had delivered it, with all other papers respecting the  
charges against Aaron Burr, to the Attorney Genl. when he went to Richmond, that I had supposed he had left them in your  
possession, but would immediately write to him, if he had not, to forward that particular letter without delay. I wrote to  
him accordingly on the same day, but having no answer, I know not whether he has forwarded the letter. I stated in the  
same letter that I had desired the Secretary at War to examine his office in order to comply with your further request to  
furnish copies of the orders which had been given respecting Aaron Burr and his property; and in a subsequent letter of  
the same day, I forwarded to you copies of two letters from the Secretary at War which appeared to be within the  
description expressed in your letter. the order from the Secretary of the Navy you said you were in possession of. the  
reciept of these papers had I presume so far anticipated, and others this day forwarded will have substantially fulfilled,  
the object of a subpoena from the district court of Richmond requiring that those officers &amp; myself should attend the  
court in Richmond, with the letter of Genl. Wilkinson, the answer to that letter, &amp; the orders of the departments of War  
&amp; the Navy therein generally described. no answer to Genl. Wilkinson’s letter, other than a mere acknolegement of it’s  
reciept in a letter written for a different purpose, was ever written by myself or any other. to these communications of  
papers I will add that if the defendant supposes there are any facts within the knolege of the heads of departments, or of  
myself, which can be useful for his defence, from a desire of doing anything our situation will permit in furtherance of  
justice, we shall be ready to give him the benefit of it, by way of deposition, through any persons whom the court shall  
authorise to take our testimony at this place. I know indeed that this cannot be done but by consent of parties &amp; I  
therefore authorise you to give consent on the part of the US. mr Burr’s consent will be given of course if he supposes  
the testimony useful.  
As to our personal attendance at Richmond, I am persuaded the court is sensible that paramount duties to  
the Nation at large controul the obligation of compliance with their Summons in this case, as they would, should we  
recieve a similar one to attend the trials of Blannerhasset &amp; others in the Missisipi territory, those instituted at St.  
Louis and other places on the Western waters, or at any place other than the seat of government. to comply with such calls  
would leave the Nation without an Executive branch, whose agency nevertheless is understood to be so constantly necessary,  
that it is the sole branch which the constitution requires to be always in function. it could not then mean that it should  
be withdrawn from it’s station by any co-ordinate authority.  
With respect to papers, there is certainly a public &amp; a private side to our offices. to the former belong  
grants of land, patents for inventions, certain commissions, proclamations, &amp; other papers patent in their nature. to  
the other belong mere Executive proceedings. all nations have found it necessary that, for the advantageous conduct of  
their affairs, some of these proceedings, at least, should remain known to the Executive functionary only. he of course,  
from the nature of the case, must be the sole judge of which of them the public interests will permit publication. hence  
under our constitution, in requests of papers from the Legislative to the Executive branch, an exception is carefully  
expressed as to those which he may deem the public welfare may require not to be disclosed, as you will see in the  
inclosed resolution of the H. of Representatives which produced the message of Jan. 22. respecting this case. the respect  
mutually due between the constituted authorities in their official intercourse, as well as sincere dispositions to do for  
every one what is just will always ensure from the Executive, in exercising the duty of discrimination confided to him,  
the same candour &amp; integrity to which the nation has in like manner trusted in the disposal of it’s judiciary  
authorities. considering you as the organ for communicating these sentiments to the court, I address them to you for that  
purpose &amp; salute you with esteem &amp; respect.

Washington, June II, ISO&quot;.  
Sir,  
  
In answering your letter of the gth; which de­  
sired a communication of one to me fiom gen. Wil­  
kinson, specified by its date, I informed you in mine  
of the 12th, that I had delivered it, with all other  
papers respecting the charges against Aaron Burr,  
to the attorney general when he went to Richmond,  
Jhat I had supposed he had left them in your pos­  
session, but would immediately write to him,  
if he had not, to forward that particular let­  
ter without delay. I wrote to linn accordingly on  
the same, but having to answer, 1 know not whe­  
ther he has forwarded the letter. 1 stated in the  
letter that I had desired the secretary at war to ex­  
amine his office in order to comply with your fur­  
ther request to furnish copies of the orders which had  
been given respecting Aaron Burr and his property;  
and in a subsequent letter of the same day, 1 forwarded  
to you copies of two letters from the secretary at war  
which appeared to be within the description expres­  
sed in your letter. The orders from the secretary of  
the navy, you said you were in possession uf. The  
receipt of these papers had I presume, so far antici­  
pated, and others this day forwarded, will have sub­  
stantially fulfilled, the object of a subpoena from  
the district court of Richmond, requiring that those  
officers and myself should attend the court in Rich­  
mond, with the letter of gen. Wilkinson, the answer  
to that letter, and the orders of the department of  
war and the navy therein generally described. No  
answer to gen. Wilkinson’s letter, other than &amp; mere  
acknowledgment of its receipt in a letter written  
for a different purpose, was ever written by myself  
or any other. To these communications of papers,  
1 will add, that if the defendant supposes there were  
any facts within the knowledge of the beads of de­  
partments, or of myself, which can be useful for  
his defence, from a desire of doing any thing our  
situation will permit in furtherance of justice, we  
shall be ready to give him the benefit of it, by way  
of deposition through any persons whom the court  
shall authorise to take our testimony at this place.  
1 know indeed that this cannot be done but  
by consent of parties, and I therefore authorise you  
to give consent on the part of the U. States. Mr.  
Burr’s cousent will be given of course, if he sup­  
poses the testimony useful.  
As to our personal attendance at Richmond, 1  
am persuaded the court is sensible that paramount  
  
duties of the nation at large controu! the obligation of  
compliance with their summons in this case, as they  
would, should we receive a similar one to attend  
the trials of Ulfinnerhasset and others in the Mis­  
sissippi territory, those instituted at St. Louis and  
other places on the western waters, or at any place  
other than the seat of government. To comply  
with such calls, would leave the nation without an  
executive branch, whose agency nevertheless is un*  
derstond to he so constantly npcessarv, that it the  
sole branch which the constitution requires to be al­  
ways in function. It could not then that it should  
be withdrawn lrotn its station by any co-ordinate  
authority.  
With respect to papers, there is certainly a pub­  
lic and private side of our offices. To the&quot; former,  
belong grants of lands, patents for inventions, cer­  
tain commissions, proclamations, and other papers  
patent in their nature. To the other belong mere  
executive proceedings. All nations have loimd it  
necessary, that for the advantageous conduct of  
their affairs, some of these proceedings at least,  
should remain known to their executive functionary  
only. He of course, from the nature of the case,  
must he the sole judge of winch of them the public  
interest will permit publication. Hence limit i our  
constitution, in requests of papers from the legis­  
lative to the executive branch, our exception is care­  
fully expressed “ as to those which he may deem  
the public welfare may require not tj be disclosed,”  
as you will see in the inclosed resolution of the II.  
of Keprescntatives, which produced the message of  
Jan. 22, respecting this case. The respect muitul­  
ly due between the constituted authorities intlu ir  
official intercourse, as well as sincere dispositions to  
do for every one what is just, will always ensure  
from the executive, in exercising the duty of dis­  
crimination confided to him, the same candor and  
integrity, to which the nation has in like manner  
trusted in the disposal of its judiciary authorities.  
Considering you as the oigan for communicating  
these sentiments to the court, I addressed them to  
you for that purpose, and salute you with esteem  
and respect.

HWashington, June 17, 07.  
Sir,  
In am wiring your letter of the  
9tb, which ejeaired a communication of  
one to me from gen. Wilkinson, specifi­  
ed by its datt-, I Informed you in mine  
cf the 12th*, that I had delivered it,  
with all other pipsrs respecting the  
charges against Aaron Burr, tn tl  
toiney genew.-.1, wh&#x27;ti he went to Rich*  
mmul, that I had supposed he had l«-ft  
them in you* possession, but would im.  
mediately write to him, if he had   
to forward that particular letter with,  
out delay. I wrote tohiin accordingly  
on the same day, but having no answer,  
1 know not Whether he has forwarded  
the I&lt;iter. I stated in the same letter  
that 1 had desired the secretary at war  
to examine his office in order to com­  
ply with your hit ther request to furnish  
copies of the orelers which &#x27;had been  
£ivt-n respecting Aaron Burr and his  
property ; and in a subsequent letter of  
the same day, I forwarded to you co&gt;  
pies of two letters from the secretary at (  
war Which Appeared to be within the  
description expre*s&lt;-d in your letter.—  
The order from the secretary of the  
navy, you s*.id you were in possession  
of. The receipt of these papers had  
I presume, 30 far anticipated, and others  
this day forwarded, will have substan­  
tially fulfilled, the object ot a tulip  
from the district court of Richmond,  
r quiring that those officers &amp; myself  
should attend the court in Richmond,  
•with the ter.terof g&gt;m. Wilkinson, the  
answer tn that letter, and the orders  
oftbe department of war and the navy  
rhcrrin gfiernlly desenbtd. Nfl an*  
r to gen. Wilkinson&#x27;s letter, other  
than a mere {*&lt;knr&gt;wledgment ol its re­  
ipt in a letter written tor a different  
purpose, was ever written by myself or  
any other. To these communications  
&lt;nf papers, l will add, that if the det&#x27;.n­  
&lt;li-.nt suppose-* there were any facts with­  
h&#x27;- knowledge ol the heads of depart-  
or of mysf lTj which can be use­  
t&#x27; I for his defence, from a desire of  
mg any thing our situation will per­  
mit in furtherance otjustice, we shall be  
&#x27;ogive him th* benefit of it, by  
-way of fleposvtion through any person;.  
r?nom the, teert shall authorise to take  
r testimony at this place.- 1 know in­  
&lt; d that thin cannot he done but by  
nsent of partie*, ami 1 therefore au­  
thorise you to give consent on tlie part  
of the U. S. Mr. Burr&#x27;s consent will  
he given of course, if he supposes the  
testimony useful.  
  
As to our personal attendance at  
Richmond, 1 am persuaded the court is  
sensible that paramount duties to the  
nation at large controul the obligation  
*if compliance with timr summons In  
rhis case-, as they would, should we re­  
ceive a similar on-&gt; to attend the trials  
of Blannerhasset and Others in the Mis­  
sissippi territory,those instituted nt St.  
is, and other places on the western  
waters, or at any place other than ;  
the seat of government. To comply \
with such call i, weald Seav- the nation  
« without an executive branch, whose J  
agency nevertheless is understood to be j  
so constantly necessary, that it is the j  
sole branch which the Constitution r-- j  
-quires to be always in function. It i  
&quot;■-ould not then be contended that it j  
should be withdrawn from Its station |  
any co-ordinate authority. j  
With respe&#x27;t to papers, there is  
cert.i-dya public and private side t»  
•&gt;ur &lt; Aires. To th-* former, belong  
its of lands, patents for inventions, |  
ertain commissions, proclamations,  
ml other papers patent ir. their nature,  
o the other belong mere executive  
•oceeding-i. All nations h ye found  
iitcess.iiy, thai for the advantageous  
induct of tlseir afl urs, some of these  
proceedings at least, should remain  
known to their executive functionary  
only. He of course, from the. nature  
of the case, must be the sole judge of  
which of them the public interest will  
permit publication. Hence under our  
constitution, in requests of papers from ;&#x27;  
the legislative to the executive, branch, j  
«&gt;ne exception is caretutty expressed j  
&quot; as to those which he may d&gt;crn the j  
pu lie welfare may require not to be  
disclosed/* as you will see in the in- j  
closed rer/oluiion of t:ie House of Re­  
presentatives, which produced the |  
message of lan. 22, respecting this j  
case. The respect mutually »,ue be­  
tween th&lt;? consti&#x27;u*ed authorities in {  
their oflfi* id intercourse, as well as J  
sincere dispositions to do tor every one •  
SAhat is just, will alwaya ensure from i  
  
WASHINGTON CITY, PRINTED BY SAMUEL HARRISON SMITH, PENNSYLVANIA AVBNUK.  
  
the executive, in exercising th*? duty  
of discrimination confided to him, the  
same candor and rotejrity, to which  
the nation has in Idee manner trusted  
lin the disposal of its judiciary authori­  
ties. Considering- you as the organ for  
communicating these se*ntiments to the  
l court, i address them to you for that  
purpose, and salute you with esteem  
and respect. I
