			 will rise up against this privileged Solomon, and oblige us to continue acquiescence under the ‘Αμαυρωςις γενεος αςτων’ which Theognis complains of, and to content ourselves with the accidental aristoi produced f by the fortuitous concourse of breeders. for I agree with you that there is a natural aristocracy among men. the grounds of this are virtue &amp; talents. formerly bodily powers gave place  
			 among the aristoi. but since the invention of gunpowder has armed the weak as well as the strong with missile death, bodily strength, like beauty, good humor, politeness and other

			 first  
			 class. the natural aristocracy I consider as the most precious gift of nature, for the instruction, the trusts, and government of society. and indeed it would have been inconsistent in creation to have formed man for the social state, and not to have provided virtue and wisdom enough to manage the concerns of the society. may we not even say that that form of government is the best

			 protection to wealth against the Agrarian and plundering enterprises of the Majority of the people. I think that to give them power  
			 in order to prevent them from doing mischief, is arming them

With respect to Aristocracy we should further consider that, before the establishment of the American states, nothing was known to History but the Man of the old world, crouded within limits either small or overcharged, and steeped in the vices which that situation generates. a government adapted to such men would be one thing; but a very different one that for the Man of these states. here every one may have land to labor for himself if he chuses; or, preferring the exercise of any other industry, may exact for it such compensation as not only to afford a comfortable subsistence, but wherewith to provide for a cessation from labor in old age. every one, by his property, or by his satisfactory situation, is interested in the support of law and order. and such men may safely and advantageously reserve to themselves a wholsome controul over their public affairs, and a degree of freedom, which in the hands of the Canaille of the cities of Europe, would be instantly perverted to the demolition and destruction of every thing public and private.

NATURAL ARISTOCRACY, Extract of a letter from  
John Adams to Thomas Jefferson, dated Oct, 28, 1813—  
  
‘I agree with you-that there is natural aristocracy  
among men. The grounds of this are virtue and ta-  
lents. Formerly, bodily powers gave place among the  
aristot. Butsinee the invention of gunpowder has arm-  
ed the weak as well asthe strong with missile death,  
bodily strength, like ear good humor, politeness, ani  
other accomplishments, has become but an auxiliary  
ground of distinction. There is also an artificial aristoc-  
racy, founded on wealth and birth, without either virtue  
or talents; for with these it would belong to the first  
class. The natural aristocracy I consider as the most pre-  
cious gift of nature, for the instruction, the trusts, and gov-  
ernment of society. And, indeed, it would have been in-  
consistent in creation to have made man for the social state,  
and not to have provided virtue and wisdom enough to  
manage the concerns of the society. May we not even  
say, that that form of government is the best which pro-  
vides most effectually for a pure election of these na-  
tural aristoi into the offices of government? The artifi-  
cial aristocracy is a mischievous ingredient in govern-  
ment, and provision should be made to prevent its ascen-  
dancy.”’

‘ With respect to aristocracy, we should further consider, that before  
the establishment of the American states, nothing was known to history  
but the man of the Old World, crowded within limits either small orover-  
charged, and steeped in the vices which that situation generates. A go-  
vernment adapted to such men would be one thing, but a very different  
one that for the man of these states. Here every one may have land to  
labour for himself if he chooses ; or, preferring the exercise of any other  
industry, may exact for it such compensation as not only to afford a com-  
fortable subsistence, but wherewith to provide for a cessation from labour  
in old age. Every one, by his property or by his satisfactory situation, is  
interested in the support of law and order. And such men may safely  
and advantageously reserve to themselves a wholesome control over their  
public affairs, and a degree of freedom which, in the hands of the canaille  
of the cities of Europe, would be instantly perverted to the demolition  
  
and destruction of every thing public and private. The history of the  
last twenty-five years of France, and of the last forty years in America,—  
nay, of its last two hundred years, proves the truth of both parts of this  
observation.’—( Jefferson&#x27;s Works, vol. iv. 235-6.)

It was one of his boasts that he had  
laid the axe to the root of the last in  
Vir-ginia.  &#x27; With respect to  
aristocracy, we should further consider,  
that before the establishment of the  
Ame-rican States, nothing was known to  
history but the men of the Old World,  
crowded within limits either small or  
overcharged, and steeped in the vices  
which that situation generates. A  
govern-ment adapted to such men would be  
one thing, but a very different one  
that, for the man of these states. Here  
every one may have land toi labour for  
himself if he chooses ; or, preferring  
the exer-cise of any other industry, may  
exact for it such compensation as not  
only to afford a comfortable  
subsistence, but wherewith to provide  
for a cessa-tion from labour in old agc.  
Every one, by his property or by his  
satisfactory situation, is inte-rested  
in the support of law and order. And  
such men may safely and advantageously  
reserve to themselves a wholesome  
controul over their public affairs, and  
a degree of freedom which, in the hands  
of the canaille of &#x27;the cities of  
Europe, would be instantly perverted to  
the demolition and destruc tion of  
everything public and private. The his-  
tory of the last twenty-five years of  
France, and of the last forty years in  
America,-nay, of its last two hundred  
years, proves the truth of both parts of  
this observation.&#x27;-(Jefferson&#x27;s Works,  
vol. iv. 235 6.)-From the Edinburgh  
Review. Foinierly it was the practice of
