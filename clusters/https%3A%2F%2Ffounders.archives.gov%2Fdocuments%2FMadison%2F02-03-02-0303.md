This circumstance that the mouth of the St. Croix, is settled to be, between St. Andrews point on the East and the American shore on the west, three leagues within the Island of Campo bello, draws this consequence to the treaty, that nearly all the Islands, in Passamaquady bay, are within the United States, by the above provision in the Treaty, unless they are taken out

The Island of Campo-bello is confessedly within the exception, and therefore it may be said, that the principle of common privilege, to navigable waters, will not give our nation, a right to a navigation northward of, and between that, &amp; the other Islands in the bay, because that they, being all within the

By the Treaty of peace it is provided, that the Boundaries shall be, “from the Northwest angle of Nova-Scotia, viz. that angle which is formed by a line drawn due North, from the source of the St. Croix, to the highlands, along the highlands which divide those Rivers that empty themselves into the river St. Lawrence, from those which fall into the Atlantic Ocean, to the Northwesternmost head of Connecticut river.”  
You will see by the maps of that part of the country, that the line which runs North from the source of the St. Croix, crosses the river St. John, a great way south of any place, which could be supposed to be the highlands, but where that line will come, to the Northwest angle of Nova Scotia, and find its termination, is not easy to discover.  
The boundary between Nova Scotia &amp; Canada, was described by the Kings proclamation, in the same mode of expression, as that used in the Treaty of Peace. Commissioners who were appointed to settle that line have traversed the country in vain, to find the highlands designated as a boundary. I have seen one of them, who agrees with the account, I have had from the natives, and others, that there are no mountains or highlands, on the Southerly side of the Saint Lawrence, and northeastward of the river Chaudiere. That from the mouth of the St Lawrence to that river, there is a vast extent of high flat country, thousands o

The Bay of Fundy, it is said, is contrasted with the Atlantic

any class of rivers (whatever their distinctions for other pur-

highlands, all those not falling into the river St. Lawrence  
must necessarily be deemed to fall into the Atlantic, of which  
the bays through which they primarily pass are a part, would
