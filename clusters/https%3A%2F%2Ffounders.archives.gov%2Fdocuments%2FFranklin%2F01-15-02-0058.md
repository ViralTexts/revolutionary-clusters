London, April 16, 1768.  
Since my last, a long one of March 13, nothing has been talked or thought of here but elections. There have been amazing contests all over the kingdom, £20 or 30,000 of a side spent in several places,  and inconceivable mischief done by debauching the people and making them idle, besides the immediate actual mischief done by drunken mad mobs to houses, windows, &amp;c. The scenes have been horrible. London was illuminated two nights running at the command of the mob for the success of Wilkes in the Middlesex election; the second night exceeded any thing of the kind ever seen here on the greatest occasions of rejoicing, as even the small cross streets, lanes, courts, and other out-of-the-way places were all in a blaze with lights, and the principal streets all night long, as the mobs went round again after two o’clock, and obliged people who had extinguished their candles to light them again. Those who refused had all their windows destroyed. The damage done and the expence of candles has been computed at £50,000. It must have been great, though probably not so much. The ferment is not yet over, for he has promised to surrender himself to the Court next Wednesday, and another tumult is then expected; and what the upshot will be no one can yet foresee. Tis really an extraordinary event, to see an outlaw and exile, of bad personal character, not worth a farthing, come over from France, set himself up as candidate for the capital of the kingdom, miss his election only by being too late in his application, and immediately carrying it for the principal county. The mob, (spirited up by numbers of different ballads sung or roared in every street) requiring gentlemen and ladies of all ranks as they passed in their carriages to shout for Wilkes and liberty, marking the same words on all their coaches with chalk, and No. 45 on every door; which extends a vast way along the roads into the country. I went last week to Winchester, and observed that for fifteen miles out of town, there was scarce a door or window shutter next the road unmarked; and this continued here and there quite to Winchester, which is 64 miles

London, 16 April, 1768  
DeAr SiR: Since my last, a long one of March  
13, nothing has been talked or thought of here  
but elections. There have been amazing con­  
tests all over the kingdom. Twenty or thirty  
thousand of a side spent in soveral places and  
inconceivable mischief done by debauching  
the paople and making them idle, besides the  
making  
immediate actual mischief done by drunken  
mad mobs to houses, windows, ac. The scenes  
have been horrible. London has been illumi­  
nated two nights running at the command of  
the mob for the success of Wilkes in the Mid­  
dlesex election. The second night exceeded  
anything of the kind ever seen here on the  
greatest occasion of rejoicing, as even the  
small cross streets, lanes, courts, and other  
out-of the-way places were all in a blaze of  
light and the principal streets all night long, as  
the mobs went round again after 2 o&#x27;clock and  
obliged people who had extinguished their  
candles to light them again. Those who re­  
fused had all their windows destroyed. The  
damage done and oxpenses of candles, has  
been computed at $000000. It must have been  
great, though probably not so much  
The ferment is not yet over, for he has prom­  
ised to surrender himself to the Court next  
Wednesday, and another tumult is then ex­  
pected, and what bloodshed will be no one can  
yet foresee. It is really an cxtraordinary event  
to see an outlaw and an exile of bad personal  
character, not worth a farthing, come over  
from France, set himself up as a candidate for  
the capital of the kingdom, miss his election  
only by being too late in his application, and  
immediately carrying it for the principal  
county; the mobs, spirited up by numbers of  
different ballads sung or roared in every  
street, requiring gentlemen and ladies of all  
ranks as they bassed in their carriages to  
shout for Wilkes and liberty; marking the  
same words on all their coaches with chalk  
and number &quot;45&quot; on every door, which ex  
tended a vast way along the streets and into the  
country. I went last week to Winchestor, and
