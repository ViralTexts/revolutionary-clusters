certain letters which passed be-  
tween the British secretary of  
state, Mr. Canning, and Mr. Pink-  
ney, our minister plenipotentiary  
at ‘London. When the documents  
concerning the relations between  
the United States and Great Bri-  
tain were laid before Congress at  
the commencement of the session,  
the answer of Mr. Pinkney tothe  
letter of Mr. Canning had not been  
received, and a communication of  
the latter alone would have accord-  
ed neither with propriety nor with  
the wishes of Mr. Pinkney. When  
that answer afterwards arrived, it  
was considered that as what had  
passed in conversation had been  
superseded by the written and  
formal correspondence on the sub-  
ject, the variance in the statements  
of what had verbally passed was  
not of sufficient importance to be  
made the matter of a distinct and  
special communication. The let-  
ter of Mr. Canning, however,  
having lately appeared in print,  
unaccompanied by that of Mr.  
Pinkney in reply, and having a  
tendency to make impressions not  
warranted by the statements of  
Mr. Pinkney, it has become pro-

I communicate to congress ce*tain let-  
ters which passed between the British se-  
cretary of state, Mr Canaimg. and Mr.  
Pinkney, our minister plenipotentiary at  
London When the documents concerning  
the relations berwe.n the United Stites  
and Great-Britain were laid before con-  
gress. at the commencement of tlie ses-  
sion, the answer of Mr Pinkney, to the  
Jetter of Mr. Cunning, had not been re-  
ceived, and a communication of the latter  
alone would have accorded, neither with  
propriety, nor with the wishes of Mr.  
Pinkney. Woen that answer afterwards  
arrived, it wos considered that as what  
had passed in conversation had been su  
perseded by the written and formal cor-  
respondence on the subject, the variance  
in the statements of what had verbally  
possed was not of sufficient importance to  
b: made the matter of a distinct and spe-  
cial communication. The letter of Mr.  
Canning, however, having lately appear-  
ed in print, unaccompanied by that of  
Mr. Pinkney in reply, and baving a ten  
dency to make impressions nov warrant:  
ed by the statements of Mr. Pinkney, it  
has become proper that the whole should  
be brought into public view.
