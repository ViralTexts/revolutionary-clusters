[19 July 1787]  
Mr. Madison If it be a fundamental principle of free Govt. that the Legislative, Executive &amp; Judiciary powers should be separately exercised, it is equally so that they be independently exercised. There is the same &amp; perhaps greater reason why the Executive shd. be independent of the Legislature, than why the Judiciary should: A coalition of the two former powers would be more immediately &amp; certainly dangerous to public liberty. It is essential then that the appointment of the Executive should either be drawn from some source, or held by some tenure, that will give him a free agency with regard to the Legislature. This could not be if he was to be appointable from time to time by the Legislature. It was not clear that an appointment in the 1st. instance even with an ineligibility afterwards would not establish an improper connection between the two departments. Certain it was that the appointment would be attended with intrigues and contentions that ought not to be unnecessarily admitted. He was disposed for these reasons to refer the appointment to some other source. The people at large was in his opinion the fittest in itself. It would be as likely as any that could be devised to produce an Executive Magistrate of distinguished Character. The people generally could only know &amp; vote for some Citizen whose merits had rendered him an object of general attention &amp; esteem. There was one difficulty however of a serious nature attending an immediate choice by the people. The right of suffrage was much more diffusive in the Northern than the Southern States; and the latter could have no influence in the election on the score of the Negroes. The substitution of electors obviated this difficulty and seemed on the whole to be liable to fewest objections.

th to preserve his independence perfect and  
intact in the very least official act, it strikes me that the  
servility of that declaration was complete; that it im-  
d a total surrender of the dignity of his position; a neg-  
lect of the high duty of his office, and an impeachment of  
the very independence that we are alone bound to respect.  
Not so have other occupants of the presidential chair  
demeaned themselves and the dignity of their place; not  
so mistaken their duty, privilege, and right.  
Said Mr. Madison, in founding the Constitution, and  
long before he reached the highest post created by it:  
If it be a fundamental principle of free government  
&quot;that the legislative, executive, and judiciary powers  
&quot;should he separately exercised, it is equally so that

teem and confidence,&quot; and that &quot;if  
chosen by the national legislature he  
will not be independent of it;&quot; and  
if not independent, &quot;usurpation and  
tyranny will be the consequence.&quot;  
(5 Elliot&#x27;s Debates, 322, 323, 334.)  
Mr. Wilson, Pennsylvania, favored  
the district system, and opposed elec­  
tion by national legislature, on the  
ground that &quot;the executive in that  
case would be too dependent to stand  
the mediator between the intrigues  
and sinister views of the representa­  
tives and the general liberties and in­  
terests of the people.&quot; (Ibid, 323.)  
Mr. Madison, in favoring a choice by  
electors, said:  
If it be a fundamental principle of free govern  
ment that the legislative, executive, and judicia­  
ry powers should be separately exercised, it is  
equally so that they be independently exercised.  
There is the same, and perhaps greater, reason  
why the executive should be independent of the  
legisiature than why the judiciary should. A

liberty.  He was disposed, for these  
reasons, to refer the appointment to some other  
source. The people at lurge was, in his opinion

ite had rendered him an object of general attea

ever, of a serious nature attending an immediate  
choice by the people. The right of suffrage was  
much more diffusive in the Northern than the  
So uthern States, and the latter could have no in­  
fluence in the election, on the score of negroes.

culty, and seemed, on the whole, to be liable to
