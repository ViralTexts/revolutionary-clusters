To the Senate &amp; House of Representatives of the United States.  
  
In compliance with the request of the House of Representatives, expressed in their resolution of the 5th. inst., I proceed to  
give such information, as is possessed, of the effect of Gunboats in the protection &amp; defence of harbours, of the  
numbers thought necessary, &amp; of the proposed distribution of them among the Ports &amp; Harbours of the United States.  
Under present circumstances, &amp; governed by the intentions of the Legislature, as manifested by their Annual  
Appropriations of money for the purposes of defence, it has been concluded to combine,  
1. land batteries, furnished with heavy cannon &amp; mortars, &amp; established on all the points around the place favorable  
for preventing vessels from lying before it: 2. Moveable Artillery, which may be carried, as occasion may require, to  
points unprovided with fixed batteries: 3. floating batteries: &amp; 4. Gunboats, which may oppose an enemy at his  
entrance, &amp; cooperate with the batteries for his expulsion.  
On this subject professional men were consulted, as far as we had opportunity. Genl. Wilkinson, &amp; the late  
Genl. Gates gave their Opinions in writing, in favour of the system, as will be seen by their letters now communicated.  
The higher Officers of the Navy gave the same Opinions, in separate conferences, as their presence at the seat of  
Government offered Occasions of consulting them; and no difference of judgment appeared on the subject. Those of Commodore  
Barron, &amp; Capt. Tingey, now here, are recently furnished in writing; &amp; transmitted herewith to the Legislature.  
The efficacy of Gunboats for the defence of Harbours, and of other smooth &amp; inclosed waters, may be  
estimated in part from that of Gallies, formerly much used, but less powerful, more costly in their construction &amp;  
maintenance, &amp; requiring more men. but the Gunboat itself is believed to be in use with every modern maritime Nation,  
for the purposes of defence. In the Mediterranean, on which are several small powers, whose system, like ours, is peace &amp;  
defence, few Harbours are without this article of protection. Our own experience there, of the effect of Gunboats for  
Harbour service, is recent. Algiers is particularly known to have owed, to a great provision of these Vessels,  
the safety of it’s City, since the epoch of their Construction. before that it had been repeatedly insulted &amp; injured.  
the effect of Gunboats at present in the neighborhood of Gibraltar is well known; &amp; how much they were used, both in  
the attack, &amp; defence of that place, during a former war. the extensive resort to them by the two greatest naval powers in  
the world, on an enterprize of invasion, not long since in prospect, shews their confidence in their efficacy, for the  
purposes for which they are suited. By the Northern powers of Europe, whose Seas are particularly adapted to them, they are still more used. the  
remarkable action between the Russian flotilla of Gunboats &amp; Gallies, and a Turkish fleet of ships of the line &amp;  
frigates, in the Liman Sea, in 1788, will be readily recollected. the latter, commanded by their most celebrated Admiral,  
were compleatly defeated, &amp; several of their Ships of the line destroyed.  
From the opinions given, as to the number of Gunboats necessary for some of the principal sea ports, &amp; from  
a view of all the Towns &amp; Ports, from Orleans to Maine inclusive, entitled to protection in proportion to their situation  
&amp; circumstances, it is concluded that, to give them a due measure of protection in times of war, about 200 Gunboats  
will be requisite. According to first ideas, the following would be their general distribution; liable to be varied, on more  
mature examination, and as circumstances shall vary—that is to say  
To the Missisipi &amp; it’s neighboring waters 40 Gunboats.  
To Savanna &amp; Charleston, &amp; the Harbours on each side, from Saint Mary’s to Curratuck 25.  
To the Chesapeake &amp; it’s waters 20.  
To Delaware bay &amp; river 15.  
To New York, the Sound, &amp; waters as far as Cape Cod 50.  
To Boston &amp; the Harbours north of Cape Cod 50.  
the flotillas assigned to these several stations, might each be under the care of a particular Commandant, &amp;  
the Vessels composing them would, in ordinary, be distributed among the Harbours within the Station, in proportion to  
their importance.  
Of these boats, a proper proportion would be of the larger size, such as those heretofore built, capable of  
navigating any seas, &amp; of reinforcing occasionally the strength of even the most distant Port, when menaced with danger.  
the residue would be confined to their own, or the neighboring Harbours, would be smaller, less furnished for accomodation,  
&amp; consequently less costly. Of the number supposed necessary, 73 are built or building, &amp; the 127 still to be  
provided would cost from five to six hundred thousand Dollars. having regard to the convenience of the treasury, as well  
as to the resources for building, it has been thought that the one half of these might be built in the present year, &amp;  
the other half the next. With the Legislature however it will rest, to stop where we are, or at any further point, when they shall  
be of opinion that the number provided shall be sufficient for the object.  
At times when Europe, as well as the United States, shall be at peace, it would not be proposed that more than six or eight  
of these Vessels should be kept afloat. When Europe is in War, treble that number might be necessary, to be distributed  
among those particular Harbours which foreign Vessels of war are in the habit of frequenting, for the purpose of  
preserving order therein. but they would be manned, in ordinary, with only their complement for navigation, relying on the  
Seamen, &amp; militia of the Port, if called into Action on any sudden emergency. it would be only when the United States should  
themselves be at war, that the whole number would be brought into active service, &amp; would be ready, in the first moments  
of the war, to cooperate with the other means, for covering at once the line of our Seaports. At all times, those unemployed,  
would be withdrawn into places not exposed to sudden enterprize, hauled up under Sheds, covered from the sun and weather,  
&amp; kept in preservation with little expense for repairs or maintenance.  
It must be superfluous to observe, that this species of naval armament is proposed merely for defensive  
operation; that it can have but little effect towards protecting our commerce in the open seas, even on our own coast; &amp;  
still less can it become an excitement to engage in offensive maritime war, towards which it would furnish no means.

To the Senate and House of Representatives of  
  
the United States.  
  
In compliance with the request of the  
House of Representatives, expressed in their  
resolution of the 5th instant, I proceed to  
give such information, as is possessed, of the  
effect of Gun-Boats in the protection and  
defence of harbours, of the numbers thought  
necessary, and of the proposed distribution  
of them, among the ports and harbours of  
the U. States,  
  
Under present circumstances, and govern-  
ed by the intentions of the legisiature, as  
manifested by their annual appropriations of  
money for the purposes of defence, it has  
been concluded to combine, Ist, land batte-  
ries, furnished with heavy cannon and mor-  
tars, and established on all the points around  
the place favourable for preventing vessels  
from lyiug before it ; 2d, moveable artillery,  
which may be carried, as occasion may re  
quire, to points unprovided with fixed batte-  
ries; 3d, floating batteries; and 4th, gun-  
doats, which may oppose ap enemy at the  
  
entrance, and co-vperate with the batteries  
for his expulsion.  
  
On this subject professional men were  
consulted as far as we had opportunity.—  
Genera! Wiikinson, and the late Gen. Gates,  
yave their opinions in writing, in tavour of  
the system, as will be seen by their Jetters  
now communicated. The higher officers of  
the navy gave the same opinions, in sepa-  
rate conferences, as their presence at the seat  
of government offered occasions ef consulting  
the m, and no difference of judgment appear-  
ed on the subject. Those of Com. Barron  
and Capt. Tingey, now here, are recently  
furnished in writing, and transmitted here-  
with to the Legislature.  
  
The efficacy of Gun-Boats for the defence  
of harbours, and of other susooth and enclos-  
ed waters, may be estimated, in part, from  
that of Gallies, formerly much used, but less  
powerful, more cost.y in their construction  
and maintenance, and requiring more men,  
But the Gun-Boat itself is believed to be in  
use with every modern maritime.nation, for  
the purposes of defence. In the Mediterra-  
nean, on which are several small powers,  
whose system, like ours, is peace and defeuce,  
few harbours are without this articie of pro-  
tection, Our own experieuce there of the  
effect of Gun-Boats, for harbour service, is  
recent. Algiers is particularly known to  
have owed to a great provision of these ves-  
sels, the safety of its City, since the epoch  
of their construction. Before that, it had  
been repeatediy insulted and injured. The  
effect of Gun- Boats, at present, in the neigh-  
bourhood of Gibraltar, is wel known, and  
how much they were used, both in attack  
and defence of that place, during a former  
war. The extensive resort to them, by the  
two greatest naval powers in the world, on  
an enteprise of invasion not long since in  
prospect, shows their confidence in their  
efficacy, for the purposes fur which they  
are suited. By the northern powers of Eu-  
rope, whose seas are particularly adapted to  
them, they are still more used. The re-  
markable action, between the Russian flo-  
tila of Gun-Boats and Gallies, and a Turk-  
ish Fieet of Ships of the Line and Frigates,  
in the Liman Sea, (in one thousand seven  
hundred and eighty eight) will be readily  
recoliected. The latter, commanded by  
their most celebeated Admiral, were com-  
pletely defeated, and several of their Ships  
of the Line destroyed.  
  
From the opinions given, as to the number  
of Gun- Boats necessary for some of the prin-  
cipal Sea Ports, and from a view of all the  
towns and ports, from Orleans to Main, in-  
clusive, entitled to protection, in proportion  
to their situation and circumstauces, it is  
concluded that, to give them a due measure  
of protection in times of war, about 200 Gun-  
  
Boats will be requisite. According to first  
ideas, the following would be their general  
  
  
  
distribution ; liable to be varied, on more  
  
  
  
12  
  
  
  
  
  
mature examination, aud as circumstauces  
shal. vary ; tiat 1s to sav,  
  
To the Missisippi and its neighbouring  
waters, 40 Gun-Buats.  
  
To Savannah aud Charleston, and the har-  
  
bours on each side, frou: St. Mary&#x27;s to Cur- |  
  
ratuck, 25.  
  
To the Chesapeake and its waters, 20.  
  
To Delaware bay and river, 15,  
  
To New-York, the Sound, aud waters as  
far as Cape Cod, 50.  
  
To Boston and the harbours north of  
Cape Cod, 50.  
  
The flotitlas assigned to these several sta-  
  
tiuns might each be under the care of parti- |  
  
Cular coummandants, and the ve-sel- conipos-  
ing them would, in ordinary, be distributed  
among the harbours within the station, in  
proportion to their importance.  
  
Ot these buats, a proper proportion would | ;  
we have enjoyed for the last year; more  
  
be of the larger size, such as thuse heretviore  
built, capable of navigating any seas, and of  
reinforcing occasoinally the strength even of  
the most distant parts, when menaced with  
danger. ‘lhe residue would be confided to

To the Senate and Houfe •/ Iicprefentatives of tie Unit­  
ed Stater.  
In compliance with the requeft of the Houfe of  
Representatives, expreffed in their refoiution of the ,  
fifth in ft, 1 proceed to give fuch Information, 33 is  
poffefled, of the effed of gun-boats in the protection i  
and defence of harbors, of the numbers thought ne­  
ccffary, and of the propofed diftribution of them, a­  
mong the ports and harbor* of the U. States.  
Under prefent circumllances, and governed by the  
intentions of the legiflarore, as man.(tiled by their  
annual appropriations of money for the purpofes of  
defence, it has been concluded to combine, I ft, land  
batteries, furniftied with heavy cannon and mortars  
and eftahlilhed on all the points around the place fa­  
vorable for preventing vtlfels from lying before it •  
2d, moveable artillery, which may he carried, as oc­  
caGon may require, to points unprovidtd with fixed  
butteries; id, floating batteries; and ‘ith.guu boat**  
which may oppoft an enemy at bis entrance, and co­  
operate with th* hatteriesfor his expulfion.  
On this luhjeCt profeflional men were confulted as  
far as we had opportunity. Gtn. WiJkinfon, and  
the late Gen. Gates, gave their opinions in writing, j  
in lavor of the fyllem, as will be leen by their fi tters I  
now communicated. The In-her officers of the navy !  
gave the fame opinion, in leparate conferepcts, as&#x27;  
their prefence at the feat of government offered occa- \
fiems of cor.fulting them, and no difference ot ijO-r-i  
nient appeared on thefubjeil. Thofe of commodore  
Barron and capt. Tingey, now heie, are recent]) fur­  
uiftied jn writing, and tratifmitted herewith to the le- &#x27;  
  
gin itur*.  
The efficacy of gun-boats for the defence of har- 1  
bors, and of other (month and inclofed waters, may 1  
be eflimated, in part, from that of gallic-,, formerly I  
much ultd, but left powerful, more cotlly in their&#x27;  
ct»nftru6fion and maintenance, and requiring more  
intn. But the gun-boat itleif is believed to be in ufe •  
with every modern maritime nation, for the purposes  
of defence. In the Mediterranean, on which are fe-i  
veral fmall powers, whofe fyftem, like ours, is peace  
and defence, fe-w harbors are without this article of  
protection. Our own experience there of the effiidt  
of guti-bonts, for harbor lei vice, is recent. Algiers  
is particularly known to have owed, to a great pro­  
viliotiof thete veffels, thelalety of its city, fince the  
epoch of their contl ruction. Before that, it had been  
repeatedly infulted and injured. The effect of gun  
bouts, at prefent, in the neighborhood of Gibraltar,  
is well known, and how much they were tiled, buth  
in the attack and defence of that place, during a lor­  
mer war. The extenfive refort to them, by the t ..o  
greatell naval powers in the world, on an enterprise  
of invafion not long fine? in prnfpatt, (hews their con­  
fidence in their efficiency, for the purpofes for which  
they are fuited. By the northen powers of Europe,  
whofe leas are particularly adapted to them, they are  
(till moi e ufed. The remarkable action, hstweeuth*­  
Ruffnui flotilla of gun-boa&#x27;s and gallics, and a fur­  
killi iieet of fhips of the line and frigates, m tii« Li­  
! man lea, (in one tliaufand fevon hundred and eighty  
e&gt;ght,) will be roacily recollected. &#x27;I he latter, com­  
manded by their mole cslebrated admihd, were com­  
pletely defeated, and feverai of their fi.ips of the line  
deilroyed.  
Erom the opinions given, as to the number ofgun­  
boats netelhiry for fome of the principal fra-ports,  
and fro n a view of all the towns and ports, from  
Orleans to Maine, inchifivc, entitled to pruACln n, u.  
I proportion to tlitir fituation and ctrcumflaiicex, it it  
concluded that, to give them a due mcature of pm.  
j teClion in times of war, about two hoodr-d v;un­  
j boa&#x27;s wii.be requiftte. According to firu ideas, the  
following would be their general diftnhution; h.rbb  
‘ to lie varied, oti more mature examination, and .is  
circumftanct* (hall vary ; that is to fay,  
T.» the Miflsflippi and its neighboring waters, forty  
gun-boats.  
J o Savannah and Charlefton, and the harbors on  
each fide, from oaii.t Mary’s to Currituck, twenty-,  
! five.  
To the Cbefapeake, and its waters, twenty.  
To Delaware bay and river, fifteen.  
To New-York, the Scut d, and waters as far as  
C»y-e Cod, fifty.  
To Bolluii and the harbors north of Cape Cud, fif­  
lr­  
The flotillas sfligneJ to thefe feveral Rations might  
each lie under the care of a particular commandant,  
and the veffels cornpufing them would, in ordinary,!  
he ihffiibuii-d among the barlmrs within the Ration,  
in proportion to their importance.  
Of thefe boats, a proper proportion would he of.  
the larger fize, fuch as thofe heretif &gt;re built, capable  
of navigating any fea, and of reinforcing otcdionally  
the firength even of the mod diftant ports, when  
menac&#x27;d with danger. The refidue would be roufi  
lied to their own, or the neighboring harnors, would I  
he fmaller, lefs furniffied for accommodation, and 1  
confequem ly lefs coftly. Of the number fuppoitd *  
nerefury. feventy three are built or budding ; and the |  
hundred and twenty feven ft ill to be provided, would  
colt from five to fix hundred thoufand dollars, Il3v- •  
mg regard to the convenience of the treafury, as  
well as to the refourcex for buiidT.g, it has been­  
thought that the one half of thefe might be lmilt in  
the prifentyear, and the n&#x27;lur half the first. W’ith  
i!i« lcg.flature, however, it will reft to flop where,  
we ate, or at any further point, when they (hall he of  
opinion that the number provided fhall *c fufficient

of frequenting, for the pur; ofe of preferving order  
thetcui. But they would be niatitivd in ordinary, with  
only their complement for navigation, rely mg on the  
ieunieu and militia of the part, if called into adioo.  
on any fudden emergency. It wool 1 be only when  
the United States fkould themlcIvL&#x27;s bo at ur, that  
the whole number would be brought into active ler­  
vice, and would be ready, in the tiril moments of the  
war, to co-op?ra»**, with other means, for covering  
at once the lice of our b*a ;ons. At ail times, thofc

To the senate and house Q;&quot;g.ﬁa(:rg&quot;czz!atz&#x27;ms of  
o thedinited Sto g  
In compliance with the request of  
the House of Representatives exprefl­  
ed in their resolution of the firft inst.  
I proceed to give {uch information, as  
is poflefled, of the effett of the gun  
boats in the protection and defence of  
harbors, of the numbers thought ne­  
cessary, and of the proposed distribu­  
tion of them, among the ‘ports and  
harbors of the U. States. |  
Under present circumßtarces, and  
governed by the intentions 0&amp; the le­  
gislature, as manifefted by ther annu­  
al appropriations of money for the  
purposes of defence, ic has beey con­  
cluded to combine, Ift, land batk:ies,  
farnifhed wigh heavy cannon and \or­  
tars, and established on all the pdats  
around the place favorable for pre­  
venting vefléls from lying before i\
2d, moveable artillery, which may be  
carried as occasion may require, to  
points unprovided with fixed batte­  
ries ; 3d, floating batteries ; and 4th,  
gun boats, which may oppof= an ere­  
my at his entrance, and co:opergte  
with the batteries for his expalfion.  
On this fubje@ profeflicnal men  
were consulted as far as we had op­  
portunity. General Wilkinson, and  
the late Gen. Gates, gave their opin.  
ions in writing, in favor of the system,  
as will be seen by their letters now  
communicated. The higher officers  
of the navy gave the fame opinions,  
in {eparate coaferhces, as their pref­  
_ence at the feat of ggvernment cffered  
occalions of consulting them, and no  
difference of judgment appeared On  
the fubje@®. Those of’commodore  
Barron and Capt. Tingéey, now here,  
are recently furnifbed in writing, and.  
tran{mitted herewith to the legislature.  
The efficacy of gun boats for the  
defence of harbors and of other  
{mooth and inclofed waters, may be  
ellimated, in part, from that of gal­  
lies, formerly much used, but less pow­  
erful, more coltly in their confkrudion  
and maintenance, and requiring more  
men. Bat the gun boat itfelf is be­  
lieved to be in use with every modern  
&#x27; maritime nation, for the purposes of  
defence. In the Mediterranean, on  
which are several small powers, whose  
{yftem, like ours, is peace and defence,  
few harbors are withoutthis article of  
prote&amp;ion. Our own experience there  
of the effet of gifn boats, for harbor  
service, is rec#it. Algiers is particu­  
larly known to have owéd, to a great  
provision of these veflels, the fafety of  
its city, since the epoch of their con­  
ftru&amp;@ion. Before that, it had been  
repeatedly insulted and injured. The  
effe@ of gun boats, at present, in the  
neighborhood of Gibraltar, is welil  
known,and how much they were used,  
both in the attack and defence of that  
place, during a former war. = The ex­  
tensive resort to them, by the two  
greatest naval powers in thgyorld, on  
an enterprize of invasion not long  
since in profpeé&amp;t, shews f?l:f confi­  
dence in their efficacy, for-the purpos­  
es for which they are suited. l;l3y&#x27;vzh¢  
northern powers of Europe, whose  
seas are particularly adapted to them;  
they are @il more used. Thé remark­  
able adtion, between the Ruffian flo­  
tilla of gun boats and gallies, and a,  
Turkish fleet of fhips-of the line and  
frigates, in the Liman.fea, (in one  
thousand seven hundred and eighty­  
eight) will be readily recolle®ed. The  
latter, commanded by their most cel­  
ebrated admiral, were !!Ompletelxrde­  
feated, and several of their {hips of tbe  
line deftreyed. o SRR  
_~ From the opinions given, as to the  
pamber of gun boats’ necessary for  
fo~.t,!§¢, principal sea ports, and  
from a view of all the towns and ports,  
fromﬁr’i:a%«to Maine, inclusive, en­  
titled to protedtion, in. proportion tor  
their situation and circumstances, it is  
concluded %h%st ve them a due  
“measure of protedtion in times of war,  
‘about two hnndred gun boats will be.  
requisite. According to firlt id  
the following would be their general  
difteibution ; lible to be varied on  
  
more mature examination, and as cir­  
cumstances shall vary ; that is to fay,  
. To the Miflifippi and its neighbor­  
ing waters, forty gun boats.  
To Savannah and Charlelton, and  
the harbors en each fide, from St. Ma­  
ry’s to Curratuck, twenty-five. _  
To the Chesapeake, and its waters,  
twenty. ‘  
To Delaware bay and river, fifteen.  
To New-York, the Sound, and  
waters as far as Cape Cod, fifty.  
- The Hotillas afligned -to these sev­  
eral stations might each be under the  
care of a parricular commandant, and  
tie veflels compoling them would, in  
ordinary, be distributed among the  
harbors within the station, in propor­  
tion to their importance.  
OF these boats, a proper proportion  
would be of the larger size, {uch as  
those heretofore built, capable of nav­  
igating any seas, and of reinforcing  
occalionally the firength even of the  
molt difiant ports, when menaced  
with danger. The residue would be  
confined to their own, or the neigh­  
boriag harbors, would be smaller, tefs  
turpithed for accommodation, and  
consequently less colily. Of themum­  
ber supposed necellary, seventy three  
are built or building, and the hun.  
dregand twenty seven {till to be pro­  
vided, wonild colt from five to f{ix  
hundred thoutaud ‘dollars. Having  
regard to the convenience of the trea-  
Aury, as well as to the resources for  
building, it has been thought that the  
one half of these might be built in the  
present year, and the other nalf the  
next. With the legislature, however,  
it wrll relt to ilop where we are, or at

of opinion that the number provided  
shall be fufficient for the obje&amp;.

would not be proposed that more than

treble that number might be neceflary,  
to be deftributed among thole partic­  
vlar harbors which foreign vefl:is of  
war are in.the habit of trequenting,  
for the purpose of preserving order  
therein. But they would be manged  
in ordinary, with only their comple.  
ment for navigatioh, rélying on the  
{eamen and militia of the port, if call­

To the Senate and House o  
Representatives of the United States.  
  
IN compliance with the request of the house of representatives expressed  
in their resolution of the 5th instant, I proceed to give such information, as  
is possessed, of the effect of the gun boats in the protection and defence of  
harbours, of the numbers thought necessary, and of the proposed distribu-  
tion of them among the ports and harbours of the United States.  
  
Under present circumstances, and governed by the intentions of the legis-  
lature, as manifested by their annual appropriations of money for the purpo-  
ses of defence, it has been concluded to combine, 1st, land batteries, fur-  
nished with heavy cannon and mortars, and established on all the points  
around the place favourable for preventing vessels from lying before it ; 2d,  
moveable artillery, which may be carried, as occasion may require, to points  
unprovided with fixed batteries ; 3d, floating batteries ; and 4th, gun boats,  
which may oppose an enemy at his entrance, and co-operate with the batte-  
ries for his expulsion.  
  
On this subject professional men were consulted as far as we had oppor-  
tunity. General Wilkinson, and the late General Gates, gave their opinions  
in writing, in favour ofthe system, as willbe seen by their letters now com-  
municated. The higher officers of the navy gave the same opinions, in sep-  
arate conferences, as their presence at the seat of government offered occa-  
sions of consulting them, and no difference of opinion appeared on the sub-  
ject.. Those of commodore Barron and captain Tingey, now here, are re-  
cently furnished in writing, and transmitted herewith to the legislature.  
  
The. efficacy of gun boats for the defence of harbours, and of other smooth  
and inclosed waters, may be estimated, in part, from that of gallies, former-  
iy much used, but less powerful, more costly in their construction and main-  
tenance, and requiring more men. But the gun boat itselfis believed to be  
ia use with every 8 5a maritime nation, for the purposes of defence. In  
  
the Mediterranean on which are several small powers, whosé system, like  
qurs, is peace and defence, few harbours aré without, this article of protec-  
tion. Our own experience there of the effect of gun boats, for harbour ser-  
vice, is recent. Algiers is particularly known to have owed, to 2 great pro-  
vision of these vessels, the safety of its city, since the epoch of their con

struction. Before that, it had been repeatedly insulted and injured. The  
effect of , gun boats, at present, in the neighbourhood of Gibraltar, is well  
known, and how, much they were used, both in the attack and defefice of  
that. place, during a former war, The extensive resort to them, by the two  
greatest naval powers in the world, on an enterprize of invasion not long  
since in prospect, shews their confidence in their efficacy, for the purposes  
for which they are suited. . By the northern powers of Europe, whose seas  
are particularly adapted to them, they are still moreused. The remarkable  
action, between the Russian flotilla of gun boats and guliies, and a ‘Turkish  
fleet of ships of the line and frigates, in the Liman sea (in 1788), will be  
readily recollected. The latter,commanded by their most celebrated admiral,  
were completely defeated, and several of their ships of the line destroyed.  
  
From the opinions given, as tothe. number of gun boats necessary for  
some of the principal seaports, and froma view of all the towns and ports  
from New Orleans to Maine inclusive, entitled to protection, in proportion  
to their situation and circumstances, it is concluded that, to give them’ a due  
measure of protection in times of war, about two hundred gun boats will be  
requisite. . According to first ideas, the following would be their general  
distribution ; hable to be varied, on more mature examination, and as cir-  
cumstances shall vary ; that is to say,  
  
To the Mississippi and its neighbouring waters, forty gun boats.  
  
To Savannah and Charleston, and the harbours on each side, from St.  
Mary’s to Curratuck, twenty-five.  
  
To the Chesapeake, and its waters, twenty.  
  
To Delaware bay and river, fifteen.  
  
To New-York, the Sound, and waters as far as Cape Cod, fifty.  
  
The flotillas assigned to these several stations might each be under the  
care of a particular commandant, and the vessels composing them would, in  
ordinary, be distributed among the harbours within the station, in proportion  
to their importance. ;  
  
Of these boats, a proper proportion would be of the larger size, such as  
those heretofore built, capable of navigating any seas, and of reimforcing oc-  
casionally the strength even of the most distant ports, when menaced with  
danger. The residue would be confined to their own, or the neighbouring  
harbours, would be smaller, less furnished for accommodation, and*conse-  
quently less costly. Of the number supposed necessary, seventy-three are  
built or building, and the hundred and twenty-seven ‘still to be provided,  
would cost from 5 to 600,000 dollars. Having regard to the convenience of  
the treasury, as well as to the resources for building, it has been thought  
that the ene half of these might be built in the present year, and the other  
half the next. With the legislature, however, it will rest to stop where we  
are, or at any further point, when they shall be of opinion that the number  
provided shall be sufficient for the object.  
  
At times, when Europe, as well as the United States, shall be at peace, it  
would not be proposed that more than six or’ eight of these vessels should  
be kept afloat. When Europe is in war,treble that number might be neces-  
sary, to be distributed among those particular harbours, which foreign vessels  
of war are in the habit of frequenting, for the purpose of preserving order  
therein. But they would, be manned in ordinary, with only their comple-  
ment for navigation, relying on the seamen and militia of the port, if called  
into action, on any sudden emergency.. It would be only when the United  
States should themselyes be at war,that the whole number would be brought  
into active service, and would be ready, in the first moments of thé war, to  
co-operate, with other means, for covering at once the line of our seaports.  
At all times, those tnemployed would be withdrawn into places not exposed
