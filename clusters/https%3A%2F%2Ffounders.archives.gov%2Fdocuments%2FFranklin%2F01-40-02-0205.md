## Poem on Presenting Franklin with a Walking Stick from the Duchesse de Deux-Ponts, [before 20 July 1783]

#### by Deux-Ponts, Marianne Camasse, comtesse de Forbach

#### From unknown source

#### 1783-07-20

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

This undated poem and Kéralio’s letter of July 20 written on behalf  
of the duchesse de Deux-Ponts (below), concern the gift reproduced on the facing page: a  
walking stick topped with a gold pommel in the shape of a liberty cap. The duchesse sent  
it to replace the walking stick she had given to Franklin in 1779, which he had  
lost. The author of this poem is  
unknown, and no manuscript copy has been found. Because Kéralio probably delivered the gift, he  
also may have written the lines.  
In a codicil to his will, Franklin bequeathed his “fine Crabtree Walking Stick with a  
Gold Head curiously wrought in the Form of the Cap of Liberty” to his “Friend and the  
Friend of Mankind, General Washington.” He added that “If it were a Sceptre he has  
merited it, and would become it. It was a present to me from that excellent Woman Madame  
de Forbach, the Dowager Duchess of Deux Ponts, connected with some Verses which should  
go with it.” If a copy of the verses did

## Editor Ohio Statesman: IN THE SENATE, yesterday, Mr. McDuffie submitted a series of resolutions, recommending, in order to revive our decaying commerce, to replenish the impoverished Exchequer, and to avert the alarming accumulation of the public debt, a modification of the existing tariff on foreign imports, such as will render it strictly in good faith a mere revenue measure, and a rigid system of retrenchment, economy, and accountablity; and that while this is rendered necessary, it is rendered just and not injurious to the public service, by the great reduction of the currency, and the consequent depreciation of the value of money
