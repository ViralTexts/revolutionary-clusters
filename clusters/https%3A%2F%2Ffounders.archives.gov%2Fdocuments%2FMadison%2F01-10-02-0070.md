legates had previously voted to send the Constitution to state conventions for ratification, but Ellsworth now moved that final approval should come from the state legislatures.  
  
Mr. Madison thought it clear that the Legislatures were incompetent to the proposed changes. These changes would make essential inroads on the State Constitutions, and it would be a novel &amp; dangerous doctrine that a Legislature could change the constitution under which it held its existence. There might indeed be some Constitutions within the Union, which had given a power to the Legislature to concur in alterations of the federal Compact. But there were certainly some which had not; and in the case of these, a ratification must of necessity be obtained from the people. He considered the difference between a system founded on the Legislatures only, and one founded on the people, to be the true difference between a league or treaty, and a Constitution. The former in point of moral obligation might be as inviolable as the latter. In point of political operation, there were two important distinctions in favor of the latter. 1. A law violating a treaty ratified by a pre-existing law, might be respected by the Judges as a law, though an unwise or perfidious one. A law violating a constitution established by the people themselves, would be considered by the Judges as null &amp; void. 2. The doctrine laid down by the law of Nations in the case of treaties is that a breach of any one article by any of the parties, frees the other parties from their engagements. In the case of a union of people under one Constitution, the nature of the pact has always been understood to exclude such an interpretation.

before the Senate was, whether there had been a call for a  
convention. The Legilature had passed a law last winter  
requiring the people to vote for or against a convention. He  
said that the law was not binding on the people, bec use the  
Legisiature had no right to pass such a law. To contend  
that they had the right, would be to assume the strange and  
novel doctrine that the Legislature could change the consti­  
tution under which it held its existence. But the truth is,  
that the Constitution is a law to the Legislature, as the law  
is a rule of decision to the judge. Beyond the law the judge  
cannot go; beyond the Constitution the Legislature cannot  
go, so as to bind the people. The Constitution is made by  
the people for the people, and is responsible to the peopl

adopted without opposition. The decision of the Conven.  
tion on this point established a most important distinc­  
tion between the constitution and the articles of confede­  
ration clearly stated in the debates.  
  
MR. MADISON&#x27;S oPiniON.  
The subject of ratification being under consideration,  
Mr. Madison said:  
He considered the difference between a system founded on  
the Legislatures only, and one founded on the people, to be  
the truc difference between a league or treaty and a constitu.­  
tion. The former, in point of moral obligation, might be to  
inviolable as the latter. In point of political operation there  
were two important distinctions in favor of the latter.  
Eirst. A law violating a treaty made by a pre-existing law  
might be respected by the indges as a law, though an unwise  
r perndious one. A law violating a constitution establishe  
y the peopie themselves, would be considered by the judges  
s null and void.  
Sesondly. The doctrine laid down by the law of nations in  
he case of treatles is, that a breach of any one artisle by ary  
of the pariles frees the other parties from their engagement?  
In the case of a union of people under one constitution, the  
nature of the pact has always been understood to eveluda  
such an interpretation. Comparing the two modes in point of  
xpediency, he thought all the considerations recommiending  
this Convention in preference to Congress, for preposing the  
reform, were in fasor of Stale conventions in preference t

Turn to the ‘* Debates on the Constitution,” and note the  
importance attached to a ratification by the people. Mr. Pat-
