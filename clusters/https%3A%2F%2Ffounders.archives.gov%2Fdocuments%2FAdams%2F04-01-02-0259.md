ear a fatal Security has taken possession of them. Whilst the Building is on flame they tremble at the expence of water to quench it, in short two months has elapsed since the evacuation of Boston, and very little has been done in that time to secure it, or the Harbour from future invasion till the people are all in a flame; and no one among us that I have heard of even mentions expence, they think universally that there has been an amaizing neglect some where. Many have turnd out as volunteers to work upon Nodles Island, and many more would go upon Nantaskit if it was once set on foot. “Tis a Maxim of state That power and Liberty are like Heat and moisture; where they are well mixt every thing prospers,  
where they are single, they are destructive.”  
A Goverment of more Stability is much wanted in this colony, and they are ready to receive it from the Hands of the Congress, and since I have begun with Maxims of State I will add an other viz. that a people may let a king fall, yet still remain a people, but if a king let his people slip from him, he is no longer a king. And as this is most certainly our case, why not proclaim to the World in decisive terms your own importance?  
Shall we not be dispiced by foreign powers for hesitateing so long at a word?  
I can not say that I think you very generous to the Ladies, for whilst you are proclaiming peace and good will to Men, Emancipating all Nations, you insist upon retaining an absolute power over Wives. But you must remember that Arbitary power is like most other things which are very hard, very liable to be broken—and notwithstanding all your wise Laws and Maxims we have it in our power not only to free ourselves but to subdue our Masters, and without voilence throw both your natural and legal authority at our feet—  
  
  
“Charm by accepting, by submitting sway  
Yet have our Humour most when we obey.”  
  
I thank you for several Letters which I have received since I wrote Last. They alleviate a tedious absence, and I long earnestly for a Saturday Evening, and experience a similar pleasure to that which I used to find in the return of my Friend upon that day after a weeks absence. The Idea of a year dissolves all my Phylosophy.  
Our Little ones whom you so often recommend to my care and instruction shall not be deficient in virtue or probity if the precepts of a Mother have their desired Effect, but they would be doubly in-forced could they be indulged with the example of a Father constantly before them; I often point them to their Sire  
  
“engaged in a corrupted State  
Wrestling with vice and faction.”

‘‘A government of more stability is much wanted in this  
Colony, and they are ready to receive it at the hands of the  
Congress. And since I have begun with maxims of state, I  
will add another, namely, that a people may let a king fall,  
yet still remain a people; but if a king let his people slip  
from him, he is no longer a king. And as this is most  
certainly our case, why not proclaim to the world in decisive  
terms your own importance. I cannot say that I think you  
are very generous to the ladies ; for whilst you are proclaiming  
peace and good will to men, emancipating all nations, you  
insist upon retaining an absolute power over wives. But you  
must remember, that arbitrary power is like other things which  
are very hard, very liable to be broken ; and notwithstanding  
all your wise laws and maxims, we have it in our power not  
only to free ourselves, but to subdue our masters, and without  
violence, throw both your natural and legal authority at our  
feet.  
  
‘Charm by accepting, by submitting sway,  
Yet have our humor most when we obey.’  
  
* %* * Our little ones, whom you so often recommend to  
my care and instruction, shall not be deficient in virtue or  
probity if the precepts of a mother have their desired effect ;  
but they would be doubly enforced, could they be indulged  
with the example of a father alternately before them. I often  
point them to their sire :  
  
‘Engaged in a corrupted state,  
Wrestling with vice and faction.”’
