ccept their acknowledgments for the comprehensive and interesting detail you have given, in your speech to both Houses of Congress, on the existing state of the Union.  
While we regret the necessity of the present meeting of the Legislature, we wish to express our entire approbation of your conduct in convening it on this momentous occasion.  
The superintendance of our national faith, honour and dignity, being, in a great measure, constitutionally deposited with the Executive, we observe, with singular satisfaction, the vigilance, firmness and promptitude exhibited by you, in this critical state of our public affairs, and from thence derive an evidence and pledge of the rectitude and integrity of your administration. And we are sensible, it is an object of primary importance, that each branch of the government should adopt a language and system of conduct, which shall be cool, just and dispassionate; but firm, explicit and decided.  
We are equally desirous, with you, to preserve peace and friendship with all nations, and are happy to be informed, that neither the honour or interests of the United States forbid advances for securing those desirable objects, by amicable negociation, with the French republic. This method of adjusting national differences, is not only the most mild, but the most rational and humane, and with governments disposed to be just, can seldom fail of success, when fairly, candidly and sincerely used. If we have committed errors, and can be made sensible of them, we agree with you, in opinion, that we ought to correct them, and compensate the injuries, which may have been consequent thereon, and we trust the French republic will be actuated by the same just and benevolent principles of national policy.  
We do therefore most sincerely approve of your determination to promote and accelerate an accommodation of our existing differences with that republic by negociation, on terms compatible with the rights, duties,  interests and honour of our nation. And you may rest assured of our most cordial co-operation so far as it may become necessary in this pursuit.  
Peace and harmony with all nations is our sincere wish; but such being the lot of humanity that nations will not always reciprocate peaceable dispositions: it is our firm belief that, effectual measures of defence, will tend to inspire that national self-respect and confidence at home, which is the unfailing source of respectability abroad, to check aggression and prevent war.  
While we are endeavouring to adjust our differences with the French republic by amicable negociation, the progress of the war in Europe, the depredations on our commerce, the personal injuries to our citizens and the general complexion of affairs, prove to us your vigilant care, in recommending to our attention, effectual measures of defence.  
Those which you recommend, whether they relate to external defence, by permitting our citizens to arm for the purpose of repelling aggressions on their commercial rights, and by providing sea convoys, or to internal defence, by increasing the establishments of artillery and cavalry, by forming a provisional army, by revising the militia laws and fortifying, more completely, our ports and harbours, will meet our consideration under the influence of the same just regard for the security, interest and honour of our country, which dictated your recommendation.  
Practices so unnatural and iniquitous, as those you state, of our own citizens, converting their property and personal exertions into the means of annoying our trade, and injuring their fellow-citizens, deserve legal severity commensurate with their turpitude.  
Although the Senate believe, that the prosperity and happiness of our country does not depend on general and extensive political connexions with European nations, yet we can never lose sight of the propriety as well as necessity of enabling the Executive, by sufficient and liberal supplies, to maintain, and even extend our foreign intercourse, as exigencies may require, reposing full confidence in the Executive, in whom the constitution has placed the powers of negotiation.  
We learn with sincere concern, that attempts are in operation to alienate the affections of our fellow-citizens from their government. Attempts so wicked, wherever they exist, cannot fail to excite our utmost abhorrence. A government chosen by the people for their own safety and happiness, and calculated to secure both, cannot lose their affections, so long as its administration pursues the principles upon which it was erected. And your resolution to observe a conduct just and impartial to all nations, a sacred regard to our national engagements, and not to impair the rights of our government, contains principles which cannot fail to secure to your administration the support of the National  Legislature, to render abortive every attempt to excite dangerous jealousies among us, and to convince the world that our government and your administration of it, cannot be separated from the affectionate support of every good citizen. And the Senate cannot suffer the present occasion to pass, without thus publicly and solemnly expressing their attachment to the constitution and government of their country, and as they hold themselves responsible to their constituents, their consciences and their God, it is their determination by all their exertions to repel every attempt to alienate the affections of the people from the government, so highly injurious to the honour, safety and independence of the United States.  
We are happy, since our sentiments on the subject are in perfect unison with yours, in this public manner to declare, that we believe the conduct of the government has been just and impartial to foreign nations, and that those internal regulations which have been established for the preservation of peace, are in their nature proper, and have been fairly executed.  
And we are equally happy, in possessing an entire confidence in your abilities and exertions in your station, to maintain untarnished, the honour, preserve the peace, and support the independence of our country; to acquire and establish which, in connexion with your fellow-citizens, has been the virtuous effort of a principal part of your life.  
To aid you in the honourable and arduous exertions, as it is our duty, so it shall be our faithful endeavour. And we flatter ourselves, Sir, that the proceedings of the present session of Congress will manifest to the world, that although the United States love peace, they will be independent. That they are sincere in their declarations to be just to the French, and all other nations, and expect the same in return.  
If a sense of justice, a love of moderation and peace, shall influence their councils, which we sincerely hope, we shall have just grounds to expect, peace and amity between the United States and all nations will be preserved.  
But if we are so unfortunate, as to experience injuries from any foreign power, and the ordinary methods by which differences are amicably adjusted between nations shall be rejected, the determination “not to surrender in any manner the rights of the government,” being so inseparably connected with the dignity, interest and independence of our country, shall, by us, be steadily and inviolably supported.

in the Execcutive, in whom the ¢on­

We learn with fincete concern,  
that attempts are in operation to  
alienate the affe@tions of our fellow­  
citizens from their government. At­  
tempts {o wicked, wherever they. ex.  
ift, cannot fail to excite our utmost:  
abhorrence. A govermment chosen  
by the people for their own fafety  
and&#x27; happiness, and calculated to.  
secure both, cannot lose their affecs.  
tions, so long as its administration  
pursues the principles upon which it  
was erefted. - And your resolution  
to observe a condu&amp; just and im­  
partial to all nations, a sacred regard  
to our national engagements, and not  
to impair the rights of our govern­  
ment, contains principles which can­  
not fail to secure to your administra­  
tion the fuppert of the mational Le­  
gislature, to render abortive every  
attempt to excite dangerous jealousies  
among us, and to convince the world  
that our government and your ad­  
ministration of it carinot be separated  
from the affe@ionate fupport.ef every  
good citizen.. And the Senate can­  
not fuffer the present occasion to  
pass, - without - thus publicly and  
solemnly exprefling their attachment  
to the Constitution and Goveérnment  
of their country, and as they hold  
themselves responsible to their Con­  
stituents, their Consciences, and their  
God, it is their determination by all  
their exertions to repel every attempt  
to aleniate the affections of the people  
from the government, so highly inju.  
rious to the honor, fafety and inde­  
pendence of the United States. .  
We are happy since our sentiments  
on the fubje&amp;t are in perfet unison  
with yours, in this public manner to  
declare, that we believe the condu&amp;  
of the government has been just &amp; im­  
partial towards foreign nations, and  
that those internal regulations which  
have been eftablithed for the preser­  
vation of peace, are in their nature  
proper, and have been fairly execu­  
tedaiciine h W  
And we are equally happy, in pof­  
fefling an entire -confidence “in your  
abilities and exertions in your station,  
to maintain: untarnithed the . honor,  
preserve the peace, and support the.

been the virtuous effort of a principal  
part of your life. s  
* To aid you, in the honorable and  
arduous exertions, as it is our duty

and nit to impair the rigjits &lt;^ our

f your  
condu&amp;, in convening it on this moment-  
ous occafion.  
  
The fuperintendance of our national  
faith, honour, and dignity, being in a  
Brcat meafure conftitutionally depofited  
with the executive authority, we obferve,  
with fingular fatisfaétion, the firmnefs and  
promptitude exhibited by you, in this  
éritical ftate of our public affairs ; and  
from thence derive an evidence and pledge  
of the reStitude and integrity of your ad-  
miniftration — And we are fenfible it is an  
objet of primary importance, that each  
branch of the government fhould adopt a  
languege and fyftem of condué, which  
fhall be cool, juft and difpaffionate, but  
firm, explicit and decided.  
  
_ We are equally defrous with you to  
  
preferve peace and friendhhip with all na-  
  
tions, and are happy to be informed, that  
feither the honour nor intereft of the  
  
United States forbid advances for teeuring  
  
thefe defirable ohic&amp;s by an amicable ne-  
  
gociation with the French republic.  
  
This method of adjuting national dif.  
ferences is not only the mott mild, but the  
moit rational and humane; and with a  
government difpofed to be juft, can fel-  
dom fail of fuccefs, when fairly, candidly,  
and ‘fincercly cxerciied. If we have com-  
mitted errors, and can be made fenfi le of  
Vhem, we agree with you in opinion, that  
we ought to corre&amp;t them, and compenfate  
for the injuries whic) may have been con-  
feqnent thereon ; and we truft the French  
republic will be aQuated by the fame jutt  
and benevolent principle of national po-  
licy.  
  
We do therefore moft fincerely approve  
ef your determination to promote aud ac-  
eclerate an accommodation of ous exilting  
differences with that republic by negocia-  
‘tion, on terms compatible with the rights,  
duties, interefts and honour of our na-  
tion; and you may reft ailured of our  
  
2  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
mot cordial co-operation, fo far as it may  
become neceffary in this purfuit.  
  
Peace and harmony with all nations is  
our fincere with ; but fuch being the lot  
of humanity, that nations will not always  
reciprocate peaceful difpofitions, it is our  
firm belief that effeStual meafures of de~  
fence will tend to infpire that national felf«  
defence and confidence at home, which is  
the unfailing fource of refpeStability a-  
broad, to check aggreffion and repel  
war.  
  
While we ate endeavouring to adjuft  
our differences with the French republic  
by amicable negociation, the progrefs of  
the war in Europe, the depredations on  
our commerce, the perfona! snjuries to our  
fellow-citizens and the general complexion  
of affairs, prove to us your vigilant care  
in recommending to us effc€tual meafures  
of detence.  
  
Thofe which you recommend, whether  
they relate to external defence, by permit-  
ting our citizens to arm for the purpole of  
repelling aggretfions on their commercial  
rights, and by providing fea convoys 5  
or, to internal defence, by increafing the  
eftablifhments of artillery and cavalry, by  
forming a provifional army, by revifing  
the militia laws, and fortifying more  
completely ovr ports and harbours; will  
meet our confideration under the fame  
jut regard for the fecurity, honour, and  
intereit of our country, which diétated  
your recommendation.  
  
Praétices fo unnatural and iniquitous as  
thofe you ftate, of our own citizens con-  
verting their property and perfonal exer-  
tions into the means of annoying our  
trade, and injuring their fellow-fubjects,  
deferve legal fevernty commenfurate with  
their turpitude,  
  
Although the fenate believe, that the  
profperity and happinefs of our country  
does not depend on general and extenfive  
political connexions with European na-  
tions, yet we can never lofe fight of the  
propriety as well as neceffity of enabhing  
the executive, by fufficient and liveral fupe  
plies, to maintain and even extend our fo-  
reign intercourfe as exigencies may re-  
quire; repofing full confidence in the  
executive, in whom the conttitution has  
placed the powers of negociation.  
  
We learn, with fincere concern, that  
attempts are in operation to alienate the  
affections of our feilow-citizens from their  
government. Attempts fo wicked, wheres

by the people for their own fafety and  
happinefs, and calculated to fecure both,  
cannot lofe their affections, fo long as its  
adminiftration purfues the principles upon  
which it was ereted. And your refolu-  
tion to obferve a conduét juft and impar-  
tial to all nations, a facred regard to our  
national engagements, and net to impair  
the rights of our government, contains  
principles which cannot fail to fecure to  
your adminiftration the fupport of the na-  
tional legiflature, to render abortive every  
attempt to excite dangerous jealouties a-  
mong us, and to convince the world that  
our government, and your adminiftration  
of it, cannot be feparated from the affec-  
tionate fupport of every good citizen.  
Andthe fenate cannot fuffer the prefent oc-  
eafion to pafs, without thus publicly and fo-  
lemnly expreffing ther atiachment to the  
conttitation and government of their coun-  
try ; and as they hold themfelves refpon-  
fible to their conftituents, their confciences,  
and their God, it is their determination,  
by all their exertions, to repel every at-  
tempt to alienate the affections of the peo-  
ple from the government; fo highly in-  
jurious to the honour, fatety, and inde-  
pendence of the United States.  
  
We are happy, fince our fentiments on  
the fubje&amp;t are in perfect unifon with  
yours, to deciare, that we believe the con-  
duct of the government has been juft and  
impartial to foreign nations, and that thofe  
internal regulations, whieh have been efta-  
blithed for the prefervation of peace, are  
in their nature proper, and have been fairly  
executed.  
  
And we are equally happy in poffeffing  
an entire confidence in your abilities and  
exertions in your ftation, to maintain un-  
tarnifhed the honour, preferve the peace,  
and {upport the independence of our coun-  
try 3 to acquire and eftablifh which, in  
conneétion with your fellow-citizens, has  
been the virtuous effort of a principal  
part of your life.  
  
To aid you in the arduous and ho-  
nourable exertions, as it is our duty, fo  
it fhall be our faithful endeavour. And  
we flatter ourfelves, fir, that the proceed-  
ings of the prefent feflion of congrefs will  
manifeft to the world, that although the  
United States love peace, they will be in-  
dependent, that they are fincere in their  
declarations to be juit to the Faench, and  
  
all other nations, and expe&amp; the fame in  
return. a,  
  
If a fenfe of jultice, a love of modera-  
tion and’ peace, fha!! influence their coun-  
cilse=which we fincerely hope, we fthall  
have juft grounds to expe&amp; that peace and  
amity between the United States, and all  
nations will be prete:ved.  
  
But if we are fo unfortunate, as to ex-  
perience injuries from any foreign power,  
and the ordinary methods by which dif-  
ferences are amicably adjuited between

tion, * Not to furrender in any manner
