ves to divide. The assembly now consists of four distinct parties. 1. The Aristocrats, comprehending the higher members of the clergy, military, and nobility, and the parliaments of the whole kingdom. This forms a head without a body. 2. The moderate royalists, who wish for a constitution nearly similar to that of England. 3. The Republicans, who are willing to let their first magistracy be hereditary, but to make it very subordinate to the legislature, and to have that legislature consist of a single chamber. 4. The faction of Orleans. The 2d. and 3d. descriptions are composed of honest, well meaning men, differing in opinion only, but both wishing the establishment of as great a degree of liberty as can be preserved. They are considered together as constituting the Patriotic part of the assembly, and they are supported by the Souldiery of the army, the souldiery of the church, that is to say the Curés and monks, the disinterested part of the nobility, which is small, and the substantial Bourgeoisie of the whole nation. The part of these collected in the cities, have formed themselves into municipal bodies, have chosen municipal representatives, and have organised and armed corps, considerably more numerous in the whole than the regular army. They have also the ministry, such as it is, and as yet the king. Were these 2d. and 3d. parties, or rather these sections of the same party to separate entirely, this great mass of power and wealth would be split nobody knows how. But I do not think they will separate. Because they have the same honest views; because, each being conscious of the rectitude of the other, there is no rancour between them: because they retain the desire of coalescing. In order to effect this, they, not long ago,  proposed a conference, and desired it might be at my house, which gave me an opportunity of judging of their views. They discussed together their points of difference for six hours, and in the course of discussion agreed on mutual sacrifices. The effect of this agreement has been considerably defeated by the subsequent proceedings of the assembly, but I do not know that it has been thro’ any infidelity of the leaders to the compromise they had agreed on.
