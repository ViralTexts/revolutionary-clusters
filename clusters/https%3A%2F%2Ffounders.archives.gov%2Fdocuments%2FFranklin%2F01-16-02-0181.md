1. The Settlers of Colonies in America did not carry with them the Laws of the Land, as being bound by them wherever they should settle. They left the Realm to avoid the inconveniences and hardships they were under, where some of those Laws were in Force; particularly ecclesiastical Laws, those for payment of Tythes and others. Had it been understood that they were to carry these Laws with them, They had better have staid at home among their friends, unexposed to the risques and toils of a new settlement. They carried with them, a Right to such Parts of the Laws of the Land, as they should judge advantageous or usefull to them: a Right to be Free from those they thought hurtfull: And a Right to make such others, as They should think necessary, not infringing the general Rights of Englishmen. And such new Laws they were to form, as agreeable as might be to the Laws of England.

them the laws of the land as being bound by them wherever  
they should settle. They left the realm to avoid the incon-  
veniences and hardships they were under, where some of  
these laws were in force; particularly ecclesiastical laws,  
those for the payment of tithes, and others. Had it been  
understood that they were to carry these laws with them,  
they had better have stayed home among their friends, unex-  
posed to the risks and toils of a new settlement. They  
carried with them a right to such parts of the laws of the  
land as they should judge advantageous or useful to them;  
a right to be free from those they thought hurtful, and a  
right to make such others as they should think necessary,  
not infringing the general rights of Englishmen; and such  
new laws they were to form as agreeable as might be to the  
laws of England.’’
