Dear Madam,  
Camp at Fort Cumberland 12th Septr 1758.  
  
Yesterday I was honourd with your short, but very agreable favour of the first Instt. how joyfully I catch at the happy occasion of renewing a Corrispondance which I feard was disrelishd on your part, I leave to time, that never failing Expositor of All things.—and to a Monitor equally as faithful in my own Breast, to Testifie. In silence I now express my Joy.—Silence which in some cases—I wish the present—speaks more Intelligably than the sweetest Eloquence.  
If you allow that any honour can be derivd from my opposition  
  
to Our present System of management, you destroy the merit of it entirely in me by attributing my anxiety to the annimating prospect of possessing Mrs Custis. When—I—need not name it.—guess yourself.—Shoud not my own Honour, and Country’s welfare be the excitement? Tis true, I profess myself a Votary to Love—I acknowledge that a Lady is in the Case—and further I confess, that this Lady is known to you.—Yes Madam, as well as she is to one, who is too sensible of her Charms to deny the Power, whose Influence he feels and must ever Submit to. I feel the force of her amiable beauties in the recollection of a thousand tender passages that I coud wish to obliterate, till I am bid to revive them.—but experience alas! sadly reminds me how Impossible this is.—and evinces an Opinion which I have long entertaind, that there is a Destiny, which has the Sovereign controul of our Actions—not to be resisted by the strongest efforts of Human Nature.  
You have drawn me my dear Madam, or rather have I drawn myself, into an honest confession of a Simple Fact—misconstrue not my meaning—’tis obvious—doubt it not, nor expose it,—the World has no business to know the object of my Love, declard in this manner to—you when I want to conceal it—One thing, above all things in this World I wish to know, and only one person of your Acquaintance can solve me that, or guess my meaning.—but adieu to this, till happier times, if I ever shall see them.—the hours at present are melancholy dull.—neither the rugged Toils of War, nor the gentler conflict of A——B—s is in my choice.—I dare believe you are as happy as you say—I wish I was happy also—Mirth, good Humour, ease of Mind and.—what else? cannot fail to render you so; and consummate your Wishes.  
If one agreable Lady coud almost wish herself a fine Gentleman for the sake of another; I apprehend, that many fine Gentlemen will wish themselves finer, e’er Mrs Spotswood is possest.—She has already become a reigning Toast in this Camp; and many there are in it, who intends—(fortune favouring)—to make honourable Scar’s speak the fulness of their Merit, and be a messenger of their Love to Her.  
I cannot easily forgive the unseasonable haste of my last Express, if he deprivd me thereby of a single word you intended to add.—the time of the present messenger is, as the last might  
  
have been, entirely at your disposal.—I cant expect to hear from my Friends more than this once, before the Fate of the Expedition will, some how or other be determind, I therefore beg to know when you set out for Hampton; &amp; when you expect to Return to Belvoir again—and I shoud be glad to hear also of your speedy departure, as I shall thereby hope for your return before I get down; the disappointment of seeing your Family woud give me much concern.—From any thing I can yet see ’tis hardly possible to say when we shall finish—I dont think there is a probability of it till the middle of November. Your Letter to Captn Gist I forwarded by a safe hand the moment it came to me.—his answer shall be carefully transmitted.  
Colo. Mercer to whom I deliverd your message and Compliments, Joins me very heartily in wishing you and the Ladies of Belvoir the perfect enjoyment of every Happiness this World affords.—be assured that I am Dr Madam with the most unfeigned regard, Yr Most Obedient &amp; Most Obligd Hble Servt  
  
Go: Washington  
  
  
N.B. Many Accidents happening (to use a vulgar saying) between the Cup and the Lip, I choose to make the Exchange of Carpets myself—since I find you will ⟨n⟩ot do me the honour to accept of mine.

CANE AT FORT CUNBERLAND, 12th September, 1758.  
Ar MAdAM:  
Yesterday I was honored with your short but very  
grecable lavor of the first iast,--how joyfully I caton  
t the happy occasion of a renewing a correspondence  
thich I feared was disrelished on your part, I leave to  
ime that nover failing expositor of all things,-and to  
monitor equally faithfuf in my own breast to testity.  
n silence I now express my joy. Silence, which, in  
forue casetsat wish the present  mpeais more iuteli  
than the sweetest eloquence.  
If you allow that any honour can be derived from  
ay opposition to our present system of management  
rou destroy the merit of it entirely in mo by attribut-  
ing my anxiety to the animating prospect of possessing  
ra Custlrsswhen-- heed not name it-hess youree  
not my own Honor and country&#x27;s  
veliare be the excitement? Tis true, I  
proreaf mpaelf a votart of LovesI actnowl  
that a lady is in the case- and further I  
contess that this lady is known to you.-Yes, madam,  
as well as she is to one who is too sensible of her  
sharms to deny the Power whose Influence he feels  
and mnust aver submit to. Ifocl the force of her amise  
beauties in the recollection of a thousand tender  
passages that I could wish to obilterate, till I am bid  
o revive them,--but experience, alas! sadly reminds  
me how impossible this is,- and evinces an opinion  
which I have long entertained, that there is a Destiny,  
which has the sovereign control of our actions--not to  
be resisted by the strongest efforts of Human Nature.  
You have drawn me dear madam, or rather I have  
drawn mysell, into an honest coniession of a simple  
Fact- misconstrue not my meaning--doubt it not, nor  
axpone tts The world has no bustners to know the obe  
of my Love-declared in this manner to--you,  
when I want to conceal it. One thing above all things  
in this world I wish to know, and only one person of  
your acquaintance can solve me that or guess my  
meaning--but adicu to this till happier times, if I ever  
shall see them. The hours at present are melancholy  
dull, neither the rugged toils of war, nor the  
gentler conflict of A--B---s is in my choice. I  
dare believe, you are as happy as you say.  
I wish I was happy also. Mirth, good humour, ease of  
mind and--what else? Cannot fail to render you so  
and consummate your wishes.  
If one agrecable lady could almost wish herself a fine  
gentleman for the sake of another; I apprekend, that  
many fine gentiemon will wish themselves finer e&#x27;er  
Mrs. Spotswood is bossest. She has already become a  
reigning toast in this camp; and many there are in it,  
who intend Gfortune tavoring) to make honourable  
scars apeal the fuliness of theif mert and he a mere  
of their Love to Her.  
I cannot casily forgive the unseasonable haste of my  
last express, if he deprived me thereby of a single  
word you intended to add,--the time of the present  
messenger is, as the last might have been, entirely at  
your disposal. I can&#x27;t expect to hear from my friends  
more than this once before the fate of the expedition  
will some how or other be determined. I theretore  
beg to know when you set out for Hampton and when  
you expect to return to Belvoir agam--and I should be  
glad also to hear of your speedy departure as I shall  
thereby hope for your return before I get down;  
the disappointment of seeing your family would  
give me much concern.- From any thing I  
  
can yet see &#x27;tis hardly possible to say when  
we shall finish, I don&#x27;t think there is a probability of  
it till the middle of November. Your letter to Capt&#x27;n  
Gist I forwarded by a sate hand the moment it came to  
me. His answer shall be caretully transmitted.

It is hardly probable that Washington  
ea i as us o  i  
to whom he alludes here, for her husband  
wes then living-in fact, did not die until  
twenty-odd years after the date of this let­  
ter. For the matter of that, Mrs. Fairiax&#x27;s  
husband did not dic until 1787. The fol­  
lowing letter is, without doubt, one of those  
letters which Mrs. Harrison declares will  
&quot;set this question beyond a doubt.&quot; It  
will be found very interesting, as it shows
