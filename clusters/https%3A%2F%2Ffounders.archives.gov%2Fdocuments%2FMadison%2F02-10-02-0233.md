Claiborne. 26 August 1805, “120 Miles from New Orleans.” “The report of the retrocession to Spain of the Country west of the Mississippi had also prevailed in New Orleans: The Evening previous to my departure, being on a visit to the Marquis of Casa Calvo, I asked him if he Knew upon what Authority that report was circulated; he answered in the negative, and added that he had understood the negociation was suspended and that Mr. Monroe had left Madrid; he further said that ‘the Minister of State (Cervalles) had informed him the (Marquis) that the desire of the Court of Spain was, to make the Mississippi river the Boundary, and in time it was expected that, that object would be attained.’ The Marquis delivered himself in the French Language, From my imperfect knowledge of French, it is probable, I may have misunderstood some of his expressions; but I am sure I have given you the substance of what he said.  
“The prospect of a retrocession of the West Bank of the Mississippi, is now, and has always been the Theeme of the Spanish Officers who remain in this Territory; and many Citizens seem to view it as an event likely to happen: An impression which I greatly regret, since it tends to lessen their confidence in the American Government, and to Cherish a Spanish party among us. Next therefore to a final adjustment of Limits with the Spanish Government, I most desire to see every Spanish Officer removed from the ceded Territory. There certainly must be a power some where vested, to Cause to be executed the Clause in the Treaty which directs ‘the Spanish Forces to be withdrawn (within three months) from the Ceded Territory,’ and I should indeed be pleased to have it hinted to me, that in my Character as Commissioner or Governor I could on this Occasion take (if necessary) compulsery measures.”

miles from New-Orleans, August 26th, 1805.—Governor  
Claibourne says, that the report of the retrocession to Spain of  
the country west of the Missisippi had prevailed in New-Or-  
leans, in consequence of which he, Gov. C. inquired of the  
Marquis of Casa Calvo, upon what authority such a report  
was circulated, and was answered, that the Marquis did not  
know, but had been informed, that the negociation between the  
two governments of Spain and the United States, had been  
suspended, and that Mr. Munroe, the American minister,  
had left Madrid ; that he had also, learned from the Spanish  
minister of state Cervatos, that the desire of the Court of  
Spain was,—to make the A/issisippi river the boundary, and,  
in time, it was expected, that that object would be attained.  
  
All this, it seems, was delivered in French, a language  
which Goy. Claiborne says, he understands so imperfectly,  
that he might possibly mistake much of the Marquis’s dis-  
course, but that he is sure, as to the substance of what passed in  
conversation between the Marquis and himself. The Gov-  
ernor proceeds to state, that the prospect of a retrocession of  
the west bank of the Missisippi is now, and always has  
been, the theme of the Spanish officers, who remain in this  
territory, and is looked upon by many of our citizens as an  
event likely to happen ; this impression is much to be regret-  
tecl, because it tends to lessen the confidence of the people in  
this territory, in the American Government, and cherishes a  
Spanish party in New-Orleans. ‘There must be, somewhere,  
a power vested to compel the execution of that clause in the  
treaty, which directs the Spanish forces to be withdrawn,  
within three months, from the ceded territory ; and the Gov-  
crnor ends his letter, by declaring, that he should be, indeed,  
pleased to have it hinted to him, that, in his character, as Com-  
missioner, or Governor, he might, on this occasion, take, if ne-  
cessary, compulsory measures
