1. The Commissioners appointed under the fifth article of the treaty of amity, commerce &amp; navigation between the United States and Great Britain, to ascertain what river was truly intended under the name of the river St. Croix, mentioned in the treaty of peace, met at Passamaquoddy Bay, in October 1796, and viewed the mouths of the rivers in question &amp; the adjacent shores &amp; islands; and being of opinion that actual surveys of both rivers to their sources were necessary, gave to the Agents of the two nations instructions for that purpose; &amp; adjourned, to meet at Boston in August, 1797. They met; but the surveys having been found to require more time than was expected, &amp; not being then completed, the Commissioners again adjourned, to meet at Providence in the state of Rhode-Island, in June 1798; when we may look for a final examination and decision.

n the awards of the Commissioners, it has become necessary for Congress to make adequate provision for the purpose of fulfilling that obligation.  
3. Several decisions on the claims of citizens of the United States for losses and damages sustained by reason of irregular or illegal captures or condemnations of their vessels or other property, have been made by the Commissioners in London, conformably to the seventh article of the treaty. The sums awarded by the Commissioners have been paid by the British Government. And as the same principles of justice and equity will form the basis of future decisions, the final result must prove honorable &amp; satisfactory to both nations. A considerable number of other claims, where costs and damages, &amp; not captured property, were the only objects, have been decided by eminent civilians mutually chosen. Their decisions have been very satisfactory, and the sums they awarded to the citizens of the United States have also been paid.  
This seventh article of the treaty recognizes losses and damages sustained by British subjects by reason of the capture of their vessels &amp; merchandize taken within the limits and jurisdiction of the U. States and brought into the ports of the same, or taken by vessels originally armed in ports of these States. It is necessary that Congress
