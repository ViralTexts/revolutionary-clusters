would be one of the last to imagine, what  
is often idly asserted, that the depression of  
any other country is necessary or serviceable  
to the prosperity of this. The prosperity of  
America is essentially the prosperity of  
Great Britain, and the strength and power  
of Great Britain are not for herself only,  
but for the world.— When those adjustments  
shall take place, to which, though unfor-  
tunately not practicable at this moment,  
nor under theconditions prescribed by Mr.  
Pinckney, the undersigned, nevertheless,  
confidently looks forward, it will perhaps  
be no insecure pledge for the continuance of  
the good understanding between the two  
countries, that they will have learnt duly to  
appreciate each other’s friendship, and that  
it will not hereafter be imputed to Great  
Britain, either, on the one hand, that she  
envies American industry, as prejudicial to  
British commerce, or, on the other hand,  
that she is compelled to court an intercourse  
with America, as absolutely necessary to her  
own existence.—His majesty would not he-  
sitate to contribute, in any manner in his  
power, to restore to the commerce of the  
United States its wonted activity, and if it  
were possible to make any sacrifice for the
