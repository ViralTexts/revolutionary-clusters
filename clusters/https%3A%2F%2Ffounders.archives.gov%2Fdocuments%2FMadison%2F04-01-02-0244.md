It having pleased the Society to name me for their presiding member, I feel it a duty, on my first appearing among you, to repeat my acknowledgements, for that honorary distinction; with the assurances of my sincere desire to promote the success of an establishment, which has in view so valuable an object as that of improving the agriculture of our country.  
The faculty of cultivating the earth, and of rearing animals, by which food is increased beyond the spontaneous supplies of nature, belongs to man alone. No other terrestrial being has received a higher gift, than an instinct, like that of the Beaver or the Ant, which merely hoards, for future use, the food spontaneously furnished by nature.  
As this peculiar faculty gives to man a pre-eminence over irrational animals; so, it is the use made of it by some, and the neglect of it by other communities, that distinguish them from each other, in the most important features of the human character.  
The contrast between the enlightened and refined nations on some parts of the earth, and the rude and wretched tribes on others, has its foundation in this distinction. Civilization is never seen without agriculture: nor has agriculture ever prevailed, where the civilized arts did not make their appearance.  
But, closely as agriculture and civilization are allied, they do not keep pace with each other. There is probably, a much higher state of agriculture in China and Japan, than in many other countries far more advanced in the improvements of civilized life. It is surely no small reproach to the latter, that with so great a superiority in science, and in the fuller possession of the auxiliary arts, they should suffer themselves to be outstripped in the very art by which both are essentially distinguished from the brute creation.  
It must not be inferred, however, from the capacities and the motives of man, for an artificial increase of the productions of the earth, that the transition from the hunter, or even the herdsman state, to the agricultural, is a matter of course. The first steps in this transition, are attended with difficulty; and what is more, with disinclination.  
Without a knowledge of the metals, and the implements made of them, the process of opening and stirring the soil, is not an easy operation; tho’ one perhaps, not requiring more effort and contrivance, than produced the instruments used by Savages in war and in the chase.  
And that there is a disinclination in human nature to exchange the savage for the civilized life, cannot be questioned. We need not look for proofs beyond our own neighbourhood. The Indian Tribes have ever shewn an aversion to the change. Neither the persuasive examples of plenty and comfort derived from the culture of the earth by their white brethren, nor the lessons and specimens of tillage placed in the midst of them, and seconded by actual sufferings from a deficient and precarious subsistence, have diverted them from their strong propensities and habitual pursuits. In the same spirit, they always betray an anxious disposition to return to their pristine life, after being weaned from it by time, and apparently moulded by intellectual and moral instruction, into the habits and tastes of an agricultural people. A still more conclusive evidence of the bias of human nature, is seen in the familiar fact, that our own people, nursed and reared in these habits and tastes, easily slide into those of the savage, and are rarely reclaimed to civilized society with their own consent.  
Had the Europeans, on their arrival, found this continent destitute of human inhabitants, whose dangerous neighbourhood kept them in a compact and agricultural state, and had their communication with the countries they left, been discontinued, they might have spread themselves into the forests where game and fruits would have abounded; and gradually forgetting the arts no longer necessary to their immediate wants, have degenerated into savage tribes.  
An admired historian,  
  
Dr. Robertson.  
  
in his enquiry into the origin of the American Savages, represents any such degeneracy as impossible. He lays it down as a certain principle that the necessary arts of life, when once introduced among a people, can never be lost; that the dominion over inferior animals once enjoyed, will never be abandoned; and that America, consequently, must have been peopled from a country as uncivilized as itself. Yet, he derives the American Savages, generally, from the Tartars, whose example must have taught them the use of certain animals, for which a substitute might have been found in the Bison or Buffalo at least, (the same animal with the Cow,) if not in the Elk, the Moose, or the Caraboo: And he regards the Esquimaux, a tribe distinguished in several respects, for their rude condition, as descendants from the Greenlanders, (of the same modes of life with themselves,) who were a colony from Norway planted in the ninth century; an epoch prior to which the Norwegians had made such progress in the arts, as to be capable of formidable maritime expeditions. The Greenland Colony, therefore, must have undergone a degeneracy from the condition of its parent country. Without supposing the possibility of a transition from a better state of human society, to a savage state, how would the learned historian have accounted for the introduction of the savage state at all?  
  
The bent of human nature may be traced on the chart of our own country. The manufacturer readily exchanges the loom for the plough, in opposition often, to his own interest, as well as to that of his country. The cultivator, in situations presenting an option, prefers to the labours of the field, the more easy employment of rearing a herd. And as the game of the forest is approached, the hunting life displays the force of its attractions. Where do we behold a march in the opposite direction; the hunter becoming the herdsman; the latter a follower of the plough; and the last repairing to the manufactory or the workshop?  
Such indeed is the fascination of that personal independence which belongs to the uncivilized state, and such the disrelish and contempt of the monotonous labour of tillage, compared with the exciting occupations of the chace [sic], or with the indolence enjoyed by those who subsist chiefly on the mere bounties of nature, or on their migratory flocks, that a voluntary relinquishment of these latter modes of life, is little to be expected. We certainly perceive nothing in the character of our savage neighbours, from which it could be inferred that even the germs of agriculture observed in their spots of maize, and a few other cultivated plants, would ever be developed into the extent implied by an agricultural life. To that little resource combined with the game furnished by the forest and by the lake or the stream, their population and habits are adjusted. There may be said, in fact, to be a plenum of the former; because it is commensurate with their food; and this cannot be increased without a change of habits, which being founded in natural propensities, do not change of themselves.  
The first introduction of agriculture among a savage people appears, accordingly, never to have taken place without some extraordinary interposition. Where it has not been obtruded by colonies transplanted from agricultural countries, as from Phœnicia and Egypt into Greece, and from Greece herself, among her savage neighbours, the revolution has proceeded from some individual whose singular endowments, and supernatural pretensions, had given him an ascendancy for the purpose. All these great reformers, in ancient times, were regarded as more than men, and ultimately worshipped as gods. A very remarkable example of modern date, is found in the revolution from the savage to the agricultural state, said to have been brought about by Manco Capac, among the Peruvians, to whom he represented himself as the offspring of the sun.  
Agriculture once effectually commenced, may proceed, of itself, under impulses of its own creation. The mouths fed by it increasing, and the supplies of nature decreasing, necessity becomes a spur to industry; which finds another spur, in the advantages incident to the acquisition of property in the civilized state. And thus a progressive agriculture, and a progressive population ensue.  
  
But, although no determinate limit presents itself to the increase of food, and to a population commensurate with it, other than the limited productiveness of the earth itself, we can scarcely be warranted in supposing that all the productive powers of its surface can be made subservient to the use of man, in exclusion of all the plants and animals not entering into his stock of subsistence; that all the elements and combinations of elements in the earth, the atmosphere and the water, which now support such various and such numerous descriptions of created beings, animate and inanimate, could be withdrawn from that general destination, and appropriated to the exclusive support and increase of the human part of the creation; so that the whole habitable earth should be as full of people, as the spots most crowded now are or might be made, and as destitute as those spots, of the plants and animals not used by man.  
The supposition cannot well be reconciled with that symmetry in the face of nature, which derives new beauty from every insight that can be gained into it. It is forbidden also, by the principles and laws which operate in various departments of her economy, falling within the scope of common observation, as well as within that of philosophic researches.  
The earth contains not less than thirty or forty thousand kinds of plants; not less than six or seven hundred of birds; nor less than three or four hundred of quadrupeds; to say nothing of the thousand species of fishes. Of reptiles and insects, there are more than can be numbered. To all these must be added, the swarms and varieties of animalcules and minute vegetables not visible to the natural eye, but whose existence is probably connected with that of visible animals and plants.  
On comparing this vast profusion and multiplicity of beings with the few grains and grasses, the few herbs and roots, and the few fowls and quadrupeds, which make up the short list adapted to the wants of man; it is difficult to believe that it lies with him, so to re-model the work of nature, as it would be re-modelled, by a destruction, not only of individuals, but of entire species; and not only of a few species, but of every species, with the very few exceptions which he might spare for his own accommodation.  
Such a multiplication of the human race, at the expence of the rest of the organized creation, implies that the food of all plants is composed of elements equally and indiscriminately nourishing all; and which consequently may be wholly appropriated to the one or few plants best fitted for human use.  
Whether the food or constituent matter of vegetables, be furnished from the earth, the air or water; and whether directly, or by either, through the medium of the others, no sufficient ground appears for the inference that the food for all is the same.  
Different plants require different soils; some flourishing in sandy, some in clayey; some in moist, some in dry soils; some in warm, some in cold situations. Many grow only in water—and a few subsist in the atmosphere. The forms, the textures and the qualities of plants are still more diversified. That things so various and dissimilar in their organizations, their constitutions and their characters, should be wholly nourished by, and consist of precisely the same elements, requires more proof than has yet been offered.  
A case which has been relied on to prove that different foods are not necessary for different plants, is that of grafting or inoculating one kind of plant on another kind; the sap obtained by the stock for itself, being found to feed and perfect the graft. But, this operation has its limits. It does not extend beyond plants having a certain affinity. The Apple Tree may be planted on the Pear or the Quince. It will not succeed on the Peach or the Cherry. If the cases prove that the same food suffices for the Apple and the Pear, they equally prove that different foods are required for the Apple and the Peach. It is said even, that the fruit from the Peach Graft on the Almond, is not precisely the same with that from a Peach Graft on a Plum.  
It may be offered as another argument to the same effect, that all animal and vegetable decompositions answer indiscriminately as manures. The fact is not precisely so. Certain manures succeed best with certain plants. It is true, nevertheless, that animal and vegetable substances in a decomposed state, are, generally, manures for plants. Fish even, an animal from the water, is successfully used as a manure for Indian Corn and other crops. But this, and similar examples prove only, that some ingredients are the same in all animals and plants, not that all the ingredients in each are the same.  
The chemist, though as yet a fellow student as much as a preceptor of the agriculturist, justly claims attention to the result of his processes. From that source we learn that the number of known elements, not yet decomposable, is between forty and fifty; that about seven or eight belong to the organs of plants; that different elements enter into the composition of the same plant; and that they are combined in different numbers and in different proportions, in different plants. Supposing then, as must be supposed, that these different elements, in their actual quantities and proportions, are adapted to the quantities and the proportions of the existing varieties of plants; it would happen in so great a change as that in question, with respect to the number and variety of plants, that the quantities and the proportions of the elements, would not be adapted to the particular kinds and numbers of plants retained by man for his own use. Like the types of the Alphabet, apportioned to the words composing a particular book, when applied to another book materially different in its contents, there would be, of some a deficiency, of others, a useless surplus.  
  
Were it less difficult to admit that all the sources of productiveness could be exclusively appropriated to the food of man, is it certain that an obstacle to his indefinite multiplication would not be encountered in one of the relations between the atmosphere and organized beings?  
Animals, including man, and plants may be regarded as the most important part of the terrestrial creation. They are pre-eminent in their attributes; and all nature teems with their varieties and their multitudes, visible and invisible. To all of them, the atmosphere is the breath of life. Deprived of it, they all equally perish. But it answers this purpose by virtue of its appropriate constitution and character. What are these?  
The atmosphere is not a simple but a compound body. In its least compound state, it is understood to contain, besides what is called vital air, others noxious in themselves, yet without a portion of which, the vital air becomes noxious. But the atmosphere in its natural state, and in its ordinary communication with the organized world, comprises various ingredients or modifications of ingredients derived from the use made of it, by the existing variety of animals and plants. The exhalations &amp; perspirations, the effluvia and transpirations of these, are continually charging the atmosphere with a heterogeneous variety and immense quantity of matter, which together must contribute to the character which fits it for its destined purpose, of supporting the life and health of organized beings. Is it unreasonable to suppose, that if, instead of the actual composition and character of the animal and vegetable creation, to which the atmosphere is now accommodated, such a composition and character of that creation, were substituted, as would result from a reduction of the whole to man and a few kinds of animals and plants; is the supposition unreasonable, that the change might essentially affect the aptitude of the atmosphere for the functions required of it; and that so great an innovation might be found, in this respect, not to accord with the order and economy of nature?  
The relation of the animal part and the vegetable part of the creation to each other, through the medium of the atmosphere, comes in aid of the reflection suggested by the general relation between the atmosphere and both. It seems to be now well understood, that the atmosphere when respired by animals becomes unfitted for their further use, and fitted for the absorption of vegetables; and that when evolved by the latter, it is refitted for the respiration of the former: an interchange being thus kept up, by which this breath of life is received by each, in a wholesome state, in return for it in an unwholesome one.  
May it not be concluded from this admirable arrangement and beautiful feature in the economy of nature, that if the whole class of animals were extinguished, the use of the atmosphere by the vegetable class alone, would exhaust it of its life-supporting power; that in like manner, if the whole class of vegetables were extinguished, the use of it by the animal class alone, would deprive it of its fitness for their support? And if such would be the effect of an entire destruction of either class, in relation to the other, the inference seems to press itself upon us, that so vast a change in the proportions of each class to the other, and in the species composing the respective classes, as that in question, might not be compatible with the continued existence and health of the remaining species of the two classes.  
The immensity of the atmosphere, compared with the mass of animals and vegetables, forms an apparent objection only to this view of the subject. The comparison could at most suggest questions as to the period of time necessary to exhaust the atmosphere of its unrenewed capacity to keep alive animal or vegetable nature, when deprived, either, of the support of the other. And this period contracts itself at once to the imagination, when it is recollected that the immensity of the atmosphere is the effect of its elasticity and rarefaction. We know from the barometer, that condensed to the specific gravity of Mercury, its rise above the surface of the earth would be but about thirty inches; and from the well pump, that condensed to the specific gravity only of water, which is nearly the same with that of the human body, its rise would be little more than as many feet; that is, a little more than five times the human stature. It is found that a single human person employs in respiration not less than sixteen or eighteen times his own weight of common air, in every twenty-four hours. In different degrees, some greater, some less, the case is the same with most other animals. Plants make a correspondent use of air for their purposes.  
Other views of the economy of nature coincide with the preceding. There is a known tendency in all organized beings to multiply beyond the degree necessary to keep up their actual numbers. It is a wise provision of nature—1, to guard against the failure of the species: 2, to afford in the surplus, a food for animals whether subsisting on vegetables, or on other animals which subsist on vegetables. Nature has been equally provident in guarding against an excessive multiplication of any one species which might too far encroach on others, by subjecting each, when unduly multiplying itself, to be arrested in its progress by the effect of the multiplication—1, in producing a deficiency of food; and where that may not happen, 2, in producing a state of the atmosphere unfavourable to life and health. All animals, as well as plants, sicken and die in a state too much crowded. It is the case with our domestic animals of every sort, where no scarcity for food can be the cause. To the same laws mankind are equally subject. An increase, not consisting with the general plan of nature, arrests itself. According to the degree in which the number thrown together exceeds the due proportion of space and air, disease and mortality ensue. It was the vitiated air alone which put out human life in the crowded hole of Calcutta. In a space somewhat enlarged, the effect would have been slower, but not less certain. In all confined situations, from the dungeon, to the crowded workhouses, and from these, to the compact population of overgrown cities, the atmosphere becomes in corresponding degrees, unfitted by re-iterated use, for sustaining human life and health. Were the atmosphere breathed in cities and not diluted and displaced by fresh supplies from the surrounding country, the mortality would soon become general. Were the surrounding country thickly peopled and not refreshed in like manner, the decay of health, though a later, would be a necessary consequence. And were the whole habitable earth covered with a dense population, wasteful maladies might be looked for, that would thin the numbers into a healthy proportion.  
Were the earth in every productive spot, and in every spot capable of being made productive, appropriated to the food of man; were the spade substituted for the plough, and all animals consuming the food of man, or food for which human food might be substituted, banished from existence, so as to produce the maximum of population on the earth, there would be more than an hundred individuals, for every one now upon it. In the actual population of many countries, it brings on occasional epidemics to be traced to no other origin than the state of the atmosphere. Increase the numbers to ten or twenty fold, and can it be supposed that they would, at any time, find the breath of life in a condition to support it; or if that supposition be admissible when limited to a single country, can it be admitted, when not only the contiguous countries, but the whole earth was equally crowded?  
Must we then adopt the opinion entertained by some philosophers, that no variation whatever in the numbers and proportions of the organized beings belonging to our globe, is permitted by the system of nature; that the number of species and of individuals in the animal and vegetable empires, since they attained a destined complement, has been, and must always be the same; that the only change possible is in local augmentations and diminutions which balance each other, and thus maintain the established and unalterable order of things?  
This would be the opposite extreme to that which has been rejected. Man, though so similar in his physical constitution to many other animals, is essentially distinguished from all other organized beings, by the intellectual and moral powers with which he is endowed. He possesses a reason and a will by which he can act on matter organized and unorganized. He can, by the exercise of these peculiar powers, increase his subsistence, by which his numbers may be increased beyond the spontaneous supplies of nature; and it would be a reasonable conclusion, that making as he does, in his capacity of an intelligent and voluntary agent, an integral part of the terrestrial system, the other parts of the system are so framed as not to be altogether unsusceptible of his agency, and unpliable to its effects.  
This reasonable conclusion is confirmed by the fact, that the capacity of man, derived from his reason and his will, has effected an increase of particular plants and animals conducive to an increase of his own race; and a diminution of the numbers, if not of the species, of plants and animals displaced by that increase.  
Most, if not all of our domesticated animals probably exceed the numbers which, without the intervention of man, would be their natural amount; whilst the animals preying on, or interfering with them, are proportionally reduced in their numbers.  
The case is the same with cultivated plants. They are increased beyond their natural amount; and banish, or proportionally reduce such as interfere with them.  
Nor can it be said, that these changes made by human art and industry in some regions, are balanced by corresponding changes made by nature, in other regions. Take for examples, the articles of wheat, rice, millet, and maize, which are the chief food of civilized man; and which are now spread over such immense spaces. It is not possible to regard them as occupying no more than their original and fixed proportions of the earth; and that in other parts of it, they have disappeared in the same degree in which they are thus artificially extended. These grains belong to the torrid and temperate zones only; and so great a proportion of these zones have been explored, that it is certain, they could not have been displaced from other parts of the globe, in the degree in which they abound where they are now cultivated, and where it is certain they owe their abundance to cultivation. There must consequently be an absolute increase of them produced by the agency of man.  
Take more particularly for an example, the article of rice, which constitutes so large a portion of human food. The latitudes to which its growth is limited by the nature of the plant, are for the most part so well known, that it may be assumed for an unquestioned fact, that this grain cannot always have prevailed any where, in the extent in which it is now cultivated. And it is equally certain, that the vegetable productions belonging to the same climates, which must have been displaced by its cultivation, have not received an equivalent introduction and extension elsewhere.  
It is remarkable that the vegetable productions most extensively used as human food, are but little, if at all found in their indigenous state; whether that state be the same as their present one, or a state from which they were improveable into their present state. They seem indeed not likely to flourish extensively in situations not prepared by the hand of man. The potato so recently brought into use, and now spreading itself over so great a surface, can barely be traced to a native state in the mountains of Chili, nor can it be believed, that previous to its adoption by man, it ever existed in the extent to which cultivation is now carrying it.  
These views of the subject seem to authorise the conclusion, that although there is a proportion between the animal and vegetable classes of beings on our globe, and between the species in each class, with respect to which, nature does not permit such a change as would result from a destruction of the animals and vegetables not used by man; and a multiplication of the human race, and of the several species of animals and vegetables used by it, sufficient to fill up the void; yet that there is a degree of change which the peculiar faculties of man enable him to make; and by making which, his fund of subsistence and his numbers may be augmented; there being at the same time, whenever his numbers, and the change, exceed the admitted degree, a tendency in that excess to correct itself.  
Could it however be supposed that the established system and symmetry of nature, required the number of human beings on the globe to be always the same; that the only change permitted in relation to them, was in their distribution over it; still, as the blessing of existence to that number would materially depend on the parts of the globe on which they may be thrown; on the degree in which their situation may be convenient or crowded; and on the nature of their political and social institutions; motives would not be wanting to obtain for our portion of the earth, its fullest share, by improving the resources of human subsistence, according to the fair measure of its capacity. For, in what other portion of equal extent will be found climates more friendly to the health or congenial to the feelings of its inhabitants? In what other, a soil yielding more food with not more labour? And above all, where will be found institutions equally securing the blessings of personal independence, and of social enjoyments? The enviable condition of the people of the United States, is often too much ascribed to the physical advantages of their soil and climate, and to their uncrowded situation. Much is certainly due to these causes—but a just estimate of the happiness of our country, will never overlook what belongs to the fertile activity of a free people, and the benign influence of a responsible government.  
In proportion as we relax the hypothesis which makes the aggregate number of mankind unsusceptible of change, and believe that the resources of our country may not only contribute to the greater happiness of a given number, but to the augmentation of the number enjoying a greater happiness, the motives become stronger for the improvement and extension of them.  
But, whilst all are sensible that agriculture is the basis of population and prosperity, it cannot be denied that the study and practice of its true principles have hitherto been too generally neglected in the United States; and that this state has at least its full share of the blame. Now only for the first time, notwithstanding several meritorious examples of earlier date, a general attention seems to be awakened to the necessity of a reform. Patriotic societies, the best agents for effecting it, are pursuing the object with the animation and intelligence which characterize the efforts of a self-governed people, whatever be the objects to which they may be directed.  
Among these promising institutions, I cannot glance at the names of those composing that of Albemarle, without being assured, that its full quota of information will be furnished to the general stock. I regret only, that my own competency bears so little proportion to my wishes to cooperate with them. That I may not be thought, however deficient in good will, as well as in other requisites, I shall venture on the task, a task the least difficult, of pointing out some of the most prevalent errors in our husbandry, and which appear to be among those which may merit the attention of the society, and the instructive examples of its members.  
I. The error first to be noticed is that of cultivating land, either naturally poor or impoverished by cultivation. This error, like many others, is the effect of habit, continued after the reason for it has failed. Whilst there was an abundance of fresh and fertile soil, it was the interest of the cultivator to spread his labour over as great a surface as he could. Land being cheap and labour dear, and the land co-operating powerfully with the labour, it was profitable to draw as much as possible from the land. Labour is now comparatively cheaper and land dearer. Where labour has risen in price fourfold, land has risen tenfold. It might be profitable, therefore, now to contract the surface over which labour is spread, even if the soil retained its freshness and fertility. But this is not the case. Much of the fertile soils is exhausted, and unfertile soils are brought into cultivation; and both co-operating less with labour in producing the crop, it is necessary to consider how far labour can be profitably exerted on them; whether it ought not to be applied towards making them fertile rather than in further impoverishing them; or whether it might not be more profitably applied to mechanical occupations or to domestic manufactures.  
In the old countries of Europe, where labour is cheap and land dear, the object is to augment labour and contract the space on which it is employed. In the new settlements taking place in this country, the original practice here may be rationally pursued. In the old settlements, the reason for the practice in Europe is becoming daily less inapplicable, and we ought to yield to the change of circumstances by forbearing to waste our labour on land, which, besides not paying for it, is still more impoverished and rendered more difficult to be made rich. The crop which is of least amount gives the blow most mortal to the soil. It has not been a very rare thing to see land under the plough not producing enough to feed the ploughman and his horse; and it is in such cases that the death blow is given. The goose is killed without even obtaining the coveted egg.  
There cannot be a more rational principle in the code of agriculture, than that every farm which is in good heart should be kept so; that every one not in good heart should be made so; and that what is right as to the farm generally, is so as to every part of every farm. Any system therefore, or want of system, which tends to make a rich farm poor, or does not tend to make a poor farm rich, cannot be good for the owner, whatever it may be for the tenant or superintendant who has a transient interest only in it. The profit, where there is any, will not balance the loss of intrinsic value sustained by the land.  
II. The evil of pressing too hard on the land, has also been much increased by the bad mode of ploughing it. Shallow ploughing, and ploughing up and down hilly land have, by exposing the loosened soil to be carried off by rains, hastened more than any thing else, the waste of its fertility. When the mere surface is pulverized, moderate rains on land but little uneven, if ploughed up and down, gradually wear it away. And heavy rains on hilly land ploughed in that manner, soon produce a like effect, notwithstanding the improved practice of deeper ploughing. How have the beauty and value of this red ridge of country suffered from this cause? and how much is due to the happy improvement introduced by a member of this Society, whom I need not name,  
  
Col. T. M. Randolph.  
  
by a cultivation in horizontal drills, with a plough adapted to it? Had the practice prevailed from the first settlement of the country, the general fertility would have been more than the double of what the red hills, and indeed all other hilly lands now possess; and the scars and sores now defacing them would no where be seen. Happily, experience is proving that this remedy aided by a more rational management in other respects, is adequate to the purpose of healing what has been wounded, as well as of preserving the health of what has escaped the calamity. It is truly gratifying to observe how fast the improvement is spreading from the parent example. The value of our red hills, under a mode of cultivation which guards their fertility against wasting rains, is probably exceeded by that of no uplands whatever; and without that advantage, they are exceeded in value by almost all others. They are little more than a lease for years.  
Besides the inestimable advantage from horizontal ploughing, in protecting the soil against the wasting effect of rains, there is a greater one, in its preventing the rains themselves from being lost to the crop. The Indian Corn is the crop which most exposes the soil to be carried off by the rains, and it is at the same time the crop which most needs them. Where the land is not only hilly, but the soil thirsty, (as is the case particularly throughout this mountainous range) the preservation of the rain as it falls, between the drilled ridges, is of peculiar importance; and its gradual settling downwards to the roots, is the best possible mode of supplying them with moisture. In the old method of ploughing shallow, with the furrows up and down, the rain, as well as the soil, was lost.  
  
III. The neglect of manures is another error which claims particular notice. It may be traced to the same cause with our excessive cropping. In the early stages of our agriculture, it was more convenient and more profitable to bring new land into cultivation, than to improve exhausted land. The failure of new land, has long called for the improvement of old land; but habit has kept us deaf to the call.  
Nothing is more certain than that continual cropping without manure deprives the soil of its fertility. It is equally certain, that fertility may be preserved or restored, by giving to the earth animal or vegetable manure equivalent to the matter taken from it; and that a perpetual fertility is not, in itself, incompatible, with an uninterrupted succession of crops. The Chinese, it is said, smile at the idea that land needs rest, as if, like animals, it had a sense of fatigue. Their soil does not need rest, because an industrious use is made of every fertilizing particle, that can contribute towards replacing what has been drawn from it. And this is the more practicable with them, as almost the whole of what is grown on their farms is consumed within them. That a restoration to the earth of all that annually grows on it, prevents its impoverishment, is sufficiently seen in our forests; where the annual exuviæ of the trees and plants, replace the fertility of which they deprive the earth. Where frequent fires destroy the leaves and whatever else is annually dropped on the earth, it is well known that the land becomes poorer; this destruction of the natural crop having the same impoverishing effect as the removal of a cultivated crop. A still stronger proof that an annual restoration to the earth of all its annual product will perpetuate its productiveness, is seen where our fields are left uncultivated and unpastured. In this case, the soil, receiving from the decay of the spontaneous weeds and grasses, more fertility than they extract from it, is, for a time at least, improved, not impoverished. Its improvement may be explained, by the fertilizing matter which the weeds and grasses derive from water and the atmosphere, which forms a nett gain to the earth. At what point, or from what cause, the formation and accumulation of vegetable mould from this gain ceases, is not perhaps, very easy to be explained. That it does cease, is proved by the stationary condition of the surface of the earth in old forests; and that the amount of the accumulation varies with the nature of the subjacent earth, is equally certain. It seems to depend also on the species of trees and plants which happen to contribute the materials for the vegetable mould.  
  
But, the most eligible mode of preserving the richness, and of enriching the poverty of a farm is, certainly that of applying to the soil a sufficiency of animal and vegetable matter in a putrified state, or a state ready for putrifaction, in order to procure which, too much care cannot be observed in saving every material furnished by the farm. This resource was among the earliest discoveries of men living by agriculture; and a proper use of it has been made a test of good husbandry in all countries, ancient and modern, where its principles and profits have been studied.  
Some farmers of distinction, headed by Tull, supposed that mere earth, in a pulverized state, was sufficient without manure for the growth of plants; and consequently, that continued pulverization would render the soil perpetually productive; a theory, which never would have occurred to a planter of tobacco or of Indian corn, who finds the soil annually producing less and less, under a constant pulverizing course. The known experiment of Van-Helmont seemed to favour the opposite theory, that the earth parted with nothing towards the plants growing on it. If there were no illusion in the case, the earth used by him must, at least, have been destitute of vegetable mould. For, in an experiment by Woodhouse, a garden mould was diminished in its weight by a plant which grew in it. And the latest chemical examination of the subject co-incide with the general opinion of practical husbandmen that the substance of plants, partakes of the substance of the soil.  
The idea is, indeed, very natural that vegetable matter which springs from the earth, and of itself returns to the earth, should be one source at least of the earth’s capacity to re-produce vegetable matter.  
It has been asked how it happens that Egypt and Sicily, which have for ages been exporting their agricultural produce without a return of any equivalent produce, have not lost their re-productive capacity. One answer has been, that they have lost no small degree of it. If the fact be otherwise with regard to Egypt, it might be accounted for by the fertilizing inundations of the Nile. With regard to Sicily, there may be something in the system of husbandry, or some particular local circumstances, which countervail the continued asportation of the fruits of the soil. But it is far more probable, that the island is less productive than it once was. It is certainly less of a granary for other countries now, than it was when it received that title from the ancient Romans. And its population being diminished, the internal consumption must also be diminished. If a single farm is rendered less productive by a continued removal of its crops, without any adequate returns, no reason occurs why it should not happen to a number of farms multiplied to the extent of a whole country.  
And that individual farms do lose their fertility in proportion as crops are taken from them, and returns of manure neglected, is a fact not likely to be questioned.  
  
If it were, Virginia, unfortunately, is but too capable of furnishing the proofs. Her prevailing crops have been very exhausting, and the use of manures has been particularly neglected.  
Tobacco and Indian Corn, which for a long time on the east side of the Blue Mountains were the articles almost exclusively cultivated, and which continue to be cultivated, the former extensively, the latter universally, are known to be great impoverishers of the soil. Wheat, which has for a number of years, formed a large portion of the general crop, is also an exhausting crop. So are Rye and Oats which enter occasionally into our farming system.  
With so many consumers of the fertility of the earth, and so little attention to the means of repairing their ravages, no one can be surprised at the impoverished face of the country; whilst every one ought to be desirous of aiding in the work of reformation.  
The first and main step towards it, is, to make the thieves restore as much as possible of the stolen fertility. On this, with other improvements which may be made in our husbandry, we must depend for the rescue of our farms from their present degraded condition.  
Of Tobacco, not a great deal more than one half of the entire plant is carried to market. The residue is an item on the list of manures: and it is known to be in its quality a very rich one. The crop of Tobacco, however, though of great value, covers but a small proportion of our cultivated ground; and its offal can of course contribute but inconsiderably to the general stock of manure. It is probable also that what it does contribute, has been more carefully used as a manure, than any other article furnished by our crops.  
The article which constitutes our principal manure is wheat straw. It is of much importance therefore to decide aright on the mode of using it. There are three modes: 1. Carrying it from the farm yard, after having passed through or being trodden and enriched by cattle. In that mode, the greater part of it must be used, if used at all; the straw going through that process, being a necessary part of the food allotted to the cattle. To derive the full advantage from it, it ought to be hauled out before the substance has been wasted by rain, by the sun, and by wind; and to be buried in the earth as soon after as possible. 2. Spreading the straw on the surface of the ground. Many respectable farmers are attached to this mode, as protecting the soil from the sun; and by keeping it moist, favoring the vegetation underneath, whether spontaneous or artificial; whilst the straw itself is gradually decomposed into a manure. The objection to this mode is the loss by evaporation, before this last effect is obtained. 3. Turning the straw at once under the surface of the earth. This would seem to be the best mode of managing manures generally; least of their substance being then lost. When the grain is trodden out from the straw, it is left in a state easily admitting this operation. Some difficulty may attend it, when the grain is threshed from the straw by the flail, or by the machines now in use, neither of which break the straw sufficiently to pieces.  
It may be remarked with regard to this article of manure—1. That its weight is barely more than that of the grain. 2. That the grain is the part which makes the greatest draft on the fertility of the earth. 3. That the grain is for the most part not consumed within the farm. It is found on trial that a stalk of wheat, as generally cut, including the chaff, and the grains borne by the stalk, are pretty nearly of equal weight. The case is probably the same with rye; and not very different with oats. The proportion of fertilizing matter in the straw, to that in the grain, has not, as far as I know, been brought to any satisfactory test. It is doubtless much less in the straw, which alone in the case of wheat, is with us returnable in any form to the earth. This consideration, whilst it urges us to make the most of the article as a manure, warns us of its insufficiency.  
The stubble and the roots of the small grains, not being taken from the earth, may be regarded as relapsing into a fertility equal to that of which they deprived the earth. This remark is applicable to all cultivated plants, the roots of which are not an esculent part.  
An eminent citizen and celebrated agriculturist  
  
Col. John Taylor.  
  
of this state, has among other instructive lessons, called the public attention to the value of the corn stalk as a manure. I am persuaded that he has not overrated it—And it is a subject of agreeable reflection, that an article which is so extensively cultivated as that of Indian corn, and which is so particularly exhausting, should be the one so capable of repairing the injury it does.  
The corn stalk as a fodder is of great value. Not only the leaves, but the husk inclosing the ear, and the cob inclosed by it, are all more or less valuable food when duly preserved and dealt out to cattle. There is no better fodder than the leaves or blades for horses and oxen; nor any so much approved for sheep. The husk or shuck is a highly nourishing food for neat cattle. And the pickings of the stalk, even at a late season, and after much exposure to the weather, support them better than any of the straws. From the saccharine matter in the stalk, which is long retained about the joints, it cannot be doubted that if cut early, or before exposure to the weather, into parts small enough for mastication, it would well repay, as a food for cattle, the labor required for it.  
The great value of the corn stalk, in all its parts as a fodder, was brought into full proof, by the use made of it during the late general failure of crops. It is to be hoped that the lesson will not be suffered to pass into oblivion.  
  
But it is as a resource for re-fertilizing the soil, that the corn stalk finds the proper place here; and as such it merits particular notice; whether it be passed through animals; or be prepared by fermentation in the farm yard; or be merely spread on the surface of the earth, the mode in which its effect must be least considerable. The same qualities which render every part of it nutritious to animals, render it nutritious to the earth, and it is accompanied with the peculiar advantages: 1, that the grain itself is mostly every where, and altogether, in places distant from navigation, consumed within the farms producing it; 2, that as the grain is in greater proportion to the space on which it grows, than most other grains, so the rest of the plant is in greater proportion to the grain, than the rest of any other grain plant. The straw and chaff of the smaller grains, as already remarked, is in weight but about one half the grain. The corn stalk with all its appurtenant offal is of not less than three times, and if taken early from the field, probably of not less than four or five times the weight of the grain belonging to it. 3, the fertilizing matter contained in the corn stalk is greater, in proportion to its weight, than that contained in the straw and offal of other grains is to the weight of the straw and offal.  
Would it be hazarding too much to say, that where a level surface, or the mode of cultivating a hilly one, prevents the rains from carrying off the soil, a restoration of an entire crop of Indian corn, in the form of manure, to the space producing it (there being no other intervening crop not so restored) would replace the fertility consumed by the crop; and maintain a perpetual productiveness? Reason, the case of forest and fallow fields, where the spontaneous crop falls back of itself, to the earth, and the Chinese example, where the cultivated crop is restored to the earth, all pronounce that such would be the effect. And yet the fact stares us in the face, that our most impoverished fields, even the most level of them, owe their condition more to the crops of Indian corn, than to any other crops.  
The articles of fodder which are least neglected as a fund of manure, are timothy and clover hays. But the average quantities on farms, is not as yet, very great; and seldom yield more than stable manure for gardens and culinary crops.  
The cotton plant, which is so extensive a crop, in the more southern, and the South-Western States, is but little cultivated in Virginia, and scarcely at all in this part of it. I am not able to say how far it is comparatively an exhausting crop. But it would seem to be more capable than any crop, not wholly consumed within the farm, of preserving its fertility. The only part of the plant carried away is the cotton fibre or wooly part which bears an inconsiderable proportion to the other parts in weight, and as may be inferred, in fertilizing matter also. The seed alone, passing by the ball and the haulm, is of three times its weight, and contains the chief part of the oil in the plant. In the countries where cotton makes the principal part of the crop, the superfluous seed must deserve great attention as a manure. Where the fields are level or cultivated in horizontal drills, it might go far towards supporting a continued cropping without a diminished fertility.  
The sum of these remarks on cultivating poor land, and neglecting the means of keeping or making land rich, is, that if every thing grown on a soil is carried from it, it must become unproductive; that if every thing grown on it be directly or indirectly restored to it, it would not cease to be productive; and, consequently, that according to the degree in which the one or the other practice takes place, a farm must be impoverished, or be permanently productive and profitable. Every acre made by an improved management to produce as much as two acres, is in effect, the addition of a new acre; with the great advantages, of contracting the space to be cultivated; and of shortening the distance of transportation between the fields, and the barn or the farm yard. One of the Roman writers,  
  
Columella.  
  
on husbandry, enforces the obligation to an improving management by a story of one Paridius who had two daughters and a vineyard: When the elder was married, he gave her a third part of the vineyard; notwithstanding which, he obtained from two thirds, the same crop as from the whole: when his other daughter was married, he portioned her with the half of what remained; and still, the produce of his vineyard was undiminished. The story, short as it is, contains a volume of instruction.  
The plaster or gypsum, though not a manure within the farm itself, has been too long neglected as a fertilizing resource. It is now beginning to take a high and just rank as such. The proofs of its efficacy are as incontestible as the causes of it are obscure. The experiments of a very distinguished chemist,  
  
Sr. H. Davy.  
  
led him to the opinion, that its substance enters into the substance of the plant. Without doubting the fact, it does not sufficiently account for the addition made to the size and weight of the plant, which greatly exceed the quantity of the plaster. It must, therefore, have some further mode of operating. Whether it be by neutralizing some noxious ingredient in the earth, one of the modes by which lime is supposed to operate, or by attracting and conveying to the plant, food from the earth, the air or water; or by exciting the plant to a more active use of its feeding powers, whatever they be; or by its accretion and assimulation to particular parts of plants on which these powers depend; thereby augmenting and strengthening those particular parts, and enabling the feeding powers to give proportional augmentation to every other part; whether by any one or more of these processes, or by some other or others distinct from them all, the growth of plants be promoted by this mineral, remains, it would seem, to be yet explained. In the mean time, a more extensive use of it, promises much advantage to our agriculture. I take it, however, that this advantage cannot be permanent without making the increased product of the soil, a source of manure to the soil. That the effect of the plaster will be continued indefinitely, under a constant removal of the whole crop from the soil, surpasses belief. It can scarcely fail to exhaust at length, the productive powers of the earth. The period of time necessary for the purpose, may be uncertain; but that, as in the case of the other mineral manures, lime and marle, such must sooner or later, be the result, cannot well be so. The effect of pulverising the earth by tillage, as practised by Tull, is stated to have been uninterrupted crops of wheat, without manure for more than twenty years; which was regarded as a demonstration that tillage was a complete substitute for manure. Supposing the statement to be free from error, the inference is certainly not warranted by the fact. We know that some of our soils, not naturally richer than the highly manured soils on which Tull probably commenced his tillage, will bear a succession of crops for an equal period; and we know as well, that their fertility will not hold out forever. How long plaster, whatever be its mode of operation, will hold out, may not yet have been fully tried. But, to make it permanently successful, it will be wise to take for granted, that it must be made a source of future manure, as well as of immediate productiveness. If the crop, as augmented by the plaster, be given back to the soil, the soil may be benefitted more than it would be, by the return of a crop not augmented by the plaster. And in this way, fertility may be accelerated. The restoration of a crop increased by ordinary cultivation, to the soil on which it grew, would, I presume, fertilize it more than the restoration of a smaller crop spontaneously produced; although, in both cases, the whole taken from the soil, would return to it.  
  
IV. Among the means of aiding the productiveness of the soil, which have not received merited attention, is irrigation. In scarcely any country does this resource abound more than in the United States; nor is there any where there is so little sensibility to its value. The inconsiderable use made of it is chiefly by emigrants, particularly Germans, or the immediate descendants of them. I have understood that the market of Baltimore has been much benefitted in dry seasons by the irrigation introduced by exiles from St. Domingo. For a distinguished proof of the importance of the practice, I may refer to the fact which has been stated, that in the neighbourhood of Barcelona in Spain, where a part of the land is under irrigation, and a part is not susceptible of it, both being otherwise of equal fertility, the part irrigated is of double price in the market. It is to be noted indeed that the climate is a dry one, and that the article cultivated is Lucerne. But this is a plant, which though much aided in its growth by moisture, is at the same time remarkable for the length of a tap-root, and fitted by that, as well as by the absorbent quality of its leaves, to flourish in a thirsty soil, and warm climate. Our particular district of country, abounding in springs, small streams, and suitable declivities, admits greatly of irrigation; and being generally of a thirsty nature, the more strongly invites the use of it.  
V. I cannot but consider it as an error in our husbandry, that oxen are too little used in place of horses.  
Every fair comparison of the expence of the two animals, favors a preference of the ox. But, the circumstance particularly recommending him is, that he can be supported when at work by grass and hay; whilst the horse requires grain, and much of it; and the grain generally given him is Indian corn, the crop which requires most labour and greatly exhausts the land.  
From the best estimate I have been enabled to form, more than one half of the corn crop is consumed by horses, including the ungrown ones; and not less than one half, by other than pleasure horses. By getting free from this consumption, one half the labour and of the wear of the land would be saved, or rather more than one half; for on most farms, one half of the crop of corn grows on not more than two-fifths, and sometimes a smaller proportion of the cultivated fields; and the more fertile fields would of course be retained for cultivation. Every one can figure to himself the ease and conveniency of a revolution which would so much reduce the extent of his cornfields; and substitute for the labour bestowed on them, the more easy task of providing pasturage and hay.  
But will not the ox himself when kept at labour require grain food as well as the horse? Certainly much less, if any. Judging from my own observation, I should say, that a plenty of good grass or good hay, will suffice without grain, where the labour is neither constant nor severe. But I feel entire confidence in saying, that a double set of oxen alternately at work, and therefore half the time at rest, might be kept in good plight without other food than a plenty of good grass or good hay. And as this double set would double the supply of beef tallow and leather, a set off is found in that consideration for a double consumption of that kind of food.  
The objections generally made to the ox are—1. That he is less tractable than the horse. 2. That he does not bear heat as well. 3. That he does not answer for the single plough used in our cornfields. 4. That he is slower in his movements. 5. That he is less fit for carrying the produce of the farm to market.  
The first objection is certainly founded in mistake. Of the two animals, the ox is the more docile. In all countries where the ox is the ordinary draught animal, his docility is proverbial. His intractability, where it exists, has arisen from an occasional use of him only, with long and irregular intervals; during which, the habit of discipline being broken, a new one is to be formed.  
The second objection has as little foundation. The constitution of the ox accommodates itself, as readily as that of the horse, to different climates. Not only in ancient Greece and Italy, but throughout Asia, as presented to us in ancient history, the ox and the plough are associated. At this day, in the warm parts of India and China, the ox, not the horse, is in the draught service. In every part of India, the ox always appears, even in the train of her armies. And in the hottest parts of the West-Indies, the ox is employed in hauling the weighty produce to the sea ports. The mistake here, as in the former case, has arisen from the effect of an occasional employment only, with no other than green food. The fermentation of this in the animal heated by the weather, and fretted by the discipline, will readily account for his sinking under his exertions; when green food even, much less dry, with a sober habit of labour would have no such tendency.  
The third objection also, is not a solid one. The ox can, by a proper harness, be used singly as well as the horse, between the rows of Indian corn; and equally so used for other purposes. Experience may be safely appealed to on this point.  
In the fourth place, it is alledged that he is slower in his movements. This is true; but in a less degree than is often taken for granted. Oxen that are well chosen for their form are not worked after the age of about eight years, (the age at which they are best fitted for beef,) are not worked too many together, and are suitably matched, may be kept to nearly as quick a step as the horse. May I not say, a step quicker than that of many of the horses we see at work, who, on account of their age or the leanness occasioned by the costliness of the food they require, lose that advantage where they might have once had it?  
The last objection has most weight. The ox is not as well adapted as the horse to the road service, especially for long trips. In common roads, which are often soft, and sometimes suddenly become so, the form of his foot and the shortness of his leg, are disadvantages; and on roads frozen or turnpiked, the roughness of the surface in the former case, and its hardness in both cases, are inconvenient to his cloven hoof. But where the distance to market is not great, where the varying state of the roads and of the weather, can be consulted; and where the road service is in less proportion to the farm service, the objection is almost deprived of its weight. In cases where it most applies, its weight is diminished by the consideration, that a much greater proportion of service on the farm may be done by oxen, than is now commonly done; and that the expence of shoeing them, is little different from that of keeping horses shod. It is observable that when oxen are worked on the farm, over rough frozen ground, they suffer so much from the want of shoes, however well fed they may be, that it is a proper subject for calculation, whether true economy does not require for them, that accommodation, even on the farm, as well as for the horses.  
A more important calculation is, whether, in many situations, the general saving by substituting the ox for the horse would not balance the expence of hiring a carriage of the produce to market. In the same scale with the hire, is to be put the value of the grass and hay consumed by the oxen; and in the other scale, the value of the corn, amounting to one half of the crop, and of the grass and hay consumed by the horses. Where the market is not distant, the value of the corn saved, would certainly pay for the carriage of the market portion of the crop; and balance, moreover, any difference between the value of the grass and hay consumed by oxen, and the value of the oxen when slaughtered for beef. In all these calculations, it is doubtless proper not to lose sight of the rule, that farmers ought to avoid paying others for doing what they can do for themselves. But the rule has its exceptions; and the error, if it be committed, will not lie in departing from the rule, but in not selecting aright the cases which call for the departure. It may be remarked, that the rule ought to be more or less general, as there may, or may not be at hand, a market by which every produce of labour is convertible into money. In the old countries, this is much more the case, than in new; and in new, much more the case near towns, than at a distance from them. In this, as in most other parts of our country, a change of circumstances is taking place, which renders every thing raised on a farm more convertible into money than formerly; and as the change proceeds, it will be more and more a point for consideration, how far the labour in doing what might be bought, could earn more in another way, than the amount of the purchase. Still it will always be prudent, for reasons which every experienced farmer will understand, to lean to the side of doing, rather than hiring or buying what may be wanted.  
The mule seems to be in point of economy, between the ox and the horse, preferable to the latter, inferior to the former, but so well adapted to particular services, that he may find a proper place on many farms. He is liable to the objection which weighs most against the ox. He is less fitted than the horse for road service.  
VI. A more manifest error in the husbandry of the older settlements is that of keeping too many neat cattle on the farms. As a farm should not be cultivated farther than it can be continued in good heart; the stock of cattle should not be in greater number than the resources of food will keep in good plight. If a poor farm be unprofitable, so are poor cattle. It is particularly the case with the milch cows. When the whole of the food given them is necessary to support a lean existence, no part can be spared for the milk pail. The same food, given to the proper number, will not only keep them in a thrifty state, but enable them to supply the dairy. Even the manure from several poor cattle is worth less than that from a single fat one. The remark holds equally good with respect to the hide.  
The misjudged practice in question, is another effect of inattention to the change of circumstances through which our country has passed. Originally the forest abounded in rich herbage which fed and fatted, without expence, all the cattle that could be brought through the winter into the spring. It was natural, at that time to keep as large a stock as could be preserved through the winter. For a long time past, the forest is scarcely any where, a resource for more than two or three months; and in many places, no resource at all. A greater difficulty is often felt in finding summer, than winter subsistence. And yet, where no inclosed pasturage is provided to take the place of the extinct one in the forest, the habit, founded in reasons which have entirely ceased, is but too generally retained. The same number of cattle is aimed at, as if the forest was as ready to receive and fatten them now, as formerly. The size and appearance of our neat cattle, compared with those for which nature or good husbandry has provided sufficient food, are proofs that their food is not in proportion to their number; and that, where the food cannot be increased, the number ought to be reduced.  
VII. Of all the errors in our rural economy, none is perhaps, so much to be regretted, because none so difficult to be repaired, as the injudicious and excessive destruction of timber and fire wood. It seems never to have occurred that the fund was not inexhaustible, and that a crop of trees could not be raised as quickly as one of wheat or corn.  
Here again, we are presented with a proof of the continuance of the practice for which the reasons have ceased. When our ancestors arrived, they found the trees of the forest the great obstacle to their settlement, and cultivation. The great effort was of course to destroy the trees. It would seem that they contracted and transmitted an antipathy to them; for the trees were not even spared around the dwellings, where their shade would have been a comfort and their beauty an ornament; and it is of late years only, that these advantages have been attended to. In fact, such has been the inconsiderate and indiscriminate use of the axe, that this country is beginning to feel the calamity as much as some of the old countries of Europe; and it will soon be forced to understand the difficulty of curing it. A vast proportion of the farms on the eastern side of the Blue Ridge, and some even, on the other side, have but a scanty fund for present use, and are without a fund for permanent use. And to increase the evil, the remnant of timber and fuel on many farms, inadequate as it is, is left in situations remote from the dwelling, and incapable of being divided, according to the divisions and sub-divisions, into which all the larger farms must be rapidly forced by the law of descents, the impulses of parental affection, and other causes.  
It is high time for many farmers, even in this quarter, and still more so in the country below us, to take this subject into serious consideration. Prudence will no longer delay to economize what remains of wood land; to foster the second growths where taking place in convenient spots; and to commence, when necessary, plantations of the trees recommended by their utility and quickness of growth.  
I wish I could more satisfactorily estimate the proportion of wood land which ought to belong to every farm, as a permanent fund of timber for building and repairing houses; for fences, where live or stone ones may not have been introduced; for wheel carriages, and the other apparatus needed on farms. The estimate is the more difficult, because it must be varied according to many circumstances: particularly, according to the nature of the soil, and the kind of trees at once suited to it, and to the uses to be made of them.  
Estimating the crop of wood yielded by an acre at twenty cords, the period of re-production at twenty years, and the average number of cords annually consumed at a fire place, including the culinary consumption, at ten cords; every fire place on a farm will require ten acres for a permanent supply of fuel. For the other necessities of the farm, several acres more ought to be added.  
An estimate in a very sensible publication, entitled “The New England Farmer,” makes seventeen acres necessary for a fire place. The winters there are longer, and the climate may be less favourable to the quick growth of trees. But their houses are generally closer than with us; to say nothing of a more judicious management than can be enforced on most of our farms.  
To this catalogue of errors in our rural economy, considerable as it is, many, I fear, might be added. The task of pointing them out, I gladly leave to others, less incapable than I have shewn myself to be, by the very imperfect manner in which I have performed the one on which I ventured.

And tli.it there ts a disinclination inhu­  
man nature to exchange tiie savage for

tual sufferings from a deficient and meet!

from their strong propensities and habit­  
ual pursuits. In !he same spirit, they al­  
ways betray an anxious disposition to re­  
turn to their pristine life, after being wean­  
ed from it by time, and apparently mould­  
ed by intellectual and moral instruction,  
into the habits and tastes of an agricul­  
tural people. A still more conclusive evi­

The bent of Ihiiiu.n nature muy be tra­

manufacturer readily &lt; \&lt; hang&#x27; s the loom  
tor the pl.-ugh, in opposition olti u to ins

sentuig an option, prefers to the labors of  
the field, tl.e more easy employ men! of  
rearing a herd. And as the game of the  
forest is appieaehed, the hunting life dis­  
plays the force ot its alii actions. Where  
do we behold a march in Hie opposite di­  
rection ( the hunter, becoming the herds­  
man ; the latter a follower ol the plough ;  
and the last repairing to the nniiiuluetory  
or the win !•. -hop.  
Such, indeed, is the fascination of that  
personal imlcp,‘iideiue which belongs to  
ltie uncivilized slate, ami such the dis  
relish and contempt ol the monotonous  
b.ibor of tillage, compared with the ex­  
citing &lt; ct upatioiis ot the chase, or with  
the indolence enjoyed by those who sub­  
sist chiefly oil the meie bounties ot na­  
ture, or on their migratory flocks, that a  
voluntary relinquishment ol these latter  
modes ot hie, is little to he expected. We  
certainly peiceive nothing in the ilia rac­  
ier of our savage neighbors, from which  
it could he inferred that even the germs  
ol agriculture, observed in then spots of  
iiiai/c, and a few other cultivated plants,  
would ever h:‘ developed into the extent  
implied by an agricultural life. To that  
little resource com!* ined with the game j  
furnished by the forest ami by the lake or  
the stream, their population and habits j  
are adjusted. There may be said, in fact,  
to In* a plenum of the former ; because it !  
is commeiisiiiate vvitli their food, and lhi«- j  
cannot I c increased without a change of  
habits, which being founded in natural  
pine usiiifs, do not changeol’tlieuiselves.  
’• i.i first introduction of agriculture ;i­

dingly, never to have taken place witii­  
oat some extraordinary interposition....

I oral stale, said to have t»*eu brought a­  
bout by Manco f&#x27;.i, ac, among ti e Peru­  
vians, io whom lie represented Imusclf as  
the offspring ol the sun.  
Agriculture once efleetnallv commenc­  
ed, may proceed of it--elf, under impulses  
ol its own creation. The mouths fed by  
it increasing, and the supplies of nature  
decreasing, necessity becomes a spur to  
industry ; which finds another spur, in  
the advantages incident to the acquisition  
ofpropcrty.iii the civ ilized state. A ml thus  
a progressive agriculture, and a progres­  
sive population ensue.  
Rut although no determinate limit pre­  
sents itself to the increase of food, and  
to a population commensurate with it,  
other than the limited produe lvcness of  
the earth itself, we can scarcely he war­  
ranted in supposing that all the produc­  
tive powers of its surface can be made  
, subservient to I he use ol man, in exclu­  
sion of all the plants and animals not en­  
, toting into his slock of subsistence; that  
all the elements and combinations of ele­  
ments in the earth, the atmosphere, and  
the wafer, which now support such vari­  
ous and such numerous descriptions of  
created beings, animate and inanimate,  
could he withdrawn from that general  
destination, and appropriated to the ex­  
clusive support and increase of the human  
part of the creation ; so that the whole  
habitable earth should be as full of peo­  
ple, as the spots most crowded now are or  
might he made, and as destitute as those  
spots, of the plants and animals not used  
by man.  
&#x27;The supposition cannot well be recon­  
ciled witii that s&gt;nimelry in the face of  
nature, which derives new beauty from  
erv insight that can In* gained info it.  
It i forbidden also by the principles and  
laws which operate in various depart­  
ments ot her economy, falling within the  
scope of common ob.-ei vation, as well as  
within that &lt;»t philosophic researches.  
The earth c»mi«itis not less than thirty  
or forty tlion-aiid kinds of plants ; not  
less thru si\ or seven hundred of birds ;  
nor less than three or tour hundred of  
quadrupeds; to say nothing of the thou­  
sand species of fishes. Ot reptiles and  
inserts, there are more than can he num­  
bered. To all It eve unist he added, the  
swarms and varieties of animalcules and  
uimute vegetables not v isibleto 1 lie natu­  
ral eve, hut whose existence is probably  
connect&#x27;d with that ot visible animals and  
plants.  
(&gt;n comparing this vast profusion and  
multiplicity of beings with the lew grains  
and grasses, the few h&lt; rbsand roots, and  
the lew fowls a ml quadrupeds, which make

tion net only of individuals, but ol entire

but of every species, with Use very few ex­  
ceptions winch be might sparelorlitsown  
accommodation.  
Such a multiplication of the human  
rare, at the expence of the rest of the or­  
ganized ncalion, implies that the food of  
a!i plants is composed of elements equal­  
ly arid indiscriminately non:idling all,*  
and which consequently may be wholly  
appropriated to the one or few plautsbcst  
titled for human use.  
Whether the food or constituent matter  
I vegetables, be furnished from the  
tailh, the air o&lt;- water; and whether di­  
rectly, or by either tlnougll Hie medium  
of tin: others, no sufficient ground ap­  
pears fur the inference that the leod lor  
. all is the same.  
Irdferciil plants require different soils ;  
i s une Horn i hiny in sandy, some hi clay »*y,  
I some in moist, some in dry soils; some  
in warm, some in cold situations. Many  
grow only in water—and a few sub i.-t in  
tin a&#x27;nrovphcre. The forms, the H xi arcs  
, and the qu; liti*.s of plants, are slillmorw

Hut this operation has it- limits, it does  
not extend beyond plants having a certain  
utiinity. &#x27;i&#x27;lic apple tree may be planted  
on the pear or quince, it will not suc­  
ceed on the peach or the cherry. If the  
eases prove that tin* same fo&lt; d suffices  
lor tile apple and llu* pear; Ijiey cquailv  
prove that dilieieiit tomls are required  
for ihe apple and the peach. It is said  
even, tIn:t the fruit from the peach guilt  
on the &lt;*imoinl, is not pr&lt; ei-^ly the seme  
with that liom a peach graft on a plain.  
It may b&quot; offered asanott^r argument  
to the same «beet, that all animal and ve­  
getable decompositions answer indisen­  
minat« ly as manures. The fact is not  
precisely so. Certain manures sue eed  
her I vviio certain plants. It is true never

animal from 1 lie water, is -itcressdully us  
ed as ,i manure !&lt;&gt;;• Indian corn amt other  
crops. Hut this and similar examples  
prove only tlial some ingredients are the  
same in all animals and plants; nut that  
all the ingredients in each are the same.  
I lie chemist, though as yet a fellow  
stud ‘i;tf *a« much a-j a preceptor of the  
agriculturist, justly claims attention to  
the result of his processes. From tliat  
source w e learn that the number of k now n  
elements, not yet decomposable, is be­  
tween forty mid fifty ; that about seven  
or eight belong to tl;e organs of plants ;  
that different elements enter in*o the com­  
position of the same plant ; and that thee  
are combined in dilferrnt numbers and  
in different proportions, in difteienf  
pistils. Supposing then as inert be sup­  
posed, that Iliese different elements, in  
their actual quantities an ! p portions,  
are adapted to the quantiit and the  
proportion- of the existing varieties of  
plants; it would happen in so great a  
change as that in qucslion witli respect  
t the number and variety of plants, that  
the quantities and tin* proportions uf the  
element , would not he adapted to the  
particular kinds and number* of plants  
retained by man for his own use. Like  
the types of the alphabi t, apportioned to  
the words composing a particular hook,  
W (II amdie.f to another hunk ■ ii:Orri:i)l t­  
  
different in i&lt;s contents, there would be,  
of some a deficiency, of others a useless  
surplus.  
Were it less d&#x27;fiicull to admit that all  
the sources of prndiictivcues« could be  
exclusively appropriated to the food of  
man, is it certain that an obstacle to his  
indefinite multiplication would not be en­  
countered in one of the relations between  
the atmosphere and organized beings?  
Animals including man, and plants may  
be regarded as t lie most important part  
of tlie terrestrial creation. They are pre­  
eminent in their attributes; and all na­  
ture teems with their varieties and their  
multitudes, visible and invisible. To all  
of them the atmosphere is the breath of  
life. Depriv.d of if, they all equally pe­  
rish. Hut it answers this purpose by vir  
t u e of its appropriate &lt; (institution and cha­  
tarler. \Yhal are these?  
The atmosphere is not a simple but a  
compound body. In its least compound  
state, it is understood to contain, besides  
what is called &gt; Pal air, others noxious in  
l Item selves, yet without a portion of  
which, the vital air becomes noxious.  
ButI Ibeatmosplitre in its natural state, &amp;  
in its oidiliarv communication with the  
organized world, comprizes various ingre­  
dients or modifications of ingredients de­  
rived from the use made n! it, by the ex­  
isting variety of animals amt plants.  
The exhalations and perspirations, the  
effluvia and transpiiations of these, arc  
continually charging the atmosphere with  
a heterogeneous variety and immense  
quantity of matter, wine &gt; together must  
contribute to the character which fits it for  
its destined purpose of supporting the life  
and health of organized beings. Is it  
unreasonable t&lt;&gt; suppose, that if instead  
ut the actual composition and character  
of the animal ami vegetable creation, to  
which the atmosphere is now accomoda­  
ted. such a composition and character of  
that creation, were substituted, as would  
result from a reduction of the whole to  
man and a lew kinds ofanimalsand plants ;  
is the supposition unreasonable, that the  
change might essentially affect the apli­  
tiule of the atmosphere for the functions  
required ot it ; and that so gn at an inno­  
vation might be found in ibis respect,  
not to a cord wit h the order and economy  
of nature?  
The relation of tire animal part and the  
vegetable part of the creation to each oth­  
er, through the medium of the atmos­  
phere, ( nines in aid ot (lie reflection sng.  
gesled by the general relation between  
tin atmosphere and both. Ii seems to |&gt;e  
now well understood, that the atmosphere  
when respired by animals, becomes un­  
fitted for tin ii further use, and fitted for  
the absorption of irgetahles; and that  
when evolved by the l itter, it is refitted  
fur the respiration of the former ; an in­  
terchange being thus kept up, by which  
this breath of life is received by evir-li, in  
a wholesome state, in return for if in an  
unwholesome one.  
Way it not be concluded from this ad­  
mirable arrangement and beautiful fea­  
ture in the economy of nature, that if the  
whole class of animals were exiiiiunislicd  
  
the use ol the atmosphere by the vegeta­  
ble class alone would exhaust it of its  
life-supporting power; that, in like man­  
lier, ii Hie whole class of vegetables were  
c\ti gmshed, th - use of it by the amnia*  
class, alone, would deprive it ol its tit lies*  
lor their support ? And if such would he  
the effect of an entire destruction of either  
class, it) relation to the other, the infer­  
ence seems to press itself upon us, that  
mi va«i a change in the proportions of  
each das to the other, and m the spe­  
c e* composing the respective classes, as  
that in question, might not be compati­  
ble tvi*11 the continued existence and  
I health of the reutaiiiingspecics of the two  
I classes.  
Tin* immensity of the atmosphere, com­  
pared with the mass of animals ami vege­  
tables, tot ms an apparent objection only  
to this view of the subject. The compar­  
ison could at mo-d suggest question* as to  
the period of time necessary to exhaust  
the atmosphere of it* unreiieived capacity  
to keep alive animal or vegetable nature,  
wlienklepriverl, either, ol’ the support ol  
the other. And tie* period contracts ii­  
s&lt; l! at once to the imagination, when it i­  
recollected that the immensity of the at  
mospliere i* tin* eilVi t of its elasti* iic ami  
rarefaction. We know fr in the biivrmw  
ter, that condensed to the specific gravity  
of mercury, it rise a&#x27;- «v&lt;- the • mfmr r ?  
the earth would be but ihotil thiity ine- -  
es ; and Iroin the well pump, tbrif cun  
dfu ed to the specific gravity on.&#x27;y of v&gt;.i­  
  
in, ivwvft&#x27;W rrv,mr“«rtr ITT&#x27;  
the human body, its rise would belittle  
more Ilian as many feet ; that is, a little  
more than five times the human stature.  
It is found that a single human person,  
employ* in respiration not loss than six­  
teen or eighteen times his own weight of  
common air, in every twenty-four hours.  
In different degrees, some greater, some  
less, the ease is the same with most otin r  
animals, i&#x27;iants make a correspondent  
use of air for their purposes.  
Other views of the economy of nature j  
coincide with the preceding. There is a  
known tendency in all organized beings*  
1 to multiply beyond the degree necessary  
to keep up their actual numbers. If is a  
wise pro\ision of nature._1, to guard  
against the failure of the species: 2, to  
afford, in the surplus, a food for animals  
whether subsisting on vegetables, or on  
other animals winch subsist on v egetables.  
Nature has been equally provident in  
guarding against an excessive multiplica­  
tion of any one species which might ton  
h.r encroach on others, by subjecting  
cadi, when unduly multiplying itself, to  
be arrested in its progress by the effect of  
tt:v* multiplication.... I, in producing a  
deficiency of food ; and where that may  
not happen, 2, in producing a state of the  
| atmosphere unfavorable to life and health.  
All animals as well as plants sicken and  
dir in a state too much crowded. It is  
the case with our domestic animals of ev­  
ery sort, where no scarcity of food can lie  
the cause. To the same laws mankind  
are equally subject. An increase, not  
consisting with the general plan of nature,  
arrests itself. According to the degree in  
which the number thrown together ex­  
ceeds the due proportion of space and air,  
disease and mortality ensue. It was the  
vitiated air alone which put out human  
I i fe hi the crowded hole of Calcutta. In  
a space somewhat enlarged, the effect  
would have been slower, but not less cer­  
tain. in all confined situations from the  
dungeon to the crowded workhouses, and  
from these to the compact population of  
overgrow n cities, the atmosphere becomes,  
in corresponding degrees, unfilled l&gt;\ re­  
iterated use, for sustaining human life and  
health. Were the atmosphere breathed  
in cities not diluted ami displaced l&gt;v  
fresh supplies from the surrounding coun­  
try, the moi tality would soon become gen­  
eral. Were the surrounding country  
thickly peopled and not &gt; freshed in like  
  
manlier, Hie decay of health, though a la­  
ter, would lie a necessary consequence.  
And were the whole habitable earth cor -  
end with a dense population, wasteful  
maladies might be looked for, that would  
thin the numbers iuto a healthy pro­  
portion.  
Were the earth in every productive spot,  
and ill every spot capable of being made  
productive, appropriated to the food of  
man ; were ihe spade substituted for the  
plough, and all animals consuming the  
food ot man, or food for winch human  
food might be substituted, banished from  
existence, so as to produce the maximum  
ot population on the earth, there would j  
be more than an hundred individuals, for  
every one now upon it. in the actual po­  
pulation ol many countries, it brings on  
occasional epidemics to be traced to no  
other origin than Ihe state of the atmos­  
phere. Increase the numbers ten or  
twenty fold, and can it be supposed that  
t hey would at any time find the breath of  
life in a condition to support it : or if that  
supposition be admissible when limited  
to a single country, can it he admitted,  
when not only the contiguous countries,  
but the whole earth wasequally crowded?  
Must we then adopt the opinion enter­  
tained by some philosophers, that no va­  
riation whatever in the numbers and pro­  
portions of the organized beings belong­  
ing to our globe, is permitted by the sys­  
tem ot nature; that the utiinher of species  
and of individuals, in theanimaland ve­  
getable empires, since they attained a des­  
tined complement,has been, and must al­  
ways be the same; that the only change  
possible, is in local augmentations and  
dminutinns which balance each other,  
and thus maintain the established and  
unalterable order of tilings ?  
This would be Ihe opposite extreme to  
that which lias been rejected. Man  
though so similar in his physical cousti  
liition to many other animals, is essenti­  
ally distinguished Iroin all other organiz­  
ed beings, by the intellectual and moral  
powers with which he is endowed. He  
possesses a reason and a will, by which  
lie can act on matter organized and un­  
organized. He can, by the exercise of  
these peculiar powers, increase his sub­  
sistence, by which his numbers may be  
increased beyond the spontaneous sup­  
plies of nature ; and it would be a rea­  
sonable conclusion, that making as he  
does in bis capacity ofan intelligent and  
voluntary agent, an integral part ol the  
terrestrial system, the other parts of the  
system arc so framed as not to be altoge­  
ther, unsusceptible of his agency, and uu­  
pliulile to ilscflects.  
i his reasonable conclusion is confirm­  
ed by ihe Ijct, that the capacity of man,  
d rived from his reason and his will, 1ms  
effected an increase of particular plants  
and animats conducive to an increase of  
his own race; and a diminution ot the  
numbers, it not of the species of plants  
and animals displaced by that hicreasu.  
Most, il noi ali ot nur domesticated a­  
  
m mu Is probably exceed lue numbers,  
which without the intervention of man,  
would be their natural amount; whilst  
thcHuiinnls pri zing on, or interfering with  
them, are proportionally reduced in their  
nuinhers.  
The case is the same with cultivated  
plants. They are increased beyond  
ilieir natural amount; and banish or pro­  
portionally ieduce such as interfere with  
them.  
Nor can it be said that these changes  
made by human ni t and industry in some  
regions, are balanced by corresponding  
changes made by nature,&#x27; in other regions.  
Take for examples, the articles of wheat,  
rice, millet and niaiz&#x27;*, which are the  
chief loot! of civilized man; and which  
are now spread over sm li immense spa­  
ces, It is not possible to regard tin ih,  
as occupying no more than their original  
and fixed proportions of Hie earth ; and  
that in other parts of it, they have disap­  
peared in the same degree m which they

Hides to which its growth is limited by the  
nature of the plant, are for the most part  
so well • known, that it may l»e assumed  
lor an unquestioned fact, I lint this grain  
cannot always have prevailed any where,  
in the extent ill which it is now cultivated.  
And ills equally certain, that the vegeta­  
ble productions belonging to the same cli­  
mates, which must have been displaced  
by its cultivation, have not received an I  
equivalent introduction and extension  
elsew here.  
It is remarkable that the vegetable pro­  
ductions most extensively used a&gt; human  
loot!, are but little if at all found in their  
indigenous stale ; whether that state be  
the same as their present one, or a state  
from which they were improvenblc .into  
their present state. They seem indeed  
not likely to flourish extensively in situa­  
tions not prepared by the hand of man...  
The potato so recently brought into use,  
and now spreading Hself over so great a  
surface, can barely be traced to a native  
stale in the mountains of Chili; nor can  
it he believed that previous to its adop­  
tion by man, it ever existed in the extent  
to which cultivation is now carrying it.  
These views of the subject seem to au­  
thorize the conclusion, that altho’there is  
a proportion between the animal and ve­  
getable classes of beings on onrglobe, and  
between the species tniacli class, with  
respect to which nature does mil permit  
such a change as would result from a de­  
slructioH of tiieanimals and vegetables not  
u-ed by man ; and a multiplication of the  
human race, aud of the several species of  
animals and vegetables used by it, sutli­  
ciclit to hit up the void : yet that there is  
a degree of change which the peculiar  
faculties of man enable him to make ; aud  
by making which his fund of subsist! nee,  
and his numbers, may be augmented ;  
there bring at the fame time, whenever  
his numbers, aud the change, exceed the  
admitted degree, a tendency in that ex­  
cess to correct itself

at least its lull share ol tin* blame. &#x27; Now  
only tor the first time, notwithstanding  
several meritorious examples of earlier  
date,a general attention set-nts to bcawa- &#x27;  
kened to the necessity of a reform. Patri­  
otic societies, the best agents fur eiTci-liog  
il, are pursuing the object with the ani­  
mation and intelligence which character­  
ize the efiorts ot a self-governed people,  
whatever he the objects to which they  
may he directed.  
Among these promising institutions, I  
cannot glance at the name- of those com­  
posing tlnit ol Albemarle, without being  
assured, that its full quota ot information  
w ill be furuished to the general slock, i  
regret only, that my own competency  
hears so little proportion to my wishes to  
co operate with them. That 1 raaj not he  
thought, however, deficient in good will,  
as well os in other reanisites, 1 shall ven­  
ture ui the ta»k, a task tin* least difficult,  
of pointing out some ot the most preva­  
lent errors in our husbandry, and which  
appear to he among those which may aie­  
iit the attention of the society, and the  
instinctive examples of ils members.  
!• The error find to I* • noticed is that  
of cultivating lard, either naturally poor  
or empoverisiicd I»y cultivation. &#x27;Phiser­  
ror, like many ot tiers, is the effort of hab­  
it, continued after the reason for it !cjh  
failed. \\ hiUt there was an abundance  
of fresh and fertile soil, it was I lie interest  
of the cultivator to spread his labor over  
as great a surface as lie could. Land be­  
ing cheap and labor dear, and the land  
co-operating powerfully whh the labor, it  
was profitable to draw as much as possi­  
ble Imin the land, i ihor is now minpa­  
raliicl* cheaper and land dearer. Where  
tabor has risen in price fourfold,da ml has  
risen tenfold. It might he profitable,  
therefore, now to contract the surface over  
w hit-li labor is spread, even if the soil re­  
tained its fleshlier sand fri tility. But this  
is nut the case. Much of the fertile soil  
is exhausted,and unfertile soilsa re brought  
into cultivation; and both t o-operating  
less with labour in producing the crop, it  
is necessary to consider how far lahorcan  
he profitably exerted on them ; whether  
it ought not to heap lied towards making  
them fertile, rather than in further impo­  
verishing them, or w hclher it might not  
he more profitably applied to mechani­  
cal occupations, or to domestic maiiiifac­  
I u res.  
In the old countries of Europe, where  
tabor is cheap, and land dear, the object  
is to augment labour, and contract the  
space on which it is tfnlplnyed. In the  
new settlements taking place inlhiscoun­  
try. the original practice here may he ra­  
tionally pursued. In the old settlements,  
the reason for&#x27;the practice in Europe is  
becoming daily less inapplicable ; and we  
ought to yield to the chance of cireum­  
  
stances, by forbearing tow ante our labour  
on land, which, besides not paying lor it,  
is still more empovertsl.ed, unil rendered  
more &lt;•&#x27; fticull !«» be made rich. The crop  
which is of least amount, gives the blow  
most mortal to the soil, it fas m l been  
a very rare thing to see land under the  
plough, not producing enough to feed  
the ploughman anil his horse ; and it is in  
such cases, ti at the death blow is given.  
1 be goose is hilled, without even obtain­  
ing I lie ( ov efedegg.  
I here caimo&#x27; U; a wore rational pi in*  
ciple in the code of agrirnlinre, llouilhat  
every farm which is in good heart, should  
he kepi so; il , t eveiy one uol in j,ood  
heart should he made so; and that what  
is right as to the farm &lt;/■ neruliy, is  
to every pari of every leun. .\ny system  
therefore, or want of -.i‘d« in, w I :ch tend­

v. fiat ha escap&#x27;d the calamity, it is tuny  
gratifying to observe how fast the im  
provemeiit is spreading burn the parent  
example. The \ e.luc of oui red hills, mi  
d-*r :i mode of cultivation which guards  
Their fcrtUity against wasling rams, is pro  
biddy exceeded by that of no uplands  
*•I:ufe\er ; and witltoiif that advantage  
they are exceeded in value by almost all  
•»ii• * is. They are little more than a lease  
t rw urs.  
tresides the inestiuiable advantage* from  
iioiu nt/il ploughing, in protecting the  
soil against the wasting effect of ruins,  
ill re is a gn at one in its preventing the  
i :\s thetuselve*. from being lost to tie]  
&lt;np. The Indian corn is the crop, w hich |  
mi st exposes the -oil to he carried off by j  
tin lain-* ; and it is at the same time the  
cr« p which most needs them. \\ here the |  
find is not only hilly, Ind the soil thirsty, !  
(a&gt; is the eas&gt;-particularly throughout tins  
mountainous ia&#x27; ge,) the preservalion of  
the rain as it tall -, between the drill d  
ridges, is «f peculiar impoitaucr ; ami its  
giadml settling dowuw arcs to the roots,!  
is the best possible mode of supplying]  
them with moisture. In the old method |  
of ploughing ^hallow, with tin* furrows up j  
and down, the rain as well as flic sod was  
lost.  
  
ill. The neglect of manures is another j  
error which claims particular notice. It j  
may be traced to the same cause with our |  
excessive cropping. In the early stages I  
nt our agriculture, it was more convenient  
anil more profitable, to bring new land in j  
to cultivation, than t i improve exhausted j  
land. The failure of uew laud has long i  
c alled for the impioveuieut of old land ; j  
hut habit lias kept u&gt; deal to the cull.  
Nothing is more certain than that con­  
tinual cropping without manure, deprives!  
the soil of its fertility. It is equally ci r­  
ti.ni that fertility may he preserved or  
restored, by giving to the earth animal  
or vegetable manure equivalent to tFie j  
matter taken from it; and that a perpetu  
at fertility is not, in itself, incompatible  
w ith an uninterrupted succession of crops.  
&#x27;Hie Chinese, it is said, smile at the i*f&lt; a,  
that laud needs rest, as if like animals it  
bud a sense of fatigue. Their soil does  
not need rest, because an industrious use &#x27;  
i&lt; made of every fertilizing particle, that  
can contribute towards replacing what I  
has been drawn from it. And this is the i  
more practicable with them,as almost the  
whole of wlmt is grown on their farms is  
cousnm d within them. That a rcslora  
lion to the eai til of all that annually grows  
on it, prevents its empoverishiiieiit, is  
sufficiently seen in our forests; win re  
the iiiiuuai exiivin* of the trees ami plants  
replace tin- f rtility of which they deprive  
t ie earth. Where frequent fires destroy  
tlie leaves and whatever else is annually  
dropped on flit* earth, it is wed known  
t hat l he land becomes poorer; this destruc­  
tion of the natural crop, having the same  
empovi risking! fleet,as a removalofa cul­  
tivated crop. A -&#x27;till stronger proof that  
an annual restoration to the earth of all  
its annual product will perpetuate its pro­  
ductiveness, is seen where our fields are  
h it uncultivated and uiijtaslurcil, lathi­  
t i-e tin soil, rec» iving from the decay of  
the spontaneous weeds and grasses more  
fertility than they extract from it, is for a  
tom-at least improved, not eiopovevished.  
Its improvement may he explained, bv  
the fertilizing matter which the weeds anil  
grinse&lt; derive from water and the atmos­  
phere, w hit&#x27;ll forms a nett gain to the earth.  
At what point, or from what cause, the  
formation and accumulation of vegetable  
mould from this gain, ceases, is not per­  
b q&gt;« very easy to be explainer!. That it  
»Ioi s cease, is proved by the stationary  
&lt; ondii&#x27;ioti of the surface of tliecarth in old  
forests ; and that t lie amnujit of the accu­  
mulation varies with the nature of the  
subjacent earth, is equally certain. It  
-nuns to depend also ou tlie species of  
t &#x27;ces and plants which happen to contri­  
bute tire materials tor the vegetable mould.

Dm* Answer lias been, that they have io&#x27;.i  
no small degree of it. If the fad lie o  
flier wise with regard to Egypt, it might  
he accounted for by the fertilizing inun­  
dations ol the Nile. With regard to Sicily,  
there may be something in the system ol  
husbandry&#x27;, or some particular local cir­  
cumstances, which countervail the con­  
tinued asportation of the fruits of the  
sod. lint it is far more probable, that the  
Island is less productive than it once was.  
It is certainly less of a granary for other  
countries now, than it was when it receiv­  
ed that title from the ai.cient Homans.—  
And its population being diminished, the  
inti runl consumption must also be &lt;tiini­  
nished. If a singleiarm is rendered less  
productive by a continued removal of its  
crops, without any adiquale returns, no  
reason occurs why it should not &quot;happen  
to h number of farms multiplied to the  
extent •! a w hole country.  
And that individual Iaruis do lose their  
fertility, in proportion as crops are taken  
tioni them, and relinks ol manure neg­  
lected, is u fact not likely to be ques­  
tioned.  
If it were, Yiiginia, unfortunately, is  
but too capable ot fmuisliiiig the piculs,  
ihr prevailing crops have been very ex­  
Ir.iu-ting, and the used manures has keen  
particularly neglected.  
Tobacco and Indian corn, which for a  
long time, on the cast side of the i&gt;lue  
l\! on lit a ins,w ire die art i. h s almost exciu­  
stsely cultivuled, and which continue to  
In* cuitii ated, the former extensively, the  
iatter universally , are know n fo L&#x27;e gr a’  
empoM-risluTs of the b&lt; i1. Win at, which  
lias lor a number ol years, formed a large  
pi llion ol the gem ra! crop, is also mi  
exhausting crop. So are lye amt oats,  
which enter occasionally into our tunning  
sy stem.  
\\ ilh so many consumers ol the fertility  
of the earth, and so little attention to the  
means ol repairing llicii lavages, no one  
can lie surprized at the impoverished lace  
of the country ; whilst ciery one ought  
to ho desirous of aiduigiu tl.e work id ro  
format ion.  
Tne first and main step towards it, is  
to make Ihe thieves restore as much as  
possible of the stolen fertility . On this,  
with other improvements which may lie  
marc hi our husbandry, wo must depend  
  
« 1’ M ». Hill IIIIIIiMUllil III. U (lie­  
sent degrart &lt;l condition.  
tobacco, not a great deal more than  
om- half &lt;&gt;i tin- niliie plant is carried to  
nunket. Tin-residue is an item on the  
list 01 manures ; ami it is known l&lt;&gt; be in  
its quality a v&gt;r&gt; rich one. The crop ot  
tobaci o, however, though nfgri at value,  
lovers but a small proportion of our cul­  
tivated ground ; and its offal can of course,  
contribute but lucoc.siiierably li» llie-geii­  
eral stixk ot manure. It is probable also,  
that what it ihn-s contribute, has been  
more carefully used as a manure, than a­  
ny otuer article imnislied by our crops.  
I he article which constitutes our prin­  
cipal manure, is wheat straw. It is of  
much importance, therefore, to decide a­  
right on the mode ot using it. There are  
three inodes:—1. Carrying it from (lie  
farm yard, utter lulling passed through,  
or being trodden and enriched by rattle.  
Iii tiiat mode, the greater part of it must  
be used, it used at all; the straw going  
tilin’that process, In-jug a necessary part  
of the food allotti d to t lie cattle. To de­  
tive the lull advantage from it, it ought  
In be hauled nut before the substance lias  
been wasted by rain, by the sun, and bv  
the wind; and to be buried in the earth  
as soon after as possible. 2. Spreading  
the stiaw mi »he surface of the ground!  
.Matty respectable farmers are attached to  
tins inode, as protecting the soil from the  
sun; and by keeping it moist, favoring  
the vegetation underneath, w helln-r spon­  
taneous or artificial ; whilst liir straw it­  
si 11 is gradually decomposed into a ma­  
nure. The objection to (his mode, is the  
Jo.-s by evaporation, before this last effect  
isoblaiued. 3. Turning theslrau at once  
under the surface of the earth. This  
would seem to be the best mode of ma­  
naging manures generally ; least i f tin ir  
substance being then lost. When tin­  
grain :s trodden out from the straw, if is  
left in a state easily admitting tins ope­  
ration. Some diffionby may attend it,  
w-lirn l he grain is threshed from lire straw,  
by tin- liail, or by tin* machines now in  
use, neither of which break the straw suf­  
ficiently to pieces.  
It may be remarked with regard to this  
article of manure—1. That its weight is  
barelv more than that of the grain.—  
2. That the grain is the part which makes  
the greatest draft oil the fertility of t!:c  
earth. 3. Thai the grain is for the most  
part not consumed within the farm. It  
is found on trial that a stalk of wheat, as  
generally cut, including the chart&#x27;, ami  
the grains borne by the stalk, art* pretty  
nearly of equal weight. The case is pro­  
bably the same with rye, and not veiy  
different with out-. The proportion of  
fertilizing .natter in tin* straw, to that in  
tlie grain, liars not,as far as I know, been  
brought to any satisfactory test. It is,  
•I....1.it...... i. l„. . «i ’ . . .i- i.  
  
alone, in the case of wheat, is with us re­  
turnable in any farm to the earth. This  
consideration, whilst it urges us to make  
the most of the article as a manure, warns  
us of its insufficiency.  
I lie stubble, and 1 lie roots of the small  
grains, not being taken front the earth,  
may be regarded as relapsing into a ferti­  
lity equal to that ol which they deprived  
the earth. This remark is applicable to  
all cultivated plants, the-rools of which  
are not an esculent part.  
An eminent citizen and celebrated ag­  
riculturist f of tins state, bus among o­  
tlier instructive lessons, called the public  
attention, to ilu* value ol the corn stalk  
as a manure. I am persuaded that be  
lias not overrated it. And H is a subject  
of agreeable reflection, that an article  
which is so extensively cultivated as that  
of Indian corn, and which is so particu­  
larly exhuu.sting, should lie the one so  
capable of repairing the injury it does.—  
The cornstalk as a fodder is of great va­  
lue. Not only file leaves, but the busk  
inclosing the ear, arid the &lt; nhinclosed by  
M, are ali more or less valuable lood when  
•Inly preserved and dealt out to cattle.—  
I&#x27;bere is no better fodder Ilian the I aves  
or&#x27;blaiies lor horses and oxen ; nor any  
so much approved for sheep. Tito husk or  
shuck is a highly nourishing fond fur neat  
• allie. And the pickifigsofthf shdk.rvcn at  
a late season, and alter much • xpostife to  
the weather, support them better than a­  
ny ol tiic straw-. From the saccharine  
mailer in the stalk, which i- long r- tuia  
ed about the joints, it &lt; anuot b&quot; doubled  
that it cMl early, or before exposure to  
the weulbcr, into parts small enough Im  
mastication,it would well repay,uaa food  
for cattle, the labour required fir it.  
The great value ot the cornstalk, in all  
its parts, as a to ider, was brought into  
t C«l. John Taylor.  
  
j full proof, 1:y the use made of it, during  
j the lalegeneral failureof crops. It isto he  
Imped that tile lesson will not be suffered  
to pa*&gt;s itito oblivion.  
But it is as a resource for re-fertilizing  
the soil, that the cornstalk finds the pro­  
per place here; and as such it merits par­  
ticulur notice, w hot Iter it be passed through  
animals ; or l&gt;c prepared by fermentation  
in the farm yard ; or be merely spread  
on flic surface of the earth, the mode tu  
which its effects must be least consult ta­  
ble. The same qualities which render  
every pait of i&#x27; ini i icions (&lt;&gt; animals, ren­  
der it nutricioiis to the eatlh; amt it is  
accompanied with the peculiar advanta­  
ges—I. That tlm grain itsell is mostly  
every where, and altogether in places dis­  
tant from ii-;\igation. eonsumed within  
the (arms producing it. *2. That as the  
•pain is in greater propoilion to the space  
on u Inch it grows than mosf other grains,  
so tin* re t of the plant is in greater pin  
pnilion to the grain, than tin- rest ol any |  
othei giaiu plant. Tin* siiaw and i hati  
ol thcsmall rgrains, a-aln.a :\ reu.ark­  
ed, is in w&gt; ight, hut a bon t one halt ol l lie  
grain. The cornstalk wild all its uppiu­  
teiiat &lt; rial is of not less than tlift eit . t -,  
and if taken early from the field, proha  
lily of not less than lour m live ti oCs tin­  
weight of the gtaiti belonging to it. 3.  
The I* itiliziug matter contained in tin-I  
cornstalk is greater it; proportion to its j  
weight, than that contained in the straw  
amt olial of oilier grains, is to the weight  
of th s&#x27;mv. ami offal.  
Would it be hazardin&#x27;&#x27; too much to  
say, that where a level surface, or tin*

ADDRESS BY MR. .MADISON,  
[LAlt Pit EVIDENT OF TIIS UNI I ID STATE*. J  
COM&#x27;U IZI&gt;.  
The cotton plant, which is so extrusive  
a crop, in tin* iiroic southern, ami the  
south western stall s, is but little cidtivut­  
eil in Virginia, and Parcel, at all in this  
part t&gt;l it. 1 am not able to say how far  
it is comparatively an exhausting crop.  
Hut it would seem to l»e more capable than  
any crop not wholly consumed within tin*  
farm, ol preserving its fertility. Tin- on  
I.V part of the plain carried away, is the  
cotton fibre, or wooly part, which- bears  
an inconsiderable proportion to the other  
parts in weight, and as.uia\ be inferred,  
hi U-: tihziug matter also. &#x27;I lie seed alone,  
passing by the ball and the haulm, is ol  
three times its weight, and contains the  
duct part of the oil in tlie plant. In the  
countries where cotton makes the princi­  
pal part of the crop, the s-pcrl-uous seed  
must deserve great attention as a manure.  
Where the fields ary level or cultivated  
in horizontal drills, it might go far to­  
wards supporting a Oii&#x27;nhk d cropping,  
w ill-out a diminished leri dity.  
U lie sum ot these remarks on culliva­  
[ ting poor land, and neglecting the means  
i ot keeping or making land rich, is, that  
j it every tiling grown on a soil is carried  
from it, it must become unproductive;  
that it every tiling grown on it, be di­  
rectly or indirectly restored tint, it would  
uni cease to be productive; and, conse­  
1 tjueiitly, that according to the degree hi  
which tlieonccr the other practice lakes  
place; a (arm inu-d he empoverish­  
i e&lt;J, or be permanently pioductiv-e and  
, profitable. Every a. re made by an im­  
proved management to produce as much  
us two acres, is in effect the addition of a  
new acre; with the great advantages, of  
contracting the space to be cultivated,  
and id shortening the distance of trans­  
portation between tiie holds, and the  
barn or the farm yard. Oueot the lui­  
u.au writers*&#x27; on husbandry , enforces the  
obligation to an improving management  
by a story of one Earidiu* who had two  
daughters amt a -uieyard : when the cl  
der was married, lie gave her u third pait  
of the vineyard; notwithstanding which  
i.n .aa..;.i #._ » .. .i. .’  
  
I crop as from the whole: when his other  
daughter was married, lie portioned her  
| with the half ol what remained ; and still  
the produce of his vineyard was uudimi­  
nislicd. The story short as it is, contains  
a volume ol instruct on.  
The plaster or gypsum, though not a  
manure within the farm itself, has been  
too long ueglectc , as a fertilizing re­  
source. It is now beginning to take a  
high and just rank as sin h. The proofs  
of its etlieaey are a- incontestihle, as the  
causes ol it are obscure. The expert  
mentsofa very distinguished ohemistt  
led him to the opi ■ ton iiiat its substance  
i ours into the substance of the plant.  
Without doubting the fact, it doe* not  
sufficiently ;:cccuul tor tin* addition made  
to the size and weight ot the plant, which  
gi rally exceed I he quantity ol the plas­  
ter. Ir inikl therefore have some fur­  
ther mode of op rating. Whether it he  
|&gt;Y neutralizing some noxious ingredient &#x27;  
in the earth, one of the modes by which  
lime is supposed to operate; or hy at­  
tracting ; ini conveying to the plant, loud  
fiom the earth, the air, or water; or by  
exciting the plant to a more active use ut  
ils feeding powers, whatever they he;  
or by its accretion and assimilation to  
the particular parts of pi mis on which  
these powers depend; thereby augment­  
ing and strengthening those paiticulai  
parts, and enabling the feeding powers to  
give proportional augmentation to every  
other part ; whether by any one or more  
of these processes, or i&gt;y some other or  
others distinct from them all the growth  
o; plants be promoted bv this mineral,  
remains il would seem to he yet explain­  
ed. In the mean time, a more extensive  
use ol it, promises much advantage to  
our agriculture. I take it however, that  
this advantage cannot he permanent  
without making the increased product of  
1he soil, a source of manure to the soil.  
That tlieeft-*ct of the plaster will he con­  
tinued iml finitely, under a constant re­  
moval oi tin: whole crop from the soil,  
surpasses belief. It can scarcely tail to  
exhaust at length, the productive powers  
of tlieearth. The period of time necessa­  
ry for the purpose, may be uncertain ;  
but that, as in the caseof the other mine­  
ral manures, lime and marie, such must  
sooner or later be the result, cannot well  
be so. The eflect of pulverizing tlieearth  
by tillage, as practised by Tull, is stated  
to have been uninterrupted crops of  
wheat, without manure, tor more than  
twenty years; which was regarded as a  
demonstration that Iillage, was a complete  
substitute for manure. Supposing the  
statement to he free from error, the infer­  
cncn t 2 coil&#x27;iiiiLr 11.vt I... « I. ..  
  
la t. We know that some of our soils  
not naturally richer than flic highly ma  
wired soils on which Tull probably com­  
menced his tillage, will bear a succession  
ot crops tor an equal period; and we  
know as well, that their fertility will not  
hold out tor ever. I low long plaster,  
whatever he its mode of operation, will  
hold out, may not yet have been fully  
tried. But to make it permanently suc­  
cessful, it will be wiseto lake for granted,  
that it must be made a source of future  
manure, as well as ot immediate produc­  
tiveness. II the crop as augmented hy  
the plaster be given back to the soil, the  
soil may he benefited more than it would  
b *, by the return ot a crop not augment­  
ed hy the plaster. And m ibis way fer­  
tility may he accelerated. The restora­  
tion of a crop increased by ordinary cul­  
tivation, lo the soil on which it grew,  
would, 1 presume, fertilize it more Ilian  
the restoration ot a smaller crop sponta­  
neously produced; although in both cas­  
es, the whole taken Irorn the soil would  
return to it.  
IV. Among the means of aiding 1 lie  
productiveness of the soil, which have  
not received merited attention, is irriga­  
tion, In scarcely any country does this re­  
source abound inore than in the U. States;  
nor is there any, where tli -re i-&gt; so little  
sensibility to it* value. The inconside­  
rable use made of il is chiefly hy emi­  
grants, particularly (irrmans, or tlie im­  
mediate descendants of them. I have  
understood that the market of Baltimore  
has been much benefited in drv seasons  
• Colamella. tSir.lf. liary.  
  
•&gt;v ihe iir.mvrnmummm  
&#x27;rom St. Domingo. For a distinguished  
proof of I lie importance of the practice,  
1 may refer to tire fact winch has been  
stated, that in the neighborhood ot Pur­  
celona in Spain, where a p u t ot the land  
is under irrigation, and a part is not sus­  
ceptible of it, both b ing otbeiwisc of  
equal fertility, the pel irrigated is of  
double price in the market. It is to be  
noted indeed dial tin climate is u dry  
one, and that tlieaiticir cultivated is Lu­  
cerne. Rut this is a | hint, which though  
much aided in it- growth hv ir-uisth&#x27; -,  
is at tlie same lime remarkable lor the  
length of a tap root, mid fitted bv that  
as well as hy the absorbent quality ol its  
leaves, to flourish in a thirsty soil, and  
warm climate. Our particular district of  
country, abounding in springs, small  
streams, and suitable declivities, admits  
great I v of irrigation ; and being general­  
ly of a thirsty nature, trie more strongly  
invites the use ol &lt;&gt;.  
! cannot but consider it as an error in  
our husbandry, that oxen are too little  
us d to place ot horses.  
K\ cry fair comparison of the ex pence  
ol the two animals, favors a preference  
of the ox. lint the circumstance parti­  
cularly recommending hiiu. is that lie  
can be supported w hen at work, by grass  
and bay; whilst the horse requires grain  
and much of it ; and the gram generally  
given him, Indian corn, the crop which  
requires most labor, ami greatly exhausts  
the i.:nd.  
From the best estimate I have been  
enabled to form, more than one half ot  
the corn crop is consumed by horses;  
including the utigrown ones; and not  
less than one half, by other than pleasure  
noises. i»v getting tree from this con­  
sumption, one half the labor, an.I of the  
wear of the land, would be sav ed, or ra­  
ttier more than one half ; lor on most  
farms, one half of the crop of corn grow s  
on not more than tw o till Its, and some­  
times u smaller proporilon, of the cultiva­  
ted fields; and the more fertile fit Ids  
would of course be letaincd f«*&gt;r cultiva­  
tion. livery one can figure to himself,  
I een-e and convenience id a revolution  
vi bieli would so much redu&#x27; cthe extent of  
his cornfields; and substitute fortlsc labor  
bestowed on them, the more easy task  
ol providing pasturage and Itav.  
Rut will not theox himself when kept at  
labor rctpiiregi a in food as vv ell as the liorsi ?  
Certainly much less, if any. Judging  
from my own observation. 1 should say ,  
that a plenty ol good grass, or good hay,  
will suffice without grain, where the  
labor is neither constant nor severe,  
lint I feel entire conlidene in saying, that  
a double set of oxen alternately at work,  
and therefore half the time at rcsl, might  
  
lie Kepi iii good plight without ntticrloop  
than a plenty of good grass or good hay.  
And as thisdouble set would double lltc  
supply of heel (allow and leather, a set  
oil in tumid in that consideration tor a  
double consumption of that kind of food.  
Tiie «&gt;bj&lt; ctions g&#x27; nerally made to the  
o\, sire—I. That lie is less tractable than  
the horse. 2. That he does not bear heat  
a* well. 3. That lie does not answer tor  
the y ngle plough used in our t orn fields.  
i. That In is slower &#x27;n his movements.  
6. That be is less tit for carrying the pro­  
duce of the farm to market.  
The first objection is certainly founded  
in mistake. Of the two animals, the ox  
is the more docile. In all countries w here  
the ox is the ordinary draught animal, his  
docility is proverbial. His intractabili­  
ty, where it exists, has arisen from an  
occasional use of him only with long and  
irregular intervals; during which the ha­  
bit of discipline being broken, a new one  
is to be formed.  
Toe 2d objection has as little founda­  
tion. The constitution of the ox accom­  
modates itself, as readily as that of the  
horse to different climates—Not only tn  
ancient Greece and Italy,but throughout  
Asia, as presented to us in ancient histo­  
ry, the ox and the plough are associated.  
At this day, in the warm parts of India i  
and China, the ox, not the horse is in the I  
draught service. In every par! of India,  
the ox always appears, even in the train  
of her armies. And in thehottest pails  
ot the West Indies, the ox is employed  
m hauling the weighty produce to the  
seaports. &#x27;I be mistake here, as in the  
former ease, lias arisen, from the effect of  
an occasional employment only, with no  
other lliau green food. Tile fermentation  
of thiss in thcaiiimal healed by the wea­  
ther, and fretted by the discipline, will  
readily account for his sinking under his  
exertions; when green food even, mueh  
less dry, with a sober habit of labor, would  
have no such tendency.  
The 3d objection also is not a solid  
one. The ox can by a proper harness,  
lie used singly as well as the horse, lie.  
tween tin: rows of Indian com; and e­  
«junity so used for other purposes. Ivx­  
perience may be safely appealed to on this  
point.  
In the lib place, it is alledgccl fliat lie  
is slower in his movements. This is true,  
hut in a less degree, than is often taken for  
granted. Oxen that are well chosen forlheir  
form, are not worked after the age ol •bout  
8 years,(the ageat which ihey&#x27;are best fit­  
ted for beef,) arc not worked too many  
together, and are suitably matched, may  
  
nr|»i i*f 111 «• * iy as quick a as uir  
horse. May I not say a step quicker than  
that of many *&gt;l the horses weseeut work,  
w h«&gt;, on account of their age, or the lean  
ness occasioned by the costliness of the  
food they require, lose this advantage,  
where they might have once had it?  
Tlie last objection has most weight.—  
The o\ is not as well adapted n-j the horse  
to the road serviep, especially for long  
trips. Iii common roads, which are often  
s&lt;df, and sometimes suddenly become  
so, the form of his foot, and ihe short­  
ness of his leg, are disadvantages ; and  
on roads frozen, or turnpiked, the rough­  
ness of the surface in the former case,  
and its hardness in both case.*, are in­  
convenient |n Ids cloven hoof. But where  
the distance to nark* t is not great, where  
the varying state of the roads and of the  
weather, can b* consulted; and where  
the road service is in less proportion to  
the farm service, the objection is almost  
deprived of its weight.Iii cases  
where it most applies, its weight is dimi­  
nished by the consideration, that a much  
greater proportion of service on the farm  
may be done by oxen, than is now com­  
monly done ; and that the expcnce of  
■hoeing them, is littledifl&#x27;eront from that  
of keeping horses shod. If is observable,  
that when oxen are worked on the (arm,  
over rough frozen ground, they suf­  
fer si* much from tlie want of shoes, how­  
ever well fed they may be, that it is a  
proper subject for calculation, whether  
true economy does not require for them,  
that accommodation, even on the farm,  
as well as for the horses.  
A tnoru important calculation is, wire­  
  
saving by substituting the ox tor the  
horse, would not balance the expencc ol  
Idling a carriage of the produce to mar­  
ket. Iti the same scale with the lure, is  
to be put the value of the grass and hay  
consumed by the oxen; and in the other  
scale, 1 lie value ot the corn, amounting  
to one half ot the crop, and of the grass  
, and hay consumed by the 1 ones. Where  
the market is not distant, the value of the  
corn saved, would certainly pay for the  
carriage ol the market portion of the  
crop, and balance moreover any differ­  
ence bit n ecu tiie valued the grass and  
hay consumed n\ oxen, and the v.lneol  
toe oxen when slaughtered for beef. In  
ml these calculations, it is doubtless pro­  
per, uof to lose sight ol the rule, that far­  
mers ought to avoid paving others for  
.doing, what they can do for themselves.  
Hul the rule has its exceptions; and the  
error, it it be committed, will n&lt;&gt;t lie in  
departing from the rule, but in not se­  
lecting aright the cases which call I n the  
departure. It may In* remaiked, ihatllir  
rule ought.to hr more or less general, as  
there may or may not heat hand, a market  
by which every produce ot labour is con­  
verlible into moifey. I »die old countries,  
tin - i&lt; much more the case than in new; ami  
in new, much mure the case near towns  
than at a distance from them. In this as  
in most other parts ot our eountrv, a  
change of circumstances is Taking place,  
which rriideiRcven thing raised on a farm  
more convertible into money than for­  
meilv ; and as the change proceeds, it  
will |&gt;e more and more a point for consi­  
deration, how far the labor in doing what  
might lie bought, could earn more in a­  
nntherwav, than the amount of the nm  
chase. Still it will always lie prod nt,  
for reasons which every experienced far­  
mer will understand, to lean to ihc side of  
doing, rather than hiring or buying, vvhal  
may be wanted.  
The mule seems to be in point of eeo  
nomy, between tin* ox and the horse ;  
preferable to the latfer, inferior to the  
former; but so well adapted to particu­  
lar services, that be may find a proper  
place on many farms. Me is liable to the  
objection v. Iiicb weighs most again*! tin*  
ox. He is less lilted than the horse for  
mad service.  
V. A more manifest error in the hus­  
bandry of l he older settlements, is that  
of keeping too mauv peat cattle on their  
farms. Asa farm should not lie cultivated  
farther than it can be continued in good  
heart ; the slock of cattle should not be  
in greater number than flic resources of  
food will keep in good plight, if a poor  
farm be uhprofitable, so are poor cattle.  
It is particularly the case with, the milch  
cows. When tin* whole of the food giv­  
en them is necessary to support a lean  
  
t, iiu | &gt; 4i 11 I&#x27;rtii ur mr i.io  
milk pail. The same food given l&lt;&gt; ihe  
proper number, will not only keep them  
in a thrifty state, hut enable them to sup­  
ply the dairy. Rvcn the manure from se­  
veral poor cattle is worth less than that  
from a single fat one. The remade holds  
equally good with respect to the hide.  
The misjudged practice in question, is  
another effect of inattention to the change  
of circumstances through which our coun­  
try has passed. Originally the forest a­  
b.mnded in rich herbage w hich f-d and  
fatted, without expense, all the cattle that  
could be brought through the winter into  
the spring. It was natural sit that timeto  
keep as large a stock as could he preserv­  
ed through the winter, fora longtime  
past, the forest is scarcely any where a  
resource for more than two&#x27;or time  
months : and in many places, no resource  
a t all. A greater difficulty is often fell in  
finding summer, tha winter subsist* nee.  
And yet where no inclosed pasturage is  
provided to take the place ot the extinct  
one in the forest, the habit, founded in  
reasons which have entirely ceased, is hut  
too generally retained. The same num­  
ber of cattle is aimed at, as if the forest  
wits as ready to receive and fatten them  
now as formerly. The s«e and appear­  
ance of our neat cattle, compared with  
those lor which nature or good husbandry  
has prov irled sufficient food, arc proofs  
that their food i-not in proportion totlieir  
number ; and that win re the food cannot  
be increased, the number ought to be re­  
duced .  
VI. Of all the errors in our rural econo­  
my none is perhaps so much to be regret­  
ted, because none is so difficult to ho re­  
paired, as the injudicious and excessive  
destruction of timber and firewood. It  
seems never fo have occurred that the  
fumI was not inrxhausliblc, and that a  
crop of trees could not be raised as quick­  
ly as one of wheat or com.  
I li re again we arepresented with aprool  
of the continuance of a practice for which  
the reasons have ceased. When our an­  
cestors arrived, they found the trees of  
the forest the great obstacle to their set­  
tlement an I cultivation. The great effort  
was of course to destroy t lie trees. It  
would seem tli;:t they contracted and  
transmitted an antipathy to them: for the  
trees were not even spared around the dwel­  
lings, where their shade would have been  
a comfort, and their beauty an ornament;  
and it is of late years only, that these ad­  
vantages leave been attended to. In fact  
such lias been the inconsiderate and in­  
discriminate use of the axe, that tins conn­  
  
try is beginning to led the calamity ns  
muHi as some of the old countries of Eu­  
rope : and it will soon be forced lo under­  
stand the difficulty of curing if. A vast  
proportion o( the farms on the eastern  
side of the blue 1’idgr, and some even on  
the other side, have but a scanty fund for  
present use, and are without a fund for  
permam n1 use. And to increase the evil,  
the remnant of limber and fuel on many  
farms, inadequate as it is, is lott in situa­  
tions remote from the dwelling, and inca­  
pable of being divided, according to the  
divisions and subdivisions into which all  
the larger larms must be rapidly forced  
by the law of descents, the impulses ot  
parental affection, and other causes,  
i It is high lime for many farmers even  
j in this quarter, and still more so in the  
j country below us, to take I his subject in­  
to serious consideration. Prudence will  
no long r delay to economize what re­  
mains of woodland ; to foster the second  
growths where taking place in convenient  
spots : and to commence, where necessa­  
ry, plantations ol the trees recommended  
by tlicir utility and quickness of growth.  
1 wish I could more satisfactorily esti­  
mate the proportion of woodland which  
ought to belong to every farm, as a per  
ruanent fond oi timber lor building and  
repairing houses ; for fences, where live  
or st.me ones may not be introduced ; for  
wheel carriage*, and the other apparatus  
needed on farms, &#x27;{&#x27;he estimate is the  
more (iiliicu because it must be varied

on a farm will require ten tier, «. for aper­

Continued from our Inst.  
Other riews of the yeomanry of. nature  
C-Miiclilc with the preceding. There is a  
known tendency in all organized beings  
to multiply bevond the degrees necessary  
to keep up their actual numbers. It is a  
wise provision of nature. 1. to guard  
aramst the failure of the species,: 2, to  
ard, in the surplus, a food for animals  
whether smlvisthig on vegetables, or on  
ether animals wlrch subsist on vegetables.  
Kit!ir lias been equally provident in  
cnnrd:n against an excessive multiplica­  
tion of anv one species which might too  
far encroach oh others, by subjecting  
each, when unduly multiplying itself, to  
be arrested in its progress bv the effect of  
the mnlt&#x27;r-Iicit&#x27;.on. 1, m producing a de-  
  
fir1  
I&#x27;ll)! t  
and where that mav not  
, honen, in producing a tate of the ar­  
m pher&quot; un favor-1 !e to life and health.  
All ;in;Tvls as we;i s plants, sicken and  
-die in a state too rnuch crowde 1. I&quot; is  
the &quot;ise with our c mestic animals of e­  
vcr nrt, where r.o scarcity offimd can  
b &quot; f n mse. To the same tows mankind  
i. - ?.t&#x27;;y subject. An increase, not crn­  
si: rg with the 2rener:d plan of nature,  
arr- ts itself. According to the degree  
in which the number thrown, together ex­  
ceeds the due proportion of space and air,  
disease and mortality ensue. It was the  
&quot;vitiated air alone which put ont human  
life in the crowded hole of Calcutta. In  
sl space somewhat enlarged, the effect  
-would have been slower, but notless ctr­  
t;?;n. Tn all confined situations from the  
dungeon to the crowded workhouses, and j  
from these to the compact population of j  
overgrrwn cities,the atmosphere becomes,  
in corresponding degrees, unfitted by re- j  
iterated use, for sustaining human life cc  
health. Were the atmonaere breathed j  
in cities rot diluted and displaced by fresh ;  
-supplies fv.m the surrounding country, 1  
the mcmlity would snc n hec.f.me general. ;  
Were tie surrounds? country tniCKtv  
peopled u.d r.nt refreshed in Ilk manner,  
the decay of health, though a later, would j  
be a necessary con.-eqiwr.ee. And were  
- t  
the whole habitable earth covered with a  
dense population, wri-teful maladies m;ght  
be lroked for, that vvr.nM thin the num­  
bers into a healthy proportion.  
Were the earth in -everv productive  
spot, and in pvpiv spot capable of being  
made product&#x27;. ve, .ipprcpviated fo the  
food of n.ro ; were the snade substituted  
for the plough, and all animals consuming  
the food of man, or food for which human  
feed might be substituted, banished from  
existence, so as to produce the maximum  
of r; pu&#x27;ation on the earth, there would  
be more than an hundred individuals, for  
every one now upon it. In the actual po­  
pulation of many countries, it brngs rn  
occasional &#x27;epidemics to be traced to no  
other origin- than the state of theamo-phn-e.  
Increase the numbers ten or  
twenty fold, and can it be supposed tb.Pt  
thev would it any time find the breath of  
life in a addition to supoort it ; or it  
th it supposition be admissible when limi­  
ted to a single country, can it be admitted,  
wher. not only the contiguous mum ties,  
but tlie whole earth was equally crowd-  
ea r J :  
M&#x27;it we then adont the opinion enter- j ;  
tained hv some t;hilosrrhers. that no vn  
ri,t;nn Ivmit in thp niimhpre nnd nrn-  
portions of the organized, beings belong-!  
ing to our globe, is permitted bv the svs- I  
tern of nature : that the number of species  
and of individuals, in the ar.jmal and ve i  
getable empires, since tney attained a  
designed con.plement, has been, and must  
always be the sanv ; .that the only change  
possible, is in local augmentations and di­  
minutions which balance each other, and  
thus maintain the established aud unal­  
terable order of tilings ?  
t i  
This would be the opposite extreme to  
that which has been rejected. Man t  
. though so similar in his physical constitu­  
tion to many other animals, is essentially  
distinguished from all other organized le­  
ings, &quot;by the intellectual and moral pow­  
ers with which he is endowed. He pos­  
sesses a reason ar.d a will, by which he  
can art on matter organized and unor  
ganized. . He can, by the exercise of;  
these peculiar powers, increase bis sub- :  
Vistence, bv which his numbers may be i  
inc.re:ied bevond the spontaneous sup-  
plies ot nature ; ar.d it would oe a reason­  
able conclusion, that making as he does  
in his capacity of an intelligent and vo­  
luntary agent, an integral part of the ter­  
restrial system, the other parts of the  
system are so framed as not to be alioge­  
tiier, unsusceptible of hisigency, and uu-  
pli.iV:- .. t.v .-Lects I  
This reasrnal&#x27;e concluvT&quot;5 &#x27;s confirmed  
by the fact, thtt the capacity of man, de­  
rived from hi reason and his will, has  
effected an i:.cieas- of particular plants  
and animals conducive to an increase of  
Lis own i ;cc ; uv.d a diminution of the  
rumbe-s, i: r t cf the species of plants  
and r.nimals displaced by that increase.  
M-M. if r.r ail :A our d(meslicatedn-nian:d.-,  
prch ,b!y exceed t!e numbers,  
which v it-.c&#x27;.t ti e intervention of man,  
vonid b their natural amount; whilst  
the urnrd-i &#x27; - eying on, or interfering with  
them, are pi uponionabiy reduced in their  
number.-.  
The cac is tlae same with cultivate&quot;  
plants. Thev are incre.-.svt&#x27;. bevond thc.r  
.:&quot;.&#x27;&#x27;&quot;..&#x27;.&#x27; . . &#x27;.  
aiurai atucunt , ai;U Dajusa cr prcpor-  
  
I tionally reduce such as interfere with  
  
them.  
Xor can it be said that these changes  
made by human art and industry in some  
regions, are &quot;balanced by corresponding  
changes made bv nature, in other regions  
Take for examples, the articles of wheat,  
&#x27;ice, millet and maize, which are the  
chief food of civilized man ; and which  
are now spread over such immense spaces;  
It is no possible to regard them, as oc­  
cupyinr no more than their original and  
fixed proportions of the earth ; and that  
in other parts of it. thev have disappear  
ed in the same degree in which&#x27; they are  
thus artificially extended. I hese grains  
belong to the torrid &amp; temperate zones on­  
ly ; &amp;so great a portion of these zones have  
been explored that it is certain, they  
could not have been displaced from other  
parts of the globe, in the degree in which  
they abound where they are now cultiva­  
ted, and where it is certain they owe their  
abundance to cultivation. There must  
consequently be an absolute increase of  
them produced by the agency of man.  
Take more pa rticularly r an exam  
pie, the article of rice, which constitutes  
o large a portion of human food. The,  
latitudes&#x27; to which its growth is limited by  
the nature of the plant, are for the most  
part so well known, that it maybe assum  
ed for an unquestiont d fact, that this grain j  
cannot a i ways have prevailed anv where,  
in the extent in which it is now cultivated.  
And it. is equally certain, that the vege­  
table productions belonging to the same  
climates, which must have heen displaced  
by its cultivation, have not received an j  
&quot; m r &#x27;  
equivalent introduction cc extension else­  
where.It is remarkable that the vegetable pro­  
ductions most extensive&#x27;v used a iriman  
f.od, are but little if at all fount; in their in­  
digenous state ; whether that sta&#x27;e be the  
same as t heir present one, or h st.te from  
wb&#x27;ch trey were improvable into their;;  
present state. Thev serrn, indeed, not J

merited; there being at the same thr.e.  
&#x27;, whenever his nirnbi rs and the change  
exceed the admitted degree, a tendency  
.in tliat excess to correct itself.  
Co:M it however be suniosed that the  
established system ami svmmetrv of na-  
jlture, required the number ot human be- j;  
j.i&#x27;-gs on xhf globe tr be always the same ;  
&quot;hat the r.iv change permitted in ration  
: to them, was in their distribution over it ;  
j still, as the blessing of existence to that  
number would materially depend on the  
pans or tr.c glone on wnjen tney may be  
: thrown ; on the degree in wmcu their si­  
iitnatinn mav be convenient or crowded :  
and on the nature of their poli ical and  
social institutions ; motives would not be!  
wanting to obtain for our portion of the  
earth, its fullest share, by improving the &#x27;  
! J resources of human subsistence, according i  
to the fair measure ot us capacity. For, ?  
in what other pnrtion of equal extent M  
will be found climates more fikndlv to j  
the health, or congenial to the feelings of  
us mnaoirantsr in wnat otner, a son

J tutu.ns equally securing the blessings ofjj  
i personal independence, and cf social en  
iiovments ? The enviable condition of the  
i people of the United States, is often too  
j much ascribed to the physical advantages  
oi iiieir sou and climate, and to their un-;  
crowded situation. Much is certamly  
dne to these causes bin a just estimate of  
the happiness of our country, will never  
overlook what belongs to the fertile acti­  
vity of a free people, and the benign in­  
fluence of a responsible government.  
In proportion as we relax the hypothe­  
sis which makes the aggregate number of  
mankind unsusceptible of chancre, and  
believe that the resources of our country  
! may not only contribute to the greater  
happiness of a given number, but to the  
j augmentation ot the nunber enjoying a  
&#x27;greater happiness, the motives become  
i stronger for the improvement and exten­  
jsionof them.  
i But, whilst ail are sensible that agricul-  
ture is the basis of population and prospe­  
&#x27; rity, it cannot be denied that tlie study  
and practice of its true principles have  
, hitherto been too generally neglected in  
1 the United States ; and this state has at  
least its full share &quot;of tlie blame. Now  
,jonly for the first time, notwithstanding  
i&#x27;se&#x27;eral meritorioas examples of earlier  
j tu.e, a general attention seems to te awa-  
  
krned to the necessity of a reform. Pa­  
triotic societies, the best agents for effect­  
ing it, are pursuing the object with the  
animation and intelligence which charac­  
terize the efforts of a self-goverired peo­  
ple, whatever be the objects to which  
they may be directed.  
Among these promising institutions, I  
cannot glance at the names of those com­  
posing that of Albemarle, without being  
assured, that its full quota of information  
will be furnished to the general stock. I  
regret only, that my own competency  
bears so little proportion to my wishes to  
co-operate with them. That I may not  
be &#x27;.ihought, however, deficient in good  
will, as well a.- in other requisites, I shall  
i enture - n the task, a task the least diffi­  
cu jt, of pointing out some of thetoK&#x27;St pre­  
valent errors in our husbandry, and which  
appeal to be among those which may me­  
rit the attention of the society, and the  
instructive examples of its members.  
I. The error first to be noth cd is that  
of cultivating land, either naturally poor  
or empoverished by cultivation. . This er­  
ror. 1 ke manr ot,&#x27;ien-,is the effect of habit,  
continued after the reason for it has fail­  
ed. Wh&#x27;lst there wss an abundance of  
fresh a;d fertile soil,, it was the interest  
of the cultivator to spread his labor over  
as great a surface as he could. Land be­  
ing cheap and labor rear, a:ul the land co­  
operating powerfully v. r.Si the labor, it  
was profitable to draw as much as possi­  
ble from the land. Labor is now compa­  
ratively clu:;per x land dearer. Where  
labor. has risen in price fourfold, land has  
risen tenfold It might be profitable,  
therefore, now to contract the &#x27; tn f-ice o-

There cannot be a niore&#x27;rniioriawpri:i­  
c.iple in thec-de of agviculure. ihaii that  
every farm which is in god heart, thouid  
hj kept so: that every one not in g:- d  
heart Miould be made so ; and that what  
is right as to die farm generally, is so as  
to even part of evej-y farm. Any system  
thei et&#x27;orc, or want of systc m, which tends  
to make a rich farm pcor, or dts rot  
tend&#x27; to ..make a poor farm rich, cannot be  
good fur the owner;; whatever it may be  
for the tenant cr superintendant, who has  
a transient interest only in it. The proht,  
where theic is any, will nit babn:ce the  
loss of intrinsic v alue susiaint-d by the  
laud.  
,11. The evil of pressing too hard upon  
the land, has a;so been much increased  
by the b.ai nnxle of ploughing it. Shallow  
j inughing, iavA pl-ieghing up and down  
hilly lai.d, have, by exposing the lcosen­  
eil soil L he carried offjy rains, hasten­  
ed more than any thing else, the waste of  
its fertil ty. When the mere surface is  
pulverized, moderate rains on land but  
little uneven, if ploughed up and down,  
gradually wear it away. And heavy rains  
on hUiy land ploughed in that manner,  
soon produce a like effect, notwithstand­  
ing the improved practice of deeper  
ploughing. How have the beauty and va­  
lue of this red ridge of country suffered  
from this cause? And how much is due  
to the happy improvement introduced by  
a member of this society, whom I need  
not name, by a cultivation in horizontal  
drills with a plough adapted to-it-? Kad  
:he practice prevailed from the first set­  
tlement of the country, the general ferti­  
lity would haye been, more than the dou­  
ble of what the red hills, and indeed all  
other hilly lands now possess ; and the  
scars and sores now defacing them, would  
no. where be seen. Happily, experience  
is proving that this remedy, aided by a  
more rational management in other re­  
spects, is adequate to the purposfrof heal­  
ing what has been wounded, as well as of  
preserving tlie health of what has escap­  
ed the calamity. It is truly gra nfying to  
observe uw fast tlie impro ement is  
spreading from the parent example. &#x27;1 1k  
Uuj of out red hills m&#x27;ti-.i oieofcrl t  
vation wnich guards their feriility against  
Col. T. jXT. Randslhtt  
  
wasting rains, is probably exceeded by  
that of no uplands whatever: and with­  
out that advantage they are exceeded in  
value by almost all others. They are lit­  
tle more than a lease for years.  
Besides the inestimable advantage from  
horizontal ploughing, in protecting the  
soil against the wasting effect of rains,  
there is a great one in its preventing the  
rains themselves from being lost to the  
crop. The Indian corn is the crop which  
most exposes the soil to be carried off by  
the rains ; and it is at the same time the  
crop which most needs them. Where the  
land is not only hilly, tut the soil thirsty,  
(as is the case particularly throughout  
this mountainous range) the preservation  
of the rain as it falls, between the drilled  
ridges, is of peculiar importance ; and its  
  
gradual settling downwards to the i ots, i  
is the best possible mode of supplying&#x27;&#x27;  
them with moisture. In the old method J  
of ploughing shallow, with the furrows up j  
and down, the rain as well as the soil was &#x27;  
lost.  
III. The neglect of manures is another i  
II  
error which claims particular notice. It 1  
I may he traced to the same cause with our  
j excessive cropping. In the early stages  
! of our agriculture, it was more convenient  
I aud more profitable, to bring new land in­  
to cultivation, than to improve exhausted

is proved by the stationary condition of  
the surface of the earth in ol.! forests ;  
and that the amount of the accumulation  
varies with the nature of the subjacent  
earth, is equally certain. It seems to de­  
pend also on the species of trees &amp; plants  
which happen to Contribute the materials  
fbr the vegetable nu uld.  
But, the most eligible mode of preserv­  
ing the richness, and of enriching the po­  
verty of a farm, is certainly that of ap:  
plying to the soil a. sufficiency. of animal  
and vegetable matter in a put rifled, s at. ,  
or a state ready for putrefaction ; in r­  
der to procure which, too much care can­  
not be observed in saving every material  
furnished by the farm. This resource  
was among the earliest discoveries cf men  
living by agriculture ; and a proper use  
of it has been made a test of good hus­  
bandry, in all countries, ancient and mo­  
dern, where its principles and profits have  
been studied.  
Some farmers of distinction headed by  
Tull, supposed that mere earth, in a pul­  
verized state, was sufficient without ma­  
nure for the growth cf plants ; and con­  
sequently that continued pulverization  
would render the soil perpetually produc­  
tive; a theory, which never would have  
occurred to a planter of tobacco or of In  
dian corn, who finds the soil annually  
producing less and less, under a constant  
pulverizing course. The known experi­  
ment of Van Helmontseemed to favor the  
opposite theory that tne earth parted  
with nothing towards the plants growing  
on it. If there were no illusion in tlie  
case, the earth used by him must at least  
have wen destitute of vegetable mould :  
for in an experiment by AVoodhouse, a  
garcen mould was diminished in its weight  
by a plant which grew in iu And the la­  
test chemical examinations of the subject  
coincide with the general opinion of prac­  
tical husbandmen, that the substance of  
plants partakes of the substance of the  
soil.

As this peculiar faculty gives to man a pre-eml-  
nence over irrational animals, so it is the use made  
of it by some, and the neglect of it by other com-  
munities, that distinguish them from each other, in  
the most important features of the human charac-  
ter.  
  
The contrast between the enlightened and refin-  
éd nations on some parts of the earth, and the rude  
and wretched tribes on others, has its foundation  
in this distinction. Civilization is never seen with-  
out agriculture: nor has agriculture ever prevailed,  
where the civilized arts did not make their ap-  
pearance. | i)  
  
But closely as agriculture and civilization are  
  
allied, they do not keep pace with each other.  
There is probably a much higher state of agricul-  
ture in China and Japan, than in many other coun-  
‘tries far more advanced in the improvements of  
civilized life. It is surely no small reproach to  
the latter, that with so great a superiority in sci-  
ence, and in the fuller possession of the auxiliary  
aris, they should suffer themselves to be outstrip-  
ped in the very art by which both are essentially  
distinguished from the brute creation.  
  
It must not be inferred however from the capa-  
cities and the motives of man, for an artificial in-  
crease of the productions of the earth, that the  
transition from the hunter, or even the herdsman’s  
siate, to the agricultural, is a matter of course.  
The first steps in this trensition are attended with  
difficulty; and what is more, with disinclination.  
  
Without a knowledge of the metals, and the  
implements made of them, the process of opening  
and stirrmg the soil, is not an easy operation;  
though one perhaps not requiring more effort and  
contrivance, than produced the instruments used  
by savages in war and in the chase.  
  
And that there is a disinclination in human na-  
ture to exchange the savage for the civilized life,  
cannot be questioned—We need not look for proofs  
beyond our own neighborhood. ‘The Indian tribes  
have ever shewn an aversion to the change. Nei-  
ther the persuasive examp!es of plenty and comfort  
derived from the culture of the earth by their white  
brethren, nor the lessons and specimens of tillage  
placed in the midst of them, and seconded by ac-  
tual sufferings from a deficient and precarious  
subsistence, have converted them from their strong  
propensities and habitual pursuiis. In the same  
spirit, they always betray an anxious disposition  
to return to their pristine life, after being weaned  
from it by time, and apparentiy moulded by intel-  
lectual and moral insiruction, into the habits and  
tastes of an agricultural people. A still more  
conclusive evidence of the bias of human natureis  
secn in the familiar fact, that our own people, nurs-  
ed and reared in these habits and tastes, easily shde  
into these ofahe savage, and are rarely rechaimed  
to civilized society with their own consent.  
  
Had the Europeans, on their arrival, found this  
continent destitute of human inhabitants, whose  
dangerous neighberhood kept them in a compact  
and agricultural state, and had their communica.  
tion with the countries they left been ciscontiau-  
ed, they might have spreal themselves ieto the  
forests where game and fruits would have abound.

a  
  
  
  
cessury to their immediate wants, have degenerat-  
ed into savage tribes. &#x27;  
  
An admired historian,* in his enquiry into the  
orizin of the American savages, represents any  
such degeneracy as impossible. He lays it down  
as a certain principle that thenecessary arts of life,  
whence once introduced among a people, can never  
be lost; that the dominion over inferior animals once  
enjoyed, will never be abandoned; and that Ameri-  
cx, consequently, must have been peopled from a  
country as uncivilized as itself. Yet he derives  
the American savages, generally, from the Tartars,  
whose example must have taught them the use of  
certain animals, for which a substitute might have  
been found in the bison or buffalo at least, (the  
same animal with the cow,) if not in the elk, the  
moose, or the Caraboo: and he regards the Esqui-  
maux, a tribe distinguished, in several respects,  
for their rude condition, as descendants from the  
Greenlanders, (of the same modes of life with  
themsclves,) who were a colony from Norway,  
planted in the ninth century; an epoch prior to  
which the Norwegians had made such progress in  
the arts, as to be capable of formidable maritime  
expeditions. The Greenland colony, therefore,  
must have undergone a degeneracy from the con-  
dition of its parent country. Without supposing  
the possibility of a transition from a better state of  
human society toa savage state, how would the  
learned historian have accounted for the introduc.  
tion of the savage state at all?  
  
The bent of human nature may be traced on the  
chart of our country. The manufacturer readily ex-  
changes the loom for the plough, in opposition  
often to his own interest, as well as to that of his  
country. The cultivator, in situations presenting  
an option, to the labors of the field, the more  
easy employment of rearing a herd. And as the  
game of the forest is approached, the bunting life  
displays the force of its attractions. Where do  
we behold a march to the opposite direction? the  
hunter, becoming the herdsman; the latter a follow-  
er of the plough; and the last repairing to the ma-  
nufactory or workshop.  
  
_ Such, indeed, is the fascination of that personal  
independence which belongs to the uncivilized  
state, and such the disrelish and contempt of the  
monotonous labor of tillage, compared with the  
exciting occupations of the chase, or with the indo-  
lence enjoyed by those who subsist chiefly on the  
mere bounties of nature, or on their migratory  
flocks, that a voluntarily relinquishment of these  
latter modes of life, is little to be expected. We  
certainly perceive nothing in the character of our  
  
Savage neighbors, from which it could be inferred  
  
that even the germs of agriculture, observed in  
their spots of maize, and a few other cultivated  
plants, would ever be developed into the extent  
implied by an agricultural life. To that little re-.  
source, combined with the game furnished by the  
forest and by the lake or the stream, their popula-  
tion and habits are adjusted. There may be said,  
in fact, to be a plenum of the former; because it is  
commensurate with their food, and this cannot be  
incréased without a change of habits, which being  
  
—  
  
Phenicia and Egypt into Greece, and from Greece  
herself among her savage neighbors, the revolution  
has proceeded from some individual, whose singu-  
lar endowments, and supernatural pretensions, had  
given him an ascendency for the purpose. All  
me PS ghiage reformers, in ancient times, were re-  
garded as more than men, and ultimately worship-  
ped as gods. A very remarkable example, of mo-  
dern date, is found in the revolution from the sa-  
vage to the agricultural state, said to have been  
brought about by Manco Capac among the Peru-  
vians, to whom he represented himself as the off-  
spring of the sun.  
  
Agriculture, once effectually commenced, may  
proceed of itself, under impulses of its own crea-  
tion. The mouths fed by it increasing, and the  
supplies of nature decreasing, necessity becomes a  
spur to industry; which finds another spur in the  
the advantages incident to the acquisition of pro-  
perty, in the civilized state. And thus a pro-  
gressive agriculture, and a progressive population  
ensue.  
  
But although no determinate limit presents itself  
to the increase of food, and. to a population com-  
mensurate with it, other than the limited produc-  
tiveness of the earth itself, we can scarcely be war-  
ranted in supposing that all the productive powers  
of its surface can be made subservient to the use  
of man, in exclusion of all the plants and animals  
not entering into his stock of subsistence; that all  
the elements and combinations of elements in the  
earth, the atmosphere, and the water, which now  
support such various and such numerous descrip-  
tions of created beings, animate and inanimate,  
could be withdrawn from that general destination,  
and appropriated to the exclusive support and in-  
crease of the human part of the creat:on; so that the  
whole habitable earth should be as full of people,  
as the spots most crowded now are of might be  
made, and as destitute as those spots, of the plants  
and animals not used by man.  
  
The supposition cannot well be reconciled with  
‘that symmetry in the face of nature, which derives  
new beauty from every insight that can be gained  
into it. It is forbidden also by the principles and  
laws which operate in various departments of her  
economy, falling within the scope of common ob-  
servation, as well as within that of philosophic re-  
searches.  
  
The earth contains not less than thirty or forty  
thousand kinds of plants; not less than six or seven  
hundred of birds; nor less than three or four hun-  
dred of quadrupeds; to say nothing of the thousand  
species of fishes. Of reptiles and insects, there  
are more than can be numbered. To all these must  
be added, the swarms and varieties of animalcules  
and minute vegetables not visible to the natural  
eye, but whose existence is probably connected  
with that of visible animals and plants.  
  
On comparing this vast profusion and multipli-  
city of beings with the few grains and grasses, the  
few herbs and roots, and the few fowls and quad-  
rupeds, which make up the shori list adapted to  
the wants of man, it is difficult to believe that it  
lies with him, so to remodel the work of nature as

and which consequently may be wholly appropfia-  
ted to the one or few plants best fitted for human  
use. : :  
  
Whether the food or constituent matter of ve-  
getables, be furnished from the earth, the airor  
water; and whether directly, or by either, through  
the medium of the others, no sufficient ground ap-  
pears for the inference that the food for all is the  
same.  
  
Different plants require different soils; some  
flourishing in sandy, some in clayey, some in moist,  
some in dry soils; some in warm, some in cold si-  
tuations. Many grow only in water—and a few  
subsist in the atmosphere. The forms, the tex-  
tures, and the qualities of plants, are still more  
diversified. That things so various and dissimilar  
in their organization, their constitutions, and their  
characters, should be wholly nourished by, and con-.  
sist of precisely the same elements, requires more  
proof than has yet been offered.  
  
A case which has been relied on to prove that  
different foods are not necessary for different plants,  
is that of grafting or inoculating one kind of plant  
on another kind; the sap obtained by the stock for  
itself, being found to feed and perfect the graft.  
But this operation has its limits. It does not ex-  
tend beyond plants having a certain affinity. The  
apple tree may be planted on the pear or quince.  
It will not succeed on the peach or the cherry. If  
the cases prove that the same food suffices for the  
apple andthe pear, they equally prove that differ.  
ent foods are required for the apple and peach. It  
is said, even that the fruit from the peach, graft on  
the almond, is not precisely the same with that  
from a peach graft on a plum.  
  
It may be offered as another argument to the  
same effect, that all animal and vegetable decom-  
positions answer indiscriminately as manures. The  
fact is not percisely so. Certain manures succeed  
best with certain plants. It is true, nevertheless,  
that animal and vegetable substances, in a decom-  
posed state, are, generally, mauures for plants.  
Fish even, an animal from the water, is successful-  
ly used as a manure for Indian corn and other crops.  
But this and similar examples prove only that some  
ingredients are the same in all animals and plants;  
not that all the ingredients in each are the same.  
  
The chemist, though as yeta fellow student, as  
much as a preceptor of the agriculturist, justly  
claims attention to the result of his processes.  
From that source we learn that the number of  
known elements, not yet decomposable, is between  
forty and fifty; that about seven or eight belong to  
the organs of plants; that different elements enter  
into the composition of the same plant; and that  
—_ are combined in different numbers and in  
different proportions, in different plants. Suppos.  
ing then, as must be supposed, that these diferent  
elements, in their actual quantities and propor.  
tions, are adapted to the quantities and the pro-.  
portions of the existing varieties of plants, it  
would happen, in so great a change as that in ques-  
tion, with respect to the number and variety of  
plants, thatthe quantities and the proportions of  
the elements would not be adapted to the parti-  
cular kinds and numbers of plants retained by man  
for his own use. Like the types of the alphabet,  
apportioned to the words composing a purticular,  
book, when applied to another book materially dif:  
ferent in its contents, there would be of some a de-  
heiency, of others a useless surplus.  
  
Were it less difficult to edmit that all the sour-  
ces of productiveness could be exclusively appro-  
priated to the food of man, is it certain that an  
  
  
  
Sees om  
  
  
  
  
  
obstacle tohis indefinite multiplication would not  
be encountered in one of the relations between the  
atmosphere and organized beings?  
  
Animals, including man, and plants may be re-  
garded as the most important part of the terrestrial  
creation. They are pre-eminent in their atiributes;  
and all nature teems with their varieties and their  
multitudes, visible and invisible. To all of them  
the atmosphere is the breath of life. Deprived of  
it, they all equally perish. But it answers this  
Purpose by virtue of its appropriate constitution  
and character. What are these?  
  
The atmosphere is not a simple but a compound  
body. In its least compound state, it is understood  
to contain, besides what is called vital air, others  
noxious in themselves, yet without a portion of  
which, the vital air becomes noxious. But the at-  
mosphere in its natural state, and in its ordinary  
communication with the organized world, compri-  
8s various ingredients or modifications of ingre-  
dients, derived from the use made of it, by the ex-  
isting variety of animals and plants. The exhala-  
tions and perspirations, the effluvia and transpira-  
tions of these, are continually charging the atmos-  
phere with a heterogeneous variety and immense  
quantity of matter, which together must contri -  
bute to the character which fits it for its destined  
Purpose of supporting the life and health of orga-  
nized beings. Is it unreasonable to suppose, that  
if, instead of the actual composition and character  
of the animal and vegetable creation, to which the  
atmosphere is now accomodated, such a composi-  
tion and character of that creation were substi-  
tuted, as would result from a reduction of the  
whole to man and a few kinds of animals and plants,  
is the supposition unreasonable, that the chunge  
might essentially affect the aptitude of the atmos-  
phere for the functions required of it; and that se  
great an innovation might be found, in this res.  
pect, not to accord with the order and economy of  
nature?  
  
The relation of the animal part and the vegetable  
part of the creation to each other, through the me-  
dium of the atmosphere, comes in aid of the re-  
flection suggested by the general relation between  
the atmosphere and both. It seems to be now well  
understood, that the atmosphere, when respired by  
animals, becomes unfitted for their further use,  
and fitted for the absorption of vegetables; and  
that when evolved by the latter, it is refitted for  
the respiration uf the former: an interchange be-  
ing thus kept up, by which this breath of life is re-  
ceived by each, in a wholesome state, in return for  
it in an unwholesome one. |  
  
May it not be concluded from this admirable ar-  
rangement and beautiful feature in the economy of  
nature, that if the whole class of animals were ex-  
tinguished, the use of the atmosphere by the veyre.  
table class alone would ex&#x27;iaust it of its life-sup-  
porting power; that, in like manner, if the whole  
class of vegetables were exting:ushed, the use of  
it by the animal class, alone, would deprive it of  
its fitness for their support? And if such would be  
the effect of an entire destruction of either class,  
in relation to the other, the inference seems to  
press itself upon us, that so vast a change in the  
proportions of each class to the other, and in the  
species composing the respective Classes, as that  
in question, might not be compatible with the con-  
tinued existence and health of the remaining spe-  
cies of the two classes.  
  
The immensity of the atmosphere, compared  
with the mass of animals and vegetables, forms an  
  
  
  
apparent objection only to this view ofthe subject.

The comparison could at most suggest questions  
as to the period of time neceesary. to exhaust the  
atmosphere of its unrenewed capacity to keep alive  
ayimal or vegetable nature, when deprived, either,  
of the support of the other. And this period con-  
tracis itself at once to the imagination, when it is  
recollected that the immensity of the atmosphere  
is the effect of its elasticity and rarefaction. We  
know from the barometer, that condensed to the  
specific gravity of mercury, its rise above the sur-  
face of ihe earth would be but about thirty inches;  
and from the well pump, that condensed to the spe-  
cifie gravity only of water, which is nearly the  
same with tat of the human body, its rise would  
be little more than as many feet; thatis, a little  
more than five times the human stature. It is  
found that a single human person, employs in re-  
spiration not less than sixteen or eighteen times his  
own weight of common sir, in every twenty-four  
hours. In different degrees, some greater, some  
less, the case is the same with most other animals.  
Plan.s makea correspondent use of air for their  
purposes ;  
  
Other views of the economy of nature coincide  
with the preceding. There is a known tendency  
in all organized beings to multiply beyond the de.  
gree necessiry to keep up their actual numbers. It  
is a wise provision of nature:—1, to guard against  
the failure of the species: 2, to afford, in the sur-  
pius, a food for animals whether subsisting on ve-  
gretabies, vron other antinsls which subsist on ve-  
yetables. Nature has been equally provident in  
gttrrding against an excessive multiplication of any  
one species which might too far encroach on  
others, by subjecting each, when unduly multiply-  
ing itself, to be arrested in its progress by the ef-  
fect of the multiplication:—1, in producing a defi.  
ciercy of food; and where that may not happen, 2,  
in producing a state of the atmosphere unfavora-  
ble to life and health. Alf animals «s well as plants  
sicken and di¢ in a state too much crowded. It is  
the case with our domestic animals of every sort,  
where no scarcity of food can be the cause. To  
the same laws mankind are equally subject. An  
jucrease, not consisting with the general plan of  
nature, arrests itself. According to the degree in  
which the number thrown together exceeds the due  
proportion of space and air, disease and mortality  
eusue. It was the vitiated air alone which put out  
human life in the crowded hole of Calcutta. Ina  
gpace somewhat enlarged, the effect would have  
heen siower, but not Jess certain. In all confined  
situations, from the dungeon to the crowded work-  
houses, and from these to the compact population  
of overgrown cities, the atmosphere becomes, in  
correspording degrees, unfitted by reiterated use,  
for sustammg human life and health: Were the  
wimosphere breathed in cities not diluted and dis-  
placed by fresh supplies from the surrounding  
coun ry, the mortality would soon become general.  
Were the surrounding country thickly peopled and  
no* tefresied in like manner, the decay of health,  
t.euzvh a later, would be a necessary consequence.  
And were the whole habitable eari covered with  
a dense population, wasteful maladies might be  
lovked for, that would thin the numbers into a  
heaktiy proportion.  
  
Were the earth in every productive spot, and in  
every spot capable of being made productive, ap-  
propriaved to the food of win; were the spade sub.  
sti.uted for the plough, and ailanimals consuming  
ine fool of man, or food for which buman food  
rai of be substituced banished from existence, so  
ag iv produce the maxunum of populatica on the  
  
  
  
earth, there would be more than an hundred indi--  
viduals for every one now upon it. In the actual  
population of many countries, it brings on occasion-  
al epidemics, to be traced to no other origin than  
the state of the atmosphere. Increase the num-  
bers ten or twenty fold, and can, it be. supposed  
that they would at any time find the breath of life  
in acondition to support it: or if that supposition  
be admissable when limited toa single country,  
can it be admitted, when not only the contiguous  
countries, but the whole earth, was equally crowd-  
  
ed?  
  
Must we then adopt the opinion entertained by  
some philosophers, that no variation whatever in  
the numbers and proportions of the organized be-  
ings belonging to our globe, is permitted by the  
system of nature; that the number of spécies and  
of individuals, in the animal and végetable empires,  
siee they attained a destined complement, has  
been, and must always be, the same; that the only  
change possible, is in local augmentations and di-  
minutions which balance each other, and thus main-  
tain the established and unalterable order of  
things?  
  
This would be the opposite extreme to that,  
which has been rejected. Man, though so similar  
in his physical constitution to many other animals,  
is essentially distinguished from all other organiz-  
ed beings, by the intellectual and moral powers  
with which he is endowed. He possesses a reason  
and a will, by which he canact on matter organized  
and unorganized. He can, by the exercise of these  
peculiar powers, increase his subsistence, by which  
his numbers may be increased beyond the sponta-  
neous supplies of nature; and it would be a reason-  
able conclusion, that making, as he does, in his ca-  
pacity of an intelligent and voluntary agent, an in-  
tegral part of the terrestrial system, the other parts  
of the system are so framed as not to be altogether  
et fii of his agency, and unpliable to its ef-  
  
ects.  
  
This reasonable conclusion is confirmed by the  
fact, that the capacity of man, derived from his-rea-  
son and his will, has effected an increase of parti-  
cular plants and animals conducive to an increase  
of his own race; and adiminution of the numbers, if  
not of the species, of plants and animals displaced  
by that increase. ,  
  
Most, if not all, our domesticated snimals proba-  
bly exceed the numbers which, without the inter-  
vention of man, would be their natural amount;  
whilst the animals preying on, or interfering with  
them, are proportionally reduced in their numbers.  
  
The case is the same with cultivated plants.—  
They are increased beyond their natural amount;  
and banish or proportionally reduce such as inter-  
fere with them,  
  
Nor can it be said that these changes, made by  
human art and industry in some regions, are balanc-  
ed by corresponding changes made by nature, in  
other regions. Take for examples, the articles of  
wheat, rice, millet and maize, which are the chief  
food of civilized, man; and which are now spread  
over such immense spaces. It is not possible to  
regard them, as occupying no more then their ort-  
ginal and fixed proportions of the earth; and that in  
other parts of it, they have disappeared in the same  
degree in which they are thus artificially extended.  
  
‘These grains belong to the torrid-and temperate  
  
zoires only; and so great a portion of these zones  
have been explored, that itis certain, they could  
not have been cisplaced from other parts of the  
globe, in the degree in which they abound where  
they are now cultivated, end where it 1s certain

they owe their abundance to cultivation. There  
must consequently be an absolute increase of them  
produced by the agency of man. 5  
  
Take more particularly for an example, the arti-  
cle of rice, which constitutes so large a portion of  
human food, The latitudes to which its growth 1s  
limited by the nature of the plant, are for the most  
part so well known, that it may be assumed for an  
unquestionable fact, that this grain cannot always:  
have prevailed any where, in the extent in which it  
is now cultivated. And it is equally certain, that  
the vegetable productions belonging to the same  
climates, which must have been displaced by its  
cultivation, have not received an equivalent intro-  
duction and extension elsewhere.  
  
It is remarkable that the vegetable productions,  
most extensively used as human food, are but little  
if at all found in there indigenous state; whether  
that state be the same as their present one, or a  
state from which they were improveable into their  
present state. They seem indeed not likely to  
fiourish extensively in situations not prepared by  
the hand of man. The potatoe, so recently brought  
into use, and now spreading itself over so great a  
surface, can barely be traced to a native state in  
the mountains of Chili; nor can it be believed that  
previous to its adoption by man, it ever existed in  
the extent to which cultivation is now carrying it.  
  
These views of the subject seerg to authorize the  
conclusion, that although their is a proportion be- |  
tween the animal and vegetable classes of beings  
on our globe, and between the species in each class,  
with respect to which nature does not permit such  
a change as would result from a destruction of the  
animals and vegetables not used by man; anda  
multiplication of the human race, and of the seve-  
ral species of animals and vegetables used by it,  
sufficient to fill up the void; yet that there js a de-  
gree of change which the peculiar faculties of  
man enable him to make, and by making which  
his fund of subsistence, and his numbers may be  
augmented; there being at the same time, when-  
ever his numbers, and the change, exceed the ad-  
mitted degree, a tendency in that excess to correct  
itself.  
  
Could it however be supposed that the establish -  
ed system and symmetry of nature required the  
number of human beings on the globe to be always  
the same; tMat the only change permitted in rela-  
tion to them, was in their distribution over it, stil]  
as the blessing of existence to that number would  
materially depend on the parts of the globe on  
which they may be thrown; on the degree in which  
their situation may be convenient or crowded;  
and on the nature of their political and social in-  
stitutions, motives would not be wanting to obtain  
for our portion of the earth its fullest share, by  
improving the resources of human subsistence, ac-  
cording to the fair measure of its capacity—For, in  
what other portion of equal extent will be found  
climates more friendly to the health, or conge-  
nial to the feelings of its inhabitants? In what  
other, a soil yielding more food with not more  
Jabor? And above all, where will be found institu-  
tions equally securing the blessings of personal in-  
dependence, and of social enjoyments? The envia-  
ble condition of the people of the United States is  
often too much ascribed to the physical advantages  
of their soil and climate, and to their uncrowd-  
ed situation. Much is certainly due to these causes  
  
—but a just estimate of the happiness of our coun  
try, will never overlook what belongs to the fertile  
activity of a free people, and  
  
the benign influence  
  
  
  
of a responsible government:  
  
  
  
In proportion as we relax the hypothesis which’  
makes the aggregate number of mankind unsuscep-  
tible of change, and believe that the.resources of  
our country may not only contribute to the greater  
happiness of a given number, but to the augmenta-  
tion of the number enjoying a greater happiness,  
the motives become stronger for the improvement  
and extension of them. |  
  
But, whilst all are sensible that agriculture is  
the basis of population and prosperity, it cannot be_  
denied that the study and practice of its true prin-  
ciples have hitherto Been too generally neglected  
in the United States; and that this state has at least  
its full share of the blame. Now only, for the first  
time, notwithstanding several meritorious exam-  
ples of earlier date, a general attention seems to  
be awakened to the necessity of a reform. Patriotic  
societies, the best agents for effecting it, are pur-  
suing the object with the animation and intelligence  
which characterize the efforts of a self governed  
people, whatever be the objects to which they may  
be directed.  
  
Among these promising institutions, I cannot  
glance at all the names of those composing that of  
Albemarle, without being assured, that its full  
quota of information will be furnished to the gene-  
ral stock. I regret only, that my own competency  
bears so little proportion to my wishes to co-ope-  
rate with them. That I may not be thought,  
however, deficient in good will, as well as in other  
requisites, I shall venture on the task, a task the  
least difficult, of pointing ott some of the most  
prevalent errors in our husbandry, and which ap-  
pear to be among those which may merit the atten-  
tion of the society, and the instructive examples  
of its members.  
  
I. The error first to be noticed is that of culti-  
vating land, either naturally poor or impoverished  
by cultivation. This error, like many others, is  
the effect of habit, continued after the reason for  
  
it has failed. Whilst there was an abundance of  
  
fresh and fertile soil, it was the interest of the cul-  
tivator to spread his labor over as great a surface  
as he could. Land being cheap and labor dear,  
and the land co-operating powerfully with the la-  
bor, it was profitable to draw as much as possible  
from the land. Labor is now comparatively cheap-  
er and land dearer. Where labor has risen in price  
fourfold land has risen tenfold. It might be profit-  
able, therefore, now to contract the surface over  
which labor is spread, even if the soil retained its  
freshness and fertility. But this is not the case.  
Much of the fertile soil is exhausted, and unfertile  
soils are brought into cultivation; and both co-  
operating less with labor in prolucing the crop, it  
is necessary to consider how far labor can be profit-  
ably exerted on them; whether it ought not to be  
applied towards making them fertile, rather than  
in further impoverishing them, or whether it might  
not be more profitably applied to mechanical occu-  
pations, or to domestic manuf.ctures?  
  
In the old countries of Europe, where labor is  
cheap and land dear, the object is to augment la-  
bor, and contract the space on which it is employ-  
ed. In the new settlements taking place in this  
country, the original practice here may be rational-  
ly pursued. In the old settlements, the reason for  
the practice in Europe is becoming daily less inap-  
plicable; and we ought to yield to the changé of  
circumstances, by forbearing to waste our labor on  
land which, besides not paying for it, is sill more  
impoverished, and rendered more difficult to be  
made rich. The crop which is of leas amount,  
gives the blow most mortal to the soil. It has no:

been.a very rare thing to see land under the plough,  
not producing enough to feed the ploughman and  
his horse; and jit is in such cases that the death  
blow is given. The goose is killed, without even  
obtaining the coveted egg.  
  
There cannot be a more rational principle in  
the code of agricul‘ ure, than that every farm which  
is in good heart should be kept so; that every one  
not in good heart should be made so; and that what  
is right as to the farm, generally, is so as to every  
part of every farm. Any system therefore, or want  
of system, which tends to make a rich farm poor,  
or does not tend to make a poor farm rich, cannot  
be good for the owner; whatever it may be for the  
tenant or superintendant, who has transient inte-  
rest only in it. The profit, where there is any, will  
not balance the loss of intrinsic value sustained by  
the land. ;  
  
Il. The evil of pressing tog hard upon the land,  
has also been much increased by the bad mode of  
ploughing it. Shallow ploughing, and ploughing  
up and down hilly land, have, by exposing the  
loosened soil to be carried off by rains, hastened  
more than any thing else, the waste of its fertility.  
When the mere surface is pulverized, moderate  
rains on land but little uneven, if ploughed up and  
down, gradually wear it away. And heavy rains  
on hilly land, ploughed in that manner, soon pro-  
duce a like effect, notwithstanding the improved  
practice of deeper ploughing. How have the beau-  
ty and value of this red ridge of country suffered  
from this cause? And how much is due to the  
happy improvement introduced by a member of  
this society, whom I need nat name,* by a cultiva-  
tion in horizontal drills with a plough adapted to  
it? Had the practice prevailed from the first set-  
tlement of the country, the general fertility would  
have been more than the double of what the red  
hills, and indeed all other hilly lands, now possess;  
and the scars and sores now defacing them would  
no where be seen.—Happily, experience is proving  
that this remedy, aided by a more,rational manage-  
ment in other respects, is adequate to the purpose  
of healing what has been wounded, as well as of  
  
reserving the health of what has escaped the ca-  
  
amity. It is truly gratifying to observe how fast  
the improvement is spreading from the parent ex-  
ample. ‘The value of our red hills, under a mode  
of cultivation which guards their fertility against  
wasting rains, is probably exceeded by that of no  
uplands whateyer; and without that advantage  
they are exceeded in valye by almost all others.  
They are little more than a lease for years.  
  
Besides the inestimable advantage from horizon-  
tal ploughing, in protecting the soil agajnst the  
wasting effect of rains, there is a great one in its  
preventing the rains themselves from being lost to  
the crop. The Indian corn is the crop which most  
exposes the sail to be carried off by the rains; and  
it is at the same time the crop which most needs  
them. Where the land is not only hilly, but the soil  
thirsty, (as is the case particularly throughout this  
mountainous range, ) the preservation of the rain as  
it falls, between the drilled ridges, is of peculiar  
importance; and its gradual settling downwards to  
the roots, is the best possible mode of supplying  
them with moisture. In theold method of plougb-  
ing shallow,, with the furrows yp and down, the  
rain as well as the soil was lost.  
  
Ill. The neglect of manures is another error  
which claims particular notice. It may be traced  
to the same cause with our excessive cropping. In

the early stages of our agriculture, it was more  
convenient, and more profitable, to bring new land  
  
into cultivation, than to improve exhausted land.  
The failure of new land has long called for the im-  
  
provement of old land; but habit has kept us deaf  
to the cal],  
  
Nothing is more certain than that continual crop-  
ping without manure, deprives the soil of its ferti-  
lity. It is equally certain that fertility may be pre-  
served or restored, by giving to the earth animal  
or vegetable manure equivalent to the matter ta-  
ken from it; and that a perpetual fertility is not, in  
itself, incompatible with an uninterrupted succes-  
sion of crops. The Chinese, it is said, smile at the  
idea, that land needs rest, as if like animals it had  
a sense of fatigue. Their soil does not need rest,  
because an industrious use is made of every ferti-  
lizing particle that can contribute towards replac-  
ing what has been drawn from it. And thisis the  
more practicable with them, as almost the whole of  
what is grown on their farms is consumed within  
them. That a restoration to the earth of ali that  
annually growson it, prevents its impoverishment,  
is sufficiently seen in our forests, where the annu-  
al exuviz of the trees and plants replace the fer-  
tility of which they deprive the earth. Where  
frequent fires destroy the leaves and whatever else  
is annually dropped on the earth, it is well known  
that the land becomes poorer: this destruction of  
the natural crop, having the same impoverishing  
effect, aga removal of a cultivated crop. A still  
stronger proof that an annual restoration to the  
earth of all its annual product will perpetuate its  
productiveness, is seen where our fields are left  
uncultivated and unpastured. In this case the  
soil, receiving from the decay of the spontaneous  
weeds and grasses more fertility than they extract  
from it, is for a time at least improved, not impo-  
verished. Its improvement may be explained, by  
the fertilizing matter which the weeds and grasses  
derive from water and the atmosphere, which forms  
anett gain to the earth. At what point, or from  
what cause, the formation and accumulation of ve-  
getable mould from this gain ceases, is not per-  
haps very easy tobe explained. That it does  
cease, is proved by the stationary condition of the  
surface of the earth in old forests; and that the  
amount of the accumulation varies with the nature  
of the subjacent earth, is equally certain. It  
seems to depend also on the species of trees and  
plants which happen to contribute the materials  
for the vegetable mould.  
  
But the most eligible mode of preserving the  
richness, and of enriching the poverty of a farm, is  
certainly that of applying to the soil a sufficiency  
of animal and vegetable matter in a putrified state  
or a state ready for putrefaction; in order to pro-  
cure which, too much care cannot be observed in  
saving every material furnished by the farm. This  
resource was among the earliest discoveries of men  
living by agriculture; and a proper use of it has  
been made a test of good husbandry, in all coun-  
tries, ancient and modern, where its principles and  
profits have been studied.  
  
Some farmers of distinction, headed by Tull, sup-  
posed that mereearth, in a pulverized state, was  
sufficient without manure for the growth of plants;  
and consequently that coatinued pulverization  
would render the soil perpetually productive; a  
theory which never would have occurred to a plan-  
ter of tobacco or of Indian corn, who finds the  
soil annually producing less and less, under a con-  
stant pulyerizing course. The known expefiment  
of Van Helmont seemed to favor the opposite theo-

ry, that the earth parted with nothing towards the  
plants growing on it. If there were no illusion in  
the case, the earth used by him must at least have  
been destitute of vegetable mould: for in an ex-  
periment by Woodhouse, a garden mould was di-  
minished in its weight by a plant which grew in it.  
And the latest chemical examinations of the sub-  
ject coincide with the general opinion of practical  
  
usbandmen, that the substance of plants partakes  
of the substance of the soil.  
  
The idea is indeed very natural that vegetable  
matter which springs from the eafth, and of itself  
returns to the earth, should be one source at least  
of the earth’s capacity to reproduce vegetable mat-  
ter. ,  
  
It has been asked, how it happens that Egypt  
and Sicily, which have for ages been exporting their  
agricultural produce, without a retucn of any equi-  
valent produce, have not lost their reproductive  
capacity. One answer has been, that they have  
lost no small degree of it. If the fact be other-  
wise with regard to Egypt, it might be accounted  
for by the fertilizing inundations of the Nile. With  
regard to Sicily, there may be something in the sys-  
tem of husbandry, or some particular local circum-  
stances, which counteryail the continued asporta-  
tion of the fruits of the soil. But it is far more  
probable, that the Island is less productive than it  
once was. It is certainly less of a granary for other  
countries now, than it was when it received that  
title from the ancient Romans.—And its population  
being diminished, the internal consumption must  
also be diminished, If a single farm is rendered  
less productive by a continued removal of its crops,  
without any adequate returns, no reason occurs  
why it should not happen toa number of farms  
multiplied to the extent of a whole country.  
  
And that individual farms do lose their fertility,  
in proportion as crops are taken from them, and re-  
turns of manure neglected, is a fact not likely to be  
questioned.  
  
If it were, Virginia, unfortunately, is but too ca-  
pable of furnishing the proofs. Her prevailing  
crops have been very exhausting, and the use of  
manures has ben particularly neglected.  
  
Tobacco and Indian corn, which for a long time,  
on the east side of the Blue Mountains, were the  
articles almost exclusively cultivated, and which  
continue to be cultivated, the former extensively,  
the latter universally, are known to be great im-  
poverishers of the soil. Wheat, which has for a  
number of years, formed a large portion of the  
general crop, is also an exhausting crop. So are  
rye and oats, which enter occasionally into our  
farming system.  
  
With so many consumers of the fertility of the  
earth, and so little attention to the means of re-  
pairing their ravages, no one can be surprized at  
the impoverished face of the country; whilst every  
one ought to be desirous of aiding in the work of  
reformation.  
  
The first main step towards it, is to make the  
thieves restore as much as possible of the stolen  
fertility. On this, with other improvements which  
may be made in our husbandry, we must depend  
for the rescue of our farms from their present de-  
graded condition. :  
  
Of tobacco nota great deal more than one half  
of the entire plant is carried to market. The resi-  
due is an item on the list of manures; and it is  
known to be in its quality avery rich one, ‘The  
crop of tobacco, however, though of great value,  
covers buta small proportion of our cultivated  
ground; and its offal can, of course, contribute but  
  
  
  
inconsiderably to the general stock of manure. It  
is probable also, that what it does contribute, has  
been more carefully used as a manure, than any  
other article furnished by our crops.  
  
The article which constitutes our principal ma-  
nure, is wheat straw. It is of much importance,  
theretore, to decide a right on the mode of using  
it. There are three modes:—1. Carrying it from  
the farm yard, after having passed through, or be-  
ing trodden and enriched by cattle. In that mode,  
the greater part of it must be used, ifused at all;  
the straw going thro’ that process, being a neces-  
sary part of the food: allotted to the-cattle. To  
derive the full advantage from it, it ought ‘o be  
hauled out before the substance has been wasted by  
rain, by the sun, and by the wind; and to be buried  
in the earth as soon after as possible. 2.Spreading  
the straw dn the surface of the ground. Many  
respectable farmers are attached to this mode, as  
protecting the soil from the sun; and by keeping it  
moist, favoring the vegetation underneath, whether  
spontaneous or artificial; whilst the straw itseif is  
gradually decomposed into a manure. ‘lhe objec-  
tion to this mode, is the loss by evaporation, before  
this last effect is obtained. 3. Turning the straw  
at once under the surface of the earth. This would  
seemto be the best mode of managing manures  
generally; least of their substance being then lost.  
When the grain is trodden out from the straw, it  
is left in a state easily admitting this operation.  
Some difficulty may attend it, when the grain is  
threshed from the straw, by the flail, or by the ma-  
chines now in use, neither of which break the straw  
sufficiently to pieces.  
  
It may be remarked with regard to this article  
of manure—1. That its weight is barely more than  
that of the grain.—2. That the grain is the part |  
which makes the greatest draft on the fertility of  
the earth. 3. That the grain is for the most part  
not consumed within the farm. It is found on trial  
that a stalk of wheat, as oor cut, including  
the chaff, and the grains borne by the stalk, are  
pretty nearly of equal weight. Thecase is proba-  
bly the same with rye, and not very different with  
oats. The proportion of fertilizing matter in the  
straw, to that in the grain, has not, as far as I know,  
been brought to any satisfactory test. It is, doubt-  
less, much less inthe straw, which alone, in the  
case of wheat, is with us returnable in any form to  
theearth. This consideration, whilst it urges us  
to make the most of the article as a manure, warns  
us of its insufficiency.  
  
The stubble, and the roots of the small grains,  
not being taken from the earth, may be regarded  
as elapsing into a fertility equal to that of which  
they deprived theearth. This remark is applicable  
to all cultivated plants, the roots of which are not  
an esculent part.  
  
An eminent citizen and celebrated agriculturist;  
of this state has, among other instructive lessons,  
called the public attention to the value of the corn  
stalk as a manure. I am persuaded that he has not  
overrated it, And it is a subject of agrecabie re-  
flection, that an article which is so extensively cul-  
tivated as that of Indian corn, and witich is so par-  
ticularly exhausting, should be the one so capable  
of repairing the injury it does. The cornstalk as  
a fodder is of great value. Not only the leaves,  
but the husk inclosing the ear, and the cob enclos-  
ed by it, are all more or less valuable food when  
duly preserved and dealt out tocattle. There is  
no better fodder than the leaves or blades for

horses and oxen; nor any so much approved for  
sheep, the husk or shruck is a highly nourishing  
food for neat cattle. And the pickings of the stock,  
even at a late season, and after much exposure to  
the weather, support them better than any of the  
straws. From the saccharine matter in the stock,  
which is long retained about the joints, it cannot  
be doubted that ifcut early, or before exposure to  
the weather, into parts small enough for masti¢a-  
tion, it would well repay, as a food for cattle, the  
labor required for it.  
  
The great value of the cornstalk, in.all its parts,  
as a fodder, was brought into: full proof, by the  
use made of it, during the late general failure of  
crops. Itis to be hoped that the lesson will not be  
suffered to pass into oblivion.  
  
But it is asa resource for re-fertilizing the soil,  
that the cornstalk finds the proper place here; and  
as such it merits particular notice, whether it be  
passed through animals, or be prepared by fermen-  
tation in the farm yard; or be merely spread on the  
surface of the earth, the mode in which its effects  
must be least considerable. The same qualities  
which render every part of it nutricious to animals,  
render it nutricious to the earth; and it is accompa-  
panied with the peculiar advantages—1. That the  
grain itself is mostly every wherc, and altogether,  
in places distant from navigation, consumed within  
the farms producing it. 2. That as the grain is in  
- Geeaeh proportion to the space on which it grows  
than most other grains, so the rest of the plant is  
  
in greater proportion to the grain, than tke rest of  
any other grain-plant. The straw and chaff of the  
smaller grains, as already remarked, is in weight  
but aboyt one half of the grain. The cornstalk,  
with all its appurtenant offal, is of less than three  
times, and.if taken early from the field, probably  
of not jess than four or five times the weight of the  
grain belonging to it. 3. The fertilizing matter  
contained in the cornstalk is greater in proportion  
to its weight, than that contained in the straw and  
offal of other grains is to the weight of the straw  
and offal.  
Would it be hazarding too much to say, that  
» where a level surface, or the mode of cultivating a  
hilly one, preyents the rains from carrying of the  
soil, a restoration of an entire crop of Indian corn,  
in the form of manure, to the space producing it  
(there being no other intervening crop not so re-  
stored) wre.) replace the fertility consumed by the  
crop; and maintain a perpetual productiveness?—  
Reason, the case of forest and fallow fields, where  
the spontaneous crop falls back of itself on the  
earth, and the Chinese example, where the culti-  
vated crop is restored to the earth, all pronounce  
that such would be the effect. Amd yet the fact  
stares us in the face, that our most impoverished  
fields, even the most level of them, owe their con.  
dition more to the crops of Indian corn, than to any  
other crops. i oe  
The cotton plant, which is so extensive a crop, in  
the more southern and the south western states, js  
but little cultivated in Virginia, and scargely at all  
in this part of it. I am not able to say how far it  
is comparatively an exhausting crop. But it would  
seem to be more capab e t!:an any crop, not wholly  
consumed within the farm, of preserving its fertili-  
ty. The only part of the plant carried away, is  
the cotton fibre, or wooly part, which bears an in-  
considerable proportion to the other parts in.  
weigiit, anc, as may be inferred, in fertilizing mat-  
ter also. The seed alone, passing by the ball and  
  
haulm, is of three times its weight and contains the  
chief part of the oil in the plant. In the countries  
  
  
  
  
  
where cotton makes the principal part of the crop,  
the superfluous seed must deserve great attention  
as a manure. Where the fields are Jevel or culti-  
vated in horizontal drills, it might go far towards  
supporting a continued cropping, without a dimi-  
nished fertility. |  
  
The sum of these remarks on cultivating poor  
land, and neglecting the means of keeping or mak-  
ing land rich is, that if every thing grown on a  
soil is carried from it, it must become unproductive,  
that if every thing grown on it, be directly or indi-  
rectly restored to it, it would not cease tq be pro-  
ductive; and, consequently, that according to the  
degree in which the one or the other practice takes  
place, a farm must be impoverished, or be perma-  
nently productive and profitable. Every acre made  
by an improved management to produce as much  
as two acres, is in effect the addition of a new  
acre; with the great advantages, of contracting the  
space to be cultivated, and of shortening the dis-  
tance of transpotation between the fields, and the  
barn or the farm yard. One of the Roman writers*  
on husbandry, enforces the obtigation to an improy-  
1g management by a story of one Paridius, who  
had two daughters and a vineyard: when the elder  
was married, he gave her a third part of the vine-  
yard: notwithstanding which, he obtained from two  
thirds the same crop as from the whole: when his  
other daughter was married, he portioned her with  
the half of what remained, and still the produce of  
his vineyard was undiminished. The story, short  
as it 1s, contains a volume of instruction, ;  
  
The plaster of gypsum, though not a manure  
within the farm itself, has been too long neglected,  
as a fertilizing resource. It is now beginning to  
take a high and just rank as such. The proofs of  
its efficacy are as incontestible as the causes of it  
are obscure. The experiments of a very distin-  
guished chemistt led him to the opinion that its  
substance enters into the substance of the plant.  
Without doubting the fact, it does not sufficiently  
account for the addition made to the size and  
weight of the plant, which greatly exceed the  
quantity of the plaster. It must therefore have  
some further mode of operating. Whether it be  
by neutralizing some noxious ingredient in the  
earth, one of the modes by which lime is supposed  
to operate; or by attracting and conveying to the  
plant, food from the earth, the air, or water, or by  
exciting the plant to a more active use of its feed-  
ing powers, whatever they be; or by its accretion  
assimilation to the particular parts of plants on  
which these powers depend, thereby augmenting  
and strengthening those particular parts, and ena-  
bling the feeding powers to give proportional aug.  
mentation to every other part; whether by any one  
or more of these processes, or by some other or  
others distinct from them all, the growth of plants  
be promoted by this mineral, remains it would  
seem to be yet explained. In the mean time, a  
more extensive use of it promises much advantage  
to our agriculture. I take it, however, that this  
advantage cannot be permanent without making  
the increased product of the soil a source of ma-  
nure to the soil. That the effect of the plaster  
will be continued indefinitely, under q constant re-  
moval of the whole crop from the soil, surpasses  
belief. It gan scarcely fail to exhaust, at length,  
the preductive powers of the earth. ‘The period  
of time necessary for the purpose may be uncer-  
tain; but that, as in the case of the other mineral

manures, lime and marle, such must sooner or later  
  
be the result, cannot well-be so. The effect of  
pulverizing the earth by-tillage, as practised by  
‘Tull, is stated to have been uninterrupted crops of  
  
wheat, without manure, for more than twenty  
  
years; which was regarded as a demonstration that  
tillage was a complete substitute for manure.  
  
‘Supposing the statement to be free from error,  
the inference is certainly not warranted by the fact.  
  
We know that some of our soils not naturally ricker  
than the highly manured soils on which Tull proba-  
bly commenced his tillage, will bear a succession  
ef crops for an equal period; and we know as well,  
that their fertillity will not hold out forever. How  
long plaster, whatever be its mode of operatioa,  
will hold out, may not yet have been fully tried.  
But to.make it permanently successful, it will be  
wise totake for granted, that it must be madea  
source of future manure, as well as of immediate  
productiveness. If the crop, as augmented by the  
plaster, be given back to the soil, the soil may be  
benefited more than it would be, by the return of a  
crop not augmented by the plaster. And in fhis  
way fertility may be accelerated. The restoration  
of a crop, increased by ordinary cultivation, to the  
soil on which it grew, would, I presume, fertilize  
it more than the restoration of a smaller crop spon.  
taneously produced; although in both cases, the  
whole taken from the soil would return to it.  
  
1V. Among the means of aiding the productive-  
ness of the soil, which have not received me-  
rited attention, is irrigation. In scareely any  
country does this resource abound more than  
in the United States; nor is there any, where  
there is so little sensibility to its value. The  
inconsiderable use made of it is chiefly by emi-  
grants, particularly Germans, or the immediate  
descendants of them. I have understood that the  
market of Baltimore has been much benefited in  
dry seasons by the irrigation introduced by exiles  
from St. Domingo. For a distinguished proof of  
the importance of the practice, I may refer to the  
fact which has been stated, that in the neighbor-  
hood of Barcelona in Spain, where a part of the  
iand is under irrigation, and a part is not suscepti-  
ble of it, both being otherwise of equal fertility,  
the part irrigated is of double price in the market.  
It is to be noted indeed that the climate is a dry  
one, and that the article cultivated is Lucerne.  
And this a plant which, though much aided in its  
growth by moisture, is at the same time remarka-  
ble for the length of a tap root and fitted by that  
as well as by the absorbent quality of its leaves, to  
flourish in a thirsty soil, and warm climate. Our  
particular district of country, abounding in springs,  
small streaiis, and suitable declivities, admits  
greatly of irrigation; and being generally of a thirs-  
ty nature, the more strongly invites the use of it.  
  
I cannot but consider it as an error in our hus-  
bandry, that oxen are too little used in place of  
horses.  
  
Every fair comparison of the expense of the two  
animals, favors a preference of the ox. But the  
circumstance particularly recommending him, is  
that he can be supportd when at work, by grass and  
hay; whilst the horse requires grain and much of it;  
and the grain generally given him, Indian corn, the  
crop which requires most labor, and greatly ex-  
hausts the land.  
  
From the best estimate I have been enable to  
form, more than one half of the corn crop is consum-  
ed by horses, including the ungrown ones; and  
not less than one half, by other than pleasure  
horses. By getting free from this consumption,

one half the labor, and of the w2ar of the land,  
would be saved, or rather more than one half; for  
en most farms, one halfof the crop of corn grows  
on not more than two fifths, and sometimes a smal-  
ler proportion of the cultivated fieldg; and the  
more fertile fields would of course be retained for  
cultivation, Every one can figure to himself the  
ease and conveniency of a revolution which would  
so much reduce the extent of his cornfields; and  
substitute for the labor bestowed on them the more  
easy task of providing pasturage and hay.  
  
But will not the ox when kept at hard labor re-  
quire grain food as well as the horse? Certhinly  
much tess, ifany. Judging from my own observation,  
I should say, that a plenty of good grass or good  
hay, will suffice without grain, where the labor is  
neither constant nor severe. But I feel entire con-  
fidence in saying, that a double set of oxen alter-  
nately at work, and therefore half the time at rest,  
might be kept in good plight without other food  
than a plenty of grass and good hay. And as this  
double set would double the supply of beef, tallow  
and leather, a set off is found in that consideration  
for a double consumption of that kind of food.  
  
The objections generally made to the ex, are—1.  
That he is less tractable then the horse. 2. That  
he does not bear heat as well. 3S. That he does  
not answer for the single plough used in our corn  
fields. 4. Thathe is slower in his movement.—  
5. That he is less fit for carrying the produce of the  
farm to market.  
  
The first objection is certainly founded in mis»  
take. Of the two animals, the ox is the more do-  
cile. In all countries were the ox is the ordinary  
draught animal, his docility is proverbial. His in-  
tractability, where it exists, has arisen from an oc-  
casional use of him only with long and irregular  
intervals; during which the habit of discipline he-  
ing broken, a new one is to be formed. |  
  
The 2d odjection has a little foundation. The  
constitution of the ox accommodates itself, as rea-  
dily as that of the horse, to different climates—  
Not only in ancient Greece and Italy, but through  
out Asia, as presented to us in ancient history, the  
ox and the plow are associated. At this day, in the  
warm parts of India and China, the ox, not the  
yhorse, is in the draught service. In every part of  
India the ox always appears even in the train of  
her armies. And in the hottest parts of the West  
Indies, the ox is employed in hauling the weighty  
produce to the sea ports. The mistake here, as in  
the former case, has arisen from the effect of an  
occasional employment only, with no other than  
green food. The fermentation of this in the ani.  
mal heated by the weather, and fretted by the dis-  
cipline, will readily account for his sinking under  
his exertions; when green food even, much less dry,  
with a sober habit of labor, would have no such  
tendency.  
  
The 3d odjection also is not a solid one. The  
ox can by a proper harness be used singly as well  
as the horse, between thé rows of Indian corn; and  
equally so used for other purposes. Experience  
may be safely appealed to on this point,  
  
In the fourth place, it is alledged that he is slow-  
er in his movements. This is true, but in a less  
degree, than is often taken for granted. Oxen that  
are well chosen for their form, are not worked af-  
ter the age of about 8 years, (the age at which they  
are «est fitted for beef,) are not worked too many  
together, and are suitably matched, may be kept  
to nearly as quick a step as the horse. May I not  
say a step quicker than that of many of the horses

leanness occasioned by the costliness of the food  
they require, lose this advantage, where they  
might have once had it?  
  
The last objection has most weight. The ox is,  
not as well adapted as the horse to the road service,  
especially for long trips. In common roads, which  
are often soft, and sometimes suddenly become so,  
the form of his foot, and the shortness of his leg,  
are disadvantages; and on roads frozen, or turn-  
piked, the roughness of the surface in the former  
case, and its hardness in both cases, are inconveni.  
ent to his cloven hoof. But where the distance to  
to market is not great, where the varying state of  
the roads and of the weather can be consulted; and  
where the road service is in less proportion to the  
farm service, the objection is almost deprived of  
its weight. In cases where it most applies, its  
weight is diminished by the consideration, that a  
much greater proportion of service on the firm  
may be done by oxen, than is now commonly done;  
and that the expense of shoing them is little dif-  
ferent from that of keeping horses shod. It is ob-  
servable, that when oxen are worked on the farm,  
over rough frozen ground, they suffer so much  
from the want of shoes, however well fed they may  
be, that it is a proper subject for calculation, whe-  
ther true economy does not require of them that  
accommodation, even on the farm as well as for the  
horses.  
  
A more important calculation is, whether, in  
many situations, the general saving by substituting  
the ox for the horse, would not balance the ex-  
pense of hiring a carriage of the produce to mar-  
ket. In the same scale with the hire, is to be put  
the value of the grass and hay consumed by the  
oxen; and in the other scale, the value of the corn,  
amounting to one half of the crop, and of the grass  
and hay consumed by the horses. Where the mar-  
ket is not distant, the value of the corn saved  
would certainly pay for the carriage of the market  
portion of the crop, and balance moreover any dif-  
ference between the value of the grass and hay  
consumed by oxen, and the value of the oxen when  
slaughtered for beef. In all these calculations it  
is, doubtless, proper not to lose sight of the rule,  
that farmers ought to avoid paying others for do-  
ing what they can do themselves. Wut the rule  
has its exceptions; and the error, if it be commit-  
ted, wiil not lie in departing from the rule, but in  
not selecting aright the cases which call for the  
departure. It may be remarked, that the rule  
ought to be more or less general, as there may or  
may not be at hand, a market by which every pro-  
duce of labor is convertible into money. In the old  
countries this is much more the case than in the  
new; and in thenew, much more the case near towns,  
than at a distance from them. In this, as in most  
other parts of our country, a change of circum-  
stances is taking place, which renders every thing  
raised on afarm more convertible into money than  
formerly; aud as the change proceeds, it will be  
more and more a point for consideration, how far  
  
the labor in doing what might be bought, could  
earn more in another way, than the amount of the  
  
purchase. Still it will always be prudent, for  
reasons wuich every experienced farmer will un.  
derstand, to lean to the side of doing, rather than  
hiring or buying, what may be wanted.

a Se”  
  
weighs most against the ox. He is less fitted than  
the horse for road service.  
  
Vv. A more manifest error in the husbandry of the  
older settlements, is that of keeping too many neat  
cattle on their farms. Asa farm should not be  
cultivated farther than it can be continued in good  
heart: the stock of cattle should not be in greater  
number than the resources of feod will keep in  
good plight. If a poor farm be unprofitable, so  
are poor cattle. It is particularly the case with the  
milch cows. When the whole of the food given  
them is necessary to support a lean existence, no  
part can be spared for the milk pail. The same  
food given to the proper number, will not only keep  
them in a thrifty state, but enable them to supply  
the dairy. Even the manure from several poor cat-  
tle is worth less than that from a single fat one.  
Lhe remark holds equally good with respect to the  
  
ide.  
  
The misjudged practice in question is another  
  
effect of inattention to the change of circumstan-  
ces through which our country has passed. Ori-  
ginally the forest abounded in rich herbage which  
fed and fatted, without expense, all the cattle that  
could be brought through the winter into the spring.  
It was natural at that time tokeep as large a stock  
as could be preserved through the winter. Fora  
long time past, the forest is scarcely any where a  
resource for more than two or three months; and  
in many places, noresource at all. A greater diffi-  
culty is often felt in finding summer, than winter  
subsistence. And yet where no inclosed pasturage  
is provided to take the place of the extinct one in  
the forest, the habit, founded in reasons which have  
entirely ceased, is but too generally retained. The  
same number of cattle is aimed at, as if the forest  
was as ready to receive and fatten them now as for-  
merly. The size and appearance of our neat cattle,  
compared with those for which nature or good hus-  
bandry has provided sufficient food, are proofs that  
their food is not in proportion to their number; and  
that where the food cannot be increased, the num-  
ber ought to be reduced.  
_ Vi. OF all the errors in our rural economy none  
is perhaps so much to be regretted, because none  
is so difficult to be repaired, as the injudicious and  
excessive destruction of timber and firewood. It  
seems never to have occurred that the fund was  
not inexhaustible, and that acrop of trees could  
not be raised as quickly as one of wheat or corn.  
  
Here again we are presented with a proofof the  
continuance of a practice for which the reasons  
have ceased. When our ancestors arrived, they  
found the trees of the forest the great obstacle to  
their settlement and cultivation. The great effort  
was of course to destroy the trees. It would seem  
that they contracted and transmitted an antipathy  
to them: for the trees were not even spared around  
the dwellings, where their shade would have been  
a comfort, and their beauty an ornament; and. it is  
of late years only, that these advantages have been  
attended to. In fact such has been the inconside-  
rate and indiscriminate use of the axe, that this  
country is beginning to feel the calamity as much  
as some of the old countries of Europe; and it will  
soon be forced to understand the difficulty of cur-  
ing it. A vast proportion of the farms on the  
eastern side of the Blue Ridge, and some even OR  
the other side, have but a scanty fund for present

And to increase the evil, the remnant of timber and  
  
ter, inferior to the former; but so well adapted toj fuel on many farms, inadequate as it is, is left in  
  
particular services, that he may find a proper place  
  
situations remote from the dwelling, and incapa-

subdivisions tnto which all the farms must  
be rapidly forced by the law of descents, the im-  
pulses of parental affection, and other causes. _  
  
It is high time for many farmers, even in this  
  
quarter, and still more so in the country below us,  
to take this subject into serious consideration.  
Prudence willno longer delay to economize what  
remains of woodland; to foster the second growths  
where taking place in convenient spots; and to  
commence, where necessary, plantations of the  
trees recommended by their utility and quiekness  
of growth. .  
I wish I could more satisfactorily estimate the pro-  
portion of woodland which ought to belong to  
every farm, as a permanent fund of timber for  
building and repairing houses; for fences, where  
live or stone ones may not be introduced; for wheel  
carriages, and the other apparatus needed on farms.  
The estimate is the more difficuJt, because it must  
be varied according to many circumstances; par-  
ticularly, according to the nature of the soil and  
the kind of trees at once suited to it, and to the  
uses to be made of them.  
  
Estimating the crop of wood, yielded by an acre,  
at twenty cords, the period of reproduction at twen-  
ty years, and the average number of cords annually  
consumed at a fireplace, including the culinary  
consumption, at ten cords, every fire-place on a  
farm will require ten acres for a permanent supply  
of fuel. For the other necessities of a farm several  
acres more ought to be added.  
  
An estimate ina very sensible publication, en-  
titled “The New England Farmer,” makes seven-  
teen acres necessary for a fire-place. The winters  
there are longer, and the climate may be less fa-  
vorable to the quick growth of trees. But their  
houses are generaliy closer than with us; to say  
nothing of a more judicious management than can  
be enforced on most of our farms.  
  
To this catalogue of errors in our rural econo-  
my, considerable as itis, many I fear might be  
added. The task of pointing them out,I gladly  
leave to others, less incapable than I have shewn  
myself to be, by the very imperfect manner in  
which I have performed the one on which I ven-  
  
tured

j It lias been asked, how.it happens that  
I Trrvpt and Sicilv. which have for ages  
I K.&#x27;in snorting their agricultural produce  
without a return ot any equivalent pro-i  
date, nave not lost tneir pnwuuive v.  
pacty . One answer has been, that they  
have &quot;lost no small degree of it. If the fact  
be otherwise with regard to &quot;Egypt, it  
might be accounted for by the fertilizing  
inundations of the Nile. With regard to  
Sicily, there may be something in the sys­  
tem of husbandry, or some particular lo­  
cal ci rcum stances w hlch counte r vail the  
continued asportation of the f ruit cf the  
Srd. But it is far more probable, that the  
j-.L.nd is less productive thin it once was.  
I: is certainly less of a granary for other  
c. un tries now, than it was when it receiv­  
ed that title from the ancient Romans.­  
And its population being diminished the  
internal consumption must also he dimi­  
ni,hcd. If a single farm is rendered less  
productive by a continued removal of its  
crops, without any adequate returns, no  
lCiiS&#x27;n cccurs why it should net happen  
to a number of farms multiplied to the  
extent of a whole country. ;  
And that-individual farms do lose their

I. from them, ami returns 01 manure neg- ;

d lected. is a fact not likely to be quest jon­  
ed If it were, Virginia, unfortunately, is  
but too capable of far:d&#x27;ivng the proofs.  
Her prevailing crops have been very ex­  
bausth g, and the use of manures has been  
particular&#x27; reelected.  
Tobacco and Indian corn, which fer a  
long time cn the east side c the Blue  
Mountains were the articles almost ex-  
I cluiveiv cultivated, and ,.; which. continue  
f t DC CUluVateu, i;cr 101 locr .CAitusnciy,- t  
the latter universally, are known to be j  
great impoverishei s of the soil. Wheat, ;  
which has for a number of years, formed i  
a large portion of the general crop, is al-  
so ani -exhausting crop. So are rye and j  
.. . ..it -&#x27; 1  
oats, whicn enter occasionally into our  
j farming system.  
With so. many consumers of the fcrtili­

I the means cf repairing their ravages, no  
f cue can be surprised at the impoverished  
face of the country ; whilst every one  
I ctiehttobe desirous uf aiding in the work  
of i-etornivtiojL  
The first and mam step towards it, is  
to make the thieves restore as much as  
poss;ble of the stolen fertility. On this,  
with other improvements, which may be  
made in our husbandry, we must depend  
for the-rescue of our tarms from their  
prc: ent degnuit d condition.  
Of tobacco, -not a great deal more than  
cne half of ihe tmiie plantis carried to  
market. Thc-rvvdue is an item cn the  
list of manures: ..and. it is kn-nvu to be in  
1 1  
its quality a very rich one.- I he crp of  
tobacco, however, though of great value,  
covers hut u small proportion cf our cul- : -  
tivated ground; and its offal can c course, ;  
contribute- but inconsiderably to the een- i -  
eral stock ot maiiuie. it is probable al-  
I so, that&#x27; what it &#x27;does contribute, has been !  
mere care&#x27;ully uvetl as a manure, than a­  
nv other article furnished b our crr.ps.  
The article which constitutes our prin­  
cipal manure, is wheat straw. It is of  
much importance, therefore, to decide a­  
rifchton the mode of using it. There are  
three modes : 1. Carrying it fr  
:ng it from the  
farm yard, after having passed threugh, i  
or being trodden and enriched bv catlie. !  
In that moe. the greater part of it must  
be used, if used, at all; -the stra7 going  
through that process, being a necessary  
part cf the food allotted to the cattle.  
To derive the fuU advantage from it, it  
ought to be hauied out bt fere the sub­  
stance has been wasted by rain, by the  
un, and by the wind : and to be b&#x27;tried in  
the earth, as soon as possible. 2. Spread­  
ing the straw .or. the surnxe of the ground.  
Many respectable farmers are attached  
to this .mode, &#x27;as protect in  
the soil from&quot;!  
the sun : and by keeping it moist, favor  
ing the vegptatica underreath, -whether  
spontaneous or artificial ; whilst die s raw  
.&#x27; ,r .1 j  
ziseii la ui iiuudii v uilv io ui u into a um- ,  
nure. Tiie objection to tin&#x27;s mode, is .--the- .!  
it ss by evaporation, before this last enect  
ii obtained. 3. Turn uig the strawat oixe !  
under  
f would  
the surface cf the earth. T his  
seem to be the best mode of ma-  
1 o  
substance beirg then lost. When the  
. grain is trodden out trom the straw, it is  
left in a state easily admitting this opera­  
tion. So::.e dilhctdty may attend it, when  
the grain is ihreshe&#x27;d from the straw, by  
the flail, or by the machines no., in use,  
i either i f which break the straw suffici­  
ently to pieces. ;&#x27;  
It may be remarked with regard to this  
article of manure 1. That its weigiit is  
barely more than tha t of the grain. 2. That  
the grain is the part which makes the  
greatest d raft on 4he fertility of the earth.  
3. That ti.e ;i ain is for tlie most part not  
consumed -within the farm. It is found,  
on trial, that a stalk of wheat, as general­  
ly cut, including tne chalf, and the grains  
borne by the stalk, are pretty nearly of  
equal we:ht. Ti: case is probably the  
same wuh ive, aiid not very diflerent  
with oats. Tne proportion of fertilizing  
matter in the .,traw, to that in the grain,  
has not, as tar as 1 know, been brought  
tc any satisfactory test. It is doubtless  
c tlGh less Jiu tluj straw, wii Ui aleu.C, in  
  
the cae ot wheat, is with us returnable  
i in any form to the earth. This conside  
  
ration, whilst it urges ns to make the most  
of th article as a manure, warns us of its  
insufficiency.  
The stubble, and the roots of the small  
grains, not being taken from the earth,  
may be regarded as relapsing into a fer  
tility equal to that of which they depriv­  
ed the earth. This remark is applicable  
to all cultivated plants, the roots of which  
are not an esculent part. .  
An eminent citizen and celebrated agri­  
culturalist! of this State, has among other  
instructive lessons, called the public at­  
tention, to the value of the corn stalk as  
a manure. I am persuaded that he has  
not overrated it. And it is a subject of  
agreeable reflection, that an article which  
is so extensively &#x27;&#x27;cultivated as that ofIndian--  
corn, and which is so particularly  
exhausting, should be the one so capable  
of repairing the injury it does. The corn  
stalk as a fdder is of great value. Not  
only the loaves, but the husk inclosing  
the ear, and the co!) inched by it, are all  
more or less valuable food when duly  
preserve 1 and dealt out to cattle. There  
is no better fodder than the leaves or  
blades i-T Iiorves ard oxen ; nor any so  
much a&#x27;luroved-&#x27; for sheep. The husk or  
shuck i u highly nourishing food for. neat&#x27;  
cutde. And the pickings of the- staik,  
even at 1 1 ite reason, and after much ex­  
posure t. tti e w eather, support t hem bet­  
ter than any of the straws. Fnmi the  
saccharine matter in the stalk, which is  
long retained abnit the j ints, it cri-t  
be doubted that if cut early, cr befoiv ex­  
posure to the w eather, into parts small  
enough for mastication, it :. would well re-  
pay as a food for cattle, the labor reqair-  
eu ror u.  
The great value of the cornstalk, in all  
its parts, as a fodder, was brougiu into  
full proof, by the Use ma&#x27;le of it, during  
the late general failure of crops. It is to  
be hoped that the.icsaoii willnoc be suf­  
fered to pass into oliivton.  
But it is as a rest urce for rc-fertiUzing  
the soil, that the cornstalk finds the pro  
per place here : and as such it merits  
particular notice, whether it be passed  
! through animals : or be nrenaixd ov fer-  
mentation m the i arm yard : orbe mere-j!  
ly spread on the surface of the earth, the  
mode in which its eltccts must be least  
considerable. Tue same &#x27;qualities which  
render every p ti t of it nutnci.ais to ani­  
mals, render it uutricious to the earth ;  
and it is accompanied with the peculiar  
advantages 1. That the -.grain - itself is  
j mostly every where, anrl .-altogether- in  
places distant fro.ii navigation, consumed&#x27;  
! within t!ie farms producing it. 2. That  
as toe grain is m greater proportiosj to  
the .space on .which it grows, than- most

) The cotton plant, which is so extensive  
1 a crop, in the more southern, and the  
! soutiy western states, is but little cultiva  
ted m V irgiaia, and scarcUy at ail in this  
I pitrt cf it. I am not aide to say how far  
j it is comparatively an exhausting crop.  
j Butit woaid seem f; be more capable than  
j any crop n.t v. h,liy consumed within tiie  
! farm, of preserving its fertility. The on­  
i ly part of tlie plan carried away, is the  
! cotton ft re, or woolly part, which bears  
I an inconsiderable proporticn t- the ether  
j parts in weigh , and as may be inferred,  
j in fertilizing matter also. The seed alone,  
passing by the ball and the haulm, is of  
( three times its weight, and contains the  
chief part oi the oil in tne plant. In the  
countries .&#x27;where cotton makes the princi­  
pal part of the crop, the superfluous seetl  
must deserv e great attention as a manure.  
Where the fields are level or cultivated in  
horizontal drills, it might go far towards  
supporting a continued cropping, without  
a diminished fertility.  
T he sum of these remarks on cultiva­  
ting poor land, and neglecting the means  
of keeping or making land rich, isf, that  
if every thing grown on a soil is carried  
from, it, it must become unprbdilctive ;

that if every thing grown on it, be direct­  
ly or indirectly restored to it, it would not  
cease to be productive ; and, consequent­  
ly, that-according to the degree in which  
the one or the other practice takes place,  
a farm fnust be empoverished, or be per­  
manently productive and profitable. Iv  
very acre made by an improved manage­  
ment to produce as much as two acres  
in effect the addition of a new acre ; with  
the great advantage of conrracting the  
spacf to be cultivated, and of shorieniug  
the distance of transporutipu between the  
fields, and the barn or the farm yard.  
One of the Roman writei-s on husbandry,  
enforces the obligation to an improving  
management by a story of one Paradi&#x27;is  
who hid two daughters and a vineyard :  
w hen the elder was married, he gave her  
a third part of the vineyard ; no; wirlj­  
standing which, he obtained from two­  
thirds, the same &quot;crop as from the wnole ;  
when hi other daughter was married, lie  
portioned her with the li .lf of what re­  
mained ; and still the -produce of h;s vine­  
yard was undiminished. The story iliort  
as ir is, contains a volume of instruction-  
  
i he plaster or gypsum though not a  
manure within the tann itself, ms been  
too loog neglected, as a fertiiiz ng rc  
source. It is now beginning to take a  
nirh and iust rank as such. The rroofs  
of its efficacy are as i.uc -;ntestii)le, as the  
causes ot it are -&#x27;Uscure. The experi­  
ments of a veiy distinguished chemist  
led him to the opinion tnat its substance  
nt&#x27; rs into the subsuuce.&#x27;of the&quot; plant.  
Without doiibtitig tiie f tct,it des not uf­  
iic:einly acc ;un&#x27; f r the addition inade m  
the size and Wt iht of tne plant, which  
&#x27; greatly exceed the qu unity of the plas­  
l ter. It must theref. ic have some fur-  
ther mode of operating. Whetuer it be

will be wise to take for granted, to t &#x27;i:  
must be made a s .urcecf tatsire maiiuie.  
a-&#x27; well as of immediate productiveness.  
If the crop as augmented by the plaster  
be gienback to the soil, toe soil may be  
benefited more than it would be, by the  
return of a crop nut augmented by the  
plasty. And in this way fertility may  
be accelerated. The restoration ui a cro  
tiicreused by ordinary cultivation, to tiie  
St a I on wnich it giew, would, I presume,  
fertilize&#x27; it niure than the l-estoration of  
smaller crop spontaneously produced ; al­  
though in both cases, the whole taken  
from the soil would return to it.  
IV. Among the means of aiding the  
productiveness of the soil, which have no­  
received merited attention, is irrigation.  
In scarcely any country does this resource  
abound more than in the United States ;  
nor is there any, where there is so little  
sensibility to its value. The inconsidera­  
ble use made of it is cliiefly by emigrants,  
particularly Germans, or the immediate  
descendants of tliem. I have understoxi  
that tlie market of Baltimore has been  
much benefitted in dry seasons by the ir­  
rigation introduced by exiles from St. Do­  
mmgo. For a distinguished proof of tht  
importance of the practice, I may refer  
to the fact which has been stated, that in  
the neighborhood of Barcelona in Spain,  
where a part of the land is under irriga­  
tion, and a part is not susceptible of if,  
bbth being otnerwiac of equal fertility, the  
v Columella.  
Sir IL Diivj. &#x27; ,. &quot; &#x27;  
  
part irrigated is of double price in the  
market. It is to be noted indeed thntthe  
climate is a dry one, and that the article  
cultivated is Lucerne. But this h. a plant,&#x27;  
vhich though much aided in ?ts growth&#x27;  
by moisture, is at the same &quot;time remarka­  
ble fir. the length of a tap ror.r, and fitted  
bv that as well as bvthe absorlArnt oualitv  
  
) of its leaves, t j finuristi in a thirsty soil, &amp;  
warm dim ite. O ir particular district of  
country, abounding in sorings, small  
t streams, atiil suitable declivities, admits  
-greatly, of irrigation ; and being general  
i ly f a th&#x27;rsty nat ire, the m .re strongly&quot;  
&#x27; invites the use of it.  
&#x27; I camvt but consider it as an error in  
our husbandry, that oxen are too little  
&#x27;lied i pi nee of il Toes.  
Every fair comparison of the expence  
f t ie two animals, favors a preference of  
tne &#x27; X. &quot;.-&#x27;lint the circumstance narticular-  
j ly recommending him, is that he can be  
: supported when .at work, by grass &amp; hay;  
j whilst the horse requires grain and much  
i of it ; and the gr ii.i generally given him,  
j Indian oni, the crop which requires most  
; 1 dvr, and greatly exhausts the land,  
j l&#x27;r.m the best estimate I have bzen  
enabled to form, more than one half of the  
j corn crop is consumed by horses ; includ­  
I i, ig the ungrowu ones; and not less tnan  
one half, uy other than pleasure horses.  
. By getting free from, this consumption,  
i one iialf the labor, and of the wear of the  
I itnd, would be saved, or rather more  
dian one half ; for on mot farms, one  
half o the crop of corn grows on not  
more than two fifths, and sometimes a  
smaller proportion, of the cultivated  
field ; ami the more fertile fields would  
of course be retained for cultivation, li­  
very one can figure trt himself, the ease  
and conveulency of a revolution which  
would so much reduce the extent of his  
cornfields ; and substitute for the labor I  
bestowed on them, the mure easy task cf i  
providing pasturage and hay. j  
But will not the x himself when kept j  
at labor. require gram&#x27; food as well as the  
horse ? Certainly much less, if any.-Judging  
from ray own observation, I  
should say, that a plenty of gol grass, or  
good hay, will suffice wi:hout grain.where  
tlie labor is neither constant or severe.  
But 1 feel entire confidence in saying, that  
a double set of oxen alternately at work,  
and therefore half the time at rest, might  
be kept im good plight without other food  
ban a plenty of good grass or good hay.  
And as this double set would double the  
supply of beef, Uilo and leather, a set­  
off is found in that consideration for a  
double&quot; consumption of that kind of food.  
The objections generally made to the  
ox, are 1. That he is less tractable than  
the horse. 2. That he docs not bear heat  
as well. 3. That-he does not answer for  
the single plough used in our corn fields.  
4. That he is slower in his movements.  
5. That he is less fit for carrying the  
produce of the farm to market.  
The first objection is certainly founded  
in mistake. Of the two animals, the ox  
is the more decile. In ail c mntries where  
the ox is the ordinary draught animal his  
j d cility is proverbial. His intractability.  
waere it exists, has .risen toai an occa­  
sional use of him only with long and irrc-  
! gular intervals ; during which $he habit  
1 of discipline being broken, a new one is to  
Tne 2d objection has ns little founda­  
tion. The constitution of the ox accom-  
niodates itself, as re .d:ly as that of the  
1 horse to diffVrent &#x27;climates- -Not only, in  
; -inch nt Greece an i Italy, bat throughout  
Asia, as presented sous in ancient history,  
. th ox and the plough are associated. At  
this d .:&#x27;&#x27;, in the warm parts of India &#x27;and  
: China, the ox, n t the horse, is in the  
1 draught&#x27; service. In every part of India,  
the ox always appears, even m tne train  
; of her armies. Aad in the hottest parts  
&#x27; of the West Indies, the ox is employed in  
i hauling -&#x27;the weighty produce to the sea  
! ports. The mistake here, as in the form­  
! er case, has arisen, from the effect ot an  
i occasional employment only, with no o-  
f ther than ereen food. Tiie fermentation j  
of this in the animal heated by the wea­  
ther, and fretted by the discipiine.will rea­  
dily account for his sinking under his ex­  
ertions ; when green food even, much les  
. dry, with a sober habit of labor, would  
have no such tendency.  
The 3d objection also is not a solid one.  
The ox can by a proper harness, be used  
singly as well as the horse, between the  
rows of Indian corn; and equally so used  
for other purposes. Experience may be  
.afely appealed to on this point.  
In the 4th place, it is klkdgcd that he  
is slower in his movements. Tins is true,  
but in a less degree, than is often taken  
for granted. Oxen that are well chosen  
for their form, are not vvoiked after the  
age of about 8 years, (the age at which  
they are- best fitted for beef,) urc not  
worked too many together, ana are suit­  
ably matched, may be kept to cearly as  
quick a step as the horse. Muy I not say  
a step quicker than that of many of the  
horses we see at work, who, on account  
of their age, or the leanness occasioned  
by the costliness of the food they require,  
lose this advantage, where they might  
have once had it ?  
The last objection has most weight.  
The ox is not as well adapted as the horse  
to the road service; especially for long  
trips. Iu common roads which are often  
soft, and souietlmss Suddenly become so,  
  
i the form of his foot,&quot; and the sho-tness of  
his leg, are disadvantages ; and on r a.ds  
&#x27;frozen, or turnpiked, the roughness of  
jthe urftfce in the former case, and its  
j hardness in both cases, are inconvenient  
  
to his cloven hoot. But where-the dis­  
tanee to mark t is not great, where tha  
i varying state oi tne roads anit tlie wea­  
ther, can be consulted ; and where the  
raid service is m less proportion to the  
i r . . .  
iarni service, tue objection is almost tle­  
Drived of its weight. In ctses where it  
most applies, its weight is diminished by  
the consideration, that a much greatec  
proportion of service on the farm may be  
done by oxen.th n ia now commonly done ;  
land tnat the expence of shoeing them, is  
little different from that of keeping hor­  
i ses shod. It is observable, thai when ox  
;en are worked on tlie farm, over rough  
frozen ground, they suircr S) much from  
the wan: of slices, however well fed they  
may bj, that it is a proper subject for  
calculation, whether true economy does  
not require f r them,that accommodation  
even on the farm.as well as for the horses.  
A more importaut calculation is. whe  
ther, in many situations, the general sav-  
mg oy suostuuting tne ox tor the horse,  
would not balance the expence of hiring  
a carriage of the produce to market. la  
the same scale with the hire, is to be put  
the value of the grass and hay consumed  
by the oxen ; and in tlie other scale, the  
value of the corn amounting to one half  
of the crop, and of the grass and hay con  
sumed by the horses. Where tlie market  
is not distant, the value of the corn saved,  
would certainly pay for the carriage o  
the market portion of the crop, and ba­  
lance moreover any diirerence between  
the value of the grass and hay cousumed  
by oxen, and the value of the oxen when  
slaughtered for beef. Iri all these Calcu­  
lations, it is doubtless proper, not to lose  
sight of the rule, that farmers ought to a­  
void pav in? others fordoing, what they  
can do for themselv es. But the rule has  
j its exceptions ; &amp; the error, if it be com­  
j milted, will not lie in departing from the  
; ruie, but in not selecting aright the cases  
&#x27;.which call for the departure. It may be  
remarked, that the rule ought to be more  
jor less general, -as there may or may not  
be at hand, a market by which &quot;every  
produce of labor is convertible into money.  
In the old couutries, this is much mere  
the case, than in new ; and in new, much,  
more the case near towns, than at a dis­  
tance from them. In this as in most other  
parts of our country, a change of circum­  
stances is taking place, wnich renders  
every thing raised on a farm more conver­  
tible into money than formerly ; and as  
tiie change proceeds.it will be m re&amp;moi e  
a point for consideration, hov far the la  
bor in doing what might be bought, could  
earn more in any other way, than the a­  
mount of the purchase. Still it &#x27;will al­  
ways be prudent, for reasons w hich every  
experienced fanner wiil understand, to  
lean to the side of doing, rather than hir­  
ing or buying, what may he wanted.  
The mule seems to be, in point of eco­  
nomy, between the ox and the horse j  
preferable to the latter, inferior to the  
former ; but so well adapted to particular  
services, that he may find a proper place  
on many farms. He is liable to the objeOf  
tion which weighs most against the ox  
He is less fitted than the horse for road  
service.  
V. A more manifest error in tlie hus  
; bandry of the older settlements, is that of  
keeping too many neat cattle on their  
farm-,. As a farm should not be cultiva­  
ted farther than it can be continued in  
goxl heart ; tlie stock ot cattle should  
not be in greater number than the resour­  
ces of food will keep in good, plight. If a.  
poor farm be unprofitable, so are poor  
cattle. It is particularly the case with,  
the milch cows. When the whole of the  
food given tnem is necessaxy to support a  
lean existence, no part can be spared for1  
the milk pail. The same food given tc  
the proper number, will not only keep  
them in a thrifty state, but enable them  
to supply the dairy. Even the mauure  
from seveial poor cattle is worth less  
than that from a single fat one. The re­  
mark holds equally good with respect to  
the hide.  
The misjudged practice in question, is  
another effect of inattention to the Change  
of circumstances through which cur  
country has paused. Originally the forest  
; abounded in rich herbage which fed and  
j fatted, without expense, all the cattle that  
; could be brougUt through the - winter into  
Cue spring. It was natural at that time  
to keep as large a stock as cotdd be pre­  
served through the winter. For a lon?j  
time past, tlie forest is scarcely any where  
t a  
resource tor mre than two or three  
months ; and in many places, no resource  
at all. A greater ditiiculty is often telt in  
! folding summer, than whiter subsistence.  
i And yet where uo in closed pasturage is  
j prov ided to take the place c the extinct  
j one in tiie forest, the habit, founded in  
i reasons which have entirely ceased, is  
but too generally retained. The same  
number t! cattle is aur.eu at, as ir tne fo­  
rest was as ready to revive and fatten  
them now as formerly. The size and ap­  
pearance of our neat cattle, compared

It having pleased the Society to-.name me for  
their presiding member, I feel it w duty, on my  
first appearing among you, to repeat my acknow-  
ledgements for that honorary distinction; with  
the assurances of my sincere desire to promote  
the success ofan establishment which has in view  
so valuable an object as that of improving the  
agriculture of our country.  
  
The faculty of cultivating the earth, and of  
rearing animals, by which fod is increased be-  
yond the spontaneous supplies of nature, belongs  
to man alone. No other terrestrial being has re-  
ceived a higher gift than an instinct, like that of  
the beaver or the ant, which merely hoards for  
future use the food spontaneously furnished by  
nature.  
  
As this peculiar faculty gives to man a pre-emi-  
nence over irrativnal animals; so it is the use made  
of it by some, and the neglect of it by other com-  
munities, that distinguishes them from each other,  
in the most important features of the human cha-  
racter. -  
  
The contrast between the enlightened and re-  
fined nations on some parts of the earth, and the  
rude and wretched tribes on others, has its foun-  
dation in this distinction. Civilization is never  
seen without agriculture, nor has agriculture ever ~  
prevailed where the civilized arts did not make  
their appearance.  
  
But, closely as, agriculture and civilization arc,  
allied, they do not keep with each other.  
There is probably a much higher state of agricul-  
ture in China and Japan, than in many other  
countries far more advanced in the improvements  
of civilized life. 1t is surely no small reproach to  
the latter, that, with so great a superiority in sci-  
ence, and in the fuller possession of the auxiliary  
arts, they should suffer themselves to be outstri  
ped in the very art by which both are essentially  
distinguished the brute creation.  
  
It must not be inferred, however, from the ca  
pacities and the motives of man for an artificial  
increase of the productions of the earth, that the  
transition from the hunter or even the h  
state to the agricultural, is a matter of eourse. The  
first steps in this randiioe are attended with  
difficulty; and what is with disinclination.  
  
Without a eo the metals, and the  
implements made of them, the process of open-  
ing and stirring the soil, is not an easy operation,  
though one perhaps not requiring more effort  
and contrivance than produced the instruments  
used by savages in war and in the chase.  
  
And that there isa disinctination in human na-  
ture to exchange the savage for the civilized life,

cannot be questioned. We need not lock for  
  
  
  
  
  
150  
  
proofs beyond our own neighborhood. The In-  
dian tribes have ever shown an aversion to the  
change. Neither the perstiasive examples -of  
plenty and comfort, derived from the culture of  
the earth by their white brethren, nor the lessons  
and specimens of tillage placed in the midst of  
them, and seconded by actual sufferings from a de-  
ficient and precarious subsistence, have convert-  
ed them from their stroug propensities and habi-  
tual pursuits. In the same Spirit they always be-  
tray an anxious disposition to return to their pris-  
tine life, after being weaned fromit by time, and ap-  
parently moulded by intellectual and moral in-  
struction, into the habits and tastes of an agricul-  
tural peuple. A still moré conclusive evidence of  
the bias of human nature is seen in the familiar  
fact, that our own people, nursed and reared in  
these habits and tastes, easily slide into those of  
the savage, ard ate rarely reclaimed to civilized  
society with their own consent.  
  
Had the Europeans, on their arrival, found this  
continent destitute of human inhabitants, whose  
dangerous neighborhood kept them in a compact  
and agricultural state, and had their communica-  
tion with the countries they left been discontinu-  
ed, they might have spread themselves into the  
forests, where gume and fruit would have abound-  
ed;* and gradually forgetting the arts no longer  
necessary to theirimmediate wants, have degene-  
rated into savage tribes.  
  
An admired historian,” in his inquiry into the  
origin of the American savages, represents any  
such degeneracy as impossible. He lays it down  
as a certain principle, that the necessary arts of  
life, when once introduced ainong a people, can  
never be lost; that the dominion over inferor ani-  
mals once enjoyed, will never be abandoned; and  
that America, consequently, must have been peo  
  
led from,a country as uncivilized us itself. Yet  
he derives the American savages generally from  
the Tartars, whose example must have taught  
them the use of certain animals, for which a sub-  
stitute might have been found in the bison or buf-  
falo at least, (the same animal with the cow) if  
not in the eik, the moose, or the caraboo; and he  
regards the Esquimaux, a tribe distinguished in  
scveral respects, for their rude condition, as des-  
cendants from the Greenlanders, (of the same  
modes of life with themselves) who were% colony  
from Norway, planted in the ninth century, an  
epoch prior to which the Norwegians had made  
such progress in the arts, as to be capable of for-  
midable maritime expeditions. The Greenland  
colony, therefore, must have undergone a dege-  
neracy from the condition of its parent country  
Without supposing the possibility of a transition  
from a better state of human society to a savage  
state, how would the learned historian have ac-  
counted for the introduction of the savage state at  
all? “4  
  
The bent of human nature may be traced on  
the chart of our own country, The manufacturer  
readily exchanges the loom for the plough, in op-  
position ofien to. his own interest, as well as to  
that of his country. The cultivator, in situations  
  
resenting an option, préfers to the labors of the  
Feld the.more easy employment of rearing a herd.  
And as. the game of the forest is approached, the  
hanting life displaysthe force of. its attractions.

latter a follower of the plough; and the last repair.  
ing to the manufactory or the workshop.  
  
Such, indeed is the fascination of that personal’  
  
independence which belongs to the uncivilized:  
state, and such the disreiish and contempt of the  
monotonous labor of tillage, compared with the  
exciting occupations of the chase, or with the in.  
dolence enjoyed by those who subsist chiefly on»  
the mere bounties of nature, or on the mi tory  
flocks, that a voluntary relinquishment of these  
latter modes:of life is little to be expected. We  
certainly perceive nothing in the character of our  
savage neighbors from which it could be inferred,  
that even the germs of agriculture, observed in  
their spots of maize, and a few other cultivated  
plants, would ever be developed into the extent  
implied by.an agricultural life. ‘To that little re.  
source, combined with the game furnished by the  
forest, and by the lake, or the stream, their ‘popu-  
lation and habits are adjusted. There may be  
said, in fact, to be a plenum ofthe former; because  
it is commensurate with their food, and this cannot  
be increased without a change of habits, which  
being founded in natural propensities, do not  
change of themselves.  
  
The first introduction of agriculture among a  
savage people, appears accordingly never to have  
taken place without some extraordinary interpo-  
sition. Where it has not been obtruded by co-  
lonies trans#lanted from agricultural countries, as  
from Pheenicia and Egypt into Greece, and from  
Greece ‘herself among her savage neighbors, the  
revolution has proceeded from some individual,  
whose singular endowments and supernatural pre-  
tensions, had given him an ascendancy for the  
purpose. All these great reformers, in ancient  
times, were regarded as more than men, and ulti-  
mately worshipped as gods. A very remarkable  
example, of modern date, is found in the revolu-  
tidn from the savage to the agricultural state, said  
to have been brought about by Manco Capac,  
among the Peruvians, to whom he represented  
himself as the offspring of the sun.  
  
Agriculture, once effectually commenced, may  
proceed of itself, under impulses of its own crea-  
tion. The mouths fed by it increasing and the  
supplies of nature decreasing, necessity becomes  
a spur to industry; which finds another spur in  
the advantages incident to the acquisition of pro-  
perty in the civilized state. And thus a progres-  
sive agriculture, and a progressive population  
ensue.  
  
But, although no determinate limit presents it-  
self to the increase of food, and toa population  
commensurgte with it, other than the limited pro-  
ductiveness of the earth itself, we can scarcely  
be warranted in supposing, that all the productive  
powers of its surface can be made subservient to  
the use of man, in exclusion of all the plants and  
animals not entering into his stock of subsistence;  
that all the elements and combinations of ele-  
ments in the earth, the atmosphere, and the wa-  
ter, which now support such various and such nue  
merous discriptioas of created beings, animate and  
inanimate, could be withdrawn from that general  
destination and appropriated tothe exclugive sup-  
port and increase of the human part of the crea-  
tion; so that the whole habitable earth should be  
as full of people, as the spots most crowded now  
are or might be made, and as destitute as those  
spots, of the plants and animals not used by man.

tives new beauty from every insight that can be  
  
gained into it. It is forbidden also by the princi-  
  
les and laws which operate in various depart  
mentsof her economy, falling within the scope of  
common observation, as well as within that of  
philosophic researches.  
  
i The earth contains not less than thirty or forty  
thousand, kinds of plants; not less than six or seven  
handred of birds; nor lessthan three or four hun-  
  
© dred of quadrupeds; to say nothing of the thousand  
species of fishes. Of reptiles and insects there  
ure more than.can be numbered. To all these  
must be added the swarms and varieties of ani;  
malcules and minute vegetable not visible to the  
  
\ natural eye, but whose existence is probably con-  
nected with that of visible animals and plants.  
  
On comparing this vast profusion and multipli-  
city of beings with the few grains and grasses, the  
few herbs and roots, and the few fowls and qua-  
drupeds, which make up the short list adapted to  
the wants of man, it is difficult to believe that it  
  
= fies with him, so to remodel the work of nature  
as it would be remodelled, by a destruction not  
only of individuals, but of entire species; and not  
only ofa few species, but of every species, with  
the very few exceptions which he might spare for  
  
- his own accommodation. ,  
  
4 Such a multiplication of the human race, at the  
expense of the rest of the organized creation, im-  
plies that the food of all plants is composed of ele-  
  
# ments equally andindiscriminately nourishing all,  
  
ie  
  
J. and which consequently may be wholly appropriat-  
  
ed to the one or few plants best fitted for hnman  
  
use.  
  
Whether the food or constituent matter of vege-  
tables be furnished from the earth, the air, and’  
water, aad whether directly, or by either through  
the medium of the others, no sufficient ground  
appears for the inference that the food for all is  
the same,  
  
q Different planta require different soils; some  
  
Qourishing in sandy, some in clayey, some in  
  
moist, some in dry soils; some in warm, some in  
  
~~ cold situations. Many grow only in water—and a  
  
few subsist in the atmosphere. The forms, the  
  
rT textures, and the qualities of plants are still more  
  
diversified, That things so various and dissimi-  
  
Jar in their organizations, their constitutions, and  
  
their characters, should be wholly nourished by,  
  
and consist of, precisely the same elements, re-  
quires more proof than has yet been afforded.  
  
A case which has been relied on to prove that  
different foods are not necessary for different  
plants, is that of grafting or inoculating one kind  
of plant on another Kind; the sap obtained by the  
stock for itself being found to feed and perfect  
  
~— the graft. But this operation has its limits. It  
does not extend beyond plants having a certain  
affinity. The apple tree may be planted -on the  
pear or quince. It will not succeed on the peach  
orthe cherry. Ifthe cases prove that the same  
food suffices for the apple and the pear, they  
equally prove that different foods are required for  
the apple and the peach. It is said even, that the  
fruit from the peach graft on the almond is not  
precisely the same with that from a peach graft  
en the plum.  
  
It may be offered as another ergument to the  
same effect, that all animal and vegetable decom-  
  
ositions answer indiscriminately as manures. The  
  
ct is not precisely so. Certain manures suc-  
  
, ceed best with certain plants. It is true, never-  
theless, that animal and vegetable substances, in

a decomposed state, are, generally, manures for  
plants. Fish even, an animal from the water, is  
successfully used as a manure for Indian corn and  
other crops. But this and similar examples prove  
only that some ingredients are the same in all  
animals and plants; rot that all the ingredients In  
each are the same.  
  
The chemist, though as yet a fellow student,  
as much as a preceptor of the agriculturist, justly  
claims attention to the result of -his processes.  
From that source we learn that the number of  
known elements, not yet recomposable, is b  
tween forty and fifty; that about seven or. eigh  
belong to the organ of plants; that different ele-  
ments enter into the composition of the sime  
plant; and that they are combined in different  
numbers and _ in different proportions, in differ-  
ent plants. Supposing then, as must be suppo-  
sed, that these different elements, in their actual  
quantities and proportions, are adapted to the  
quantities and the preportions of the existing va-  
rieties of plants; it would happen_in_so great @  
change as that in question with respeet to the  
number and variety of plants, that the quantities  
and the proportions of the elements would not  
be adapted to the particular kinds and numbers  
of plants retained by man for his own ute. Like  
the types of the alphabet, sprertoned to the  
words composing a particular book, when appli-  
ed to another book, materially different in. its  
contents, there would be, of some, a deficiency,.oF  
others a useless surplus. “sail  
  
Were it less difficult to admit. that, all.  
sourses of productiveness could be exclusiv  
appropriated to the food of man, is it certaimthat  
an obstacle to his indefinite multiplication: .w  
not be encountered in.one of the relations  
tween the atmosphere and organized beings? . ..  
  
Animals, including man, and. plants, maj  
regarded as the. most im ae  
terrestrial creation, T are, pre-eminent an  
their attributes; and all nature teems with, their  
varieties and their multitudes, visible and invisi-  
ble To all of them the atmosphere is the breath  
of life. Deprived .of it they all, equally perish.  
But it answers this purpose by virtue of its, ap-  
propriate constitution and character. What are  
these?  
  
The atmosphere is not a simple, but a come  
pound body. In its least compound state, it is  
understood to contain, besides what is called vitgl  
air, others noxious in themselves, yet, without a  
portion of which, the yital air becomes noxious.  
But the atmosphere in its natural state, and in. its  
ordinary communication with .the organiz  
world, comprises various i ngeeie ps deriv:  
  
me  
  
from the use made of it, by.the existing varie  
  
of animals and plants. The exhalations and 7  
spirations, the effluvia a transpirations of these  
are continually charging.the. atmosphere with a  
heterogeneous variety and immense quantity of  
matter, which, together, must contribute to the  
chafacter which fits it for its destined purpose of  
supporting the life and health of organized be-  
ings. It is unreasonable to suppose, that if, in-  
stead of the actual composition and chetacter of  
the animal and vegetable creation, to which the  
atmosphere is now accommodated, such a coms  
position and character of that creation were sub»  
stituted, as would result from a reduction of the  
whole to man anda few kinds of animals and  
  
plants; is the supposition unreasonablg,yshat .

the atmosphere for the functions required of it;  
and that so great an innovation might be found,  
in this respect, not to accord with the order and  
economy of nature?  
  
The relation of the animal part and the vege-  
table part of tle creation to each other, through  
the medium of the atmosphece, comes in aid of  
the reflections suggested by the general relation  
between the atmosphere and both. [t seems ta  
be now well understood, that the atmosphere  
when reapired by animals, becomes unfitted for  
their further use, and fitted for the absorption of  
vegetables; and that when evolved by the latter,  
it is refitted for the respiration of the former: an  
interchange being thus kept up, by which this  
breath of life is received by each, ina wholesome  
tate, in return for it in an unwhajesome one.  
  
May it not be concluded from this admirable  
arrangement and beautiful feature in the ecqno-  
my of nature, that if the whole class of animals  
were extinguished, the use of the atmosphere by  
  
the vegetable class alone would exhaust it of its||to the compact  
  
ife-supporting power; that, in like manner, if;  
the whole class of vegetables were extinguished,  
the use of it by the animal class, alone, would,  
deprive it of its fit essfor their support? And)  
if gych would be the effect of the entire destruc-|  
tion of either class, in relation to the other, the!  
  
erence seems to press itself upon us, that so  
vast a change in the proportions of each class to  
the other, and in the species ¢omposing the  
feapective classes, as that in question, might not

The immensity of the atmosphere, compared  
with the macs of animals and vegetables, forms:  
@n apparent objection only to this view of the  
@ubject. The comparison could at most suggest  
questions as to the period of time necessary to}  
exhaust the atmosphere of its uurenewed capaci-|

when deprived, either, of the support of the

to the imagination, when it is recollected that  
the immensity of the atmosphere is the effect of  
its elasticity and rarefaction. We know from the  
barometer, that condensed to the specific gravity  
of mercury, its rise above the surface of the earth  
would be byt about 30 inches; and from the well  
pump, that condensed to the specific gravity only  
af water, which is nearly the same with that of  
the human body, its rise would be little more  
than as many feet; that is, a little more than five  
times the human stature. It is found that a sin-  
a person employs in respiration not less  
  
sixteen-or eighteen times his own weight of

Were the earth in every productive snot, and  
in every spot capable of being made productive,  
appropriated to the food of man; were the  
substituted for the plough and all animals con  
suming the food of man, or food for which human  
food might be substituted, banished from exists

tion on the earth, there wonld be more than an  
hundred individuals, for every one now upon it.  
in the actual population of many countries, it  
brings on occasional epidemics to be traced to no  
other origin than the state of the atmosphere,  
Increase the numbers ten or twenty fold, andcan  
it be supposed that they would at any time find  
the breath of life in a condition to support it; ot  
if that supposition be admissable when limited to  
a single country, can it be admitted, when not on-  
ly the contiguous countries, but the whole earth  
was equally crowded.  
  
Must we then adopt the opinion entertained  
some philosophers, that no variation whateveri  
the numbers and proportions of the organized ber  
ings&#x27;belonging to our globe, is permitted by  
system of nature; that the number of species  
of individuals, in the animal and vegetable em-

ter organized and unorganized. He can, by the  
exercise of these peculiar powers, increase his  
subsistence, by which his numbers may be  
iacreasec! beyond the spontaneous supplies of na-  
ture: and it would be a reasonable conclusion,  
that, making, as he does, in his capacity of an in-  
telligent and voluntary agent end integral part of  
the terrestrial system, the other parts of the sys-  
tem are so framed as not to be altogether unsus-  
ceptible of his agency, and unpliable to its effects.  
  
This reasonable conclusion is confirmed by the  
fact, that the capacity of man, derived from his  
reason and his will, has effected an inorease of  
particular plants and animals conductive to an in-  
  
ase of his own race; and a diminution of the  
numbers if not of the species of plants and anitmals  
displaced by that increase. . %  
  
Most, if not all of our domesticated animals,  
  
robably exceed the numbers, which, without the  
intervention of man, would be their natural  
gmount. _ Whilst the animals preying on, or inter-  
fering with them, are proportionally reduced in  
their numbers  
  
The case is the same with cultivated plants,  
They are increased beyond their natural amount  
and banish, or proportionally reduce such as in-  
terfere with them.  
  
Nor can it be said that these changes, made by  
human art and industry in some regions, are ba-  
Janced by corresponding changes, made by nature,  
in other regions. Take, for examples, the arti-  
cles of wheat, rice, millet and maize, which are  
the chief food for civilized man, and which are  
now spread over such immense spaces. It is not  
possible to regard them as occupying no more  
than their original ‘and fixed proportions of the  
earth; and that in other parts of it they have dis-  
appeared in the same degree in which thev are  
thus artificially extended —These grains belong  
to the torrid and temperate zones only; and so  
great a portion of these zones have been —_  
ed, that it is certain they. could not have been  
displaced ffom other parts of the globe, in the de-  
gree in whith they abound where they are now  
cultivated, and where it is certain they owe their  
abundance to cultivation. There must conse-  
quently be an absolute increase of them produced  
by the agency of man.  
  
Take more particularly, for an example, the  
article of rice, which constitutes so latge a por-  
tion of human food. The lattitudes to which its  
o- is limited by the nature of the plant, are  
  
r the most part so well known, that it may be  
assumed for an unquestioned fact, that this grain  
cannot always have prevailed any where in the  
extent in which it is now cultivated. And it is  
equally certain, that the vegatable productions  
belonging to the same climates, which must have  
been displaced by its cultivation, dave not re-  
ceived an equivalent introduction and extension  
elsewhere,  
  
It is remarkable, that the vegetable productions&quot;  
most extensively used as human food, are butilittle,  
if at all, found in their indigenous state; whether  
that state be the same as tueir present one, or a  
state from which the same improvable into their  
present state. They seem, indeed, not likely to  
flourish extensively in situations not prep by  
the hand of man. The potatoe, so recently brought  
into use, and now spreading itself over so great a  
surface, can barely be traced to a native state in  
the mountains of Chili; nor can it be believed that  
previous to the aduption by man, it ever existed

in the extent to which cultivation is fow eatry:  
ing it. .  
  
These views of the subject seem to authorise  
the conclusion, that, although there is a propore  
tion between the animal aud vegetable classes of  
beings on our globe, and between the species in  
each class, with respect to which nature does pers  
mit such a change as would result from a destrucé  
tion of the animals and vegetables not used  
men: and a multiplication of the human tace,  
of the several species of animals and vegetables  
used by it, sufficient to fill up the void; yet, that  
there is a degree of change which the pectliag  
faculties of man enable him to make, and by make  
ing which his fund of subsistence, and his tum-  
bers, may be augmented; there being, at the  
same time, whenever his numbers, and the change  
exceed the admitted degree, a tendency in that  
excess to correct itself  
  
Could it, however, be supposed that the esta.  
blished system and symmetry of nature requi-  
red the number of human beings on the globe  
to be always the same; that the only change  
permitted in relation to them, was in their diss  
tribution over it, still, as the blessings ‘of exis.  
tence to that number would materially depend on  
the parts of the globe on which they may be  
thrown; on the degree in which their situation  
may be convenient or crowded; and on the nas  
ture of their political and social institutions, mds  
tives would not be wanting to obtain for our puts  
tion of the earth its fu:lest share, by improving  
the resources of human subsistence, accotding to  
the fair measure of its capacity. For, in w  
other portion’ of equal extent will be found clis  
mates more friendly to the health, or congenial  
to the feelings of its inhabitants? In what ¢  
a soil yielding mote food with not more labo  
And, above all, where will be found institutions  
equally securing the blessings of personal inde»  
mes orp of social enjoyment? The envia-  
  
le-condition of the vor od the United States  
is often too much ascribed to the physical ad-  
vantages of their soi] and climate, and to theif  
uncrowded situation. Much is certainly due to  
these causes—but a just estimate of the happi-  
ness of our country will never overlook what  
belongs to the fertile activity of a free people,  
and the benign influence of a responsible governs  
ment.  
In proportion as we relax the hypothesis which  
makes the aggregate number of mankind unsués  
ceptible of change, and believe that the tesouts  
ces of our country may not only contribute to the  
greater happiness of a given number, but to the  
augmentation of the number enjoying a | ae ad  
happiness, the motives betome stronger the  
improvement and extension of them. .

Among these promising institutions, I cannot  
glance at all the names of those composing tha:

full quota of information will be furnished to the  
general stock. 1 regret only, that my own com-  
petency bears so little proportion to my wishes  
to co-operate with them. That I may not be  
thought, however, deficient in good will, as well  
as in other requisites, 1 shall venture on the task,  
a task the least difficult, of pointing out some of  
the most prevalent errors in our husbandry, and  
which appear to be among those which may me-  
rit the attention of the society, and the instruc-  
tive examples of its members.  
  
1. The error first to be noticed, is that of cul-  
tivating land, either naturally poor or impover-  
ished by cultivation This ervor, like many  
others, is the effect of habit, continued after the  
reason for it has failed. Whilst there was an  
abundance of fresh and fertile soil, it was the in-  
terest of the oultivator to spread his labor over  
as great a surface as he could. Land being cheap  
and labor dear, and the land co-operating power  
fully with the labor, it was profitable to draw as  
much as possible from the land. Labor is now  
comparatively cheaper and land dearer. » Where  
labor has risen in price fourfold, land his msen  
tenfold. It might be profitable, therefore, now  
to contract the surface over which labor is spread,  
even if the soil retain its ‘reshness and fertility.  
But this is not the case. Much of the fertile soil  
is exhausted, and unfertile soils are brought into  
cultivation; and both co-operating less with la-  
bor in producing the crop, it is necessary, to con-  
sider how far labor can be profitably exerted on  
them; whether it ought not to be applied towards  
making them fertile, rather than in further im-  
poverishing them,. or whether it might not be  
more profitably applied to the mechanical occu-  
pations, or to domestic manufactures?  
  
In the old countries of Europe, where labor is  
cheap and land dear, the object is to augment la-  
bor, and contract the space on which it is em-  
ployed. ‘In the new settlements taking place in  
this country, the original practice here may be  
rationally pursued. © In the old settlements, the  
réason for the practice in Europe is becoming  
daily less inapplicable; and we ought to yield to  
the change of circumstances, by forbearing to  
waste our labor on land which, besides not pay-  
ing for it, is still more impoverished, and render-  
ed more difficult to be made rich. The crop  
which is of least amount gives the blow most  
- mortal to the soil. It has not been a very rare  
thing to see land under the plough, not producing  
enough to feed the ploughman and his horse;  
and it is in such cases that the death-blow is giv-  
en. The goose is kilied without even obtaining  
the coveted egg.  
  
There cannot be a more rational principle in  
the code of agriculture, than that every farm  
  
which is in good heart, should be kept so; tha‘)  
  
every One not in good heart should be made so:  
and that what is right as to the farm, generally.  
is so as to every’part of every farm. Any system,  
therefore, or want of system, which tends to  
_ make a rich farm poor, or does not tend to make  
a&quot;poor farm rich, cannot be good for the owner;  
whatever it may be for the tenant or superintend-  
ent, who has transient interest only init. The  
  
rofit, where there is any, will not balance the  
08s of intrinsic value sustained by the land

has also been much increased by the bad mode of  
ploughing it. Shallow ploughing, and ploughi  
up and down hilly land, have, by exposing the  
loussened soil to be carried off by rains, hs

soon produce a like effect, notwithstanding the  
improved practice of deeper ploughing. How  
have the beauty and value of this red ridge of  
country guffered from this cause? And how muck  
is due to the happy improvement introduced by  
u member of this society, whom I need not name*  
by a cultivation in horizontal drills, with a ploy  
adapted to it? Had the practice prevailed from  
the first settlement of the country, the general  
fertility would have been more than the double  
  
  
  
of what the red hiils, and indeed all other hilly  
lands, now possess; and the scars and sores now,  
defucing them would no where be seen.  
pily, experience is proving, that this remedy, aided  
by a more rational management in other res  
is adequate to the purpose of healing what hag  
been wounded, as well as of preserving the  
health of what has escaped the calamity. oft ig

ing rains, is probably exceeded by that of no up.  
lands whatever; and without that advantage, they  
are excee:led in value by almost all other. They  
are little more than a lease for years.  
  
Besides the inestimable advantage from hori. -  
zontal ploughing, in protecting the soil against  
the wasting effect of rains, there is a great ore  
in its preventing the rains themselves from being  
lost to the crop. ‘he Indian corn is the crop  
which exposes the svil to be carried off by the  
rains: aud it is, at the’ same time, the crop  
which most needs them. Where the iand is not  
only hilly, but the soil thirsty, (as it is particular.  
ly throughout this mountainous range) the pre-  
servation of the rain as it falls, between the drill-  
ed ridges, is of peculiar importance; and its gra-  
dual sending downwards to the roots, is the best  
possible mode of supplying them mith moisture.  
  
In the old method of ploughing shallow, with  
the furrows up and down, the rain as well as the  
soil was lost, ~

which claims particular noticé.  
ced to the same cause with our excessive crops

was more convenient, and more profitable, to  
bring new land into cultivation, than to improve  
exhausted land. The failure of new land has  
  
habit has kept us deaf to the call.  
  
= Nothing is more certain than that continual  
cropping, without manure, deprives the soil  
its fertility, It is equally certain that fertility ma  
be preserved or restofed, by giving to the  
animal or vegetable manure, equivalent to.the  
matter taken from it; and that a perpetual fortil-  
ty is not, in itself, incompatible with an uninter-  
rupted succession of crops. The Chinese, it is  
said, smile at the idea, that land needs rest, as if,  
like animals, it had asense of fatigue —Their soil

made of every fertilizing particle that can contri-  
bute towards replacing what has been drawn  
from it. And this is the more practicable with  
them, as almost the whole of what is grown on  
their farms, is consumed within them. That a  
restoration to the earth of all that annually grows  
on it, prevents its impoverishment, is sufficiently  
seen in our forests, where the annual exuvie of  
the trees and plants, replace the fertility of which  
they deprive the earth. Where frequent fires  
destroy the leaves, and whatever else is annually  
dropped on the earth, it is well known that land  
becomes poorer. This destruction of the natu-  
ral crop having the same impoverishing effect as  
a removal of a cultivated crop. A still stronger  
  
roof that an annual restoration to the earth of  
all its annual product will perpetuate its produc-  
tiveness, is seen where our fields are Jeft uncul-  
tivated and unpastured In this case, the soil  
receiving from the decay of the spontaneous  
weeds and grasses more fertility than they extract  
from it, is for atime at least improved, not impo-  
verished. Its ithprovement may be explained, by  
the fertilizing matter which the weeds and grass-  
es derive from water and-the atmosphere, which  
forms a nett gain to the earth. At what point or  
from what cause the formation and accumulation  
of vegetable mould from this gain ceases, is not,  
perhaps, very easy to be explained. ‘That it does  
cease, is proved by the stationary condition of  
the surface of the earth in old forests; and that  
the amount of the accumulation varies with the  
nature of the subjacent earth is equally certain.  
It seems to depend also, on the species of trees  
and plans which happen to contribute the mate-  
rials for the vegetable mould.  
  
But the most eligible mode of preserving the  
richness, and of enriching the poverty, of a farm  
is certainly that of applying to the soil a sufficien-  
cy of annual and vegetable matter in a putrified  
state, or a state ready for putrefaction; in order  
to procure which, too much care cannot be ob-  
served in saving every material furnished by the  
farm. This resource was among the earliest dis-  
coveries of men living by agriculture; and a pro-  
per use of it has been made a test of geod hus-  
bandry, in all countries, ancient and modern,  
where&#x27;its principles and profits have been stu-  
died. ” &#x27;  
  
Some farmers of distinction, headed by Tull,  
supposed that mere earth, in a pulverized state,  
was sufficient without manure for the growth of  
  
lants; and consequently that continued pulver-  
ization would render the soil perpetually pro-  
ductive; a theory which never would have oc-  
curred to a plaater of tobacco or of Indian corn,  
who finds the soil annually producing less and  
less, under a constant pulverizing course. ‘The  
known experiment of Van Helmont seemed to  
favor the opposite theory, that the earth parted  
with nothing towards the plants growing on it  
If there were no illusion in the case, the éarth  
used by him must’ at least have been destitute  
of vegetable mould: for in an experiment by  
Woodhouse, a garden mould was diminished in  
its weight by a plant which grew in it. And the  
  
_latest chemical examination of the subject coin-  
cides with the general opinion of practical hus-  
bandmen, that the substance of plants partakes of  
the substance of the soil.  
  
The idea is indeed very natural that vegetable  
matter which springs from the earth, and of it

self-returns to the earth, should be one source at  
least of the earth’s capacity to re-produce vegeta-  
ble matter.  
  
It has heen asked, how it happens that Egypt  
and Sicily, which have for ages been export-  
ing their agricultural ‘produce, without a re-  
turn of any equivalent produce, have not lost  
their reproductive capacity. One answer has  
been, that they have lust no small degree of it.  
If the fact be otherwise with regard to Egypt, it  
might be accounted for by the fertilizing inun-  
dations -of the Nile. With regard to Sicily,  
there may be something in the system of hus-  
bandry, or some particular local circumstances,  
which countervail the continued asportation of  
the fruits of the soil. But it is far more probable  
that the island is less productive than it once  
was. It is certainly less of a grannary for other  
countries now than it was when it received that  
title from the ancient Romans. And its popula-  
tion being diminished, the internal consumption  
must also be diminished. If a single farm is ren-  
dered less productive, by a continued removal of  
its crops, without any adequate returns, no rea-  
son occurs why it should not happen to a num-  
ber of farms multiplied to the extent of a whole  
country.  
  
And that individual farms do lose their fertility,  
in proportion as crops are taken from them, and  
returns of the manure neglected, is a fact not  
likely to be questioned.  
  
If it were, Virginia, unfortunately,’ is but too  
capable of fvrmshing the proofs. Her prevail-  
ing crops have been very exhausting, and the  
use of manure has been particularly neglected.  
  
Tobacco and Indian corn, which, for a long  
time, on the east side of the Blue Mountains,  
were the articles almost exclusively cultivated,  
and which continue to be cultivated, the former  
extensively, the latter universally, are known to  
be great impoverishers of the soil Wheat, which  
has for a number of years, formed a large portion  
of the general crop, is also an exhausting crop.  
So are rye and oats, which enter occasionally into  
our farming system.  
  
With so many consumers of the fertility of the  
earth, and so little attention to the means of re-  
pairing their ravages, no one can be surprised at  
the impoverished face of the country; whilst eve-  
ry one ought to be desirous of aiding in the  
work of reformation. :  
  
The first and main step towards it is to make  
the thieves restore as much as possible of the  
stolen fertility. On this, with other improve-  
ments which may be made in our husbandry, we  
must depend for the rescue of our farms from  
their present degraded condition.  
  
Of tobacco, not a great deal more than one  
half of the entire plant is carried to market.  
The residue is an item on the list of manures;  
and it is known to be in its quality &amp; very rich  
one. The crop of tobacco, however, though of  
great value, covers but a small propartee of our  
cultivated ground; and its offal can, of course,  
contribute but inconsiderably to the gene  
stock of manure. It is probable, also, that what  
it does contribute has been more carefully used  
as a manure than any&#x27;other article furnished by  
our crops.  
  
The article which constitutes our principal  
manure is wheat straw. It is of much impor-  
tance, therefore, te decide aright on the mode of

using it. There are three modes. 1. bgt hm. |  
it from the farm yard; after having passe  
  
through, or being trodden and enriciied by cat-  
tle. In that mode, the greater part of it must be  
used, if used at all; the straw going through that  
  
being a necessary part of the foo allot  
  
ted to the cattle. To derive the full advantage  
from it, it ought to be hauled out before the  
substance has been wasted by rain, by the sun,  
and by the wind; and&#x27;to be buried in the earth  
as soon after as possible.&quot; 2. Spreading the straw  
on the surface of the ground. Many respectable  
farmers are attached to this mode, as protecting  
the soil from the sun; and, by keeping it moist,  
favoring the vegetation underneath, whether  
spontaneous or artificial; whilst the straw itself  
is gradually decomposed into a marure. The ob  
jection to this mode, is the loss by evaporation,  
before this last effect is obtained. 3. Turning  
the straw at onte under the surface of the earth.  
This woujd seem to be the best mode of manag-  
ing manures generally; least of their substance  
being then lost. When the grain is trodden out  
from the straw it is left in a state easily admit-  
ting this operation. Some difficulty may attend  
it when the grain is threshed from the straw  
by the flail, or by the machines now in use,  
neither of which break the sraw sufficiently to  
pieces.  
  
It may be remarked, with regard to this article  
of manure—1. That its weight is barely more  
than that of the grain. 2. That the grain is the  
  
art which makes the greatest draft on the ferti-  
  
fity of the earth. 3. That the grain is for the  
most part not consumed within the farm It is  
found on trial, that a stock of wheat, as generally  
cut, including the chaff, and the grains borne by  
the stalk are pretty nearly of equal weight. The  
case is probably the same with rye, and, not very  
different with oats. The proportion of fertilizing  
matter in the straw to that in the grain, has not  
as far as I know, been brought to any satisfacto.  
ry test. Itis, doubtless, much less in the straw,  
which alone, in the case of wheat, is with us  
returnable in any form to the earth. This con-  
sideration, whilst it urges us to make the most of  
the article as a manure, warns us of its insuffi-  
eiency.  
The stubble, and the roots of the small grains,  
siot being taken from the earth, may be regard-  
ed as relapsing into a ens | equal to that of  
which they deprive the earth. This remark is  
applicable to all cultivated plants, the roots of  
which are not an escuJent part.  
  
_ Aneminent citizen and celebrated agriculturist*  
of this state, has among other instructive lessons,  
called the public attention to the value of the  
corn-stalk, as 2 manure. I am persuaded that he  
has not overrated it. And it is a subject of  
  
le reflection, that an article which is so  
extensively cultivated as that of Indian corn, and  
which is so particularly exhausting, should be  
the one so capable repairing the injury it  
does, The corn-stalk, as a fodder, is of great  
value. Not only the leaves, but the husk en-  
closing the ear, and the cob enclosed by it, are  
all more or ‘less valuable food when duly preser-  
ved and dealt out to cattle. There is no better  
fodder than_the leaves or blades for horses and  
oxén; hor any so much approved for sheep.  
The husk or shuck is a highly nourishing food  
for neat cattle. And the pickings of the stalk,

even at a late season, and after much exposure  
to the weather, support thenrbetter than any of  
the straws. From the saccharine matterin the  
stalk, which is long retained about the joints,  
it cannot be doubted, that if cut early, or  
before exposure to the weather, into  
  
small enough fot mastication, it would well re-  
pay, as a food for cattle, the labor required fur  
it. ;  
The great value of the corn-stalk, in all its  
parts, as a fodder, was brought into full proof,  
by the use made of it during the late general faix  
lure of crops. It is to be hoped that the lesson  
will not be suffered to pass into oblivion.  
  
But it is as a resource for fertilizing the soil  
that the corn-stalk finds the proper place here;  
and as such it merits particular notice, whether  
it be passed through animals or be prepared by  
fermentation in the farm yard, or be merely  
spread on the surface of the earth, the mode -in  
which its effects must be least considerable,  
The same qualities which render every part of  
it nutricious to animals render it nutricious to the  
earth; and it is accompanied with the peculiar  
advantages—1. That the grain itself is mostly  
every where, and altogether in places distant  
from navigation, consumed within the farms pro-  
ducing it. 2. That as the grain is in greater pro-  
portion to the space on which it grows than most  
other grains, so the rest of the plant is in great-  
  
er proportion to the grain than the rest of any.  
  
other grain plant. The straw and chaff of the  
smaller grains, as already remarked, is, in weight,  
but about one half of the grain. The corn-stalk,  
with all its appurtenant offal, is of not less than  
three times, and, if taken early from the field,  
probably of not less than four or five times the  
we&#x27;ght of the grain belonging to it. 3. The fer.  
tilizing matter contained in the corn-stalk is  
greater in proportion to its weight, than that  
contained in the straw and offal of other grains,  
is to the weight . f the straw and offal.  
  
Would it be hazarding too much to say, that  
where a level surface, or the mode of cultivating  
a billy one, prevents the rain from carrying off the  
soil, a restoration of an entire crop of Indian corn,  
in the ferm of manure, to the space producing it  
(there being no other intervening crop not so  
restored) would replace the fertility consumed by  
the crop, and maintain a perpetual productive-  
ness? Reason the case of forest and fallow fields,  
where the spontaneous crop falls back of itself to  
the earth, and the Chinese example, where the  
cultivated crop is restored to the earth, all pro-  
nounce that such would be the effect. And yet  
the fact stares us in the face, that our most im-  
poverished fields, even the most level of them,  
owe their condition more to the crop of Indian  
corn than to any other crops.  
  
The cotton plant, which isso extensive a cro  
in the more southern and south western states, is  
but little cultivated in Virginia, and scarcely at all  
in this part of it. Iam not able to say how far it  
is comparatively an exhausting crop. But it would  
seem to be more capable than any crop not wholl  
consumed within the farm, of preserving its fertili-  
ty. The only part of the plant carried away is the  
cotton fibre, or woolly part, which bears an incon-  
siderable proportion to the other parts in weight,  
and, as may be inferred, in fertalizing matter also.  
The seed, alone, passing “by the ball and the  
haulm, is of three times its weight, and contains  
the chief part of the oil in the plant. In the

es where cotton makes the principal part  
rena fat the superfluous seed must deserve  
great attention as a manure. Where the fields  
are level, or cultivated in horizontal drills, it might  
far towards supporting a continued cropping,  
without a diminished fertility. 5 ee  
The sum of these remarks on cultivating poor  
land, and neglecting the means of keeping or  
making land rich, is, that if every thing grown on  
. a soil is‘ carejed from it, it must become unpro-  
ductive. That if every thing grown on it be di-  
‘ rectly or indirectly restored to it, it would not  
cease to be productive; and, consequently, that,  
according to the degree in whtch the one or the  
other practise takes place, a farm must be impo-  
verished, or be permanently productive and pro  
fitable. Every acre made by an improved ma-  
nagement to produce as much as two acres, is 1.  
effect the addition of a new acre, with the great  
advantages of contracting the space to be cultivat-  
ed, and of shorteving the distance of transporta-  
tion between the fields and the barn or the farm  
yard. One of the Roman writers* on husbandry,  
enforces the obligation to an improving manage.  
ment, by a story of one Parydius, who had two  
daughters and a vineyard; when the elder was  
married he gave her a third part of the vineyard,  
notwithstanding which he obtained from two-  
thirds the same crop as from the whole. When  
his other daughter was married, he portioned  
her with the half of what remained; and still the  
produce of his vineyard was undiminished. ‘Ihe  
story, short as it is, contains a volume of instruc-  
tion.  
The plaster or gypsum, though not a manure  
within the farm itself, has been too long neglect-  
ed as a fertilizing source. It is now beginning to  
take a high and just rank as such. The proofs  
of its efficacy are as incontestible as the causes of  
it are obscure. The experiments of a very dis-  
tinguished chemist,t led him to the opinion that  
its substance enters into the’substance of the  
plant. Without doubting the fact, it does not suf-  
ficiently account for the addition made to the  
size and weight of the plant, which greatly exceed  
the quantity of the plaster. It must therefore  
have some further mode of operating. Whether  
it be by neutralizing some noxious ingredient in  
the earth, one of the modes by which lime is sup-  
posed to operate; or by attracting and conveying  
to the ope food from the earth, the air, or wa-  
ter, or by exciting the plant to a more active use  
of its feeding powers, whatever they be; or by its  
eccretion and assimilation to the particular parts  
\ of plants on which these powers depend; thereby  
augmenting and strengthening those particular

of the earth—The period of time necessary for  
the purpose, may be uncertain, but that, as in the  
case of other mineral manures, lime and marie,  
such must sooner or later be the result, cannot  
well beso. The effect. of pulvetizing the earth  
by tillage, as practised by Tull, is stated to have  
been uninterrupted crops of wheat, without ma-  
nure, for more than twenty years; which was re-  
garded as a demonstration that tillage was a com-  
plete substitute for manure Supposing the state.  
ment to be free from error, the inference is cer-  
tainly not warranted by the fact. We know that  
some of our soils, not naturally richer than the  
highly manured soils on which. Tull probably  
commenced his tillage, will bear a succession of  
crops for an equal period; and we know as well  
that their fertility will not hold out forever. How  
long plaster, whatever be its mode of operation;  
will hold out, may not yet have been fully tried.  
But to make it permanently successful, it will be  
wise to take for granted, that it must be made a  
source of future manure, as well as of immediate  
productiveness. If the crop, as augmented by  
the plastcr, be given back to the soil, the soil may  
be benefitted more than it would be, by the retura  
ofa crop not augmented by the plaster. And ia  
this way fertility may be accellerated. The re-  
storation ofacrop increased by ordinary cultivation  
to the soil on which it grew, would, [ presume,  
fertilize it more than the restoration of a smailer  
crop spontaneously produced; although in botiz  
cases the whole taken from the soil would retura  
to it.  
  
4. Among the means of aiding the productive-  
ness of the soil, which have not received merited  
attention, is irrigation. In scarcely any coun  
does this resource abound more than in the United  
States; nor is there any where there is so little sen-  
sibility to its value. The inconsiderable use made  
of it is chiefly by emigrants, particularly Gérmans,  
orthe immediate descendants of them. 1 have  
understood that the market of Baltimore has been  
much benefitted in dry seasons by the irrigation  
introduced by exiles from St. Domingo. Fora  
distinguished = of the importance of the prac-  
tise, I may refer to the fact which has been stated,  
that, in the neighborhood of Barcelona, in Spain,  
where a part of the land is under irrigation, anda  
part is not susceptible of it, both being otherwise  
of equal fertility, the part irrigated is of double  
price in the market. Itis to be noted, indeed,  
that the climate is.a dry one, and that the article  
cultivated is lucerne. But this is a plant, which,  
though much aided in its growth by moisture, is  
at the same time remarkable for the length of a  
tap root; and fitted by that, as well as by the ab-  
sorbent qualities of its lewes, to flourish in a  
thirsty soil, and warm climate. Our particular  
district of country, abounding in springs, small  
streams, and suitable declivites, admits greatly of  
irrigation; and being generally of a thirsty nature,  
the more strongly invites the use of it. 5  
  
{cannot but consider it an error in our hus-  
bandry, that oxen are too little used in place of  
horses.  
  
Every fair comparison of the expense of the  
two animals, favors a preference of the ox. ‘But  
the circumstance particularly recommending him  
is, that he can be supported when at work b  
grass and hay, whilst the horse requires grain “a  
much of it, and the grain generally given him In-  
dian corn, the crop which requires mos§ labor,  
and greatly exhausts the land:  
  
  
  
138  
  
From the hest estimate I have been enabled to  
form, more than one half of the corn crop is con-  
sumed by horses, including the ungrown ones:  
and not te than one half by other than pleasure  
horses. By getting free from this consumption,  
one half the labor and of the wear of the land  
Would he saved, or rather more than one half;  
for on most farms, one half of the crop of corn  
grows on not more than two-fifths, and sometimes  
a simaller proportion, of the cultivated fields; and  
the more fertile fields would of course be retained  
for cultivation. Every ‘one can figure to himself  
the ease and conveniency of a revolution which  
would so much reduce the extent of cornfields;  
and substitute, for the labor bestowed on them,  
the more easy task of providing pasturage and  
hay.  
  
But will not the ox himself, when kept at Ia.  
bor, require grain food as well as the horse?  
Certainly much less, ifany. Judging from my  
own observation, E should say, that a plenty of  
good grass or good hay, would suffice without  
grain, where the labor is neither constant nor se-  
vere. But, I feel entire confidence in saying, that  
double set of oxen, alternately at work, and, there-  
fore, half the time:at rest, might be kept in good  
plight, without other food than plenty of good  
grass or good hay. And this double set would  
tlouble the supply of beef tallow and leather, a  
set-off is found in that consideration for a double  
consumption of that kind of food.  
  
The objections generally made to the ox, are, 1.  
&quot;That he is less tractable than the horse. 2, What  
he does not bear heat as well. 3. That he does  
not answer for the single plough used in our corn-  
fields. 4 That he is slower in his movements.  
5. That he is less fit for carrying the produce of  
the farm to market.  
  
‘The first objection is certainty founded in mis-  
take. Of the two animals, the ox is the more do-  
eile. In all countries where the ox is the ordin-  
ary draught animal, his docility is proverbial.  
His intractability, where it exists, has arisen from  
a) occasional nse of bim only with long and ivre  
gular intervals; during which, the habit of discip-  
tine being broken, a new one is to be form  
ec.  
  
The 2d objection has as little foundation. The  
constitution of the ox accommo:lates itself as rea-  
dily as that of the horse, to different climates. Not  
only in ancient Greece and Italy, but throughout  
Asia, as presented to us in ancient history, the ox  
and the plough are associated- At this day, in  
the warm parts of India and China, the ox, not  
the horse, is in the draught service. In every  
part of India, the ox always appears, even in the  
  
rain of her armics. Andin the hottest parts of  
the West Indias, the ox is employed in hauling  
the’ weighty produce to the sea-ports. The mis.  
take here, as inthe former case, has arisen from  
the effect of an occasional employment only, with  
no other than green food. The fermentation of  
this in the animal, heated by the weather and fret-  
ted by the discipline, will readily account for his  
sinking under his exertions; when green food  
even, much less dry, with a sober habit of labor,  
would have no such tendency.  
  
The 3d objection also is not asolidone. The  
ox can, by a proper harness, be used singly as well  
as the horse, between the rows of Indian corn;  
and equally so used for other purposes. F.xpe-  
  
rience may he safely appealed to on this point  
ty the 4th place it is alleged, that he is slower

in his movements. This is true, but in a less de.  
gree than is often taken for granted. Oxen that  
are well chosen for their form, are not worked  
after ythe age of about eight years, (the age  
at which they are best fitied for beef,) are not  
worked too many together, and are suitably match.  
ed, may be kept to nearly as quick a step as the  
horse—may [ not say a step quicker than that of  
many of the horses we see at work, who,.on ac.  
count of their age, or leanness, occasioned by the  
costliness of the food they require, loose this ad.  
vantage, where they might have once had it?  
  
The last objection has most weight. The ox ig  
not as well adapted as the horse to the road ser.  
vice, especially for long trips. In common roads,  
which are often soft, and sometimes suddenly be-  
come so, the form of his toot and the shortness of  
his leg, are disadvantages; aid on roads frozen or  
turnpiked, the roughness of the surface in the for.  
mer case, and fs hardness in both cases, are in-  
convenient to his cloven hoof. But, where the  
distance to market is not great, where varying  
state of the roads and of the weather can be con.  
sulted; and the road service is in less propor.  
tion to the farm service, the objection is almost  
deprived of its weight. In cases where it most  
applies, its weiglt is diminished by the considera.  
tion, that a much greater proportion of service  
on the farm may be done by oxen than is now  
commonly done; and that the expense of shoeing  
them is little different from that of keeping  
horses shod. It is observable, that, when oxen  
are worked ona farm, over rough frozen ground,  
they suffer so much from the want of shoes, how-  
ever well fed they may be, that it isa proper  
subject for calculation whether true economy does  
not require for thera that accommodation, even on  
the farm, as well as for the horses.  
  
A more important calculation is, whether, in  
many situations, the general saving, by substitut-  
ing the ox for the horse, would not balance  
the expense of hiring the carriage of the  
produce to market. In the same scale with the  
hire is to be put the value of the grass and hay  
consumed by the oxen; and in the other scale,  
the value of the corn, amounting to one half of  
the crop, and the grass and hay con-umed by  
the horses. Where the market is not distant,  
the value of the corn saved would certainly pay  
for the carriage of tae market portion of the crop  
and balance, moreover, any difference between  
the value of the grass and hay consumed by oxen,  
and the value of the oxen when slaughtered for  
beef. In all these calculations, it is doubtless  
proper not to loose sight of the rule, that farmers  
ought to avoid paying others for doing what they  
can do for themselves. But, the rule has its ex-  
ceptions; and the error, if it be committed,  
will not lie in departing from the rule, but  
in not selecting aright the cases which call  
for the @eparture. It may be remarked, that  
the rule ought to be more or less general, as  
there may or may not be at hand a market,  
by which every produce of labor is converti-  
ble into money. In the old countries this is  
much more the case than in new; and in new,  
much more the case near towns than at a distance  
from them In this, as in most other parts of our  
country, a ques of circumstances is taking  
place, which renders every thing raised on a farm  
more convertible into mouey than formerly; and  
as the change proceeds, it will be more and more  
a point for consideration, how far the laber in

doing what. might be bought, could earn more in  
another way, than the amount of the purchase.  
Still, it will always be prudent, for reasons which  
every experienced farmer will understand, to lean  
to the side of doing, rather than hiring or buying  
what may be wanted.  
  
The mule seems to be, in point of economy, be-  
tween the ox and the horse; preferable to the  
latter, infertor to the former; but so well adapted  
to particular services, that he may find a proper  
place on many farms. He is liable to the objec-  
tion which weighs most against the ox—he is les:  
fitted than the horse for road service.  
  
5. A more manifest error in the husbandry of  
the older settlements is, that of keeping too many  
neat cattle on their farms. Asa farm should not  
be cultivated farther than it can be continued in  
good heart, the stock of cattle should not be in  
greater number than the resources of food will  
keep in good plight. If a poor farm be unprofita-  
ble, so are poor cattle. It is particularly the case  
with the milch cows. When the whole of the  
food given them is necessary to snpport a lean  
existence, no part can be spared for the milk pail.  
The same food given to the proper number, will  
only keep them in a thrifty state, but unable them  
to supply the dairy. Even the manure from se-  
veral poor cattle is worth less than that from a  
single fat one. The remark holds equally good  
with respect to the hide.  
  
The misjudged practice in question, is another  
effect of inattention to the change of circumstances  
through which our country has passed. Original  
ly, the forest abounded in rich herbage, which  
fed and fatted, without expense, all the cattle that  
could be brought through the winter into the  
spring It was natural at that time to keep as  
large a stock as could be preserved through the  
winter. For a long time past, the forest is scarce-  
ly any where a resource for more than twv or  
three months; and in many places, no resource at  
all. A greater difficulty is often felt in finding  
summer, than winter snbsistence. And yet where  
no enclosed pasturage is provided to take the  
piace ofthe extinct one in the forest, the habit,  
founded in reasons which have entirely ceased, is  
but too generally retained. ‘Whe same number  
of cattle is aimed at, as if the forest was as ready  
to receive and fatten them now as formerly. The  
size and appearance of ourneat cattle compared  
with those for which nature or good ,busbandry  
has provided sufficient food, are proofs that their  
food is not in proportion to their number, and that  
where the food cannot be increased, the number  
ought to be reduced.  
  
6. Of all the errors in our rural economy none  
is perhaps so much to be regretted, because none  
is so difficult to be repaired, as the injudicious and  
excessive destruction of timber and firewood. It  
seems never to have occured that the fund was  
not inexhaustible, and that a crop of trees could  
not be raised as quickly as ene of wheat or corn  
  
Here again we are presented with a proof of  
the continuance of a practice for which the rea  
sons have ceased. When our ancestors arrived,  
they found the trees of the forest the great ob.  
stacle to their settlement and cultivation. The  
great effort was of course to destroy the trees  
it would seem that they contracted and transmitted  
an antipathy to them: for the trees were not even  
spared around the dwellings, where their shade  
would have been a comfort, and their beauty an  
eraament; and it is of late years only, that these

advantages have been attended te. In fact, such  
‘jas been the inconsiderate and indiscriminate use  
of the axe, that this country is beginning to feel  
‘he calamity as much as some of the old countries  
of Europe: and it will soon »e forced to under~  
stand the difficulty of curing it. A vast proverties  
of the farms on the eastern side of the Blue Ridge,  
and some even on the other side, have but a scan-  
ty fund for present use, and are without a fund for  
»ermanent use. And to increase the evil, the  
remnant of timber and fuel on many farms, inade&gt;  
quate as it is, is left in situations remote from the  
dwelling, and incapable of being divided, accord-  
ing to the divisions and subdivisions into which  
all the larger farms must be rapidly forced by the  
law of descents, the impulse of parental affection,  
and other &lt;auses.  
  
{It is high time for many farmers even in this  
quarter, and still more so in the country below us,  
to take this subject into serious consideration.  
Prud:nce will no longer delay to economize what  
remains of wondland; to foster the second growths  
where taken place in convenient spots; and to  
commence, where necessary, plantations of the  
trees recommended by their utility and quickness

proportion of woodland which ought to belong. to -  
every farm, asa permanent fund of timber for  
building and repairing houses; -for fences, where  
live or stone ones may not be introduced; for  
wheel carriages, and the other apparatus needed  
on farms. ‘The estimate is the more difficult, be-  
cause it must be varied according to many circum-  
stances, particularly, according to the nature of  
the soil and the kind of trees at once suited to it,  
and to the uses to be made of them Estimating  
the crop of wood yielded by an acre at twenty  
cords, the period of production at twenty years,  
and the average number of cords annuaily con-  
sumed at a fireplace, including the culinary con-  
sumption, at ten cords; every fire place on a farm  
will require ten acres for a permanent supply of  
fuel. For the other necessities of a farm several  
acres more ought to be added.  
  
An estimate in a very sensible publication, en-  
titled “Fhe New England Farmer,” makes seven-  
teen acres necessary for a fireplace. ‘he winters  
there are longer, and the climate may be less fa-  
vorable to the quick growth of trees. But their  
houses are generally closer than with us; to say

It having pleased the society to name me for  
their presiding member, I feel it a duty, on my  
first appearing among you, to repeat my acknow-  
ledgments for that honourary distinction ; with  
the assurances of my sincere desire to promote  
the success of an establishment, which has in view  
ro valuable an object as that of improving the  
agriculture of our country.  
  
The faculty of culivating the earth, and of  
Fearing animals, by which food is increased be-  
yond the spontaneous supplies of nature, belongs  
to man alone. No other terrestrial being has re-  
ceived a higher gift, than an insWinct, like that of  
the beaver or the ant, which merely hoards for  
future use, the food spontaneously furnished by  
nature.  
  
As this peculiar faculty gives to man a pre-emi-  
mence over irrational animals, so it is the use  
made of it by some, and the neglect of it by  
other commonities, that distinguish them from  
each other, in the most important features of the  
human character.  
  
The contrast between the enlightened and re-  
fined nations on some parts of the earth, and the  
rude and wretched tribes on others, Las its foun-  
dation in this distinction, CivilizatiOn is never  
seen without agriculture ; nor has agriculture  
ever prevailed, where the civilized arts did not  
make their appearance.  
  
But closely as agriculture and civilization are  
allied, they do not keep pace with each other.—-  
There is probably a much bigher state of agricul-  
tare in China and Japan, than in many other coun-  
tries far more advanced in the improvements of  
civilized life. Itis surely no small reproach to ths

| wnd in the fuller possession of the auxiliary arts,  
  
they should suffer themselves to be oatstripped  
in the very art by which both are essentially dis-  
tinguished from the brute creation.  
  
It must not be inferred, however, from the capa-  
cities and the motives of man, for an artificial in-  
crease of the productions of the earth, that the  
transition from the hunter, or even the herdsman’s  
state, to the agricultural, is a matter of course.  
The first steps in this transition are attended with  
difficulty, and what is more, with disinclination.  
  
Without a knowledge of the metals, and the  
implements made of them, the process of opening  
and stirring the soil, is not an easy operation ;  
  
ithongh one perhaps not requiring more effort and  
‘contrivance, than produced the instruments used  
by savages in war and in the chase,  
  
And that there is a disinclination in human na-  
ture to exchange the savage four the civilized life,  
cannot be questioned. We need not look for  
proofs beyond our own neighbourhood. ‘The In-  
dian tribes have ever shewn an aversion to the  
change. Neither the persnasive examples of  
plenty and comfort, derived from the cullare of  
the earth by their white brethren, nor the lessons  
and specimens of tillage placed in the midst of  
them, and seconded by actual sufferings from 2a  
deficient and precarious subsi-ience, have con-  
  
&#x27;verted them from their strong propensities and  
habitual pursuits. In the same spirit, they al-  
| ways betray an anxious disposition to return to  
| their pristine life, after being weaned from it by  
‘time, and apparently moulded by intellectual and  
moral instruction, into the habits and tastes of an  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
agricultural people. A still more conclusive evi-  
dence of the bias of human nature is seen in the  
‘familiar fact, that our own people, nursed and  
reared in these habits and tastes, easily slide into  
those of the savage, and are rarely reclaimed to  
civilized society with their own consent.  
  
Had the Europeans, on their arrival, found  
this continent Westitute of human inhabitants,  
whose dangerous neighbourhood kept them in a  
compact and agricultural state, and had their com-  
  
# munication with the countries they left been dis-  
  
continued, they might have spread themselves  
into the forests where game and fruits would have  
abounded ; and gradually forgetting the arts no  
longer necessary to their immediate wants, have  
degenerated into savage tribes.  
  
An admired historian,* in his inquiry into the  
origin of the American savages, represents any  
such degeneracy as impossible. He lays it down  
‘8a certain priociple, that the necessary arts of  
life, when once introduced among a people, can  
never be lost ; that the dominion over inferior  
animiils once enjoyed, will never be abandoned ;  
  
  
  
| peopled from a country as uncivilized as itself.  
| Yet he derives the American savages, generally,  
‘from. the Tartars, whose example must have  
taught them the nse of certain animals, for which  
a substitute might have been found in the bison  
or buffalo at least, (the same animal with the cow)  
lif not in the elk, the moose, of the « araboo : and  
| he regards the Esquimaux, a tribe distinguished,  
‘in several respects, for their rude condition, as  
descendants from the Greenlanders, (of the same  
modes of life with themselves,) who were a colo-  
ny from Norway, planted in the ninth century ;

ao epoch prior to which tue Norwegians had made  
such progress in the arts, as to be capable of for-  
midable marine expeditions. The Greenland co  
lony, therefore, must have undergone a degene-  
racy from the condition of its parent country.  
‘Vithout supposing the possibilty of a transition  
from a better state of human society to a savage  
state, how would the learued historian have ac  
counted for the introduction of the savage state at  
all ?  
  
The bent of human nature may be traced on  
the chart of our country. The manofacturer  
readily exchanges the loom for the ploagh, in op  
position often to his own interest, as well as to that  
of his country. The cultivator,in situations presen-  
ting an option, prefers to the labours of the field.  
the more easy employment of rearing a herd.  
And as the game of the forest.ts approached, the  
hunting life displays the force of its: attractions.  
Where do we behold a march to the opposite di-  
rection? ‘he hunter, becoming the herdsman ,  
the latter a follower of the plough ; and the last  
repairing to the manufactory or workshop.  
  
Such, indeed, is the fiscination of that person:  
independence which belongs to the uncivilized  
state, and such the disrelish and contempt of the  
monotonous labour of tillage, compared with the  
exciting occupations of the chase, or with the in-  
dolence enjoyed by those who subsist chiefly on  
the mere bounties of nature, or on their migratory  
  
flocks, that a voluntary relinquishment of these  
  
latter modes of life, is little to be expected. We  
certainly perceive nothing in the character of our  
savage neighbors, from which it could be inferred  
that even the germs of agriculture, observed in  
their spots of maize, and a few other culiivated  
plants, would ever be developed into the extent  
implied by an agricultural life. To that little re-  
source, combined with the game furnished by the  
forest and by the lake or the stream, their popn-  
There may be  
  
canse it is commensurate with their food, and  
this cannot be increased without a change of ha-  
bits, which being founded in natoral propensities,  
do not change of themselves.  
  
The first introduction of agriculture among a  
Savage people appears, accordingly, never to  
have taken place without some extraordinary in-  
terposition—where it has not been obtruded by  
colonies transplanted from agricultural countries,  
as from Phenicia and Egypt into Greece, and  
from Greece herse¥f among her savage neighbors,  
the revolution has proceeded from some individu-  
al, whose singular endowments, and supernatural  
pretensions, had given bi an ascendency for the  
purpose. All these great reformers, in ancient  
times, were regarded as more than men, and ulli-  
mately worshipped as god» A very remarkable  
example, of modern date, is found in the revolu-  
tion from the savage to the agricultural state, said  
to have been brought about ‘by Manco Capue,  
among the Peruvians, to whom he represented  
himself as the offspring of the son.  
  
Agriculture, once effect ially commenced, may  
proceed of itself, under impulses of its own crea-  
tion. The mouths fed by it increasing, and the  
supplies of nature decreasing, neces=ity becomes  
a spur to industry ; which finds another spur in  
the advantages incident to the acquisition of pro-

But although no determinate limit presents it-  
self to the increase of food, and to a population  
commensurate with it, other than the limited pro-  
ductiveness of the earth itself, we can scarcely be  
warranted in supposing that all the prodnctive  
powers of its surface can be made subservient to  
the use of man, in exclusion of all the plants and  
- animals not entering into his stock of subsistence ;  
* * that all the elements and combinations of elements

© rous descriptions of created. beings, animate and  
jnanimate, could be withdrawn from that general |  
” destination,and appropriated to the exclusive sup-  
port and increase of the human part of the crea-  
tion ; so that the whole habitable earth should be  
_as tull of people, as the spots most crowded now  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
are or might be made, and as destitute as those |  
&gt; spots, ofthe plants and animals not used by man. |  
&#x27; The supposition cannot well be reconciled with |  
  
Gntoit.  Itis fercidden also by the principles and |  
| Jaws which operate in various depar&#x27;ments 6fher |  
economy, falling within the scope of common ob- |  
ervation, as well as within that of philosopiic re- |  
earches.  
  
~ The earth contains not Jess than thirty or forty |  
Mhousand kinds of plants; not less than six or’  
~Beven hundred of birds ; vor less than three or,  
&gt; four hundred of quadrapeds ; to say nothing of the |  
~ thousand species of fishes. Of reptiles and insects  
7 there are more than can be numbered. ‘Vo all;  
~ Bhese must be added, the swarms and varictics of |  
Tavimalcules and minate vegetables, not visible to |  
“the natural eye, but whose existence is probalily |  
sonnected with that of visible animals and plants. |  
* On comparing this vast profusion and multipti- |  
ty of beings withthe few grains and grasses, the |  
w herbs and roots, and the few fow}s and quad- |  
ipeds, which make up the short list adapted to_  
  
e wants of man, it ts difficult to believe that. it  
  
es with him se to remodel the work of nature as  
would be,remodclled, by a destruction not only |  
“individuals, but of entire species ; and not only i  
a few species, but of every species, with the ||  
ry few exceptions which he might spare for |  
is own accommodation.  
Such a tmultiphcation of the human race, atthe |  
Kpense of the restof the organized creation, im-_  
“aiies that the food of all plants is composed of |  
‘v@lements equally and indiscrimimately nourishing |  
ball, and which consequently may be wholly ap- |  
Popriaicd to the one or few phinis best fiited ter |  
man use. |  
Whether the food or constituent matter of ve- |  
BBtaltes, be farnished from the earth, the air or:  
water ; aud whether directly, or by either, through |  
  
- § the medium of the others, ne sufficient ground ap- |  
Bears for the inference that the food for ail ts the |

consist of precisely the same elements, requires  
more proof than has yet been oifered.  
  
A case which has been relied on to prove thai  
different fuods are not necessary fur different  
plants, is that of grafiing or inoculating one kind  
af plant on another kind ; the sap obtained by the  
stock for itself, being found to feed aud perfect  
the graft. But this operation has its limi&#x27;s. It does  
not extend beyond plauts having a cestain affinity.  
The apple tree may be grafted on the pear or  
quince. It will not succeed on the peach or the  
cherry. If the cases prove that the same food  
suffices for the apple and the pear, they equally  
prove that difierent foods are required for the  
apple and peach. | It is said even that the fruit  
from the peach graft on the almond,is not precise-  
ly the same with that from a peach graft on a plam.  
  
It may be offered as another argument to the  
same eifect, that all animal and vegetable decom.  
positions answer jodiscriminately as manures.—  
The fact is not precisely so. Certain manures

Theatmosphere is not a simple but acompound  
body. Iniis least compound state, it is under-  
stood to contain, besides what is called vital air,  
others noxious in themselves ; yet without a  
portion of which, the vital air becomes noxious.  
But the atmosphere in its natural state, and in its

comprises various ingredients or modifications of  
ingredients, derived from the use made of it, by  
the existing variety of animals and plants. The

of organized beings. Is it unreasonable to sup-  
pose, that if, instead of the actual composition  
and character of the animal and vegetable crea-  
tiun, to which the atmosphere is now accommo-  
dated, such a composition and character of that  
creation were substituted, as would result from  
a reduction of the whole to man and a few kinds  
of animals and plants, is the supposition unrea-  
sonable, that the change might essentially affect  
the aptitude of the atmosphere for the functions  
required of it; and that so great an innovation  
might be found, in this respect, not to accord  
withthe order and economy of nature ?  
  
The relation of the animal part and the vege-  
table part of the creation to each other, through  
the medium of the atmosphere, comes in aid of  
the reflection suggested by the general relation  
between the atmosphere and both. It seems to  
be now well understood, that the atmosphere,  
when respired by animals, becomes unfitted for  
their further use, and fitted for the absorption of  
vegetables ; and that when evolved by the latter,  
itis refitted for the respiration of the former :  
an interchange being thus kept up, by which this  
breath of life is received by each, in a whole-  
some state, in return for it in an unwholesome  
one.  
  
May it not be concluded from this admirable  
arrangement and beautiful feature in the economy  
of nature, that if the whole class of animals were  
extinguished, the use of the atmosphere by the  
vegetable class alone would exhaust it of its life-  
supporting power ; that, in like manner, if the  
whole class of vegetables were extinguised, the  
use of it by the animal class, alone, would de-  
prive it ofits fitness for their support? And if  
such would be the effect of an entire destruction

THE  
questions as to the period of time necessary to  
exhaust the atmosphere of its unrenewed capaci-  
ty to keep alive animal or vegetable nature, when  
deprived, e1ber, of the support of the other.—  
And this period contracts itself at once to the Im-  
agination, when it is recollected that the immen-  
sity of the atmosphere is the effect of its elastici-  
ty and rarefaction. We know from the barome-  
ter, that condensed to the specitic gravity of mer-  
cury, its rise above the surface of the earth  
woukd be but about thirty inches ; and from the  
well pump, that condensed to the specilic gravi-  
ty only of water, which is nearly the same with  
that of the human body, its rise would be little  
€ that is, a little more  
than five times the human stature. It 1s found  
that a single human person, employs in respiva-  
tion not less than sixteen or eighteen times his  
own weight of common air, in every twenty-four  
hours. In diflerent degrees, some greater, some  
less, the case is the same with most other ani-  
mals. Plants make a correspondent use of air  
for their purposes.  
  
Other views of the economy of nature coincide  
with the preceding. ‘There isa known tendency  
in all organized beings to multiply boyond tie de-  
gree necessary to keep up their actual numbers.  
It is a wise provision of nature :—1, to guard  
against the failure of the species: 2, to atiord,  
in the surplus, a food for animals, whether sub-  
sisting on vegetables, or_on other animals which  
subsist on vegetables. Nature bas been equally  
provident in guarding against an excessive multi-  
plication of any one species which might too far

substituted for the plough, and all animals con-  
suming the food of man, er food for which human  
food might be substituted, banished from exis-  
tence, so as to produce the maximum of popula-  
tion on the earth, there would be more than an  
hundred individuals for every one now upon it.  
In the actual population of many countries, it  
brings on occasional epidemics, to be traced to no  
other origin than the state of the atmosphere.—  
Increase the numbers ten or twenty fold, and can  
it be supposed, that they would at any ume find  
the breath of life in a condition to supportit : or

a single country, canit be admitted, when not

some philosophers, that no variation whatever in

beings belonging to our globe, is permitted by the  
system of nature ; that the number of species and  
of individuals, in the animal and vegetable em-  
  
  
  
pires, since they attained a destined complement,  
&#x27;has been, and must always be, the same ; that

cand thus mountain the established and unalterable

I. The error first to be noticed is that of culti- |  
vating land, either naturally poor or impoverished ,  
altivation. This error, like many others, is |  
the effect of hi ibit, continued after the reason for |  
it has failed. Whilst there was an abundance of |  
fresh and fertile soil, it was the interest of the cul-  
tivater to spread his labor over as great a surface |  
as he could. Land being cheap and labor dear, |  
ant the land co-operating powerfully with the la-  
bor, it was profitable to draw as much as possible  
fromthe land. Labor is now comparatively cheap-  
er and bind dearer. Where labor has risen in price  
foucfold, land has risen tenfold. It might be pro-  
fiiable, therefore, now tocontract the surfice over |  
rwhich labor is spread, even if the soil retained  
its freshness and fertility. But this is not the  
case. “Much of the fertile soil is exhausted, and  
untfertile soils are brought into cultivation ; and

Il. The evil of pressing too hard upon the  
land, has also been much increased by the bad  
mode of ploughing it. Shallow ploughing, and  
ploughing up and down hilly land, have, by ex-  
posing the loosened soil to be carried off by rains,  
hastened more than any thing else, the waste of  
its fertility. When the mere surface is pulver-  
ised, moderate rains on land but little uneven, if  
ploughed up and down, gradually wear it away.  
And heavy rains on hilly land, ploughed in that  
manner, soon produce.a like effect, notwithstand-  
ing the improved practice of deeper ploughing.  
How Ifave the beauty and value of this red ridge  
of country suffered from this cause? And how  
much is due to the happy improvement introdu-  
ced by amember of this society, whom I need not  
name,* by a cultivation in horizontal drills with a  
plough adupted to it? Had the practice prevail-  
ed from the first settlement of the country, the  
general fertility would have been more than the  
double of what the red hills, and indeed all other  
hilly lands, now possess ; and the scars and sores  
now defacing them would no where be seen.—  
Happily, experience is proving that this remedy,  
aided by amore rational management in other  
respects, is adequate to the purpose of healing  
what has been wounded, as well as of preserving  
the health of what has escaped the calamity.—  
It is truly gratifying to observe how fast the im-  
provement is spreading from the parent example.  
The value of our red hills, under a mode of cul-  
tivation which guards their fertility against wast-  
ing rains, is probably exceeded by that of no up-  
lands whatever ; and without that advantage they  
are exceeded in value by almost all others.—  
They are little more than a lease for years.  
  
Besides the inestimable advartage from horizon-  
tal ploughing, in protecting the soil against the  
wasting effect of rains, there is a great one in its  
preventing the rains themselves from being lost  
to the crop. The Indian corn is the crop which  
most exposes the soil to be carried off by the rains;  
and it is at the same time the crop which most  
needs them. Where the land is not only hilly,  
but the soil thirsty, (as is the case particularly  
throughout this mountainous range,) the preser-  
vation of the rain as it falls, between the drilled  
ridges, is of peculiar importance ; aud its gradual  
settling downwards to the roots, is the best possi-  
ble mode of supplying them with moisture. In  
the old method of ploughing shallow, wiih the  
furrows up and down, the rain as well as the soil  
was lost.  
  
Ill. The neglect of manures is another error  
which claims particular notice. It may be traced  
to the same cause with our excessive cropping.  
In the early stages of our agriculture, it was more  
convenient, and more profitable, to bring new  
land into cultivation, than to improve exhausted  
land. The failure of new land has long called  
for the improvement of old land ; but habit has  
kept us deaf to the call.

cropping without manure, deprives the soil of its |  
fertility. It is equally certain that fertility may |  
be preserved or restored, by giving to the earth |  
animal or vegetable manure equivalent to the  
matter taken from it; and that a perpetual fertility  
is not, in itself, incompatible with an uninterrupt-  
ed succession of crops. ‘The Chinese, it is said,  
smile at the idea, that land needs rest, as if like  
animals it had a sense of fatigue. Their soil does  
not need rest, because an industrious use Is made  
of every fertilizing particle that can contribute  
towards replacing what has been drawn from it.  
And this. is the more practicable with them, as  
almost the whole of what is grown on their farms  
is consumed within them. ‘That arestoration to  
the earth of all that annually grows on it, pre-  
vents its impoverishment, is sulliciently seen in  
our forests, where the annual exuviz of the trees  
and plants replace the fertility of which they de-  
prive the earth. Where frequent fires destroy  
the leaves and whatever els2 is annually dropped  
onthe earth, it is well known that the jand be-  
comes poorer: this destruction of the natural  
crop, having the same impoverishing effect, as a  
removal of a cultivated crop. A still stronger  
proof that an annual restoration to the earth of  
all its annual product will perpetuate its produc-  
tiveness, is seen where our fields are left uncul-  
tivated and unpastured. In this case the soil,  
receiving from the decay of the spontaneous  
weeds and grasses more fertility than they ex-  
tract from it, is for a time at least improved, not  
impoverished. Its improvement may be explain-  
ed, by the fertilizing matter which the weeds and  
grasses derive from water and the atmosphere,  
which forms a nett gain to the earth. At what  
point, or from what cause, the formation and ac-  
cumulation of vegetable mould from this gain  
ceases, is not perbaps very easy to be explained.  
That it does cease, is proved by the stationary  
condition of the surface of the earth in old fo-  
rests ; and that the amount of the accumulation  
varies with the nature of the subjacent earth, is  
equally certain. Itseems to depend also on the |  
species of trees and plants which happen to con- |  
tribute the materials for the vegetable mould. |

is certainly that of applying to the soil a sufficien- |  
cy of animal and vegetable matter in a putriled |  
state, or a state ready for putrefaction ; in order i  
to procure which, too much care cannot be ob- |!  
served in saving nvery material furnished by the |) i  
farm. This resource was among the earliest dis- |  
coveries of men living by agriculture ; and a pro-  
per use of it has been made a test of good hus-  
bandry, in all countries, ancient and modern,  
where its principles and profits have been stu-  
died.  
  
Some farmers of distinction, headed by Tull,  
supposed that mere earth, in a pulverized state,  
was sufficient without manure for the growth of  
plants ; and consequently that continued pulveri-  
zation would render the soil perpetually produc-  
tive ; a theory which never would have occurred  
to a planter of tobacco or of Indian corn, who  
  
  
  
finds the soil annually producing less and less, un-  
der a constant pulverizing course. The known  
experiment of Van Helmont seemed to favour the  
  
  
  
  
  
‘It there  
were no allusions in the case, the earth used by  
him must at least have been destitute of vegeta-  
ble mould: for in an experiment by W oodhouse,  
a garden mould was diminished in its weight by a  
plant which grew in it. And the latest chemical  
examinations of the subject coincide with the ge-  
neral opinion of practical husbandmen, that the  
substance of plants partakes of the substance of  
the soil.  
  
The idea is indeed very natural that vegetable  
matter which springs from the earth, and of itself’  
returns to the earth, should be one source atleast  
of the earth’s capacity to reproduce vegetable  
matter.  
  
It has been asked, how it happens that Egypt  
and Sicily, which have for ages been exporting  
their agr ‘icultural produce, without a return of  
any equivalent produce, have not lost their repro-  
ductive capacity. One answer has been, that  
they have lost no small degree of it. If the fact  
be otherwise with regard to Egypt, it might be  
accounted for by the fertilizing inundations of the  
Nile. With regard to Sicily, there may be some-  
thing in the system of husbandry, or some parti-  
cular local circumstances, which countervail the  
continued asportation of the fruits of the soil.—  
But it is far more probable, that the island is less  
productive than it once was. It is certainly less  
of a granary for other countries now, than it was  
when it received that title from the ancient Ro-  
mans. And its population being diminished, the  
internal consumption must also be diminished.—  
If a single farm be rendered less productive by a  
continued removal of its crops, without any ade-  
quate returns, no reason occurs why it should  
not happen to a number of farms multiplied to  
the extent of a whole country.  
  
And that individual farms do lose their fertility  
in proportion as crops are taken from them, and  
returos of manure neglected, is a fact not likely  
to be questioned.  
  
Itit were, Virginia, unfortunately, is but too  
capable of furnishing the proofs. Her prevailing  
crops have been very.exhansting, and the use of  
manures has been particularly neglected.  
  
Lobacco and Indian corn, which for a long  
time, on the east side of the Rlue Mountains,  
were the articles almost exclusively cultivated,  
and which continue to be cultivated, the former  
extensively, the latter universally, are known to  
be great impoverishers of the soil. Wheat,  
‘which has for a number of years, formed a larce  
portion of the general crop, is also an exhausting  
‘crop. Soare rye and oats, which enter occa-  
  
| sionally into our farming system.  
  
With so many consumers of the fertility of the  
earth, and so liitle attention to the means of re-  
pairing their ravages, no one can be surprised at  
the impoverished face of the country ; whilst  
every one ought to be desirous of aiding in the  
work of reformation.  
  
The first main step towards it, is to make the  
thieves restore as much as possible of the stolen  
fertility. On this, with other improvements  
which may be made in our husbandry, we must  
depend for the rescue of our farms from their  
present degraded condition.  
  
Of tobacco not a great deal more than one half  
of the entire plant is carried to market. The re-  
  
} sidue is an item on the Jist of manures ; and it is

‘known to be in its quality a very rich one. The  
crop of tobacco, however, though of great value,  
covers but a small proportion of our cultivated  
ground ; and its offal can, of course, contribute  
but inconsiderably to the general stock of ma-  
nure. Itis probable also, that what it does con-  
tribute, has been more carefully used as a ma-  
nure, than any other article furnished by our  
€rops.  
  
The article which constitutes our principal ma-  
nure, is wheat straw. It is of much importance,  
therefore, to decide aright on the mode of using  
it. There are three modes :—1. Carrying it  
from the farm yard, after having passed through,  
or being trodden and enriched by cattle. In  
that mode, the greater part of it must be used,  
if used at all; the straw going through tliat pro-  
cess, being a necessary part of the food allotted  
to the cattle. To derive the full advantage from  
it, it ought to be hauled out before the substance  
has been wasted by rain, by the sun, and by the  
wind ; and to be buried in the earth as soon af-  
ter as possible. 2. Spreading the straw on the  
surface of the ground. Many respectable far-  
mers are attached to this mode, as protecting the  
soil from the sun; and by keeping it moist, fa-  
voring the vegetation underneath, whether spon-  
taneous or urtificial ; whilst the straw itself is  
gradually decomposed into a manure. The ob-  
jection to this mode, is the loss by evaporation,  
before this last effect is obtained. 3. Turning  
the straw at once under the surface of the earth.  
This would seem to be the best mode of manag-  
ing manures generally ; least of their substance  
being then lost. When the grain is trodden out  
from the straw, it is left in a state easily admit-  
ting this operation. Some difficulty may attend  
it, when the grain is threshed from the straw, by  
the flail, or by the machines now in use, neither  
of which break the straw sufficiently to pieces.  
  
{t may be remarked with regard to this article  
of manure—1. That its weight is barely more  
than that of the grain.—2. That the grain is the  
part which makes the greatest draft on the ferti  
lity of the earth.—3. That the grain is for the  
most part not consumed within the farm. It is  
found on trial that a stalk of wheat, as generally  
cut, including the chaff, and the grains borne by  
the stalk, are pretty nearly of equal weight.——  
The caseis probably the same with rye, and not  
very different with oats. The proportion of fer-  
tilizing matter in the straw, to that in the grain,  
has not, as far as I know, been brought to any sa-  
tisfactory test. It is, doubtless, much less in the  
straw, which alone, in the case of wheat, is with  
us returaable in any form to the earth. This  
consideration, whilst it urges us to make the most  
of the article as a manure, warns us of its insuf-  
ficiency.  
  
The stubble, and the roots of the small grains,  
not being taken from the earth, may be regarded  
as elapsing into a fertility equal to that of which  
they deprived the earth. This remark is appli-  
cable to all cultivated plants, the roots of which  
are not an esculent part.  
  
Aneminent citizen and celebrated agriculturist*  
of this state, has among other instructive lessons,  
called the public attention to the value of the corn  
¢talk as a manure. Iam _ persuaded that he has  
not overrated it. And it is a subject of agreeable

reflection, that an article which is so extensively |)  
cultivated as that of Indian corn, and which is so |!  
particularly exhausting, should be the one so ca- [  
pable of repairing the injury itdoes. ‘he corn |  
stalk as a fodder is of great value. Not only the |,  
leaves, but the husk inclosing the ear, and the |}  
cob enclosed by it, are all more or less valuable  
food when duly preserved and dealt out to cattle. |  
There is no better fodder thun the leaves or  
blades for horses and oxen ; nor any so much  
approved for sheep, the husk or shruck is a high-  
ly nourishing food for neat cattle. And the pick-  
ings of the stalk, even at a late season, and after  
much exposure to the weather, support them bet-  
ter than any of the straws. Froimthe saccharine  
matter in the stalk, which is long retained about  
the joints, it cannot be doubted that if cut early, }  
or before exposure to the weather, into parts  
small enough for mastication, it would well re-  
pay, as a food for cattle, the labour required for  
it.  
  
The great value of the cornstalk, in all its parts,  
as a fodder, was brought into full proof, by the  
use made of it, during the late general failure of  
crops. Itis to be hoped that the lesson will not  
be suffered to pass into oblivion.  
  
But it is as a resource for re-fertilizing the  
soil, that the cornstalk finds the proper place  
here ; and as such it merits particular notice,  
whether it be passed through animals, or be pre-  
pired by fermentation in the farm yard; or be  
merely spread on the surface of the earth, the  
mode in which its effects must be least considera-  
ble. The same qualities which render every  
part of it nutricious to animals, renZer it nutri-  
cious to the earth; and it is accompanied with  
the peculiar advantages—1. That the grain it-  
self is mostly every where, and altogether, in  
places distant from navigation, consumed within  
the farms producing it. 2. That as the grain is  
in greater proportion to the space on which it  
grows than most other grains, so the rest of the  
plant is in greater proportion to the grain, than  
the rest of any other grain plant. ‘The straw  
and chaff of the smaller grains, as already re-  
marked, is in weight but about one-half of the  
grain. The cornstalk, with all its appurtenant  
offal, is of less than three times, and if taken  
early from the field, probably of not less than  
four or five times the weight of the grain belong-  
ing toit. 3. The fertilizing matter contained in  
the cornstalk is greater in proportion to its weight,  
than that contained in the straw and offal of other  
grain is to the weight of the straw and offal.  
  
Would it be hazarding too much to say, that  
where a level surface, or the mode of cultivating  
a hilly one, prevents the rains from carrying off  
the soil, a restoration of an entire crop of Indian  
corn, in the form of manure, to the space produ-  
cing it (there being no other intervening crop  
not so restored) would replace the fertility con-  
sumed by the crop; and maintain a perpetual  
productiveness ? Reason, the case of forest and  
fallow fields, where the spontaneous crop falls  
back of itself on the earth, and the Chinese ex-  
ample, where the cultivated crop is restored to  
the earth, ail pronounce that such would be the  
effect. And yet the fact stares us in the face,  
that our most impoverished fields, even the most  
level of them, owe their condition more to the |  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Q  
  
  
  
crops of Indian corn, than to any other crops.

The cotton plant, which i¢ so extensive aero»  
in the more southern and the so:  
states, is bit litthe cultivated in Virzinia, and  
scarcely at all inthis partofit. Tam not able te  
say how far it is comparatively an exbanstins  
crop. But it would seem to be more capable  
than any crop, net wholly consumed within the  
farm, of preserving its fertility. ‘The only part  
of the plant carried away, is the cotton fibre, or  
woolly part, which bears an incensiderable pro-  
portion to the other parts in weight, and, as may  
be inferred, in fertilizing matter also. The seed  
alone, passing by the ball and haulm, is of three  
times its weight and contains the chief part of the  
oilin the plant. In the countries where cotton  
makes the principal part of the crop, the supers  
fluous seed must deserve great attention as a ma-  
nure. Where the fields are level or cultivated  
in horizontal drills, it might go far towards sup-  
porting a ¢ontinued cropping, without a dimin-  
ished fertility.  
  
The sum of these remarks on cultivating poor  
land, and neglecting the means of keeping or ma-  
king land rich, is, that if every thing grown on a  
soil is carried from it, it must become unproduc-  
tive ; that ifevery thing grown on it,be direcily or  
indirectly restored to it, it would not cease to be  
productive ; and, consequently, that according to  
the degree in which the one or the other practice  
takes place, a farm must be impoverished, or be  
permanently productive and profitable. Every  
acre made by an improved management to pro-  
duce as much as two acres, is in effect the addi-  
tion of a new acre ; withthe great advantages of  
contracting the space to be cultivated, and of  
shortening the distance of transportation between  
the fields and the barn or the farm yard. One  
of the Roman writers* on husbandry, enforces  
the obligation to improving management, by asto-  
ry of one Paridius, who had two daughters and a  
vineyard : when the elder was married, he gave  
hera third part of the vineyard ; notwithstand-  
ing which, he obtained from two thirds the same  
crop as from the whole : when his other daughter  
was married, he portioned her with the half of  
what remained, and still the produce of his vine-  
yard was undiminished. The story, short as it  
is, contains a volume of instraction.  
  
The plaister of gypsum, though not a manure  
within the farm itself, has been too long neglect-  
ed, as a fertilizing resource. It is now beginning  
to take a high and just rank as such. The prools  
of its efficacy are as incontestible as the causes of  
it are obscure. The experiments of a very dis-  
tinguished chemistf led him to the opinion that its  
substance enters into the substance of the plant.  
Without doubting the fact, it does not sufficiently  
account for the addition made to the size and  
weight of the plant, which greatly exceed the  
quantity of the plaister. It must, therefore, have  
some further mode of operating. Whether it be  
by neutralizing some noxious ingredient in the  
earth, one of the modes by which lime is snppo-  
sed to operate ; or by attracting .nd conveying to  
the plant, food from the earth, the air, or water,  
or by exciting the plant to a more active use of its  
feeding powers, whatever they be ; or by its ac-  
cretion assimilation to the particular parts of  
plants cn which these powers depend, thereby

IV. Among the means of aiding the productive-  
ness of the soil, which have not received merited  
attention, is irrigation. In scarcely any country  
does this resource abound more than in the Uni-  
ted States ; nor is there any, where there is so  
little sensibility toits value. ‘The inconsiderable  
use made of it is chieily by emigrants, particu-  
larly Germans, or the immediate descendants of  
them. I have understood that the market of Bal-  
timore has been much benetitted in dry seasons  
by the irrigation introduced by exiles from St.  
Domingo. Fora distinguished proof of the im-  
portance of the practice, I may refer to the fact  
which has been stated, that in the neighbourhood  
of Barcelona in Spain, where a part of the land  
is under irrigation, and a part is not susceptible  
of it, both being otherwise of equal fertility, the  
part irrigated is of double price in the market. It  
is to be noted indeed that the climate is a dry one,  
and that the article cultivated is Lucerne. And  
this a plant which, though much aided in its  
  
growth by moisture, is at the same time remarka-  
  
ble for the length of a tap root, and fitted by that  
as well as the absorbent quality of its leaves, to  
flourish in a thirsty soil, and warmclimate. Our  
particular district of country, abounding in springs,  
small streams, and suitable declivities, admits  
greatly of irrigation ; and being generally of a  
els nature, the more strongly invites the use  
of it.  
  
V. I cannot but consider it as an error in our hus-  
bandry, that oxen are too little used in place of  
horses.  
  
Every fair comparison of the expense of the  
two animals, favours a preference of the ox. But  
the circumstance particularly recommending him,  
is that he can be supported when at work, by  
grass and hay ; whilst the horse requires grain  
and much of it ; and the grain generally given  
him, Indian corn, tie crop which requires most  
labour, and greatly exhausts the land.  
  
From the best estimate I have been enabled to  
form, more than one half of the corn crop is con-  
sumed by horses, including the ungrown ones ;  
and not less than one half, by other than pleasure  
horses. By getting free from this consumption,  
one half the labour, and of the wear of the land,  
would be saved, or rather more than one half ;  
for on most farms, one half of the crop of corn  
grows on not more than two fifths, and sometimes  
asmaller portion of the caltivated fields ; and  
the more fertile ficlds would of course be retain-  
ed for cultivation. Every one can figure to him-  
self the ease and conveniency of a revolution  
which would so much reduce the extent of his  
cornfields ; and substitute for the labour bestow-  
ed on them the more easy task of providing pas-  
tue evnd hay.  
  
B it will not the ox when kept at hard labour  
require grain food as well as the horse ? Certain-  
ly much less, ifany. Judging from my own ob-  
servation, | should say, thata plenty of good grass  
or good hay, will suilice without grain, where the  
  
———

—_  
  
THE PLOUGH BO},  
  
‘&#x27;Jabour is neither constantnor severe. But I feel  
| entire confidence in saying, that a double set ol  
oxen alternately at work, and therefore balf the  
time at resi, might be kept in good plight without  
other food than a plenty of grass and good hay.  
And as this double set would double the surplus of  
beef, tallow and leather, a set off is found in that  
consideration for a double censumption of that  
kind of food.  
  
The objections generally made to the ox, are--  
1. That he is less tractable than the horse.  
That he does not bear heat as well. 5. That he  
does not answer for the single plough used in our  
corn fields. 4. That he is slower in his move-  
ment. 5. That he is less fit for carrying the  
produce of the farm to market.  
  
The first objection is certainly founded ix mis-  
take. Ofthe two animals, the ox is the more do-  
cile. In all countries where the ox is the ordin-  
ary draught anims}, his docility is proverbial.—  
His intractability, where it exists, has arisen from  
an occasional use of bim only with long and trre-  
cular intervals ; during which the habit of disci-  
pline being broken, a new one is to be formed.  
  
The 2d objection has as little foundation. The  
constitution of the ox accommodates itself as rea-  
dily as that of the horse, to different climates.—  
Not only in ancient Greece and [taly, but through-  
out Asia, as presented to us in ancient history,  
the ox and the plough are associated. At this  
day, in the warm parts of India and China, the ox,  
not the horse, is inthe draughtservice. In every  
part of India the ox always appears even in the  
train of her armies. And in the hottest parts of  
the West Indies, the ox is employed in hauling  
the weighty produce to the sea ports. ‘ihe mis-  
take here, as in the former case, has arisen from  
the effect ofan occasional employment only, with  
no other than green food. The fermentation of  
this in the animal heated by the weather, and  
fretted by the discipline, will readily account for  
his sinking under his exertions ; when green food  
even, much less dry, with a sober habit of labour,  
would have no such tendency.  
  
The 3d objection also is nota solidone. The  
ox can by a proper harness be used singly as well  
as the horse, between the rows of Indian corn ;  
and equally so used for other purposes. Experi-  
ence may be safely appealed to on this point.  
  
In the fourth place, it is alledged that he is slow-  
er in his movements. This is true, but in a less  
degree, than is often taken for granted. Oxen  
that are well chosen for their form, are not work-  
ed after the age of about 8 years, (the age at  
which they are best fitted for beef,) are not work-  
ed too many together, and are suitably matched,  
may be kept to nearly as quick a step as the  
horse. May I not say astep quicker than that of  
many of the horses we see at work, who on ac-  
count of their age, or the leanness occasioned by  
the costliness of the food they require, lose this  
advantage, where they might have once had it.  
  
The last objection has most weight. The ox  
is not as well adapted as the horse to the road  
service, especially for long trips. In common  
roads, which are often soft, and sometimes sud-  
denly become so, the form of his foot, and the  
:hortness of his leg, are disadvantages ; and on  
roals frozen, or turnpiked, the roughness of the  
  
ane ae ee ee  
  
~e  
  
  
  
both cases, are inconvenient to his cloven hoof.

zurface in the former case, and its hardness in,  
  
| But where the distance to markei ts noi great,  
where the varying state of the roads and of tne  
tt 4 Bing  
  
weather can be « onsulted 3 and where the road  
iseryice Is in less proportion to the farm service,  
ithe objection is almost deprived of its weigbt.—  
| in cases where it most applies, its weight is dimi-  
nished by the consideration, that a much greater  
proportion of service on the furm may be done by  
oxen, than is now commonly done ; and that the  
expense of shocing them Is little different trom  
that of keeping horses shod. It is observable,  
, that when oxen are worked on the farm, over  
&#x27;rough frozen ground, they suffer so much from  
| the want of shees, however well fed they may be,  
| that it is a proper subject for calculation, whether  
|true economy does nat require of them that ac-  
commodation, even cn the farm as weil as for the  
horses.  
  
A more important calculation is, whether, in  
many situations, the general saving by substituting  
the ox for the horse, would not balance the ex-  
pense of hiring a carriage of the produce to mar-  
ket. Inthe same scale with the hire, is to be  
put the value of the grass and hay consumed by  
the oxen; and in the other scale, the value of  
the corp, amounting to one half of the crop, and  
of the grass and hay consumed by the horses.—  
Where the market is not distant, the value of the  
corn saved would certainly pay for the carriage  
of the market portion of the crop, and balance  
moreover any difference between the value of  
the grass and hay consumed by oxen, and the va-  
lue of the oxen when slaughtered for beef. Ih  
all these calculations it is, doubtless, proper not  
to lose sight of the rule,that farmers ought to a-  
void paying others for doing what they can do  
themselves. But the rule has its exceptions ;  
and the error if it be committed, will not lie in  
departing from the rule, but in not selecting a-  
right the cases which call for the departure. It  
may be remarked, that the rule ought to be more  
or less general, as there may or may not be at  
hand, a market by which every produce of labour  
is convertible into money. In the old countries  
this is much more the case than in the new ; and  
in the new, much more the case near towns, than  
at a distance from them. In this as in most other  
parts of our country, a change of circumstances  
is taking place, which renders every thing raised  
on a farm more convertible into money than for-  
merly ; and as the change proceeds, it will be  
more and more a point for consideration, how far  
the labour in doing what might be bought, could  
earn more in another way, than the amount of  
the purchase. Still it will always be prudent, for  
reasons which every experienced farmer will un-  
derstand, to lean to the side of doing, rather than  
| hiring or buying what may be wanted.  
  
The mule seems to be, in point of economy,  
between the ox and the horse ; preferable to the  
latter, inferior to the former ; but so well adapt-  
ed to particular services, that he may find a pro-  
i} per place on many farms. He is liable to the  
objection which weighs most against the ox. He  
is less fitted than the horse for the road service.  
  
Vi. A more manifest error in the husbandry of  
the older settlements, is that of keeping too ma-  
ny neat cattle on their farms. As a farm should  
| not be cultivated farther than it can be continued  
in good heart: the stock of cattle should not be  
in greater number than the resources of food will

pal. ithe same food given to. the proper num-  
ber, will not only keep them in a thrifty state,  
but enable them to supply the dairy. Lven the  
manure from several poor cattle is worth less  
than that from a single fat one. The remark  
holds equally good with respect to the hide.  
The misjodged practice in question is another  
effect of inattention to the change of circumstan-  
ces through which our country bas passed. Ori-  
ginally the forest abounded in rich herbage which  
ted and fatted, without expense, all the cattle that  
could be brought through the winter into the  
spring. It was natural at that time to keep as  
Jarge a stock as could be preserved through the  
winter. Fora longtime past, the forest is scarce-  
ly any where a resource for more than two or  
three months ; and in many places, no resource  
at all. A greater difficulty is often felt in finding  
summer, than winter subsistence. And yet where  
no inclosed pasturage is provided to take the  
place of the extinct one in the forest, the habit,  
founded in reasons which have entirely ceased,  
is but too generally retained. The same number  
of cattle is aimed at, as if the forest- was as ready  
to receive and fatten them now as formerly.—  
The size and appearance of our neat cattle, com-  
pared with those for which nature or good hus-  
bandry has provided sufficient food, are proofs  
  
  
  
ber; and that where the food cannot be increas-  
_ed, the number ought to be reduced.  
  
none is so diflicult to be repaired, as the injudi-  
_ cious and excessive destruction of timber and fire-  
It seems never to have occurred that the  
‘fund was not inexhaustible, and that a crop of  
trees could not be raised as quickly as one of  
  
Here again we are presented with a proof of  
the continuance of a practice for which the rea-  
sons have ceased. When our ancestors arrived,

it is high time for ‘many farmers, even in this |  
jearter, and still more so in the country beiow  
  
Pradence will no longer delay to economize what  
to foster the second growths  
where taking place in convenient spots ; and to  
commence, where necessary, plantations of the  
trees recommended by their niility and quickness  
of growth.  
  
1 wish I could more satisfactorily estimate the  
proportion of woodland which ought to belong to  
every farm, as a permanent fund of timber for  
building and repairing houses ; for fences, where |  
live or stone ones may not be introduced ; for  
wheel carriages, and other apparatus needed on  
farms. ‘The estimate is the more difficult, be-  
cause it must be varied according to many cir-  
cumstances ; particularly, according to the nature  
of the soil and the kind of trees at once suited to  
it, and to the uses to be made of them.  
  
Estimating the crop of wood, yielded by  
acre, at twenty cords, the period of reproduction  
at twenty years, and the average number of cords  
annually consumed at a fireplace, including the  
culinary consumption, at ten cords, every fire-  
place on a farm will require ten acres for a per-  
manent supply of fuel. For the other necessities  
of a farm several acres more ought to be added.  
  
An estimate in a very sensible publication en-  
titled ‘the New-England Farmer,’’ makes se-  
venteen acres necessary for a fire-place. The  
winters there are longer, and the climate may be  
less favorable to the quick growth of trees. But  
their houses are generally closer than with us ;  
to say nothing of a more judicious management  
than can be enforced on most of our farms.  
  
To this catalogue of errors in our rural econo-  
my, considerable as it is, many | fear might be  
added. The task of pointing them out, I gladly  
leave to others, less incapable than I have shewn  
myself to be, by the very imperfect manner in  
which I have performed the one on which I have

their appearance.  
  
But, closely as agriculture and civilization are  
allied, they do not keep pace with each other.  
There is probably a much higher state of agri-  
culture in China and Japan, than in many other}  
countries far more advanced in the improvement  
of civilized life. It is surely no small reproach  
to the latter, that with so great a superiority in  
science, and in the fuller possession of the auxili-

stripped in the very art by which both are essen-  
tially distinguished from the brute creation.  
  
It must not be inferred, however, from the ca-  
pacities and the motives of man, for an artificial  
increase of the productions of the earth, that the  
transition from the hunter, or even the herdsman  
state, to the agricultural is a matter of course.  
The first steps in this transition, are attended  
with difficulty ; and what is more with disincli-

as a certain principle, that the necessary arts of  
life, when once introduced among a people, can  
never be lost, that the dominion over inferior an-  
imals once enjoyed, will never be abandoned ;  
and that America consequently, must have been  
peopled from a country as uncivilized as itself.  
Yet he derives the American Savages, generally,  
from the Tartars, whose example must have  
taught them the use of certain animals, for which  
a substitute might have been found in the Bison  
or Buffaloe at least (the same animal with the  
cow) if not in the Elk, the Moose, or the Cara-  
boo. And he regards the Esquimaux, a tribe  
distinguished in several respects, for their rude  
condition, as descendants from the Greenlanders,  
of the same modes of life with themselves, who  
were a colony from Norway, planted in the 9th  
century; an epoch prior to which the Norwe-  
gians had made such progress in the arts, as to  
be capable of formidable maritime expeditions. —  
The Greenland Colony therefore, must have un-  
dergone a degeneracy from the condition of its  
parent country. Without supposing the possi-

society, to a savage state, how would the learned  
historian have accounted for the introduction o!

The bent of humass nature may be traced on  
the chart of our own country. The manufac-  
  
turer readily exchanges the loom forthe plough,

And as the game of the forest ts ap-  
proached, the hu:.ting life dispiays the force of  
its, attractions. Where do we behold a march in  
the opposite direction ; the bunter becoming the  
herdsman; the latter a follower of the plough ;  
and the last repairing to tiie manufactory or the  
workshop?  
  
Such indeed is the facination of that personal  
independence whic!; belongs to the uncivilized  
state. and such the disrelish and cuniempt of the  
monotonous labour of ‘illaye, compared with the  
exciting occupations of the chase, or with the in-  
dolence enjoyed by those who subsisi chiefly on  
the mere bounties of nature, or on their migra-  
tory flocks, that a voluntary relinquishment of  
these latter modes of lile, is little to be expected.  
We certainly perceive nothing in the character  
of our savage neighbours, from which it could  
be inferred, that even the germs of agriculture  
observed in their spots of maize, and a few other  
cultivated plants, would ever be developed into  
the extent implied by an agricultural life. To™  
that little resource combined with the game fur-  
nished by the forests and by the lake or the  
stream, their population and habits are adjusted.  
There may be said, in fact, to be a plenum of the  
ormer; because it is commensurate with their  
food—and this cannot be increased without a  
change of habits, which being founded in natural  
propensities, do not change of themselves.  
  
The first introduction of agriculture among a  
savage people appears, accordingly, never to have  
taken place without some extraordinary interpo-  
sition. Where it has not been obtruded by co-  
lonies transplanted from agricultural countries,  
as from Pheenicia and Egypt into Greece, and  
from Greece herself, amongst her savage neigh-  
bours, the revolution has proceeded from some  
individual whose singular endowments, and su-  
pernatural pretensions, had given him an ascen-  
dency for the purpose. All these great reform-  
ers, in ancient times, were regarded as more  
than men, and ultimately worshiped as gods. -A  
very remarkable example of modern date is  
found in the revolution from the savage to the  
agricultural state, said to have been brought about  
by Manco Capac, among the Peruvians, to whom  
he represented himself as the offspring of the sun.  
  
Agriculture once effectually commenced, may  
proceed, of itself, under impulses of its own crea-  
tion. The mouths fed by it increasing, and the  
supplies of nature decreasing, necessity becomes  
a spur to industry, which finds another spur, in  
the advantages incident to the acquisition of pro

Sive agriculture, and a progressive population  
ensue.  
  
But although no determinate limit presents  
itself to the increase of food, and to a population  
commensurate with it, other than the limited pro-  
ductiveness of the earth itself, we can scarcely be  
warranted in supposing that all the productive  
powers of its surface can be made subservient to  
the use of man, in exclusion of ali the plants and  
animals not entering into his stock of subsistence:  
that all the elements and combinations of ele-  
ments in the earth, the atmosphere and the water,  
which now support such various and such nume  
rous descriptions of created beings, animate and  
inanimate, could be withdrawn from that general  
destination, and appropriated to the exclusive sup-  
port and increase of the human part of the crea  
tion; so that the whole habitable earth should  
be as full of people, as the spots most crowded  
now are or might be made, and as destitute as  
those spots, of the plants and animals not used by  
man.  
  
The supposition cannot well be reconciled with  
that symmetry in the face of nature, which de  
rives new beauty from every insight that can be  
gained into it. It is forbidden also, by the prin-  
ciples and laws which operate in various depart-  
ments of her economy, falling within the scope of  
common observation, as well as within that of  
philosophic researches.  
  
The earth contains not less than thirty or forty  
thousand kinds of plants; not less than six or  
seven hundred of birds; not less than three on  
four hundred of quadrupeds; to say nothing of  
the thousand species of fishes. Of reptiles and  
insects, there are more than can be numbered.  
To all these must be added, the swarms and va-  
vieties of animalcules and minute vegetables not  
visible to the natural eye, but whose existence is  
probably connected with that of visible animals  
and plants.  
  
On comparing this vast profusion and multip!i  
city of beings with the few grains and grasses,  
the few herbs and roots, and the few fowls and  
quadrupeds, which make up the short list adapt-  
ed to the wants of man; it is difficult to believe  
that it lies with him, so to re-model the work of  
nature, as it would be remodelled, by a destruc-  
tion, not only of individuals, but of entire species,  
and not only of a few species, but of every spe-  
cics, with the very few exceptions which he might  
spare for his own accommodation.  
  
Sucha multiplication of the human race, at the  
expense of the rest of the organized creation,  
implies that the food of all plants is composed of  
elements equally and indiscriminately nourishing  
all, and which consequently may be wholly ap-  
propriated to the one or few planis best fitted for  
human use.  
  
Whether the food or constituent matter of ve-  
getables, be furnished from the earth, the air or  
water; and whether directly, or by either, through  
the medium of the others, no sufficient ground  
appears for the inference that the food for all 1:  
the same.  
  
Different plants require different soils; some  
flourishing in sandy, some in clayey; some in  
moist, some in dry soils ; some in warm, some in  
cold situations. Many grow only in water—and  
a few subsist inthe atmosphere. The forms, the  
textures and the qualities of plants are still more  
  
consist o: precisely the same elements, requires  
more procf than has yet been offered.  
  
A case which has veen relied on to prove that  
different foods are not necessary for different  
plants, is that of grafting or inoculating one kind  
of plant on another kind ; the sap obtained by the  
stock for itself, being found to feed and perfect  
the graft. But this operation has its limits. It  
does not extend beyond plants having a certain  
affinity The Apple Tree may be planted on the  
Pear or the Quince. It will not succeed on the  
Peach or the Cherry. If the cases prove that  
the same food suffices for the Apple and the  
Pear, they equally prove that different foods are  
required for the Apple and the Peach. It is  
said even, that the fruit from the Peach graft on  
the Almond, is not precisely the same with that  
from a Peach graft on a Plum.  
  
It may be offered as another argument to the  
same effect, that all animal and vegetable de-  
compositions answer indiscriminately as manures.  
The fact is not precisely so. Certain manures  
succeed best with certain plants. It is true, ne-  
vertheless, that animal and vegetable substances  
  
  
  
” a decomposed state, are generally manures  
  
for plants. Fish, even an animal from the water,  
is successfully used as a manure for Indian Corn  
and other crops. But this and similar examples  
prove only, that some ingredients are the same  
in all animals and plants, not that all the ingre-  
dients in each are the same.  
  
The chemist, though as yet a fellow student  
as much as a preceptor of the agriculturist, just-  
ly claims attention to the result of his processes.  
From that source we learn that the number of  
known elements, not yet decomposabie, is be-  
tween forty and fifty; that about seven or eight  
belong to the organs of plants, that different ele-  
ments enter into the composition of the same  
plant; and that they are combined in different  
numbers and in different proportions, in differ-  
ent plants. Supposing then, as must be suppo-  
sed, that these different elements, in their actual  
quanti! ies and proportions, are adapted to the  
quantities and the proportions of the existing va-  
rieties of plants; it would happen in so great a  
  
  
  
jpumber and variety of plants, that the quantities  
and the proportions of the elements, would not

of plants retained by manor his own use. Like  
the types of the Alphabet, apportioned to the  
words composing a particular book, when ap-  
plied to another book materially different in its!  
contents, there would be, of some a deficiency,  
of others, a useless surplus.  
  
Were it less dificult to admit that all the  
sources of productiveness could be exclusively  
appropriated to the food of man, is it certain that  
an obstacle to his indefinite multiplication would  
not be encountered in one of the relations be-  
tween the atmosphere and organized beings?  
  
Animals, including man, and plants may be-  
regarded as the most important part of the ter  
restrial creation. They are pre-eminent in their  
attributes; and all nature teems with their va.  
‘ieties and their multitudes, visible and invisible.

of life. Deprived of it, they all equally perish.

its destined purpose, of supporting the life and  
health of organized beings. Is it unreasonable  
to suppose, that if, instead of the actual compo-  
sition and character of the animal and vegetable  
creation, to which the atmosphere is now accom-  
  
that creation were substituted, as would result  
from a reduction of the whole to man and a few  
kinds of animals and plants; is the supposition  
unreasonable, that the change might essentially  
affect the aptitude of the atmosphere for the  
functions required of it; and that so great an in-  
novation might be found, in this respect, not to  
accord with the order and economy of nature?  
  
The relation of the animal part, and the vege-  
table part of the creation to each other, through  
  
the reflection suggested by the general relation  
between the atmosphere and both. It seems to  
be now well understood, that the atmosphere  
when respired by animals becomes unfitted for  
  
vegetables ; and that when evolved by the latter,  
it is refitted for the respiration of the former:  
an interchange being thus kept up, by which this  
breath of life is received by each, in a wholesome  
state, in return for it in an unwholesome one.  
May it not be concluded from this admirable  
arrangement and beautiful feature in the econo-  
my of nature, that if the whole class of animals  
were extinguished, the use of the atmosphere by  
the vegetable class alone, would exhaust it of its  
life-supporting power; that in like manner, if  
the whole class of vegetables were extinguished,  
the use of it by the animal class alone, would de-  
prive it of its fitness for their support ? And if  
such would be the effect of an entire destruction  
of either class, in relation to the other, the in-  
ference seems to press itself upon us, that so vast  
  
‘a change in the proportions of each class to the  
other, and in the species composing the respec-  
  
tive classes, as that in question might not be  
compatible with the continued existence and  
health of the remaining species of the two classes.  
  
The immensity of the atmosphere, compared  
with the mass of animals and vegetables, forms  
al apparent objection only to this view of tle  
subject. The comparison could at most suggest  
questions as to the period of time necessary to  
exhaust the atmosphere of its unrenewed ca-  
pacity to keep alive animal or vegetable na-  
ture, when deprived, either, of the support of  
the other. And this period contracts itself at  
once.to the imagination, when it is recollected

of its elasticity and rarefaction. We know eens  
the barometer, that condefsed to the specific  
gravity of Mercury, its rise above the surface of  
the earth would be but about thirty inches; and  
from the well pump, that condensed to the spe-  
cific gravity only of water, which is nearly the  
same with that of the human body, its rise would  
be little more than as many feet; that is, a little  
more than five times the human stature. It is  
found that a single human person employs in  
respiration not !ess than sixteen or eighteen times  
his own weight of common air, in every 24  
hours. In different degrees, some greater, some  
less, the case is the same with most other ani-  
mals. Plants make a correspondent use of air  
for their purposes.  
  
Other views of the economy of nature coin-  
cide with the preceding. There is a known ten-  
dency in all organized beings to multiply beyond  
the degree necessary to keep up their actual  
numbers, It is a wise provision of nature—!, to  
guard against the failure of the species: 2, to  
afford in the surplus, a food for animals whether  
subsisting on vegetables, or on other animals  
which subsist on vegetables. Nature has been  
equally provident in guarding against an exces-  
sive multiplication of any one species which  
might too far encroach on others, by subjecting  
each, when unduly multiplying itself, to be ar-  
rested in its progress by the effect of the mullti-  
plication—1, in producing a deficiency of food ;  
and where that may not happen,—2, in produc-  
ing a state of the atmosphere unfavourable to  
life and health. All animals, as well as plants,  
sicken and die in a state too much crowded. It  
is the case with our domestic animals of every  
sort, where no scarcity for food can be the cause.  
To the same laws mankind are equally subject.  
An increase, not consisting with the general plan  
of nature, arrests itself—According to the de-  
gree in which the number thrown together ex-  
ceeds the due proportion of space and air, dis-  
ease and mortality ensue. It was the vitiated air  
alone which put out human life in the crowded  
hole of Calcutta. In a space somewhat enlarged,  
the effect would have been slower, but not less  
certain. In all confined situations, from the dun-  
geon, to the crowded workhouses, and from these,  
to the compact population of overgrown cities,  
the atmosphere becomes in corresponding de-  
grees unfitted by reiterated use, for sustaining  
human life and health. Were the atmosphere  
breathed in cities not diluted, and displaced by  
fresh supplies from the surrounding country,  
the mortality would soon become general.—  
Were the surrounding country thickly peopled  
and not refreshed in like manner, the decay of  
health, though a later, would be a necessary  
consequence. And were the whole habitable  
earth covered with a dense population, wasteful  
maladies might be looked for, that would thin  
Dumbers into a healthy proportion,

Were the earth in every productive spot, and  
in every spot capable of being made productive,  
appropriated to the food of man; were the  
spade substituted for the plough, and all animals  
consuming the food of man, or food for which

it; or if that supposition be admissable when li-  
mited to a single country, can it be admitted,  
when not only the contiguous countries, but the  
whole earth was equally crowded ?  
  
Must we then adopt the opinion entertained

ganized beings belonging to our globe, is per-  
mitted by the system of nature; that the num-

the same ; that the only change possible is in lo-

to a planter of tobacco or of Indian corn, who  
finds the soil annually producing less and less,  
under a consiant pulverizing course. The known  
experiment of Van-Helmont seemed to favour  
the opposite theory, that the earth parted with  
nothing towards the plants growing on it. |  
there were no illusion in the case, the earth used  
by him must, at least, have been destitute of ve-  
getable mould. For, inan experiment by Wood-  
house, a garden mould was diminished in its  
weight by a plant which grew init. And the  
latest chemical examinations of the subject coin-  
cide with the general opinion of practical hus-  
  
bandmen that the substance of plants, partakes  
  
of the substance of the soil.  
The idea, is indeed, very natural that vegeta-  
  
ble matter which springs from the earth, and of  
  
itself returns to the carth, should be one source  
at least of th earth’s capacity to re-produce ve-  
getable matter.  
  
It has been asked how it happens that Egypt  
and Sicily, which have for ages been exporting  
  
their agricultural produce without a return of!  
  
any equivalent produce, have not lost their re-  
productive capacity. One answer has been, that  
they have lost no small degree of it. If the fact  
be otherwise with regard to Egypt, it might be  
accounted &#x27;or by the fertilizing inundations of the  
Nile. Witb regard to Sicily, there may be  
something in the system of husbandry, or some  
particular local circumstances, which counter-  
vail the continued exportation of the fruits of the  
soil. But it is far more probable, that the island  
is less productive than it once was. It is certain-  
ly less of a granary for other countries now, than  
it was when 1: received that title from the ancient  
Romans. And its population being diminished,  
the internal consumption must also be diminish-  
ed. Ifa single farm is rendered less productive  
by a continued removal of its crops, without any  
adequate returns, no reason occurs why it should  
not happen to a number of farms multiplied  
to the extent of a whole country.  
  
And that individual farms do lose their fertility  
in proportion as crops are taken from them, and  
returns of manure neglected, is a fact not likely  
to be questioned.

manures has been particularly neglected.  
  
Tobacco and Indian Corn, which for a long  
time on the east side of the Blue Mountains were  
the articles almost exclusively cultivated, and  
which continue to be cultivated, the former ex-  
tensively, the latter universally, are known to be  
great impoverishers of the soil. Wheat, which  
has for a number of years, formed a large por-  
tion of the general crop, is also an exhausting  
crop. So are rye and oats which enter occa-  
Sionally into our farming system.  
  
With so many consumers of the fertility of the  
earth, and so little attention to the means of re-  
pairing their ravages, no one can be surprised  
at the impoverished face of the country ; whilst  
every one ought to be desirous of aiding in the  
work of reformation,  
  
The first and main step towards it, is, to make  
the thieves restore as much as possible of the  
stolen fertility. On this, with other improve-  
ments which may be made in our husbandry, we  
  
must depend for the rescue of our farms from  
their present degraded condition.  
  
Of Tobacco, not a great deal more than one  
half of the entire plant is carried to market. The  
residue is an item on the list of manures: and it  
is known to be in its quality a very rich one. The  
crop of tobacco, however, though of great value,  
  
ground, and its offal can of course contribute but  
inconsiderably to the general stock of manure.  
It is probable also that what it does contribute,  
has been more carefully used as a manure, than  
any other article furnished by our crops.  
  
The article which constitutes our principal ma-  
nure is wheat straw. Ii is of much importance  
therefore to decide aright on the mode of using  
it. There are three modes :—1. Carrying it from  
the farm yard, after having passed through or  
being trodden and enriched by cattle. In that  
mode, the greater part of it must be used, if  
used at all: the straw going through that pro-  
cess, being a necessary part of the food allotted  
to the cattle. To derive the full advantage from  
it, it ought to be hauled out before the substance  
has been wasted by rain, by the sun, and by wind ;  
and to be buried in the earth as soon after as pos-  
sible. 2. Spreading the straw on the surface of,  
the ground. Many respectable farmers are at-  
tached to this mode, as protecting the soil from  
the sun: and by keeping it moist, favouring the  
vegetation underneath, whether spontaneous or  
artificial ; whilst the straw itself is gradually de-  
composed into a manure. ‘The objection to this  
mode is the loss by evaporation, before this last  
effect is obtained. 3. Turning the straw at once  
under the surface of the earth. This would seem  
to be the best mode of managing manures gene-  
rally ; least of their substance being then lost.  
When the grain is trodden out from the straw,  
it is left in a state easily admitting this operation.  
Some difficulty may attend it, when the grain is  
threshed from the straw by the flail or by the  
machines now in use, neither of which break the  
straw sufficiently to pieces.  
  
It may be remarked with regard to this arti-  
cle of manure—1. That its weight is barely more  
  
  
  
‘most part not consumed within the farm. It is  
ifound on trial that a stalk of wheat, as generally  
icut, including the chaff, and the grains borne  
by the stalk, are pretty nearly of equal weight.  
\The case is probably the same with rye ; and not  
very different with oats. The proportion of fer-  
tilizing rnatter in the straw, to that in the grain,  
thas not, as far as I know, been brought to any  
satisfactory test. It is doubtless much less in the  
straw, which alone in the case of wheat, is with  
jus returnable in any form to the earth. This  
consideration, whilst it urges us to make the most  
iof the article asa manure, warns us of its insuf-  
ficiency.  
  
The stubble and the roots of the small grains,  
not being taken from the earth, may be regard-  
ed as relapsing into a fertility equal to that of  
which they deprived the earth. This remark is  
applicable to ail cultivated plants, the roots of  
which are not an esculent part.

rist® of this state, has among other instructive  
lessons, called the public attention to the value  
of the cornstock as a manure. I am persuaded  
that he has not overrated it—And it is a subject  
of agreeable reflection, that an article which is  
so extensively cultivated as that of Indian corn,  
and which is so particularly exhausting, should  
‘be the one so capable of repairing the injury it  
dloes.  
  
The corn stock as a fodder is of great value.  
Not only the leaves, but the husk enclosing the  
ear, and tlie cob enclosed by it, are all more or  
less valuable food when duly preserved and dealt  
out to cattle. There is no better fodder than the  
leaves or blades for horses and oxen; nor any so  
much approved for sheep. The husk or shuck  
  
  
  
jis a highly nourishing food for neat cattle. And  
  
ithe pickings of the stalk, even at a late season,  
‘and after much exposure to the weather, support  
them better than any of the straws. From the  
saccharine matter in the stalk, which is long re-  
tained about the joints, it cannot be doubted that  
if cut early, or before exposure to the weather,  
into parts small enough for mastification, it would  
well repay, as a food for cattle, the labour re-  
quired for it.  
  
The great value of the corn stalk, in all its  
parts as a fodder, was brought into full proof, by  
the use made of it during the late general failure  
of crops. It is to be hoped that the lesson will  
not be suffered to pass into oblivion.

But itis a resource for re- fertilizing the soil,  
that the corn stock finds the proper place here ;  
and as such it merits particular notice ; whe-  
ther it be passed through animals ; or be pre-  
pared by fermentation in the farm yard ; or be  
merely spread on the surface of the earth, the  
mode in which its effect must be least consi-  
derable. The same qualities which render eve-  
ry part of it nutricious to animals, render it nu-  
tricious to the earth, and it is accompanied with  
the peculiar advantages: 1, that the grain it-  
self is mostly every where, and altogether, in  
places distant from navigation, consumed with-  
in the farms producing it; 2, that as the grain  
is in greater proportion to the space on which  
it grows, than most other grains, so the rest of  
the plant is in greater proportion to the grain,  
than the rest of any other grain plant. The  
straw and chaff of the smaller grains, as already  
remarked, is in weight but about one half the  
grain. Tbe corn stock with all its appurtenant  
offal, is of not less than three times, and if  
taken carly from the field, probably of not less  
than four or five times the weight of the grain  
belonging to it; 5, the fertilizing matter con-  
tained in the corn stock is greater, in propor-  
tion to its weight, than that contained in the  
straw and offal of other grains is to the weight  
of the straw and offal.  
  
Would it be hazarding too much to say, that  
where a level surface, or the mode of cultiva-  
ting a hilly one, prevents the rays from carry-  
ing off the soil, a restoration of an entire crop  
of Indian corn, in the form of manure, to the  
space producing it (there being no other inter-  
vening crop not so restored) would replace the  
fertility consumed by the crop, and maintain a  
perpetual productiveness ? Reason, the case of  
forest and fallow fields, where the spontaneous  
crop falls back of itself, to the earth, and the  
Chinese example, where the cultivated crop is  
restored to the earth, all pronounce that such  
would be the efiect. And yet the fact stares  
us in the face, that our most impoverished  
fields, even the most level of them, owe their  
condition more to the crops of Indian corn,  
than to any other crops.  
  
The articles of fodder which are least ne-  
glected as a fund of manure, are timothy and  
clover hay. But the everage quantities on farms  
are not as yet very great; and seldom yield  
more than stable manure for gardens and culi-  
  
crop, in the more Southern and the South-wes-  
tern States, is but little cultivated in Virginia,  
and scarcely at all in this part of it. I am not  
able to say how far it is comparatively an ex  
hausting crop. But it would seem to be more  
capable than any other crop, not wholly con-

increased Ly ordinary Cultivation, to the soil on  
which it grew, would, I presume, fertilize i)  
more than the restoration of a smalier crop  
spontaneously produced ; although in both  
cases, the whole taken from the soil would re.  
turn to it.  
  
1V. Among the means of aiding the pro-  
ductiveness of the soil, which have not received  
merited attention, is irrigation. In scarcely  
any country does this resource abound more  
than in the United States; nor is there any  
where so little sensibility to its value. The  
inconsiderable use made of it, is chiefly by  
emigrants, particularly Germans or the im-  
mediate descendants of them. I have under-  
stood that the market of Baltimore has beer  
much benefitted in dry seasons, by the irriga-  
tion introduced by exiles from S:. Domingo  
For » distinguished proof of the importance of  
the practice, I may refer to the fact which has  
been stated, that in the neigbourhood of Ba:  
celona in Spain, where a part of the land is un-  
der irrigation, and a part 13 not suscep ible of  
it, both being otherwise of equal fertility, the  
part irrigated is of double price in the market.  
It i: to be noted indeed that the climate is  
dry one, and that the article cultivated is Lu-  
cerne. But this is a plant, which though muci  
aided in its growth by moisture, is at the same  
time remarkable for the length of a tap-root,  
and fitted by that, as well as by the absorben  
quality of its leaves, to flourish in a thirsty  
soil ard warm climate. Our particular district  
of country, abounding in springs, small strean:s  
and suitable declivities, admits greatly of ir-  
rigation ; and being generally of a thirsty na-  
ture, the more strongly invites the use of it.  
  
V. I cannot but consider it as en error in our  
husbandry, that oxen are too little used in  
place of horses.  
  
Every fair comparison of the expence of the  
two animals, favors a preference of the ox —  
  
ut, the circumstance particularly recom-  
  
Spprsin him is, that he can be suppor&#x27;ed when  
at work by grass and hay ; whilst the horse re-  
quires grain, and much of it; and the grain  
generally given him is Indian corn, the crop  
which requires most labour and greatly ex-  
hausts the land,  
  
From the best estimate I have been enabled  
to form, more than one half of the corn crop is  
consumed by horses, including the ungrown  
ones; and not less than one half, by other  
than pleasure horses. By getting free from  
this consumption, one half the labour and of the  
wear of the land would be saved, or rather  
more than one half; for on most farms, one  
half of the crop of corn grows on not more than  
two-fifths, and sometimes a smaller proportion  
of the cultivated fields; and the more fertilc  
fields would of course be retained for cultive-  
tion. Every one can figure to himself the ease  
and conveniency of.a revolution which would  
so much reduce the extent of his cornfields ;  
and substitute for the labour bestowed on them,  
the more easy task of providing pasturage and  
hay.  
  
labour require grain food as weil as the horse.  
Certainly much less, if any. Judging from my  
own observation, I should say, that a plenty of  
good grass or good hay, will suffice without  
grain, where the labour is neither constant nor  
severe. Bui I feel entire confidence in saying,  
that a double set of oxen alternately at work,  
and therefore half the time at rest, might be  
kept in good plight without other food than a  
plenty of good grass or good hay. And as this  
double set would double the supply of beef,  
tallow and leather, a set off is found in that  
consideration for a double consumption of that  
kind of food. —  
  
The objections generally made to the ox  
are—1. That he is less tractable than the  
horse. 2. That he does not bear heat as weil.  
3. That he does not answer for the single  
plough used in our cornfields. 4. That he is  
slower in his movements. 5. That he is less  
fit for carrying the produce of the farm to mar-  
ket.  
  
The first objection is certainly founded in  
mistake. Of the two animals, the ox is the  
more docile. In all countries where the ox is  
the ordinary draught animal, his docility is pro-  
verbial. His intractability, where it exists, has  
arisen from an occasional use of him only, with  
long and irregular intervals ;—during which,  
the habit of discipline being broken, a new one  
is to be formed.  
  
The second objection has as little foundation.  
The constitution of the ox accommodates it-  
self, as readily as that of the horse, to differen:  
climates. Not only in ancient Gr« ece and Italy  
but throughout Asia, as presented to us in an-  
cient history, the ox and the plough are asso-  
ciated. At this day, in the warm parts of Indi.  
ind China, the ox, not the horse, is in the  
draught service. In every part of Iria, the ox  
always appears, even in the train of her armies  
—And in the hottest parts of the West Indies,  
the ox is employed in hauling the weighty pro  
duce to the sea ports. The mistake here, as  
in the former case, has arisen from the effec  
of an occasional employment only, with no  
other than green food. The fermentation of  
this in the animal heated by the weather, and  
fretted by the discipline, will readily account  
for his sinking under his exertions : when green  
food even, much less dry, with a sober habit  
of labour, would have no such tendency.  
  
The third objection also, is not a solid one.  
The ox can, by a proper harness, be used sing-  
ly as well as the horse, between the rows of In  
dian corn; and equally so used fur other pur-  
poses. Experience may be safely appealed to  
on this point.  
  
In the fourth place, it is alleged that he is  
slower in his movements. This is true; but  
in aless degree thau is often taken for granted.  
Oxen that are well ehosen for their form are not  
worked after the age of about eight years (the  
age at which they are best fitted for beef,) are  
not worked too many together, and are suitably  
matched, may be kept to nearly as quick a step  
as the horse. May I not say, a step quicker  
  
who, on account of their age, or the lewnness  
occasioned by the costliness of the food they  
require, lose the advantage where they migh  
have once had it?  
  
The last objection has most weight. The ox  
is not as weli adapted as the horse to the road  
service, especially forlong trips. In common  
roads, which are often soft, and sometimes sud-  
denly become so, the form of his foot and the  
shortness of his leg, are disadvantages ; and on  
roads frozen or turnpiked, the roughness of  
ithe surface in the former case, and its hardness  
in both cases, are inconvenient to his cloven  
hoof. But where the distance to market is not  
great, where the varying state of the roads and  
of the weather, can be consulted ; and where  
the road service is less in proportion to the  
farm service, the objection is almost deprived  
ofits weight. In cases where it most applies,  
its weight.is diminished by the consideration,  
that a much greater proportion of service on  
the farm may be done by oxen, than is now com-  
monly done ; end that the expence of shoeing  
them is little different from that of keeping  
horses shod. It is observable, that when oxen  
are worked on the farm, over rough frozen  
ground, they suffer so much from the want ot  
shoes, however weil fed they may be, that it is  
a proper subject for celculation, whether true  
economy does not require for them, that ac-  
commodation, even on the farm, as well as for  
the horses.  
  
A more important calculation is, whether,  
in many situations, the general saving by sub-  
stituting the ox for the horse, would not  
balance the expence of hiring a carriage of the  
produce to market. In the same scale with the  
nire, is to be put the value of the grass and  
lay consumed by the oxen; and in the other  
scale, the value of the corn, amounting ta one  
balf of the crop, and of the grass and hay con-  
sumed by the horses. Where the market is  
no: distant, the value of the corn saved, would  
certainly pay for the carriage of the market  
portion of (he crop, and balance, mereover, any  
difference between the value of the grass and  
hay consumed by oxen, and the value of the  
oxen when slaughtered for beef. In all these  
calculations, it is doubtiess proper not to lose  
sight of the rule, that farmers ought to avoid  
paying others for doing what they can do for  
themselves. But the rule has its exceptions  
and the error, if it be committed. will not lie  
in departing from the rule, but in not selecting  
aright the cases which call for the departure.  
It may be remarked, that the rule ought to be  
more or less general, as there may, or may not  
be at hand, a market by which every produce  
of labour is convertible into money. In the old  
countries, this is much more the case, than in  
new; and in new, much more the case near  
towns, than at a distance fromthem. In this,  
as in most other parts of our country, a change  
of circumstances is taking place, which renders  
every thing raised on a farm more convertible  
into money than formerly ; and as the change  
proceeds, it will be more and more a point for

migi!. ve bought, could earn more in another}  
way, than the smount of the purchase. Still iv  
will lways be prudent, for reasons which every!  
experienced farmer will understand, to lean to  
the side of doing, rather than hiring or buying  
what may be wanted.  
  
Tie mule seems to be in point of economy,  
between the ox and the horse, preferable to  
the latter, inferior to the former, but so well  
adapted to particular services, that he may find  
a proper place on many farms. He is liable to  
the objection which weighs most against the  
ox. He is less fitted than the horse for road  
service.  
  
VI. A more manifest error in the husbandry  
of the older se.tlements is that of keeping too  
many neat cattle on the farms. As a farm  
should not be cultivated farther than it can be  
continued in good heurt, the stock of cattle  
should not be in greater number than the re  
sources of food will keep in good plight. Ifa  
poor farm be unprofitable, so are poor cattle.  
It is particularly the case with the milch cows.  
When the whol of the food given them is ne-  
cessary to support a lean existence, no par!  
can be spared for the milch pail The same  
food given to the proper number, will rot only  
keep them in a thrifty state, but enable them  
to supply the dairy. Even the manure from  
several poor c-ttle is worth less than that from  
a single fat one. The remark holds equaily  
good with respect to the hide.  
  
The misjudged practice in question, is another  
effect of inattention to the change of circumstan-  
ces through which our country has passed.—  
Originally the forest abounded in rich herbage  
which fed and fatted, without expence, all the  
cattle that could be brought through the winter  
into the spring. It was natural, at that time, to  
keep as large a stock as could be preserved  
through the winter. For a long time past, the  
forest is scarcely any where, a resource for more  
than two or three months. and in many places  
no resource at all. A greater difficulty is often  
felt in finding summer, than winter subsistence.  
And yet, where no inclosed pasturage is provi  
ded to take the place of the extinct one in the  
forest, the habit, founded in reasons which have  
entirely ceased, is but too generally retained.—  
The same number of cattle is aimed at, as if the  
forest was as ready to receive and fatten them  
now, as formerly. ‘The size and appearance of  
‘our neat cattle, compared with those for which  
nature or good husbandry has provided sufficient  
food, are proofs that their food is not in propor-  
tion to their number ; and that, where the food  
  
obstacle to their settlement, and cultivation.—  
The great effort was of course to destroy the  
trees. It would seem that they contracted and  
transmitted an antiphathy to them ; for the trees  
were not even spared around the. dwellings  
where their shade would have been a comfort  
and their beauty an ornament ; and it is of late  
years only, that these advantages have been at-  
tended to. In fact, such has been the inconsi-  
derate and indiscriminate use of the axe, that  
this country is beginning to feel the calamity as  
much as some of the old countries of Europe ;—  
and it will soon be forced to understand the dif-  
ficulty of curing it. A vast proportion of the  
farms on the eastern side of the Blue Ridge, and  
some even on the other side, have but a scanty  
fund for present use, and are without a fund for  
permanent use. And to increase the evil, the  
remnant of timber and fuel on many farms, ina-  
dequate as itis. is left in situations remote from  
the dwelling, and incapable of being divided ac-  
cording to the divisions and sub-divisions into  
which all the large farms must be rapidly forced  
by the law of descendents, the impulses of par-  
ental affection, and other causes.  
  
Tt is high time for many farmers, even in this  
quarter, and still more so in the country below  
us, to take this subject into serious consideration  
—Prudence will no longer delay to economize  
what remains of wood land ; to foster the second  
growths, where tak ine place in convenient spots  
—and to commence, when necessary, plantations  
of the trees recommended by their utility and  
quickness of growth.  
  
T wish Tconld more satisfactorily estimate the  
pronortion of wood land which ought to belong to

It is a trite but just remark, “that every farm  
which is in good heart, should be kept so, and every  
one not in good heart should be made so.” This should  
be held as a fundamental principle in the creed ot  
every land owner; the late president of the United  
States has observed in his learned address to the  
Agricultural Society of Albemarie, in illustration of  
this maxim, “ that any system or want of system,  
which tends to make a rich farm poor, or dees not  
tend to make a poor farm rich, cannot be good for  
the owner ; the profits where there are any, will not  
balance the loss of intrinsic value sustained by the  
land ; that every acre made by improved manage-  
ment, to produce as much as two acres, is in effect  
the addition of a new acre, with the great advantage  
of contracting the space to be cultivated, and of  
shortening the distance of transportation ;” thus th

might have lived in comfort, and acquired pro-  
perty upon a small one. It has been said, that  
the man who makes two blades of grass grow  
where but one grew before, is greater than Cesar,  
and that the man who, by good management,

quoting one of the Roman writers on husbandry,

daughters and a vineyard. When the eldest was

OF THE HORSE AND OX. By President Madison.  
I cannot but consider it as an error in our hus­  
bandry, that oxen are too little used in place of  
horses. .  
Every fair comparison of the strength of the two  
animals, favors a preference of the ox. But, the  
.circumstance particularly recommending him is that  
he can be supported when at work with grass and  
hay ; whilst the horse requires grain, and much of  
it ; and the grain generally given him is Indian corn,  
the crop which requires most labour, and greatly  
exhausts the laud.  
From the best estimate I have been enabled to  
form, more than one half of the corn crop is con­  
sumed by horses, including the ungrown ones ; and  
not less than one half by other than pleasure horses.  
By getting free from this consumption, one half the  
labor and of the wear of the land&#x27; would be saved,  
or rather more than one half: for on most farms,  
one half of the crop of corn grows? on not more than  
twofifths, and sometimes a smaller portion of the  
cultivated field, and the more fertile fields would of  
course be retained for cultivation. Evpfw rn n ran

the United States ; and that this state has at least its full share of  
the blame. Now only, for the first time, notwithstanding several  
meritorious examples of earlier date, a general attention seems to -  
be awakened to the necessity of areform. Patriotic societies, the  
best agents for effecting it, are pursuing the object with the ani-  
mation and intelligence which characterize the efforts of a self-go-  
verned people, whatever be the objects to which they may be di-  
rected.  
  
There cannot be a more rational principle in the code of agri-  
culture, than that every farm which is in good heart, should be kept  
so; that every one not in good heart, should be made so; and that  
what is right as to the farm, generally, is so as to every part of  
every farm. Any system, therefore, or want of system, which  
tends to make a rich farm poor, or does not tend to make a poor  
farm rich, cannot be good for the owner, whatever it may be for  
the tenant or superintendant, who has a transient interest only in it.  
The profit, where there is any, will not balance the loss of in.  
trinsic value sustained by the land.  
  
The neglect of manures is an error which claims particular notice.  
It may be traced to the same cause with excessive cropping.—In  
the early stages of our agriculture, it was more convenient, and  
more profitable, to ring new land into cultivation, than to improve  
exhausted land. The failure of new land has long called for the  
improvement of old land; but habit has kept us deaf to the call.  
  
Nothing is more certain, than that continual cropping without  
manure, deprives the soil of its fertility. It is equally certain, that  
fertility may be preserved or restored, by giving to the earth ani-  
mal or vegetable manure, equivalent to the matter taken from it;  
and that a perpetual fertility is not, in itself, incompatible with an  
uninterrupted succession of the crops. ‘The Chinese, it is said,  
smile at the idea, that land needs rest, as if like animals it hada  
sense of fatigue. Their soil does not need rest, because an indus-  
trious use is made of every fertilizing particle that can contribute  
towards replacing what has been drawn from it. And this is the  
more practicable with them, as almost the whole of what is grown  
on their farms, is consumed within them. That a restoration to  
the earth of ail that annually grows on it, prevents its impoverish-  
ment, is sufficiently seen in our forests, where the annual exuvie of  
the trees and plants, replace the fertility of which they deprive

the earth. Where frequent fires destroy the leaves, and whatever  
else is annually dropped on the earth, it is well known that the land  
becomes poorer: this destruction of the natural crop, having the  
  
same impoverishing effect, as a removal of a cultivated crop.—  
  
A still stronger proof, that an annual restoration to the earth, of all  
  
its annual product, will perpetuate its productiveness, is seen where  
  
our fields are left uncultivated and unpastured. In this case, the  
  
soil receiving from the decay of the spontaneous weeds and grasses,  
  
more fertility than they extract from it, is, for a time at least, im-  
proved, not impoverished. Its improvement may be explained, by  
the fertilizing matter which the weeds and grasses derive from wa-  
ter and the atmosphere, which forms a nett gain to the earth. At  
what point, or from what cause, the formation and accumulation of  
vegetable mould from this gain ceases, is not, perhaps, very easy  
tobe explained. That it does cease, is proved by the stationary  
condition of the surface of the earth in old forests; and that the  
amount of the accumulation varies with the nature of the subjacent  
earth, is equally certain. It seems to depend, also, on the species  
of trees and plants, which happen to contribute the materials for  
the vegetable mould.  
  
But the most eligible mode of preserving the richness, and of en-  
riching the poverty of a farm, is certainly that of applying to the  
soil a sufficiency of animal and vegetable matter in a putrefied state,  
or a state ready for putrefaction; in order to procure which, too  
much care cannot be observed in saving every material furnished  
by the farm. This resource was among the earliest discoveries of  
men living by agriculture ; and a proper use of it has been made  
a test of good husbandry, in all countries, ancient and modern,  
where its principles and profits have been studied.

the straw on the surface of the ground. Many respectable farmers  
are attached to this mode, as protecting the soil from the sun; and  
by keeping it moist, favouring the vegetation underneath, whether  
spontaneous or artificial ; whilst the straw itself is gradually de-  
composed into a manure. The objection to this mode, is the loss  
by evaporation, before this last effect is obtained. 3. Turning the  
straw at once under the surface of the earth. This would seem  
to be the best mode of managing manures generally ; least of their  
substance being then lost. When the grain is trodden out from the  
straw, it is left in a state easily admitting this operation. Some  
difficulty may attend it, when the grain is thrashed from the straw,  
by the flail, or by the machines now in use, neither of which break  
the straw sufficiently to pieces.

An eminent citizen and celebrated agriculturist* of this state,  
has among other instructive lessons, called the public attention to  
the value of the corn stalk as a manure. I am persuaded that he  
has not overrated it. And it isa subject of agreeable reflection,  
that an article which is so extensively cultivated as that of Indian  
corn, and which is so particularly exhausting, should be the one so  
capable of repairing the injury it does. The corn stalk as a fod-  
der is of great value. Not only the leaves, but the husk enclosing  
the ear, and the cob enclosed by it, are all more or less valuable  
food, when duly preserved and dealt out to cattle. ‘There is no  
better fodder than the leaves or blades for horses and oxen ; nor  
any so much approved for sheep; the husk or shuck is a highly  
nourishing food for neat cattle. And the pickings of the stalk,  
even at a late season, and after much exposure to the weather, sup-  
port them better than any of the straws. From the saccharine  
matter in the stalk, which is long retained about the joints, it cannot  
be doubted that if cut early, or before exposure to the weather, into  
parts small enough for mastication, it would well repay, as a food  
for cattle, the labour required for it.  
  
The great value of the corn stalk, in all its parts, as a fodder,  
was brought into full proof, by the use made of it, during the late  
general failure of crops. It is to be hoped that the lesson will not  
be suffered to pass into oblivion.  
  
But it is as a resource for re-fertilizing the soil, that the corn  
stalk finds the proper place here ; and as such it merits particula

The sum of these remarks on cultivating poor land, and neglect-  
ing the means of keeping or making land rich, is, that if every  
thing grown on a soil is carried from it, it must become unproduc-  
tive ; that if every thing grown on it, be directly or indirectly res-  
tored to it, it would not cease to be productive: and, consequently,  
that according to the degree in which the one or the other practice  
takes place, a farm must be impoverished, or be permanently pro-  
ductive and profitable. Every acre made by animproved manage-  
ment to produce as much as two acres, is in effect the addition of  
a new acre ; with the great advantage of contracting the space to  
be cultivated, and of shortening the distance of transportation be-  
tween the fields andthe barn or the farm-yard. One of the Ro-  
man writers* on husbandry, enforces the obligation to improved  
management, by a story of one Paridius, who had two daughters  
and a vineyard ; when the elder was married, he gave her a third

ON THE HORSE AND OX.  
By President Madison.  
  
IT cannot but consider it as an error in our hus-  
bandry, that oxen are too litthe used in place of  
horses.  
  
Every fair comparison of the expense of the  
two aniinals, favors a preference ofthe ox. But,  
the circumstance particularly recommending him,  
is that he can be supported when at work, by  
grass and hay : while the horse requires grain, and  
much of it,and the grain generally given him is  
Indian corn, the crop which requires most labor,  
and greatly exhausts the land.  
  
From the best estimate I have been enabled to  
form, more than one half of the corn crop is con-  
sumed by horses, including the ungrown ones ;  
and not less than one half, by other than pleasure  
horses. By getting free from this consumptiony  
one halfof the labor and of the wear of the land  
would be saved, or rather more than one half. For  
on most farms, one half of the crop of corn grows  
on not more than two fifths, and sometimes a small-  
er proportion of the cultivated fields ; and the  
more fertile fields would of course be retained for  
cultivation, Every one can figure to himself the  
ease and conveniency ofa revolution, which  
would so much reduce the extent of his corn-  
fields : and substitute for the labor bestowed on  
them, the more easy task of providing pasturage  
and hay.  
  
But will not the ox himself, when kept at labor,  
require grain food as well as the horse ? Certainly  
much less, if any. Judging from my own obser-  
vation I should say, that aplenty of good grass  
or good hay, will suffice without grain, where the  
labor is neither constant nor severe. But I feel  
entire confidence in saying, that a double set of  
oxen alternately at work, and therefore half the  
time at rest, might be kept in good plight with-  
out other food than a plenty of good grass or good  
hay. And as this double set would double the  
supply of beef, tallow and leather, a set offis found  
in that consideration fora double consumption of  
that kind of food.  
  
The objections generally made to the ox, are,  
viz: 1. That heis less tractable than the horse.  
2. That he does not bear heat as well, 3. That  
he does not answer for the single plough used in  
our cornfields. 4. That he is slower in his move-  
ments. 5. That he is less fit for carrying the  
produce of the farm to market.  
  
The first objection is certainly founded in mis-  
take. Ofthe two animals, the ox is the most  
docile. In all countries where the ox is the or-  
dinary draught animal, his docility is prover-  
bial. His intractability, where it exists, has arisen  
from an occasional use of him only with long and  
irregular intervals ; during which, the habit of dis-  
cipline belng broken, a new one isto be formed,  
  
The second objection has but as little founda-  
tion. The constitution of the ox accommodates  
itself, as readily as that of the horse, to different  
climates.—Not only in ancient Greece and Italy,  
but throughout Asia, as presented to us in ancient  
history, the oxand the plough are associated. At  
this day, in the warm parts of India and China,  
the ox, not the horse, is in the draught service. In  
every part of India, the ox always appeared, even  
in the train of her armies. And in the hottest  
parts of the West Indies, the ox is employed in  
hauling the weighty produce to the sea ports,  
The mistake here, asin the former case, has arisen  
from the effects cf occasional employment only,  
  
A ETRE ATE RI eR VR os WOR  
  
with no other than green fuod. The fermentation  
of this in the animal heated by the weather, and  
fretted by discipline, will readily account for his  
sinking under his exertion ; when green food even,  
much Jess dry, with a sober habit of labor, would  
have no such tendency.  
  
The third objection also, is not a solid one. The  
ox can, bya proper harness, be used singly as  
well as the horse, between the rows of Indian  
corn: and equally so used for other purposes.  
Experience may be safely appealed to on this point.  
  
Inthe fourth place, it is alleged that he is slow-  
er in his movements, ‘This is true; but in a less  
degree than is often taken for granted. Oxen  
that are well chosen for their forin, are not work-  
ed afterthe age of about eight years, (the age at  
which they are best fitted for beef,) are not work-  
ed too many together, and are suitably matched,  
may be kept to nearly as quick a step as the horse.  
May I not say, a step quicker than that of many  
horses we see at work, who, on account of their  
age orthe leanness occasioned by the costliness  
of the food they require, lose the advantage where  
they might have once had it!  
  
The last objection has most weight. The ox  
is notso well adapted asthe horse to the road  
service, especially for long trips. In common  
roads, which are often soft, and sometimes sud-  
denly become so, the form of his foot and the  
shortness of his leg,are disadvantages ; and on  
roads frozen or turnpiked, the roughness of the  
surface in the former case, and its harshness in  
both cases, are inconvenient to his cloven hoof.  
But where the distance to market is not great,  
where the varying state of the roads and of the  
weather, can be consulted; and where the road  
service is in less proportion tothe farm service,  
the objection is almost deprived of its weight. In  
cases where it most applies, its weight is dimin-  
ished by the consideration, thata much greater  
proportion of service on the farm may be done by  
oxen, than isnow commonly done ; and that the  
expense of shoeing them, is little different from  
that of keeping horses shod, It is observable,  
that when oxen are worked on a farm, over rough  
frozen ground, they suffer so much from the want  
ofshoes, however well fed they may be, that it is  
a proper subject for calculation, whether true econ-  
omy does not require for them that acommoda-  
tion, even on the farm, as well as fur the horse.  
  
A more important calculation is—whether in  
many Situations, the general saving by substitu-  
ting the ox for the horse would not balance the  
expense of hiring the carriage of the produce to  
market. Inthe same scale with the hire, is to be  
put the value ofthe grass and hay consumed by  
the oxen ; and in the other scale, the value of the  
  
the grass and hay consumed by the horses, Where  
the market is not distant, the value of the corn  
would certainly pay for the carriage of the market  
portion ofthe crop, and balanee moreover, any  
difference between the value of the grass and  
hay consumed by oxen, and the value of the oxen  
when slaughtered for beef. In all these calcula-  
tions, it is doubtless proper not to lose sight of the  
  
doing what they can do for themselves. But the  
rule has its exceptions: and the error, if it be  
committed, will lienot in departing from the rule,  
but in not selecting aright the cases which call for  
the departure. It may be remarked, that the  
rule ought to be more or less general, as there ma

rule, that farmers ought to avoid paying others for |  
  
be, or may not beat hand, a market by whicli  
every produce of labor is convertible into money.  
In the old countries, thisis much more the case  
than in new; and in new, much more the case  
near towns, than ata distance from them, In  
this as in most other parts of cur country, a change  
of circumstances is taking place, which renders  
everything raised on a farmf more convertible into  
money than formerly ; and as the change pro-  
ceeds, it will be more and more a point for con-  
sideration, how far the labor in doing what might  
be bought, could earn more in another way, than  
the amount of the purchase. Still it will always  
be prudent, for reasons which every experienced  
furmer wil understand, “to lean to the side of doing  
rather than hiring or buying what may be wanted.  
  
The mule seems to be in point of economy, be-  
tween the ox and the horse, preferable to the, latter,  
and inferior to the fprmer ; but so well adapted to  
particular services, that he may find a proper  
place on many farms, He is liable to the objec-  
tion which weighs most against theox. Heis  
less fitted than the horse for road service.

Dunk ol them ; and thirst in more.  
  
From lhe Ntir Fvgldnd Farmer.  
ON THE HOUSE AN|&gt;  
BY !»ltE*ll&gt;£NT MAPISON.  
I cannot but consider it as an error in our  
husbandry, that oxen are too little used m  
place of horses.  
Every l«ir comparison of the expense of the  
■*n HinmaO, favors a preference of the ox  
li Ihe • nciMivlHnce particular!v recommend  
&quot;&#x27;R hint, is »tiMt he can he supported when at  
w- rk, by grass and bay, while the horse ie­  
h&#x27;htes grain,and much of i&#x27;, and the grain get:  
cih ly given him is IndiHii corn, the crop  
vi’ich requires most labor, and greatly ex  
2 ousts the land.  
trim ibe b^st es’imaie I have bf,en enwhleil  
to form, more than one half of the corn crop is  
consumed by Iiomms, including f tie ungrown  
ones; and not le*s than one ball, by oili-i  
than pi agure hurtc-i. By getting free from  
this consumption, on« half of the labor and  
&lt; f the wear ol the land would he saved, or ra­  
ther more thau one half. For on most farm*,  
°ue half ol Hip ci op oi corn grows on not morn  
than two films, and sometimes a smaller pin*  
)&gt;oition &lt;&gt;l the cultivated Helds ; and the more  
fertile fields would ol course be retained for cul­  
tivation. Every one can figure to himself the  
ease and tonveniency of a revolution, which  
would so much reduco the extent of lux corn­  
fields : and subs bate (or the labor b» si .wed on  
tliHfn. ihe more easy ta?k of providing pus.urage  
and hay.  
Bui will not the ox himself, when kept at  
I&#x27;tbur, requite gin in loud ax well i*s the horse?  
Certainly much le.&#x27;S, it any. Judging from mv  
&#x27;.&quot;nobseivHtn.il I should say, ibai a plenty  
o! good grass or good hay, will suffice witu­  
out grain, where lie labor is nether cou­  
x&#x27;Kit iioi gt-vere. But I feel entire confidence  
• &quot; saying, it.at a double set ol oxen, alternately  
«t woik, and therefore half the tune at rest,  
might be kept in good plight without other  
loud &#x27;b»n a plenty ol good grass nr good bay  
And as this double set would double ihe supply  
,r&#x27;* heel, ial ow and leather, a set cif is found  
that consideration foi adnblu con umplion  
td that kind ol food.  
ibe objection* generally made to the ox, are,  
v»8 : 1. That be is less tractable th in the  
hotie. 2 l bat ue does not beat beat as well,  
t i hat lie dors not answer fur the single  
I tough used in our cornfields. 4 Thai he is  
•duller in ht» mov. incuts. 6. That he is less  
In for carrying the produce of the larin to mar­  
ket.  
  
ihe tirst objection is certainly founded in  
mistake. Of the two annuals, the os is the  
tnoat docile. In alt countries where the 01 is  
•be ordinary draught annual bis docility is pro*  
▼erbittl. ths intractability, where 11 exists, tins  
arisen front an ncca*onal use ol him only , wii ii  
l“iiK and irregular intervals ; during which,the  
habit ol Uiscipliuo being brukeu, a new one is  
to he formed.  
I be second objection has but as little foun*  
hi ion. the constitution of the os, accomino­  
■‘les usell, as readtly as that ol the horse, to  
diUerent climates.—Mot only in ancient Ciieece

OX THE HORSE AXD OX.  
BY PRESIDENT MADISON.  
I cannot but consider it as an error in our husban  
dry, that oxen are too little used in place of horses.  
Every fair comparison of the expense of the tw  
animals, favors a preference of the ox. Butj.the cir­  
cumstance particularly recommending him, is that he  
can be supported when at work, by grass and hay ;  
while the horse requires jgrain, and much of it, and  
the grain generally given him is Indian corn, the  
crop which requires most labor, and greatly exhausts  
the land.  
From the best estimate I have been enabled to  
form, morp than one half nf thp enrn crnn iu r-nnanmpd  
by horses, including the ungrown ones; and not less  
than one half, by other than pleasure horses. By  
getting lree lrom this consumption, one half of the la  
bor. and of the wear of the land would be saved, or  
i .L JT i ir t-- . r  
rauiei muie man une nan. r or on most iarms, one  
U1 l&quot;e CIJ 01 com Srows ?n no more Tan &quot;vo-  
&quot;&quot;-&quot;i u&quot;u omuu lujjunwu ui &quot;ic  
tivated fields, arlA the more fertile fields would of  
course be retained for cultivation. Everyone can  
figure to himself the ease and conveniency of a revo­  
lution, which would so much reduce the extent of his  
cornfields; and substitute for the labor bestowed on  
them, the more easy task of providing pasturage and  
hay. .  
But will not the ox himself, when kept at labor, re­  
quire grain food as well as the horse? Certainly  
much less, if any. Judging from my own observa­  
tion I should say, that a plenty of good grass or good  
hay, will suffice without grain, where the labor is  
neither constant nor severe. But I feel entire confi­  
dence in saying, that a double set of oxen alternately at  
work, and therefore half the time at rest, might be  
kept in ood. plight without other food than a plenty  
of good grass or good hay. And as this double set  
would double the supply ofl beef, tallow and leather,  
a set oft&#x27; is found in that consideration for a double  
consumption of that kind of food.  
The objections generally made to the ox, are viz:  
1. That he is lees tractable than the horse. 2. That  
he does not bear heat as well. 3. That he does not  
answer for the single plough used in our cornfields.  
4. That he is slower in his movements. 5. That he

is less nt lor carrvinar the nrodnrp. of thp farm r  
The first objection is certainly founded in mistake.  
Of the two animals, the ox is the most docile. In all  
countries where the ox is the ordinary draught ani­  
mal, his docility is proverbial. His intractability,  
where it exists, has arisen from an occasional use of  
him only withdong and iregular intervals; during  
which, the habit of &#x27;discipline being Jprokert, a new one  
is to be formed.  
The second objection has but as little foundation.  
The constitution of the ox accommodates itself, as  
readily as that of the horse, to different climates.  
Not only in ancient Greece and Italy, but throughout.  
j Asia, as presented to us in ancient history, the ox  
and the plough, are associated. At this day, in the  
warm parts of India and China, the ox, not the horse,  
is in the draught service. In every part of India, the  
ox always appeared, even in the train of her ar  
mies. And in the hottest parts of the West. TndiftH  
the ox is employed in hauling the weighty produce to  
me sea-ports, i ne mistake here, as in the former  
case, has arisen from the effects of occasional employ­  
ment only, with no other than green food. The fer­  
mentation of this in thenimal heated by the wea­  
ther,, and fretted by discipline, will readily account  
tor his sinking under his exertion ; when green food  
even, much less dry, with a sober habit of labor,  
would have no such tendency.  
x ne inira oDjection also, is not a solid one. The  
ox can, dy a proper harness, be used singly as well  
&quot;ujbcj ueiween tne rows ol Indian corn: and  
equally so used for other purposes. Experience may  
be safely appealed to on this point.  
xii us lounn place, it is alleged that he is slower  
in his movements. This iR tnw. Knt in c ia

&#x27;;a&quot;) u&quot; a.vVAuuL oi tneir age or me leanness occa­  
sioned by the costliness of the food they require, lose  
the advantage where they might have once had it !  
The last objection has most weight. The ox is not  
so well adapted as the horse to the road service, espe­  
cially for long trips. In common roads, which are  
otten soft, and sometimes suddenly become so, the  
form of his foot and the shortness of his leg, are dis­  
advantages; and on roads frozen or turnpiked, the  
roughness of the surface in the formp.r  
harshness in both cases are inconvenient to his clo­  
ven huof. But where the distance to market is nnt  
great, where the varying state of the roads and of  
tae weather, can be consulted ; and where the road  
nrTice is m less proportion to the larm service, the  
omscpon is almost deprived of its weight. In cases  
where it most applies, its  
TOasideration, that a much greater proportion of ser-

“That there is a disinclination in human nature to exchange  
the savage for the civilized life, cannot be questioned. We  
need not look for proofs beyond our own neighborhood. The  
Indian tribes have ever shown an aversion to the change,  
Neither the persuasive examples of plenty and comfort derived  
from the culture of the earth by their white brethren, nor the  
lessons and specimens of tillage placed in the midst of them,  
  
  
  
and seconded by actual sufferings from a deficient and precari-  
ous subsistence, have diverted them from their stiong propen-  
sities and babitual pursuits. In the same spirit, they always  
betray an anxious disposition to return to their pristine life, af-  
ter being weaned from it by time, and apparently moulded by  
intelectual and moral instruction, into the habits and tastes of  
an agricultural people. A still more conclusive evidence of the  
bias of human nature is seen in the familiar fact, that our own  
people, nursed and reared in these habits and tastes, easily  
slide into those of the savage, and are rarely reclaimed to civil-  
ized society with their own consent.  
  
**Had the Europeans, on their arrival, found this continent  
destitute of human inhabitants, whose dangerous neighborhood  
kept them in acompact and agricultural state, and had their  
communication with the countries they left been discontinued,  
they might have spread themselves into the forests where game  
and fruits would have abounded; and gradually forgetting the  
arts no longer necessary to their immediate wants, have de-  
generated into savage tribes.  
  
‘An admired historian, * in his inquiry into the origin of the  
American savages, represents any such degeneracy as impossi-  
ble. He lays it down as a Certain principle, that the necessary  
arts of life, when once introduced among a people, ean never  
be lost; that the dominion over inferior animals onee enjoyed  
will never be abandoned; and that America, consequently,  
must have been peopled from a country as uncivilized as itself,  
Yet he derives the American savages generally from the Tar-  
tars, whose example must have taught them the use of certain  
animals, for which a substitute might have been found in the  
Bison or Buffalo at least (the same animal with the cow) if not  
in the Elk, the Moose, or the Caraboo, And he regards the  
Esquimaux, a tribe distinguished in several respects for their  
rude condition, as descendants from the Greenlanders, of the  
same modes of life with themselves, who were a colony from  
Norway, plauted in the 9th century; an epoch prior to which  
the Norwegians had made such progress in the arts as to be ca-  
pable of formidable maritime expeditions. The Greenland co-  
lony, therefore, must have undergone a degeneracy from the  
condition ofits country. Without supposing the possibility of  
a transition from a better state of society to a savage state, how  
would the learned historian have accounted for the introduc-  
tion of the savage state at all?’?

the ungrown ones; and not less than one  
half by other than pleasure horses. By get-  
ting free from this consumption, one half the  
labor, and of the wear of the land, would be  
saved, or rather more than one half: for on  
most farms one half the corn crop grows on  
not more than two fifths, and sometimes a  
smaller proportion, of the cultivated fields;  
and the more fertile fields would of course be  
retained for cultivation. Every one can fig-  
ure to himself, the ease and conveniency of a  
revolution which would so much reduce the  
extent of his corn fields; and substitute for  
the labor bestowed on them, the more easy  
task of providing pasturage and hay. But  
will not the ox himself when at work require  
grain food as well as the horse! Certainly  
much less, if any. Judging from my own  
observation, I should say, that a plenty ot  
good grass, or good hay, will suffice without  
grain, where the labor is neither constant nor  
severe. But I feel entire confidence in say-  
ing, that a double set of oxen alternately at  
work, and therefore half the time at rest,  
might be kept in good plight without other  
food than a plenty of good grass, or good hay.  
  
“And as this double set would double the  
supply of beef, tallow and leather, a set-off  
is found in that consideration fora double  
consumption of that kind of food. The ob-  
jections generally made to the ox are, 1.  
[hat he 1s less tractable than the horse. 2.  
That he dose not bear heat as well. 3. That  
he dose not answer for the single plough  
used in our corn fields. 4. That he is slower  
in his movements. 5. That he is less fit for  
carrying the produce of the farm to market.  
  
“The first objection is certainly founded  
in mistake. Of the two animals, the ox is  
the more docile. In all countries where the  
ox is the ordinary draught animal, his doci-  
lity is proverbial. His intractability, where  
it exists has arisen from an occasional use of  
him only with long and irregular intervals;  
during which the habit of Tetigtnns being  
broken, a new one is to be formed. The 2nd  
objection has as little foundation. The con-  
stitution of the ox accommodates itself, as  
readily as that of the horse to different cli-  
mates. Not only in ancient Greece and Italy,  
but throughout Asia, as presented to us in  
  
Vou. l,  
mal, heated by the weather, and frette,  
the discipline, will readily account for }  
sinking under his exertions; when me  
  
iood even, much less dry, with a sober babi  
of labor, would have no such tendency, &#x27;)),,  
  
third objection also is nota solid one. &#x27;T),  
  
ox can, by a proper harness, be used sing},  
  
as well as the horse, between the rows  
  
Indian corn; and equally so used for othe  
  
purposes. Experience may safely be q;,  
  
pealed to on this point. In the 4th place,  
  
is alleged that he is slow in his movement:  
  
‘his is true, but in a less degree than js of  
  
ten taken for granted. Oxen that are wel]  
chosen for their form, are not worked afi,  
the age of about 8 years, (the age at whic)  
  
they are best fitted for beef,) not worked to  
many together, and are suitably matched,  
may be kept to nearly as quick a step as the  
horse. May TI not say a step quicker thay  
that of many of the horses we see at work,  
who, on account of their age, or the leanness  
occasioned by the costliness of the food they  
require, loose this advantage, where they  
might have once had it! The last objection  
has most weight. ‘The ox is not as well  
adapted as the horse for the road service, es-  
pecially for long trips. In common roads,  
which are often soft, and sometimes sud-  
denly become so, the form of his foot, and  
the shortness of his leg, are disadvantages;  
and on roads frozen, or turnpiked, the rough-  
ness of the surface in the former case, and its  
hardness in both cases, are inconvenient to  
his cloven hoof. But where the distance to  
market is not great, where the varying state  
of the roads and the weather can be con-  
sulted ; and where the road service is in less  
proportion to the farm service, the objection  
is almost deprived of its weight. In cases  
where it most applies, its weight is dimin-  
ished by the consideration, that a much  
greater proportion of service on the farm  
may be done by oxen, than is now com-  
monly done; and that the expense of shoeing  
them, is little different from that of keeping  
horses shod.”  
  
Oxen are very extensively used in some  
parts of Great Britain—the farmers of that  
country having found a great advantage re

It having pleased the Society to name me for  
their presiding member, I feel it a duty, on my  
first Appearing among you, to repeat my acknow-  
ledgements, {dr that honorary distinction; with  
the assurances of my sincere desire to promote  
the success of an establishment, which has in  
view so valuable an object as that of improving  
the agriculture of our country.  
  
The faculty of cultivating the earth, and of rear-  
ing animals, by which food is increased beyond  
the spontaneous supplies of nature, belongs to  
man alone, No other terrestrial being has re-  
ceived a higher gift than an instinet, like that of  
the beaver or the ant, which merely hoards for  
future use the food spontaneously furnished by  
nature.  
  
As this peculiar faculty gives to man a pre-emi- |  
  
nence over irrational animals, so it is the use  
made of it by some, and the neglect of it by other  
communities, that distinguish them from each oth-  
er, inthe most important features of the human  
character.  
  
The contrast between the enlizhtened and re-  
fined nations on some parts of the earth, and the  
rude and wretched tribes on others, has its foun-  
dation in this distinction. Civilization is never  
seen without agriculture nor has agriculture ever  
prevailed, where the civilized arts did not make  
their appearance.  
  
But closely as agriculture and civilization are al-  
lied, they do not keep pace with each other.  
There is probably a much higher state of agri-  
culture in China and Japan, than in many other  
countries far more advanced in the improvements  
of civilized life. It is surely no small reproach to  
the latter, that with so great a superiority in sci-  
ence, and in the fuller possession of the auxiliary  
arts, they should suffer themselves to be outstrip-  
ped in the very art by which both are essentially  
distinguished from the brute creation.  
  
It must not be inferred, however, from the capa-  
cities and the motives of man for an artificial in-  
crease of the productions of the earth, that the  
transition from the hunter, ar even the herdsman  
state, to the agricultural, is a matter of course.  
  
The first steps in this transition are attended | Savage state at all?

tion.  
  
theugh one, perhaps not requiring more effort  
  
And that there is a disinclination in human na-  
ture to exchange the savage for the civilized life  
cannot be questioned. We need not look for  
| proofs beyond our own neighborhood. The Jp-  
dian tribes have ever shown an aversion to the  
change. Neither the persuasive examples of&#x27;plen-  
ty and comfort derived from the culture of the earth  
| by their white brethren, nor the lessons and spe-  
cimens of tillage placed in the midst of them, and  
seconded by actual sufferings frony a deficient and  
precarious subsistence, have diverted them from  
their strong propensities and habitual pursuits, Ip  
the same spirit, they always betray an anxious dis-  
position to return to their pristine life, alier being  
weaned from it by time, and apparently moulded  
by intellectual and moral instruction, iuto the ha-  
bits and tastes of an agricultural people. A still  
more conclusive evidence of the bias of human  
nature, is seen in the familiar fact, that our own  
people nursed and reared in these habits and  
tastes, easily slide into those of the savage, and  
are rarely reclaimed to civilized society with their  
own consent.  
  
Had the Europeans, on their arrival, found this  
continent destitute of human inhabitants, whose  
dangerous neighborhood kept them ina compact  
and agricultural state, and had their communica-  
tion with the countries they left, been discontinu-  
ed, they might have spread themselves into the  
forests where game and fruits would have abound-  
(ed; and gradualiy forgetting the arts no longer  
necssary to their immediate wants, have degene-  
rated into savage tribes.  
  
An admired historian,* in his inquiry into the  
| origin of the American savages, represents any  
such degeneracy as impossible. He lays it down  
}as acertain principle, that the necessary arts ol  
| life, when once introduced among a people, can  
  
never be lost, that the dominion over inferior ani-  
| mals once enjoyed will never be abandoned; and  
that America, consequently, must have been peo-  
  
pled from a country as uncivilized as itself. Yet  
| he derives the American savages, generally, from  
  
the Tartars, whose example must have taught  
‘them the use of’ certain animals, for which a sub-  
stitute might have been found in the bison of  
buffalo at least, (the same animal with the cow,)  
if not in the elk, the moese, or the caraboo.  
And he regards the Esquimaux, a tribe distin-  
guished in several respects for their rude condi-  
tion, as descendants from the Greenlanders,  
the same modes of life with themselves who  
were a colony from Norway, planted in the 9th  
century; an epoch prior to which the Nowegians  
had made such progress in the arts as to be capa  
ble of formidable maritime expeditions. The  
Greenland colony, therefore, must have. under-  
gone a degeneracy from the condition of Its pe  
rent country. Without supposing the possibility  
of a transition from a better state of human soc  
ety, to a savage state, how would the learned =  
torian have accounted for the introduction of te

state in the mountains of Chili, nor can it be be-  
  
lieved, that previous to its adoption by man, it |  
ever existed in the extent to which cultivation is |

These views of the subject seem to authorize  
the conelusion, that although there is a propor-  
tion between the animal and vegetable classes of  
beings on our globe, and between the species in  
each class, with respect to which, nature does not  
permitsuch a change as would result froma destruc-  
tion of the animals and vegetables not used by  
man; and a multiplication of the haman race,  
and of the several species of animals and vegeta-  
bles used by it, suflicient to fill up the void; yet  
that there is a degree of change which the pecu-  
  
. . . . ° j  
liar faculties of man enable him to make, and by |  
making which, his fund of subsistence and his |  
numbers may be augmented; there being at the |  
  
same time, whenever his numbers, and the change  
exceed the admitted degree, a tendency in that  
excess to correct itself.  
  
Could it, however, be supposed that the estab-  
lished system, and symmetry of nature, required  
  
the number of human beings on the globe to be |  
  
always the same; that the only change permitted  
  
in relation to them, was in their distribution over |  
  
it; still, as the blessing of existence to that num-  
  
ber would materially depend on the parts of the |

1. The error first to be noticed is that of’ ewlti-  
rating land, either naturally poor or impoverished  
by cultivation. This error, like many others, is  
the effect of habit, continued alter the reason for it

fresh and fertile soil, it was the interest of the cul-  
tivator to spread his labor over as great a surfive  
as he could. Land being cheap and labor dear  
and the land co-operating powertully with the |a-  
bor, it was profitable to draw as much as possible  
from the land. Labor is now comparatively cheap-  
‘er and land dearer. Where labor has risen in  
price four-fold, land has risen ten-fold. [t might  
be profitable, thereiore, now to contract the sur-  
face over which Jabor is spread even if the soil  
retained its freshness and fertility. But this is not  
the case. Much of the fertile soil is exhausted,  
and unfertile soils are brought into cultivation;  
  
| and both co-perating less with labor in producing  
  
the crop, it is necessary to consider how fir labor  
  
can be profitably exerted on them; whether it

what is right as to the farm generally, is so as to  
every part of every farm. Any system, therefore,

there is any, will not balance the loss of intrinsic

If. The evil of pressing too hard on the land  
has also been much increased by the bad mode of  
ploughing it. Shallow ploughing, and ploughing  
up and down hilly land have, by exposing the  
joosened soil to be carried off by rains, hastened  
more than any thing else, the waste of its fertili-  
ty. When the mere suface is pulverized, mode-  
rate rains on land but little uneven, if ploughed  
up and down, gradually wear it away .And hea-  
vy rains on hilly land ploughed in that manner,  
soon produce a like effect, notwithstanding the im-  
proved practice of deeper ploughing. How have  
the beauty and value of this ridge of country suf-  
fered from this, cause? And how much is due to  
the happy improvement introduced by a member  
of this society, whom [ need not naine,* by a cul-  
tivation in horizontal drills, with a plough adapted  
to it?’ Had the practice prevailed from the first  
settlement of the country, the general fertility  
would have been more than the double of what  
the red hills, and indeed all other hilly lands now  
possess; and the scars and sores now defacing  
them would no where be seen. Happily, experi-  
ence is proving that this remedy aided by a more  
rational management in other respects, is adequate  
to tie purpose of healing what has been wound-  
ed, as well as of preserving the health of what  
has escaped the calamity. It is truly gratifying

| The failure of new land has long called for the im-  
provement of old land; but habit has kept us deat  
to the call.  
  
Nothing is more certain than that continual  
cropping without manure deprives the soil of i®  
fertility. {ft is equally certain, that fertiliiy ma  
be preserved or restored, by giving to the enith  
animal or vegetable manure equivalent to the mat-  
ter taken from it; and that a perpetual fertility is  
not, in itself} incompatible, with an uninterrupted  
succession of crops. The Chinese, it is said,  
smile at the idea that land needs rest, as if like  
animals, it had a sense of fatigue. Their soil  
does not need rest, because an industrious use is  
made of every fertilizing particle, that can contri-  
bute towards replacing what has been drawn trom  
it. And this is the more practicable with them, as  
almost the whole of what is grown.on the farms  
is consumed within them. That a restoration to  
the earth of all that annually grows on it, prevents  
its impoverishment, is sufficiently seen in our for-  
ests; where the annual exuve of the trees and  
plants, replace the fertility of which they deprive  
the earth. Where frequent fires destroy the  
leaves and whatever else is annually dropped on  
the earth, it is well known that the land becomes  
poorer; this destruction of the natural crop having  
the same impoverishing effect as the removal of  
acultivatedcrop. A still stronger proof that an  
annual restoration to the earth of all its annual  
product will perpetuate its productiveness is seen  
where our fields are leit uncultivated and un-  
pastured. In this case, the suil receiving from  
the decay of the spontaneous weeds and grasses,  
more fertility than they extract from it, is lor a  
time at least, improved, not impoverished. — lis  
improvement may be explained, by the fertilizing  
matter. which the weeds and grasses derive from

ae  
  
garden mould was diminished in its weight by a  
plant-which grew init. And the latest chemical  
examination of the subject coincide with the genera!  
opinion of practical husbandmen that the substance  
of plants, partakes of the substance of the soil.  
The idea is, indeed, very natural that vegeta-  
matter which springs from the earth, and of itself  
  
returns to the earth, should be one source at least |  
  
of the earth’s capacity to re-produce vegetable  
matter.  
  
It has been asked how it happens that Egypt  
and Sicily, which have for ages been exporting  
their agricultural produce without a return of any  
equivalent produce, have not lost their re-produc-  
tive capacity. One answer has been, that they  
have-lost no small. degree of it. If the fact be  
otherwise with regard to Egypt, it might be ac-  
counted for. by the fertilizing inundations of the  
Nile. With regard to Sicily, there may be some-  
thingin the system of husbandry, or some parti-  
cular local cireumstances, which countervail the  
  
eontinuéd asportation of the fruits of the soil. But |  
  
it is far more probable, that the island is less pro-  
ductive than it once was. | It is certainly less of a  
  
granery for other counties now, than it was when |  
  
it received that title from the ancient Romans.  
And its population being diminished, the internal  
consumption must also be diminished. Ifa single  
farm is rendered less productive by a continued re-  
moval of its crops without any adequate returns,  
no reason occurs why it should not happen toa  
number of farms multiplied to the extent of a  
whole country.  
  
And that individual farms do lose their fertility  
in proportion as crops are taken from them, and  
returns of manure neglected, is a fact not likely to  
be questioned.  
  
If it were, Virginia, unfortunately, is but too  
capable of furnishingthe proofs. Her prevailing  
crops have been very exhausting, and the use ol  
manures has been particularly neglected.  
  
‘Tobacco and Indian corn, which, for a long time  
on the east side of the Blue Mountains were the  
articles almost exclusively cultivated, and which  
continue to be cultivated, the former extensively, the  
latter universally, are known to be great impover-  
ishers of the soil. Wheat, which has for anumber  
of years, formed a large portionof the general crop,  
is also an exhausting crop. So are rye and oats,  
which enter occasionally into our farm system.  
  
With so many consumers of&#x27; the fertility of the  
earth, and so little attention to the means of re-  
pairing their ravages, no one can be surprised at  
the impoverished face of the country; whilst every  
one ought to be desirous of aiding in the work of  
reformation.  
  
The first and main step towards it, is, to make  
the thieves restore as much as possible of the sto-  
Jen fertility. On this, with other improvements  
which may be made in our husbandry, we must  
depend for the rescue of our farins from their pres-  
est degraded condition.

due is an item on the list of manures: and jt is  
known to be in its quality a very rich one. The  
crop of tobacco, however though of great valye  
  
’  
  
covers but a small proportion of our cultivated  
it  
  
ag  
» than any  
  
been more carefully used as a manure  
other article furnished by our crops.  
  
The article whicn constitutes our principal ma-  
nure is wheat straw. Itis of much importance.  
therefore to decide aright on the mode of using  
it. ‘There are three modes: 1. Carrying it from  
the farm yard, after having passed through or be-  
ing trodden and enriched by cattle. In that mode,  
the greater part of it must be used, if used at all:  
the straw going through that process, being a ne-  
cessary part of the food allotted to the eattle.  
&#x27;Toderive the full advantage from it, it ought to be  
hauled out before the substance has been wasted by  
rain, by the sun, and by wind; and to be buried in  
the earth as soon after as possible. 2. Spreading the  
straw on the surface of the ground. Many tes-  
pectable farmers are attached to this mode, as pro-  
\tecting the soil from the sun: and by keeping it  
most, favoring the vegetation underneath, whe-  
ther spontaneous or artificial; whilst the straw  
itself is gradually decomposed into a manure,  
|The objection to this mode is the loss by evapora-  
‘tion, before this last effect is obtained. 3. Turn-  
‘ing the straw at once under the surface of the  
earth. This would seem to be the best mode ol  
| managing manures generally; ieast of their sub-  
|stance being then lost. Wheu the grain is trod-  
‘den out from the straw, it is left in a state easily  
‘admitting this operation. Some difficulty may  
‘attend it, when the grain is thrashed from the  
straw by the flail, or by the machines now in  
use, neither of which break the straw sullicieutly  
| to pieces. &#x27;  
  
t may be remarked with regard to this article  
of manure—1l. That its weight is barely more  
than that of the grain. 2. That the grain is the  
part which makes the greatest draft on. the fertili-  
ty of theearth. 3. hat the grain is for the most  
part not consumed within the farm. It is foune  
on trial that a stalk of wheat, as generally cut, in-  
cluding the chaff, and the grains borne by the  
stalk, are pretty nearly of equal weight. The  
/case is probably the same with rye, and not vely  
‘different with oats. The proportion of fertilizing  
‘matter in the straw, to that in the grain, has nol,  
jas far as I know, been brought to any satislacto-  
iry test. It is doubtless much less in the straw,  
which alone in the case of wheat, is with us re-  
turnable in any form to the earth. ‘This consider@-  
tion, whilst it urges us to make the most of the  
‘article as a manure, warns us of its insufficiency:  
  
The stubble and the roots of the small grains,  
not being taken from the earth, may be regande,  
‘as relapsing into a fertility equal to that of whi  
‘they deprived the earth. ‘This remark is apple  
ble to all cultivated plants, the roots of which are  
not an esculent part.  
  
An eminent citizen and  
rist* of this state, has among other instru  
lesons, called the public attention to the ¥ a  
of the corn stalk as a manure. Tam persune™

is of double the price in market. It i&amp; 10 be noteq  
  
powers to give proportional augmentation to every  
  
oher part; whether by any one oy more of  
  
these processes, or by some other or others dis-  
tinct from them all, the growth of plants be pro-  
moted by this nuneral, remains, it would seen, to  
be vetexplained. Inthe mean time, a more ex-  
tensive use of it, promises much advantage to our  
agriculture. If take it, however, that this advan-  
tage cannot be permanent without making the in-  
creased product of the soil, a source of manure to  
the soil. ‘That the effect of the plaster will be  
continued indefinitely, under a constant removal  
of the whole crop from the soil, surpasses belief.  
It can scarcely fail to exhaust at Jength, the pro-  
ductive powers of the earth. The period of time ne-  
cessary for the purpose, may be uncertain; but that  
as in the case of other mineral munures, lime and  
marl, such must sooner or later, be the result, can-  
not well be so. The effect of pulverizing the  
earth by tillage, as practised by Tull, is stated to  
have been uninterrupted crops of wheat, without  
manure, for more than twenty years; which was  
regarded as a demonstration, that tillage was a  
complete substitute for manure. Stipposing the  
statement to be free from error, the inference is  
certainly not warranted by the fact. We know  
that some of our soils, not naturally richer than  
the hilly manured soils on which Tull probably  
  
commenced his tillage, will bear a succession of  
  
crops for an equal period; and we know as well,  
that their fertility will not hold out forever. How  
long plaster, whatever be its mode of operation,  
wil hold out, may not yet have been filly tried.  
But to make it permanently successful, it will be  
wise to take for granted, that it must be madea  
source of future manure, as weli as of immediate  
productiveness. Ifthe crop, as anemented by  
the plaster, be given back tothe soil, the soil may  
be benefitied more than it would be by the return  
of a crop net augmented by the plaster. And in  
this way, fertility may be accelerated. The res-  
toration of a erop, increased by ordinary cultiva-  
tion, tothe soil on which it grew, would, I pre-  
sume, fertilize it more than the restoration of a  
emailer crop spontaneously produced; although  
in both cases, the whole taken from the soil would  
return to it.  
  
1V. Among the meane of aiding the produc-  
tiveness of the soil, which have not received merit-  
ed attention, is irrigation. 4n scarcely any coun-  
try does this resource abound more than in the  
United States; nor is there any, where there is so  
little sensibility to its value. The inconsiderable  
use made of it, is chiefly by emigrants, particu-  
  
larly Germans, or the immediate descendants of  
  
them. IT have understood that the market of Bal-  
timore, has been much benefitted in dry seasons,  
by the irrigation introduced by exiles from St.  
Domingo. Fora distinguished proef of the im-  
portance of the practice, | may refer to the fact  
which has been stated in the neighborhood of Bar-  
celona in Spain, where a part of the land is under  
irregation, and a part ie not susceptible of it, both  
being otherwise of equal fertility, the part irrigated  
  
thirsty soil, and warm climate. Our particular  
district of country, abounding in springs, small  
streams, and suitable declivities, admits greatly of  
irrigation; and being generally of a thirsty nature,  
the more strongly invites the use of it.  
  
V. I cannot but consider it as an error in our  
husbandry, that oxen are too little used in place of  
horses.  
  
Every fair comparison of the expense of the  
two animals, favors a preference of the ox. But.  
the circumstance particularly recommending him  
is, that he can be supported when at work, by  
grass and hay, whilst the horse requires grain  
and much of it; and the grain generally given  
him, is Indian corn, the crop which requires most  
labor and greatly exhausts the land.  
  
From the best estimate I have been enabled to  
form, more than one-half of the corn crop is con-  
sumed by horses, including the ungrown ones;  
and not jess than one half, by other than pleasure  
horses. By getting free from this consumption,  
one half the labor and of the wear of the land  
would be saved, or rather more than one half; for  
on most farms, one half of the crop of corn grows  
on not more than two-fifths, and sometimes a  
smaller proportion of the cultivated fields; and the  
more fertile fields would of course be retained for  
cultivation. Every one can figure to himself the  
ease and conveniency of a revolution which would  
so much reduce the extent of his corn fields; and  
substitute for the labor bestowed on them, the  
more easy task of providing pasturage and hay.  
  
But will not the ox himself when kept at labor,  
require grain food as well as the horse? Cer-  
tainly much less, if any. Judging from my own  
observation, 1 should say, that a plenty of good  
grass or good hay will suffice without grain where  
the labor is neither constant nor severe. But |  
feel entire confidence in saying that a double set  
of oxen alternately at work, and therefore half the  
time at rest, might be kept in good plight without  
other food than a plenty of good grass or good  
hay. And as this double set would double the  
supply of beef, tallow and leather, a set off is  
found in that consideration for a double consump  
tion of that kind of food. .  
  
The objections generally made to the ox are—  
1. That he is less tractable than the horse. 2  
‘That he does not bear heat as well. 3. That he  
does not answer for the single plough used in our  
corn fields. 4. That he is slower in his move-  
ments. 5. That he is less fit for carrying the pr  
duce of the farm to market. to  
  
The first objection is certainly founded in m&#x27;*  
take. Of the two animals, the ox is the more do-  
cile. In all countries where the ox is the ordinary  
draught animal, his docility is proverbial. His&quot;  
tractability where it exists, has arisen from an =  
casional use of him only, with long and irregy  
intervals; during which, the habit of discipline Pf  
ing broken, a new one is to be formed.  
  
The second objection has as little foundation.  
The constitution of the ox accommodates itselt ,  
readi!y as that of the horse, to different climates.

and fatten them now, as formerly. The size and  
  
appearance of our neat cattle, compared with those  
for which nature or good husbandry has provided’  
sufficient food, are proofs that their food js,not in  
proportion to their number; and that where.the  
  
food cannot be increased, the number ought to be  
reduced.  
  
Vil. Of all the errors in our rural economy,  
none is perhaps so much to be regretted, because  
none is so difficult to be repaird, as the injudicious  
and excessive destruction of timber and fire wood.  
It seems never to have occurred thatthe fund  
was not inexhaustible, and that a crop of trees  
could not be raised as quickly as one of wheat or  
corn.  
  
Here again, we are presented with a proof of  
the continuance of the practice for which the rea-  
sons have ceased. When our ancestors arrived,  
they found the trees of the forest the great obsti-  
cle to their settlement, and cultivation. The  
great effort was of course to destroy the trees. It  
would seem that they contracted and transmitted  
an antipathy to them; for the trees were not even  
spared around the dwellings, where their shade  
would have been a comfort and their beauty an  
ornament; and it is of late years only, that these  
advantages have been attended to. In fact, such |  
has been the inconsiderate and indiscriminate use  
of the axe, that this country is beginning to feel |  
the calamity as much as some of the old coun-  
tries of Kurope; and it will soon be forced to un-  
derstand the 4ifliculty of curing it. A vast propor-  
tion of the farms on the eastern side of the Blue  
Ridge, and some even, on the otherside, have but  
a scanty fund for present use, and are without a  
fund for permanent use. And to increase the evil,  
the remnant of timber and fuel on many farms, in-  
adequate as it is left in situations remote from the  
dwelling, and incapable of being divided, accord-  
ing to the divisions, and sub-divisions, into which  
all the large farms must be rapidly forced by the  
law of descendants, the impulses of parental af-  
fection, and other causes.  
  
It ishigh time for many farmers, even in this  
quarter, and still more so in the country below us,  
to take this subject into serious consideration.  
Prudence will no longer delay to economize what  
remains of wood land; to foster the second growths  
where taking place in convenient spots; and to  
commence, when necessary, plantations of the  
trees recommended by their utility and quick-  
ness of growth.  
  
{ wish I could more satisfactorily estimate the  
proportion of wood land which ought to belong to |  
every farm, as a permanent find of timber for  
building and repairing houses; for fences, where |  
live or stone ones may not have been introduced; |  
for wheel carriages, and the other apparatus |  
needed on farms. ‘The estimate is the more dif- |  
ficult, because it must be varied according to ma- |  
ny circumstances; particularly aceording to the!  
nature of the soil, and the kind of trees at once}  
suited to it, and tothe uses to be made of them. |

can be enforced on most of our farms.

“TI cannot but consider it as an error in our hus-  
bandry, that oxen are too little used in the,place of  
horses. Every fair comparison of the expense of  
the two animals, favors a preference of the ox. But  
the circumstance particularly recommending him,  
is, that he can be supported when at work, by grass  
and hay; while the horse requires grain, and much  
of it; and the grain generally given him, Indian  
corn, the crop which requires most labor, and great-  
ly exhausts the land. From the best estimate I  
have been enabled to form, more than one half of  
the corn crop is consumed by horses ; including the  
ungrown ones ; and not less than one half by other  
than pleasure horses. By getting free from this  
consumption, one half the labor, and of the wear of  
the land, would be saved, or rather more than one  
half; for on most farms one half of the corn crop  
grows on not more than two fifths, and sometimes a  
smaller proportion, of the cultivated fields; and the  
more fertile fields would of course be retained for  
cultivation. Every one can figure to himself, the  
ease and convenience of a revolution which would  
60 much reduce the extent of his corn fields; and  
substitute for the labor bestowed on them, the more  
easy task of providing pasturage and hay. But  
will not the ox himself when at work require grain  
  
food as well as tle horse ? Certainly much less, if’  
  
any. Judging from my own observation, I should  
say, that a plenty of good grass, or good hay, will  
suffice without grain, where the labor is neither con-  
stant norsevere. But I feel entire confidence in  
  
work, and the  
kept in good plight without other food than a plen-  
ty of good grass, or good hay.  
  
“ And as this double set would double the sup-  
ply of beef, tailew and leather, a set-off is found  
in that consideration for a double consumption of  
that kind of food. The objections generally made  
to the ox are, 1. That he is less tractable than the  
horse. 2. ‘That he does not bear the heat so well.  
3. That he does not answer for the single plough  
use in our corn fields. 4, That he is slower in his  
movements. 5. That he is less fit for carrying the  
produce of the farm to market.  
  
“ The first objection is certainly founded in mis-  
take. Of the two animals, the ox is the more do-  
cile. In al! countries where the ox is the ordinary  
draught animal, his docility is proverbial. His in-  
tractability. wihere it exists has arisen from an oc-  
easional use of him only with long and irregular in-  
tervals; durin which the habit of discipline bein  
broken, a new one is to be formed. The 2d objec

true, but in a Jess degree, than is often taken for |  
granted. Oxen that are well chosen for their form,  
are not worked after the age of about 8 years, (the  
age at which they are best fitted for a are vot

ed, may be kept to nearly as quick a step the

many of the horses we see at work, who, on ac- |  
count of their age, or the leanness occasioned by |  
the costliness of the food they require, lose this  
advantage, where they might have once had it ?&gt;—_  
The last objection has most weight. The ox is.  
not as well adapted as the horse to the road service, |  
especially for long trips. In common roads, which |  
are often soft, and sometimes suddenly become so, |  
the form of his foot, and the shortness of his leg, &#x27;

are disadvantages; and on roads frozen, or turn- |  
: . |  
piked, the roughness of the surface in the former |  
case, and its hardness in both cases, are inconve- |  
nient to his cloven hoof. But where the distance |  
to market is not great, where the varying state of)  
the roads and the weather can be consulted; and |  
where the road service is in less proportion to the_  
farm-service, the objection is almost deprived of its |  
weight. In cases where it most applies, its weight |  
is diminished by the consideration, that a much |  
greater proportion of service on the farm may be |  
done by oxen, than is now commonly done ; and |  
that the expense of shoeing them, is little different |  
from that of keeping horses shod.” |

‘*] cannet but consider it as an error in our husbandry  
that oxen are too little used in the place of horses. Every  
fair comparison of the expense of the two animals, favors  
a preference of the ox. But the circumstance particu-  
larly recommending him, is, that he can be supported  
when at work, by grass and hay; while the the horse  
requires grain and much of it; and the grain generally  
given him, Indian corn, the crop which requires most la-  
bor, and greatly exhausts the land. From the best esti-  
mate I have been enabled to form, more than one half  
of the corn crop is consumed by horses; including the  
ungrown ones; and not less than one half by other than  
pleasure horses. By getting free from this consumption,one  
half the labor, and of the wear of the land would be saved,  
or rather more than one half ;—for on most farms one half  
of the corn crop grows on not more than two-fifths, and  
sometimes a smaller proportion, of the cultivated fields ;  
and the more fertile fields would of course be retained for  
cultivation. Every one can figure to himself, the ease  
and convenience of a revolution which would so much  
reduce the extent of his corn fields; and substitute for  
the labor bestowed on them, the more easy task of pro-  
viding pasturage and hay. But will not the ox himself,  
when at work, require grain food as well as the horse ?  
Certainly much less, if any. Judging from my own ob-  
sesvation, I should say, that a plenty of good grass or  
good hay, will suffice without grain, where the labor is  
neither constant nor severe. But I feel entire confidence  
in saying, that a double sett of oxen alternately at work,  
and therefore half the time at rest, might be kept in good  
plight with no other food than a plenty of good grass, or  
good hay.  
  
“‘ And as this double sett would double the supply of  
beef, tallow and leather, a set-off is found in that consid.  
eration, for a double consumption of that kind of food.  
The objections generally made to the ox are, 1. That he  
  
  
  
U  
  
is less tractable than the horse. 2, That he does not  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
er

bear the heat so well. 3. That he does not answer for  
the single plough used in corn fields. 4. That he is  
slower in his movements. 5. That he is less fit for carry-  
ing the produce of the farm to market.  
  
“The first objection is certainly founded in mistake.  
Of the two animals, the ox is the.more docile. In all  
countries where the ox is the ordinary draught animal, his  
docility is proverbial. His intractability, where it exists,  
has arisen from an occasional use of him, only with long  
and irregular intervals ; during which the habit of disci-  
pline being broken, a new one is to be formed. The sec-  
ond objection has as little foundation. ‘The constitution  
of the ox accommodates itself, as readily as that of the  
horse, to different climates. Not only in ancient Greece  
and Italy, but throughout Asia, as presented to us in an-  
cient history, the ox and the plough are associated. At  
this day, in the warm parts of India and China, the ox,  
not the horse, is in the draught service. In every part of  
India, the ox always appears, even in the train of her  
armies. And in the hottest parts of the West Indies, the  
ox is employed in hauling weighty produce to the sea ports.  
The mistake here, as in the former case, has arisen from  
the effect of an occasional employment only, with no  
other than. green food. The fermentation of this in the  
animal, heated by the weather, and fretted by the disci-  
pline, will readily account for his sinking under his ex-  
ertions ; when green food even, much less dry, with a so-  
ber habit of labor, would have no such tendency. The  
third objection also is not a solid one. The ox can, by  
a proper harness, be used singly as well as the horse, be-  
tween the rows of Indian corn; and equ ally so used for  
other purposes. Experience may safely be appealed to on  
this point. In the fourth place, it is alledged that he  
is slow in his movements. This is true, but often in a less  
degree, than is often taken for granted. Oxen that are  
well chosen for their form, are not worked after the age  
of about 8 years, (the age at which they are best fitted for  
beef,) are not worked too many together, and are suitably  
matched, may be kept in nearly as quick a step as the  
horse. May I not say a step quicker than many of the  
horses we see at work, who, on account of their age, or  
the leanness, occasioned by the costliness of the food  
they require, lose this advantage, where they might have  
once had it?) The last objection has most weight. The  
ox is not as well adapted as the horse to the road service,  
especially for long trips. In common roads, which are  
often soft, and sometimes suddenly become so, the form  
of his foot, and the shortness of his leg, are disadvan.  
tages; and on roads, frozen, or turnpiked, the roughness  
of the surface in the former case, and its hardness in  
both cases, are inconvenient to his cloven hoof. But  
where the distance to market is not great, where the va-  
rving state of the roads and the weather can be consulted ;  
and where the road service is in less proportion to the  
farm service, the objection is almost deprived of its weight.  
In cases where it most applies, its weight is diminished  
by the consideration, that a much greater proportion of  
service on the farm may be done by oxen, than is now  
commonly done ; and that the expense of shoeing them,  
is little different from that of keeping horses shod.”

## [THE CHRONICLE. SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 27, 1841. ANOTHER WORD FOR AGRICULTURE AND CONCENTRATION. "Agriculture is the basis of all other arts, and in all countries is coeval with the first dawn of civilization, without agriculture mankind would be savages, thinly scattered through interminable forests, with no other habitations than huts. It is the most universal, as well as the most ancient of the arts; employs the greatest number of operators and is not only indispensable to national prosperity, but is eminently conducive to the welfare of those who are engaged in it "Conversations Lexikon.     "Countries are not cultivated in proportion to their fertility, but to their liberty; and if we make an imaginary division of the earth, we shall be astonished to see, in most ages, deserts in the most fruitful parts, and great nations in those where nature seems to refuse everything.—Montesquicu, Esprit des Loix](http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/31730995)

“I cannot but consider it as an error in our hus-  
bandry, that oxen are too little used in the place  
of horses. Every fair comparison of the expense»  
of the two animals, favors a preference of the ox.  
But the circumstance particularly recommending  
him, is, that he can be supported when at work, by  
grass and hay; while the horse requires grain,  
and much of it. But will not the ox himself when  
ut work require grain food as well as the horse ?  
Certainly much less, if any. Judging from my  
own observation, [ should say, that a plenty of  
good grass, or good hay, will suffice without grain,  
where the labor is neither constant nor severe.  
But I feel entire confidence in saying, that a double  
set of oxen alternately at work, and therefore half  
the time at rest, might be kept in good plight with-  
out other food than a plenty of good grass or good  
hay. And as this double set would double the  
supply of beef, tallow and leather, a set-off is found  
in that consideration for a double consumption of  
that kind of food.  
  
The objections generally made to the ox, are—  
i. That he is less tractable than the horse, 2.  
That he does not bear heat as well, 3. That he  
does not answer for the single plow used in our  
corn-fields, 4, That he is slower in his move-  
ments. 5, That he is less fit for carrying the  
produce of the farm to market.  
  
The first objection is certainly founded in mis-  
take. Of the two animals, the ox is the more do-  
cile. In all countries where the ox is the ordina-  
ry draught animal, his docility is proverbial. His  
intractability, where it exists, has arisen from an  
occasional use of him only, with long and irregu-  
Jar intervals, during which, the habit of discipline  
being broken, a new one is to be formed.  
  
The second objection has as little foundation.  
The constitution of the ox accommodates itself as  
readily as that of the horse, to different climates.  
Not only in ancient Greece and Italy, but through-  
out Asia, as presented to us in ancient history, the  
ox and the plow are associated At this day, in  
the warm parts of India and China, the ox, not the  
horse, is in the draught service. In every part of  
India the ox always appears, even in the train of  
her armies. And in the hottest parts of the West  
Indies, the ox is employed in hauling weighty pro-  
duce to the sea-ports. The mistake here, as in the  
former case, has arisen from the effect of an occa-  
sional employment only, with no other than green  
food. The fermentation of this in the animal,  
heated by the weather, and fretted by the disci-  
pline, will readily account for his sinking under  
his exertions; when food even, much less dry,  
with a sober habit of labor, would have no ten-  
dency.  
  
The third objection also, is not a solid one.  
The ox, by a proper harness, can be used singly  
as well as the horse, between the rows of Indian  
eorn, and equally so used for other purposes. Ex-  
perience may safely be appealed to on this point.  
  
In the fourth place it is alleged he is slow in  
his movements. This is true, but in a less degree  
than is often taken for granted. Oxen that are  
well chosen for their form, are not worked after  
the age of about eight years, (the age at which  
they are best fitted fur beef,) not worked too many  
  
  
  
— —_  
  
  
  
together, and are suitably matched, may be kept to  
nearly as quick a step as the horse.  
  
The last objection has most weight. The ox is  
not as well adapted as the horse for road service,  
especially for long trips. In common roads, which  
are often soft, and sometimes suddenly become so,  
the form of his foot and the shortness of his leg,  
are disadvantages; and on roads frozen or turn-  
piked, the roughness of the surface in the former  
case, and its hardness in both cases, are inconve-  
nient to his cloven hoof. But where the distance  
to market is not great, where the varying state of  
the yoads and the weather can be consulted, and  
where the road service is in less proportion to the  
farm service, the objection is almost: deprived of  
its weight. In cases where it most applies, its  
weight is diminished by the consideration, that a  
much greater proportion of service on the farm  
may be done by oxen than is commonly done, and  
that the expense of shoeing them is little different  
from that of horses.

II. The. evil of preying too hard on th

* Plaster or Gypsum, though not a manure within  
the farm itself, has been too long neglected as a fer-  
tilizing resource. It is now beginning to take a high  
and just rank as such. The proofs of itsefficacy are  
as incontestible as the causes of it are obscure. The  
experiments of a very distinguished chemist, Sir  
Humphrey Davy, led him to the opinion, that its  
substance enters into the substance of the plant.  
Without doubting the fact, it does not sufficiently ac-  
count for the addition made to the size and weight of  
the plant, which greatly exceed the quantity of the  
plaster It must, therefore, have some further mode  
of operating. Whether it be by neutralizing some nox-

which lime is supposed to operate, or by attracting

touched, as could not but happen with a  
mind so pure and so bright.  
  
The objections generally made to the ox  
are—lst, that he is less tractable than the  
horse; 2nd, that he does not bear heat as  
well; 3rd, that he does not answer for the  
single plough used in our corn-fields; 4th,  
that he is slower in his movements; 5th,  
that he is less fit for carrying the produce of  
the farm to market.  
  
The first objection is certainly founded in  
mistake. Of the two animals the ox is the  
most docile. In all countries where the ox  
is the ordinary dranght animal, his docilit  
is proverbial. His intractability, where it  
exists, has arisen from an oceasiona) use of  
him only, with long and irregular intervals;  
during which, the habit of diseipline being  
broken, a new one is to be formed.  
  
The second objection has as little founda-  
tion. The constitution of the ox saecommo-  
dates itself as readily as that of the horse to  
different climates. Not only in ancient  
Greece and Italy. but throughout Asia, as  
presented to us in ancient history, the ox  
and the plongh are associated. At this day,  
in the warm parts of India and China, the  
ox, not the horse, is in the draught service.

, The objections generally made  
to the 03 are 1st, that he is less  
tractable ihan the borse; 2nd, that  
he does not bear heal as well; 3rd,  
that he doc not answer for the slu­  
g!e plough used in our corn-fields;  
4th, that he is flower in bis move­  
ments; 5th, that he is less fit lor  
carrying the produce of the farm to  
market.  
The first objection i certainly  
founded in mistake. Of thn two  
animals the ox is the most docile.  
Iij all co&#x27;in&#x27;ries where the ox is the  
ordinary draught animal, his do­  
cility is proverbial. - His intracta­  
bility, where it exists, has &quot;arisen  
from an occasional use of him on­  
ly, with long aud irregular . inter­  
vals; during&#x27; which, the habit of  
discipline being broken, a new one  
is to be formed.  
The second objection lianas lit­  
tle found ition., The constitution  
of the ox accommodates itself as  
readily as that of ih horse to dif­  
ferent climates. Not only in an­  
cient Greece and Italy, but through­  
out Asia, as presented to us in an­  
cient history, the ox and the plough  
are associnlcd. At. this day, in the  
warm parts of India and China,  
  
the ox, not the horso, is in the  
  
draught service. In every part of  
  
India the ox always appears, even  
  
in the train of hr armies. And in  
  
the hottest parts of the West Indies,  
  
the ox is employed in hauling the  
we isfhty, , prodace , jo,the&quot;senuor!s,  
  
The mistake here; as in the former  
  
ease, has arisen from the eflecl -of  
  
an occasional employment only,  
  
with no other than green food.  
  
The fermentation of this in the an­  
imal, heated by the weather, and  
  
fretted by t&#x27;le discipline, will read  
  
ily account for his sinking under  
  
his exertions&#x27;; when green food

habit of labour, would have no

be safely appealed to on this point.  
in the fourth place, it is alleged  
that he is slower in his movements.  
This is true, but&#x27; in a Jess deeree

Oxen &#x27;That are well chosen for their

account of their age, or the lean­  
ness, occasioned by the costliness of  
the food they require,, lose &#x27;he ad­  
vantage where they might have  
once had it?

weight. The ox is not as &quot;-ell a­

The objections generally made to the ox are—lIst, that he is less tractable  
than the horse; 2d, that he does not bear heat as wel]; 3d, that he does not  
answer for the single plough used in our corn-fields ; 4th, that he is slower  
in his movements; 5th, that he is less fit for carrying the produce of the  
farm to market.  
  
The first objection is certainly founded in mistake. Of the two animals  
the ox is the most docile. In all countries where the ox is the ordinary  
draught animal, his docility is proverbial. His intractability, where it exists,  
has arisen from an occasional use of him only, with long and irregular inter-  
vals; during which the habit of discipline being broken, a new one is to be  
formed.  
  
The second objection has as little foundation. The constitution of the ox  
accommodates itself as readily as that of the horse to different climates.  
Not only in ancient Greece and Italy, but throughout Asia, as presented to  
us in ancient history, the ox and the plough are associated. At this day, in  
the warm parts of India and China, the ox, not the horse, is in the draught  
service. In every part of India the ox always appears, even in the train of  
her armies. And in the hottest parts of the West Indies, the ox is employed  
in hauling the weighty produce to the sea-ports. The mistake here, as in  
the former case, has arisen from the effect of an occasional employment only,  
with no other than green food. The fermentation of this in the animal,  
heated by the weather, and fretted by the discipline, will readily account for

his sinking under his exertions; when green food even, much less dry, with  
a sober habit of labor, would have no such tendency.  
  
The third objection also is not a solid one. The ox can, by a proper har-  
ness, be used singly, as well as the horse, between the rows of Indian corn;  
and equally so used for other purposes. Experience may be safely appealed  
to on this point.  
  
In the fourth place, it is alleged that he is slower in his movements. This  
is true, but in a less degree. than is often taken for granted. Oxen that are  
well chosen for their form are not worked after the age of about eight years,  
(the age at which they are best fitted for beef,) are not worked too many to-  
gether, and are suitably matched, may be kept at nearly as quick a step as  
that of the horse—might I not say quicker than that of many of the horses  
we see at work, who, on account of their age, or the leanness occasioned by  
the costliness of the food they require, lose the advantage where they might  
have once had it?  
  
The last objection has most weight. The ox is not as well adapted as the  
horse to the road service, especially for long trips. In common roads, which  
are often soft, and sometimes suddenly become so, the form of his foot and  
the shortness of his leg are disadvantages ; and, on roads frozen or turnpiked,  
the roughness of the surface in the former case, and its hardness in both  
cases, are inconvenient to his cloven foot. But where the distance to market  
is not great, where the varying state of the roads and of the weather can be  
consulted, and where the road service is less in proportion to the farm service,  
the objection is almost deprived of its weight.  
  
In cases where it most applies, its weight is diminished by the considera-  
tion that a much greater proportion of service on the farm may be done by  
oxen than is now commonly done; and that the expense of shoeing them  
is little different from that of keeping horses shod. It is observable that  
when oxen are worked on the farm over rough frozen ground, they suffer so  
much from the want of shoes, however well fed they may be, that it is a  
proper subject for calculation whether true economy does not require for them  
that accommodation, even on the farm, as well as for the horses.  
  
A more important calculation is, whether, in many situations, the general  
saving by substituting the ox for the horse would not balance the expense  
of hiring a conveyance of the produce to market. In the same scale with  
the hire is to be put the value of the grass and hay consumed by the oxen;  
and in the other scale, the value of the corn, amounting to one-half of the  
crop, and of the grass and hay consumed by the horses. Where the market  
is not distant, the value of the corn saved would certainly pay for the car-  
riage of the market portion of the crop, and balance, moreover, any difference  
between the value of the grass and hay consumed by oxen, and the value  
of the oxen when slaughtered for beef. In all these calculations, it is doubt-  
less proper not to lose sight of the rule, that farmers ought to avoid paying  
others for doing what they can do for themselves. But the rule has its ex-  
ceptions, and the error, if it be committed, will not lie in departing from the  
rule, but in not selecting aright the cases which call for the departure. It  
may be remarked that the rule ought to be more or less general, as there  
may or may not be at hand a market by which every produce of labor is  
convertible into money. In the old countries, this is much more the case  
than in new; and in new, much more the case near towns than at a distance  
from them. In this, as in most other parts of our country, a change of cir-  
cumstances is taking place, which renders every thing raised ona farm more  
convertible into money than formerly ; and as the change proceeds, it will  
be more and more a point for consideration how far the labor in doing what  
might be bought, could earn more in another way than the amount of th

effect of Plaster, says:—  
  
“The Plaster or gypsum, though not a manure  
within the farm itself, has been too long neglected  
as afertilizing resource. It is now peginaing to  
take a high and just rank as such. The proofs of  
its efficacy are as incontestible as the causes of it  
are obscure. The experiments of a very distin-  
guished chemist, [Sir Humphry Davy,] led him to  
the opinion, that its substance enters into the sub-  
stance of the plant. Without doubting the fact, it  
does not sufficiently account for the addition made  
to the size and weight of the plant, which greatly  
exceed the quantity of the plaster. It must, there-  
fore, have some further mode of operating.—  
Whether it be by neutralizing some noxious in-  
gredient in the earth, one of the modes by which  
lime is supposed to operate, or by attracting and  
conveying to the plant, food from the earth, the air or  
water, or by exciting the plant to a more active use  
of its feeding powers, whatever they be; or by its  
accretion and assimilation to particular parts of  
plants on which these powers depend—thereby aug-  
menting and strengthening those particular parts,  
and enabling the feeding powers to give propor-  
tional augmentation to every other part; whether  
by any one or more of these processes, or by some  
  
others distinct from them all, the growth of plants:  
  
be promoted by this mineral, remains, it would  
seem, to be yet explained.”’  
  
It will be seen by the above extract, that though  
Mr. Madison was no chemist, yet his philosophic  
mind was able to discover, that Sir Humpkry Davy  
could be only partially correct, that thong the  
substances composing plaster, are found in th

to augment labor and contract the   
• iiace on which it is employed. There can­  
not be a more rational principle in the   
•ode of agriculture, than that every farm   
which is in good heart should be kept so   
that every one not in good heart should   
ne made so, and that what is right as to the   
:atilt generally, is so as to every part of   
-very farm. Any system, therefore, or   
want of systeth, which tendS• to make a   
ieh farm prior, or does not tend to make   
poor farm rich cannot. be good for the   
,waer. The profit where there is any will   
balance the loss of intrinsic value   
-astained by the land. The neglect of   
~:inures is a great error which claims par­  
• icular notice. It may be traced to the   
-ante eau e with ~our excessive crop­  
ping. In the early stages of our agricul   
:are, it was more convenient and more   
profitable to bring new land info cultiva­  
tion than to improve exhausted lands   
Nothing is more certain than that contin­  
qal cropping without manure deprives the   
oil of its fertility, it is equally certain,   
that fertility may be preserved or restor­  
d by giving to the earth animal or vega­  
:able manure equivolent to the matter ta­  
ken from it: The Chinese it is said smile   
tt the idea that land needs rest, because   
industrious use is wade of every • fertili­  
zing particle that can contribute towards   
replat,&#x27;Thgkwhat has been drawn from it,   
:ind this is the more pra,ticable with   
them,i as almost the whole of what is   
grown on the farm is consumed within   
them. That a restoration to the earth of   
all that annually grows on it, prevents   
its i upoverishinent, this is sufficiently­  
seen in our forests, where the annual fo­  
liage of the . trees and plants, replace the   
fertility of which they deprived the earth.   
The most eligible mode of preserving the   
richness, and of enriching the poverty of   
a farm is, certainly that of applying to   
the soil a sufficiency of animal and vege­  
table matter in a putrifi d state in order   
to procure which, to much care cannot be   
observed in saviu,c,, every material furnish­  
ed by the farm. This resource Was;among   
the earliest discoveries of men living by   
agriculture, and a proper &quot;se of has been

importance of thorough tillage by the follow­  
ing apologue: A vine dresser had two daugh­  
ters and a vineyard; when his eldest daugh­  
ter was married he gave her a third of his  
vineyard for a portion, notw ithstanding which,  
he had tho saute quantity of fruit as former­

he had been accustomed to give to the whole

My impression is that Pennsylvania far­

periment of the old Homan. The large ideas  
which are so striking a characteristic of us

economy of Virginia is thus alluded to:  
  
“ Whilst there was an abundance of fresh  
and fertile soil, it was the interest of the  
cultivator to spread his labour over as great  
a surface as possible. Land being cheap,  
and labour dear, and the land co-operating  
powerfully with the labour, it was profitable  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
98  
  
to draw as much as possible from the land.  
Labour is now comparatively cheaper, and land  
dearer, It might be profitable, therefore, now, to  
contract the surface over which labour is spread,  
even if the soil retained its freshness and fertility.  
But this is not the case. Much of the fertile  
soils are exhausted, and unfertile soils are brought  
into cultivation; and both co-operating less with  
labour in producing the crop, it is necessary to  
consider how far labour can be profitably exerted  
on them: whether it ought not to be applied  
towards making them fertile, rather than in  
further impoverishing them ; or whether it might  
not be more profitably applied to mechanical  
operations, or domestic manufactures.

j hold ..the same views&quot; urged by . Madison.  
&quot;The objections generallv made ti the ox  
  
are IsC&#x27; that he is less tractable than the  
  
: horse ; 2nd. that he does not bear heat as  
. .Jwell;&quot; 3d., that he does not answer for the  
  
5 : single plow used in our, cornfields ; -4th.  
i that be is slower in his, movements. 5ih?  
  
. that he is less fit for carrying ihe produce  
  
(r oi.tne farm to market, ahehrst objection  
V- is Certainly founded in eiTor. t; . Of all;ani-  
  
vmals the&#x27; ox is the most docile. . In all  
countries where the ox is the ordinary  
draught animal; his docility is prorerbial.  
  
Hi (intractability where it exists,! has  
ar sen from an occasional use of him only.  
  
with long andnrregular intervals ; during&#x27;  
  
which, , the habit of discipline being  
broken, a new one is to be lb rmed. : The  
  
econd obiection has a little foundatmn.  
  
The constitution of the ox accommodates  
itself.&#x27;as readily, as that ;pt the horse. to  
different climates. &#x27; Not only .; in ancient  
  
Greece and Italy, but throughout Asia, as  
presented to us in ancient Jiistory, the ox .  
and the -plough ; are associated, s f In the  
warm parts of Intliaf and China,&#x27; the ox,  
  
not the horse, is in the draught service-  
  
In every part of India the ox always&quot; ap­  
pears, ; even in the v train ot her armies.  
.The third objection is also not a solid one.  
The ox can by a propyls harness, be?, used  
singly, as well as the hyrse, r between; the  
ro ws&quot; f com ; and equally v so used for  
other purposes. Experience may be safe­  
ly appealed to -; on this, point. . In the  
fourth place it is alleged that he is slower  
in his movements. , This is true, but in a  
less degree than is often Jakcn for granted.&quot;  
Oxen that are well chosen for their form,  
are not olten worked ..after, the age f  
about eight years, (the age at&#x27;which they  
are best fitted for beef,) are not worked  
too many, together, s and j are suitably  
matched, may be kept at nearly&quot; as quxk  
a step as that of the horse, might I not  
tay quicker than that of , many &quot;of the  
horses wo see at; work, who, on account of  
their age, or. the&quot; leanness&#x27; occasioned by  
the costliness of the food they require, lose  
he advantage wher6 they nce might huye  
hod it? The last j objection has most  
weight. The ox is not as well adapted as  
the horse to the road service, especially  
for long trips; In common roads, which  
  
are often soft, and sometimes suddenly be ,1  
  
come&#x27; 90 the form ml his foot ann the  
sh?)rtness of liis leg are disadvantages; and  
On roads frozen or turnpiked, the rough­  
ness of the surface in the former case, and  
its hardness in both cases, are inconvenient  
to his cloven foot.. But where the distance  
to market is not great, whero the varying  
state of the roads and of the weather c m  
be consulted, and where the road service  
i less in proportion to. the farm &#x27;service,
