Herring. Mr. Franklin told me that in that part of New England where his father lived, two rivers flowed into the sea, in one of which they caught great numbers of herring, and in the other not one. Yet the places where these rivers discharged themselves into the sea were not far apart. They had observed that when the herrings came in spring to deposit their spawn, they always swam up one river, where they used to catch them, but never came into the other. This circumstance led Mr. Franklin’s father, who had settled between the two rivers, to try whether it was not possible to make the herrings also live in the other river. For that purpose he put out his nets, as they were coming up for spawning, and he caught some. He took the spawn out of them, and carefully carried it across the land to the other river. It was hatched, and the consequence was that every year afterwards they caught more herring in that river, and this is still the case. This leads one to believe that the fish always like to spawn in the same place where they are hatched, and from which they first put out to sea, being as it were accustomed to it. The following is another peculiar observation: it has never formerly been known that codfish were to be caught off Cape Henlopen; they were always caught at the mouth of the Delaware. But at present they are numerous in the former place. From this it may be concluded that fish likew

er some more come out, creep to the fly and carry it away. Some time ago Mr. Franklin put a little earthen pot with treacle in it into a closet. A number of ants got into the pot and devoured the treacle very quietly. But as he observed it he shook them out, and tied the pot with a thin string to a nail which he had fastened in the ceiling, so that the pot hung down by the string. A single ant by chance remained in the pot: this ant ate till it was satisfied; but when it wanted to get away it was under great concern to find its way out. It ran about the bottom of the pot, but in vain. At last it found after many attempts the way to get to the ceiling by the string. After it had come there, it ran first to the wall and then to the floor. It had hardly been away for half an hour, when a great swarm of ants came out, climbed up to the ceiling, crept along the string to the pot, and began to eat again. This they continued till the treacle was all eaten. In the meantime one swarm kept running down the string and the other up all day

Mr. Franklin and several other gentlemen frequently told me that an Indian, who owned Rhode Island, had sold it to the English for a pair of spectacles. It is large enough for a principality, and has a separate government at present. This Indian knew how to set a true value upon a pair of glasses, for if they were scarce, they would undoubtedly on account of their great usefulness have the same value as diamonds.

But in the summer of the year 1749 an immense quantity of worms appeared on the meadows, which devoured the grass, and did great damage, so the people repented of their enmity against the corn thieves for they thought they had

 Ant.—Kalm relates (Travels  
in North America) that the celebrated Dr. Franklin told him,  
that, having placed a pot containing treacle, in a closet in-  
fested with ants, these insects found their way to it, and  
were feasting very heartily when he discovered them. He  
then shook them out, and suspended the pot by a string from  
the ceiling. By chance, one ant remained, which, after eat-  
ing his fill, with some difficulty found its way up the string,  
and thence reaching the ceiling, escaped by the wall to its  
nest. In less than half an hour a great company of ants  
sallied out of their hole, climbed the ceiling, crept along the  
string into the pot, and began to eat again. This they con-  
tinued until the treacle was all consumed, one swarm run-  
ning up the string, while another passed down. That on

“Mr. Frankrirn told me, that in that part of New England  
where his father lived, two rivers fell into the sea, in one of which  
they caught great numbers of herrings, and in the other not one.  
Yet the places where these rivers discharged themselves into the  
sea were not far asunder. They had observed that when the  
herrings came in spring to deposit their spawn, they always swam  
up the river where they used to catch them, but never came into  
the other. This circumstance led Mr. Pranklii’s father, who was  
settled between the two rivers, to try whether it was not possible  
to make the herrings likewise live in the other river. For that  
purpose he put out his nets, as they were coming up for spawning,  
and he caught some. He took the spawn out of them and care-  
fully carried it across the land into the other river. It was  
hatched and the consequence was that every year afterwards they  
caught more herrings in that river; and this is still the case.  
This leads one to believe that the fish always like to spawn in the  
same place where they were hatched, and from whence they first  
put out to sea; being, as it were, accustomed to it.”

Very correct, Mr. Kalm. All observation since that time  
shows that you were a close observer. Peter Kalm was a  
Swede, an eminent botanist, and the favorite student of  
Charles Linneaus, the great botanist. Our beautiful Kal-  
mias (the Laurel) was named after Peter Kalm.

in their numbers seems to have been speedily effected in New Eng-

that he was told by Dr. Franklin in 1750 that ‘‘by means of the  
premiums which have been settled for killing them in New England,  
they have been so extirpated that they are very rarely seen, and in  
a few places only.’’ In the summer of 1749, however, an immense  
quantity of worms appeared in the meadows and did great damage,  
so that the people gladly abated their enmity of the maize-thieves,  
believing that these birds lived chiefly upon the worms before the  
maize was ripe, and thus kept the worms in check. The hay cro
