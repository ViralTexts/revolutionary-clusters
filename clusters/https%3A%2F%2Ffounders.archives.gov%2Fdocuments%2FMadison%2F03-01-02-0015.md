[4 March 1809]  
Unwilling to depart from examples, of the most revered authority, I avail myself of the occasion now presented, to express the profound impression made on me, by the call of my Country to the station, to the duties of which I am about to pledge myself, by the most solemn of sanctions. So distinguished a mark of confidence, proceeding from the deliberate and tranquil suffrage of a free and virtuous nation, would, under any circumstances, have commanded my gratitude and devotion; as well as filled me with an awful sense of the trust to be assumed. Under the various circumstances which give peculiar solemnity to the existing period, I feel that both the honor and the responsibility allotted to me, are inexpressibly enhanced.  
The present situation of the world is indeed without a parallel; and that of our own Country full of difficulties. The pressure of these too is the more severely felt, because they have fallen upon us at a moment, when the national prosperity being at a height not before attained, the contrast resulting from the change, has been rendered the more striking. Under the benign influence of our Republican institutions, and the maintainance of peace with all nations, whilst so many of them were engaged in bloody and wasteful wars, the fruits of a just policy were enjoyed in an unrivalled growth of our faculties and resources. Proofs of this were seen in the improvements of agriculture; in the successful enterprizes of commerce; in the progress of manufactures, and useful arts; in the increase of the public revenue, and the use made of it in reducing the public debt; and in the valuable works and establishments every where multiplying over the face of our land.  
It is a precious reflection that the transition from this prosperous condition of our Country, to the scene which has for some time been distressing us, is not chargeable on any unwarrantable views, nor, as I trust, on any involuntary errors, in the public Councils. Indulging no passions which trespass on the rights or the repose of other nations, it has been the true glory of the United States to cultivate peace by observing justice, and to entitle themselves to the respect of the nations at war, by fulfilling their neutral obligations, with the most scrupulous impartiality. If there be candor in the world, the truth of these assertions, will not be questioned. Posterity at least will do justice to them.  
This unexceptionable course could not avail against the injustice and violence of the Belligerent powers. In their rage against each other, or impelled by more direct motives, principles of retaliation have been introduced, equally contrary to universal reason, and acknowledged law. How long their arbitrary edicts will be continued, in spite of the demonstrations that not even a pretext for them has been given by the United States, and of the fair and liberal attempts to induce a revocation of them, cannot be anticipated. Assuring myself, that under every vicisitude, the determined spirit and united Councils of the nation, will be safeguards to its honor and its essential interests, I repair to the post assigned me, with no other discouragement, than what springs from my own inadequacy to its high duties. If I do not sink under the weight of this deep conviction, it is because I find some support in a consciousness of the purposes, and a confidence in the principles which I bring with me into this arduous service.  
To cherish peace and friendly intercourse with all nations having correspondent dispositions; to maintain sincere neutrality towards belligerent nations; to prefer in all cases, amicable discussion and reasonable accommodation of differences, to a decision of them by an appeal to Arms; to exclude foreign intrigues and foreign partialities, so degrading to all Countries, and so baneful to free ones; to foster a spirit of independence too just to invade the rights of others, too proud to surrender our own, too liberal to indulge unworthy prejudices ourselves, and too elevated not to look down upon them in others; to hold the Union of the States as the basis of their peace and happiness; to support the Constitution, which is the cement of the Union, as well in its limitations as in its authorities; to respect the rights and authorities reserved to the States and to the people, as equally incorporated with, and essential to the success of, the general system; to avoid the slightest interference with the rights of conscience, or the functions of religion so wisely exempted from civil jurisdiction; to preserve in their full energy, the other salutary provisions in behalf of private and personal rights, and of the freedom of the press; to observe œconomy in public expenditures; to liberate the public resources by an honorable discharge of the public debts; to keep within the requisite limits a standing military force, always remembering, that an Armed and trained militia is the firmest bulwark of Republics; that without standing Armies their liberty can never be in danger; nor with large ones, safe; to promote by authorized means, improvements friendly to agriculture, to manufactures and to external as well as internal commerce; to favor, in like manner, the advancement of science and the diffusion of information as the best aliment to true liberty; to carry on the benevolent plans which have been so meritoriously applied to the conversion of our aboriginal neighbours from the degradation and wretchedness of savage life, to a participation of the improvements of which the human mind and manners are susceptible in a civilized state: As far as sentiments and intentions such as these can aid the fulfilment of my duty, they will be a resource which cannot fail me.  
It is my good fortune, moreover, to have the path in which I am to tread, lighted by examples of illustrious services, successfully rendered in the most trying difficulties, by those who have marched before me. Of those of my immediate predecessor, it might least become me here to speak. I may however, be pardoned for not suppressing the sympathy with which my heart is full, in the rich reward he enjoys in the benedictions of a beloved Country, gratefully bestowed for exalted talents, zealously devoted, thro’ a long career, to the advancement of its highest interest and happiness.  
But the source to which I look for the aids which alone can supply my deficiences, is in the well tried intelligence and virtue of my fellow Citizens, and in the Councils of those representing them, in the other Departments associated in the care of the national interests. In these my confidence will, under every difficulty be best placed; next to that which we have all been encouraged to feel in the guardianship and guidance of that Almighty Being whose power regulates the destiny of nations, whose blessings have been so conspicuously dispensed to this rising Republic, and to whom we are bound to address our devout gratitude for the past, as well as our fervent supplications and best hopes for the future.

of our land.  
  
It is a precious reflection that  
the transition from this prosper-  
ous condition of our country, to  
the scene which has for some  
time been distressing us, is not  
chargeable on any unwarrantable  
views, nor as I trust, on any in-

of the demonstrations that not  
  
even a pretext for them has been  
  
given by the United Statics, and  
of the fair and liberal attempts  
to induce a revocation of them  
cannot be anticipated. Assuring  
myself that under every vicissi-  
tude, the determined spirit and  
united councils of the nation will  
be safe-guards to its honour and  
its essential interests, I repair to  
the post assigned me, with no  
  
other discouragement than what  
springs from my own: inadequacy  
to its high duties. If I do not

an I wasteful wars, the fruits of a just policy were enjoy.  
Ed in an unrivalled growth of our faculties and resources.  
Proofs &gt;f this were seen in the improvements of agricul­  
ture j in the successful enterprises of commerce ; in the  
progress of n anufac.ures and useful arts ;in the increase  
ofthe public revenue, and the use made of it in reducing  
the public debt, and in the valuable works and establish­  
ments every where multiplying over the face of our land.  
It is a precious reflection that the transition from this  
prosperous condition of our country, to the scene which  
has for some time been distressing us, is not chargeable  
on mv unwarrantable views, nor, as I trust, on any in­  
voluntary er-ors, in the public councils. Indulging no  
passions&quot; which tresspass on the rights, or the repose of  
other nations, it has been the true glory of the United  
States to cultivate peace, by observing justice; and to en­  
title themselves to the respect of the nations at war, by  
fulfilling the ir neutral obligations, with the most scrupu­  
lous impartiality. If there be candor in the world, the  
truth of these assertions will not be questioned ; poste­  
ry, at least, will do justice to them.  
*♦ This unexceptionable course could not avail against the  
injustice and violence of the belligerent powers. In their  
against each other, or impelled by more direct mo­  
tives, principles of retaliation have been introduced,  
equally contrary to Universal reason, and acknowledged  
law. How long their arbitrary edicts will be continued,  
in spite A the demonstrations that not ever, a pretext for  
them has .en given by the United States, and of the  
fair ml liberal attempt to induce a revocation of them,  
cannot be anticipated. Assuring myself, that under eve­  
ry vicissitude, the determined spirit and united councils  
of the nation will be safe-guards to its honor and its es­  
sential interest?, I repair to the post assigned me, with  
no other discouragement than what springs from my own  
inadequacy to us high duties. 11 Ido not sink under  
th&lt; weight o! this deep conviction, it is because I find  
aotn&lt; support in a consciousness of the purposes, and a  
co fi &#x27;&lt;-i.cc in the. principles which I bring with me, into  
arduous service.  
To cherish peace and friendly intercourse with all na*  
  
tions having correspondent dispositions; to maintain  
sincere neutrality towards belligerent .ations; to prefer, in  
all cases, amicable discussion and reasonable *cc nmo­  
tiation of differences, to a decision oi then b a i -ai  
to arms; to exclude foreign i trigues an.l foreign p-.rtia­  
liti s, so degrading to all countries, anc so baneful to free  
ones ; to foster a spirit of independence, too to invade  
the rights of others, too proud to surrender our own ;  
too liberal to indulge unworthy prejudices ourselves, and  
too elevated not to look down upon them in others; to  
hold the union of the states as the basis of their peace  
and happiness; to support (he constitution, which is the  
cement of the union, as well in its limitations as in its  
authorities ; to respec: the rights and authorities reserved  
to the states and to the people, as equally incorporated  
with, and essential to the success of, the general sy**u m;  
to avt id the slightest interference w th the rights of con­  
science or the functions of religion, so wisely exempted  
from civil jurisdiction ; to preserve in then fuil uergy  
the other salutary provisions in behalf» f private Btpersonal  
rights, and of the freedom ofthe press ; to observe econo­  
my in public expenditures; to liberate the pubh re­  
sources by a.i honorable discharge of the public debts;  
to keep within the requisite limits a standing military  
force, always remembering that an armed and trained  
militia is the firmest bulwark of Republics ; that without  
standing armies their ibertv can never be in danger;  
nor, with large ones safe ; to promote by authorised means  
improvements friendly to agriculture, to manufactures,  
and to external as well as inn rrial commerce ; to favoi in  
like manner, the advancem* nt of science, and the difw­  
sion of information, as the best aliment t true liberty; to  
carry on the benevolent plans, which have been so met ito  
riously applied to the conversion of our aboriginal neigh­  
bors from the degradation and wretchedness of sava.;e  
life, to a participation ofthe improveme ts of which the  
human mind and manners are susceptible in a civilised  
state: As far as sentiments and intentions, sush as these,  
can aid the fulfilment of my duty, they will be a resource  
which cannot fail me.  
It is my good fortune, moreover, to have the path, in  
which I am to tread, lighted by examples of illustrious  
services, succesefulb rendered in the most trying diffi­  
culties by those who have marched before me. Of those of  
my immediate predecessor, it might least become me  
hereto speak. I may however be pardoned for no! sup­  
pressing the sympathy with which my heart is full, in the  
rich reward he enjoys in the benedictions of a beloved  
country, gratefully bestowed for cxaltci talents zrah usly  
devoted through a long career, to the advancement of its  
highest interest and happiness.  
But the source towdiich I look for the aids which a­  
lone can supply my deficiencies, is in the well tried intel­  
ligence and virtue of my fellow citizens, and in the coun­  
cils of those rep resenting them, in the other departrtv  
associated in the care of the national interests. in thew  
my &quot;confidence will under every difficulty be best placed,  
next o&#x27;hat Which we have all been encouraged to feel  
in ihe guaidianship and guidance of that almighty Being,  
whose power regulates the destiny &lt; f nations, who;-, bles­  
ings have been so conspicuously dispensed to this rising  
Republic, and to whom wi are bound to address oui ele­  
vont gratitude for the past, as w 11 as our fervent vsuppll­  
cations and best hopes for the future

 be given of the a­  
bove arrangement by the Serjeant at Arms,  
and lie is charged under the direction of the  
Committee of the Senate with its execution.  
We are all of us solicitous, as you may ea­  
sily conceive to hear the inaugural Exfose  
of this celebrated Statesman.  
Washington, March 4, 1809.  
This Day, at 12 o&#x27;clock, JAMES MA DI­  
SC).\ took the oath of office as Erf.st­  
de NT of the Usited Srjrus, and deli­  
vered, in the Chamber of the llouee of  
Hefiresemaiives, in the /iresencc of the  
Senate, most of the late Representatives,  
and a large concourse of Citizens, the  
following  
  
5S F E E C II :  
UNWILLING to depart from examples,  
of the most revered authority, I avail my­  
self of the occasion now presented, to express  
the profound impression made or. n.e, by the  
call of my country to the station, to the duties  
of which I am about to pledge myself, by  
the most solemn of sanctions. So distinguish­  
ed a mark of confidence, proceeding from  
the deliberate and tranquil suffrage of a free  
and virtuous nation, would, under any cir­  
cumstances, have commanded my gratitude,  
and devotion ; as well a3 filled me with an  
awful sense of the trust to be assumed._  
Under the various circumstances which give  
peculiar solemnity to the existing period, I  
feel that both the honor and the- responsibi­  
lity allotted to me are inexpressibly enhan­  
ced  
Tiie present situation of the world is in­  
deed .without a parallel ; and that of our  
own country full of difficulties. The pres­  
sure ol the^e too is the more severely fe:t,  
because they have fallen upon us at a mo  
meat, when the national prosperity, being  
at a height not before attained, the contrast  
resulting from the change, h is been render­  
ed ihe more striking, under thebtniguin­  
fluence of our Republican institutions, arid  
the maintenance of peace with all nations,  
whilst so many of them were engaged in  
bloody and wasteful wars, the fruits of a just  
policy were enjoyed in an unrivalled growth  
of our faculties and resources. Proofs of this  
■were seen in the improvements of agricul­  
ture ; in the successful enterprises ol com­  
merce ; in the progress of manufactures and  
useful arts ; in the increase cf the public,  
revenue, and the use made of it in reducing j  
the public debt; and in the valuable works  
and establishments ev.erv where niuliiply­  
ing over the face of our land.  
It is a precious reflection ‘hut the transition  
., L&#x27;om this prosperous condition of our country,  
to the scene which has fer some time been  
distressing us, is not chargeable on any un­  
warrantable views, no:-, es I smst, cn any  
involuntary errors, in t.ie public councils.—  
Indulging no passions which trespass c n the  
rights, or the repose of other nations, itl.hs  
been the true glory of the United Stales to  
cultivate peace, by observing justice, and to  
entitle themselvfcs to tha respect Of the na­  
tions at war. by fulfilling their neutral obli­  
gations, with the in st scrupulous impartiali­  
ty. If there be condor in the worM, the  
truth of these assertions will not be ques­  
tioned ; posterity, at least, will do justice to  
them.  
  
i ms unexceptionable course cou.&#x27;d not  
av^il against the injustice r.nci violence of the  
belligerent powers. In their ra^c agains:  
each otiier, or impelled by ’no.&#x27;* direct mo­  
tives, principles of rriniiatioh hare been in­  
troduced, equally contrary to universal rea­  
son, ami acknowledged law. How long their j  
arbitary edicts will be continued, in spite of I  
tlie demonstrations that not even a pretext  
for them has been given by the Uhited States,  
and of the f brand liberal attempt to induce  
a revocation of them, cannot be anticipated.  
Assuring myself, that under every vicissi­  
tude, the determined spirit and united coun­  
cils of the nation will -.o safe-guards to its  
honor and its essential interests, I repair  
to the post assigned me, with no other dis­  
com agement than what springs from my  
•own inadequacy t6 its high duties. If J do not  
sink under the weight of this deep conviction,  
it is because I find some support in a consci­  
ousness nl the purposes, and a confidence in  
.the principles which I bring with me, into  
this H&#x27;ditons service.

degrading to all countries, and so baneful to

ers  
precluded the possibility of a treaty, and it nevei  
entered his head that they would have been daring  
enough to conclude a treaty against his orders. But  
the ministers having obtained what they considered  
the substance, disregarded the form, and sent a trea­  
ty as little looked f r, as desired.  
(To be continued. J  
  
J VVashxkct n, March 4.  
1 tits day at 12 o’clock, his excellency JAMES  
MADISON, Esrj. president of the United States,  
delivered in the Hall of the Representatives, the fol­  
lowing Inaugural address, and was immediately  
sworn into office amidst an immense concourse of  
spectators*  
Un willing to depart from examples of the most re­  
vered authorityf!VI avail myself of the occasion now  
presented, to express the profound impression made  
on me, by the .call of my country to that station,  
to the duties cf Which 1 am about to pledge myself,  
by the most solemn of sanctions. So distinguished a  
m irk of confidence, proceeding from the deliberate  
and tranquil suffrage of a free and virtuous nation,  
would, under any circumstances, have commanded  
my gratitude and devotion, as well as filled me with  
an awful sense of the trust to be assumed* Under  
the various circumstances, which give peculiar so­  
lemnity to the existing period, I feci that both the  
honour and responsibility alotted to me are inex­  
pressibly er.hapsed.  
I he present situation of the world is indeed with­  
* p&#x27;*rAlIel^: and that of our own country full of  
difficulties. The pressure of these too, is the uiore  
severely felt, because they have fallen upon us at a  
moment, when the national prosperity being at a  
height not before attained, the contrast resulting  
from the coange, has been rendered the more strik­  
U ruler the benign influence of our republican  
institutions, and the maintenance of peace with all  
nations, whilst so many of them were engaged in  
bloody and wasteful wars, the fruits of a just policy  
were enjoyed, in an unrivalled growth of our facul­  
ties and resources. Proofs of this were seen in the  
improvements of agriculture, in the successful en­  
terprizes of commerce, in the progress of manufac­  
tures, and useful arts ; in the increase of the public  
revenue, and the use made of it in reducing the pub­  
lic debt, and in the valuable works and establish­  
ments, every where multiplying over the face of our  
land.  
  
It is a precious reflection that the transition from  
tills prosperous condition of our country, to the scene  
which has for some time been distressing us, is not  
chargeable on any unwarrantable views, nor, as I  
trust, on any voluntary errours, in the public coun­  
cils. Indulging no passions which trespass on the  
rights or the repose of other nations, it has been the  
true glory of the United States to cultivate peace, by  
observing justice ; and to entitle themselves to the  
respect of the nations at war, by fulfillingtlieir neu­  
tral obligations with the most scrupulous impartiality.  
If there be candour in the world the truth of these  
assertions will not be questioned. Posterity at least  
will do justiceto them. *  
1 his unexceptionable course could not avail against  
the injustice and violence of the belligerent powers.  
In their rage against each other, or impelled by  
more direct motives, principles of retaliation have  
been introduced equally contrary to universal reason  
and acknowledged law. How long their arbitrary  
edicts will be continued, in spite of the demonstrati­  
ons that not even a pretext for them has been given  
by the United States, and of the fair and liberal  
attempts to induce a revcoatinn of them, cannot be  
anticipated. Assuring myself that under every  
vicissitude, the determined spirit and united coun­  
cils of the nation will be safe guards to its honour  
and its essential interests, I repair to the post as­  
signed me, with no other discouragement than what  
springs from my own inadequacy to its high duties.  
It Ido not sink under the weight of this deep con­  
viction. it Is because I find some support in a con­  
sciousness of the purposes, and a confidence in the  
pi inciples which 1 bring with me into this arduous  
service.*  
To cherish peace and friendly intercourse with  
all nations having correspondent dispositions ; to  
maintain sindere neutrality towards belligerent nati­  
ons; to prefer in all cast&#x27;s amicable discussion and  
reasonable accommodation of differences, to a deci­  
sion of them by un appeal to arms ; to exclude fo­  
reign intrigues and foreign partialities, so degrading  
to all countries, and so baneful to free ones, fo fos­  
ter a spirit of independence, too just to invade the  
rights of others, too proud to surrender our own,  
too liberal to indulge,unworthy prejudices ourselves,  
and too elevated not to look down upon them in o­  
tliers ; to hold the union of the states as the basis of  
their peace and happiness ; to support the constitu­  
ti ai, which is the cement of the union ss weil in its  
limitations as in its authorities ; to respect theri dits  
and authorities reserved to the states and to the peo­

I&#x27;M WIT.LINO to depart from examples  
of the most revered authority 1 avail myself  
of tlie occasion now presented, to express  
t!&gt;e profound impression msde on me, by  
the rad of wit country to the station, to the  
| duties of which I am about to pledge my.  
&lt; ! st W, by the most solemn of sanctions. So

&#x27; | s filled mo with mi awful sense ol (In  
trust to be ass&#x27;trued. Under tiie vsriou  
ircumstances, which give peculiar solein  
mty to the existi.ig pei &gt;d, I 1»vl that boil  
the honor a id the responsibility allotted U  
, me ate inexpressibly enhuiici tU  
The present situation of the wo ld is in  
deed without a parallel ; and tiiat ol out  
own country full of difficulties. The press­  
ure of these too, is the more svetely tell,  
because they have fallen upon us at a mo­  
ment when tiie national prosperity being at  
a height not before attained, the contrast  
resulting from the change, lias besrt ren­  
dered the more striking. Under the ben­  
ign influence of our republican institutions,  
and the maintenance of peace with all na­  
il ions whilst so many of them were engaged  
in blood; and wasteful wars, the fruits ol a  
just policy were enjoyed, in an unrivalled  
growth of our facnlttes St resources. Proofs  
of Uns were .seen in the improvements ol  
agriculture, in the successful enterprises of  
comnierce, in tlie progress ot manufactures ;  
and useful art* t in the increase ol the pub­  
lic revenue, and the use made of it in redu­  
cing the public debt, and in the valuable  
works ant&#x27; establishments, every where  
multiplying over the face of our land.  
It is a precious reflection that the  
transition from this prosperous condi­  
tion ol our countiy, to secure which  
has for some time been distressing us,  
is not chargeable on any unwarrantable  
views, nor, as I trust, on any involun­  
tary errors in the public councils. In­  
dulging no passion which trespass on  
the rights, or the repose of other na­  
tions, it has been the true glory of the  
United Stutes to cultivate peace, by ob­  
serving justice; and to entitle them­  
selves ta the respect of the nations at  
war, by fulfilling their neutral obliga­  
tions with the most scrupulous impar­  
tiality. If there be candor in the world  
the truth of these assertions w ill not be  
questioned. Posterity at least will do  
  
justice to them.  
This unexceptionable course could  
not avail against the injustice and vio­  
lence of the belligerent powers. In  
their rage against each other, or impel­  
led by mor^direct motives, principles  
of retaliation have been introduced e­  
qually contrary to universal reason and  
acknowledged law —How long their  
arbitrary edicts will be continued, in  
spite of the demonstrations that not c­  
ven a pretext for them has been given  
by the United States, and of the fair  
and liberal attempts to induce a revoca­  
tion of them cannot be anticipated. As­  
suring myself that under every vicissi­  
i tude, the determined spirit and united  
councils of the nation will be safeguards  
to its honor and its essential interests,  
1 I repair to the post assigned me, with  
no other discouragement than what  
springs from my own inadequacy to its  
high duties. If I do not sink under the  
weight of this deep conviction, it is bc­  
i cause I find support in a consciousness  
of the purposes, and a confidence in  
the principles which I bring with me  
i into this arduous service.  
To cherish peace and friendly inter­  
; course with all nations having corres­  
; pondent dispositions ; to maintain sin­  
1 cere neutrality towards belligerent na­  
j tions ; to pref r in all cases amicable  
! discussion and reasonable accomadalion  
&#x27; of differences, to a decision of them by  
an appeal t® arms ; to exclude foreign  
intrigues and foreign partialities, so  
degrading to all countries, and so bane­  
ful to free ones ; to foster a spirit of  
independence, too just to invade the  
rights of others, too proud to surrender  
our own, too liberal to indulge unwor­  
  
thy prejudices ourselves, and too eleva­  
ted not to look down upon them in oth­  
ers ; to hold the union of the slates as  
the basis of their peace and happiness ;  
to support the constitution, which is the  
cement of the union as well in its limi­  
tations as in i’s authorities ; to respect  
the rights and authorities reserved to  
the states and to the people, as equally  
incorporated with, and essential to the  
success of the general system ; to avoid  
the slightest interference with the  
rights of conscience or the functions of  
religion, so wisely exempted from civil  
jurisdiction ; to preserve in their full  
energy the other salutary provisions in  
behalf«f private and personal rights,  
and ol the freedom of the press ; lo oh­  
serve economy in public expenditures ;  
to liberate the public resources by au  
honourable discharge of the public  
debts ; to keep within the requisite lim­  
its a standing military force, always re­  
membering that an armed and trained  
militia is the firmest hulwatk of repub­  
lics ; that without standing armies  
their liberty can never he in danger,  
nor, with large ones safe ; to pruntolc  
by uuthorsed means impro&#x27;emlkts  
friendly to agriculture, to inanufar,  
tures, and to external, as well as inti r­  
nal commerce ; to favor in like man­  
ner, the advancement of science, and  
lite diffusion of information, as the hesi  
aliment to true liberty; to carry 01  
the benevolent plans which have brer  
so meritoriously applied, lotheconvct  
sion of our uboi initial neighbors frorr  
the dtgredaiion and wietchedness o  
savage life ; to a participation of tlx  
improvements to which the bumai  
mind and manners are susceptible in  
civil!/. &lt;1 state : .\■, far as sentiment  
and intent^/ns, such &lt;&gt; theft? cou ah  
  
the fulf.h&#x27; *.:u ofm* detv, they wi” be  
a 11-source which cannot fail me. _  
It is n.y good fortune, moreover, W  
, have the path in which ! am to tread,  
lighted hy examples of illustrious »ei­  
vices, surces-iv■« iy tendered, in ?!.:e.  
1 most trying difficulties, hy those v.i.o  
have marched before me. (if those of*  
niv immediate predecessor, it might at  
least become me here to speak. I may,  
however, be pardoned for not suppress­  
ing tlie sympathy with which my heart  
is full, in the rich reward he enjoys in  
the benedictions cf a beloved country,  
grutciully bestowed for exalted talents,  
zealously devoted, through a long ca­  
reer, to the advancement of its highest  
j interests and happiness.  
But the source to which 1 look fur  
the aid which alone can supply my de­  
ficiencies, is in the well tried intelli­  
gence and virtue of my fellow citizens,  
and in the councils of those represent­  
ing them, in the other departments as­  
sociated in the care of the national in­  
terests. In these, my confidence will,  
] under every difficulty, be placed ; next  
■ to that which we have all l&gt;e*en encour­  
aged to feel, in the guardianship &amp;. gui­  
dance of that Almighty Being, whose  
, power regulates the destiny of nations,  
t whose blessings have been so conspic­  
| uouslv dispensed to this rising repub­  
i lie, and to whom v e are bound to ad­  
dress our devout gratitude for the past,

WasaingToN-CiTy, MARCH 4. 1  
Mr. MADISON’s Inaugural  
SPEECH:  
- &amp;  
Delivered this day at 12 o&#x27;clock. 3  
UNWILLING to depart from  
examples of the most revered  
authority, I avail myfelf of the occa­  
sion now presented, to express the pro­  
found impreflion made on me, by the  
call of my country to the station, to  
the duties of which lam about to  
pledge myfelf, by the moR solemn of  
fan&amp;ions. So diftinguithed a mark of  
confidence proceeding from tie delib­  
erate and tranquil fuffrage of a free  
and virtnous nation, wowld underany  
circamflances, have commanded my  
gratitude and devotion, as well asfilled  
me with an awful sense of the trust to  
be afflumed. Underthevariouscircum­  
ftances which give peculiarfelemnity  
to the exifling period, I feel that both  
the honor and the refponfibilicy allot­  
ed to me, are inexpreflibly enhanced.  
~ The present situation of the world  
is indeed without a parallel, and that  
of our owa country full of difficulties,  
The preflure of these too, is the more  
severely felt, because hey_hx fa.ll!‘  
upen us at a momen‘swhe &#x27;mational  
prosperity being at a htight not before  
attained, the contralt resulting from  
the change, has been rendered the  
more Rriking. Under the benign in­  
fluaence of our republican institutions,  
and the maintenance of peace with all  
nations, whillt so many of them were  
engaged in bloody and wafteful wars,  
the fiuits ora jult policy were enjoyed  
it an worivalled growth of our facul­  
ties and reflources. Proofs of this  
were {een in the improvements of ag­  
riculture ; in the fuccefsful enterprizes  
of commerce ; in the progress of man­  
wfaltures and ufeful arts ; in the in­  
crease of the public revenue, and the  
ule-made of it in reducing the public  
debt ; and inthe valuable works and  
eitablithments every where multiply­  
tng over the face of our land. ,  
[t is a precious refleétion that the  
transition from this prosperous condi­  
tion of our country, to the {cene which  
has for some time been diftrefling us,  
1s net chargeable on any unwarranta­  
ble views, nor, as I traft, on any in­  
voluntary errors, in the public coun­  
cils. —lndulging no paflions which  
uelpafs on the rights or the repose of  
other nations, it has been the true glo­  
1y of the United States to culuivate  
peace by observing jultice, and to en­  
title themselves to the refpe&amp; of the  
nations at war, by fulfiiling their neu­  
tral obligations, with the most fcru.-  
pulous impartiality. If there be can­  
dor in the world, the truth of thefs af­  
dertions will not be questioned. Pos­  
terity at leaflt will do juitice to them.  
This unexceptionabie course could  
not avail against the injullice and vi­  
olence of the betligerent powers. In  
their rage againit each other, or im­  
peiled by more dire&amp; motives, princi­  
ples of setaliation have been introduc­  
ed, equally contrary to unniverfal rea­  
son and acknowledged law. How  
long their arbitrary ediéts, wiil be con­  
tinued &#x27;in {ptte of the demonstrations,  
that not even a pietext for them has  
been given by the United States, and  
-of the fair and liberal attempts to in­  
duce a revocation of them, cannot be  
.anticipated. Afluring myfelf that un­  
der. every viciflitade, the determined  
‘fpirit and united councils of the na­  
‘tion will be fafeguards.to its honor  
and -its essential interests, I repair to  
the post assigned me, with no cther  
discouragement than..what {prings  
‘from my own inadequacy-to its high  
duties. If Ido not fink under the  
weight of this deep conviion, itis  
&#x27;.-?ccaufe I find some support in a con­  
-{cioufnefs of the purposes, and a con­  
-fidence in the principles, which I  
‘bring with me into this arduous fer­  
vvice, .  
T&#x27;o cherish peace and friendly in­  
“tercourfe with all nations, having cor.  
respondent dispositions ; to maintain  
sincere neutrality towards belligerent |  
nations ; ro-prefer in all cases-amica­  
ble difcuflions, and reafenable accom- -  
modation of differences, to a decision  
of them by an appeal to arms ; toex. &#x27;  
clude “foreign intrigues and foreign  
partialities, {o degrading to all coua­  
tries, and {o baneful toifree ones:;-to  
folter a pirit of independence, too  
_ jul to iavade the rights&#x27;of others ; toa  
proud to surrender our own ; too lib.  
cral to indulge unworthy prejudices .  
ourf{zlves, and too clevated not to look  
dowas upon them in others ; to bold  
‘the.union of the Rates as the basis of  
abeir peace and happiness ; to support  
the coafliturion which is the cement  
of the union, as well in its limitations,  
as in its authorities ; to refpeét the  
rights and authorities reserved to the  
Staths and to the people, as equally  
incorporated with, and effantial toxl.ze  
dinecefs of the general {yfem, to avoid  
ghe slightest inteference with therights  
.of conscience, or the: fanﬁ-{&#x27;gbn&amp; of_!&#x27;f; ,  
kgion so wifely exempted :from civil  
wﬁmwwm  
  
tares ; to liberate the public resources  
by an honorable discharge of the pub­  
lic debts ; to keep within the requisite.  
limits a standing military force, al­  
ways remembering that an armed and  
trained militia is the firmeft hulwark  
of republics, that without standing ar­  
mies their liberty can never be in dan­  
ger 3 nor with large ones fafe ; to  
promote by authorized means im­  
provements friendly to agriculture,  
and to external as well as internal  
commerce, to favour, in like manner  
the advancement of ‘fcience and the  
diffufion of information, as the best  
aliment to true liberty ; to carry on  
the benevolent plans, which have been  
so meritoriously applied to the con­  
version of cur aboriginal neighbors  
from the degradation and wretched­  
ness of savage life, to a participation of  
the improvements of which the human  
mind and manners are susceptible in a  
civilized fiate. *As far as sentiments  
and intentions such as these can aid  
the fulfilment of my duty, they will be  
a resource which cannot fail me.  
  
It is my good fortune moreover to  
bave the path in-which I am to tread,  
lighted by examples of illultrious fer­  
_vicesy {ugcelsfully rendered in the molt  
&quot;ryi&amp;‘?ﬂﬁc{zlties by those who have  
marched before me. Of those of my  
immediate predeceflor, it might least  
become me hereto {peak—ll may how­  
ever be pardoned for not fupprefling  
the sympathy, with which my heart is  
full, in the rich reward he enjoys in  
the benedi&amp;ions of a beloved country,  
gratefully bestowed for exalted talents,  
zealouily devoted through a long ca­  
reer, to the advancement of its highest  
interelt and happiness - But the source  
to which I look for the aids, which  
alone can supply my deficiencies, is in  
the well tried intelligence and virtue  
of my fellow-citizens and in the coun­  
cils of those representing them in the  
other departments, aflociated in the  
care of the national interest. In thele  
my confidence will, under every difli­  
culty, be best placed ; next to that  
which we have all been encouraged to  
feel in the guardianship and guidance  
of that Almighty Being, whose pow­  
er regulates the destiny of nations—  
whofe bleflings have bezn so conspicu­  
ously dispensed to this rising #public,  
and to whom we are bound to addre(s  
our devout graritude for the palt, as  
well as our fervent supplications and  
belt hopes for the future.

has been rendered tbc- more stnking.  
Under the benign influence of our Re  
publican institution, and the maintainance  
f peace with ull nations, whilst so many  
of the in were engaged in bloody and  
wasteful wars, the iniits&#x27;of a just policy

It is a pi ecious reflection that the

of our country, to the scene which hat  
  
for some time been distressing us is not  
  
I charge able on any unwarrantable views  
i nor, I trust, on any involuntary errors,  
;in the public councils. Indulging no  
pass-lost, which trespass on tne rights,  
jor repose of other nations, it has been  
the true glory of the United btates to  
; cultivate peace, by observing justice ;  
land k entitle themselves to the respect

neutral obligations, with the must scru

will do justice to them  
This unexceptionable course could  
  
not avail against the injustice and vio  
lence of the belligerent powers. In their  
ra;e against eath other, or impelled by  
more direct motives, piinciples of retali­  
ation have been introduced, equally con­  
tra y to universal reason, and acknowl­  
edged law. How long their arbitrary  
edicts will be continued, i i spite of the  
demonstrations that not even a pretext  
for them has been given by the United  
States, and of the Lir and liberal attempt  
to induce a revocation of them, cannot  
be anticipated. Assuring myself, that  
under every vicUsituder the determined  
pirit and united councils of the nation  
will be safe guards to its honour and its  
eisential interests, I repair to the post  
a&#x27;ghed me, with no other discourage­

inadequacy to its high duties If I do  
  
not sii k under the weight of this det p

Unwilling to depart from examples of  
the most revered authority, [ avail my-  
self ef the occasion now presented, to ex-  
press the profound impression made on  
me, by the call of my country to the sta-  
tion, to the duties of which | am about to  
pledge myself, by the most solemn of  
saictions. So d.stinguished a mark of  
confidences proceeding from the deliber-  
ate and tranquil suffrages of a free and  
virtuous nation, would under any circum-  
stances, have commanded my gratitude  
and devotion, as well as filied. me with an  
awfui sense oj the trust to be assumed,—  
Under the various circumstances, which  
give peculiar solemnity to the existing  
period, F fee) that both the honor and the  
responsibility allotted to me are inexpres-  
sibly enhanced.  
  
‘Lhe present situation of the world is  
indeed without a parallel ; and that of our  
own country fall of difficulties. The  
pressure of these too, is the more severe-  
ly felt, because they have fallen upon us  
at a moment when the national prosperity  
being at a height not before attained, the  
  
contrast resulting from the change has  
Under  
  
the benign influence of our republican in-  
stitutions, and the maintenance of peace  
with all nations, whilst so many of them  
were engaged in bloody and wasteful wars,  
the fruits of a just policy were enjoyed,  
in an unrivalled growth of our faculties  
and resources. Proofs of this were seen  
in the improvements of agriculture, in the  
successful enterprizes of commerce ; in  
the progress of manufactures, ard useful  
arts; in the increase of the public reven-  
ue, and the use made of it in redueing the  
public debt—and in the valuable works  
and establishments, every where multiply-  
ing over the face of our land.  
  
It is a precious reflection that the tran-  
sition from this prosperous condition of  
our country, tothe scene which has for  
some time been distressing us, is not  
chargeable on any unwarrantable views,  
nor, aS 1 trust, on any involuntary errors  
in the public councils. Indylging no pas  
sions which trespass on the rights, or the  
repose of other nations, it has been the  
true glory of the United States to culti-  
vite peace, by observing justice; and to  
entitle themselves to the respect of the  
nations at war, by fulfilling their neutral  
obligations with the most scrupulous im-  
partiality. If there be candor in the  
world, the truth of these assertions will  
not be questioned. Posterity at least will  
do justice to them.  
  
This unexceptionable course could not  
avail against the injustice and violence of  
the belligerent powers. In their rage a-  
gainst each other, or impelled by more  
direct motives, principles of retaliation  
have*béer intreduced equally contrary to  
upiversal reason and acknowledged law  
How long their arbitrary edicts will be  
continued, in spite of the demenstrations,  
that not evea a pretext for them has been  
given by the United States, and of the  
fair and liberal attempts to induce a revo-  
cation of them, cannot be anticipaited.—  
Assuring myself that under every vicisi-  
tude, the determined spirit and united  
councils of the nation will be safe guards  
to its honor and its essential interests, |  
repair tothe post assigned me, with no  
other discouragement than what springs  
from my own inadequacy to its high du-  
ties. If i do not sink underthe weight o!  
this deep conviction, it is because ! find  
some support in a consciousness of the  
purposes, and a confidence in the princi-  
pies which | bring with me into. this ar-  
duous service.  
  
To cherish peace and fiiendly inter-  
course with al] nations having correspon-  
dent dispositions : to maintain sincere neu-  
trality towards belligerent nations: to pre-  
fer in all cases amicable discussion and  
reasonabic accommodation of differences,  
to a decision of them by an appeal to arms ;  
te exclude foreign intrigues and foreign  
partialitics, so degrading to all countries,  
and so baneful to free ones; to foster a  
spirit of independence, too just te invade  
  
  
  
the mgnts of others, toe proud to suiten-  
  
f der our own, too liberal to indulge unwor-  
thy prejudices ourselves, and too elevated  
not to look down them in others ;  
to hold the union of the&#x27;states as the ba-  
sis of their peace and happiness ; to sup-  
port the constitution, which is the cement  
of the union as well in&#x27;its limitations as in  
its authorities 5 to respect the rights and  
authorities reserved to the states and to  
the people, as equally incorporated with,  
and essential to the success of the gener-  
al system ; to avoid the slightest interfer-  
ence with the rights of conscience or the  
functions of religion, so wisely exempted  
from civil jurisdiction ; to preserve in their  
full energy the other salutary provisions  
in behalf of private and personal rights,  
and of the freedom of the press ; to observe  
economy in public expenditures; to lib-  
erate the public resources by an honora-  
ble discharge of the public debts; te keep  
within the requisite limits a standing mil-  
itary force, always remembering that an  
armed and trained militia, is the firmest  
bulwark of republics: that without stand-  
ing armies their liberty can never be in  
danger, nor, with large ones safe ; to pro-  
mote by author zed means improvements  
friendly to agriculture, to manufactures,  
and to external as well as internal com-  
merce ; to favor in like manner, the ad-  
vancement of sgience and the diffusion of.  
infor mation, as the best aliment to true lib-  
erty ; to carry on the benevolent plans  
which have been so meritoriously applied,  
to the conversion of our aboriginal neigh-  
bors from the degradation and wretched-  
ness of a savage life, to a participation of  
the improvements of which the human  
mind and manners are susceptible in a  
civilized state : as far as sentiments and  
intentions, such as these, can aid the ful-  
filments of my duty, they will bea re-  
source which cannot fail me.  
  
It is my good fortune, moreover, to have  
the path which I am to tread, lighted by  
examples of tilustrious services, success-  
fully rendered, in the most trying difficul-  
ties, by those who have marched before  
me. Ofthose of my immediate predeces-  
sor, it might least become me here to  
speak. I may, however, be pardoned for  
not suppressing the sympathy with whieh  
my heart is full, in the rich reward he en-  
joys in the benedietions of a beloved coun-  
try, gratefully bestowed for exalted talents,  
zcalously devoted, through a Jong career,  
to the advancement of its highest interest  
and happiness.  
  
But the source to which I look for the  
iid which alone can supply my deficien-

~-U~nwiLLing to depart from examples  
of the most revered autharity, I avail  
myself of the occasion now presented, to  
express the prolound impression made  
on me, by the call of my country 1o the  
station, to the duties ol which 1 am a­  
bout to pledge myself, by the most sol­  
emn of sanctigns. So distinguished a  
mark of confidence, procecding from the  
deliberate and tranquil suffrage of a Irce  
and vértuous nation, would under any  
circumstances have commanded my ‘grat­  
itude and devotion ; as well as filiked me  
with au awlul scose of the tiust to be  
assumed, Under the various circum­  
stances which give peculiar soleninity to  
the existing period. 1 ieel thut both the  
honour avd the responsibility allotied to  
me are inexpressiblp cnh:mgcd.  
The present situgtion of the world is  
indecd without a pﬁzﬁ s and that of our  
own country full &quot;of @ifficulties. The  
pressure of these (oo 1s the more severcly  
lelty because they have fillen upon us at  
a moment, when the national prosperity  
being at a height not belore attained, the  
contrast resulting from the change has  
heen rendered the morestiiking, Under  
the benign influence of ogr Rcpublican  
institutions, and the maint@oance of peace  
with all pations, whilst so many of them  
were engaged in bloody and wastefu!  
wars, the fruits of a just policy were en.  
joyed in an unrivalled growth of our fac.  
ulties and resources. Prools of this werc  
seen in the improvements of agriculwre ;  
n the SHECEFTUI veemprimeo  
merce ; in the progress of manulactunds  
and useful arts; in the increase of the  
publick revenue, &amp; the use made of it in  
reducing the publick debt ; and in the  
valuable works and establishments every  
whsrc multiplying over the face of our  
land.  
  
[t is a precious reflection that the tran.  
~sition from this wrosperous condition of  
our couniry, to gw scene which has for  
some tme been distressing us, is not  
chargeable on any unwarrantable views,  
nor as I trust,on any invaluntary errors,  
in the publick comncils, Indulging no  
’ passions which tresspass on the rights, or  
the repose of other nations, ithas been  
the true glory of the United States to  
“cultivate peace, by observing justice,and  
to entitle themsclves to the respect of the  
nations at war, by fulfilling their neutral  
obligations, with the most scrupulous  
impartiality. It there be candour in the  
world, the truth of these: assertions wil  
not be questioned ; posterity, at least,  
wil |do justice to them.  
This unexceptionable course could  
not avail against the injustice and vio­  
lence of the belligerent powers. In their  
rage against en(ﬁn other, or impelled by  
more dircct motives, principles of retalia­  
tiun have been introduced, equally con­  
trary to universal reason, &amp; acknowledg.  
ed law, How longtheir arbitrary edicts  
will be continued 1n spite of the demon.-  
strattons that not even a pretext for them  
has been given by the ‘jl’lith States,and  
of the fair and liberal attempt to induce  
a revocation of them, cannot be anticipa­  
ted. Assuring mysélf, that under every  
vicissitude, the determined spirit and  
united councils of the nation will be safe­  
guards to its honour and its essential in­  
terests, I répair to the post aw%:‘d me,  
with no other discouragement than what  
springs from my own inadur-cy to its  
high duties. If Tdo not sink under the  
weight of this deep conviction, it is be­  
cause I find some support in a conscious­  
ness of the purposes, and a confidence in  
the principles which I bring with me,in.  
o tg&#x27;s arduouns service.  
To cherisn peace and friendly inter­

Unwilling to depart from oxuiuplesuf the  
most revered authority, 1 avail myself of tiiw  
ocension now presented, to express the pro¬  
found impression made on me, by the call of  
my country to the station, to the duties of  
which 1 iiiii about to pledge myself, by tlio  
most solemn of sanctions. So distioguisiit&#x27;d  
a murk of conHdence proceeduig from the  
deliberate and tranquil suffrage of a free and  
virtuous nation, would, under any circiim-  
stances, have commanded my gratitude and  
devotion, as well ns fl||ed me wiUi an awful  
sense of the trust to he assumed. Under ibe  
various circumstances which give peculiar  
solemnity to the existing period, I feel that  
both the&#x27;honour aud liie responsibility al¬  
lotted to me are iticxpreBsibly enhanced.  
  
The present situation of the world it indeed  
without a parallel; nofl that of our couulry  
full of diliicuities. Tim pressure of these,  
too, is the mure severely felt, because tliry  
have fallen u|xm us at a moment when na¬  
tional prosperity beii\g at a height not before  
attained, the contrast resulting frpm ibia  
change has been reiidi’rcd the more stTiking.

iii^tiuutnrm.nnd th« mriintcnance of peace  
xWth all nations, wliilrit so nmny of them  
were enj^iged in bhxxiy and wasteful  
wars, the fruits of a just policy were en¬  
joyed in an iinrivulled j^rowth of our  
facultieti and resources. Proofs of tiiis  
were seen in the iinproveintMUs of u^ri-  
riiltuiv; in the successful enlcrprise of  
commeroe; in tlic |)n&gt;y;rcss of inauufac-  
tnn»s and usclul arts; in the increase of  
the public re%cnnc.H, and the use made  
of them ill reducing the puhlic ileht; and  
in the valuahie works and cstahlishments  
every where multiplying o\cr the face of  
our land.  
  
It U a precious reflection that the tran¬  
sition fixnn this prosperous condition of  
oar country, to the scene which has for  
some time been distressing us, is not  
cfmi*geahlc on any warmntahie views,  
nor, ns I trust, on any involuntary errors  
in the piihlir councils. Indulging no pas¬  
sions which trespass on the rights or the  
repose of other nations, it lias been the  
true glory of the United States to t ulii-  
vatcpeace by observing justice, and to  
entitle themselves to the roped of the  
nations at war, by fulfilling their neutml  
obligations with the most scrupulous im¬  
partiality*  
  
If tliere bo candour in the world, the  
truth of these assertions will not he ques¬  
tioned. Posterity at least w ill do justice  
to&#x27;tliein.  
  
^Uiis unexceptionable course could not  
•vail Hguinst the injustice and violence of  
|he belligerent powers. In their nige  
against eat h other, or impelled by more  
direct TiKitives, principles of retuliation  
have been introtiuced, equally contrary  
Co universal ictison and ackimwlcdged  
iaw. How long their urhitrary edicts  
writ he coiiiinued in spite of the detnon-  
vtratioiis, that not even a prt?text for  
rtieni has been given by the Unked States,  
and of the fair and liberal attempts to  
induce n revocation of them, cauiiot be  
antic:par4»d.  
  
Assuring myself that, under cVery vi¬  
cissitude the dcteniiiiicd spirit and united  
coimoils of the nation will be safe-guards  
to ks honour and its essential iuterests, 1

Otiier discoumgement than ivliat springs  
from mv own inadequacy to its high du-

of ropuhlics, that without standing armies  
their liberty can licver be in danger ; nor

Mahih 4, lHUtf.  
Unwilling to depart from example* of the u?o*t re­  
vered authority, 1 avail uiy*elf of the occa?lon now  
prr?cntrnl, to ttaprea* the prolound iuipie?*lon made  
od ma, by the call of my country to the station, to the  
duties of which 1 am about to pledge myself by the  
moat solemn of sanctions. So distinguished a mark  
of confidence, proceedrng from the deliberate and  
tranquil suffrage of a free and virtuoua nation, would,  
under any circumatancea, have commanded uiy ({rati  
tude and devotion, a* well an filled me with an awful  
Mnae of the1 truet to be assumed. Under the various  
circumstance* which give peculiar solemnity to ihe  
existing period, I feel that both the honor anu the re­  
sponsibility allotted to me are inexpressibly enhanced.  
The present cituation of the world is indeed with­  
out a parallel, and that of our own country full of  
difficulties. The pressure of lhe*e too is the more se­  
verely felt, because they have fallen upon us at a mo­  
ment when the national prusperity being at a height  
not before attained, the contrast resulting from the  
change, haa been tendered the more striking. Under  
the benign influence of our republican institutions,  
uid the maintenance of peace with all nations, whilst  
?o many of them were engaged in bloody and waste­  
ful wars, the fruita of a just policy were enjoyed in an  
unrivalled growth of our faculfe* and resource*.?  
Proof* of this were seen in the iiupruvements of agri­  
culture ; in the successful enterprise* of commerce; in  
the progress of manufactures and useful arta, in the  
increaae of the public revenue, and the use made of it  
in reducing the public debt; and in the valuable works  
and eatablikhments everywhere multiplying over the  
face of our land.  
1 It is a precious reflection lluit the transition from  
this prosperous condition of out country, to the scene  
which has for some time been distressing us, is not  
[ chargeable on any unwarrantable views, nor, as I  
trust, on any involuntary errots, in the public coun­  
cils. Indulging no passions which trespass on the  
rights or repose of otfier nations, it has been the true  
glory of the United Slates to cultivate peace by ob­  
serving justice ; and to entitle themselves to the re­  
spect of the nations at war, by fulfilling their neutral  
onllgtttions with the most scrupulous impartiality. If  
there be candor in the world, the truth of these asser­  
tions will not be questioned ; posterity, at least, will do  
justice to them.  
This unexceptionable course could not avail against  
the injustice and violence of the belligerent powers. In  
I their r*gu againxt cacti other, or impelled bv more di­  
rect motives, principles of retaliation have been intro­  
duced, equally contrary to universal reason and ac­  
knowledged law. How long their arbitrary edicts will  
be continued, in spite of the demonstration* that not  
even a pretext for them has been given by the United  
Slates, and of the fair and liberal attempt to induce a  
revocation of them cannot be anticipated. Assuring  
myself, that, under every vicissitude, the determined  
spirit and united councils of the nation will be safe­  
guards to it* honor and its essential interests, I repair  
to the po*t assigned me with no other discouragement  
than what springs from my own inadequacy to its high  
duties. If I do not sink under the weight of this deep  
conviction, it is because 1 find some support in a con­  
sciousness of the purposes, and a confidence in the  
principles, which I bring with me into this arduous  
service.  
To cherish pea~e and friendly intercourse with all  
nations having correspondent dispositions; to main­  
tain sincere neutrality towards belligerent nations ; to  
prefer in all cases amicable discussion and reasonable  
accommodation of difference*, to a decision of them by  
an appeal to arms; to exclude foreign intrigue* and  
foieign partialities, so degrading to all countries, and  
so baneful to free ones; to foster a spirit of indepen­  
dence, too just to invade the rights of others, too proud  
to surrender our own, too liberal to indulge unworthy  
piejudices ourselves, and too elevated not to look down  
upon them in others: to hold the union ot the states  
as the basis of their peace and happiness; to support  
the constitution, which is the cement of the union, as  
well in its limitations as in its autlioritie*; to respect  
the rights and authorities reserved to the slates and to  
the people, as equally incorporated with, and essential  
to the success of, the general system; to avoid the  
slightest interference with the rights of conscience or  
the functions of religion, so wisely exempted from ci­  
vil jurisdiction; to preserve, in their full energy, the  
&lt; other salutary provisions in behalf of private and per­  
j sonal rights, and of the freedom of the press; to ob­  
serve economy in public exjienditurcs ; to liberate the  
public resource* by an honorable discharge of the pub­  
lic debts ; to keep within the requisite limits a stand­  
ing military foice, always remembering that an arined  
and trained militia is the firmest bulwark of republics;  
that without standing armies their liberty can never be  
in danger, nor with large ones safe; to promote, by  
authorized means, improvements friendly to agricul­  
ture, to manufactures, and&#x27;to external a* well as inter­  
nal commerce; to favor, in like manner, the advance­  
ment of science and the diffusion of information as  
the best aliment of true liberty ; to oarry on the bene­  
volent plans which have been so meritoriously applied  
to the conversion of our aboriginal neighbors from the  
degradation and wretchedness of savage life, to a par­  
ticipation of the improvements of which the human  
mind and manner* 4re susceptible in a civilixed state:  
as far a* sentiments and intention* such a* these can  
aid Ihe tulDiment or my duiy, tney wilt l&gt;e a resource  
which cannot fail me.  
It is my good fortune, moreover, to have the path in  
which 1 am to tread lightened by example* of illustri­  
ous services, successfully rendered in the most trying  
difficulties, by those who have marched before ine.?  
Of those of my immediate predecessor it n.ight least  
become me hero to apeak. I may howevei, be pardon­  
ed for not suppressing the sympathy with which my  
heart is full, in the rich reward lie enjoys in the bene­  
dictions of a beloved country, gratefully bestowed for  
I exalted talents, zealously devoted, through a long ca­  
reer, to the advancement of its highest interest and  
happiness.  
But the source to which I look for the aids which  
alone can supply my deficiencies, is in the well tried  
intelligence and virtue of my fellow-citizens, and in  
the counsels of those representing them in the other  
departments associated in the care of the national in­  
terests. In these my confidence will under every  
difficulty be best placed, next to that which wc have  
all been encouiaged to feel in the guardianship and  
guidance of that Almighty Being whose power regu­  
lates the destiny of nations, whose blessing-i h,\?e been  
so conspicuously dispensed to this rising republic, and  
to whom we are bound to address our devout gratitude  
for the past, as well as our fervent supplications and

ison, March 4, 1809. Mark well his words: ‘ In-  
dulging no passions which trespass on the rights  
or the repose of other nations, it has been the  
true glory of the United States to cultivate  
peace by observing justice, and to entitle them-  
selves to the respect of the nations at war by  
fulfilling their neutral obligations with the most  
scrupulous impartiality. If there be candor in  
the world, the truth of these assertions will not  
be questioned. Posterity, at least, will do justice  
to them. * * * This unexceptionable course,  
however, could not avail against the injustice and  
violence of the belligerent powers. In their rage  
against each other, or impelled by more direct  
motives, principles of retaliation have been in-  
troduced, equally contrary to universal reason  
and acknowledged law. How long their arbitrary  
edicts will be continued in spite of the demonstra-  
tions that not even a pretext for them has been  
given by the United States, and of the fair  
and liberal attempts to induce a revocation of  
them, cannot be anticipated.’’
