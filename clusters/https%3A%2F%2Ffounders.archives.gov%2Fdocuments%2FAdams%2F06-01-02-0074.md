To the Honble. James Otis and Thomas Cushing Esqrs, Mr. Samuel Adams and John Hancock Esqr.  
Gentlemen.  
  
You have, once more received, the highest Testimony of the Confidence and Affection of your Constituents, which the Constitution has impowered them to exhibit; the Trust of representing them in the great and general Court or Assembly of this Province. This important Trust is committed to you, at a time when your Country demands the Exertion of all your Wisdom Fortitude and Virtue; and therefore it is presumed, a free Communication of our Sentiments, cannot but be agreable to you.  
1 The first object of your Attention, is the Priviledges of that Assembly of which you are now chosen to be Members. The Debates there must be free: You will therefore exert yourselves to remove every Thing that may carry the least Appearance of an Attempt, to awe or intimidate. As the Assembly is called to Sett in the usual Place, common Decency, as well as the Honour, and Dignity of a free legislative will require a Removal of those Cannon, and Guards, as well as that clamorous Parade which has been daily around the Court House, Since the Arrival of his Majestys Troops, and even at Sometimes while the highest Court of Judicature has been Sitting there on the Tryal of capital Causes.  
2 When this Grievance shall be removed, and the Debates of the Assembly shall be free, it will be natural to enquire into all the Grievances we have Suffered from the military Power: Why they have been quartered in the Body of this Town, in Contradiction to the express Words, and as we conceive the manifest Intention of an Act of Parliament: Why the officers who have thus violated our Rights, have not been called to account, and dealt with as the Law required: Whether the Measure taken by the Governor, in appointing an extraordinary officer to provide Quarters for the Troops, was not an Evasion of the Act of Parliament made for the billetting and quartering his Majestys Troops in America (the professed Rule of their Conduct) and designed to elude the Clause of said Act purposely providing for, the Convenience of American Subjects, And their Security against an Excess of military Power:  
3d. Why the repeated Offences and Violences committed by the Soldiery against the Peace and in open Defiance and Contempt of the civil Magistrate And the Law, have escaped Punishment in the Courts of Justice:  
4th. And whether the Attorney General has not, in Some late Instances unduly assumed, and exerted exercised a Power of entering “Nolle prosequi,” upon Indictments, without the Concurrence of the Court, in Obstruction to the Course of Justice and to the great Encouragement of Violence and Oppression.  
5 And as the Quartering Troops appears to be the grand Source of all these Evils, here has provd occasion of many evils we do earnestly recommend to you, to use your utmost Endeavours for a Speedy Removal of them , to Places where they may be really usefull and necessary.  
6 Should The Expence that has been incurred in the Transportation of these Troops hither, in providing Barracks for the troops and supplying them with Necessaries, has in our opinion been purposely great. A Reimbursement may possibly be required of the House of Representatives. Should this be the Case, We do, in the most solemn and express manner, enjoin you, upon no Consideration whatever to pay the least Regard to so unreasonable that you by no means comply with such a Requisition. If the general Court is a free assembly, no Power upon Earth has authority to compell it to pay this Money: if it is not free, Should it ever be deprived of its Freedom it shall never with our Consent be made an Engine to raise this Money from us. to drain us of our Treasure the little Money we have left.  
  
7 Another Object of great Consequence to this Province, Importance and which requires the early Attention of the Assembly is a daring flagrant Attack upon our Constitution of this Province an Attempt to deprive it us of the Blessings, derived from the Charter not only of our Charter Liberties privileges and Immunities, but the rights of British subjects derivd to us from the Constitution and the rights of Men derived to us from the laws and Nature of God and Nature. Copys of A Number of Letters, have been lately published, here, authenticated by the Clerk of the Papers, to the Honble House of Commons, which contain such Representations of and Reasonings, as it would not perhaps be prudent for us to characterise, in proper language. Misrepresentations so gross as to render it needless on this occasion, to make any particular Remarks.The Drift and ScopeThe dark Design of the Writer is sufficiently clear and apparent, and considering his station and that of the noble Personage to whom they were addressed, as Representative of the first personage in the Empire and the rank of the Minister to whom he addressed himself and the Attention that has been given to them in Great Britain, we apprehend them of very dangerous Tendency and Consequence they have produced Effects dangerous and alarming to both Countrys, and have a direct Tendency to produce yet greater. It is therefore expected, that you employ all your Influence your utmost Endeavors and all the Influence you may have that the injurious Impressions, which may unhappily have been made by them may be removed, and that an effectual Antidote may be administered before the Poison, shall have wrought the Ruin of our Constitution.  
  
  
8 It is unnecessary for Us at this Time, to repeat our well known Sentiments concerning the Revenue, which is continually, collecting from levyd upon Us, to our great Distress and for No other End than to support a great Number of very unnecessary Placemen and Pensioners. We have now only to add, that our Sentiments on this Subject are in no Respect changed, And that We expect you pursue with unabated Zeal, and unalterable Resolution firm Resolution and unremitted ardor every Measure that may tend to procure us Relief never yeilding the least your Consent to or Connivance, at any the least Encroachments on our Rights. Next to the Revenue itself, the late Extensions of the Jurisdiction of the Admiralty, are our greatest Grievance. The American Courts of Admiralty Seem to be forming by Degrees, into a System, that is to overturn our Constitution; and to deprive us entirely of our best Inheritance, the Law of the Land. It would be thought in England, a dangerous Innovation if the Tryal of any Matter upon Land, was given to the Admiral. It would be thought more threatning still, if the Power of Confiscation, over Ships and Cargoes for illicit Trade, was committed to that Court: But if the Forfeitures of Ships and Cargoes, large Penalties upon Masters, and such exorbitant Penalties as the Treble Value of Cargoes, upon every Person concerned in Landing uncustomed goods, were by Act of Parliament appointed to be tryed by the Admiral, the Nation would think their Liberties irrecoverably lost.  
This, however is the miserable Case of North America! In the 41.ss. of the Statute of the 4th. of Geo. 3. c. 15. We find that “all the Forfeitures and Penalties, inflicted by this, or any other Act of Parliament, relating to the Trade and Revenues of the British Colonies or Plantations in America, which shall be incurred there, may be prosecuted, sued for and recovered in any Court of Admiralty, in the said Colonies”. Thus, these extraordinary Penalties and Forfeitures, are to be heard and tryed not by a Jury—not by the Law of the Land—but by the civil Law and a single Judge! Unlike the ancient Barons, who answered with one Voice “We will not that the Laws of England be changed, which of old have been used and approved,” the Barons of modern Times, seem to have answered, that they are willing, those Laws should be changed, with Regard to America, in the most tender Point, and fundamental Principle!  
9 And this hardship is the more severe as we see in the same Page of the statute, and the section immediately preceding, “that all Penalties and Forfeitures, which shall be incurred in Great Britain, shall be prosecuted, sued for, and recovered, in any of his Majestys Courts of Record in Westminster, or in the Court of Exchequer in Scotland respectively.” Here is a Contrast that stares Us, in the Face! an unjust A partial Distinction that is made between the subject in Great Britain, and the subject in America! The Parliament in one section, guarding the People of the Realm, and securing to them, the Benefit of a Tryal by Jury and the Law of the Land, and by the next section depriving Americans of those important Rights. Is not this Distinction a Brand of Disgrace upon every American? a Degradation, below the Rank of an Englishman? Is it not, with respect to Us, a Repeal of the 29. Chapter of Magna Charta? “No Freeman shall be taken or imprisoned or disseised of his Freehold, or Liberties, or free Customs, or outlawed or exiled, or any otherwise destroyed, nor will we pass upon him, nor condemn him, but lay lawful Judgment of his Peers, or the Law of the Land.” Englishmen are inviolably attached to the important Right expressed in this Clause which for many Centuries has been the noblest Monument, and firmest Bulwark of their Liberties. One Proof of this Attachment, given Us, by a great Sage of the Law, we think proper to mention, not for your Information, but as the best Expression of the Sense of your Constituents. “Against this ancient and fundamental Law, and in the Face thereof, says Lord Coke I find an Act of Parliament made, that as well Justices of Assize, as Justices of Peace, without any finding or Presentment of twelve Men, upon a bare Information for the King before them made, should have full Power and Authority, by their Discretions, to hear and try Men,” for Penalties and Forfeitures.” His Lordship, after mentioning the Repeal of this Statute, and the Fate of Empson and Dudley, who received the full Weight of the national Vengeance for acting under it, concludes with a Reflection which, if well considered, might be sufficient to discourage such attacks upon fundamental Principles. “The ill success of this statute and the fearfull End of these two oppressors, should deter others from committing the like, and should admonish Parliaments, that instead of this ordinary and precious Tryal by the Law of the Land, they bring not in absolute and partial Tryals by Discretion.” Such are the Feelings and Reflections of an Englishman upon a statute, very like not unlike the statute now under Consideration, and upon Courts and Judges, very like not unlike the Courts and Judges of Admiralty, in America.  
The formidable Power of these Courts, and their distressing Course of Proceedings, have been Severely felt within the past Year, many of your fellow Citizens having been worn out with Attendance upon them, in Defence against Informations for extravagant and enormous Penalties. And we have the highest Reason to fear from past Experience that if no Relief is granted obtained for us, the Properties and Liberties, and the Morals too, of this unhappy Country, will be ruined, by these Courts, and the Persons employed to support them.  
We therefore earnestly recommend to you, by every legal Measure to endeavor that the Power of these Courts may be confined to their proper Element, according to the ancient English Statutes, and that you petition and remonstrate against the late Extensions of their Jurisdiction: And we doubt not, the other Colonies and Provinces, who begin to Suffer, with us, under them, will chearfully harmonise with you this, in any justifiable Measures that may be taken for Redress.  
10 We need not here take occasion to instruct you That while you in the most ample manner testify your loyalty to our gracious Sovereign you strenuously assert and maintain, the Right of the subject jointly or severally to Petition the King; or to declare it as our clear opinion, that the House of Representatives in any one Province, has an undeniable Right, whenever a just occasion shall offer, to communicate their Sentiments upon a common Concern, to the Assemblys of any or all the other Colonies and to unite with them in humble, dutifull and loyal Petitions for Redress of a general Grievance

To the Honorable Yam:s Oti dT}  
SR : James Otis, an womas  
Culbing, E/g&#x27;rs. Mr. Samuel Adams, and  
. fohn Hancock, Ejy;  
GENTLEMEN, ~ ° , i e  
OU have once more received the highest Testimony of  
the Confidence &amp; Atfection of your Contituents, which  
: the Constitution has impowered them to exhibit : The  
» . ‘Triift of representing theyn in the Gret and General  
Court or Assembly of this Province, Thic important Trust is  
committed to you, at a Time when your Country d=mands theEx­  
ertion of all your Wisdom, Fortitude, and Virtue : and therefore  
1t is presumed, a free Communication of our Stutiments, cannot  
but be agreeable to you, . . fi b  
. The firft Objeét of your Attention is the Privilege of that As­  
sembly of which you are now chosen to be Members, The Debates  
there must be free : You will therefore exert yourfclves so remove  
every Thing that miay carry the least Appearance of an Attempt to  
awe or intimidate. Asthé Assembly is called to set in the usual  
Place, commion Decency, as well s the Honor and Dignity of a  
free Legislative, will require a Removal of those Cannon and  
Guards, as well as that clamorous Paradz.. which- has been daily  
around the Court-House since the Arrival of His Majefty’sTroops ;  
and at some Times while the highest Court of Judicature has Leen  
flttgng there on the Trial even of Capital Ciufes.. When this  
erevanfe f’n’all be removed, and the Debates of the Aficmbly shall  
be free, it will be natural to enquire into all the Grievances we  
have fuffered from the military Power : Why they have been  
‘quartered in the Body of this Town,in Contradi&amp;icn to the express  
Words, and as we conceive, the manifeft Intention of an A&amp; of  
Parliament i Why the Officers who have thus violated ourßights,  
have not been called to Account, &amp; dealt with as the Law required :  
Whether the Measure taken by the Governor of the Province, in  
appointing an extraordinary. Officer to privide Quarters for the  
Troops, was notan Evasion of the A&amp; of Parliament made for the  
Billeting and Quartering hi: Majesty’s ‘Troops in America (the pro­  
feffcd Rule of iheir Condudt ) and designed to clude the Clause of  
said A¢t purposely providing for the Convenience es American Sub­  
je€ls, and their Security against an Excess of military Power : Wihy  
the repeated Offences and Violences committed by the Soldiery,  
against the Peace, and in open Defiance and Contempt of the Civil  
Magistrate and the Law, have escaped Punishment in the Courts  
of Justice : And whether the Attorney-General hag not, in some  
late Instances, unduly exercised a Power of entering ¢ Nolle pro­  
fequi,” upon Indi&amp;ments, without the Concurrence of the Court,  
in Obstruction to the Conrfe of Justice, and to the great Encour­  
agement of Violence and Opprefiion. et  
And as the Quartering Troops here has proved the occasion of  
many Evils, we do earnestly recommend to you, te use your ut­  
most Endeavours for a speedy Removal of them.  
Should the Expence that has been incurred in providing Bar­  
racks for the Troops, and fupslying them with Ncteffaries, be re­  
quired of the House of Representatives, we do in the most solemn  
and express Manner enjoin you, by no Means to comply with {uch  
a Requisition, If the General Court is a free Aflembly, no Power  
upon Earth has Authority to compel it to pay this Money : Should  
it ever be deprived of its Freedom, it shall never, with our Consent,  
be made an Engine to drain us of the little Money we have left.  
_ Another Objeé of great Importance, and which requires your  
earlicft Attention, is a late Flagrant and formal Attack upon the  
Conititution itfelf + An Attempt, not only to deprive us of the  
Liberties, Privileges 2nd Immunities of our Chaiter, but the Rights  
of Britith Subjeéts. We have seen Copies of Letters published here,  
authenticated by the Clerk, of the Papers to the Horforable House  
of Commons, the Contents of which must have awakencd the  
Jealousy of the Country---the Design of the Writer i¢ fufficiently  
apparent : And, copfidering his Station, as Representative of the  
firft Personage in the Empire; and the Rank of the Minifler to  
whom he addressed himfclf, we cannot. wonder that Credit has  
Been given to his Letters in Great-Britain, and that they have al­  
ready produced Eflects alarming to the Colonies, and dangerous to  
both Ccuntries, Tt is therefore expelted that you use the whole  
Induence yon may have, that the injurious Impressions which they  
have unbappily made, may be removed.and that an effettual Anti­  
dote may be adminiftred, before the Poison shall have wrought the  
Ruin of the Conflitution. . o LGS e  
It is unncceflary for us at this Time, to repeat our well known  
Sent!ments concerning the Revenue, which is continually levied  
rpon us, to our great Distress, and for no other End than to support a  
great Number of very unneceflary Placemen and Pensioners. ..We  
bave only to add, that our Sentiments on this Subject are in no  
Refpedt changed 3 and we expect that you pursue vith firm Re­  
solution and unremitted Ardor, every Measure that may tend to  
procure us Relief 5 never yielding your €onfent o, or Connivance  
at the least Encroachment on oyr Rights. : ¥  
Next to the Revenuc itfelf, the late Extensions of the Jurisdic­  
tion of the Admiralty, are our greatest Grievance. The American  
Courts of Admiralty seem to be forming by Degrees into a System,  
that is to overturn our Constitution, and to deprive us entirely of  
our heft Inheritance, the Law of the Land. It would be thought  
in England, a dangeyous Innovation, if the Trial of any Matter  
upon Land was given to the Admiral : It would be thought  
sore threatning still, if the Power of CONFIS CATION,  
over Ships and Cargoes, for illicit Trade, was committed to that  
Court : But if the Forfeitures of Ships and Cargoes, large Penal­  
ties upon Masers, and, such exorbitant Penaltics as the Treble  
Walue of Cargocs, upon every Person conccmcq in Landing l.lncuf­  
fomed Goods, were by A&amp; of Parliament appf)xnte:_d to be tried by  
the Admiral, the Nation would think their Libertics irrecoverably

This, however is the miserable Case of North- Argerica ! in the  
41 S of the Statute of the 4th of GEQRGE ]ll. cbap. 15. we find  
that «¢ all the Forfeitures and Penalties, inflicted by this, or any  
¢« other A&amp; of Parliament, relating to tie Trade and Revenues of  
¢« the Britith Colonies or Plantatiors in America, which shall be

tender Point, and fundamental Principle ! _ iy  
And this Hardship is the more severe, as we fee in the fame  
Page of the Statute, and the Se&amp;tion immediately preeeding ¢ That  
all Penaities and Forfeitures, whicl shall be incurred in Great-  
Britain, shall be prosecuted, sued for, and recovered, in any of his  
Majetty’s Courts of Record in Weftmindter, or in the Court of Ex­  
chequer in Scotland refpeétively.” Here 1s a Contrast that stares  
us in the Face ! A partial Diftintion that is m#de between the  
Subje€t in Great-Britain, and the Subjeét in America ! ‘The Par­  
liament in one Sc&amp;ion, guarding th: People of the Realm, and  
securing to them the Benefit of a Trial by Jury, and the Law of  
the Land, and by the next Seétion depriving Americans of those  
important Rights. Is not this Di%inftion a Brand of Disgrace  
upon every. AMERICAN ? a Degmdation below the Rank of an  
ENGLISHMAN ? Is it not, with refpet to ug, a Repeal of  
the 2gth Chapter of MAGNA CHARTA ? ¢ No Freeman shall

¢ or free Customs, or outlawed, or exiled, or any otherwise defttoy­

are inviolably attached to the important Right expressed in this  
Clause, which for many Centuries has been the noblest Monument,  
and firmeft Bulwark of their Liberties. One Proof of this At­  
tichment, given us by a great Sage of the Law. #e think proper to  
mention, not for your Information, but as the best Expreflion of  
the Sense of your Constituents, ¢ Against this ancient and funda­  
“ mental Law, and in the Face thercof, fays Lord Coke, I find  
“an A&amp; of Parliament made, tha: as well fuftices of Assize, as

¢ Men, upon a bare Informetion for the King before them made,  
“ should have full Power and Authority, by their Discretions, to  
¢ hear and try Men, for Penalties and Forfzitures.,”” His Lordship  
after mentioning the Repeal of this Statute, and the Fate of Emp­  
fon and Dudley, who received the full Weight of the national  
Vengeanee for a&amp;ting under it, concludes with a Refle€tion; which  
if well considered, might be fufficient to discourage such Attacks  
upon fundamental Principles, ¢ The iil Success of this Statute,  
¢ and the fearful End of these two Opprefiors, should deter others  
¢ from contmitting the like, and should admonish Parliaments,that  
¢ instead of this ordinary and precious Trial by the Law of the  
¢ Land, they bring not in absolute &amp; partial Trials by Discretion.”  
Such arc the Feelings and Refle€tions of an Englithman, upon 3  
Statute, not uplike the Statute now under Conﬁdera:ion, and upon  
Courts and Judges not unlike the Courts and Judges of Admiralty  
in America. ; e  
- The formidable Power of these Courts, and their diftrefling  
Course of Proceedings, have been fevercly felt within the Year  
past ; many of your Fellow Citizens having been .worn out with  
Attendance upon them, in Defence against Informations fqr ex­  
travagant and enormous Penalties, And we have the highest  
Reason to fear frem past Experience, that if no Relief is obtained  
for us, the Properties and Libertics, of this unhappy Country, and  
its Morals too, will be ruined by these Courts, and the Persons em­  
ployed to support them. :  
We therefore earnestly recommend to you, by every legal Mea­  
sure, to endeavour that the Power of these Courts may be confined  
to their proper Element, according to the antient English Statutes;  
and that you petition and remonfirate against the late Elxtenfzons of  
their Jm‘ifdi&amp;ions : And we doubt not, the other Colonies and  
Provinces, who fufier with us, under them, will chearfully har­  
monize with this, in any juftifiable Measures that may be taken  
for Redress., :  
We necd not here take Occasion to infiruét you, That while you  
in the most ample Manner teftify your Loyalty to our Gracious  
‘Sovereign, you strenuously assert and maintain the Right of the  
Subjeét, jointly or severally to Petition the King j or to declare 1t  
as our clear Opinion,that the House of Representatives in any one  
Province, has an undeniable Right, whenever » just Occasion shall  
offer, to communicate their Sentiments_upon a common Concern,  
to the Assemblies of any or all the other Colonies, and to unite  
with them in humble, dutiful and loyal Petitions for Redress of a  
general Grievance

that may carry the leaft appearance  
of an attempt to awe or i intimidate.  
As the alfembly is called to fet ij in

as well asthe honour and dignity of

and defigned to elude the claufe of  
faid act purpofely providing for the  
convenience of American {fubjects,  
and their fecurity againft an_excefs  
of milatary power: why the se-  
peated offencés and violences com-  
mitted by the foldiery, againft the  
‘peace, and in open Po se and  
contempt of the~ civil ~magiftrate  
and the law, have efcaped punifh-  
ment in the courts of juftice: And  
whether the attorney-general has  
not, in fome late initances,. unduly  
exercifed. a power of entering  
“* Nolle profequi,” upon indic-  
ments, without the concurrence of  
the court, in obftruction to the  
courfe of juftice, and to the great  
encouragement of violence and op-  
preflion. |  
  
_ And as the quartering troops  
here has proved the occafion of  
many evils, we do earneftly re-  
commend to you to ufe your utmoft  
endeavours for a {peedy removal of  
them.  
  
Should the expence that has been  
incurred in providing barracks for  
the troops, and fupplying them  
with neceflaries, be required of the  
houfe of reprefentatives, we do in  
the moft folemn andexprefs manner  
enjoin you, by_no méans to com-  
ply with fuch a requifition. If the  
general court is a free aflembly, no  
power upon earth has: authority to  
compel it to pay thismoney~ Should  
it ever be deprived of its freedom,  
it fhall never, with our confent, be  
made an engine to drain us of the  
a little money we have left. &#x27;  
_ Another object of great import-  
ance, and which requires your ear-  
lieft attention, is a late fragrantand  
formal attack upon the conftitution  
idelf: An attempt, not only to de-  
prive us of the liberties, pariMage&gt;  
and immunities of our charter, but  
  
the io of Britifh fubje&amp;s. - We  
have {een copies of jetters publifhed  
  
here, authenticated by the clerk of  
  
the papers to the honoarable Houfe  
of Commons, the contents of which  
mutt have awakened the jealoufy of  
the country--the defign of the writer  
is fufficiently apparent: And confi-  
dering his flation, as. reprefeata-  
tive of the firft perfonage in the  
empire, and the rank of the minif-  
ter to whom he addreffed -himfelf,  
we cannot wonder that credit has  
been given to his letters in Great-  
Britain, and that they have already  
  
rodaced effects alarming to the co-  
onies, and dangerous to both  
countries.. It is therefore expect-  
ed that you ufe the whole influence  
you may have, that the injurious  
impreffions which they have un-  
happily. made, may be removed,  
and that an effectual antidote may  
be adminiftred, before the poifon  
fhall have wrought the ruin of the  
conftitution.  
  
It is unneceflary for us. at this  
time, to repeat our well known  
fentiments concerning the revenue,  
which iscontinually ‘evied upon us,  
to our great diftrefs, and for no  
other aud than to fupport a number  
of very unneceflary placemen and  
penfioners. We have only to add,  
that our fentiments.on this fubjeé  
are in no refpect changed ;“and we  
expect that you purfue with firm res  
folution and’. unremitted ardor,  
every meafure that may tend to  
procure us relief; never yielding  
your confent to, or connivance: at  
the leaft encroachment on our  
rights. ! &#x27;  
  
Next to the revenue itfelf,: the  
late extenfions of the jurifdidtion of  
the admiralty, are our ~ greateit  
grievance. The American courts  
of admiralty feem to be ferming by  
degrees into a fyftem, that is to  
overturn our conflitution, and to  
deprive us entirely of our beft in-  
heritance, the law of the land. It

dangerous innovation, if the 2
