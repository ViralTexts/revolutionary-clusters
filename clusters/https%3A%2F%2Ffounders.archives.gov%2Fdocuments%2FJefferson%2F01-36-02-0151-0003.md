Sir,  
[1 Jan. 1802]  
  
Notwithstanding we live remote from the seat of the national government, and in an extreme part of our own state; yet we humbly claim the right of judging for ourselves.  
Our attachment to the national constitution is strong and indissoluble. We consider it a description of those powers, which the people have submitted to their magistrates, to be exercised for definite purposes, and not a charter of favors, granted by a sovereign to his subjects.—Among its beautiful features, the right of free suffrage, to correct all abuses—The prohibition of religious tests, to prevent all hierarchy—The means of amendment, which it contains within itself, to remove defects as fast as they are discovered, appear the most prominent. But for several years past, our apprehension has been, that the genius of the government was not attended to in sundry cases; and that the administration bordered upon monarchy: Our joy, of course must have been great, on your election to the first office in the nation; having had good evidence, from your announced sentiments and uniform conduct that it would be your strife and glory to turn back the government, to its virgin purity. The trust is great! The task is arduous! But we console ourselves, that the supreme ruler of the universe, who raises up men to achieve great events, has raised up a Jefferson for this critical day, to defend republicanism and baffle all the arts of aristocracy.  
Sir, we have attempted to prove our love to our president, not in words alone, but in deeds and truth. With this address, we send you a CHEESE, by the hands of Messrs. John Leland and Darius Brown, as a pepper-corn of the esteem which we bear to our chief magistrate, and as a sacrifice to republicanism. It is not the last stone in the Bastile, nor is it of any great consequence as an article of worth; but as a free-will offering, we hope it will be received. The cheese was not made by his lordship, for his sacred majesty; nor with a view to gain dignified titles or lucrative offices; but by the personal labour of free-born farmers (without a single slave to assist) for an elective president of a free people—with the only view of casting a mite into the scale of democracy.  
The late triumphant return of republicanism has more animated the inhabitants of Cheshire, to bear the burthens of government, and treat the characters and persons of those in authority with all due respect, than the long list of alien—sedition—naval, and provisional army laws, ever did.  
Sir, we had some thoughts of impressing some significant inscription on the cheese; but we have found such inconveniency in STAMPS on paper, that we chose to send it in a plain republican form.  
May God long preserve your life and health, for a blessing to the United States, and the world at large.

hen. ‘  
| . MONDAY, JAN. 18.  
Petitlons from hatters axt Wilming­  
ton, Del, and New-York, fßr an in­  
crease of the duty on imported Hats,  
were presented and committed.  
A refolution,calling for a statement  
‘of the expenses of colle&amp;ting the inter­  
nal revenue, was laid on the table.  
Some progress was made in the bill  
for fixing the military efablifhment,  
  
THE CHESHIRE PRESENT.  
The following address of the inbabitants  
of the ton of Chefbire, accompanied  
the Cheese, which was presented the 1/}  
of Fanuary, to the President.  
“ THE GREATEST CHEESE lIN AME­  
RICA—FOR THE GREATEST Max  
IN AMERICA.  
¢« SIR,  
NOTWITHSTANDING welive  
‘remote from the feat of national - go­  
‘vernment, and in an extreme part of  
‘our own State, yet we humbly claim  
the right of judging for ourselves.  
Our attachment to the National  
Confitution is strong and indissoluble.  
‘We confider it a defeription of those  
Powers which the people have sub­  
mitted to their Magistrates, to be ex­  
ercised for definite purposes, and not a  
charter of favors granted by a sove­  
reign to his fubjeéts. Among its beau­  
tiful features, the right of free fuf­  
frage, to corre&amp; all abuses—The pro­  
hibition of religious tests, to prevent all  
hierarchy—The means ofamendment,  
which it contains within itfelf to re­  
move defes as faft as they are discov­  
ered, appear the most prominent. But  
for several years past our apprehen­  
sion has been, that the genius of the  
government was not attended to in  
ndry cases ; and that the adminis­  
tration bordered upon monatchy :  
Our joy, of course, must have been  
great, on your ele&amp;ion to the firft of­  
fice in the ngtion. Having had good  
evidence, from your announced senti­  
ments and unlform condufty that it  
would be your firife and glory to  
turn back the government, to its vir­  
gin purity. The trul is great ! The  
tatk is arduous ! But we console our­  
selves, that the Supreme Ruler of the  
Universe, who raises up men to at­  
chieve great events, has raised up a  
JEFFERSON for this ¢ritical day, to  
defend Republicanism and baffle all  
the arts of Aristocracy.  
Sir, we have attempted to prove  
our love to our President, not in words  
alone, but in deed and truth. With  
this address, we fend youa CHEESE,  
by the hands of Meflrs. John Leland  
and Darius Brown, as a pepper-corn  
of the esteem which we bear to our  
Chief Magiltrate, and as a facrifice to  
Républicanifm, Itis not the last stone  
in the Baftile, nor is it of any great  
consequence as an article of worth ;  
but, as a free-will offering, we hope it  
will be received. The Cheese was  
not made by his Lordship, for his sac­  
red Majesty ; not with a view to gain  
dignified titles or lucrative offices ;-  
but by the personal labor of freeborn  
farmers (without a single slave to af­  
fit) for an ele®tive President of a free  
people ; with the only view of casting  
a mite into the scale of Democtacy.  
The late triumphant return of re­  
publicanifim has more animated the  
inhabitants of Cheshire, to bear.the  
burthens of government, and treat  
chara&amp;ers and persons of those in au­  
‘thority with all due refpe&amp;, than the  
long lit of alien—{edition—naval and  
_pravifional axm% dws ever did. ©~  
Sir, we had some thoughts of im­  
prefling some fighificant infcﬁpii&amp; on’  
‘the Cheese 3 but we have found fu¢h:  
inconveniericy.in famps on -paper,’  
that we choose tofend it in a plain Reé­  
publican form. = - ° 3l
