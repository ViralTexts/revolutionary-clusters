‘That the prospect before us is, as you justly observe, fair,  
none can deny ; but what use we shall make of it is exceedingly  
problematical ; not but that I believe all things will come right at  
last ; but like a young heir, come a little prematurely into a large  
inheritance, we shall wanton and run riot, until we have brought  
our reputation to the brink of ruin, and then like him shall have  
to labor with the current of opinion when compelled, perhaps, to  
do what prudence and common policy pointed out in the first in-  
  
stance, as plainly as any problem in Euclid.  
The disinclination of the individual states to yield competent  
  
powers to Congress for the Federal Government, their unreason-  
  
able jealousy of that body, and of one another, and the disposition  
which seems to pervade each, of being allwise and allpowerful  
within itself, will, if there is not a change in the system, be our  
downfall as a nation. This is as clear to me as the A, B, C, and  
{ think we have opposed Great Britain, and have arrived at the  
present state of peace and independency to very little purpose, if  
we cannot conquer our own prejudices. ‘The powers of Europe  
begin to see this, and our newly acquired friends, the British, are  
already professedly acting upon this ground ; and wisely too, if  
we are determined to persevere in our folly. They know that  
individual opposition to their measures is futile, and boast that we  
are not sufficiently united as a nation to give a general one! Is  
not the indignity alone of this declaration, while we are in the

260 Conventions for Adopting the [ Oct.  
  
  
  
us to vest more extensive and adequate powers in the Sovereign of  
these United States ?  
  
For my own part, although I am returned to, and am now  
mingled with the class of private citizens, and like them must  
suffer all the evils of a tyranny, or of too great an extension of  
federal powers, I have no fears arising from this source in my  
mind ; but I have many and powerful ones, indeed, which predict  
the worst consequences from a half starved, limping government,  
that appears to be always moving upon crutches, and tottering at  
every step. Men, chosen as the delegates in Congress are, can-  
not officially be dangerous; they depend upon the breath, nay,  
they are so much the creatures of the people, under the present  
constitution, that they can have no views, which could possibly  
be carried into execution, nor any interests, distinct from those  
of their constituents. My political creed therefore is, to be wise  
in the choice of delegates, support them like gentlemen while  
they are our representatives, give them competent powers for all  
federal purposes, support them in the due exercise thereof, and,  
lastly, to compel them to close attendance in Congress during  
their delegation. ‘These things, under the present mode of elec-  
tions and termination of them, aided by annual, instead of con-  
stant sessions, would, or [ am exceedingly mistaken, make us one  
  
of the most wealthy, happy, respectable, and powerful nations,  
  
that ever inhabited the terrestrial globe ; without them, we shall  
in my opinion, soon be everything which is the direct reverse  
of it.
