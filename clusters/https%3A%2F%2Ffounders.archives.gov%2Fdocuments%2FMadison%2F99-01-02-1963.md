					I avail myself of the opportunity afforded by Mr. Biddle to communicate to you a copy of a correspondence, and the substance of a conference, between Mr. Canning and myself relative to the late aggression on the peace and sovereignty of the U. States, by  
						the British Ship Leopard in an attack on the Chesapeak frigate off the Capes of Virginia.  
					Mr. Canning’s private letter of July 25. which gave the first intelligence of the occurrence left it doubtful whether the British officers had been culpable in it, and as I knew how very reprehensible their conduct had been on our coast on many other  
						occasions, and to what height the sensibility of our citizens had been excited by it, I thought it not improbable that something might have occurred to divide the blame between them. It was under that impression that my ansr. was written. On the next day the leading features  
						of the transaction were presented to the public thro’ the medium of the gazettes which were taken from private accounts received directly from Halifax by a vessel which had been dispatched by Adm. Berkeley with the official one. By these it was evident that the British  
						officer was completely the aggressor, in an outrage of great enormity, attended with circumstances which encreased the offence. It was understood likewise from good authority that the official intelligence which the govrt. had received corresponded with and confirmed the  
						other accts. already before the public.  
					On full consideration of these circumstances I concluded that it would be highly improper for me to leave the Affair on the ground on which Mr. Canning had placed it. I Could see no other motive in him to obtain further information relative to the  
						transaction than for the purpose of ascertaining whether the men said to be deserters and for whom the attack was made, were American Citizens or British Subjects, to which it was impossible for me to give any countenance. I thought it indispensible therefore to call on the  
						govrt. to disavow the principle and to engage such other reparation to the U. States, as their injured honor obviously required. It appeared to me that any delay in taking such a step which depended on an abstract principle, and required no argument to illustrate or facts to  
						support it, would have a tendency to weaken a claim which was unquestionable and to Countenance the idea that it would not be supported with suitable energy.  
					I had, before the knowledge of this event, obtained the appointment of an interview with Mr. Canning on other business to take place on the 29. Ulto:. We met according to the appointment. I observed in opening the conference that altho’ the topics which had  
						brought us together were important, the late occurrence at the entrance of the Chesapeak had in a great measure put them out of sight. He expressed his regret that such an event which would at all times furnish cause of concern should have happened at the present time. He  
						asked if the men in question were American Citizens or British Subjects? I replied that that was a point which could not come into view in the Case: that it was one which according as the fact might be would make the cause more or less popular in either country, but could not  
						affect the principle: that on principle a ship of war protected all the people on board, and could not be entered to be searched for deserters, or for any purpose, without violating the sovereignty of the nation whose flag she bore: that in the present case I had been assured  
						that the men were American Citizens, and the British Minister at Washington had been made acquainted with it. He said little on the subject, but by the tendency of what he did say, he seemed to imply that his govrt. could not lose sight of the consideration above alluded to,  
						nor indeed did he admit by any thing that escaped him that the abstract principle itself would not be insisted on. His remarks however were generally of a conciliatory and friendly character. Without pledging himself on any point he seemed desirous to satisfy me that no new  
						orders had been issued by the present ministry to the commandant of the British squadron at Halifax. I observed that as the notes which had passed between us were informal, and on a very limited view of the subject on my part, it would be proper for me, now that the  
						circumstances were better known, to present him an official note on it. He admitted the propriety of it.  
					I then drew Mr. Canning’s attention to the subjects on which I asked the interview; being the case of the Impétueux, Captain Love’s correspondence, the conduct of Captain Douglas, and of the British squadron generally on our coast. I observed that I had  
						heretofore postponed any official communication on these points from a desire to connect them with the greater object depending between our governmts., and of course from motives the most friendly: that I brought them to his view at this time it was in consequence of Mr.  
						Pinkney and myself having commenced the other business as he knew had been done. He promised to attend to them.  
					On the 29. of July I wrote Mr. Canning the note which I had promised him in the late interview. I addressed it in terms which I thought suitable to the occasion, observing to state in it that I took the step from a sense of duty, applicable to my station as  
						the resident minister, and without authority from my government. I considered the act in my note as that of the British officer, as one in which the govt: had no agency, was not bound to support, and which it would be honorable for it to disavow. I flattered myself that some  
						advantage might arise from the measure, and that under the circumstances in which it was taken no injury possibly could. His reply is dated on the 3. instant, which tho’ addressed in a harsh tone, may be considered as conceding essentially the point desired. It is my  
						intention to say nothing more to him on the subject ’till I hear from you, and in the meantime to observe the most conciliatory conduct that circumstances will admit.  
					Such is the state of this country at the present crisis that it is impossible to foresee what will be its course of conduct towards the U. States. There has been at all times since the commencement of the present war a strong party here for extending its  
						ravages to them. This party is combined of the ship-holders, the navy, the East and West India merchants, and certain political characters of great consideration in the State. So powerful is this combination that it is most certain that nothing can be obtained of this  
						government on any point, but what may be extorted by necessity. The disasters to the North ought to inspire moderation, but with respect to the Northern powers it seems to have produced directly the opposite effect. A fleet of about 25 Ships of the line, with a suitable  
						number of frigates, and above 20,000 men has been lately equipped and as it is said, sent to the Baltic to take possession of the Danish and Russian navies. This measure is imputed to an understanding which it is supposed has been established between the cabinets of Russia  
						and Paris by the late peace, and which has for its object a concert of measures for the purpose of attempting to force on this country a maritime code more favorable to neutral nations. The motive assigned for the expedition is that of taking possession of the Danish fleet to  
						keep it out of the hands of the French; that the Russian fleet is one of the objects is not so generally believed; tho’ perhaps not less probable.  
					Mr. Pinkney and myself have taken the first Step in our business. We will write to you in a few days the state of it. You may be assured that we shall do every thing in our power to promote in the mode most likely to Succeed the object of our instructions  
						and the interest of our country. Want of time prevents my going into further detail. I have the honor to be, With great consideration, Sir, Your most obedt. serv

London, August 4th, 1807,  
SIR,  
  
I avail myself of the opportunity  
afforded by Mr. Biddle, to com-  
municate to you acopy of acorres-  
pondence, and the substance ofa  
conference, between Mr. Canning  
and myself, relative to the late ag-  
eression on the peace and sove-  
reignty of the United States, by  
the British ship Leopard, in an  
attack on the Chesapeake, off the  
capes of Virginia.  
  
Mr. Canning’s private letter of  
July 25, which gave the first intel-  
ligence of the occurrence, left it  
doubtful whether the British offi-  
cers had been culpable in it; and as  
I knew how very reprehensible  
  
their conduct had been on our coast,  
on many other occasions, and to  
what height the sensibility of our  
citizens had been excited by it, I  
thought it not improbable that  
something might have occurred to  
divide the blame between the par-  
ties. It was under that impression  
that my answer was written. On  
the next day the leading features  
of the transaction were presented  
to the public, through the medium  
of the gazettes, which were taken  
from private accounts received di-  
rectly from Halifax, by a vessel  
which had been dispatched by ad-  
miral Berkley with the official one.  
By these it was evident that the  
British officer was completely the  
aggressor, In an outrage of great  
enormity, attended with circum-  
stances which increased the of-  
fence. It was understood likewise,  
from good authority, that the offi-  
cial intelligence which the govern-  
ment had received corresponded  
with and confirmed the other ac-  
counts already before the public.  
On full consideration of these  
circumstances, I concluded that it  
would be highly improper for me  
to leave the affair on the ground  
on which Mr. Canning had placed  
it. I could see no other motive in  
him to obtain further iuformation  
relative to the transaction, than  
for the purpose of ascertaining  
whether the men said to be desert-  
ers, and for whom the attack was  
made, were American citizens or  
British subjects ; to which it was  
impossible for me to give any coun-  
tenance. I thought it indispensi-  
ble therefore to call on the govern-  
ment to disavow the principle, and  
to engage such other reparation to  
the United States, as their injured  
honour obviously required. It ap-  
peared to me, that any delay in  
taking that step which depended  
  
4

on an abstract principle, and re-  
quired no argument to illustrate,  
or facts to support it, would have  
a tendency to weaken a claim  
which was unquestionable, and to  
countenance the idea that it would  
not be supported with suitable  
energy.  
  
I had, before the knowledge of  
this event, obtained the appoint-  
ment of an interview with Mr.  
Canning on other business, to take  
place on the 29th ult. We met  
according to the appointment: I  
observed, in opening the confer-  
ence, that, although the topics  
which had brought us together  
were important, the late occur-  
rence at the entrance of the Che-  
sapeake had in a great measure  
put them out of sight. He ex-  
pressed his regret that such an  
event, which would at all times  
furnish cause of concern, should  
have happened at the present time.  
He asked if the men in question  
were American citizens or Bri-  
tish subjects? I replied that that  
was a point which could not come  
into view in the case ; that it was  
one which, according as the fact  
might be, would make the cause  
more or less popular in either  
country, but could not affect the  
principle ; that on principle, a ship  
of war protected ail the people on  
board, and could not be entered to  
be searched for deserters, or for  
any purpose, without violating the  
sovereignty of the nation whose  
flag she bore; that in the present  
case I had been assured, that the  
men were American citizens, and  
that the British minister at Wash-  
ington had been made acquainted  
with it. He said little on the sub-  
ject, but by the tendency of what  
he did say, seemed to imply that  
his government could not lose  
sight of the consideration aboye

alluded to, nor indeed did he ad-  
mit, by any thing that escaped him,  
that the abstract principle itself  
would not be insisted on. His re-  
marks however were generally of  
a conciliatory and friendly charac-  
ter: without pledging himself on  
any point, he seemed desirous to  
satisfy me, that no new orders had  
been issued by the present minis-  
try to the commandant of the Bri-  
tish squadron at Halifax. I ob-  
served, thatas the notes which had  
passed between us were informal,  
and on a very limited view of the  
subject on my part, it would be  
proper for me, now that the cir-  
cumstances were better known, to  
present him an official note on it:  
he admitted the propriety of it.  
  
I then drew Mr. Canning’s at-  
tention to the subjects on which I  
had asked the interview: being the  
case of the Impetueux, captain  
Love’s correspondence, the con-  
duct of capt. Douglas, and of the  
British squadron generally on our  
coast. I observed that I had here-  
tofore postponed any official com-  
munication on these points, from  
a desire to connect them with the  
greater objects depending between  
our governments, and of course  
from motives the most friendly ;  
that I brought them to his view at  
this time, in consequence of Mr.  
Pinkney and myself having com-  
menced the other business, as he  
knew had been done: he promised  
to attend to them.  
  
On the 29th July, I wrote Mr.  
Canning the note whichI had pro-  
mised him in the late interview.  
I addressed it in terms which I  
thought suitable to the occasion,  
observing to state in it, that I took  
the step from a sense of duty, ap-  
plicable to my station as the resi-  
dent minister, and without authori-  
ty from my government: I con-  
  
;

sidered the act as that of the Bri-  
tish officer, in which the govern-  
‘ment had no agency, was not  
bound to support, and which it  
would be honourable for it to dis-  
avow. I flattered myself that some  
advantage might arise from the  
measure, and that, under the cir-  
cumstance in which it was taken,  
no injury possibly could. His re-  
ply is dated on the 3d instant,  
which, though addressed in rather  
a harsh tone, may be considered  
as conceding essentially the point  
desired. It is my intention to say  
nothing more to him on the sub-  
ject till I hear from you, and in  
the mean time to observe the most  
conciliatory conduct that circum-  
stances will admit.  
  
Such is the state of this country  
at the present crisis, that it 1s im-  
possible to foresee what will be  
its course of conduct towards the  
United States. There has been,  
‘at all times since the commence-  
ment of the present war, a strong  
party here for extending its rava-  
gestothem. ‘This party is com-  
posed of the ship owners, the na-  
vy, the East and West India mer-  
chants, and several- political cha-  
racters of great consideration in the  
state. So powerful is this combi-  
nation, that it is most certain that  
nothing can be obtained of the go-  
vernment on any point, but what  
may be extorted by necessity.  
The disasters to the north ought  
to inspire moderation; but, with  
respect to the northern powers, it  
seems to have produced directly  
the opposite effect.  
about twenty-five ships of the line,  
with a suitable number of irigates,  
&amp;c., and above 20,000 men, has  
been lately equipped, and sent to  
the Baltic, as it is said, to take  
possession of the Danish and Rns-  
  
A fleet of  
  
sian navies. This measure is im-  
puted to an understanding which  
it is supposed has been established  
between the cabinets of Russia and  
Paris by the late peace, and which  
has for its object a concert of mea-  
sures, for the purpose of attempt-  
ing to force on this country a ma-  
ritime code more favourable to  
neutral nations. The motive as-  
signed for the expedition, is that  
of taking possession of the Danish  
fleet, to keep it out of the hands  
of the French: that the Russian  
fleet is one of the objects is not so  
generally believed, though per-  
haps not less probable.  
  
Mr. Pinkney and myself have  
taken the first step in our business.  
We will write you ina few days  
the state of it. You may be as-  
sured that we shall do every thing  
in our power to promote, in the  
mode most likely to succeed, the  
object of our instructions, and the  
interests of our country. Want  
of time prevents my going into  
further detail.

great consideration, sir, your most

Mr. Canning’s private letter of July 25,  
wnich g.&#x27;si e the first intelligence of the oc­

would be proper for me/ now, that the cir  
cvunstances were better known, to presen  
him an official note on it ; he admitted thi  
propriety of it.  
1 then drew Mr Canning’s attention t&lt;  
the subjects on which I had asked the in  
ter view ; being the case of the Impetileux  
captain Love’s correspondence, the c«n  
duct of -.aptaln Douglas, and of*the liri­  
tish squadron generally on our coast I ofc  
served that I had heretofore postponed am  
official communication ort these points, from  
j a desire to connect them with the greater  
j o!)jects depending between our govern•  
ments, and of course, from motives the moat  
Iner.diy t that I brought tiiein to lus view  
ut tikis time, in consequence of Mr Pink*  
n::y and myself having commenced the o.  
ther buisness, as he knew bad been done •  
he promised to attend to them.  
On tiie &#x27;JJ July, I wrote Mr, Canning  
the note which 1 lmd promised him in the  
late interview: I: addressed it in terms  
which I thought suitable to the occasion,  
observing to state in It, that 1 took the step  
from a sense of duty, applicable to my sta­  
tion as the resident minister, and without  
authority from my government: 1 consi­  
de-ed the act ns that of the llritish officer,  
m which, the government had no agency,  
was not bound to support, and which if  
would be honorable for it to disavow. I  
flattered myself that some advantage rn.ght  
arise from the measure, and that under  
the circumstances in which it was taken,  
no injury possibly could. His reply is da­  
ted on the 3d instant, which though addres­  
sed in rather a harsh tone, may be consi­  
dered as conceding essentially the point  
desired, it is my intention to s:iy nothing  
mere to hi in on the subject, till 1 hear  
from you, and in the mean time to observe  
the most conciliatory conduct that circum­  
stances will admit.  
  
m me »v«e or mis country at the  
present crisis, that it is impossible to fore­  
see what will be its course of conduct to­  
wards tiie IT. S. There has been at all  
times, since the commencement of the pro­  
Mu.t war, a strong party here fur extend­  
ing its ravages to them. Thisparty is com­  
posed t.f the ship owners, the navy, the  
East and Went India merchants, and Se­  
vern! pnktical characters of great Conside­  
ration in the state. So powerful is this  
combination, that it is most certain that  
nothing can be obtained of the government  
on any point, but what niay be extorted by  
necessity. The disasters to the north  
ought to inspire moderation, but wit! res­  
pect *o the northern powers, it s&#x27;-enis to  
have produced directly the opposite effect.  
A devt of about I?5 ships of the line, with  
a suitable number of frigates, 8ic. and above  
20,000 men, bus been lately equipped, and  
sen,, to the Iviitic, as it is sail!, to lake pos­  
session ot the Danish and Russian navies.  
This measure is imputed to an understand­  
inu, which it is supposed ha- hem establish­  
ed between the cabinets of Russia and Pa­  
r&#x27;s by the late peace, and which lias for its  
object n ccnr»rt ofmerrr.urr* f. r the pur­

expedition, is that of taking possession of  
the Danish fleet, to keep it out ot the hands

London, August ith, 1807.  
Sir—  
I avail myself of the opportunity afforded by Mr.  
Biddle, to communicate to you a copy of a corres­  
pondence, and the substance of a conference be­  
tween Mr. Canning and myself, relative to the late  
aggression on the peace and sovereignty of the U.  
States by the British ship Leopard in the attack on  
the Chesapeake, off the rapes of Virginia.  
Mr. Canning’s piivate letter of July 25, which  
gave the first intelligence of the occurrence, left it  
doubtful whether the British officers had been cul­  
pable in it, and as I knew how very repiehensible  
their rondurl bad been o(F our roast, on many other  
occasions, and to what height the sensibility of our  
citizens had been excited by it, I thought it not im­  
probable that something might have occurred to di­  
vide the blame between the parties. It was under  
that impression that my answer was written. On  
the next day the leading features of the transaction  
were presented to the ptiblirk thro’the medium of the  
gazettes which were taken from private accounts re­  
ceived directly from Halifax, by a vessel which had  
been dispatched by admiral Berkeley with the offici­  
al one. By these it was evident, that the British  
offirer was completely the aggressor, in an muragent  
great enormity attended with circumst ttices whieli  
increased the offence. It was understood likewise  
from good authority, that the official intelligence  
which the government had received corresponded  
with and confirmed the other accounts already be­  
fore the ptiblirk.  
  
On lull consideration of these circumstances, I  
concluded that it would be highly improper in me  
to leave the affair on the ground on which Mr. Can­  
ning had placed it. I could see no other motive in  
him to obtain further information relative to the  
transaction, than for the purpose of ascertaining  
whether the men said to be deserters, and for whom  
the attack was made, were American citizens nr  
British subjects ; to which it was impossible for  
me to give any countenance. 1 thought it indis­  
pensable therefore to rail on the government to dis­  
avow the principle and to engage such other repara­  
tion to the United States as their injured honoui  
obviously required. It appeared to me, that any  
delay in taking that step which depended on an ab­  
stract principle, and required no argument to illus­  
trate, or fact to support it, would have a tendency  
to weaken a claim which was unquestionable, and  
to countenance an idea that it would not be support­  
able with suitable energy.  
1 had, before the knowledge of this event, ob­  
tained the appointment of an interview with Mr.  
Canning, on other business, to take place on the  
29th ultimo. VVe met according to the appoint­  
ment ; I observed, in opening the conference, that  
although the topicks winch had brought us toge­  
ther, were important, the late occurrence at the en­  
trance of the Chesapeake had in a great measure pul  
them out of sight, lie expressed his regret that  
such an event which would at all times lurnisli  
cause of coucern should have happened at the pie  
tent time. He asked if the men in question were  
* American citizens, or Brilisb subjects? I replied  
that that was a point which could not come into  
view in the case : that it was one which, according  
as the fact might be, would mak€ the cause more  
or less popular, in either country, but could not af­  
fect the principle : on that principle, a ship of war  
protected all the people on board, and could not be  
entered to be searched for deserters, or for any pur­  
pose, without violating the sovereignty of the na­  
tion whose flag she bore ; that in the present case  
1 bad been assured, that the men were American ci­  
tizens, and that the British minister at Washington  
bad been made acquainted with it. He said little  
on tbe subject, but by the tendency of what he did  
say, seemed to imply that his government could  
nqt lose sight of the consideration above alluded to,  
nor indeed did be admit by any thing that escaped  
bim, that the abstract principle itself would not be  
Josisted on. His remarks however weie generally  
*&gt;f a conciliatory and fro ndly character ; without  
pledging himself on any point, be seemed desirous  
&gt;|o satify me, that no new orders had been issued by  
.the present ministry to (be commandant of the Bri­  
tish squadron at Halifax. 1 observed, that as the  
.notes which had passed between us, »&gt;re informal,  
;«ad M a very lumted view of tbe subject, ouany  
  
part, it would le proper for me row, (bat the cir­  
cumstances were heller known, to present him an  
omrial note on it: he admitted the propriety of it.  
I then drew Mr. Canning&#x27;s attention to the sub­  
jerts on which I had asked the interview ; being  
the rase, of the Imprteux, captain Love&#x27;s cor­  
respondence, the conduct of captain Douglas,  
and of the British squadron generally on our coast.  
I observed that I had heretolore postponed any of­  
ficial communication on these points, Irom a desire  
to connect them with the greater objects depending  
between our governments, and of course, Irom mo­  
tives the most friendly ; that 1 brought them to his  
view at this tune, inconsequence ot Mi. Pinckney  
and my sell having commenced the other business,  
as he knew had been dune ; he promised to attend  
•to them.  
On the 2.9th July I wrote to Mr. Canning, the  
note which I had proiniseu him in the late inter­  
view. I addressed it in terms which 1 thought suit­  
able to the occasion, observing to state in it, that 1  
took the step from a sense ot duty, applicabe to my  
station as the resident minister, and without authori­  
ty from my govermcnt. I considered the act as  
lliatol the Bnlisli officer, in which the government  
had no agency, was not bound to support, and  
which it would he honourable (or it to disavow. I  
ITaHired mysell that some advantage might arise  
Im.n the measure, and under the circumstances in  
which it was taken no harm possisibly could. His  
reply is dated 011 the 3d nisi, which though address­  
ed in rather a harsh tone may be considered as con­  
ceding essentially the point desired. It is my inten­  
tion to say nothing more to him on the subject till  
I bear Irom you, and in the meantime to observe  
the most conciliatory conduct that circumstances  
will admit.  
  
Sue his the state of this rountry at the present  
crisis, that it is impossible lo foresee what will be  
its course of conduct towards the United Slates.—  
*1 lu re has been at all times, since the commence­  
ment of the present war, a strong party here for  
extending its ravages to them. This party is com­  
posed of the ship owners, the navy, the East and  
West India merchants, and several political charac­  
ters ot great consideration in the state. So power­  
lul is tins comb.nation, that it is most certain that  
nothing can be obtained of the government on any  
point, but what may be extorted by necessity. The  
disasters of the north ought to inspire moderation,  
but wiih respect to the northern powers, it seems to  
have produced the opposite effect. A fleet of about  
25 sail of the line, with a suitable number of fri­  
gates, &amp;c. and above 20.000 men has been latelv  
equipped, and sent into the Ualtick, as it is said, to  
lake possession »l the Danish and Russian navies.  
I his measure is imputed to an understanding which  
it is supposed has been established between the ca­  
binets of Russia and Pans by the late peace, and  
which has tor its object a concert of measures for  
the purpose of attempting to force on this country a  
maritin# code, more lavourable to neutral nations.  
The motive assigned for the expedition, is that of  
taking posssesion of the Danish fleet, to keep it out  
ot the hands of the French ; that the Russian fleet  
is one of the objects is not so generally believed,  
though perhaps not less probable.  
Mr. Pinkney and myself have taken the first step  
in our business. We will write yon m a few days  
the state of it. You may lie assured that we shall  
do every thing in our power to promote, in the  
mode most likely to succeed, the object of our in­  
structions und the interest of our country. Want  
:&gt;f time prevents my going into further detail.

on, sir, your most obedient servant

On full consideration of these circumstances,  
1 concluded that it would be highly improper in  
me to leave the affair on the ground on which  
Mr. Canning had placed it. 1 could see no other  
motive in him to obtain further information rela­

and for whom the attack was in. de, were Ameri­

thought it indispensable therefore to call on the

which depended on an abstract principle, and re­  
quired no argument to illustrate, or fact to sup­  
■port it, would have a tendency to weaken a claim  
» which was unquestionable, and to countenance  
the idea that it would not be supportable with  
suitable energy.  
1 had, before the knowledge of this event, ob­  
tained the appointment of an interview with Mr.  
Canning on other business, to take place on the  
29th ultimo. VVc met according to the appoint­  
ment ; 1 observed, in opening the conference,  
that although the topics which had brought us to­  
gether, were important, the late occurrence at  
the entrance of the Chesapeake had in a great  
measure put them out of sight- He expressed  
his regret that such an event, which would at all  
times lurnish cause of concern, should have hap­  
pened at the present lime. He asked if the men  
in question were American citizens, or British  
subjects ? I replied that that was a point which  
could not come into view in the case ; that it was  
one which, according as the fact might be, would  
Blake the cause more or less popular, in either  
country, hut could not affect the principle . on  
that principle, a ship of war protected all the peo­  
ple un board, and could not be entered to be I  
searched for deserters, or for any purpose, with­  
out violating the sovereignty of tiie nation whose  
flag she bore ; that in the present case I had been  
assured, that the men were American citizens,  
and that the British minister at Washington had  
been made acquainted with it. He said little on  
the subject, but the tendency of What he did  
say, seemed to imply that his government could  
not lose sight of the consideration above alluded  
to, nor indeed did he admit by any thing that  
escaped h:m, that the abstract principle itself  
would not be insisted on. His remarks-, howe­  
ver, were generally of a conciliatory and friend­  
ly character ; without pledging himself on any  
point, he seemed desirous to satisfy me, that no  
ne\V orders had been issued by the present minis­  
lr-v. to V,e commandant of tlie British squadron  
at Halifax. 1 observed, that as the notes which  
hadpassed between us, were informal, and on a  
very limited view of the subject, on my part, it  
■would be proper for me im\, that the&#x27; circum­  
stances were better knovVn, to present him an of­  
ficial not* on it: he admitted the propriety’ of it.  
I then drew Mr. Canning’s attention to the  
subjects on. which I had asked the interview ;  
being the case of the linpetueux, captain Love’s  
correspondence, the conduct of captain Douglas,  
and of tiie British squadron generally on our  
const. 1 observed that 1 had heretofore postpo­  
ned any official Communication on these points  
■from a desire to connect them with tlie greater  
objects depending between our governments, and  
of course, from motives the most friendly; that  
1 brought th«-m to his view aWhis time, in eonsc­  
qCcnce ol Mr. Pinckney and mvselt having- com­  
menced the other business, as be knew bad been  
done ; lie promised to attend to them.  
On the 29th July ! wrote to Mr. Canning, the  
note which 1 had promised him in the late inter­  
view. I addressed it in terms which 1 thought  
- suitable to tlie occasion, observing to state in it,  
that 1 took tlie step from a sense of duty , appli­  
cable to my station as the resident minister, and  
without authority from my government. 1 consi­  
dered the act as that of the British officer, in !  
which die government find no agency, was not  
bound Ui support, and which it would be honora­  
ble tor it to disavow. I Ha&#x27;tered myself that some  
advantage might arise from the measure, and  
under tiie circumstances in which it was taken  
no harm possibly could. His reply is dated on  
die od hist, which though addressed in rather a  
harsh tore, may be considered as conceding essen­  
tially the point desired, li is my munition to sav I  
notuing more to turn on tiie subject till 1 hear  
from you, and iB the*mean time to observe tlie  
most conciliatory conduct that circumstances will  
  
aamit.  
Such is the state of this country at the present  
crisis, that it is impossible tp foresee what will  
be its course of conduct towards the United  
.States. There has been at all times, since the  
Commencement ot iiie present war, a strong par­  
ty here for extending its ravages to them. This  
party is composed ot the ship owners, the navv,  
tit- East and West India merchants&#x27;, and several  
poi.ticnl characters of great consideration in the  
state. So powerful is this combination, that it  
is most certain that nothing can be obtained of  
the government on my point, but what may be  
extorted by necessity. The disasters to the  
north ought to inspire moderation, but with yes­  
pect to the northern powers, it seems to have  
produced the opposite effect. A fleet of about  
25 ships of the line, with a suitable number of  
frigates, Nc. and above 20,000 men has been  
lately equipped, and sent into the lialtic, as it is  
8aid, to take possession of tlie Dainsh and Russi­  
an navies. This measure is imputed to :m un­  
derstanding which it is supposed has been esta­  
blished between the cabinets of Russia and Paris  
Ey the lale peace, and which has for its object a  
concert of measures for the purpose of attempting  
to force ort this country a maritime code, more  
favorable to neutral nations. The motive assign­  
ed for the expedition, is that of taking possessi­  
on of the Danish fleet, to k ep it out of the hands  
of die French ; that the Russian fleet is one of  
the objects is not so generally believed, though  
perhaps not less probable.  
Mr. Pinckney and myself have taken the first  
step in our business. We will write you 111 a few  
days the state of it. You may be assured that we  
shall do every thing in our power to promote, in  
tiie mode most likely to succeed, the object of  
our instructions and the interest of our country.  
Want of time prevents my going into further de­  
tail.  
1 have the honor to be, with great considerati­  
on, sir, you* most obedient servant,

| No.  
| London, August 4th, 1807.  
Sir—lT avail myfelf of the opportunity af­  
forded by Mr. Biddle, to communicate to  
~you a copy of a correspondence, and the  
~ substance of a conference, between Mr. Can­  
- ning and myfelf, relative to the late aggrei­  
[ fion on the peace and (overeignty of the U.  
States, by the Britith ship Leopard, in an  
attack on the Chesapeake, off&#x27; the capes of  
Virginia. \
Mr. Canning’s private letter of July 25,  
which gave the firlt intelligence of the oc­  
currence, left it doubtful whether the Bri­  
tith officers had been culpable in it,and as  
I knew how very reprehensible their con­  
duct had been on our coast, on many other  
occasions, and to what height the fcnﬁbii&#x27;xty  
of our citizens had been excited by it, [  
thought it nct improbable that fomcthing  
might bhave occurred to divide the blame  
between the parties. It was under that im.  
preflion that my answer was written. On  
the nex: day the leading features of the  
tranfa&amp;ion were presented to the public  
through the medium of the Gazeéttes, which  
were taken from private accounts receiyed  
dire@ly from Halifax, by a veflel which  
had been dispatched by admiral Berkeley  
with the official one. By these it was evi­  
dent that the Britith officer was compietely  
the aggreflor, in an outrage of great enor­  
mity, attended with circumstances which in­  
creased the offence. It was understood  
likewise from good authority, that the offi­  
cial intelligence, which the government had  
received, corresponded with and confirmed  
the other accounts already before the pubiic.  
Oa full consideration of these circum­  
stances, I concluded that it would be highly  
tmpreper for me to leave the affair on the  
ground on which Mr. Canning bad placed  
it. Tcould fee no other motive in him to  
obtain further information relative to the  
transaction, than for the purpose of ascer­  
taining whether the men said te be deser­  
ters, and for whom the attack was made,  
were American citizens or Britith fubjecs ;  
to which it was impoflible for meto give  
any countenance. - 1 thought it indispensa­  
ble therefore to call on the government to  
disavow the principle and to engage fach  
other reparation to the United States, as  
their injured honor obviously required It  
appeared ‘to me, that any delay in taking  
that step which depended on an ablira&amp;®  
principle, and required no argument to il­  
lu#rate, or fa&amp;s to support it, would have  
a rendency to wezken a claim which was  
unqueltionable; and tocountenance the idea  
i that it would not be supportable with suit­  
able energy, j _  
I had, before the knowledge of this event,  
obtained the appointment ﬁ&#x27; an interview  
with Mr. Canning on other I)uﬁncfs,to take  
place on the 29th ultimo. We met accor­  
ding to the appointment ; I observed, in  
opening the conference, that although the  
topics which had brought us together, were  
important, the late occurrence at the en­  
trance of the h‘cacfa\vpt‘:ak&#x27;e had in a great  
measure put thém out of fight. He&#x27;expref­  
fed his regret-that fueh an event which &#x27;  
would at all times furnith cause of concern,  
Ahould have happened at the present time.  
He afkéfl if the men in question were A­  
&#x27; mericdn citizens, or Dritith fubje@s ? I re­  
plied that that was a point which could not  
come into view ir the case: that it wasone  
t which,according as the fa&amp; might be, would |  
i miake the cause more or less popular, in ci­  
ther country, but could not affect the prin­  
‘ciple : that on principle, a ship of war pro­  
- tected all the people on board, and eould  
~not-be entered to be searched for deserters,  
~or for any purpose, without violating the  
sovereignty of the nation whose flag she  
! bore ; that in the present case I had been  
- #ffured, that the men were American citi­  
zens, and that the Buitifh minister at Wath­  
ington bad been made acquainted with it.  
He said little on the subject, but hy the  
tendeocy of what he did {ay, seemed toim- 11  
ply that bis government couldnot lose fight&#x27;  
of the consideration above alluded to, nor  
_indeed did he admit by :‘K thing that ef­  
“caped him, that the abftrack principle itfelf 1  
~would pof be indifted on. His remarks Liow­  
_ever were geaerally of a conciliatory and  
fricadly charader ; without pledging him- -  
~felf on any point; he seemed desirous to fat­  
) S Get b et  
%*?* .  
served, vßk the tioees BN had pulsed  
  
limited view of the fubjeét, on my part, it  
would be proper for mc now, that the ¢ir­  
camftances weré better known, te present  
him an official note on it : he admitted the  
propriety of it &#x27;  
I then drew Mr. Canning’s attention to  
the subjects, on which I kad asked the in­  
terview ; being the case of the Impetucex,  
captain Love’s correspondence, the conduct  
of capt. Douglas, and of the British ff}uad­  
-ron generally on our coast. lobferved that  
1 bad hetetofore postponed any official com­  
munication on these points from a desire to  
conneét them with the greater objets de­  
pending between our governments, and of  
course, from motiyes the most friendly ;  
that I breught them to his view at this time,  
in consequence of Mr. Pinckney and myfelf  
having commenced the other business. as he  
knew had been done ; he promised to at­  
tend to them. -  
On the 29th July, I wrote Mr, Canning  
the note which I had promised him in the  
late interview. 1 addrefled it in terms  
which § thought suitable to the occasion,  
obfcrvig to state in it, that I took the step  
from a fenfé’ of duty, applicable to my sta­  
tion as the resident miaifter, and without  
authority from my government. I consid­  
ered the act as that of the Britith officer, in  
which th¢ government had no agency, was  
not bouad to support, and which it would  
be honorable for it to disavow. 1 flattered  
myfelf tlxat some advantage might arise  
from the measure, and that under the cir­  
cum(taneds in which it was taken, no injury  
poflibly ebuld. His reply is dated on the  
3d in?emmch though addressed in rather  
a harsh tofte; may be considered as conced­  
ing eficntially the point desired. Itis iy  
inteation to {ay nothing more to him on the  
fubjec, till I hear from you, and in the mean  
tim¢ to observe the most conciliatory con­  
dudt that cifcumftances will admit.  
such is the state of this country at the  
present crisis, that it is impo(fible-to forelee  
what will be its courle of condudt towards  
the U States&#x27; There has been at all times,  
fidee the commencement of the present war,  
a strong party here for extending its ravages  
to them. - This party is composed of the  
ship owners, the navy, the East and Weft  
India merchanis, and several political char­  
acters of great consideration in the state.—  
Se powerful is this combinaticn, that it is  
molt certain that nothing can be obtained  
of the government on any point, but what  
may be extorted by ncceflity. The disasters  
to the north ought to inspire moderation,  
but with respect to the northern powers, it  
seems to have produced dirediy the oppo­  
site effe@. A fleet of about 25 ships of :he  
line, with a {uitable number of frigates, &amp;c.  
and above 20,000 men has been lately e­  
quipped, and sent to the Baltic, as it is [aid,  
to take pedleflion of the Danish and Ruffian  
navies. This measure is unputed to an un­  
derstanding which it is supposed has been  
established between the cabinets of Russia  
and Paris by the late peace, and which has  
for its object a concert of measures for the  
purpose of attempting to forece on this coun­  
try a maritime code, more favorable to neu­  
trai nations. The motive afligned for the  
expedition, is that of taking poffeflion of the  
Danith fleet, to keep it out of the hands of  
the French ; that the Ruffian fleet is one of  
the objecs is not so generally believed,  
though perhaps not less probable:’  
Mr Pinckney and myfelf have taken the  
firlt flep in ouc business. We will write  
you in a few days the ftaté of it. You may  
“be alfured that we fhaill do cvery thing in  
our powerso promote, in&#x27; the mode molt  
likely to succeed, the object of our instruc­  
tions and the intérefls of cur country.—

by Mr. Diddle, to communicate to yoa a co­

self, relative to the Ute oen!ion on the  
peace and snvereigitfy of the United States  
by the BntLh ship LeVpard in the ttck on  
the Chesapeake, off the , Cpes cf Vjreiuia.  
Mr. Canning&#x27;s private ktterof July 23,  
which gave the first intellieeoce cf the oc­  
currence, left it doubtful whether the British  
officers had been culpable In it, and as I  
knew bow very reprchenii&#x27;Je their cenduct  
had been off our coaU, on many otler occa­  
sions, and to what height the - senslhiliry tt  
our citizens had been exerted by it, 1 thought  
it not improbable that something might have  
occurred to divide the blame between the  
psrtiesvf Itwit tmder ehatlfflpttdon that  
my answer was wrritun. On the next day  
the leading features tf the transaction were  
  
presented ta the.Wdsa thrviis  
  
of the gazettes wWth were ukeo frcm on  
  
rate accounU recei red directly fromi tlihux,  
by a veasel which had been dU patched by  
Admiral Berkeley with the tfiicial one; By  
these it was er kfent, that tl.e British cffUrerj  
was completely the aggreor, in an outrage  
of great enormity attended with circumstan­

nicate a correspondence, and the sub­  
stance of a conference between Mr.  
Canning and myself, relative to the late  
aggression on the pcsitc and sovereignty  
of the United States, by the British ship  
Leopard, in an attack on the Chesapeake,  
off the Capes oi V irginia.  
Mr. Canning’s private letter of July  
25&gt; which gave the first intelligence of  
the occurrence, left it doubtful whether  
the British officers had been culpable in  
it , and as I knew how very reprehensi­  
ble their conduct had been on our coast  
on many other occasions, and to what  
height the sensibility of our citizens had  
been excited by it, I thought it not im­  
  
probable that something might have oc­  
curred to divide the blame between the  
parties. It was under that impression  
that my answer was written. On the  
next day the leading features of the  
transaction were presented to the public  
through the medium of the gazettes,  
which were taken from private accounts  
received directly from Halifax, by a ves­  
sel which had been dispatched by ad­  
miral Berkley with the official one. By  
these it was evident that the British of­  
ficer was completely the aggressor, in an  
outrage of great enormity/attended with  
circumstances which increased the of­  
fence. It was understood likewise,  
from good authority, that the official in­  
telligence which the government had  
received, corresponded with and con­  
firmed the other accounts alreadv before  
the public.  
On full consideration of these circum­  
stances, I concluded that it would be  
highly improper for me to leave the af­  
fair on the ground on which 31 r. Can­  
ning had placed it. I could see no other  
motive in him to obtain further infor­  
mation relative to the transaction, than  
for the purpose of ascertaining whether  
the mm said to be deserters, and for  
w hom the attack was made, were Ame­  
rican citizens or British subjects ; to  
wliich it was impossible for me to give  
  
*ny countenance. I thought it indis­  
pensable, therefore, to call on the go­  
vernment to disavow the principle, and  
to engage such other reparation to the  
United States, as their Injured honour  
obviously required. It appeared to me,  
tnat any delay in taking that step, which  
depen led on. an abstract principle, and  
required no argument to illustrate, cr  
facts to support it, would have a tenden­  
cy to weaken a claim which was ttnques­  
tioie.b&#x27;e, and to countenance the idea  
tin; It would not be supported with suit­  
able i. ih rgy.  
1 had, before the knowledge of this  
event, obtained the appointment of an  
interview with Mr. Canning on other  
bu iness, to take place on the 29di ult.  
Vv’e met according to the appointment.  
I obs -rved, it: opening the conference,  
that atthough the topics which had bro’t  
us together were important, the late oc­  
currence at the entrance of the Chcsa­  
peake, had in a great measure put them  
ovit cl sight. He expressed his regret  
t iat such an event, which would at all  
times iurniah cause of concern, should  
have happened at the present time. lie  
asked it the men in question were A­  
  
mencan citizens, or British subjects?  
I replied that that was a point which  
could not come into view in the case:;  
that it was one which according as the  
-‘act might be, would make the cause  
more or less popular, m either country,  
but could not affect the principle : that  
on principle, a ship of war protected all  
the people on hoard, aud could not be  
entered to !&gt;c searched lor deserters, or •  
for any purpose, without violating the  
sovereignty oi the nation whose flag she  
bore ; that in the present case i had  
been assured, that the. men were Ame­  
rican citizens, and that the. British mi­  
nister at Washington had been made ac­  
quainted with it. He said little on the  
subject, but by the tendency of what he  
did say, seemed to imply that his gov­  
ernment could not lose sight of the con­  
sideration above alluded to; nor indeed,  
bid he admit by any thing that escaped  
him, that the abstract principle itself  
would not be insisted on. Hisremarks  
however were generally of a conciliato­  
ry and friendly character ; without  
pledging himself on any point, he se* m­  
ed desirous to satisfy me, that no new  
orders had been issued by the present  
ministry to the commandant of the Bri­  
tish squadron at Halifax. I observed, *  
th as the notes which had passed be­  
tween us, were informal, and on a v*ry

limited view of the subject, on my part,  
it would be proper lor me, now, that  
the circumstances were better known,to  
present him an official note on it ; he  
admitted the propriety of it.  
1 then «4re\v iVir. Canning’s attention  
to the subjects on v hich 1 had asked the  
interview; being iht case of the Impe­  
tu* ux, captain Love’s correspondence,  
the conduct of captain Douglass, and of  
111 Ih itish squadron gem rally on cur  
coast. I observed thitt I had hereto­  
iore postponed any official tonumi: ica­  
tion on the^e points, from a desire to  
connect them with tin greater objects  
depending between our goviinmcrds,  
and ol course, from motives the n-pst  
friendly :—that i brought them to his  
vkw at this time, in consequence of  
IVir. Pinckney and myself having com­  
rm need the other business, as lie knew  
had been clone ; he promised to attend  
to them. *  
  
Un the 29th July, I wrote Mr. Can­  
ning the note which I had promised  
him in the late interview: I addressed  
it in terms which I thought suitable to  
the occasion, observing to state in it,  
that 1 look the step from a sense of du­  
• y, applicable to my station as the resi­  
dent minister, and without authority  
h om my government: I considered the  
act as that* ol the British officer, in  
which the government had no agency,  
was not bound to support, and which it  
would be honorable lor it to disavow. I  
flattered myself that some advantage  
might arise from the measure, and that  
under the circumstance in which it was  
taken, no injury possibly could, His  
reply is dated on the 3d instant, which  
though expressed in rather a harsh tone,  
may he considered as conceding essen­  
the point desired. It is my intention to  
.ay nothing more to him on the subject,  
till I hear from you, and in the mean  
time to observe the most conciliatory  
conduct that circumstances will admit.  
Such is the state of this country, at  
the present crisis, that it is impossible  
to foresee what will be its course of con­  
duct towards the United States. There  
has been at all times since the com­  
mencement ol the present war, a strong  
party here for extending its ravages to  
them. This party is composed of the  
ship owners, the navy, the East and  
West India merchants, and several po­  
litical characters of great consideration  
in the state. So powerful is this com­  
bination, that it is most certain that no­  
thing can be obtained of the government  
  
on any point* but what mav be extorted  
by necessity. The disasters in the  
north ought to inspire moderation, but  
with respect to the northern powers, it  
seems to have produced directly the  
opposite effect.- A fleet of about 25  
ships of the line, with a suitable num­  
ber of frigates, &amp;c. and above 20,000  
men, has been lately equipped, and sent  
to the Baltic, as it is said, to take pos­  
session oi the Danish &amp; Russian navies.  
J his measure is imputed to an under­  
standing which it is supposed has been  
t stabiished between the cabinets ol Rus­  
sia and Pai is by the late peace, and  
which has for its object a concert ot  
measures for the purpose of attempting  
to torce on this country a maritime code  
more favourable to neutral nations_  
The motive assigned for the expedition,  
is that ol taking possession of the Da­  
nish fleet, to keep it out of the hands of  
the French ; that the Russian fleet is  
one of the objects, is not so generally  
believed, though perhaps not less pro­  
bable.  
Mr. Pinckney and myself have taken  
the first step in our business. We will  
write you in a few days the state of it.  
You may be assured that we shall do e­  
very thing in our power to promote, in  
the mode most likely to succeed, the  
object of our instructions, and the inter­  
ests of our country. Want of time pre­  
vents my going into further detail.

consideration, sir, your most obedient
