I had the honor last Evening to receive your Excellencys Letter of the 7th Instant; with the several papers inclosed.  
Ever since the commencement of the present War, my Conduct has borne invariably testimony against those inhuman Excesses, which in too many instances, have marked its various progress.

you their determination thereon.  
Many inconveniences and disorders having arisen, from an improper admission of Flags at various Posts of the two Armies, which have given rise to complaints on both sides; to prevent this in future, and for the convenience of communication, I have concluded  
to receive all Flags from within your Lines at the post of Dobbs ferry &amp; no where else—so long as Head Quarters of the two Armies remain as at present. I have the honor to be Sir Your Excellencys Most O

the honor this evening to receive Your Excellency’s letter of  
the seventh instant, with the several papers inclosed. Ever  
since the commencement of this unnatural war my conduct  
has borne invariable testimony against those inhuman excesses  
that in too many instances have marked its various progress.  
With respect to a late transaction, I have already expressed my  
fixed resolution—a resolution formed upon the most mature  
deliberation and from which I shall not recede.’’
