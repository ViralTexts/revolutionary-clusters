Carola &amp; Georgia so pestilential through the summer. it was divided, &amp; a part sent to Georgia. I know not whether it has been attended to in S. Carola; but it has spread in the upper parts of Georgia so as to have become almost general, &amp; is highly prized. perhaps it may answer in Tennissee &amp; Kentucky. the greatest service which can be rendered any country is to add an useful plant to it’s culture; especially a bread grain. next in value to bread is oil.
