fore have the goodness, to excuse the liberty I have taken, in addressing you, on the present occasion.  
In the Seventh Article, of the Treaty of Cession of the territory of Louisiana, to the United States, by France, it is agreed, “that the French Ships coming directly from France or any of her Colonies, laden with the produce or Manufactures of France or her said Colonies, shall be admitted during the space of Twelve years in the ports of New Orleans, &amp; all other legal ports of entry within the ceded territory, in the same manner as the Ships of the United States coming directly from France, or any of her colonies.” This privilege is also extended, to the commerce of Spain.  
It appears to me, that Mr. Macon’s Bill, in its present shape, is an absolute violation of the above Article, of that treaty, &amp; whether (if it were to pass into a Law) it would not involve the United States in a war with France, or afford that power, a pretext for reclaiming that portion of the territory of the United State
