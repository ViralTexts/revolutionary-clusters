Extract of a letter from Th Jefferson to ———  
I have read Colo Taylor’s book of  ‘Constructions construed’ with great satisfaction, and, I will say, with edification; for I acknolege it has corrected some errors of opinion into which I had slidden, without sufficient examination. it is the most logical retraction of our governments to the original and true principles of the constitution creating them which has appeared since the adoption of that instrument. I may not perhaps concur in all it’s opinions, great &amp; small; for no two men ever thought alike on so many points. but on all it’s important questions, it contains the true political faith, to which every catholic republican should stedfastly hold. it should be put into the hands of all our functionaries, authoritatively, as a standing instruction, &amp; true exposition of our constitution, as understood at the time we agreed to it. it is a fatal heresy to suppose that either our state-governments are superior to the federal, or the federal to the states. the people, to whom all authority belongs, have divided the powers of government into two distinct departments, the leading characters of which are foreign and domestic, &amp; they have appointed for each a distinct set of functionaries. these they have made co-ordinate, checking &amp; balancing each other, like the three cardinal departments, in the individual states: each equally supreme as to the powers delegated to itself, and neither authorised ultimately to decide what belongs to itself, or to it’s Coparcenor in government. as independant in fact as different nations. a spirit of forbearance and compromise therefore, &amp; not of encroachment &amp; usurpation, is the healing balm of such a constitution: and each party should prudently shrink from all approach to the line of demarcation, instead of rashly overleaping it, or throwing grapples ahead to haul to hereafter. but finally the peculiar happiness of our blessed system is that in differences of opinion between these different sets of servants, the appeal is to neither, but to their employers peaceably assembled by their representatives in Convention. this is more rational than the jus fortioris, or the Cannon’s mouth, the ultima et sola ratio regum.

Hit rod of ti Idler from Tli. Jvjferson to —- -.  
“ 1 have read Col. Taylor&#x27;s book of“ Construction  
Construed” with great satisfaction, and I will say with  
edification ; for I acknowledge it has corrected so mo  
eftors of opinion into which I had slidden without  
sufficient examination. It is the most togicai rctiae­  
lion of our {•overumeut* to the original and true prin­  
ciples of the constitution creating them, which has  
appeared since the adoption of that instrument. 1 may  
not, perhaps, concur in all its opinions grcul iw small ;  
for no two men ever thought alike on so many |M&gt;int&gt;..  
Hut on all its important tpicsiions it contains the true  
political faith, lo which every catholic republican  
should steadfastly hold. It should be put into the  
  
minus ot an our lunctioiMiics, authoritatively as a  
standing instruction and true exposition of inn consti­  
tution, us understood at the time we agreed to it. It is  
a fatal heresy to suppose that either our slate govern­  
ments arc superior to thu federal, or the federal to  
the states. The pooptc, to whom all authority lie­  
long&gt;, have divided the powers of government into  
two distinct dcpnitmcnts, the leading characters of  
which arc foreign and domestic, and they have ap­  
pointed for each a distinct set of functionaries. These  
have been made co-ordinate, checking and balancing  
each oilier, like the three cardinal departments, in the  
individual states : each equally supreme as to the  
powers delegated to itself, and neither authorized ul­  
timately to decide what belongs to itself, or to its co­  
parccnor in government ; as independent in fact as  
dillercnt nations. A spirit of forbearance and com­  
promise, therefore, and not of encroachment and usur­  
pation, is the healing balm of such a constitution : and  
each party should prudently shrink Irom all approach  
to tile line ol demarcation, instead of rashly overleap­  
ing it, or throwing grapples ahead to haul to hereaf­  
ter. Blit, finally, the peculiar happiness of our bless­  
ed system is that, in differences of opinion between  
these ditferent sets of servants the appeal is to neither,  
but lo their employers peaceably assembled by their  
representatives in convention. This is more rational,

and true principles of the constitution creating {ambition of conquest or avaricious desire of wealth;  
  
them, which has appeared since the adoption of  
that instrument, I may not, perhaps, concur in  
all its opinions great and small; for no two men  
ever thought alike on so many points. But on all

steadfastly hold. It should be put into the hands

It is a fatal heresy to suppose that either of our  
state governments are superior to the federal, or  
the federal to the states. The people, to whom  
all authority belongs, have divided the powers of  
government into twodistinct departments, the lead-

self, and neither authorized ultimately to decide  
what belongs to itself, or to its co-partner in go-  
vernment; as independent in fact as different na-  
tions. A spirit of forbearance and compromise,  
therefore, and not of encroachment and usur-  
pation, is the healing balm of such a constitu-  
tion: and each party should prudently shrink  
from all approach to the line of demarcation,  
instead of rashly overleaping it, or throwing grap-  
ples ahead to haul to hereafter. But, finally,  
the peculiar happiness of our. blessed system is  
that, in differences of opinion between these dif-  
ferent sets of servants the appeal is to neither, but  
to their employers peaceably assembled by their

ification, that while so  
many stars are “shooting madly from their  
sphere,” Mr.J. still keeps on the even tenor of  
his brilliant ccurse, unswayed by the fashionable  
heresies of the times. We inireat the republi­  
cans to weigh well the doctrines of this distin­  
guished man—We intreat thosc politicians who  
are designedly, or heedlessly yielding up the  
rights of the states at the feet of a self-arrogated  
supremucy, and hurrying us into the gulf of con­  
solidation, to pause in their career to loek back  
tothe history of the constitution; and to listen  
to the warning voiee of eflerson and of Taylor.  
Extract of a letter from Th. Jefferson to ————.  
“] have read Col. Taylor’s book of “€onstruc­  
tion Construed” with great satisfaction, and I  
will say with edification ; for I acknowleage it  
has corrected sowne errors of opinion into which  
I had slidden without sutficient examination.  
1t i the most logical retraction of our govern­  
wents, to the original and true priaciples of the  
constitution ereating them, which has appeared  
since the adoption of that instrument. I may  
not, perhaps, concur in all its opinions great and  
small ; for no two men ever thought alike en so  
many points. Buton all its important questions  
it contains the true political faith, to which eve­  
ry catholic republican should steadfastly hald.—  
ft should be put into the hands of all our func­  
tionaries, authoritatively as a standing instruc­  
tion and true expositon of our constitation, as  
understood at the time agreed to it. It is a  
fatal heresy to suppose that either of our state  
governments are superior tn the fedeval, or the  
federal to the states. The people, to whom all  
authority belongs, have divided the powers of  
goveriment into two distinct departmesnts, the  
leading charactess of which are foreign and do­  
mestic, and they have appointed tor each a dis­  
tinet set of tunctionaries.. Fhese have been  
made co-ordinate, checking and balancing&#x27; each  
other, like the three cardinal departments, in the  
individual states . each equally supreme as to the  
powers delegated to itselt, and neither autlor­  
ized ultimately to deeide what belongs to itself,  
or to its co-paziner in govern:ment; as indepen­  
dent in fact as differeant nations. A spirit of for­  
bearance and compromise, therefove, and not of  
enctoachment and usurpation, is the hesling  
balm of sach a eonstitution: amd each pasty  
should prudeatly shrink from all approach to  
the line of demareation, instead of rashly over-  
Jeaping it, or throwing grapples ahead to haul te  
hereafter. But, finally, the peculiar happiness  
of our blessed system 1s that, in differences of  
opinion between these different sets of servants  
the appeal is to neither, but to their employers  
peaceably assembled by their reps®sentativesyin  
convention. This is more rational, than the jus  
fortioris, or the cannon’s mouth, the wltima et
