homas Jefferson (17 vols. to date; Princeton,  
N.J., 1950——)., VI, 467; VIII, 147). By November 1782 Jefferson was reported to have “lost” his retained copy of the answers which he had sent to Marbois (Randolph to JM, 16 November 1782). These documents, the copy made by Marbois, and the copy possibly made by Charles Thomson, have all disappeared. For this reason JM’s notes, although mostly confined to a single subject, seem to be the only extant evidence of even a brief portion of what Jefferson wrote in his original memorandum.

INTRODUCTION TO THE  
HISTORY OF THE COLONY AND ANCIENT DOMINION OF VIRGINIA.  
  
A general amnesty was granted to all the  
inhabitants. In case Sir William or his Coun-  
cillors should “goe for London, or other  
place in England, that they or anie of them  
shall bee free from any trouble or hindrance  
of arrests, or such like in England, and that  
they may follow their occasions, for the space  
of six monthes, after their arrivall.” *  
  
It would seem that some important articles  
of surrender were not ratified by the Long  
Parliament. The 4th was “that Virginia  
shall have and enjoy the antient bounds and  
lymitts granted by the charters of the former  
kings, and that we shall seek a new charter  
from the Parliament to that purpose against  
any that intrencht against the rights thereof.”  
This article was referred [August 1652,] to  
the committee of the Navy to consider what  
patent was fit to be granted to the inhabi-  
tants of Virginia. The 7th article was  
“‘ That the people of Virginia have free trade  
as the people of England do enjoy to all  
places and with all nations according to the  
lawes of that commonwealth, and that Vir-  
ginia shall enjoy all priviledges equall with  
any English plantations in America. The  
latter clause was referred to the same com-  
mittee. The 8th article was, “‘ That Virginia  
shall be free from all taxes, customes and im-  
positions whatsoever and none to be imposed  
on them without consent of the Grand As-  
sembly, and soe that neither ffortes nor cas-  
tles bee erected or garrisons maintained,  
without their consent.” This was also refer-
