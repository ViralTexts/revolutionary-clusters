The last papers compleated the view proposed to be taken of the arguments in support of the new and aspiring doctrine, which ascribes to the executive the prerogative of judging and deciding whether there be causes of war or not, in the obligations of treaties; notwithstanding the express provision in the constitution, by which the legislature is made the organ of the national will, on questions whether there be or be not a cause for declaring war. If the answer to these arguments has imparted the conviction which dictated it, the reader will have pronounced, that they are generally superficial, abounding in contradictions, never in the least degree conclusive to the main point, and not unfrequently conclusive against the writer himself: whilst the doctrine—that the powers of treaty and war, are in their nature executive powers—which forms the basis of those arguments, is as indefensible and as dangerous, as the particular doctrine to which they are applied.  
But it is not to be forgotten that these doctrines, though ever so clearly disproved, or ever so weakly defended, remain before the public a striking monument of the principles and views which are entertained and propagated in the community.  
It is also to be remembered, that however the consequences flowing from such premises, may be disavowed at this time or by this individual, we are to regard it as morally certain, that in proportion as the doctrines make their way into the creed of the government, and the acquiescence of the public, every power that can be deduced from them, will be deduced and exercised sooner or later by those who may have an interest in so doing. The character of human nature gives this salutary warning to every sober and reflecting mind. And the history of government, in all its forms and in every period of time, ratifies the danger. A people therefore, who are so happy as to possess the inestimable blessing of a free and defined constitution, cannot be too watchful against the introduction, nor too critical in tracing the consequences, of new principles and new constructions, that may remove the landmarks of power.  
Should the prerogative which has been examined, be allowed in its most limited sense, to usurp the public countenance, the interval would probably be very short, before it would be heard from some quarter or other, that the prerogative either amounts to nothing, or means a right to judge and conclude that the obligations of treaty impose war, as well as that they permit peace. That it is fair reasoning, to say, that if the prerogative exists at all, an operative rather than an inert character ought to be given to it.  
In support of this conclusion, there would be enough to echo, ⟨“that the prerogative in this active sense, is connected with the executive⟩ in various capacities—as the organ of intercourse between the nation and foreign nations—as the interpreter of national treaties” (a violation of which may be a cause of war) “as that power which is charged with the execution of the laws of which treaties make a part—as that power, which is charged with the command and application of the public force.”  
With additional force, it might be said, that the executive is as much the executor as the interpreter of treaties: that if by virtue of the first character it is to judge of the obligations of treaties, it is by virtue of the second, equally authorised to carry those obligations into effect. Should there occur for example, a casus federis, claiming a military co-operation of the United States, and a military force should happen to be under the command of the executive, it must have the same right, as executor of public treaties to employ the public force, as it has in quality of interpreter of public treaties to decide whether it ought to be employed.  
The case of a treaty of peace would be an auxiliary to comments of this sort. It is a condition annexed to every treaty that an infraction even of an important article, on one side extinguishes the obligations on the other: and the immediate consequence of a dissolution of a treaty of peace is a restoration of a state of war. If the executive is “to decide on the obligation of the nation with regard to foreign nations”—“to pronounce the existing condition (in the sense annexed by the writer) of the nation with regard to them; and to admonish the citizens of their obligations and duties as founded upon that condition of things”—“to judge what are the reciprocal rights and obligations of the United States, and of all and each of the powers at war:”—add, that if the executive moreover possesses all powers relating to war not strictly within the power to declare war, which any pupil of political casuistry, could distinguish from a mere relapse into a war, that had been declared: With this store of materials and the example given of the use to be made of them, would it be difficult to fabricate a power in the executive to plunge the nation into war, whenever a treaty of peace might happen to be infringed?  
But if any difficulty should arise, there is another mode chalked out by which the end might clearly be brought about, even without the violation of the treaty of peace; especially if the other party should happen to change its government at the crisis. The executive, in that case, could suspend the treaty of peace by refusing to receive an ambassador from the new government, and the state of war emerges of course.  
This is a sample of the use to which the extraordinary publication we are reviewing, might be turned. Some of the inferences could not be repelled at all. And the least regular of them must go smoothly down with those, who had swallowed the gross sophistry which wrapped up the original dose.  
Every just view that can be taken of this subject, admonishes the public, of the necessity of a rigid adherence to the simple, the received and the fundamental doctrine of the constitution, that the power to declare war including the power of judging of the causes of war is fully and exclusively vested in the legislature: that the executive has no right, in any case to decide the question, whether there is or is not cause for declaring war: that the right of convening and informing Congress, whenever such a question seems to call for a decision, is all the right which the constitution has deemed requisite or proper: and that for such more than for any other contingency, this right was specially given to the executive.  
In no part of the constitution is more wisdom to be found than in the clause which confides the question of war or peace to the legislature, and not to the executive department. Beside the objection to such a mixture of heterogeneous powers: the trust and the temptation would be too great for any one man: not such as nature may offer as the prodigy of many centuries, but such as may be expected in the ordinary successions of magistracy. War is in fact the true nurse of executive aggrandizement. In war a physical force is to be created, and it is the executive will which is to direct it. In war the public treasures are to be unlocked, and it is the executive hand which is to dispense them. In war the honors and emoluments of office are to be multiplied; and it is the executive patronage under which they are to be enjoyed. It is in war, finally, that laurels are to be gathered, and it is the executive brow they are to encircle. The strongest passions, and most dangerous weaknesses of the human breast; ambition, avarice, vanity, the honorable or venial love of fame, are all in conspiracy against the desire and duty of peace.  
  
Hence it has grown into an axiom that the executive is the department of power most distinguished by its propensity to war: hence it is the practice of all states, in proportion as they are free, to disarm this propensity of its influence.  
As the best praise then that can be pronounced on an executive magistrate, is, that he is the friend of peace; a praise that rises in its value, as there may be a known capacity to shine in war: so it must be one of the most sacred duties of a free people, to mark the first omen in the society, of principles that may stimulate the hopes of other magistrates of another propensity, to intrude into questions on which its gratification depends. If a free people be a wise people also, they will not forget that the danger of surprise can never be so great, as when the advocates for the prerogative of war, can sheathe it in a symbol of peace.  
The constitution has manifested a similar prudence in refusing to the executive the sole power of making peace. The trust in this instance also, would be too great for the wisdom, and the temptations too strong for the virtue, of a single citizen. The principal reasons on which the constitution proceeded in its regulation of the power of treaties, including treaties of peace, are so aptly furnished by the work already quoted more than once, that I shall borrow another comment from that source.  
“However proper or safe it may be in a government where the executive magistrate is an hereditary monarch to commit to him the entire power of making treaties, it would be utterly unsafe and improper to entrust that power to an elective magistrate of four years duration. It has been remarked upon another occasion, and the remark is unquestionably just, that an hereditary monarch, though often the oppressor of his people, has personally too much at stake in the government to be in any material danger of being corrupted by foreign powers. But that a man raised from the station of a private citizen to the rank of chief magistrate, possessed of but a moderate or slender fortune, and looking forward to a period not very remote, when he may probably be obliged to return to the station from which he was taken, might sometimes be under temptations to sacrifice his duty to his interest, which it would require superlative virtue to withstand. An avaricious man might be tempted to betray the interests of the state to the acquisition of wealth. An ambitious man might make his own aggrandizement, by the aid of a foreign power, the price of his treachery to his constituents. The history of human conduct does not warrant that exalted opinion of human virtue, which would make it wise in a nation, to commit interests of so delicate and momentous a kind as those which concern its intercourse with the rest of the world, to the sole disposal of a magistrate, created and circumstanced, as would be a President of the United States.”  
I shall conclude this paper and this branch of the subject, with two reflections, which naturally arise from this view of the Constitution.  
The first is, that as the personal interest of an hereditary monarch in the government, is the only security against the temptation incident to a commitment of the delicate and momentous interests of the nation which concern its intercourse with the rest of the world, to the disposal of a single magistrate, it is a plain consequence, that every addition that may be made to the sole agency and influence of the Executive, in the intercourse of the nation with foreign nations, is an increase of the dangerous temptation to which an elective and temporary magistrate is exposed; and an argument and advance towards the security afforded by the personal interests of an hereditary magistrate.  
Secondly, As the constitution has not permitted the Executive singly to conclude or judge that peace ought to be made, it might be inferred from that circumstance alone, that it never meant to give it authority, singly, to judge and conclude that war ought not to be made. The trust would be precisely similar and equivalent in the two cases. The right to say that war ought not to go on, would be no greater than the right to say that war ought to begin. Every danger of error or corruption, incident to such a prerogative in one case, is incident to it in the other. If the Constitution therefore has deemed it unsafe or improper in the one case, it must be deemed equally so in the other case.

THE last papers conjoleated the view pro­  
posed to be taken of the &amp;Y£\iments in  
support of the new and aspiring doctrine,  
which ascribes to the executive the preroga­  
tive of judging aiid deciding whether there  
be caules of war or not, in the obligatipfH of  
treaties; notwithftand&#x27;ng the expi-eis provi.  
lion in the constitution, by which the legiflu  
tui*e is made the organ of the national will,  
on questions whether there be or be not a  
caiiie for declaring war. If the answer to  
th*le arguments has imparted the convi&amp;ion  
which dictated it, the leader will have pro­  
nounced, that they are generally fuperficialj  
abounding in contradictions, never in the .least  
degree conclufrve to the mafn point, and hot  
conclusive against writer  
himfelf: whilfl: the doctrine—-that The&#x27;powers  
of treaty and war, are in their nature exe­  
cutive powers—which forms the basis of those  
arguments, is as indefenfible and as danger­  
ous, as the particular do&amp;rine to which they  
are applied.  
  
But it i&amp;noA to be fotjLPtten that these doc,  
trines, though ever so clearly disproved, or  
ever lo weakly defended, remain before the  
&quot;&quot;public a ft: iking monument of the principles  
and views which are entertained and propa?  
gated in the community.  
  
It is also to be remembered, that however  
the consequences flowing from such premises.  
may be riilavowed at this time or by this in­  
dividual, we are t6 regard it as morally cer­  
tain, chat in proportion as the do&amp;rincs make  
their way into the creed of the government,  
and the acquiescence of the public,every pow­  
er that can be deduced from them, will be de­  
duced and exercised sooner or later by tkofe  
who may have an interest in so doing. The  
•character of human nature giver this falufary  
warning to every sober and refie&amp;ing mind.  
And the history of government, in all its  
forms and in every period of time, ratifies the  
danger. A people therefore, who are so hap­  
py as to poiTefs the rneftimable bleflTng of a  
free and defined conilitution, cannot lie too  
watchful against the introduction, nor too cri­  
tical in tracing the consequences, of new  
principles and new conitru*tions, that may re­  
move t &gt;Ht la lid nrtrrks of f.  
Should the prerogative which has, been exa­  
mined, be allowed in its molt limited sense, to?  
usurp the public countenance, the interval  
would probably be very {hort, before it would  
be heard from some quarter or other, that the  
prerogative either amounts to nothing, or  
means a right to judge and conclude that the  
obligations of treaty impose war, as well as  
that they permit peace. That it is fair rea­  
soning, to fay, that if the prerogative exists  
at all, an operative rather than ail inert charac­  
ter ought to be given to it.  
  
lii support of this conclusion, there would  
be enough to echo, 44 tl)at the prerogative in  
this adtivs sense, is conoe&lt;sted with the execu­  
tive in various capacities—as the organ of  
intercourse between the nation and foreign  
nations—as the interpreter of national trea­  
ties&quot; (a violation of which may be a cause of  
■war) uas that power which js charged with  
the execution of the laws of which treaties  
make a part—as that power, which is charg­  
ed with the command and application of the public  
Jorcc  
With additional force, it might he laid, that  
the executive is as much the executor ai the  
i»t:rpreter of treaties: that if by virtue of  
theJirJi chara&amp;er it is to judge of the obliga­  
. tions of treaties, it is by virtue of the fecond&gt;  
equally authorised to carry tho.&#x27;e obligations  
into, ejfecl. Sliould there occur for example, a  
*aJ~u&gt; Jcderisx claiming a military co-operation  
©t the United States, and a military for.ee  
(hould happen to be under the command of  
executive, it must have the fame right,  
as executw of public treaties tr&gt; employ the public  
£»&#x27; ce, as it has in quality of interpreter of pub.  
he treaties to decide whether it ought to be cm.  
ployed.  
  
The cafe of a treaty of peace would be an  
auxiliary to comments of this fort. I;t is a  
■condition annexed to every treaty that an  
anfra&amp;ion even of an important article, on  
°ne fide extinguishes the obligations on the  
other: and the immediate consequence of a  
dissolution of a treaty of peace is a restora­  
tion of a (tare of war. If the executive is &quot;to  
decide on the obligation of the nation with  
regard to foreign rations&quot;—-4i to p von ounce  
the txijling condition (in the sense annexed by  
tlie writci} of the nation with regard to  
them ; and to admonilh the citizens of their  
&#x27;obligations and duties as founded upon that  
condition of things&quot;—&quot; to judge what are the  
reciprocalrioht* and obligations of the United  
-States, and of ali and each of the powers at  
Tvar •&#x27; —add, that if the executive moreover  
Jfc)fTei7es all powers relating to war vctJlr &#x27;tQly  
within the power to dcciarc mar, which any pu­  
p*l of political casuistry, could diftinguifti  
from, a raero xcUiffe into a war, that hedbttn  
*tcbined r With this {lore of materials and the  
example j*iven of the use to be made of them,  
&quot;would it be difficult to fabricate a power in  
the executive ;o phmjre the nation into war,  
  
Saturday, September 14, 1795.  
  
  
wherever .1 treaty of peace might happen to  
be infringed ?  
But if any tl flicnlty fliouTfl a,rife, there is  
another mode charked put by which the end  
might clearly he brought about, even without  
the violation o&gt;f the treaty of peace ; especi­  
ally if t,he other party should* happep to change  
its governmeju at the crisis. The executive,  
in that cale, could ftfpcnd the treaty of peace  
by rrfufnig to receive an aribajj&#x27;idur si oni the &gt;iitr  
government, and the State of war civ?+#&gt; \f  
courfc.  
This is a fampleof the ijfe to which the  
extraordinary publication we are reviewini,  
might be turned. Some of the inferences  
could not be repelled at all. And the teaft  
regulav of them must go Imoothly down with  
those, who h:d fXvallowed the gwfs sophistry  
~ which wrapped up t-he original dole.  
  
view t!&gt;at Gan be taken of this  
fubjeft, adin-&gt;n.iflies the public, of the i.eccf­  
fity of a rigid adherence to the tfinple, tlie re­  
ceived and the fundamental dodtrini? of the  
confti tat ion, that the power to declare war  
including the power of judging of rhe icauffes  
of war isjuliy a-nd xxcfufneh vested in the le­  
giflatufe : tbar the.pjcet utive has no right, in  
any cafe to decide the q.ieftion, whether there  
is or is not cause for declaring war : that the  
right of informing &#x27;ConfrreT&#x27;;,  
whenever such a q\reflion seems to call for a  
decision, is all the /ightwhich the corftitution  
has deemed requisite or proper • and that for  
such more than for any other contingency,  
this right was fpecialiy &lt;&gt;;iven to the execu­  
tive.  
  
In no part of the eotiflifusion is more wis­  
dom to be found than in the clause which con­  
hdqs the que ft i«n of war or peace to the le­  
giflatuie, and pot to the executive depart­  
ment. Beside the objection to such, a fixture  
of heterogeneous powers : the trust and the  
temptation would t e too great for any one  
man : not such as nature may offer as the  
prodigy of many centuries, but such as may  
be expe&amp;ed jn the ordinary fiicc&lt;/fions of ma­  
gi ftracy, \V#r is in fact the true uurfe of  
executive ag: audizement. In war a plfyifTcal  
force is to&#x27;be created, and it is the executive  
will which is to d&#x27;we-ft it. In war the public  
treasures. are to be unlocked, and it is the ex­  
ecutive-band whic&#x27;:. i.s to difptijfe them. . In  
war the honors and .emoluments of office are  
to be multiplied ; and it is the executive pa­  
tronage under which they are to be enjoyed.  
It is in war, finally, that laurels are to be*ga|  
theied, and it is the executive brow they  
to enxircle. The flji ongbfl: paflions, and mcft  
dangerous weaknefTes of the human breast ;  
avarice, vanity, the honorable or  
venial love of lame, aie all in confpiracy&#x27;a­  
gainft the desire and duty of peace.  
  
Hence it has grown into an axiom that the  
executive is the department of power most  
diftinguifhed&#x27;by its propensity to war : hence  
it is the p raft ice of all dates, in proportion  
as they aie free, to disarm this propertfity of  
its influence.  
  
As the bed praise then that can be pronoun­  
ced on an executive magiftrr.tr, is, that he  
is the friend of* peace ; a praise that fifes in  
its value, as there may be .» known capacity  
to (hine in war: so it mull be one of the molt  
sacred duties of a free people, to mark the  
firlt omen in the society, of principles that  
may ftimnlate the hopes of other magistrates  
of another propensity, to intrude into qi:ef­  
tions on which its gratification depends. If  
a free people lie a wife people alio, they will  
not forget that the danger of surprise can  
never be so great, as when the advocates for  
the prerogative of war, can iheatlie it in a  
symbol of peace.  
The constitution has manifefted a fmiilar  
prudence in refufing to the executive the Jole  
power of making peace, The trust in this  
instance also, would be too great for the wis­  
dom, and the temptations too ftroug.fnr the  
virtue, of a fugle citizen. The principal  
real&#x27;ons on which the constitution proceeded  
in its regulation ot the power of treaties, in­  
cluding treaties of peace, are so aptly fur­  
nidled by the work alrecdy quoted more than  
once, that I fliall borrow another comment  
from that source.  
  
&quot;However proper or fafe it may be in a  
;ovenuncnt where the executive magistrate  
s an hereditary monarch to commit to h;m  
tie entire power of making treaties, it wouM  
&gt;e utterly unfafe and improper to entrust that  
lower to an elective magistrate of four years  
Juration. It has been remarked upon ano­  
ther occasion, and the remark is ququeftinna­  
biv jufV, that an hereditary monarch, though  
of&#x27;ei the onprefTor of his people, has person­  
ally too much at stake in the government to  
be in aov material danger of being corniced  
bv foreign powers. But that a man raised  
frora the Ration of a private citizen to the rank  
us chief magistrate, pol&amp;tl&#x27;ed of but a mode­  
rate or slender fnitune, »nd looking forward  
to a period not very remote, when he may  
probably be obliged to return to the Hation  
from which he was taken, might ftmetimes  
be under temptations ta faerjficr hi* duty to  
his interest, which it would require fnperla­

magtftrate, created and circnmftanced, as  
would be a PrefuJent of the United States.&quot;  
  
I Hull conclude this paper and this branch  
of the (uhjeft, with two reflexions, which na­  
turally arise from this view of the Conftitn­  
tiojj.  
  
The firft is, that as the pcrfonal interest of  
t an hereditary monarch in the government, is  
the only security against the temptation ihci­  
! dent: to a commitment of the delicate and  
\ momentous interests of the nation which con­  
| cerri itr intercom f w.th the reft of the world,  
to the disposal ofafmgle ma gift rate, it is a  
plain consequence, that every addition that  
may he made 10 the ycwV,agenpy arid influence  
of&#x27;the Executive, in the iutercouefe of the «a­  
tf#n with foreign nations, is an increase of  
the dangerous temptation to wh&#x27;ch an dcft &#x27;tve  
avc temporary magistrate is expoi&#x27;ed ; and an  
argument andadvance towards the security af­  
forded by the per Tonal interefiis of&#x27;dnhereditary  
magistrate.  
Secondljv As the confiltution has not per­  
mitted the Executive finkfi to conclude ar  
judge that peace oug&#x27;it to be made, it   
be interred from that circuirftancfr alone,  
that it never meant to-»iveit jtrrg/y,  
to judge and co.nckufe&#x27; that war ought not to  
be made. The trull would be precifcly iin.i­  
lar and equivalent in the two cases. The  
right to fay that wir nfcght riot to go on,  
would be no greater than the right to fay that  
war ought to begin. Every danger of  
error or corruption, incident to Juch a prerd  
gative in one cafe* is incident to it in .the  
other. If the Constitution therefore has  
deemed it unfafe or improper in the one cafe,  
it must be deemed equally so in the other  
cafe. &#x27; HELVIDIUS

not to regard it as morally certain, that

all those leading individuals who may

warning to every sober and reflecting

in all its forms, and in every period of

Executive aggrandizement. In war a physical force is to be created, and it  
is the Executive will which is to direct it. In war the public treasures are  
to be unlocked, and it is the Executive hand which is to dispense them. In  
war the honors and emoluments of office are to be multiplied, and it is the  
Executive patronage under which they are to be enjoyed. It is in war,  
finally, that laurels are to be gathered, and it is the Executive brow they

the human’ breast,—-ambition, avarice, vanity, the honorable or venial love  
of fame,—are all in conspiracy against the desire and the duty of peace.  
Hence it has grown into an axiom, that the Executive is the department of  
power most distinguished by its propensity to war; hence it is the practice  
of all states, in proportion as they are free, to disarm this propensity of its  
influence.’—Such is the noble testimony which was borne by one of the  
fathers of our country, half a century ago, to the anti-republican tendencies  
of war. And it is of this ‘‘ true nurse of Executive aggrandizement,’”’ that  
gentlemen are so continually crying, ‘ let it come!’ Such a cry is not only  
inconsistent with sound republicanism and true morality, but it is to the last  
degree puerile. I intend no disrespect to any gentleman who hears me

&quot;War is, in fact the true nurse of Executive  
aggrandizement. In war a physical force is to be  
created, and it is the Executive will which is to  
direct it. in war the public treasures are to be  
unlocked, and it is the Executive hand which is  
to dispense them. In war the honors and the c­  
molurnents of office are to be multiplied, and it is  
the Executive patronage under which they are to  
be enjoyed. It is in war, finally, that laurels are  
to be gathered, and it is the Executive brow they  
are to encircle. The strongest passions and the  
most dangerous weaknesses of the human breast  
ambition, avarice, vanity, the honorable or ve­  
nial love of fame are all in conspiracy against  
the desire and tho duty of peace.  
&quot;Hence it has grown into an axiom that the  
Executive is the department of power most distin  
guished by its propensity to war ; hence it is the  
practice of all Stales, in proportion as they are  
free, to disarm this propensity of its influence.

I beg to call your attention to a phrase of two, which I  
would commend to the consideration of modern democracy.  
&quot; Every just view that can be taken of this subject, tul  
monishes the public of the necessity of a rigid adherence tr  
the simple, the received, and the fundamental doctrine ol  
the constitution, that the power to declare war, including  
the power of judging of the causes of war, is fully and exclusively  
vested m the legislature ; that the Executive hat  
no right, in any case, to decide the question whether there  
: is or is not cause for declaring war: that the right of con  
vening and informing Congress, whenever such a question  
seems to call for a decision, is all the right which the constitution  
has deemed requisite or proper; and that lor such,  
more thnn for any other contingency, this right was specially  
given to the Executive.  
1 &quot; In 110 part of the constitution is more wisdom to be  
found than in the clause which confides the question ol  
? war or peace to the legislature, anil not to the executive de&#x27;  
partment. Besides the objection to such a mixture of he  
terogeneous powers, the trust and the temptation would be  
, too great for any one man; not sucli as nature may odor as  
j the prodigy of many centimes, but such as may be expect.  
od in the ordinary successions of magistracy. War is in  
fact the true nurse of Executive aggrandizement. In  
war, it physical force is to be created; and it is the executive  
will which is to direct it. In wnr, the public  
tren?urcs are to lie unlocked; and it Is the Executive  
hand which is to dispense them. In war, the honors  
and emoluments of olfici- are to be multiplied ; and itis  
the Executive patronage under which they are to be enjoyed.  
It is in war, finally, that laurels are to lie gatliereil;  
and it is tho Executive brow they aro to encircle. The  
strongest passions, and most dangerous weaknesses of the

-The Executive and Congress. — It belongs to  
the Exxutivs to manage the war with Mexico. The  
supreme legislative power declared war to exist, and  
henceforwards it was the duty of the Executive to  
wage the war with all such means as the Constitu-

then, he found these measures inadequate, and ap-  
plied to Congress for other measures, HIS WILL  
should have been immediately complied with, unless it

ade the Constitution of the Repub-  
lice? Does every high and holy consideration demand the  
cultivation of peace with all nations? Were | to refer to  
the solicitude of our fathers on this subject, | should point  
first to the Constitution, which has stripped the Executive  
of all power over the subject of war, and authorised Con-  
gress only to publish to the world the existence of hostili-  
ties. ‘They saw the dangers that would attend the grant-  
ing of power to a single man, on this subject, especially  
when that man was strongly endowed with the military  
propensity. On this point, hear Madison:  
  
“In no part of the Constitution is more wisdom to be found, than  
in the clause which confides the question of war or peace to the  
legislature, and not to the executive department. Beside the ob-  
  
jection of such a mixture of heterogeneous powers, the trust and  
  
the temptation would be too great for any one man. * * War  
is, in fact, the true nurse of executive aggrandisement. In war, a  
physical force is to be created, and it is the executive will which is

it is the executive hand which is to dispense them. In war, the  
honours and emoluments of office are to be multiplied, and it is the  
executive patronage under which they are to be enjoyed. It is in  
war, finally, that laurels are to be gathe red, and it is the executive  
brow they are to encircle. The strongest passions, and the most  
dangerous weaknesses of the human  breast—ambition, avarice,  
vanity, the honourable or venial love of fame—are all in conspira-  
cy against the desire and duty of peace. Hence, it has grown into  
an axiom, that the executive is the department of power most dis-  
tinguished by its propensity to war; hence, it is the practice of all  
  
States, in proportion as they are free, to disarm this propensity of  
  
its influence.  
  
** As the best praise, then, that can be pronounced on an execu-  
live magistrate, is, that he is the friend of peace; a praise that rises  
in its value, as there may be a known capacity to shine in war; so  
it must be one of the most sacred duties of a free people, to mark

~44 In no part of the constitution ? more wisdom  
4 to be found than in the eliuse whcli confides the  
4 question of war or peace to the legislative, and not  
4 to the executive department. B?sides the objec­  
4 tion to such a mixture of heterogeneous powers,  
4 the trust and the temptation would be too great  
lfor any one man ; not such as nature may offer  
4 as the prodigy of many centur.es, but such aa  
4 may be expccted in the ordina-y.successions ol  
4 magistracy, fl ar is in fact the true nurse of  
4 Executive aggrandizement. In war, a physical  
4 lorce is to be created; and it is the Executive  
4 will which is to direct it. In war, the public  
4 treasures are to be unlocked, and it is the Execn­  
4 live hand which is to dispense .hem. In war, the  
4 honors and emoluments of office are to be tnulti­  
4 plied; and it is the Executive patronage under  
4 which they are to be enjoyed. It is in war, final­  
4 ly, that laurels are to be gathered ; and it is the  
4 Kxecutive brow they arc to encircle. The strong­  
4 est passkms and most dangerous weaknesses of  
4 the human breast?ambition, avarice, vanity?-the  
4 honorable or venial love of fame, are all in con­  
? spiracy against the desire ?rd duty of peace.  
44 Hence it has grown into an axiom that the  
4 Executive is the department of power most dis­  
4 tingvished by its propensity to war : hence it is  
4 the practice of all States, in proportion as they  
4 are free, to disarm this propensity of ii?{infhiencc.  
44 As THE BEST PRAISE, THEN, THAT CAN BE PRO­  
4 NOUNCED ON AN EXECUTIVE MAOISTRATE, IS THAT  
4 HE IS THE FRIEND OF PEACE?A PRAISE THAT RISES  
4 IN ITS VALUE AS THF.kE MAT BE A KNOWN CAPACITY  
4 TO SHINE IN WAR SO IT MUST BE ONE OF THE  
4 MOST SACRED DUTIES OF A FREE PEOPLE TO MARK  
4 THE FIRST OMEN IN THE SOCIETY OF principles  
4 THAT MAY STIMULATE THE HOPES OF OTHER Ma­  
4 OISTRATES OF ANOTHER propensity TO INTRUDE  
4 INTO QI&#x27;KSTIONS ON WHICH ITS ORAT&#x27;FICATION l?E­  
4 pends. If a free people be a wise people also,  
4 they will not forget that the danger of surprise can  
4 never be so great as when the advocates for the  
4 prerogative of war can sheath it in a symbol of  
4 peace.&quot;  
Much of this would seem to have been written  
with a retrospective ami complimentary allusion to

persed the very body that made them, and  
of the noblest and best of her citizens,  
pandered to the ambition of Casar, their  
leader, and aided him in sapping the foun-  
dation of the Republic, and  
nd enslaving the  
people.  
It is in time of war, particularly, that  
the strength of the Executive, command-  
er-in-chief, is magnified, and danger re  
 sults from his superabundance of power.  
This is thus graphically portrayed by Mr.  
Madison in his fourth letter over the sig­  
nature of Helvidius: &quot;War is in fact the  
true nurse of executive aggrandizement.  
In war a physical force is to be created;  
and it is the executive will which is to di-  
rect it. In war the public treasuries are  
to be unlocked; and it is the executive  
hand which is to dispense them. In war  
the honors and emoluments of office are  
to be multiplied; and it is the executive  
patronage under which they are to be en­  
joyed. It is in war, finally, that laurels  
are to be gathered; and it is the execu­  
tive brow they are to encircle. The  
strongest passions and most dangerous  
weakness of the human breast, ambition,  
avarice, vanity, the honorable or venial  
love of fame, are all in conspiracy against  
the design and duty of peace.&quot;  
&quot;Hence it has grown into an axiom that  
the executive is the department of power  
  
most distinguished by its propensity to wield his patronage as to secure his ele  
war; hence it is the practice of all States,tion for a second term, who so blind at  
in proportion as they are free, to disarm o to e ta o ea ene e i  
this propensity of its influence. If a freehave less difficulty in securing his election
