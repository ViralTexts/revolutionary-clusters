r Howell  
Philadelphia Augt 18th 1793  
  
Your letter of the 14th inst: and enclosures came duly to hand.  
I am glad to hear you had a fine rain on the thursday preceeding the date of your letter; even if the Corn should receive no benefit from it; because it would put the ground in good condition for the reception of Wheat. I hope it was followed by another good rain on wednesday night last. at this place it rained the whole night.  
I want to make an experimt with respect to taking the tops from Corn before the usual time. I know that if the tops of a whole field was taken off before the dust has fallen, so as to impregnate the grain, that there will be no Corn; but as soon as this function is performed, the tops, in my opinion, serve only to participate in the nutriment which otherwise would be more abundant for what remained. I believe also, as the dust from the Tassel impregnates equally with its own, all the Corn (through the tubes of the Silk) it falls upon; that if every other Row, throughout a whole field⟨,⟩ was deprived of the tops the Corn would, notwithstanding, be equally good; and this is the experiment (although it is late for it) I want to have made. Tell Mr Crow therefore, that it is my desire that he would, immediately, cut the tops from every other row of Corn in No. 5 to the amount of 20—beginning on the side next to No. 2, by the Barn. Let the first row retain the tops—the second then, 4, 6 &amp; so on, alternately to the 40th to loose them. He need not go beyond the old ditch which, formerly, divided the fields. Particular care must be taken to cut the tops above the second joint—that is above the  one from whence the Corn proceeds. Experiments of this sort are easily made, &amp; without risk or expence; and the result may be important. I do not mean that the blades are also to be taken off; for this might expose the stalks to the Sun—stop the circulation of the Juices—and of course injure the grain.  
What arrangement has the Overseers made for exchanging their Wheat? &amp; of what kinds does each sow—agreeably to my former directions to them? The Barley from hence has been delayed beyond my expectation—the Vessel by which I intended to have sent it, having sailed sooner than was expected. I do not suppose now, it can go earlier than in Ellwood. But as soon as it is received it must be sown, in order to give it an equal chance in point of season. whether to begin on the Contra sides of the fields, which are sowing with wheat at the time of its arrival, or otherwise, I scarcely know, at this distance, how to direct. I would wish it to have neither better nor worse ground than what is allotted for Wheat, and it would appear odd to have it in the middle of a field of this grain—The Overseers, knowing what my design is, must dispose of it in the best manner they can to answer it.  
Mr Lear insists upon it, that he put the Clover seed (in a cask containing about 7 bushls) into the Store himself on the left hand of the Door. If it is not to be found there, you may tell Mr Butler I shall look to him for the va⟨lu⟩e of it, unless he can discover what is gone with it. The reason I had it put into the Store was for safety; &amp; he will find by the written instructions I left with him, that the key of that house was not to remain in his posession longer than whilst he was in the act of giving things out. If the Clover seed then is not there, Butler must have disposed of it himself or, by retaining the key in his possession, contrary to orders, given the roguest people about the house an opportunity to come at it—in which case, as I have observed in a former letter, there can be no doubt of their taking everything else that was saleable.  
If no clover seed was gathered before you found the rake, or Comb, was not both seed &amp; clover lost by standing too long? &amp; why this, ask Butler, when both are so essential to my wants? Is the Clover, which by the report, is brought from the Oat field at Dogue Run that which was sown last Spring? If so was it Rank enough to cut?  
  
I do in earnest terms enjoin it upon you to see that the Hay is used with the greatest œconomy, at Mansion Ho.—and particularly to guard against Mrs F. Washingtons Charles &amp; her boy in the Stable; both of whom are impudent &amp; self willed, &amp; care not how extravagantly they feed, or even waste; for I have caught the boy several times littering his horse with hay. Except her blind horse (which may be endangered by running at large) I see no sort of necessity there is for feeding the other with either grain or hay, when they are not used: or any other horse that is at liberty, &amp; able to provide for itself. Those that are kept constantly in the house—constantly at work—or under the Saddle must be fed, or they would perish. I can plainly perceive, that in a little time [(]after saving what Oats I want for Seed another year) there will be nothing either for my negroes or horses to eat; witho⟨ut⟩ buying; which will neither comport with my interest or inclination. By Stuarts report I find he still continues to feed horses with Corn instead of cut Oats as I directed. What two saddle horses are those which stand in the Mansion house Report? I know of none but the one which Mr Whitting used to ride.  
Has Mr Stuart received any aid in getting in his Wheat? and have you, as I directed sometime ago, furnished him with plow beasts in place of those which he says have Colts, and are unable to work; &amp; the other tw⟨o⟩—one of which, according to his acct cannot, &amp; the other will not work? Those which cannot, or will not work had better be turned out for breeders, &amp; their places supplied out of the Brood Mares; and those which have colts, ought to be favored. As to having their hearts broke, I do not wonder at it, considering how they are treated; &amp; I fear rode of nights.  
I see by the Report respecting the Ditchers, that one of them is working at Union farm in the room of Cupid; but no mention is made of the latter, whether Sick, absent, or dead. Consider always, that these reports are intended for information; &amp; ought therefore to be plain and correct—one part should always corrispond or at least not be inconsistent with, another part—In the Mansion house report you make Godfrey sick Six days—(which is the whole week)—and yet, he appears to be engaged in business some part of the Week. I mention these matters not with a view to find fault, but to shew you the advantages of correctness; and, as you are a young man just advancing into life &amp; business,  to impress you with the propriety &amp; importance of giving attention, and doing whatever you undertake, well.  
How does the Potatoes at the Mansion house look? Let the Ground be kept clean &amp; in fine order—that is well pulverised not only at top, but to a sufficient depth for grass.  
Unless Isaac is engaged about things, the execution of which cannot be delayed, order him, and whoever is with him, to join Thos Green; and the whole of them to stick to the Barn at Dogue Run until it is compleated. It appears to me that the whole, or greatest part of the time of these people, is employed about one nonsensical job or another; which is the very thing Green is delighted with, as they afford him a pretext to be idle or to be employed in matters which more immediately relate to himself—I wish this may not be the case also with Isaac, as I find he is very desirous of getting by himself always. When I said the whole were to be employed at the New Barn at Dogue run, I did not mean to leave the Dormant windows in the Stable (both back and front) unfinished as they have been begun; which would not have been the case if I could have conceived they would have taken half, or even a quarter of the time they have. In front of the Stable I ordered two; one on each side of the Pedement, dividing the space equally between the latter, &amp; the ends of the house.  
Davis, any more than the Carpenters, ought not to be taken from the above work for every little trifle that might as well be done by that lazy scound⟨r⟩el Charles; who might as well be employed in white washing, Painting, or putting up Bedsteads, as to take Green or him, for these purposes. Idleness will be his ruin, for I have no conception of his employing himself otherwise than idly; &amp; when this is the case besides the bad example it sets to others, he will be in mischief, or makin⟨g⟩ a disturbance in the family.  
I do not recollect telling you, in any of my letters, that the Rheam of writing Paper which went by Ellwood, was for the purpose of supplying the Overseers &amp;ca with Paper to make their reports on—Give each (if you have not already done it) a quire; and let them know that it is to be applied to this purpose only.  
I did not expect an accurate account of the Hogs from the Overseers at this time. But if they do not keep a pretty good eye to them, themselves, I shall have but a flemish account of them when they are called for as Porkers.  
  
I see by the Mill report for the last week, 23 bushels of Meal was brought to the Mansion house, when the usual quantity for that place is 20 bushels—why was this done? If 30 bushels was brought there it would, I am persuaded be consumed, or otherwise disposed of in the week. Your Aunt &amp; all here are well &amp; I am Your Affecte Uncle

Dear Sir*»Your letter of the I4tb  
indt-i and,enclosures, eapie duly, to hand.  
I am glad to hear yon l»ad a fine rain  
on the Thursday proceeding th«* date of  
your tarter, even yf the corn should^ re­

this is ihe e x pe ri m e nt ( alt hough it is late

them. He need hot go beyond the old  
ditch which formerly divided the fields.  
Particular care must be taken to cut the  
tope above the second joint, that is above,  
the one frond where the Writ prooeeds.~  
Experimenta of this Sort are easily made.1  
and without risk or expense, and the re­  
sult rosy be iniporUtit. I do not mean  
that the blades are also to be taken off,

Philadelphia, August ISth, 1703.  
Dear llowcll : Your letter of the  
14th inst., and enclosures, came duly to  
hand.  
I am glad to hear you had a Gno rain  
on ilio Thursday preceding the dato of  
your letter, even if the corn should re­  
ceive no benefit from it, because it would  
put the ground in good condition for tue  
reception of wheat. I hope it was fol­  
lowed by another good rain on Wednes­  
day night last. At this place it rained  
the whole night.  
I want to make an experiment with  
respect to taking the tops from corn be­  
fore the usual lime. I know that if the  
tops of a whole field w?ro taken oil* be­  
fore the dust has fallen, so as to impreg­  
nate the grain, that there will Le no  
corn; but as so as this function is per­  
formed, the tops, in my opinion, serve  
only to participate in Ilio nutriment  
which otherwise would be more abun­  
dant for what remained. I believe, also,  
as the dust from the tassel impregnates  
equally with its own, all tuo corn  
(through tbc tubes of tbc silk) it fulls  
upon, that if every other row, through­  
out a whole field, was deprived of the  
tops, the corn, notwithstanding, would  
be equally good ; aud this is the experi­  
ment, although it is lato for it, that I  
want to have made. Tell Mr. Crow,  
therefore, that it is my desire that ho  
would immediately cut the tops from  
every other row of corn in No. 5, to the  
amount of twenty, beginning on tbo side  
next to No. 2, by the barn. Let the  
first row retain the tons ; the second, 4,  
G, and so ou alternately to the 40th, to  
lose them. He need not go beyond the  
old ditch which formerly divided the  
fields. Particular care must bo taken to  
cut the tops above the second joint, that  
is, above the one from where the corn  
proceeds. Experiments of this sort are  
easily made, and without risk or cx­  
fense ; and the result may be important,  
do not mean that the blades nre also to  
be taken off, for this might expose the  
stalk to the sun, stop the circulation of  
the juice, and ol course injure the grain.  
What arrangements have the over­  
seers made for exchanging their wheat,  
and of what kinds does each sow agree­  
ably to my former directions to them?  
The barley from hence, has been delayed  
beyond my expectation?tbo vessel by  
which I intended to have sent it, having  
sailed sooner than was expected. I do  
not suppose now, it can go earlier than  
in El I wood. Hut as soon as it io re­  
ceived, it must be sown, in order to give  
it an equal chance in point of season.  
Whether to b??gin on the contra side of  
the fields which are sowing with wheat  
at the time of ils arrival or otherwise, I  
scarcely know, at this distauce, how lo  
direct. I would wish it to have neither  
better nor worse ground than what is  
allowed foi wheat, and it would appear  
odd to have it in the middle of a field  
of this grain. The overseers, knowing  
what my design is, must dispose of it in  
the best manner they can to answer it.  
Mr. Lear insists upon it, that be put  
the clover seed (in a casis containing  
about 7 bushels) into the sturo himself  
on the left hand of the door. If it is  
not to bo found there, you may tell Mr.  
Butler I shall look to him for the value  
of it, unless he can discover what is gone  
with it. The reason I had it put into  
the store was for safety ; and lie will  
find, by the written instructions I left  
with him, that the key of that house was  
not to remain in bis possession longer  
than whilst be was in the act of giving  
things out. If the clover seed, then, is  
not there, Butler must have disposed of  
it hi nisei/, or by retaining the key in his  
possession, contrary to my orders, give  
the roguish people about the bouse an  
opportunity to come at it ; in which case,  
as I have observed in a former letter,  
there cau be no doubt of their taking  
evn-y thing else that was saleable. If  
no clover seed was gathered before you  
found the rake or comb, were not both  
eeed aud clover lost by standing too  
long? And why this, ask Butler, when  
both arc so essential to ray wants. Is  
the clover which, by the report, is  
brought from tbo oat fields at Dogue  
Run, that which was sown last spring?  
If so, was it rank enough to cut?  
I do, in earnest terms, enjoin it upon  
you to sec that the haj i9 used with the  
greatest economy at Mansion He?and  
particularly, to guard against Mrs.  
Washington&#x27;s Charles and her boy in  
the stable, both of whom are impudent  
and self-willed, and care not bow extrav­  
agantly they feed, or even waste, for I  
have caught the boy several times litter­  
ing bis liorses with bay. Except her  
blind horse, (which may be codau­  
gered by running at large) I see no sort  
of necessity there is for feeding the other  
with either grain or bay, when they are  
not used, or any other horse that is at  
liberty and able to provide for itself;  
tboso that are kept constantly in the  
bouse, constantly at work, or under the  
saddle, must be fed, or they would per­  
ish. I can plainly perceive that in a  
little time, (after saving what oats I  
want for seed another year) there will  
bo nothing cither for my negroes or hor­  
ses to eat, without buying, which will  
neither comport with my interest or in­  
clination. By Stuart&#x27;s report, I find he  
still continues to feed horses with corn  
instead of cut oats, as I directed. What  
two saddle horses are those which stand  
in the Mansion House Report? I know  
of none but the one which Mr. Whit­  
ting used to ride.  
Has Mr. Stuart received any aid in  
ge&#x27;ting io bis wheat? and have you, as  
  
1 directed sometime ago, furnished Lim  
with plow boasts in piuco of those which  
he says have coles, ami aro uiinblo to  
work : and the other two, one of which,  
according to his account, cannot, and  
the other will not work? Those which  
caunot, or will not work, had better be  
turned out for breeders, and their places  
supplied out ot tho brood marcs?and  
those which have colts ought to bo fa­  
vored. As to having their hearts bro­  
ken, i do not wonder at it, considering |  
how they are treated, aud I fear rode of  
nights.  
I see by the report respecting tho  
ditchers, that one of them is working at  
Union Farm, in tho room of Cupid ; but  
no mention is made of tho latter, wheth­  
er tick, abietti or dead. Consider always  
that these reports are intended for in­  
formation, and ought, therefore to be  
plain unii correct: one part should al­  
ways correspond, or at least not be in­  
consistent with another part. In the  
Mansion House Report you make God­  
frcy sick six days, (which is the whole  
week) and yet he appears to be engaged  
in business somo part of tho week. I  
mention these matters not with a view to  
lind fault, but to show you tho advan­  
tages of correctness ; and as you nro a  
ouug mau, just advancing into life and  
usin?es, to impress you with the propri­  
ety and importance of giving attention  
and doing whatever you undertake well.  
How do the potatoes at the Mansion  
House look? Let tho ground bo kept  
clean and in fine order?that is well pul­  
verised not only at top, but toasuflicient  
depth for grass.  
Unless Isaac is engaged about things,  
the execution of which cannot ho de­  
layed, order him and whoever is with  
him, toj?in Thos. Green, and the whole  
of them to stick to tho b ira nt Dogue  
Run until it is completed. It appears to  
mo that the whole or greatest part of the  
time of these people, is employed about  
one nonsensical job or another, which is  
the very thing Circo:? i? delighted with,  
as they all&#x27;uni him a pretext to be idle or  
to bo employed in matters which more  
immediately relato to himself. I wish  
this may not be the case also with Isaac,  
as I find he is very desirous of getting  
by himself always. When I said the  
whole were to be employed at the now  
barn at Duguo Kun, I did not mean to  
leave tho dormant windows in the etablo  
(both back and front) unfinished, as they  
have been begun, which woald not have  
been the case if i could have conceived  
they would have taken half, or oven a  
quarter of the timo they have. In front  
of the stables I ordered two, one on each  
side of the pedement, dividing the space  
equally between the latter and the ends  
of the house.  
Davis, any nn re than the carpenters,  
ought not to be taken from the above  
work for every little trifle that might as  
well bo done by that lazy scoundrel,  
Charles, who might as well bo employed  
in white-washing, painting or putting up  
bedsteads as to take Green or biro for  
these purposes. Idleness will be li in  
ruin, for I have no conception of his em­  
ploying himself otherwise than idly ;  
and when this is the case, besides tuo  
bad example it sets to others, he will bo  
in mischief or making a disturbance in  
yo family.  
I do not recollect telling you in any of  
my letters, that the Kbeam of writing  
paper which went by Ellwood, was for  
the purpose of supplying tho overseers,  
&amp;c., with paper to make their reports on.  
Give each (it you have not already done  
it) a quire, and let them know that it is  
to bo applied to this purpose only.  
I did not expect an accurate account  
of the Hogs from the Overseers at this  
time ; but if they do not keep a pretty  
good eye to them themselves, I shall  
have but a flemish account of them when  
they are called for as porkers.  
I see by the mill report, for the last  
week, 23 bushels of meal was brought to  
tho Mansion iiouue, when the usual  
quantity for that placo is 20 bushels.  
Why was this done? If 30 bushels was  
brought them it would, I am persuaded,  
be consumed, or otherwise disposed of  
in tho week.  
Your Auut and all here are well, and  
I am your atfecto uncle,  
G. Washington
