Extract nf a letter from General Washington, dated 14th  
November, 1779.  
&quot;I have one objection to the Canada project, untouched  
in my publie letter, which is, in my estimation, insurmounta­  
ble, and claims all ray feelings for the true and permanent in­  
terest of our country. This is, the introduction of a large  
body of French troops into Canada, and putting them into  
possession of the capital of that province, attached to them by  
the ties of blood, habits, manners, religion, and former con­  
nexions of Government. I fear this would be too great ..  
temptation to be resisted by any Power actuated by the com­  
mon maxims of national policy. Canada would be a solid  
acquisition to France on all accounts ; and because of the nu­  
merous inhabitants, subjects to her by inclination, w ho would  
aid in preserving it under her power against the attempt of  
any other, Franco, it is apprehended, would have it in her  
power to give law to these States.  
&quot; Let us suppose that when the five thousand troops (un­  
der the idea of that number twice as many might be intro­  
duced) were entered into the city of Quebec, they should de­  
clare an intention to hold Canada as a pledge and surety for  
the debts due to France by tha United State*. It is u maxim,  
founded on the universal experience of mankind, that no na­  
tion is to be trusted farther than it is bound by its interests ;  
and no prudent statesman or politician will venture to depart  
from it. If France should even engage in the scheme in the  
first instance with the purest intentions; invited by circum­  
stances, she could alter her views. As the Marquis clothed  
his proposition when he spoke of it to me, it would seem to  
originate wholly from himself,- but it is not impossible thai  
it had its birth in the Cabinet of France, and was put into

navy, and none more capable of extension and  
development.&quot; And Mr. Rodet affirmed  
that &quot;without the resources which were found  
in the sailors engaged in the fisheries the expedition  
to Algiers could not have taken place.&quot;  
General Washington, in a letter to Congress  
dissenting from that body on the subject of re­  
  
ducing Canada and other British settlements  
for the French, gave, among his reasons, &quot;that  
France would engross the whole trade of Newfoundland  
whenever she pleased, and thus secure  
the finest nursery of seamen in the world.
