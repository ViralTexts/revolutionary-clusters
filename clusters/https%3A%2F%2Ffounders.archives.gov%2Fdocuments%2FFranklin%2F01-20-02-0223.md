Dantzick, September 5.  
We have long wondered here at the Supineness of the English Nation, under the Prussian Impositions upon its Trade entering our Port. We did not till lately know the Claims, antient and modern, that hang over that Nation, and therefore could not suspect that it might submit to those Impositions from a Sense of Duty, or from Principles of Equity. The following Edict, just made public, may, if serious, throw some Light upon this Matter.  
“Frederick, by the Grace of God, King of Prussia, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. to all present and to come,  
* A tous presens et à venir. Orig.  
Health. The Peace now enjoyed throughout our Dominions, having afforded us Leisure to apply ourselves to the Regulation of Commerce, the Improvement of our Finances, and at the same Time the easing our Domestic Subjects in their Taxes: For these Causes, and other good Considerations us thereunto moving, We hereby make known, that after having deliberated these Affairs in our Council, present our dear Brothers, and other great Officers of the State, Members of the same, We, of our certain Knowledge, full Power and Authority Royal, have made and issued this present Edict, viz.  
Whereas it is well known to all the World, that the first German Settlements made in the Island of Britain, were by Colonies of People, Subjects to our renowned Ducal Ancestors, and drawn from their Dominions, under the Conduct of Hengist, Horsa, Hella, Uffa, Cerdicus, Ida, and others; and that the said Colonies have flourished under the Protection of our august House, for Ages past, have never been emancipated therefrom, and yet have hitherto yielded little Profit to the same. And whereas We Ourself have in the last War fought for and defended the said Colonies against the Power of France, and thereby enabled them to make Conquests from the said Power in America, for which we have not yet received adequate Compensation. And whereas it is just and expedient that a Revenue should be raised from the said Colonies in Britain towards our Indemnification; and that those who are Descendants of our antient Subjects, and thence still owe us due Obedience, should contribute to the replenishing of our Royal Coffers, as they must have done had their Ancestors remained in the Territories now to us appertaining: We do therefore hereby ordain and command, That from and after the Date of these Presents, there shall be levied and paid to our Officers of the Customs, on all Goods, Wares and Merchandizes, and on all Grain and other Produce of the Earth exported from the said Island of Britain, and on all Goods of whatever Kind imported into the same, a Duty of Four and an Half per Cent. ad Valorem, for the Use of us and our Successors. And that the said Duty may more effectually be collected, We do hereby ordain, that all Ships or Vessels bound from Great Britain to any other Part of the World, or from any other Part of the World to Great Britain, shall in their respective Voyages touch at our Port of Koningsberg, there to be unladen, searched, and charged with the said Duties.  
And WHEREAS there have been from Time to Time discovered in the said Island of Great Britain by our Colonists there, many Mines or Beds of Iron Stone; and sundry Subjects of our antient Dominion, skilful in converting the said Stone into Metal, have in Times past transported themselves thither, carrying with them and communicating that Art; and the Inhabitants of the said Island, presuming that they had a natural Right to make the best Use they could of the natural Productions of their Country for their own Benefit, have not only built Furnaces for smelting the said Stone into Iron, but have erected Plating Forges, Slitting Mills, and Steel Furnaces, for the more convenient manufacturing of the same, thereby endangering a Diminution of the said Manufacture in our antient Dominion. We do therefore hereby farther ordain, that from and after the Date hereof, no Mill or other Engine for Slitting or Rolling of Iron, or any Plating Forge to work with a Tilt-Hammer, or any Furnace for making Steel, shall be erected or continued in the said Island of Great Britain: And the Lord Lieutenant of every County in the said Island is hereby commanded, on Information of any such Erection within his County, to order and by Force to cause the same to be abated and destroyed, as he shall answer the Neglect thereof to Us at his Peril. But We are nevertheless graciously pleased to permit the Inhabitants of the said Island to transport their Iron into Prussia, there to be manufactured, and to them returned, they paying our Prussian Subjects for the Workmanship, with all the Costs of Commission, Freight and Risque coming and returning, any Thing herein contained to the contrary notwithstanding.   
We do not however think fit to extend this our Indulgence to the Article of Wool, but meaning to encourage not only the manufacturing of woollen Cloth, but also the raising of Wool in our antient Dominions, and to prevent both, as much as may be, in our said Island, We do hereby absolutely forbid the Transportation of Wool from thence even to the Mother Country Prussia; and that those Islanders may be farther and more effectually restrained in making any Advantage of their own Wool in the Way of Manufacture, We command that none shall be carried out of one County into another, nor shall any Worsted-Bay, or Woollen-Yarn, Cloth, Says, Bays, Kerseys, Serges, Frizes, Druggets, Cloth-Serges, Shalloons, or any other Drapery Stuffs, or Woollen Manufactures whatsoever, made up or mixt with Wool in any of the said Counties, be carried into any other County, or be Waterborne even across the smallest River or Creek, on Penalty of Forfeiture of the same, together with the Boats, Carriages, Horses, &amp;c. that shall be employed in removing them. Nevertheless Our loving Subjects there are hereby permitted, (if they think proper) to use all their Wool as Manure for the Improvement of their Lands.  
And WHEREAS the Art and Mystery of making Hats hath arrived at great Perfection in Prussia, and the making of Hats by our remote Subjects ought to be as much as possible restrained. And forasmuch as the Islanders before-mentioned, being in Possession of Wool, Beaver, and other Furs, have presumptuously conceived they had a Right to make some Advantage thereof, by manufacturing the same into Hats, to the Prejudice of our domestic Manufacture, We do therefore hereby strictly command and ordain, that no Hats or Felts whatsoever, dyed or undyed, finished or unfinished, shall be loaden or put into or upon any Vessel, Cart, Carriage or Horse, to be transported or conveyed out of one County in the said Island into another County, or to any other Place whatsoever, by any Person or Persons whatsoever, on Pain of forfeiting the same, with a Penalty of Five Hundred Pounds Sterling for every Offence. Nor shall any Hat-maker in any of the said Counties employ more than two Apprentices, on Penalty of Five Pounds Sterling per Month: We intending hereby that such Hat-makers, being so restrained both in the Production and Sale of their Commodity, may find no Advantage in continuing their Business. But lest the said Islanders should suffer Inconveniency by the Want of Hats, We are farther graciously pleased to permit them to send their Beaver Furs to Prussia; and We also permit Hats made thereof to be exported from Prussia to Britain, the People thus favoured to pay all Costs and Charges of Manufacturing, Interest, Commission to Our Merchants, Insurance and Freight going and returning, as in the Case of Iron.  
And lastly, Being willing farther to favour Our said Colonies in Britain, We do hereby also ordain and command, that all the Thieves, Highway and Street-Robbers, House-breakers, Forgerers, Murderers, So[domi]tes, and Villains of every Denomination, who have forfeited their Lives to the Law in Prussia, but whom We, in Our great Clemency, do not think fit here to hang, shall be emptied out of our Gaols into the said Island of Great Britain for the BETTER PEOPLING of that Country.  
We flatter Ourselves that these Our Royal Regulations and Commands will be thought just and reasonable by Our much-favoured Colonists in England, the said Regulations being copied from their own Statutes of 10 and 11 Will. III. C. 10, 5 Geo. II. C. 22, 23 Geo. II. C. 29, 4 Geo. I. C. 11, and from other equitable Laws made by their Parliaments, or from Instructions given by their Princes, or from Resolutions of both Houses entered into for the GOOD Government of their own Colonies in Ireland and America.  
And all Persons in the said Island are hereby cautioned not to oppose in any wise the Execution of this Our Edict, or any Part thereof, such Opposition being High Treason, of which all who are suspected shall be transported in Fetters from Britain to Prussia, there to be tried and executed according to the Prussian Law.  
Such is our Pleasure.  
Given at Potsdam this twenty-fifth Day of the Month of August, One Thousand Seven Hundred and Seventy-three, and in the Thirty-third Year of our Reign.  
By the King in his Council  
RECHTMAESSIG, Secr.”  
  
  
Some take this Edict to be merely one of the King’s Jeux d’Esprit: Others suppose it serious, and that he means a Quarrel with England: But all here think the Assertion it concludes with, “that these Regulations are copied from Acts of the English Parliament respecting their Colonies,” a very injurious one: it being impossible to believe, that a People distinguish’d for their Love of Liberty, a Nation so wise, so liberal in its Sentiments, so just and equitable towards its Neighbours, should, from mean and injudicious Views of petty immediate Profit, treat its own Children in a Manner so arbitrary and TYRANNICAL

The draft of a clause was agreed upon which might be added to  
the Bill for encouraging the Woollen Manufacture in England with

Dantzick, Sept. §.  
W E have long wondered here. at the  
&#x27; fapinenefs of the Englith nation,  
under’ the Pruffian impofitions upon its  
trade entering our port. We did not,  
till lately, knew the claims, ancient and  
modern, that hang over that nation, and  
therefore could not fufpeet that it might  
fiibmit to thofe impofitions from a fenfe  
of duty, or from principles of equity.  
‘The following Edié, juft’ made nblick,  
may, if ferious, throw fome light upon  
this matter:  
‘FREDERICK, by the grace of God,  
King of Pruffia, &amp;e. &amp;c. &amp;c. to all pre-  
fent and to come*, Health, ‘the peace  
now enjoyed throughout our dominions,  
having afforded us leifure ‘to, apply our-  
felves to the regulation of commerce, the  
improvement of our finatices, and at the  
fame. time the eafing our domettic fabjeéts  
in their taxes: For thefe claufes, and other  
good confiderations us thereunto moving,  
we hereby, make Known, that, after hav-  
ing deliberated thefe affairs’in our coun-  
cil, prefent our dear brothers, and other  
great, officers. of the ftate, members of  
the fame, we, of ‘our certain knowledge,  
full power, and authority roy.1, have  
made and iflued this prefent Edi, viz.  
*¢ Whereas it is well known, to all the  
world, that the firft German fettlesaents  
made in the ifland of Britain were by  
colonies. of people, fubjeéts té our re  
nowned ducal’ anceftors, and drawn from  
their, deminions, under the conduct of  
Héngiit, Horfa, Hella, Uffi, Cerdicus,  
Ida, and others; and that the faid colo-  
nies have flourithed under the proteétion  
of our auguft houfe, for ages paft; have  
never been emancipated therefrom; and  
yet have hitherto yielded little profit to  
the fame: And whereas we ourfelf have  
in the laft war fonght for and defended  
the faid colonies, againft the power of  
trance, and thereby enabled them to  
make conquefts from thé fiid’ power in  
America ; for. which. we have not yet  
received adequate compénfation’: “And  
whereas it is.juft and expedient that a  
revenue fhould be raifed’ from the faid  
colonies in Britain, towards our indemni-  
fication; and that thofe who are defcen-  
dants of our ancient fubjeéts, and thence  
{till owe us due obedience, fhould contri-  
bute to the replenifhing of our royal coffers,  
as they mutt havextone, had their anceftors  
remained in the territories. now, to us ap-  
pertaining: We do therefore hereby or-  
dain and command, That, from.asid after  
the date of thefé, prefents, there fhall be  
levied, and paid to our officers of the cuf-  
toms, on all goods, wares, and merchan-  
dizes, and on all grain and other produce  
of the earth, exported from the feid ifland  
of Britain, and on all goods: of, whatever

four and a half percent: ad valorem, for

that the faid duty may niore: effedtually  
be colleéted, we do hereby ordain, that  
all hips or vefléls bound from Great-Bri-

from any other part of the world’ to  
Great-Britain, thal! in their ‘refpeftive

there to be unladen, fearched, andc arged  
with the faid duties. ;  
  
** And whereas there hath ‘been from  
time to time difcovered ‘in the fiid ifland  
of Great-Britain, by our colonifts there,  
many mines or beds of iron tone; and  
fundry, fubjeéts of our ancient dominion,  
fkilful in converting the faid’ tone into  
metal, have in ‘times’ paft. tranfported  
themfelves thither, carrying with’ them  
and communicating that art; and the in-  
habitants of’ the faid -ifland, prefwmin  
that they had.a natural’right to make&#x27;the  
beft. ufé they could of the natural pros  
duétions of their country, for their own  
benefit, have not only built furnaces for  
  
{melting the faid {tone into iron, ‘but  
have ereéted plating forges, flitting mills;  
and fteel furnacés, for the more conve-  
nient manufaCturing of ‘the fame, thereb  
  
endangering a diminution of’ the faid  
manufacture in our ancient dominion ;  
  
we do therefore hereby farther ordain,  
that, from and after the datéhereof; no  
  
mill or other enginé for flitting or rolling  
  
of iron, or any plating forge to&#x27;work ‘with  
  
a tilt-hammer, or any furnace for making  
  
fteel, shall: be ereéted’ or continued inthe  
  
faid’ iland’ of Great. Britain: And’ thé  
  
Lord-Lieutenant of every ‘county: in the -  
  
faid ifland is hereby commanded, onsin«  
formation of any fich erection within &quot;his  
county, to order and by:force to caufe  
the fame to be abated and‘deftroyed, as  
he fhall anfwer the negleét thereof to us  
at his peril. But we are neverthelefs gra*  
cioufly pleafed&#x27; to permit the inhabitants  
of the faid‘ifland to tranfport their iron  
into’ Pruffia, there to be ‘manufadured;  
and to them returned, they paying out  
PruMfian fubjeéts for the workmantfhip;  
with all the cofts of commiffion, freight,  
and rifk, coming and returning, anything  
herein contained to the contrary notwith=

‘© We do not, however, think fit to ex-  
tend this our-indilgence to the article of

thie manufa¢turing of woolen cloth, but  
alfo the raifing of wool; in our ancient  
dominions; and to prevent both, as much  
as may be, in our faid ifland, wedo hereby  
abfotutely forbid the tranfportation of  
wool from thence even to the: mother

we command that none fhall be carried  
out of one county into another, nor fhall  
any worfted, bay, or woollen-yarn, cloth,  
days, bays, kerfeys, ferges, frizes, drug-  
gets, cloth-ferges, fhalloons, or any other  
drapery ftuffs, os woollen mannfactures  
whatfoever, made up or mixed with wool  
in any of the faid counties, be carried into  
any other county, or be water-borne even  
acrofs the fmalleft river or creek, on pe-  
nalty of forfeiture of the fame, together  
with the boats, carriages, horfes, &amp;c. that  
fhell be employed, in removing them.  
Neverthelefs, our loving fubjeéts there  
are hereby permitted (if they think pro  
  
tr) to ufe all their wool as manige, for  
the improvement of their lands.  
  
‘¢ And whereas the art and myftery of  
making hats bath arrived at great perfec-  
tion in Pruffia; and the making of hats  
by our remoter fubjéts ought to be as  
much as poffibie reftrained: And foraf-  
much as the iflanders before mentioned,  
being in pof=ffidn of wool, Beaver and  
other furs, have prefumptuonr conceived  
they had a right to make fome advantage  
thereof, by manutacturing the fame into  
hats, to 4 ha prejudice of our domeftic  
mmanufaéture: We do therefore hereby  
ftrictly command and ordain, that no hats  
or felts whatfoever, dyed of undyed,  
finilhed or unfinilhed; fhall be loaden of  
put into of upon any veflel, cart, cartiage,  
or horfe, to be tranfperted or. conveyed  
out of one county in the faid ifland into  
another county, or to any other place  
whatfoever, by any perfon or perfons  
whatfoever, on pain of forfeiting the fame,  
with a penalty of five hundred pounds  
fterling for every offence. Nor fhall any  
  
atemaker, in any of the faid counties,  
employ mere than two app¥entices, on  
penalty of five pounds fferling per month :  
we intending hereby that fuch hat-makers,  
being fo reftrained, both in the produétion  
and fale of their commodity, rig bem no  
advantage in continuing their bnfinefs,  
But, iett the faid iflanders fhould fuffer  
inconveniency, by the want of hats, we  
are farther gracioufly pleafed to permit  
them to fend their beaver furs to Pruflia;  
and we alfo permit hats made thereof to  
be exported from Pruffia to Britain, the  
people thus favoured to pay all cofts and  
charges of manufacturing, intereft, com-  
miffion to ovr merchants, infurance and  
freight going and returning, as in the  
cafe of iron. . P  
  
“ And laftly, being willing farther to  
favour our faid colonies in Britain, we do  
hereby alfo ordain and tommand, that  
all the thieves, highway and flreet rob-  
bers, houfe-breakers, forgercis, murder-  
ers, {—d—tes, and villains of every de-  
homination, who have forfeited their lives  
to the law in Pruffia, but whom we, in  
our great clemency, do not think fit here  
to hang, fhall be emptied out of our

\ E have long wondered here at

Whereas it is well known to all

W E have long wondered here

could not fufpeft that it might fub-

that the faid duty may more effec¬

And whereas, there have been,  
from time to time, difeovered in the

ColoniAs there, many mines or beds  
of iron-ftone ; and fundry fubjeiEls of  
our ancient dominions, ikilful in con¬

of wool from thence even to the mo¬

known, that after having deliber-  
ated thefe affairs in ovr council,  
prefent our dear brothers, and  
other great officers of the {ftate,  
members of the fame ; we, of our  
certain knowledge, full power,  
and authority royal, have made  
and iffued this prefent Ediét, viz.  
Whereas it is well known to all  
the world, that the firlt German  
festiements made in the ifland of  
Britain, were by colonies of peo-  
ple, fubje@ to our renowned du-  
cal anceftors, and drawn from  
their dominions, under the con-  
du€t of Hengift, Horfa, Hella,  
U ffa, Cerdicus, Ida, and others ;  
and that the faid colonies have  
flourifhed under the protection  
of our auguit houfe, for ages paft ;  
have never been emancipated  
therefrom ; and yet have hither-  
to yielded little profit to the fame ;  
and whereas we ourfelves have in  
the laft war fought for and de-  
fended the fame colonics, againit  
the power of France, and thereby  
enabled them to make conquetfts  
from the faid power in America ;  
for which we have not yet receiv-  
ed adequate compenfation : And  
whereas it is juft and expedient  
that a revenue fhould be railed from  
the {aid colonies in Britain,towards  
our indemnification, and that  
thofe who are defcendants of our  
ancient fubjects, and thence fill  
owe us due obedience, fhould  
contribute to the replenifhing of  
our royal coffers ; (as they muft  
have done, hadtheir anccitors re-  
mained in the territori¢s now to  
us appertaining :) we do there-  
fore hereby ordain and command,  
that from and after the date of  
thefe prefents, there fhall be levi-

cuftoms, on all goods, wares, and  
merchandizes, and on all grain,

ever kind imported imto the fame,  
a duty of four and a half per cent,

duty may more effectually be col-

Great Britain to any other part  
of the world, or from any other  
part of the world to Great Britain,  
fhall in their refpettive voyages

there to be unladen, Gaia

And whereas there hath been from

of iron ftone ; andfundry fubje&amp;s  
of our ancient dominion, fkilful  
in converting the faid ftone into  
metal, have in times paft trani-

ing with them and communicat-  
ing that art ; and the inhabitants  
of the faid ifland prefuming that  
they had a natural right to make  
the beft ufe they could of the nat-  
ural productions of their country,  
for their own benefit, have not only  
built furnaces for {melting the faid  
ftone into iron, but they ereéted  
plating forges, flitting mills, and  
fteel furnaces, for the more con-  
venient manufa€turing of the fame;  
thereby endangering a diminution  
of the faid manufadiure in our an-

is hereby commanded, on infor-  
mation of any fuch erection within  
his county, to order, and by force  
to caufe the fame to be abated and  
deftroyed ; as he fhall anfwer the  
negleét thereof to us at his peril.—  
But we are neverthclefs gracioufly  
pleafed to permit the inhabitants  
of the faid ifland to tran{port  
their iron into Pruffia, there to be  
manufactured and to them return-  
ed ; they paying our Pruffian fub-  
jeéts for the workmanthip, with  
all the cofts of commifiion, freight  
and rifk, coming and returning ;  
any thing herein contained to the  
contrary notwithftanding.  
  
We do not, however, think fit  
to extend this our indulgence to the  
article of wool, inour ancient do-  
minions ; and to prevent both as  
much as may be, in our faid ifland,  
We do hereby abfolutely forbid  
the tranfportation of wool from  
thence even to the mother country  
Pruflia : And that thofe iflanders  
may be further and more effcétu-  
ally reftrained in making any ad-  
vantage of their own wool, in the  
way of manufafture, we command  
that none fhall be carried out of  
@ne county into another ; nor  
fhall any worfted, bay, or woolen  
yarn, cloth, ferges, fhalloons, or  
any Other drapery ftuffs, or wool-  
en manafa€tures whatfoever, made  
up or mixed with wool, in any of  
the faid counties, be carried into  
any other county,or be water borne  
éven acrofs the fmalleft river or

the fame, together with the boats,  
carriages, horfes, &amp;c. that fhall  
  
employed in removing them.  
~—Neverthelefs, our loving fub-  
jects there are hereby permitted,  
(if they think proper) to ufe all  
their wool as manure, for the im-  
provement of their lands.  
  
And whereas the art and myf-  
tery of making Aats hath arrived  
  
at great perfection in Pruffia; and  
the making of hats by our remot-  
er fubjetts ought to be as much  
as poflible reitrained : And for  
as much as the rflanders before  
mentioned, being in pofleflion of  
wool, beaver, and other furs, have  
  
retumptuoufly conceived they  
Pad aright to make fome advan.  
tage thereof, by manufacturing the  
{ame into hats, to the prejudice of  
our domeftick manufacture :—We  
do therefore hereby ftri€lly com-  
mand and ordain, that no hats, or  
felts whatfoever, dyed or undyed,  
finifhed or unfinifhed, fhall be  
loaden or put into or upon any  
vellels, cart, carriage or horle ;  
to be tranfported or conveyed out  
of one county in the faid ifland  
into another county, or to any  
other place whatfoever, by any  
perfon or perfons whatfoever, on  
pain of forfeiting the fame, with a  
penalty of five hundred pounds  
flerling for every offenée. Nor  
fhall any hat maker, in any of the  
{aid counties, employ more than  
two apprentices, on penalty  
of five peunds fterling per  
month : We intending hereby  
that fuch hat makers, being re-  
ftrained, both in the production  
and fale of their commodity, may  
find no advantage in continuing  
their bufinefs.—But left the faid  
iflanders fhould fuffer inconveni-  
ency by the want of hats, we are  
further gracioufly pleafed to per-  
mitthem tofend their beaver furs  
to Pruffia; and we alfo permit  
hats made thereof to be exported  
from Pruflia to Britain ; the peo-

courage the importation of Pig iron from the colo-  
nies, by taking off the duty of 3s 9d, which had  
been heretofore levied on colonial pigs, the same as  
foreign iron. This was agreed to by the iron mas-  
ters, owing to the scarcity of charcoal, and it was  
argued, that, as the country could afford no more  
charcoal for additional furnaces, they must either  
gradually abandon the manufacture, or take off the  
duty, and keep their charcoal for refining or manu-  
facturing those pigs into bars, chains, and all finer  
articles; and, for that reason, the act also pro-  
vided that no mill, or other engine, for slitting or  
rolling iron, or any plating forge to work with a  
tilt hammer, or any furnace for making steel,  
should be erected in the colonies, and those already  
erected should not be carried on.

had been discovered in the island of Great  
Britain by “ our colonists there,” who, “ pre-  
suming that they had a natural right to make  
the best use they could of the natural pro-  
ductions of their country,” had erected fur-  
naces and forges for the manufacture of the  
same, to the detriment of the manufacturers  
of Prussia. This must be instantly stopped,  
and all the iron sent to Prussia to be manu-

of the settlements, they were perfectly content to

until it became only too evident that the mother  
country was abusing our dependence, that the  
colonists determined to manufacture their own  
necessities; but to lose the large revenue which  
trade with the States brought to England, was not

Whereas it is well known to all the world, that  
the first German settlements made in the Island  
of Britain, were by colonies of people, subject to  
our renowned ducal ancestors, and drawn from  
their dominions, under the conduct of Hengist,  
Horsa, Hella, Uffa, Cerdicus, Ida, and others; and  
that the said colonies have flourished under the  
protection of our august house for ages past; have  
never been emancipated therefrom; and yet have  
hitherto yielded little profit to the same; and  
whereas we ourself have in the last war fought  
for and defended the said colonies, against the  
power of France, and thereby enabled them to  
make conquests from the said power in Amer-  
ica, for which we have not yet received adequate  
compensation; and whereas it is just and expedi-  
ent that a revenue should be raised from the said  
colonies in Britain, towards our indemnification;  
and that those who are descendants of our ancient  
  
“subjects, and thence still owe us due obedience,  
  
should contribute to the replenishing of our royal  
coffers (as they must have done, had their ances-  
tors remained in the territories now to us apper-

presents, there shall be levied and paid to our  
officers of the customs, on all goods, wares, and  
merchandises, and on all grain and other produce
