I write this in a great hurry, being setting out in an hour on another journey with my steady good friend Sir John Pringle. We propose to visit Paris. Durand has given me letters of recommendation to the Lord knows who. I am told I shall meet with great respect there; but winds change and perhaps it will be full as well if I do not. We shall be gone about six weeks. I have a little private commission to transact of which more another time. Communicate nothing of this letter but privately to our friend Galloway. I am your

the French Ambassador in 1767, he says, * He is extremely

French court should have paid no more attention to this  
controversy from 1763 to 1775. It is true, we are informed  
by Dr. F ranklin, that he was visited by the French minister
