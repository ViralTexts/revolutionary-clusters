Decr. the 6th. 1806  
  
  
At a time when the public mind throughout the Union is agitated with alarming reports respecting the  
existence and designs of a party hostile to the welfare and prosperity of our country, we deem it a duty incumbent on us  
to express to the Executive of the Union our attachment to the government of the United States and our confidence in its  
administration. whatever may be the intention of desperate and abandoned men respecting the destruction of that  
constitution which has raised us to our present elevated rank among the nations of the world, and which is our only  
security for the future, we trust they will find very few advocates in the state of Ohio. We express the feelings and  
opinions of our constituents when we say that no arts of intrigueing men no real or visionary prospect of advantage will  
ever induce us to sever that bond of Union which is our only security against domestic violence and foreign invasion.  
Beleiving that the fundamental maxims of rational liberty have guided you in the administration of our  
government we hesitate not to express our full and entire confidence in your consels and conduct. Enjoying as we now do  
every blessing which as men and as citizens we could desire and in a country fertile in natures choisest gifts, we should  
deem it presumptuous indeed to hazard by intestive dissensions these incalculable advantages. 		  
We trust that public rumour  
has magnified the danger, but should the design in agitation be as destructive as represented we have no doubt but all  
fear will shortly be dissipated before the indignation of our citizens  
That you may long live to enjoy the attachment and respect of the american people is the sincere and
