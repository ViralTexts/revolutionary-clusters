New York. April 24. 1790.  
  
The Constitution having declared that the President ‘shall nominate, and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, shall appoint ambassadors other public ministers and consuls’ the President desires my opinion Whether the Senate has a right to negative the grade he may think it expedient to use in a foreign mission, as well as the person to be appointed?  
I think the Senate has no right to negative the grade.  
The Constitution has divided the powers of government into three branches, Legislative, Executive and Judiciary, lodging each with a distinct magistracy. The Legislative it has given completely to the Senate and House of representatives: it has declared that ‘the Executive powers shall be vested in the President,’ submitting only special articles of it to a negative by the Senate; and it has  vested the Judiciary power in the courts of justice, with certain exceptions also in favor of the Senate.  
The transaction of business with foreign nations is Executive altogether. It belongs then to the head of that department, except as to such portions of it as are specially submitted to the Senate. Exceptions are to be construed strictly. The Constitution itself indeed has taken care to circumscribe this one within very strict limits: for it gives the nomination of the foreign Agent to the President, the appointment to him and the Senate jointly, the commissioning to the President. This analysis calls our attention to the strict import of each term. To nominate must be to propose: appointment seems that act of the will which constitutes or makes the Agent: and the Commission is the public evidence of it. But there are still other acts previous to these, not specially enumerated in the Constitution; to wit 1. the destination of a mission to the particular country where the public service calls for it: and 2. the character, or grade to be employed in it. The natural order of all these is 1. destination. 2. grade. 3. nomination. 4. appointment. 5. commission. If appointment does not comprehend the neighboring acts of nomination, or commission, (and the constitution says it shall not, by giving them exclusively to the President) still less can it pretend to comprehend those previous and more remote of destination and grade. The Constitution, analysing the three last, shews they do not comprehend the two first. The 4th. is the only one it submits to the Senate, shaping it into a right to say that ‘A. or B. is unfit to be appointed.’ Now this cannot comprehend a right to say that ‘A. or B. is indeed fit to be appointed, but the grade fixed on is not the fit one to employ,’ or ‘our connections with the country of his destination are not such as to call for any mission.’ The Senate is not supposed by the Constitution to be acquainted with the concerns of the Executive department. It was not intended that these should be communicated to them; nor can they therefore be qualified to judge of the necessity which calls for a mission to any particular place, or of the particular grade, more or less marked, which special and secret circumstances may call for. All this is left to the President. They are only to see that no unfit person be employed.  
It may be objected that the Senate may, by continual negatives on the person, do what amounts to a negative on the grade; and so indirectly defeat this right of the President. But this would be a breach of trust, an abuse of the power confided to the Senate, of which that body cannot be supposed capable. So the President has  a power to convoke the legislature; and the Senate might defeat that power by refusing to come. This equally amounts to a negative on the power of convoking. Yet nobody will say they possess such a negative, or would be capable of usurping it by such oblique means. If the Constitution had meant to give the Senate a negative on the grade or destination, as well as the person, it would have said so in direct terms, and not left it to be effected by a sidewind. It could never mean to give them the use of one power thro the abuse of another.

(OPINION )  
The Constitution having declared (hat the President  
•hall nominate, ami hy and with the advice and consent  
of the Senate shall a/ipoint ambassadors, other public  
minister* and consuls, the President desires my opinion.  
Whether the Senate has a right to negative the grade he  
may think it exp-dient to use in. a -foreign mission, as well  
as the person lobe appointed to fill that grade?  
I think the Senate has no right to negative the grade.  
The Constitution has divided the powers ol government  
into three branches, Legislative, Executive, and Judi­  
ciary, lodging each with a distinct magistracy. The Le­  
gislative it has given completely to the Senate and House  
of Representatives. it has declared that “the Executive  
powers shall be vested in the President,” submitting only  
special articles of |t to a negative by tlie Senate; anil it  
has vested the Judiciary power in the courts ol justice,  
with certain exceptions also in favor ol the Smite.  
The transaction of business with foreign nations, is  
Executive sllogether. It belongs, then, to the Iwead of  
that department, except as to such portions of it ss are  
specially submitted to ilie Senate. Exceptions are to be  
eouslrued strictly. The Constitution itself, indeed, has  
taken rare to circumscribe this one within very strict  
limits: lor, it gives the nomination of the foreign agents  
to (he President, the appointment to him and the Senste  
jointly, and the commissioning to the President. This  
analysis calls our attention to the strict import of each  
term. To nominate, mu«t ho to propose. Appointment  
seems that act ol the will which constitutes or makes  
tho agent; and (lie commission is the public evidence of  
it. Hut there are still other acts previous to these sets  
specially enumerated in the Constitution: To wit, 1. &#x27;Flic  
destination of a mission to (lie particular country wheie  
the public service calls tor it; and 2. The chaiacter and  
grade to be employed in it. The natural order of all  
these is, 1st, Destination, 2 tirade, 3. Nomination, 4. Ap­  
pointment, 5. Commission. If appointment does not com­  
prehend the neighboring acts of nomination, or commis­  
sion, (and the Constitution says it shall not. by giving  
them exclusively to the President,) still less ran it pretend  
to comprehend those previous and more remote, ol destina­  
tion and grade. The Constitution, analysing the three  
last, shews they do not comprehend the two first. The  
fourth is the only one it submits to the Senate, shaping it  
in&#x27;o a right to say “that A or If is unfit to be appointed.”  
Now, tins caifnot comprehend a right to say “that A or B  
is indeed fit to be appointed, but the grade fixed on is not  
tlie lit one to employ;”or,“our connection* with the country  
of his destination are not such as to call for any mission.”  
The Senate is not supposed by the Constitution to be ac­  
quainted with the concern* of the Executive department.  
It was not intended that these should he communicated to  
them; nor can they, therefore, he qualified to judge of the  
necessity which calls lor a mission to any particular place,  
or of the particular g-ade, more or less marked, which  
. special and secret circumstances may rail for. All this  
i l» left *o the President, T hey are only to see that no unfit  
person be employed.  
It may be objected that the Senate may, by continual  
negatives on the perron, do w hat amounts to a negative on  
the grades, and so indirectly .&#x27;cleat this right of the Presi­  
dent. Hut this would lie a breach of Irtistr an abu«e ol  
the powers confided to the Senate, ol which (hat body  
cannot be supposed capable. So, the President has a power  
lo convoke the Legislature, and the Senate might detest  
that power hy refusing io come. This equally amounts to  
a negative, or the power ol convoking; yel no hotly will  
a»y they possess such a negative, or wcuM be capa­  
ble ol usurping it, by such oblique means. If tlie Con­  
stitution bad meant to give the Senate a negative on the  
grade or destination, ss well aa the person, it would have  
said so in direct terms, slid not left It to lie eff- rte.l hy s  
side-wind. It rould never mean to give them (he me ol

The Constitution having declared that the Pre.  
tident shall nominate, and by and with the advice  
and consent of the Senate shall appoint ambassa-  
dors, other public ministers and consuls, the Presi-  
dent desires my opinion, whether the Senate has a  
tight to negative the grade he may think it expedi-  
enttouse ina foreign mission, as well as the per-  
eon to be appointed to fill that grade ?  
  
I think the Senate has no right to negative the  
grade. The Constitution has divided the powers of  
government inte three branches, Legislative, Exe.  
cutive, and Judiciary, lodging each with a distinct  
magistracy. The Legislative it has given com-  
  
etely to the Senate and house of Representatives.  
  
thas declared that “the Executive powers shall  
be vested in the President,” submitting only special  
articles of it to a negative by the Senate ; and it has  
tested the Judiciary power in the courts of justice,  
with certain exceptions also in favor of the Senate.  
  
The transaction of business with foreign nations,  
is Executive altogether. It belongs, then, to the  
head of that department, except as to such portions  
of it as are specially submitted to the Senate. Ex-  
¢eptions are to be construed strictly. ‘lhe Consti-  
tution itself, indeed, has taken care to circumscribe  
this one within very strict limits: for, it gives the  
nomination of the foreign agents to the President,  
the appointment to him and the Senate jointly, and  
the commissioning to the President. ‘This analysis  
calls our attention to the strict import of each  
term. ‘To nominate, must be to propose. Appoint-  
ment seems that the act of the will which consti-  
futes or makes the agent; and the commission is  
  
public evidence of it. But there still other acts  
  
Previous to these acts especially enumerated in the  
Constitution: To wit, 1. ‘The destination of a mis-  
fon to the particular country where the public ser-  
  
ce calls for it; and 2. The character and grade  
Ho be employed init. The natural order of all these  
Ist, Destination, 2. Grade, 3. Nomination, 4.  
pointment, 5. Commission. If appointment  
shot comprehend the neighboring acts of nomis  
“ion, or commission, (and the Constitution says  
lnot, by giving them exclusively to the Pre-  
it,) still less can it pretend to comprehend those  
and more of destination and grade.  
do sing the three last, shows  
  
not comprehend the two first. The fourth  
  
only one it submits to the Senate, shaping it  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
into a right to say ‘that A or B is unfit to be  
appointed. Now, this cannot comprehend @ right  
to say, ‘that A or B is indeed fit to be appoint-  
ed, but the grade fixed on is not the fit one to  
employ ;” or, “‘our connections with the country  
of his destination are not such as to call] for any  
mission.” ‘The Senate is not supposed by the Con-  
stitution to be acquainted with the concerns of the  
Executive departinent. It was not intended that  
these should be communicated to them ; nor can they,  
therefore, be qualified to judge of the necessity  
  
  
  
which calls for a mission to any particular place,  
| or of the particular grade, more or less marked,  
| which special and secret circumstances may call  
| for. All this isleft to the President. ‘They are on  
| ly to see that no unfit person be employed.  
|” It may be objected that the Senate may, by con-  
| tinual negatives on the person, do what amounts to  
a negative on the grades, and so indirectly defeat  
this right of the President. But this would bea  
breach eftrust, an abuse of the powers confided to  
the Senate, of which that body cannot |e supposed  
‘capable. So, the President has a power to convoke  
the Legislature, and the Senate might defeat that  
power by refusing to come. This equally amounts  
to anegative, or the power of convoking; yet no  
body-will say they possess such a negative, or would  
be capable of usurping it, by such ollique means.  
If the Constitution + ad meant to give the Senate a  
negative on the grade or destination, as well as the  
person, it would have said so in direct terms, and not  
left it to be effected by a side-wind. It could never  
mean to give them the use of one power through the  
abuse of anether.

Opinion. The  
Constitution hav-  
ing declared that The President shall no­  
minate, and by and with the advice and  
consent of the Senate jshall appoint am­  
bassadors, other public ministers arid con­  
suls, the President &#x27; desire$ rny opinion,  
Whether the Senate has a right to nega­  
tive the grade hemay think it expedient  
to Use in a foreign mission, as well as the  
person to be appointed to fill that grade ?  
I think the Senate has no right to ne­  
gative the grade. The Constitution has  
divided the powers of gQvernmei;t into  
three-branches, Legislative, Executive,  
and Judiciary, lodging ealh with a dis­  
tinct magistracy. The Legislative it has  
given completely, to the Senate and House  
of Representatives li has; declared that  
&quot;the Executive powers shall be vested in  
The President, submitting only special  
articles of it to a negative by the Senate;  
and it has vested the Judiciary power in  
the courts of; justice, with certain excep­  
tions also in fuSor of the Senate.  
The transaction of business with foreign  
nations, .is Executive altogether. It be­  
longs, then, to the head of that depart­  
ment, except as to such portions of it as  
are specially submitted to the Senate. JEx­  
ceptions are to be construed: strictly. The  
Constitution itself, indeed, has taken care  
to circumscribe this one within very strict  
limits : for, it gives the nomination of the  
foreign agents to The President, the ap  
pointment 4o him and the Senate jointly,  
and the commissioning to the President.  
This analysis calls our attention to the  
strict import of each term. jTo nominate..  
must beo propose. Appointment seems  
that act of the will which constitutes or  
makes the agent ; and the commission is  
the public evidence of jit. But there are

cially enumerated in the Constitution : To  
wit.- 1. i he destination of a mission to  
the particular countrs&#x27; where the public  
service calls lor it ; and 2. The character  
and grade to be employed in it. The na­  
tural order of all these is, 1st. Destina  
tion, 2. Grade, 3: Nomination, 4 appoint­  
ment, 5. Commission. If appointment  
does not comprehend the neighhoring  
acts oi nomination, or commission, (and  
the Constitution says it shall not, by giv  
ing iu?m exclusely to the President,) still  
less can it pretend to comprehend those  
previous and more remold, of destination  
and grade. The CorJstitution, analysing  
the three last, shews they do noi Compre  
hend the two first. The fourth is the!  
only one it submits to jthe Senate, shaping  
it into a right to say &quot;that A or B is un­  
fit to be appointed.&quot; jNow, this cannot  
comprehend a right to say &quot;that A or B is  
indeed fit to be appointed, but the grade  
fixed on is not the fit one to &#x27;employ ;&quot; or,  
&quot;our connections with the country oi his  
destination are not such a to call for any  
mission. 1 ne Senate is not supposed  
by! the Constitution to be acquainted with  
the concerns of the Executive department.  
It was not intended that these should be  
communicated to&#x27; them; nor can jbev,  
mereiore,.De qua una, to judge ot the ne­  
cessity which calls for a mission to any  
particular place, or of the particular grade,  
more or less marked, which special and  
secret circumstances may call for. All  
this is left to the President, They are  
only to see that no unfit person be employ­  
ed. &#x27;:- &#x27; i&quot;&quot; &#x27; i ; :  
It may be objected that the Senate may.

In the strict interpretation and construc­

ciple for which JerFerson so strenuously  
and tenaciously contended as for the limi­

And, he added, &quot;the transaction of foreign  
business is executive altogether.&quot;  
Jones, Gorman and their associates in  
the obstruction of the Spanish treaty con­

the founders of the party to whose fun­
