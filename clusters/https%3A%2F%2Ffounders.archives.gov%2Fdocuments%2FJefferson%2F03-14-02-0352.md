Sir.  
Boston June 2d 1819  
  
I have had the honor to receive your letter dated the 12 ultimo. The information you have given yourself the trouble therein to communicate, demands and receives my warmest acknowledgments.  
The observations, which I took the liberty to make in my former letter to you on the subject of committees of correspondence, related to those which were instituted in Massachusetts and Virginia, in the years 1772 and 1773: similar legislative committees had been previously appointed. Mr Wirt is certainly incorrect in his remark “that the house of burgesses in Virginia had the merit of originating that powerful engine of resistance, corresponding committees between the legislatures of the different colonies,” if the measure had not been adopted by Virginia prior to the yea

“extract of a letter from a gentleman of distinction in Virginia to his friend in this town, dated march 14. 1773,” together with the resolves passed in your House of Burgesses for the appointment of a committee of correspondence, was subjoined, all of which were printed upon one sheet and circulated.  
The extract from the letter above alluded to is as follows.  
“I have received the papers  
* The votes and proceedings of the town of Boston, and newspapers, containing the governors speeches, and the answers of the two houses.  
you sent me, and am much obliged to you for them, our assembly sitting a few days after, they were of use to us. You will see by the inclosed resolutions the true sentiments of this colony, and that we are endeavouring to bring our sister colonies into the strictest union with us, that we may Resent in one body any steps that may be taken by administration to deprive any one of us of the least particle of our rights and liberties; we should have done more, but we could procure nothing but newspaper accounts of the proceedings in Rhode Island. I hope we shall not be thus kept in the dark for the future, and that we shall have from different committees the earliest intelligence of any motion that may be made by the Tyrants in England to carry their infernal purposes of enslaving us into execution: I dare say venture to assure you the strictest attention will be given on our parts to these grand points
