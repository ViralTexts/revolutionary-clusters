I am your debtor for two letters—one of the 12th of Decemr—the other of the 8th of April. Since the receipt of the first, I have paid my respects to you in a line by Majr Swan; but as it was introductory only of him, it requires an apology, rather than entitles me to a credit in our epistolary correspondence.  
If I had as good a nack my dear Marquis, as you have at saying handsome things, I would endeavor to pay you in kind for the flattering expressions of your letters, having an ample field to work in; but as I am a clumsy workman in the manufactory of compliments, I must first profess my unworthyness of those which you have bestowed on me, and my inability to meet you on that ground; and therefore will not expose myself in the attempt.  
It gives me great pleasure to find by my last letters from France, that the dark clouds which hung over you[r] hemisphere, are vanishing before the all-chearing Sunshine of peace. My first wish is to see the blessings of it diffused through all Countries, &amp; among all ranks in every Country; &amp; that we should consider ourselves as the children of a common parent, and be disposed to acts of brotherly kindness towards one another. In that case all restrictions of trade would vanish; we should take your Wines, your fruits &amp; surplusage of other articles: &amp; give you in return our Oils, our Fish, Tobacco, naval stores &amp;ca; and in like manner we should exchange produce with other Countries, to our reciprocal advantage: the Globe is large enough, why then need we wrangle for a small spot of it? If one Country cannot contain us another should open its arms to us. But these halcyon days (if they ever did exist) are now no more; a wise providence, I presume, has ordered it otherwise, &amp;  
  
we must go in the old way disputing—&amp; now &amp; then fighting, until the Globe itself is dissolved.  
I rarely go from home; but my friends in &amp; out of Congress sometimes tell me what is on the carpet; to hand it to you afterwards would be a circuitous mode, &amp; altogether idle, as I am persuaded you have Correspondents at New-York who give it to you at first hand, &amp; can relate it with more clearness &amp; perspicuity than I can.

Dear Str,

one of the 12th.of December, the  
other of the 8th of April. Since the  
receipt of the first, I have paid my  
respects to. you, in a line or two by  
Major Swan, but as it was in-

apology, rather than entitles me to  
credit, in our epistolary correspond-  
ence.  
  
. If I had as good a nack, my dear  
Marquis, as you have, at saying hand-  
some things, | would endeavour to  
pay you in kind for the many flat-  
tering expressions of your letters.  
I have anample field to work in ; but  
as 1 am a clumsy labourer in the  
manufactory of compliments, I must  
first profess my unworthiness of those  
which you have bestowed on me, and  
then, conscious of my inability of  
meeting you upon that ground, con-  
fess that it is better not to enter the  
list, than to retreat from it in dis-  
  
It gives me great pleasure to find,  
by my last letters from France, that  
the dark clouds which overspread  
your hemisphere, are yielding to the  
sunshine of peace. My first wish  
is to see the blessings of it diffused  
  
through all countries, and among all 4  
ranks in every country, and that we |  
should consider ourselves as the chil- i  
dren of a common parent, and be |  
disposed to acts of brotherly .kind- :

Vernon, Sept. 5, 1785, that we quote  
  
It gives me great pleasure to find by  
my last letters from Franco, that the dark  
clouds which overspread your hemisphere  
are yielding to the sunshine of peace. My  
first wish is to see the blessings of it dif­  
fused through all countries, and among all  
ranks in every country, and that we should  
consider ourselves as the children of a  
common Parent, and be disposed to acta of  
brotherly kindness to one another, hi that  
case, restrictions in trade would vanish  
we should take your wines, your fruits,  
and surplussage of such articles as our ne­  
cessities or convenience might require, and  
in return give you our fish, our oil, our  
tobacco, our naval stores, etc., and in like  
uiwnuer should exchange produce with  
other countries, to the reciprocal advanta­  
ges of each. And, as the globe is large,  
why need we wrangle for a small spot ou  
it? If one country cannot contain us, an­  
other should open its arms to us.&#x27;&#x27;

It is the duty ef every poor man to in­  
sure his cottage every moderate man his  
residence every rich man his mansion  
so that should the devouring element pass  
that way. and sweep his home from the  
earth, he would have the necessary means  
of building another, thus providing that  
the loved one?—the wife and children—be  
not made to suffer from the unforseen ca­  
lamity of fire. Every dwelling in the land  
should be insured.  
  
Every debtor should insure for the pro­  
tection of his creditor and it is also a  
duty of the creditor to see that it is done
