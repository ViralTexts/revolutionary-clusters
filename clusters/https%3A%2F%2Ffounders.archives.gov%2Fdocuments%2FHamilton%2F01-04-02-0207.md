Notwithstanding the equal authority which will subsist between the two houses on all legislative subjects, except the originating of money bills, it cannot be doubted that the house composed of the greater number of members, when supported by the more powerful states, and speaking the known and determined sense of a majority of the people, will have no small advantage in a question depending on the comparative firmness of the two houses.  
This advantage must be increased by the consciousness felt by the same side, of being supported in its demands, by right, by reason, and by the constitution; and the consciousness on the opposite side, of contending against the force of all these solemn considerations.  
It is farther to be considered that in the gradation between the smallest and largest states, there are several which, though most likely in general to arrange themselves among the former, are too little removed in extent and population from the

 be bound to contend for the latter, by the interest which their states will feel in the former.  
These considerations seem to afford ample security on this subject, and ought alone to satisfy all the doubts and fears which have been indulged with regard to it. Admitting however that, they should all be insufficient to subdue the unjust policy of the smaller states, or their predominant influence in the councils of the senate; a constitutional and infallible resource, still remains with the larger states, by which they will be able at all times to accomplish their just purposes. The house of representatives can not only refuse, but they alone can propose the supplies requisite for the support of government. They in a word hold the purse; that powerful instrument by which we behold in the history of the British constitution, an infant and humble representation of the people, gradually enlarging the sphere of its activity and importance, and finally reducing, as far as it seems to have wished, all the overgrown prerogatives of the other branches of the government. This power over the purse, may in fact be regarded as the most compleat and effectual weapon with which any constitution can arm the immediate representatives of the people, for obtaining a redress of every grievance, and for carrying into effect every just and salutary measure.  
But will not the house of representatives be as much interested as the senate in maintaining the government in its proper functions, and will they not therefore be unwilling to stake its existence or its reputation on the pliancy of the senate? Or if such a trial of firmness between the two branches were hazarded, would not the one be as likely first to yield as the other? These questions will create

 as claiming in my judgment a very serious attention. It is, that in all legislative assemblies, the greater the number composing them may be, the fewer will be the men who will in fact direct their proceedings. In the first place, the more numerous any assembly may be, of whatever characters composed, the greater is known to be the ascendancy of passion over reason. In the next place, the larger the number, the greater will be the proportion of members of limited information and of weak capacities. Now it is precisely on characters of this description that the eloquence and address of the few are known to act with all their force. In the antient republics, where the whole body of the people assembled in person, a single orator, or an artful statesman, was generally seen to rule with as compleat a sway, as if a sceptre had been placed in his single hands. On the same principle the more multitudinous a representative assembly may be rendered, the more it will partake of the infirmities incident to collective meetings of the people. Ignorance will be the dupe of cunning; and passion the slave of sophistry and declamation. The people can never err more than in supposing that by multiplying their representatives, beyond a certain limit, they strengthen the barrier against the government of a few. Experience will forever admonish them that on the contrary, after securing a sufficient number for the purposes of safety, of local information, and of diffusive sympathy with the whole society, they will counteract their own views by every addition to their representatives. The countenance of the government may become more democratic; but the soul that animates it will be more oligarchic. The machine will be enlarged, but the fewer and often, the more secret will be the springs by which its motions are directed.

. It has been said that more than a majority ought to have been required for a quorum, and in particular cases, if not in all, more than a majority of a quorum for a decision. That some advantages might have resulted from such a precaution, cannot be denied. It might have been an additional shield to some particular interests, and another obstacle generally to hasty and partial measures. But these considerations are outweighed by the inconveniencies in the opposite scale. In all cases where justice or the general good might require new laws to be passed, or active measures to be pursued, the fundamental principle of free government would be reversed. It would be no longer the majority that would rule; the power would be transferred to the minority. Were the

Notwitstanding the equal authority which  
will subsist between the two Houses on all  
Legislative subjects, except the. originating  
of money bills, it cannot be doubted that the  
House, composed of the greatest number  
when supported by the more powerful  
States, and speaking the known and deter­  
mined sense of the People, will have no  
small advantage in a question defending on  
the comparative firmness of the two Houses.  
This advantage must be increased by the  
consciousness felt on the same side, of be­  
ing supported in it demands by rights, by  
reason and by the Constitution; and the  
consciousness on the opposition tide, of con­  
tending againet all these solemn considera­  
tions.These considerations seem to afford am­  
ple security on this subject. Admitting  
however that they should all be insufficient  
to subdue the unjust policy of the smaller  
States or their predominant influence in the  
councils of the Senate.  
Such a state of things has recently trans­  
pired in our Congress. What ceurse does  
Mr. Madisor recommend! He says:  
A ccn stitulion and infallible rtsource still  
remains with the largest States. The House  
of Representatives can r.ot only refuse, but  
they alone can propose the supplies requisite  
for the support of Government. They in a  
word hold the Purse, that powerful instru­  
ment by which we behold in the history of  
the British Constitution an infant and hum­  
ble representation of the People gradually  
enlarging the sphere of its activity and im­  
portance; and finally reducing, as far as it  
seems to have wished, all the overgrown  
prerogatives of the other branches of the  
Government. This power over the purse  
may.ir. lie. be regarded as the most complete  
and effectual weapon with which any con­  
stitution can arm the immediate representa­  
tives of the people, FOR OBTAINING A  
REDRESS OF EVERY GRIEVANCE  
AND FOR CARRYING INTO EFFECT  
EVERY JUST AND SALUTARY MEAS­  
URE.This is precisely what our friends in the  
H )Uee have been doing. They refused to  
appropriate money to promote disorder and  
crime. They retuse to be parties to the  
enforcement of laws which are &quot;a disgrace  
to the country and to its free institutions.&quot;  
This then is to be characterized as revolu­  
tionary. Dare any apologist of James  
BrcnASAH defend these Kansas Laws!  
Dare any ol them defend the action of their  
! par:icu!ar friends in Kansas? We think  
&#x27; not.

more it will partake of the infirmities incident to colle clive

:&quot; The more multitudinous a representa-  
tive assembly is, the more it will  
partake of the infirmities incident to  
collective meetings of the people.  
Ignorance will be the dupe of cunning,  
and passion the slave of sophistry and  
declamation. The people can never err  
more than in supposing that by  
multiplying their representatives be-  
yond a certain limit they strengthen the  
barrier against a government of a few.  
Experience will for ever admonish them  
that, on the contrary, after securing a  
sufficient number for the purposes of  
safety, of local information, and of  
diffusive sympathy with the. whale  
society, they will counteract their own  
views by every addition to their  
representation.&quot; ARGENTUM
