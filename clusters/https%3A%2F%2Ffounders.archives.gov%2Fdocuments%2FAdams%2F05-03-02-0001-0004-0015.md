The next consideration, in this mode of enquiry, was the evidence as severally pertaining to each prisoner; with such observations, on the one hand, as served to shew a defect of legal proof as to fact; on the other, such matters served to justify, excuse or extenuate the offence, in law.  
And particularly with regard to Killroy, Mr. Quincy cited and commented on the following passages from Judge Foster’s Crown law, and the Marquiss of Beccaria’s Essay on Crimes and punishments.  
  
“WORDS are often misrepresented, whether through ignorance, in attention, or malice, it mattereth not the defendant, he is equally effected in either case; and they are extremely liable to misconstruction. And with all, this evidence is not in the ordinary course of things to be disproved by that sort of negative evidence by which the proof of plain facts may be and often is confronted.” Crown Law, 243.  
“Finally, the CREDIBILITY of a witnesses is NULL, when the question relates to the WORDS of a criminal; for the tone of voice, the gesture, all that preceds, accompanies and follows the different ideas which men annex to the same words, may so alter and modify a man’s discourse, that it is almost impossible to repeat them precisely in the manner in which they were spoken. Besides, violent and uncommon actions, such as real crimes, leave a trace in the multitude of circumstances that attend them, and in their effects; but Words remain only in the memory of the hearers, who are commonly negligent or prejudiced. It is infinitely easier then to found an accusation on the Words, than on the actions of a man; for in these, the number of circumstances, urged against the accused, afford him variety of means of justifications.” Essay 48, 9.  
  
May it please your Honours, and you Gentlemen of the Jury,  
  
After having thus gone through the evidence, and considered it as applicatory to all and every of the prisoners, the next matter in order seems to be the consideration of the law pertinent upon this

inate from it) is our benefit of clergy.  
And so, that “the murderer shall flee to the pit” comes under the same consideration. And when we hear it asked, as it very lately has been, “Who DARE slay him?” I answer, if the laws of our country slay him, you ought to do likewise; and every good subject dares to do what the law allows. But the very position is begging the question: for the question, now in issue, is, whether either of the prisoners is a murderer, in the sense of our laws; for you recollect, that what is murder and what not, is a question of law, arising upon facts stated and allowed.  
But to go on; “You shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer, which is guilty of death.” Here again, is a begging the question; and more over the words “guilty of death,” if rightly rendered from the original, must be one of those general rules, I just now mentioned; which always have their exceptions. But those words seem to be wrong translated: for in the margin of our great bible, we find them rendered “faulty to die.” Against a position of t

 the learned Judge,) which through the ignorance or lenity of juries hath been sometimes brought within the rule of accidental death. It is where a blow aimed at one person lighteth upon another and killeth him. This, in a loose way of speaking, may be called accidental with regard to the person who dieth by a blow not intended against HIM. But the law considereth this case in a quite different light. If from circumstances it appeareth that the injury intended to A. be it by poison, blow, or ANY OTHER MEANS OF DEATH, would have amounted to murder, supposing him to have been killed by it, it will amount to the same offence if B. happeneth to fall by the same means. Our books say, that in this case the malice egreditur personam. But to speak more intelligibly, where the injury intended against A. proceeded from a wicked, murderous, or mischievous motive, the party is answerable for all the consequences of the action, if death ensues, from it, though it had not its effect upon the person whom he intended to destroy. The malitia I have already explained, the heart regardless of social duty DELIBERATELY bent upon mischief, consequently the guilt of the party is just the same in the one case as the other. On the other hand, if the blow intended against A. and lighting on B. arose from a sudden transport of passion which in case A. had died by it, would have been reduced to manslaughter, the fact will admit of the SAME ALLEVIATION if B. should happen to fall by i

fear or hate. There are no spontaneous  
or superfluous sentiments in the heart  
of man ; they are all the result of  
impressions on the senses. The  
credibility of a witness may also be  
diminished, by his being a member of a  
private society, whose customs and  
principles of conduct are either not  
known, or are different from those of  
the public. Such a man has not only his  
own passions, but those of.the society  
of which he is a member. Finally, the  
credibility of a witness is null, when  
the question relates to the words of a  
criminal; for the tone of voice, the  
gesture, all that precedes, accompanies  
and follows, the different ideas which  
men annex to the same words, may so  
alter and modify a man&#x27;s discourse, that  
it is almost impossible to repeat them  
precisely in the manner in which they  
were spoken. Besides, violent and  
uncommon actions, such as real crimes,  
leave a trace in the multitude of  
circumstances that attend them, and in  
their effects; but words remain only in  
the memory of the hearers, who are  
commonly negligent or prejudiced. It is  
infinitely easier then to found an  
accusation on the words, than on the  
actions of a man; for In these, the  
number of circumstances, urged against  
the accused, afford him variety of means  
of justification. OF ExVDENCE AND THE

[12.] We come now to an important point. It is alleged  
that the verdict is not only contrary to law, but unsupported by  
any legal and sufficient evidence to warrant the finding.  
  
Having already decided that the confessions of the prisoner  
were properly admitted, the force of this objection would seem  
to be entirely obviated ; for if the prisoner spoke the truth, he is  
guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  
  
But it is argued with great earnestness and ability, that con-  
fessions are the weakest of all evidence, and should always be  
received with suspicion; that words are often misreported,  
through ignorance, inattention or malice; and that at best, they  
are extremely liable to misconstruction ; moreover, that this spe-  
cies of evidence is not, in the usual course of things, to be dis-  
proved by that sort of negative evidence, by which the proof of  
’ plain facts, may be, and often is, confronted

## [CAPITAL PUNISHMENT. TO THE EDITOR.](http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/39823844)

has ever existed. Is it not reasonable  
to infer from this that capital  
punishment is not repugnant to God ? It  
is not my intention to contend for the  
application of this kind of punishment  
to such as are guilty of similar crimes  
to those subjected to it under the  
Jewish polity; but it is a remarkable  
fact that while redemption from the  
extreme penalty of the law might be made  
under that economy for several nos, no  
such redemption was allowed under any  
ciroumsUaoes for the crime of murder. In  
the 35th chapter of Numbers it ia said—&#x27;  
Ye 6hall take no satisfaction for the  
life of a murderer, which is guilty of  
death; but he shall surely be put to  
death,&#x27; Again it is said in the same

wherein ye are. for blood it defileth  
the land, and the land cannot be  
cleansed 0! the blood that ia shed  
therein, but by the blood of him that  
shed it&#x27; I am aware that a very common  
plea for the abolition of capital  
punishment is the abrogation of the  
Mosaio economy and the introduction of  
Chriatainity; but it should be borne in  
mind that the punishment of death for  
murder was instituted long before th
