there are arrived for us, in different ports of the US. 10 boxes of books from Paris, 7 from London, and from Germany I know not how many, but making in all perhaps about 25. boxes. Not one of these can be opened, until the Bookroom is completely finished, and all the shelves ready to recieve their charge directly from the boxes as they shall be opened. This cannot be till May. I hear nothing definitive of the 3. M. D. duty of which we are asking the remission from Congress.  
In selecting our Law-Professor, we must be rigorously attentive to his political principles. You will recollect that, before the revolution, Coke Littleton was the universal elementary book of Law Students; and a sounder whig never wrote, nor of profounder learning in the orthodox doctrines of the British constitution, or in what were called English liberties. You remember also that our lawyers were then all whigs. But when his blackletter text, and uncouth, but cunning learning got out of fashion, and the honied Mansfieldism of Blackstone became the Student’s Hornbook from that moment that Profession (the nursery of our Congress) began to slide into toryism, and nearly all the young brood of lawyers now are of that hue. They suppose themselves indeed to be whigs, because they no longer know what whiggism, or republicanism means. It is in our Seminary that that Vestal flame is to be kept alive.

The friendship which has subsisted between us, now half a century, and the harmony of our political principles and pursuits, have been sources of constant happiness to me thro’ that long period. And, if I remove beyond the reach of attentions to the University, or beyond the bourne of life itself, as I soon must, it will be a comfort to leave that institution under your care, and an assurance that they will neither be spared, nor ineffectual. It has also been a great solace to me to believe that you are engaged in vindicating to posterity the course we have pursued for preserving to them, in all their purity, the blessings of selfgovernment, which we had assisted too in acquiring for them. If ever the earth has beheld a system of administration conducted with a single and steadfast eye, to the general interest and happiness of those committed to it, one which, protected by truth, can never know reproach, it is that to which our lives have been devoted.
