l I came in from thence to Egypt where I arrived the 5th. of August. I begin this letter without knowing when I shall close it or when I shall send it—and indeed whether I ever shall send it: but I will have it ready in case an opportunity should offer. Having been in Cairo only 4 days I have not yet any thing curious or particularly interesting to begin with: indeed you will not expect much of that kind from me: my business is in another quarter and  the information I seek totaly new: any information from here whatever would not be so was I possessed of it. At all events I shall never be wholly without a subject when it is to you I write: I shall never think my letter a bad one when it contains the declarations of the esteem I have for you: of my gratitude, and of my affection for you, and this notwithstanding you thought hard of me for being employed by an english association which hurt me very much while I was at paris. You know your own heart and if my suspicions are groundless forgive them since they proceeded from the jealousy I have, not to loose the little regard you have in times past been pleased to honour me with. You are not obliged to esteem me, but I am obliged to esteem you, or to take leave of my senses and confront the opinions of the greatest and best characters I know of: if I cannot therefore address myself to you as a Man that you regard, I must write to you as one that regards you for your own sake, and for the sake of my country which has set me the example.  
I made the journey from Alexandria by water and entered the western branch of the mouths of the River Nile into the River. I was 5 days coming on the river to Cairo: but this passage is generally made in 4, sometimes in 3, days.  
You have heard and read much of this River, and so had I: but when I saw it I could not conceive it to be the same—it is a mere mud puddle compared with the accounts we have of it. What eyes do travellers see with—are they fools, or rogues. For heavens sake hear the plain truth about it: first with respect to its size: plain comparisons in such cases are good: do you know the river Connecticutt—of all the rivers I have seen it most resembles it in size: and being only a little wider may on that account better compare with the river Thames. This is the mighty the sovereign of rivers—the vast nile, that has been metaphored into one of the wonders of the world—let me be carefull how I read—and above all how I read Antient history!  
You have read and heard too of its inundations: it is a lye: the banks of this river were never entirely overflowed much more the meadows round it. If the thousands of large and small canals from it and the thousands of men and machines employed to communicate by artificial means the water of the nile to its meadows is the inundation meant it is true—any other is false. It is not an inundating river. I came up the River the 20th. of Augt. and about the 30th. of August the water is at its height i e the freshet: when I left the river its banks were 4 5 and 6 feet above water and here  in town I am told that they expect the nile to be 1 or 2 feet higher only—at the most. This is a proof if I wanted one that the banks of the nile are never overflowed. I have made a subject of it and transmited my observations to London: there I have said much at large about it: in a letter I cannot do it.  
I saw three of the pyramids as I passed up the River but they were 4 or 5 leagues off. If I see them nearer before I close my letter and

thern Egypt and are now encamped with an army pitifull enough about 3 miles southward of Cairo: they say—Bashaw Come out from your City and fight us—and the Bashaw says Come out of your entrenchments and fight me. You know that this revolt is a stroke in Russian politicks. Cairo is a wretched hole, and a nest of vagabonds. Nothing merits more the whole force of Burlesque than both the poetic and prosaic legends of this country. Sweet are the songs of Egypt on paper. Who is not ravished with gums, balms, dates, figgs, pomegrannates with the circassia and sycamores without knowing that amidst these ones eyes ears mouth nose is filled with dust eternal hot fainting winds, lice bugs musquetoes spiders flies—pox, itch leprosy, fevers, and almost universal blindness.

His letters from Cairo are full of interest. Of the Nile itself  
he speaks contemptuously, says it resembles the Connecticut in  
size, or may be compared with the Thames :-—  
  
‘ This,’ says he, ‘ is the mighty, the sovereign of rivers—the vast  
Nile, that has been metamorphosed into one of the wonders of the  
world! Let me be careful how I read, and, above all, how I read  
ancient history. You have heard, and read, too, much of its inunda-  
tions. If the thousands of large and small canals from it, and the  
thousands of men and machines employed to transfer, by artificial  
means, the water of the Nile to the meadows on its banks—if this be  
the inundation that is meant, it is true; any other is false: it is not an  
inundating river.’  
  
This is quite a new view of this celebrated river, and, like the  
descriptions of most objects that are new to the observer, and seen  
but cursorily or only once, is liable to the charge of misrepresenta-  
tion. ‘There are years when the country is not inundated, but these  
are years of scarcity, and happily not of frequent occurrence. He  
is equally out of humour with Egypt as with the river. Nothing,  
he says, is more deserving of the whole force of burlesque than  
both the poetic and prosaic legends of this country :—  
  
* Sweet are the songs of Egypt on paper. Whois not ravished with  
gums, balms, dates, figs, pomegranates, circassia, and sycamores, with-  
out recollecting that, amidst these are dust, hot and fainting winds,  
bugs, mosquitos, spiders, flies, leprosy, fevers, and almost universal  
blindness? I am in perfect health.’

LEDYARD&#x27;S ACCOUNT OF  
  
THE NILE  
  
In a letter to Mr. Jefferson, Led­  
yard gives the following account of  
this river below Grand Cairo:  
&quot;You have heard and read much  
of the Nile, and so had I; but when I  
saw it I could not conceive it to be  
the same. What eyes do travellers&quot;  
sec with?— Are they fools or rogues?  
For heaven&#x27;s sake hear the plain truth  
about it. First—in regard to its size.  
Obvious comparisons in such cases are  
| good. Do you know the river Con­  
i necticut? Of all the rivers I have  
seen, it most resembles that in size.  
It is a little wider, and may on that  
account compare better with the  
Thames. This is the mighty, the  
sovereign of rivers, the vast Nile, that  
has been metamorphosed into one of  
the wonders of the world. Let me  
be careful how I read, and above all  
how I read ancient history. You have  
heard and read too much ofits inunda­  
tions. If the thousands of large and  
small canals from it, and thousands of  
men and machines employed to trans­  
fer by artificial means the Water of the  
Nile to the meadows on its banks—if  
this be the inundation that is meant,  
it is true; any other is false. It is  
not an inundating river. I came up  
the river on the 15th to the 20th of  
August, and about the 20th, the wa­  
ter will be at the height of the fresh  
et. When I left the river, its banks  
were four, five or six feet above the  
water, and here in town I am told they  
expect the Nile to be only one or two  
feet higher at the most.&quot;  
In his journal transmitted to the  
African Society, under date of August  
14, 1783, he says—  
&quot; The view in sailing up the Nile  
is very confined, unless from the top  
of the mast, or some other eminence,  
and then it is an unbonnded plain of  
excellent land, miserably cultivated,  
and interspersed with a great number  
of villages, both on its banks, and as  
far along the meadows as one can see  
in any direction. The river is als

LEDYARD’S ACCOUNT OF THE NILE.  
  
In a letter to Mr. Jefferson, Ledyard gives the  
following account of this river below Grand Cai-  
roi—  
  
«‘ You have heard and read much of the Nile,  
and so had [; but when [ saw it I could not con-  
ceive it to be the same. What eyes do travel-  
lers see with? Are they fools or rogues? Fer  
heaven’s sake hear the plain truth about it.—  
First—in regard to its size. Obvious compari-  
sons in such cases are good. Do you knew the  
river Connecticut? Of all the rivers I have seen,  
it most resembles that in size. It is alittle wider,  
and may on that account compare better with  
the Thames. This is the mighty, the sovereign  
of rivers, the vast Nile, that has been metamor-  
phosed into one of the wonders of the world.—  
Let me be careful how I read, and above al! how  
I read ancient history. You have heard and  
read too, much of its inundations, If the thou-  
sands of large and small canals from it, and  
thousands of men and machines employed to  
transfer by artificial means the water of the  
Nile to the meadows on its banks—if this be the  
inundation that is meant, it is true; any other is  
false, It is not an inundating river. I came up  
the river onthe 15th to the 20th August, and  
about the 20th the water will be at the height of  
the freshet. When I left the river, its banks  
were four, five, or six feet above the water, and  
here in town I am told they expect the Nile to

His letters from Cairo are full of interest  
Of the Nile itself he speaks contemptuously,  
says it resembles the Connecticut in size, or  
may be compared with the Thames :—  
  
* This,” says he, “ is the mighty, the sove-  
reign of rivers—the vast Nile, that has been  
metamorphosed into one of the wonders of the  
world! Let me be careful how I read, and,  
above all, how I read ancient history. You  
have heard, and read, too, much of its inunda  
tions. If the thousands of large and small ca  
nals from it, and the thousands of men and  
machines employed to transfer, by artificial  
means, the water of the Nile to the meadows on  
its banks—if this be the inundation that is  
meant, it is true; any other is false: it is not  
an inundating river.”  
  
This is quite a new view of this celebrated  
river, and, like the descriptions of most objects  
that are new to the observer, and seen but  
cursorily or only once, is liable to the charge  
of misrepresentation. There are years when  
the country is not inundated, but these are years  
of scarcity, and happily not of frequent occur-  
rence. He is equally out of humour with Egypt  
as with the river. Nothing, he says, is more  
deserving of the whole force of burlesque than  
both the poetic and prosaic legends of this  
country :—  
  
“ Sweet are the songs of Egypt on paper

THE NILE.  
  
I made my tour from Alexandria by water,  
and entered the Nile by the western branch  
of the mouths of the river. ! was five days  
coming to Cairo, but this passage is general-  
ly made in four, and sometimes in three days.  
You have heard and read much of the Nile,  
and so had I; but when I saw it I could not  
conceive it to be the same. What eyes do  
travellers see with? Are they fools or

in regard to size Obvious comparisons in  
such cases are good. Do you know the river  
Connecticut? Of all the rivers I have seen,  
  
  
  
it resembles that in size. It is a little wider,  
and may on that account better compare with  
the Thames. This is the mighty, the sover-  
sign of rivers, the vast Nile that had been  
metamorphosed into one of the wonders of  
the world. Let me be careful how I read,  
and above all how I read ancient history.—  
You have heard and read, too much of its in-  
undations. If the thousands of large and  
small Canals from it, and the thousands of  
men and machines employed to transfer by  
artificial means the water of the Nile, to the
