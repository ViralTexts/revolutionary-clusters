Sir  
Monticello  
Sep. 24. 23.  
Your letter of Aug. 28 with the pamphlet accompanying it was not recieved until the 8th instant.That our creator made the earth for the use of the living and not of the dead; that those who exist not, can have no use nor right in it, no authority or power over it; that one generation of men cannot  foreclose or burthen it’s use to another, which comes to it in it’s own right, and by the same divine beneficence; that a preceding generation cannot bind a succeeding one by it’s laws or contracts; these deriving their obligation from the will of the existing majority, and that majority being removed by death  another  comes in it’s place, with a will equally free to make it’s own laws and contracts; these are axioms so self evident that no explanation can make them plainer. for he is not to be reasoned  who says that non-existence can controul existence, or that nothing can move something. they are axioms  also pregnant with salutary consequences.  The laws of civil society indeed for the encoragement of industry, give the property of the parent to his family on his death; and in most civilized countries permit him even to give it, by testament, to whom he pleases. And it is also found more convenient to suffer the laws of our predecessors to stand on our implied assent, as if positively re-enacted, until the existing majority positively repeals them. but this does not lessen the right of that majority to repeal, whenever a change of circumstances, or of will calls for it. habit alone confounds what is civil practice with natural right.  On the merits of the pamphlet I say nothing of course; having found it necessary to decline giving opinions on books, even when desired. for the functions of a Reviewer I have neither time, talent nor inclination and I trust that, on reflection, your indulgence will not think unreasonable my unwillingness to embark in an office of so little enticement. with my thanks for the pamphlet be pleased to accept the assurance of my great respect.Th: Jefferson

permit him to give it by testament to whom he pleases. And it is also found

or of will calls for it. Habit alone confounds civil practice with natural right.

MONTICELLO, SEPT. 24, 1823.  
  
Sir: Your letter of Aug. 28, with the  
pamphlet accompanying it, was not re  
ceived until the 18th inst. That our Cre-  
ator made the earth for the use of the  
living and not of the dead; that those  
who exist not can have no use nor rights  
in it, no authority or power over it; that  
one generation of men cannot foreclose or  
burden its use to another which comes to  
it in its own right and by the same Divine  
beneficence; that a preceding generation  
cannot bind asucceeding one by its laws or  
contracts, these deriving their obligation  
from the will of the existing majority,  
and that majority being removed by  
death, another comes in its place, with a  
will equally free to make its own laws  
and contracts—these are axioms so self-  
evident that no explanation can make  
them plainer; for he is not to be reasoned  
with who says that non-existence can  
control existence, or that nothing can  
move something. They are axioms also  
  
regnant with salutary consequences.  
The laws of civil society, indeed, for the  
encouragement of industry, give the prop-  
erty of the parent to his family on his  
death, and, in most civilized countries,  
permit him even to give it by testament  
to whom he pleases. And it is also found  
more convenient to suffer the laws to  
stand on our implied assent, as if posi-  
tively re-enacted, until the existing ma-  
jority positively repeals them; but this  
does not lessen the right of that majority  
to repeal whenever a change of circum-  
stances, or of will, calls for it; habit  
alone confounds civil practice with nat-  
ural right.  
  
With many thanks for the pamphlet, be  
pleased to accept the assurance of my  
great respect. THOMAS JEFFERSON
