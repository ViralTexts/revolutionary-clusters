It is an abatement of the satisfaction, with which I meet you, on the present occasion, that in felicitating you on a continuance of the national prosperity, generally, I am not able to add to it information, that the Indian hostilities, which have for some time distressed our N Western frontier, have terminated.

In looking forward to the future expences of the operations which may be necessary, I derive consolation from the information, I receive, that as far as the product of the revenues for the present year is known at the Treasury, there is a strong prospect that no additional burthens on the community will be requisite for the supplies of the ensuing year. This however will be better ascertained, in the course of the present session; and it is proper to add, that the information proceeds upon the supposition of no material extension of th

iendship with our neighbours. To do this we should make provision for rendering the justice we must sometimes require from them. I recommend therefore to your consideration whether the laws of the Union should not be extended to restrain our citizens from committing acts of violence within the territories of other nations, which would be punished were they committed within our own. And in general the maintenance of a friendly intercourse with foreign Nations will be presented to your attention, by the expiration of the law for that purpose, which takes place, if not renewed at the close of the present session.  
In execution of the authority given by the Legislature measures have been taken for engaging some artists from abroad to aid in the establishment of our Mint; others have been employed at home. Provision has been made of the requisite buildings, and these are now putting into proper condition for the purposes of the establishment. There has been also a small beginning in the coinage of half dismes and cents; the want of small coins in circulation calling the first attention to them.  
  
The regulation of foreign coins in correspondency with the principles of our national coinage will I doubt not be resumed and completed, being a matter essential to the due operation of the system and to order in our pecuniary concerns.  
It is represented that the regulations contained in the law which establishes the Post Office operate in experiment against the transmission of News Papers to distant parts of the Country. Should this, upon due inquiry, be found to be the fact, the Legislative wisdom will doubtless apply a remedy; under a full conviction of the great importance of facilitating the circulation of
