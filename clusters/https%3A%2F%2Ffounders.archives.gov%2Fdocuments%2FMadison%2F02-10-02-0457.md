“I had the Honor to forward to you by the last mail a copy of the official Journal of the Governor of this Territory from the 22d Jany to the 1st of July last, as it stands on Record in this office. Both the Governor &amp; myself wish to know whether you consider this the proper kind of Journal to be kept in the Secretarys Office, under the Ordinance of 1787. That Ordinance speaking of the Secretary says that ’it shall be his Duty to keep and preserve the Acts &amp; Laws passed by the Legislature, and the Public Records of the District, and the proceedings of the Governor in his Executive Department; and transmit authentic Copies of such Acts &amp; proceedings every Six months to the Secretary of Congress.’ I have no difficulty in understanding that I am to transmit copies of the acts of the Legislature and of the proceedings of the Governor in his Executive Departmen
