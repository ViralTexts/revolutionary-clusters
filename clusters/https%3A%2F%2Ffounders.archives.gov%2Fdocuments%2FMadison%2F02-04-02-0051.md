 graduated from Harvard in 1782. He began his law practice in Woburn and in 1795 moved to Cambridge, which he represented in several sessions of the Massachusetts legislature. In 1803 he moved to Saco, Maine, where he was elected state senator in 1804. An individual of “very singular” taste, he painted his Woburn house black and built a round red house in Saco. His satirical wit found a wide audience, and his eccentricities prompted the expression “as odd as Jo Bartlet” (Lucius R. Paige, History of Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1630–1877; With a Genealogical Register [Boston, 1877], p. 484; Ignatius Loyola Robertson [Samuel L.
