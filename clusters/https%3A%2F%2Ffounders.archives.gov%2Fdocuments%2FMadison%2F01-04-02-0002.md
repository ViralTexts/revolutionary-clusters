. Under his authority the limits of these States, while in the character of Colonies, were established; to these limits the U. S. considered as independt. sovereignties, have succeeded. Whatsoever territorial rights therefore, belonged to them before the revolution, were necessarily devolved upon them at the aera of independence.  
Those grounds support the assertion, that the U. S. are bounded, as they are declared to be in the instructions given to Mr. Adams on the  day of August 1779.

But by the prohibition to the Governors of the other Colonies than of Quebec, E. Florida or W. Florida, to grant warrants of survey, or pass patents, “for the present, and untill his (the Britis[h] King’s) farther pleasure sd. be known,” for any lands beyon[d] the heads or sources of any of the rivers which fall into the Atlantic ocean from the West &amp; North West, is strongly shewn an opinion that there were lands beyond the heads of those rivers, within the grants of the Governors.  
By the prohibition too to grant warrants of survey or pass patents for any lands whatever, which “not having been ceded to or purchased by the British King were reserved to the Indians or any of them,” a restriction of territory could not have been designed by a King, who granted the Charters to the Colonies, knowing that they would interfere with the rights of the Indians—who has always considered a cession or purchase from the Indians, not so much the source of a title as a milder means of preventing their hostility—who since the dat

No stress therefore ought to be laid on it, even if in its operation it abridged the boundaries of the States.
