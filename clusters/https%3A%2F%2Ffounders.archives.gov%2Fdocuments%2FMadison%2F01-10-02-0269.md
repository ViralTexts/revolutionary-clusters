ewn in the last paper, that the political apothegm there examined, does not require that the legislative, executive and judiciary departments should be wholly unconnected with each other. I shall undertake in the next place, to shew that unless these departments be so far connected and blended, as to give to each a constitutional controul over the others, the degree of separation which the maxim requires as essential to a free government, can never in practice be duly maintained.  
It is agreed on all sides, that the powers properly belonging to one of the departments, ought not to be directly and compleatly administered by either of the other departments. It is equally evident, that neither of them ought to possess directly or indirectly, an over-ruling influence over the others in the administration of their respective powers. It will not be denied that power is of an encroaching nature, and that it ought to be effectually restrained from passing the limits, assigned to it. After discriminating therefore in theory, the several classes of power, as they may in their nature be legislative, executive or judiciary; the next and most difficult task, is to provide some practical security for each against the invasion of the others. What this security ought to be, is the great problem to be solved.  
Will it be sufficient to mark with precision the boundaries of these departments in the constitution of the government, and to trust to these parchment barriers against the encroaching spirit of power? This is the security which appears to have been principally relied on by the compilers of most of the American constitutions. But experience assures us that the efficacy of the provision has been greatly over-rated; and that some more adequate defence is indispensably necessary for the more feeble, against the more powerful members of the government. The legislative department is every where extending the sphere of its activity, and drawing all power into its impetuous vortex.  
The founders of our republics have so much merit for the wisdom which they have displayed, that no task can be less pleasing than that of pointing out the errors into which they have fallen. A respect for truth however obliges us to remark, that they seem never for a moment to have turned their eyes from the danger to liberty from the overgrown and all-grasping prerogative of an hereditary magistrate, supported and fortified by an hereditary branch of the legislative authority. They seem never to have recollected the danger from legislative usurpations, which by assembling all power in the same hands, must lead to the same tyranny as is threatened by executive usurpations.  
In a government, where numerous and extensive prerogatives are placed in the hands of a hereditary monarch, the executive department is very justly regarded as the source of danger, and watched with all the jealousy which a zeal for liberty ought to inspire. In a democracy, where a multitude of people exercise in person the legislative functions, and are continually exposed by their incapacity for regular deliberation and concerted measures, to the ambitious intrigues of their executive magistrates, tyranny may well be apprehended on some favourable emergency, to start up in the same quarter. But in a representative republic, where the executive magistracy is carefully limited both in the extent and the duration of its power; and where the legislative power is exercised by an assembly, which is inspired by a supposed influence over the people with an intrepid confidence in its own strength; which is sufficiently numerous to feel all the passions which actuate a multitude; yet not so numerous as to be incapable of pursuing the objects of its passions, by means which reason prescribes; it is against the enterprising ambition of this department, that the people ought to indulge all their jealousy and exhaust all their precautions.  
The legislative department derives a superiority in our governments from other circumstances. Its constitutional powers being at once more extensive and less susceptible of precise limits, it can with the greater facility, mask under complicated and indirect measures, the encroachments which it makes, on the co-ordinate departments. It is not unfrequently a question of real nicety in legislative bodies, whether the operation of a particular measure, will, or will not extend beyond the legislative sphere. On the other side, the executive power being restrained within a narrower compass, and being more simple in its nature; and the judiciary being described by land marks, still less uncertain, projects of usurpation by either of these departments, would immediately betray and defeat themselves. Nor is this all: As the legislative department alone has access to the pockets of the people, and has in some constitutions full discretion, and in all, a prevailing influence over the pecuniary rewards of those who fill the other departments, a dependence is thus created in the latter, which gives still greater facility to encroachments of the former.  
I have appealed to our own experience for the truth of what I advance on this subject. Were it necessary to verify this experience by particular proofs, they might be multiplied without end. I might collect vouchers in abundance from the records and archives of every state in the union. But as a more concise and at the same time, equally satisfactory evidence I will refer to the example of two states, attested by two unexceptionable authorities.  
The first example is that of Virginia, a state which, as we have seen, has expressly declared in its constitution, that the three great departments ought not to be intermixed. The authority in support of it is Mr. Jefferson, who, besides his other advantages for remarking the operation of the government, was himself the chief magistrate of it. In order to convey fully the ideas with which his experience had impressed him on this subject, it will be necessary to quote a passage of some length from his very interesting “Notes on the state of Virginia.” (p. 195) “All the powers of government, legislative, executive and judiciary, result to the legislative body. The concentrating these in the same hands is precisely the definition of despotic government. It will be no alleviation that these powers will be exercised by a plurality of hands, and not by a single one. One hundred and seventy-three despots would surely be as oppressive as one. Let those who doubt it turn their eyes on the republic of Venice. As little will it avail us that they are chosen by ourselves. An elective despotism was not the government we fought for; but one which should not only be founded on free principles, but in which the powers of government should be so divided and balanced among several bodies of magistracy, as that no one could transcend their legal limits, without being effectually checked and restrained by the others. For this reason, that convention which passed the ordinance of government laid its foundation on this basis, that the legislative, executive and judiciary departments, should be separate and distinct, so that no person should exercise the powers of more than one of them at the same time. But no barrier was provided between these several powers. The judiciary and executive members were left dependent on the legislative for their subsistence in office, and some of them for their continuance in it. If therefore the legislature assumes executive and judiciary powers, no opposition is likely to be made; nor if made can be effectual; because in that case, they may put their proceeding into the form of an act of assembly, which will render them obligatory on the other branches. They have accordingly in many instances decided rights which should have been left to judiciary controversy; and the direction of the executive, during the whole time of their session, is becoming habitual and familiar.”  
The other state which I shall have for an example, is Pennsylvania; and the other authority the council of censors which assembled in the years 1783 and 1784. A part of the duty of this body, as marked out by the constitution, was “to enquire whether the constitution had been preserved inviolate in every part; and whether the legislative and executive branches of government had performed their duty as guardians of the people, or assumed to themselves, or exercised other or greater powers than they are entitled to by the constitution.” In the execution of this trust, the council were necessarily led to a comparison, of both the legislative and executive proceedings, with the constitutional powers of these departments; and from the facts enumerated, and to the truth of most of which, both sides in the council subscribed, it appears that the constitution had been flagrantly violated by the legislature in a variety of important instances.  
A great number of laws had been passed violating without any apparent necessity, the rule requiring that all bills of a publick nature shall be previously printed for the consideration of the people; although this is one of the precautions chiefly relied on by the constitution, against improper acts of the legislature.  
The constitutional trial by jury had been violated; and powers assumed, which had not been delegated by th

uence; unauthorised measures would of course be more freely hazarded, than where the executive department is administered by a single hand or by a few hands.  
The conclusion which I am warranted in drawing from these observations is, that a mere demarkation on parchment of the constitutional limits of the several departments, is not a sufficient guard against those encroachments which lead to a tyrannical concentration of all the powers of government in the same hands

beautiful in theory, would be a defect in practice;—that unless  
the three departments were so far connected and blended, as to  
give to each a constitutional contro] over the others, the-de-  
gree of separation essential to a free government, could never  
be duly maintained. The Convention, moreover, had no pre-  
cedent of an entire independence of the several departments  
on each other, either in the British constitution, or in any of  
the state governments, in all of which there is a partial mix-  
ture of powers.  
  
The true sense in which the preservation of liberty, may be  
said to require, that the three departments should be kept se-  
parate and distinct, is, according to the writers of the Fede-  
ralist, this:—that the powers properly belonging to one of  
the departments, should not be directly, and completely admi-  
nistered by cither of the other two; and that in reference to  
each other, neither of them should possess, directly or indi-  
rectly, an overruling influence in the administration of their  
respective powers. Such, likewise was the reasoning of the  
Convention on this subject, who appear also to have thought  
with the same writers, that after discriminating in theory the  
several classes of power, as they might in their nature be legis-  
lative, executive, or judiciary, the next, and most difficult task,  
was to provide some practical security for each, against the

Hi invasion of the others. The expedient adopted by the Conven-  
q tion, is equally consonant to the dictates of reason, and to the  
i lessons of experience. It was not as the Federalist expresses  
| it, sufficient in their judgment, to mark with precision the  
  
boundaries of the three departments in the scheme of the  
| constitution. Parchment barriers they knew to be of but  
| little avail when opposed either to state necessity,—to the  
| encroaching spirit of power,—or to the headlong intem-  
f perance of faction; nor would the mere general responsibility  
of all the members of the government to the people, or the  
f expedient of making appeals to the latter, or of calling con-  
i ventions whenever usurpations occurred, have been effectual,  
f m their opinion, to restrain the departments within their legal  
ii limits. The considerations which led them to this conclusion,  
  
are fully developed in the Federalist, and merit an attentive  
4 perusal.

be so far connected and blended, ‘as to give each a constitution-

some practical security for each, against the invasion of the

legislative authority; but ‘‘they seem never to have recollected

several departments were kept absolutely isting and the re-  
sult of the experience of the country, upon a Very extended  
scale, is, that for the assurance of the degree of separation es-  
sential to free government, these departments must be so far  
blended, as to give to each a constitutional controul over the  
others.  
  
It is universally admitted that the powers properly belonging  
to one, should not be directly and fully administered by either  
of the other departments. It is not less clear, that neither de-  
partment should possess, directly or indirectly, overruling in-  
fluence upon the others. After discriminating, therefore, in  
theory, the several classes of power, as they may in their na-  
ture be legislative, executive, or judicial, the next, and most  
difficult task, was to provide some practical security for each,  
against the invasion of the others. The expedients for thi

‘In a government where numerous and extensive prerogatives are placed  
in the hands of a hereditary monarch, the executive department is very  
justly regarded as the source of danger, and watched with all the jealousy  
which a zeal for liberty ought to inspire. In a democracy, where a mul-  
titude of people exercise, in person, the legislative functions, and are  
continually exposed, by their incapacity for regular deliberation and con-  
certed measures, to the ambitious intrigues of their executive magistrates,  
tyranny may well be apprehended, on some favourable emergency, to start  
up in the same quarter. But in a representative republic, where the ex-  
ecutive magistracy is carefully limited, both in the extent and the duration

intrepid confidence in its own strength; which is sufficiently numerous to  
feel all the passions which actuate a multitude, yet not so numerous as to  
be incapable of pursuing the objects of its passions, by means which rea-

the powers of eoveriiment should be so  
divided and balanced among several

could not transcend their legal limit  
without being effectually checked and re­

thxt convention which passed the ordi­

on this basis: That the legislative, ex­

be separate and distinct so that no per  
son should exrc;se the powers of more  
than one of thci at the same time, but  
no barrier was provided between theso  
several powers ; the judiciary and exec­  
utive members were left dependent on  
the legislative for their subsistence in  
office, and some of them for their continu  
ance in it lf,therefore,the legislature as­  
sumes executive and judiciary powers no  
opposition is likely to be made, nor if  
made, can be effectual, because iu that  
case they may put their proceedings into  
the form of an act of assembly, which  
will render them obligatory on the other

Mr. Jefferson, in referring to the early  
constitution of Virginia, objected that by its  
provisions all the powers of government  
egislative, executive, and judicial-resulted  
to the legislative body, holding that &quot;the  
concentrating these in the same hands is pre­  
cisely the definition of despotic government.  
It will be no alleviation that these power  
will be exercised by a plurality of hands, and  
not by a single one. Oe hundred and ser  
despots would surely be as op­  
pressive as one. &quot;As little will it avail us  
that they are chosen by ourselves. An elec­  
tive despotism was not the Government we  
fought for, but one which should not only be  
founded on free principles, but in which the  
powers of government should bese dividedand  
alanced among several bodies of magistracy  
as that no one could transcend their legal limits  
without being effectually checked and re­  
strained by the others. For this reason that  
convention which passed the ordinance of  
government laid its foundation on this basis,  
that the legislative, executive, and judiciary  
departments should be separate and distinct,  
so that no person should exercise the powers  
of more than one of them at the same time.  
But no barrier was provided between these sev­  
eral powers. The judiciary andexecutive mem­  
bers were left dependent on the legislative  
for their subsistence in office, and some of  
them for their continuance in it. If, there­  
fore, the Legislature assumes executive and  
judiciary powers, no opposition is likely to be  
made, nor, if made, can be efectual, because  
in that case they may put their proceedings  
into the form of an act of assembly, which  
will render thein obligatory on the other  
branches. They have accordingly, in many  
instances, decided rights which should have  
been left to judiciary controversy; and the  
direction of the executive, during the whole  
time of their session, is becoming habitual  
and familiar.

Mt. Jefferson, in referring to the early constitution  
of Virginia, objected that hy its provisions all the  
powers of government-legislative, executive and  
judicial-resulted to tho legislative body holding,  
that thc concentrating these in the same hands  
is precisely the definition of despotic government.  
It will be no alleviation that there is a plurality of  
hands and not a single one-one hundred and  
seventy-three despots would surely be as oppres?  
sive as one. As little will it avail us that they aro  
chosen by ourselves. An elective despotism was  
not the government we fought for, but ono which  
should not only be founded on freo principles, but  
in which the powers of government should be so  
divided and balanced among several bodies of  
magistracy, as that no one could transcend their  
legalities without being effectually checked and re?  
strained by tho others. Por this reason the con?  
vention which passed the ordinance of government  
laid its foundation on this basis, that the legisla?  
tive, executive and judiciary departments should  
be separate and distinct, so that no person should  
exorcise the powers of moro than ono of them at  
tho samo time.  
But no barrier was provided between theso seve?

bers were loft dependent on the legislative for  
their subsistence m office, and some of them for  
their continuance in it. If, therefore, the legisla?  
ture assumes executive and judiciary powers, no  
opposition, is likely to he made, nor,&quot; ii made, can  
bo effectual, because, in that case, they may put  
their proceedings into the form of an Act of As?

ts impetuons vortex.&quot; The found­  
ers of our republic seem never to have recol­  
lected the danger from legislative asurpations,  
which, by assembling all power in the same  
hands, must lead to the same tyranny as is  
threatened by Executive usurpations.  
In a representative republican government  
where the Executive magistracy is carefully  
limited, both in the extent and the duration of  
its power, and where the legislative power is  
exercised by an assembly, which is inspired by  
a supposed influence over the people, with an  
intrepid conlidence in its own strength which  
is sufficiently numerous to feel all the passions  
which actuate a multitude, yet not so nume-­  
rous as to be incapable of pursuing the objects  
of its passion by means which reason pre-­  
scribed. It is against the enterprising ambi­  
tion of this department that the people ought  
to indulge all their jealousy and exhaust all  
their precaution. The legislative department  
derives a superiority in our Government from  
other circumstances. Its conslitutional powers  
being at once more extensive and less sus-­  
ceptible of precise limits, it can, with the  
greater facility, mask under complicated and  
indiscreet measures, the encroachments which  
it makes in the co-ordinate departments. On  
the other side, the Executive power, being re­  
strained within a narrower compass, and being  
more simple in its nature, and the judiciary  
being described by landmarks still less uncer-­  
tain, projects of United States usurpation by  
either of these departments would iinme-­  
diately betray and defeat theruselves. Nor is  
this all: As the legislative department alone  
has access to the pockets of the people, and has  
in some constitutions full discretions, and in  
all a prevailing influence over the pecuniary  
rewards of those who fill the other depart­  
ments, a dependence is thus created in the latter  
which gives still greater facility to encroach-­  
ments of the former.

expense of the other departments. Mr. Jefe­  
ferson, in referring to the early constitution  
of Virginia, objected, that by its provisions  
all powers of Government, legislative, execue­  
live, and judicial, resulted to the legislative  
body, holding that the concentrating of these  
in the same hands is precisely the definition  
of a despotic government. It will be no alle:  
vlation that these powers will be exercised  
by a piurality of hands, and not by a slagie  
one. One hundred and seventy-three despots  
would surely be as oppressive as one. As  
little will it availl as that they are chosen by  
ourselves. An elective despotiem was not the  
government fought for, bat one which should  
not only be founded on free principles, but  
in which the powers of Government should  
be so decided and balanced among several  
bodies of magistracy as that no one could  
transcend their legal lmits without being  
effectually checked and restrained by the  
others. For this reason that convention  
which passed the ordinance of government  
laid its foundation on this basis, that the le-­  
gislative, executive, and judiciary depart.  
ments should be separate and distinct, so that  
no person should exercise the powers of more  
than one of them at the same time, but no  
barrier was provided between these separate  
powers. The judiciary, and executive mem­  
bers were left dependent on the legislative for  
their subelstence in office, and some of them  
for their continnance in it. If, therefore, the  
iegislative assumes sxecutive and judiciary  
  
powers, no opposition is likely to be made, nor  
f made, can be effectual, because in that case  
they may put their procesdings into the form  
of an act of assembly, which will render them  
obligatory on the otter branches. They have  
aecordingly, In mang instanees, decided righits  
which ahould have beea lefs to judicial contree­  
veray, and the direction of the Excentivedue­

Mr. JefTeiwon, in referring V the early Constf -f  
tuiiou oi ii;iiiin, uiijiwu mat, uy iia pro­  
vision, all tho power ot government, legisla  
tivc, executive and judicial, resulted to the  
legislative bdy,. holding that &quot;the concentra­  
ting these in the same bands is precisely the  
definition of despotic government. It Will be  
no alleviation that these powers will lie exer­  
cised Ity a jrturality of hands, afld not by  
single one. Cue hundred and seventy-three  
despot would surely be a oppressive as one.&quot;  
TAa Uule-wili it avail a that they are- chosen  
for ourselywt, A? elective despotiatn, , was not  
the Government we fought for, but one which  
should not only be founded on free principle,  
bat in which the powers ot goTernroaat should  
  
be so divided snd balanced among several  
bodies of our magistracy as that no one could  
transcend their legal limits without being ef­  
fectually checked and restrained by the others.  
For this reason, that Convention which passed  
the ordinance of government laid it founda­  
tion on this basis, that the Legislative, Execu­  
tive, and Judiciary Departments should be sep­  
arate and distinct, so that no person should &#x27;ex­  
ercise the powers of more than one of tbem at  
the same time. But no barrier was provided  
between these several power. The Judiciary  
and Executive members were left dependent on  
the Legislative for their subsistence In office,  
aad some ot them for their continuance in it.  
If, therefore, tbe Legislature assumes executive  
and judiciary powers, no opposition is likely to  
be made, nor, if made, can be effectual ; because,  
in that case, they may pot their proceedings  
into the form of an act of Assembly, which  
wil render them obligatory on the other  
branches. Tbey hare accordingly, in &quot; many  
instances, decided right which should have  
been left to judiciary controversy ; and the di­  
rection of the Executive, during tbe whole  
time of their session, is becoming habitual and  
familiar.

expense of the other departments.  
Mr. Jefferson, in referring to the early  
Constitution of Virginia, objected  
that by its provisions all the powers  
of Government, legislative, executive,  
and judicial, resulted to the legislative  
body. oon t ar beta,  
Holding that the concentrating of  
these in the same hands is precisely  
the definition of despotic government,  
it will be no talleviation that these  
powers will be exercised by a plurali­  
ty of hands, and not by a single one.  
One hundred and seventy-three des­  
pots would surely be as oppressive as  
one.  
As little as it will avail us that they  
are chosen by ourselves, an elective  
despotism was not the Government  
we fought for, but one which should  
not only be founded on free principles,  
but in which powers of Government  
should be so divided and balanced  
among the several bodies of the mag­  
istracy as no one could transcend  
their legal limits without being effect­  
ually checked and restrained by the  
others.  
For this reason that convention  
which passed the ordinance of gov­  
ernment, laid its foundations on this  
basis, that the legislative, executive,  
and judiciary departments should be  
separate and distinct, so that no  
person should exercise the powers of  
more than one of them at the same  
time. But no barrier was provided  
between these several powers. The  
judiciary and executive members were  
left dependent on the legislative for  
their subsistence in office, and some  
of them for their continuance in it.  
If therefore, the legislature as­  
sumes executive and judiciary powers,  
no opposition is likely to be made,  
nor, if made, can be effectual, be­  
cause, in that case, they may put their  
proceedings into the form of an act of  
Assembly, which will render them  
obligatory on the other branches.  
They have accordingly, in many in­  
stances, decided rights which should  
have been left to the judiciary. Con-

The leglelative department dorives, a supd  
riority in our government from other circum  
stances. Its constitutional powers being at  
once more extensive and less susceptible of  
precise limits, it can with the greater facili­  
ty mask, under complicated and indirect  
measures, the encroachments which it makes  
on the co-ordinate departments. On the oth-  
er side, the executive power being restrained  
within a narrower compass and being more  
simple in its nature, and the judiciary being  
described by landmarks still less uncertain,  
projects of usurpation by either of these de-,  
partments would immediately betray and de  
fent themselves. Nor is this all. As the leg-  
islative Department alone has access to the  
pockets of the people, and has, in some con-  
stitutions, full discretion, and, in all, a pre-,  
vailing influence over the pecuniary rewards,  
of those composing other departments, ad­  
pendence is thus created in the latter which  
gives still greater facility to encroachments  
of the former.

either i.f these departments would immediately

As the Legislati&#x27;. e depai tmi nt alone bnt access to

thus created in the latter which gives still

We have seen the tendency of republican jrov-  
ernnionls is lo an aggrandisement of the legisla­  
tive at the expense of the otlier departments.&quot;  
Mr. Jefferson, In referring to the early Consti-  
ution or Virginia, objected that, by its pro-  
isions, all the powers ot government, legisla  
tive, executive and judicial, resulted to tbe  
gislative body, holding that &#x27;&#x27;tho concentra  
ting these in the same hands is precisely the  
definition ef despotic government. ) It will be  
no alleviation that these powers will be exer­  
cised by a plurality of bands, and not by a,  
single one. , One hundred .and &#x27;seventy-three  
luspots would surely be as oppressive as one.&quot;  
As little will it avail us that they are chosen  
yourselves. An elective despotism was not  
the Government we fought for, but one which  
should not only be founded on free principles,  
but in which the powers ot government should  
be so divided and balanced among several  
bodies of our magistracy as that no one could  
transcend their legal limits without being ef­  
fectually checked arid restrained by the others;  
For this reason, that Convention which passed,  
the ordinance of government laid its founda­  
tion ori this basis, that the Legislative, Execu­  
tive, and Judiciary Departments should be sep­  
arate and distinct, so that no person should ex­  
ercise the powers of more than one of them at  
the same time. &#x27; But no barrier was provided  
between these several powers. - Tbe Judiciary  
and Executive members were left dependent on  
the Legislative for their Btibsistenco In office,  
and soma of them for their continuance in it.  
If, therefore, the Legislature assumes executive  
and judiciary powers, no opposition is likely&#x27; to  
be made, nor, if made, can be effectual ; because,  
In t1i6tC950, theyniay put-their proceedings  
into the form hf an set of Assembly, which  
will render them obligatory on., the other  
branches. They Imve accordingly, in many  
instances, decided rights which should .have  
been Jolt to judiciary controversy; and the di  
rection of the&#x27; Executive; during the - whole  
time of their session, is becoming&#x27; habitual and  
familiar.&quot; &#x27;&#x27;.-.

from legislative usurpations, which, by

which is sufficiently numerous to feel all   
the passions which actuate a multitude, yet   
not so numerous as to be incapable of pur-

The legislative department derives a su­  
periority in our governments from other   
circumstances. Its constitutional powers   
being at once more extensive and less sus­

&quot;on the other side, the executive power

Mr. Jefferson, in referring to the early   
constitution of Virginia, objected that by   
its provisions all the powers of government   
—legislative, executive and judicial—re­  
sulted to the legislative body, holding that   
&quot;the concentrating these in the same hands   
is precisely the definition of despotic gov   
ernment. It will be no alleviation that   
these powers will be exercised by a plural­  
ity of hands, and not by a single one. One   
hundred and seventy-three despots &#x27;would   
surely be as aggressive as one.&quot; &quot;As little   
will it avail us that they are chosen by our­  
selves. An elective despotism was not the   
government we fought for, but one which   
should not only be founded on free princi­  
ples, but in which the powers of govern­  
ment should be so divided and balanced   
among several bodies of mag,istracy as that   
no one could transcend their legal limits   
without being effectually checked and re­  
strained by the others. For this reason   
that convention which passed the ordinance   
of government laid its foundation on this   
basis, that the legislative, executive and   
judiciary departments should be separate   
and distinct, so that no person should ex­  
ercise the powers of more than one of them   
at the same time. But no barrier was pro­  
vided between these several powers. The   
judiciary and executive members were left   
dependent on the legislative for their sub­  
sistence in office, and some of them for their   
continuance iu it. If, therefore, the legisla­  
ture assumes executive andjudiciary   
powers, no opposition is likely to be made;   
nor if made, can be effectual, because, in   
that case, they may put their proceedings   
into the form of an act of assembly, which   
will render them obligatory on the other   
branches. They have, accordingly, in   
many instances, decided rights which   
should have been left to judiciary contro­  
versy, and the direction of the Executive,   
during the whole tune of their session, is   
becoming habitual and familiar.&quot;

Mr. Jefferson, in referring to the early  
Constitution of Virginia, objected that  
by Its provisions all toe powers of govern­  
ment— legislative, executive, and Judicial  
—resulted to tho, legislative body, hold­  
ing that “ the concentrating these in tbe  
same hands Is precisely tho definition of  
despotic government. It will be no alle­  
viation that these powers will be exer­  
cised by a plurality of bands, and not by  
a single one. One hundred and seveuty­  
threo despots would surely be as oppres­  
sive as due.” As little will it avoil us that  
they ate chosen by ourselves. An elec­  
tive despotism was not the Government  
we fought for, but one which should not  
only be founded on free principles, but in  
which the powers of government should  
be so divided and balanced among sever­  
al bodies of magistracy as that no one  
could transcend their legal limits with­  
out being effectually checked and re­  
strained by tbe others. For this reason  
that Convention which passed the ordl­  
nance of government laid its foundation  
on the basis, that the Legislative, Exec­  
utive and Judiciary Departments should  
be separate aud distinct, so that no per­  
son should exercise the powers of more  
than one of them at the same time. But  
no barrier was provided between these  
several powers. The J udlolary and Ex»  
ecutive members were left dependent on  
the Legislative far their subsistence in  
office, and.some of them for their contin­  
uance in it. If, therefore, toe Legisla­

early Constitution of Virginia, objected  
that by its provisions all powers of Gov  
ernment, legislative, executive and judicial,  
resulted to the legislative body, holding  
that the concentration there in the same

these powers will be exercised by a plural­

it avail us that they are chosen by our­

Government we fought for, but one which  
should not only be founded on free princi­  
ples, but in which the powers of Govern­  
ment should be so divided and balanced  
among general bodies of magistracy, that  
no one could transcend their legal limits  
without being effectually checked and re­  
strained by the others. For this reason  
that convention which passed the ordinance

basis,-that the legislative, executive and  
judiciary departments should be separate

Mr. Jesferson, in referring to the early  
Constitution of Virginia, objected that, by  
  
its provisions, all the powers of govern  
ment,--legislative, executive and judicial,

government. It will be no alleviation that

One hundred and seventy-three despot

&quot;As little will it avail us that they are

tism was not the Government we fought for.  
but one which should not only be founded  
on free principles, but in which the powers  
of Government should be so divided and  
halanced among several bodies of our ma­  
gistracy as that no one could transcend their  
legal limits without being effectually check  
ed and restrained by the others. For this  
reason, that Convention which passed the  
ordinance of government laid its found  
tion on this basis, that the Legislative, Exe­  
cutive, and Judiciary Departments should  
be separate and distinct, so that no person  
should exercise the powers of more than one  
of them atithe same time. But no barrier  
was provided between these several powers.  
The Judiciary and Executive member  
were left dependent on the Legislative for  
their subsistence in office, and some of them  
for their continuance in it. If, therefore,  
the Legislature assumes executive and ju­  
diciary powers, no opposition is likely to  
be made, nor, if made, can be effectual; be  
cause, in that case, they may put their pro­  
ceedings in to the form of swact of Assem­

The Legislative Department derives its  
superiority in our Governments from other  
circumstances. Its constitutional powers  
being at once more extensive and It  
  
pow  
  
ceptible of precise limits, it can with great-­  
er facility mask under complicated and in-­  
direct measures the encroachments which it  
makes on the co-ordinate departments. It  
is not unfrequently a question of real nicety  
legislative bodies, whother the operation  
of a particular measure will or will not ex-­  
tend beyond the legislative sphere. On the  
  
the executive power being re-  
  
in its nature, and the ju-  
  
diciary being described by landmarks still  
uncertain, projects of usurpation by  
either of these departments would imme  
diately betray and defeat themselves. Nor  
is this all. As the Legislative Department  
alone has access to the pockets of the peo-­  
ple, and has in some constitutions a full dis  
cretion, and in all a prevailing influence over  
the pecuniary rewards of those wno fill the  
 other departments, a dependence in thus  
creating in the latter which gives still great-­  
 er facility to encroachments of the former.

The first example is that of Virginia, a  
State which, as we have seen, has expressly  
leclared in its Constitution that the three  
great departments ought not to be inter-­  
mixed. The authority in support of it is  
  
Jefferson, who, besides his other advan-­  
tages for remarking the operations of the  
government, was himself the chief magis-­  
trate of the State. In order to convey fully  
the ideas with which his experience had  
impressed him on this subject it will be nec-­  
es ary to quote a passage of some length  
from his very interesting &quot;Notes on the  
ate of Virginia,&quot; (195  
&quot;All the power of government--legisla-­  
tive, executive, and judiciary, result to the  
legislative body. The concentrating of these  
in the same hands is precisely the definition  
of despotic government. It will be no al­  
leviation that these powers will be exercised  
by a plurality of hands and not by a single  
one. One hundred and seventy-five de  
pots would surely be as oppressive as one.  
Let those who doubt it turn their eyes on  
the Republic of Venice. As little will it  
avall us that they are chosen by ourselves.  
An elective despotism is not the govern-­  
ment we fought for; but one which should  
not only be founded on free principles, but  
in which the powers of Government should  
be so divided and balanced among several  
bodies of the magistracy as that no one  
could transcend their legal limits without  
being effectually checked and restrained by  
the others. For this reason that Conven-­  
tion which passed the ordinance of govern-­  
ment laid its foundation on this basis, that  
the Legislative, Executive and Judictary  
Departments should be separate and dis-­  
tinct, so that no person should exercise the  
powers of more than one of them at the  
same time. But no barrier was provided  
between these several powers. The Judic.  
ary and Executive members were left de-

the form of an act of Assembly, which will  
  
render them obligatory on the oth  
branches. They have, accordingly, in many  
instances decided rights which should have  
been left to judiciary controversy, and the  
lirection of the Executive during the whole  
time of their session is becoming habitual  
and familiar.&quot;  
The other State which I shall take for an  
example is Pennsylvania, and the other au-­  
thority the Council of Censors, which as  
sembled in the years 1783 and 1784. A part  
of the duty of this body, as marked out by  
the Costitution, was &quot;to inquire whether  
the Constitution had been preserved invio-­  
late in every part, and whether the Legisla­  
tive and Executive branches of Government  
had performed their duty is guardians of  
the people, or assumed to themseives or ex-­  
ercised other or greater powers than they  
are entitled to by the Constitution.&quot; In the  
execution of this trust the Council were nec-­  
essarily led to a comparison of both the Leg-­  
islative and Executive proceedings with the  
conatitutional powers of the e deartments,  
and from the facts enumerated, and to the  
truth of most of which both sides in the  
Council subscribed, it appears that the Con-­  
stitution had been flagrantly violated by the  
Legislature in a variety of important in  
stances.

From the Federalist.  
In a government where numerous and  
extensive prerogatives are placed in the  
hands of an hereditary monarch, the ex-  
ecutive department is very justly regarded  
as the source of danger, and watched with  
all the jealousy which a zeal for liberty  
ought to inspire. In a democracy, where  
a multitude of people exercise in person  
the legislative functions, and are continu­  
ally exposed by the incapacity for regular  
deliberation and concerted measures to  
the ambitious intrigues of their executive  
magistrates, tyranny may well be appre  
hended, on some favorable emergency, to  
start up in the same quarter. But in a  
a  o o o o o e e o e o e e e eo o  
representative republic, where the execu  
tive magistracy is carefully limited, both  
in the extent and duration of its power,  
and where the legislative power is exer­  
cised by an assembly which is inspired by  
a supposed influence over the people, with  
an intrepid confidence in its own strength,  
which is sufficiently numerous to feel all  
the passions which actuate a multitude,  
yet not so numerous as to be incapable of  
pursuing the objects of its passions by  
means which reason prescribes, it is against  
the enterprising ambition of this depart-  
ment that the people ought to indulge all  
their jealousy and exhaust all their pre  
cautions.  
The legislative department derives its  
superiority in our government from other  
eircumstances. Its constitutional powers  
being at once more extensive and less sus  
ceptible of precise limits, it can with great-  
er facility mask under complicated and in  
direct measures the encroachments which  
it makes on the co-ordinate departments.  
It is not unfrequently a question of real  
nicety in legislative bodies, whether the  
operation of a particular measure will or  
will not extend beyond the legislative  
legislative department alone has access to  
the pockets of the people, and has in some  
constitutions a full discretion, and in all a  
prevailing influence over the pecuniary  
rewards of those who fill the other depart­  
ments, a dependence is thus created in the  
latter which gives still greater facility to  
encroachments of the former.  
I have appealed to our own experience  
for the truth of what I advance on this  
subject. Were it necessary to verify this  
experience by particular proofs, they  
might be multiplied without end. I might  
collect vouchers in abundance from the  
records and archives of every state in the  
union. But as a more concise and at the  
same time equally satisfactory evidence, I  
will refer to the example of two states, at-  
tested by two unexceptional authorities.  
The nist example is that of Virginia, a  
state, which, as we have seen, has express­

by the Legisiative Modyse  
The Warning of the  
  
Fathers.  
  
Irem the rederalist I  
  
In a Government where numerous  
and extensive perrogatives are plac  
in hands of an hereditary monarch,  
the executive department is very  
justly regarded as the source of dan-­  
ger, and watched with all the jeal-­  
ousy which a zeal for liberty ought to  
inspire. In a democracy, where a  
multitude of people exercise in per-­  
son the legislative functions, and are  
continually exposed by their inca-­  
pacity for regular deliberation and  
concerted measures to the ambitious  
intrigues of their executive magis-­  
trates, tyranny may well be appre-­  
hended, on some favorable emergen-­  
cy to start up in the same quarter.  
But in a representative republic,  
whare the axecutive magistracy is  
carefully limited both in the extent  
and duration of its power, and where  
the legislative power is exercised by  
an asssmbly which is inspired by a  
  
supposed influence over the people,  
with an intrepid confidence in its  
own strength, which is sufficiently  
numerous to feel all the passions  
by means which reason prescribes.  
if is aguinst the enterprising ambition of  
this departmnet that the people onght to  
indulge all their jeatousy and exhausst al  
their precautiens.  
  
The legislative department derives  
its superiority in our Governments  
from other circumstances. Its  
conststutional powrers being af once more  
extensive and less susceptible of precise  
limats, st can with greater facilits mast  
under complicated and indirect measures  
the encroachments which it makes on the  
ee-ordenate departments. It is nof  
unfrequently a question of real nice-­  
ty in legislative bodies, whether the  
operation of a particular measure  
will not extend beyond the legisla-­  
tive sphere. On the other side, the  
executive power being restrained  
within a narrower compass, at  
being more simple in its nature, and  
the judiciary being described by  
landmarks still less uncertain, pro-  
jects of usurpation by either of these  
departments would immediately bee­  
tray and defeat themselves. Nor is  
this all. As the legislative depart-­  
ment alone has access to the pock-­  
ets of the people, and has in some  
constitutions a full discretion, and  
in all a prevailing influence over the  
pecuniary rewards of those who fill  
the other departments, a dependence  
is thus created in the latter which  
gives still greater facility to en-­  
croachments of the former.  
  
I have appealed to our own expe-­  
rience for the truth of what I ad-­  
vance on this subject. Were it nec-­  
essary to verify this experience by  
particular proofs, they might be  
multiplied, without and. I might  
collect vouchers in abundance from  
the records and archives of every  
State in the Union. But as a more  
concise and at the same time equal-­  
ly satisfactory evidence, I will refer  
to the example of two States, at-­  
tested by two unexceptionable aue­  
thorities.  
  
The first example is that of Vir­  
ginia, a State, which, as we have  
seen, has expressly declared in its  
Constitution that the three great  
departments ought not to be inter-­  
mixed. The authority in support of  
it is Mr. Jefferson who besides his  
other advantages for remarking the  
operations of the Government, was  
himself the chief magistrate of the  
State. In order to convey fully the  
ideas with which his experience had  
impressed him on this subject it will  
be necessary to quote a passage of  
some length from his very interesting  
&quot;Notes on the State of Virginia.&quot;  
(Page 195).  
&quot;All the power of government-  
legislative, executive, and judiciary,  
result to the legislative body.  
The concentration of these in the same  
hands is precisely the definition of desgotic  
government. It wall be no alleviation  
that these poucers wall be exercised by a  
plurality of hands and not byu single one.  
One hündred and sevents-three daspots  
sou ll surely be ast oppressive as one  
Let those who doubt it turn their  
eyes on the republic of Venice. As  
little will it avail us that they are  
chosen by ourselves. An elective  
despotism is not the Government we  
fought for; but one which should not  
only be founded on free principles  
but in which the powers of govern-­  
ment should be so divided and bal-­  
anced among several bodies of the  
magistracy as that no one could  
transcend their legal limits without  
being effectually checked and re-­  
strained by the others. For this  
reason that convention which passed  
the ordinance of Government laid its  
foundation on this basis, that the  
legislative, executive, and judiciary  
departments should be separate and  
distinct, so that no person should  
exercise the powers of more than  
one of them at the same time. Bat  
no barrier was provided between  
these several powers. The judiciary  
and the executive members were left  
dependent on the legislative for  
their subsistence in office, and some  
of them for continuance in it. If,  
therefore, the legislature assumes  
executive and judiciary powers, no  
opposition is likely to be made, nor  
if made can be effectual, because in  
that case they may put their pro  
ceedings into the form of an act of  
Assembly, which will render them  
obligatory on the other branches.  
They havve, accordingly, in many  
instances decided rights which  
should have been left to judiciary  
controversy, and direction of the  
executive during the whole time of  
their session is becoming habitual  
and familiar.&quot;  
  
The other State which I shall take  
for an example is Pennsylvania, and  
the other autherity the Council of  
Censors, which assembled in the  
years 1783 and 1784. A part of the  
duty of this body, as marked out by  
the Constitution, was &quot;to inquire  
whether the constitution had been  
preserved inviolate in every part,  
and whether the legislative and ex-­  
ecutivebranches of government had  
performed their duty as guardians of  
the people, or assumed to themselves  
or exercised other or greater powers  
than they are entitled to by the con-­  
stitution.&quot; In the execution of this  
trust the Counsel were necessarily  
led to a comparison of both the leg-­  
islative and executive proceedings  
with the constitutional powers of  
these departments, and from the  
facts enumerated, and to the truth  
of most of which both sides in the  
Council sul scribed, it appears that  
the constitution had been flagrantly  
violated by the Legislature in a vas­  
riety of importat instances.

XLVII. of the “ Federalist,” says, “I shall undertake to show that,  
unless these departments (meaning the Legislative, Executive, and  
Judicial) are so far blended as to give each a constitutional control  
over the others, the degree of separation which the maxim requires as  
essential to a free government cannot in practice be duly maintained.”

immortal work Mr. Madison says: &quot;In a represent­  
ative Republie, where the executive magistracy is  
carefully limited both in the extent and duration  
of its power, and where the legislative power i  
exereised by an assembly, which is inspiret by a  
suppo-ed influcnce over the people, with an in­  
trenid confidence in its own strength, which is  
sufficiently numerous to feel all the passsions which  
actuate the multitude, yet not so numerous as to  
be incapable of pursuing the objects of its pas-  
sions, by means which reason prescribes; it is  
against the enterprising ambition of this depart­  
ment that the people ought to indulge all their jeal­  
ousy and exhaust all their precautions. The legis­  
lative department derives a superiority in our Gov-  
err ment from other circumstances. Its constitu­  
tional powers being at once more extensive and  
less susceptible of precise limits, it can with the  
greater facility mask under complicated and indi­  
rect measures the encroachments which it makes on  
the other departments.  Nor is this all.  
As the legislative department alone has access to  
the pockets of the people, an t has in some constitu­  
tions full discretion and in all a prevailing influence  
over the pecuniary rewards of those who fil the  
other departments, a dependence is thus created in  
the latter which gives still greater facility to en­  
croachments of the former.

Ho thinks this is peculiarly the danger  
in a representative republic. In such a  
government, says Mr. Madison, &quot;where  
the executive magistracy is carefully  
limited, both in tho extent and duratiou  
of its power; and where tho legislative  
power is exercised by nn assembly  
which is inspired by a supposed in­  
fluence over the people, &#x27;with an  
intrepid confidence in its own  
strength; which is sufficiently nu­  
merous to feel all the passions  
which actuate a multitude, yet  
not so numerous as to be incapable of  
pursuing the objects of its passions by  
means which reason prescribes;, it is  
against the enterprising ambition of  
this department (the legislative) that  
the people ought to indulge all their  
jealousy and exhaust all their precau­  
tions.&quot; Thomas Jefferson, in his &quot;Note

islature at the expense of the other departments.’’ So, in  
the Federalist, speaking of the State constitutions, he says:  
‘‘The legislative department is everywhere extending the  
sphere of its activity and drawing all power into its impetu-  
ous vortex. . . . The founders of our republic seem  
never to have recollected the danger from legislative usurpa-  
tions, which, by assembling all power in the same hands,  
must lead to the same tyranny as is threatened by execu-  
tive usurpations.’’ And he quotes from Jefferson’s ‘‘ Notes  
on Virginia’’ the following passage relative to the same  
defects in the Virginia constitution: ‘‘ All the powers of the  
government—legislative, executive and judiciary—result to  
the same legislative body. The concentrating these in the  
same hands is precisely the definition of despotic govern-  
ment. It will be no alleviation that these powers will be  
exercised by a plurality of hands and not by a single one.’
