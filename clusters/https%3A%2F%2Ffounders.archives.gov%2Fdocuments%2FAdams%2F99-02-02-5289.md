Dear Sir  
Quincy Jany. 9. 1809  
  
The following comments were written, within a few days after the appearance in public of this  
Text  
“The Proclamation of the King of Great Britain requiring the return of his Subjects, the Seamen especially, from foreign Countries, to aid, in this hour of peculiar danger, in defence of their own. But it being an acknowledged Principle that every Nation has a right to the Service of its Subjects in time of War, that Proclamation could not furnish the slightest ground for an Embargo.”  
Commentary  
This partial Description has a tendency to deceive many, and no doubt has deceived thousands. It is concealing the Asp in a basket of Figs. The dangerous, alarming, and fatal part of the Proclamation is kept carefully out of Sight.  
Proclamations of one kind are of immemorial usage. But the present one is the first of the kind. Proclamations of the first kind issued usually in the Beginning of a War, are, in Effect, but Simple Invitations to Subjects, who happen to be abroad to return home. To deny the right of the King to issue them, would be as unreasonable, as to deny his right to Send a card of Invitation to one of his Subjects to dine with him on St. George’s day. But in neither case is the Subject bound by Law to accept the Invitation. As it is natural to every human mind to Sympathise with its native Country when in distress or danger, it is well known that considerable Numbers of British commonly return home, from various foreign Countries in consequence of these Invitations by Proclamation. The British Ambassadors, Consuls, Agents, governors, and other officers, give the Proclamations a general Circulation, Stimulate the People to return, and continue many means to encourage and facilitate their passages.  
All this is very well. All this is within the Rules of Modesty, Decency, Law and Justice. No reasonable Man will object to it. But none of these Proclamations, till this last, ever asserted a Right to take British Subjects by Force from the Ships of foreign Nations, any more than from the Cities and Provinces of foreign nations.  
On the other hand it is equally clear, that British Subjects in foreign Countries are under no indispensable obligation of Religion, Morality, Law, or Policy to return in compliance with Such Proclamations. No penalty is annexed, by English Laws to any neglect; no, nor to any direct or formal Disobedience. Hundreds, in fact, do neglect, and disobey the Proclamations to one who complies with them. Thousands, who have formed Establishments and Settled Families, or become naturalized, or made Contracts, or inlisted on board Merchant Ships, or even Ships of War in foreign Countries pay no regard to these orders or invitations of their former Sovereign. Indeed all who have become naturalized in foreign Countries, or entered into contracts of any kind public or private with Governments or Merchant or Farmers or Manufactures have no right to return, untill they have fulfilled their Covenants and obligations.  
The President of the U.S. has as legal authority to issue Similar Proclamations, and they would be as much respected by American Citizens all over the Globe. But every American would Say his Compliance was voluntary, and none, whose Engagement abroad were incompatible with compliance, would obey.  
But “It is an Acknowledged Principle that every Nation has a Right to the Service of its Subjects, in time of War.” By whom is this Principle acknowledged? By no Man, I believe in the unlimited Sense in which it is here asserted. With certain qualifications and restrictions it may be admitted. Within the Realm and in his own dominions, The King has a right to the Service of his Subjects at Sea and on land, by voluntary Inlistment, and to Send them abroad upon foreign voyages Expeditions and Enterprises; but it would be difficult to prove the Right of any Executive authority of a free People to compel free Subjects, into Service by Conscriptions or Impressment, like galley Slaves, at the point of the Bayonette, or before the mouths of field artillery. Extream cases and imperious Necessities, it is said have no Laws: but such Extremities and Necessities must be very obvious, to the whole Nation, or free Men will not comply. Impressments to Seamen, from British Merchant Men, in port or at Sea, are no better than the Conscriptions of Soldiers by Napoleon, or Louis XIV who set him the Example. So much for that part of the Proclamation which the Text produces to public View: Now for the other part which it has artfully concealed.  
The King not only commands his Subject to return, but he commands the officers of his Navy to Search the Merchant Ships of Neutrals, (meaning Americans, for it is not applicable to any others, nor intended to be applied to any others) and impress all British Seamen they find on board, without regard to any Allegations of Naturalization; without regard to any Certificates of Citizenship; without regard to any contracts, covenants or connections, they have formed with Captains or owners; and without regard to any marriages, Families or Children they may have in America. And in what Principle or Law is this founded? Is there any Law of God to Support it? Is there any Law of Nature to justify it? Is there any Law of England to authorize it? Certainly not. The Laws of England have no binding force, on board American Ships; no more than the Laws of China or Japan. The Laws of the United States alone, of which the Law of Nations is a part, have dominion over our Merchant Ships. In what Law then is it grounded? In the Law of Nations? It is a Counterfeit, foisted into that Law by this arbitrary, fraudulent Proclamation, for the first time. Such a Title as Impressment of Seamen was never found in any Code of Laws, Since the first Canoe was launched into the Sea. Not even in that of England. Whoever claims a Right must produce a Law to Support it. But this Proclamation attempts to transfer a pretended Right of impressing Seaman from their own Ships, which in truth is only an enormous abuse, to the Impressment of Seamen from foreign Nations, foreign ships, and foreign Subjects. The horror of this gross attempt; this affront to our understandings as well as Feelings; this contempt of our natural and national resentment of Injuries, as well as of our Sympathies with fellow Citizens and fellow Creatures, Suffering the vilest oppression under Inhumanity and Cruelty; could never have appeared in the World, had not the Spirits of Lord Bute and Lord George Germaine risen again at St. James’s.  
It is in vain for Britons to Say These Men are the King’s Subjects. How are they the King’s Subjects? By British Laws. And what are British Laws to us, on the high Seas? No more, than the Laws of Otaheite. We Americans must Say, they are our fellow Citizens by our Laws. They have Sworn Allegiance to the United States. We have admitted them to all the Rights and Privileges of American Citizens, and by this admission have contracted with them, to Support and defend them in the Enjoyment of all Such Rights. Our Laws acknowledge no divine Right of Kings, greater than those of Subjects, or any indefensable duty of Subjects, more than that of Kings, to obedience. These Remnants of Feudal Tyranny, and Ecclesiastical Superstition, have been long Since exploded in America. The King claims them, to make them Slaves: The President of the United States claims them, as it is his duty to do by his office and his oath, not to enslave them, but to protect them, and preserve them free. Our Laws are as good as British Laws. Our Citizens have as good a Right to protection as British Subjects, and our Government is as much bound to afford it.  
What is Impressment of Seamen? It is no better than what the Civilians call Plagiat, a Crime punishable with death by all Civilized Nations, as one of the most audacious and punishable offences against Society. It was so considered among the Hebrews. “He that Stealeth a Man, Shall surely be put to death and Selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he Shall Surely be put to death.” Exodus 31.17. “If a Man be found Stealing any of his Brethren, then that thief Shall die.” Deuteronomy 24.3. The Laws of Athens like those of the Hebrews, condemned the Plagiary or Man Stealer to death, and the Laws of Rome, pronounced the Same Judgment against the same offense outrage.  
But to descend from the Hebrews, Greeks, and Romans to the British. What is Impressment of Seamen in England, by their own Laws, in their own Ports, from their own Ships, within the four Seas, or any where on the high Seas? It is Said to be an usage—So were ship Money, Loans, and Benevolences, in the Reign of Charles the First: and arguments were used by his Courtiers, to prove their Legality, as plausible and conclusive as any that have been produced by Judge Foster in favor of Impressment. It is at best but an abuse, subsisting only by toleration and connivance, like the Practice in Holland of Kidnapping Men for Settlers or Servants in Batavia. It is in direct contradiction and violation of every Principle of English Liberty. It is a direct violation of Magna Charta, and the fifty five confirmations of it in Parliament; and a bold defiance of all the Ecclesiastical execrations against the violators of it. It is in direct violation of all their other Statutes, Bills and Petitions of Right as well as the Habeas Corpus Act. It deprives free Subjects of their Liberty, Property and often of their Lives, without alledging or pretending any accusation against them of any Crime or fault. It deprives them of the Trial by Jury and Subjects them to Scourges and death, by Martial Law, and the Judgments of Court Martial. It is a kind of civil War made upon innocent unoffending Subjects. It is said that in a general Impressment like that of Admiral Keppell it cost the Nation, in Cutters, Luggers, Press Gangs, and it might have been added in Nanny houses and Rendezvous of debauchery and Corruption , an hundred Pounds for every Man they obtained. The Practice is not avowed or acknowledged by the Nation. No Parliament ever dared to legitimate or Sanction it. No Court of Law ever dared to give a Judgment in favour of it. No Judge or Lawyer that ever I heard of, till Foster ever ventured to give a private opinion encourage it. Thurlow, when he was Chancellor, hazarded a saying to a committee of the City of London, that the Practice of Impressment of Seamen was legal. But the Committee answered him, respectfully but firmly, though in the presence of the King in Council “We acknowledge the high authority of your Lordship’s opinion, but We must declare that we are of a very different opinion.” And their answer appeared to be applauded by the Nation. Pressgangs are continually opposed and resisted at Sea, by the Sailors, whenever they have the means, or the least hope of escaping. Navy officers and Men are Sometimes killed, and there is no Inquisition for their blood. As little noise as possible is made about it. It is known to be justifiable homicide, to take the Life of an assailant, in the necessary defence of a Mans Liberty. There is not a Jury in England, who would find a Verdict of Murder or Manslaughter against any Sailor at Land or at Sea; who Should kill any one of a Press gang, in the necessary defence of his Liberty, from Impressment. Press gangs on Shore, are often resisted by the People, fired on, Some of them wounded and Sometimes killed. Yet no Inquisition is made for this. The Practice is held in abhorrence by the Men of Warsmen themselves. The Boatswain of the Rose Frigate, after the Acquittal of the four Irish Sailors who were prosecuted in a Special Court of Admiralty at Boston for killing a gallant and amiable Officer, Lieutenant Panton, said  “This is a kind of Work, in which I have been almost constantly engaged, for twenty years, i.e. in fighting with honest Sailors to deprive them of their Liberty. I always suspected that I ought to be hanged for it: but now I know it.”  
Since I have alluded to this case it may not be amiss to recollect some other Circumstance of it. A Press Gang from the Rose, commanded by Lieutenant Panton, with a Midshipman and a number of ordinary Seamen, visited and Searched a Merchant Ship from Marblehead belonging to Mr Hooper, at Sea. The Lieutenant enquired, if any English, Irish, or Scotchmen were on board. Not satisfied with the answer he received, he proceeded to Search the Ship from Stem to Stern. At last he found four Irishmen retired and concealed in the Forepeake. With Swords and Pistols he immediately laid Seige to the Inclosure, and summoned the Men to Surrender. Corbett, who had the cool Intrepidity of a Nelson, reasoned, remonstrated and laid down the Law with the Precision of a Mansfield. “I know who you are. You are the Lieutenant of a Man of War, come with a Press gang to deprive me of my Liberty. You have no right to impress me. I have retreated from you, as far as I can. I can go no further. I and my Companions are determined to Stand upon our defence. Stand off.” The Sailors within and without employed their usual Language to each other, and the Midshipman in confusion fired a Pistol into the Forepeake and broke an arm of one of the four. Corbett who Stood at the Entrance was engaged in a Contest of Menaces and defiances with the Lieutenant. He repeated what he had before Said, and marking a Line with a Harpoon in the Salt with which the Ship was loaded, said “you are determined to deprive me of my Liberty, and I am determined to defend it. If you Step over that Line, I Shall consider it a proof that you are determined to impress me, and by the eternal God of Heaven you are dead Man,” “Aye! My Lad,” said the Lieutenant, “I have seen many a brave Fellow before now.” Taking his Snuff Box out of his Pocket and taking a Pinch of Snuff he very deliberately stepped over the Line and attempted to Seize Corbett. The latter drawing back his arm, and driving his Harpoon with all his Force cut off the Carotied Artery and jugular vein and laid the Lieutenant dead at his feet. The Rose Sent a Reinforcement to the Press gang, broke down the Bulkhead, Seized the four Irishmen and brought them to Tryal for Piracy and Murder. The Court consisted of Governor Bernard, Governor Wentworth, Chief Justice Hutchinson, Judge Auchmuty, Commodore Hood himself who then commanded all the Ships of War on the Station, now a Peer of the British Empire, and twelve or fifteen other Counsellors of Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Rhode Island. After the Trial, the President Governor Bernard, pronounced the Judgment of the Court, that the action of the Prisoners was Justifiable Homicide, &amp; in this opinion the whole Court was unanimous. The sailor who was wounded in the arm brought an action against the Midshipman, and Commodore Hood himself interposed and made Compensation to the Sailor to his Satisfaction, after which the action was withdrawn.  
Such was the Impressment of Seamen, as it stood by Law before our Revolution. The Author of my Text, then carries his Courtly Complaisance to the English Government, further than the Governors Barnard and Hutchinson and even than Lord Hood carried it, when We were a Part of the British Empire. He thinks that as every Nation has a Right to the Service of its Subjects, in time of War, the Proclamation of the King of Great Britain, commanding his Naval Officers to practice Such Impressments, on board, not the Vessells of his own Subjects, but of the United States, a foreign Nation could not furnish the Slightest ground for an Embargo! It is not necessary for me to say, that any thing could furnish a Sufficient ground for an Embargo for any long time; this I leave to the Responsibility of our President, Senators and Representatives in Congress. But I Say with Confidence that it furnished a Sufficient ground for a Declaration of War. Not the Murder of Pierce nor all the Murders on board the Chesapeake, nor all the other Injuries and Insults We have received from foreign Nations, atrocious as they have been, can be of such dangerous, lasting, and pernicious Consequence to this Country, as this Proclamation, if We have Servility enough to Submit to it.  
What would the Author of my Text have advised? Would he counsel the President to Stipulate, in a Treaty with Great Britain that his Navy officers should forever hereafter have a Right to visit and Search all American Merchant Ships, and impress from them all English, Scotch and Irish Seamen? Will he be so good as to explain the Distinction between Ships of War and Merchant Ships? Are not Merchant Ships under the Jurisdiction and entitled to the Protection of the Laws of their Country, upon the high Seas, as much as Ships of War? Is not a Merchant Ship as much the Territory of the United States, as a Ship of War? Would the Author of my Text advise the President and Congress to acquiesce in Silence, under this Proclamation, and permit it to be executed forever hereafter? Would not such a tame and Silent acquiescence, as effectually yield the Point, and establish the Practice, if not the Law, as an express Stipulation in a Solemn Treaty? If the United States had as powerful a Navy as Great Britain, &amp; Great Britain as feeble a force at Sea as ours, would he advise the President, either to concede the Principle by Treaty, or acquiesce in it in Silence? Does the Circumstance of great Power or great Weakness make any Alteration in the Principle or the Right? Should the Captain and Crew of an American Merchantman, resist a British Press Gang on the high Seas, and in defence of their Liberty, kill the Commander and all under him, and then make their escape, and after returning to Salem be prosecuted, would the Writer of my Text, as a Judge or a Juror give his Judgment for finding them guilty of Murder or Piracy?  
Although the Embargo was made the Watchword in our late Elections the votes in our greatest Nurseries of Seamen, for Example in Salem, in Marblehead, in Barnstable, Sandwich and other Places on Cape Cod, in Nantucket and the Vineyard, and other places, Seemed to Shew, that our Seamen preferred to be embargoed rather than go to Sea to be impressed.  
No doubt it will be Said that We have nothing to do with the question in England concerning the Legality or Illegality of Impressments. This, as long as they confine the Law and the Practice to their own Territory, to their own Ships and their own Seamen, is readily acknowledged. We Shall leave them, to justify their own usage, whether it is a mere abuse or a legitimate Custom, to their own Consciences, to their own Sense of Equity Humanity or Policy. But when they arrogate a Right, and presume in fact, to transfer this usurpation to foreign Nations, or rather to Americans, whom they presume to distinguish from all other foreign Nations, it becomes the Interest, the Right, and the dispensable duty of our government to enquire into the nature nefarious Nature of it in England, in order to expose the greater Turpitude of it when transferred to us; as well as to oppose and resist it to the Utmost of their Power, and it is equally the Duty of the People to support their government in Such opposition to the last Extremity.  
Permit us now to enquire what will be the Effects of an established Law and practice of British Impressments of Seamen from American Ships, upon the Commerce, the Navigation and the Peace of the United States, and above all upon the hearts and Minds of our Seamen.  
In considering those innumerable dangers from Winds and Seas, Rocks and Shoals, to which all Ships are exposed in their Voyages, the owner and Master must Sit down together, and in order to determine the number of Seamen necessary for their voyage, they must calculate the Chances of Impressment, and engage a Supernumerary List of Sailors, that they may be able to Spare as many as the British Lieutenant Shall please to take, and have enough left to Secure the Safety of the Ship and Cargo, and above all the Lives of the Master and Crew. They know not how many British Ships of War they may meet, nor how many Sailors, the Conscience of each Lieutenant may allow him to impress. For the Lieutenant is to be Judge, Jury, Sheriff and Gaoler to every Seaman in American Vessels. He is to try many important Questions of Law and of Fact. Whether the Sailor is a Native of America; Whether he has been lawfully naturalized in America. Whether he is an Englishman Scotchman or Irishman; Whether he emigrated to America before the Revolution or Since. Indeed, no Evidence is to be admitted of any Naturalization by our Laws, in any of the States Since the Revolution, if before. In Truth the Doctrine of the inherent and indefeasible Duty of Allegiance is asserted so peremptorily in the Proclamation, that the Lieutenant may think it his duty to impress every Man who was born in the British Dominions. It may be the opinion of this learned Judge, that the Connection between the King and Subject is So Sacred and divine, that Allegiance cannot be dissolved by any Treaty the King has made or even by any Act of Parliament. And this pious sentiment may Subject us all to Impressment at once. This however, en passant.  
The Lieutenant is to order, the Captain of the Merchantman to lay before him a List of his Crew. He is then to command the Crew to be ordered or summoned or mustered, to pass in review before him. A Tribunal ought to be erected. The Lieutenant is to be the Judge, possessed of greater Authority than the Chief Justice of any of our States, or even than the Chief Justice of the United States. The Midshipman is to be Clerk, and the Boatswain, Sheriff or Marshal. And who are these Lieutenants? Commonly very young Gentlemen, the younger Sons of wealthy Families, who have procured their Commissions to give them an honourable Living, instead of putting them apprentices to Trade, Merchandize, Law, Physic or Divinity. Their Education, their Experience, their manners, their Principles are so well known, that I Shall Say nothing of them. Lord Keppell Said that he knew the Maxim of British Seamen to be “To do no right, and receive no Wrong.” The Principles of the officers I believe to be somewhat better. But in this they all Seem to agree; Officers and Men and their present Ministry seem to be of the Same opinion, that the world was made for the British Nation and that all Nature and Nations were created for the Dignity and omnipotence of the British Navy.  
It is impossible to figure to ourselves in Imagination, this Solemn Tribunal and this venerable Judge, without Smiling: till the humiliation of our Country comes into our thought, and interrupts the Sense of Ridicule by the Tears of grief or Vengeance.  
High on a Splendid Seat, which far outshone  
Henleys gilt Tub, or Flecnoe’s Irish Throne  
The Lieutenant examines the Countenance, the gate and air of every Seaman. Like the Sage of old, commands him to Speak, that he may know him. He pronounces his accent and Dialect to be that of the Scotch, Irish, West Country, Yorkshire, Welsh Jersey Guernsey Alderny or Lark. Many Native Americans are the descendants of Emigrants from all these Countries and retain a tincture of the Language and Pronunciation of their Fathers and Grandfathers. These will be decided to be The Kings Subjects. Many will be found to be Emigrants or Descendants of Emigrants from Germany, Holland, Sweden, France, Spain, Portugal or Italy. These will be adjudged by the Lieutenant not to be Native Americans. They will be thought to have no Friends in America who will care enough for them to make much Noise, and these will be impressed. If there Should be any Natives or Sons of Natives of any of the West India Islands, or of any part of the East Indias, where the King is Said to have thirty millions of Subjects, these must all be impressed, for Conquest confers the indelible Character of Subjects as well as Birth. But if neither English, Scotch, Irish, Welsh, Italian, German, Dutchman, Spaniard, Portuguese, East or West Indiaman is found, the Reverend Lieutenant will think, if he is prudent enough not to Say, “Jura negat sibi nata, nihil non arrogat armis. Our Ship is so weakly manned, that We cannot fight an Enemy; We cannot even navigate her in Safety in bad Weather. Procul a Jove, procul a fulmine—I will take as many Native Americans as I please. It will be long before I can be called to account. And at last I can Say that I Saved the King’s Ship, and perhaps beat a Frenchman, by the aid of this meritorious Impressment, and I am sure of Friends who will not only bring me off, but obtain promotion for me, even for this patriotic action.”  
How many American Ships and Cargoes will be Sunk in the sea or driven on shore and wrecked, and lost: How many Masters and remaining Sailors will be buried in the ocean, for want of the assistance of the Men thus kidnapped and Stolen, no human foresight can calculate. It is however easy to predict that the Number must be very great. These Considerations it Seems have no Weight, in the Estimation of the British Ministry. Their Hearts are not taught to feel another’s Woe.  
But all these Things the Captain and the owner of an American Merchant Ship must take into Consideration, and make the Subjects of calculation, before they can venture to Sea. In Short there Should be a Corporation erected in every State for the express Purpose of insuring against Impressment of Seamen. In a course of time and Experience the Chances might be calculated, So that the Insurers and Insured, might at a great expense be Secure. But the poor Sailors can never be Safe.  
The Law must be Settled or remain unsettled. If Such Impressments are determined to be legal either by Treaty or by acquiescence in the King’s Proclamation, it will establish in the Minds of British Seamen a Pride of Superiority and a Spirit of domination, and in the Minds of American Seamen a consciousness of Inferiority and a Servile Spirit of Submission that Ages will not eradicate. If the Question is allowed to remain undetermined, American Seamen will fight in defence of their Liberty, whenever they See the Smallest prospect of escaping, and Sometimes when their is none. They will kill and be killed. Some will be punished for their resistance on board the British Man of War, and Some may be carried to Some British Port and there prosecuted for Piracy and Murder. This however, will Seldom, if ever, be done; for I still believe there is Sense and Justice enough in the British Nation and their Juries, to acquit any Seaman, American or British, who should kill a Press gang in defence of his Liberty. But if he Should escape and return to America, and, be here prosecuted, I will not believe there is a Judge or a Juror on the Continent, so ignorant of the Law, so dead to every Sense of Justice, so abandoned by every feeling of Humanity, as to find him guilty of any Crime, if it were proved that he had killed a dozen Press Gangs in defence of his Freedom. We Shall have a continual Warfare at Sea, like that lately at Canton, our Secretary of State’s office will be filled with Representations and Complaints. Our Nation will be held in a constant State of Irritation and Fermentation, and our government always distressed between their anxiety to relieve their Fellow Citizens and their Inability to Serve them.  
A Republican who asserts the Duty of Jealousy, ought to Suspect that this Proclamation was dictated by a Spirit as hostile and malicious as it was insidious; for the determined purpose of depressing the Character of our Seamen. Take from a Sailor his Pride and his Courage and he becomes a poor Animal indeed; broken hearted dejected, depressed even below the Standard of other Men of his own level in Society. A habit of Fear will be established in his Mind. At the Sight of a British Man of War, A Panick will Seize him, his Spirits will Sink, and if it be only a Cutter or a Lugger, he will think of nothing but flight and Escape. What but the haughty Spirit of their Seamen, which has been encouraged and Supported for Ages by the Nation has given the British Navy its Superiority over the Navies of other Nations? “Who Shall dare to Set bounds to the Commerce and Naval Power of Great Britain,” is the magnificent Language of Defiance in Parliament and it vibrates and echoes through every heart in the Nation. Every British Sailor is made to believe himself the Master and Commander of the World. If the Right of Impressment is conceded by us in Theory or Practice our Seamen’s hearts will be broken; and every British Seaman will Say to every American Seaman as the Six Nations of Indians Said to the Southern Tribes whom they had conquered “We have put Petticoats on you.”  
In such a case many would have too much reason to Say—Let us no longer rejoice for Independence or think of a Navy or free Commerce, no longer hope for any rank in the World; but bow our Necks again to the yoke of Great Britain.  
If the Spirit of a Man should remain in our Sailors, they will Sometimes resist. Should a british Cutter demand to Search an American Merchant Ship of five hundred Tons burthen, armed as they Sometimes are, and have a right to be. The Commander of the Cutter calls for a muster of the Men, in order to impress Such as he in his Wisdom Shall judge to be British Subjects. Is it credible that the Captain and Crew of the Merchantman will Submit to Such usage? No He will Sink the Boat and the Cutter too, rather than be so insulted, and every American must applaud him for his Spirit.  
Is this Right of Impressment, to be all on one Side, or is it to be reciprocal? British Modesty may say “it is an exclusive Priviledge, which We claim, assert, and will maintain, because it is necessary to Support our Dominion of the Seas, which is necessary to preserve a balance of Power in Europe against France and to prevent the French Emperour from Sending Fifty thousand Men to conquer the United States of America. All this will not convince American Seamen. They will answer, We think a ballance of Power on the Ocean as necessary as on the Continent of Europe. We thank you for your civility in kindly giving us hopes that you will defend us from the French Army of fifty thousand Men. But We are very willing to take our defence upon ourselves. If you have a Right to impress Seamen from our Ships, we have an equal Right to impress from yours. Should one of our gun boats meet a British East Indiaman, armed with fifty guns; the gunboat demands a Search for American Seamen: calls for the Muster Roll: commands the Men to pass in review before him; Would the East India Captain Submit? No, he would Sooner throw overboard the Press gang and run down the Gun boat.—Such will be the perpetual altercations between Britons and Americans at Sea, and lay an immoveable foundation of eternal hatred between the two Nations. The King’s Proclamation will be found as impolitic a Step as ever the Court of St. James’s has taken.  
It is said in the Context “The British Ships of War, agreeably to a Right Claimed and exercised for ages; a Right claimed and exercised during the whole of the Administrations of Washington, of Adams, and of Jefferson, continue to take Some of the British Seamen found on board our Merchant Vessels, and with them a small Number of ours, from the Impossibility of always distinguishing Englishmen from the Citizens of the United States.”  
We have before Seen what Sort of a Right to impress Men from their own Ships has been claimed, in what manner it has been exercised, and in what light it has been considered by the English Nation. It amounts to Right of getting their officers lawfully killed. But Surely no Right was ever before claimed, to impress Men from foreign Ships. If such a pretended Right was ever exercised, or in other Words if such a Crime was ever committed, I presume it would be no better proof of a legal Right, than a Robbery, Burglary or Murder committed on Shore would prove that Such Actions are innocent and lawful. To argue from Single Facts or a few Instances, to a general Law is a Sophistry too common with political Writers and is Sometimes imputable to Compilers of the Law of Nations. But none of them ever went to Such extravagance as this. No Claim or Pretension of any Right to Search foreign Vessels for Seamen, ever existed before our Revolution, and no Exercise of Such a Right ever prevailed Since, except Such as resemble the Exercises of the Right of committing Robbery, Burglary and Murder in Some of our Cities. No Ages have passed Since our Revolution. The Right was never asserted or claimed, till the late Proclamation of the King appeared: and that Proclamation, will make an epoch of disgrace and disaster to one Nation or the other, perhaps to both. From the Peace of 1783 to the Commencement of our government under the present National Constitution, whenever any American Seamen were impressed they were immediately demanded in the Name of the Old Congress, and immediately discharged without ever pretending to Such Right of Impressment. During the Administration of Washington, whenever Information was received of any Impressments immediate orders were Sent to demand the Men, and the Men were promised to be liberated. Washington Sent Captain Talbot to the West Indias as an Agent to demand Seamen impressed on board British Men of War. Talbot demanded them of the British Commanders, Captains, and Admirals and was refused. He went then on Shore, and demanded and obtained of the Chief Justice of the Island, Writs of Habeas Corpus, by Virtue of which the impressed Seamen were brought from the Kings Ships and Set at Liberty by Law, the Commander not daring to disobey the King’s Writ. During the Administration of Adams, the Secretary of States office can Shew what demands were made and the Success of them. The Remonstrances that were made in Consequence of positive Instructions and the Memorials presented at Court by our Minister were conceived in Terms as Strong as the English Language could furnish, without violating that respect and decorum which ought always to be preserved between Nations and governments even in Declarations of War. The Practice was asserted to be, not only incompatible with every Principle of Justice and every Feeling of Humanity, but wholly irreconcilable with all thoughts of a Continuance of Peace and Friendship between the two Nations. The Effect of the Memorial was an immediate Order to the Commander of the Navy, to liberate the demanded Men. I shall Say nothing of Mr Jefferson’s Administration, because the Negotiations already made public Sufficiently Show, that he has not been behind either of his Predecessors in his Zeal for the Liberty of American Seamen. During all this time Excuses and Apologies were made and Necessity was Sometimes hinted; but no Serious Pretension of Right was advanced. No; the first formal Claim was the King’s Proclamation. With what Propriety then can this be called a Right claimed and exercised for Ages, and during the whole of the Administrations of Washington, of Adams, and of Jefferson.  
Is there any Reason why another Proclamation Should not Soon appear commanding all the officers of the Army in Canada &amp; Nova Scotia to go over the Line and take by Force all the King’s Subjects they can find in our Villages. The Right would Stand upon the Same Principles: but there is this difference it would not be executed with so little danger.  
I have the honor to be with Sentiments of Esteem and respect

This p.;; riplion&#x27; has a ten­  
dency to deceive many, and no doubt  
iias deceived thousands. It is conceal­  
ing the as/iin a basket of figs. The  
dangerous, alarming and fatal part ofj  
the proclamation is kept carefully out ;  
of sigh*. Proclamations of one kind I  
are of im rft&#x27;etnorial usage ; but the | re- |  
sent one is the first of the kind. \
Proclamations of the first kind, issued J  
usually in the beginning of a war, are j  
in effeel but simple invitations to sub- j  
jeCts, who hrappen to be abroad, to re- |  
turn home. To deny the right of the  
king to issue them, would be as un  
reasonable as to deny his right to  
send a card of invitation lo one of his  
subjects to dine with him on St.  
George&#x27;s day. Bui in neither case is  
me subjeel bound by law to accept the  
in virion. A&lt;n is natural to every i;u  
manmind to syrnp r.n* with its native  
country when in distress or danger, it is  
well known that considerable numbers  
of Btiiisn commonly return home  
various foreign countries, in  
jquence of these invitations by l  
proclamation. The British amb  
dors, consuls, agents, governors and  
give the proclamations a j  
ral circulation, stimulate the peo- ,  
pie to return, and contrive 1  
; and facilitate &quot;heir :  
All mis is very well ; a 11.1  
this&#x27;is within the rules 61 modesty, j  
.:■•)&#x27;, law and justice ; no readotia­  
ble man will object to it. But none  
bese proclamations, ti&#x27;i this last, j  
ever asserted a 1 ight •  
subjectsbj force, from the ships of.  
foreign nations, any 1 tore than from ;  
the cities and provinces of foreign  
nations. On the OlheT hand, it is j  
illy clear, that British subjects in j  
; foreign countries ar,. under no indis- I  
i pensabie obli ;atiun ol religion1, morali- j  
j ty, law or policy, Lo ret urn in com- |  
piiance with such proclamations. No  
1 annexed by English laws to j  
1 any neglect ; no, nor to any direct or j  
I formal disobedience. Hundreds in  
i fact, ( ■ and disobey the pro­  
iS to one who compiles with  
riiousunds who have formed  
j estttbiishmei ts,and settled hmiilies, or  
j be.ee |i?ed, or nude contracts,  
or enlisted on board merchant ships,  
or even ships ofwar&#x27;-ih foreign coun­  
tries, pay no regard to these oiders  
ormvitauons r»l niersovereign.  
l&lt; de. d, all who have become naturaliz­  
ed in lo reign countries, or entered into  
contracts of any kind, public or pri­  
vate, with governments or merchants,  
or farmers or manufactures, have 1,0  
right to return until they have fulfill­  
ed their covenants and obligations.  
—Tho President of the United  
States has as legal authority to  
i_3ue similar proclamations, and they  
would tee as much respected by Arao­  
rican citizens, all over the globe. But  
every American would say his com  
i.c was voluntary, and none, whose  
igements abroad were, incompati­  
ble, would obey. But &quot;it is an a_«  
Knowlfedged principle, that every  
nation has a right to the service of its  
übjects in time of war.&quot; By whom  
, this principle acknowledged l By no  
man, I beh .vc, 10 tne unlimited sense  
which it is here asserted. With  
iin qualifications and restrictions it  
.ay be&#x27;admitted. Within the realm  
nd his own dominions the king lias a  
:i.,hi to the service of his subj  
at sea and on land, by voluntary c .-  
iistmeiits, and to scud them ab  
on for .go voyage &gt;, expeou.iol aoi  
enterprises-&quot;* but it would be difficult  
  
j to prove the right of any executive i  
authority ol&#x27; a free people to com­  
ic subjects into, service by con-  
I script ion s or impressments, like gal­  
i ley-staves, at tlv point of the bay  
!or before the months of field artiHe- -  
ry. Extreme rases and imperiou  
cessity, it is sdd, have no lavy ; bul j  
such extremities&#x27; and necessity must  
be very obvious to the whole nation,  
or free in en will not comply. Im­  
pressments, of seamen from British  
merchantmen in port or at sea, are no  
better than the conscriptions of sol­  
diers by Napoleon or Lewis XIV.  
who set him the example, So much  
for that pari of th p oclamation, which  
the text ; reduce to public view. Now j  
for the other part, which it has artfully  
( oocealed.  
The king not only commands his  
subjects lo return, hut he commands  
the officers of his navy to search the  
hants ships of neutrals, (meaning  
ric..ns, for it is not applicable to  
an) others, nor intended to be applied  
to any others,) and impress all Bri  
tish seamen they find en b  
without any regard to any alio  
li of naturalization ; without a  
ny regard to any certificates of citi­  
hip ; without regard to any con­  
, covenants or connections they  
formed with captains or owners ;  
hbut regard to any marriages, fa­  
,es or children they have in A-  
Ai d m what principle or  
law is this founded? Is there any  
law ol God to support it ? Is there  
any law of nature to justify it? Is there  
any law of England to authorise it I  
Certainly not. The laws of England ■  
no binding force on board Ame­  
! rtcan ships, more than the laws of  
China or Japan. The laws of the U­  
nited States alone, of which the law  
of nations is a part, have dominion  
e-vt r our merchant ships. In what law  
hit grounded ? In the law of na~  
&#x27; tions ? It is a counter fcitfoisted into  
\ law, by this arbitrary, fra.&#x27;ulent pro­  
| clamation, for the first time. Such  
! a title, as Impressment of Seamen,  
was never found in any code of laws,  
! since the first canoe was launch­  
to the sea; not even that of  
England. Whoever claims right  
must produce a law lo support it.—  
But this proclamation attempt;; to  
transfer a pretended right of impres­  
sing seamen from their own ships,  
which in truth is only an enormous  
abuse, to the impressment of sea­  
from foreign nations, foreign ships  
foreign subjects. The hon­  
o: ot this gross attempt, this affront  
to our understandings as well as feel­  
ings ; this contempt of our natural  
. and national resentment of injuries,  
I as well as our sympathies with fellow­  
! citizens and fellow creatures, sul­  
j fering the vilest oppression under iv­  
: humanity and cruelty, could never  
I hafe appeared in the world, had not  
liie spirits of Lord Bute aud Lard  
1 George Germaine risen again at Si.  
! j, incs&#x27;s.  
It is in vain for the BriAons to say,  
&#x27; these men are the King&#x27;s subjects.  
How are they the king&#x27;s subjects ! By  
Briiish laws. And what aie British  
i laws to us, on the high seas i No  
more than the laws oi Otaheite. We  
Ame leans must say they are our lei­  
j low citizens by our laws. 1 hey have

1 i have admitted ttiem lo all the rights  
! and privileges ol American citizens,  
| anu by this admission have contracted  
i witn uicin to support anu detenu them  
;in the enjoyment oi all such rights.  
&#x27; , Our laws acknowledge no divine right  
&#x27;dot kings, greater than those of sub*  
i jects, or any indefeasible duty of in­  
jects moic man that ot kings, to obe- J  
diei.ee. These remnants ol feudal

1 nave as good a rigiit to protection as i

is the impressment of seamen i It is

direct viol,.tion of Magna Churta and  
the fifty-five confirmations of it in Par­  
liament, and a bold defiance of all the j  
ecclesiastical execrations against the i

of all their other statutes, bills and;

them of any crime or fault. It dc- j  
prives them of the trial by jury r.nd

might have been added, in Nanny

1 Ual jiitt of the proclamation, iskr.pt care- |  
fully outof siglit. Proclan, utions of one kind  
are of immemorial usage ; but the present,  
one is the first of the kind. Proclamations !  
of the first kind, issued usually iii the begii»- i  
ning of a war, are in effect but simple invi  
tations to subjects, who happen to lie abroad, i  
to return home. Tod ny the right of racking !  
to i-.sue them, would be as unreasonable as I  
to deny his right to send a card of invitation  
to one of his subjects to dine with him on St. i  
George’s Day. But in neither case is the  
subject bound by law to accept the invitation. :  
As it natural Co every human mind to svm- j  
pathize with its native con&#x27;try when in dis-■  
tress or danger, it is well known that consi­  
lerablftnimbers ot British commonly return  
home from vurions foreign countries, in con­  
sequence of these invitationshy proclamation.  
Idle British ambassadors, consuls, agents,  
governors, and other officers give the procla­  
mations h g&lt; neral circulation, stimulate the  
people to return, and contrive many means J  
  
to encourage and tacditrite their p&gt;ssnges—  
All tliis is very well; all this is within the  
rules of modesty, deccncv. law and j ustice ;  
no reasonable mauVill object to it. lint none  
of these proclamations, till this last, ever  
asserted a t ight to take British subjects, by  
inree, from thu ships of foreign nations, any  
more than from the cities and provinces ol  
foreign nations. On the other hand, it is e­  
qually cl ar, that British subjects in foreign  
countries are under no iiulispensihle r-bliga  
ti .n of religion, morality, law or policy,* to  
return in compliance with such proclaimati  
ons. No penalty is annexed by English laws  
to anv neglect; no, nor to any direct or for­  
mal dis bedience. Hundreds in fact, do neg­  
lect and disobey the proclamations, to one  
who complies with them. Thousands who  
have formed establishments and fettled fa  
milies, or become naturalised, or made con­  
trrmtSj or enlisted on board merchant ships  
or even ships of war in foreign countries, pay  
no regard to these orders or invitations of  
their former sovereign. Indeed, all who  
li &#x27;.ve become naturalized in foreign countries,  
or entered into contracts of any kind, public  
or private, with governments, or merchants,  
or farmers, or rr» inufacturers have no light  
to return, until they have fulfilled theircove­  
nnni s and obligations. The President of the  
lr. States has as legal authority to issue simi­  
lar proclamations. and they would he as much  
respected bv American citizens, ad over the  
globe. But every American would sav, his  
compliance was voluntary, and none, « hose  
•engagements abroad were incompatible,

considered among the Helfrew.s. “lie that  
Rte detti a man and sellet * him, or if lie bn

death. ” laxodusSl. 17. “ If a man be found  
sterling any «: his brethren, then that thief  
shall die.” Deuteroivpmy 24. 7. The laws  
of .Athens, like those r.t the Hebrews, con­  
demned the plagiary or man-: tealer to death ;  
and the laws ot Rome pronounced the sarr.v  
judgment against the same outrage. But to  
descend from the Hebrev s. Greeks and Ro­

Judge I 1 sier, in favor of impressment. t­

leration and connivance, like the practice  
in Holland of kidnofi/ring men for settler ;  
or servants in Batavia. It is in diiect con­  
tradiction and violation of every principle  
of English liberty. It is a direct violation of  
Miigiia Chsi ta and tlie fifty-five c.oHfiimati­

that opinion will be found iu the fol­  
lowing commentaries, which .we re writ­  
ten lor private amusement, within a  
few days after the appearance in pub­  
lic oi this  
TEXT.  
“ The proclamation of the king of I  
Great Britain, requiring the return of  
his subjects, the teamen especially,  
from foreign countries, to aid in this &#x27;  
hour of peculiar danger, in defence of |  
  
wieir own  
“ But it being an acknowledged ;  
prinuiple that every nation lias aright  
to the service ol its subjects in time of |  
war, that proclamation could not fur­  
nish the slightest ground tor an em­  
bargo.”  
This partial description has a ten­  
dency to deceive many, and no doubt  
has deceived thousands. It is con­  
cealing an asp in a basket of ligs.  
The dangerous, alarming and fatal  
part of the proclamation is kept care­  
fully out of sight. Proclamations oi  
one kind are of immemorial usage;  
but the present one is the first of th«  
kind. Proclamations of the first kind,  
issued usually in the beginning of 4  
war, are in cflect but simple invitati­  
ons to suhjecs, who happen to be a­  
hroad, to return home. To deny the  
right of the king to issue them, would  
be as unreasonable as to deny his  
right to send a card of invitation to  
one ol his subjects to dine with him  
on St. George’* day. But in neither  
case is the subject hound by law to  
accept the invitation. As it is natu­  
ral to every human mind to sympathize  
with its native country when in dis­  
tress or danger, it is well known that  
considerable numbers f&gt;f British com­  
monly Vctumed home from Various fo­  
teign countries, in consequence of  
these invitation* by’ proclamation.—  
The British ambassadors, consuls, a­  
gents, governors and other officers give  
the proclamations a general circulati­  
on, stimulate the people to return,and  
contrive many means to encourage and  
facilitate their passages. All this is  
1  
  
very \i-ii; all this is within the rules  
ot modesty, decency, law and justice ;  
no reasonable man wi l object to it.  
rtut none proclamations, till  
this I .st, ever asserted a right to take  
british subjects by force, from the  
ships uf loreignnations, auv moie than  
irom the cities and provinces of lo.  
rrign nations. . On the.other hand, it  
is equally clear, that British subjects  
in toreign countries are undcr noin-l  
dispensibU obligation of roligjoo, mo­  
bility, law or policy, 10 return :n com­  
pliance with such prod tmaiions. tio  
penalty is annexed by English lav/&gt; to  
any dir. ct or lorm.l disobedience.  
Hundreds in fact, do. neglect mid dis­  
obey the proclamations to one who  
complies with them. i&#x27;housands who  
have lor.ned establishments, and set­  
tled families, or become naturalized,  
or made contracts, or enlisted on board  
merchant ships, or even ships of war  
in foreign countries, pay no regard to

nation has a right to the service of its  
subjects in time of war,” By whom  
is this principle acknowledged ? By  
no man, I believe, in the unlimitted  
sense in which it is here asserted.  
vViih certain qualifications and re­  
strictions ii way he admitted. With­  
in the realm and his own dominions  
rhe king has a ri^ht io the service of  
his subjects, at sea and on land, bv  
voluntary enlistments, anti to send \
them abroad on foreign voyages, ex- !  
peditions and elite pi izes ; nut ii would |  
be difficult to prove ihe right of any j  
executive authority ol a free people io &#x27;  
compel free subjects into service by j  
conscriptions or impressments, like i  
galley slaves, at the point of the bavu­  
net, or before the mouths of field ar­  
tillery. Extreme cases and imperious  
necessity, it is said, have no law : but  
such extremities and necessity must I  
be very obvious to the whole nation,  
or freemen will not comply. Impress­  
ments, of seamen from British mt-r.  
chantmen import or at sea, are no bet­  
ter than the conscriptions of soldiers  
by Napoleon or Lewis XIV. who set  
him the example. So much for that  
part of the proclamation, which the  
text produces to public view. Now  
for the other part, which it has artfully  
concealed.  
The king not only command* his sub.  
jrCla to return, but lie commands the ofti­  
ceis of his nuvy to search the merchant  
ships of neutrals, (meaning Americans,  
fen it is not applicable to any others, nor  
intended to be applied to any inkers,} t*  
impn&amp;iall British seamen they find on

any Gw of God to support u f 1* iheic p.

as Impressment of Seamen, was never

canoe Was launched into the sea ; not e_

But this pioclamation mumps &lt;o turns,  
fer a pretended right of impressing sea­

is only an enormous abuse, loth* impress­

TnunLow, when he was Chancel- ;  
lor, hazarded a saying to a committee !  
of the city of London, that the prac- &#x27;■  
tice of impressment of seamen ;  
was legal ; but the committee answer &#x27;  
ed him respectfully, but firmly, tho&#x27;j  
in the presence of the king in coun­  
cil—&quot; We acknowledge the high au- I  
thority of your Lordship&#x27;s opinion, but  
we must declare that we are of a very  
different opinion ;&quot; 8c their answer ap­  
peared to be applauded by the nation.  
Press-gangs are continually opposed  
and resisted at sea, by the sailors,  
whenever they have the means or die  
• least hope of escaping. Navy officers  
&#x27; and men are sometimes killed, and J  
: there is no inquisition for their blood, j  
Aa little noise as possible is made a­  
bout it. It is known to be justifi  
ble homicide to take the life of an as­  
sailant in the necessary defence of a j  
man&#x27;s liberty. There is not a jury In  
Imd who would find a verdict !  
of murder or manslaughter against a-*I  
ny sailor, on* land or at sea, wiio  
should kill any one of a press-gang  
in the necessary defence of his I  
iy from impressment. Press-gangs  
&#x27;on shote are often resisted by the peo­  
ple, fired on, some of them wound­  
ed, sometimes killed. Yet no inquF  
• sition is made for this, the prac­  
tice is held in abhorrence by the men  
of war&#x27;s men themselves. The boat  
swain of the Hove frigate, alter the

their liberty; I have dway  
ed that I ought to U hang .1 for , h«4

to recollect some other circumstances  
ofit.

seamen, visited and searched a met*  
chant ship from Marblehead, belong­  
ing to Mr. Hooper, at sea. The  
tenant enquired if any English, rrihh  
or Scotchmen were on board ? Not  
satisfied with the answer he received,  
he prepared to search the ship from  
stem to stern. At last he found  
Irishmen retired and coi tithe  
fore peak.—With sv.o ds and pistoto  
he immediately laid siege to the enclo­  
sure and summoned the men to sur­  
render. Corbet t, wo had the cool  
pidity of a Nelson, reasoned, re­  
monstrated, and laid down the law  
with the precision of a M.i  
&quot; I know who you are. You are the  
lieutenant ol a man of war, come  
with a press-gang to deprive me of my  
liberty. You have no right to un­  
press me. I have retreated from you  
ias far as I can ; I can go no farther.  
j I and my companions are determined  
to stand upon our defence —Stand

\ employed their usual language to each  
jj other, and a midshipman, inthecon­  
&#x27;, fusion, fired a pistol into the forej  
and broke an arm of one of the four.  
Corbett, who stood at the entrain---,,  
was engaged in a contest of menaces  
and defiances with the lieutei. ant..  
He repeated what he had before said,  
and marking a line with a harpoon in  
the sal:, with which the  
loaded, said—&quot; You are determined

Heaven, you are a dead man.&quot; &quot; Aye,  
my lad,&quot; said the lieutenant, &quot; I lave  
many a brave feiiov before now.&quot;  
Taking his snuff box out of his pocket,  
! and taking a pinch of snuff, he very  
[ deliberately stepped over the iine and  
\ attempted to seize Corbq t. The I &gt;t­

lof his freedom. We shall have a con- j  
s ! Untidl warfare, at sea, like that lately, I

depressing the character of our sea-  
Takfl frpm the sailor his pride

poor animal indeed. Broken-hearted,  
dejected, depressed even below the  
i standard of o&#x27;her men of his own  
j level in society, a habit ofjfrar will be  
Wished in his mind. At the sight  
British man of war a ftanie will

if it be only a cutter or a lugger, he  
will think of nothing but flight andes­  
  
cape. VV hat but the haughty i [  
their seamen, which has been c:  
raged and supported for ages bj  
nation, has given the British navy its  
superiority over the natives of other  
nations ? v Who shall dare to set  
bounds to the commerce and naval  
power of Great Britain I&quot; Is the  
magnificent language of defiance in  
Parliament, and it vibrates and echoes  
through every heart in the nation.—-  
Every British sailor is made to be­  
lieve himself the master and comman­  
der of the world. If the&#x27; right of im­  
j pressment is conceded by us, in theo­  
ry or practice, our seamen&#x27;s i:  
will be broken, and every British sea­  
men will say to every American sea­  
men as the Six nations of Indian  
to the Southern tribes, when they  
had conquered. &quot; IVe have f  
/tctticoats on you.&quot; In such a.  
many would have too much reason to  
say, let us no longer rejoice for in*,  
dependence, or think of a navy oi  
commerce, no longer hope for  
tank in the world, but bow  
! necks again to the yoke of Great Bri­  
j tain.  
If the spirit of a man should re­  
main in our sailors, they will ■;■  
times resist. Should a Briti  
demand to sea&#x27;ch American mer­  
; chant ships, of live hundred tons bur­  
then, armed as they sometimes are  
j and have aright to.be**—The comman­  
-1 derof the cutter calls for a muster of  
• the men, in order to impress such as  
he, in his wisdom, shall judge to brt  
British subjects. Is it credible that the  
captain and crew of the merchantman  
. will submit to such usage ? No, he  
will sink the boat and cutter too, ra­  
ther than be so insulted, and every  
American must applaud, him for his  
spirit.  
Is this right of impressment to be  
all on one side, or i.s it to be reoipro­  
; cal ? British modesty may say ; &quot;It  
lis an exclusive privilege, which we  
j claim, assert and .will maintain, be­  
j cause it is necessary to Support our  
j dominion of the s  
sary to preserve a balance of pi  
in Europe, again pel to  
. prevent the French Emperor from  
sending&#x27;fifty thousand nu nquer  
the United States of America.&quot; Alt  
this will not convince American sea­  
men. They will answer ; &quot;We think  
a balance of power on the oceai  
necessary as on the continent ol  
lope. VW thank yon for your civility  
in kindly giving us hopes, tha&#x27; you will  
defend us from the French army of  
fifty thousand men ; but we are very  
i willing to take our defence upon oi  
selves. If yen have a right to  
press seanfen bom our ship  
have an equal right to impress from  
yours &quot;  
■ Should one of our gun boats meet a  
. British East Incliaman, armed wii  
guns. The gun boat demands a--  
for American seamen ; calls for the  
muster roll, commands the men to  
. in review before him ; would the  
F.-si India captain submit? No. He  
would sooner throw over board the  
press gang, and run down the gut&#x27;-  
brat. Such will be the perpetu  
tercation V  
ricanf, at se &gt;, and !iy an immovable  
foundation of  
the two nations. The king&#x27;s pi  
mation will be found as impolitic  
as ever the court of St. James&#x27; has  
taken.  
It is said, in the context, &quot;The Bri­  
tish ships of war, agreeably to a right,  
claimed and exercised for ages-a right,  
claimed and exercised during tho  
whole of the administrations of Wash­  
ington and Adams, and of Jefferson.  
continue to take some of the British  
nen, found on board our merchant  
vessels, and with them a small num­  
ber of ours, from the impossibilty of  
always distinguishing Englishmen  
from ihe citizens of the U. Slates.&quot;  
We have before seen what sort of a  
right to impress men from their own  
ships has bech claimed, in what man­  
ner it has been oxCrcised, and. in whin:  
light it has been considered by the  
English nation, ft am&#x27; UftlS m a  
of getting their officers lawfully killed.  
But surely, no right was ever before  
claimed to impress seamen from lo­  
j reign ships. If such a pretended  
right was ever exercised, or, ih other  
words, if such a crime was ever com­  
mitted, I presume it would be no bet­  
ter proof of a legal right, Hum a ;  
ry, burglary, or murder, Cortina  
on shore, would prove that such »&#x27;  
are innocent and lawful. To a

From the peace of 1783 to the com­

Congress, and immediately dis­  
charged, without ever pretending  
such right pf impressment.  
During the administration of Washing­

orders were sent lo demand the men,

J hurlow, when he was chancellor, ha­  
zarded a saying to a committee of the city  
ot London, that the practice of impressment  
of seamen was legal : hut the committee an­  
swered him respectfully, Imt firmly, though  
jij thci presence of the king in council—“ we  
acknowledge the high authority of your lord­  
ship’s opinion, but we must declare that we  
are.of a very different opinion;” &amp; their an­  
swer appeared to be applauded by the nation.  
Pres* gangs are continually opposed &amp; resist -1  
edatsea, by the sailors, whenever they have  
the means&#x27;or the least hope of escaping. Nav y  
officers &amp; men are sometimes killed, &amp; there  
is no inquisition for their blood. As little anise  
as possible is made about it. It is known to be  
justifiable homicide, to take the life of an  
assailant in the necessary defence of a man’s  
liberty. There is not a jury in England who  
’would find a verdict of murder or manslaugh­  
ter against any sailor, on land, or at sea,  
who should kill any one of a press cang in the  
necessary defence of Ids liberty from impress­  
ment.—Press gangs on shore are often resis­  
ted l&gt;\ ttie people, fired tin, some of them  
wounded, sometimes killed. Vet no inqui­  
sition is made for this. The practice is held  
in abhoi i t nee by the men of war’s men them­  
selves. I he boatswain of the Hour /riffan,  
after the acquittal of the four lii.-lt sailors  
who were prosecuted in a special court of ad­  
miralty at Bostce. for killing a gallant and  
amiable officer, lieut. Panton, said, &quot;this is !  
a kind of work in which I have been almost j  
constantly rnguged for twenty years, i. e. in j  
fighting with honest sailors, to deprive them  
of their liberty; I alwavs suspected that I  
might to be hanged for it.” Bince I have al­  
luded to this case, it may not be amiss to re­  
collect some othi r circumstances of it.  
A press gang from the Hose, commanded  
by lieut. Pan ton, &#x27;with a midshipman and a  
nun.bi r of ordinary seamen, visited and  
searched a mt-i chant ship from Marblehead,  
belonging to Mr. Hooper, at sea. The lieut&#x27;  
enquired if any English, Irish orBcotchmen  
were on (ward? Not satisfied with the mi  
i.wer he received, he prepared to search the  
ship from run to stern. At last he found  
four Irishmen retiicd and concealed hi the  
» i  
  
fore-peak. With sword and pistols he im- ,  
mediately laid siege to the enclosure £i sum­  
moned the men to surrender. Corbett, who  
had the&#x27;cool intrepidity of a Nelson, reasoned,  
remonstrated and laid down the law with the  
precision of a Mansfield. *• I know whoyou  
arc. You are the lieutenant of a man of war,  
come with a press-gang to deprive me of my  
liberty. You have no right to impress me.  
I have retreated from you as far as I can ; I  
can go no farther. I, and my companions are  
determined to stand upon our defence. Stand  
off.” The sailors within and without em­  
ployed their usual language to each other,  
and a midshipman, in the confusion, fired a  
pistol into the fore-peak and broke an arm of  
one of the four. Corbett, who stood at the  
entrance, was engaged in a contest of mena­  
ces and defiances with the lieutenant. !!s  
repeated what he had before said, und mark­  
ing a line with a harpoon in the salt, with  
which the ship was loaded, said, “ You are  
determined to deprive me of my liberty, and  
I am determined to defend it. If you step  
over that line, I shall consider it as a proof  
that you are determined to impress me, and  
by the eternal Cod of Heaven, you are a  
dead man.” “ Aye my lad,” said the lieut.  
“ I have seen many a brave fellow before  
now.” Taking his snuff box out of his pock­  
et, and taking a pinch of snuff, he very deli­  
berately stepped over the line and attempted  
to seize Corbett. The latter, drawing back  
bis arm, and driving his harpoon with all  
his force, cut off the carotid artery and jugu­  
lar vein, and laid the lieutenant dead at his  
feet. TheRosK sent a reinforcement tothe  
press-gang—broke down the bulkhead, and  
seized the four Irishmen, and brought thfem  
to trial for piracy and murder. The court  
consisted ot Governor Bernard, Governor  
V\ entworth. Chief Justice Hutchinson, Judge  
Achniuty, Commodore Hood himself, who  
then commanded all the ships of war on the  
station, now a pe&amp;r of the British empire,  
and twelve or fifteen others, councillors of  
Massachusetts, New-Hampshire, Sc Rhode­  
Island. After the irial, the President, Go­  
vernor Bernard, pronounced the judgment  
ot the Court, that the action ot the prison­  
  
tl. ,vas justifiable homicide, and in this!  
opinion the whole court was unanimous._  
I Ue sailor who was wounded in the arm,  
brought an action against the midshipman  
and commodore Hood himself interposed &amp;  
made compensation to the sailor, to his satis­  
faction, after which the action was with­  
drawn. Such was the impressment of sea­  
men, as it stood, by law, before our revoluti­  
on—The author of my text, then, carries his  
courtly complaisance to the English govern­  
ment, farther than the governors Bernard  
and Hutchinson, and even than lord Hood  
carried it, when we were a part of the Bri­  
tish empire. He thinks, that, as every nati­  
on has a right to the service of iu subjects in  
time of war, the proclamation of the King of  
G. B. commanding his naval officers to prac­  
tice such impressments on board, not only  
the vessels ®f his own subjects but of the U.  
States, a foreign nation, could not furnish the  
slightest ground for an embargo&#x27; It is not  
nec essary for me tosay, that any thing could  
furnish a sufficient ground for an embargo,  
for any hong time ; this, I leave to the respon­  
sibility of our president, senators, and repre­  
sentatives in congress. Hut, ! sav withcun­  
fidence, that it furnished a sufficient ground  
for a declaration of tear. Not the murder  
of Pierce, nor all the murders, on board the  
Chesapeake, nor all the other injuries and  
insults, we have received from foreign na  
lions, atrocious as they have been, can be  
lot such dangerous, lasting and pernicious  
consequence to this country,as this proclama­  
tion, it we have servility enough to submit  
to it.  
What would the author of my text* have  
advised? Would he counsel the President to  
stipulate, in a treaty with Great Britain,  
that his navy officers should forever liereaf  
ter have a right to visit American merchant  
ships, ami impress from them all English,.  
Scotch and Iiisli seamen? Will hu beso  
good as to explain the distinction between  
ships? Are notmerchant ships under the  
jurisdiction and entitled to the protection of  
the* laws of their country upon the high seas,  
as much as ships of war? Is not a merchant  
ship as much the territory of the United  
States, as a ship of war ? &#x27; Would the au­  
thor of my text advise the President and  
Congress to acquiesce, in silence, under this  
Proclamation, and permit it to be executed  
forever hereafter? Would not such a tame  
and silent acquiescence, as effectually yield  
the point, and establish the practice, if not  
the law, as an express stipulation in&#x27;a so­  
lemn treaty ? If the United States had as  
powerful a navy as Great Britain, and Great  
Britain as feeble a force at sea, as ours, w ould  
lie advise the President, either to concede  
the principle, by treaty, or acquiesce in it,  
in silence ? Does the ciicumstance of great  
power or great weakness make any altera­  
tion in the principle or the right? Should  
the Captain or crew of an American mer­  
chantman, resist a British press-gang on the  
high seas, and in defiance of their liberty,  
kill the commander.and all under him, and  
then make their escape, and after returning  
to Salem, be prosecuted, would the writer  
of my text, as a judge or a juror, give his  
judgment lor finding them guilty of murder  
or piracy ? Although the embai go was made  
the watchword, in our late elections, the  
votes, m our greatest nurseries of seamen,  
lor example, in Salem, in Marblehead, in  
Barnstable, Sandwich, and other places on  
Cape Cod, in Nantucket and the Vineyard,  
and other pluces, seemed to shew, that our  
seamen preferred to be embargoed, rather  
than go tosea to be im/ireeacd.  
  
iso doubt, it will be said, that we have no­  
thing to do with the question in England,  
concerning the legality ov illegality of im­  
pressments. I his, as long as they confine  
the law and the practice to their own coun­  
try, and to their own seamen, is readily ac­  
knowledged. We shall leave them to justify  
their own usage, whether it is a mere abuse,  
ora legitimate custom, to their own consci­  
ences, to their own sense of equity, humani­  
ty or policy. But when thev ar rogate a right,  
and presume, in fact, to transfer their usur­  
pations to foreign nations, or rather to Ame­  
ricans, whom they presume to distinguish  
h orn all other foreign nations, it becomes the  
interest, the right, and the indispensable duty  
of our government, to inquire into the nefa­  
rious nature of it in England, in«&gt;rder to ex­  
pose the greater turpitude of it, when trans­  
ten ed *o us, as well as to oppose and resist  
it to the utmost of their power, and u is e­  
quully the duty of the people to support their  
government in such opposition to the last ex­  
tremity.  
Permit me now to enquire, what will be  
the effects of an established law and practice  
oi British impressments of seamen, from  
American ships, upon the commerce, the  
navigation and the peace of the United States,  
• The worthy Timothy Pickering  
  
above all, upon the^arts ancl minds  
if our seamen. &#x27;  
In considering those innumerable dangers,  
fr om winds and seas, rocks and slioals. to  
♦liich all ships are exposed in their voyages,  
the owner and muster must sit down together  
in order to estimate the number of seamen  
necessary for the voyage. They must cal­  
culate the chances of impressment, and en­  
gage a supernumerary list of sailors, that  
they may be able to spare as many as the i  
British lieutenant shall please to take, and i  
have enough left to secure the safety of the j  
ship and cargo, and above all. the lives of |  
the master and crew. They know not how  
many British ships of xvav they may meet,  
nor how many sailors the conscience of each 1  
lieutenant may allow him tn impress. For  
M)lioiltiiii&#x27;int So U» ?•*&gt;}.*..• -I. - A* » I  
- w *&gt;v, jin V % aiici in iinu j  
jailor, to every seaman in American vessels.  
He is to try many importan; questions of law I  
and of fact. Whether the sailor is a native  
of America; whether he bis been lawfully  
naturalized in America. Whet her he is an  
Englishman, Scotchman or Irishman ; whe­  
ther emigrated to America before the revo­  
lution or since i Indeed mj evidence is to be  
admitted of any naturalization by our laws,  
in any of the sttites, since the revolution, if  
before. In truth, the doc.rine of the inhe- !  
rent aHd indefeasible duty of allegiance 13 i  
asserted, so peremptorily,in the proclama- j  
tion, that the lieutenant nay think it his j  
duty to impress every man who was born in &gt;  
the British dominions. It nay be the opini- I  
on of this learned judge, hat the connecti- I  
on between the king and subject, is so s tend ;  
and divine, that allegiance cannot be dissoh - &#x27;  
ed by any treaty the k*ig has made, or even j  
by an act of parliament. j4nd this pious  
sentiment may subjict us all to impressment  
at once. This, hovever,en passant.  
The lieutenant :s to order the captain of  
the met chancman to lay before him a list of  
his crew ; he is then.to command the crew  
to be ordered or summoned or mastered to  
pass in review before him. A tribunal ought  
to be erected. &#x27;1 he lieutenant is to be the  
judge, possessed of greater authority than  
the chief justice of any of our states, or even  
than the chief justice of the U.dttd States  
The midshipman is to be clerk, 8c the boats­  
wain, sheriff or marshal. And who are these  
lieutenants ? Commonly very young gentle­  
men, the younger sons of wealthy families,  
who have procured their commissions to give  
them an honorable living, instead of putting  
their, apprentices to trade,merchandize, law,  
physic, or divinity. Their educate n, their  
expetienee, their manners, their principles  
are so well known, that I shall say nothing  
of them. Lord Keppel said, that he knew  
the maxim of British seamen to be, “ to do no  
right and receive no wrong.” The prin­  
ciples of the officers, I believe to be some­  
what better ; but, in this, they all seer,. i„  
agree,officers and men, and their present  
ministry seem to be « » the same opinion,  
that the worid was made for theBvitisli nation  
and that all nature and nations were created  
for the dignity aud omnipotence of the Bri­  
tish navy.  
  
it is impossible to figure to ciiir selves, iu  
imagination, this solemn tribunal and vene­  
rable judge, without smiling, till the humi­  
liation of out.country comes into our thoughts  
and interrupts the sense of l iuicuie, by the  
tears of grief or vengeance.  
“ High on a splendid seat, which far out­  
shone  
“ Henley’s guilt tub, or Flecnoe’s Irish  
throne.”  
The lieu tenant examines the countenance,  
the gaite and air of every seaman. Like the  
sage of old, commands Ivm to speak, “that  
he may know him.” He pronounces his ac­  
cent and dialect to be that of the Scotch,  
Irish, West Country, Yorkshire, Welsh, Jer­  
sey, Guernsey, Alderney, or Serk. Many  
native Americans are tht descendants of em­  
igrants from all these comtries, and retain a  
tincture of the laiiguagt and pronunciation  
of their fathers and grandfathers. These  
will be decided to lie tie king’s subjects_  
Many will be found to b; emigrants, or the  
descendants of emigrarts, from Germany,  
Holland, Sweden, Frame, Spain, Portugal  
or Italy. They will lu adjudged by the  
lieutenant not to be native Americans

inthe Tolfowing Commentaries, which were  
written for private amusement, within a few  
days after the appearance in public of this  
TR o, ;  
~ “The proclamation of the King of Great Byi-  
Pain, requiring the return of bis subjects, the feanien  
especially, from foreign countries,to aid in this bour  
of peculiar danger, in defence of their orwn.”’  
“ But it being an acknowlidged principle, that  
every nation bas a right to the ferviza of its fub­  
jells in time of war, that proclamation could not  
Jurnifo, the flightefl ground for an embargo.” *  
This partial description has a ten­  
dency to deceive many, and no doubt  
has deceived thousands.. J# is conceal-  
Jing the asp in a basket of figs. ‘The dan.  
‘gerous, alarming and fatal part of the  
proclamation is kept carefully out of  
fight. Proclamations of pne kind are’  
of immemorial uiage ; but the ‘pre­  
fent one is the firlt of thekind. Pro­  
clamations of the firt kind, issued  
usually in the beginning of a war, are  
in effe&amp; but simple invitations to fub­  
je&amp;ts, who happen t¢ be abroad, to re­  
turn home. To deny the right of the  
king to issue them, would be as nn­  
reafonable as to deny his right to fend  
a card of invitation to one ‘of his fub­  
je€ts to dine with him on St. George’s  
day. &quot; But in neither case is the sub.  
ject bound by law to accept the invi­  
tation. . Asit is natural to every hn.  
man mind to sympathize with ity na­  
tive country when in diftrels or dan­  
ger, it is well known that considerable  
numbers of British commenly return  
home from various foreign cougptries,  
inconfrquence of thele rvitavins by  
proclamation. &quot;The Britith ambassa­  
dors, consuls, &quot;¥gents, governors and  
other officers give the proclamations  
a general . circulation, flimulate the  
people to return, and contrive many  
me2ns to enconirage and facilitfle  
their paflages. All this is very well;  
all this is within the rules of modeity,  
decency, law and jultice ; o reason­  
able man will obj=&amp; to it. DBut none  
of these proclamations, till this last,  
ever asserted a right to tske Dritifh  
fubjedls, by force, from: the ships of  
foreign nations, any more tijan from  
the cities and provinces of forcign na­  
tions. On the other hand, it is equal­  
ly clear, that British fubj-&amp;s is foreign  
countries are under no indispensable  
obligation of relipion, worality, law  
or policy, to return in contpliance  
with {uch proclamations. _No penalty  
is annexed by Engiifh&#x27;laws to any ne­  
glect ; no, nor to any dire&amp; or for­  
mal disobedience. Hundreds, in fad&amp;,  
do negle&amp; and disobey the proclama­  
tions to one who complics with them.  
Thousands who have formed eftablith­  
ments and fettled families, or become  
naturalized, or made contraéts, or  
enlisted on board merchant ships, or  
even ships of war in foreigr countries,  
pay ®» regard to these orders&#x27;or invi.

ized in foreigh countries, or engered  
into contra&amp;s of any kind, public or  
private, with governments or mer­  
chants, or farmers or manufa&amp;urers,  
have no right 1o return until they  
have fulfilled their covenants and ob­  
ligations:. The President of the Unit.  
ed States has as legal authority tail  
sue similar proclamations, and fhey

before the mouths of ficld attillery.—  
Extreme cases and imperious neceflity,  
it is said, have no law; but such ex­  
tremities and neceflity must be very  
obvious to the whole nation, or {ree­  
roen will not comply. Impreflments,  
of feamean from Buitifh merchantmen­  
in port or at sea, are no better than  
the conferiptions of {oldiers by Napo­  
leon or Lewis XIV. who set him the  
example. So much for that part of  
the proclamarion, which rhe text pro­  
duces to public&#x27;view. Now for the  
other part, which it has artfully con.  
cealed.  
The King riot only commands his  
futj=&amp;s to return, but he commands  
the officers of his navy to search the  
meerchant (hips of neutrals, (meaning  
Americans, for it is not applicable to  
any others, nor intended to be applied  
to any others,) and impress all Britith  
seamen they find on board, without  
any regard to any allegations of nat­  
uralization ; without any régard to  
any certificates of citizenship ; with­  
out regard to any contraéls, covenants  
or conneétions they have formed with  
captains or owners ; and without re­  
gard to any marriages, families or  
children they may have in America.  
And in what Principle or law is this  
founded ? Is there any law of Godto  
support it ? Ts there any law of nature -  
to jaftify it ? Is there any law of Eng. -  
land to authorife it ? Certainly not.  
The laws of England have no binding  
force on board American ships, more  
than the laws of China or Japan.—  
The laws of the United States alone,  
of which the law of nations is a part,  
have dominion over our merchant  
ships. In what law then is it ground.-  
¢d ! In the law of nations ? It is a  
counterfeit foifted into that law, by  
ibis arbitrary, fraudulent proclama­  
tion, for the firl time. Sueh a title,  
as {mpreffment of Seamen, was never  
found in any eod: ofJews, fince.she-  
Arlt canoe was launched into the sea ;  
not even in that of England. Who­  
ever claims a right mult produce a  
law to support it. DBut this procla­  
mation attempts to transfer a pretend.-  
ed vight of imprefling seamen from  
their own ships, which in truth is only  
an enormous abase, to the imprefl­  
ment of seamen from foreign nations,  
foreign thips apd foreign fubjelts.—  
T&#x27;he hotror of this gross attempt, this  
affront to our underflandings as well  
as feelings ; this contempt of our nat­  
ural and national resentment of inju­  
rizs; as well as of our sympathies with  
fellow-citizens and fellow-cteatures,  
{uffering the vilest oppreflion under  
inhumanity and cruelty, conld never  
have appeared in the world, had not  
the spirits of Lord Bate and l.ord  
George Germaine risen again at St.  
James’s, &#x27; &#x27;  
Itis in vain for the Britons to fay,  
these men are the King’s fubjeéts.—  
How are they the King’s fubjeds ? |  
By Britith laws. And what are Bri:  
tith laws 1o us, on the high seas ! Xo  
more than the laws of Otaheite, .~ We  
Aumericans must fay they areour fel- -  
low-citiz¢ns by our laws. T‘bey&#x27;have  
sworn allegiance to the Utiited States.  
We have admitted thém to al! the  
rights anc_lg;,gdﬁl%&amp;sl of American  
citizens, and by this admiflion have  
contrasted withithem to support and  
defend them Anthe enjoyment of all  
such righss. = Our laws acknowledge  
no divine right of Kings, greater than  
those of - fubjedls, or any indefeafable  
dity of fubjedts more than that of  
kings, to obedience, These remnants  
of feudal tyranny and ecclesiastical -  
superstition, have been long since ex­  
,-vp%g:led in America. The King  
claims them to make them slaves.—

prove their legzlity, as plausible and  
conclusive as any that have been pro­  
duced by Judge Foster, in favor of  
. impressment. It is at beR but an a.  
~ bufe, subsisting only by toleration and  
- cennivance, like the pradice in Hol­  
&#x27; land of kidnapping men for settlers, or  
{fervants in Batavia. Itisin _dire&amp;  
- contriddi&amp;ion and violation of every  
- principle of English liberty. It is a  
- dire&amp;t violation of Magna Charta and  
the fifty five confirmations of it in  
Parliament, and a bold defiance of all  
the ecclefiallécal execrations against  
the violators of it. It is in dire@ vis  
olation of all their other Ratutes, bills:  
and petitions of right; as well as the .  
Habeas Corpus ad. -It deprives free  
fubje@s of their liberty, property, and  
often of their lives, without alledging  
or pretending any accusation against  
them of any crime or fanlt. It de­  
prives them of _the trial by jury and  
subjects them to g:ourges and death,  
by martial law and the judgment of  
courts martial. It is ‘a kind of civil  
war, made upon innocent and unofs  
fending fubje@s: =lt is said thatin a.  
general impreflment, like that of Ad.  
miral Keppell, it cost the nation, in  
cutters, luggers, press gangs, and it  
might have been added, in Nanny=  
houles and tendezvous of debauchery  
and corruption, as hundred pounds  
for every marn they obtained. The  
-praficeis not gvowed of acknowledg­  
ed by the nation. No Parliament  
ever dared to legitimate or fan@ion it.  
-No court of law ever dared to give &amp;  
judgment in favorof it. No judge or  
lawyer that ever I heard of, till F&amp;er,  
ever ventured to.give a private opin­  
ion to encourage it. :  
Trurrow, when he was Chancels  
lor, hazarded a faying to a committe  
of the city of London, that the ptac­  
tice of impressment of seamen was le­  
gal ; but the committee answered him  
refpectfully, but firmly, though in the  
presence of tse King in Council—  
“ We acknowlédge the high authority  
of your Lordship’s opinion, but we  
muflt declare th4t we are of a very  
different opinign 3 and their answer  
appeared ta: belapplauded by the na­

from ﬁsm to stern. At last he found  
four Irithmen retired and concealed  
in the forepeak.—With swords and&#x27;  
pistols he -immediately laid siege 1o  
the enclosure and fummonéd the men  
to surrender. Corbett, who had the  
cool intrepidity of a Nelson, reasoned,  
remon{irated and laid Hown the law  
with the precision of 2 Mansfield.—  
I know who you are..- You arve the  
Licutenant-of a man of war, come  
with a press-gang to deprive the of my  
kberty. You have no right to impress  
me. I have retreated from you as far  
as I can; [ cangonofarther. Jand  
my companians are - determined to  
stand upon our defence. Stand off.”  
The sailors within and without em­  
ployed their usual language to each  
other, and a Midthipman, in the con­  
fufion, fired a piftdl into the forepeak  
and broke an arm of one of the four.  
Corbett, wko food at. the entrance,  
was engaged in a conteß of menaces  
and defiances with the Lieutenant.—  
He reprated what he had before said,  
and marking a line with a barpoon in  
the salt, with which the ship was load­  
ed, said, * You are determined to de­  
rive me of my liberty, and 1 am de­  
g.-rminfd ‘to defend it. *4f you fep  
over that line, 1 (hall confider 1t as&#x27;a  
proof that you are. determined to im­  
press me, and by the cternal God of Hea­  
wen, you are a dead man.” ¢ Aye,  
my lad,” said the Licutenant, * I have  
{een many a brave fellow, before now.”  
Taking hisfouff-box out of his pocket,  
and taking a pinch of f{nuff, he very  
deliberately &amp;epped over the lige and  
attempted to seize Corbett. The lat.  
ter, drawing back bis arm, and driv­  
ing his harpoon with all his force, cut  
off the carotid artery and jugular vein,  
and laid the Lient. dead at %is feet.—  
The Rose sent a reinforc®ment to the  
prefs.gang ; broke down the bulk­  
head, and seized the four Irishmen,  
and brought them to tiial for piracy  
and murder. The Court consisted of  
Governor Bernard, Governor Went­  
worth, Chief Juffice Hdtchinfon,  
Judge Achmuty, Commodote Hood  
him{elf, who then commanded all the  
ships of war on the station, now a peer  
of the Britith Empire, and twelve or  
fifteen others, counfellors of Maffa­  
\ chufetts, New-Hampthire and Rhode.  
Hland. After the trial, the Piefident,  
Governor Bernard, pronounced the  
judgment of the Conrt, that the a&amp;ion  
of the prisoners was juftifiabie homi.  
cide, and in this opinion the whele  
Court was unanimous. The sailor  
who was wounded in the arm, kxeught  
an a&amp;ion against the Midshipman,  
and Commodore Hood himfelf inter­  
posed and made compentation to the  
fuilor, to his fatisfa&amp;tion, after which  
the a&amp;ion was withdrawn.—Such was  
the impressment of seamen, as it stood,  
by law, betore our revolution. The  
author of my text, then; carries his  
courtly complaisance to the Englith  
government, farther than the Gover­  
nors Bernard and Hutchinson, and  
even than Lord Hood carried it, when  
we were @ part of the Britith empire.  
He thinks, that, as every nation has  
a right to the service of its fubjedts, in  
time of war, the proclamation of the  
King of Great Britain, commanding  
his naval officers to pradtife such im­  
- preflments, om board, -not the veflels  
of his own fubjeés, but, of the United  
States, a foreign nation, could not fur­

bargo ! It is not neceflary for me to  
fay, that any thing could furnith 2 fuf.  
ficient ground for an embargo, for  
any long time ; this, I leave to the  
responsibility of our President, Sena­  
~ tors and Representatives in Congress.  
But, I fay, with confidence, that it  
furnithed a fefficient ground for # dec­  
laration of war. Not the murder of  
Peirce, nor all the murders, on board  
the Chesapeake, nor all the other inju­  
ries and insults, we igve received from  
foreign nations, attracious as they  
have been, can be of such dangerous,

the President, either to coneede the  
principle, by treaty, or acquieie init,  
io fileice ? Does the circumstance of  
great power or great weakness make  
any alteration in the principle or the  
right ? Should the Capt. or crew of an  
American merchantman, refit a Bri­  
tish press-gang on the high seas, and  
in defence of their liberty, kill the  
commander, and all under him; and  
then make their escape, and after re­  
turning to Salem, be prosecuted,  
would the writer of my text, as a  
judge or a juror, give his judgment  
for finding them guilty of murder. or  
piracy ? Although the Embargo was  
made the watchword, in our late elec­  
tions, the votes, in our greatelt nur­  
series of seamen, for example, in Sa­  
lem, in Marblehead, in Barnftable,  
Sandwich and other places on Cape  
Cod, in Nantucket and the Vineyard  
and other places, seemed to thew, that  
our seamen preferred 2o be embargoed,  
rather than go to sea to be impressed.  
No doubt, it will be said, that we  
have nothing to do with the question  
in England, concerning the legality  
or illegality of impreflments. This,  
as long as they confine the law and  
the pratice to their own country, to  
their own thips, and their own sea­  
men, is readily acknowledged. We  
shall leave them to jultify their own  
usage, whether it is a mere abuse, or  
a legitimate custom, to their own con­  
iciences, to their own sense of equity,  
humanity or policy. But when they  
arrogate a right, and presume in fa&amp;  
to transfer their usurpation to foreign  
nations, or rather to Americans,  
whom they presume to distinguish  
from all other foreign nations, it be­  
comes the interest, the right, and the  
indispensable duty of our Government  
to enquire into the nefarious nature  
of it in England, in order to expose  
the greater turpitude of it when trans:  
ferred to us, as well as to oppose and  
resist it to the utmost of their power,  
and it is equally the duty of the peo­  
ple to support their government in  
such opposition-to the lalt extremity.  
- Permit me now to enquire, what  
will be the effes of an established  
law and pratice of Britith imprefl­  
ments of seamen, from American  
ships, upon the commerce, the navi­  
gation and the peace of the United  
States, and, above all, upon the hearts  
and minds of our seamen.  
In considering those innumerable  
dangers, from winds and seas, rocks  
and shoals, to which all thips are ex­  
posed, in their voyages, the owner and  
master must fit down together, in or­  
der to determine the number of sea­  
men neceflary for the yoyage. They  
must calculate the chances of impress.  
ment, and engage a supernumerary  
lift of sailors, that they may be able  
to spare as many, as the British lieu.  
tenant shall please to take, and have  
enough left, to secure the fafety of  
the ship and cargo ; and, above all,  
the lives of the master and crew.—  
They know not how many Britith  
ships of war they may meet, nor how  
many failors&#x27; the conscience of each  
lieutenant may allow him to impress.  
‘For the lieutenant is to be judge, ju­  
ty, fheriff and goaler, to every sea­  
man in American veflels. He isto  
try many important questions of law  
and of fat. Whether the sailor is a  
native of America ; whether hehas  
been lawfully naturalized in A merica.  
Whether he is an Englithman, Scotch­  
man or Irilhman. Whether he emigra­  
ted to America before the revolution,  
or {ince 2 Indeed, o evidence is to be  
admitted of any mnaturalization by our  
Adarws, in any of the slates, since the revo­  
fution, if before. In truth, the do@rine  
of the inherent and indefeafible dury  
of allegiance is asserted, so perempto­  
rily, in the proclamation, that the  
lieutenant may think it his duty to  
.impress every man, who was born in  
the Bricith dominions. It may be the  
opinion of this learned judge, that the  
.conne&amp;ion between the king and sub.  
je&amp; is so sacred and divine, that alle­  
treaty the king has made, or even by  
any a&amp; of parliament. And this pious  
[entiment may [ubjec? us allto W’M  
at once.~This, however, en paffant.  
The lieutenant is to .order the cap­  
tain of the merchantiman to lay before  
him a lift of his crew ; he is then to  
command the crew to be ordered or  
summoned, or multered to pass in re­  
view before him. A tribunal onght  
to be erefted. The lieutenant is to  
be the judge, pofieffed of greater an­  
thority thaa the Chief Jdftice of any  
of our States, or even than the Chief  
Jußice of the United States. The  
midshipman is to be clerk, and the  
boatswain fheriff or marshal. And

—The principles of the officers, I be­  
lieve to be somewhat better ; bat in  
this, they all seem to agree, officers  
and men, and their present miniltry  
seem to be of the {ame opihion, that  
the world was made for the Britith  
nation and that all nature and nations  
were created for the dignity and om­  
nipotence of the Britith navy,  
It is impossible to figure to our­  
selves, in imagination, this solemn tri­  
bunal and v%g}_’abie judge, without  
smiling, till the humiliation of our  
country comes into our thoughts and  
interrypts the sense of ridicule by the

&#x27; They will be thought to have no friends in  
v\merica, who will care enough for them to  
make much noise, and these will be impres­  
sed. If there should be any natives or sons­  
of natives of any .of the West India Islands,  
or any part of the East Indies, where the  
king is said to have thirty millions of subjects,  
these must all be impressed, for conquest  
confers the indelible character of subjects,  
as well as birth. But if neither English,  
Scotch, Irish, Welsh, Italian, German,  
Dutchman, Spaniard. Portuguese, East or  
West India-man, is found, the reverend  
Lieutenant will think, if he is prudent e­  
nough not to say, “Jura negat sibi lata, ni­  
hil non arrogat armis.” “Our ship is so  
weakly manned, that we cannot fight an e­  
nemy ; we cannot even navigate her in safety,  
in bad weather; Procul a Jove, procula ful­  
mine. I will take as many native Americana  
as I please. It will be long before I can be  
called to account; and at last, I car say that  
I saved the King’s ship, and perhaps beat a  
Frenchman by the aid of this meritorious im­  
pressment, and I am sure of friends, who will  
not only bring me off, but obtain a promoti­  
on for me, even for this patriotic action.”-—  
How many A mut.Ico~ , u :--&gt;  
.. .vmi Jinpa anil tai gDCS Will  
be sunk in the sea, or driven on shore, wreck­  
ed and lost; how many masters and remain­  
ing sailors will be buried in the ocean for  
want of the assistance of the men thus kid- .  
napped and stolen, no human foresight can  
calculate. It is, however, easy to predict,  
that the number must he very great._These  
considerations, it seems, have no weight in  
tlie estimation of the British Ministry.  
1 heir hearts are not taught to feel another’s  
woe. But all these things the captain and  
owner of an American merchant-ship must  
take into consideration, and make the sub­  
jects of calculation before they can venture  
to sea. In short, there should be a corpora­  
tion erected in every State for the express  
purpose of insuring against impressment of  
seamen. In a course of time and experience  
the chances might be calculated, so that the  
I insurers 8c insured, might at a great expence  
be secure. But the poor sailors can never be  
safe.  
1 he law must be settled, or remain unset­  
tled. If such impressments are determined  
to be legal, either by treaty, or by acqtiiesc­  
ence in the king’s Proclamation, it will esta­  
blish in the minds of British seamen a pride  
of superiority and a spirit of domination, and  
in the minds of American seamen a conscious­  
ness of inferiority and a servile spirit of sub­  
mission, that ages will not eradicate. If the  
question is allowed to remain undetermined,  
American seamen will fight in defence of  
  
tneir liberty, whenever they see the smallest  
prospect of escaping, ami sometimes when  
there is none. They will kill and be killed.  
Some will be punished for their re slat anew on  
board the British men of war; and some may  
be carried to a British port aud there pro­  
secuted for piracy and murder. This how­  
ever, will seldom or ever be done ; for I still  
belieye, there is sense and, justice enough in  
the British nation and their juries to netjuit  
any seaman, American or British, who should  
kill {. press-gang in defence of his liberty ;  
but if he should escape and return to Ame­  
rica, and be here prosecuted, I will not be­  
lieve there is a judge or juror on the conti­  
nent so ignorant of the law, so dead toevery  
sense of justice, so abandoned to every feel­  
ing of Immunity, as to find him guilty of any  
crime, if it weru proved that he had killed a  
dozen press gang? in defence of his freedom.  
VVc shall have a continual warfare, at sea,  
like that lately at O.anton. Our Secretary of  
State s office will he filled with representa­  
tions and complaints ; our nation will be held  
in a constant state of irritation and ferment­  
ation, and our government always distress­  
ed, between their anxiety to relieve their  
fellow citizens, and their inability to serve  
them;  
A ’Tpublican, who asserts the duty of jea­  
lousy, ought to suspect, that this proclama­  
tion whs dictated by a spirit as hostile and  
malicious as it was insidious, for the deter­  
mined purpose of depressing the character  
of our seamen. Take from a sailor his  
pride and his Courage, and he becomes a  
poor animil indeed. Broken hearted, de­

What but the haughty spirit of titir sea­

ported for ages by the nation, has gi^in the  
British navy its superiority over the ?%vies  
pf other nations ? “ Who shall dare to set  
bounds to the commerce and naval ktwer  
of Great Britain ?” is the magnificcnUan­  
guage of defiance in Parliament, and i\ vi­  
brates and echoes through every heart iAthe  
nation. Every British sailor is made tohe­  
lieve himself the master and commandeiof

much reason to say, let us no longer rejoice  
for independence, or think of a navy or free

the world, but bow our necks again to the  
yoke of Great Britain.

Is this right of impressment to be all on

step as ever the court of St. James has ta­

It is said, in the context, “ The British

has been exercised, and whnt iirf.it it lias  
been considered hv the English ** &#x27;.ion. It  
amounts to a right of getting then/ officers,  
lawfully killed. But surely, no light was  
ever before claimed to impress mj i from fo*  
reign ships. If such a pretended right was  
ever exercised, or, in other word, if such :i  
crime was ever committed, i/presume it  
would he no better proof of a leg^ fight, than  
a robbery, burglary, or niurdei committed  
on sd)ore, would prove that sue! actions are  
inv &quot;ent and lawful. To argurftroin single !  
ft hr a few instances to a gfieral law, is  
i &gt;phistry too common with lolitical wri­  
ters, and is sometimes imputabl- to compilers  
of the laws of nations; but (one of them  
ever went to such extravag inf; as this. No  
claim or pretension of anv rigjfc to search fo- :  
reign vessels for seamen, eve/existed before j  
  
imr revolution ; and no exef i*e of such a  
right ever prevailed since, xcept sticli as  
resemble the exercise of the ight of commit­  
ting robbery, burglary and rruder in some of  
our cities. No nges have ttssed since our  
revolution. The right w.t never asserted  
or claimed, till the late prc’.amation of the  
king appeared, and that pfclamation will  
make an epoch of disgraetjand disaster to  
one nation or the other, pe^aps to both.  
From the peace of ]783/&gt; the r.nmmence­  
nmnt of our government, bder the present  
national constitution, wbefver any Ameri­  
can seamen were imprest, they were im­

ever pretending to such t iii tof Impressment.!  
Ihiring the adn;inistrat»i of Washington,!  
whenever information \4s received of any !  
impressment, immcdia&#x27;.ordcrs were sent to  
demand the men, and ih*nen were promis- i

I albot »o tbc West-Indi/. as an agent to de- j  
mand seamen impress* on board British  
men of war. Talbot dfmnded them of th-s

and was refused. He &gt; cnt then on shore,&#x27;

could furnish, witl*t violating that respect

made, and necessity was sometimes hinted ;  
but no serious pretension of right was advan­

king&#x27;s proclamation. With what propriety  
then, can this be called a right % claimed and  
exercised for ages, and during the whole of

Is there any reason why another procla­

reasons for that opinion will be found in the  
following commentaries, which were written  
for private amusement, within a few days af­  
ter the appearance in publick of this. -  
TEXT,  
“ The proclamation’ of the King of Great  
Britainy requiring the veturn of his subjects,  
the acamen especially, from forcign countrics,  
to aid in this hour of peculiar durger, in de.  
Jence of their own,”  
“ But it being an acknowledged principle,  
that every nation has a right to the service o  
its subjects in time of wary that proclamation  
cauld not furnish the slightest ground for un  
rmb‘rp.ii  
This putiial description has a tendency to  
deceive maany, and no doubt has deceived  
thousands, lis concealing the asp in a bas­  
ket of figs. The dangerous alarming and fa­  
tal partofthe proclamation is kept carefully out  
of sight. Proclamations of one kind are of  
immemorial usage ; but the present one is  
the first of the kLI. Proclamations of the  
first kind, issued wsually in the beginning of  
@ war, are in effect but simple invitations to  
subjects, who happen to be abroad, to return  
home, To deny the right of the king to is­  
sue them, would be as unreasonable us to de+  
ny his right to send a card of invitation to  
one of his subjects to dine with him on St.  
George’s day. But in neither caseis the  
subjeet bound by law to_accept the invitation.  
L As it is natural to every human mind to sy m­  
- pathize with its native country whe in dis­  
tress or danger, it is well known that consid­  
erable numE:n of British commonly return  
hompre from various foreign countries, in con­  
sequence of these invitations by proclama-  
MM«  
  
- gemts, governotfs and other officers give the  
- proclamations a general circulation, sthwulate  
the people 1o return, and contrive many  
means to encom&#x27;aigc and facilitate their pas­  
sages. All this is very well ; all this is  
within the ruies of modesty, decency,’law and  
~Justice ; no reasonable man will object to it.  
But none of these proclamations, till this last,  
evepasserted a right to take British subjects,  
by force, from the ships of foreign® natians,  
any more than frdm the cities and provinces  
of foreign nations. On the other hand, it is  
equally cleary that British subjects in foreign  
countries are under no indispensable obliga­  
tion of religion, morality, law or policy, to re­  
turn in compliance with such proclamations.  
No penalty is annexed by English laws to any  
neglect ; no, nor to any direct or formai dis­  
obedience. Hundreds, in fact, do neglect and  
disobey the proclamations to one who com­  
plies with them, Thousands who have for.  
nmed establishments and -scttled {amilies, or  
become naturalized, or méade contracts, or ens  
listed on board merchant ships,or cven ships  
| of war in foreign countries, pay no regard to  
these orders or invitations of their former  
savereign. Indeed, all who have become na­  
turalized in foreign countries, or entered into  
contracts of amy kind, publick ar private, with  
governments or merchauts, or farmers, or  
manufacturers, have no right to return until  
they have futfilled their covenants and obli­  
gations. The President of the United States  
bas &amp; legul authority to issue similar procla­  
mations, dad they would be as much respect­  
ed by American citizens, ail ovgr the globe.  
But every American would uxl- compli­  
ance was voluntary, and none, whose engage­  
ments abroad were incompatible, would obey.  
—DBut %it is an acknowledged principle, that  
every nation has a right to she service of its  
subjects in time M.?&quot; !.y’whﬁ&quot;hlt:-  
principle acknowledged no man,  
lieve, in the unlimited sense in which it is  
‘here asserted—With certain qualifications  
and restrictions it may be admitted. With­  
in the realm and hig own dominions the King  
has a right to the service of his subjects, at  
sea and on land, by voluntary enlistments, and  
to send them abroad on foreign voyages, ex­  
peditions and enw-priuo-z:t it would be  
difficult to prove the right of any executive  
mthoﬁqoﬁvfmpooﬂewcomwhemb­  
jects into nervbclmnvipﬁom or impress­  
ments, like gally-slaves, at the point of the  
bayonet, or befote the mouths of field artille­  
ry. Extreme cases and imperious neccssi­  
tys it is said, haye no hvb: but such exmn&amp;i‘-  
ties necessify must be very obvious to  
who::* nation, or_ freemen will not comply.  
I mpressments, of from British mer­  
chantmen in pﬂg at sea, are no better than  
the oonel:rbu of soldiers by Napoleon or  
Lewis XIV. who set him the example. So  
  
much for that part of ;:M which  
the text produces to k view. Now 3  
u(x!oothapnm which it has artfully  
ed. . |  
The King not only commands his subjects  
to return, but he commands the officers of his  
| navy to search the merchant ships of neus  
trals, (imeaning Americans, for it is not -  
cable tolnfgserl, nor intended to be m.&#x27;  
ed fo any others,) and impress all British seas  
men the{ find on board, without any  
to any allegations of naturalization ; wm  
any regard to any certificates of citizenship  
without regard to any contracts, covenants or  
connections they have formed with - captains  
or owners ; and without regard to any mar­  
riages, families or children they may‘{ue in  
Awmerica. Andln what principle or law iy  
this founded ? Is there any law of God to  
support it 7 Tls there any law of nature to  
justify it ? Is there any law of llﬁndto  
duthorise it ! Certainly not, The laws of  
England have no binding foree on Loard A­  
merican ships, more than the laws of China  
or Japan, The lawsof the United States  
alone, of whixh the law of nations is a part,  
have dominion over our merchant ships. In  
what law then is it grounded i In the law of  
-nations ? It is a cognterfeit foisted. into that  
law, by this arbitrary, fraudulent proclamas  
tion, for the first rime: Such a title, as I  
hressment of Seamen, was never found in any  
code of laws, since the first cause was launchi«  
¢dinto the sea ; not even in that of England.  
Whoever claims a right must produce &amp; law  
to support it. But thi proclamation attempts  
to transfer a pretended right of |  
scamen from their own ships, which i  
is only an ¢normous abuse, to the lzpnaw  
ment of seamen from foreign nations, foreign  
ships and foreign subjects, The honour of&quot;

natural and m\ﬁo&#x27;\ul resentment of ﬁjuﬂu’

est oppression under inh;nmmitz’ cruelty,  
couldpncur have appeared in the world, had  
not the spirits of Lord Bute and Lord George  
Germaine risen aguin at St. James&#x27;s.  
It is in vain for the Britons to say, t?o  
men are the King&#x27;s subjects. How arp they  
the King&#x27;s subg&#x27;lccu ! By British laws. And  
what are British laws to us, on the high seas ?  
No more than the laws of Qtaheite. We  
Americans must say they are our fellow­  
citizens by our laws. They have sworn alle­  
giance to the United Sta;;cu. We I&#x27;;lvo ad+  
mitted them to all the rights and privileges  
of American citizehs, and by this ldn‘“z!  
have contracted with them to support und de­  
fend them in the enjoyment of all such rights.

to afford it. what is the impressment of  
scamen ! It 1s fio better than what the clvilie  
ans call Plagiant, a crime punishable with  
death by all civilized nations, as one of the  
most audacious and punishable offences as  
gainst seciety. It was so considered a  
the Hebrews.—¢ He that stealeth a mm  
selleth him, or if he be found in bis hand,  
he shall surely be put to death,” Exodus :  
31,17, % If a man be found stealing any ofhis  
brethren, then that thief shall die.” Deuter­  
onomy 24, 7. The laws of Athens, like those  
of the Hebrews, condemned the pl:fhry or  
man stealer to death ; and the lawsof Rome  
pronotinced the same judgment against the

THEY will be &quot;thought to havs  
no friends in Amerita, who will qare  
enoygh for them {0 mke much noise,

as birth. But if neither Engiilh,  
Scotch, Irifkh, Welsh, Iralian, German,  
Dutchman, Spaniard, Portuguele,  
East or Weft-India-man, is found, the  
‘reverend Licttenant will think, if he is  
prudent enough not tofay, Jura  
negat {ibi lata, nihil non arrogat ar­  
mis.”” “Our ship is so weakly man­  
ned, that we cannot fight an enemy ;  
we cannot even navigate her in fafety,  
in bad weather ; Procul a Jove, pro­  
cul a fulmine, I will take as many  
native Americans as I please. It will  
be long before I can be called to ac­

meritorious impreflment, gnd I am  
{ure of friends, who will not daly bring  
me off, but A obtain a promotion for  
me, evea for this patriotic a&amp;ion.”’—  
How.many American ships and car­  
goes will be {unk in the sea, or driven  
on shore, wrecked and loft ; how ma­  
ny malters and remaining sailors will  
be buried in the ocean fer want of the  
assistance of the men thas kidnapped  
and stolen, no human forefight can  
calculate. It is, however, easy to

sreat, These conlideratigns, it seems,  
gn»wmg&amp;rwwmmmﬁnor  
the Britith Ministry. Their hearts  
are not taught to feel another’s woe.  
But all these things the captain and  
owner of an American merchant ship  
mult take into consideration, and  
make the fubjeéts of calculation before  
they can venture to sea. In short,  
there fthould be a corporation eredted  
in every State for the exptefs purpose  
of insuring again® impreflaent of sea­

But the poor {ailors can rever be fafe.  
The law must be fertled. or remain  
unsettled. If such impreffments are  
determined to be legal; either by trea­  
ty, or by acquiescence inthe King’s  
Proclamationy it will eftablith in the

Britain ?”” is the magnificent languagpe  
of defiance in Parliment,and it vibrates  
and echoes through every heart in  
the nation. Every Britith sailor is  
made to believe himfelf the master  
and commander of the world. If the  
right of impressment is conceded by  
us, in theory or pradice, our feamen’s  
hearts will be broken, and every Bri­  
tith (ramaa will {ay to every American  
seaman, as the Six-nations of Indians  
said to the southern tribes, whom théy  
had conquered, ¢ We have put peiticoats  
on you.” In such a case, many would  
have too much reason to fay, let us no  
longer rejoice foi independence, or  
think of a navy or free commerce, no  
longer hope for any rank in the world,  
but bow our necks again to the yoke  
of Great Britain. .

against France, and to prevent the  
French Emperor from. fending fifty­  
thoufand men to conquer the United  
States of America.” All this will not  
convince American seamen. They  
will answer ; ¢ We think a balance  
of power on the ocean as neceflary as  
on the continent of Europe. We  
thank you for your civility in kindly  
giving Qs hopes, that yon will defend  
us from the French army of fifty­

to take our defence upon ourselves.

Should one of onr gun.boat3 meet

and: Americans, at sea, and lay an  
immoveable foundation of eternal  
hatred between the two nations. The  
king’s proclamation will be found as  
impolitic a Rep as ever the court of

qpr revolation. The right was never  
asserted or claimed, till the late procla.  
mation of the king‘appeared, and that  
prociamation will make an epoch of  
disgrace and difalter to onepation or  
the other, perhaps to both.  
From the peace of 1783 to the  
commencement of our government,  
under the present national cenftitution,  
whenever any American seamen were  
imprefled, they were immediately de­  
manded in the name of&quot; the old con­  
gress, and immediately discharged,  
without ever pretending to such right  
of impreflivent. During the admin­  
istration of Wathington, whenever in­  
formation was received of any imprefi­  
ment, immediate orders were sent to  
demand the men, and the men were  
promised to be liberated. Wathing­  
ton sent capt. Talbot to the Welt-In­  
dies, as&#x27;an agent to demand seamen  
imprefled on board British men of war.  
Talbot demanded them of the British  
commandeérs, captains and admirals,  
and was refuled. He went then on  
shore, and demanded and obtained of  
the ghtief jultice of the island, writs of  
habeas corpus, by virtue of which the  
imprefled seamen were brought fiom.  
the king’s ships, and set at liberty by  
law, the commanders not daring to  
disobey the king’s writ. During the  
administration of Adams, the secre­  
tary of state’s office can shew what  
démands were made, and the fuccefi  
of them. The remonflrances that  
were made in consequence of positive  
inkrudtions, and the memorials pres  
fented at court by our ministers,  
were conceived in terms as Riong as  
the Eanglith Janguage could furnifh,  
without violating that refpe@ and  
decorum which ought always to be  
preserved between nations and govern­  
ments, even in declarations of war.  
The pradtice was asserted to be not  
only incorpatible with every principle  
of justice and every feeling of human­  
ity, but wholly irreconcileable with all  
thoughts -6f a continuance of peace  
and friendfhip between the two na­  
tions. The effe® of the memorial  
was, an immediate ordet to the com­  
manders-of the navy 1o liberate the  
demanded men. I shall fay nothing  
of Mr. Jefferfon’s adminifiration, be­  
cause the negotiations already made­  
public, fufficiently show, that he has  
not been behind either of his prede­  
cessors in hiszeal for the liberty of A­  
merican feamep. During all this  
time,excufes and apologies were made,  
and peceflity was sometimes hinted ; ¥  
but no féfious pretension of right was&#x27;  
advanced. . No. . The firft formal  
claim was the king’s proclamation.  
With what propriety then, ¢an thisbe  
called a right, claimed and exercised  
for ages, and during the ‘whole of the­  
- of Washington, of  
Adams, and Jefferfos? .~  
Is there any’?ﬁb‘y- another  
proclamation should aot soon appear,  
commanding all thmﬁrm?&#x27;tbc  
army in Canada and Nova-Scotia to­  
-8o over the line, and take by force all  
the king’s fubje@s -they can find in  
our villages. The right would sand  
upon the fame principles ; but there  
is this difference—it would not be ex­  
ecuted with so liutle danger,

that the connection between the king and

This, however, en passant.

the United States. &#x27;I he midsnipman is to J

- Tuurrow, when he was Chanceller, haz­  
arded a saying to a committee of the city of  
London, that the practice of impressment of  
seamen was legal ; but the committee an­  
swered him respectfully, but firmly, theugh  
*in the presence of the King in a&amp;:unci!—&amp;  
% We acknowledge the high autkority of  
your Lordship’s opinign, but we must declare  
that we are ofa very different opinion ;&quot; and  
their answer appeared to be applawded by the  
nation. Press-gangs are continually oppesed  
and resisted at sea, by the sailors, whenever  
they have the means or the least hope of es­  
caping. Navy officers and men ave some­  
timaes killed, and there is no inquisition for  
their blood. As little noise as possible is  
made sboutit. Itis known to be justifiable  
ihomicidc to take the life of an assailant in  
the necessary defence of a man&#x27;s liberty.  
- There is not a ;ury in England who would l  
find a verdict of murder or manslaughter a­  
gainst any sailor, on land or at sea, who  
; should kill any one of a press-gang in the ne­  
cessdry defence of his liberty from impress- {  
| 1 .  
~ment. Press-gangs on shore are often resist.  
ed by the people, fired on, some of them  
wounded, sometimes killed. Yet no inquisi­  
tion is made for this. The practice is held  
in abhorrence by the menof war&#x27;s-men them­  
selves. The boatswain of the Rose frigate,  
after the acquittal of the four Irish sailors  
who were prosecuted in a special Court of  
- Admiralty at Boston, for killing a gallantdnd  
amiable officer, Lieutenant Panton said,  
« This is a kind of work in which I have  
been almost cotistantly engaged for twehty  
years, i. ¢, in fighting wid\,gsoncu sailors, to  
deprive them j their liberty ; I always sus­  
pected that loughgto be hanged&#x27;for ity but .  
now I know it.” Since I have alluded to this  
case, it may not be amiss to recollec some |  
other circumstances of it. i  
A prgss-gang from the Rose, commanded .  
by Lieutenant Pantoy, with a Midshipmun  
and a number of ordinary seamen, visited  
and searched a merchant-ship from Marble­  
head, belonging to Mr. Hooper, at sea. &#x27;Fhe  
Licutenant enquired if any English, Trish or  
Scothmen were on bodard ¥ Not s&amp;ﬁl%ed_ with  
the answer he received, he prepared to ssan  
the ship from stem to stern~-At last he  
found four Irishmen retired and concealed in  
the forepeak. With swords and pistols he{  
immediately laid sicge to the enclosure and  
summoned the men to surrcnder. Corbetty  
who lhiad the cool «intrepidity of a Nelson,  
reasoned, remonstrated and luid down the law  
with the precision of a Mansfield. « I know  
who you are. You are the Licutenant of 8 mag  
of war, come with a press-gang to deprive me  
of my liberty. You have no right to impress  
me. I have retreated from you as far as Ican; 1.  
can go no farther. 1 and my companions are  
determined to stand upon our defence. Stand  
off.” The sailors within and without em­  
ployed their usual language to each other,  
and a Midshipman, in the confusion, fired a  
pistol into the forepeak and broke an arm of  
one of the four. g:rbett, who stood at the  
entrance, was engaged in a contest of mena­  
ces and defiances with the Licutenent. He  
repeated what he had before said, and mark­  
ing aline with a hAarpioon in the salt, with  
which the sh{: was loaded, said, ¢ You are  
determined to deprive me of my liberty, and  
lam determined to defend it. If you step  
over that line, I shall consider it as a proof  
that you are determined to impress me, and  
by the eternal God of Heaven, you are a dead  
man.” ¢ Aye, my lad,” said the Lieutenant,  
“ I have seen many a brave fellow, before  
now.” Taking his snuff-box out of his pock­  
et, and taking a pinch of snuff, he very de­  
liberately stepped over the line and attempt­  
ed to seize Corbett. The latter, drawing  
hack his arm, and driving his harpoon with  
“all his force, cut off the carotid artery and  
jugular vein, and laid the Lieut. dead at his  
feet. The Kose sent a reinforcement to the  
  
press-gang ; broke down the bulk-head, and  
  
seized the four Irishmen, and brought them  
to trial for piracy and murder. The Court  
consisted of Governour Bernard, Governour  
Wentworth, Chief Justice Hutchinson, Judge  
Achmuty, Commodore Hood himself, who  
then commanded all the ships of war on tke  
stationy now a peer of the British Empire,  
and twelve or fifteen others, counsellors of  
Massachusetts, New-Hampshire and Rhode-  
Island.—After the trial, the President, Gov­  
ernour Bgrnard, pronounced the judgment of  
the Court, that the action of the pßisoners  
was justifiable homicide, and in this opinion  
the whele Court was unanimous, Thesailor  
who was wounded in the arm, hrought an ac­  
tion against the Midshipman, and Com. Hood,  
himself interposed, and made compensation  
to the sailor, to his satisfaction, after which  
the action was withdrawn. Such was the  
impressment of seamen, as it stood, by law,  
beforc our rebolution. The author of my  
text, then, carries his courtly complisance to  
the English government, farther than the  
Governours Bernard &amp; Hutchinson, and even  
than Lord Hood carried it, when we were a  
part of the British empire. He thiubd::}  
as every mation has a right to the service  
igs subjects, in time of war, the proclamation  
  
MAY 17, 11809,  
  
ox gtg&#x27;of Great Britain commanding his  
naval officers to practise such impressments,  
onvboard, not the vessels of his own subjects,  
but, ofthe United States, a foreign nation,  
could not furnish the slightest ground for wn  
I&quot;.mbug&amp;t It is not necessary for me to say,  
that any thing could furnisha guflicient ground  
for an emburgo, for any long time ;3 this, 1  
leave to the responsibility of our President,  
Senators and Representatives in Congress.  
But, 1 say with eonfidence, that it furnishe.l d  
sufficient ground for @ declaration of war =  
Not the murder.of Peirce, nor all the mur­  
ders on board the Chesapeak, wor all the  
othergjnjuries and insults, we have received  
from tg&amp;gn nations, atrocious as they have  
been, cin be.of such dangerous,’ lusting and  
E::icious conséquence to this country, as  
is proclamation, if we have servility enough  
to submit to it.  
  
&#x27; W’r would the author of my text have  
. Would he counsel the President to  
stipulate, in a treaty with Great Britain, that  
his navy officérs should forever hereafior have  
a right to visit ail American merchant ships,  
end impress from them all of English, Scotch  
and lrish Scamen { &#x27;Will he bz so good as to  
explair: the distinction between ships of war  
and wmerchant ships ! Are not merchant ships  
under the jurisdiccon and entited to the pro­  
tection of the lawsof their country upon the  
seas; as much as ships of war? Isnot a mer­  
chant ship as much the tergitory of the United  
States, as a ship of war &#x27;~~Would the author  
of my text advise the President and Congress .  
to acyuiesce, in silence under this proclama­  
tion, and permit it to be cxecuted forever  
Jlereafter ! &#x27;Would not such a tame and si­  
lent acquiescence,as effectually yield the point,  
and establish the practice, if&#x27;not the law, as  
an express stipulation in a solemn treaty ? If  
‘the United States had as powerful a navy as  
(3, Brituin, and Great Britain as feeble a force  
at&#x27;sedy ascours, would le adviye the Presi­  
deng, either to concode the prinoi?le by trea- .  
ty or m init, in silence boei the  
circu of great power or great weuk­  
ness make any alteration in the. principle or  
the rvight? Should the capt. or crew of an  
Americsti ‘merchantman, resist a British  
gun-m the high scus, and in defence  
their ys kill the commander, and all  
under hi::&quot;rnd then make their escupe, and  
after returiing to Sulem, boproucuted, would  
the writer of my text, as a judge or a juror,  
give his jUdgmett for finding them guilty of  
murder orpiracy ? Althoughthe Embargo was  
made the watchword, in our late eléction, the  
votes, in Jr greatest nupseries of searacn,for  
‘exampie, in Salem, uuﬁu—m in Barns  
stable, Sandwich -andl other places on Cape  
Cod, in Nantucket and the Vineyard and oth­  
er places, seemed to shew, that our scamen  
prefered to be embargoed, rather than go to sca  
to be impiressed., ’  
No doubt it will be sald that we have noth­  
ing to do with the question in England, con­  
cerning the legality or iHegality of impress­  
ments. This, as long. as they.co: fine the  
law and the i)m&#x27;ctice to their own country, to  
their own ships and their own seamen, is rea­  
dily&quot; acknowledged. We shal} leave them to  
justify their own usage, whether it is a mere  
abuse, or a legitimate custom, to their own  
consciences, to theit own sense of equity,  
humanity or policy. Byt when they arrogate  
a right, and presume, in fact, to transfer their  
usurpation to foreign nations, or rather to A­  
mericans, whom they presume to distinguish  
from all other nations, it becomes the inte­  
rest, the right, and the indispensable duty of  
our government to inquire into the nefarious  
nature of it in England, in order to expose  
the greater turpitude ol&quot; it when transferred  
to us, 4s well as to oppose and resist it to the  
utmost of their power ; and it is equally the  
duty of the people to support their governs  
ment in such opposition,to the last extremity.  
Permit me now to enquire, what will be  
the effcts of, am eStablished law and &#x27;Practicc  
of British impressments of seamen, from A­  
merican ships, upon the commerce, the navi­  
gation and the peace of the United States,  
and above all, upon the hearis and minds of  
their scamen, /  
In considering those innumerable dangers,  
from winds tn(f scas, rocks and shoals; to  
which all ships are exposed, in their voyages,  
the owner and master must sit down (:?eth­  
¢ry in order to determine the number of sea«  
men necessary for the voyage. They must  
calculate the chances of impressment, and  
engage a supernumerary list of sailors, that  
they may be able to spare as many as the  
British Lle\nznam shall please to take, and  
have enough left to securg the safety of the  
- ship and cargo, and above all, the lives of the  
master and crew. They know not how many  
British ships of war they may meet, hor how  
mani; sailors the conscience of each Licuten­  
ant Joay allow him to impress. For the Licu­  
tenant isgo be judge, jury, sheriff and gaoler,  
to every seaman in American vvesels. He is  
to try many important questions of law and  
and of fact. WV bc‘t:r the sailor is a native  
of America ; whether he has been lawfully  
nituralized in America ?~~Whether he is an  
Englishman, Scotchman, or Irishman 7w  
Whether he emigrated to America before  
~ the revolution or since ’—lndeed, no evidence  
is 1o be admirted of any raturalization by our  
  
lawa, in any of ihe States, sincg the revolution,  
if begfore. In truth, the doctﬁq of the inhe­  
rent and indefeasible duty of allegiance is ass  
serted, so peremptorily, in the prociamation,  
that the lieutenant may think it his duty to  
‘impress every man who was born in the  
British dominions. It may bg Wre opinion of  
  
this learned judge,that the connexion between  
the king uj«tho subject, is so sacied and di­  
vine, that alegiance cannot be dissolved by  
any treaty the king has made, or even by.any  
act of Parllament. nd this pivus sentiment  
may subject us @ll (o impressment, af ONCem—  
This, however, en fassant, »  
The Licutgnant is to oider the captain‘of  
the merchantman to lay before him a Jist of  
his crew ; he is then to command the crew  
to be drdered or suimmoned, or mustered to  
pass in review before him. A u&amp;nmwﬁn

Lord Keppel suid, that he knew the maxim  
of British seamen to be, “ to do no right end’

in this, they all scem to agreey officers aml

of the same opinion, that the werld was madé”

law is this founded ? Is there any law  
of God to support it ? Is there any law  
of nature, to justify it ? Is there any  
law, of England to authorise it ? Cer­  
tainlynt)t. The laws of England have  
no binding force on board American  
ships, more than the laws of China or  
Japan. The law of the United States  
alone, of which the law of nations is a  
part, have dominion over our merchmt  
ships. In what law thcriisit grounded ? In  
the law of nations ? It is a counteifeif  
foisted into that law, by this aibitrary,  
fraudulent .proclamation, for the firs  
time. Sucha title, as Impressment of  
Sears&#x27;.ny wj never found in any code of  
lawi? since the first cause was launched  
into &quot;ttic s-.i ; not.even in that of Eng­  
land. Whoever claims a light must  
produce a law to support it. fiut thi;  
proclamation attempts to transler a pre  
tended righ- of impressing seamen from  
their own ships, which in truth is only  
n enormous abuse, to the impressment  
of seamen from foreign nations, foreign  
ships and foreign subjects. The honor  
of this gross attemps this affront to our  
understanding as well as feelings ; this  
contempt of-our natu al and national  
resentment of injuries, a well as of our  
sympathies witb fallow-citizens and fel­  
low creatures, surf. ring the vilest op  
prcssioh under inhumanity and cruelty,  
r.ould never have appeared in the world,  
had not the spirits of Lord Bute and  
Lord George Germaine risen again at  
St. James&#x27;s. .  
It is in vain for the Britons to sny,  
theve men arc the Kind&#x27;s sutj cts.  
How are they the King&#x27;s subjects ? B  
British laws. And whit are Bri:ih  
laws to u, op the high seas ?  
more than the laws of Ouheite. Wk  
&quot;Vmericans must say they are ourfellow-citizens  
by our laws. -Th- )  
have sworn allegiance to the United  
States, We have admitted them o al!  
the rights and privileges of American  
citizens, and by this admission him­  
contracted with ihem to support ;ind de  
fend thern in the enjoyment of all surh  
rights. Our laws ai. knowledge no di­  
vine rij;ht of K&#x27;ngs, greater than ihose  
of subjects, or any indt feasible duty of  
subjects more than that of King to  
obedience. Thrse remnan&#x27;s of feudal  
tyranny and ecclesiastical superstition,;  
have long since b?en expl.ded in Am--rica.  
The King claims them to make  
them slaves. The President of the U.  
States claims them, as it is bis duty fo  
do, by his efnee and his oath, not to en  
slave them, but to protect them and  
preserve them free.; Our laws are as  
good as British laws. Our citizens  
have as good a right to protection as  
British subjects, and our government  
is as much b undto afford it. Wlnt is  
the impressment of seamen ? I&#x27; is no  
bftter than what thp civilians call Pla­  
giat, a crime punishable by death in all  
cmlifrd nations, as one of the most au­  
dacious and punishable offences against  
society. It was so considered among  
the Hrhrews He that siealeth a man  
and selleth him, or if tie be found in his  
hand, he shall surtly be put lo death.&quot;  
Exodus 31. 17, If a man b: f;und  
stealing any of his brethren, ihen that  
thiet . snail die.&quot; Deuteronomy 24. 7.  
The laws of-Athens, like those of the  
Hebrews, condemned th pigiary or  
man stealer to death ; and the laws of  
Home pronounced the same judgment  
against the same outrage. But to de­  
scend from the Hebtews, Greeks and  
Komans to the British. What is tht-&quot;  
impressment of seamen in England by  
their own Jawt, in their own ports, from  
their own ships within the four seas, or  
any where on the high seas ? It is said  
to be ah us-ce. So were shiD-m nc?.  
loans and benevolences in the reijrn of  
Charles the first, and arguments were  
urged by his courtiers, to prove their  
legality,, as pliusible and conclusive as  
any that hic been produced by Judge  
roster, in favor of impressment. ,It is  
at best bat an al use, subsisting only by  
JLoIer.tion andjcounivance, like the prac­  
tice in llolland of kidnapping men for  
settlers or servants in BaUvia. It is i,

ivrujciple of English liberty. It is a di­

TEXT.  
  
The proclamation of the kinir of G. Britain, rrtuhinir  
  
the return ol nil subject, Uie teamen especially, lrom fo  
  
reign coun&#x27;nci,.io aia in uui aour 01 peculiar danger, ui  
dcience of their own.&quot;  
  
&quot;But it bemff an acknowledired principle that every nati  
  
on has aright to the service of its subjects in time of war,  
  
: hat prociumauon could not lurtusn the slightest ground  
for an embarffo.&quot; . &#x27;  
  
This partial deicnpUon has a tendency to deceive  
  
many, and no doubt has deceived thousands. It iV  
  
concealing the at1 in a batket of Jig. The dange  
  
rous, alarming and tatal part 01 the proclamation i  
  
kept creuilly out ot sight, f reclamations ot one  
  
kind are of immemorial usage ; but the present one  
  
is the first of the kind, Proclamauons of the firs!  
  
kind, issued usually in the beginning of a war, are  
  
111 effect tiut simple invitations to subjects, who hap  
  
pen to do abroad, to return home, lo deny the  
  
right of the king to issue them, would be as unrea  
  
sonable as to deny his right to send a card Of invita  
  
tion to one of his subjects to civc with him on St.  
  
George&#x27;s day. But in neither case is the subject  
  
bound by law to accept tht invitation. None of these  
  
proclamations, till this last, ever asserted a right to  
  
take Bnush subjects by lorce, irom the ships of fo­  
reign nations, any more than from the cities and  
provinces of foreign nations. On the other hand, it  
  
is equally clear, that Entish Subjects in foreign coun  
tries are under no indispensable obligation of religi  
  
on, morality, law or pohcy, to return in compliance  
  
with such proclamations. No penalty is annexed  
  
by English laws to any neglect ; no, nor to any di  
  
rect or formal disobedience. Hundreds in fact, do  
neglect and disobey the proclamations to one who  
  
complies with them. Thousands who have, form  
  
ed establishments and settled families, or become  
naturalized, or made contracts, or enlisted on board  
merchant shtys, or even ships of war in foreign  
  
countries, pay no regard to these orders or invitati  
  
ons of their lormer. sovereign. Indeed, all who have  
  
become naturalised in foreign countries, or entered  
  
into contracts of any kind, public or private, with  
  
governments or merchants, or farmers or munufac  
  
tures, have no right to return until diey have fulfilled  
  
their covenants and obligations. -The President of  
  
the United atates has us legal anthoritv to issue si  
  
nulur proclamations, and they would be as much res­  
pected by American citizens, all over the elobe.  
  
But every American would say his complLnce was  
voluntarily, and none, whose engagements abroad  
  
were incompatible, would obey. But &quot; it is an ac  
  
knowledged principle, that every nuon lias a right  
to the sen ice of its subjects in time of war.&quot; iJy  
  
whom is this principle acknowledged ? By no man  
I believe, in the unlimitted sense in which it is bprJ  
  
asserted. With certain qualifications -and restric­  
tions it may be admitted. Within the realm and  
  
his own diminions the king has a right to the ser­  
vice of his subjects, at sea and on land, by voluntary  
enlistments, and to send them ubrorj on foreign voy­  
ages, expeditions and enterprises but it would be  
difficullto prove the tight of uny executive authority  
of a free people to compel free subjects into service  
by conscriptions or impressments, like galley-sluvcs  
at the point of the bayonet, or before the- mouths  
ol field artillery. Extreme cese and imperious ne­  
cessity, it is saKl, havc,no raw but such extremities  
and necessity must be very obvious to the whole  
nation, . freemen will not comply. Impressments  
ol seamen from Bnush merchantmen in port or a  
sea, are no better than the conscriptions of sokliers  
byNarx)leonorLeW,sXlV.who set him the ex­  
ample. So much for that part of the proclamation,  
which the toKt produces to public view. Now for  
the other part, which it has artfully concealed.  
Thurlow, when he was chancellor, hazarded a  
saying to a committee gf the city of London, that  
  
u. , impressment ot seamen was leiral s

BY THE LATE PRESIDENT ADAMS  
f Continued.)  
They will be thought to have m friends  
in America, who will care enough Tor  
them to make much noise, and these will  
be impiessecl- If th-re should be ant na  
tives or sons of natives of any of the West  
India Islands, or of any part or the East  
Indies, where the king is said to have  
thirty m.llions of subjefls, these must all  
be impressed, for conquest confers in  
d II ble charafler trf subje6\s, as well as  
birth. But if neither English, Scotch. I.  
rish, \Velah, Italian, German, Du.cimian,  
Spaniard, Portuguese, East or West In*  
dia-man is found, the reverend Lieutenant  
will think, if lie is prudent enough not to  
say, “Jura nrgat si hi lata, nihil non arrogat  
armis,” “ Our ship is so weakly man  
*&gt;cd, that w-: cannot Sght an enemy ; we  
cannot even navigate her in safe y, m bad  
weather; firocul a Jove, firocul a fulmine,  
I will take as many native Americans as  
I please. It will be lone: before I can he  
  
called to account ; and at last I can say  
that I saved the king’s ship, and pet haps  
beat a Frenchman by the a d of this mer.  
itorous impressment, and I am sure of  
I friends who wdl not only bring me of?,  
ibui ob ain a promotion for me even for  
ithis palrioiie a6?ion.” How ntai y Amer­  
ican ships and cargoes will be sunk in th  
sea, or driven on shore, wrecked and  
1 #t; how many masters and remaining  
sailors will be buried in the ocean for want  
. of the assistance of the men tht.s kidna­  
ped and stolen, no human foresight can  
calculate. It is, however easy to piedid?,  
■ that the number must be Very great—  
These consideia&#x27;.ions, it teems, have no  
weight in the estimation of the British  
ministry. Their hearts are hot taught to  
feel another’s woe. But all these things  
the captains and owners of American  
racchant ships must take into considera­  
tion, and make the subj r£\s of calculation  
before they can venture to-sea. In short  
there rhould be a Corporation erefiled in  
every state fjr the express purpose of  
insuring against , impres.ment of sea­  
men. In a course oftinte Sc experience  
the chances might be calculated, a-j that  
the insurers ard invured, might at a great  
expense be secure, liut the poor sailors  
can never be safe.  
The law iVittat be settled, or remain un  
settled. II such tmprtsMTiuiUi are deter,  
tmned (o be legal, either by treaty or by  
acquiescence in the king’s proclamation  
it will establish in the minds of British  
seamen a pi ide of superiority and a spir.  
it of domination, and in the minds ol A.  
merican seamen a consciousness of infe­  
riority and a servile spirit of submission,  
  
u.ar ages win not eradicate. II &lt;he qucs­  
ticn is allowed to remain undetermined.  
American seamen will fight in defence

racy and murder. This, however, will  
seldom ever be clone; lor i still b I eve  
there is sense and justice enough in the  
British nation and their juries to acqut  
any teaman, American or British, who  
should kill a press gang in d fence of h s  
liberty ; but ifhe should escape and retu n  
to America and be here pros cuted, 1  
will not believe thee is a judge or jut or  
on lb, continent, so ignorant of the law,  
*• dead to every sense of j stice, so aban_  
doned to every feeling of humanity, as to  
find h m gud i c.f a y crime, if it were  
prov d that he had killed a dozen press,  
gangs in defe nce of his freedom. We  
shall have a continual warfare, at sea,  
like that latalv at C nn»n. Our Secretary  
of State’s office will be filled with repre  
rentntions and complaints $ our nation  
will he held in a constant state of irrita.  
lion and fermentation, 8c our government  
always d.s ressed, between their anxiety  
,to relieve their fellow cuisens and their  
inabilry to serve them.  
A republican, wh asserts theduty of jea­  
lousy, ought to suspect that this proclaim  
non was dilated by a spirit as host lie a d  
malicious as it was iiuidious, for the de.  
• ermincd purpose of depressing the char,  
stter of nurse* men. Take from the iai.  
lor Ins pride and his courage, and he be  
comes a poor animal indeed. Broken

tabiished m Ins mind. At the sight oft  
lirrish man of war a panic will seise him j

( utter or a lugger, lie will think of no.  
dung but High; and escape, Whit but  
  
the haughty spirit of their seamen, which1  
has been encouraged and supported fo&#x27;  
ages by the n ttion. h*-, given the B-itirii  
navy its superiority otre.r the natives ot  
! other nations ? *l Who shat! •»re to s.n  
bounds to the commerce ant! naval power  
of Great Britain?” is he inagnificen  
language ol defiance in Parham at, an;l  
it vibra as and echoes fro*,;&#x27;! cveiy he.ri  
in the nation. Every lit .Its i sailor i.  
mad* lo believe himself the mas.er and  
j commander of Uk world If the right *,f  
impre ament is conceded hr&#x27; us, in theo  
ry or pracric*, our seain-n’s hea ts will  
bebreken, and every British seaman w; 1;  
•ay?pi every American seama « as die !rix  
nati m of Indians sa d to .the Soil hem  
tribes, whom they had conquered, We  
have put the petticoats on you.” In such  
a case many would have too much reason  
to say, let us no longer rejoic* fur iude  
pendence, or th&gt;nk of a navy or free com  
merer, m longer ho*e for any rank In the  
world, but bow our necks again to the yoke  
of Great Britain.  
If the spirit of a man should remain in  
our sailors, they will sometimes resist.  
Sli uld a Bri’ish cutter demand to seated  
American merchant ships,of five hundred  
t tin burthen, aimed as they some’ime  
are and have a right to be—The coniman  
dor of the cutter calls fur a mus&#x27;f of th­  
men, in order to impress such as he. in  
Ins wisdom, shall judge lobe British sub­  
jt£\s. Is it credible that the captain and  
crew of he merchantman w.d submit to  
such usage ? N&quot;, he will sink the boa.  
aad culutr ino, rather than be so insulted,  
and every American must applaud him  
for his spirit.  
Is this right of impressment to be all on  
one side, or is it to be reciprocal ? British  
modesty may say; “It is an exclusive  
privilege, which we claim, assert and will  
maintain’, because it.is necessary to support  
our dominion of the teas, which is necessi­  
ry to preserve a balance of power in Eu­  
ronr. xcriin«f- Franrp. anil tn n.pv.n, »I, .»  
  
French E.nperor from sending fifty thou_  
sand men to conquer the United Slates of  
America.” All this will not convince A­  
merican seamen. They will answer;  
! “We think a balance of power on the ocean  
as necessary as on the continent of Europe.  
We thank you for your civility In kindly  
giving us hopes, that you will defend us from  
tne French army of fifty thousand men ;  
bat we are very willing to take our defence  
upon ouri-elves. If you have a right to  
impress seamen from our ships, wc have  
an equal right to impress from yours.”  
Should one of &lt; ur gun boats meet a Bri­  
tish E.ist Indiaman, armed with 50 guns.  
The gun boat demands a search for Ame­  
rican seamen; calls tor the muster roll,  
commands the men to pass in rev;ew be­  
fore him; would the East India captain  
submit ? No. Ne would Sooner throw o­  
ver board the press gang, and run down the  
gun boat. Such will be the perpetual al­  
tercation between Britons and Americans,  
at sea, and lay an immovable foundation of  
eternal hatred between the two nations.  
The king&#x27;s proclamation will be found as  
impolitic a step as ever the court of St.  
James’ has taken.  
It is said, in the context, “The British  
ships of War, agreeably to a right, claim­  
ed and exercised for ages, a righty claim­  
ed and exercised during the whole of the  
administrations of Washington and Adams,  
and of Jefferson, continue to take some of  
the British seamen, found on board our  
merchant vessels, and with them a small  
number of our3, from the impossibility of  
always distinguishing Englishmen from  
the citiaensof the United Sates.” We have  
before seen what sort of a right to impress  
men from their own ships has been claim­  
ed, in what manner it has been ekerctsed,  
anti in what light it has been eonsidered  
by the English nation. It amounts to n  
right of getting their officers lawfully kil­  
led. But surely, no right was ever before  
claimed to impress seamen from foreign  
ships. If such a pretended rieht was ever  
  
exercised, or, in other words, if such a  
crime was ever committed, I presume it  
would be no better prsof of a legal right,  
than a robbery, burglary, or murder, com.  
mitted on shore, would prove that such ac­  
tions are innocent and lawful. To argue  
from single facts or a few instances to a  
general law, is a sophistry too common  
with political writers, and is sometimes  
imputable to compilers of the laws of na.  
tions; but none ot them ever went to such  
extravagance as inis. No claim or preten.  
s on of any right to search foreign vessels  
for seamen, ever existed before our revo­  
lution ; and no exercise of such a right e­  
ver prevailed since, except such as resem­  
ble the exercise of the a right of commit­  
ting ro^iery, burglary and mnrder in some  
of our cities. No ages have passed since  
our revolution. The right was never as.  
serted or claimed, till the late proclamati­  
of the king appeared, and that proclama­  
tion will make an epoch of disgrace and  
disaster to one nation or the other, perhaps  
to both.  
From the peace of 1783 to the commence­  
ment of our goverment, under the present  
national constitution, whenever any Amer­  
ican seamen were impressed, they were  
immediately demanded in the name of the  
Old Congress, and immediately discharged,  
without ever pretending to such right ol  
impressment. During the administration  
of Washington, whenever information was  
received of any impressment, immediate  
orders were sent to demand the men, and  
the men were promised to be liberated.  
Washington sent captain Talbot to the  
West-Indies, as an agent to demand sea.  
men impressed on board British men ol  
war. Talbot demanded them of the Bri.  
tish commanders, captains Si

i ly show, that he ha*» not been behind either of  
nis predecessors in his zeal lor the liberty  
of American seamen. During all this time,  
excuses and apo ogies were made, and ne­  
cessky was sometimes hinted; but no seri­  
ous pretension of right was advanced. No.  
The first formal claim was the king’s  
proclamation. With what propriety then,

THEY will be thought to have ho frignds  
in America, who will care enough for them to  
make luch noise, and these will be impres­  
sed. ¥ there should be any natives or sons  
of matives of sny of the West-India Islends,  
or of apy umn of the Fast-Indies, where the  
King is said to have thirty miliions of sub&lt;  
jects, these must all be hnapressed, for con­  
juest confers the indelible character of sub­  
jects, as well as birth. But if neither Eng­  
lishy Scotch, Irishy Welsh, Italiun, Germun,  
Dutchman, Spaniard, Portuguese, East or  
West-Indiasman, is found, the reverend Licu­  
tenant will think, if he is prudent encugh not  
to say, % Jura negat sibi lata, nihil non arre~  
gat armis.” “ Ourship is so weakly manned,  
that we cannot fight an enmy ; we. cannot  
(wen navigate her in safety, in bad weather ;  
Procul a Jove, procul a fulmine, I will take  
as many native Americans as I please. It  
will be long befere I can be called to accowut ;  
and at last, I can say that I saved the King&#x27;s  
ship, and perhaps beat a Frenchman by the  
aid of this meritorious impressment, wad 1  
am sure of friends, who will not only bring  
me offy but obtain a promotion for me, even  
for this patriotick action.” How many Amer~  
ican ships and cargoes will be sunk in the  
sea, or driven on shore, wrecked and lost ;  
how many masters and remaining sailors will  
be burted in the ocean for want of the assis­  
tance of the men thus kidnapped and stolen,  
ne human foresight can caleulate. It is, how~  
ever, easyto predict, that the number must  
be very great~These considerations, it  
seems, have no weight in the estimation -of  
the British Ministry. Their hearts are mot  
taught to feel another’s woe. DBut all these  
things the captain and ow ner of an Americun  
merchant-ship must take into consideration,  
and make the subjects of calculation before  
they can vesture to sea. In shot, there  
should be a corporation crected in every State  
for the express purpose of insuring n?imt  
mmmom of secamen. In a courseof time  
oxperiente the chances might be calew  
w‘n“’“mbc hw &#x27;ma h, &quot;lisht  
at a great expense secure. ut the r  
-ﬁ“;‘a&#x27;m be safe. &#x27; o  
be law must be settled, or remain unv  
  
settled, Ifsuch impressments are determin­  
ed to be legal, either by tresty, or by acquies­  
cence in the King’s Proclamation, it will es­  
tablish in the minds of British seamen a pride  
of superiority and a spirit of domination, and  
in the minds of American seamen a con  
  
eciousness of inferiority and a servile spirit of  
submission, that ages will not eradicate. If  
the quesdon is allowed to remain undetermin­  
ed, American seamen will fight in defence of  
their liberty, whenever they see the smallest  
prospect of escaping, and sometimes when  
there is none. They will kill and be killed.  
Some will be punished for thelr resistance on  
board the British men of war ; and some may  
be carried to a British port and there prose­  
cuted for piracy and murder. This, how­  
ever, will seldom or ever be done ; for I still  
belfeve there is Sense and justice enough in  
the British nation and their juries t acquit  
any seamen, American or British, who should  
kill a press-gang in defence of*%is liberty ; but  
if he should escape and return to America,  
and be here prosecuted, I will not believe  
there is a judpe or juror on the continent, so  
ignorant of the law, so dead to every sense of  
justice, so abandoned to every feeling of hu­  
manity, as to find him guilty of any crime, if  
it were proved that he had killed a dozen  
press-gangs in defence of his freedom. We  
shall have a continual warfare, at sea, like  
that lately, at Caanton. Owur Secretary of  
Stage’s office will be filled with representa~  
tions and complaints ; our natien will be heid  
in &amp; constant state of irritation and fermenta­  
tion, and our government always distressed,  
between their anxiety to relicve their fellow­  
citizens and their inability to serve them. .  
A republican, who asserts the duty of jeac  
lousy ought to suspect, that this proclamation  
was dictated by a spirit as hostile and mali­  
cbnsu&amp;::; insidiousy for the dcwm;ined  
purpose ressing the character of our  
seamen. Take from a sailor his pride and  
his and he becomes a poor animal  
fndeed. grohn-bamd, dejected, depress­  
ed even below the standard of other menof |  
his own level jn society ~A habit of fear  
will be established in his mind. At the :i?&#x27;&quot; }

zupvc of Great Britain 7’ is the mag­  
cent langhage of defiance in Parliament,  
and it vibrates and echoes through every  
beart ztho nation. Every British sailor is  
‘mander of the world. If the m impress­  
ment is conceded by us, in theery or prac-  
  
  
tice, our seamen’s heurts will be broken, snd  
every Brivsh seaman, will say to every A~  
merican seamen, as the Six-nations 2«»4  
dians said to the southern tribes, whom they  
had conquered, W&#x27;e have put petticears on

much reason fo say, let us no lohger rejoice  
for independence, no longer hope for any rank  
in the world, but bow our necks again to the  
yoke of Great Briwin.  
If the spirit of a man should remain in our  
sallors, they will someuimes resist—~Should a  
British cutter demand to search an American  
merchant ship, of five hundred tons burthen,  
armed as they sometimesare and have a right

and crew .t‘bo-mmm will submit to  
such usage==Noy he will sink theé boat and  
cutter tgo, rather than be so insulted,: und  
every Ametican must applaud him for his  
spirit.  
Is this right of hmpressment to be all on ohe  
side, or is it to be reciprocal ¢ British modes­  
ty may say ; % Itis an exclusive privilege,  
which ve cluim, assert and will meintain, bes  
cause it is necessary to suppovtour deminion  
of the seas, which is necessary to preserve a  
balance of power, in Europe, against France,  
and to prevent the French Emperour from  
sending fifty-thousand men to conquer tha  
United States of America,” All this will  
not convince American seamen. They will  
answer ; “ We think a balan€e of power on  
the ocean as necessary as on the centinent of  
Europe. We thunk you for your civﬂiz in  
kindly givihg us hopes, that you will d  
us from the French army of fifty-thousand  
men ; but we are very willing to take our  
defence upon ourselves. 1f you have a right  
to itnpress seamen from our ohlx:m have an  
equal right to. impress from yours.”  
Should one of our gun-boats meet a Britisht  
East-Indiaman, amva with fifty guns. The  
gun-boat demands a scarchfor American seas  
men ; calls for the muster-roll; commands the  
ten to pass in review before him ; would the  
Fast-India captain submit ! No. He wﬁ  
sooner throw over board the press-gang,  
run dJown the gun-boat. Such wili be the  
perpetual altercutions between Britons and  
Americans, at sea, and lay ah immoveable  
foundation of eternal hatred between the two  
nations. The king’s proclamatien will be  
found as impolidck a step as ever the court of  
St. Juines has taken.  
  
Itis ‘n‘dsh the context, ¢« The BﬂMW  
“of war; agretably ta yiar, chvimed and exs  
ercised for ages=e right, claimed and exer­  
cised during the whole of the administrations  
of Waskingion and Adams, and of Jefferson,  
continue to take some of the British scameny  
found on board our merchant vesdels, and  
with them a small number of ours, from the  
impossibility of always distinguishing Engs  
lishmen from thegitizens of the U, States.”  
We have before seen what sort of a right te  
5  
impress men from fheir own ships has been  
claimed, in what moanner it has been exercise  
edy and in what hght &amp;t has been &#x27; considered  
by the English nation. It amowunts to a right  
of getting their officers, lawfully killed. But  
surely, no right was ever before cleimed to  
impress men from foreign ships. If sucha  
‘pretended right was ever cxercised,or, in  
other words, if such a crime was ever com­  
mitted, 1 pressine it would be ho better proof  
of a legal right, than a robbery, burglary, or  
murder, committed on slore would prove  
that such actions are innocent ‘end lawful,  
To argue from single fucts or a few instances  
to a general law, is a sophistry too common  
with political writers, and is sometimes im+  
putable to compilers of the laws of nations  
but none of them ever went to such extra­  
vagance as this. No claiim or pretension of  
any right to seerch foreign: vessels for sen  
men, ever existed before our revolutic ; and  
no exercise of such a right ever prevailed  
since, except such as resemble the exetcise  
of the right of commitiing robbery, burglary  
‘and murder in some of eur cities. No ages  
have passed since our revolution.e The right  
was never asserted or clalmned, till the Jlate  
proclamatien of the king appeared, and that  
proclamation will make. an epoch of disgrace  
and disaster to one nation of the other, . pere  
haps to both. .  
From the peace of 1783 to the commence­  
ment of our Fovcrnmem, under the present  
national constitution, whenever aby American  
seamen were impressaed,they were immediates  
ly demanded in the vame of the old cohgress,  
and immediately discharged,withoutever pres  
tending to such right of l:&amp;m During  
the administration of Weshington, whenever  
information was received of uny impressment,  
immediate orders were sent 10 demand the  
men, and the men were promised to be liberae  
ted. Washington sent Capt. Talbot to the  
West-Indies, as an agent to demand scamen  
impressed on board British men of war, Tal.  
bot demanded them of the British commande  
ers, captains and .dw&quot; and was refused,  
He went&#x27;then on shore, and demanded and  
obtsined of the&#x27; chief jusice of the Islandy  
writs of babeas cwpus, by virtue of which  
the impressed seamen were Lrought from the

Thurlow, when he wa Chancellor,  
hazarded a sayinpjto aepmrnitteerof the  
City of Lond ;n, that the practice of im­  
pressment of seamen&#x27; was legal ; but  
the committee answered, him respect­  
fully, but firmly, though in the presence  
F the Kinp: in council &quot; AVe acknow­  
leilge the high authority of your Lord  
  
ship&#x27;s opinion, but we must declare that  
w.&#x27; are of a very different opinion ;&quot; and  
their answer appeared to be applauded  
by the nation. Press-ftangs are conti  
nually opposed and resisted at sta by the  
sailors, whenever they have the means  
or the least hope of escaping. Navy of  
ficers and m n ar sometimes killed, and  
w  
here is no inquisition for their blood  
little noise as possible is made about  
it. It is known to be justifiable homi  
cide to take the life of an assis tant in tht  
necessary del&#x27; nee of a man&#x27;s liberty.  
There is no jury in England who would  
find a verdict of murder or man slaugh  
tc r against any sailor, on land or at sea,  
who should kill any one of a press gang,  
in the necessary defence of his liberty  
from impressment. Press-gangs on  
shore are often resisted by the people,  
fired on, some of them wounded, some  
times killed- Yet no inquisition is made  
for this. The practice is held, in ab  
norrenrt by tne men 01 war s men  
thrmselvrs. The boatswain of th  
Rose frigate, after the acquittal of the  
tour Iribh sailors who were prosecuted  
in a speci i Court of Admiralty at Bos­  
ton, for killing a gullant and amiable of  
ficer, L,eiutenant Panton, said, &#x27;&#x27;This is  
a kind of work in which I have been  
almost constantly engaged, for twenty  
years, i. e. in fighting with honest sail  
ors fir their liberty ; I have always sus  
ner.ttd th.it T mioht in be hano-d fur it.  
J&quot; r  
,uded to lhis Cscf&quot;it may not be amiss  
to recollect some other circumstances  
of it.  
A press-gang from the Rose, com­  
mand., d by Lieu.. Panton, with a mid­  
shipman and a number of ordinary sea­  
men, visited and searched a merchant­  
ship from Marble head, belonging to a  
Mr. Hooper, at sea. The Lieutenant  
enquired it here were any Lnglish, I­  
rish or Scotchmen on board ? Not sa­  
tisfied wih the answer he received, he  
prepared to search the ship from stem  
to stern. At last he found four Irish  
men, retired and concealed in the fore­  
peak With swords and pistols, he im­  
mediately laid siege to the enclosure Sc  
summoned the men to surrender. Cor­  
bett, who had the cool intrepidity of a  
Nelson, reasoned, remonstrated and laid  
down the law, with the. precision of a  
Mansfi . Id. l I know who you are. You  
are ilie Lieutenant of a roan of war,  
come with a press-gang to deprive me  
of my liberty. ou have no right to  
impress -me. I . have retreated from  
you as far as T can I can go no far­  
ther. I and my companions are detvr­  
nrned to stand upon our defence­  
Stand off.&quot; The sailors within and  
:,i , , .  
Wlln0Ult ployed their usual language  
to each other, and a midshipman, in the  
confusion,  
fired a pistol into the fore-  
peake and broke

who stood at the en-

He repeated what he had before said Sc  
drawing a line with a harpoon in the  
salt, with which the ship was loaded,  
saidu You are determined to deprive  
me of my liberty, and I am determined  
to defend it. If you step over tnat  
line, I shall consider it as a proof that  
you are determined to impreNS&#x27; roe, and  
by the eternal God of Heaven, fou are a  
dead man.&quot; Aye, my lad,&quot; said the  
Lieutenant,&quot; I have seen many a bravt  
fellow before noyr.&quot; Taking his snuff  
box out of his pocket ndt king a pinch  
of snuff, he very deliberately stepped  
over the line and attempted to seizt  
Corbett. The latter, drawing back Jbis

tain, commanding his naval officers to  
practise such impressments on board,  
not the vessels of his ownsubjects, but  
of the TJ States, a foreign nation, could  
not. furnish the slightest ground for an  
embargo 1 It is not necessary for me  
o say, that anyj thing could furnish a  
sufficient cround I for an embargo, for  
any long time ; this I leave to the re  
sponsibility of oar President, Senators  
and Representatives in Congress. But,  
say. with confidence, that it furnished  
a sufficient ground for a declaration of  
war. Not the murder ot Pierce, nor  
11 the murders oa board the Chesa  
peake, nor all the other injuries and in-  
ulls we luve received from foreign na  
tions, atrocious as they have been, can  
be of such dangerous,&#x27; lasting and per  
nicious consequence to this country, as  
this proclamation, if we had servility&#x27;&quot;e.  
enough to submit to it. ;&#x27;A  
What would the author of my tet  
have advised ? Would he counsel (the  
Piesicltnt to stipulate in a treaty with  
lireat Britain, that his navy officers  
should have a right to visit all Ameri­  
can merchant ships, and impress from  
them all English, Scotch and Irish sea­  
men ? Will he be so good as to ex  
plain the distinction between-ships of  
war and merchant ships r Are not  
merchant ships j under the jurisdicti  
on and entitled to the protection of the  
laws of their country, on the high seas,  
as much as ships of war I, Is not a  
merchant ship as much the territory of  
the United States as a ship of war ?  
Would the author of my text advice the  
President and Cbngrtss to acquiesce,  
in silence, under this proclamation,  
and permit it to be executed forever  
hereafter? Would not such a tame  
and silent acquiescence&#x27; as effectually  
yield the point and establish the prac  
tice, if not the &amp;&amp;,, as anexpress sti-  
puiation to a solemn . xieaty. i ii tne  
United States hadms-poweiTul navy j  
as Great-Britain,&#x27; and Great-Britain as  
feeble a force at sea as ours, would he  
advise the President either to concede  
he principle by treaty or acquiesce in  
t by silence ? Ikres the circumstance  
of great power or; great weakness make  
any alteration in the principle or the  
right ? Should, the captain or crew of  
an American merchantman resist a  
British press-gang on the high seas Sc,&#x27;  
in defence of their liberty, kilf the com  
mander and all under him,, and then  
make their escape and after returning  
to Salem be prosecuted, would the wri  
er of mv text, a a judge ora jurorr  
give his j&#x27;ldgemeut for finding them,  
guihy of murder or piracy ?Althonglv  
the embargo was made the watch-word  
of ouf late electioftrs, the votesvt in our  
great. nurseries of seamen, for .example  
m Salem, in Marblehead, in Barnstable  
Sandwich and j other places on Cape  
Cod, in Nantucket and the Vineyard and,  
other places, seemed to shew that our  
seamen preferred to .bfmfozrgoed, t&amp;  
than to1 go to sea .to be impressed.  
No doubt, it will bu said that we hart  
L nothing1. to do&#x27;with therquestion in Eit?l  
giana, concerning jne jegaiuy or illegal­  
ity of impressments. This, as long as;

isC? however, eusy to predict that the

considerations, it cras, . have no  
trcigHt in the estimation of the Bri-1  
tih Ministry ATheir hearts are not  
taught to feel another s woe. But all  
these things the Captain Und owner of  
sn American merchant ship must take  
Into consideration, and make them  
he suhject of calculation, before they  
can venturt to uexIo short, there  
ehoold be a corporation, erected in  
each of the States, -for the-express

ors&#x27;can never be safe.  
The law must be settled, or remain  
unsettled. If och impressments are  
determined to be legal, either by trea­  
ty or by acquiescence in the King&#x27;s

tniads of British s amen a pride of  
superiority and spirit of .domination,  
&#x27;Bsd in the minds of American sea  
znen a coosciousnrs o! inferiority and  
m senrile spirit of submission, which  
ftges would not eradicato. If the

however, will seldom or never be

for independence, or think of a navy

w I  
any rank in the world, but bow our  
necks again to the yoke of Great  
Britain.  
Ir the Spirit of a man should re-  
I m tin in our sailors, they xvi&#x27;l some  
times resist. Should a British cut­  
ter demand to se irch an American  
crchant ship, of five hun ircd ron­  
&#x27;uirthen, arand as thev-sometimt.-re  
and have a right to be i t  
commander of the cutter ca!ls :or .  
muster of the &quot;men, in o.-drr to impress  
such ashe, in his wisdom, shall  
jude to be -British s-u&#x27;ijects. Is  
redible that &#x27;the captain and t rew o  
the merchantmen will submit to thi  
usage. Wo, he will s:ok the boat and  
cutter too, rather than be so insulted,  
and &#x27;every American must applauc  
him for his spirit.  
is this right of impressment to be  
cal oa one ide, or is it to be rccipro  
al I British modesty may say ; 44 It i  
n exclusive privilege, because it i  
necessary to support ourdomipion of  
the seas, which is necessary to pre­  
serve a balance of power, in Europe,  
against France, and to prevent the  
French Emperor from sending fifty  
thousand men to conquer the United  
States ol America.,v All this will  
not convince American seamen.-  
They wiill answer ; We think a ba­  
lance of power on the ocean as neces­  
sary as on the. continent of Europe.  
We thank you for your civility in  
kindly giving us hopes, that you will  
defend us from the Frenc h army of  
fifty thousand men, but we are very  
willing to take our defence upon our­  
selves. If you have a right to im­  
press seamen from our ships, we  
nave an equal right to impress from  
yours.  
Should one of our gun -boats meet  
a British East-Indiaman, armed wi.h  
fifty guns ; th- gun-boat demands a  
seanh for American seamen ; call  
for the muster roll, commands th­  
men to pass in r view before him ;  
w-mld the East-India Captain su -mit?  
No. He would sooner throw over­  
board the press-gang, and run down  
the gun Jxat Such will br the per

times imputable to compilers of the  
laws of nations but hone ofJthem e-  
ver went to such extravagance as this.  
No claim of pretension of any right  
to search foreign vessels for seamen,  
ever existed before our revolution ;  
and no exercise of such a right ever  
prevailed since, except such as resem­  
ble the exercise of the right of com­  
mitting robbery, bnrglary and mur­  
der in some of our cities. No ages  
have &#x27;passed since our revolution.  
The rightwas never asserted or claim­  
ed, ti t the late proclamation of the  
King appeared, and that proclamation  
will make an epocn ot disgrace ana  
disaster to one nation or. the tother,  
perhaps to both.  
From the peace of 1783 to the  
commencement of pur government,  
under the present national constitu  
tion, whenever any American seamen  
were impressed, they were immedi­  
ately demanded in the name of the old  
Congress, and immediately dischar­  
ged, without ever pretending to such  
right of impressment. puring the  
administration of Washington, when­  
ever infoi maticm was received ol any  
impressment, Immediate orders were  
sent to demand tne men, and the men  
were promised to be liberated. Wash- i  
ington sent Captain Talbot to the W.  
Indies, as an agent to demand sea­  
new impressed on board British men  
f War. Talbot demanded them of  
ne British commanders, Captains  
md Admirals and was refused. He  
went then On shore, and demanded  
.md obtained of the Chief Justice of  
the Island, writs of habeas corpus, by  
virtue of wh&#x27;ch the impressed seamen  
ere brought from the king&#x27;s ships,  
tnd set at liberty bv l.iw the comman­  
lers not daring to disobey the king&#x27;s  
writ. Daring the administration o&#x27;  
Adams, the Secretary of State&#x27;s of­  
fice can hhew that demands were  
mad, and the success of them. The  
remonstrances that were made in  
consequence of positive instructions,  
and the memorials presented at court  
by our minister, were conceived in  
terms as strong as the English lan  
guage could furnish, without violating  
that respect : and decorum whi;h  
ought always to be preserved between  
nations and governments, even in de­  
clarations of war. The practice was  
asserted to be not oy incompatible  
with every principle of justice and e­  
very feeling of humanity, but whollv  
irrcconcileable with all thoughts of a  
continuance of peace and friendship  
between the two nntions.rf The effeci  
of the memorial was, an immediate  
order to the commanders of the navy  
to liberate the demanded men. I  
shall say n thing of Mr. JcfFerson  
administration, because the negotia­  
tions already made public, suffi:imdv  
show, tnat he ha norbecn behind ei­  
ther of his predecessors in his zeal for  
the liberty ol American seamen. Du  
rinc all this time excuses and apolo  
gies were made and necessity was

ted and laid down the law with the  
precision of a Mansfield-“ 1 know  
who you are. You are the lieutenant  
of a man of war, come \vi»h a press­

have retreated from you as lar as I  
can ; 1 can go no farther. I and my  
cumpa « oos are determined to stand in

within and without employed their tu  
su d language at each other, and a  
&#x27; midshipman, in the confusion fired a  
pistol into the forepeak and broke an  
ar n of oue of the four. Corbett, who  
itood at tne entranc j was engaged in  
a contest of menaces and defuncts  
with the lieutenant.  
I lie repeated what he had before “aid,  
nnd marking a line with a harpoon in  
the salt, *ith which the ship was load­

prive me of my&#x27;liber^ and I am de­  
termined to defend it. II you step o­

proof that you are determined to im­

Jitaven, you are a dead man.” “ Ave

reen many a brave fellow,before now.”

liberately stepped over the line add  
attempted to seize Corbett. Tne lat­

hi.s harpoon with ad his torse, cut the

I lid the Lieutenant dead at h:s feet.  
The Hose sent a reinforce orient to the  
press-gang ; broke down the bulk head,  
and seized the four irishmen, and  
  
I rought them to trial lor piracy au«i

The court consisted of governor

commodore liuod hitnvelf, who then  
commanded all the ships ol war on the

trial, the President, governor Bernard,  
pronounced the judgment of the court  
that the aci of prisoners was justifiable  
homicide, and in this opinion the  
whole court was tin nitnous. The  
sailor who was wounded in the arm,  
brought an action against the midship*
