00 The commissioners of the U. States authorized to settle the terms of a compromise with the State of Georgia, are further authorized to enquire into the claims which are or shall be made by settlers or any other persons whatever, to any part of the lands in question, and to receive from the claimants propositions of compromise and lay a full statement of the claims and propositions, together with the opinion of the commissioners thereon, before congress for their decision.  
Of the claims to be made, a part is defined and recognized in the 2d. article of the agreement, under the kind of grants legally executed to actual settlers within the territory ceded to the U. States prior to the 27. octr. 1795. by the former British Government of West Florida, or by the Government of Spain, and under the head of claims derived from any actual survey or settlement made under the law of Georgia passed February 7. 1785. entitled “An Act for laying out a district situate on the river Mississippi, and within the bounds of the State into a county to be called Bourbon.” An extract from this Act is also herewith inclosed.  
To enable the commissioners to make the proper report to Congress on this part of the subject, you are requested to furnish them with the best information you can obtain, first with respect to the extent of territory both on the Mississippi and the Mobille, which has been relinquished by the Indians, secondly with respect to the claims recognized by the 2d. Article of the agreement with Georgia. To make this last information as accurate and full as possible, it may be well to invite the claimants by public advertisement to file prior to the 1st. of November before the proper County officers, the particular authority and extent of their respective claims and the chain of title derived to the present claimants from the original title. The Commissioners hope that you will be able to state to them particularly the manner in which grants were made and compleated under b

Fourthly claims derived under the Spanish Government by grants made subsequent to the Spanish Treaty of 1795. fifthly claims founded on the 3d. section of the Bourbon County act of Georgia, the four last descriptions of claimants may also be publickly invited to give in the state of their respective claims, by the 1st. of November that they may be transmitted by you in due time with the others. It is proper that the claimants in their cases should be aware, that their claims not being included in the guaranty of the 2d. article of the compromise with Georgia, the consideration of them by Congress will be barred by the 3d. article, after the period of one year from the assent of Georgia to the instrument of compromise.
