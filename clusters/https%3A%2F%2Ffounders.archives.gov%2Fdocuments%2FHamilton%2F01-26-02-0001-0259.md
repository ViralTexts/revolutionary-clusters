[New York, July 9, 1804]  
  
In the Name of God Amen! I Alexander Hamilton of the City of New York Counsellor at Law do make this my last Will and Testament as follows. First I appoint John B Church Nicholas Fish and Nathaniel Pendleton of the City aforesaid Esquires to be Executors and Trustees of this my Will and I devise to them their heirs and Assigns, as joint Tenants and not as Tenants in common, All my Estate real and personal whatsoever and wheresoever upon Trust at their discretion to sell and dispose of the same, at such time and times in such manner and upon such terms as they the Survivors and Survivor shall think fit and out of the proceeds to pay all the Debts which I shall owe at the time of my decease, in whole, if the fund shall be sufficient, proportionally, if it shall be insufficient, and the residue, if any there shall be to pay and deliver to my excellent and dear Wife Elizabeth Hamilton.  
Though if it shall please God to spare my life I may look for a considerable surplus out of my present property—Yet if he should speedily call me to the eternal wor[l]d, a forced sale as is usual may possibly render it insufficient to satisfy my Debts. I pray God that something may remain for the maintenance and education of my dear Wife and Children. But should it on the contrary happen that there is not enough for the payment of my Debts, I entreat my Dear Children, if they or any of them shall ever be able, to make up the Deficiency. I without hesitation commit to their delicacy a wish which is dictated by my own. Though conscious that I have too far sacrificed the interests of my family to public avocations &amp; on this account have the less claim to burthen my Children, yet I trust in their magnanimity to appreciate as they ought this my request. In so unfavourable an event of things, the support of their dear Mother with the most respectful and tender attention is a duty all the sacredness of which they will feel. Probably her own patrimonial resources will preserve her from Indigence. But in all situations they are charged to bear in mind that she has been to them the most devoted and best of mothers. In Testimony whereof I have hereunto subscribed my hand the Ninth day of July in the year of our lord One thousand Eight hundred &amp; four.  
  
  
  
  
Signed sealed published &amp; declared as and for his last Will and Testament in our presence who have subscribed the same in his presence.

Two days before his death General Hamilton  
made the following will:  
In the name of God, Amen, I, Alexander Hamilton, of  
the city of New York, counsellor at law, do make this  
my last will and testament, as follows:  
First. I appeint John B. Church, Nicholas Fish, and  
Nathaniel Pendleton, of the city aforesaid, Esquires, to  
be exeeutors and trustees of this my will, and I devise to  
them, their heirs and assigns, as joint tenants and not  
as tenants in common, all my estate real and personal  
whatsoever, and wheresoever, upon trust at their discre.­  
tion, to sell and dispose of the same, at such time and  
times, in such manner, and upon such terms as the sur-­  
vivors and survivor shall think fit, and out of the pro-­  
ceeds to pay all the debts which I shall owe at the time  
of my decease; in whole, if the fund be sufficient; pros­  
portionably if it shall be insufficient, and the residue, if  
any there shall be, to pay and deliver to my excellent  
and dear wife Elizabeth Hamilton. Though if it should  
please God to spare my life, I may look for a con-­  
siderable surplus out of my present property; yet,  
if he should speedily calf me to the eternal  
world, a forced sale, as is usual, may possibly  
render it insufficient to satisfy my debts. I pray God  
that something may remain for the maintenance and  
education of my dear wife and children. But should it  
on the contrary happes, that there is not enough for  
the payment of my debts, I entreat my dear children, if  
they, or any of them, should ever be able, to make up.  
the deficiency. I without hesitation commit to their de­  
licacy a wish which is dictated by my own. Though  
conscious that I have too far sacrified the interests of my  
family to public vocations, and on this account have  
the less claim to burthen my children, yet I trust to their  
magnanimity to appreciate as they ought, this my re-­  
quest. In so favorable an event of things, the support  
of their dear mother with the most respectful and tender  
attention, is a duty, all the sacredness of which they will  
feel. Frobably her own patrimonial resources will pre­  
serve her from indigence. But in all situations they are
