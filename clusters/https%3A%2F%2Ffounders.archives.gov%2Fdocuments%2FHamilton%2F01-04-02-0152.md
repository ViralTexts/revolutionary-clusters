]  
To the People of the State of New York.  
After an unequivocal experience of the inefficacy of the subsisting Fœderal Government, you are called upon to deliberate on a new Constitution for the United States of America. The subject speaks its own importance; comprehending in its consequences, nothing less than the existence of the UNION, the safety and welfare of the parts of which it is composed, the fate of an empire, in many respects, the most interesting the world. It has been frequently remarked, that it seems to have been reserved to the people of this country, by their conduct and example, to decide the important question, whether societies of men are really capable or not, of establishing good government from ref[l]ection and choice, or whether they are forever destined to depend, for their political constitutions, on accident and force. If there be any truth in the remark, the crisis, at which we are arrived, may with propriety be regarded as the æra in which that decision is to be made; and a wrong election of the part we shall act, may, in this view, deserve to be considered as the general misfortune of mankind.  
This idea will add the inducements of philanthropy to those of patriotism to heighten the sollicitude, which all considerate and good men must feel for the event. Happy will it be if our choice should be directed by a judicous estimate of our true interests, unperplexed and unbiassed by considerations not connected with the public good. But this is a thing more ardently to be wished, than seriously to be expected. The plan offered to our deliberations, affects too many particular interests, innovates upon too many local institutions, not to involve in its discussion a variety of objects foreign to its merits, and of views, passions and prejudices little favourable to the discovery of truth.  
Among the most formidable of the obstacles which the new Constitution will have to encounter, may readily be distinguished the obvious interest of a certain class of men in every State to resist all changes which may hazard a diminution of the power, emolument and consequence of the offices they hold under the State-establishments—and the perverted ambition of another class of men, who will either hope to aggrandise themselves by the confusions of their country, or will flatter themselves with fairer prospects of elevation from the subdivision of the empire into several partial confederacies, than from its union under one government.  
It is not, however, my design to dwell upon observations of this nature. I am well aware that it would be disingenuous to resolve indiscriminately the opposition of any set of men (merely because their situations might subject them to suspicion) into interested or ambitious views: Candour will oblige us to admit, that even such men may be actuated by upright intentions; and it cannot be doubted, that much of the opposition which has made its appearance, or may hereafter make its appearance, will spring from sources, blameless at least, if not respectable, the honest errors of minds led astray by preconceived jealousies and fears. So numerous indeed and so powerful are the causes, which serve to give a false bias to the judgment, that we upon many occasions, see wise and good men on the wrong as well as on the right side of questions, of the first magnitude to society. This circumstance, if duly attended to, would furnish a lesson of moderation of those, who are ever so much persuaded of their being in the right, in any controversy. And a further reason for caution, in this respect, might be drawn from the reflection, that we are not always sure, that those who advocate the truth are influenced by purer principles than their antagonists. Ambition, avarice, personal animosity, party opposition, and many other motives, not more laudable than these, are apt to operate as well upon those who support as upon those who oppose the right side of a question. Were there not even these inducements to moderation, nothing could be more illjudged than that intolerant spirit, which has, at all times, characterised political parties. For, in politics as in religion, it is equally absurd to aim at making proselytes by fire and sword. Heresies in either can rarely be cured by persecution.  
And yet however just these sentiments will be allowed to be, we have already sufficient indications, that it will happen in this as in all former cases of great national discussion. A torrent of angry and malignant passions will be let loose. To judge from the conduct of the opposite parties, we shall be led to conclude, that they will mutually hope to evince the justness of their opinions, and to increase the number of their converts by the loudness of their declamations, and by the bitterness of their invectives. An enlightened zeal for the energy and efficiency of government will be stigmatised, as the off-spring of a temper fond of despotic power and hostile to the principles of liberty. An overscrupulous jealousy of danger to the rights of the people, which is more commonly the fault of the head than of the heart, will be represented as mere pretence and artifice; the bait for popularity at the expence of public good. It will be forgotten, on the one hand, that jealousy is the usual concomitant of violent love, and that the noble enthusiasm of liberty is too apt to be infected with a spirit of narrow and illiberal distrust. On the other hand, it will be equally forgotten, that the vigour of government is essential to the security of liberty; that, in the contemplation of a sound and well informed judgment, their interest can never be separated; and that a dangerous ambition more often lurks behind the specious mask of zeal for the rights of the people, than under the forbidding appearance of zeal for the firmness and efficiency of government. History will teach us, that the former has been found a much more certain road to the introduction of despotism, than the latter, and that of those men who have overturned the liberties of republics the greatest number have begun their carreer, by paying an obsequious court to the people, commencing Demagogues and ending Tyrants.  
In the course of the preceeding observations I have had an eye, my Fellow Citizens, to putting you upon your guard against all attempts, from whatever quarter, to influence your decision in a matter of the utmost moment to your welfare by any impressions other than those which may result from the evidence of truth. You will, no doubt, at the same time, have collected from the general scope of them that they proceed from a source not unfriendly to the new Constitution. Yes, my Countrymen, I own to you, that, after having given it an attentive consideration, I am clearly of opinion, it is your interest to adopt it. I am convinced, that this is the safest course for your liberty, your dignity, and your happiness. I effect not reserves, which I do not feel. I will not amuse you with an appearance of deliberation, when I have decided. I frankly acknowledge to you my convictions, and I will freely lay before you the reasons on which they are founded. The consciousness of good intentions disdains ambiguity. I shall not however multiply professions on this head. My motives must remain in the depository of my own breast: My arguments will be open to all, and may be judged of by all. They shall at least be offered in a spirit, which will not disgrace the cause of truth.  
I propose in a series of papers to discuss the following interesting particulars—The utility of the UNION to your political prosperity—The insufficiency of the present Confederation to preserve that Union—The necessity of a government at least equally energetic with the one proposed to the attainment of this object—The conformity of the proposed constitution to the true principles of republican government—Its analogy to your own state constitution—and lastly, The additional security, which its adoption will afford to the preservation of that species of government, to liberty and to property.  
In the progress of this discussion I shall endeavour to give a satisfactory answer to all the objections which shall have made their appearance that may seem to have any claim to your attention.  
It may perhaps be thought superfluous to offer arguments to prove the utility of the UNION, a point, no doubt, deeply engraved on the hearts of the great body of the people in every state, and one, which it may be imagined has no adversaries. But the fact is, that we already hear it whispered in the private circles of those who oppose the new constitution, that the Thirteen States are of too great extent for any general system, and that we must of necessity resort to separate confederacies of distinct portions of the whole.  
  
The same idea, tracing the arguments to their consequences, is held out in several of the late publications against the New Constitution.  
  
This doctrine will, in all probability, be gradually propagated, till it has votaries enough to countenance an open avowal of it. For nothing can be more evident, to those who are able to take an enlarged view of the subject than the alternative of an adoption of the new Constitution, or a dismemberment of the Union. It will therefore be of use to begin by examining the advantages of that Union, the certain evils and the probable dangers, to which every State will be exposed from its dissolution. This shall accordingly constitute the subject of my next address.

To the people of the fate of New York,  
Pd tno an unequivocal experi-  
  
ence of the ineflicacy of the  
fublifting federal government, you  
are called upon to deliberate on a  
new conititution for the united flates  
of America. Fhe fubject fpeaks its  
own importance ; comprehending 10  
its o@nfequences, nothing lefs than  
the exiftence of the union, the fafety  
and welfare of the parts of which it  
fs compofed, the fate of an ot in  
many refpeéts, the moft interefting® im  
the world. It has been frequently re-  
marked, that it feems to have been  
referved to the ople of this country,  
by their conduct and example, to de-  
cide the important queflion, whether  
facieties of men are really-capable or  
not, of eftablifhing good government  
from reflexion and. choice, or whether  
  
they are for ever deftined to depend,  
for their poktical conftitutions, on  
accident and foree, If there be any  
truth in the: remark, the crifis, at  
  
which we are arrived, may with  
priety be regarded as the era. in  
which that decifion is to be made;  
and a wrong eleftion of the part we  
fhall at, may, in this view, deferve  
to be confidered as the general misfor-  
tune of mankind,  
  
This idea will add the inducements  
of philanthropy to thofe of: patriot-  
iff, to heighten the folicitude, which  
all confiderate and good men mult  
feel for the event. Happy will it  
be if our choice fhould be-direfied by  
a judicious eftimate of our true in-  
terefls, unperplexed. and unbiafled  
by confiderations not conneéted with  
the public good. But this is a thing  
more ardently to be wifhed, than fe-  
rioully to be expefted. The plan  
offered to our deliberations, affeés  
too many particular interefts, inno-  
vates upon too many local inftitu-  
tions, not to involve in its difcuf-  
fion a variety of objefs foreign

@ its merits, and of views, palfions

and prejudices little favourable to the  
difcovery of truth.  
  
Among the moft formidable of the  
obftacles which the new conflitution  
will have to encounter, may readily  
be diltinguifhed the obvious interelt  
ofa certain chfs of men in every  
ftate, to refift ai! changes which may  
hazard’ a diminution of the power,  
emotument, and confequence of the  
offices they huld under the ftate efla-  
blifhments; and the perverted ams  
bition of another clafs of men, who  
will either, hope to aggrandize them-  
felves by the confufions of their  
country, or will flauer themfelves  
with fairer profpefls of elevation  
from the fubdiviffon of the empire  
into feveral partial confederacies,  
than from its. union under one go-  
vernment,  
  
It is not; however, my defign. ta  
dweli upon obfervations of this na~=  
ture. I am weil aware that it would  
be: difingenuous to refolve indifcri-  
minately the oppofition of any fee  
of ‘men (merely becaufe their fituati-  
ons might fubjeét them to fufpicion)  
into interefled or ambitious views.  
Candour would oblige us to admit, that  
even. fuch men may be attuated by  
upright intentions ;.and it cannot be  
doubted, that much of the oppofition  
which has made its appearance, or  
may hereafter make its appearances  
will fpring from fources, blamelefs  
at lealt, if. not refpeGable---the ho-  
neft errors of minds led aftray by  
preconceived jealoufies and fears. So  
numerous, indeed, and fo powerful are  
the caufes which ferve to give a falfe  
bias to the judgment, that we upon  
many occafions, fee wife and good  
men on the wrong as well as on the  
right frde of queftions of the firlt  
magnitude to fociety. This circum-  
flance, if duly attended to, would  
fornfh a teflon of moderation to  
thofe who are ever fo much perfuaded  
of their being in the right in any  
controverfy, And a further reafon  
i in this refpeét, might be  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
a4e  
drawn from the reflexion. that we  
are not always fure that ghole who  
advocate the truth are influenced by  
purer principles than their antago-  
pills. Ambition, avarice, perfonal  
animofity, party oppofiiion, an  
many other motives, not more lauda-  
ble than thefe, are apt to operate as  
well upon thofe who fupport, as upon  
ihofe who oppofe, the right fide of  
a queftion, Were there not even  
thefe inducements to moderation,  
nothing could be more ill-judged than  
that intolerant fpirit which has, at  
all times, chara€ierifed political par-  
ties. Fox, in politics as in’ religion,  
it i$ equally abfurd to aim at mak-  
ing profelytes by fire and fword.  
Hake: in either can rarely be cured  
by perfecution.  
And yet, however jufl thefe fenti-  
ments will be allowed to be, we have  
already fufficient indications, that at  
will happen in this as in all former  
cafes of great national difcufhon.,.A  
torrent of angry and malignant palli-  
ons will be let loofe, To judge from  
the conduct of the oppolue parties,  
we fhall be led to conclude, that they  
will mutually hope to evince she ju -  
nefs of their opinions, and to increafe  
the number of theic converts by the  
loudnef{s of their declamations, and  
by the bitternefs of their invettives.  
An enlightened zeal for the energy  
and efficiency of pasting Be 4  
fligmatized as the offspring of a tem-

tile to the principles of liberty. An  
over: {crupulous jealoufy of danger to  
the rights of the people, which 1s  
more commonly the fauir of the head  
than of the heart, will be reprefent-  
ed as mete pretence and artihce—  
the flale bait for popularity at the ex-  
enfe of public good, It will be  
de Rasy on the ‘one hand, that  
gealoufy is the ufual concomitant of  
violent love, andihat the noble en-  
thufiafm of liberty is too apt to be  
infeed with a {pirit of narrow and

it willbe equally forgotten, that the  
gone government is effential to  
  
Peurity of liberty ; that, in the  
conféimplation of a found and well-  
informed judgment, their intereft can  
never be icparated ; and that a dan-  
gerous ambition more often lurks  
behind the fpecious mafk of zeal for  
the rights of the people, than under  
the forbidding appearances of zeal  
or thé firmne(s and efficiency of go-  
vernment, Hiflory. will teach us,  
that the former has. been found a  
much more certain road to the in-  
troduftion of defpotifm than the lat-

the greatelt number have begun their

@rous execution, that such vigor is ‘essential to the security  
of liberty,’ and that, ‘in the contemplation of a sound and  
well-informed mind, their interests can never be separated.

the offspring of a temper fond of power and hostile to the principles of  
liberty. An over-scrupulous jealousy of danger to the rights of the  
people, which is more commonly the fault of the head than the heart,  
will be represented as mere pretence and artifice, — the stale bait for  
popularity at the expense of public good. It will be forgotten, on the  
one hand, that jealousy is the usual concomitant of violent love, and  
that the noble enthusiasm of liberty is too apt to be inflated with a  
spirit of narrow and illiberal distrust. On the other hand, it will be  
equally forgotten that the vigor of government is essential to the secu-  
rity of liberty; that, in the contemplation of a sound and well-informed  
judgment, their interests can never be separated; and that a dangerous  
ambition more often lurks behind the specious mask of zeal for the  
rights of the people, than under the forbidding appearance of zeal for  
the firmness and efficiency of government.”

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
  
&quot;I propose, in a series of papers, to discuss the  
following interesting particulars:—The utility  
of the UNION to your political prosperity ; the  
insufficiency of the present confederation to pre­  
serve the Union ; the necessity of a governmenl at  
least equally energetic with the one proposed to  
the attainment of this object; the conformity of  
the proposed Constitution to the true principles  
of republican government; its analogy to your  
own State Constitution, and lastly, the addition  
al security which its adoption will afford to the  
preservation of that species of government, to lib­  
erty and to property.  
&quot;In the progress of this discussion I shall en­  
deavor to give a satisfactory answer to all the  
objections which shall have made their appear­  
ance, that may seem to have any claim to atten­  
tion.  
&#x27;&#x27;It may perhaps be thought surpeifluous to  
offer arguments to prove the utility of the  
UNION, a point, po doubt, deeply engraved on  
the hearts of the great body of the people in ev­  
ery State, and one which, it may be imagined,  
has no adversaries.  
&quot;But the fact is, that we already hear it whis­  
pered in thp private circles ot those who oppose  
the new Constitution, that tbe Thirteen States  
are of too great extent for any general system,  
and that we must, of necessity, re.ort to separate  
confederacies of distinct portions of the whole.  
This dc-Jrine will, in all probability, be gradual  
ly propagated, till \t has votaries enough to  
countenance its open avowal. j_or nothing can  
be more evident, to those who are able to take  
an enlarged view of the subject, than the alter­  
native of an adoption qf the Constitution or a  
dismemberment qf the Union. It may, therefore,  
be et;_. tial to ex_mine particularly the advan­  
tages of that Union, the certain evils, and the  
probable dangers to which c.. ry State will be  
exposed from its dissolution,  
&quot;This shall accordingly be done.&quot;  
From the above extract it will be seen that the  
chief object had in view was to preserve the  
Union, and that the great defect of the Confede­  
racy consisted in its inability to preserve it. It  
will be observed that the advocacy of a &quot;resort  
to separate Confederacies&#x27;&#x27; was at that time  
&quot;whispered in private circles of those who were  
opposed to the adoption of the Constitution.&quot;—  
It is now nnblushingly proclaimed by many in  
this section of our country, e?en in the heart of  
this State, which is proverbial for its patriotism  
and conservatism, thus verifying the prediction  
of the essay from which we quote, that &quot;that  
doctrine would, in all probability, be gradually  
propagated, till it had votaries enough to coun­  
tenance its open avowal.&quot; It wijl be observed  
that the above extract shows that they were re ■  
duced to the alternative oi the adoption of the  
Constitution or a dismemberment of the Union,  
la the second essay of the series written by  
Judge Jay the following language is used, which,  
it will be observed, is as applicable to the presen

constitution, and reviewing the probable  
obstacles to be encountered, remarks  
(page 9) :— &#x27; It will be equally  
forgotten that the rigour of Government  
is essential to the security of liberty,  
that ia the contemplation of a &#x27;sound  
and well-informed judgment, their  
interests can never be separated, and  
that a dangerous ambition more often  
lurks behind the spacious mask of zeal  
for the rights of the people, than under  
the forbidding appearances of zeal for  
the firmness and efficiency of-  
Goyernmsnt. History will teach us that  
the former has been found a much more  
certain road to the introduction of  
despotism than the latter, and that of  
those men who have overturned the  
liberties of Republics, the greatest  
number have begun their career by paying  
an obsequious court to the people,
