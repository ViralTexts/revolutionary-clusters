d Dispensation can no longer benefit his People, a new order of Things shall take place.  
It is asserted, that &quot;the Sabbath was made for man,&quot; for his ease, convenience and rest; but when it becomes so debased as to be universally the most prophaned period of Time among Men, through the subtilty of the Serpent or Priestcraft, then the Promises are fulfilled &quot;in the Angels lifting up his hand to Heaven, and swearing by him that liveth for ages of ages, who created Heaven and the Things that therein are, and the Earth and the Things that therein are, and the Sea and the Things that are therein, that there should no longer be Time,[&quot;] Rev: 10.5.6. This is not, as some vainly imagine, a destruction of the Planet we now inhabit, but a destruction of the old order of Time. By Time is signified state, and because the church or old system is here treated of, a state of that church is signified; therefore, there shall no longer be Time, signifies that there will not be any state or remaining order of the old church.  
The noble French nation has been publicly fulminated by &quot;Pulpit Drum Ecclesiastic,&quot; for Theism; Be it so.  
  
In the last Dispensation promised, it is worthy of observation, that all worship and adoration is commanded to be given only unto God, &quot;for He only is Holy,[&quot;] Rev: 15.4. And the Lord God of the Prophets sent his Angel to shew unto his Servants the Things which must shortly be done. And I John saw these things, and heard them. And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel, which shewed me these Things. Then saith he unto me, see thou do it not: for I am thy Fellow Servant, and of thy Brethren the Prophets, and of them which keep the sayings of this Book, worship God! Rev: 22.6.8.9. This also is expressly commanded in the 19 chp: and unless we can prove that there are more gods than One, the French nation certainly are not antichristian for solely giving their supreme adoration to the one great eternal Being of boundless Love and immeasurable wisdom: who without Time is Eternal, and without place is Infinite; whose centre is everywhere, but whose circumference or Limits are no where.

The next act of the angel is very remarkable: “And the  
augel, which I saw stand upon the sea, and upon the land, lifted  
up his hand to heaven, and sware by him that liveth for ever  
and ever, who created heaven and the things that therein are,  
and the earth and the things that therein are, and the sea and  
the things which are therein, that there should be time no  
longer.” This solemn asseveration confirms the view, that this  
angel was not an impersonation of Christ, who is identified with  
him that liveth for and ever. When one swears it is usually by  
some one superior to himself, in allusion to which custom St.  
Paul says of the Deity, that, seeing he could swear by no greater,  
he sware by himself. Hence it may be fairly inferred, that as  
this angel did not swear by himself, but by him that liveth for  
ever and ever, and that created all things, he was an inferior  
and created being, and not a personal manifestation of him who  
liveth for

sent his angel to shew unto his servants the things which must shortly  
be done.” Mr. Kelly, in common with many other interpreters of the  
Revelation, seems to forget that these words were written nearly two  
thousand years ago. Our author, as might be expected, adopts that  
view of the future relation of Israel to the Gentiles which we can  
scarcely help regarding as subversive of no small portion of the work  
of Christ. Explaining the words, “‘ The seven spirits which are before

and his appearance is described in chap. 1:

“Fear not,” &amp;c. v. 17. He saw heaven

Lamb, and numerous angels, who showed  
him things that were shortly to come to pass.

ous letter, refers to the passage in the Apoe-  
alypse of John, chap. 22, verses 8 and 9, to  
prove that angels are departed spirits. The  
passage in the common version is as follows:  
“And I John saw these things and heard  
them. And when I had heard and seen, | fell  
down to worship before the feet of the angel  
which showed me these things. Then saith  
he unto me, See thou do it not; for J am thy  
Fellow servant, and of thy brethren the proph-  
ets, and of them which keep the sayings of this  
book: worship God.” Unfortunately for our  
friend’s theory, all the evidence the above  
passage afford, sthat the angel who talked  
with John was a departed human spirit, is the  
  
  
  
result of a false translation of the original.
