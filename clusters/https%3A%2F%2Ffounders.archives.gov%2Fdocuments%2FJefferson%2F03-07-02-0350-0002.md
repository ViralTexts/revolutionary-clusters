t even this were a virtue compared to  
the enormity of England’s crimes.  
We  
will now consider the right of impressment, claimed &amp; exercised by England.  
This memorable controversy, about the right of search and of impressment, has  
undergone so many changes, that at present, it will require some nicety to  
explain, or even to understand it.  
At  
one time, it would seem, that England claimed the right of impressing  
neutral seamen, from on  
board of neutral ships.  
Her impressment of our seamen, will justify this presumption.  
At another time, the Prince regent comes  
forward, and tells us, in his official declaration, that “The impressment of  
British seamen, found on board of neutral merchant-ships, is no violation of a  
neutral flag

he other belligerant; and if any be found, to seize upon them.  
If then the citizens of a belligerant nation, can only enter the ships of a  
neutral state, for the purpose above mentioned; it results of course, that they  
have no right to enter them, for the purpose of taking out their own seamen, who  
may have deserted. The seas are defined to be the common highway of nations:  
And ships do certainly carry with them the rights of sovereignty, appertaining  
to the state to which they belong. How then can it be contended, that British  
officers had a right to enter our ships, and take out British seamen, when it is  
acknowledged on all hands, that no nation has a right to enter the  
territory of a neutral  
state, to exercise any authority whatever; much less that of seizing men, and  
carrying them away by force.  
And  
lastly, some of the British writers, acknowledge they have not the right of  
entering neutral ships, in order to impress British seamen: but they contend for  
the right of entering neutral, in search of articles contraband of war, and that  
when they are once there, they may then impress British seamen—Gross absurdity:  
You must not enter your neighbours house,
