who was come from Venango (in French, the Peninsula) with Sixty Battoes, and Three Hundred Canoes, and who having planted eighteen Pieces of Cannon against the Fort, afterwards had sent him a Summons to depart.  
  
Venango (now Franklin, Pa.) was at the junction of the Allegheny River and French Creek. “Peninsula” is a translation, not of Venango, but of Presque Isle (Erie, Pa.), on Lake Erie.  
  
Mr. Wart also informed me, that the Indians kept stedfastly  
  
attached to our Interest.  
  
Ward noted in his deposition the strong support given to his detachment by the Half-King, who had helped him to erect the fort. The chief “stormed greatly at the French at the Time they were oblieged to march out of the Fort and told them it was he Order’d that Fort and laid the first Log of it himself, but the French paid no Regard to what he said” (GISTWilliam M. Darlington, ed. Christopher Gist’s Journals with Historical, Geographical and Ethnological Notes and Biographies of his Contemporaries. Pittsburgh, 1893., 278).  
  
He brought two young Indian Men with him, who were Mingoes, that they might have the Satisfaction to see that we were marching with our Troops to their Succour. He also delivered me the following Speech, which the Half-King sent to me. Fort-Ohio, April 18th, 1754. A SPEECH from the Half-King, for the Governors of Virginia and Pennsylvania. MY Brethren the English. The Bearer will let you understand in what Manner the French have treated us. We waited a long Time, thinking they would come and attack us; we now see how they have a Mind to use us. We are now ready to fall upon them, waiting only for your Succour. Have good Courage, and come as soon as possible; you will find us as ready to encounter with them as you are yourselves. We have sent those two young Men to see if you are ready to come, and if so, they are to return to us, to let us know where you are, that we may come and join you. We should be glad, if the Troops belonging to the two Provinces could meet together at the Fort which is in the Way. If you do not come to our Assistance now, we are intirely undone, and imagine we shall never meet together again. I speak it with a Heart full of Grief. A Belt of Wampum. The Half-King directed to me the following Speech. I am ready, if you think it proper, to go to both the Governors, with these two young Men, for I have now no more Dependance on those who have been gone so long, without returning or sending any Message. A Belt of Wampum. April 23d. A COUNCIL of WAR held at Wills-Creek, in order to consult upon what must be done on Account of the News brought by Mr. Wart, The News brought by Ensign Wart, having been examined into, as also the Summons sent by Captain Contrecoeur, Commander of the French Troops, and the Speeches of the Half-King, and of  
  
  
  
the other Chiefs of the Six-Nations; it appears, that Mr. Wart, was forced to surrender the said Fort, the 17th of this Instant, to the French, who were above One Thousand strong, and had eighteen Artillery Pieces, some of which were nine Pounders, and also that the Detachment of the Virginia Regiment, amounting to One Hundred and Fifty Men, commanded by Colonel Washington had Orders to reinforce the Company of Captain Trent, and that the aforesaid Garrison consisted only of Thirty-three effective Men. It was thought a Thing impracticable to march towards the Fort without sufficient Strength; however, being strongly invited by the Indians, and particularly by the Speeches of the Half-King, the President gave his Opinion, that it would be proper to advance as far as Red-Stone-Creek, on Monaungahela, about Thirty-seven Miles on this Side of the Fort, and there to raise a Fortification, clearing a Road broad enough to pass with all our Artillery and our Baggage, and there to wait for fresh Orders. The Opinion aforesaid was resolved upon, for the following Reasons; 1st, That the Mouth of Red-Stone is the first convenient Place on the River Monaungahela. 2d, That Stores are already built at that Place for the Provisions of the Company, wherein our Ammunition may be laid up;  
  
The Ohio Company had erected a store on the right bank of Red Stone Creek (Brownsville, Pa.) in Jan. 1754.  
  
our great Guns may be also sent by Water whenever we should think it convenient to attack the Fort. 3d, We may easily (having all these Conveniences) preserve our People from the ill Consequences of Inaction, and encourage the Indians our Allies, to remain in our Interest. Whereupon, I sent Mr. Wart to the Governor, with one of the young Indians and an Interpreter: I thought it proper also to acquaint the Governors of Maryland and Pennsylvania of the News;

and I  
  
sent away the other Indian to the Half-King, with the Speeches inclosed in the following Letter. To the Honourable Robert Dinwiddie, Esq; Governor, &amp;c.  
  
For GW’s letter to Dinwiddie, dated 25 April 1754, see P.R.O., C.O.5/14, f. 191. It is entirely possible that a copy of the letter was not included in the original diary but was found among GW’s papers by the French after the capture of Fort Necessity.  
  
Sir, Mr. Wart, an Ensign of Captain Trent’s Company, is this Day come from Monaungahela, and has brought the sorrowful News of the Reduction of the Fort, on the 17th of this Instant; having been summoned by Captain Contrecoeur to surrender to a Body of French Troops who were a Thousand strong, who came from Venango, with eighteen Pieces of Cannon, sixty Battoes, and Three Hundred Canoes; they permitted all our Men to retire, and take with them their Working-Tools out of the Fort, which was done the same Day. Upon receiving this News, I called a Council of War, in order to consult what was best to be done in such Circumstances; and have sent you a particular Account of every Thing agreed upon at the said Council by the same Express, that you may know Things yet more particularly. Mr. Wart is the Bearer of the Summons, as also of the Speech from the Half-King, wherein I inclosed the Wampum; he is in Company with one of those Indians mentioned in the Speech, who had been sent to see our Forces, and to know what Time they might expect us; the other Indian, I have sent back with a Message. I hope you will find it necessary, to send us our Forces as soon as they are raised, as also a sufficient Number of Canoes, and other Boats with Decks; send us also some Mortar-Pieces, that we may be in a Condition to attack the French with equal Forces. And as we are informed that the Indians of the Six Nations, and the Outawas, are coming down Sciodo-Creek, in order to join the French who are to meet at the Ohio; so I think it would not be amiss to invite the Cherokees, Catawbas, and the Chickasaws to come to our Assistance; and as I have received Intelligence, that there is no good Understanding between them and the Indians of the Six Nations aforesaid, it would be well to perswade them to make a Peace with them; otherwise if they should meet at the Ohio, it might cause great Disorder, and turn out to our Disadvantage.

To his Excellency Horatio Sharpe, Governor of Maryland. Sir, I AM here arrived with a Detachment of One Hundred and Fifty Men: We daily expect Colonel Fry with the remaining Part of the Regiment and the Artillery; however, we shall march gently a-cross the Mountains, clearing the Roads as we go, that our Cannon may with the greater Ease be sent after us; we propose to go as far as Red-Stone River, which falls into Monaungahela, about Thirty-seven Miles this Side of the Fort which the French have taken, from thence all our heavy Luggage may be carried as far as the Ohio. A Store is built there by the Ohio Company, wherein may be placed our Ammunition and Provisions. Besides the French Forces above mentioned, we have Reason to  
  
believe, according to the Accounts we have heard, that another Party is coming to the Ohio; we have also learnt that Six Hundred of the Chippowais and Ollowais Indians, are coming down the River Sciodo, in order to join them. The following is my Answer to the Speech of the Half-King; “To the Half-King, and to the Chiefs and Warriors of the Shawanese and Loups our Friends and Brethren. I received your Speech by Brother Bucks,  
  
“Brother Bucks” was the Indian name of the trader George Croghan, Ens. Edward Ward’s half brother; however, it was Ward who brought the Half-King’s speech to GW in company with two young men of the Mingoes.  
  
who came to us with the two young Men six Days after their Departure from you. We return you our greatest Thanks, and our Hearts are fired with Love and Affection towards you, in Gratitude for your constant Attachment to us, as also your gracious Speech, and your wise Counsels. This young Man will inform you, where he found a small Part of our Army, making towards you, clearing the Roads for a great Number of our Warriors, who are ready to follow us, with our great Guns, our Ammunition and Provisions. As I delight in letting you know with speed the Thoughts of our Heart, I send you back this young Man, with this Speech, to acquaint you therewith, and the other young Man I have sent to the Governor of Virginia, to deliver him your Speech and your Wampum, and to be an Eye-witness of those Preparations we are making, to come in all Haste to the Assistance of those whose Interest is as dear to us as our Lives. We know the Character of the treacherous French, and our Conduct shall plainly shew you, how much we have it at Heart. I shall not be satisfied if I do not see you before all our Forces are met together at the Fort which is in the Way; wherefore, I desire, with the greatest Earnestness, that you, or at least one of you, would come as soon as possible to meet us on the Road, and to assist us in Council. I present you with these Bunches of Wampum, to assure you of the Sincerity of my Speech, and that you may remember how much I am your Friend and Brother.” Signed, washingtonor conotocariou

Washington from the Little Meadows, an Encampment about 20 miles above Fort Cumberland, with Monsieur Perony an Ensign, &amp; 25 men; to apprehend Monsieur Jumonville, La Force &amp; other Frenchmen, detached from Fort du Quesne to Reconnoitre the Country.  
  
  
  
  
“Stephens Carried only four days provision with him; &amp; there fell such a heavy rain, that it raisd all the Rivers in the Mountains; he sent out Hunters to kill provisions; employd the Rest in making Rafts, &amp; with labour &amp; difficulty crossd all the Rivers.  
  
  
  
  
“He at last arrivd with his detachmt. on the Monongahela near Redstone, &amp; was informed by Some Indian Traders, whom the French had permitted to Retire; that Joumonville &amp; his party finding the Weather unsuitable for Reconnoitering had returnd down the River to Fort du Quesne the day before. Stephens unwilling to Return to Washington without Some thing to Say, bethought himself of sending a Spy to Fort du Quesne for Intelligence. It was distant about 37 miles.  
  
  
  
  
“He pitched upon a person that in five days brought him the most Satisfactory &amp; Accurate Acct of every thing at Fort du Quesne. . . .  
  
  
  
  
“Stephens was amazed at so great an Accuracy, &amp; it immediately enterd into his head; that the fellow had got five pounds of him for the Scout, &amp; that probably he had Recevd. as much of the French for informing them of his Strength &amp; Situation. This occasiond as Quick a Return to Meet Washington as possible” (PPL: Benjamin Rush Papers).  
  
and in case they were in the Neighbourhood, to cease pursuing and to take care of themselves. I also ordered them to examine closely all the Woods round about, and if they should find any Frenchman apart from the rest, to seize him and bring him to us, that we might learn what we could from him: We were exceedingly desirous to know, if there was any Possibility of sending  
  
  
  
down any Thing by Water, as also to find out some convenient Place about the Mouth of Red-Stone-Creek, where we could build a Fort, it being my Design to salute the Half-King, and to send him back under a small Guard; we were also desirous to enquire what were the Views of the French, what they had done, and what they intended to do, and to collect every Thing, which could give us the least Intelligence. The 12th, Marched away, and went on a rising Ground, where we halted to dry ourselves, for we had been obliged to ford a deep River, where our shortest Men had Water up to their Arm-pits. There came an Express to us with Letters, acquainting us, that Col.

This Night also came two Indians from the Ohio, who left the French Fort five Days ago: They relate that the French Forces are all employed in building their Fort, that it is already Breast-high, and the Thickness of twelve Feet, and filled up with Earth and Stone, &amp;c. They have cut down and burnt up all the Trees which were about it, and sown Grain instead thereof. The Indians believe there were only 600 in Number; though they say themselves they are 800: They expect a greater Number in a few Days, which may amount to 1600, then they say they can defy the English.  The 18th, The Waters being yet very high, hindred me from advancing on Account of my Baggage, wherefore I determined to set myself in a Posture of Defence against any immediate Attack from the Enemy, and went down to observe the River.

My Brethren, It gives me great Pleasure, to learn that you are marching to assist me with your Counsels; be of good Courage, my Brethren, and march vigorously towards your Brethren the English; for fresh Forces will soon join them, who will protect you against your treacherous Enemy the French.

The great Waters do not permit us to make such Haste towards you as we would do; for that Reason I have sent the young Men to invite you to come and meet us: They can tell you many Things which they have seen in Virginia, and also how well they were received by the most Part of our Grandees; they did not use them as the French do your People who go to their Fort: they refuse them Provisions; this Man has had given him, all that his Heart could wish: For the Confirmation of all this, I here give you a Belt of Wampum.

who seemed to discourage me from seeking a Passage by Water; that made me alter my Mind of causing Canoes to be made; I ordered my People to wade, as the Waters were shallow enough; and continued myself going down the River in the Canoe: Now finding that our Canoe was too small for six Men, we stopped to make some Sort of a Bark;  
  
“Washington’s journal shows that the time spent at the task would have sufficed only for the building of a raft” (FREEMANDouglas Southall Freeman. George Washington: A Biography. 7 vols. New York, 1948–57., 1:364n).

by the Beginning of the Night. We underwent several Difficulties about  
  
eight or ten Miles from thence, though of no great Consequence, finding the Waters sometimes deep enough for Canoes to pass, and at other times more shallow. The 21st, Tarried there some Time to examine the Place, which we found very convenient to build a Fort, not only because it was gravelly, but also for its being at the Mouth of three Branches of small Rivers: The Plan thereof, which may be seen here, is as exact as could be done, without Mathematical Instruments.  
  
The plan of Turkey Foot has not been located.  
  
We went about two Miles to observe the Course of the River, which is very strait, has many Currents, is full of Rocks, and rapid; we waded it, though the Water was pretty high, which made me think it would not be difficult to pass it with Canoes. We also found other Places where the Water was rapid, but not so deep, and the Current smoother; we easily passed over them; but afterwards we found little or scarce any Bottom: There are Mountains on both Sides of the River. We went down the River about ten Miles, when at last it became so rapid as to oblige us to come ashore. (From the 22d to the 24th, the Journal contains only a Description of the Country.)

I Examined those two young Indians in the best Manner I could, concerning every Circumstance, but was not much the better satisfied. They say there are Parties of them often out, but they do not know of any considerable Number coming this Way. The French continue raising their Fort, that Part next to the Land is very well inclosed, but that next to the Water is much neglected, at least without any Defence: They have only nine Pieces of Cannon, and some of them very small, and not one mounted. There are two on the Point, and the others some Distance from the Fort next to the Land. They relate that there are many sick among them, that they cannot find any Indians to guide their small Parties towards our Camp, these Indians having refused them.

where we saw a Trader, who told us that he came this Morning from Mr. Gist’s, where he had seen two Frenchmen the Night before; and that he knew there was a strong Detachment out, which confirmed the Account we had received from the Half King: Wherefore I placed Troops behind two natural Intrenchments, where our Waggons also entered. The 25th, Detached a Party to go along the Roads, and other  
  
small Parties to the Woods, to see if they could make any Discovery. I gave the Horse-men Orders to examine the Country well, and endeavour to get some News of the French, of their Forces, and of their Motions, &amp;c. At Night all these Parties returned, without having discovered any thing, though they had been a great way towards the Place from whence it was said the Party was coming. The 26th, Arrived William Jenkins; Col. Fry had sent him with a Letter from Col. Fairfax,  
  
William Fairfax was at this time lieutenant colonel of the Fairfax County militia. The letter has not been found.

and were desirous to to see the Half King there, whereupon I sent him an Account thereof.  
  
Upon GW’s arrival at Great Meadows he had sent out “small light partys of Horse (Wagn. Horses) to reconnoitre the Enemy, and discover their strength &amp; motion, who return’d Yesterday with’t seeing any thing of them nevertheless, we were alarm’d at Night and remaind under Arms from two oClock till near Sun rise. We conceive it was our own Men, as 6 of them Deserted, but can’t be certain whether it was them or other Enemy’s. Be it as it will, they were fired at by the Centrys, but I believe without damage” (GW to Dinwiddie, 27 May 1754, ViHi).  
  
The 27th, Arrived Mr. Gist, early in the Morning, who told us, that Mr. la Force, with fifty Men, whose Tracks he had seen five Miles off, had been at his Plantation the Day before, towards Noon; and would have killed a Cow, and broken every Thing in the House, if two Indians, whom he had left in the House, had not persuaded them from their Design: I immediately detached 65 Men,

Ensign Peronie, three Sergeants, and three Corporals, with Instructions. The French enquired at Mr. Gist’s, what was become of the Half King? I did not fail to let the young Indians who were in our Camp know, that the French wanted to kill the Half King; and that had its desired Effect. They thereupon offered to accompany our People to go after the French, and if they found it true that he had been killed, or even insulted by them, one of them would presently carry the News thereof to the Mingoes, in order to incite their Warriors to fall upon them. One of these young Men was detached towards Mr. Gist’s; that if he should not find the Half King there, he was to send a Message by a Delaware. About eight at Night, received an Express from the Half King, which informed me, that, as he was coming to join us, he had seen along the Road, the Tracts of two Men, which he had  
  
followed, till he was brought thereby to a low obscure Place; that he was of Opinion the whole Party of the French was hidden there. That very Moment I sent out Forty Men, and ordered my Ammunition to be put in a Place of Safety, under a strong Guard to defend it, fearing it to be a Stratagem of the French to attack our Camp; and with the rest of my Men, set out in a heavy Rain, and in a Night as dark as Pitch, along a Patch scarce broad enough for one Man; we were sometimes fifteen or twenty Minutes out of the Path, before we could come to it again, and so dark, that we would often strike one against another: All Night long we continued our Rout, and the 28th, about Sun-rise, we arrived at the Indian Camp, where, after having held a Council with the Half King, it was concluded we should fall on them together; so we sent out two Men to discover where they were, as also their Posture, and what Sort of Ground was thereabout; after which, we formed ourselves for an Engagement, marching one after the other, in the Indian Manner: We were advanced pretty near to them, as we thought, when they discovered us; whereupon I ordered my Company to fire; mine was supported by that of Mr. Wager’s,  
  
Thomas Waggener held the rank of lieutenant in Jacob Van Braam’s company and was slightly wounded during the skirmish with Jumonville.  
  
and my Company and his received the whole Fire of the French, during the greatest Part of the Action, which only lasted a Quarter of an Hour, before the Enemy was routed. We killed Mr. de Jumonville, the Commander of that Party, as also nine others; we wounded one, and made Twenty-one Prisoners, among whom were M. la Force, M. Drouillon, and two Cadets.

h version of the engagement is contained in a letter from Contrecoeur to Duquesne, 2 June 1754: “I expected Mr. de Jumonville, within four Days; the Indians have just now informed me, that that Party is taken and defeated; they were Eight in Number, one whereof was Mr. de Jumonville. One of that Party, Monceau by Name, a Canadian, made his Escape, and tells us that they had built themselves Cabbins, in a low Bottom, where they sheltered themselves, as it rained hard. About seven o’Clock the next Morning, they saw themselves surrounded by the English on one Side and the Indians on the Other. The English gave them two Volleys, but the Indians did not fire. Mr. de Jumonville, by his Interpreter, told them to desist, that he had something to tell them. Upon which they ceased firing. Then Mr. de Jumonville ordered the Summons which I had sent them to retire, to be read. . . . The aforesaid Monceau, saw all our Frenchmen coming up close Mr. de Jumonville, whilst they were reading the Summons, so that they were all in Platoons, between the English and the Indians, during which Time, said Monceau made the best of his Way to us, partly by Land through the Woods, and partly along the River Monaungahela, in a small Canoe.  
  
  
  
  
“This is all, Sir, I could learn from said Monceau. The Misfortune is, that our People were surprized; the English had incircled them, and came upon them unseen. . . .  
  
  
  
  
“The Indians who were present when the Thing was done, say, that Mr. de Jumonville was killed by a Musket-Shot in the Head, whilst they were reading the Summons; and that the English would afterwards have killed all our Men, had not the Indians who were present, by rushing in between them and the English, prevented their Design” (MEMOIR[Jacob Nicolas Moreau].

In a letter to his brother, John Augustine, 31 May 1754, GW wrote a brief description of the engagement and its aftermath, which was printed in the London Magazine, Aug. 1754. According to this letter there were 12 Frenchmen killed. “We had but one man killed, and two or three wounded. . . . We expect every hour to be attacked by superior force, but, if they forbear one day longer, we shall be prepared for them. We have already got entrenchments, are about a pallisado which I hope will be finished to-day. . . . I fortunately escaped without any wound, for the right wing, where I stood, was exposed to and received all the enemy’s fire. . . . I heard the bullets whistle, and, believe me, there is something charming in the sound” (WRITINGSJohn C. Fitzpatrick, ed. The Writings of George Washington from the Original Manuscript Sources, 1745–1799. 39 vols. Washington, D.C., 1931–44., 1:70).

The Indians scalped the Dead, and took away the most  
  
Part of their Arms, after which we marched on with the Prisoners and the Guard, to the Indian Camp, where again I held a Council with the Half-King; and there informed him, that the Governor was desirous to see him, and was waiting for him at Winchester;  
  
he answered that, he could not go just then, as his People were in too eminent a Danger from the French, whom they had fallen upon; that he must send Messengers to all the allied Nations, in order to invite them to take up the Hatchet. He sent a young Delaware Indian to the Delaware Nation, and gave him also a French Scalp to carry to them. This young Man desired to have a Part of the Presents which were allotted for them, but that the remaining Part might be kept for another Opportunity: He said he would go to his own Family, and to several others, and would wait on them at Mr. Gist’s, where he desired Men and Horses should be sent ready to bring them up to our Camp. After this I marched on with the Prisoners; They informed me that they had been sent with a Summons to order me to depart.

A plausible Pretence to discover our Camp, and to obtain the Knowledge of our Forces and our Situation! It was so clear that they were come to reconnoitre what we were, that I admired at their Assurance, when they told me they were come as an Embassy; for their Instructions mentioned that they should get what Knowledge they could of the Roads, Rivers, and of all the Country as far as Potowmack: And instead of coming as an Embassador, publickly, and in an open Manner, they came secretly, and sought after the most hidden Retreats, more like Deserters than Embassadors in  
  
such Retreat they incamped, and remained hid for whole Days together, and that, no more than five Miles from us: From thence they sent Spies to reconnoitre our Camp; after this was done, they went back two Miles, from whence they sent the two Messengers spoken of in the Instruction, to acquaint M. de Contrecour of the Place we were at, and of our Disposition, that he might send his Detachments to inforce the Summons as soon as it should be given. Besides, an Embassador has princely Attendants; whereas this was only a simple petty French Officer; an Embassador has no Need of Spies, his Character being always sacred: And seeing their Intention was so good, why did they tarry two Days, at five Miles distance from us, without acquainting me with the Summons, or, at least, with something that related to the Embassy? That alone would be sufficient to raise the greatest Suspicions, and we ought to do them the Justice to say, that, as they wanted to hide themselves, they could not pick out better Places than they had done. The Summons was so insolent, and savoured the Gasconnade so much, that if it had been brought openly by two Men, it would have been an immediate Indulgence, to have suffered them to return. It was the Opinion of the Half-King in this Case, that their Intentions were evil, and that it was a pure Pretence; that they never intended to come to us but as Enemies; and if we had been such Fools as to let them go, they would never help us any more to take other Frenchmen. They say they called to us as soon as they had discovered us; which is an absolute Falshood, for I was then marching at the Head of the Company going towards them, and can positively affirm, that, when they first saw us, they ran to their Arms, without calling; as I must have heard them, had they so done. The 29th, Dispached Ensign Latour  
  
Ens. James Towers, of Capt. Peter Hog’s company, resigned from the Virginia Regiment at the end of 1754.  
  
to the Half-King, with about Twenty-five Men, and almost as many Horses; and as I expected some French Parties would continually follow that which we had defeated, I sent an Express to Colonel Fry for a Reinforcement. After this the French Prisoners desired to speak with me, and asked me in what Manner I looked upon them, whether as the Attendants of an Embassador, or as Prisoners of War: I answered  
  
them that it was in Quality of the Latter, and gave them my Reasons for it, as above. The 30th, Detached Lieutenant West, and Mr. Spindorph, to take the Prisoners to Winchester, with a Guard of Twenty Men. Began to raise a Fort with small Pallisadoes, fearing that when the French should hear the News of that Defeat, we might be attacked by considerable Forces. June the 1st, Arrived here an Indian Trader with the Half-King: They said that when Mr. de Jumonville was sent here, another Party had been detached towards the lower Part of the River, in order to take and kill all the English they should meet. We are finishing our Fort. Towards Night arrived Ensign Towers, with the Half-King, Queen Alguipa, and about Twenty-five or Thirty Families, making in all about Eighty or One Hundred Persons, including Women and Children. The old King being invited to come into our Tents, told me that he had sent Monakatoocha to Log’s Town, with Wampum, and four French Scalps, which were to be sent to the Six Nations, to the Wiendots, &amp;c. to inform them, that they had fallen upon the French, and to demand their Assistance. He also told me he had something to say at the Council, but would stay till the Arrival of the Shawanese, whom we expected next Morning. The 2d, Arrived two or three Families of the Shawanese: We had Prayers in the Fort. The 3d, The Half-King assembled the Council, and informed me that he had received a Speech from Grand-Chaudiere,  
  
Big Kettle (Canajachrera) was a Seneca chief living in the Ohio country. The Pennsylvanians referred to him as Broken Kettle (HANNACharles A. Hanna. The Wilderness Trail: Or The Ventures and Adventures of the Pennsylvania Traders on the Allegheny Path: With Some New Annals of the Old West, and the Records of Some Strong Men and Some Bad Ones. 2 vols. New York and London, 1911., 1:344–46).  
  
in Answer to the one he had sent him. The 5th, Arrived an Indian from the Ohio, who had lately been at the French Fort: This Indian confirms the News of two Traders being taken by the French, and sent to Canada; he saith they have set up their Pallisadoes, and enclosed their Fort with exceeding large Trees. There are eight Indian Families on this side the River, coming to join us: He met a Frenchman who had made his Escape in the Time of M. de Jumonville’s Action,  
  
Contrecoeur identified the fugitive as a Canadian called Monceau (see note 59).  
  
he was without either Shoes or Stockings, and scarce able to walk; however he let him pass, not knowing we had fallen upon them.  The 6th, Mr. Gist is returned, and acquaints me of the safe Arrival of the French Prisoners at Winchester, and of the Death of poor Colonel Fry.  
  
Fry had died on 31 May (see note 8). On 4 June Dinwiddie wrote to GW, appointing him to the command of the Virginia Regiment (DINWIDDIER. Alonzo Brock, ed. The Official Records of Robert Dinwiddie, Lieutenant-Governor of the Colony of Virginia, 1751–1758. 2 vols. Richmond, 1883–84., 1:193–94).  
  
It gave the Governor great Satisfaction to see the French Prisoners safely arrived at Winchester. I am also informed that, Mr. Montour,

is coming with a Commission to command Two Hundred Indians. Mr. Gist met a French Deserter, who assured him, that they were only Five Hundred Men, when they took Mr. Wart’s Fort, that they were now less, having sent Fifteen Men to Canada, to acquaint the Governor of their Success: That there were yet Two Hundred Soldiers who only waited for a favourable Opportunity to come and join us.

and we learnt that the Independent Company of Carolina was arrived at Wills-Creek. The 10th, I received the Regiment, and at Night had Notice, that some French were advancing towards us; whereupon I sent a Party of Indians upon the Scout towards Gist’s, in order to discover  
  
them, and to know their Number: Just before Night we had an Alarm, but it proved false. The 12th, Returned two of the Men, whom we had sent out Yesterday upon the Scout; they discovered a small Party of French; the others went on as far as Stuart’s.  
  
Stewart’s Crossing was on the Youghiogheny River below present-day Connellsville in Fayette County, Pa.  
  
Upon this Advice, I thought it necessary to march with the major Part of the Regiment, to find out those Ninety Men, of whom we had Intelligence. Accordingly I gave Orders to Colonel Must, to put away all our Baggage and Ammunition, and to place them in the Fort, and set a good Guard there till my Return; after which I marched at the Head of One Hundred and Thirty Men, and about Thirty Indians; but at the Distance of half a Mile, I met the other Indians, who told me, there were only nine Deserters; whereupon I sent Mr. Montour, with some few Indians, in order to bring them safe to me; I caused them to be drest, and they confirmed us in our Opinion, of the Intention of M. de Jumonville’s Party; that more than One Hundred Soldiers were only waiting for a favourable Opportunity to come and join us; that M. de Contrecour expected a Reinforcement of Four Hundred Men; that the Fort was compleated; and its Artillery a shelter to its Front and Gates; that there was a double Pallisadoe next to the Water; that they have only eight small Pieces of Cannon; and know what Number of Men we are. They also informed us, that the Delaware and Shawanese had taken up the Hatchet against us; whereupon, resolved to invite those two Nations to come to a Council at Mr. Gist’s. Sent for that Purpose Messengers and Wampum. The 13th, Perswaded the Deserters to write the following Letter, to those of their Companions who had an Inclination to Desert.

(It is not in the Journal.) The 15th, Set about clearing the Roads.  16th, Set out for Red-Stone-Creek, and were extremely perplexed, our Waggons breaking very often. 17th, Dispatched an Express to the Half-King, in order to perswade him to send a Message to the Loups [Delawares]; which he did. 18th, Arrived eight Mingoes from Loiston [Logstown], who at their Arrival told me of a Commission they had, and that a Council must be held. When we assembled, they told us very shortly, that they had often desired to see their Brethren out in the Field with Forces, and begged us not to take it amiss, that they were amongst the French, and that they complied with some of their Customs; notwithstanding which they were naturally inclined to fall upon them, and other Words to that Purport: After which they said, they had brought a Speech with them; and desired to deliver it with Speed. These, and other Discourses to the same Purpose, made us suspect that their Intentions towards us were evil; wherefore I delayed giving them Audience until the Arrival of the Half-King, and desired also the Delawares to have Patience till then, as I only waited their Arrival to hold a Council, which I expected would be that same Day. After the eight Mingoes had conferred a while together, they sent me some Strings of Wampum, desiring me to excuse their insisting on the Delivery of their Speech so speedily, that they now perceived it necessary to wait the Arrival of the Half King. When the Half-King arrived, I consented to give them Audience. A Council was held in the Camp for that Purpose, where the Half-King, and several of the Six Nations, Loups and Shawanese, to the Number of Forty, were present. The Speaker of the Six-Nations directed the following Speech to the Governor of Virginia. Brethren, WE your Brothers of the Six Nations, are now come to acquaint you, that we have been informed you threaten to destroy entirely all your Brethren the Indians, who will not join you on the Road; wherefore we who keep in our own Towns, expect every Day to be cut in Pieces by you. We would desire to know from your Mouth, if there be any Truth in that Information, and that you would not look upon it as preposterous, that we are come to enquire into it, since you very well know, that bad News commonly makes a deeper Impression upon us than good; that we  
  
may be fully satisfied by your Answers of the Truth thereof, we give you this Belt of Wampum. We know the French will ask us at our Return, of what Number our Brethren are whom we went to see? Therefore we desire you, by this Belt, to let us know it, as also the Number of those whom you expect, and at what Time you expect them, and when you reckon to attack the French, that we may give Notice thereof to our Town, and know also, what we shall have to tell the French. ANSWER. Brethren, WE are very glad to see you, and sorry that such Reports disquiet you: The English do not intend to hurt you, or any of your Allies; this News, we know, must have been forged by the French, who are constantly treacherous, asserting the greatest Falshoods whenever they think they will turn out to their Advantage; they speak well, promise fine Things, but all from the Lips outward; whilst their Heart is corrupted and full of venomous Poison. You have been their Children, and they would have done every Thing for you, but they no sooner thought themselves strong enough, than they returned to their natural Pride, and drove you off from your Lands, declaring you had no Right on the Ohio. The English, your real Friends, are too generous, to think of using the Six Nations, their faithful Allies, in like Manner; when you made your Address to the Governors of Virginia and Pennsylvania, they (at your repeated Request) sent an Army to maintain your Rights; to put you in the Possession of your Lands, and to take Care of your Wives and Children, to dispossess the French, to support your Prerogatives, and to make that whole Country sure to you; for those very Ends are the English Arms actually employed; it is for the Safety of your Wives and your Children that we fight; and as this is the only Motive of our Conduct, we cannot reasonably doubt of being joined by the remaining Part of your Forces, to oppose the common Enemy. Those that will not join us, shall be answerable, for whatever may be the Consequence; we only desire you, Brethren, to chuse that Side which shall seem most agreeable to them. The Indians of the Six Nations are those, who have the most Interest in this War; for them it is that we fight; and it would greatly trouble me to do them the least Hurt: We have engaged in this War, in order to assist and protect you; our Arms are open  
  
to receive you, and our Hands ready to nourish your Families during the Course of this War. The Governor of Virginia has often desired they might be sent to him, that he might see them in Person, nourish and cloath them according to their own Desire; but as you could not be determined to send them to him, we are ready to share in a friendly Manner, all our Provisions with you, and shall take such Measures, and give such Orders, that enough shall be brought to maintain your Wives and Children. Such a Conduct will evidently prove how much more the English love and esteem their Allies the Six Nations, than the French do; as we have drawn the Sword in your Cause, and in your Defence, delay not one Moment, be no more in Suspence, but put your Wives and Children under our Protection; and they shall find Plenty of Provisions; in the mean while, set your young Men and your Warriors to sharpen their Hatchets, in order to join and unite with us vigorously in our Battles. The Present, my Brethren, which I offer you, is not so considerable as I could wish, but I expect in a short Time a Quantity of Goods, which are to be at my Disposal, in order to reward those who shall have shewn themselves brave and active on this Occasion; however, I shall recompense them most generously. Be of good Courage, my Brethren, deliver your Country, and make it sure to your Children; let me know the Thoughts of your Hearts on this Affair, that I may give an Account of your Sentiments to your great Friend and Brother the Governor of Virginia. In order to assure you of my Sincerity and Esteem, I present you this Belt. The 20th, The Council still continued. When the Delawares knew that they were suspected of being in the French Interest, they demanded the Reason why they had been sent for, and what they should tell the French at their Return. I answered them, it was to let them know, that we were come at their reiterated requests to assist them with Sword in Hand; that we intended to put them in the Possession of those Lands which the French had taken from them. And as they had often demanded our Assistance, in Quality of our ancient and faithful Allies, I invited them to come and place themselves under our Protection, together with the Women and Children. Whereupon the Indian Speaker stretched out his Blanket on the Floor, and laid several Belts and Strings of Wampum thereon,  
  
in the same order he had received them from the French. This done, he repeated the Speeches of M. de Contrecour; after which, the Delaware Speaker directed to me the following Speech. Brethren, THE Governors of Virginia and Pennsylvania; We your Brethren, the Delawares remember perfectly well the Treaty of Loiston, where you and your Uncles the Six-Nations, considering the bad Situation we were in, for want of a Man to be our Leader, you then gave us a King,  
  
At the Logstown council in 1752, Shingas had been made head chief of the Delaware Nation by the Half-King (see SIPEC. Hale Sipe. The Indian Chiefs of Pennsylvania: Or, A Story of the Part Played by the American Indian in the History of Pennsylvania, Based Primarily on the Pennsylvania Archives and Colonial Records, and Built Around the Outstanding Chiefs. 1927. Reprint. New York, 1971., 287–88). For Shingas, see 25 Nov. 1753, n.27.  
  
and told us, he should transact all our publick Affairs between you and us; you gave us a Charge, not to listen to every vain Report that might be spread, but to consult ourselves, and to do, what would seem to us, to be right: We assure you, that we have given no Credit to any of those Reports, nor ever shall; but will be guided by you, our Brethren; and by our Uncles the Six-Nations: And will do, on all Occasions, what is just and right, taking Advice from you alone. To assure you of the Desire we have to fulfill our Engagements with you, we present you this Belt. After which they made the following Discourse, to the Six-Nations. Uncles, Thirteen Days are now past since we have received this Belt from the Onondago Council; I do not doubt your knowing it: They exhorted us to remember old Times, when they cloathed us with a Robe reaching down to our Heels; afterwards told us, to raise it up to our Knees, and there to make it very fast, and come to them at the Head of Susquehanna, where they had provided a Place for us to live; that they had also sent a Speech to those of our Nation, who live near the Minisinks, inviting them to go to the Place by them appointed, that they might live with us: They also sent us a Speech, to give us Notice that the English and French were upon the Point of coming to an Engagement on the River Ohio, and exhorted us to do nothing in that Juncture, but what was reasonable, and what they would tell us themselves. Lastly, They recommended to us, to keep fast Hold of the Chain of Friendship, which has so long subsisted between us and them; and our Brethren the English. A Belt. Then the Delawares spoke to the Shawanese as follows:  “Grand Sons, by this Belt, we take you between our Arms, and fetch you away from the Ohio, where you now are, to carry you amongst us, that you may live where we live, and there live in Peace and Quiet.[”] The Council after this was adjourned to the next Morning. The 21st, Met very early, and I spoke first to the Delawares in the following Manner. “Brethren, BY your open and generous Conduct on this Occasion, You have made yourselves dearer to us than ever; we return you our Thanks, that you did not go to Venango, when the French first invited you there; their treating you in such childish Manner, as we perceive they do, raises in us a just and strong Resentment: They call you their Children, and speak to you, as if you in reality were Children, and had no more Understanding than such. Consider well my Brethren, and compare all their Discourse, and you will find that all it tends to do, is to tell you, I am going to open your Eyes, to unstop your Ears, and such like Words to no Purpose, only proper to amuse Children. You also observe Brethren, that if they deliver a Speech, or make a Promise, and confirm it by a Belt, they imagine it binds them no longer than they think it consistent with their Interest to stand to it. They have given one Example of it; and I will make you observe it, in the Jump which they say they have made over the Boundaries, which you have set them; which ought to stir you up my Brethren, to a just Anger, and cause you to embrace the favourable Opportunity that we offer You, as we are come, at your Request, to assist you, and by Means of which, you may make them Jump back again, with more Speed than they advanced. A String of Wampum. The French are continually telling you, not to give Heed to the ill Reports that are told you concerning them who are your Fathers. If they did not know in their very Souls, how richly they deserve it on your Account, why should they suspect being accused? Why should they forewarn you of it, in order to hinder you from believing what is told you concerning them? With Regard to what they tell you of us, our Conduct alone will answer in our Behalf: Examine the Truth yourselves; you know the Roads leading to our Habitations, you have lived amongst us, you can speak our Language; but in order to justify ourselves from whatever might be said against us, and assure you of our brotherly Love; we once more invite your old Men, your Wives  
  
and your Children, to take Sanctuary under our Protection, and between our Arms, in order to be plentifully fed, whilst your Warriors and young Men join with ours, and espouse together the common Cause. A String of Wampum. Brethren, we thank you with all our Hearts, for having declared unto us, your Resolution of accomplishing the Engagements which you have entered into, at the Treaty of Loiston [Logstown], and we can do no otherwise than praise your generous Conduct with Regard to your Grand Sons the Shawanese; it gives us infinite Pleasure. We are greatly obliged to the Council given you by Onondago, charging you to hold fast the Chain of Friendship by which we are bound; I dare say, that had he known, how nearly you are interested in this War, or that it is for the Love of you, and at your Request, we have taken up Arms, he would have ordered you to DECLARE and to act immediately against the COMMON ENEMY of the Six Nations. In order to assure you of my Affection, and to confirm the Truth of what I have said, I present you these Two great Strings.” After this, the Council broke up, and those treacherous Devils, who had been sent by the French as Spies, returned, though not without some Tale ready prepared to amuse the French, which may be of Service to make our own Designs succeed. As they had told me there were Sixteen Hundred French, and Seven Hundred Indians on their March, to reinforce those at the Garrison, I perswaded the Half King to send three of his Men to inquire into the Truth of it; though I imagined this News to be only Soldiers Discourse; these Indians were accordingly sent in a secret Manner, before the Council broke up, and had Orders to go to the Fort, and get what Information they could from all the Indians they should meet, and if there was any News worth while, one of them should return, and the other two continue their Rout as far as Venango, and about the Lake, in order to obtain a perfect Knowledge of every Thing. I also perswaded King Shingas, to send out Rangers towards the River, to bring us News, in Case any French should come; I gave him also a Letter, which he was to send back again by an Express, to prevent my being imposed upon by a false Alarm. Though King Shingas, and others of the Delawares, could not be persuaded to retire to our Camp with their Families, through the Fear they were in of Onondago’s Council, they nevertheless gave us strong Assurances of their Assistance, and directed us in  
  
what Manner to act, in order to obtain our Desire: the Method was this; we were to prepare a great War-Belt, to invite all those Warriors who would receive it, to act independantly from their King and Council; and King Shingas promised to take privately the most subtil Methods to make the Affair succeed, though he did not dare to do it openly. The very Day the Council broke up, I perswaded Kaquehuston,  
  
This is probably a reference to Kekeuscung, “the healer,” who later became a Delaware chief. Like most of his tribe, he eventually supported the French. See n. 68.  
  
a trusty Delaware, to carry that Letter to the Fort which the French Deserters had written to their Comrades, and gave him Instructions how he should behave in his Observations, upon several Articles of which I had spoken to him; for I am certain the Fort may be surprized, as the French are encamped outside, and cannot keep a strict Guard, by Reason of the Works they are about. I also perswaded George,  
  
Delaware George later became a chief and went over to the French.  
  
another trusty Delaware, to go and take a View of the Fort, a little after Kaquehuston, and gave him proper Instructions recommending him particularly to return with Speed, that we might have fresh News. Presently after the Council was over, notwithstanding all that Mr. Montour could do to disswade them, the Delawares, as also the Half-King, and all the other Indians, returned to the Great Meadows; but though we had lost them, I still had Spies of our own People, to prevent being surprised. As it had been told me, that if I sent a Belt of Wampum and a Speech, that might bring us back both the Half-King and his young Men; accordingly I sent the following Speech by Mr. Croghan.

’Tis but lately since we were assembled together; we were sent here by your Brother the Governor of Virginia, at your own Request, in Order to succour you, and fight for your Cause; wherefore my Brethren, I must require that you and your young Men come to join and encamp with us, that we may be ready to receive our Brother Monacotocha, whom I daily expect: That this request may have its desired Effect, and make a suitable Impression upon your Minds, I present you with this String of Wampum. As those Indians, who were Spies sent by the French, were very inquisitive, and asked us many Questions in order to know by what Way we proposed to go to the Fort, and what Time we expected to arrive there; I left off working any further at the Road, and told them we intended to keep on across the Woods as far as the Fort, falling the Trees, &amp;c. That we were waiting here for the Reinforcement which was coming to us, our Artillery, and our Waggons to accompany us there; but, as soon as they were gone, I set about marking out and clearing a Road towards Red-Stone. The 25th, Towards Night came three Men from the Great Meadows, amongst whom was the Son of Queen Aliguipa.  
  
This was probably Canachquasy, also known as Captain New Castle (d. 1756), an important agent of the Pennsylvania government in its relations with the Indians (see SIPEC. Hale Sipe. The Indian Chiefs of Pennsylvania: Or, A Story of the Part Played by the American Indian in the History of Pennsylvania, Based Primarily on the Pennsylvania Archives and Colonial Records, and Built Around the Outstanding Chiefs. 1927. Reprint. New York, 1971., 258–66).  
  
He brought me a Letter from Mr. Croghan,  
  
Letter from George Croghan not found.  
  
informing me what Pains he was at to perswade any Indians to come to us; that the Half-King was inclined, and was preparing to join us, but had received a Blow which was a Hindrance to it. I thought it proper to send Captain Montour to Fort-Necessity, in order to try if he could, possibly, gain the Indians to come to us. The 26th, Arrived an Indian, bringing News that Monacotoocha, had burnt his Village (Loiston) and was gone by Water with his People to Red-Stone, and may be expected there in two Days. This Indian passed close by the Fort, and assures us, that the French had received no Reinforcement, except a small Number of Indians, who had killed, as he said, two or three of the Delawares. I did not fail to relate that Piece of News to the Indians in its proper Colours, and particularly to two of the Delawares who are here. The 27th, Detached Captain Lewis,

seven o’clock the next morning, they saw themselves surrounded by the  
English on one side, and Indians on the other. The English gave them  
  
two volleys, but the Indians did not fire. M. de Jumonviile, by his inter- |  
  
preter, told them to desist, that he had something to tell them. Upon  
which they ceased firing. ‘Then M. de Jumonville ordered the summons

My brethren the English, the bearer will let you understand in what

they would come and attack us; we now see how they have a mind to

We are now ready to fall upon them, waiting only for your suecour:  
Have good courage, and come as soon as possible ; you will find us as  
ready to encounter with them as you are yourselves.  
  
We have sent those two young men to see if you are ready to come, and  
if so, they are to return to us, to let us know where you are, that we may  
come and join you. We should be glad if the troops belongifig té the two  
provinces could méet together at the fort which is in the way. If youdo  
not come to our assistance now, we are entirely undone, and imagine we  
shall never meet together again. I speak it with a heart full of grief.

April 23d. A Council of war held at Wills-Creek, in order to consult  
upon what must be done on account of the news brought by Mr. Wart.  
  
The news brought by ensign Wart, having been examined into, as also  
the summons sent by Captain Contreceur, commander of the French  
troops, and the speeches of the Half-King, and of the other chiefs of the  
Six Nations; it appears, that Mr. Wart was forced to surrender the said  
fort, the 17th of this instant, to the French, who were above one thousand  
strong, and had eighteen artillery pieces, some of which were nine poun-  
ders,* and also that the detachment of the Virginia regiment, amounting  
to one hundred and fifty men, commanded by Colonel Washington had  
orders to reinforce the company of Captain Trent, and that the aforesaid  
garrison consisted only of thirty-three effective men.  
  
It was thought a thing impracticable to march towards the fort without  
sufficient strength ; however, being strongly invited by the Indians, and  
particularly by the speeches of the Half-King, the president gave his  
opinion, that it would be proper to advance as far as Red-Stone-Creek, on  
Monongahela, about thirty-seven miles on this side of the fort, and there  
to raise a fortification, clearing a road broad enough to pass with all our ar-  
tillery and our baggage, and there to wait for fresh orders.  
  
The opinion aforesaid was resolved upon, for the following reasons :  
  
Ist, That the Mouth of Red-Stone is the first convenient place on the  
river Monongahela.  
  
2d, That stores are already built at that place for the provisions of the  
company, wherein our arhmunition may be laid wp; our great guns may  
be also sent by water whenever we should think it convenient to attack the  
fort.

3d, We may easily (having all these conveniencies) preserve our people  
from the ill consequences of inaction, and encourage the Indians our allies,  
to remain in ourinterests. Whereupon, I sent Mr. Wart to the Governor,*  
with one of the young Indians and an interpreter: I thought it proper  
also to acquaint the Governors of Maryland and Pennsylvania of the news ;  
and I sent away the other Indian to the Half-King, with the speeches  
inclosed in the following letter.  
  
To the Honorable Robert Dinwiddie, Esq., Governor, &amp;c., §c.  
  
Sin:—Mr. Wart, an ensign of Captain Trent’s company, is this day  
come from Monongahela, and has brought the sorrowful news of the re-  
duction of the fort, on the 17th of this instant; having been summoned  
by Captain Contrecceur, to surrender to a body of French troops who  
were a thousand strong, who came from Wenango, with eighteen pieces  
of cannon, sixty battoes, and three hundred canoes ; they permitted all  
our men to retire, and take with them their working tools out of the fort,  
which was done the same day.  
  
Upon receiving this news, I called a council of war, in order to consult  
what was best to be done in such circumstances; and have sent you a  
particular account of every thing agreed upon at the same council, by the  
same express, that you may know things yet more particularly.  
  
Mr. Wart is the bearer of the summons, as also of the speech, from  
the Half-King, wherein I inclosed the wampum ; he is in company with  
one of those Indians mentioned in the speech, who had been sent to see  
our forces, and to know what time they might expect us; the other In-  
dian I have sent back with a message. I hope you will find it necessary  
to send us our forces as soon as they are raised, as also a sufficient num-  
ber of canoes, and other boats with decks; send us also some mortar  
pieces, that we may be in a condition to attack the French with equal  
forces. And as we are informed that the Indians of the Six Nation,t  
and the Outawas, are coming down Sciodo Creek, in order to join the  
French who are to meet at the Ohio; so I think it would not be amiss to  
invite the Cherokees, Catawbas, and the Chickasaws to come to our as-  
sistance; and as I have received intelligence, that there is no good under-  
standing between them and the Indians of the Six nations aforesaid, it  
would be well to persuade them to make a peace with them; otherwise,  
if they should meet at the Ohio, it might cause great disorder, and turn  
out to our disadvantage.  
  
We find the great advantage there is in water carriage, wherefore, I  
would remind you to provide a number of boats for that purpose.  
  
This day, arrived the men belonging to Captzin Trent, who, by your  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
orders, had been enlisted as militia troops; the officers having imprudent-  
ly promised them two shillings per day, they now refuse to serve for less |  
pay ;. Wart shall receive your orders on that head.

To his Excellency Horatio Sharp, Governor of Maryland.  
  
Sir:—I am here arrived with a detachment of one hundred and fifty  
men: we daily expect Colonel Fry with the remaining part of the regi-  
ment and the artillery ; however, we shall march gently along the moun-  
tains, clearing the roads as we go,* that our cannon may with the great-  
er ease be sent after us; we propose to go as far as Red Stone river,  
which falls into Monongahela, about thirty-seven miles this side of the  
fort which the French have taken, from thence all our heavy luggage  
may be carried as far as the Ohio. A store is built there by the Ohio  
Company, wherein may be placed our ammunition and provisions.  
  
Besides the French forces above mentioned, we have reason te believe  
according to the accounts we have heard, that another party is coming to  
the Ohio; we have also learnt that six hundred of the Chippewais and  
Ottoways Indians, are coming down the river Sciodo, in order to join  
them.  
  
The following is my answer to the speech of the Half-King:  
  
“To the Half-King, and to the chiefs and warriors of the Shawanese  
and Loups our friends and brethren. I received your speech by brother  
Bucks, who came to us with the two young men six days after their de-  
parture from you. We return you our greatest thanks, and our hearts  
are fired with love and affection towards you, in gratitude for your con-  
stant attachment to us, as also your gracious speech, and your wise coun-  
sels,  
  
This young man will inform you, where he found a small part of our  
army, making towards you, clearing the roads for a great number of our  
warriors, who are ready to follow us, with our great guns, our ammuni-  
tion and provisions. AsI delight in letting you know with speed the  
thoughts of our heart, I send you back this young man, with this speech,  
to acquaint you therewith, and the other young man I have sent to the  
Governor of Virginia, to deliver him your speech and your wampum, and  
to be an eye-witness of those preparations we are making, to come in all  
haste to the assistance of those whose interest is as dear to us as our  
lives; We know the character of the treacherous French, and our con-  
duct shall plainly show you, how much we have it at heart. I shall not  
be satisfied if I do not see you before all our forces are met together at  
the fort which is in the way ; wherefore, I desire, with the greatest ear-  
nestness, that you, or at least one of you, would come as soon as possi-  
ble, to meet us on the road, and to assist us in council. I present you  
with these bunches of wampum, to assure you of the sincerity of my  
speech, and that you may remember how much I am your friend and  
brother. Signed, | WasnINncTon,

April 28. Came to us some pieces of cannon, which were taken up  
to the mouth of Patterson’s river.  
  
(From the 29th of April to the 11th of May, the journal only contains  
marches, and things of little consequence.)  
  
May the llth. Detached a party of twenty-five men, commanded by  
Captain Stephens and Ensign Peronie, with orders to go to Mr. Gist’s,  
to enquire where La Furce* and his party were ; and in case they were  
in the neighborhood, to cease pursuing and take care of themselves. I  
alse ordered them to examine closely all the woods round about, and,  
if they should find any Frenchman apart from the rest, to seize him .and  
bring him to us, that we might learn what we could from him. We were  
exceedingly desirous to know, if there was any possibility of sending  
down any thing by water, as also to find out some convenient place about  
the mouth of Red Stone Creek, where we could build a fort, it being my  
design to salute the Half-King, and to send him back under a small guard;  
we were also desirous to enquire what were the views of the French,  
what they had done, and what they intended to do,t and to collect every-  
thing which could give us the least intelligence.  
  
The 12th. Marched away, and went on a rising ground, where we  
halted to dry ourselves, for we had been obliged to ford a deep river,  
where our shortest men had water up to their arm-pits.  
  
There came an express to us with letters acquainting us, that Colonel  
Fry, with a detachment of one hundred men and upwards, was at Win-  
chester, and was to set out in a few days to join us ; as also that Colonel  
  
  
  
Innis was marching with three hundred and fifty men, raised in Carolina; ||  
  
that it was expected Maryland would raise two hundred men, and that  
Pennsylvania had raised ten thousand pounds, (equal to about fifty-two  
thousand five hundred livres) to pay the soldiers raised in other colonies,  
as that province furnisheth no recruits, as also that Governor Shirley had  
sent six hundred men to-harass the French in Canada; t{ I hope that will  
give them some work to do, and will slacken their sending so many men  
to the Ohio as they have done.  
  
The 16th. Met two traders who told us they had fled for fear of the  
French, as parties of them were often seen towards Mr. Gist’s. These  
traders are of opinion, as well as many others, that it is not possible to  
clear a road for any carriage to go from hence to Red Stone Creek.  
  
The 17th. This night Mr. Wart arrived with the young Indian from  
Williamsburg, and delivered me a letter, wherein the Governor is so good  
as to approve of my proceedings, but is much displeased with Captain  
Trent, and has ordered him to be tried, for leaving his men at the Vhio;  
The Governor also informs me that Captain Mackay, with an indepen

dent company of one hundred men, excluding the officers, was arrived,  
and that we might expect them daily; and that the men from New Yogk  
would join us within ten days.  
  
This night also came two Indians from the Ohio, who left the French  
fort five days ago. ‘They relate that the French forces are all employed  
in building their fort, that it is already breast high, and the thickness of  
twelve feet, and filled up with earth and stone, &amp;c. ‘They have cut down  
and burnt up all the trees which were about it, and sown grain instead  
thereof. The Indians believe they were only six hundred in number,  
though they say themselves they are eight hundred. They expect a  
greater number in a few days ; which may amount to one thousand six  
hundred, then they say they can defy the English.  
  
Thel8th. The waters being yet very high hindered me from advancing  
on account of my baggage, wherefore I determined to set myself in a  
posture of defence against any immediate attack from the enemy,* and  
went down to observe the river.  
  
The 19th. I dispatched the young Indian which was returned with  
Mr. Wart, to the Half-King, with the following speech.  
  
To the Half-King, &amp;c.  
  
My Brethren,—Itgives me great pleasure to learn that you are marching  
to assist me with your counsels, be of good courage my brethren, and  
march vigorously towards your brethren the English; for fresh forces  
will soon join them, who will protect you against your treacherous enemy  
the French. My friends whom I send to you will acquaint you of an  
agreeable speech which the Governor of Virginia addresses to you ; he is  
very sorry for the bad usage you have received, The great waters do not  
permit us to make such haste towards you as we would do; for that  
reason I have sent the young men to invite you to come and meet us ; they  
can tell you many things which they have seen in Virginia, and also how  
well they were received by the most part of our Grandees ; they did not  
use them as the French do your people who go to their fort ;t they refuse  
‘them provisions ; this man has had given him, all that his heart could  
wish ; for the confirmation of all this, I here give you a Belt of Wam-  
pum.  
  
The 20th. Embarked ia a canoe with Licutenant West, three soldiers,  
and one Indian; and having followed the river along, about half a mile,  
were obliged to come ashore, where I met Peter Suver, a trader, who  
seemed to discourage me from seeking a passage by water ; that made me  
alter my mind of causing canoes to be made; I ordered my people to  
wade, as the waters were shallow enough ; and continued myself going  
down the river in the canoe ; now finding that our canoe was too small for  
6 men, we stopped to make some sort of a bark, with which, together with  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
*It has been seen ia the foregoing pieces, that this pretended enemy had no inclination to attack.  
  
+ This isthe only bad usage this pretended Halt-King could complain of: The French were not  
Willing to receive in their forts such Indians as were perfidious and evil-minded: It may be  
seen in Robert Stobo’s letter hereaficr, how the French used the Indian.

our canoe, we gained Turkey Foot by the beg:nning of the night : we  
underwent several difficulties about eight or ten miles from thence, though  
of no great consequence, finding the waters some times deep enough for  
canoes to pass, and at other times more shallow.  
  
The 21st. ‘Tarried there some time to examine the place, which we  
found very convenient to build a fort, not only because it was gravelly,  
but also for its being at the mouth of three branches of small rivers : the  
plan thereof, which may be here seen, is as exact as could be done with-  
out mathematical Instruments.  
  
We went about two miles to observe the course of the river which is  
very strait, has many currents, is full of rocks, and rapid ; we waded it,  
though the water was pretty high; which made me think it would not  
be difficult to pass it with canoes.  
  
We also found other places where the water was rapid, but not so  
deep, and the current smoother; we easily passed over them ; but after-  
wards we found little or scarce any bottom ; there are mountains on both  
sides of the river. We went down the river about ten miles, when at  
last it became so rapid as to oblige us to come ashore.  
  
(From the 22d to the 24th, the journal contains only a description of  
the country.)  
  
The 24th. This morning arrived an Indian in company with him I  
had sent to the Half-King, and brought me the following letter from him.  
  
  
  
  
  
To any of his Majesty’s officers whom these may concern.  
  
As ’tis reported that the French army is set out to meet Mr. George  
Washington, I exhort you my brethren to guard against them ; for they  
intend to fall on the first English they meet ;* they have been on their  
march these two days; the Half-King and the other chiefs will join you  
within five days, to hold a council, though we know not the number we  
shall be. I shall say no more; but remember me to my brethren the  
English. Signed, The Harr-Kine.  
  
I examined those two young Indians in the best mannerI could, concern-  
ing every circumstance, but was not much the better satisfied.  
  
They say there are parties of them often out but they do not know of  
any considerable number coming this way.t The French continue raising  
their fort, that part next to the land, is very well inclosed, but next to the  
water is much neglected, nine pieces of cannon, and some of them very  
small, and not one mounted. There are two on the point, and the other  
at some distance from the fort next to the land.  
  
They relate that there are many sick among them, that they cannot  
find any Indians to guide their small parties towards our camp, these  
Indians having refused them.

The same day, at two o’clock, we arrived at the meadows, where we  
saw a trader, who told us that he came this morning from Mr. Gist’s,  
where he had seen two Frenchmen the night before ; that he knew there  
was a strong detachmen* out, which confirmed the account we had receiv-  
ed from the Half-King: wherefore I placed troops behind two natural  
intrenchments, where our waggons also entered.  
  
The 25th, detached a party to go along the roads, and other small parties  
to the woods, to see if they couldmake any discovery. I gave the horse-  
men orders to examine the country well, and endeavor to get some news  
of the French, of their forces, and of their motions, &amp;c.  
  
At night all these parties returned, without having discovered any thing,  
though they had been a great way towards the place from whence it was  
said the party was coming.  
  
The 26th, arrived William Jenkins ; Colonel Fry had sent him with a  
letter from colonel Fairfax, which informed me, that the Governor himself,  
as also Colonels Corbin and Ludwell, were arrived at Winchester, and  
were desirous to see the Half-King there, whereupon I sent him an account  
thereof.  
  
The 27th, arrived Mr. Gist early in the morning, who told us, that  
M. la Force with fifty men, whose tracks he had seen five miles off, had  
been at his plantation the day before, towards noon; and would have  
killed a cow, and broken every thing in the house, if two Indians whom  
he had left in the house, had not persuaded them from their design; I  
immediately detached sixty-five men, under command of Captain Hog

Lieutenant Mercer, Ensign Peronie, three Serjeants, and three Corporals,  
with instructions.  
  
The French enquired at Mr. Gist’s, what was become of the Half-King?  
I did not fail to let the young Indians who were in our camp know, that  
the French wanted to kill the Half-King ; and that had its desired effect.*  
They thereupon offered to accompany our people, to go after the French,  
and if they found it true that he had been killed, or even insulted by them,  
one of them would presently carry the news thereof to the Mingoes, in order  
to incite their warriors to fall upon them. One of these young men was  
detached towards Mr. Gist’s; that if he should not find the Half-King  
there, he was to send a message by a Delaware.  
  
About eight at night received an express from the Half-King, which  
informed me, that, as he was coming to join us, he had seen along the  
road, the tracts of two men which he had followed, till he was brought  
  
| thereby to a low obscure place, that he was of opinion the whole party  
  
of the French was hidden there : that very moment I sent out forty men,  
and ordered my ammunition to be put in a place of safety, under a strong  
guard to defend it ; fearing it to be a stratagem of the French to attack our  
camp, and with the rest of my men, set out in a heavy rain, and in a night

as dark as pitch, along a path scarce broad enough for one man; we were  
sometimes fifteen or twenty minutes out of the path, before we could come  
to it again; and so dark that we would often strike one against another.  
All night long we continued our route, and the 28th, about sunrise, we ar-  
rived at the Indian camp, where, after having held a council with the  
Half-King, it was concluded we should fall on them together; so we sent  
out two men to discover where they were, as also their posture, and what  
sort of ground was thereabout; after which, we formed ourselves for an  
engagement,* marehing one after the other, in the Indian manner. We  
were advanced pretty near to them, as we thought, when they discovered  
us; whereupon, I ordered my company to fire, mine was supported by  
that of Mr. Wager’s, and my company, and his, received the whole fire  
of the French, during the greatest part of the action, which only lasted  
a quarter of an hour, before the enemy was routed.  
  
We killed M, de Jumonville, the commander of that party, as also nine  
others ; we wounded one, and made twenty-one prisoners, among whom  
were M. la Force, M. Drouillon, and two cadets. The Indians scalped  
the dead, and took away the most part of their arms, after which we  
marched on with the prisoners and the guard, to the Indian camp, where  
again I held a council with the Half-King; and there informed him, that  
the Governor was desirous to see him, and was waiting for him at Win-  
chester; he answered that he could not go just then, as his people were  
in too imminent a danger from the French, whom they had fallen upon ;t  
that he must send messengers to all the allied nations, in order to invite  
them to take up the hatchet. He sent a young Delaware Indian to the  
Delaware nation, and gave him also a French scalp to carry to them.  
This young man desired to have a part of the presents which were allot-  
ted for them, but that the remaining part might be kept for another op-  
portunity. He said he would go to his own family, and to several others,  
and would wait on them at Mr. Gist’s, where he desired men and horses  
should be sent ready to bring them up toourcamp. After this I marched  
on with the prisoners ; They informed me that taey had been sent with a  
summons to order me to depart. A plausible pretence to discover our  
camp,t and to obtain the knowledge of our forces and our situation! It  
was so clear that they were come to reconnoitre what we were, that I ad-  
  
  
  
f  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
mired at their assurance, when they told me they were come as an em-  
bassy ; for their instructions mentioned that they should get what knowl-  
edge they could of the roads, rivers, and of all the country as far as Po-  
tomac; and, instead of coming as an Embassador, publicly, and in an  
open manner, they came secretly, and sought after the most hidden re-  
  
  
  
* Therefore certain it is that the English had orders to attack.  
  
+ Major Washington takes care here, not to give a faithful account: but the endeavor he makes  
to justify himself, will be seen hereafter.  
  
J All their fear was from the French, because they knew they had been attacked, and they  
would pay ef revenge themselves.

treats,&quot; more like deserters than ambassadors; in such retreats they en-  
camped, and remained hid for whole days together, and that no more than  
five miles from us: from thence they sent spies to reconnoitre our camp;  
after this was done, they went back two miles, from whence they sent the  
two messengers spoken of in the instruction, to acquaint M. de Contre-  
cwur of the place we were at, and of our disposition, that he might send  
his detachments to enforcet the summons as soon as it should be given.  
  
  
  
Besides, an embassador has princely attendants; whereas this was  
only a simple petty French officer; an embassador has no need of spies,  
his character being always sacred: and seeing their intention was so good,  
why did they tarry two days at five miles distance from us,t without ac-  
quainting me with the summons, or, at least, with something that related  
to the embassy? That alone would be sufficient to raise the greatest sus-  
picions, and we ought to do them the justice to say, that, as they wanted  
to hide themselves, they could not pick out better places than they had  
done.  
  
The summons was so insolent, and favored the gasconade so much,  
that if it had been brought openly by two men, it would have been an  
  
immediate indulgence, to have suffered them to return.||  
  
It was the opinion of the Half-King in this case, that their intentions  
were evil,§ and that it was a pure pretence; that they never intended to  
come to us but as enemies ;. and if we had been such fools as to let them  
go, they would never help us any more to take other Frenchmen.  
  
They say they called to us as soon as they had discovered us, which is  
an absolute falsehood, for I was then marching at the head of the company  
going towards them, and can positively affirm, that, when they first saw  
us, they ran to their arms, without calling; as I must have heard them,  
had they so done.  
  
The 29th. Dispatched Ensign Latour to the Half-King, with abouttwen-  
ty five men, and almost as many horses; and as I expected some French  
parties would continually follow that which we had defeated, I sent an ex-  
press to Colonel Fry for a reinforcement.  
  
After this the French prisoners desired to speak with me, and asked  
me in what manner I looked upon them, whether as the attendants of an  
Embassador, or. as prisoners of war: I answered them that it was in  
quality of the latter, and gave them my reasons for it, as above.  
  
The 30th. Detached Lieutenant West, and Mr. Spindorph, to take the  
prisoners to Winchester, with a guard of twenty men.

Began to raise a a fort with small pallisadoes, fearing that when the French  
should hear the news of that defeat, we might be attacked by considerabe  
forces. ;  
  
June the 1st. Arrived here an Indian trader with the Half-King : they  
said that when Mr. de Jumonville was sent here, another party had been  
detached towards the lower part of the river,* in order to take and kill all  
the, English they should meet. .  
  
Weare finishing our fort.  
  
Towards night arrived Ensign Towers, with the Half-King, Queen  
Alguipa,t and about twenty-five or thirty families, making in all, about  
eighty or one hundred persons, including women and children, The old  
Kingt being invited to come in to our tents, told me that he had sent  
Monakatoocha to Log’s-town, with Wampum, and four French Scalps,  
which were to be sent to the Six Nations, to the Wiandots, &amp;c., to inform  
them, that they had fallen upon the French, and to demand their assist-  
ance.  
  
He also told me he had something to say at the council, but would stay  
till the arrival of the Shawanese, whom we expected next morning.  
  
The 2d. Arrived two or three families of the Shawanese: we had  
prayers in the fort.  
  
The 3d. ‘The Half-King assembled the council, and informed me that  
he had received a speech from Grand-Chaudiere, in answer to the one he  
had sent him.  
  
The 5th. . Arrived an Indian from the Ohio, who had lately been at the  
French fort: this Indian confirms the news of two traders being taken by  
the French, and sent to Canada; he saith they have set up their palli-  
sadoes, and enclosed their fort with exceeding large ‘trees.  
  
There are eight Indian families on this side the river, coming-to joifi  
us: He met a French man who had made his escape in the time of M.  
de Jumonville’s action, he was without either shoes or stockings, and  
scarce able to walk ; however he let him pass, not knowing we had fallen  
upon them.  
  
The 6th. Mr. Gist is returned, and a¢quaints me of the safe hrrival of  
the French prisoners at Winchester, and of the death of poor Colonel Fry.  
  
It gave the Governor great’ satisfaction to see the French prisoners  
safely arrived at Winchester. .  
  
I am also informed that Mr. Montour,|) is coming with a commission to  
command two hundred Indians.  
  
Mr. Gist met a French deserter, who assured him, that they were as  
five hundred men, when they took Mr. Wart’s fort, that they were now  
less, having sent fifteen men to Canada, to acquaint the Governor of their  
success: that there were yet two hundred soldiers, who only waited for a  
favourable Opportunity to come and j join us.

The 9th. Arrived the last body of the Virginia Regiment, under the  
command of Colonel Must,* and we learnt that the independant company  
of Carolina was arrived at Wills-Creek.  
  
The 10th. I received the Regiment, and at night had notice, that some  
French were advancing towards us ; whereupon I sent a party of Indians  
upon the Scout towards Gist’s, in order to dicover them, and to know  
their number. Just before night we had an alarm, but it proved false.  
  
The 12th. Returned two of the men, whom we had sent out yesterday  
upon the scout ; they discovered a small party of French ; two others went  
on as far as Stuart’s. Upon this advice, I thought it necessary to march  
with the major partof the Regiment, to find out those ninety men, of  
whom we had intelligence. Accordingly I gave orders to Colonel Must,  
to put away all our baggage and ammunition, and to place them in the  
fort, and set a good guard there till my return; after which I marched at  
the head of one hundred and thirty men, and about thirty Indians; but  
at the distance of half a mile, I met the other Indians, who told me, there  
were only nine deserters ; whereupon I sent Mr. Montour, with some few  
| Indians, in order to bring them safe to me; I caused them to be drest, and  
they confirmed us in our opinion, of the intention of M. de Jumonville’s  
party ; that more than one hundred soldiers were only waiting for a  
favorable opportunity to come and join us; that M. de Contrecceur ex-  
pected a reinforcement of four hnndred men ; that the fort was completed ;  
and its artillery a shelter to its front and gates; that there was double  
Pallisadoe next to the water; that they have only eight small pieces of  
cannon, and know what number of men we are.  
  
They also informed us, that the Delawares and Shawaneset had taken  
up the hatchet against us ; whereupon, resolved to invite those two nations  
to&#x27;come to a council at Mr. Gist’s. Sent for that purpose messengers  
and Wampum.  
  
The 13th. Persuaded the deserters to write the following letter, to  
those of their companions who had an inelination to desert.}  
  
It is not in the Journal.)  
  
The 15th. Set about clearing the roads.  
  
16th. Set out for Red-Stone-Creek, and were extremely perplexed,  
our waggons breaking very often.  
  
17th. . Dispatched an express to the Half-King, in order to persuade  
him to send/a.message to the Loups ; which he did.  
  
18th, . Arrived eight Mingoes from Loiston,§ who at their arrival told  
me.of a commission they had, and that a council must be held. When  
we assembled, they told us very shortly, that they had often desired to see  
their brethren out in the field with forces, and begged us not to take it  
amiss, that they, were amongst the French, and that they complied with  
some of their customs ; notwithstanding which they were naturally in-  
clined to fall upon them, and other words to that purport: after which

they said they had brought a speech with them, and desired to deliver it  
with speed. ‘These, and other discourses to the same purpose, made us  
suspect that their intentions towards us were evil; wherefore I delayed  
giving the audience until the arrival of the Half-King, and desired also the  
Delawares to have patience till then, as I only waited their arrival to hold  
a council, which I expected would be that same day. After the eight  
Mingoes had conferred a while together, they sent me some strings of  
Wampum, desiring me to excuse their insisting on the delivery of their  
speech so speedily, that they now perceived it necessary to wait the arrival  
of the Half-King.  
  
When the Half-King arrived, I consented to give the audience.  
  
A council was held in the camp for that purpose, where the Half-King,  
and several of the Six Nations, Loups and Shawanese, to the number of  
forty, were present.  
  
The speaker of the Six Nations directed the following speech to the  
Governor of Virginia.  
  
Brethren.—We your brothers of the Six-Nations are now come to ac-  
quaint you, that we have been informed you threaten to destroy entirely all  
your brethren the Indians, who will not jom you on the road ; wherefore  
we who keep inour own towns, expect every day to be cut in pieces by  
you. We would desire to know from your mouth, if there be any truth  
in that information, and that you would not look upon it as preposterous,  
that we are come to enquire into it, since you very well know that bad  
news commonly makes a deeper impression upon us than good ; that we  
may be fully satisfied by your answers of the truth thereof, we give you  
this Belt of Wampum.  
  
We know the French will ask us at our return, of what number our  
brethrenfare, whom we went to see? Therefore we desire you, by this  
Belt, to let us know it, as also the number of those whom you expect,  
and at what time you expect them, and when you reckon to attack the  
French, that we may give notice thereof to our town and know also,  
what we shall have to tell the French.  
  
ANSWER.  
  
Brethren:—We are very glad to see you, and sorry that such reports  
disquiet you. The English do not intend to hurt you, or any of your  
allies ; this news, we know, must have been forged by the French, who  
are constantly treacherous, asserting the greatest falsehoods * whenever  
they think they will turn out to their advantage; they speak well, prom-  
ise fine things, but all from the lips outward; whilst their heart is cor-  
rupted and full of venomous poison. You have been their children, and  
they would have done every thing for you, but they no sooner thought  
themselves strong enough, than they returned to their natural pride, and

drove you off from your lands, declaring you had no right on the Ohio.*  
The English your real friends, are too generous, to think of using the Six  
Nations, their faithful allies, in like manner; when you made your ad-  
dress to the Governors of Virginia and Pennsylvania; they, at your re-  
peated request) sent an army to maintain your rights ;+ to put you in the  
possession of your lands, and to take care of your wives and children, to  
dispossess the French, to support your prerogatives, and to make that  
.whole country sure to you; for those very ends are the English arms ac-  
tually employed ; it is for the safety of your wives and your children,  
that we fight, and as this is the only motive of our conduct,{ we cannot  
reasonably doubt of being joined by the remaining part of your forces, to  
oppose the common enemy.  
  
Those that will not join us, shall be answerable for whatever may be  
the consequence ; we only desire your brethren to choose that side which  
shall be most agreeable to them.  
  
The Indians of the Six Nations are those, who have the most interest  
in this war; for them it is that we fight; and it would greatly trouble me  
to do them the least hurt; we have engaged in this war in order to assist  
and protect you; our arms are open to receive you, and our hands ready  
to nourish your families during the course of this war. The Governor  
of Virginia has often desired they might be sent to him, that he might  
see them in person, nourish and clothe them according to their own de-  
sire; but as you could not be determined to send them to him, we are  
ready to share in a friendly manner, all our provisions with you, and  
shall take such measures, and give such orders, that enough shall be  
brought to maintain your wives and children. Such a conduct will evi-  
dently prove how much more the English love and esteem their allies the  
Six Nations,]| than the French do. As we have drawn the sword in  
your cause, and in your defence, delay not one moment, be no more in  
suspence, but put your wives and children under our protection ; and they  
shall find plenty of provisions; in the mean while, set your young men  
and your warriors to sharpen their hatchets, in order to join and unite  
with us vigorously in our battles.  
  
The presents, my brethren, which I offer you, is not so considerable  
as I could wish, but I expect in a short time a quantity of goods, which  
are to be at my disposal, in order to reward those who shall have shown  
themselves brave and active on this occasion; however, I shall recom-  
pence them most generously.

~ Be of good courage, my brethren, deliver your country, and make it  
sure to your children; let me know the thoughts of your hearts on this  
affair, that | may give an account of your sentiments to your great friend  
and brother, the Governor of Virginia. In order to assure you of my  
sincerity and esteem, I present you this belt.  
  
The 20th: The council still continued.  
  
When the Delawares knew that they were suspected of being in the  
French interest, they demanded the reason why they had been sent for,  
and what they should tell the French at their return.  
  
I answered them it was to let them know, that we were come at their  
reiterated requests to assist them with sword in hand ;* that we intended  
to put them in the possession of those lands which the French had taken  
from them.  
  
And as they had often demanded our assistance, in quality of our an-  
cient and faithful allies, I invited them to come and place themselves _un-  
der our protection, together with the women and children.  
  
Whereupon the Indian speaker stretched out his blanket upon the floor,  
and laid several belts and strings of wampum thereon in the same order  
he had received them from the French. ‘This done, he repeated the  
speeches of M. de Contreceeur ;t after which, the Delaware speaker di-  
rected to me the following speech:  
  
“« Brethren, the Governor of Virginia and Pennsylvania:—We ‘your  
brethren, the Delawares, remember perfectly well the treaty of Loiston,  
where you and your uncles the Six Nations, considering the bad situa-  
tion we were in, for want of a man to be our leader, you then gave us a  
king, and told us, he should transact all our public affairs between you and  
us ;{ you gave us a charge, not to listen to every vain report that might  
be spread, but to consult ourselves, and to do, what would seem to us to  
be right. We assure you that we have given no credit to any of these re-  
ports, nor ever shall; but will be guided by you our brethren, and by our  
uncles the Six Nations, and will do on all occasions, what is just and  
right, taking advice from you alone. To assure you of the desire we  
have to fulfil our engagements with you, we present you this belt.”’  
  
After which they made the following discourse, to the Six Nations:  
  
* Uncles, Thirteen days are now past, since we have received the belt  
from the Onondago Council; I do not doubt your knowing it. They ex-  
horted us toremember old times, when they clothed us with a robe reach-  
ing down to our heels ; afterwards told us, to raise it up to our knees, and  
_ there to make it very fast, and come to them at the head of Susquehanna,  
  
where they had provided a place for us to live; that they had also sent  
a speech to those of our nation who live near the Minnesinks, inviting  
them to go to the place by them appointed, that they might live with us.

They also sent us a speech, to give us notice that the English and Freneh  
were upon the point of coming to an engagement on the Ohio river, and  
exhorted us to do nothing in that juncture, but what was reasonable, and  
what they would tell us themselves; lastly, they recommended to us, to  
keep fast hold of the chain of Friendship, which has so long subsisted  
between us and them, and our brethren the English.  
  
A belt.  
  
Then the Delawares spoke to the Shawanese as follows:  
  
“ Grand sons, by this belt, we take you between our arms, and fetch you  
away from the Ohio, where you now are, to carry you amongst us, that  
you may live where we live, and there live in peace and quiet,”  
  
The council after this was adjourned till the next morning.  
  
The 21st. Met very early, and I spoke first to the Delawares in the  
following manner.  
  
“ Brethren, by your open and generous conduct on this occasion, you  
have made yourselves dearer to us than ever; we return you our thanks  
that you did not goto Venango, when the French first invited you there ;  
their treating you in such a childish manner, as we perceive they do, rai-  
ses in us a just and strong resentment. They call you their children, and  
speak to you, as if you in reality were children, and had no more under-  
standing than such.  
  
“ Consider well my brethren, and compare all their discourse, and you  
will find that all it tends to, is to tell you, I am going to open your eyes,  
to unstop your ears, and such like words to no purpose, only proper to  
amuse childreu. You also observe brethren, that if they deliver a speech,  
or make a promise, and confirm it by a belt, they imagine it binds them  
no longer than they think it consistent with their interest to stand to it.  
They have given one example of it, and I will make you observe it, in  
the jump; which they say they have made over the boundaries, which you  
had set them; which ought to stir you up my brethren, to a just anger,  
and cause you to embrace the favorable opportunity that we offer you, as  
we are come, at your request, to assist you, and by means of which, you  
may make them jump back again, with more speed than they advanced.  
  
A-string of wampum,  
  
“The French are continually telling you, not to give heed to the ill-re-  
ports that are told you concerning them who are your fathers. If they  
did not know in their very souls, how richly they deserve it on your ac-  
count, why should they suspect being accused? Why should they fore.  
warn you of it, in order to hinder you from believing what is told you  
concerning them? With regard to what they tell you of us, our conduct  
alone will answer in our behalf; examine the truth yourselves; you  
know the roads leading to our habitations, you have lived amongst us,  
you can speak our ianguage ; but in order to justify ourselves from what-

once more invite your old men, your wives and your children, to take  
sanctuary under our protection, and between our arms, in order to be  
plentifully fed, whilst your warriors, and young men join with ours, and  
espouse together the common cause.  
  
A string of wampum,  
  
‘«‘ Brethren, we thank you with all our hearts, for having declared unto  
us, your resolution of accomplishing the engagements which you had en-  
tered into, at the treaty of Loiston,* and we can do no otherwise than  
praise your generous conduct with regard to your grand sons, the Shaw-  
anese ; it gives us infinite pleasure.  
  
We are greatly obliged to the counsel given you by Onondago, char-  
ging you to hold fast the chain of friendship by which we are bound; I  
dare say, that had he known, how nearly yon are interested in this war,  
or that it is for the love of you, and at your request,t we have taken up  
arms, he would have ordered you to declare, and to act immediately  
against the common enemy of the Six Netions. In order to assure you  
of my affection, and to confirm the truth of what I have said, I present  
you these two great strings.”  
  
After this, the eouncil broke up, and those treacherous devils, who had  
been sent by the French as spies, returned, though not without some tale,  
ready prepared to amuse the French, which may be of service to make  
our own designs succeed.  
  
As they had told me there were sixteen hundred French, and seven  
hundred Indians on their march, to reinforce those at the Garrison, I per-  
suaded the half-King to send three of his men to inquire into the truth of  
it; though I imagine this news to be only soldiers’ discourse ; these In-  
dians were accordingly sent in a secret manner, before the council broke  
up, and had orders to go to the fort, and get what information they could  
from all the Indians they should meet, and if there was any news worth  
while, one|] of them should return, and the other two continue their route as  
far at Venango, and about the lake, in order to obtain a perfect knowledge  
of every thing.  
  
I also persuaded King Shingas, to send out rangers towards the river,  
to bring us news in case any French should come; I gave him also a letter,  
which he was to send me back again by an express, to prevent my being

obtain our desire ; the method was this; we were to prepare a great war  
Belt, tu invite all those warriors who would receive it, to act independently  
from their King and coancil ; and King Shingas, promised to take pri-  
vately the most subtile methods to make the affair succeed, though he  
did not dare to do it openly.  
  
The very day the council broke up, I persuaded Kaquehuston, a trusty  
Delaware, to carry that letter to the fort which the French deserters had  
written to their comrades, and gave instructions how he should behave  
in his observations, upon several articles of which I had spoken to him ;  
for I am certain the fort may be surprized, as the French are encamped  
outside, and cannot keep a strict guard, by reason of the works they are  
about.  
  
  
  
I also persuaded George, another trusty Delaware, to go and take a  
view of the fort, a little after Kaquehuston, and gave him proper instruc-  
tions, recommending him particularly to return with speed, that we might  
have fresh news.  
  
Presently after the council was over, notwithstanding all that Mr.  
  
Montour could do to dissuade them, the Delawares as also the Half-King,  
and all the other Indians, returned to the Great Meadows ; but though we  
  
‘had lost them, I still had spies of our own people, to prevent being sur-  
  
prised.  
  
As it had been told me, that if I sent a Belt of Wampum and a speech,  
that might bring us back both the Half-King and his young men ; accor-  
dingly I sent the following speech by Mr. Croghan.  
  
*Tis but lately since we were assembled together ; we were sent here  
by your brother the Governor of Virginia, at your own Request, in order  
to succour you, and fight for your cause ; wherefore my brethren, I must  
require, that you and your young men come to join and encamp with us,  
that we may be ready to receive our brother Monacatoocha, whom I dai-  
ly expect; that this request may have its desired effect, and make a suita-  
ble impression upon your minds,I present you with strings of Wam-  
pum,”  
  
As those Indians, who were spies sent by the French were very in-  
quisitive and asked us many questions, in order to know by what way we  
proposed to go to the fort, and what time we expected to arrive there ; I  
left off working any farther at the road, and told them we intended to  
keep on across the woods as far as the fort, felling the trees, due; That  
we were waiting here for the reinforcement which was coming to us, our  
artillery, and our waggons to accompany us there; but, as soon as they  
were gone, I set about marking out and clearing a road towards Red  
Stone.

amongst whom was the son of Queen Alguipa.

He brought me a letter from Mr. Croghan, informing me what pains he  
was at to persuade any Indians to come to us; that the Half-King was  
inclined, and was prepating to join us, but had received a blow which  
was a hindrance to it. I thought it proper to send Captain Montour to  
fort Necessity, in order to try if he could, possibly, gain the Indians to  
come to ns.  
  
The 26th. Arrived an Indian, bringing news that Monacatoocha had  
burnt his village, (Loiston) and was gone by water with his people to  
Red Stone, and may be expected there in two days. This Indian passed  
elose by the fort, and assures us, that the French had received no rein-  
forcement, except a small number of Indians, who had killed, as he said,  
two or three of the Delawares. I did not fail to relate that piece of  
news to the Indians in its proper colours, and particularly to two of the  
Delawares who are here.

About seven o&#x27;clock the next morning they saw themselves surrounded by the English

Jumonville, whilst they were reading the Summons, so that they were all in Platoons,  
between the English and the Indians, during which Time, said Menceau made the best  
of his way to us, partly by land through the woods, and partly along the River  
Mananngahela, in a small canoe.  
  
The account is continued in a letter of M. de Chauvignerie to du

The Indians who were present when the thing was done, say that M. de Jumonville  
was killed by a musket shot in the head while they were reading the Summons, and tha
