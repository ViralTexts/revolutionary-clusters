We had the honor to receive your letter of February 3d. on the 6th. instant, and are now to give you a detail of the measures we have pursued in obedience to the instructions it communicated.  
					To enable you to form a just idea of those measures it will be proper to state concisely what had occurred at the time of receiving your letter, after the departure of Mr. Purviance, with the treaty and our dispatch of the 3d. of January.  
					Soon after that date we resumed our conferences with the British Commissioners, as we intimated it was our intention to do, and had nearly digested with them the project of a supplemental convention upon the principal topics alluded to in the last paragraph  
						of that dispatch, when an entire change took place in the British ministry, Lord Grenville and his associates being compelled to retire in favor of the friends of the late Mr. Pitt. This change of course suspended the further progress of the business, and in that state it  
						still remains.  
					Before this change in the administration, we had presented to the British Commissioners, according to an agreement which accompanied the signature of the treaty, an antedated note on the subject of indemnity, and another to Lord Howick on the same subject,  
						previously seen and approved by the British Commissioners. With these papers (of which copies are now transmitted) the British Commissioners not only expressed their perfect satisfaction, but assured us then, as they have frequently done since, that the just confidence with  
						which that agreement had inspired us, in regard to its object, would not be disappointed.  
					We had many conferences with the British Commissioners, previous to the late change, upon the subject of impressments, in which they invariably declared to us that the practice of their government would be strictly conformable to the spirit of the article,  
						which they had settled with us, and which was afterwards rejected by the Cabinet. They stated that the prejudice of the navy, and of the country generally, was so strong in favor of their pretension, that the ministry could not encounter it, in a direct form; and that in  
						truth, the support of Parliament could not have been relied on in such a case. It was their idea that by discontinuing the practice in the mode proposed by them, which might be done without giving any shock to the public feeling, this prejudice might be gradually overcome,  
						and an arrangement by treaty on this very delicate and difficult subject rendered ultimately practicable. The United States would in the interim enjoy the security they sought, without any abandonment of their rights, and be induced to yeild in return, as their confidence  
						increased, the equivalents which we had offered in our project.  
					The footing upon which the note of the British Commissioners (which is and must be considered as equally obligatory as if actually inserted in the treaty) left this point, was supposed to be the less liable to exception on our part, because, while it  
						affords a pledge, unquestionably intended to secure the substance of our object, and constantly admitted here to be equal to that effect, it keeps it nevertheless, for our advantage, completely open for future negotiation and more formal ajustment. The note declares that the  
						discussion of any plan will be entertained that can be devised &quot;to secure the interests of both States without injury to rights to which they are respectively attached&quot;, and consequently provides for a renewal of negotiation with a sincere view to such an arrangement as shall  
						be practically consistent with the declared pretensions of the United States, and yet leave untouched the British principle, or, in other words, an arrangement, in which Great Britain shall agree to conform her conduct to our views, without renouncing the claim which she has  
						hitherto maintained and acted upon. It was supposed therefore to be the clear import of that note that the conduct of Great Britain would not, while the discussion of such a plan as it might be proper to insert in a treaty stood postponed at the request of it’s Commissioners,  
						encroach in practice upon rights, which we had so strongly asserted and vindicated as rights not to be abandoned--which it was well understood our government and country would not suffer to be invaded in future as they had been during the past--and which the British  
						Commissioners themselves, acting under the immediate orders of the Cabinet, had in their note distinctly recognized as fit to be preserved hereafter from injury and violation. This conclusion was thought to be the more just and natural, when it was remembered that it was  
						supported, not only by the verbal admissions and declarations of the British Commissioners, which would of course, as they well knew, be reported to our government, but by the language of such parts of the note as looked particularly to the future practice of Great Britain on  
						the subject of impressments. It was believed to be fortified too by the obvious consideration, that the United States would be authorized, notwithstanding any ajustment by treaty on other points, in case of the impressment on the high seas of a single mariner from on board an  
						American vessel, to view it as an act of aggression, and to resent it accordingly. This right existed, undoubtedly, independently of that note, but it seemed notwithstanding to derive from it a new and high sanction favorable to its just effect: and certainly the sensibility  
						and determination which have been manifested on this point by the United States, especially of late, and by the American Commissioners during the recent negotiation, must have inspired this government with the conviction that a perseverance in such outrages upon their  
						sovereignty and the rights of their citizens would be wholly incompatible with the peaceful relations of the two countries, which it was the professed object of the British Commissioners and their government to preserve. It is proper, however, for us to state that it was our  
						intention to have requested of this government written explanations on this topic of impressment as well as on that of indemnity for the purpose of transmitting them to you. The approaching departure of Mr. Monroe for the United States would it was thought furnish a suitable  
						occasion for such an application.  
					Towards the end of the last month the change took place in the ministry, and on the 27th. the diplomatic corps had their first interview with Mr. Canning, who succeeded Lord Howick in the foreign department. Although the meeting was general, a seperate  
						audience was given, as is usual, to the representatives of each power. At Mr. Canning’s request we gave him a concise but just view of the state of the business between our governments. He appeared not to have heard before of what had taken place relative to the project of a  
						supplemental convention. He said that he had come too recently into office to be able to say any thing decisive on any of the topics of which we had given him a sketch, but that he would soon make himself acquainted with them, and give us another interview. His professions,  
						which were of a general nature, were conciliatory.  
					Such was the state of affairs when we had the honor to receive your letter of February the 3d. We were anxious to carry into effect the instructions contained in that letter in the best manner in our power and with the least possible delay. It became  
						especially our duty to make known to the new ministry, as soon as we might be able, the understanding which had subsisted between the British Commissioners, and through them the late Cabinet, and us, as to the condition on which we had consented to continue the negotiation,  
						after our project relative to impressments had been rejected; that in fact we had no authority to treat after that went; and that our government was not bound, or supposed or intended to be bound, to ratify what we had done, if it disapproved of it. We were equally desirous  
						of turning to the best account the appeal which a refusal to ratify by our government would make to the interests of this country, in an effort to arrange by treaty this great point with the new ministry. The first measure seemed to be free from difficulty. The statement  
						proposed was an act of justice to our government, and of duty to it and our country, which might be discharged with out the slightest hazard to the public interest. Indeed, as it was presumable that this government would soon receive intelligence from Mr. Erskine, which,  
						without such an explanation, could hardly fail to produce an unfavorable effect, it appeared to be indispensably necessary to make it, to prevent a public injury. The second object however was evidently involved in more difficulty. From what we had seen, in the debates in  
						Parliament, of the disposition of several of the members of the new ministry, before they came into power, on subjects which were connected with our treaty, independent of other causes, we had reason to believe that great caution ought to be observed in any communication  
						which we might make to it on that point. Although Lord Holland &amp; Lord Auckland had retired from their offices of Lord Privy Seal and President of the board of trade, they still retained their situations as Commissioners extraordinary and plenipoteniary, and, as we  
						presumed, would continue to do so until the business, in which we had been engaged with them, should be concluded. In every view it seemed to be just and expedient to confer with them on the subject of our late dispatch. We accordingly obtained an early interview, in which we  
						communicated, in confidence, the substance of that dispatch, as well in conformity with the orders of the President, as in the hope that they might be able to assist us in the accomplishment of its objects. But we found them under circumstances of such peculiar delicacy with  
						the new ministry that it was not in their power to give us the slightest aid. They informed us that, on the change of ministers, Lord Howick had communicated to Mr. Canning the state in which our business stood, and more particularly, the progress which had been made in the  
						proposed plan of a convention, in the expectation that he would have requested them to proceed in it: that, however, no such request had been made, in consequence of which they should feel it their duty, in case he continued silent, to withdraw from the commission. They  
						expressed their regret that they had not been able to arrange with us by treaty the subject of impressment, as they wished to have done: but assured us that the order which they had engaged should be issued in their note of November 8th. had been actually issued about that  
						time and in terms calculated, as they had understood, to accomplish the object desired. They saw no objection to our being furnished with a copy of that order, and presumed that it might still be obtained. In adverting to the understanding which had subsisted between us on  
						the failure of the article which had been submitted to the Cabinet for providing against impressments at sea, we were happy to find that they retained a perfect recollection of it in the sense in which we have stated it above. They admitted that we had a right to

nion that, if their friends had remained in office, well disposed as they knew them to be towards the United States, the mode in which we were now about to pursue this object would not tend to produce, in that or any other respect, a favorable effect. They could  
						therefore give us no advice as to the part which it became us to take in the present juncture. They intimated however that by obtaining an interview and conferring with Mr. Canning we might probably ascertain the sentiments of his government on the whole subject, and be  
						enabled thereby to pursue the course which would be best adapted to the spirit of our instructions and the interests of our country.  
					Immediately after our interview with the British Commissioners we asked one of Mr. Canning, which was obtained on the  instant. It was our intention to have confined ourselves in the first instance to the topics above  
						mentioned, and to the information which we thought it our duty to give him of the understanding, which had subsisted between the British Commissioners and ourselves, of the condition on which we had proceeded to the other points of the negotiation after the project of an  
						article relative to impressments had been rejected. As soon however as we glanced at the objects of the interview, he observed that he had just received intelligence, which, if true, would make it unnecessary for us to enter at present on any of the topics alluded to; that it  
						had been represented to him that an officer just arrived from America had that morning informed the Admiralty that the treaty which had been lately concluded here, had been rejected by our government: that he had not seen the officer, and therefore could not state the grounds  
						on which the information rested. He observed that such an event would place the relations of the two countries in an embarrassing situation, and wished to know whether we had received any intelligence of a like import. We perceived at once that the important feature in your  
						dispatch of February 3d., respecting the disclosure of which to the new ministry we had entertained some doubt, was not only either already known to it or soon would be, but that inferences of a dangerous tendency were likely to be drawn from the refusal of our government to  
						ratify the treaty, in case it should occur, which such an event could not justify. We saw therefore the necessity of communicating to Mr Canning immediately the substance of that dispatch, as well for the purpose of preventing those errors, as to obey the instructions  
						contained in it, over which, in the respect alluded to, we should have exercised any discretion with great reluctance. We assured Mr. Canning that there could be no foundation for the report of the rejection of the treaty, as we were satisfied that Mr. Purviance, who had  
						carried it to our government, could not have arrived in the United States in time to enable the President to submit it to the consideration of the Senate before the 3d. of March, when Congress must have adjourned, and that he must be sensible that until the receipt of our  
						dispatch no step, at least of so decisive a character, would be taken in the business. We stated however that we had great reason to believe that the treaty would not be ratified in its present form, for a cause which was well known to His Majesty’s late government. We then  
						communicated to him fully all the circumstances on which that remark was founded, particularly the nature of our instructions relative to impressments; the knowledge which the British Commissioners had of them; the entire suspension of the negotiation at a certain period on  
						the failure with the Cabinet of a project of an article for the regulation of that point; the considerations which induced us afterwards to proceed in the negotiation, founded on the note of the British Commissioners of the 8th. of November the nature of which we fully  
						explained; and finally the condition on which we did proceed in the business, that is, that our government would not be bound to ratify the treaty, if it should not be satisfied with the substitute for such an article offered in that note. He asked us, in case the treaty  
						should not be ratified, in what state our government wished to place the relations of the two countries? We replied that it was it’s wish that the subject of impressment should be resumed and arranged: We explained to him the nature of the article, on the failure of which the  
						negotiation had been suspended, and shewed that Great Britain would gain by it much more than an equivalent for the forbearance of the practice of which we complained, independent of the other good effects likely to result from it. On this point he gave no opinion, but asked  
						what the relation should be in case no such agreement as we desired should take place respecting impressments? We replied that in such a case, it would be the desire of our government that no treaty should be concluded, but that the relations should be placed informally on  
						the most friendly footing; adhering, in the explanations which we gave him on this head, to the ideas contained in your letter of February 3d., but without mentioning the actual receipt of such a letter. He said he was glad to find that our government looked in all events to  
						amicable arrangements. We told him that we had not heard from you since the treaty had arrived in America, but that full instructions would doubtless be forwarded to us as soon after that event as possible. He then observed that, under present circumstances, he thought it  
						would be better to let the whole business rest, as it would be impossible for either party to move in it with advantage. He promised, in case the officer above mentioned, brought any thing material, to inform us of it, and to appoint a time for another interview, which  
						however he has not since done. We enclose a copy of his note of the next day.  
					It is impossible for us to give you a satisfactory opinion as to the prospect of arranging this important business with the present ministry. All the facts on which such an opinion should be formed, not previously known to you, are stated above. As however  
						we are not perfectly aware of the consequences of any act on our part, which might tend to lessen the obligation of this government to ratify the treaty, in case it should be ratified by the President and Senate, we have thought it best (especially as Mr. Canning, after  
						promising us an appointment, has shewn no disposition towards another interview) to leave things in their present state until we hear from you. We flatter ourselves that we shall soon have that satisfaction, as we see by the gazettes that Mr. Purviance must have arrived at  
						Washington about the 12th. of March. In the mean time we have placed our affairs on a footing the most favorable for any course which our government may take, and we beg you to be assured that we shall, with the utmost zeal and promptitude, adopt that which shall be thought  
						the most expedient. We have the honor to be with the highest respect and consideration, Sir, Your most Obt. Hble Serants  
					  
						  
							Jas. Monroe  
						  
						  
							Wm: Pinkney  
						  
					  
					  
						P. S. We are preparing a letter to you explanatory of the project of a supplemental convention mentioned above which will be forwarded in a few days. A Copy of the project of the British Commissioners will be enclosed. It is not our intention to proceed,  
							even if this government should be so disposed, to do any thing conclusive upon the subjects embraced by it, until the views of the President shall be known to us relative to such of the topics as were not contemplated by the instructions originally given to the  
							mission

Before this change in the administration,

paniea the signature of the treaty, an ante­  
dated note on the subject of indemnity, imti  
another to lord Howick on the same subject,

rbv th&#x27; language of such parts of the note us  
!&lt;&gt;&lt; particularly to the future practice of  
t.reat Britain on the subject ot impressments.  
It was believed to be fortified tbo by the ob­  
vious consideration, that the U. States would  
he authorised, notwithstanding any adjust­  
ment by treaty upon other points, in a case  
VI the impressment on&#x27;thehigh seas of a sin­  
gle mariner from on hoard an American ves­  
sel. to view it as an act of aggression, and to  
k“escnt it accordingly. This right existed,  
undoubtedly, independently of that note :  
• but it seenled notwithstanding to derive from  
it a new and high sanction favorable to its  
just effect: and certainly the sensibility and  
‘determination which have l&gt;eeu mhnifestfed  
on tliis point by the U. States, especially of  
late, and bv the American commissioners du­  
ring the recent negotiation, must have in­  
spired this government with the conviction,  
that a perseverance in such outrages upon  
&#x27;their sovereignty and the rights of their ci­  
tizens, would be wholly incompatible with  
♦he peaceful relations of the two countries,  
which it was the professed object: of the Bri­  
tish commissioners and their government to  
preserve. It is proper, however, for us to*  
state that it was our intention to have re­  
quested of this government written explana­  
tions ou this topic of impressment, as well  
as on that of indemnity, for the purpose of  
transmitting them to you. The approaching,  
departure of Mr. Mtfnvde for the U. States,  
would, it was thought, furnish a suitable oc­  
  
Casion lor such an application.  
I uwards tlie end. of the last month, the  
change took place in the nunistrv, and on  
the 27th the diplomatic corps had their first  
,iuu*rv iew with Mr. Canning, who succeeded  
&#x27;lord Ilowiek in the foreign department. Al­  
though the meeting V.&#x27;as general, a separate  
audience was giv en, as is usual, to the reprU  
sentatives ol each poV.tr. Ac Sir. Canning’s  
&#x27;request we gave him a concise, bat jnst view  
ol the state .of business between our govern­  
ments. He appeared not to not have heard  
Xic-fure of v. hat had taken place relative to  
the project of a supplemental convention.—  
He said that he had come too recently into  
office to be able to say any thing decisive  
on anv of the topics of which we had given  
him a sketch, but that he would soon make  
himself acquainted with them, ami give us  
another intervietv. His professions, which  
were of a general nature, were conciliatory.  
Sueli w.’.s the state of affairs when wte had  
thehonor to receiv e your letter of February  
the 3d. We wa rt tmxtous to carry into ef­  
fect the instructions contained in that letter,  
in the best manner in our power, and with  
the least possible delay. It became especi­  
ally our duty to make known to the new mi­  
nistry, as soon astve might he able, the un­  
derstanding which had subsisted between  
the British commissioners and through them  
tiie late cabinet, and us, as to the condition  
On which vve had consented to continue the  
negotiation, after our ’project relative to im­  
pressments had been rejected j that in fact  
we had no authority to treat after that event  
-—and that our government was not hound,  
or supposed or intended to he hound, to rati­  
fy what we had done, if it disapproved of it.  
W e were equally desirous of turning to the  
best account the appeal which a refusal to  
ratify by our government, would make to  
the interests of this country, in an effort to  
arrange by treaty this great point with the  
new ministry. The first measure seemed  
to be free from difficulty. The statement  
proposed was an act of justice to our govern­  
ment, and of duty to it and our country,  
which might be discharged without the  
slightest hazard to the public interest. In­  
deed, as it was presumable that this govern­  
ment would soon receive intelligence from  
Mr. Er.skinc, which, without an explanation,  
t*ouhi hardiy fail to produce an unfavorable  
&lt; f*vc.t, ii appeared to be indispensably ne­  
cessary to make it, to prevent a public inju­  
ry. The second object, however, was evi­  
dently involved in more difficulty. From  
what we had seen, in the debates in Parlia­  
ment, of the disposition of several of the  
members of the new ministry, before thev  
came into power, on subjects which were  
connected with our treaty, independent of o­  
th*rcauses, we had reason to believe, that  
great caution ought to be observed in any  
communication which we might make to it  
on that point. Although lord Holland and  
lord Auckland had retired from their offices  
of lord privy seal and president Of ihc board  
of trade, they still retained their situations  
as commissioners extraordinary and pleni­  
potentiary, and as vve presumed, would con­  
tinue to do so until the busincs, in which we  
had been engaged with them, should be con­  
cluded. In every view it seemed to be just  
and expedient to confer with them ori the  
subject of our late dispatch. We ac cording­  
ly obtained an early interview, in which we  
communicated, in confidence, the substance  
of that dispatch, as well \ii coriformhv with  
the orde-s of the president, as in the hope  
that they might he able to assist us in the ac­  
complishment of its object. Rut We found  
them under Circumstances of such peculiar  
delicacy with the new ministry,that it was not  
in their power togive us the slightest aid._  
They informed us that, on the exchange of  
T nisters, lord llowick had communicated  
•oMr. Canning the state in which our busi­  
ness stood, and mold particularly the pro­  
gress which had been made in the proposed  
pian ot convention, iir the expectation that  
he would have requested tli&#x27;Th Co proceed in  
it: that, liov. ever, no such request had been  
nir.de. iu consequence of which they should  
lee! if then dutv, in case lie continued silent  
ti&gt; withdraw from the commission. They  
Expressed their vegiet that t!., v had not  
been able to arrange with »»s by treaty the  
subject of impressment, as they wished to  
have done : but assured us that the order  
which they had engaged should hr issued iu  
their note of November atli, had befcn actu­  
aii&gt; issued about that time, and in terms  
Calculated, as they h id understood, to ac­  
rctinp isii the object desired. They saw no  
object taft to our being furnished vviili a copy  
of that order, and presumed that it &quot;mi-lit

ionthrit, if their friends had remained in of- |  
lice, well di.s]&gt;osed ms they knew them to be 1  
UnvanU the United S. the mode in which we  
were now about to pursue this object would  
not tend to produce, in that or any other re­  
spect, a favorable effect. They could there- ;  
fore give us no advice as to the part which  
it became us to take in the present juncture.  
They intimated, however, that by obtaining  
an interview and conferring with Mr. Can­  
ning we might probably ascertain the senti­  
ments of his government on the whole subject,  
and be enabled thereby to pursue the course  
which would be best adapted to the spirit of  
our instructions 2c the interests of our Country.  
  
Immediately after our interview with the  
British&#x27;commissioners we asked ime of Mr.  
Canning, which was obtained on the instant.  
It was our intention to &quot;have confined our­  
selves in the first instance to the topics a­  
bove mentioned, and to the information  
which we thought it our duty to give him  
oi the understanding which had subsisted be­  
tween the British commissi oners and our­  
selves, of the condition on which we had  
proot*feded to the other points of the negoti­  
ation uftfer the project of an article relative  
to impressments had been rejected. As spon  
however, as we glanced at the objects of the  
interview, he observed that he had just re­  
ceived intelligence which, if true, would make  
it umiessary for us to enter at present on a­  
ny of the topics alluded to; that it had been  
represented to him that an officer, just ar­  
rived turn. America, had that morning in­  
formed the admiralty that the treaty which  
had been lately concluded here, had been  
rejected by our go\ eminent; dm hi hid not  
seen the officer, and therefore could not  
state the grounds on which the information  
rested. He observed that such an event  
would place the relations of the two coun­  
tries in an embarrassing situation, and  
wished to know whether w«e had received  
any intelligence of a like import. We per­  
ceived at once, that the important feature  
in your dispatch of February 3d, respecting  
the disclosure ot which to the new ministry  
wc hud entertained some doubt, was not on­  
ly cither already known to it, or soon would  
be, but that inferences ot a dangerous ten­  
dency were likely to be drawn from the re­  
fusal of our government to ratify the treaty,  
in case it should occur, which such an event  
could not justify. Wc saw therefore, tbe  
necessity of communicating to Mr. Canning  
immediately the substance of that dispatch,  
as well for the purpose of preventing those  
errors, as to obey the instructions contain­  
ed in it, over which, in the respect alluded  
to, we should have exercised any discretion  
with great reluctance. We assured Mr.  
Cunning, that there could KaVe been no  
foundation for the report of t*e rejection of  
the treaty, as wc were satisfied that Mr.  
Pun-lance, who had carried it to our govern­  
ment, could not have arrived in the United  
States in time to enable the president to  
submit it to the consideration of the Senate,  
before the 3d of March, when Congress  
must have adjourned ; and that he must be  
sensible, that until the tcccipt of our dis­  
patch, no step, at least of so decisive a  
diameter, would be taken in the business._  
We staled, however, that we had great rea­  
son to believe that the treaty would not be  
ratified in its present form, fora cause which  
was well known to his majesty’s late govern­  
ment. We then communicated to him fully  
all the circumstances on which that remark  
was founded particularly the nature of our  
instructions {relative to impressments; the  
knowledge which the British commissioners  
had of theul; the entire suspension of the  
negotiation at a certain period, on the fai­  
lure with the cabinet of a project of an ar­  
ticle for the regulation of that point; the  
considerations which induced us after­  
wards to proceed in the ncgociation, founded  
on the note of the British commissioners of the  
8th of November, the nature of which we ful­  
ly explained ; and finally the condition on  
which wc did proceed in the business, that  
is, that our government would not bfc hound  
to ratify the treaty, if it should not be satisfi­  
ed with thfe substitute for such an article of­  
fered in that note. He asked us, in case  
the treaty should not be ratified, in what  
state our government wished to place the  
relations of the two countries? Wc replied  
that it was its wish that the subject of im­  
pressment should be resumed and arranged :  
we explained to him the nature of the arti­  
cle, on tiie failure of which the negociation  
bad been suspended, and shewed that Great  
Britain would gain by it much more than  
an equivalent for the forbearance of the  
practice of which we complained, indepen­  
dent of the other good effects likely to result  
from it. On this point he gave no opinion,  
hut asked what the relation should be, in case  
no such agreement as we desired should take  
place respecting impressments? We repli­  
ed that, in such a case, it would be the de­  
sire of our government that no treaty should  
be concluded, but that the relation should be  
placed informally on the most friendly foot­  
ing; adhering, in tli ■ explanations which  
we gave him on this head, to the ideas con­  
tained in your letter of February 3d, but  
without mentioning the actual receipt of such  
a letter. He t&gt; lid he was glad to find, that  
o;ir government looked in all events; to a­  
tnicable arrangement. We told him that  
we had not heard from you since the treaty  
had arrived in America; but that full in­  
  
struct ions womrt do-.ibtlesi be forwarded to  
us, as soon after that event as possible. He  
then obseri cd that, tinder present circum­  
stances, he thought it would be better to let  
the v. hole business rest, as it would be im­  
possible lor either party to move in it with  
advantage. He promised, in case the of­  
ficer above mentioned, brought any thing  
material, to inform us of it, and to appoint  
,a time for another interview, which howe­  
\ cr oe lias not ■ ,ncc done, VV c inclose a  
copy of his note of the next day.  
It is impftvsible for 11s to give you a satis­  
factory opinion as to the prospect of arrang­  
ing this important business with the present  
ministry. ^ All the facts on which such an  
opinion should be funned, not previously

This conclusion was thought to be the more  
jubtand natural, when it was remembered that  
it was supported not only by the verbal admis­

knew, be reported to our government, but by  
the language of such parts of the note a* look­

effect; and certainly the sensibility and deter  
mination which have been manifested on this  
point by the United States, especially of late,

the recent negotiation, must have inspired this  
government with the conviction that a perse­

object of the British Commissioners and their
