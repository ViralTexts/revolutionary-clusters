«Sir: While I feel with keenest anguish the late  
dispensation of Divine Providence, I cannot be in-  
sensible to the mournful tributes of respect and ven-  
eration which are paid to the memory of my dear  
deceased husband ; and as his best services and most

truly appreciated and gratefully remembered affords  
no inconsiderable consolation. Taught by the great
