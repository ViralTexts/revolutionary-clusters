red children,  
Washington [ca. 22 August] 1812  
You have come thro’ a long path to see your father but it is a straight and a clean path kept open for my red children who hate crooked walks. I thank the great spirit that he has brought you in health through the long journey; and that he gives us a clear sky &amp; bright sun, for our meeting. I had heard from General Clarke of the good dispositions of several of the nations on &amp; West of the Mississippi; and that they shut their ears to the bad birds hovering about them for some time past. This made me wish to see the principal chiefs of those bands. I love to shake hands with hearts in them.  
The red people who live on the same great Island with the white people of the 18 fires, are made by the great spirit out of the same earth, from parts of it differing in colour only. My regard for all my red children, has made me desirous that the bloody tomahawk should be buried between the Osages, the Cherokees, and the Choctaws. I wish also that the hands of the Shawenoe, &amp; the Osage, should be joined in my presence, as a pledge to cherish &amp; observe the peace made at St. Louis. This was a good peace for both. It is a chain that ought to hold them fast in friendship. Neither blood nor rust should ever be upon it.  
I am concerned at the war which has long been kept up by the Sacs &amp; Foxes agst. the Osages; and that latterly a bloody war is carried on between the Osages &amp; Ioways. I now tell my red children now present, that this is bad for both parties. They must put under my feet their evil intentions agst. one another; and henceforward live in peace &amp; good will; each hunting on their own lands, and working their own soils.  
Your father loves justice. He extends it to all the red tribes. When they keep the chain of friendship with the 18 fires, bright, he will protect them, and do them good. If any make the chain bloody, it must be broken on their heads. The Winibagoes and some other tribes, between the Mississippi &amp; Lake Michigan &amp; the Wabash, have shut their ears to my councils. They have killed men, women and children, and have plundered the white people. They refuse to give up the murderers, and to return the stolen property. Time enough has been allowed them. When they feel the punishment, they must blame their own folly, and the bad councils to which they have listened. I will not suffer my white children to be killed without punishing the murderers.  
A father ought to give good advice to his children, and it is the duty of his children to harken to it. The people composing the 18 fires, are a great people. You have travelled thro’ their Country; you see they cover the land, as the stars fill the sky, and are thick as the Trees in your forests. Notwithstanding their great power, the British King has attacked them on the great water beyond which he lives. He robbed their ships, and carried away the people belonging to them. Some of them he murdered. He has an old grudge against the 18 fires, because when he tried to make them dig and plant for his people beyond the great water, not for themselves, they sent out warriors who beat his warriors, they drove off the bad chiefs he had sent among them, and set up good chiefs of their own. The 18 fires did this when they had not the strength they now have. Their blows will now be much heavier, and will soon make him do them justice. It happened when the 13 fires, now increased to 18 forced the British King, to treat them as an independent nation, one little fire did not join them. This he has held ever since. It is there that his agents and traders plot quarrels and wars between the 18 fires and their red brethren, and between one red tribe and another. Malden is the place where all the bad birds have their nests. There they are fed with false tales agst. the 18 fires, and sent out with bloody belts in their bills, to drop among the red people, who would otherwise remain at peace. It is for the good of all the red people, as well as the people of the 18 fires, that a stop should be put to this mischief. Their warriors can do it. They are gone &amp; going to Canada for this purpose. They want no help from their red brethren. They are strong enough without it. The British, who are weak, are doing all they can by their bad birds, to decoy the red people into the war on their side. I warn all the red people to avoid the ruin this must bring upon them. And I say to you my children, your father does not ask you to join his warriors. Sit still on your seats; and be witnesses that they are able to beat their enemies and protect their red friends. This is the fatherly advice I give you.  
I have a further advice for my red children. You see how the Country of the 18 fires is filled with people. They increase like the corn they put into the ground. They all have good houses to shelter them from all weathers; good clothes suitable to all seasons; and as for food of all sorts, you see they have enough &amp; to spare. No man woman or child of the 18 fires ever perished of hunger. Compare all this with the condition of the red people. They are scattered here &amp; there in handfuls. Their lodges are cold, leaky, and smokey. They have hard fare, and often not eno’ of it. Why this mighty difference? The reason, my red children, is plain. The white people breed cattle and sheep. They plow the earth and make it give them every thing they want. They spin and weave. Their heads, and their hands make all the elements &amp; productions of nature useful to them. Above all; the people of the 18 fires live in constant peace &amp; friendship. No Tomahawk has ever been raised by one agst. another. Not a drop of blood has ever touched the Chain that holds them together as one family. All their belts are white belts. It is in your power to be like them. The ground that feeds one Lodge, by hunting, would feed a great band, by the plow &amp; the hoe. The great spirit has given you, like your white brethren, good heads to contrive; strong arms, and active bodies. Use them like your white brethren; not all at once, which is difficult but by little &amp; little, which is easy. Especially live in peace with one another, like your white brethren of the 18 fires: and like them, your little sparks will grow into great fires. You will be well fed; well cloathed; dwell in good houses, and enjoy the happiness, for which you like them, were created. The great spirit is the friend of men of all colours. He made them to be friends of one another. The more they are so the more he will be their friend. These are the words of your father, to his red children. The great spirit, who is the father of us all, approves them. Let them pass through the ear, into the heart. Carry them home to your people. And as long as you remember this visit to your father of the 18 fires; remember these as his last &amp; best words to you.  
As we cannot always see one another, the distance being great, My words from time to time will be delivered by General Clarke and others who may be near you. Your words will always come to me through the same hands. I hope they will always be good words

ter them from all weathers; good clothes suitable to

They are scattered here and there in hancfuls. Their

your white brethren, good heads to contrive; strong  
arms and active bodies. Use them like your white  
brethren; not all at once, whieh is difficult, but by  
little and little, which is easy. Especially, live in  
peace with one another, like your white brethren af  
the eighteen fires; and like them, your little sparks  
will grow into great fires. You will be well fed, well  
clothed, dwell in good houses, and enjoy the happi-  
ness for which you, like them, were created. The  
Great Spirit is the friend of men of all colors. He  
made them to be friends of one another. The more  
they areso, the more }:2 will be their friend. These  
are the words of your father to hisred children. The  
Great Spirit, who is the father of us all, approves  
them. Let them pass through the car, into the heart.  
Carry them home to your people. And as long as  
you remember this visit to your father of the eigh-  
teen fires, re:znember these are his last and best words  
to you.

My nep cwirores: You hsve come

is o straight and o clean path, kept apen for  
my red children, who Nats crocked walks—.  
I thank the Great Spirit thet he has brought  
you in heslth through the long journcy ; and  
that he gives us 8 clear sky snd bright sua for  
our meeting. I had heard from gen. Clarke  
of the good dispositions of severs! of the na­  
tions on and west of the Mississippi ; snd that  
they shut their ears to the bad birds hovering  
sbout them for some time past. This made  
me wish 10 ree the principal chiels of those  
bands. I love to shake hands wirn hesris in  
them.  
  
The red people, who live on the same great  
island with the white peopie of the eighteen  
fires, are meade by the Grest Spirit out of the  
same earth, from parts of ity differing in color  
on&#x27;y. My regard for all my red childien has  
arade me desirous that the bloody tomabawk  
should be buried between the Ossges, the  
Chetokers, and the Choctaws. 1 wish also  
that the hands of the Shawnese and the Osage  
should be juined in my presence, as » pledge  
to cherish and observe the peace modo at Si,  
Louis. This was a good peace for both. It  
is a chan that ought to hold ihem fast in fiiend  
ship. Neither blood nor ruet shouid ever be  
upon it,  
I arh concerned at (A war which has leng  
been kept up by the bSacs and Foxes against  
ihe Osages; and that latterly a bioody war is  
cariied on between the Osages and Toweys, |  
now tell iy red children here present that  
this is bad for both parties. They must put  
under my feei their evil intentions epainst  
each other; and hencelorward live 1p peace  
and good will ; each hunting on their own  
lends, and working their own soil.  
  
Your father loves justice, lle extends it |  
to all the red tribes., When they koep the |  
chsin of [riendship with the eighteen fires  
bright, he will protect them, and do them  
good. Il eny meke the chain bloody, it must  
be hroken on their heads. The Winebagoes  
and some other tribes berween the Mississip.  
pi end lake Michigan snd the Wabash, have  
shiut their cars 10 my counsels. They have  
killed men, women and childsen ; and have  
plundered the white people. They refuse to  
give up the murderers, and to return the sto­  
len property. Time enengh has been allow­  
ed them ; when they feel the punishment, they  
must blame their own folly end the bad coun­  
sels to which they ‘have listened. 1 will not  
sufler my white children to be killed without  
punishing the murderers. :  
A father ought 1o give gond sdvice to his  
children ; end it is.the du&#x27;y of his childien to  
heatken to it. The people composing the

good houses to shelier them from 01l weath­

leeky and smokey. They have ha+d fare, and  
ofien not enough ol it. Why thismigh&#x27;y dil

them together as one family. All their belts

regard for all my red children has made me desirous, that the

Shawnese and the Osage should be joined in my presence, as a  
pledge to cherish and observe the peace made at St Louis.  
This was a good peace for both. It is a chain that ought to hold  
them fast in friendship. Neither blood nor rust should ever be  
upon it.  
  
‘I am concerned at the war which has long been kept up by  
the Sacs and Foxes against the Osages; and that latterly a bloody  
war is carried on between the Osages and loways. I now tell my  
red children here present, that this is bad for both parties. They  
must put under my feet their evil intentions against each other ;  
and henceforward live in peace and good will; each hunting on  
their lands, and working their own soil.’

do them justice, It happened when the thirteen fires, now in-  
creased to eighteen, forced the British king to treat them as an  
independent nation, one little fire did not join them. This he  
has held ever since. It is there that his agents and traders plot  
quarrels and wars between the eighteen fires and their brethren,  
and between one red tribe and another. Malden is the place  
where all the bad birds have their nests. There they are fed with  
false tales against the eighteen fires, and sent out with bloody  
belts in their bills, to drop among the red people, who would oth-  
erwise remain at peace. It is for the good of all the red people,  
as well as the people of the eighteen fires, that a stop should be  
put to this mischief. Their warriors can do it. ‘They are gone  
and going to Canada for this purpose. ‘They want no help from  
their red brethren. They are strong enough without it. The  
British, who are weak, are doing all they can by their bad birds,  
to decoy the red people into the war on their side. I warn all  
the red people to avoid the ruin this must bring upon them. And  
I say to you, my children, your father does not ask you to join  
his warriors. Sit still on your seats; and be witnesses that they  
are able to beat their enemies, and protect their red friends.  
This is the fatherly advice I give you.  
  
‘[ have a further advice for my red children. You see how  
the country of the eighteen fires is filled with people. They in-  
crease like the corn they put into the ground. They all have  
good houses to shelter them from all weathers; good clothes suit-  
able to all seasons ; and as for food of all sorts, you see they have  
enough, and to spare. No man, woman, or child, of the eighteen  
fires ever perished of hunger. -Compare all this with the condi-  
tion of the red people. ‘They are scattered here and there in  
handfuls. Their lodges are cold, leaky, and smoky. They have  
hard fare, and often not enough of it.  
  
‘Why this mighty difference? The reason, my red children,  
is plain. ‘The white people breed cattle and sheep. They plough  
the earth, and make it give them every thing they want. They  
spin and weave. ‘Their heads and their hands make all the ele-  
ments and productions of nature useful to them. Above all, the  
people of the eighteen fires live in constant peace and friendship.  
No tomahawk has ever been raised by one against another. Not  
a drop of blood has ever touched the chain that holds them to-  
gether as one family. All their belts are white belts. It is in  
your power to be like them. The ground that feeds one lodge  
by hunting, would feed a great band by the plough and the hoe.  
The Great Spirit has given you, like your white brethren, good  
heads to contrive, strong arms, and active bodies. Use them like  
your white brethren ; not all at once, which is difficult, but by

the Cherokees, and the Choctaws. I wish al­  
so that the hands of the ,Shawnese and the  
Osage should be joined in iny presence, as a  
pledge to cherish and observe the peace made  
at St Louis. This was a good peace for both  
It is a certain chain that ought to hold them  
fast m friendship. Neither blood nor rust  
should ever be upon it.  
“ I am concerned at the war which has long  
been kept up between the Sacs and Foxes a­  
gainst the Osagts, and that latterly a bloody­  
war is curried on between the Osages and Io­  
ways. I now teil my ted Children here pre­  
sent that this is bad for both parties They  
must put under my feet their evil intentions  
against earh other; and henceforward lire in  
peace and good will; each hunting on their  
lands and working th ir own soil.  
“A father ofight to give good advice to his  
children, and it is the duty of his children to  
hearken to i&#x27;.. The People composing the  
eighteen fires, are a great People. You have  
travelled through their country. You see they  
cover live land as the stars fill the sky, and are  
as thick as the trees in your forests. Notwith­  
standing their great power, the British King  
has attacked them on ihe great water beyond  
which he lives. He robbed their ships and cai­  
ried away the people belonging to them. Some  
of them he murdered. He has an old grudge  
against the eighteen fires, because when he tried  
.__i.„ ,i...... ,1;.* .n/i . i• r&gt;... i.;. i...  
  
vond the great water, not for themselves, they  
sent out warriors who beat his warriors; they  
drove ofi* the bad chiefs he had sent among  
them, and set up good chiefs of their own. The  
eighteen fires did this when they had not the  
strength they now Itave. Their blows will now  
be much heavier, and will soon make him do  
them justice. It happened when the thirteen  
fires, now increased to eighteen, forced the Bri­  
tish K.ing to treat them as an independent na­  
tion. One little fire did not join them. This  
he has held ever since. It is there that his a­  
gents and traders plot quarerels and wars be­  
tween the eighteen fires and their brethren,and  
between one red tribe and another. Malden is  
the place where all the I.ad birds have their nests.  
There they are fed wish false tales against ihe  
eighteen fires, and sent out with the bloody belts  
in their bills, to drop dmong the Rrd People,  
who would otherwise remain at peace. It is  
for the good of all the Red People, as well as  
the People of the eighteen fires, that a stop  
should be pul to this mischief. Their warriors  
can do it. They arc- gone and g*ing to Canada  
fur this purpose. They want no help from their  
Red brethren They are strong enough  
without it. The British, who are weak, are  
doing all thry can, by their bad birds, to decoy  
»the Red People, into the war 011 their side. I  
warn all the Red People to avoid the rum this  
must bring upon them. And I say to you, my i  
children, your father docs not ask you to join  
his warriors. Sit still on your seals, and be 1  
witnesses that they are able to beat their ene­  
mies, and protect their Red friends. This it  
the fatherly advice I give you.  
“ I have a further advice for my Red chil­  
dren. You see how the country of the eighteen  
fires is filled with People. They increase like  
the corn they put into the ground. They all  
have good houses to shelter them from all wea­  
thers; good clothes suitable to all seasons; and,  
as for food of all sorts, you see they have  
enough, and to spare. No man, woman, or  
child, of the eighteen fires ever perished of  
  
lunger. Compare all this with the conditior  
if the Red People. They are scattered here  
and there, in handfulls. Their lodges are cold,  
leaky, and smoky. They have hard fare, and  
often not enough of it.  
“Why this mighty difference? The reason  
my red children, is plain. The white Prople  
breed cattle and sheep. They plough the ear?;,  
and make it give them every thing they vw&#x27;  
They spin and weave. Their heads andhandi  
make all the elements and productions of ni.  
lure useful to them. Above all, the people c:  
the eighteen fires live in constant peace amj  
friendship. No tomahawk has ever 6e.n rai­  
sed by one against another. Not a drop of blood  
has even touched th- chain that holds then to-?,  
theras one family. All their belts are v.In.,  
belts. It is in your power to be like their.  
The ground that feeds one lodge by hunting  
would feed a great hand by the plough andtht  
hoe. The Great Spirit has given you, like &gt;our  
white brethren, good heads to contrive, vti\.u&lt;  
arms and active bodies, bsc them hk1, vour  
white brethren: not all at oner; which is’ilif.

like them, your little sparks will grow into  
great fires. You will be well fed; Welf dollied;

for which you like them were created. Ths  
Great Spirit is the friend of men of all color;  
lie made them to he the frie.J* of one ano&#x27;M:  
The mote they are so, the more he will be

Tiie Red People who live on the same great  
Island with the white People of the eicrhteen  
fires, are made by the Great Spirit: out of the  
same earth, from parts of it differing in coW on  
ly. My regard for all my red children has made  
me desirous that the bloody tomahawk should be  
buried between the Osages, the Cherpkees,&quot; and  
the Choctaws. 1 wish also that trie hands of the  
Shawnese and the Osage;should be joined in rqy  
presence, as a pledge to clierish arid observe the  
peace made at St. .Louis. . This w as a good peace&#x27;  
for both. It is a chain that ought to holdAhem  
fast in friendships Neither blood nor rust should  
ever be upon it. - . , . . ... &#x27;  
I Am concerned at the war which has long  
been kept up by the Sacs and Foxes against tlie  
Osages ; and that latterly a bloody war is carried  
on between the Osages and loways. I now tell  
my red children here present, that this is bad  
for both parties. They must put under my feet  
their evil intentions against each other ; and  
henceforward lit e in peace and good will ; each  
hunting on their lands, and working their own

then fires did this when they had not the strength  
they now have. Their blows will now be much
