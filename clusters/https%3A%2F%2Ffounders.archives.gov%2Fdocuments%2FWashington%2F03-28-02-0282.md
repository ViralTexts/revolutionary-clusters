My dear Laurens  
Hd Qrs Passaic Falls 13th Oct. 1780.  
  
Your friendly &amp; Affectione letter of the 4th came to my hands on the 10th &amp; would have been acknowledged yesterday by the Baron de Steuben but for some important business I was preparing for Congress.  
In no instance since the commencement of the War has the interposition of Providence appeared more conspicuous than in the rescue of the Post &amp; Garrison of West point from Arnolds villainous perfidy. How far he meant to involve me in the catastrophe of this place does not appear by any indubitable evidence—and I am rather inclined to think he did not wish to hazard the more important object of his treachery by attempting to combine two events the lesser of which might have marred the greater.  
A combination of extraordinary circumstances—An unaccountable deprivation of presence of Mind in a man of the first abilities—and the virtuous conduct of three Militia men—threw the Adjutant General of the British forces in America (wi⟨th⟩ full proofs of Arnolds treachery) in to our hands—and but for the egregious folly—or the bewildered conception of Lieutt Colo. Jameson who seemed lost in astonishment and not to have known what he was doing I should as certainly have got Arnold.  
André has met his fate—and with that fortitude which was to be expected from an accomplished Man—and gallant Officer—But I am mistaken if at this time, Arnold is undergoing the torments of a mental Hell. He wants feeling! From some traits of his character which have lately come to my knowledge he seems to have been so hackneyed in villainy—&amp; so lost to all sense of honor and shame that while his faculties will enable him to contin⟨ue⟩ his sordid pursuits there will be no time for remorse.
