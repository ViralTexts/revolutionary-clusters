Dear Sir  
[24 Jan. 1791]  
  
I return you the report on the mint which I have read over with a great deal of satisfaction. I concur with you in thinking that the unit must stand on both metals, that the alloy should be the same in both, also in the proportion you establish between the value of the two metals. As to the question on whom the expence of coinage is to fall, I have been so little able to make up an opinion satisfactory to myself as to be ready to concur in either decision. With respect to the dollar, it must be admitted by all the world that there is great incertainty in the meaning of the term, and therefore all the world will have justified Congress for their act of removing the incertainty by declaring what they understood by the term. But the incertainty once removed, exists no longer, and I very much doubt a right now to change the value, and especially to lessen it. It would lead to so easy a mode of paying off their debts. Besides, the parties injured by this reduction of the value would have so much matter to urge in support of the first point of fixation. Should it be thought however that Congress may reduce the value of the dollar I should then be for adopting for our unit, instead of the dollar, either one ounce of pure silver, or one ounce of standard silver, so as to keep the unit of money a part of the system of measures, weights and coins. I hazard these thoughts to you extempore and am dear Sir respectfully &amp; affectionately  
  
Th: Jefferson  
  
  
I enclose you two letters just received from F

the Cheap Hollar.  
In a note on the establishment of a  
mint Thomas Jefferson in 1791 wrote as  
follows:  
The proportion between the value of gold  
and silver Is a mercantile problem altogether.  
* • * Just principles will lead us to disregard  
legal proportions altogether, to inquire into  
the market price of gold in the several coun­  
tries with which we shall principally be con­  
nected in commerco and to take an average  
from them.  
In a letter to Mr. Hamilton in Febru­  
ary, 1792, Mr. Jefferson expressed his  
opposition to cheapening the dollar or  
reducing the monetary unit. He said of  
the dollar:  
I very much doubt a right now to change  
the value and especially to lessen it. It would  
lead to bo easy a mode of paying off their debts.  
* * * Should it be thought, however, that con­  
gress may reduce tho value of thu dollar, I  
should be for adopting for our unit, instead of  
the dollar, either one ounce of pure silver or  
one ounce of standard silver, so as to keep the  
unit of money a part of tho system of meas­  
ures, weights and coins
