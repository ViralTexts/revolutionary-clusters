. He has before him the Example of a Predecessor whose incessant Toils brought only an Encrease of laborious Care, whose Anxieties wore away the Web of his Existence, and whose mighty Projects were but “the baseless Fabric of a Vision”. The Germanic Body itself is distracted between the Duty of supporting it’s Members and Dread of destroying the check upon it’s Chief.  
This unhappy Country, bewildered in the Pursuit of metaphysical whimsies, presents to our moral View a mighty Ruin. Like the Remnants of antient Magnificence we admire the Architecture of the Temple, while we detest the false God to whom it was dedicated. Daws and Ravens and the Birds of Night now  
  
build their Nests in its Niches. The Sovereign humbled to the Level of a Beggar’s Pity, without Resources, without Authority, without a Friend. The Assembly at once a Master and a Slave. New in Power wild in Theory raw in Practice, it engrosses all Functions tho incapable of exercising any, and has taken from this fierce ferocious People every Restraint of Religion and of Respect. Sole Executors of the Law and therefore supreme Judges of its Propriety each District measures out its Obedience by its Wishes and the great Interests of the whole split up into fractional Morsels depend on momentary Impulse and ignorant Caprice. Such a State of Things cannot last.  
But how will it end? Here Conjecture may wander thro unbounded Space. What Sum of Misery may be requisite to change the popular Will, Calculation cannot determine. What Circumstances may arise in the order of divine Providence to give Direction to that Will, our sharpest Vision cannot discover. What Talents may be found to seize those Circumstances, to influence that Will, and above all to moderate the Power which it must confer, we are equally ignorant. One Thing only seems to be tolerably ascertained: that the glorious Opportunity is lost, and (for this Time at least) the Revolution has failed. In the Consequences of it we may however find some Foundations of future Prosperity. Such are 1st the Abolition of those different Rights and Privileges which kept the Provinces asunder, occasioning thereby a Variety of Taxation, increasing the Expences of Collection, impeding the useful Communications of Commerce, and destroying that Unity in the System of distributive Justice, which is one Requisite to social Happiness. 2ly The Abolition of feudal Tyranny by which the Tenure of real Property is simplified the Value reduced to Money Rent is more clearly ascertained, and the Estimation which depended upon idle Vanity or capricious Taste or sullen Pride is destroyed. 3ly The Extention of the Circle of Commerce to those vast Possessions held by the Clergy in Mortmain, which conferring great Wealth as the Wages of Idleness, damped the Ardor of Enterprize and impaired that steady Industry which increase the Stock of national Riches. 4ly The Destruction of a System of venal Jurisprudence, which arrogating a Kind of legislative Veto, had established the Pride and Privileges of the few on the Misery and Degradation of the general Mass. 5ly Above all the Promulgation and Extension of  
  
the Principles of Liberty which will I hope remain to chear the Heart, and cherish a Nobleness of Soul, when the metaphisic Froth and Vapor shall have been blown away. The Awe of that Spirit which has been thus raised will I trust excite in those who may hereafter possess Authority, a proper Moderation in the Exercise, and induce them to give to this People a real Constitution of Government fitted to the natural, moral, social, and political State of their Country.  
How and when these Events may be brought about I know not. But I think from the Chaos of Opinion, and the Conflict of its jarring Elements a new order will at length arise which is in some Degree the Child of Chance, may not be less productive of human Happiness t

expenses of collection, impeding the  
useful communication of commerce,  
and destroying that unity in the sys-  
tem of distributive justice which is  
one requisite to social happiness.

by which the tenure of real property  
is simplified, the value reduced to  
money,rent is more clearly ascertained,  
and the estimation which depended  
upon idle vanity, or capricious taste,  
or sullen pride, is destroyed. (3). The  
extension of the circle of commerce to  
those vast possessions held by the  
clergy in mortmain, which, conferring  
great wealth as the wages of idleness,  
damped the ardour of enterprise, and  
impaired that ready industry which  
increases the stock of national riches.

venal jurisprudence, which, arrogating

promulgation and extension of those  
principles of liberty, which will, I  
hope, remain to cheer the heart and  
cherish a nobleness of soul when the  
metaphysical froth and vapour shall

raw in practice. ‘It engrosses all func-

and has taken from this fierce, ferocious  
people every restraint of religion and of  
respect. Sole executors of the law, and  
therefore supreme judges of its propriety,  
each district measures out its obedience

“(1) The abolition of those different  
rights and privileges which kept the prov-  
inces asunder, occasioning thereby a va-  
riety of taxation, increasing the expenses  
of collection, impeding the useful commu-  
nication of commerce, and destroying  
that unity in the system of distributive  
justice which is one requisite to social  
happiness. (2) The abolition of feudal  
tyranny, by which the tenure of real prop-  
erty is simplified, the value reduced to  
money, rent is more clearly ascertained,  
and the estimation which depended upon  
idle vanity, or capricious taste, or sullen  
pride, is destroyed. (3) The extension  
of the circle of commerce to those vast  
possessions held by the clergy in mort-  
main, which, conferring great wealth as  
the wages of idleness, damped the ardor  
of enterprise, and impaired that ready in-  
dustry which increases the stock of na-  
tional riches. (4) The destruction of a  
system of venal jurisprudence, which, ar-  
rogating a kind of legislative veto, had  
established the pride and privileges of the  
few on the misery and degradation of the  
general mass. (5) Above all, the pro-  
mulgation and extension of those princi-  
ples of liberty, which will, 1 hope, remain  
to cheer the heart and cherish a noble-  
ness of soul when the metaphysical froth  
and vapor shall have been blown away.  
The awe of that spirit which has been  
thus raised will, I trust, excite in those  
who may hereafter possess authority a  
proper moderation in its exercise, and  
induce them to give to this people a real  
constitution of government fitted to the  
natural, moral, social, and political state  
of their country.”

Divine will to give direction to that will, our sharpest vision

circumstances to influence that will, and, above all, to  
moderate the power which it must confer, we are equally
