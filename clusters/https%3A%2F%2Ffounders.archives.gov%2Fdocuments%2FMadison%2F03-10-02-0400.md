, April 17th. 1816.  
  
The Secretary of State, to whom was referred the Resolution of the House of Representatives, requesting the President to cause to be laid before that House information relative to the duties laid on Articles imported from the United States into the British Provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick; relative to the Duties on Articles exported to  
  
the United States from the said Provinces; the duties laid on Goods, Wares, and Merchandise, imported into the British West India Islands, or any of them, from the United States, or from Colonies in America owned by other foreign European Powers; and, likewise, as to the Duties on imports and exports to which vessels of the United States are subject in the Ports of the British East Indies; has the honor to state, that, as the information received by the Department, on the subject of these inquiries, since the Peace, from Public Agents, has been very defective, he has been under the necessity of resorting to the Collectors of the Customs, and other respectable sources, within the reach of the Department, to enable him to comply with the Call of the House, which produced inevitable delay in making this Report. He begs leave further to state, that the accompanying tables, numbered 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. and 6. embrace all the information that he has been able to obtain relative to the objects of the Resolution. It is believed that it is substantially correct, though less particular and precise than might be wished. From these tables it will be seen, that the vessels of the United States are excluded from all participation in the trade, by sea, of the provincial or colonial possessions of Great Britain in America, with the exception of Bermuda and the Bahama Islands, where they are restricted to a very limited Commerce, particularly designated in the table numbered 4. It will be moreover seen, that this trade is confined exclusively to British vessels, and, in most instances, to British merchants, and articles of minor value as respects both imports and exports. Whether, under the existing Regulations in Canada, the trade by inland navigation between the United States and those Provinces is confined to British Vessels, is not distinctly understood. Respectfully submitted.

[Enclosure]  
Table No. 1. Information relative to the Duties laid on Articles imported from the United States into the British Province of Canada.  
On the 29th of May, 1815, the intercourse between the United States and Canada was regulated by an order in Council, in Canada, of that date.  
This order directs, “That duties shall be paid and collected on all Goods and Commodities imported from the United States, agreeably to the following Tariff,[“] viz:  
All kinds of wood and lumber, seeds and grain of every sort, all kinds of provisions, and live stock, flour, pot, and pearl ashes, furs, skins, pig iron, and tallow, may be imported, duty free—

All other articles of the growth, produce, or manufacture, of the United States, shall pay a duty of 10 per cent. ad valorem, over and above such duties as are chargeable by law.⟨*⟩  
*It is understood that this tariff of duties was to continue until April 1816. It is now stated that the above Order in Council is no longer in force; and that the produce and [manufactures of foreign countries are not admitted into Canada from the United States; and that all manufactures or produce of the United States which are admitted, except provisions, pay a duty of thirty-three] and one-third per cent.

Horses, neat Cattle, Sheep, Hogs, Poultry, Boards, Heading, Hoops, Planks, Scantling, Shingles, and squared Timber, are admitted

10 pr. ct. ad val.  
  
  
Note. No American Vessel is now admitted into Nova Scotia or New Brunswick. The Governors of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia are empowered to permit the introduction into those Colonies, by Proclamation, of certain Articles. Such Proclamations have been always issued every three months: The last was issued on the 6th of February 1816, and authorizes  
  
British subjects to import into Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, from the United States, in British built Ships or vessels, owned and navigated agreeably to the laws of Great Britain, for the space of three months from the date, the articles mentioned in the preceding Table.

Note. The preceding are the principal articles which are the growth, produce, or manufacture, of Nova Scoti⟨a,⟩ and New Brunswick, and which are exported from those colonies to the United States. All articles are permitted to be thence exported to the United States, except salt-petre and munitions of war. On the articles exported, which are the products of Great Britain or her other colonies, there is a duty imposed, on their importation into the provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswic⟨k⟩ of five per cent. which is nearly all drawn back when the go⟨ods⟩ are exported to the United States. There are a few articles, however, which are an exception to this rule: Rum, if imported into the colony, being, to the amount of two-thirds of its value, bought with the produce of the colony, pays 20 per cent. and has a drawback of 18. Rum otherwise bought pays 25 per cent. and has a drawback of 22 per cent. Sugar, if purchased as the first mentioned rum, pays 70 per cent. and has a drawback of 59 per cent. All other sugar pays 120 per cent. and has a drawback of 109 per cent. Coffee, if purchased, also to the amount of two-thirds of its value, with the produce of the colony, pays 2 cents per lb. and has a drawback of 2 cents. Other coffee pays 4 cents, and has a drawback of 3 cents 6 ⅔ mills. Molasses pays 2 cents per gallon, and has a drawback of 8 ⅓ mills. Wines pay 40 cents per gallon, and have a drawback of 34 cents. Gin pays 34 cents per gallon, and has a drawback of 29 cents. Brandy the same duty and drawback. There is, besides, what is called a king’s duty on wine, from the Islands, of 15 dollars per pipe, and from Great Britain and ports in the Mediterranean not French, of 244 cents per pipe. In the year 1815, the Government of Nova Scotia laid a duty of a dollar per ton on plaster of Paris, landed to the northward and westward of Cape Cod. Recently, a duty of 4 dollars per ton has been  
  
imposed by the Government of New Brunswick on plaster of Paris landed in the United States north of Cape Cod.

Note. The trade of Jamaica, to and from the United States, according to recent British regulations, is to be carried on ⟨in British vessels only, and⟩ the articles admitted ⟨into that island must be the property of British subjects and carried⟩ in British vessels only, and British subjects. The importation of the product⟨s⟩ of the United States from other colonies in the West Indie⟨s⟩ is not allowed. Every description of fish is prohibited admission  
  
into the Island of Jamaica. Rum, molasses, and pim⟨ento⟩ alone, can be exported therefrom, paying a duty of 10 pr. cent. ad valorem.  
At present vessels of the United States are not allowed to import into the Island of Tobago any kind of merchandise whatever, nor to go there in ballast and bri⟨n⟩g away cargoes of any sort.  
Lumber and provisions have been recently permi⟨t⟩ted to be imported into Antigua, from the United Sta⟨tes,⟩ in British vessels.  
Generally speaking, since the peace, vessel⟨s⟩ of the United States have been prohibited an entry at all the British West India Islands. Into Bermuda, which, strictly speaking, is not regarded as on⟨e⟩ of the West Indies, vessels of the United States may carry flour, rice, corn, and lumber, upon paying a duty of 5 ½ per cent. Rum, sugar, molasses, and salt, may be exported on paying a duty of 5 per cent. Port charges, about 20 dollars. No tonnage or light money. But Bermuda is a mere place of entrepôt, at which the United States have little or no trade.  
From the Bahamas, American vessels were, by proclamation of the Governor, on the 15 th of April last, excluded, unless they resorted to the ports of those Islands in ballast, for the purpose of loading with salt: In that case they are required to pay a King’s tonnage of 2s6d sterling per ton, and a colonial tonnage of 20 cents per ton: Also, an export duty of a half penny sterling ⟨on⟩ each bushel of salt. At this time no kind of salt⟨ed⟩ provisions is permitted to an entry in the Baham⟨as from⟩ the United States. Flour and corn pay no duty. Ric⟨e,⟩ bread, peas, and lumber, pay a duty of 5 per cent⟨, of⟩ from the United States. There is no export duty ⟨on⟩ articles exported in British Vessels, excepting Br⟨azil⟩letto, which pays 1 dollar and 25 cents per ton.  
As to the Newfoundland trade, it may ⟨be⟩ proper to mention, that it is understood to be rest⟨ricted⟩ to the colonies and the mother country by act ⟨of⟩ parliament; but that licenses are grante⟨d by⟩ the king’s council in Great Britain, permit⟨ting⟩ certain persons in certain British Vessels, t⟨o be⟩ named in the license, to import into the col⟨ony,⟩ direct from the United States, bread, flour, ⟨corn,⟩ rice, and live stock. Fish of all kinds, oil, and ⟨the⟩ produce of Great Britain, can be exported from Newfoundland, into the United States, in British vessels only.  
Table No. 5. Information relative to Duties laid on Goods, Wares, and Merchandise, imported into the British West India Islands, or any of them, from the United States, through Colonies in America, owned by other foreign European Powers, &amp;c.  
The information received in relation to this point leads to the general impression, that the importation of the products of the United States into  
  
the British West Indies, from other foreign Colonies in that quarter, is not, at this time, allowed. As far as it regards the island of Jamaica, it has been distinctly stated, from an authentic source, that the Governor’s Proclamation, permitting the importation of the productions of the United States from the Spanish, or other neutral, colonies, having expired on the 30th of November last, the importation is prohibited in any other than a direct manner; and that, as will be seen in table numbered 3, must be in British vessels only. When the products of the United States were admitted, from the other European Colonies in America, into Jamaica, the duties were the same as if they had been imported direct from the United States.  
As to duties laid in the British West India Islands on goods, wares, and merchandise, other than those of the United States, when imported from Colonies in America owned by other foreign European Powers, the Department of State is not furnished with any information.

  Imports.  
  
Duties.  
  
  
The articles usually imported into Calcutta and Bombay from the United States, are Brandy and Hollands Gin, which pay  
25 cents per Gallon.  
  
  
Naval stores, spars, and Wines, which pay  
20 per ct. advalorem.  
  
  
Note. The preceding particulars have been communicated from one source: from another, a general Remark has been made, that all Articles from the United States imported into Bengal, are subject to a 20 per cent. duty, except Naval Stores, which pay i0 per cent. This duty is paid on a valuation of the articles as they are landed from the Vessels. The duty on tonnage is not precisely known. On one hand it is represented to be not exceeding one per cent. on the value of the vessel. On the other, it is said that American vessels pay more than double the duties that the English do, both on Imports and Exports, and double pilotage; and that the British Ships in the East India Colonies have an advantage over those of the United States of at least ten per cent. on imports and exports. On the 15th of last September, it is said, new Regulations with regard to Duties on imports and exports were published in Calcutta, which places British vessels on a still more favorable footing than they were before, compared with foreign vessels. The port charges are alleged to be very expensive at Calcutta, amounting to about 2 ½ per cent. on the articles exported from thence to the United States, exclusive of brokerage and Commission, which amount to about 2 ½ per cent. more. Of the  
  
  
  
  Exports.  
  
Duti⟨es.⟩  
  
  
  
Assafotida, Coffee, Cotton and silk Goods, Drugs and Medicines, Ginger, the Gums Arabic, Senegal, and Copal; Sal Ammoniac, Sugar and Turmerick, pay  
7 ½ pr. ⟨centum ad valorem.⟩  
  
  
Indigo pays, per cent.  
378 ½ ce⟨nts per cwt.⟩  
  
  
English ships, it is stated, receive a dra⟨w⟩back on silk Goods and Indigo, of five per ⟨centum.⟩  
By a recent arrival from India, inf⟨orma⟩tion has been received, that all Goods th⟨ere im⟩ported, under the American flag, pay a ⟨duty⟩ of 20 per cent. on the Invoice, naval sto⟨res ex⟩cepted, which pay 10; under the British f⟨lag,⟩ 2 ½. All silk Goods, and cotton piece Goods, ⟨made⟩ in the Territories entirely subject to the In⟨dia⟩ Company, pay 7 ½ per cent. on a valuati⟨on⟩ made by the Collector at the port of exp⟨orta⟩tion; the British flag nothing, and is, per⟨haps,⟩ allowed some drawback. On cotton G⟨oods⟩ made in Districts not entirely subjec⟨t to⟩ British Power, the American flag is allowed a drawback of 2 ½ per cent. But it is represented that there is so much difficulty attending the passing the Goods when the drawback is Claimed, that it is often relinquished. The British flag receives a drawback of 7 ½ per cent. Dollars are now taxed at the mint 2 ½ per cent. and will not, probably, sell for more hereafter than 2 ½ per cent. profit.  
With respect to Imports into the Cape of Good Hope, and the Isles of France and Bourbon, from the United States, it is understood that Naval Stores, Provisions, Brandy, Wines, Fish, Flour, Gin, and Specie, pay a duty of 6 per cent. ad valorem. The exports from those places to the United States, are Cotton, Cloves, saltpetre, coffee, sugar, pepper, spices, and hides, which are subject to a duty of 1 ½ per cent advalorem.  
From Batavia, Manilla, and Sumatra, the articles of export are Sugar, Coffee, Camphor, spices, Cotton, Indigo, and pepper, the duties on which are varied at the pleasure of the Governor, according to the demands for the Current expenses of the different Colonies. No tariff has been received. Nothing but Specie is exported from the United States to those places

Report.  
The sec* tary of state, to whom was  
referred the resolution of the house &lt;&gt;:  
representa ives. requesting the presi­  
dent to cause to he laid before that house  
information relative to the duties laid on  
articles imported from the United States,  
into the British provinces ot Canada,  
Nova-Scotia. and New Brunswick, re  
lative to the duties on articles exporter  
t. the United State from the said pro­  
vinces $ tHe duties laid on goods, wares  
and merchandize, imported into the Bri­  
ii&gt;h VVest-India islands, or any of them  
from the United States, or from colonies  
in America owned by ot or foreign Eu  
&quot;opean powers ; and likewise, as to the  
lutieson imports &amp; exports to which ves­  
$ Is of he United States are subje t i.&gt;  
the ports of the British East Indies :  
has the honor to state, that as the infor­  
oation received bv the depa tment, on  
the subieci of the inqui ies, since the  
  
*eaee. from public agent?, has been very  
defective, he has been under the neco­  
itv of resorting to the colle tors of th«  
custo ns, and other respectable sources,  
within the reach of the department, t  
enable him to comply wi’h the call of  
the house which produced inevitable  
lelav in making this report, lie bey&gt;  
I ave further to state, that the accompa­  
nying tables, numbered 1, 2, S, 4, 5.  
and 6, embrace all the information that  
he has been able to obtain relative to  
die objects of the resolution. It is be­  
lieved that it is substantially correc ,  
though less particular and precise than  
might be wished. From these tables it  
will t?e seen that the vessels of the U  
States are excluded from all participation  
i » the trade, by sea. of the provincial or  
colonial possessions of Great Biitain, in  
America, with the exception of Bermuda  
and the Bahama Islands, where they  
are restricted to a very limited com­  
merce, particularly designated in the ta­  
ble numbered 4. It will be moreover  
-,een, that this trade is confined exclu­  
sively to British vessels, and in most in­  
stances to British merchants, and articles  
of miner value as especta both imports  
and exports. Whether, under the ex­  
isting regulations in Canada, the trade  
by inland navigation between the United  
States and those provinces is c nfinedto  
British vessels, is not distinctly under­  
stood.  
Respecttully submitted,

ing the president to cause to be laid before that  
  
house information relative to the duties laid on  
  
articles imported from the United States into the  
  
British provinces of Canada, Nova-Scctia, and New-  
  
Brunswick, relative to the duties on articles ex.  
  
ported to the United States from the said provinces;  
  
the duties laid on goods, wares, and merchandise,  
imported into the British West-India isiands, or any  
of them, from the United States, or from colonies  
in America owned by other foreign European pow-  
ers; and likewise, as to the duties on imports and  
exports to which vessels of the United States are,  
subject in the ports of the British East-Indies; has  
the honor to state, that as the information received  
by the department, on the subject of these inqui-  
ries, since the peace, from pubiic agents, has been  
very defective, he has been under the necessity of  
resorting to the collectors of the customs, and other  
espectable sources, within the reach of the depart-  
ment, to enable him to comply with the call of the  
house, which produced inevitable de&#x27;ay in makirg  
this report. He begs leave further to state, that the  
  
accompanying tables, numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6,  
  
embrace all the information that he has been able to  
  
obtain relative to the objects of the resotutidn. It  
is believed that it is substantially correct, though  
less particular and precise than might be wished.  
  
From these tables it will be seen that the vessels  
  
of the United States are excluded from all partici  
  
pation in the trade, by sea, of the provincial or co-  
lonial possessions of Great-Britain, in America, with  
the exception of Bermuda and Bahama islands,  
where they are restricted to a very limited com-  
merce, particularly designated in the table num-  
bered 4. It will be moreover seen, that this trade is  
confined exclusively to British vessels, and in most  
iistances to British merchants, and articles of minor  
value as respects hoth imports and exports. Whe-  
ther, under the existing regulations in Canada, the  
trade by inland navigation between the United  
States and those provinces is confined to British  
vessels, is not distinctly understood,

rick, pay 74 per ct. ad. val.  
Indigo pays, per cwt. 3784 cents.  
  
English ships, it is stated, receive a drawback on  
silk goods and indigo, of five per cent.  
  
By a recent arrival from India, information has  
been received that all goods there imported, under  
the American flag, pay ‘a duty of 20 per cent. on  
the invoice, nasal stores excepted, which pay 10;  
under the British flag, 23. All silk goods, and  
cotton piece goods, made in the territories entirely  
subject to the India company, pay.73 per cent. on  
a valuation made by the collector at the port of cx-  
portation; the British flag nothing, and is, perhaps,  
allowed some drawback. On cotton goods made in  
districts not entirely subject to British power, the  
American flag is allowed a drawback of 24 per cent.  
But it is represented that there is so much difficul-  
ty attending the passing the goods when the draw-  
pack is claimed, that it is often relinquished. The  
British flag receives a drawback of 74 per cent.—  
Nollars are now taxed at the mint 24 per cent. and  
will not probably sell for more hereafter than 2}  
per cent. profit.  
  
With respect to imports into the cape of Good-  
Hope, and the isles of France and Bourbon, trom  
the United States, itis understood that naval stores,  
provisions, brandy, wines, fish, flour, gin, and spe-  
cie, pay a duty of 6 per cent. ad valorem. The  
exports from those places to the United States,  
are cotton, cloves, salt-petre, coffee, sugar, pepper,  
spices, and hides, which are subject to a duty of  
1} per cent. ad valorein.  
  
From Batavia, Manilla, and Sumatra, the arti-  
cles of export are sugar, coffee, camphor, spices,  
cotton, indigo, and pepper, the duties on which  
are varied at the pleasure of the governor, accord-  
ing to the demands for the current expenses of the  
different colonies. No tariff has been received.—  
Nothing but specie is exported from the United  
States to those places

April 18, 1816.  
  
= REPORT.  
  
The Secretary of State, to whom was referred  
the resolution of the House of Representatives,  
requesting the President to cause to be laid be-  
fore that house information relative to the duties  
laid on articles imported from the United States  
nto the British provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia,  
and New-Brunswick, relative to the duties on ar-  
Ucles exported to the United States from the said  
provinces; the duties laid on goods, wares, and

merchandise imported into the British West-India  
  
Islands, or any of them, from the United States,  
  
or from colonies in America owned by other fo-  
  
rein European powers; and likewise as to the  
duties on imports and exports to which vessels of  
the United States are subject in the ports of the  
  
British East Indies; has the honour to state, that  
  
as the information received by the department,  
  
on the subject of the inquiries, since the peace,  
from public agents, has been very defective, he  
has been under the necessity of resorting to the  
collectors of the customs, and other respectable  
sources, within the reach of the department, to  
enable him to comply with the call of the house,  
which produced inevitable delay in making this  
report. He begs leave further to state, that the  
accompanying tables, numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and  
6, embrace all the information that he has been  
able to obtain relative to the objects of the reso-  
lution. It is believed that it is substantially cor-  
rect, though less particular and precise than might  
be wished, From these tables it will be seen that  
the vessels of the United States are excluded from  
ull participation in the trade, by sea, of the pro-  
vincial or colonia! possessions of Great Britain, in  
  
America, with the exception of Bermuda and the  
  
Bahama Islands, where thev are restricted to a  
  
very limited commerce, particularly designated  
  
in the table numbered 4. It will be moreover  
seen, that this trade is confined exclusively to  
  
British vessels, and in most instances to British  
  
merchants, and articles of minor value, as re-  
  
spects both imports and exports. Whether, un-  
der the existing regulations in Canada, that trade  
by inland navigation between the United States  
and those provinces is confined to British vessels,  
is not distinctly understood.  
Respectfully submitted,  
JAMES MONROE.  
Department of State, April 17, 1816.  
No. 1.  
  
Information relative to the Duties laid on Articles  
imported from the United States into the British

On the 29th of May, 1815, the intercourse be-  
tween the United States and Canada was regulated  
by an order in council in Canada at that date.  
  
This order directs, ‘* That duties shall be paid  
and collected on all goods and commodities im-  
  
| ported from the United States, agreeably to the  
  
following tariff, viz.

such duties as are chargeable by law.”*  
  
* It is understood that this tariff of duties was  
Lo continue until April, 1815. It is now stated  
that the above order in council is no longer in  
force; and that the produce and manufactures of  
foreign countries are not admitted into Canada  
trom the United States; and that all manufactures  
or produce of the United States which are admit-  
ed, except provisions, pay a duty of thirty-three  
and one third per centum.

into Nova Scotia or New-Brunswick. The go-  
vernors of New-Brunswick and Nova Scotia are  
empowered to permit the introduction into those  
colonies, by proclamation, of certain articles.—  
Such proclamations have been always issued  
every three months: the last was issued on the  
6th February, 1816, aud authorizes British sub-  
jeets to import into Nova Scotia and New-Bruns-

ported to the United States. There are a few  
articles, however, Which are an exception to this  
rule: rum, if imported into the colony, being to  
the amount of two thirds of its value, bought with  
the produce of the colony, pays 20 per cent. and  
has a drawback of 18. Rum otherwise bought  
pays 25 per cent. and has a drawback of 22 per  
cent. Sugar, if purchased as the first mentioned  
rum, pays 70 per cent. and has a drawback of 59  
percent. All other sugar pays 120 per cent. and  
has a drawback of 109 percent. Coffee, if pur.  
chased also to the amount of two thirds of its  
valuc, with the produce of the colony, pays 2  
cents pcr pound, and has a drawback of 2 cents,  
Other coffee pays 4 cents, and has a drawback of  
3 cents 9 2-3 mills. Molasses pays 2 cents per

pay 40 cents per gallon, and have a drawback of  
34 cents. Gin pays 354 cents per gallon, and has  
a drawback of 29 cents. Brandy the same duty  
and drawback. There is, besides, what is called  
a king’s duty on wine from the islands, of 15 dol-  
lars per pipe, and from Great Britain and ports  
  
in the Mediterranean not French, of 244 cents  
  
per pipe. In the year 1815, the government of  
Nova Scotia laid a duty of a dollar per ton on  
  
plaster of Paris landed to the northward and  
  
westward of Cape Cod. Recently, a duty of 4  
  
dollars per ton has been imposed by the govern-  
  
ment of New-Brunswick on plaster of Paris land-

Note-—The trade of Jamaica, to and from the  
United States, according to the recent British  
regulations, is to be carried on in British vessels  
only, and the articles admitted into that island  
must be the property of British subjects ; the im-  
portation of the products of the United States from  
other colonies in the West-Indies is not allowed.  
Every description of fish is prohibited admission  
in the island of Jamaica. Rum, molasses, and  
pimento alone, can be exported therefrom, paying  
aduty of 10 per cent. ad valorem.  
  
At present vessels of the United States are not  
allowed to import into the island of Tobago any  
kind of merchandise whatever, nor to go there  
in ballast and bring away cargoes of any sort.  
  
Lumber and provisions have been recently per-  
mitted to be imported into Antigua, from the  
Cnited States, in British vessels.  
  
Generally speaking, since the peace, vessels of  
the United States have been prohibited an entry  
atall into the British West-India Islands. Into  
Bermuda, which, strictly speaking, is not regard-  
ed as one of the West-Indies, vessels of tie  
United States may carry flour, rice, corn, and  
lumber, upon paying a duty of five and a half per  
cent. rum, sugar, molasses, and salt, may be ex-  
ported on paying a duty of five per cent. Port  
charges, about 20 dollars. No tonnage or light  
money. But Bermuda is a mere place of entrepot,  
at which the United States have little or no trade.  
  
From the Bahamas, American vessels were, hy  
proclamation of the governor, on the Sth of April  
last, excluded, unless they resorted to the ports  
of these islands in ballast, for the purpose of load-  
lig With salt; in that case they are required to  
Pay a king’s tonnage of two shillings and six  
Pence sterling per ton, and a colonia! tinasge of  
twenty cents per ton: also, an export duty of a  
half penny sterling on euch bushel of salt. At  
this time, no kind of salted provisions és permitted  
9 an entry in the Bahamas from the United States.  
Flour and corn pay no duty. Rice, bread, peas,  
and lumber, pay a duty of five per cent. if from  
the United States. Tere is no export duty on  
articles exported in British vessels, excepting  
Brazilletto, which pays one dollar and twenty-five  
cents per ton.  
  
As to the Newfoundland trade, it may be proper  
to mention, that it is understood to be restricted  
‘o the colonies and the mother country by act of  
Parliament, but that licenses are granted by the  
  
ing’s council in Great Britain, permitting certain  
—— in certain British vessels, to be named in  
ws license, to import into the colony, direct from  
  
u@ United States, bread, flour, corn, rice, and

live stock. Fish of all kinds, oil, and the produce  
  
of Great Britain can be exported from Newfound-  
  
land, into the United States in British vessels  
only.  
No. 5.  
  
Information relative to Duties laid on Goods, Wares,  
and Merchandise imported into the British West-  
India Islands, or any of them, from the United  
States, through Colonies in America, owned by  
other foreign European Powers, &amp;c.  
  
The information received in relation to this  
point leads to the general impression, that the  
importation of the products of the United States  
into the British West-Indies, from other foreign  
colonies in that quarter, is not at this time allow-  
ed. As far as it regards the island of Jamaica, it  
lias been distinctly stated from authentic sources  
that the governor’s proclamation, permitting the  
importation of the productions of the United  
States from the Spanish, or other ncutral colonies,  
having expired on the 30th of November last,  
the importation is prohibited in any other than a  
direct manner, &amp; that, as will be seen in table No.  
3, must be in British vessels only. When the pro-  
ducts of the United States were admitted &#x27; wee  
the other European colonies in America, and Ja-  
maica, the duties were the same as if they had  
been imported direct from the United States.  
  
As to duties laid in the British West-India  
islands, on goods, wares, and merchandise, other  
than those of the United States, when imported  
from colonics in America owned by other forcign  
European powers, the department of state is not  
furnished with any information.  
  
Information asto the Duties on Imports and Exports  
to which vessels of the United States are subject  
in the Ports of the British Eust-Indies.  
  
Imports. Duties.  
  
The articles usually imported in-  
to Calcutta and Bombay from the  
United States, are brandy and Hol-  
land gin, which pay 25 cts. per gal.  
  
Naval stores, spars, and wines,  
which pay 20 per ct. ad. val.  
  
Note.-—The preceding particulars have been  
communicated from one source; from another, a  
general remark has been made, that all articles  
from the United States imported into Bengal, are  
subject to 20 percentum duty, except naval stores,  
which pay 10 per centum. This duty is paid on  
a valu.tion of the articles as they are landed from  
the vessels. The duty on tonnage is not precisely  
known. On one hand, it is represented to be not  
excecding one per centum on the value of the  
vessel; onthe other, it is said American vessels  
pay more than double the dutics that the English  
do, both on imports and exports, and double pilot-  
age; and that the British ships in the East-India  
colonies have an advantage over those of tlie  
United Siates of at least 10 per centum on in-  
ports and exports. On the 15th of last September,  
it is said, new regulations with regard to duties  
on imports and exports were published in Calcut-  
ta, which places British vessels on a stilk more  
favourable footing than they were before, com-  
pared with foreign vessels. ‘The port charges are  
alleged to be very expensive at Calcutta, amount-  
ing to about two and a half per centum on the ar-  
ticles experted from thence to the United States,  
exclusive of brokerage and commission, which

Indigo pays, per cwt. 573 1-2 cts.  
  
English ships, it is stated, reccived a drawback  
on silk goods and indigo, of five per cent.  
  
By a recent arrival from India, information has  
been received, that all goods there imported un-  
der the American flag, pay «a duty of 20 per cent.  
on the invoice, naval stores excepted, which pay  
10; under the British flag, 2 1-2. All silk goods,  
and cotton piece goods, made in the territories  
entizely subject to the India company, pay 7 1-2  
per cent. on a valuation made by the collector at  
the port of exportation; the British flog nothing,  
afd is, perliaps, allowed some drawback. On  
cotton goods made in districts not entirely subject  
to British power, the American flag is allowed a  
drawback of 2 1-2 percent. But it is represented  
that there is so mach difficulty attending the pass-  
ing of goods when drawback is claimed, that it is  
often relinquished. ‘The British flay: reccives a  
drawback of 7 1-2 per cent. Dollars are now  
taxed at the mint 2 1-2 per cent. and will not pro-  
bably sell for more hereafter than 2 1-2 per cent.  
profit.  
  
With respect to imports into the Cape of Good  
Ifope, and the Isles of France and Bourbon, from  
the United States, it is understood that naval  
stores, provisions, brandy, wines, fish, flour, gin,  
and specie, pay a duty of 6 per cent. ad valorem.  
The exports from those places to the United  
States are cotton, cloves, salt-petre, coflee, sugar,  
pepper, spices, arc hides, which are subject to  
a duty of 1 1-2 per cent. ad valorem.  
  
From Batavia, Manilla, and Sumatra, the arti-  
cles of export are sugar, coffec, camphor, spices,  
cotton, indigo, sid pepper, the duties on which  
are varied at the pieasure of the governor, ac-  
cording to the demands for the current expenses  
of the different colonics. No tariff has been re-  
ceived. Nothing but specie is exported trom tie  
United States to those places
