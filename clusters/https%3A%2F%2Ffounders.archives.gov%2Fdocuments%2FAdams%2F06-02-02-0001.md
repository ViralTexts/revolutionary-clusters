Dr Sir  
Boston Decr 17 1773  
  
The Dye is cast: The People have passed the River and cutt away the Bridge: last Night Three Cargoes of Tea, were emptied into the Harbour. This is the grandest, Event, which has ever yet happened Since, the Controversy, with Britain, opened!  
The Sublimity of it, charms me!  
For my own Part, I cannot express my own Sentiments of it, better than in the Words of Coll Doane to me, last Evening—Balch Should repeat them—The worst that can happen, I think, Says he in Consequence of it, will be that the Province must pay for it. Now, I think the Province, may pay for it, if it is burn’d as easily as if it is drank—and I think it is a matter of indifference whether it is drank or drowned. The Province must pay for it, in Either Case. But there is this Difference. I believe, it will take them 10 Years to get the Province to pay for it. If so, we shall Save 10 Years Interest of the Money. Whereas if it is drank it must be paid for immediately. Thus He—However, He agreed with me that the Province, would never pay for it. And also in this that the final Ruin, of our Constitution of Government, and of all American Liberties, would be the certain Consequence of Suffering it to be landed.  
Governor Hutchinson and his Family and Friends will never have done, with their good services to Great Britain and the Colonies! But for him, this Tea might have been Saved to the East India Company. Whereas this Loss if the rest of the Colonies Should follow our Example, will in the opinion of many Persons bankrupt the Company. However, I dare Say, that the Governors, and Consignees, and Custom House Officers, in the other Colonies will have more Wisdom than ours have had, and take effectual Care that thier Tea shall be sent back to England untouched. If not it will as surely be destroyed there as it has been here.  
  
Threats, Phantoms, Bugbears, by the million, will be invented and propagated among the People upon this occasion. Individuals will be threatened with Suits and Prosecutions. Armies and Navies will be talked of—military Execution—Charters annull’d—Treason—Tryals in England and all that—But—these Terrors, are all but Imaginations. Yet if they should become Realities they had better be Suffered, than the great Principle, of Parliamentary Taxation given up.  
The Town of Boston, was never more Still and calm of a Saturday night than it was last Night. All Things were conducted with great order, Decency and perfect Submission to Government. No Doubt, we all thought the Administration in better Hands, than it had been.  
Please to make Mrs Adams’s most respectfull Compliments to Mrs Warren and mine.  
  
I am your Friend,  
John Adams

it is a matter of indifference whether it is

for it in cither Case. But there is this differ-­  
ence, I believe it will take them 10 years to

ave 10 Years Interest of the Money, whereas,  
if it is drank it must be paid for immediately;  
thus He, However, He agreed with me that  
the Province would never pay for it; and  
also in this that the final Ruin of our Consti­

Dr Sir  
  
The Dye la cast! The People have passed the  
lUvcr and cut away tfco Bridge! last Mght Three  
Cargoes of Tea were emptied into the Harbour.  
This la the grandest Event which has ever yet  
happened Since the Controversy with Britain  
opened! The Sublimity of it, charms mo!  
For my own Part I cannot express my own  
Sentiments of U, better than In. tue Words of  
Coll. I&gt;oane to me Inst Evening—Caleb should m­  
peat them—&#x27;Thu worst that cun happen, I think,  
soys he lu Consequence of it, will be that the  
Piorlnco must pay for it.—Now, I think, the  
Province, mav pay for it, if it la burned as easily  
as ir it Is drunk—and I think It is a matter of indif  
foreneo whether it is drank or drowned,—The  
Province muse pay for It In either Case —Bui  
theio is this difference—l believe it will take  
them 10 year** to got tne Province to pay for it—  
If so, wo eha&#x27;il save 10 years intorunt ut Uia Money  
—whereas if It in drank it must bo paid for im­  
mediately. thus Ho However, He agreed with  
mo That the Province, would never pay for it—  
and also in this that the gtlnai Rum, of ourCon­  
i‘ti!ution of Government and of all American  
liberties, would bo the oertuia Consequences of  
Suffering it to bo landed.  
Governor Hutchinson and hi* Family and  
Friends will never have dune with their good  
services to Great Britain &amp; the Colonies! Rut  
forl.jni, this tea might have boon saved to the  
East India Company. Whereas this Loss If the  
rust of the Colonies should follow our example,  
wdl in the opinion of many Persons bankrupt the  
Company.  
However, 1 dare say, that the Governors and  
Consignees and Custom House olDcers, in tb«  
oilier Colonies will have&#x27; morn Wisdom chan ours  
have had A take effectual care that tln-lr Tea  
shall lm sent back to E**&lt;vland untouched—lf not  
It will ns surely bo destroyed there as It has boon  
here.  
  
Throats, Phantoms. Bugbears, by the million,  
will bo invented and jn-upogatod among the Peo­  
ple on this Occasion—iT.Qlviduals will bo threat­  
ened with Suits nod Prosecutions, Armies and  
Navies will bo talked of, military Executions—  
darters annnli&#x27;d-Trcason—lT7lJ9 in England  
and all that—But—these Terrors are all but Im­  
aginations—Yet if they should become K-a&#x27;itifS  
they bad better bo auflbred, than the great Prin­  
ciple. of Parliamentary Taxation given up—  
The Town of Boston was never more still and  
calm of n Saturday night than it was last Night.  
AH Tilings wore conducted with great order, De­  
cency and pcrCec/ submission to Government—■  
No Doubt, we all thought the Administration in  
better Hands than u had been.  
  
Please to make Mrs. Adams most respectful!  
Compliments to Mrs. Warren, and mine,

Dear Sir:—The Dye is cast! The  
People have passed the River and curt  
away the Bridge ! last Night Three Car  
goes of Tea were emptied into the H..r­  
bor. This «s the grandest Event which  
has ever yet happened Since the Con

Sublimity of it charms me I   
For my own Part. I cariLot express my  
own Sentiments of it, better than in the  
Word of Coll. Doane to ine last Evening  
—Balch should repeat them—The worst  
that can happen; I think, says teUn Con­  
sequence of it, will be that the Province,  
must pay for it—Now, I think the Prov­  
ince, may pay far it, if it is burned as  
easily as if it is drank—and I think it is  
a matter of indifference whuth &#x27;r it is  
diank or drowned. The Province mu-t  
pay for it in either Case—but there is  
this difference —I believe it vCHL take  
them 10 years, to g£*t the Province to pay  
for it—if so, we shall save 10 Years  
interest of the Money—whereas if it is  
drank it must be paid for immediately,  
bus He—However, lie agreed with me  
that the Province would never pay for it  
—and also in this that the final Ruin, of  
our Constitution of Government and of  
all American Liberies, would be the  
certain Consequence of Suffering it to be  
landed.   
  
Governor Hutchinson and his Family  
and Friends will never have done with  
their good services to Grea Britain &amp; the  
Colonies ! But for him. this tea might  
have been saved to the Ea*t India Com  
pany. Whereas this Loss,if the rest of the  
Colonies sh-uild follow our example, will,  
in the opinion of many Persons,bankrupt  
the Company.   
However, I dare say,that the Governors  
and Consignees and Custom House of­  
ficers, in the other Colonies, will have  
more Wisdom than ours have had it take  
effectual care that their Tea shall be sent  
backt lEnghmd untouched- if not it will hs  
Mirely be destroyed there as it has been  
here.   
Threats, Phantoms, Bugbears, by the  
million, will be invented and propagated  
among the People on this occasion—lndi  
viduals will be threatened wuhSuits and  
Prosecutions, Armies and Navies will be  
talked of, military Excursions—Charters  
annull’d-Treason-Tryals in England and  
all tha&#x27;—But—these terrors are all Imig  
inations—Yet if they should become  
Realities they had better be suffered,than  
the greatPriuciple of Parliamentary Taxa  
lion given up—   
The Town of Boston was never more  
still and calm of a Saturday night than it  
was last night. AU Things were conduct  
cd with great order, Decency and perfect  
aribmiesion to Government NoDoubt,   
We all through the Administration iu  
better Hands than it had been.

BOSTON, DEC. 17, 1873.  
  
DEAR SIR:  
  
The Dye is cast! The People have  
passed the River and cut away the  
Bridge! last Night Three Cargoes of  
Tea were emptied into the Harbour.  
This is the grandest Event which has  
ever yet happened Since the Controver­

ty of it, charms me  
  
For my own Part I cannot express  
my own Sentiments of it, better than in  
the Words of Coll. Doane to me last  
Evening—Balch should repeat them—  
The worst that can happen, I think,  
says he in Consequence of it, will be  
that the Province must pay for it.—  
Now, I think the Province may pay  
for it, if it is drowned as easily as if it is  
drank—and I think it is a matter of  
indifference whether it is drank or  
drowned. The Province must pay for  
it in either Case—But there is this dif­  
ference—I believe it will take them 10  
Years Interest of the Money—whereas  
if it is drank it must be paid for imme­  
diately, thus He—However, He agreed  
with me that the Province, would nev­  
er pay for it.—and also in this that the  
final Ruin, of our Constitution of Gov­  
ernment and of all American Liberties,  
would be the certain Consequence of  
Suffering it to be landed.  
  
Governor Hutchinson and his Family  
and Friends will never have done with  
their good services to Great Britain &amp;  
the Colonies! But for him this tea  
might have been saved to the East In­  
dia Company. Whereas this Loss, if  
the rest of the Colonies should follow  
our example, will in the opinion of  
many persons bankrupt the Company.  
  
However,. 1 dare say, that the Gov­  
ernors and Consignees and Custom  
House officers, ia the other colonies,  
will have more Wisdom than ours have  
had &amp; take effectual care that their Tea  
shall be sent back to England untouched  
—if not it will as surely be destroyed  
there as it has been here.  
  
Threats, Phantoms, Bugbears, by the  
million, will be invented and propaga­  
ted among the People upon this Occa­  
sion—Individuals will be threatened  
with Suits and Prosecutions, Armies  
and Navies will be talked of, military  
Executions—Charters annuli&#x27;d—Trea­  
son—Trials in England and all that—  
But—these Terrors are all but Imagina­  
tions—Yet if they should become Reali­  
ties they had better be suffered, than  
the great Principle, or Parliamentary  
Taxation given up—  
  
The Town of Boston was never more  
still and calm of a Saturday night than  
it was last Night. All things were con­  
ducted with great order, Decency and  
perfect submission to Government.—No  
Doubt We all thought the Administra­  
tion in better Hands than it had been.
