In the light of religion let this mutability be considered. It is the work of the providence of that Being, whose nature, purposes, &amp; perfection, are ever the same. He changeth not; therefore we are not consumed. His compassions fail not; they are new every morning: great is his faithfulness. These vicissitudes are adapted to our active nature.

You do then bless the giver of life, that the course of your endeared &amp; honored friend was so long &amp; so bright; that she entered so fully into the spirit of those injunctions which we have explained, &amp; was a minister of blessings to all within her influence. You are soothed to reflect, that she was sensible of the many tokens of divine goodness which marked her lot; that she received the good of her existence with a cheerful &amp; grateful heart; that, when called to weep, she bore adversity with an equal mind; that she used the world as not abusing it, to excess, improving well her time, talents, &amp; opportunities, and, though desired longer in this world, was fitted for better happiness than the world can give.
