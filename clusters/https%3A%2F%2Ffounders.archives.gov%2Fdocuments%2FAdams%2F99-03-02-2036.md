Letter 4.  
N. 7.  
My Dear Son  
St: Petersburg 29. September 1811.  
  
The second general point of view, in which I propose to you to consider the Bible, to the great end that it may “thoroughly furnish you unto all good works,” is in its historical character. To a man of liberal education the study of History is not only useful and important, but altogether indispensable; and with regard to the History contained in the Bible, the observation which Cicero makes respecting that of his own Country is much more emphatically applicable—that it is not so much praise-worthy to be acquainted with it, as it is shameful to be ignorant of it.  
History, so far as it relates to the actions and adventures of men may be divided into five different classes. 1. The history of the world, otherwise called Universal History. 2. That of particular Nations. 3. That of particular Institutions. 4. That of single families and 5. That of individual men—The two last of these Classes are generally distinguished by the name of Memoirs, and of Biography—All these classes of History are to be found in the Bible; and it may be worth your while to discriminate them from one another.  
1. The Universal History is short, and all contained in the first eleven Chapters of Genesis, together with the first chapter of the first Book of Chronicles, which is little more than a genealogical list of names—But it is of the highest importance, not only as it includes the history of the Creation, and of the fall of man, of the antideluvian world, and of the flood, by which the whole human race, excepting Noah and his family were destroyed, but as it gives a very precise chronological account of the time from the Creation untill the birth of Abraham—This is the foundation of all antient History, and in reading the profane historians hereafter I would advise you always to reflect upon their narrations with reference to it—With respect to the Chronology, a correct idea of this is so necessary to understand all history antient and modern that I may hereafter write you something further concerning it—For the present I shall only recommend to your particular attention the fifth and eleventh Chapters of Genesis, and request you to cast up and write me the amount of the World’s age, when Abraham was born.  
2. The remainder of the Book of Genesis, beginning at the twelfth Chapter, is a history of one individual, (Abraham) and of his family during three Generations of his descendants—After which the book of Exodus, commences with the history of this same family multiplied into a Nation—This National and family History, is continued through the Books of the Old Testament, untill that of Job, which is of a peculiar character, differing in many particulars from every other part of the Scriptures.  
There is no other history extant, which can give so interesting and correct a view of the rise and progress of human associations, as this account of Abraham and his descendants, through all the vicissitudes to which individuals, families and Nations are liable—There is no other History, where the origin of a whole Nation is traced up to a single man, and where a connected chain of Events, and a regular series of persons from generation to generation is preserved. As the history of a family, it is intimately connected with our religious principles and opinions, for it is the family from which Jesus Christ in his human character descended—It begins by relating the command of God to Abram, to abandon his Country, his kindred, and his father’s house, and to go to a land which he would shew him—This command was accompanied by two promises, from which and from their fulfillment arose the differences which I have just noted between the History of the Jews and that of every other Nation—The first of these promises was that God would make of Abram a great Nation, and bless him—the second and incomparably the most important was that in him, (Abram) all families of the Earth should be blessed.—This promise was made about two thousand years before the birth of Christ, and in him it had its fulfillment—When Abram in obedience to the command of God had gone into the land of Canaan, the Lord appeared to him, and made him a third promise which was that he would give that land to the Nation which should descend from him as a possession—This was fulfilled between five and six hundred years afterwards.—In reading all the historical Books both of the Old and the new Testament, as well as the Books of the prophets, you should always bear in mind the reference which they have to these three promises of God to Abram—All the history is no more than a narrative of the particular manner and the detail of Events, with which those promises were fulfilled.  
In the Account of the Creation, and the fall of man, I have already remarked that the moral doctrine inculcated by the Bible is that the great consummation of all human Virtue consists in Obedience to the Will of God. When we come hereafter to speak of the Bible in its ethical character, I shall endeavour to shew you the intrinsic excellence of this principle, but I shall now only remark how strongly the principle itself is illustrated, first by the account of the fall, and next by the history of Abraham.  
In the account of the Creation we are informed, that God after having made the world, created the first human pair, and gave them dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth—and also gave them every herb bearing seed, and fruit of every tree for meat—And all this we are told God saw, was very good.—Thus the immediate possession of every thing good, was immediately given them; and its perpetual enjoyment ensured to their descendants; on the sole condition of abstaining from the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil—It is altogether immaterial to my present remarks whether this narrative is to be understood in an allegorical or a literal sense—As not only the knowledge but the possession of all created good was granted, the fruit of the tree could confer upon them no new knowledge but that of evil, and the command was nothing more than to abstain from the knowledge of evil—to forbear from rushing upon their own destruction—It is not sufficient to say that this was a command in its own nature light and easy—It was a command to pursue the only law of their Nature—to keep the happiness which had been heaped without measure upon them—But observe, it contained the principle of Obedience—It was Assigned to them as a duty; and the heaviest of penalties was denounced upon its transgression—They were not to discuss the wisdom or Justice of this command—They were not to enquire why it had been enjoined upon them; nor could they have the slightest possible motive for such an enquiry—Unqualified felicity and immortality was already theirs—wretchedness and death were alone forbidden them, but placed within their reach merely as a trial of their Obedience—They violated the Law—they forfeited their Joy and Immortality—they “brought into the World, death and all our woe.”  
Here then is one extreme case in which the mere principle of obedience could be tried—A command to do abstain from that which from which every motive of reason and every interest would  have deterred, had the command never been given—A command given in the easiest of all possible forms, requiring not so much as action of any kind, but merely forbearance.—And as its transgression was so severely punished, the only inference we can draw from it is, that the most aggravated of all crimes, and that which includes in itself all other is disobedience to the Will of God.  
Let us now consider how the same principle of Obedience is inculcated in the history of Abraham by a case in the opposite extreme—God commanded Abram to abandon forever his Country, his kindred, and his father’s house, to go, he knew not where; promising as a reward of his obedience to bless him and his posterity, though he was then childless—He was required to renounce every thing that could most contribute to the happiness and comfort of his life, and which was in his actual enjoyment; to become a houseless, friendless, wanderer upon Earth—on the mere faith of the promises that a land should be shewn him which his descendants should possess, that they should be a great Nation, and that through them, all mankind should receive in future ages a further blessing—The obedience required of Adam was merely to retain all the blessings that he enjoyed—The obedience required of Abraham was to sacrifice all those that he possessed, for the vague and distant prospect of a future compensation to his posterity—The self-controul and self-denial required of Adam was in itself the slightest that imagination can conceive, but its failure was punished by the forfeiture of all his enjoyments—The self-dominion to be exercised by Abraham was of the severest and most painful kind, but its accomplishment will ultimately be rewarded by the restoration of all that was forfeited by Adam. But this restoration was to be obtained by no ordinary proof of obedience—The sacrifice of mere personal blessings however great could not lay the foundation for the redemption of mankind from Death—The voluntary submission of Jesus Christ to his own Death, in the most excruciating and ignominious form, was to consummate the great plan of redemption, but the submission of Abraham to sacrifice his beloved and only Son, the child promised by God himself, and through whom all the greater promises were to be carried into effect—the feelings of Nature, the voice of humanity, the parent’s bowels, were all required to be sacrificed by Abraham to the blind, unquestioning principle of Obedience to the Will of God—The blood of Isaac was not indeed shed—The butchery of an only son by the hand of his father was a sacrifice which a merciful God did not require to be completely executed—But as an instance of Obedience it was imposed upon Abraham, and nothing less than the voice of an Angel from God, could arrest his uplifted arm, and withhold him from sheathing the knife in the heart of his child—It was upon this testimonial of Obedience, that God’s promise of redemption was expressly renewed to Abraham—“And in thy seed shall all the Nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice”—Gen. XXII. 18.  
I have not done with this subject, and intend to pursue it, in my next letter—  
From your father  
A.

Letters  
FaOW NON. JoHN quIncY ADAMs to His sox  
ON THE BIBLE AND ITS TEACHINGS.  
nunicle e  
LETTER HII.  
The second general point of view, in which I pro.  
se for you to consider the Bible, to the end that  
it may &quot;thoroughly furnish you unto all goed  
works,&quot; is in the historical character.  
To a man of liberal education, the study of his.­  
tory is not only useful and important, but alto­  
lispensable, and with regard to the his  
tained in the Bible, the observation which  
Cicero makes respecting that of his own country is  
much more emphatically applicable, &quot;that it is net  
a so much praise worthy to be acquainted with as it  
f is shameful to be ignorant of it.&quot; History, so far as  
it relates to the actions and adventures of men, may  
be divided in five different classes. First, the His  
tory of the world, otherwise called Universal His  
tory Second that of particular nations: Third that  
of particular institutions Fourth,  
lies, and Fifth, that of individual me  
two of these classes are generally distinguished by  
the name of memoirs and biography. All these  
lasses of history are to be found in the Bible, and  
it may be wworth your while to discriminate them  
rom another. The Universal History is short,  
and all contained in the first eleven chapters of  
Geneaic, together with the first chapter of the first  
book of Chronicies, which is little more than a  
genealgical hist of names; but it is of  
ance, not only as it includes the history of the crea  
tion, of the fall of man, of the antediluvian world and  
the food by which the whole human race, fex  
ig Noah and his family, were destroyed, bat  
 aeit gives a very precise account of the time from  
the Creation until the Birth of Abraham. This is  
the foundation of Ancient History, and in reading­  
storians hereafter, I would advise you  
always to reflect upon their narratives with reter  
ence to it with respect to the chronology. A correct  
idea of this is so necessary to understand all his­  
tory, ancient and modern, that I may hereafter  
write you something farther conceining it; for the  
present I shall only recommend to your particular  
attention the fitth and eleventh chapters of Genesis,  
and request you to cast up and write me the amount  
of the age of the world when Abraham was born.  
The remainder of the book of Genesis, beginning  
at the 1eth chapter, is a history of one individoal  
Abraham) and his family during three generations  
of his descendents, after which the book of Exodus  
commences with the history of the same family,  
multiplied into a nation; this national and family  
history is continued through the books of the Old  
Testament until that of Job, which is of a peculiar  
character, differing in many pacticulars from every  
other part of the Scriptures. There is no other  
history extant which can give so interesting and  
correct view of the rise and progress of human as.  
sociations, as this account of Abraham and his  
decendan&#x27;s, through all the vicissitudes to which  
individuale, families, and nations are liable. There  
is no other history whero the origin of   
nation is traced up to a single man, and where a  
connected tain of events and a regular series of  
persons from generation to generation is pree  
served. As the history of a famity, it is intimately  
 connected with our religious principles and opin  
 ions, for it is the family from which tin his human  
character) Jesus Christ descended. It begins by  
 relating the commands of God to Abrabam, to  
abandon his country, his kindred, and his father&#x27;s  
house, and to go to a land which He would show  
 him. This command was accompanied by two  
promlses; from which, and from their falfilment  
arose the differences which I have just noticed be.  
tween the history of the Jews and that of eve  
other nation. The first of these promises was  
That God would make Abraham a great nat  
and bless him;&quot; the second, and incomparably the  
most important was, that in him all the families  
of the earth should be blessed.&quot; This  
was made about two thousand years before the  
birth of Chriat, and in Him had its fulfilment  
When Abraham in obedience to the command of  
 God had gone into the land of Canaan, the Lord  
 appeared unto him and made­  
I which was that he should give that land to a na  
Ition which should descend from him as a poases  
o tton this was fulfiled between five and ais bun  
dred years after ward. In reading all the historical  
books of both the Old and New Testaments, as  
well as the books of the Prophets, you should ale  
ways bear in mind the reterence which they have  
to these three promises of God to Abrabam al  
the history is no more than a narrative of the par  
ticnlar manner, and the dotail of events by which  
those promises were fulfilled.  
In the account of the Creation, and the Fal  
Man I have atveady remarked that the moral doc  
trine inculcated by the Bible is, that the great con  
sumation of all human virtue consists in obedience  
to the will of God. When we come hereafter to  
speak of the Bible in its ethical character, I shall  
endeavor to show you the intrinsic excellence of  
this principle; but I shall now only remark tow  
strongly the principle itself is illustrated, first in  
the account of the Fall, and next by the history of  
Abraham. In the account of the Creation we are  
informed that God, after having made the world,  
created the first human pair, and gave them do  
minion over every living thing that moveth  
apon the earth.&quot; He gave them also every herb  
bearing seed, and the fruit of every tree for meat.&quot;  
and all this we are told &quot;God saw was very good.  
  
sa a  o e  
Thus the immediate possession of everyth  
them, and its perpetual enjoyment  
to their descendants, on condition of ab  
from the &quot;fruit of the tree of knowledge  
and evit.&quot; It is altogether immaterial to my  
remarks whether the narrative is to be und  
in a literal or allegorical sense, as not o  
but the possession of created go  
granted; the frui  
them no knowledge but that of evil, and t  
mand was nothing more than to abstain fr  
knowledge--to forbear from rushing upon the  
is not sufficient to say the  
was a command in its own nature light and  
it was a command to pursue the only law  
shappiness that had been  
at measu  
i a a  
and the heavies  
was denounced upon its transgression. The  
not to discuss the wiedom, or jastice of thi  
mand, they were not to inquire why it ha  
ed upon them, nor could they hav  
slightest possible motive for the inquiry; unqe  
felicity and immortality were already theirs,w  
edness and death were alone forbidden ther  
placed within their reach as merely trials of  
obedience. They violated the law; they fo  
their joy, and i  
world, death, and all our woe.&quot; Here, then,  
extreme case in which t  
I be tried, and command to al  
notive of reasor  
st would have deterred had the com  
-a command given in the er  
poss  
  
transgression was so-severely punished, the  
inference we can draw from it is that  
gravated of all crimes, and that which includ  
itself all others, is disobedience to the will of  
Let us now consider how the principle of obedi  
is inculcated in the history of Abrafiam, by a  
in the opporite extreme. God comm  
ham to abandon forever his country, his kir  
and his father&#x27;s house, to go, he knew not wh  
promising, as a reward of his  
him and his posterity, though he was the  
lees: he was required to renounce every thing  
could most contribute to the happiness and con  
of his life, and which was in his actual enjoym  
to become a houseless, friendless wat  
th, on the mere faith of the pror  
land should be shown him which his  
should possess--that they should be a great nath  
and that through them all mankind should ree  
sa blessing. The obedience rect  
of Adam, was mere  
ed, the obedience of Abraham was to  
rifice all that he possessed for the vague and  
tant prospect of a future compensation to his  
terity the self control and self denial require  
Adam, was in itself the slightest that imagina  
can conceive,--but its failure was punished by  
forfeiture of all his enjoyments; the self domin  
to be exercised by Abraham was of the most  
vere and painful kind-but its accomplishment  
ultimately be rewarded by the restoration of  
that was forfeited by Adam. This restorat  
ho wover, was to be obtained by no ordinaryp  
sacrifice of mere personal b  
sings, however great could not lay the foun  
tion for the redemption of mankind from deat  
the voluntat  
ith, in the most excruciating and ignom  
ous form, was to consummate the great plan of  
abmission of Abraham to sae  
fice his beloved  
promised by God   
ater promises were to be carried into eff  
ings of nature, the parents bowels, we  
all requiren to be sacritied by Abraham to the bl  
iple of obedience to the

a mercifal God did

ce it was imposed upon Ab  
o an A  
Heaven could arrest his uplifted arm, a  
  
of his ciaid. It was upon this testimonial of of  
dience, that Gid&#x27;s promise of redemption wase

LETTERS  
From lion. John Quin cy Adams to his Son,  
On the Bible and its Teachings.  
LETTEH NO. III.  
The second general point of view, in which  
I propose for you to consider the Bible, to the  
end that may &quot;throughly furnish you unto all  
good works,&quot; is in the historical character. -  
To a man of liberal education, the study of  
history is not only useful, and important, but  
al.tooelner indispf nsable, and with regard to the  
history contained in the Bible, the observation  
,hw., r; tM :. &#x27; .k-. u:  
&quot; &quot;n-ii wiixiw manes icapcuiug luai Ul llio Un U  
country is much more emphatically applica­  
ble, &quot;that it is not so much praise-worthy to  
be acquainted with as it is shameful to be igno­  
rant of it.&quot;&#x27; History, so far as it relates to the  
actions and adventures of men, may be divded  
in five different classes. Fir.t, the History of  
the world, otherwise, called Universal History:  
Second, that of particular nations: Third, that  
of particular institutions: Fourth, that of sin  
gle families; and Fifth, that of individual men.  
All thi-se classes of history are to be found in  
the Bible, and it may be worth your while to  
discriminate them one from another. The Uni­  
versal History is short and all contained ift the  
first eleven chapters of Genesis, together with  
the first chapter of the first book ofChronicles,  
which is little more than a genealgical list of  
names, but it is of great importance, not only  
as it includes the history ot the creation, of the  
fall of man, of the antedeluvian world and the  
flood by which the whole human race, (except­  
ing Noah and his family,) were destroyed, but  
as it gives a very precise account of the time  
from the Creation until the Birth of Abraham.  
This is the foundation of Ancient History, and  
in reading profane historians hereafter, I would  
advise you always to reflect upon their narra­  
tives with reference to it, with respect to the  
chronology. A correct idea of this is so nec­  
essary to understand all history, ancient and  
modern, that I may hereafter write you some­  
thing farther concerning it; for the present I  
shall only recommend to your particular atten­  
tion the fifth and eleventh chapters of Gene­  
sis, and request you to cast up and write me the  
amount of the age of the world when Abraham  
was born. The remainder of the book of Gen­  
esis, beginning at the 12th chapter, is a history  
of one individual (Abraham) and his family  
during three generations of his descendents, af­  
ter which the book of Exodus commences with  
the history of the same family multiplied into  
a nation; tins national and lamily history is  
continued through the books of the Old Testa  
ment until that of Job, which is of a peculiar  
character, differing in many particulars lrom  
every other part of the Scriptures. There is ao  
other history extant w hich can give so interes  
ting ana correct view ot tne rise and progress  
ot human associations, as this account of Abra  
nam ana nis -tecenaants, tnrougli all tne vicis  
situdes to which individuals, families, and na  
tions are liable. There is no other history  
where the origin of a w hole nation is traced up  
to a single man, and where a connected train of  
events and a. regular series of persons from gen  
erations is preserved. As the history of a fam­  
ily, it is intimately connected with our reli­  
gious principles and opinions, for it is the fam  
ily from which (in his human character) Jesus  
Christ descended. It begins by relating the  
commands of God to Abraham, to abandon his  
country, his kindred and his fathers house; and  
and go to a land whicn He would snow him.  
This command was accompanied by two promi­  
ses, from which, and from their fulfilment  
arose the digereuces which I have just noticed  
between the history of the Jews and every oth-l  
er nation. The first of these promises was:  
&quot;That God would make Abraham a great na­  
tion and bless him:&quot;the second, and incompar­  
ably the most important was, that &quot;in him alii  
the families of the earth should be blessed.&quot;  
This promise was made about two thousand  
years before the birth of Christ, and in Him  
had its fulfillment. When Abraham in obedi­  
ence to the command of God had gone into the  
land of Canaan, the Lord appeared unto him  
and made him a third promise, which was that  
he should give that land to a nation wnicn  
should descend from him, as a possession, this  
was lulhlled betweeti hve andsix hundred years  
afterward. In reading all the historical books  
of both the Old and New Testaments, as well  
as the books of the Prophets, you should always  
bear m mind the relerence which they have to  
these three promises of God to&#x27; Abraham. All  
the history is no more than a narrative of the  
particular manner, and the detail of events by  
which those promises are fulfilled.  
In the account of the Creation, and the Fall  
of Man, I have already remarked that the mor­  
al doctrine inculcated by the Bible is, that the  
great consummation of all human virtue con­  
sists in obedience to the will of God. When  
w come hereafter to speak of the Bible in its  
ethical character, 1 shall endeavor to show you  
the intrinsic excellence of this principle; but 1  
shall now only remark how strongly the prin­  
ciple itself is illustrated, first in the account of  
the Fall, and next by the history of Abraham.  
In the account of the Creation, we are informrd  
that God, after having made the world, created  
the first human pair, and &quot;gave them domin­  
ion over every living thing that moveth upon  
the earth.&quot;&#x27; He gave them, also, &quot;every herb  
bearing seed, and the fruit of every tree for  
meat,&quot; and all this, we are told, &quot;God saw was  
very good.&quot; Thus the immediate possession of  
every thing was given them, and its perpetual  
enjoyment secured to their descendants, on con­  
dition of abstaining from the &quot;fruit of the tree  
of knowledge of good and evil. It is altogether  
immaterial to my present remarks whether the  
narrative is to be understood in a literal or al­  
legorical sense, as not only the knowledge, but  
the possession of created good was granted;  
the fruit of the tree, could confer upon them  
no knowledge but thatof evil, and the command  
was nothing more than to abstain from that  
knowledge to forbear from rushing upon their  
own destruction. It is not sufficient to say  
that this was a command in its own nature  
light and easy; it was a command to pursue  
the only law of their nature, to keep the hap­  
piness that had been heaped upon them with­  
out measure; but observe it contained the  
principle ofobedience it was assigned to them  
as a duty and the heaviest of penalties was  
denounced upon its transgression. Ihey were  
nob to discuss the wisdom, or justice or this  
command; they were not to inquire why it had  
been enforced upon them, nor could they have  
the slightest possible motive for the enqui&#x27;y;  
unqualified felicity and immortallity were al­  
ready theirs; wretchedness and death were alone  
forbidden them, but placed within their reach  
as merely trials of their obedience. They vio  
lated tne law; tney torteitea tneir joy and im  
mortality; they &quot;brought into the world, death,  
and all our woe. Here, then, is an extreme  
case in which the mere principle of obedience&#x27;  
could be tried, and command to abstain from  
which every motive of reason and interest  
iii i. ill. t  
would nave oeterreu, riaa tne command never  
been given a command given in the easiest of  
all possible iorm, requiring not so much as an  
action of any kind, but merely forbearance;  
and, its transgression was so severely punish­  
ed, the on! v inference we can draw forth it is  
that the most aggravated of all crimes, and  
that which includes in itself all others, is diso  
bedience to the will of God. Let us now con  
sider how the principle of obedience is incul­  
cated in the history of Abraham, by a case in  
the opposite extreme. God commanded Abra­  
ham to abandon forever his country, his kin­  
dred and his father&#x27;s house, to go, he knew  
not where; promising, as a re ward of his obedi­  
ence, to bless him and his posterity, though  
he. was then childless; he was required to re­  
nounce everything that could most contribute  
to the happiness and comfort of his life, and  
which was in his actual enjoyment; to become  
a houseless, friendless wanderer upon the earth  
on the mere faith of the promise that a land  
should be shown him which his descendants  
  
should possess that thej should be a great na­  
tionand that through them all mankind should  
receive in future ages a blessing. The obedi­  
ence required of Adam, merely to retain all the  
blessings he enjoyed; the obedience of Abraham  
was to sacrifice all that he possessed for the  
vague and distant prospect of a future compen­  
sation to his posterity; the self-control and  
self-denial required of Adam, was in itself the  
slightest that imagination can conceive, but  
its failure was punished by the forfeiture of all  
his enjoyments; the self-dominion to be exer­  
cised by Abraham was of the most severe and  
painful kind but its accomplishment will ul­  
timately be rewarded by the restoration of all  
that was forfeited by Adam. This restoration,  
however, was to be obtained by no ordinary  
proof of obedience; the. sacrifice of mere per­  
sonal blessings, however great could not lay  
the foundation for the redemtion of mankind  
from death; the voluntary submission of Jesus  
Christ to his own death, in the most excrucia­  
ting and ignominious form, was to consum­  
mate the great plan of redemption, but the  
  
submission of Abraham to sacrifice his beloved  
and only son Isaac the child promised by God  
himself, and through whom all the&#x27; greater  
promises were to be carried into effect, the feel­  
ings of nature, the parent&#x27;s bowels, were all  
required to be sacrificed by Abraham to the  
blind unquestioning principle of obedi­  
ence to the will of God. The blood of  
Isaac was not indeed shed the butchery of an  
only son by the hand of his father, was a sacri­  
fice which a merciful God did not require to be  
completely executed, but as an instance of  
obedience it was imposed upon Abraham, and  
nothing less than the voice of an Angel from  
Heaven, could arrest his uplifted arm, and  
withhold him from sheathing his knife in the  
heart of his child: It was upon this testimo­  
nial of obedience, that God&#x27;s promise of re­  
demption was expressly renewed to Abraham;&#x27;  
&quot;In thy seed shall all the nations of, the earth  
be blessed, because thou hast obeyed my voice.&#x27;&quot;

M-you unto&#x27;all.good works,&quot; is itt ilte cis:   
toticatcharacter.. , • • . , - .   
To a man of libeiai eiltiCatiiiii,,the study­  
of history is not only. Useful, &#x27;and important,   
but altogether indispensable, and with re­  
gard to the hisibryt contained &quot;in the Bible,   
the observation which Cieeto•makes respect­  
ing that of his, own country is mach more   
emphatically applicable, &quot;that it is not so   
much praise4Orthy .to be acquainted, with   
as it is shameful to be.ignorant of it.&quot; His:   
_tory_r_sa-far-as-it-relates-44111e-Hettens--and­  
eil ventures of men, may be divided in five   
diflerent classes. First, the History of the   
world,-otherwise called I.Thiversid Thstbry:   
Second, that of particular nations: Third,   
&#x27;lliat-q1 particular institutions: Fourth. that of   
single families; and Filth, that of individual   
men. The last two of these classes Are   
• genefelly deitinguishecl by the name ofine­  
snoirs and bTographyi- All these elassesol   
1 history ate to be found in the Bible, and it   
may be. worth your while to discri:nipate.   
them one from another. - The Universal Hi­  
story is shed, and all contained in &#x27;the first   
eleven chapters&#x27;of Genesis. together With the   
first chapter of • the book- -of Chronicles,.   
which is }lute more than a genealogical list   
of names; but it is of great importance, hot   
only as it includes the history of the crea­  
tion, of the fall of Man, of the antediluvian   
1 world and the flood be which the whole he.   
man race,&quot;(except Noah .and his family,)   
were destroyed, but as it gives a very pre­  
cise account of the time from t:lb Creation   
until the Birth of Abraham. This is the   
foundation of Aocient History, and in read­  
ing prolane history Lereatter, I would&#x27;advise   
you always to reflect&#x27; upon their narratives   
with reference to it with respect to the elm­  
nology. A correct of this is so necee.   
sary to understand till history, ancient and   
modern, that I may hereafter wiire you   
something floater concerning it: for the pre­  
sent I shall only recornmend in your portico­  
far alt&#x27; tition the.fifth-ritid eleventh chaptere,&#x27;   
of Genesis. and request you to cast ,rip and   
&#x27;rite RIO ticearnoutit of the age of the world   
when Abraham was born. The remainder   
cf-the-hook-ol Genesiiv,- beginning at-the 12th   
chapier;isithistotyof &#x27;etre indiViclual (Abra­  
i hani)-aial his family during three genera&#x27;.   
1 firms of his descendents, alter which the   
book of ExOdus commences with the history   
of the same family, -multiplied into a nation;   
this national and family history is continued   
through the,books of the Old Testament un­  
til that of Job, which is of a peculiar charac­  
ter, diflerieg in many particulars from every   
other part of the Scriptures. There is no   
other history extant which can give•so inter­  
esting and correct view of the rise and pro­  
gress of human associations, as thin account   
of Abraham and his descendant&#x27;s, through   
all tile vicissitudes to which individuals, la­  
milies&#x27; and nations are liable. There is no   
mho&#x27; history whew the origin of a whole   
, nation is traced up to a single man, and   
i where a connected trait&#x27; of events and a   
1 regular series of persors from generation to   
generation is preserved. As the history of   
a family, it is.intimately connected with our   
religious principles and opinions, for it is the   
family from which (in his human character)   
Jesus Christ descended. It begins by relat   
fag the commands of God to Abraham,  
to   
u   
abandon his country, his kidred, end his   
father&#x27;s house; and to go to a land which   
He would show him. This command was   
accompanied by two promises; from which,   
and from their fulfilment arose the differ­  
ences whiell I have just noticed between the   
history of the Jews and that of everyother   
nation. The first of these promises Was,   
&#x27;,That -God would make Abraham a great   
natfont and.bless him ;&quot; the second, and in­  
comparably the most- important was, that   
&quot;in him all the families of the earth should   
be blessed.&quot; This promise was made about   
two thou Sand years before the birth of Christ,   
and in Min had its fulfilment. When Abra­  
ham in obedience to the comforted of God,   
had gone into the land of Canaan, the Lord   
appeared . unto him and made loin a third   
promise, which was that he should give that   
land to a naticin. which should descend front   
&#x27;him, as a possession t this was&#x27; fulfiled be­  
tween five and six hundred years after Ward.   
In reading all the historical books of both   
the Old&#x27;&#x27; arid New l&#x27;eStainiants, as well&#x27; as   
the books of the Prophets, you should al-  
Ways bear in mind the reference which they   
have to these promises of God in Abraham.   
All the history is no more than a rierrative   
. of the particular manner, and the detail. of   
events by. dlfich those promises .were,,f4l­

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
LETTER FROM HON. JOHN Q. ADAMS TO  
HIS SON ON THE BIBLE AND ITS TEACH-  
INGS.  
  
LETTER ill.  
  
The second general point of view, in which  
I propose for you to consider the Bible, to the  
end that it may “thoreughly furrish you unto all  
good works,” is in the historical character.  
  
To a man of liberal education, the study of  
history is not only useful, and important, but al-  
together indispensable, and with regard to the  
history contained in the Bible the observation  
which Cicero makes respecting that of his own  
country is much more emphatically applicable,  
“that it is not so much praise-worthy to be ac-  
  
heaped upon them without measure; but ob-  
se1ve-—it contained the principle of —it  
was assigned to them as a duty—and the heav-  
lest of penalties was denou upon its trans-  
gression. They were not to discuss the wis-  
dom or justice of this command; they were not  
to inquire why it had been enforced upon them,  
nor could they have the slightest possi le motive  
for the inquiry; unqualified felicity and immor-  
tality were already theirs; wretchedness and  
death were alone forbidden them, but placed  
within their reach as merely trials of their obe-  
dience. They violated the law; they forfeited  
their joy and immortality; they ‘brought into  
the world, death and all our woe.”” F  
  
Here, then, is an extreme case in which the  
mere principle of obedience could be tried—a  
command to abstain from that which every mo-  
tive of reason and interest would have deterred  
had the command’ never been given—a com-  
mand given in the easiest of all possible forms,  
requiring not so much as ap action of any kind,  
but merely forbearance; and its transgression  
was so severely punished, the only inference we  
ean draw from it is that the most aggravated of  
all crimes, and that which includes in itself all  
others, is disobedience to the will of God. Let  
us consider how the principle of obedience is in-  
culcated in the history of Abraham, by a case  
in the extreme. God commanded Abraham to  
abandon forever his country, his kindred and  
his father’s house, to go, he knew not where;  
promising, as a reward of his obedience, to bless  
him and his posterity, though he was then child-  
less; he was required to renounce everything  
that could most contribute to the happiness and  
comfort of his life, and which was in his actual  
enjoyment; to become a houseless, friendless,  
wanderer upon the earth, om the mere faith of the  
promise that a land should be shown him which  
his descendants should possess—that they should  
be a great nation—and that through them all  
mankind should receive in future ages 4 bless-  
ing.  
  
The obedience required of Adam, was merely  
to retain all the blessings he enjoyed; the obedi-  
ence of Abraham was to sacrifice all that he pos-  
sessed for the vague and distant prospect of a fu-  
ture compensation to his posterity; the self con-  
trol and self denial required of Adam, were in  
themselves the slightest that imagination can  
coneeive,—but its failure was punished by the  
forfeitare of all his enjoyments; the self-domin-  
ion to be exercised by Abraham was of the most  
painful kind—bat its accomplishment will ul-  
timately be rewarded by the resteration of all  
that was forfeited by Adam.  
  
This restoration, however was to be obtained  
by no ordinary proof of obedience; the sacrifice  
of mere personal blessings, however great, could  
not lay the foundation for the redemption of man-  
kind from death; the voluntary submission of Je-  
sus Christ to his own death, in the must excru-  
ciating and ignominious form, was to consum-  
mate the great plan of redemption. But the sub-  
tnission of Abraham to sacrifice his beloved and  
only son Isaac—the child promised by God him

of particular nations: Third, that of particular  
institutions: Fourth, that of single families: |  
and Fifth, that of individual men. The Jast two |  
of these classes are generally distinguished by |  
the name of memoirs and biography.  
  
All these classes of history are to he found in|  
the Bible, and it may be worth your while to)  
discriminate them oue from another. The uni-|  
versal history is short, and all contained in the)  
first eleven chapters of Genesis, together with the |  
first chapter of the book of Chronicles, which is |  
httle more then a geneslogical list of names; bat |

precise account of the time from the creation  
until the birth of Abraham. This is the founda-  
  
fane historians hereafter. | would advise yp. «3  
ways to reflect upon their narratives with refer-  
  
ence to it with respect to the chronology. A cor-  
rect idea of this 1s so necessary to understand all  
history, ancient and modern, that I may hereat-  
ter write you something farther concerning it; |  
for the present I shall only recommend to your |  
particular attention the fifth aod eleventh chap- |  
ters of Genesis, and request you to cast up and |  
write the amount of the age of the world when |  
Abraham was born.  
The remainder of the book of Genesis, begin-  
ning at the 12th chapter, is a history of one in- |  
dividual (Abraham) and his family, during three  
generations of his descendants, after which the |  
book of Exodus commences with the history of |  
the same family, multiplied into a nation; this |  
national and family history is continued through  
the books of the old Testament until that of |  
Job, which is of a peculiar character, differing |  
in many particulars from every other part of the |  
  
  
  
  
  
| Scriptures. There is no other history extant}  
  
which can give 80 interesting and correct view  
of the rise and progress of human associations  
as this account of Abraham and his descendants, |  
through all the vicissitudes to which individuals,  
families and nations are liable. There is no  
other history, where the origin of a whole nation  
is traced up toasingle man, and where a connect-  
ed train of events and a regular series of per-  
sons from generation to generation is preserved.  
As the history of a family, it is ultimately con-  
nected with our religious principles and opin-  
ions, for it is the family frem which (in his hu-  
man character) Jesus Christ descended. It be-  
gins by relating the commands of God to Abra-  
ham to abandon his country, his kindred, and  
father’s house, and go to the land which He  
“would show him. This command was accoin-  
panied by two promises, from which, and from  
their fulfilment, arose the differences which |  
have just noticed between the history of the  
Tews, and that of every other nation.  
  
The first of these promises was ‘*That God  
would make Abraham a great nation, and  
bless him;” the second, and incomparably the  
most important one was, that‘tin him all the  
families of the earth should be blessed.”’ This  
promise was made about two thousand years be-  
fore the birth of Christ, and in Him had its fulfil-  
ment. When Abraham, in obedience to the  
command of God, had gone into the land of Ca-  
naan, the Lord appeared unto him and made  
him a third promise, which was that he should  
give that land toa nation which should descend  
from him, as a possession; this was fulfilled be-  
tween five and six hundred years afterward,  
In reading all the historical bouks of both the  
Old and New Testaments, as well as the books  
of the Pruphets, you should always bear in mind  
the reference which they have to these three  
promises of God to Abraham. All the history  
is no more than a narrative of the particular  
manner. and the detail of events by which those  
promises were fulfilled.  
  
In the account of the creation, and the fall of  
man, I have already remarked that the moral  
doctrine inculeated by the Bible is, that the  
great consummation ot all human virtue consists  
in obedience to the will of God. When we  
come hereafter to speak of the Bible in its ethi-  
cal character, I shal! endeavor to show you the  
intrinsic excellence of this principle; but I shail  
now only remark how strongly the principle it-  
self is illustrated, first it the account of the fall,  
and next by the history of Abraham. In  
the account of the creation we are informed that  
God, after having made the world, created the  
first human pair, and ‘‘gave them dominion over  
every living thing that moveth upon the earth.”’  
He gave them also ‘‘every herb bearing seed,  
and the fruit of every tree for meat;”’ all this  
we are told ‘‘God saw was very good.  
  
Thus the immediate possession of every thing  
was given them, and its perpetual enjoyment  
secured to their descendants, on condition of ab-  
staining from the ‘‘fruit of the tree of knowledge  
of good and evil.”” It is altogether immaterial  
to my present remarks whether the narrative is  
to be understood in a literal or allegorical sense,  
as not only the knowledge, but the possession of  
created good was granted; the fruit of the tree,  
could confer upon them no knowledge but that  
of evil, and the’ command was pothing more  
than to abstain from that knowledge—to forbear  
from rushing upon their own destruction,  
  
It is not sufficient to say that this was a  
command in its own nature light and easy; it

self, and through whom all the greater promises  
were ‘to be carried into effect, the feelings of na-  
ture, the parent&#x27;s bowels, were all required to  
be sacrificed by Abraham to the blind, unques-  
tioning principle of ubedience to the will of God,  
The blood of Isaac was not indeed shed—the  
butchery of an only son by the hand of his fa-  
ther, was a sacrifice which a merciful God did  
not require to be completely executed; but as an  
instance of obedience it was imposed upon Abra-  
ham, and nothing lees than the voice of an an-  
  
gel from Heaven could arrest his uplifted arm, |  
  
and withhold him from sheathing his knife in the  
heart of his child. It was upon this testimoni-  
al of obedience that God’s promise of redemp-  
tion was expressly renewed to Abraham. *‘‘in  
thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be  
blessed, because thou hast obeyed my voice.”’—

necessary to understand all history, an-

 write you something farth reoncerning it  
for the present I shall only recommend to  
your particular attention, the fifth and ele.  
venth chapters of Genesis, and request  
family, multip ied into a nation; the na  
  
tional and famity history is continued  
 through the books of the Old Testament  
untit that of Job, which is of a peculiar  
character, differing in many particular  
from any other pad of the Scriptures,  
There is no other history extant, which  
can give so iteresting and correct views  
of the rise and progress of human associa­  
tions, as this account of Abraham and his  
descendants, through all vicisitudes to  
which individuals, familes, and nations  
are liable. There is no other history  
where the origin of a whole nation is trac­  
ed up to a single man, and where a con­  
nected train of events and a regular series  
of persons from one generation to another  
is preserved. As the history of a family,  
it is intimately connected with our religious  
principles and opinions, for it is the family  
from which (in his human character) Jesus  
Christ descended. It begins by relating  
the commands of God to Abraham to  
abandon his country, his kindred, and his  
father&#x27;s house; and to go to a land which  
He would show him. This command was  
accompanied hy two promises; from which,  
nd from their fulfilment, arose the diffe­  
rence which I have just noticed, between  
the history of the Jews and that of every  
other nation.  
The first of these promises wasThat  
God would make Abraham a great nation,  
and bless him;&quot; the second, and incompar­  
ably the most important was, that in him  
all the families of the earth should be  
blessed.&quot; This promise was made two  
thous and years before the birth of Christ,  
and in Him had its fulfillment. When
