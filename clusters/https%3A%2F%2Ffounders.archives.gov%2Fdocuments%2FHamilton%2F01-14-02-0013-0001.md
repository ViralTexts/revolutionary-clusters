 President of the Senate]  
Sir,  
The next most important articles of enquiry, involved in the resolutions of the House of Representatives of the 23d of January last, and in the observations, which have been [made] respecting the conduct of this department, relates to the loans which have been negociated under the Acts of the fourth and twelfth of August, one thousand seven hundred and ninety.  
The papers, which have been transmitted to the House, by order of the President, disclose the following particulars.  
1st. That the immediate superintendance of the business of the loans was confided to the department of the Treasury, being naturally connected with it. This trust, besides the original instructions for regulating the execution of it, which have been communicated, was, of course, subject to such directions, from time to time, as the President should think fit to give, or as occasions should require. A considerable latitude of discretion, nevertheless, from the very nature of the case, attended it; so as justly to leave on the head of this department, a complete responsibility in all instances, where special exceptions do not appear.  
2d. That the first loan, which was obtained, was undertaken and completed by the agency of Wilhem and Jan Willink, and Nicholaas and Jacob Van Staphorst and Hubbard, who, both under the former and present government, have been, and are the Bankers of the United States at Amsterdam.  
3d. That with the single exception of the first loan, William Short, Esquire, then Charge des Affairs at the Court of France, now resident Minister at the Hague, was constituted the sole Agent of this department, for carrying into effect, the powers confided to it, with this qualification only, that if any negociation with a Prince of State, to whom any part of the debt to be discharged by the loans was due, shoud be requisite—the same was to be carried on through the person, who in capacity of Minister, Charge des affairs, or otherwise, then was, or thereafter might be charged with transacting the affairs of the United States, with such Prince or State.  
  
4th. That all payments, which have been made out of the proceeds of the loans, have been made by the immediate and special order of Mr. Short, except those, upon the Bills of the Treasurer for the monies drawn to this country, and those to the money lenders in Holland; which were made in course by our bankers, at the periods they respectively became due. This consequently embraces all the payments to France: the very last of which, though agreed for by Mr. Morris, in consequence of his having been employed for a special purpose by Mr. Short, was not and could not be completed, but by the same immediate and special direction of Mr. Short.  
It moreover appears, from the same papers, and more fully from the correspondence at large, now before the Senate, that except in the particular instance, which has been just stated, with regard to Mr. Morris, there has been no other agency in the whole business, than that of Mr. Short, and of the Bankers at Antwerp and Amsterdam, whom he necessarily employed, as instruments in the negociations with the money lenders, and in the receipt and disbursement of the monies borrowed. These, as already mentioned, were at Amsterdam, the two Houses of Wilhem and Jan Willink, and of Nicholaas and Jacob Van Staphorst and Hubbard; at Antwerp, a Mr. G: De Wolf was the Banker.  
It may not be without its uses, to add, that the monies proceeding from the loans have constantly remained in the hands of the respective Bankers, till they have been paid over to the creditors; namely, the French treasury, or their bankers, the money-lenders or their representatives, the holders of the bills drawn from this country by the Treasurer. Neither Mr. Short, nor Mr. Morris has ever had possession of a single guilder. The latter indeed has never even had power over one, excepting merely a sum of 105.000 guilders, by letters of mine, dated the 13th September last, placed at his disposal for paying it at Paris, according to stipulation, the interest on the debt due to foreign Officers. The fact is, and it is so demonstrated by the correspondence already referred to, that I never wrote a line to Mr. Morris, on the subject of the loans or their proceeds, but in reference to the case just mentioned, of the interest payable to foreign officers; in respect to which, local situation governed.  
One more circumstance only is necessary to be noticed in this place, with a view to the elucidation intended: It is this—that the last payment, though originating prior to the change in the political position of France, of the 10th of August last, not having been consummated till the 6th of September following, fell, of course, under the disposition of those then in possession of the power of the nation.  
It could not but have been unexpected to me, that exception should be taken to the report lately made by me on the subject of foreign loans, for the omission of details, which I did not, at the time, and do not yet conceive to have been called for, by the terms of the resolutions, upon which it was founded. The request, addressed to the President by those resolutions, was, that he would cause to be laid before the House, a particular account of the sums borrowed under his authority by the United States, the terms, on which each loan was obtained, the applications, which had been made of the monies, agreeably to appropriations, the balances, if any, which remained unapplied, specifying also, at what times interest commenced, on the several sums obtained, and at what times, it was stopped by the several payments made. It was not natural to imagine that these expressions were designed to comprehend a specification of the precise authorities under which the loans were negociated, of the names of the persons, by whom they were negociated, of the particular place or places, where the balance unexpended, of the sums that had been drawn for to the United States, were deposited. Still less natural was it for me to anticipate surmises, which could give to such particulars, the shadow of importance. But, as animadversions have attended the omission of those details, I ought to regard it as an admonition to me, to be more full and precise in my present communication; a motive, which co-operates with my desire, to throw all possible light upon the subject.  
  
The first general circumstance, which requires to be noticed and explained, after the particulars, that have been communicated, is this—That all the loans, which have been hitherto obtained, have been made under the authority of both Acts, without particular reference to either.  
The idea originally entertained, was to conduct them on a different plan, founding each loan upon one, or other of the Acts; as will be seen by my letter of the 28th of August 1790, to our Bankers at Amsterdam; at the same time, that it will appear, from the same letter, that the separation did not appear to me a matter of consequence, and that I anticipated the possibility of a difficulty in adhering to it, in the particular case. That difficulty proved, in the opinion of the Bankers, to be of sufficient moment, to render the arrangement contemplated, under the circumstances of the case, unadvisable; as they inform me in their answer to the above mentioned letter.  
But prior to the receipt of that answer, further enquiry and reflection had determined me to abandon my original idea as likely to produce embarrassment and inconvenience, both in the negociation of the loans, and in the application of their proceeds. It was accordingly concluded to let the loans proceed indiscriminately, upon both Acts.  
These loans were to have reference to two purposes—first, the reimbursement of the foreign debt, second, the purchase of the domestic debt, at its market price.  
There were weighty reasons for carrying on both these operations concurrently. The arrears to France had been a considerable time accumulating. It was, in every sense, proper, that a reimbursement of them should begin without delay, and desirable, for obvious reasons, that it should go on, without any very considerable chasms or intermissions. This manner of proceeding could not but have the fairest chance of being the most satisfactory and convenient to France; unless, indeed, the business were to have proceeded upon the principle of an entire postponement of the domestic object, to that of the reimbursement.  
But very cogent reasons rendered this course not the most eligible. The early commencement of purchases of the debt was a matter of real and great importance.  
It was important in two relations; as it regarded the advantages of the government, from redeeming a portion of the debt at low prices; and still more, as it regarded the savings to the country, from raising the price of stock on foreign purchasers; the beneficial influence upon the credit of the nation, abroad and at home, to be expected from a quick appreciation of the public obligations; the benefit to the public creditors in general, and to the most meritorious classes of them, in particular, which would result from the same cause; all which objects were suggested from the treasury, as motives to the provision respecting purchases, and are evidently contemplated in the preamble of the Act, which makes that provision.  
Exclusive of the other advantages, which have been cited, and which are of a nature truly precious and important, that of preventing foreigners from acquiring the property of our citizens at a great under-value, is too obvious, not to be estimated, as it ought to be, at first sight. It cannot require argument, to shew how great an evil it was, that foreigners should be able to acquire, with nine or ten, that, for which the country would ultimately have to pay them twenty, with full interest, in the interval; nor how much it merited the attention of the government to prevent or lessen so serious an evil.  
But the influence, which the purchases by the government may have had upon this event, may not be equally obvious. Price naturally keeps pace with competition and demand; whatever encreases the latter, necessarily tends to an augmentation of the former. Merely, then, as another purchaser, by adding to the competition and demand, the purchases of the government were calculated to influence a rise of price. But they had an effect, more than proportioned to their real extent. Imagination has much to do in all such questions, and in scarcely any thing, so much, as in what relates to public funds. Experience proves, that it is here exerted with uncommon effort. The appearance of the government, as a purchaser, has not failed to excite the expectation of a greater demand than was real, because the extent of the resources to be employed might be very great, and was unknown; which, by stimulating the zeal of those, who wanted to buy, lest the price should rise suddenly and considerably upon them, and, by encouraging those, who wanted to sell, under the hope of a better price, to hold back the commodity, has, in both ways, generally contributed to give a spring to the market. Prices once raised, when founded on intrinsic value, tend to maintain themselves; because those, who have given them, are, for the most part, interested in keeping them up. And every new impulse, which they receive, serves to carry them rapidly to their just level.  
Those, who have been most attentive to the operation of the public purchases, will have the least doubt, that they had a material agency in accelerating the appreciation of the public stock.  
An enquiry naturally arises here. Were the monies, which were drawn from Europe on account of the foreign loans, the instruments of the purchases, to which these beneficial effects are ascribed?  
I answer, that these purchases are to be attributed to the instrumentality of that fund—that, had it not been for this resource, they could not have been made at the early periods, when most of them were made. The course of the transaction will be fully, and with more propriety, explained in another place.  
An attention to both objects—to the reimbursement to France, and to the purchase of the debt, rendered expedient, even, a subdivision of the first loan. Considerations of the moment seconded those of a general nature, to induce an immediate payment to that country. The loan had been undertaken, without previous authority from hence, with a view to such payment. This was known, and a correspondent expectation excited. The immediate situation of the French finances rendered a payment, at the particular juncture, more than ordinarily interesting. In such a state of things, there could be no hesitation, about applying a large part of the loan to that object. Another part of it was, of necessity, applied to the payment of the sums, that were falling due on the Dutch loans. And, it is presumed, that the reasons, which have been assigned, will appear to have been sufficiently powerful, to have dictated the drawing of a part of it to the United States.  
  
Accordingly, a million and a half of the three millions borrowed were appropriated to France, something more than 800.000 guilders, were drawn for here, and the remainder of the loan was left to be disbursed in Holland.  
It shall not be concealed, though I am aware that the acknowledgement may be a subject of criticism, that the conduct, which was pursued, both with regard to this and to the succeeding loan, was, in some degree, influenced by a collateral consideration. The government had but just adopted a plan for the restoration of public credit. The periodical payment of interest was to commence on the 1st of April 1791. A considerable part of the revenue, out of which the monies were to arise, was only to begin to accrue on the first of January preceding. This revenue was liable to credit of four, six, and twelve months.  
How far its eventual product would answer expectation—how far the punctuality of payments could be relied upon, were points unascertained, and which required, to their ascertainment, much more experience, than had been obtained. In such a situation, it was not only natural, but necessary for an Administrator of the finances, to doubt—and, doubting, it was his duty to call, to the aid of the public credit, every auxiliary, which it was in his power to command. He was bound to reflect, that a failure in any stipulated payment would be fatal to the dawning credit of the country—to the reputation of the government just beginning to rise. That a wound inflicted upon either, at so early a stage, under all the circumstances of opposition to the Constitution, which had existed in the community, would have been deeply felt, and might have either not have admitted of a cure at all, or not till after a length of time, and a series of mischiefs—that it could not but be an important service rendered to the country, to ward off so great a misfortune, by the temporary use of any extraordinary resource, which might be at hand, till time was given for more effectual provision.  
If, in the course of such reflections, a doubt had occurred, about the strict regularity of what was contemplated, as a possible resort, a mind sufficiently alive to the public interest, and sufficiently firm in the pursuit of it, would have dismissed that doubt, as an obstacle, suggested by a pusillanimous caution, to the exercise of those higher motives, which ought ever to govern a man, invested with a great public trust. It would have occurred, that there was a reasonable ground to rely, that the necessity of the case, and the magnitude of the occasion, would insure a justification, and that if the contrary should happen, there remained still the consolation of having sacrificed personal interest and tranquility, no matter to what extent, to an important public interest, and of having avoided the humiliation, which would have been justly due to an opposite, and to a feeble conduct.  
The disposition, which was resolved upon, with regard to the first loan, involved necessarily a decision of the point, that the loans might be placed on the joint foundation of both Acts. That loan having been undertaken, as already mentioned, without previous authority, and consequently without a particular eye to either act, it was probable that it would be found too late, to make an apportionment of one part of the sum borrowed, to one Act, of another part to the other Act. In that case, the distributive application of the fund to the different objects was to be relinquished, or the possibility was to be admitted, of the loan being left to stand upon the authority of both Acts. The same disposition of the first loan will also illustrate the convenience and expediency of the plan, which was finally adopted, that is, of placing the loans on the basis of both Acts.  
The idea of a concurrent execution of both the objects, to which the loans were destined, could not conveniently have been pursued, upon the plan of a separation of the loans; which, to be effectual, would include the strict application of the proceeds of each, to the purposes of the particular Act, upon which it was founded.  
Amsterdam was naturally looked to, as the great scene of the intended loans. There, as every where else, there is but a certain quantity of money floating in the market, from time to time, beyond the necessary demands of trade and industry, seeking for employment in loans. This quantity, of course, varies at different periods, from a variety of causes. Of the quantity at any time afloat, but a certain proportion can be commanded by any one borrowing power; owing to the competition of other borrowers, who have, each, their connections through their bankers, with different sets of undertakers and money-lenders. Nor is it always, that considerable loans can be had at any rate. There are certain seasons only, when they are practicable.  
To have brought two loans upon the market, at one time, as an opportunity of borrowing offered, which must have been the case, in order to make provision for both the objects in question, if the principle of a separation of the loans had been adopted, would have been to exhibit to the money-lenders a very unusual appearance. With men, known to be much influenced by prejudice and habit, such an appearance could not have failed to prove a source of speculation and conjecture; and might have led to a confused idea, that the wants of the United States were excessive; a supposition, by no means calculated to promote their credit. It would, moreover, have been a departure from that simplicity of procedure, which, where numbers are concerned, is always of moment to a right conception of the business to be accomplished, and ought not to be abandoned, but for reasons of real utility and weight.  
To have instituted the loans successively, founding each upon one or the other of the Acts, would have had a tendency to occasion longer intervals between the payments to France, than was desirable. The intervention of a loan for the purpose of purchases, would have created, of course, a very considerable chasm. It may be objected, that such chasms did happen, on the plan which was pursued. This is true in two instances; but the most material of the two proceeded from casualties foreign to the plan itself; which are detailed in the correspondence more than once alluded to.  
  
It is possible too, that a separation of the loans might have rendered it less easy to take advantage of a state of the market, favorable to their extension at a particular juncture. The loan to be brought on the market might relate to the purchase of the debt. The moment might be favorable to a more considerable loan, than was within the limits prescribed for that object, and the opportunity might slip before a second could be instituted. In this business, moments are often of importance, and are to be embraced with promptitude and dexterity.  
Thus it appears, that in different ways, the negociation of the loans might have been embarrassed by their separation.  
But the most obvious, if not the most serious of the inconveniencies, which would have attended it, respects the application of the sums borrowed. This could not then have been moulded, as the interest or policy of the government might dictate. A loan for the purchase of the debt might have been made under prospects, promising a ready and beneficial investment of it; but before the investment was made, a change of the market might render it ineligible—involving the alternative, either of a disadvantageous investment, or of leaving perhaps a large sum of money a long time unemployed. Such a state of things might have produced to the Banks an advantage, and to the government a loss, of magnitude sufficient to give color to a surmise, that the public interest had been sacrificed to the profit of those institutions. The contrary course has essentially avoided that evil; which in this and in other instances, would have been incident, in a far greater degree, to the modes of proceeding, contrasted with those that have been pursued, than has in reality attended them.  
Or political considerations might have rendered it advisable to transfer the application of the fund from one object to the other.  
Of this, the case of St. Domingo presents an example. It might have happened on the plan of separate loans, that there was no fund in hand but for the purchase of the debt. Then, on the principle of that plan, there would have been no fund in the disposition of the Executive, applicable to the other object, which would have embarrassed the performance of a duty towards a friendly power, and in a way, which included the positive advantage to the country of paying directly a part of its foreign debt, in its own productions.  
Such were the embarrassments avoided, and such the conveniences secured, by the plan of making the loans indiscriminately upon the authority of both Acts.  
In the opposite plan, I can discern no counterbalancing advantage nor convenience.  
Consequently, if both are equally legal, there can be no doubt, which of them ought to have been preferred.  
If there be any want of legality in the plan, which has been pursued, I was not, at the time, and am not yet sensible of it.  
I know of no rule, which renders it illegal in an agent, having from the same principal two authorities to borrow money, whether for one or different purposes, to unite the loans he may make, upon the foundation of both authorities: Provided the terms of them be consonant with both or either of his commissions. If the purposes are different, it will be incumbent upon him, to take care that the application of the monies borrowed makes the proper separation, and doing this he will have fulfilled his trust. To test this position, it seems only necessary to ask, whether the principal in such case would not be fully bound to the lenders?  
In reflecting originally upon the regularity of the proceeding meditated, there was but one source of hestitation; the difference in the funds, upon which the loans were to rest. But the following reasoning satisfied the scruple: The pledging of particular funds is for the security of the lenders. If they are willing to wave the special security, by lending on the general credit of the government, or to dispense with the preference of one fund to another, where two are pledged, by lending indiscriminately on the credit of both, the one or the other circumstance must be alike indifferent to the government. The authority will have been well executed, to the extent necessary for public purposes, and if any thing remains unexecuted, it will be in enlargement, not in abridgement of the public rights. It is, however, presumed, that the practical construction in the present case will be, that the two funds pledged will constitute an aggregate, for the joint security of the monies borrowed upon both Acts.  
  
The second general circumstance respecting the foreign loans, negociated under the Acts of the 4th and 12th of August, which requires attention, relates to the terms, on which they have been obtained. These, it appears, have been represented, as neither honorable nor advantageous.  
The following facts, witnessed by the correspondence before the Senate, more than once referred to, and well known to all who have had opportunities of information, demonstrate, that the terms of those loans have been both honorable and advantageous.  
1st. There is not one of them, which originated under the Acts, that was not effected upon conditions equally favorable with those attending the loans of the cotemporary borrowing powers of the most tried resources and best established credit, and more favorable than were obtained by some powers of great respectability.  
2nd. The United States took a lead in the market, with regard to the subsequent reductions of interest; having had, either earlier, or more complete success, than any other borrowing power.  
3d. From a rate of five per cent interest, and four and a half per cent charges, which marked the level of market, when they begun their loans, they, in the course of a single year, brought down the terms to four per cent interest, and five per cent charges; that is, from an interest on the nett sum received (including an indemnification for charges) of 5.5012, something more than five and a half per cent, to an interest on the like sum of 4.4951, something less than four and a half per cent.  
When this state of things is applied to a government, only in the third year of its existence, and to a country, which had so recently emerged from a total derangement of its finances, it would seem impossible to deny, that the issue is not only honorable, but flattering; unless indeed, it can be denied, that a sound and vigorous state of credit is honorable to a nation.  
I forbear a comparison between the loans of the present and of the former government of this country, because an immense disparity of circumstances would render it an improper one—further than to take notice of a very great error, which has been, upon some occasions, advanced. It has been alleged, to disparage the management under the present, that the loans of the former government, in a situation comparatively disadvantageous, have been effected upon equal terms; and, in proof of this, an appeal has been made to the loan of 2.000.000. of guilders, at four per cent, which is of the 9th of March 1784.  
Nothing can manifest, more clearly than this, the very precipitate and superficial views, with which, suggestions on important public subjects are sometimes made. The last four per cent loan, obtained under the existing laws, including charges, is a real four and a half per cent loan, or, more exactly, a 4.4951 per cent loan. The four per cent loan of March 1784 is a real 6.6468 per cent loan. The difference, which exceeds two per cent, arises principally from extra-premiums and gratifications, which were allowed upon this loan, and which are unknown to the other.  
Much praise, no doubt, is due to the exertions, which effected the loans under the former government. A superiority of merit shall readily be conceded to them, from the circumstances, under which they were made, and their signal utility in the revolution. But it is not necessary to their eulogium, to affirm, that they were made upon equal terms, with those of the loans lately obtained, or to deny the goodness of the terms of the latter. Truth will not justify the one or the other.  
The facts, which have been stated, prove, that the terms of the loans are advantageous, as well as honorable. They are comparatively advantageous, because they are as moderate as other powers, in the best credit, have allowed; and they are absolutely advantageous, because the highest real, not nominal rate of interest, which has been given, does not exceed 5.5012, a fraction more than 5½ per cent, while the lowest real rate is 4.4951, a fraction less than 4½ per cent.  
If the question, whether advantageous or not, be tested by the purposes, for which the loans have been made, the conclusion is equally in their favor. The payments on account of the foreign debt were an indispensible obligation. Unless it can be shewn, that they might have derived from another, and more advantageous source, it will follow, that it was the interest of the government, to avail itself of the resource which has been employed, because it was its duty to discharge its obligations.  
It is sometimes urged, that foreign loans, for whatever purpose are pernicious, because they serve to drain the country of its specie for the payment of interest, and for the final reimbursement of the principal—that it would be preferable, for that reason, to procure loans at home, even at a higher rate of interest.  
To this, several answers may be given, some of a special, others of a general nature.  
In reference to the reimbursement of the foreign debt, it may be observed, that as a debt had already been incurred abroad, upon which, interest was payable, the contracting of new loans there for the reimbursement of that debt, would leave us, as to the demand for the exportation of our specie, just where we originally stood.  
Moreover, if the money could have been borrowed at home, for that reimbursement, the remittance of it would have been ruinous to the country. The mere necessity of remitting could not alone have encreased the foreign demand for our commodities; so as to deduce from an extra-exportation of them, the requisite means of payment, and if our specie was to perform the office, the country would speedily have been exhausted, to a degree inconsistent with the support of its commerce and industry. The quantity of coin in the United States has never been considerable enough for such an operation.  
But this very state of things would have rendered the procuring of the money from domestic resources impracticable. These, it may be safely affirmed, are to limited for extensive loans, of any considerable degree of permanency.  
In the last place, The expedient of domestic loans would not prevent the evil, which is desired to be prevented. Foreigners would either, in the first instance, bring their monies to subscribe them to the loans, or they would afterwards purchase the stock arising from them; and in either case, they would equally draw away the money of the country, on account of their interest and principal. The only consequence of giving a disproportionate rate of interest for domestic loans would be, that our specie would be carried away so much the faster.  
  
Experience having shewn, that nations sometimes pay more regard to their external than to their internal credit, this consideration cooperates, with reasons of convenience to induce monied men abroad, to be content with a lower rate of interest, stipulated to be paid in their own country, than if the place of payment be in another country; making even a greater difference, than is an equivalent for the expense and risk of obtaining remittances.  
The clear inference from these observations is, that with regard to the reimbursement of the foreign debt, no other expedient than that of foreign loans, was practicable or eligible.  
The utility of that part of the loans, which has reference to the purchase of the debt, has already been explained in certain views. So far as their agency has been hitherto concerned in that operation, it is a sufficient demonstration of the advantage of the measure, to state, that the sum invested in purchases up to the period of the last report to Congress, has redeemed what is equal to an annuity of 6.15 per cent, including also the advantage of sinking a capital more than 50 per cent greater than the sum expended.  
A valuable profit will arise from the investment of the sums on hand, either in a payment to the Bank, or in the purchase of Stock. The liberation of an annuity of six per cent can be secured—while upon a great part of the fund, which is to effect it, no more than 4½ per cent is payable, and less than 5½ upon the other part. The mean of these rates being 5 per cent, an annual saving of one per cent may be effect[ed], which, upon 2.000.000 of dollars, interest at 5 per cent, is equal to a capital or gross sum of 400.000 dollars; an item certainly of no inconsiderable consequence.  
Against the advantages, which are claimed in favor of the loans, it is natural to place the loss of interest incident to the delays, which have attended their application to the purposes, for which they were obtained. This leads to an examination of the cases of delay, their causes, the circumstances, if any, which counterbalance them.  
There are three instances of delay—one respecting the first loan, another, the second loan, and a third, a part of the two last loans.  
The first loan, it will be seen, was not applied, till a considerable time after its commencement. It has been already intimated, that it was undertaken without previous authority from this country. The motives to the measure are detailed in a letter from our Bankers, of the 25th. of January 1790, a copy of which accompanies the communications herewith made by order of the President. A regard to those motives led to an acceptance of the loan. Nor could it have been deemed an unfortunate circumstance, that such an auxiliary to the operations of the Treasury had been previously prepared.  
The laws, authorising the loans, passed the 4th and 12th of August. As early as the 28th of that Month, the acceptance above mentioned was communicated, and the application of 1.500.000 flori[n]s, in a payment to France, directed. So far, no time was lost, more than could not have been avoided.  
But the bills for the sum to be brought here were not drawn till some months after. This proceeded from an unwillingness to risk the public credit, by drawing before there was a certainty of funds to answer the drafts. It was not impossible, that the great delay, which had attended the passing the law for borrowing, might have led the Bankers to come to some arrangement with the money-lenders, for surrendering the monies paid in, and terminating the loan. Independent of this source of apprehension, they had expressed themselves, in their letter, communicating the step they had taken, to this effect. “To spare the United States all possible advance of interest, while the money shall remain unappropriated, we shall issue the recipisses, at the option of the buyers to take them so late as they please, on the expectation the three millions would be placed in a few months.” This, though it announced an expectation that the monies would be paid in, in a few months, did not render the event certain. And as the Bankers appeared, from that precaution, to have adverted to the idea of saving the United States an advance of interest, it was supposable that they might have found means still further to procrastinate the payments, or a considerable part of them, till they had received a confirmation of the loan. This policy would have been the more natural, as they risked the loss of interest themselves, if the transaction should not have been finally ratified.  
Under such circumstances, I thought it most prudent to defer the drafts till advice was received of the actual progress of the loans. There was no room to hesitate between the loss of a small sum in interest, and the danger of committing the public credit by a premature operation.  
The second case of delay relates to the second loan. It was occasioned by a determination to suspend the orders for its application, till information was received of its having been contracted for.  
One motive to this determination has been already intimated; namely, the yet untried and immature state of our fiscal arrangements. The general reasoning on this head was strengthened by an occurrence altogether unlooked for, which disclosed itself on the 23d of August 1790, eleven days after the rising of Congress; an occurrence, which they had not contemplated, in their pecuniary dispositions. I allude to the commencement of an Indian war, which was announced in a letter from Governor St. Clair, dated on the above mentioned day; the progressive extent, and consequences of which, would of course not be foreseen. Under such circumstances, I judged it for the public interest and safety, to hold the resource, which the prospect of a loan presented, under the power of the Treasury, till advice should be received of the actual institution of the loan; with intention, then to dispose of it, as should appear advisable, under a better matured view of our pecuniary situation and prospects.  
Hence, the delay, which attended the application of the second loan; the first in fact, that originated subsequent to the laws for borrowing. But after advice had been received of its having been set on foot, no time was lost in converting it, with due dispatch, to its proper uses: There was only, not an anticipation of its application. As early as May 24th 1791, I wrote a letter to Mr. Short, (a copy of which is in possession of the House) empowering him to apply the proceeds of all future loans, as they should accrue, in payments to France; except as to such sums, as therein were, or afterwards should be previously and specially reserved. This arrangement was calculated to obviate the inconvenience of leaving the proceeds of the loans, for any considerable time, unemployed. At the period of making it, and not sooner, the public prospects appeared to me sufficiently unfolded, to render a general and permanent disposition free from hazard. This instruction proceeded, in due season, all the loans subsequent to that of March 1791.  
Whatever delay, therefore, may have attended succeeding investments for paying the French debt, is not attributable to this department: And, I think, it will not appear, that any has been incurred, in respect to the sums, which were destined for the public service here. In judging of this point, it will be proper to observe, that a latitude of six months for making their payments has been reserved to the money-lenders, though with liberty to make them earlier. It was, however, necessary for the Treasury, to regulate its bills, according to the possible delay, lest they should not meet adequate funds. The general policy adopted was to let them fall upon the rear of each loan; this giving a freer course for early payments to France, and best conciliating a certainty of funds for answering the bills, with as little double interest as possible.  
It will appear, that notwithstanding the arrangement, which was made, a considerable time intervened between the two last payments to France, while there were funds in hand waiting for employment. It may be expected, that the causes of this procrastination, though, as I have said, not imputable to this department, should be unfolded to the House. Particular circumstances, however, induce me to confine myself to stating generally, that the delay proceeded in the first place, from an expectation to Mr. Short, and kept up, from time to time, by the French Minister of Marine, that a plan would be adopted, to which a decree of the National Assembly was requisite, for converting a large sum into supplies for St. Domingo, which Mr. Short concluded, must justly come out of the foreign fund, and consequently suspended its application in Europe. In the second place, from a desire to settle, previously to further payments, a definitive rule, by which the monies paid, should be liquidated and credited to the United States.  
Both the one and the other appears to have been procrastinated, from period to period, by the disordered state of French affairs, and to have finally issued contrary to expectation. It would be an unnecessary commitment of my opinion to declare, how far the delay appears to me to have [been] justified by the causes. But being led by the occasion to take notice of it, I think it improper to send it abroad, liable perhaps to misconstruction, without observing, that the inducements appear to me to have been weighty—that the delays naturally grew out of the circumstances, and that I am entirely persuaded of the goodness of the motives which governed. The correspondence before the Senate, contains the particulars of the transaction.  
Having pointed out the instances of material delay, which happened, and the causes of them, it remains to state what circumstances there are to counterbalance the loss on that account.  
These circumstances are of two kinds.  
1st.  Gain by exchange in the sale of the Bills drawn by the Treasury, and upon the higher rate of interest on the credits which were given for those bills, than was payable upon the fund, upon which they were drawn.  
2nd.  Gain by exchange in the payments to France.  
According to my calculation, founded on the best information extant, the real par of the metals between the United States and Amsterdam, makes a current guilder equal to 35 89/106 ninetieths of a dollar. The lowest rate, which has been obtained for the bills, has been 36 4/11 ninetieths, with an allowance of sixty days credit, without interest. Making a deduction for the interest, the bills were still sold above the true par. In some instances they have been sold as high as 40 cents and 7 mills per guilder, with interest for the whole term of the credit given.  
  
The rate of interest for the credits allowed upon the bills was 6 per cent, the mean interest paid upon the fund 5 per cent, producing consequently a gain of one per cent.  
With regard to the payments to France, if the current rate of exchange between Paris and Amsterdam, at the moment of each remittance or payment, were to govern, a large profit would result to the United States. But certain equitable considerations will produce deductions, which will greatly lessen this advantage; yet, making a liberal allowance for them, there is ground to calculate, that a saving may be made in this particular, more than sufficient to indemnify for the loss of interest.  
Hence, any positive advantage, which will have been otherwise gained, will probably be undiminished by that circumstance.  
I proceed, in the next place, to state the views, which prevailed, respecting the sums, that have been, from time to time, drawn for; the purposes they have hitherto answered, and the further advantages to be expected from the measure.  
The direct object of all the sums drawn for, prior to July 1792, was the purchase of the debt. A collateral consideration, which operated in the first stages of the drawing, has also been mentioned. It has likewise been stated, that the early purchases of the debt are to be ascribed to the instrumentality of the fund derived from the loans. This idea shall now be explained.  
Two mistakes appear to have influenced the impressions, which have been entertained, in relation, directly or indirectly, to this subject. First, it seems to have been all along forgotten, that a considerable part of the duties is always outstanding on account of the credits which are given, whence the assertion, that the sinking fund has continually overflowed from domestic resources. Second, it seems to have been taken for granted, that the proceeds of the loans have remained apart, distinct from the mass of the money in the treasury; while in truth, the course of the business has been to turn them over to the Treasurer by warrants, as they have been received, so as to form a part of the aggregate, from time to time, appearing in his hands, and in his accounts. The Banks have been the agents employed for selling these bills. Sometimes warrants on account have issued upon them, for the sums accruing from the sales, at other times, the warrants have been deferred, till the whole proceeds of any parcel have been received, and the accounts of the Banks settled at the treasury; as the state of the treasury has happened to render the one or the other most convenient.  
The Banks of North America and New York were the agents for the sale of all the Bills, which were sold, prior to April 1792, amounting to 1.006.526 dollars and 36 cents. Of this sum, 361.391 dollars and 34 cents were passed over to the Treasury in 1791—327.126 dollars and 22 cents, in March 1792, and 140.000 dollars in June following—the residue having remained, as heretofore stated, in deposit with the Bank of North America, upon a special consideration. This is exclusive of certain bills, furnished for the use of the department of State, amounting to 78.766 dollars and 67 cents.  
The remainder of the bills which have been sold, beginning in April 1792, were sold by the Bank of the United States, and its branches at New-York and Baltimore. The accounts of the sales had been just made out for settlement, when the present enquiry began, but warrants had not yet issued for placing the proceeds in the Treasury. It will be remarked, that from the terms of credit allowed, they only began to be receivable in October last; the 26th day of which month, the first return made by the Bank shews a sum of 127.225 dollars and 53 cents received; and that the collection had not been completed, when the accounts of sales were rendered.  
There are different views of the subject, which will enable the House to perceive, that the possession of the fund in question was necessary to enable the Treasury to furnish the means of making all the purchases, which were made prior to July 1792.  
It is true, that there was a surplus of revenue to the end of the year 1790, equal to 1.374.656 dollars and 40 cents, which was appropriated to purchases of the debt, and from the credits then given upon the duties, this surplus would naturally come into the Treasury, in the course of the year 1791.  
But the legislature foreseeing that the revenue of 1791, from the same cause, could not actually be in the Treasury, within that year, to face the appropriations upon it (which, it is to be observed, were nearly commensurate with the fund) inserted a clause in the law appropriating the surplus of 1790, to the purchase of the debt, which authorised a reservation of so much of that surplus, as might be necessary to make the payments of interest during 1791, in case of a deficiency in the receipts into the Treasury, on account of the current revenue of the year.  
It will appear to the House, upon a recurrence to the Treasurer’s quarterly account ending the 30th of September 1791, that the balance of Cash then on hand was 662,233 dollars and 99 cents.  
At that time, there had been paid into the Treasury, upon warrants, from the proceeds of the bills drawn upon the foreign fund, 361.391 dollars and 34 cents. Consequently, the balance of cash, had it not been for that auxiliary, would have been only 300.842 dollars and 65 cents; considering the whole balance in the treasury, as representing an equal sum of the proceeds of the Bills.  
Even in a time of complete peace, in a country, where a small extent of monied capital forbids a reliance upon large pecuniary aids to be suddenly obtained, a prudent administrator of the finances could not feel entirely at ease, with a less sum at all times in the command of the treasury, than 500.000 dollars, for meeting current demands and extra-exigencies, which, in the affairs of a nation, are every moment to be expected. But, with a war actually on hand, and a possibility of its extension to a more serious length, he would be inexcusable in leaving himself with a less sum at command; unless from an impracticability of doing otherwise. It would be always his duty to combine two considerations—the chance of extra-calls for money, and a possibility of some failure in the receipts which were expected. Derangements of various kinds may happen in the commercial circle, capable of interrupting, for a time, the punctual course of payments to the Treasury. It is necessary, to a certain extent, to be prepared for such casualties.  
But during the year 1791, there was a circumstance, which operated as an additional reason for keeping a respectable sum always on hand. The loans of the domestic debt were going on, till the last of September of that year, while, at the same time, the interest was in a course of payment. It was, therefore, always uncertain, what sum would be payable, at the end of a quarter; this depending on the eagerness or backwardness of the public creditors in bringing forward their subscriptions, or their claims as non-subscribers. The omissions, at the end of a preceding quarter, might be expected to fall upon a subsequent one—and it was necessary to be prepared for that possibility; of course, to keep in hand a larger fund for contingent demands. This necessity extended to the termination of the period for receiving subscriptions; because the treasury was to be prepared, on a supposition, that the whole of the domestic debt would then be in a state to receive interest, either as subscribed or unsubscribed. But this did not, in fact, happen. A part of the sums, which were presented, were crowded into the last days of the quarter, and were too late for a dividend. A considerable sum remained ultimately in a form, which, according to the terms of the provision, did not entitle it to interest, either as subscribed or as unsubscribed debt.  
Hence, the cash in the treasury, on the 1st of October 1791, was, by a considerable sum, greater than was to have been counted upon, or that might have happened.  
The conclusion, which results from the foregoing observations, is this—that the purchases, which preceded the first of October 1791, and which amounted to 699.984 dollars, and 23 cents in specie, could not have been hazarded, but for the aid of the sums, which had actually accrued, from the proceeds of the bills, and the expectation of those which were to accrue from the yet uncollected proceeds of others.  
Had it not been for this aid, the Treasury would have been left more bare, than was consistent with the security of public credit, and the certain execution of the public service.  
There is, however, a later period in the state of the treasury, which will more completely illustrate the idea intended to be established. This is the 2nd of July 1792.  
On that day, the balance of cash in the treasury, comprehending the deposits in all the banks, and including a sum of 200.000 dollars, received on loan of the Bank of the United States, together with a sum of 220.900 dollars, in bills drawn upon domestic funds, the proceeds of which had not been received, was 625.133 dollars and 61 cents.  
Prior to this period, a further sum of 545.902 dollars and 89 cents, arising from the sales of foreign bills, had been placed in the treasury, by warrants, making, with the former sum placed there from the same source, 907.294 dollars, and 23 cents.  
Had it not been for this auxiliary, and that of the loan from the Bank, the treasury would then have been in arrear, 484.160 dollars and 62 cents. It, therefore, necessarily follows, that for the purchases to that period, which amounted in specie, to 942.672 dollars and 54 cents, at least 484.160 dollars and 62 cents, must have come from the foreign fund.  
But when it is considered, for the reasons which have been stated, and which will hereafter be fortified by others, tending, as I conceive, to give them conclusive force, that the sum in the treasury at the period in question, was barely what ought to have been there, for safety, and for a due supply to current demands—it will follow, that the whole, or nearly the whole of the purchases, which were made, previous to July 1792, were made by the means or instrumentality of the foreign fund.  
A similar view, extended to the subsequent quarter, will exhibit this point in a still stronger light. The balance then in the treasury including a further loan from the Bank of 100.000 dollars, was only 420.914 dollars and 51 cents.  
What then, it may be asked, became of the surplus of revenue to the end of 1790? What was the Office performed by that fund, during the period in question?  
The answer is, that it served exactly the purpose, which was anticipated by the legislature. It came in aid of the current receipt, for satisfying the current expenditure of 1791, with particular reference to the interest of the debt. This will be easily comprehended, when it is recollected, that the appropriations, made during 1791, upon the revenues of that year, and some small surplusses of antecedent appropriations, amounted to three million six hundred and thirty seven thousand and fifty eight dollars and thirty four cents; that the revenues themselves amounted to no more than three million five hundred and fifty three thousand one hundred and ninety five dollars and eighteen cents; and that, at the end of 1791, there were outstanding in bonds for the duties on imports, besides the chief proceeds of the duties on spirits distilled within the

 States, then also uncollected, 1.828.269 dollars and 28 cents.  
On this point likewise, of the surplus of revenue to the end of 1790, it is presumable, a misapprehension has been entertained. It seems to have been supposed, that that surplus, as well as the proceeds of the foreign fund, have been kept separate and distinct from the common mass of the monies appearing, from time to time, to be in the treasury. It has been already observed, that this was not the case with regard to the foreign. It is now proper to add, that it has not been the case, either, with regard to the surplus in question. That surplus, as received by the Collectors of the Customs, has regularly passed into the treasury, and appears in the quarterly accounts of the Treasurer, for the periods, to which they relate.  
It is the course of the treasury, resulting from the constitution of the department, for all monies, from whatever source, to be brought into it, to constitute an aggregate; subject to the dispositions prescribed by law. The monies to be employed in the sinking fund have, consequently, only been separated, as they have been called for, for actual investment. The only exception to this relates to that part of the sinking fund, which is created by the interest of the debt purchased. This has been included in the quarterly dividends, and covered by the warrants in favor of the Cashiers of the Banks, for paying those dividends, after which, they have passed into a distinct account, in the books of the Bank, opened with Samuel Meredith, as agent to the Commissioners of the sinking fund.  
To the foregoing representation, it may seem an objection, that the purchases, to the end of 1791, appear to have been carried to the account of the surplus at the end of 1790.  
The ultimate form, which, it has been judged convenient to give to the transaction, in the accounts of the treasury, cannot change what was truly the course of facts. The proceeds of the above mentioned surplus and of the foreign loans, formed together the fund for purchases. In the accounts of the treasury, the thing was susceptible of various modifications at pleasure. The two parts of the fund might have been united in one account, or divided into distinct accounts. Being separated, monies issued for purchases might have been legally carried to either of them.  
It was judged most advisable, in the forms of the treasury, to place the purchases to the end of 1791, to the account of the domestic fund, because it was calculated to give greater latitude and energy to the sinking fund. Had not this course been pursued, the business would have taken the following shape—the foreign fund, to the extent of the purchases, would have been exhausted—the whole, or the greater part of the surplus of 1790, would have continued wrapt up in the expenditure of 1791, not liable to be liberated, till the receipts into the treasury should yield a correspondent surplus beyond the actual disbursements—which could not have been the case, while the war with the Indians continues to call for extraordinary expenditures.  
From the form, into which the thing has been thrown, the foreign fund has been set free to be applied to further purchases; and a necessity produced of anticipiting the outstanding duties, by temporary loans for the current service.  
I trust, there can be no doubt, that the course pursued was regular and within the discretion of the department. I hope also, that it will appear to the House to have been the most eligible. The expediency of giving the earliest, and greatest possible extent and activity to whatever concerns the sinking fund, will, it is presumed, unite all opinions.  
What has been said hitherto respecting the employment of the foreign fund, is applicable only to that part of it, which was drawn for prior to April 1792; the residue standing in a different situation, and requiring a separate examination.  
From the statement, which has been given, it may be perceived, that the fund in question has neither been idle nor useless. A confirmation of this will be found in the following details.  
The whole sum successively received on account of Amsterdam bills, from August 17th 1791, to March 1st 1792, was 408.722 dollars and 69 cents. The amount of the monies invested in purchases between those periods, was 349.984 dollars, and 23 cents, chiefly in the month of September, and by anticipation of those receipts.  
The whole sum successively received on account of Amsterdam bills, subsequent to the 1st of March, and prior to July 1792, was 235.412 dollars and 33 cents. The amount of the monies invested in purchases, between those periods, was 242.688 dollars and 31 cents.  
It was stated in my last letter, that 177.998 dollars and 80 cents, of the proceeds of the foreign bills, were left in deposit with the Bank of North America; and in a note upon Statement B, accompanying that letter, the occasion of it was shewn to be an advance without interest, made by that Bank, for the use of the department of War, which could not yet be covered, in consequence of a doubt still remaining, whether the fund, appropriated for satisfying the object, was adequate to it, the sufficiency of that fund depending, in part, on certain unexpended residues of antecedent appropriations, which, it was expected, would not be finally necessary for satisfying the purposes of those appropriations.  
  
It is to be remarked, that the delay of the employment of this part of the pr

oceeds of the foreign fund has been compensated by a saving of interest on the sum advanced on the Bank, which otherwise must have been procured upon a loan with an allowance of interest, probably at the time of the advance, at a rate of 6 per cent; so that even in this particular, the fund, though temporarily suspended from its destination, has not been idle or unproductive. I reserve, for another place, some additional observations and statements, which will be calculated to shew, that opportunities of investing the monies, at any time on hand, applicable to purchases of the debt, were not suffered to pass unimproved, and that as much, in this respect was done, as the state of the treasury and the state of the market would permit.  
It has been said, that a distinct examination would be proper, with regard to the bills, which have been drawn upon the foreign fund, subsequent to March 1792. I proceed now to this examination.  
The expediency of what has been, in this respect, done, seems to have been called in question, under a suggestion, that an application of the fund to the purchases had ceased to be advantageous.  
The drawing of these bills has been, at different periods, influenced by various considerations. A leading motive was always a purchase of the debt. And a correct view of the subject will, I doubt not, satisfy the House, that the measure was recommended by an adequate prospect of advantage.  
It is to be observed, that all these drafts were predicated upon the two four per cent loans; being, as already stated, real 4½ per cent loans.  
There was good ground to presume, that opportunities would be found of investing the monies drawn for in purchases, which would yield, at least, 5 per cent, with a possibility of doing still better. The difference of ½ per cent was alone an object of importance; but it would be coupled with the further benefit of reducing a principal sum materially exceeding the sum invested. When the three per cents are purchased at 12/ in the pound, there is not only a redemption of an annuity of 5 per cent, but a sinking of a capital of 20/ for 12. And though this might not be material, if the market rate of interest should never fall below 5, because, in that case, the 3 per cents might always be purchased at the same rate, yet if it should, at any time happen, that interest fell below 5, it would be a gain to the government to have purchased at 5, in exact proportion to the difference between 5, and the then market rate. Add to this, that the 3 per cents have generally a value in the market, more than proportioned to the income they produce, which arises from the capacity of the capital to appreciate, even to par. These observations are also, for the most part, applicable to the deferred, with this circumstance in addition, that when interest begins to be payable on that species of Stock, the money invested, and which, in the mean time, would have produced five, would then begin to produce to the government 6 per cent, with the advantage of having anticipated the redemption of a species of stock, of right only gradually redeemable. Combining these considerations, it appears to be clearly and even eminently for the interest of the government, to purchase within the limit suggested, with a fund which does not cost more than 4½ per cent.  
That this was the view of the subject, which governed, is deducible, not only from the circumstances of the fact, but from my letter of the 2d of April 1792, to Mr. Short, announcing my intention to draw, in which I assign, as the ground of that intention, “that I considered it for the interest of the United States, to prosecute purchases of the public debt, with monies borrowed on the terms of the last loan,” meaning the loan of the first of January 1792 at 4 per cent.  
If the event be taken as a criterion, the anticipation will be more than justified, the present juncture offering an opportunity for purchases peculiarly advantageous.  
But without insisting on a state of things, occasioned by extraordinary circumstances, it was morally certain, that the common course of events would render the operation a beneficial one. And it would not argue peculiar foresight, if a calculation was even made on the effect, which the situation and probable progress of affairs in Europe might produce upon our market. A pretty general war there, by extending the demand for money, would naturally divert from our stocks, a portion of what might otherwise be employed upon them, and affect injuriously their prices. It is also a familiar fact, that during the winter in this country, there is always a scarcity of money in the towns; a circumstance calculated to damp the prices of stock.  
A consideration, which collaterally influenced the drawing of the latter bills, was the situation of the French colony of St: Domingo.  
This not only produced an early application for a considerable advance, which was promised; but it was to be foreseen that still further aids would be indispensible.  
Indeed sundry letters from Mr. Short, the first dated at Paris, the 28th December 1791, announced the daily probability of an arrangement, requiring an advance here of 800.000 dollars, for the use of that colony. A sum of 4.000.000 of livres has, in fact, been successively stipulated for that object, the greatest part of which has been actually furnished.  
It is known, that these supplies could proceed from no other source, than the foreign fund.  
The payment to the foreign officers of near 200.000 dollars, by which an interest of 6 per cent would be released, was another object, for which, provision was to be made out of the same fund.  
These several purposes conspired with the object of purchasing the debt, to induce the latitude of drawing, which took place.  
But there was still a further inducement, which came in aid of the others. The time for reimbursing the first instalment of the two millions of dollars due to the Bank was approaching when, by positive stipulation, the government would have to pay two hundred thousand dollars, for which there was no domestic fund, that could be spared from the current exigencies. I thought it incumbent upon this department, to have an eye to placing within the reach of the legislature, the means of fulfilling this engagement; the object of which bore a strict analogy to that, for which, the two millions, authorized by the Act making provision for the reduction of the public debt, were to be borrowed.  
I did not even scruple to take into the calculation, that if from the extent of the draughts upon the foreign fund, there should happen to be found on hand a larger sum, than was necessary for, or could be advantageously employed towards the several purposes, which were the immediate and direct objects of the operation, the surplus would facilitate to the government a measure manifestly and unequivocally beneficial—an additional payment to the Bank, on account of a debt, upon which an annual interest of 6 per cent was payable; a measure by which a certain saving of one per cent, to the extent of the payment, that might be made, would be accomplished.  
The possibility of this application of the fund afforded a perfect assurance, that the public interest could, in no event, fail to be promoted.  
I felt myself the more at liberty to do it, because it did not interfere with a complete fulfilment of the public engagements in regard to the foreign debt. It could not be done, consistently with a full reimbursement of all arrears and instalments, which had accrued on account of that debt.  
The detail, which has been given, comprehends a full exposition of the views and motives, that have regulated the conduct of this department; in relation to those parts of the proceeds of the foreign loans, which have been transferred to the United States, except as to the last sum of one million two hundred and thirty seven thousand five hundred florins, directed to be drawn for on the 30th of November last; in regard to which, circumstances of a special nature cooperated, as is explained in a note upon the copy of my letter of the 26th of that month, to Mr Short, forming a part of the communication herewith made by order of the President of the United States.  
  
The House will perceive, that the variety of matter comprised in this letter has not been collected and digested into its present form, without much labor, and an unavoidable expense of time. I trust, they will be sensible, that no delay has been unnecessarily incurred. It is certain, that I have made every exertion in my power, at the hazard of my health to comply with the requisitions of the House, as early as possible. And it has even been done with more expedition, than was desirable to secure the perfect accuracy of the communication.  
Yet I have still to regret, that some part of the subject must remain to be presented in a subsequent letter. To lessen, however, the inconvenience of this further delay, I shall transmit, with the present letter, the statements required by the first and second of the resolutions of the 23d. of January, which will be found in the Schedules herewith marked No. I to V; those required by the last of the resolutions, having been already forwarded.  
There remain, however, some particulars, to complete the information contemplated by those resolutions, that must be reserved for another communication. This, I may venture to assure the House, will not be deferred beyond the present, or at least the first day of the ensuing week.  
With perfect respect, I have the honor to be,   Sir,   Your most obedient and most humble servant

TREASURY DEPARTMENT.  
SIR,  
T7IF. next most important article of in­  
quiry involved in the resolutions of the  
Home of Rcprefentatives of ths twenty­  
third of January lalt; a.nd in the observa­  
tions which have been made refpefting the  
cond i t of this department, relates to the  
ioa as negotiated under the acts«»££|ie fourth  
■and twelfth of one   
hundred and ninety. •  
The papers which have been tranfinitted  
to the Konfefcy order of the President, dif­  
■clofe the following particulars—  
r. That the immediatefiiperintendance  
of the bnfinefs of the loans was confided to  
the department of the treasury, being na­  
turally connected with it. This trull, be­  
lidcs the original inftruttions for regula­  
ting the execution of it, which have been  
communicated, was of course fubjeft to  
such directions from time to time, as the  
President should think lit to give, or as oc­  
cafiom (hould require— \ considerable la­  
titude of discretion, nevertheless, from the  
very nature of the cafe, attended it; so as  
justly to leave 0:1 the head of this depart­  
ment, a complete refponlibility in all in-  
Itances, where special exceptions do not  
appear.  
3. That the fir&#x27;ft loan which was obtain­  
ed. was undertaken and completed by the  
agency of Wilhetn and Jan Willink, and  
Nicolaas and Jacob Van Staphorft and  
Hubbard, who both under the former and  
present government, have been and are the  
banker s of the United St ites at Amsterdam.  
That &#x27;vith ill? finale exception of the  
firii loan, Wdliain Short, Esq. then charge  
des affaires at the court of France, now re­  
sident mini iter at the Hague, was coniti­  
tuted the sole agent of this department,  
for carrying into effect the powers confided  
to it : with this qualification only, that it  
any negotiation with a prince or rtate, tc  
whom any part of the debt to be discharged  
by the loans was due, Ihould be requisite—  
the fame was to be carried 011 through the  
person, who in capacity of miniller, charge  
des affaires.or otherwise,then was or there­  
after might be charged with transacting the  
affairs of the United States, with fuel  
prince or state.  
4. That all payments, which have beer  
nade out of the proceeds of the loans, have  
heen made by the immediate and fpeci 1  
order of Mr. Short, except those, upon th;  
bills of the Treasurer corthe monies drawl  
to this country, and thofc to the inone;  
lenders in Holland ; which were made ir  
course by our bankers, at the periods the]  
refpeftively became due. This consequent  
ly embraces all the payments to France  
the very 1 ast of which, though agreed foi  
by Mr. Morris, in confeqnence of his ha  
vin; been employed for a special purpof&lt;  
by Mr. Short, was not. and could not b;  
complete I, but by the lame immediate ant  
special direction of Mr. Short.  
It moreover appears, from the fame pa  
pers, and more fullyfrom the correfpon­  
dense at large, now before the Senate, th r  
except in the particular&#x27;inftance which ha:  
been jut Hated, with regard to Mr. Mor­  
ris, there has been no other agency in the  
whole bnfinefs, than that of Mr. Short, anc  
of the bankers at Amsterdam and Antwerp  
whom he neceffirily employed as inftru­  
melts in the negotiation with the mone;  
len.lers.an 1 in the receipt and difburfemem  
of the monies borrowed.—These, as alrea­  
dy mentioned, were at Amlterdam, the  
two honfes of Wilhem and Jan Willink  
and of Nicolaas and Jacob Van Staphorfl  
a id Hubbard : at Antwerp a Mr. G. De  
Volf, was the banker.  
It may not be without it 3 uses to add,  
that the monies proceeding from the loans,  
have constantly remained in the hands ol  
the respective bankers, till they have been  
paid over to the creditors ; namely, the  
French treasury, or their bankers, the mo­  
ney lenders or their representatives, ths  
holders of the bills drawn from this conn­  
try by the treasurer. Neither Mr. Short  
nor Mr. Morris, ha 3 ever had possession of a  
single guilder. The latter indeed has never  
even had power over one, excepting mere-  
Iv a sum of roj,ooo guilders, by letters of  
mine dated the 13th September lalt, placed  
at his disposal for paying at Paris, according  
to stipulation, the incereft 0:1 the debt due

tn foreign oncers. The fact is, ami it *.s so  
demonitrated by the correspondence al­  
ready referred to, that I never wrote a line  
to Mr. Morris 0:1 the fubjett of the lo.ns  
or their proceeds, but in reference to the  
cafe, juit mentioned of the interest payable  
to foreign officers, in refpeclto which local  
foliation governed.  
One more circiimftancc only is necessary  
to be noticed in this place, vCith a view to  
Che elucidation intended : It is this---that  
the last payment, though originating prior  
to the change in the political polition of  
France of the 10th of Augnlt lalt, not ha­  
ving been consummated till the 6th of Sep­  
tember following, fell of conrfe under the  
tlifpofition of those then in poffellion of the  
jower of the nation.  
It could not but have been unexpected  
:•&gt; me, that exception should be taken to  
the report lately made by me on the subject  
&gt;f foreign loans, for the omiiEon of details  
which I did not at the time, and do not yet  
:onceive to have been called for, by the  
:ermsofthe resolutions upon which it  
ivaJ founded. The request addrefled to  
:he President, by those resolutions, was,  
that he would cauie to be laid before the  
louse a particular account of the sums bor­  
•owed under his authority by the United  
States, the terms on which each loan was  
obtained, the applications, which had been  
Tilde of the monies, agreeably to appro­  
priations, th«&quot; balances, if any, which re­  
named unapplied, fpecifying also at what  
imes interaii commenced on the several  
&quot;urns obtained, and at what times it was  
topped by the several payments made. It  
ivas not natural to imagine that these ex­  
pressions were designed to comprehend a  
pecification of the precise authorities, un­  
ler which the loans were negociated, of  
the names of the persons by whom they  
ivere negociated, of the particular place or  
places where the balance unexpended of  
he fuias that had been drawn fen- to the  
United States, were depolited. Still lef»  
latural was it for me to anticipate furmi­  
es, which could give to such particulars  
lie (hadow of importance. But as ani­  
nadverlions have attended the emiflion of  
those details, I ought to regard it as an ad­  
nonition to me, to be more full and pre­  
:ife in my present communication; a mo­  
tive which co-operates with my desire, to  
throw all pollible light upon the fubjeft.  
The firft general circumstance, which  
-equires to be noticed and explained, after  
the particulars that have been communica­  
ted is this—That all the loans which have  
been hitherto obtained, have been made  
nnder the authority of both acts, without  
particular reference to either.  
The idea originally entertained, was. to  
conduct them oil a different plan, founding  
each loan upon one or the other of the acts;  
is will be (Veil by my letter of the 98th of  
August, 1790, to our bankers at Amfler-  
Jam ; at the fame time, that it will ap­  
pear, from the fame letter, that the sepa­  
ration did not appear to ine a matter of  
ttonfequence, and that I anticipated the  
possibility of a dilficulty in adhering to it in  
the particular cafe. That difficulty pro­  
ved, in the opinion of the bankeri, to be of  
Tufficient moment to render the arrange­  
ment contemplated, under the circumltan­  
ces of the cafe, unadvifeable ; as they in­  
form me in their answer to the above­  
mentioned letter.  
But prior to the receipt of that answer,  
further enquiry and reflection had deter­  
mined me to abandon my original idea—  
is likely to produce embarrafl&#x27;ment and  
inconvenience, both in negociation of the  
loans, and in the application of their pro­  
ceeds. It was accordingly concluded to  
let the loans proceed indiscriminately, up­  
t&gt;n both arts.  
These loaus were to have reference to  
two purpofes—firft, the reimbursement of  
the foreign debt ; second, the purchase of  
the domestic debt at its market price.  
There were weighty reafonsfor carrying  
on both these operations concurrently.—  
The arrears to France had been a conside­  
rable time accumulating. It was in every  
sense proper that a reimbursement of them  
fliould begin witfiaat delay,and dcfirablc for  
obvious reasons, that it should go on with­  
out any very considerable chasms or inter­  
miflions. This manner of proceeding could  
not but have the fairelt chance of being  
the molt fatisfactory and convenient to  
France ; unless indeed the business were  
to have proceeded upon the principle of  
an entire postponement of the domestic ob­  
ject, to that of the reimbursement.  
But very cogent reason* rendered this  
course not the most eligible. The early  
  
commencement of purchases of the debt,  
was a matter of real and great importance.  
It was important in two relations ; as it  
regarded the advantages to the govern­  
ment, from redeeming a portion ot t.&#x27;ie  
debt at low prices ; and still more, as it  
regarded the savings to the country from  
railing the price of Hock on foreign pur­  
chasers; the beneficial influence upon the  
credit of the nation abroad and at home,  
to be expected from a quick appreciation  
of the public obligations; the benefit to  
the public creditors in general, and to the  
molt meritorious classes of them in parti­  
cular, winch would rfftilt from the fame  
cause ; all which objects were fuggefled  
from the treasury, as motives to the provi­  
ion respecting purchases, and are evident­  
ly c ntemplated in the preamble of the  
i£t, * li!«U makes that provitioii.  
Exclusive of the otlier advantages,  
whi !i ,jlve been cited, and which are of a  
ri:\ urs. truly precious and important, that  
i)f preventing foreigners from acquiring  
the property of our citizens at a great un­  
ler-value is too obvious not to be eftima­  
:ed, as it ought to be, at fir ft light. It  
:annot require argument to shew how  
rreat an evil it was, that foreigners should  
je able to acquire with nine or ten, that  
or which the country would ultimately  
lave to pay them twenty, with full inte­  
:eft in the interval ; nor how much it  
nerited the attention of the government  
:o prevent or lefl&#x27;en so serious ail evil.  
Btjt the influence which the purchases  
iy the government may have had upon  
this event may not be equally obvious- It  
s however not difficult to be traced.—  
Price niturally keeps pace with competi­  
tion and demand ; whatever increases the  
latter, Oeceffarily tends to an augmenta­  
tion of the former. Merely then as ano­  
ther purcli3fer, by adding to the competi­  
tion and demand, the purchases of go­  
vernm it, were calculated to influence a  
rue o? price. L.it they Iml xv effect  
more than proportioned to their real ex­  
tent. Imagination has much to do in all  
fucli quellions, and in scarcely any thing  
so much as in what relates to public  
funds. Kxperience proves, that it is here  
exerted with uncommon effort. The ap­  
pearance of the government as a purcha­  
lerhas not failed to excite the expectation  
of a greater demand than was real, be­  
cause the extent of the resources to be  
employed, might be very great, and was  
unknown : which by Simulating the zeal  
of those who wanted to buy, left the price  
should rife suddenly and coniiderably upon  
them, and by encouraging those who wan­  
ted to fell, under the hope of a better  
price, to ho!»l back the commodity, has in  
both ways generally contributed to give a  
spring to the market. Prices once raised,  
when founded on intrinsic value, tend to  
maintain themselves ; becaufc those who  
have given them, are for the most part  
interelled in keeping them up. And eve­  
ry nc-.v impulse, which they receive, serves  
to cairy them rapidly to their just level.  
Those who have been «olt attentive  
to th.; operation of the public purchases,  
will have the least doubt that they had a  
material agency, in accelerating the ap­  
preciation of the public stock

Numb. 35 of Vol. ll.] WEDNE SDA Y, February 27, 1793.  
  
Report of the Secretary of the Treasury,  
relative to the Loans negotiated ui:der  
the acts of the 4th and 12th of August,  
179&lt;3-  
[Continued from our laji.}  
AN enquiry naturally arises here—Were  
the monies which were drawn from  
Europe on account of the foreign loans,  
the instrument of the purchases, to which  
these beneficial effefls are ascribed ?  
I answer, that these purchases arc to be  
attributed to the ihftrumentality of that  
fund—that had it not been for this re­  
foiu-ce they could not have been made at  
tiie early periods, when most of them  
were made. The cnurfe of the tranfacTi-i  
on wili be fully and with more propriety  
explained in another place.  
An attention to both objects—to the re­  
imbursements to France, and to the pur­  
chases f the debt, rendered expedient a  
fiibdiviiion even of the firft loan. Conli­  
derations of the moment seconded those of  
a general nature, to induce an immediate  
payment to that country—The loan had  
been undertaken without previous autho­  
rity from hence, with a view to such pay­  
ment. This was known and a correfpon­  
deut expectation excited. The immedi­  
ate situation of the French finanses, ren­  
dered a payment at the particular juncture  
more than ordinarily interesting. 111 such  
a (late of things, there could be no hesita­  
tion, about applying a large part of the  
loan to that object. Anotherpart of it wai  
of necessity applied to the payment of the  
sums, that were falling due on the Dutch  
loans. And it Is presumed, that the rea­  
sons which have been afligned, will ap­  
pear to have been fufficiently powerful to  
have dictated the drawing of a part of it  
to the United States.  
Accordingly, a million and a halt of the  
three millions borrowed, were appropri­  
ated to France ; something mare than  
Soovcoo guilders were drawn syr here,  
Aad&#x27;t&#x27;ii- remainder of tSeifca3&quot;wk to  
be dilbarfed in Holland. j  
&#x27; It shall not be concealed, though 1 am  
aware that the acknowledgment may be a  
fubieft of criticism, that the condua which  
was nurfued, both with regard to this and  
to the fncceedi&#x27;ng loan, was in fomed egree  
influenced by a collateral confutation.  
The government had but jlift adopted a  
plan tor the reftorationof public credit. The  
periodical payment ofintereft was to com­  
mence on the Ift of April 1791. A con­  
siderable part of the revenue out of which  
the monies were to arise, was only to be­  
ein to accrue on the firft of January pre­  
ceding This revenue was liable to cre­  
dits of four, fix, and twelve months.  
How far its eventual product would an­  
swer expectation—how far the punctuali­  
ty of payments could be relied upon, were  
point* unascertained, and which required  
to their ascertainment much more expe­  
rience than had been obtained. In such  
situation it was not only natural, but ne­  
cefiary for an administrator of the finances  
to doubt—and doubting it was his duty to  
call to the aid of the public credit, every  
auxiliary, which it was in his power to  
command—He was bound to reflect, that  
a failure in any stipulated payment would  
be fatal to the dawning credit of the coun­  
try—to the reputation of the government,  
iuft beginning to rife. That a wound in­  
flitted upon either, at so early a stage, un­  
der all the circumstances ot opposition to  
the constitution, which had exilled in the  
community, would have been deep.y felt,  
and might either not have admitted of a  
cure at ailornot till after * length of time,  
and a series of mifchiefs—that it could  
rjot but be an important service rendered  
o the country, to ward off so great a mif­  
fortune, by the temporary life of any ex­  
traordinary resource, which might be at  
hand, till time was given for more effectu­  
al provHion.  
If iri the course of such reflections, a  
, doubt had occurred, about the stria regu­  
larity of what was contemplated, asipof­  
fible resort, a mind fufficiently alive to the  
public interest and fufficiently firm in the  
purfuitofit, would have dismissed thai  
doubt, as an obstacle, suggested by a pu­  
sillanimous caution, to the exeicife 01  
those higher motives, which ought evei  
to govern a man, inverted with a great  
public trust. It would have occurred thai  
there was reasonable ground to rely, thai  
the necessity of the cafe, and the magni­  
tude of the occasion, would irifure a juf­  
tification, and that if the contrary Ihould  
happen, there remained still the consola­  
tion of having facrificed personal interest  
and tranquility, no matter to what extent,

to an important public interest, and of ha­  
ving avoided the humiliation, which would  
have been jultly due to an opposite, and to  
a feeble conduit.  
The disposition which was resolved upo11  
with regard to the tirft loan, involved ne­  
cefl&#x27;arily a decilion of the point, that the  
loans might be placed on the joint foun­  
dation of both a£ts. That loan having  
been undertaken, as already mentioned,  
without previous authority, and conse­  
quently without a particular eye to either  
act, it was probable, that it would be  
found too late to make an apportionment  
of one part of the sum borrowed to one  
ait, of another part to the other act. In  
that cafe, the distributive application of  
the fund to the d&#x27;.ffereiit objects was to be  
relinquished or the pofiibility was to be ad­  
mitted, of the loan being left to stand up­  
on the authority of both acts. The fame  
disposition of the firlt loan, will also illus­  
trate the convenience and expediency ot  
the plan which was finally adopted, that is,  
of placing the loans on the bafls of both  
acts.  
The idea of a concurrent execution  
of both the objects to which the loans  
were deHined, could not conveniently  
have been pursued, upon the plan of a se­  
paration of the loans ; which to be effec­  
tual, would include the&#x27; drift application  
of the proceeds of each to tile purposes o:  
the particular ast, upon which it was  
founded.  
Amsterdam was naturally looked to, a?  
the great scene of the intended loans.t-  
There, as everywhere else, there is but a  
certain quantity of money floating in the  
market from time to time, beyond tht  
neceflary demands of trade and industry,  
Peeking for employment in loaps. Thi­  
quantity, of course, varies at different peri­  
ods, from a variety of causes. Of the  
quantity at any time afloat, but a certwi:  
borrowing power ; owing to the compe­  
tition of other borrowers, who have each  
their connexions through their bankers,  
with different fetsof undertakers &quot;and mo­  
ney lenders. Nor is it always that conii­  
derable loans can be had at any rate.—  
There are certain feufons only, when  
they are practicable.  
To have brought two loans upon the  
market at one time, as an opportunity of  
borrowing offered, which must have been  
the cafe in order to make concurrent  
provision for both the objects in question,  
if the principle of a separation of the loan;  
had been adopted, would have been to  
exhibit to the money lenders a very unu­  
sual appearance. With men known to be  
much influenced by precedent and habit,  
such an apppearance could not have failed  
to prove a i&#x27;ource of speculation aud con­  
jecture ; and might have led to a confu­  
fed idea that the wants of the United  
States were excefiive ; a supposition, by  
no m?ans calculated to promote their cre­  
dit. It would moreover have been a de­  
parture from that simplicity of procedure,  
which,where numbers are concerned,is al­  
ways of moment to a right conception of  
the bulinefa to beaccomplifhed., and ought  
not to be abandoned, but for reasons of  
real utility and weight.  
To have instituted the loans fucceffive­  
ly,founding each,upon one or other of the  
acts, would have had a tendency to occ.l­  
- longer intervals between thepaymenti  
to France, than was desirable. &#x27;The in­  
tervention of a loan for the purpose of  
purchases, would have created of course a  
very coniiderable chasm. It may be ob­  
jected that such chasms did happen on the  
plan which&#x27;was pursued. This is true in  
two instances ; but the molt material of  
the two proceeded from cafualties&#x27;foreign  
to the plan vtfelf ; which are detailed in  
the correspondence more than once allu­  
ded to.  
It ispolfibletoo that a separation of the  
loans might have rendered it less easy to  
take advantage of a state of the market,  
favourable to their extension at a particu­  
lar juncture. The loan to be brought or  
the market might relate to the purdiafe ol  
the debt . The moment might be favour­  
able to a more coniiderable loan, than wa:  
within the limits prescribed for that object,  
and the opportunity might flip before&#x27; t  
feeond could be inftitu ed. Iu this busi­  
ness moments are often of importance,  
and are to be embraced with promptitude  
and dexterity.  
Thus it appeal s, that in different way:  
the negociation of the loans might have  
been embarralTed by their separation.  
  
But the mod obvious, if not the molt ferU  
ous of the inconveniencies which would  
have attended it, refpe£ts th? application of  
the sums borrowed- This could not then  
have been moulded, as the interelt or po­  
licy of the government might dictate, A  
loan for the purchase ps the debt might  
iMve been made under profpeits, proini­  
ulig a ready and berieficial inveltmenc of  
it r but befof-e the ihvefhnent was made,  
:■ change of the market might render&#x27;it  
ineligible—involving the alternative, ei-  
Cher of a difadvantajjeous investment, or  
of leaving perhaps a large film of money  
a long time unemployed. Such a ltate of  
things might have produced to the banks  
an advantage, and to the government a  
a loss, of magnitude fufficient to give co­  
lour to a fiirmife, that the public in­  
terelt had been facrificed to the profit of  
thole inltitutions. The contrary course  
has eflentialfy avoided that evil; which in  
this and in Other instances, would have  
been incident in a far greater degree, to  
the modes of proceedings, contralted with  
ihofe that have been puvfued ,&#x27;t!ian has in  
reality attended them.  
Or political conliderations might have  
rendered it advifeable to transfer the ap­  
plication of the fund from one obje£t to  
*he other.  
&#x27; Of this, the cafe of St. Domingo presents  
[11 example. It might have happened on  
i&gt;e plan of fepsfrate loans, that there was  
,;o tond in hand but for the purchase ut

)ian, there would have been uo fund, in  
;!ie disposition of the executive, applicable  
&#x27;.o the other object, which would have em­  
jarrafled the performance of a duty to­  
wards a friendly power, ana ift a way  
which included the positive advantage to  
kiie country of paying direitly a part of its  
foreign debt, in its own productions.

In the opposite plan, I can discern no  
counterbalancing advantage nor conveni­

Consequently, if both are equally legal,  
there can be no doubt which of them  
ought to have been preferred.

TF there be any want of legality in the  
pla i which has been pursued, I was  
not at the time, and ain not yet sensible  
of it.  
I know of 110 rule which renders it ille­  
gal in an agent, having from the fame  
principal two authorities to borrow mo­  
nty,whether for one or different purposes,  
to unite the loans he may make, upon the  
foundation of both authorities : Provided  
the terms of them be consonant with both  
or either of his commiflions. If the pur­  
poses are different, it will be incumbent  
upon him, to take care that the application  
of the monies borrowed makes the pro­  
per separation ; and doing this he will  
have fulfilled his trust. Toteft this por­  
tion it Teems only neceflary to alk, whe  
ther the principal in such cafe would not  
be fully bound to the lenders ?  
In reflecting originally upon the regula­  
rity of the proceeding meditated, there  
was but one source of hesitation ; th? dif  
ferencein the funds upon which the loans  
were to rcil Butthe following reason­  
ing fatisfird the scruple : The pledging ol  
particular funds is for the security of the  
lenders. It they are willing to wave the  
special security, by lending on the genera  
credit of the government, or to dispense  
with the preference of one fund to another  
where two are pledged, by lending indif­  
criminatelv on the credit of both, the one  
or the other circumstance mtiftbe alike  
indifferent to the government. The au­  
thority will have been well executed, tc  
the extent necefTary for public purposes.  
and if any thing remains unexecuted, it  
will be in enlargement, not in abridgment  
of .he public rights.lt is however prelumec  
t tat th? prn&amp;icsi cwnftrucHtjn, in the pre­  
fjnt cafe will be, that the two funds pledg­  
ed will constitute an aggregate, for tin  
joint security of the monies borrowed up­  
on both aits.  
The second general circumstance ref­  
pefling the foreign loans, negotiated un­  
der the a£ts of the 4th,and 12 th of Anguft,  
which requires attention, relates to the  
terms 0.1 which they have been obtained.  
These.it appears have been represented.as  
neither honorable nor advantageous.  
The following facts, witnefled by the  
correlpondcnce bei&#x27;ore the Senate, more  
than once referred to, and well known to  
all who have had opportunities of infor­  
mation, demonstrate, that the terms of  
those loans, have been both honorable and  
advantageous.  
1. There is not one of them, which ori­  
ginated under the arts, that was not effec­  
ted upon condi ions equally favourable  
•with those attending the loans of the co­  
temporary borrowing powers of the molt  
tried resources and bell established credit,  
and more favorable than w ere obtainable  
by some powers of great refpeOability  
2. The United States took a lead in the  
market, in regard to the subsequent re­  
du£&gt;ions of interest ; having had either  
earlier or more complete success than ar.y  
other borrowing power.  
3. From a rate of five per cent, interest,  
and four and a half per cent, charges,  
which marked ths level of the market  
when they begun their loans, they In the  
course of a single year, brought down the  
terms to four per cent, interest, and five  
per ccnt, charges ; th.;t is from an interest  
on the nett sum received (including an in­  
demnification for charges) of 5.5012,  
something more than five and a half per  
cent, to an interest on the like sum of  
4.4951, something lefsthan4 [-2 per cent.  
When this state of things is applied to a  
government, only in the third year of its  
cxifter.ce, and to a country which had so  
recently emerged from a total derange­  
ment ofits finances, it would i&#x27;eem innpof­  
fible to deny that the ifi&#x27;ue is not only 110-  
3iorable, but flattering , unless indeed it  
can be denied, that a found and vigorous  
state of credit is honorable to a nation.  
I forbear a comparison between the  
loans of the present, and ot the former  
government of this country, because an  
immense disparity of circumstances would  
render it an improper one—further than  
to take Eotice of a very great error which  
has been upon some occasions advanced.  
It has been alledged, to disparage the  
management, under the present, that the  
loans of the former government, in a situ­  
ation comparath e&#x27;v very disadvantageous,  
  
By P. FRENEAU: Publifhcd Wednesdays and Saturdays, at Three Dollars per annum.  
  
have be - i effected upon equal terms ; and  
in proof of this an appeal has been made  
to the io.ni of 2,000,0d0 of guilders at  
four per cent, which is that of the gth of  
March, 1784.  
Nothing can manifeft more clearly th in  
this, the very precipitate and fuperficial  
views, with which fu on impor­  
tant public fubjeits, are sometimes made.  
Thelaft four per cent, loan, obtained  
under the existing laws, including char­  
ges, is a real four and ahalf par cent loan  
ur more exaftly&#x27;a 4.4951 per cent. loan. The  
four per cent. loan of March i&quot;B4, is a  
i real 6.C4fiS per cent. loan. The diifer­  
?nce which exceeds 2 per cent, arises  
irincipally from extra premiums and gra­  
&#x27;fications which were allowed upon this  
oan, and which are unknown to the o­  
:her.  
Much praifeis no doubt due to the ex­  
rtions which effected the loans under  
:he former government. A fnperiority of  
lierit, (hall readily be conceded to them,  
Vom the circumstances under which they  
.vere made, and their lignal utility in the  
evolution. But it is not nerefTary to  
heir eulogium to affirm, that they were  
nade upon equal terms with those lately  
ibtained. or to deny the gopdnefs of the  
erms of the latter. Truth will not jufti­  
&#x27;y the one or the other.  
The facts which nave been stated prove,  
hat the terms of the loans are advanta­  
geous as well as honorable. They are  
romparatively advantageous, becanfe the\
ire as moderate as other powers in the  
&gt;eft credit have allowed ; and tliey are  
ibfolutely achantageous, because the high­  
lit real not tiotnirial rate of interest,  
vhich has been given does not exceed  
a fraction more than 51-2 per  
:etit. while the lo weft real rale is 4-495&#x27;  
1 fraction leO than 4 1-2 per cent. &gt;  
If the question whether advantageous  
&gt;.* ni&gt;t be te(t«d *&gt;y the pr«rpofV*s for which  
Jj loans have been made, the conclusion  
equally in their favour—The payments  
&gt;n ac of the foreign debt, were .111  
ildifpenfabie obligation. Unless it can be  
hewn that they might have been derived  
Vom another and more advantageous  
oiirce, it will follow that it was the in­  
ereft of the government to avail itfelf of  
he resource which has been employed,  
iccaufe it was its duty todifcharge its ob­  
igai&#x27;ons.  
It is sometimes urged, that foreign  
oans for whatever purpose are pernicious,  
lecaufe they serve to drain the country  
if its specie for the payment of interest,  
ind for the final re mburfement of princi­  
lal—?hat it would be preferable for that  
eafon to procure loans at home, even at  
i higher rate of interest.  
To this, feveial answers may be given,  
&quot;ome of afpecial, others of a general na­  
:ure.  
In reference to the reimbursement of  
:he foreign debt, it may be observed, that  
is a debt had already been incuried abroad  
ipon which .ntereft was payable, the con  
trailing of new loan? there for the reim  
burfement of that debt, would leave u&gt;,  
is to the denial,d for the exportation of  
jur specie, just where we originally stood.  
Moreover if the money could have been  
jorrowed at home, for that re&#x27;nnburfe  
nent, the remittance of it would hav.  
leen ruinous to the country. The mere  
leceffity of remitting could not alone  
lave mere-fed the foreign demand fur  
jur commodities ; so as to deduce from  
in extra exportation of them, the reqni­  
ite means of pavment ; and if our specie  
ivas to perform the office, the countiy  
would speedily have been exhaijfted to a  
fegi ee irconfiftent with the fapport of it  
:o_mmerceand iiuluftry. The quantity of  
:oin in the United States has never been  
ronfiderable enough for such ail opera­  
ndi.  
But this very ftaie of things would  
have rendered the procuring of the 1110-  
ley from domestic resources impracticable.  
Thtfe it may be fafely affirmed are too  
limited for extensive loans, of any confi­  
ilerable degree of permanency.  
In the last place—The expedient of do­  
mestic loans, would not oreveni the evil,  
which is delired to be prevented. Fo­  
reigners would either in the firft instance,  
bring their monies to (übferibe them to  
the loan-, or, they would afterwards pur­  
chase the Hock arising from them ; and in  
either cafe they would equally draw away  
the money of the countryon account oftl.eir  
interest and principal. The only confe-  
of giving a difpropoi donate rate of  
  
S A T U R D A Y, March 2, 1795.  
  
interest for domestic loins would be. that  
our specie would be carried, away so much  
the fafter.  
Experience having (hewn, that nations  
fometiines pay more regard to their ex­  
ternal than to their internal credit, this  
confi4eration co-operates with reasons of  
convenience to induce monied men abroad,  
to be coment with a lower rate of inte­  
rest, stipulated to be paid in their own  
country, than if the place of payment be  
in another country ; making even a great­  
er difference, than is an equivalent for the  
expence and risk of obtaining remittan­  
ces.  
Th : clear inference from these obferva­  
lions, is that with regard to the reimburfe­  
tnent of the foreign debt, no other expe­  
dient than that of foreign loans was prac­  
ticable or eligible.  
Th? utility of that part of the loans,  
which has reference to the purchase oi  
the debt, has already been explained ir  
:ertain Views. So far as their agency ha:  
jeen hitherto concerned in that operation,  
it is a fnlficient demoaftratio&#x27;.i of the advan­  
tage of the measure toftate, that the sum  
inverted in purchases up to the period  
as the !afl report to Congress has redeem­  
ed what is equal to an annuity of 6.15  
per cent, including also the advantage of  
inking a capital more than 50 per cent.  
;reatcT than the sum expended.  
A valuable profit will arise from the in­  
feftment of the funis on hand, either in a  
jayniei.t to the bank or in the purchase  
jfftoefc. The liberation of an annuity of  
ix percpnt. can be secured—while upon a  
;reat part of tliefund which is to effetl it  
10 more than 4 1-2 per cent, is payable,  
ind lefi than 51-2 upon the other part.  
The mean of these rates beiqg 5 per cent,  
in annual favipg of one per cent- may be  
?ftetled, which upon 2,000,000 of dollars,  
ntereft at 5 per cent, is equal to a capi­  
tal or gross sum of 400,000 dollars : an  
tem certainly of no inconsiderable confe­  
rence.  
Against the advantages, which are  
tlaimed in favour of the loans, it is natu­  
ral to place the loss of interest incident to  
:he delays, which have attended their ap­  
plication to the purposes, for which they  
were obtained. This leads to an exami­  
lation of the cases of delay,their causes.the  
:ircumftances if any, which counterba­  
lance them.  
There are three instances of material de­  
—one refpeoVuig the firrt loan, another  
the fecund loan, and a third, a part of the  
two last loans.  
The firft loan, it will be fern, was npt  
applied till a coniiderable time after its  
commencement. It has been already in­  
timated that it was undertaken without  
previous authority from l;his country —  
t&quot;he motives to the meafu.i e are detailed in  
a letter from our bankers of the 2jth of  
January, i79Q,acopyof which accompa­  
nies the communications herewith made  
by order of the Prefirfent. A regard to  
&#x27;hofem tivesled to an acceptance of the  
ioan. Nor could it have been denned an  
unfortunate circumstance, that fucli an  
auxiliary to the operations of the treasury  
had beenprevioufly p.epared.  
The laws authorizing the&#x27;loans, passed  
the 4th and 12th of August. As early as  
the 28th of that month, the acceptance a­  
bove mentioned was communicated, and  
the application of 1,500.000 florins, in a  
payment to France directed. So far no  
:1 me was loft, more than could not have  
seen avoided.  
But the bills for the sum to be brought  
iiere were not drawn till some months af­  
ter. This proceeded from an unwilling­  
ness to risk the public credit, by drawing  
before there was a certainty of funds to  
answer the drafts. It was not impossible,  
that the great delay which had attended  
the parting of the law for borrowing, might  
have led the bankers to come to some ar­  
rangement with the money lenders, for  
surrendering the monies paid in, and ter­  
minating the loan. Independent of this  
source of apprehension, they had expressed  
themselves, in their letter communicating  
the step they had taken, to this effeiV —  
•&#x27; To i&#x27;pare the United States all poflible  
advance of interest, while the money shall  
remain unappropriated, we fliall issue the  
recipilTes at the option of the buyers t&lt;  
take them Jo late as they please, on the  
expectation the three millions would be  
placed in a few-months.&quot; This, though  
it announced an expectation that the mo­  
nies would be paid in, in a few months,  
did not render the event certain. And as  
  
[Total No. 14.0.]  
  
the bankers appeared from that precauti­  
on, to have adverted to the idea of saving  
the United States an advance of interell,  
it was ftippofieable t.bat they might have  
found means still further to procrastinate  
the payments, or a considerable part of  
them, rill they had received a confirmati­  
on of the loan. This policy \yould have  
been the more natural, as they risked the  
loss of interell themselves, if the transac­  
tion fliould not have been finally ratified.  
Under such circumflances I thought it  
most prudent to defer the drafts, &#x27;till ad­  
vice was received of the a&amp;ual progress of  
the loans. There was no room to hesitate  
between the loss of a small fuiTi in intereil,  
and the danger of committing the public  
credit by a premature operation.

THF, feconci cafe of delay relates to the  
second loan. It was occaftoned by a  
determination to suspend the orders for its  
application, till information was received,  
of its having been contracted for.  
One motive to this determination has  
been already intimated ; namely, the yet  
untried and immature Hate of onr fifcal  
arrangements. The general reasoning 011  
this head, was strengthened by an occur­  
rence altogether unlooked for, which dif­  
clofed-itfelf on the 23d of Atiguft 1790.  
eleven days after the ri&#x27;ing of Congref:. ;  
an occurrence which they had no: con­  
templated in their pecuniary dispositions.  
I allude to the commencement of an Indi­  
an war ; which was announced in a letter  
from governor St. Clair, dated 011 the  
above-mentioned day ; the progreiHve ex­  
tent and conf-.-quences of which could oi  
course not be forefeen. Under futh&#x27; cir­  
cumftauces, I judged it fur the public in­  
terest and fafety to hold the refourec,  
which the proipcft of a loanprefented, un­  
der the power of the treasury. till advice  
Ihould be received of the actual i.ntitution  
of the loan ; with intention then to dif&#x27;  
pose of it as ihould appear advifeable, un­  
der a better matured view of our pecuni­  
ary liination and prospects.  
Hence the delay \\ inch attended the ap­  
plication of the second loan ; the firlt in  
fact that originated subsequent to the laws  
for borrowing. But after advice had been  
received of its having been set on foot, no  
time was 101 l in converting it will due  
dispatch to its proper uses. There was on­  
ly, not an anticipation of its application.  
As early as May 24th, 1791, I wrote a let­  
ter to Mr. Short (a copy of which is in  
pofleffion of the hou(e) empowering him  
to apply the proceeds of all future toans,  
as they Ihould accrue, in payments to  
#f »- tc tS&#x27;eretn  
were, or afterwards Ihould be privioujfy  
and specially reserved. This arrangement  
was calculated to obviate the inconveni­  
cnce of leaving the proceeds of the loans,  
for any conliderable time unemployed.  
At the period of making it, and not soon­  
er, the public profpe£ts appeared to me  
fufficientiy unfolded, to render a general  
and permanent dilpolitiou free from ha­  
zard. This iftftruction preceded in due  
season all the loans subsequent to that of  
March 1791.  
Whatever delay, therefore may have at­  
tended fucceedirig inveltirents for paying  
the French debt, is not attributable to this  
department: And I think it will not ap­  
pear, that any has been incurred, in res­  
pect to the funis which were destined for  
the public ferviee here. In judging of this  
point it will be proper to observe, that a  
latitude of fix months, for making thtir  
payments, has been reserved to the money  
lenders, though with liberty to make  
them earlier. It was however neceflary  
for the treasury to regulate it&#x27;s bills ac­  
cording to the possible delay, kit they  
lliould not meet adequate funds. The  
general policy adopted was to let them fall  
upon the rear of each loan ; this giving a  
freer course for early payments to France,  
and belt conciliating a certainty of funds  
for answering the bills, with as little dou­  
ble interell as pofiible-  
It-will appear, that notWithstanding tile  
arrangement which was made, a confidera­  
bletime intervened between the two lafl  
payments tn France, while there were  
fundtin hand waiting for employment. It  
may be expected, that the causes of this  
procrastination, though as I have said not  
imputable to this department, Ihould be  
Unfolded to the House. Particular circuin­  
flances however induce me to confine my­  
&#x27; Jelf to slating generally, that the delay pro­  
ceeded, in the lirlt place, from an expec­  
tation given to Mr. Short and Kept up from  
time to time by the French minilter ol  
marine, that a plan would be adopted, tc  
which a decree of the National Aflfcmblj  
Was requilito, for converting a large fun:  
intofiipplies for St. Domingo—which Mr.  
Short concluded justly mult come out oi  
the foreign fund, and consequently suspend­  
ed its application in Europe.—ln the se­  
cond place, from a desire to fettle, previ­  
onfly to further payments, a definitive rule,  
bv which the monies paid, Ihould be liqui­  
dated and credited to the United States.  
Both the one and the other appears tc  
have been procraflinated from period tc

affairs, and to have finally ifined contrary  
10 expeilation. It would be an uunecef­  
fary commitment of my opinion to declare,  
how far the delay appears to me to have  
beenjuftified by the causes—But being led  
by the occasion to take notice oi it, I think  
11 improper to fend it abroad, liable per­  
haps tomifconftruilion, withoutobferving,  
that the inducements, appear to me, to  
have been weighty—that the delays natur­  
ally ;:ew out of the circumstances, and  
that I am entirely persuaded of the good­  
ness of the motives which governed The  
correspondence before the Senate, con­  
tains the particulars of the tranfaflion.  
Having pointed out the iiiftances of ina  
tefial delay which happened, and the caus­  
es of them, it remains to Orate what cir­  
cumstances there are to counterbalance the  
iofs 011 that account.  
These circumstances are of two kind  
1. Gain by exchange in the sale of bills  
drawn by the treasury and upon the higli­  
:r rate of intertit on the credit: wifki;  
were g&#x27;.venfor those bill , than was paya­  
ble 0.1 the fund upon which they were  
drawn.  
2. Gain by exchange on the payments to  
France.  
According to my calculation, founded  
Dn the bell information extant&#x27;, the real  
jar of the metals between the United  
states and Amsterdam, makes a current  
guilder equal to 35 89-100 ninetieths of a  
ioilar. The lowift rate which has been  
obtained lor the bills has been 36 4-11  
linetieths, with an allowance oflix.y days  
:redit without interest. Makinga dertnc -  
ion for the interest the bills werellili fold  
ibove the true- par-: In some inrtances they  
lave been fold as high aj 40 cents and 7  
ilills per guilder, with interell: for the  
.vhole term of the credit given.  
The rate of interest for the credits al­  
owed upon the bills was 6 per cent, the  
nean interest paid upon the fund 5 per  
.ent. producingconfequently again of one  
&gt;er cent.  
Witb ti&gt; to ?rA?.ce,  
f the current rate of exchange between  
?aris and Amsterdam at the moment of  
;ach remittance or payment were to gov­  
ern, a large profit would result to the Uni­  
ed States. But cei ta:n equitable conlid­  
■rations will produce deductions, which  
vV ill greatly lefi&#x27;en this: advantage ; yet mak­  
ng a liberal allowance for them, therein  
ground to calculate that a Paving may be  
nade in this particular, more than fuffici­  
■nt to indemnify for the loss of interclt.  
Hence any politive advantage which will  
lave been otherwise gained, will probably  
3e undiminifhed by hat circurfiftance.  
I proceed in the next place, to state the  
.&#x27;iews which prevailed refpeiling the funis  
:hat have been from time to time drawn  
&quot;or ; the purposes they have hitherto an­  
swered, and the further advantages to be  
;xpe£ted from rhe measure.  
The direst object of all the films drnw n  
or prior to Juiy 1792, was the purchase ot  
:he debt. A collateral consideration which  
operated in the firft stages ot drawing, has  
ilfo ment&#x27;.ined. It has likewise been  
luted, that til. purchases of the debt  
■re to be ascribed to the inftrnmentnlity  
jf the fund d rived from the loans. Tiii:  
dea shall low be explained.  
Two milt ;kes appear to have influenc­  
ed the impreflions which have been enter­  
rained 1 relation, direiUy or indirectly to  
this fubjeit. ! irft, it seems to have been  
ill alorgforgotten, that a conliderablepart  
as the duties is always outstanding, on ac­  
count of the credits which are given :  
whence the afiertion, that the finking fund  
iias continually overflowed from domellio  
resources. Second, it seems to have been  
taken for granted that tiie proct eds of the  
Loans have remained apart, r&#x27;iftinft fron:  
the mass of the money in the Treasury :  
while in truth the course of the bufincf;  
lias been to turn them over to the Treasur­  
er by warrants as they have been received  
Co as to form a part of the aggregate, fron  
time to time appearing in his hands and :i  
iiis accounts. The banks have been the  
agents employed for felling the bills.  
Sometimes warrants on qcconnt have is­  
sued upon them, for the funis accruing  
from the files, at other times the warrant:  
have been deferred till the whole proceed:  
of any parcel have been received and tlu  
accounts of the banks fettled at the treasu­  
ry; as the state of the treasury has hap  
pened to render the one or the other mo!  
convenient.  
The banks of North America and New-  
York, were the agents for the sale of a!  
the bills, which were fold prior to Apri  
  
r792. amounting to 1,006,526 dollars and  
36 cents. Of this sum 361,391 dollars and  
34 cents, were passed over to the Treafnr­  
er in 1-91—327,136 dollars and 22 cents  
1 1 M.-.rch 1792, and 140,000 dollars in June  
f &gt;llo\ving—the rehdue having remained as  
heretofore [fated, in depolit with the bank  
of North America upon a special consid­  
eration. This is exclusive of certain bills  
turnijlv:d for the use of the department of  
Stated amounting to 78,766 dollars and 67  
cents.  
Tht i-om tinder of the bills which have  
been fold beginning in April 1792, were  
fold by the b.i ik of the United .-tales, and  
irs branches at New- V ork and Baltimore-  
The kccoi: t . f the files had just been  
madaout t I&#x27;etrl erne fit, when the present  
enqnii v!&gt; 1 but warrants had not yet  
1 flu .■ ■ ,»l v; the proceedin the trea­  
u.-y. It \vi:: be remarked that from the  
L&#x27;rmi o: redit allowed, they Only began

;lay of which month the firif return made  
by tilt* bank (hews a sum of 127,225 dol­  
lars aid j . cents received ; and that the  
caMeftion had not been completed when  
the accounts of files were rendered.  
Th. . e are dfferent views of the fub­  
jeft which will enable the House to per­  
ceive&#x27; that the possession of the fund in  
que (Hon was neceifary to enable the trea­  
fliry to furniih the means of making all  
the pur chafes which were niaile prior to  
July 1702.  
It i true, that there was a ftirpius of re­  
venue to the end of the year 179°* equal  
to 1, -4,656 dollars and 40 cents, which  
was approp, iited to purchases of the debt;  
and from the credits then given upon the  
Juties, this surplus would naturally come  
into the treasury in the course of the year  
&#x27;*?!•  
Hut the legislature forefeeing that the  
revenue of 1791, from the fame cause,  
:ould.not actually be in the treasury, with­  
in that year, to face the appropriations, up­  
jn it„ which it is to be observed were  
if:&quot; ■ -d) &#x27;  
erted a clause in the law, appropriating  
:he surplus of 1790, to the purchase of the  
Jebt, which authorized a reservation of so  
nuch of that surplus as might be neceifary  
:o make the payments of intereit during  
1791 ; in cafe of a deficiency in the re­  
ceipts into the treasury, on account of the  
current revenue of the year.  
It will appear to t.ie House, upon a re­  
currence to the Tresfurer&#x27;s quarterly ac­  
count, ending the 30th of September, 1791&#x27;  
that the balance of cash then 011 hand was  
562,233 dollars and 99 cents.  
At that time there had been paid into the  
treasury, upon warrants, from the proceeds  
us the bills drawn upon the foreign fund  
361,391 dollars and 34 cents. Consequent­  
ly, the balance of cadi, had it not been  
for that auxiliary, would have been only  
300,842 dollars and 65 cents; conlidering  
the whole balance in the treasury as repre­  
lenting an equal sum ot the proceeds of  
the bills.  
Even in a time of complete pcace, in a  
country where a small extent of monied  
capital&#x27;forbids a reliance upon large pecu­  
niary aids to he suddenly obtained—a pru­  
dent idminiftrator of the finances could  
not feel entirely ateafe, with a less sum at  
all times in the certain command ot the  
treasury, than 500,000 dollars, for meeting  
current dema ids and extra exigencies,  
which 111 the affairs of a ..nation are every  
moment to be expected. Rut with a war  
:ictually on hand, and a pofitbility of its ex­  
tendon to a more serious length, he would  
be inexcusable, in leaving himfelf with a  
lefsfunh at command ; unlets from an im­  
practicability of doing otherwise. It would  
be always his duty to combine two conli­  
derations—the chance of extra call&#x27;s for  
money, and a uofiibility of some failure in  
the receipts which were expected. De­  
rangements of various kinds may happen ill  
the commercial circle, capable of inter­  
rupting for a time the pun£fual course of  
payments to the treasury. It is neceifary  
to a certain extent to be prepared for such  
casualties  
But during the year 1791, there was a  
circumilancp, which operated as an rc!di­  
tiontd reason for keeping a reipeilabie sum  
always on hand. The loans of the domeffic  
debt were going on till the lait of Septem­  
ber of that year; while at the fame time,  
theintereli wasin a course of payment—It  
was therefore always uncertain what fur.i  
would be payable at the end ot a quarter ;  
this depending 011 the eagernefi or back­  
vardnffs. oi the public creditors in bring­  
ing forward their ftibfcript.ons, or thsir  
  
[Total No. 141.]  
  
claims as non-subscribers. The omifJTons,  
at the end of a preceding quarter, might t&gt;s  
expected to fall upon a subsequent one—  
and it was neccifary to be prepared for t Mat  
poiiibility ; of course to keep in hand a 1 r.r­  
ger fund for contingent demands. Thh  
necellity extended to the termination of  
the period for receiving subscriptions ; be­  
cause the treasury was to be prepared on  
the supposition, that the whole of the ;lo­  
meftic debt would then be in a (late to re­  
ceive interelt either as JubJcribed or uvjvb­  
f&#x27;cribei. But this did not in fail happe fi—  
A part of the fuins which were prelected  
were crouded into the last days of the  
quarter and uere too late for a dividend­  
.i conliderable sum remained ultimately ii*  
i farm, which according to the terms of  
the provision did not intitlei it to inurelt,  
either asJubfcribed or ■&amp;swtjubjcribt:&lt;\ debt.  
Hence the cadi in the treasury on the ift  
as October 1791. was by a conliderable sum  
rreaterthan was to have beep counted up­  
jn or than might have happened.  
The concluiion which results from tlia  
7oregoing observations is this—that ths  
jurchafes which preceded the ill of Octo­  
ber 1-91, and which amounted to $99,984  
dollars and 23 cents in specie could not  
lave been hazarded, &#x27;put for the aid of the  
inns which had actually accrued from the  
proceeds of the bills and the expectation of  
:!iofe which were to accrue from the yet:  
uncollected proceeds of others.  
Had it not been f fir this aid, the treasury  
would have been Iclt more bare, th,.n was  
,&#x27;onliUent with the leciirity of public credit  
ind the certain e/Xecution et the public  
ervice.  
There is however a later period inths  
date of the treasury, which will more com­  
pletely illuftra.te the idea intended to be  
eltablifiied. This is the 2d &lt;of July, 1792.  
On that d-jy, the balance of call) in the  
treasury, comprehendi jig theclepofits in all  
the banks, and including a sum of 200, cc?  
ilollars, received 011 loan of the bank cf the  
United States, together with a sum of  
10,900 dollars in .bills drawn upon do­  
iiietKc funds, tlie proceeds of which had  
not been received, was 623,133 dollars anJ  
61 cents.  
Prior to this period a further sum of  
545,902 dollars and 89 tents arising from  
the sales of foreign bills had been placed in  
the treasury, by warrants, making with  
the former films placed there from the  
fame fiiurce, 907,294 dollars anil 23 cents.  
Had it not been for this auxiliary, and  
that of the loan from the bank, the treasu­  
ry would then have been in arrear 484,1(0  
dollars and 62 cents. It therefore necei­  
farily follows, that for the purchases 11  
that period, which amounted in specie tn  
942.672 dollars and 54 cents, at leaf:  
484,160 dollars and cents mult have  
come from the foreign fund.  
But when it is conlidered, for the rea­  
sons which have been Hated, and which  
will hereafter be fortified by others, tend­  
ing as I conceive, to give them conc&#x27;ufive  
force, that the sum in the treasury at the  
period in question, was barely w hat ought  
to have been there for fafcty, and for a clue  
fii&#x27;pply to current demands—lt will follow  
that the whole or nearly the whole of the  
purchases which were made previous to&#x27;  
[illy 1799, were made by the means or in­  
fh umentality of the foreign fund.  
A (imilar view, extended to the subse­  
quent quarter, will exhibit this point in a.  
(till clearer light. The balance then in  
the treasury, including a further loan from  
the bank of 100,000 dollars, was ouly  
420,914 dollars and 51 cents.  
What then, it may be allied, became of  
the surplus of revenue to the end of i-qo ?  
\\ hat was the office performed by that fund  
during the period in queltion ?  
The artfwer is, that it served ex.i Sly the  
purpose which was anticipated by the le­  
gifiature. It came in aid of the current;  
receipt for fatisfying the current expendi­  
ture of 1791, with particular reference to  
the intcrefi. of the debt- This will ealilv  
be comprehended when it is recollected  
that tlie appropriations made during 1:91,  
upon the revenues of that year, ai .! fume  
fm&#x27;all furplulfes of antecedent appropria­  
tions, amounted to three millions fix hun­  
dred and thirty-seven thousand and.-ftfty­  
tlgh: dollars and thirty-four tents ; thas?  
the revenues themselves amounted to no  
more than three million five hundred and  
fifty-three thoufard. one hundred und  
ninety-five dollars and eighteen cents; a id

Oa t!»is point i&#x27;kcwife, of the surplus of

a mifapprehenfioti has been entertained,  
It Teems to have been supposed, that thai

ed, that this was not the cafe with regard  
to the foreign fund. It is now proper to  
add. that it has 110 c been the cafe, either,  
with regard to the surplus in question.  
That surplus, as received by the collettors  
of the customs, has regularly palled into  
the treasury, and appears in the quarterly  
accounts of the treasurer for the periods tu  
which they relate.  
it is ihe course of the treasury, resulting  
from the conllitution of the department,  
star ail monies from whatever source, to be  
brought into it, to conllitute an aggre­  
gate ; fubjedt to the difpolitions prescribed  
by law. The monies to be employed in  
the lfliking fund, have consequently only  
been separated, as they have been called  
foir, for attual inueflment• The only ex­  
ception to this, relates to that part of th«  
finking fund, which is created by the inte­  
rest of the debt purchased. This has beei:

rT~IO the foregoing representation, it may  
X fecm an objection that the purchases  
to the end of 1791, appear to have been  
carried to the account 01 the surplus at the  
end of 1790.  
The ult:mate form which it has been  
judged convenient to give to the tranfaca­  
-011 in the accounts ofthe Treasury, tan­  
not change what was truly the course of  
fadts. The proceeds of the above menti­  
oned surplus and of theforeignloansfoim­  
ed together the fund for purchases. In tilt  
accounts of treasury, the tiling was fuf-  
of various modi(k&gt;-tio.&gt;,&gt; at pL-a­  
fure- The two parr, of the ..fiyM ju«£li.  
have been united in one accoßHl, or divid  
e*l into dirtinct accounts. Being separated.  
monies ilfued for purchases might have  
been legally carried to either of them.  
It was judged mod advifea&#x27;.iie, in the  
forms of the treasury, to place the pur­  
chases to the end of 1791, to the account oj  
the domestic fund, because it was calcula­  
ted to give greater latitude and energy tc  
the finking fund. Had not this cour.&#x27;e beer  
pmTued, the bulinefs would have taken the  
following shape—the foreign fund to th(  
extent of the purchases, would have beer  
exhaurted—the whole, or the greater pari  
of the surplus of 1790, would have conti-  
Aued wrapt up in the expenditure of 1791.  
not liable to be liberated, till the receipt.  
into the treasury should yield a correspond­  
ent surplus beyond the actual dijbtirje­  
ments—which could not have been the c fe  
while the war with the Indians continue:  
to call for extraordinary expenditures.  
From, the form into which the thing ha*  
been thrown, the foreign fund has been fel  
frre to be applied to in. pnrctrafifs ;  
and a necessity produced of anticipating  
the qutftanding duties, by temporary loans  
for the- current service.  
I trust there can be no doubt, that the  
course pursued was regular, and within the  
discretion of the department. I hope al­  
so, that it will appear to the hotife to have  
been the mall eligible The expediency oi  
giving the earliest and greatest pofiible ex­  
tent and activity to whatever concerns the  
finking fund, will, it is prefunied, unite all  
opinions.  
What has been said hitherto refpecling  
the employment of the foreign fundsis ap­  
plicable only to that part of it which \va.  
drawnfor prior to April 1792 ; the residue  
ft.-mding in a different situation and requir­  
ing a separate examination.  
From the statement which has been giv­  
en, it may be perceived that the fund ir  
quertion has neither been idle nor useless.  
A confirmation of this will be found in the  
following detaila.  
The whole sum successively received or

of August 1791, was 361,391 dollars an

The whole sum successively received or

The whole sum successively received or

ceased to be advantageous­  
-1 he drawing of these bills has been ai

J the Houle, that the measure was re­  
commended by an adequate profpett ol  
advantage.  
It is to be observed that all these draft;  
were predicated uponthetwofour per cent  
loana ; being as already stated real 4 i-e  
aer cent loans.  
There was good ground to presume, that  
opportunities would be found of inveftinj;  
he monies drawn for 1 1 purchases which  
ivould yield at leal! 5 per cent, with a pof  
Sbility of doing, hili better. The clittcr..  
rrjeo of i .2 per cent, was alone an  
of importancebut it would be coupled  
with the further benefitot reducing a prm

the advantage of having ant,tip ted ir

That this was the vieu of the fubjVit
