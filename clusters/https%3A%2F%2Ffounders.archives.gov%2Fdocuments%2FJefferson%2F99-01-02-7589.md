 for the attention you have paid to this commission, and the trouble it has given you.  
from Your letter of the 27th. Ult. I percieve that painful impressions have been made on your mind, during your late mission, of which I had never entertained a suspicion. I must therefore examine the grounds, because explanations between reasonable men can never but do good.   1. you consider the mission of mr Pinckney as an associate, to have been in some way injurious to you. were I to take that measure on myself, I might say in it’s justification that it has been the regular &amp; habitual practice of the US. to do this under every form in which their government has existed. I need not recapitulate the multiplied instances, because you will readily recollect them. I went as an adjunct to Dr. Franklin &amp; mr Adams, yourself as an adjunct first to mr Livingston, and then to mr Pinckney, &amp; I really believe there has scarcely been a great occasion which has not produced an extraordinary mission.

2. You complain of the manner in which the treaty was recieved. but what was that manner? I cannot suppose you to have given a moment’s credit to the stuff which was crouded in all sorts of forms into the public papers, or to the thousand speeches they put into my mouth, not a word of which I had ever uttered. I was not insensible at the time of the views to mischief with which these lies were fabricated. but my confidence was firm that neither yourself nor the British government, equally outraged by them, would believe me capable of making the editors of newspapers the confidents of my speeches or opinions. the fact was this. the treaty was communicated to us by mr Erskine on the day Congress was to rise. two of the Senators enquired of me in the evening whether it was my purpose to detain them on account of the treaty. my answer was ‘that it was not: that the treaty containing no provision against the impressment of our seamen, and being accompanied by a kind of protestation of the British ministers which would leave that government free to consider it as a treaty or no treaty, according to their own convenience, I should not give them the trouble of deliberating on it.’ this was substantially, &amp; almost verbally what I said whenever spoken to about it, and I never failed, when the occasion would admit of it, to justify yourself and mr Pinckney by expressing my conviction that it was all that could be obtained from the British government; that you had told their commissioners that your government could not be pledged to ratify, because it was contrary to their instructions, of course that it should be considered but as a Projet; and in this light I stated it publicly in my message to Congress on the opening of this session. not a single article of the treaty was ever made known beyond the members of the administration; nor would an article of it be known at this day but for it’s publication in the newspapers as communicated by somebody from beyond the water as we have always understood. but as to myself I can solemnly protest as the most sacred of truths that I never one instant lost sight of your reputation and favorable standing with your country, &amp; never omitted to justify your failure to attain our wish as one which was probably unattainable. reviewing therefore this whole subject I cannot doubt you will become sensible that your impressions have been without just ground.

h our credulous friends are floating.] if you have been made to believe that I ever did, said, or thought a thing unfriendly to your fame &amp; feelings, you do me injury as causeless as it is afflicting to me. in the present contest in which you are concerned, I feel no passion, I take no part, I express no sentiment. whichever of my friends is called to the supreme cares of the nation, I know that they will be wisely &amp; faithfully administered; and as far as my individual conduct can influence, they shall be cordially supported. for myself I have nothing further to ask of the world than to preserve in retirement so much of their esteem as I may have fairly earned, and to be permitted to pass in tranquility, in the bosom of my family &amp; friends the days which yet remain for me. having reached the harbour myself, I shall view with anxiety (but certainly not with a wish to be in their place) those who are still buffeting the storm, uncertain of their fate. your voyage has so far been favorable, &amp; that it may continue with entire prosperity is the sincere prayer of that friendship which I have ever borne you, and of which I now assure you, with the tender of my high respect &amp; affectionate salutations.

whether it was my purpose to detain them

ters which would leave that government  
free to consider it as a treatv nr no treaty,

should not give them th« trouble of deli­

the occasion would admit of it, to justify

that you had told their commissioners  
that your government could not he pledged  
to raiiTv, because it was contrary to (heir  
inwruClions, of course that it should be  
Considered but as a orojr^l ; and in ihi*  
light I seated it publicly in my m-^sag&#x27;  
to congress on the opening of this session.  
Not a si &#x27;gt.j article of the treaty was e..  
vrr mad- known beyond the members o!

of it hr known a* this day b&gt;it for its pub.

attainable. Reviewing therefore his ** hole

hipforhim, which is ardent and  
strong, I am, Dear Sir,  
Yours, Sec.  
JAMES MONttOE.  
  
Washington City, Marcblo, I808.  
Deai Sir, .  
From your letter of the 27ih ult­  
I perceive that painful impressions  
have been made on your mind dur  
uig your lute mission, of which I  
had never entertained a suspicion.  
I must therefore examine the  
kjroundi, because explanations be  
f. veen reasonable men can never  
ut do good. 1st, You consider  
the mission of Mr. Pinckney as  
an associate, to have been in some  
way injurious to you. liut I might  
say in it justification, that it has  
ccn the regular and habitual prac­  
tice of the U States to do this un­  
der every form in which their Go­  
vernment has existed. I need not  
recapitulate the multiplied instan­  
ces, because you will readily re­  
collect them. I went as an adjunct  
to Dr. Franklin and Mr. Adams,  
voursclfas an adjunct, first to Mr.  
Livingston, and then to Mr.Pinck­  
ney, and I really believe there has?  
scarcely been a great occasion  
which hns not produced an extra­  
ordinary mission.

2d, You complain tf the man­  
ner in which the treaty was re  
ceived ; but what was that man  
ner I cannot suppose you to havv  
given a moment&#x27;s credit to the stuff  
which was crowded in all sorts 01  
forms into the public papers, or t  
the thousand speeches they put into  
mv mouth, not a word of which I  
had ever uttered. I was not insen­  
sible at the time of the views to  
mischief with which these lies were  
fabricated. But my confidence  
was firm that neither yourself nor  
the British Government, equally  
outraged by them, would believe  
me capable of making the editors  
ol newspapers the confidants of my  
speeches or opinions. The fact  
was this. The treaty was commu­  
nicated to us by Mr. Erlyne on  
the clay congress was to rise. Two  
of the senators enquired of me in  
:he evening whether it wa3 my  
purpose to detain them on a- count  
a . 1 m v  
01 tne treaty. ;iy answer was,  
that it was not : that the treaty  
containing no provision against the  
impressment of our seamen, and  
being accompanied by a kind of  
protestation of the British minis­  
ter, which would leave that Go­  
vernment free to consider it as a  
treaty or nu treaty, according to  
their own convenience, I shou&#x27;.d  
not give them the trouble of deli­  
berating on it.&#x27;  
This was substantially, and al­  
most verbally what I said whene­  
ver spoken to about ir, and I ne  
ver failed, when the occasion  
wauld admit of it, to justify your,  
self and Mr. Pinckney by express  
sing my conviction thit it was all  
thai could be obtained from the  
British government; that you  
had told their commissioners that&#x27;  
your government could not be  
pledged to ratify, because it was  
contrary to their instructions, of  
course that it should be consider,  
ed but is a project ; and in this  
&#x27;.ight I stated it publicly in my mes­  
sage to cougress on the opening  
jf the session. Not a single ar­  
ticle of the treaty was eyer  
made kno-.n beyond the mem­  
kts of the administration,, nor  
would an article of it have  
been known at this day, but for its  
publication in . the newspapers  
ts communicated by somebody  
from beyond the water, as we  
nave always understood. But . as  
to myself I can solemnly protest,  
4S the moat solemn f truhs, that  
  
I never one instant lost &quot;sight of  
your reputation &amp; favorablestand­  
ing with Vour country, and never  
omitted to justify your failure to  
attain dur wish as one which was  
probably unattainable. &#x27;  
Reviewing therefore this whole  
subject, I cannot doubt you will  
become sensible that your impres­  
sions have been without just  
ground I cannot, indeed, judge  
what falsehoods &quot;may have been  
written or told you,f but if you have  
been made to btlieve that I ?ver  
did, said or thought a thing uo­  
friendly to your fame and feelings,  
you do me injury as causeless; as it  
is afflicting to me J In the present  
contest in which you are concern  
ed, I feel no passion, I rake no  
  
part, I express no sentiment.  
j Which ever of my friends is calL  
ed to the supreme cares ot the na­  
tion, I know that they will be wise  
ly and faithfully&#x27; administered ; &amp;  
as far as my individual&#x27; conduct  
can influence, they shall be cor­  
ially supported, i For myself I  
have nothing further to ask of the!  
world, then to preserve in retire­  
ment so much of their esteem as I  
may have fairly earned, and to be  
permitted to pass in tranquility, in  
the bosom of my family &amp; friends,  
the days which yet remain for me.  
Having reached the harbour my­  
self, I shall view with anxiety (but  
ertainly not with a wish to be in  
&#x27;heir place) those who are still buf­  
eting the storm, uncertain of their  
fate. Your voyage has so far been  
favorable, and that it may continue  
with entire prosperity is the sincere  
prayer of that irjendship which I  
have ever borne you, with the ten­  
der of my high respect and affec­  
tionate salutations.
