generally referred to in the invitations, and with respect to which, my adherence was well  
known.  
You call my attention, with much emphasis, to &quot;the principle openly avowed by the President and his friends,  
that offices and emoluments were the spoils of victory, the personal property of the successful candidate for the  
presidency, to be given as rewards for electioneering services; and in general to be used as the means of rewarding those  
who support, and of punishing those who do not support, the dispenser of the fund.&quot; I fully agree in all the odium you  
attach to such a rule of action. But I have not seen any avowal of such a principle by the President, and suspect that few  
if any of his friends would openly avow it. The first I believe who openly proclaimed the right and policy, in a  
successful candidate for the presidency, to reward friends and punish enemies, by removals and appointments, is now the  
most vehement, in branding the practice. Indeed, the principle if avowed without the practice, or practiced without the  
avowal, could not fail to degrade any Administration; both together completely so. The odium itself would be an antidote  
to the poison of the example, and a security against the permanent danger apprehended from it.  
What you dwell on most is, that nullification is more on the decline, and less dangerous, than the popularity

tutional doctrines is armed. In this I cannot agree with you. His popularity is  
evidently and rapidly sinking under the unpopularity of his doctrines. Look at the increasing minorities in States which  
have not yet become majorities. Look at the leading partizans who have abandoned and turned against him; and at the  
reluctant and qualified support given by many who still profess to adhere to him. It cannot be doubted that the danger and  
even existence of the heresies which have grown up under the auspices of his name, will expire with his natural or his  
official life, if not previously to either.  
On the other hand what more dangerous than nullification, or more evident than the progress it continues to  
make, either in its original shape, or in the disguises it assumes. Nullification has the effect of putting powder under  
the Constitution and Union, and a match in the hand of every party to blow them up at pleasure: And for its progress,  
hearken to the tone in which it is now preached; cast your eye on its increasing minorities in most of the Southern States  
without a decrease in any one of them. Look at Virginia herself and read in the Gazettes, and in the proceedings of  
popular meetings, the figure which the anarchical principle now makes, in contrast with the scouting reception given to it  
but a short time ago.  
It is not probable that this offspring of the discontents of South Carolina, will ever approach success, in a  
majority of the States. But a susceptibility of the contagion in the Southern States is visible; and the danger not to be  
concealed, that the sympathies arising from known causes, and the inculcated impression of a permanent incompatibility of  
interests between the South and the North, may put it in the power of popular leaders aspiring to the highest stations,  
(and despairing of success on the Federal theatre) to unite the South, on some critical occasion, in a course that will  
end in creating a new theatre, of great tho’ inferior extent. In pursuing this course, the first and most obvious step is  
nullification; the next secession; and the last a farewell separation. How near was this course being lately exemplified?  
And the danger of its recurrence in the same or some other quarter may be increased by an increase of restless aspirants,  
and by the increasing impracticability of retaining in the Union a large and cemented section against its will. It may
