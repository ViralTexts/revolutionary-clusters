The General here in confidence introduced a report of a Committee of Congress that no persons holding an hereditary title or order of nobility should be eligible to citizenship in the new state they are about to establish, and declared that he knew this to be levelled at our Institution—that, our friends had prevented it from passing into resolution, till the result of this meeting should be known; but if we do not make it conformable to their sense of republican principles we might expect every discouragement and even persecution from them and the states severally—That 99 in a hundred would become our violent enemies.

d, that they be read &amp; lay on the table.  
The Committee for arrangement of the Papers report that they have ready for inspection of the Meeting a part which they wish to lay on the table—&amp; ask to sit again—  
Resolved that this general Meeting will on Monday next go into a Committee of the whole, to take into Consideration the Alterations &amp; Amendments of the Institution of the Society of the Cincinnati as proposed &amp; reported by the Committee appointed for that purpose. Adjourned to Monday morning, at 9 o’clock.  
The following is the form of the Institution, agreeable to the Alterations and Amendments proposed.  
  
  
  
1st It having pleased the Supreme Governor of the Universe in the disposition of human affairs, to cause the separation of the Colonies of North America from the domination of Great Britain, &amp; after a bloody conflict of eight years, to establish them free, Independant, &amp; Sovereign States, connected by alliances, founded on reciprocal advantage, with some of the great Princes &amp; Powers of this Earth. Therefore—Gratefully to commemorate this vast event—to continue the mutual Friendships which have been formed under the pressure of common danger and in many instances cemented by the blood of the parties, &amp; to inculcate the great social duty of laying down in peace the Arms assumed for public defence, by forming an Institution which recognizes that sacred and most important principle, and to effectuate those substantial acts of Beneficence dictated by the spirit of Brotherly kindness towards those Officers &amp; their families, who unfortunately may be under the necessity of receiving them:  
The Officers of the American Army do hereby in the most solemn manner associate, constitute &amp; combine themselves into one society of Friends—having generally been taken from the citizens of America &amp; holding in high veneration the Character of that illustrious Roman, Lucius Quintius Cincinnatus, whose example they follow by returning to their Citzenship, think, they may with propriety denominate themselves—The Society of the Cincinnati—  
2d The Society shall be governed by the following rules &amp; obligations—  
3d All the Commissioned Officers of the Continental Army and Navy, as well those who have resigned with honour after three years service in the capacity of Officers, or who have been deranged by the resolutions of Congress upon the several reforms of the Army; as  
  
those who shall have continued to the end of the War, have the right to become parties to this Institution; provided that they subscribe one month’s pay, and sign their names to the general rules in their respective State Societies on or before the fourth day of July, 1784—Extraordinary cases excepted, The rank, Time of service, resolutions of Congress by which any have been deranged, and places of residence, must be added to each Name—  
4th Those Officers who are foreigners, not resident in any of the States, will have their names enrolled by the Secretary General, and are to be considered as members in the societies of any of the State in which they may happen to be—  
5th The General society will for the sake of frequent communications be divided into State Societies, and those again into such districts as shall be directed by the State Society—  
6th The Societies of the districts to meet as often as shall be agreed upon by the State Society; those of the States annually on such days and at such places as they shall find expedient; and the General society on the first Monday in May, annually, so long as they shall deem necessary, and after wards at least once in every three years—  
7th The State Societies will consist of all the members residing in each State respectively, and any member removing from one State to another, is to be considered in all respects as belonging to the Society of the State in which he shall actually reside—  
8th The State Societies to have a President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer &amp; assistant Treasurer, to be chosen annually by a Majority of votes at the state meeting.  
9th The Meeting of the General society shall consist of its Officers, and a representation from each State society, in number not exceeding five, whose expences shall be borne by their respective state Societies.  
10th In the General meeting, the President, Vice President, Secretary, and assistant-Secretary, shall be chosen to serve untill the next Meeting—  
11th Each State Meeting shall write annually, or oftener if necessary, a Circular Letter to the other State Societies, noting whatever they may think worthy of observation, respecting the good of the Society, and giving information of the Offices chosen for the current year; Copies of these letters shall be regularly transmitted to the Secretary General of the Society, who will record them in a book to be assigned for that purpose—  
12th Each State Society will regulate every thing respecting itself &amp; the societies of the districts, consistent with the general Maxims of the Cincinnati—Judge of the qualifications of the Members who may be  
  
proposed, and expel any Member, who by a conduct inconsistant with a Gentleman and a Man of Honour, or by an opposition to the interest of the Community in general, or the Society in particular, may render himself unworthy to continue a Member.  
13th Each State Society shall obtain a list of its members, and at the next annual meeting, the State Secretary shall have engrossed on parchment two Copies of the institution of the Society, which every member present shall sign, and the Secretary shall endeavour to procure the signature of every absent Member, one of those lists to be transmitted to the secretary general to be kept in the Archives of the Society, and the other to remain in the hands of the State secretary.  
14th From the State lists the Secretary General shall make out at the first General Meeting, a complete list of the whole society, with a Copy of which he will furnish each State secretary.  
15th The Circular Letters which have been written by the respective State societies to each other, and the particular laws, shall be read and considered, and all measures concerted which may conduce to the benevolent Principles of the Society.  
16th In order to form sufficient funds to assist the unfortunate, each Officer shall deliver to the Treasurer of the State society one month’s pay—which shall remain for the use of the State society, the interest only, if necessary, to be appropriated to the relief of the unfortunate.  
17th Donations may be received from members of the Society or others, for the express purpose of forming funds for the uses aforesaid, The interest of these donations to be appropriated in the same manner as that of the month’s pay, Also monies at the pleasure of each member, may be subscribed in the societies of the districts, or the State societies, the whole whereof may be applied by the State society for the relief of the unfortunate members, or their Widows and Orphans.

d sign’d and transmitted by the President—  
  
  
  
From the General Meeting held in Philadelphia on the first Monday in May, 1784—To the Senior Land and Naval Officers and others, Members of the Society of the Cincinnati in France.  
Gentlemen  
We, the Delegates of the Cincinnati having judged it expedient to make several material alterations &amp; amendments in our Institution—&amp; having thought it our duty to communicate the Reasons upon which we have acted in a circular Address to the State Societies, do now transmit for your Information—a Transcript of that letter, together with a Copy of the Institution as altered and amended.  
Conscious of having done what Prudence &amp; Love of Country dictated—we are persuaded you will be satisfied with the Propriety of our Conduct when you are informed, our decisions were influenced by a Conviction that some Things contained in our original System might eventually be productive of Consequences which we had not forseen, as well as, by the Current of Sentiments which appeared to prevail amongst our fellow citizens—Under these circumstances we  
  
viewed it as no Proof of Magnanimity to persist in any thing which might possibly be erroneous, or to conteract the Opinion of Community, however founded.  
Nor were we displeased to find the jealous eye of Patriotism watching over those Liberties which had been established by our common Exertions—especially as our Countrymen appear’d fully disposed to do Justice to our Intentions, &amp; to apprehend no Evils but such as might happen in Process of Time, after we, in whom they placed so much Confidence, should have quitted the stage of human action—&amp; we flatter ourselves we felt not less interested in guarding against disastrous Contingencies, in averting present or future political Evils than the most zealous of our Compatriots.  
For us then it is enough that our benevolent purposes of relieving the unfortunate should not be frustrated—that our Friendships should be as immutable as They are sincere &amp; that you have received the Tokens of them with such tender Marks of Sensibility—For you, Gentlemen let it be sufficient that your merits &amp; Services are indelibly impressed upon the Hearts of a whole Nation, &amp; that your Names and Actions can never be lost in oblivion.  
Cherishing such sentiments, &amp; receiprocating all your affections, we pray you will have the goodness to believe, that altho’ nothing could have increasd our friendship—yet by your Alacrity in associating with us you have taken the most effectual Measures for rivetting more strongly those indissoluble Ties. We have the honour, &amp;c, &amp;c.”  
  
  
  
The Committee for preparing the Form of a Diploma reported &amp; lay on the Table the Draft of a Form which being read &amp; considered was approved &amp; is as follows:  
  
  
  
Be it known—that W. L.—is a Member of the Society of the Cincinnati, instituted by the Officers of the American Army at the Period of its Dissolution—As well for the Commemoration of the great Event which gave Independance to North America as for the Laudable Purposes of inculcating the Duty of laying down in Peace Arms assumed for public Defence &amp; uniting in Acts of brotherly Affection, &amp; Bonds of perpetual Freindship the Members constituting the same—  
In Testimony whereof I, the President of the said Society, having hereunto set my hand at Phi. in the State of P——this 18th Day of May, in the Year of our Lord 1784 &amp; in the 8th Year of Independance of the United States—

that you have received the tokens

“ All the officers of the American Army, as well

years’ service in the capacity of officers or who have  
been deranged by the resolutions of Congress upon  
the several reforms of the army as those who shall

as a testimony of affection to the memory and the

their eldest male branches shall have the same right  
of becoming members as the children of the actual

decided upon an order “which,” as the  
records say, “shall be a medal of gold sus-  
pended by a deep blue riband edged with  
white, descriptive of the union of France and  
America.” In recent years the deep blue  
of the “riband” has become a light blue,  
but apparently without any official authoriza-  
tion. The description of the medal is quite  
elaborate. On the obverse are three sena-  
tors presenting Cincinnatus with a sword  
and other military ensigns, while on a field  
in the background is his wife standing at  
the door of their cottage, near which are a  
plow and instruments of husbandry. Sur-  
rounding these figures is the legend,  
“ Omnia reliquit servare rempublicam.” On  
the reverse is the sun rising over a city with  
open gates and vessels entering the port  
while Fame crowns Cincinnatus with a  
wreath inscribed, “ Virtutis Premium.” Be-  
low are joined hands with the motto “ Zsto
