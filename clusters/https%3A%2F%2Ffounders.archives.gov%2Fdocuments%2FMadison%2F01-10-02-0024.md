Dickinson moved that the members of the Senate be elected by the state legislatures.  
  
Mr. Madison. If the motion (of Mr. Dickenson) should be agreed to, we must either depart from the doctrine of proportional representation; or admit into the Senate a very large number of members. The first is inadmissible, being evidently unjust. The second is inexpedient. The use of the Senate is to consist in its proceeding with more coolness, with more system, &amp; with more wisdom, than the popular branch. Enlarge their number and you communicate to them the vices which they are meant to correct. He differed from Mr. D. who thought that the additional number would give additional weight to the body. On the contrary it appeared to him that their weight would be in an inverse ratio to their number. The example of the Roman Tribunes was

If an election by the people, or thro’ any other channel than the State Legislatures promised as uncorrupt &amp; impartial a preference of merit, there could surely be no necessity for an appointment by those Legislatures. Nor was it apparent that a more useful check would be derived thro’ that channel than from the people thro’ some other. The great evils complained of were that the State Legislatures run into schemes of paper money &amp;c. whenever solicited by the people, &amp; sometimes without even the sanction of the people.

Dickinson. ‘The Legislature of a numerous  
people ought to be a numerous body. I wish the  
Senate to bear as strong a likeness as possible to  
the British House of Lords, and to consist of men  
distinguished for their rank in life and their weight  
of property. Such characters are more likely to  
be selected by the State Legislatures than in any  
other mode.’ ‘To depart from the proportional  
representation in the Senate,’ said Madison,  
‘is inadmissible, being evidently unjust. The  
use of the Senate is to consist in its pro-  
ceeding with more coolness, system, and wisdom  
than the popular branch. Enlarge their number,

It was proposed in the constitutional  
convention to have the. senators elected  
by the people. Madison said in the  
course of the debate: &quot;The true ques­  
tion was, in what mode the best choice  
would be made. If an election by the  
people, or through any other channel  
than the state legislatures, promised as  
incorrupt and impartial a preference of  
merit, there could surely be no ueces­  
sity for an appointment by those legis­  
latures.&quot; Sherman opposed elections  
by the people &quot;as not likely to produce  
such fit men as elections by the state  
legislatures.&quot; In short, the opinion  
prevailed that the legislatures would  
elect better men.  
  
What led to this opinion was the ex­  
pectation that the senators would be  
the direct choice of the legislatures, as  
it was expected that the president  
would be the direct choice of the  
electoral college, and hence, in both  
instances, that the election would be  
the deliberate choice of a body of me
