Dear Sir,  
Mount Vernon 13th July 1798.  
  
I had the honour on the evening of the 11th. instant to receive from the hands of the Secretary of War, your favour of the 7th. announcing, that you had with the advice and consent of the Senate appointed me “Lieutenant General and Commander in Chief of all the Armies raised, or to be raised, for the Service of the U.S”  
I cannot express how greatly affected I am at this New proof of public confidence, and the highly flattering manner in which you have been pleased to make the communication; at the sametime I must not conceal from you my earnest wish, that the choice had fallen upon a man less declined in years and better qualified to encounter the usual vicissitudes of War.—  
You know, Sir, what calculations I had made relative to the probable course of events, on my retiring from Office, and the determination I had consoled myself with, of closing the remnant of my days in my present peaceful abode; you will therefore be at no loss to conceive and appreciate, the sensations I must have experienced, to bring my mind to any conclusion, that would pledge me, at so late a period of life, to leave scenes I sincerely love, to enter upon the boundless field of public action—incessant trouble—and high responsibility.—  
It was not possible for me to remain ignorant of, or indifferent to, recent transactions.—The conduct of the Directory of France towards our Country;—their insiduous hostility to its Government;—their various practices to withdraw the affections of the People from it;—the evident tendency of their acts and those of their Agents to countenance and invigorate opposition;—their disregard of solemn treaties and the laws of Nations;—their war upon our defenceless Commerce;—their treatment of our Ministers of Peace, and their demands amounting to tribute, could not fail to excite in me corresponding sentiments with those my countrymen have so generally expressed in their affectionate Addresses to you.—Believe me, Sir, no one can more cordially approve of the wise and prudent measures of your Administration.—They ought to inspire universal confidence, and will no doubt, combined with the state of things call from Congress such laws &amp; means as will enable you to meet the full force and extent of the Crisis.—  
Satisfied therefore; that you have sincerely wished and endeavoured to avert war, and exhausted to the last drop, the cup of reconciliation, we can with pure hearts appeal to Heaven for the justice of our cause, and may confidently trust the final result to that kind Providence who has heretofore, and so often, signally favoured the People of these United States.—  
Thinking in this manner, and feeling how incumbent it is upon every person, of every discription, to contribute at all times to his Countrys welfare, and especially in a moment like the present, when every thing we hold dear &amp; sacred is so seriously threatned, I have finally determined to accept the Commission of Commander in Chief of the Armies of the United States, with the reserve only, that I shall not be called into the field until the Army is in a situation to require my presence, or it becomes indispensible by the urgency of circumstances.  
In making this reservation, I beg it to be understood that I do not mean to withhold any assistance to arrange and organise the Army, which you may think I can afford.—I take the liberty also to mention, that I must decline having my acceptance considered as drawing after it any immediate charge upon the Public, or that I can receive any emoluments annexed to the appointment, before entering into a situation to incur expence.—  
The Secretary of War being anxious to return, to the Seat of Government, I have detained him no longer than was necessary to a full communication upon the several points he had in charge.  
With very great respect and consideration I have the honor to be / Dear Sir / Your Most Obedt. Hble Sert

Mount Vernon, 13th Fuly, 1798.  
  
Dear Sir,  
  
I HAD the honour on the even-  
mg of the 11th infant, to receive  
from the hand of the Secretary of  
war, your favour of the 7th, aunoun-  
cing that you had with the advice  
and confent of the Senate, appoint-  
ed me, Lieutegant-General and Com-  
mander in Chief of all the armies  
raifed or to be raifed for the fervice  
of the United States.  
  
I cannot exprefs how greatly af-  
fected I am at this new proof of pub-  
lic confidences and the highly flat-  
tering manner in which you have  
been pleafed to make the communi-  
cation; at the fame time I muft not  
conceal from you my earneft with  
that the choice had fallen upon a man  
lefs declined in years, and better  
qualified to encounter the ufual vi-  
ciflitudes of war.  
  
You know, Sir, what calculation I  
  
pees Si  
  
  
  
courfe of eveiits, on my rétiring from  
office, and the determination I had  
confoled myfelf with, of clofing the  
remnant of my days in my prefent  
peaceful abode ; you will therefore be  
at no lofs to cenceive and appreciate  
the fenfations I mult have experienc-  
ed, to bring my mind to any conclu-  
fion that would pledge me at fo late a  
period of life, to leave fcenes I fin.  
cerely love, to enter upon the bound-  
lefs field of public action, inceffant  
trouble, and high refponfibility.  
  
It was not poflible for me to re-  
main ignorant of, or indifferent to,  
recent tranfactions. The conduct of  
the Directory of France towards our  
country ; their infidious hoftility to  
its government ; their various prac-  
tices to withdraw the affections of  
the people from it ; the evident ten-  
dency of their acts and thofe of their  
agents tc countenance and invigorate  
oppofition ; their difregard of folemn  
treaties and the laws of nations ; their  
war upon our defencelefs commerce ;  
their treatment of our minifters of  
peace ; and their demands amounting  
to tribute ; could not fail to excite  
in me correfponding fentiments with  
thofe my countrymen have fo gene-  
rally expreffed in their affectionate  
addreffes to you. Believe me, Sir,  
no one can more cordially approve of  
the wife and prudent meaiures of your  
adminiftration. They ought to in-  
fpire univerfal confidence, and will,  
no doubt, combined with the ftate of  
things, call from Congrefs fuch laws  
and means as will enable you to meet  
the full force and extent of the crifis.  
  
Satished, therefore, that you have  
fincerely wifhed and endeavoured to  
avert war, and exhaufted, to the lait  
drop, the cup of reconciliation, we  
can with pure hearts appeal to Hea-  
ven for the jultice of our caufe ; and

you will not therefore be at a

boundless field of public action,

fponfibility. :  
It was not poflible for me  
to remain ignorant of, or in­  
different to,recent tranfaétions.  
The conduct of the Direflory of  
France towards our country ; their  
insidious hojtility to its government ;  
their various practices to withdraw  
the affections of the people from it ;  
the cvident tendency of their aéls,

their disregard of solemn treaties

awar upon our defencelefs commerce;

mounting to tribute ; could not

Satisfied, therefore,that you  
have sincerely withed and en­

exbaufled to the last drop the cup

and feeling how incumbent it  
is updn every person, of every

all times to his country’s wel­

only, that I {fhall not be called  
into the field until the army  
is in a situation to require my  
presence, or it becomes indis­

In making this reservation,  
I beg it to be understood, that  
I do not mean to withold any

I cannot express how greatly affected I am&quot;  
at this new proof of public confidence, and i  
the highly flattering manner in which you 1
