An Address of the Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, To their Honored and Illustrious Brother, GEORGE WASHINGTON.  
Boston December 27 A.D. 1792  
Whilst the Historian is describing the career of your glory, and the inhabitants of an extensive Empire are made happy in your unexampled exertions: Whilst some celebrate the Hero so distinguished in liberating United America; and others the Patriot, who presides over her Councils; a Band of Brothers having always joined the acclamations of their Countrymen, now testify their respect for those milder virtues which have ever graced the Man.  
Taught by the precepts of our Society, that all its Members stand upon a level, we venture to assume this station, and to approach you with that Freedom which diminishes our Diffidence without lessening our Respect.  
Desirous to enlarge the boundaries of Social happiness, and to vindicate the Ceremonies of their Institution, this Grand Lodge have published a “Book of Constitutions,” (&amp; a copy for your acceptance accompanies this;) which by discovering the principles  
  
that actuate, will speak the Eulogy of the Society; though they fervently wish the conduct of its Members, may prove its higher commendation.  
Convinced of his attachment to its cause, &amp; readiness to encourage its benevolent designs; they have taken the liberty to dedicate this work to one, the qualities of whose heart, and the actions of whose life have contributed to improve personal virtue, and extend throughout the World, the most endearing Cordialities: &amp; they humbly hope he will pardon this Freedom, and accept the tribute of their esteem and homage.  
May the Supreme Architect of the Universe protect and bless you, give you length of days, &amp; increase of Felicity in this World and then receive you to the harmonious and exalted Society in Heaven.

to their Brother George Washington— Transmitted  
by Brother James Somerville, EZ. S R. BE. FE, No.:  
212.  
  
Whilst the historian is describing the career of  
your glory, and the inhabitants of an extensive em-  
pire are made happy in your unexampled exertions;  
whilst some celebrate the hero so distinguished in  
liberating united America, and others the patriot  
who presides over her councils, a band of brothers,  
having always joined the acclamations of their  
countrymen, now testify their respect for those milder  
virtues which have ever graced the man.  
  
Taught by the precepts of our society, that all its  
members stand upon a level, we venture to assume  
this station, t6 approach yon with that.freedom which  
diminishes our diffidence without lessening our re-  
spect. Desirous to enlarge the boundaries of s cial  
happiness, and to vindicate the ceremonies of their  
Institution, this Grand Lodge bas published “A Book  
of Constitutions” (and a copy for your acceptance  
accompanies this), which, by discovering the princi-  
ples that actuate, will speak the eulogy of the Suciety,  
though they fervently wish the conduct of its mem-  
bers may prove its higher commendation. E  
  
Convinced of his attachment to its cause, and read-  
iness to encourage its benevulent designs, they have  
taken the liberty to dedicate this work to one, the  
qualities of whose heart and the actions of whose lips  
have contributed to improve personal virtue, and ex-  
tend throughout the world the most endearing cor-  
dialities; and they humbly hope he will pardon this  
freedom, and accept the tribute of their esteem and  
homage.  
  
May the Supreme Architeet of the Universe protect  
and bless you, give you length of days and increase  
of felicity in this world, and then receive you to the  
harmonious and exalted society in. heaven.
