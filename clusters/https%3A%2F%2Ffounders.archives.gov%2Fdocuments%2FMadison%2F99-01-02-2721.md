SAME, DATED  
  
Department of State,  
&quot;eb. 19, 1808.  
  
A vessel having been engaged  
to carry from the port of New  
York public dispatches and mer-  
cantile letters to Europe, I avail  
myself of the opportunity of for-  
warding you a series of gazettes,  
which contain the proceedings of  
congress, and such current in-  
formation as will give you a view  
of our internal affairs. They  
will be put, with this letter, into  
the hands of Mr. Nourse, a pas-  
sengerin the dispatch vessel, who  
will deliver them at London ; and  
as the vessel, which will have  
previously touched at L’Orient,  
will, after waiting ten or twelve  
days at Falmouth, return to that  
port, and thence to the United  
States, you will have an opportu-  
  
nity of sending thither any com-  
munications you may wish to  
make to Paris, as well as of trans-  
mitting to your government such  
as may follow up your correspond-  
ence, which, at the present pe-  
riod, will be the more acceptable,  
the more it be frequent and full.  
  
My last, which was committed  
to the British packet, inclosed a  
copy of the act of embargo, and  
explained the policy of the mea-  
sure. Among the considerations  
which enforced it, was the pro-  
bability of such decrees as were  
issued by the British government  
en the llth of November ; the  
language of the British gazettes,  
with other indications, having left  
little doubt that such were medi-  
tated. ‘The appearance of these  
decrees has had much effect in  
reconciling all descriptions among  
us to the embargo, and in fixing  
in the friends of the measure their  
attachment to its provident guar-  
dianship of our maritime inte-  
rests.  
  
Mr. Erskine communicated, a  
few days ago, the several late de-  
crees of his government, with  
expressions of the regret felt by  
his Britannic majesty at the ne-  
cessity imposed on him for such  
an interference with neutral com-  
merce, and assurances that his  
majesty would readily follow the  
example, in case the Berlin de-  
cree shouldbe rescinded, or would  
proceed, pari passu, with France,  
in relaxing the rigor of their  
measures. Mr. Erskine was ask-  
ed, whether his government dis-  
tinguished between the operation  
of the French decree, municipal-  
ly on land, and its operation on  
the high seas? On this point he  
was unable to answer ; as he also  
was to an inguiry, whether the-

late British decrees had reference  
to the late extension of the &#x27;rench  
decree with respect to the United  
States? He seemed also, as is  
perhaps the case with his go-  
vernment, to have taken very lit-  
tle into consideration the viola-  
tions of neutral commerce, and  
through them the vast injury to  
France antecedent to the Berlin  
decree. It is probable that some-  
thing further is to pass between  
us on this subject.

“ A vessel having been engaged to  
carry from the port of New York  
public dispatches and mercantile let­  
ters to Europe, I avail myself of the  
opportunity of forwarding you a se­  
ries of gazettes which contain the  
proceedings of Congress, and such  
current information as will give you a  
view of our internal affairs. They  
will he put with thin letter into the  
hands of Mr. Nour.se, a passenger in  
1 the dispatch vessel, who will deliver  
&gt; them at London ; and as the vessel.  
’ which will have previously touched at  
L’Orient, will, after waiting ten or  
twelve Jays at Falmouth, return to  
that port, and thence to the U. S. -von  
will have an opportunity of sending  
thither any communications you may  
I w ish to make to Paris, as well as ol  
&#x27; ransinitting to vonr government sue!  
1 a&#x27;- &lt;uay iollow up your correspondence  
  
which at the present period will be ihe  
more acceptable, the more it be fre­  
quent and full.”  
“ M&#x27; last, which was committed to  
the British packet, inclosed a copy of  
the act ot embargo, and explained&#x27; lie  
policy ol the measure. Among the  
considerations which enforced it was  
the probability ol such decrees as » i re  
issued by the British government on  
the llth November; the lauguage of  
the British gazettes, with other indi­  
cations, having left little doubt that  
such were meditated. T he appear­  
ance of these decrees has had much  
edect in reconciling all description*  
among us to the embargo, and in fix­  
*** th** friends ol ihe measure,  
their attachment to its provident  
guardianship ol our maritime inter­  
ests.”  
** Mr. hrskine communicated a few  
days ago the several late decrees  
his government, with expressions of  
thr legiet leit by hi* Britannic majes­  
ty at ihe necessity imposed on b in  
lor such an interference with neutral  
commerce, and assurances that his  
(»ii.jf tv would readily follow the ex­  
ample, in case the Berlin decree should  
he rescinded, or would proceed, p iri  
msvu with France, in icUxing ihe ri­

whether the late British decrees had  
  
rcrert-nce «o the late e.M mien of the
