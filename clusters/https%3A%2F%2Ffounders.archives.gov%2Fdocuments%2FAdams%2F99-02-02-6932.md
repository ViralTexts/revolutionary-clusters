position Eleventh “That New England is the most prejudicial Plantation to this Kingdom.”  
“I am now to write of a people whose frugality, industry, and temperance, and the happiness of whose laws and institutions do promise to themselves long life, with a wonderful increase of people, riches and power: and although no man men ought to envy that virtue and wisdom in others which themselves either can or will not practise, but rather to commend and admire it, yet I think it the duty of every good man primarily to respect the welfare of his native country; and therefore though I may offend some whom I would not willingly displease, I cannot omit, in the progress of this discourse to take notice of some particulars, wherein Old England suffers diminution by the growth of those colonies settled in New England and how that plantation differs from those more southerly, with respect to the gain or loss of this Kingdom, viz.  
All our American plantations, except that of New England produce commodities of different natures from those of this kingdom, as Sugar, tobacco cocoa, wool, ginger, sundry sorts of dying woods, &amp;c Whereas New England produces generally the same we have here viz. corn and cattle: some quantity of fish they do likewise kill, but that is taken and saved altogether by their own inhabitants, which prejudiceth our New foundland trade; whereas hath been said very few are or ought according to prudence to be, employed in those fisheries but the inhabitants of Old-England. The other commodities we have from them are some few great masts, furs, and train oil, whereof the yearly value amounts to very little the much greater value of returns from thence being made in sugar, cotton, wool, tobacco, and such like commodities, which they first receive from some other of his Majesty’s plantations in barter for dry cod fish, salt machrel, beef, pork, bread, beer, flour, Peas, &amp;c which they supply Barbadoes, Jamaica &amp;c, with, to the diminution of the vent of those commodities from this kingdom; the great expence whereof in our West-India plantations would soon be found in the advance of the value of our lands in England, were it not for the vast and almost incredible supplies those colonies have from New England.  
2. The people of New England, by Virtue of their primitive Charters, being not So Strictly tied to the Observation of the Laws of New Engla this Kingdom, do Sometimes assume a Liberty of trading, contrary to the Act of Navigation, by reason whereof many of our American Commodities, especially Tobacco and Sugar, are transported transported, in New England Shipping directly, into Spain and other foreign Countries, without being landed in England, or paying any duty to his Majesty, which is not only Loss to the King, and a prejudice to the navigation of Old England but also a total Exclusion of the Old English Merchants from the vent of those Commodities in those Ports where the New English Merchants vessels trade; because there being no Custom paid on those Commodities in New England, and a great Custom paid upon them in Old England it must necessarily follow that the New English Merchant will be able to afford his Commodities much cheaper at the Market, than the Old English Merchant: And those that can Sell cheapest, will infallibly engross the whole trade, Sooner or later.  
3. Of all his Majesty’s Plantations the American Plantations, his Majesty hath none, So apt for the building of Shipping as New England, nor none So comparably So qualified for breeding of Seamen not only by reason of the natural Industry of that People, but principally by reason of their Cod and Mackrel Fisheries: and in my poor opinion, there is nothing more prejudicial and in prospect more dangerous to any Mother Country Kingdom than the increase of Shipping in her Colonies Plantations and Provinces.  
4th The people that evacuate from us to Barbadoes, and the other West-India plantations, as was hinted, do commonly work one Englishman to ten blacks; and if we kept the trade of our said plantation entirely to England, England would have no less inhabitants, but rather an increase of people by such evacution; because that one Englishman, with the ten Blacks that work with him, accounting what they eat, use, and wear, would make employment for four men in England, as was said before; whereas, peradventure, often men that issue from us to New-England.—  
To conclude this Chapter, and to do right to that most industrious English colony; I must confess, that though we lose by their unlimited trade with our foreign plantations, yet we are very great gainers by their direct trade to and from Old England: our yearly exportations of English manufactures, malt, and other goods, from hence thither, amounting in my opinion to ten times the value of what is imported from thence; which calculation I do not make at random, but upon mature consideration, and peradventure upon as much experience in this very Trade as any other person will pretend to: and therefore, whenever a reformation of our correspondency in Trade with that people shall be thought on, it will, in my poor judgement require great tenderness and very serious circumspection.”

is the moft prejudicial plantation to this kingdom. I am now to write  
  
of a people whofe frugality, induftry, and temperance, and the happinefs  
  
of whofe laws and inititution promife to them long life, with a wonderful  
  
increafe of people, riches, and power: and although no men ought ta  
  
envy that virtue and wifdom in others, which themfelves either can  
  
or will not praétife, but rather toCommend and admire it, yet I think  
  
it is the duty of every good man primarily to refpect the welfare of

fuffers diminution by the growth of thofe colonies fettled in New  
  
England.” (And then, after fome very fenfible obfervations on the  
  
productions of our colonies, he proceeds:) ** The people of New  
  
England, by virtue of their primitive charters, being not fo ftrictly  
  
tied to the obfervation of the laws of this kingdom, do fometimes  
  
affume the liberty of trading contrary to the aét of navigation, by rea-

¢o the King, and a prejudice to the navigation of Old England, but  
  
alfo a total exclufion of the Old Englith merchant from the vent of

becaufe their being no cuftom on thofe commodities in New England,

tion differs from thoſe more Southerly, with Reſpect to  
  
the Gain or Loſs of this Kingdom, vx.  
1. All our American Plantations, except that of Nes  
Fanta produce Commodities of different Natures  
  
  
Wool, Ginger, ſundry Sorts of dying Wood, &amp;c.  
Whereas New England produces generally the ſame we  
have here, viz. _ and Cattle; ſome Quantity of  
Fiſh they do likewiſe kill, but that is taken and ſaved al-  
together by their own Inhabitants, which prejudiceth  
our Newfoundland Trade, where, as hath been faid,  
very few are, or ought, according to Prudence, to be  
  
employed in thoſe Fiſheries, but the Inhabitants of Old  
England. Eo Wo ood Þ  
The other Commodities we have from them, are ſome  
few great Maſts, Furs, and Train-Oil, whereof the  
yearly Value amounts to very little, the much greater  
Yau of Returns from thence being made in Sugar,  
Cotton, Wool, Tobacco, and ſuch like Commodities  
which they firſt receive from ſome other of his Majeſ-  
ty&#x27;s Plantations, in Barter for dry Cod-Fiſh, Salt, Macka-  
rel, Beef, Pork, Bread, Beer, Flour, Peaſe, Wc. which  
they ſupply Barbadees, Pau &amp;c. with, to the  
Diminution of the Vent of thoſe Commodities from this  
Kingdom ; the great Experience whereof in our He.  
India Plantations would ſoon be found in the Advan«  
tage of the Value of our Lands in England, were it not  
for the vaſt and almoſt incredible Supplies thoſe Colo-

Tn B 3 2. The  
  
2. The People of New England, by Virtue of their  
primitive Charters, being ſo ſtrictly tied to the Obſer«  
vations of the Laws of this Kingdom, do ſometimes aſ-  
ſume a Liberty of Trading, contrary to the Ad of Na-  
vigation, by Reaſon whereof many of our American  
Commodities, eſpecially Tobacco and Sugar, are tran-  
ſported in New Engliſh Shipping, directly into Spain,  
and other foreign Countries, without being landed in  
England, or paying &quot;= Duty to his Majeſty, which is  
not only Loſs to the King, and a Prejudice to the Na-  
vigation of -Q/d4 England, but alſo a total Excluſion of  
the O/d Enelifh Merchant from the Vent of thoſe Com-  
 modities in thoſe Ports, where the New Engliſh Veſſels  
trade; becauſe, there being no Cuſtom paid on thoſe  
Commodities in New England, and a great Cuſtom paid  
upon them in O/d England, it muſt neceſſarily follow that  
the New Engliſh Merchant will be able to afford hig  
Commodity much cheaper at the Market, than the Old  
Engliſh Merchant: And thoſe that can ſell cheapeſt,  
will infallibly engroſs the whole Trade ſooner or later:  
_ 3. Of all the American Plantations, his Majeſty hath  
none ſo apt for the Building of Shipping as New Eng.  
land, nor none-ſo comparably qualified for breeding of  
Seamen, not only by Reaſon of the natural Induſtry of  
that ple, but principally by Reaſon of their Cod and  
Mackere! Fiſheries: And, in my poor Opinion, here  
is nothing more prejudicial, and in Proſpect more dan-  
erous to any Mother 1 than the Increaſe of  
hipping in their Colonies, Plantations, or Provinces.  
4. The People that evacuate from us to Barbadoes  
and the other Ve India Plantations, as was before hint-

encouraged as in America ; but it should be remembered that the  
relative positions of old and new countries are essentially  
different. All commence their industrial career as agriculturists,  
and gradually become manufacturers, while they who dwell on  
the sea coast devote themselves to navigation. While America  
was a colony we have seen what constant and unjust efforts  
were.made by England to crush its rising manufactures. Its  
ay in naval architecture was resisted with equal jealousy.
