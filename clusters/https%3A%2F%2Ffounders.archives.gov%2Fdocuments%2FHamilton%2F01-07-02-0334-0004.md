[To the Speaker of the House of Representatives]  
The Secretary of the Treasury having attentively considered the subject referred to him by the Order of the House of Representatives of the fifteenth day of April last, relatively to the establishment of a Mint most respectfully submits the result of his enquiries and reflections.  
A plan for an establishment of this nature involves a great variety of considerations, intricate, nice, and important. The general state of Debtor and Creditor; all the relations and consequences of price; the essential interests of trade and industry; the value of all property; the whole income both of the State and of individuals are liable to be sensibly influenced, beneficially, or otherwise, by the judicious, or injudicious regulation of this interesting object. It is one likewise, not more necessary, than difficult to be rightly adjusted; one which has frequently occupied the reflections and researches of politicians, without having harmonised their opinions on some of the most important of the principles, which enter into its discussion. Accordingly, different systems continue to be advocated, and the systems of different Nations, after much investigation, continue to differ from each other.  
But if a right adjustment of the matter be truly of such nicety and difficulty, a question naturally arises, whether it may not be most advisable to leave things, in this respect, in the state in which they are. Why might it be asked, since they have so long proceeded in a train, which has caused no general sensation of inconvenience, should alterations be attempted, the precise effect of which cannot with certainty be calculated?  
  
The answer to this question is not perplexing. The immense disorder, which actually reigns in so delicate and important a concern, and the still greater disorder, which is every moment possible, call loudly for a reform. The dollar, originally contemplated in the money transactions of this country, by successive diminutions of its weight and fineness, has sustained a depreciation of 5 ⅌. Cent. And yet the new dollar has a Currency in all payments in place of the Old, with scarcely any attention to the difference between them. The operation of this in depreciating the value of property, depending upon past Contracts; and (as far as inattention to the alteration in the Coin may be supposed to leave prices stationary) of all other property, is apparent. Nor can it require argument to prove, that a Nation ought not to suffer the value of the property of its Citizens to fluctuate with the fluctuations of a foreign Mint, and to change with the changes in the regulations of a foreign sovereign. This, nevertheless, is the condition of one, which having no Coins of its own, adopts with implicit confidence those of other Countries.  
The unequal values allowed in different parts of the Union to coins of the same intrinsic worth; the defective species of them, which embarrass the circulation of some of the States; and the dissimularity in their several Monies of account, are inconveniencies, which if not to be ascribed to the want of a National Coinage, will at least be most effectually remedied by the establishment of one; a measure that will at the same time give additional security against impositions, by counterfeit as well as by base currencies.  
It was with great reason, therefore, that the attention of Congress, under the late confederation, was repeatedly drawn to the establishment of a Mint; and it is with equal reason, that the subject has been resumed; now that the favorable change, which has taken place in the situation of public affairs, admits of its being carried into execution.  
But though the difficulty of devising a proper establishment ought not to deter from undertaking so necessary a work; yet it cannot but inspire diffidence in one, whose duty it is made, to propose a plan for the purpose, and may perhaps be permitted to be relied upon as some excuse for any errors which may be chargeable upon it, or for any deviations from sounder principles, which may have been suggested by others, or even in part acted upon by the former Government of the United States.  
In order to a right judgment of what ought to be done, the following particulars require to be discussed.  
1st.—What ought to be the nature of the money unit of the United States?  
2ndly.—What the proportion between gold and silver; if coins of both metals are to be established?  
3dly.—What the proportion and composition of alloy in each kind?  
4thly.—Whether the expence of coinage shall be defrayed by the Government, or out of the material itself?  
5thly.—What shall be the number, denominations, sizes, and devices of the Coins?  
6thly.—Whether foreign Coins shall be permitted to be current or not; if the former, at what rate and for what period?  
A prerequisite to determining, with propriety, what ought to be the money unit of the United States, is to endeavour to form as accurate an idea, as the nature of the case will admit of what it actually is. The pound, though of various value, is the unit in the money of account of all the States. But it is not equally easy to pronounce what is to be considered as the unit in the Coins. There being no formal regulation on the point (the resolutions of Congress of the 6th. of July 1785 and 8th. of August 1786, having never yet been carried into operation) it can only be inferred from usage or practice. The manner of adjusting foreign exchanges would seem to indicate the Dollar as best entitled to that Character. In these the old piastre of Spain; or Old Seville piece of eight Rials of the value of four shillings and sixpence sterling is evidently contemplated. The computed par between Great Britain and Pennsylvania, will serve as an Example. According to that, One hundred pounds sterling is equal to One hundred and sixty six pounds and two thirds of a pound Pennsylvania Currency; which corresponds with the proportion between 4/6 sterling and 7/6 the current value of the dollar in that State, by invariable usage. And as far as the information of the Secretary goes, the same comparison holds in the other States.  
But this circumstance, in favour of the dollar, loses much of its weight from two considerations. That species of coin has never had any settled or standard value, according to weight or fineness, but has been permitted to circulate by tale, without regard to either; very much as a mere money of convenience; while gold has had a fixed price by weight and with an eye to its fineness. The greater stability of value of the Gold Coins is an argument of force for regarding the money unit as having been hitherto virtually attached to Gold rather than to silver.  
Twenty four grains and ⁶⁄₈ of a Grain of fine gold have corresponded with the nominal value of the dollar in the several States; without regard to the successive diminutions of its intrinsic worth.  
But if the dollar should, notwithstanding, be supposed to have the best title to being considered as the present unit in the coins, it would remain to determine what kind of dollar ought to be understood, or, in other words, what precise quantity of fine silver.  
The old piastre of Spain, which appears to have regulated our foreign exchanges, weighed 17 dwt. 12 grains and contained 386. grains and 15 Mites of fine silver. But this piece has been long since out of circulation. The dollars now in common currency are of recent date, and much inferior to that both in weight and fineness. The average weight of them, upon different trials in large Masses, has been found to be 17 dwt. 8 grains. Their fineness is less precisely ascertained; the results of various assays made by different persons, under the direction of the late Superintendent of the Finances and of the Secretary, being as various as the assays themselves. The difference between their extremes is not less than 24 grains in a dollar, of the same weight and age; which is too much for any probable differences in the pieces. It is rather to be presumed that a degree of inaccuracy has been occasioned, by the want of proper apparatus and in general, of practice. The experiment which appears to have the best pretensions to exactness, would make the new dollar to contain 370 grains and 933 thousandth parts of a grain of pure silver.  
According to an authority, on which the Secretary places reliance, the standard of Spain for its silver Coin in the year 1761. was 261 parts fine and 27 parts alloy; at which proportion, a dollar of 17 dwts. 8 grains would consist of 377 grains of fine silver and 39 grains of alloy: But there is no question that this standard has been since altered considerably for the worse; to what precise point is not as well ascertained as could be wished; but from a computation of the value of dollars in the Markets both of Amsterdam and London (a criterion which cannot materially mislead) the new dollar appears to contain about 368 grains of fine silver and that which immediately preceded it about 374 grains.  
In this state of things, there is some difficulty in defining the dollar, which is to be understood as constituting the present money Unit; on the supposition of its being most applicable to that species of Coin. The old Seville piece of 386. grains and 15 Mites fine, comports best with the computations of foreign exchanges, and with the more ancient contracts respecting landed property; but far the greater number of Contracts, still in operation concerning that kind of property, and all those of a merely personal nature, now in force, must be referred to a dollar of a different kind. The actual dollar at the time of contracting is the only one which can be supposed to have been intended, and it has been seen, that as long ago as the year 1761. there had been a material degradation of the standard. And even in regard to the more ancient contracts, no person has ever had any idea of a scruple about receiving the dollar of the day, as a full equivalent for the nominal sum, which the dollar originally imported.  
A recurrence therefore to the ancient Dollar would be in the greatest number of cases an innovation in fact, and in all, an innovation in respect to opinion. The actual dollar, in common circulation, has evidently a much better claim to be regarded as the actual money unit.  
The mean intrinsic value of the different kinds of known dollars has been intimated as affording the proper criterion. But when it is recollected, that the more ancient and more valuable ones are not now to be met with at all in circulation, and that the mass of those generally current is composed of the newest and most inferior kinds, it will be perceived, that even an equation of that nature would be a considerable innovation upon the real present state of things; which it will certainly be prudent to approach, as far as may be consistent with the permanent order, designed to be introduced.  
An additional reason for considering the prevailing dollar, as the standard of the present money unit, rather than the ancient one, is, that it will not only be conformable to the true existing proportion between the two Metals in this Country, but will be more conformable to that which obtains in the commercial world, generally.  
The difference established by custom in the United States between coined Gold and coined Silver, has been stated upon another occasion, to be nearly as 1 to 15.6. This, if truly the case, would imply that Gold was extremely overvalued in the United States; for the highest actual proportion in any part of Europe very little, if at all, exceeds 1 to 15. and the average proportion throughout Europe is probably not more than 1 to 14⅘. But that statement has proceeded upon the idea of the ancient dollar. One pennyweight of Gold of 22 Carrats fine at 6/8 and the old Seville piece of 386 grains and 15 mites of pure silver at 7/6 furnish the exact ratio of 1. to 15.6262. But this does not coincide with the real difference between the Metals, in our market, or, which is with us the same thing, in our currency. To determine this, the quantity of fine silver in the general Mass of the dollars now in circulation must afford the rule. Taking the rate of the late dollar of 374 Grains, the proportion would be as 1 to 15.11. Taking the rate of the newest dollar, the proportion would then be as 1 to 14.87. The mean of the two would give the proportion of 1 to 15 very nearly; less than the legal proportion in the coins of Great Britain, which is as 1 to 15.2; but somewhat more than the actual or market proportion which is not quite 1. to 15.  
The preceding view of the subject does not indeed afford a precise or certain definition of the present unit, in the coins, but it furnishes data, which will serve as guides in the progress of the investigation. It ascertains at least, that the sum in the money of account of each State corresponding with the nominal value of the dollar in such state corresponds also with 24 Grains and ⁶⁄₈ of a grain of fine gold, and with something between 368 and 374 Grains of fine silver.  
The next enquiry towards a right determination of what ought to be the future money unit of the United States turns upon these questions. Whether it ought to be peculiarly attached to either of the Metals, in preference to the other, or not; and, if to either, to which of them?  
The suggestions and proceedings hitherto have had for object the annexing of it emphatically to the silver dollar. A resolution of Congress of the 6th. of July 1785 declares that the money unit of the United States shall be a Dollar; and another resolution of the 8th. of August 1786, fixes that dollar at 375 Grains and 64 hundredths of a grain of fine silver. The same resolution, however, determines, that there shall also be two Gold Coins one of 246 grains and 268 parts of a grain of pure Gold, equal to ten dollars, and the other of half that quantity of pure Gold, equal to five dollars: and it is not explained, whether either of the two species of Coins, of Gold or Silver, shall have any greater legality in payments, than the other. Yet it would seem, that a preference in this particular is necessary to execute the idea of attaching the unit exclusively to one kind. If each of them be as valid as the other, in payments to any amount, it is not obvious, in what effectual sense, either of them can be deemed the money unit, rather than the other.  
If the general declaration, that the dollar shall be the money unit of the United States could be understood to give it a superior legality in payments, the institution of Coins of Gold, and the declaration that each of them shall be equal to a certain number of dollars would appear to destroy that inference: And the circumstance of making the dollar the unit in the money of account seems to be rather matter of form, than of substance.  
Contrary to the ideas, which have heretofore prevailed, in the suggestions concerning a Coinage for the United States, though not without much hesitation, arising from a deference for those ideas, The Secretary is upon the whole strongly inclined to the Opinion, that a preference ought to be given to neither of the Metals for the money unit: Perhaps if either were to be preferred, it ought to be Gold rather than silver.  
The reasons are these. The inducement to such a preference is to render the unit as little variable as possible; because on this depends the steady value of all contracts, and in a certain sense of all other property. And it is truly observed, that if the unit belong indiscriminately to both the Metals, it is subject to all the fluctuations, that happen in the relative value, which they bear to each other: But the same reason would lead to annexing it to that particular one, which is itself the least liable to variation; if there be, in this respect any discernible difference between the two.  
Gold may perhaps, in certain senses, be said to have greater stability than silver: As being of superior value, less liberties have been taken with it, in the Regulations of different countries. Its standard has remained more uniform, and it has in other respects undergone fewer changes: As being not so much an article of Merchandize, owing to the use made of silver in the trade with the East Indies and China, it is less liable to be influenced by circumstances of Commercial demand. And if reasoning by analogy, it could be affirmed, that there is a physical probability of greater proportional increase in the quantity of silver than in that of Gold, it would afford an additional reason for calculating on greater steadiness in the value of the latter.  
As long as Gold, either from its intrinsic superiority, as a Metal, from its greater rarity, or from the prejudices of mankind, retains so considerable a preeminence in value over silver as it has hitherto had, a natural consequence of this seems to be that its condition will be more stationary. The revolutions, therefore, which may take place, in the comparative value of gold and silver, will be changes in the state of the latter, rather than in that of the former.  
If there should be an appearance of too much abstraction in any of these ideas, it may be remarked, that the first and most simple impressions do not naturally incline to giving a preference to the inferior or least valuable of the two Metals.  
It is sometimes observed, that silver ought to be encouraged rather than Gold, as being more conducive to the extention of Bank circulation, from the greater difficulty and inconvenience, which its greater bulk, compared with its value, occasions in the Transportation of it. But Bank circulation is desireable rather as an auxiliary to, than as a substitute for that of the precious metals; and ought to be left to its natural course. Artificial expedients to extend it, by opposing obstacles to the other, are at least not recommended by any very obvious advantages. And in general, it is the safest rule to regulate every particular institution, or object, according to the principles, which in relation to itself, appear the most sound. In addition to this, it may be observed, that the inconvenience of transporting either of the metals is sufficiently great to induce a preference of Bank paper, whenever it can be made to answer the purpose equally well.  
But upon the whole, it seems to be most adviseable, as has been observed, not to attach the unit exclusively to either of the Metals; because this cannot be done effectually without destroying the office and character of one of them as money, and reducing it to the situation of a mere merchandize; which, accordingly, at different times has been proposed from different and very respectable quarters; but which would probably be a greater evil than occasional variations in the unit, from the fluctuations in the relative value of the metals; especially if care be taken to regulate the proportion between them, with an eye to their average commercial value.  
To annul the use of either of the metals, as money, is to abridge the quantity of circulating medium; and is liable to all the objections, which arise from a comparison of the benefits of a full, with the evils of a scanty circulation.  
It is not a satisfactory answer to say, that none but the favored metal would in this case find its way into the Country, as in that all balances must be paid. The practicability of this would in some measure depend on the abundance, or scarcity of it in the Country paying. Where there was but little, it either would not be procurable at all, or it would cost a premium to obtain it; which in every case of a competition with others, in a branch of trade, would constitute a deduction from the profits of the party receiving. Perhaps too the embarrassments, which such a circumstance might sometimes create, in the pecuniary liquidation of balances, might lead to additional efforts to find a substitute in commodities, and might so far impede the introduction of the metals. Neither could the exclusion of either of them be deemed, in other respects, favorable to commerce. It is often in the course of trade as desireable to possess the kind of money, as the kind of commodities, best adapted to a foreign market.  
It seems, however, most probable, that the chief, if not the sole effect of such a regulation, would be to diminish the utility of one of the metals. It could hardly prove an obstacle to the introduction, of that which was excluded, in the natural course of Trade; because it would always command a ready sale for the purpose of exportation to foreign markets. But such an effect, if the only one, is not to be regarded as a trivial inconvenience.  
If then the unit ought not to be attached exclusively to either of the metals, the proportion which ought to subsist between them, in the coins, becomes a preliminary inquiry, in order to its proper adjustment. This proportion appears to be, in several views, of no inconsiderable moment.  
One consequence of overvaluing either metal, in respect to the other, is the banishment of that which is undervalued. If two countries are supposed, in one of which the proportion of Gold to silver is as 1. to 16. in the other as 1. to 15. gold being worth more, silver less in one, than in the other, it is manifest, that in their reciprocal payments, each will select that species, which it values least, to pay to the other, where it is valued most. Besides this, the dealers in money will, from the same cause, often find a profitable traffic, in an exchange of the Metals between the two Countries. And hence, it would come to pass, if other things were equal, that the greatest part of the Gold would be collected in one, and the greatest part of the silver, in the other. The course of Trade might in some degree counteract the tendency of the difference, in the legal proportions, by the market value; but this is so far and so often influenced by the legal rates, that it does not prevent their producing the effect, which is inferred. Facts too verify the inference. In Spain and England where gold is rated higher, than in other parts of Europe, there is a scarcity of silver; while it is found to abound in France, and Holland, where it is rated higher in proportion to gold, than in the Neighbouring Nations. And it is continually flowing from Europe to China and the East Indies, owing to the comparative cheapness of it in the former, and dearness of it in the latter.  
This consequence is deemed by some not very material; and there are even persons, who from a fanciful predilection to Gold, are willing to invite it, even by a higher price. But general utility will best be promoted by a due proportion of both metals. If gold be most convenient in large payments, silver is best adapted to the more minute and ordinary circulation.  
But it is to be suspected, that there is another consequence more serious, than the one which has been mentioned. This is the diminution of the total quantity of specie, which a Country would naturally possess.  
It is evident, that as often as a Country, which overrates either of the Metals, receives a payment in that Metal, it gets a less actual quantity than it ought to do, or than it would do, if the rate were a just one.  
It is also equally evident, that there will be a continual effort to make payment to it in that species, to which it has annexed an exaggerated estimation, wherever it is current at a less proportional value. And it would seem to be a very natural effect of these two causes, not only that the mass of the precious metals in the country, in question, would consist chiefly of that kind, to which it had given an extraordinary value, but that it would be absolutely less, than if they had been duly proportioned to each other.  
A conclusion of this sort, however, is to be drawn with great caution. In such matters, there are always some local and many other particular circumstances, which qualify and vary the operation of general principles, even where they are just; and there are endless combinations, very difficult to be annalized, which often render principles, that have the most plausible pretensions unsound and delusive.  
There ought, for instance, according to those which have been stated, to have been formerly a greater quantity of Gold in proportion to silver in the United States, than there has been; because the actual value of Gold in this country compared with silver was perhaps higher than in any other. But our situation with regard to the West India Islands, into some of which there is a large influx of silver directly from the Mines of South America, occasions an extraordinary supply of that Metal, and consequently a greater proportion of it in our circulation than might have been expected from its relative value.  
What influence the proportion under consideration may have upon the state of prices, and how far this may counteract its tendency to increase or lessen the quantity of the Metals are points not easy to be developed; And yet they are very necessary to an accurate judgment of the true operation of the thing.  
But however impossible it may be, to pronounce with certainty, that the possession of a less quantity of Specie is a consequence of overvaluing either of the Metals, there is enough of probability in the considerations, which seem to indicate it, to form an Argument of weight against such overvaluation.  
A third ill consequence resulting from it is, a greater and more frequent disturbance of the state of the money unit, by a greater and more frequent diversity between the legal and market proportions of the Metals. This has not hitherto been experienced in the United States, but it has been experienced elsewhere: And from its not having been felt by us hitherto, it does not follow that this will not be the case hereafter, when our Commerce shall have attained a maturity, which will place it under the influence of more fixed principles.  
In establishing a proportion between the Metals, there seems to be an option of one of two things.  
To approach as nearly as it can be ascertained, the mean or average proportion, in what may be called the Commercial world, Or  
To retain that which now exists in the United States: As far as these happen to coincide, they will render the course to be pursued more plain and more certain.  
To ascertain the first, with precision, would require better materials, than are possessed, or than could be obtained, without an inconvenient delay.  
Sir Isaac Newton, in a representation to the Treasury of Great Britain, in the year 1717, after stating the particular proportions in the different countries of Europe concludes thus—“by the course of trade and exchange between nation, and nation in all Europe, fine gold is to fine silver as 14 4/5 or 15 to 1.”  
But however accurate and decisive this authority may be deemed, in relation to the period, to which it applies, it cannot be taken, at the distance of more than seventy years, as a rule for determining the existing proportion. Alterations have been since made, in the regulations of their coins by several Nations; which as well as the course of trade have an influence upon the Market values. Nevertheless, there is reason to believe, that the State of the matter, as represented by Sir Isaac Newton, is not very remote from its actual state.  
In Holland the greatest money market of Europe, gold was to silver in December 1789 as 1 to 14.88; and in that of London it has been for some time past but little different, approaching perhaps something nearer 1 to 15.  
It has been seen, that the existing proportion between the two metals in this Country is about as 1 to 15.  
It is fortunate, in this respect, that the innovations of the Spanish Mint have imperceptibly introduced a proportion so analogous, as this is, to that which prevails among the principal commercial nations; as it greatly facilitates a proper regulation of the matter.  
This proportion of 1 to 15 is recommended by the particular situation of our trade, as being very nearly that which obtains in the market of Great Britain, to which Nation our Specie is principally exported. A lower rate for either of the Metals, in our Market, than in hers, might not only afford a motive the more in certain cases to remit in specie rather than in commodities, but it might in some others, cause us to pay a greater quantity of it for a given sum, than we should otherwise do. If the effect should rather be to occasion a premium to be given for the Metal, which was underrated, this would obviate those disadvantages; but it would involve another, a customary difference between the Market and legal proportions, which would amount to a species of disorder in the natural coinage.  
Looking forward to the payments of Interest hereafter to be made to Holland, the same proportion does not appear ineligible. The present legal proportion in the coins of Holland is stated to be 1 to 14⁹⁄₁₀. That of the Market varies somewhat at different times, but seldom very widely from this point.  
There can hardly be a better rule, in any country, for the legal, than the market proportion; if this can be supposed to have been produced by the free and steady course of commercial principles. The presumption, in such case, is that each metal finds its true level, according to its intrinsic utility, in the general system of money operations.  
But it must be admitted, that this argument in favour of continuing the existing proportion, is not applicable to the state of the coins with us. There have been too many artificial and heterogeneous ingredients, too much want of order in the pecuniary transactions of this Country, to authorise the attributing the effects, which have appeared, to the regular operations of Commerce. A proof of this is to be drawn from the alterations, which have happened in the proportion between the metals merely by the successive degradations of the dollar, in consequence of the mutability of a foreign Mint. The value of gold to silver appears to have declined, wholly from this cause, from 15⁶⁄₁₀ to about 15 to 1. Yet as this last proportion, however produced, coincides so nearly with what may be deemed the commercial average, it may be supposed to furnish as good a rule as can be pursued.  
The only question seems to be, whether the value of Gold ought not to be a little lowered to bring it to a more exact level with the two markets which have been mentioned. But as the ratio of 1 to 15 is so nearly conformable to the state of those markets, and best agrees with that of our own, it will probably be found the most eligible. If the market of Spain continues to give a higher value to Gold (as it has done in time past) than that which is recommended, there may be some advantage in a middle station.  
A further preliminary to the adjustment of the future money unit is to determine what shall be the proportion and composition of alloy in each species of the Coins.  
The first, by the resolution of the 8th. of August 1786, before referred to, is regulated at one twelfth, or in other words, at one part alloy to 11 parts fine, whether Gold or Silver: which appears to be a convenient rule; unless there should be some collateral consideration, which may dictate a departure from it. Its correspondency, in regard to both metals, is a recommendation of it, because a difference could answer no purpose of pecuniary or commercial utility, and uniformity is favorable to order.  
This ratio, as it regards gold, coincides with the proportion, real or professed, in the Coins of Portugal, England, France and Spain. In those of the two former, it is real, in those of the two latter, there is a deduction for what is called remedy of weight and alloy, which is in the nature of an allowance to the Master of the Mint for errors and imperfections in the process; rendering the coin either lighter or baser than it ought to be. The same thing is known in the Theory of the English Mint, where 1/6 of a Carat is allowed. But the difference seems to be, that there, it is merely an occasional indemnity within a certain limit, for real and unavoidable errors and imperfections; whereas in the practice of the Mints of France and Spain it appears to amount to a stated and regular deviation from the nominal standard. Accordingly the real standards of France and Spain are something worse than 22 Carats or 11 parts in 12. fine.  
The principal Gold coins of Germany, Holland, Sweden, Denmark, Poland and Italy, are finer than those of England and Portugal in different degrees from 1 Carat and ¼ to 1 Carat and ⅞, which last is within ⅛ of a Carat of pure Gold.  
There are similar diversities in the standards of the silver coins of the different Countries of Europe. That of Great Britain is 222 parts fine to 18 alloy: Those of the other European Nations vary from that of Great Britain as widely as from about 17 of the same parts better to 75 worse.  
The principal reasons assigned for the use of alloy, are the saving of expence in the refining of the metals, (which in their natural state are usually mixed with a portion of the coarser kinds) and the rendering of them harder as a security against too great waste by friction or wearing. The first reason, drawn from the original composition of the Metals, is strengthened at present by the practice of alloying their coins, which has obtained among so many Nations. The reality of the effect, to which the last reason is applicable, has been denied, and experience has been appealed to as proving that the more alloyed coins wear faster than the purer. The true state of this matter may be worthy of future investigation, though first appearances are in favour of alloy. In the meantime, the saving of trouble and expence are sufficient inducements to following those examples which suppose its expediency. And the same considerations lead to taking as our models those nations with whom we have most intercourse, and whose coins are most prevalent in our circulation. These are Spain, Portugal, England and France. The relation which the proposed proportion bears to their Gold Coins has been explained. In respect to their silver coins, it will not be very remote from the mean of their several standards.  
The component ingredients of the alloy in each Metal will also require to be regulated. In silver, Copper is the only kind in use, and it is doubtless the only proper one. In Gold there is a mixture of silver and copper; in the English coins consisting of equal parts, in the coins of some other Countries varying from ⅓ to ⅔ Silver.  
The reason of this union of Silver with Copper is this—the silver counteracts the Tendency of the Copper to injure the Color or Beauty of the Coin, by giving it too much redness, or rather a Coppery hue; which a small quantity will produce; and the Copper prevents the too great whiteness, which silver alone would confer. It is apprehended, that there are considerations, which may render it prudent to establish by law, that the proportion of Silver to Copper in the Gold Coins of the United States shall not be more than ½ nor less than ⅓; vesting a discretion, in some proper place, to regulate the matter within those limits, as experience in the execution may recommend.  
A third point remains to be discussed, as a prerequisite to the determination of the money unit, which is, whether the expence of coining shall be defrayed by the public, or out of the material itself; or, as it is sometimes stated, whether coinage shall be free or shall be subject to a duty or imposition? This forms, perhaps, one of the nicest questions in the doctrine of Money.  
The practice of different Nations is dissimilar, in this particular. In England coinage is said to be intirely free: the Mint price of the Metals in bullion being the same with the value of them in coin. In France, there is a duty which has been, if it is not now, Eight per Cent. In Holland, there is a difference between the Mint price and the value in the Coins, which has been computed at .96, or something less than one per Cent, upon Gold; at 1.48 or something less than one and a half per Cent; upon silver. The resolution, of the 8th. of August 1786, proceeds upon the idea of a deduction of half perCent from Gold, and of two perCent from silver, as an indemnification for the expence of coining. This is inferred from a report of the late Board of Treasury, upon which that resolution appears to have been founded.  
Upon the supposition, that the expence of coinage ought to be defrayed out of the Metals, there are two ways in which it may be effected; one by a reduction of the quantity of fine Gold and silver in the Coins; the other by establishing a difference between the value of those Metals, in the Coins, and the Mint price of them in bullion.  
The first method appears to the Secretary inadmissible. He is unable to distinguish an operation of this sort from that of raising the denomination of the Coin; a measure, which has been disapproved by the wisest men of the nations, in which it has been practised, and condemned by the rest of the world. To declare, that a less weight of Gold or silver shall pass for the same sum, which before represented a greater weight, or to ordain that the same weight shall pass for a greater sum are things substantially of one nature. The consequence of either of them, if the change can be realized, is to degrade the money unit; obliging creditors to receive less than their just dues—and depreciating property of every kind: For it is manifest, that everything would in this case be represented by a less quantity of Gold and silver, than before.  
It is sometimes observed on this head, that though any article of property might in fact be represented by a less actual quantity of pure Metal, it would nevertheless be represented by something of the same intrinsic value. Every fabric, it is remarked, is worth intrinsically the price of the raw material and the expence of fabrication; a truth not less applicable to a piece of Coin, than to a yard of Cloth.  
This position, well founded in itself, is here misapplied. It supposes that the Coins, now in circulation, are to be considered as bullion, or in other words, as a raw material. But the fact is, that the adoption of them, as money, has caused them to become the fabric. It has invested them, with the character and office of Coins, and has given them a sanction and efficacy equivalent to that of the stamp of the sovereign. The prices of all our commodities, at home and abroad, and of all foreign commodities in our Markets, have found their level, in conformity to this principle. The foreign Coins may be divested of the privilege, they have hitherto been permitted to enjoy, and may of course be left to find their value in the market, as a raw material. But the quantity of Gold and Silver in the National Coins corresponding with a given sum cannot be made less, than heretofore, without disturbing the balance of intrinsic value; and making every Acre of Land, as well as every bushel of Wheat, of less actual worth than in time past. If the United States were isolated, and cut off from all intercourse with the rest of mankind, this reasoning would not be equally conclusive. But it appears decisive, when considered with a view to the relations, which Commerce has created between us and other Countries.  
It is however not improbable, that the effect meditated would be defeated by a rise of prices, proportioned to the diminution of the intrinsic value of the coins. This might be looked for in every enlightened commercial Country; but perhaps in none with greater certainty than in this; because, in none, are men less liable to be the dupes of sounds—in none has authority so little resource for substituting names to things.  
A general revolution in prices, though only nominally, and in appearance, could not fail to distract the ideas of the community, and would be apt to breed discontents as well among all those who live on the income of their money, as among the poorer classes of the people, to whom the necessaries of life would seem to have become dearer. In the confusion of such a state of things, ideas of value would not improbably adhere to the Old Coins, which from that circumstance, instead of feeling the effect of the loss of their privilege as money, would perhaps bear a price in the market, relatively to the new ones, in exact proportion to weight. The frequency of the demand for the metals to pay foreign balances would contribute to this effect.  
Among the evils, attendant on such an operation, are these—Creditors both of the Public and of individuals would lose a part of their property—Public and Private Credit would receive a wound—the effective revenues of the Government would be diminished. There is scarcely any point, in the œconomy of national affairs of greater moment, than the uniform preservation of the intrinsic value of the money unit. On this the security and steady value of property essentially depend.  
The second method, therefore, of defraying the expence of the Coinage out of the Metals, is greatly to be preferred to the other. This is to let the same sum of money continue to represent in the new Coins exactly the same quantity of Gold and silver, as it does in those now current—to allow at the mint such a price only for those metals, as will admit of profit just sufficient to satisfy the expence of coinage—to abolish the legal currency of the foreign coins, both in public and private payments—and of course to leave the superior utility of the national coins, for domestic purposes, to operate the difference of market value, which is necessary to induce the bringing of bullion to the Mint. In this case, all property and labor will still be represented, by the same quantity of Gold and Silver, as formerly; and the only change, which will be wrought, will consist in annexing the office of money exclusively to the national coins; consequently, withdrawing it from those of foreign countries, and suffering them to become, as they ought to be, mere articles of Merchandize.  
The arguments in favor of a regulation of this kind are—First—That the want of it is a cause of extra expence: there being then no motive of individual interest to distinguish between the national Coins and bullion, they are, it is alleged, indiscriminately melted down, for domestic manufactures, and exported, for the purposes of foreign trade: and it is added that when the Coins become light by wearing the same quantity of fine Gold or silver bears a higher price in bullion than in the coins; in which state of things the melting down of the coins to be sold as bullion is attended with profit; and from both causes the expence of the mint, or in other words the expence of maintaining the specie Capital of the Nation is materially augmented.  
Secondly—That the existence of such a regulation promotes a favorable course of exchange, and benefits Trade, not only by that Circumstance, but by obliging foreigners, in certain cases, to pay dearer for domestic commodities, and to sell their own cheaper.  
As far as relates to the tendency of a free coinage to produce an encrease of expence, in the different ways that have been stated—the argument must be allowed to have foundation, both in reason and in experience. It describes what has been exemplified in Great Britain.  
The effect of giving an artificial value to Bullion is not, at first sight, obvious; but it actually happened at the period immediately preceding the late reformation in the Gold Coin of the Country just named. A pound troy in gold bullion of standard fineness was then from 19/6 to 25/. sterling dearer than an equal weight of guineas, as delivered at the Mint. The phenomenon is thus accounted for—The old guineas were more than two perCent. lighter than their standard weight. This weight therefore, in bullion, was truly worth two per Cent more, than those guineas. It consequently had in respect to them a correspondent rise in the market. And as guineas were then current by tale, the new ones, as they issued from the mint, were confounded in circulation with the old ones; and by the association, were depreciated below the intrinsic value, in comparison with bullion. It became of course, a profitable traffic to sell bullion for coin, to select the light pieces, and reissue them in currency, and to melt down the heavy ones, and sell them again as bullion. This practice, besides other inconveniencies, cost the government large sums, in the renewal of the coins.  
But the remainder of the argument stands upon ground, far more questionable. It depends upon very numerous and very complex combinations; in which there is infinite latitude for fallacy and error.  
The most plausible part of it is that, which relates to the course of exchange. Experience, in France, has shewn, that the market price of bullion has been influenced by the Mint difference, between that and Coin; sometimes to the full extent of the difference; and it would seem to be a clear inference, that whenever that difference materially exceeded the charges of remitting bullion, from the country, where it existed, to another in which coinage was free, exchange would be in favour of the former.  
If, for instance, the balance of Trade, between France and England, were at any time equal, their Merchants would naturally have reciprocal payments to make to an equal amount; which as usual would be liquidated by means of bills of exchange. If in this situation, the difference between coin and bullion should be in the Market, as at the Mint of France, 8 ⅌. Cent; if also the charges of Transporting money from France to England should not be above two ⅌. Cent; and if exchange should be at par, it is evident, that a profit of six per Cent. might be made, by sending bullion from France to England, and drawing Bills for the amount. One hundred louis dors in coin would purchase the weight of 108 in bullion; one hundred of which remitted to England would suffice to pay a debt of an equal amount: and two being paid for the charges of insurance and transportation, there would remain 6 for the benefit of the person who should manage the negociation. But as so large a profit could not fail to produce competition; the bills in consequence of this would decrease in price, till the profit was reduced to the minimum of an adequate recompence for the trouble and risk. And as the amount of 100 louis dors, in England, might be afforded for 96 in France, with a profit of more than 1 and ½ ⅌ Cent, bills upon England might fall in France to 4 ⅌. Cent. below par; one ⅌. Cent being a sufficient profit to the exchanger or broker for the management of the business.  
But it is admitted, that this advantage is lost, when the balance of trade is against the Nation, which imposes the duty in question; because by encreasing the demand for bullion, it brings this to a par with the coins: And it is to be suspected, that where commercial principles have their free scope, and are well understood, the market difference between the metals in coin and bullion will seldom approximate to that of the Mint, if the latter be considerable. It must be not a little difficult to keep the money of the world, which can be employed to an equal purpose, in the commerce of the world, in a state of degradation, in comparison with the money of a particular country.  
This alone would seem sufficient to prevent it. Whenever the price of coin to bullion, in the market, materially exceeded the par of the Metals, it would become an object to send the bullion abroad; if not to pay a foreign balance, to be invested in some other way, in foreign Countries, where it bore a superior value: an operation, by which immense fortunes might be amassed, if it were not, that the exportation of the bullion would of itself restore the intrinsic par. But as it would naturally have this effect, the advantage supposed would contain in itself the principle of its own destruction. As long however, as the exportation of bullion could be made with profit, which is as long as exchange could remain below par, there would be a drain of the Gold and Silver of the Country.  
If any thing can maintain for a length of time a material difference, between the value of the Metals in Coin and in Bullion, it must be a constant and considerable balance of trade, in favor of the Country, in which it is maintained. In one situated like the United States, it would in all probability be a hopeless attempt. The frequent demand, for Gold and Silver, to pay balances to foreigners would tend powerfully to preserve the equilibrium of intrinsic value.  
The prospect is, that it would occasion foreign coins, to circulate by common consent, nearly at par with the national.  
To say, that as far as the effect of lowering exchange is produced, though it be only occasional and momentary, there is a benefit the more thrown into the scale of public prosperity is not satisfactory. It has been seen, that it may be productive of one evil, the investment of a part of the national capital in foreign Countries; which can hardly be beneficial, but in a situation like that of the United Netherlands; where an immense capital and a decrease of internal demand render it necessary to find employment for money, in the wants of other nations: And, perhaps, on a close examination, other evils may be descried.  
One allied to that, which has been mentioned, is this:—taking France, for the sake of mere concise illustration, as the scene. Whenever it happens that French louis d’ors are sent abroad, from whatever cause, if there be a considerable difference between coin, and bullion, in the market of France, it will constitute an advantageous traffic to send back these Louis d’ors and bring away bullion, in lieu of them; upon all of which exchanges, France must sustain an actual loss of a part of its Gold and Silver.  
Again, such a difference between Coin and Bullion may tend to counteract a favorable balance of Trade. Whenever a foreign Merchant is the carrier of his own commodities to France for sale, he has a strong inducement to bring back specie, instead of French commodities; because a return in the latter may afford no profit, may even be attended with loss, in the former, it will afford a certain profit. The same principle must be supposed to operate in the general course of remittances, from France to other Countries. The principal question with a Merchant naturally is—In what manner, can I realise a given sum, with most advantage, where I wish to place it? And in cases, in which other commodities are not likely to produce equal profit with bullion, it may be expected, that this will be preferred; to which the greater certainty attending the operation must be an additional incitement. There can hardly be imagined a circumstance, less friendly to trade, than the existence of an extra inducement, arising from the possibility of a profitable speculation, upon the articles themselves, to export from a Country its Gold and Silver, rather than the products of its land and labor.  
The other advantages supposed of obliging foreigners to pay dearer for domestic commodities, and to sell their own cheaper, are applied to a situation, which includes a favorable balance of Trade. It is understood in this sense. The prices of domestic commodities (such at least as are peculiar to the Country) remain attached to the denominations of the coins. When a favorable balance of trade realizes in the Market the Mint difference between Coin and Bullion, foreigners, who must pay in the latter, are obliged to give more of it for such commodities, than they otherwise would do. Again, the bullion, which is now obtained, at a cheaper rate in the home Market, will procure the same quantity of Goods in the foreign Market as before; which is said to render foreign commodities cheaper. In this reasoning much fallacy is to be suspected: If it be true, that foreigners pay more for domestic commodities, it must be equally true, that they get more for their own, when they bring them themselves to market. If peculiar, or other domestic commodities, adhere to the denominations of the coins, no reason occurs why foreign commodities of a like character should not do the same thing. And in this case, the foreigner, though he receive only the same value in coin for his merchandize, as formerly, can convert it into a greater quantity of bullion. Whence the Nation is liable to lose more of its gold and silver, than if their intrinsic value in relation to the coins were preserved. And whether the gain or the loss, will on the whole preponderate would appear to depend on the comparative proportion of active commerce of the one Country with the other.  
It is evident, also, that the Nation must pay as much Gold and Silver as before, for the Commodities which it procures abroad; and whether it obtains this gold and silver cheaper, or not, turns upon the solution of the question just intimated, respecting the relative proportion of active commerce, between the two countries.  
Besides these considerations, it is admitted in the reasoning, that the advantages supposed, which depend on a favorable balance of trade have a tendency to affect that balance disadvantageously. Foreigners, it is allowed, will in this case, seek some other vent for their commodities, and some other market, where they can supply their wants, at an easier rate. A Tendency of this kind, if real, would be a sufficient objection to the regulation. Nothing which contributes to change a beneficial current of trade, can well compensate, by particular advantages, for so injurious an effect. It is far more easy to transfer Trade, from a less to a more favorable Channel, than when once transferred, to bring it back to its old one. Every source of artificial interruption to an advantageous current is, therefore, cautiously to be avoided.  
It merits attention, that the able Minister, who lately and so long presided over the Finances of France, does not attribute to the duty of Coinage, in that Country, any particular advantages, in relation to Exchange and Trade. Though he rather appears an advocate for it, ’tis on the sole ground of the revenue, it affords, which he represents, as in the nature of a very moderate duty on the general mass of exportation.  
And it is not improbable, that to the singular felicity of situation of that Kingdom is to be attributed its not having been sensible of the evils which seem incident to the regulation.  
There is perhaps no part of Europe, which has so little need of other Countries, as France. Comprehending a variety of soils and climates, an immense population, its agriculture in a state of mature improvement, it possesses within its own bosom most, if not all the productions of the earth, which any of its most favored neighbours can boast. The variety, abundance and excellence of its Wines constitute a peculiar advantage in its favor. Arts and Manufactures are there also in a very advanced state—some of them of considerable importance in higher perfection than elswhere. Its contiguity to Spain, the intimate nature of its connection with that Country; a Country with few fabrics of its own, consequently numerous wants, and the principal receptacle of the treasures of the new world. These circumstances concur, in securing to France, so uniform, and so considerable a balance of Trade, as in a great measure to counteract the natural tendency of any errors, which may exist in the system of her Mint; and to render inferences from the operation of that system there, in reference to this country, more liable to mislead, than to instruct. Nor ought it to pass unnoticed, that with all these advantages, the Government of France has found it necessary, on some occasions, to employ very violent methods to compel the bringing of Bullion to the Mint; a circumstance, which affords a strong presumption of the inexpediency of the regulation, and of the impracticability of executing it in the United States.  
☞ This point has been the longer dwelt upon, not only because there is a diversity of opinion among speculative Men, concerning it, and a diversity in the practice of the most considerable commercial nations; but because the acts of our own government, under the confederation, have not only admitted the expediency of defraying the expence of coinage out of the metals themselves; but upon this idea have both made a deduction from the weight of the coins, and established a difference between their regulated value and the Mint price of Bullion greater than would result from that deduction. This double operation, in favor of a principle so questionable in itself, has made a more particular investigation of it a duty.  
The intention, however, of the preceding remarks is rather to shew, that the expectation of commercial advantages ought not to decide in favor of a duty of coinage, and that if it should be adopted, it ought not to be in the form of a deduction from the intrinsic value of the coins—than absolutely to exclude the idea of any difference, whatever, between the value of the Metals in coin and in Bullion. It is not clearly discerned, that a small difference between the Mint price of Bullion, and the regulated value of the Coins would be pernicious, or that it might not even be adviseable, in the first instance, by way of experiment, merely as a preventive to the melting down and exportation of the Coins. This will now be somewhat more particularly considered.  
The arguments for a coinage entirely free are, that it preserves the intrinsic value of the Metals; that it makes the expence of fabrication a general instead of a partial tax; and that it tends to promote the abundance of gold, and silver, which it is alledged will flow to that place, where they find the best price, and from that place, where they are in any degree undervalued.  
The first consideration has not much weight, as an objection to a plan, which without diminishing the quantity of Metals, in the Coins, merely allows a less price for them in bullion at the national factory or Mint. No rule of intrinsic value is violated, by considering the raw material, as worth less than the fabric, in proportion to the expence of fabrication. And by divesting foreign coins of the privilege of circulating as money they become the raw material.  
The second consideration has perhaps greater weight. But it may not amount to an objection, if it be the best method of preventing disorders, in the coins which it is in a particular manner, the interest of those, on whom the tax would fall, to prevent. The practise of taking Gold by weight, which has of late years obtained in Great Britain, has been found in some degree a remedy; but this is inconvenient, and may on that account fall into disuse. Another circumstance has had a remedial operation. This is, the delays of the Mint. It appears to be the practice there not to make payment for the bullion, which is brought to be exchanged for Coin; ’till it either has in fact, or is pretended to have undergone the process of recoining.  
The necessity of fulfilling prior engagements is a cause or pretext for postponing the delivery of the coin in lieu of the bullion. And this delay creates a difference in the market price of the two things. Accordingly for some years past, an Ounce of standard Gold, which is worth in coin £3.17.10½ sterling has been in the Market of London, in bullion, only £3.17.6, which is within a small fraction of one half per Cent. less. Whether this be management in the mint to accommodate the Bank in the purchase of Bullion or to effect indirectly something equivalent to a formal difference of price, or whether it be the natural course of the business is open to conjecture.  
It, at the same time, indicates, that if the Mint were to make prompt payment, at about half per Cent. less, than it does at present, the State of bullion in respect to coin would be precisely the same as it now is. And it would be then certain that the Government would save expence in the Coinage of Gold; since it is not probable, that the time actually lost in the course of the year in converting bullion into coin can be an equivalent to half per Cent. on the advance; and there will generally be at the command of the Treasury, a considerable sum of money, waiting for some periodical disbursement, which without hazard might be applied to that advance.  
In what sense, a free coinage can be said to promote the abundance of gold and silver, may be inferred from the instances, which have been given of the tendency of a contrary system to promote their exportation. It is, however, not probable, that a very small difference of value between coin and bullion can have any effect, which ought to enter into calculation. There can be no inducement of positive profit, to export the bullion, as long as the difference of price is exceeded by the expence of transportation. And the prospect of smaller loss upon the Metals, than upon commodities, when the difference is very minute, will be frequently overbalanced by the possibility of doing better with the latter, from a rise of markets. It is at any rate certain, that it can be of no consequence, in this view, whether the superiority of coin to bullion in the Market be produced, as in England, by the delay of the Mint, or by a formal discrimination in the regulated values.  
Under an impression, that a small difference between the value of the coin, and the Mint price of bullion is the least exceptionable expedient for restraining the melting down, or exportation of the former, and not perceiving, that if it be a very moderate one, it can be hurtful in other respects—The Secretary is inclined to an experiment of ½ ⅌. Cent on each of the Metals. The fact, which has been mentioned, with regard to the price of Gold bullion, in the English Market, seems to demonstrate that such a difference may safely be made. In this case, there must be immediate payment for the Gold and Silver offered to the Mint. How far ½ ⅌. Cent will go, towards defraying the expence of the coinage cannot be determined, before hand with accuracy. It is presumed, that on an œconomical plan, it will suffice in relation to Gold. But it is not expected, that the same rate in silver will be sufficient to defray the expence attending that Metal. Some additional provision may therefore be found necessary, if this limit be adopted.  
It does not seem to be adviseable, to make any greater difference, in regard to silver than to gold: Because it is desireable, that the proportion between the two Metals, in the Market, should correspond with that in the Coins, which would not be the case, if the mint price of one was comparatively lower, than that of the other; and because also silver being proposed to be rated in respect to Gold, somewhat below its general commercial value, if there should be a disparity, to its disadvantage, in the Mint prices of the two Metals, it would obstruct too much the bringing of it to be coined, and would add an inducement to export it. Nor does it appear to the Secretary safe to make a greater difference, between the value of Coin and bullion, than has been mentioned. It will be better to have to increase it hereafter, if this shall be found expedient, than to have to recede from too considerable a difference in consequence of evils, which shall have been experienced.  
It is sometimes mentioned, as an expedient, which, consistently with a free coinage, may serve to prevent the evils desired to be avoided, to incorporate in the coins a greater proportion of alloy, than is usual, regulating their value nevertheless according to the quantity of pure metal, they contain. This it is supposed, by adding to the difficulty or refining them, would cause bullion to be preferred both for manufacture, and exportation.  
But strong objections lie against this Scheme: An augmentation of expence; An actual depreciation of the Coin; A danger of still greater depreciation in the public opinion; the facilitating of Counterfeits: While it is questionable, whether it would have the effect expected from it.  
The alloy being esteemed of no value, an increase of it is evidently an increase of expence. This in relation to the Gold Coins particularly, is a matter of moment. It has been noted, that the alloy in them consists partly of Silver. If to avoid expence, the addition should be of copper only, this would spoil the appearance of the coin, and give it a base countenance. Its beauty would indeed be injured, though in a less degree, even if the usual proportions of Silver and Copper should be maintained, in the encreased quantity of alloy.  
And however inconsiderable an additional expenditure of Copper, in the Coinage of a year, may be deemed; in a series of years it would become of consequence. In regulations, which contemplate the lapse and operation of ages, a very small item of expence acquires importance.  
The actual depreciation of the Coin, by an increase of alloy, results from the very circumstance, which is the motive to it—the greater difficulty of refining. In England, it is customary for those concerned in manufactures of Gold to make a deduction, in the price, of four pence sterling, per ounce, of fine Gold, for every carrat which the mass containing it is below the legal standard. Taking this as a rule, an inferiority of a single carrat or ¹⁄₂₄ part in the Gold Coins of the United States, compared with the English Standard would cause the same quantity of pure Gold in them to be worth nearly ⁴⁄₁₀ths ⅌. Cent. less than in the Coins of Great Britain. This circumstance would be likely in process of time to be felt in the Market of the United States.  
A still greater depreciation in the public opinion would be to be apprehended from the apparent debasement of the Coin. The effects of imagination and prejudice cannot safely be disregarded, in any thing that relates to money. If the beauty of the coin be impaired, it may be found difficult to satisfy the generality of the community, that what appears worse is not really less valuable; And it is not altogether certain, that an impression of its being so may not occasion an unnatural augmentation of prices.  
Greater danger of imposition by Counterfeits is also to be apprehended from the injury, which will be done to the appearance of the Coin. It is a just observation that “The perfection of the Coins is a great safeguard against counterfeits.” And it is evident that the colour as well as the excellence of the workmanship is an ingredient in that perfection. The intermixture of too much alloy, particularly of Copper, in the Gold Coins at least, must materially lessen the facility of distinguishing by the eye, the purer from the baser kind, the genuine from the counterfeit.  
The inefficacy of the arrangement to the purpose, intended to be answered by it, is rendered probable by different considerations. If the standard of plate in the United States should be regulated according to that of the national coins, it is to be expected, that the Goldsmith would prefer these to the foreign coins; because he would find them prepared to his hand, in the state which he desires; whereas he would have to expend an additional quantity of alloy to bring the foreign coins to that State. If the standard of plate, by law, or usage, should be superior to that of the national Coins, there would be a possibility of the foreign Coins bearing a higher price in the Market; and this would not only obstruct their being brought to the Mint, but might occasion the exportation of the national coin in preference. It is not understood, that the practice of making an abatement of price for the inferiority of standard is applicable to the English Mint; and if it be not, this would also contribute to frustrating the expected effect from the increase of alloy. For, in this case, a given quantity of pure Metal in our standard, would be worth, as much there, as in bullion, of the English or any other standard.  
Considering therefore, the uncertainty of the success of the expedient, and the inconveniencies, which seem incident to it, it would appear preferable to submit to those of a free coinage. It is observable, that additional expence, which is one of the principal of these, is also applicable to the proposed remedy.  
It is now proper to resume and finish the answer to the first question; in order to which the three succeeding ones have necessarily been anticipated. The conclusion, to be drawn from the observations, which have been made on the subject, is this, that the unit in the coins of the United States ought to correspond with 24 Grains and ¾ of a Grain of a pure Gold and with 371. Grains and ¼ of a Grain of pure silver, each answering to a dollar in the money of account. The former is exactly agreeable to the present value of Gold, and the latter is within a small fraction of the mean of the two last emissions of dollars; the only ones which are now found in common circulation, and of which the newest is in the greatest abundance. The alloy in each case to be 1/12 of the total weight, which will make the unit 27 Grains of standard Gold and 405 Grains of standard silver.  
Each of these it has been remarked will answer to a Dollar in the money of account. It is conceived that nothing better can be done in relation to this, than to pursue the tract marked out by the resolution of the 8th. of August 1786. This has been approved abroad, as well as at home, and it is certain, that nothing can be more simple or convenient than the decimal subdivisions.  
There is every reason to expect that the method will speedily grow into general use, when it shall be seconded by corresponding Coins. On this plan, the unit in the Money of account will continue to be, as established by that resolution, a Dollar, and its multiples, dimes, cents, and milles, or tenths, hundredths, and thousandths.  
With regard to the number of different pieces which shall compose the coins of the United States, two things are to be consulted—convenience of circulation and cheapness of the coinage. The first ought not to be sacrificed to the last; but as far as they can be reconciled to each other, it is desireable to do it. Numerous and small (if not too minute) subdivisions assist circulation; but the multiplication of the smaller kinds increases expence; the same process being necessary to a small as to a large piece.  
As it is easy to add, it will be most adviseable to begin with a small number, ’till experience shall decide whether any other kinds are necessary. The following, it is conceived, will be sufficient in the commencement.  
1 Gold piece, equal in weight and value to ten Units or Dollars.  
1 Gold piece, equal to a tenth part of the former, and which shall be a unit or Dollar.  
1 Silver piece, which shall also be a unit or dollar.  
1 Silver piece, which shall be in weight and value a tenth part of the silver unit or Dollar.  
1 Copper piece, which shall be of the value of a hundredth part of a dollar.  
1 other Copper piece, which shall be half the value of the former.  
It is not proposed, that the lightest of the two Gold Coins, should be numerous; as in large payments, the larger the pieces, the shorter the process of counting, the less the risk of mistake, and consequently the greater the safety and the convenience; and in small payments, it is not perceived, that any inconvenience can accrue, from an entire dependence on the Silver and Copper Coins. The chief inducement to the establishment of the small gold piece is to have a sensible object, in that Metal, as well as in silver to express the unit. Fifty thousand at a time in circulation may suffice for this purpose.  
The tenth part of a dollar is but a small piece, and with the aid of the copper coins will probably suffice for all the more minute uses of circulation. It is less, than the least of the silver Coins, now in general currency in England.  
The largest copper piece will nearly answer to the halfpenny sterling and the smallest of course to the farthing. Pieces of very small value are a great accommodation and the means of a beneficial œconomy to the Poor; by enabling them to purchase, in small portions, and at a more reasonable rate, the necessaries of which they stand in need. If there are only Cents, the lowest price for any portion of a vendible commodity, however inconsiderable in quantity, will be a Cent; if there are half Cents, it will be a half Cent; and in a great number of cases exactly the same things will be sold for a half Cent which if there were none would cost a Cent. But a half Cent is low enough for the minimum of price. Excessive minuteness would defeat its object. To enable the poorer classes to procure necessaries cheap is to enable them with more comfort to themselves to labor for less; the advantages of which need no comment.  
The denominations of the silver Coins contained in the Resolution of the 8th. of August 1786. are conceived to be significant and proper. The dollar is recommended by its correspondency with the present coin of that name, for which it is designed to be a substitute; which will facilitate its ready adoption as such in the minds of the Citizens. The disme or tenth, the Cent or Hundredth, the Mille, or thousandth are proper, because they express the proportions, which they are intended to designate. It is only to be regretted, that the meaning of these terms will not be familiar to those who are not acquainted with the language from which they are borrowed. It were to be wished, that the length, and in some degree the clumsiness of some of the corresponding terms in English did not discourage from preferring them. It is useful to have names which signify the things to which they belong; and, in respect to objects of general use, in a manner intelligible to all. Perhaps it might be an improvement to let the dollar have the appellation either of Dollar or Unit (which last will be the most significant) and to substitute “tenth” for disme. In time, the Unit may succeed to the Dollar. The word Cent being in use in various transactions and instruments will without much difficulty be understood as the hundredth, and the half Cent of course as the two hundredth part.  
The Eagle, is not a very expressive or apt appellation for the largest gold piece, but nothing better occurs. The smallest of the two Gold Coins may be called the Dollar or Unit, in common with the silver piece, with which it coincides.  
The volume or size of each piece is a matter of more consequence than its denomination. It is evident, that the more superficies or surface, the more the piece will be liable to be injured by friction or in other words the faster it will wear. For this reason it is desireable to render the thickness in proportion to breadth as great as may consist with neatness and good appearance. Hence the form of the Double Guinea, or double louis d’or is preferable to that of the half Johannes for the large Gold piece. The small one cannot well be of any other size than the Portuguese piece of Eight of the same Metal.  
As it is of consequence to fortify the idea of the identity of the dollar, it may be best to let the form and size of the new one, as far as the quantity of matter (the alloy being less) permits, agree with the form and size of the present. The diameter may be the same.  
The tenths may be in a mean between the Spanish ⅛ and ¹⁄₁₆ of a dollar.  
The Copper Coins may be formed merely with a view to good appearance as any difference in the wearing that can result from difference of form can be of little consequence, in reference to that metal.  
It is conceived, that the weight of the Cent may be eleven pennyweight, which will about correspond with the value of the Copper and the expence of Coinage. This will be to conform to the rule of intrinsic value, as far as regard to the convenient size of the Coins will permit; and the deduction of the expence of Coinage in this case will be the more proper as the copper coins, which have been current hitherto, have passed ’till lately for much more than their intrinsic value. Taking the weight, as has been suggested, the size of the Cent may be nearly that of the piece herewith transmitted, which weighs 10 dwt. 11 grs. 10 m. Two thirds of the diameter of the Cent will suffice for the diameter of the half Cent.  
It may perhaps be thought expedient according to general practice to make the copper coinage an object of profit; but where this is done to any considerable extent, it is hardly possible to have effectual security against counterfeits. This consideration, concurring with the soundness of the principle of preserving the intrinsic value of the money of a Country seems to outweigh the consideration of profit.  
The foregoing suggestions respecting the sizes of the several coins are made on the supposition, that the Legislature may think fit to regulate this matter: Perhaps however it may be judged not unadviseable to leave it to executive discretion.  
With regard to the proposed size of the Cent, it is to be confessed, that it is rather greater, than might be wished, if it could with propriety and safety be made less: And should the value of Copper continue to decline, as it has done for some time past, it is very questionable, whether it will long remain alone a fit metal for money. This has led to a consideration of the expediency of uniting a small proportion of silver with the copper, in order to be able to lessen the bulk of the inferior coins. For this, there are precedents in several parts of Europe. In France, the composition, which is called billion, has consisted of one part silver and four parts Copper; according to which proportion a Cent might contain seventeen grains; defraying out of the material the expence of coinage. The conveniency of size is a recommendation of such a species of coin, but the Secretary is deterred from proposing it by the apprehension of Counterfeits. The effect of so small a quantity of silver, in, comparatively so large a quantity of Copper, could easily be imitated by a mixture of other metals of little value, and the temptation to doing it would be inconsiderable.  
The devices of the Coins are far from being matters of indifference, as they may be made the vehicles of useful impressions. They ought therefore to be emblematical, but without losing sight of simplicity. The fewer sharp points and angles there are, the less will be the loss by wearing. The Secretary thinks it best on this head to confine himself to these concise and general remarks.  
The last point to be discussed respects the Currency of foreign Coins.  
The abolition of this, in proper season, is a necessary part of the system contemplated for the national coinage. But this, it will be expedient to defer, ’till some considerable progress has been made in preparing substitutes for them. A graduation may therefore be found most convenient.  
The foreign coins may be suffered to circulate, precisely upon their present footing, for one year after the mint shall have commenced its operations. The privilege may then be continued for another year to the Gold Coins of Portugal, England, and France, and to the silver coins of Spain. And these may still be permitted to be current, for one year more, at the rates allowed to be given for them at the Mint; after the expiration of which the circulation of all foreign coins to cease.  
The monies, which will be paid into the Treasury, during the first year, being recoined, before they are issued anew, will afford a partial substitute before any interruption is given to the preexisting supplies of circulation. The revenues of the succeeding year, and the coins which will be brought to the Mint, in consequence of the discontinuance of their currency, will materially extend the substitute, in the course of that year, and its extension will be so far increased, during the third year, by the facility of procuring the remaining species to be recoined, which will arise from the diminution of their current values, as probably to enable the dispensing wholly with the circulation of the foreign Coins, after that period. The progress, which the Currency of Bank bills, will be likely to have made, during the same time, will also afford a substitute of another kind.  
This arrangement, besides avoiding a sudden stagnation of circulation, will cause a considerable proportion of whatever loss may be incident to the establishment, in the first instance, to fall as it ought to do upon the Government, and will probably tend to distribute the remainder of it more equally among the community.  
It may nevertheless be adviseable in addition to the precautions here suggested, to repose a discretionary authority in the President of the United States to continue the Currency of the Spanish dollar, at a value corresponding with the quantity of fine silver contained in it, beyond the period above mentioned for the cessation of the circulation of the foreign coins. It is possible than an exception in favour of this particular species of coin may be found expedient: And it may tend to obviate inconveniencies, if there be a power to make the exception in a capacity to be exerted when the period shall arrive.  
The Secretary for the Department of State, in his Report to the House of Representatives on the subject of establishing a uniformity in the weights, measures and coins of the United States, has proposed that the weight of the Dollar should correspond with the Unit of Weight. This was done on the supposition, that it would require but a very small addition to the quantity of Metal, which the dollar, independently of the object he had in view, ought to contain, in which he was guided by the resolution of the 8th. of August 1786. fixing the dollar at 375 Grains &amp; 64 hundredths of a grain.  
Taking this as the proper standard of the Dollar, a small alteration for the sake of incorporating so systematic an idea would appear desireable. But if the principles which have been reasoned from, in this Report, are just, the execution of that idea becomes more difficult. It would certainly not be adviseable to make, on that account, so considerable a change in the money unit, as would be produced by the addition of five grains of silver to the proper weight of the dollar, without a proportional augmentation of its relative value. And to make such an augmentation would be to abandon the advantage of preserving the identity of the dollar, or to speak more accurately of having the proposed one received and considered, as a mere substitute for the present.  
The end may however be attained without either of those inconveniencies, by encreasing the proportion of alloy in the silver coins. But this would destroy the uniformity, in that respect, between the Gold and Silver coins. It remains therefore to elect which of the two systematic ideas shall be pursued or relinquished. And it may be remarked, that it will be more easy to convert the present silver coins into the proposed ones, if these last have the same, or nearly the same proportion of alloy, than if they have less.  
The organization of the Mint yet remains to be considered.  
This relates to the persons to be employed, and to the services which they are respectively to perform. It is conceived that there ought to be  
A Director of the Mint, to have the general superintendance of the business.  
An Assay Master, or Assayer, to receive the Metals brought to the Mint, ascertain their fineness and deliver them to be coined.  
A Master Coiner, to conduct the making of the Coins.  
A Cashier, to receive and pay them out.  
An Auditor, to keep and adjust the Accounts of the Mint.  
Clerks, as many as the Director of the Mint shall deem necessary, to assist the different Officers.  
Workmen, as many as may be found requisite.  
A Porter.  
In several of the European Mints there are various other Officers, but the foregoing are those only, who appear to be indispensable. Persons in the Capacity of Clerks will suffice instead of the others, with the advantage of greater Oeconomy.  
The number of Workmen is left indefinite, because at certain times, it is requisite to have more than at others. They will however never be numerous. The expence of the establishment, in an ordinary year, will probably be from fifteen to twenty thousand dollars.  
The remedy for errors in the weight and alloy of the Coins must necessarily form a part in the system of a Mint, and the manner of applying it will require to be regulated. The following account is given of the practice in England, in this particular.  
A certain number of pieces are taken promiscuously out of every fifteen pounds of Gold coined at the Mint, which is deposited for safe keeping in a strong Box called the pix. This box, from time to time is opened in the presence of the Lord Chancellor, the Officers of the Treasury and others; and portions are selected from the pieces of each coinage, which are melted together, and the mass assayed by a jury of the Company of Goldsmiths. If the imperfection and deficiency both in fineness and weight fall short of a sixth of a Carrat or 40 Grains of pure Gold upon a pound of standard, the Master of the Mint is held excuseable; because it is supposed that no workman can reasonably be answerable for greater exactness. The expediency of some similar regulation seems to be manifest.  
All which is humbly submitted.

— i  
Report ef the Secretary of the Trtafury, on the sub- ]  
jiil of a Mint.  
Tlie Secretary of the Treasury having attentively j  
considered the fiibjetft referred to him by the ]  
order of the House of Reprefetuati ves at&quot; the  
fifteenth of April lad, relatively to the estab­  
lishment of a Mint, mod refpetitfully submits  
the result of his enquiries and reflections.  
A PL AN for an eftablidiment of this nature, invokes a great  
&gt;T~Y. vaiiety of considerations, intricate, nice, and impoitant.  
The general date of debtor and creditor ; all the relations and  
consequences ot price; the essential interedsof trade and indudrv;  
the value of all properly ; the whole income both of the State and  
of individuals, are liable to be sensibly influenced, beneficially,  
or otherwise, by the judicious, or injudicious regulation of this  
interfiling object. .  
It is one likewise, not more necefTary than difficult to b&quot; right­  
ly adjuded ; one which has frequently occupicd the rrdefltons  
and rcfearches of politicians, without having harmonised their  
opinions on some of the moil important of the principles which  
enter into its difcuflion. Accordingly, different systems con­  
tinue to be ad»ocatc(!, and the fydems of different nations, after  
much invedigation, continue to differ from each other.  
But if a right adjudment of the matter be truly of such nicety  
and difficulty, a quedion naturally arifrs, whether it may not be  
mod advifeable to leave things, in this relpeft, in the Hare in which  
they are ? Why, might it be asked, since they have so long pro­  
ceeded in a train, which has caused no general sensation of in­  
convenience, diould alterations be attempted, the precise effeftof  
which cannot with certainty be calculated ?  
The answer to this quedion is not perplexing.—The immtnle  
disorder which a£tually reigns in so delicately and important a  
concern, and the (till greater disorder which is every moment  
podible, call loudly for a reform. The dollar, originally contem­  
plated in the money tranfa&amp;ions of this country, by fucceflive di­  
minutions of its weight and finenefs, has fudained a depreciation  
of 5 per cent. And yet the new dollar has a currency in all pay­  
ments in place of the old, with scarcely any attention to the dif­  
ference between them. The operation of this in depreciating the  
value of property, depending upon pad contracts ; and (as far as I  
inattention to the alteration in the coin may be luppofed to leave  
prices ftationarv) of all other property is appaient. Nor can it  
require argument to prove, that a nation ought not to differ the  
value of the property of its citizens to fluctuate with the fluilua­  
tions ot a foreign mint, and to change with the changes in the re­  
gulations of a foreign sovereign. 1 his,neverthelcfs, is the con­  
dition of one, which having no coins of itsown, adopts with im­  
plicit confidence thofeof other countries.  
Theunequal values allowed in different pans of the Union to  
coins of the fame intrinsic worth ; the delcttive species of them,  
which rmbarraffes the circulation of some of the States ; and the  
diflimilarity of their fevcial monies of account, are inconvenien­  
ces, which if not to l&gt;e ascribed to the wantof a uat-oeal coinage,  
will at least be mod effeflually remedied by the edablifhmeut of  
one ; a meafurc that will at the fame time give additional security  
against impositions, by countei feit as well as by base currencies.  
It was with great reason, therefore, that the a-.teniion of Con­  
gress, under the late confederation, was repeatedly drawn to the  
fdablifhment of a mint; and it is with equal reason that the fu&#x27;j­  
jeft has been resumed ; now that the favorable change which has  
taken place in the duration of public affairs, admits of its being  
carried into execution.  
But though the difficulty of devidng a proper edablifhment  
ou»ht not to deter from undertaking so necessary a work ; yet it  
ennnot but inspire diffidence in one, whose duty it is made, to  
propose a plan for the purpose, and may perh.ips be permuted to  
be relied upon as some excuse for any errors which may becharge­  
able upon it, oi for any deviations from founder principles, which  
may have been suggested by others, or even in pait atted upon by  
the former government of the United States.  
In order to a right judgment ot what ought to be done, the fol­  
lowing particulars require to be difcuffrd :  
:d.°What ought to be the nature of the money unit of the  
United States ?  
2. What the proportion between gold and diver, if coins of  
both metals are to be edablifhed ?  
3d What the propoition and compodtion of alloy in each  
kind ?  
4th. Whether the expence of coinage (hall be defrayed by the  
government, or out of the material itfelf ?  
,sth. What shall be the number, denominations, dzes, and de­  
vices of the coins ?  
6th. Whether foreign coins (ball be permitted to be current or  
not; if the former, at what rate, and foi what period.  
A prc-requidte to determining with propriety what ought to be  
the money unit of the United States, is to endeavour to form as ac­  
curate an idea as the nature of the cafe will admit of, what it ac­  
tually is. The pound, though of various value, is the unit in the  
monev of account of all the States. But it is not equally easy to  
pronounce what is to be conddered as the unit in the coins. There  
being no formal regulation on the point (the resolutions of Con­  
grefsol the 6th of July, 1785, and Bth of August, 1786, having  
never yet been carried into operation) it can only be inferred from  
usage or practice. The manner ot adjusting foreign exchanges,  
would fcem to indicate the dollar as belt entitled to that charac­  
ter. In thefc, the old piaflre of Spain, or old Seville piece of  
eight rials, ot the value of four (hillings and dx-pence derling, is  
evidently contemplated. &quot;1 he computed par between Great-Bri­  
tain and&#x27;Pennfylvauia will ferre as an example. Accord:ng to  
that, one hundred pounds derling is equal to one hundred and  
hxty-dx pounds and two-thirdsof a pound Pennfylvama currency;  
which corresponds with the proportion between 4J6 derling and  
7/6 the current value of the dollar in that dale, by invariable usage.  
And as far as the information of the Secretary goes, the fame coin­  
parifon holds in the other dates.  
But this circumdance in favour of the dollar, loses much of its  
weight from two considerations. That Ipecies of coin has nevei  
had any fettled or dandard value, according to weight or duenefs,  
but has been permitted to circulate bv tale, without regard to ei­  
ther; very much as a mere money of convenience ; while gold  
has had a fixed price by weight, and with an eye to its dnenefs.  
This greater dability of value of the gold coins, is an argument  
of force for regarding the money unit as having been hitherto vir­  
tually attached to gold, rather than to diver.  
Twenty-four giains and 6-8 of a grain of fine gold, have cor­  
responded with the nominal value of the dollar in the several dat s;  
•without regard to the fuccedive diminutions of its intriridc  
■worth.  
But if the dollar {hould, notwithdanding, be supposed to have  
the bed title to being considered as the present unit in the coins, it  
would remain to determine what kind of dollar ought to be under­  
stood, or, in other words, what precise quantity of fine diver.  
The old piadre of Spain, which appears to have regulated our  
foreign exchanges, weighed 17 dwt. 12 grains, and contained 386  
grains and 15 mites of fine diver. But this piece has been long  
since out of circulation. The dollars now in common currency  
are ot recent cate, and much inferior to that, both in weight and  
finenefs. The average weight of them, upon different trials in  
large masses, has been found to be 17 dwt. 8 grains. Their fine­  
nefs is less prec&#x27;fel} ascertained ; the results of various essays made  
by different persons, under the direction of the late fupcrirtendant  
of the finances and of the Secretary, being as various as the essays  
  
themselves. The difference between their extremes is nest less  
ban 24 grains in a dollar, of the fame weight and age ; which is  
  
too much for .any probable differences in the pieces. It is rather  
to be prelumed that a degree of inaccuiacy has been occasioned  
by the want of proper apparatus, and in general, of practice. The  
experiment which appears to have the best pretentions to exa£l­  
nefs, would make the new dollar to contain 370 grains and 933  
thoufandih parts of a grain of pure silver.  
  
According to an authority, ori which the Secretary places re­  
liance, the standard of Soain for its silver coin in the year 1761,  
was 261 parts fine and 27 paits alloy ; at which proportion, a  
dollar of 17 dwt. 8 grains, would con fill of 377 grains of fine fil­  
vcr, and 39 grains of alloy : But there is no queflion that this  
standard has been iince altered confidcrably for the worse ; to  
what precise point is not as well afceriained as could be wished ;  
but from a computation of the value of collars in the markets both  
of Amflerdam and London (a criterion which cannot materially  
mislead) the new dollai appears to contain 368 grains of fine sil­  
ver, and that which immediately preceded it about 374 grains.  
In this Hate there is some difficulty in defining the  
dollar, which is to be understood as Constituting the present mo­  
ney unit ; on the supposition of its being moll applicable to that  
species of coin. The old Seville piece of 386 grains and 15  
mites fine, comports belt with the computations of foreign ex­  
changes, and with the more ancient contrasts relpe&amp;ing landed  
property; but far the greater number of contra6ls Hill in opera­  
tion concerning that kind of property, and all those of a merely  
personal nature, now in force, mud be referred to a dollar of a  
different kind. The a£tual dollar at the time of contra&amp;ing is  
the only one which can be supposed to have been intended, and  
it has been seen, that as long ago as the year 1761, there had been  
a material degradation ot the standard. even in regard to  
the more ancient contracts, no person has ever had any idea of a  
scruple about receiving the dollar of the day, as a full equivalent  
for the nominal sum, which the dollar originally imported.  
A recurrence therefore to the ancient dollar would be in the  
greatest number of cases an innovation in fatt, and in all, an in­  
novation in refpeft to opinion. The actual dollar, in common  
circulation, has evidently a much better claim to be regarded as  
the a£lual money unit.  
  
The mean intrinsic value of the different kinds of known dol­  
lars has been intimated as affording the proper criterion. But  
when it is recollected, that the more ancient and more valuable  
ones are not now to be met with at all in circulation, and that  
the mass of thofc generally current is composed ot the newelt and  
most interior kinds, it will be perceived, that even an equation  
ot that nature would be a considerable innovation upon the real  
present (late of things ; which it will certainly be prudent to ap­  
proach, as far as may be confident with the permanent order, de­  
signed to be introduced.  
  
An additional reason for considering the prevailing dollar,  
as the fhndard of the present money unit, rather than the ancient  
one, is, that it will not only be conformable to the true existing  
proportion between the two metals in this country, but will be  
more conformable to tnat which obtains in the commercial world,  
generally. (To be continued.)

with us the fame thing, in our curren­  
cy. To determine this, the quantity of fine silver in the general  
mass of the dollars now in circulation, must afford the rule.  
Taking the rate of the late dollar of 374 grains, the proportion  
would be as 1 to 15.11—Taking the rate ot thenewefl dollar, the  
proportion would then be as Ito 14.87. The mean of the two  
would give the proportion of 1 to 15 very nearly ; less than the  
legal proportion in the coins of Great-Britain, which is as one  
to 15.2 ; but lomewhat more than the attual or market propor­  
tion, which is not quite 1 to 15.  
The preceding view ot the fubjeft tloes not indeed afford a  
precise or certain definition of the present unit, in the coins, but  
it furnifhes d3ta, which will serve as guides in the progress of the  
investigation. It ascertains at least, that the sum in the money ot  
account of each State corresponding with the nominal value of the  
dollar in such State corresponds also with 24 grains and 6-8 of a  
grain of fine gold, and with fomcthing between 368 and 374  
grains of fine silver.  
The next enquiry towards a right determination of what  
ought to be the future money unit of the United States turns up­  
on these qucftions—Whether it ought to be peculiarly attached to  
either of the metals, in preference to the other or not ; and, if to  
either, to which of them ?  
  
The suggestions and proceedings hitherto have had for obje£l  
the annexing of it emphatically to the silver dollar. A refoluuon  
otCongrefs ofthe6ih July, 1785, declares that the money unit of  
the United States shall be a dollar ; and another resolution of the  
Bth of August, 1786, fixes that dollar at 375 grains and 54 hun­  
dredths of a gram of fine silver. The fame resolution, however,  
determines, that there ftiall also be two gold coins, one of 246  
grains and 268 parts of a grain of pure gold, equal to ten dollars,  
and the other of half that quantity of pure gold, equal to five  
dollars : And it is not explained, whether either of the two spe­  
cies of coins, of gold or silver, shall have any greater legality in  
payments, than the other. Yet it would seem, that a preference,  
in this particular is ncceffary to execute the idea of attaching the  
unit exclusively to one kind. If each of them be as valid as the  
other, in payments lo any amount, it is not obvious, in what ef-1  
fe&amp;uai sense, either of them can be deemed the money unit, ra­  
ther than the other.  
  
If the general declaration, that the dollar shall be the money  
unit of the United States could be unoerftood to give it a fupcri­  
or legality, in payments, the institution of coins of gold, and the  
declaration that each of them shall be equal to a certain number  
of dollars, would appear to destroy that inference : And the cir­  
cumstance of making the dollar the unit in the money of acconnt  
seems to be rather matter of form, than of substance.  
  
Contrary to the ideas which have heretofore prevailed, in the  
suggestions concerning a coinage for the United States, though not  
without much Kefuation, arising from a deference for those ideas,  
the Secretary is upon the whole strongly inclined to the opinion,  
a preference ought to be given to neither of the metal? for the  
money unit ; Perhaps if cither were to h&lt;? preferred, it ought to  
be gold rather than silver.  
The reasons are these—  
  
The inducements to such a preference is to render the unit as  
little variable as poflible, because on this depends the steady value  
of all contrafls, and in a certain fenfeof all other property. And  
it is truly observed, that if the unit belong indiscriminately to  
both the metals, it is fubjt&amp; to all the flu&amp;aiions, that happen in  
the relative value, which they bear to each other : But the fame  
reason would lead to annexiug it to that particular one, which is  
itfelf the least liable to variation ; if there be, in this refpeft, any  
difcernable difference between the two.  
  
Gold may, perhaps, in certain fenles, be said to have greater  
stability than silver : as being ot fup&lt; rior value, less liberties have  
been taken with it, in the regulations of different countries. Its  
standard has remained more uniform, and it has, in oiher refpe&amp;s  
undergone fewer changes : as being not so much an article of  
merchandize, owing to the use made of silver in the trade with the  
Zaft-Indies and China, it is less liable to be influenced by cii­  
cumftances of commercial demand. And if rcafoning by analo­  
gy, it could be affirmed, that there is a physical probability of  
greater proportional encreafe in the quantity of silver, than in that  
of gold, it would afford an additional reason tor calculating on  
greater steadiness in the value of the la ter.  
As long as gold, either from its intnnfic superiority, as a metal,  
from its greater rarity, or from the prejudices of mankind, retains  
so confidcrable a pre-eminence in value, over silver, as it has hi­  
therto had, a natural consequence of this seems to be that its con­  
dition will be more stationary. The revolutions, therefore, which  
may take place, in the comparative value of gold and silver, will  
be changes 111 the state ot the latter, rather than in the state of the  
former.  
  
If there should be an appearance of too much abftra&amp;ion in  
any of these ideas, it may be remarked, that the firft and moll  
simple imprcflions do not naturally incline to giving a preference  
to the inferior or least valuable ot the two metals.  
  
It is fometimcs observed, that silver ought to be encouraged ra­  
ther than gold, as being more conducive to theextenfion of bank  
circulation, trom the greater difficulty and inconvenience which  
its greater bulk, compared with its value, occasions in the trans­  
portation of it. But bank circul tion is defuable, rather as an  
aux-liaryto, than as a substitute for that of the precious metals;  
and ought to be left to its natural courfe—Artificial expedients to  
extend it, by opposing obstacles to the other, are at least not re­  
commended by any very obvious advantages. And in general, it  
is the (ateft rule to regulate every particular institution or obje6&gt;,  
according to the principles, which in n la ion to itfelf, appear the  
moll found. In addition to this, it ma) be observed, that the in.  
convenience of transporting eithe&gt; of the metals, is fufficiently  
great to induce a preference of bi»nk paper, when ever it can be  
made to answer the purpofeequaliy well.  
  
Bui upon the whole, ii seems to be moll advifeable, as has been  
observed, not to attach the unit exclusively to either of the metals ;  
because this cannot be done effc&amp;ually, without destroying the of­  
fice and chara&amp;er ot one of them as money, and reducing it to  
the fnuation of a mere m&#x27;rchandize ; which, accordingly, at  
different times has been propnfed from different and very ref­  
pcdtable quarters; but which would probably be a greater evil  
than occasional variations in the unit, from the flu&amp;uarions in the  
relative value ol the metals, especially it cafe be taken to regu­  
late th proportion between them, with an eye to their average  
commercial value.  
  
To annul the use of either of the metals,fas money, is to abridge;  
the quantity of circulating medium *, and is liable to alltheobje -  
tions, whi&lt; h arifc from a comparison of the benefits of a full, w I  
the evils of a fcantv circulation.  
  
It is not a fatisfaftory answer to fay, that none but the favoured  
metal would in this cafe, find its way into the country, as in ihat  
  
all balances must be paid. The pradticability of this would in  
some mcafure depend on the abundance or scarcity of it, in the  
country paying. Where there was but little, it either would not  
be procurable at all. or it would cost a premium to obtain it—  
which in every cafe of a competition with others,in a branch of trade  
would conlluutea dedu£fciou from the profits of the party receiv­  
ing; perhaps, too, the embari ailments which such a circumllance  
might foinetimes create, in the pecuniary liquidation of balances,  
might lead to additional efforts to fend a substitute in commodi­  
ties, and might lo far impede the introduction of the metals. Nei­  
ther could the exclusion of either of them be deemed, in other re­  
fpe£ls, favourable to commerce. It is often in the course of trade  
as delirable to poflefs the kind of money, as the kind of commo­  
dities bed adapted to a foreign market.  
  
It fcems, however, mast probable that the chief, if not the sole  
effect of such a regulation, would be to diminish the utility of  
one of the Petals. It could hardly prove an obftacleto the intro­  
duflion of that which was excluded, in the natural course of trade;  
because it would always command a ready sale for the purpose of  
exportation to foreign markets. But such an effect, if the only  
ont, is not to be regarded as a trivial inconvenience.  
If then the unit ought not to be attached exclusively to either of  
the metals, the proportion which ought to fubfill between them,  
in the coins, becomes a preliminary enquiry, in order to its proper  
adjustment. This proportion appears to be, in several views, of  
no inconsiderable moment.  
  
One consequence of overvaluing either metal, in refpe&amp; to the  
other, is the banishment of that which is undervalued. If two  
countries ,ire supposed, in one of which the proportion of gold to  
silver is as Ito 16, in the other as Ito 15, gold being worth more,  
lilver less, in one than in the other, it is manifeft, that in their reci­  
procal payments, each will fele&amp; that specie- which it values least,  
to pay to the other, where it is valued molt. Besides this, the  
dealers in money will, from the fame caufc, often find a profitable  
traffic, in an exchange of the metals be:wcen the two count ies.  
And hence, it would come to pass, if other things were equal, that  
the greatelt part of the gold would be colle&amp;ed in one, and the  
greatelt part of the filvcr in the other. The course of trade might  
in some degree counteratt the tendency of the difference in the le­  
gal proportions, by the market value ; but this is fd far and so of­  
ten influenced by the It gal rates, that it does not prevent their pro­  
ducing the effe£t which is inferred. Fa£fcs too verify the infer­  
ence : In Spain and England, where gold is rated higher than in  
other p3rts of Europe, there is a scarcity of silver, while it is found  
to abound in France and Holland, where it is rated higher in pro­  
portion to gold, than in the neighbouring nation. And it is con­  
tinually flowing from Europe toChina andtheEall-Indies,owing to  
the comparative cheapnefsof it in the former, and dearnefs of it  
in the latter.  
  
This consequence is deemed by some not very material ; and  
there are even persons, who from a fanciful predile&amp;ion to gold,  
are willing to invite it, even by a higher price. But general uti­  
lity will best be promoted by a due proportion of both metals.  
If gold be mo&#x27;ft convenient in large payments, silver is best adapted  
to the more minute and ordinary circulation.  
But it is to be fulpetted, that there is another consequence more  
serious than the one which has been mentioned. This is the di­  
minution of the total quantity of specie, which a country would  
naturally poflefe.  
  
It is evident, that as often as a country, which overrates either  
of the metals, receives a payment in that metal, it gets a less a&amp;ual  
quantity than it ought to do, or than it would do, if the rate were  
a juftone.  
  
It is also equally evident that there will be a continual effort to  
make payment to it in that fpccies, to which it has annexed an  
exaggerated estimation, wherever it is current ut a less proportional  
value. And it would seem to be a very natural effect of these tw®  
caufcs, not only that the mass of the precious metals in the country  
in question would consist chiefly ot that kind, to which it had  
given an extraoraina: y value, but that it. would be absolutely less  
than if they had been duly proportioned to each other.  
  
A conclusion of iiii» i, nowcver, is co oc drawn with grca*-  
caution. In such matteis, there arc always fomc local and many  
other particular circumstances, which qualify and vary the opera­  
tion of general principles, even where they are just ; and there are  
endless combinations, very difficult to be analized, which often  
render principles, that have the most plausible pretentions, uufound  
and dclufive.  
  
There ought, for instance, according to those which have been  
stated, to have been formerly a greater quantity ot gold in propor­  
tion to silver in the United States, than there has been; because  
the aflual value of gold in this country, compared wiih silver,  
was perhaps higher than in any other. But our fuuation in legard  
to the Weft-India ifiands, into some ot which there is a large in­  
flux of silver dire6cly from the mines of South America, occasions  
an extraordinary supply of that metal, and confequenily a greater  
proportion of it in our circulation, than might have been expc&amp;ed  
from us iclative value.  
  
What influence the proportion under conhderation may have  
upon the Hate of prices, and how far this may counterafl its ten­  
dency to increase or lei Ten the quantity ot the metals, are points  
not easy to be developed ; and yet they are very neccffary to an  
accurate judgment of the true operation of the thing.  
But however impoflible it may be to pronounce with certainty,  
that the poffeflion of a less quantity of specie is a consequence ot  
overvaluing either of the metals, there is enough of probability in  
the considerations, which ieem to indieate it, to form an argument  
of weight against such overvaluation.  
  
A third ill consequence iefulting from it is, a greater and more  
frequent disturbance of theftateofthe money unit, by a greater  
and more frequent diversity between the legal and market propor­  
tions of the metals. This has not hitherto been cxp:rienced in  
the United States, but it has been experienced elfeivhere : and  
from its not having beeh felt by us hitherto, it dors not follow  
that this will not be the cafe hereafter, when our commerce shall  
have attained a maturity, which will place it under the influence  
ot more fixed principles.  
  
In eftabliftiing a proportion betwec.i the metaL, there seems to  
be an option of one of two things—  
To approach as nearly as it c;n be ascertained, the mean  
or average proportion, in what may be calltd the commercial  
world ; or  
  
To retain that which now exists in the United States. As far  
as these happen to coincide, they will renderthe coarse to be pur­  
sued more plain and more certain.  
  
&quot;Io ascertain the tirft, with precision, would require better ma­  
terials than are poflefied, or than could br obtained, without an  
inconvenient delay. (Ton continued.)

SIR Isaac Newton, in a representation to the Treasury of  
Great-Britain, in the year 1717, after Hating the particular  
proportions in the ditfercnt countries of Europe, concludcs thus  
—u By the course of trade and exchange between nation and na­  
tion, in all Europe, fine gold is to fine silver as 14 4-5 or 15 to 1.&quot;  
But however accurate and decisive this authority maybe deem­  
ed, in relation to the period, to which it applies, it cannot be  
taken, at the diftjnee of more than seventy years, as a rule for de­  
termining the existing proportion. Alterations have been since  
made, in the regulations of their coins by several nations ; which,  
as well as the course of trade, have an influence upon the market  
values. Neverthelcfs, there is reason to believe, that the state of  
the matter, as represented by Sir Isaac Newton, is not very remote  
from its a&amp;ual state.  
  
In Holland, the greatest money market of Europe, gold was to  
silver in Decembei 1789, as 1 to 14.88 ; and in that of London it  
has been for some time pad but Utile different, approaching per­  
haps, something nearer 1 to 15.  
11 has been seen, that the existing proportion, between the two  
metals in this country, is about as 1 to 15.  
It is fortunate in thii refpeft, that the innovations of the Span­  
ish mint have imperceptibly introduced a proportion so analo­  
gous, as this is, to that which prevails among the principal com­  
mercial nations ; as it greatly facilitates a proper regulation of  
the matter.  
  
This proportion of 1 to 15 is recommended by the particular  
situation of our trade, as being very nearly that which obtains in  
thi market of Gieat-Britain, to which nation our specie is princi­  
pally exported. A lower rate for either of the metals, in our  
market, than in theirs, might not only afford a motive the more in  
certain cases to remit in specie rather than in commodities ; but it  
might in some others, cause us to pay a greater quantity of it for a  
given sum, than we (hould otherwise do. If the effect Qiould ra­  
ther be to occasion a premium to be given for the metal, which  
was under-rated, this would obviate those disadvantages ; but it  
&quot;would involve another, a cuftrtmary difference between the market  
arid legal proportions, which would amount to a species of dis­  
order in the national coinage.  
Looking forward to the payments of interest hereafter to be  
made to Hollond, the fame proportion does not appear ineligible.  
Ihe present legal proportion in the coins of Holland, is dated at  
Ito 14 9-10. That ot the market varies somewhat at different  
times, but (eldom very widely from this point.  
There can hardly be a better rule, in any country, for the legal,  
than the market proportion ; if this can be supposed to have been  
produced by the free and ftcady course of commcrcial principles!  
The presumption, in such cafe, is, that each metal finds its true  
level, according to its intrinsic utility, in the general system of  
money operations.  
  
But it must be admitted, that this argument in favor of continu­  
ing the existing proportion, is not applicable to the state of the  
coins with us. There have been too many artificial and heteroge­  
neous ingredients, too much want of order in the pecuniary tranf­  
a&amp;ions ot this country, to authorise the attributing the effedls,  
which have appeared, to the regular operations ot commerce. A  
proof of this is to be drawn from the alterations, which havehao­  
pened in the proportion between the metals merely by the succes­  
sive degradations ot the dollar, in confcquence of the mutability  
of a foreign mint. The value of gold to silver appears to have de­  
clined, wholly from this cause, from 15 6-10 to about 15 to i.  
Yet as this last proportion, however produced, coincides so nearly  
with what may be deemed the commercial average, it may be  
supposed to furnilh as good a rule as can be pursued.  
The only question seems to be, whether the value of gold   
rot to be a little lowered to bring it to a more exadl level with  
the two markets which have been mentioned. But as the ratio  
of Ito is so nearly conformable to the (late of thofc markets,  
and best agrees with that of our own, it will probably be found  
the mod eligible. If the market of Spain continues to give a  
higher value to gold (as it has done in time past) than that which  
is recommcndcd, there may be fomc advantage in a middle sta­  
tion.  
  
A further prelimiuary to the adjuflment of the fu ure money  
unit, is to determine what shall be the proportion and composition  
of alloy in each species of the coins.  
The firft, by the lefolution of the Bth of August, 1786, before  
referred to, is regulated at one twelfth, or in other words, at 1 part  
alloy to 11 parts fine, whether gold or silver; which appears to be  
a convenient rule ; unless there should be some collateral confe­  
deration, which may di&amp;ate a departure from ir. Itscorrefpon­  
dencv, in regard to both metals, is a recommendation of it, be­  
cause a difference could answer no purpose of pecuniary or com­  
mercial utility, and uniformity is favorable to order.  
This ratio, as it regards gold, coincides with the proportion,  
real or profefTed, in the coins of Portugal, England, France and  
Spain. In those of the two former it is real, in those of the two  
latter there is a deduction for what is callcd remedy of weight and  
alloy, which is in the nature of an allowance to the matter of the  
mint for errors and imperfettions in the process; rendering the  
coin either lighter or baler than it ought to be. The fame thing  
is known in the theory of the English mint, where 1-6 of a carat  
is allowed. But the difference seems to be, that there, it is merely  
an occasional indemnity within a certain limit, for real and una­  
voidable errors and imperfections; whereas in the pra&amp;ice of the  
mints of France and Spain, it appears to amount to a ftatcd and  
regular deviation from the nominal standard. Accordingly the  
real standards of France and Spain are something worse than 22  
carat? or 11 parts in 12 fine.  
  
The principal gold coins in Germany, Holland, Sweden, Den­  
mark, Poland and Italy, are finer than those of England and Por­  
tugal in different degrees from 1 carat and 1-4 to 1 carat and 7-8,  
which last is within 1-8 of a carat of pure gold.  
There are similar diverfuies in the standards of the silver coins  
of the different countries of Europe. That of Great-Britain is 222  
parts fine to 18 alloy: those of the other European nations vary  
from that of Great-Britain as widely as from about 17 of the fame  
paits better to 75 worse.  
  
The principal reasons assigned for the use of alloy, are the sav­  
ing of expence in the refining of the metals (which in their natural  
Hate are usually mixed with a portion of the coarser kinds) and  
the rendering of them harder as a security againd 100 great wade  
by friction and wearing—The firlt real&#x27;on, drawn from the origi­  
nal composition of the metals, is ftrcngthcned at present by the  
pra&amp;ice of alloying their coins, which has obtained among so  
many nations. The reality of the effect, to which the lad leafon  
is applicable, has been denied, and experience has been appealed  
to as proving, that the more alloyed coins wear fafter than the  
purer. &quot; The true date of this matter may be worthy of future in­  
vestigation, though fird appearances are in favor of alloy. In the  
mean time, the saving of trouble and expence are fufficient induce­  
ments to following those examples which suppose its expediency.  
And the fame considerations lead to taking as our models those na­  
tions with whom we have most inlcrcourfe, and whose coins are  
mod prevalent in our circulation : These are Spain, Portugal,  
England and France. The relation which the proposed propor­  
tion bears to their gold coins, has been explained. In refpeft tc  
their silver coins, it will not be very remote from the mean of their  
leveral ftjndords.  
  
The component ingredients of the alloy in each metal will also  
require to be regulated. In silver, copper is the onlv kind in use.  
and it is doubtless the only proper one. In gold, there is a mix­  
ture of Over and copper ; in the Englifli coins confiding of eqaal  
  
(continued.)  
  
parts, in the coins of some countries varying fiom 1-3 to 2-3  
silver.  
  
The reason ot this union of filvcr with copper is this—The sil­  
ver countrra&amp;s the tendency of the copper to injure the color or  
beauty of the coin, by giving it too much redness, or rather a cop­  
pery hue ; which a small quantity will produce; and the copper  
prevents the too great whiteness, which silver alone would confer.  
It is apprehended,that there are considerations, which may render  
it prucent to establisH by law, that the proportion of silver to cop­  
per in the gold coins of the United States (hall not be more than  
one halt, nor less than one third ; verting a discretion in some pro­  
per place to regulate the matter within those limits, as experience  
in the execution may recommend.  
A third point remains to bedil&#x27;cu(Ted, as a pre-requifite to the  
determination of the money unit, which is, whether the e*pence  
of coining (hall be defrayed by the public, or out of the material  
itfeif ; or, as it is sometimes stated, whether coinage (hall be free,  
or (hall be lubjeft to a duty or impofuion ? This forms, perhaps,  
one of the nicest questions in the do&amp;rine of money.  
The p raft ice ot different nations is difllmilar in this particular.  
In England, coinage is said to be entirely free : the mint price  
of the metals in bullion, being the fame with the value of them  
in coin. In France there is a duty which has been, if it is not  
now, eight per cent. In Holland there is a difference between  
the &quot;j10* price and the value in the coins, which has been com­  
puted at .96, or fometbing less than one per cent, upon gold ; at  
1.48, or something less than one and a half per cent, upon silver.  
The resolution of the Bth of August, 1786, proceeds upon the idea  
of a deduction of half per cent, from gold, and of two per cent,  
from silver, as an indemnification for the expence of coining.  
This is inferrea from a report of the late board of treasury, upon  
which that resolution appears to have been founded.  
Upon the supposition that the expence of coinage ought to be  
defrayed out of the metals, there are two ways in which it may  
beeffeaed ; one by a reduction of the quantity of fine gold and  
silver in the coins ; the other by establishing a difference between  
the value of those metals, in the coins, and the mint price of them  
in bullion.  
  
The firft method appears to the Secretary inadmissible. He is  
unable to diftinguifli an operation of this fort, from that of raising  
thedenomination of the coin ; a measure which has been difapt  
proved of by the wisest men of the nations in which it has been  
praftifed, and condemned by the reft of the world. To declare  
that a less weight of gold or silver (hall pass for the fame sum,  
which before represented a greater weight, or to ordain that the  
fame weight (hall pass for a greater sum, are things substantially  
of one nature. The consequence of either of them, if the change  
can be realized, is to degrade the money unit ; obliging creditors  
to receive less than their just dues—and&#x27; depreciating property of  
every kind : for it is manifeft, that every thing would in this cafe  
be represented by a lels quantity of gold and silver, than before.  
It is fometmies observed on this head, that though any article  
of property might in fa£l be represented by a less a&amp;ual quantity  
of pure metal, it would nevertheless be represented by fomethin°r  
of the fame intrinsic value. Every fabric, it is remarked, is worth  
intrinsically, the price of the raw material and the expence of  
fabrication; a truth not left applicable to a piece of coin, than to  
a yard of cloth.  
  
This position, well founded in itfelf, is here misapplied. It  
fuppofcs that the coins now in circulation, are to be considered as  
bullion, or in other words, as a raw material. But the fa6t is,  
that the adoption of them, as money, has caused them to become  
the fabric. It has inverted them with the chara&amp;cr and office of  
coins, and has given them a fan&amp;ion and efficacy equivalent to that  
of the stamp ol the sovereign. The prices of all our commodities,  
at home and abroad, and of all foreign commodities in our  
markets, have f«und their level, in conformity to this principle.  
The foreign coins may be divejled of the privileges they have hi­  
therto been permitted to enjoy, and may of course be left to find  
their value in the markets as a raw material. But the quantity of  
gold and silver in the national coins, corresponding with a given  
sum, cannot be made lefsthan heretofore, without disturbing the  
balance of intrinsic value; and making every acre of land, a. well  
as every bushel of wheat, of less actual worth than in time past.  
If the UuitedStates were insulated, and cut off from all intcrcourle  
with the reft of mankind, this reasoning would not be equally  
conclusive. But it appears decisive, when considered with a view  
to the relations, which commerce has created between us and other  
countries.  
  
It is however not improbable, that the effect meditated would  
be defeated by a rife of prices proportioned to the diminution of  
the intrinsic value of the coins. This might be looked for in every  
enlightened commercial country ; but perhaps innone with great­  
er certainty than this ; because, in none are men less liable lo be  
ihe dupes of founds—in none has authority so little resource for  
lubituuting names to things.  
A general revolution in prices, though only nominally, and in  
appearance, could not fail to diftraft the ideas of the community,  
and would be apt to breed discontents as well among all those  
who live on the income of their money, as among the poorer claf­  
fesof the people, to whom the necessaries of life would fecm to  
have become dearer. In the confufion of such a state of things  
laeas ofvalue would not improbably adhere to the old coins&#x27;  
which from that circumftancc, inflead of feeling the efteft of the  
lofsof their privileges as money, would perhaps bear a price in  
the markets relatively to the new ones, in exafl proportion to  
weight. The frequency of the demand for the metals to pay fo­  
reign balances would contribute to thiseffefcf.  
  
Among the evils, attendant on such an operation, are these   
creditors both ot the public and of individuals would lose a part  
ot their property—public and private credit would reccivea wound  
--the cffeftive revenues of the government would be dimiiufhed  
There is scarcely any point, in the economy of national affairs of  
greater moment, than the uniform preservation of the intrinsic  
value ot the money unit. On this the security and ftcady value  
or property eflentially depend.  
  
The second method, therefore, of defraying the expence of the  
coinage out of the metals, is greatly to be prefercd to Ihe other.  
This is to let the fame sum of money continue to represent in the  
new coins exactly the fame quantity of gold and silver, as it doe­  
in those now current—to allow at the mint such a price only for  
thcfemetals as will admit ot profit just fufficient to fatisfy the ex­  
pence ot coinage—to abolilh the legal currency of foreign coins,  
both in public and private payments—and of courfc to leave the  
superior-utility of the national coins, for domestic purposes to  
operate the difference of market value, which is neceflary to&#x27;in  
duce the bringing of bullion to the mint. In this cafe, all pro­  
perty and labour willftill be reprefcnted by the fame quantity of  
gold and silver, as formerly ; and the only change which will  
be wrought, willconfifl in annexing the office of &#x27;money exclu­  
hvely to the national coins ; confequer.tly, withdrawing it from  
thole of foreign countries, and fuffering them to become, as they  
ought to be, mete articles of merchandize.  
  
The arguments in favor of a regulation of this kind are—First  
hat the want of it is a cause of extra expence : there being then&#x27;  
no motive of individual interest to distinguish between the national  
coins and bullion, they are, ,t is alleged, indiscriminately melted  
down, for domestic manufaaures, and exported for the purposes  
of foreign trade; and it is added that when the coins become light  
by wear,ng the fame quantity of fine gold or f.lver bears a higher  
price ,n bullion than the coins; in wh.cH state of things the  
mehmg down of the coins to be fold as bullion is attended with  
proht; and from both-caufcs the expence of the mint, or in other  
words, the expence nf maintaining the specie capital of thenaliou,  
is materially augmented. &#x27;  
  
Secondly—That the existence of such a regulation promotes a  
favorable course of exchange, and benefits trade, not only by: that  
  
756  
  
circumfiance, but by obliging foreigners, in certain cases, to pay  
dearer for domestic commodities, and to fell their own cheaper. &#x27;  
As far as relates to the tendency of a tree coinagc to produce an  
encreafeof expence, in the different ways that have been stated.  
the argument mud be allowed to have foundation, both in reason  
and experience. It describes what has been exemplified in  
Great-Britain.  
  
The effc£l of giving an artificial value to bullion, is not at firft  
fight obvious ; but it adually happened at the period immediately  
preceding the late reformation, in the gold coin of the country  
just named. A pound troy in gold bullion of ftandaid finenefs,  
was then from 19s. 6d. to 255. fterl. dearer than an equal weight  
of guineas, as delivered at the mint. The phenomenon is thus  
accounted for—the old guineas were more than two per cent,  
lighter than theirJlandari weight. This weight therefore, in bul­  
lion, was truly worth two pet cent, more than those guineas. It  
confcquently had in rcfpe£l to them, a correfpondcnt rife in the  
market.  
  
And as guineas were then current by tale, the new one-, as they  
issued from the mint, were confounded in circulation with the old  
ones ; and by the association, were deprecated below the intrinsic  
value, in comparison with bullion. It became of coui fe a profita­  
ble traffic to fell bullion for coin, to feleft the light pieces, and re­  
ilTuc them in currency, and to melt down the heavy ones, and fell  
them again as bullion. This pra&amp;ice, besides other inconvenien­  
cics, coil the government large funis, in the renewal ot the coins.

Report of the Secretary &lt;&gt;f the Treasury, on the  
subject of a Mint-.*  
B , * ONI 11 N u cd.;  
T the remainder ot the argument (lands upon ground far  
more qu&lt; iii&amp;oable. It dcu.* nds upon vt rv numerous and very  
complex combinations ; io which there 15 infinite la-uuc&#x27;e lor fal­  
lacy and error.  
  
i he raoft plaulible part of it rs that Which relates to the- course  
°&#x27; c*change. Experience, in France, has (hewn, that the ma.kjt  
price of bullion has been influenced by the mint difference, be­  
tween that and coin ; some times to the full extent of the difference;  
and it will seem to be a clear inference, that whenever that dif­  
ference materially exceeded the charges of remitting bullion,  
fiom the country where it exifled, to another in which coinage  
was free, exchange would be in favor of the former.  
If, for instance, the balance of trade, between France and En­  
gland, any time equal, their merchants would naturally  
liave reciprocal payments to make to an equal amount ; which  
asufual would be liquidated by means ot bills of .exchange. If  
m this fnuation, if the diilercnce between coin and bullion Ihould  
be in the market, as at the mint of France, 8 per cent; if also the  
charges ot transporting money from France to England ihould  
not be above 2 per cenr.; and if exchange fliouid be at par, it is  
evident, that a profit of 6 per cent, might be made, by fending  
bullion from Fiance to England and drawing bills for the amount.  
One hundred louis d&#x27;ors in coin would purchase the weight of  
icß in bullion ; one hundred of which remitted to England would  
fuffice to pay a debt of an equal amount : and two being paid for  
the charges of insurance and transportation, there would remain  
fix for the benefit of the person who Ihould manage the negocia­  
tion. But asfo large a profit could not fail to produce competi­  
tion, the bills in confequcnce of this would decrease in price, till  
the profit was reduced to the minimum of an adequate recoinpence  
for the trouble and rifle. And as the amount of 100 louis d&#x27;ors,  
in England, might be afforded for 96 in France, with a profit of  
morethan 1 and 1-2 percent, bills upon England might fall in  
I ranee to 4 per cent, below par ; one per cent, being a fufficient  
profit to the exchanger or broker for the management of the bu­  
siness.  
  
But it is admitted that this advantage is loft, when the balance  
of trade is against tlie nation ; which impofej the duty in qutUion ;  
because by encreafing thedemand for bullion, it brings this to a  
par with the coins : and it is to be ftifpetted, that where com­  
mercial principles have their free fcopc, and are well understood,  
the market difference between the metals in coin and bullion will  
ieldom approximate to that of the mint, if the latter be eonfider­  
able. It must be not a little difficult to keep the money of the  
world, which can be employed to an equal purpose, in the com­  
merce of the world, in a flateof degradation, in comparison with  
the money of a particular country.  
This alone would seem fufficient to prevent it : whenever the  
price of coin to bullion, in the market, materially exceeded the  
par of the metals, it would become an object to fend the bullion  
abroad; if not to pay a foreign balance, to be inverted in some  
other way, in foreign countries, where it bore a superior value :  
an operation, by which immense fortunes might be ama fled, if it  
were not, that the exportation of the bullion would of itfelf restore  
the intrinsic par. But as it would naturally have this effect, the  
advantage supposed would contain in itfelf the principle of its  
own deftru&amp;ion. As long however as the exportation of bullion  
could be made with profit, which is as long as exchange could re­  
main below par, there would be a diain of the gold and silver of  
the country.  
  
If any thing can maintain for a length of time a material dif­  
ference, between thevalue of the metals in coin and in bullion, it  
must be a constant and considerable balance of trade, in favor of  
the country in which it is maintained. In one situated like the  
United States, it would in all probability be a hopeless attempt.  
The frequent demand for gold ana silver, to pay balances to fo­  
reigners, would tend powerfully to preserve the equilibrium of  
intrinsic value.  
  
The profpfft is, that it would occasion foreign coins, to circu­  
late by common consent, nearly at par with the national.  
To fay, that as lar as the effe£l of lowering exchange is produ­  
ced, though it be only occasional and momentary, there is a bene­  
fit the more thrown into the scale of public prosperity, is not fa­  
tisfaftory. It has been seen, that it may be productive of one  
evil, the investment of a part of the national capital in foreign  
countries ; which can hardly be beneficial, but in a situation like  
that of the United Netherlands ; where an immense capital and a  
decrease of internal demand render it necessary to find employ­  
ment for money, in the wants of other nations : and, perhaps, on  
a close examination, other evils may be descried.  
One allied to that, which has been mentioned, is this—Taking  
France, for the fake of more concise illustration, as the scene.  
VI hfnever it happens that French louis d&#x27;ors are sent abroad, from  
whatever cause, there be a considerable difference between  
coin, and bullion, in the market of France, it will constitute an  
advantageous traffic to fend back these louis d&#x27;ors and bring away  
bullion, in lieu of them ; upon all of which exchanges, France  
must sustain an actual loss of a part of its gold and silver.  
Again, such a difference between coin and bullion may tend to  
countera£l a favorable balance of trade. Whenever a foreign  
merchant is thecarrier of his own commodities to France, for  
sale, he has a ffrong inducement to bring back specie, instead of  
Trench commodities ; because avrcturn in the latter may affo d no  
profit, may even be attended with loss ; in the former, it will af­  
ford a certain profit. The fame principle muff be supposed to  
operate in the general course of remittances, from France to other  
countries. The principal question with a merchant naturally is  
In what manner can I realize a given sum, with mod advan­  
tage, where I wifli to place it? And, in cases, in which other  
commodities are not likely to produce equal profit with bullion,  
it may be expedled that this will be preferred ; to which the  
greater certainty attending the operation, muff be an additional  
incitement. There can hardly be imagined a circumstance, less  
friendly to trade, than the existence of an extra inducement, ari­  
sing from the possibility of a profitable speculation, upon the ar­  
ticles themselves, to export from a country its gold and silver, ra­  
ther than the produ&amp;s of its land and labour.  
  
The other advantages supposed, of obliging foreigners to pay  
dearer for domestic commodities, and to fell their own cheaper,  
are applied to a situation, which includes a favorable balance of  
trade. It is understood in this sense—The prices of domestic  
commodities (such at lead as arc peculiar to the country) remain  
attached to ttye denominations of the coins—When a favorable  
balance of trade realizes in the market the mint difference be­  
tween coin and bullion, foreigners, who must pay in the latter,  
are obliged to give more of it for such commodities, than they  
otherwise would do. Again, the bullion, which is now obtained  
at a cheaper rate in the home market, will procure the fame quan­  
tity of goods in the foreign market, as before; which is said to  
render foreign commodities cheaper. In this reasoning, much  
fallacy is to be fufpe&amp;ed *—If it betrue, that foreigners pay more  
for domestic commodities, it must be equatlv true, that they get  
more for their own, when they bring them themlelvts to market.  
If peculiar, or other domestic commodities, adhere to the denomi­  
nations of the coins, no reason occurs why foreign commodities of  
a like chara&amp;e/, (hould not do the fame thing.—And in this cafe,  
the foreigner, though he receive only the fame value in coin for  
his merchandize, as formerly, can convert it into greater quantity  
of bullion. Whence the nation is liable to lose more of its wold  
and silver, than if their intrinsic value in relation to the coins,were  
preserved. And whether the gain or the loss, will on the whole  
preponderate, would appear to depend on the comparative propor­  
tion of active commerce of the one country with the other.

Report of the Secretary of the Treasury, on the  
subject of a  
(continued.^  
IT is cvide; *, ?lfo, that the nation mult p*v as much gold and  
silver as before, for the commoditir-s which it procures abroad;  
and whether it obtains this gold and cheaper, or not, turns  
upon the solution of the question just intimated, refp fling the re­  
lative proportion of active commerce, between the two countries.  
Besides these considerations, it is admitted in the reasoning,  
that the advantages supposed, which depend on a favorable ba­  
lance of traie, have a tendency to affe£l that balance difadvan­  
tageoufly. Foreigners, it is allowed, will in th s cafe, seek some  
other vent for their commodities, and some other r.ia:ket, where  
they can supply their W2pts at an ealier rate. A tendency of tics  
kind, if real, would be a fufficient objettion to the regulation.  
Nothing which contributes to change a beneficial current of trade,  
ran well compen&#x27;ate, bv particular advantage?, for so injurious  
an effeffc It is far more easy to transfer trade, from a less to a  
moie favorable channel, than when once transferred, to bring it  
back to its old one. Every source of artificial interruption to an  
advantageous current is, therefore, cautiously to be avoided.  
It merits attention, that the able minister, who lately and so  
long presided over the finances of France, docs not attribute to  
the duty of coinage, in that country, any particular advantages,  
in relation to exchange 2nd trade. Though he rather appears an  
advocate for it, &#x27;tis on the sole ground of the revenue it afford?,  
which he represents, as in the nature of a very moderate duty on  
the general mass of exportation.  
And it is not improbable, that to the singular felicity of situa­  
tion of that kingdom, is to be attributed its not having been sen­  
sible of the evils which seem incident to the reguiation. There is  
perhaps no part of Europe, which has so little need of other coun­  
tries, as France. variety of foils and climates,  
an immense population, its agriculture in » state of mature im­  
provement, it poflefles within its own bosom. most, if not all thr  
productions of the earth, which any of its most favored neighbors  
can boast. The variety, abundance and excellcnce of its wines,  
constitute a peculiar advantage in its favor. Arts and manufac­  
tures are&#x27;there al(o in a very advanced state—some of them of con­  
siderable importance, in higher perfection than elsewhere. Its  
contiguity to Spain, the intimate nature of its connexion with  
that country ; a country with few fabrics of its own, consequently  
numerous wants, and the principal leceptacle of the tretfures ol  
thenow world. Thefecircumftances concur, in fecuringto France,  
so uniform, and so considerable a balance of trade, as in a great  
measure to counterafl the natural tendency of any errors, which  
may txift in the system of a mint; and to render inferences from  
the operation of that system there, in reference to this country,  
more liable to mislead than to inftruft. Nor ought it to pass un­  
noticed, that with all these advantages, th -government of France  
has found it necefTary, on some occasions, to employ very violent  
methods to comp 1 Jthe bringing of bullion to the mint ; a circum­  
stance, which affords a strong presumption of the inexpediency of  
the regulation, and of the impra&amp;icability of executing it in the  
United States.  
  
  
This point has been the longer dwelt upon, not only because  
there is a divcrfity of opinion among speculative men concerning­  
it, and a diversity in the pra£lice c&gt;f the most considerable com­  
mercial nations-; but becaulcthe atts of our own government, un­  
der the confederation, have not only admitted the expediency o&gt;  
defraying the expence of coinage out of the metals themselves ;  
but upon this icta have both mad .&lt; deduction from the weight  
of the coins, and established a difference between thtir regulated  
value and &#x27;.he mint price of bullion greater than would result from  
that deduction. This double operation in favor of a principle so  
quefttonable in itfelf, has made a more particular investigation of  
it a duty.  
  
The intention,however,of the preceeding remarks,is rather to (hew  
that the expe&amp;ation cf commercial advantages ought not to decide  
in favor of a duty of coinage, and that if it fiiould be adopted, it  
ought not to be in the form of a deduction from the intrinsic value  
of the coins—than abfoliaely to exclude the idea of any difference  
•whatevqr, between the value of the metals in coin and in bullion.  
It is not clearly discerned, that a small difference between the  
m int price of bullion, and the regulated value of the coins, would  
be pernicious, or that it might not even be advisable, in the firft  
instance, by way of experiment, merely as a preventative to the  
melting down and exportation of the coins. This will now be  
somewhat more particularly considered.  
  
The arguments for a coinage, entirely freeware, that itpreferves  
the intrinsic value of the metals ; that it makes the expence of fa­  
brication a general inftiead of a partial tax ; and that it tends to  
promote the abundance of gold and silver, which it is alledged  
■will flow to that place, where they find the belt price, and from  
that place, where the) are in any degree undervalued.  
The firft consideration has not much weight, as an obje&amp;ion to  
a plan, which, without diminishing the quantity of metals, in the  
coins, merely allows a less price for them in the bullion at the na­  
tionnl factory or mint. No rule of intrinsic value is violated, by  
considering the raw materials, as worth less than the labric, in pro­  
portion to the expence of fabrication. And by divesting foreign  
coins of the privilege of circulating as money, they become the  
raw material.  
  
The lecond confederation has perhaps greater weight. But ii  
may not amount to an obje£lion, if it be the best method of pre­  
venting disorders in the coins, which it is in a particular manner  
the interest of those, on whom the tax would fall, to prevent.  
The practice of taking gold by weight, which has of late years ob­  
tained in Great-Britain, has bcCn found, in some degree,a remedy;  
but this is inconvenient, and may on that account fall into disuse.  
Another circumstance has made a remedial operation. This is,  
the delays of the mint. It apppears to be the practice there, not  
to make payment for the bullion, which is bronght to be ex­  
changed for coin, till it cither has in fatt, or is pretended to have  
undergone the process of Tecoining.

REPORT of the SECRETARY of the TRE A-  
SU RYT on the Subject of a MINT.  
  
The SECRETARY of the TREASURY having attentively cun-  
fidered the fubjett referred to him, by the order of the House of Re-  
PRESENTATIVES of the the fifteenth day of April laff, relatively to the  
Eftabiifhment of a MINT, moft refpeltfully fubmits the refult of  
  
bis enquiries and reficGions.  
  
PLAN for an eftablifhment of this nature involves a great variety of confiders  
  
ations, intricate, nice, and important. ‘The general ftate of debtor and cre-  
ditor; all the relations and confequences of price ; the effential interefts of trade  
and induftry; the value of all property; the whole income of the ftate and of indi-  
viduals, are liable to be fenfibly influenced, beneficially, or otherwife, by the judicious,  
or injudicious regulation of this interefting obje@.  
  
It is one likewife, not more neceffary than difficult to be rightly adjufted; one  
which has frequently occupied the reflections and refearches of politicians, witheut  
having harmonifed their opinions on one of the moft important of the principles  
which enter inte its difeufon. Accordingly, different fyftems continue to be advo-  
cated, and the fyftems of different nations, after much inveftigation, continue to dif-  
fer from each other.  
  
But if a right adjuftment of the matter be truly of fuch nicety and difficulty, a  
queftion naturally arifes, whether it may not be moft advifeable to leave things, in  
this refpec&amp;t, in the ftate in which they are ? Why, might it be afked, fince they have  
fo long proceeded in a train, which has caufed no general fenfation of inconvenience,  
fhould alterations be attempted, the precife effect of which cannot with certainty be  
calculated ?  
  
The anfwer to this queftion is not perplexing —The immenfe diforder which ac-  
tually reigns in fo delicate and important a concern, and the ftill greater diforder  
which is every moment poflible, call loudly fer a reform. The dollar, originally con-  
templated in the money tranfactions of this country, by fucceflive diminutions of its  
weight and finenefs, has fuftained a depreciation of 5 per cent. Aad yet the new  
dollar has a currency in all payments in place ef the old, with fcarcely any attention  
to the difference between them. The operation of this in depreciating the valve  
of property, depending upon paft contraéts, and (as far as inattention to the altera-  
tion in the coin may be fuppofed to leave prices ftationary) of all other property, is  
apparent. Nor can it require argument to prove, that a nation ought not to fuffer  
the value of the property of its citizens to fluctuate with the fluctuations of a foreign  
mint, and to change with the changes in the regulations of a foreign fovcreign. ‘This,  
neverthelefs, is the condition of one, which having no coins of its own, adopts with  
  
~ implicit confidence thofe of other countries.  
  
The unequal values allowed in different parts of the Union to coins of the fame  
intrinfic worth; the defective fpecies of them, which embarraffes the circulation of  
fome of the ftates; and the diflimilarity in their feveral monies of account, are incon-  
veniences, which if not to be afcribed to the want of a national coinage, will at leaft  
be moft effeQually remedied by the eftablifhment of one ; a meafure that will at the  
  
fame time give additional fecurity againft impofitions, by counterfeit as well as by  
hafe currencies.

It was with great reafon, therefore, that the attention of Congrefs, under the Jate  
confederation, was repeatedly drawn to the eftablifhment of a mint; and it is with  
equal reafon that the fubject has been refumed; now that the favourable chan  
which has taken place in the fituation of public affairs, admits of its being carried in-  
to execution.  
  
But though the difficulty of devifing a proper eftablifhment ought not to deter  
from undertaking fo neceflary a work; yet it cannot but infpire diffidence in one,  
whofe duty it is made, to propofe a plan for the purpofe, and may perhaps be per-  
mitted to be relied upon as fome excufe for any errors which may be chargeable upon  
it, or for any deviations from founder principles, which may have been fuggefted  
by others, or even in part acted upon by the former government of the United  
States.  
  
In order toa right judgment of what ought to be done, the following particulars  
require to be difcuffed.  
  
1. What ought to be the nature of the money unit of the United States?  
  
Il. What the proportion between gold and filver, if coins of both metals are to be  
eftablifhed ?  
  
Ill. What the proportion and compofition of alloy in each kind?  
  
IV. Whether the expence of coinage fhall be defrayed by the government, or out  
of the material itfelf ?  
  
V. What hall be the number, denominations, fizes, and devices of the coins?  
  
VI. Whether foreign coins fhall be permitted to be current or not; if the former,  
at what rate, and for what period?  
  
A pre-requifite to determining with propriety, what ought to be the money unit of  
the United States, is to endeaveur to form as accurate an idea as the nature of the cafe  
will admit of what it aQually is. The pound, though of various value, isthe unit  
in the money of account of all the ftates. But it isnot equally eafy to pronounce  
what is to be confidered as the unit in the coins. There beingno formal regulation  
on the point (the refolutions of Congrefs of the 6th. of July, 1785, and 8th. of  
Auguft, 1786, having never yet been carried into operation) it can only be inferred  
from ufage or practice. The manner of adjufting foreign exchanges, would feem  
to indicate the dollar as beft entitled to that charaGter. Ih thefe, the old piafter of  
Spain ; or old Seville piece of eight rials, of the walue of four shillings and fix pence  
fterling, is evidently contemplated. The computed par between Great-Britain and  
Pennfylvania, will ferve asan example. According to that, one hundred pounds  
fterling is equal to one hundred and fixty-fix pounds and two thirds of a pound Penn-  
{fylvania currency ; which correfponds with the proportion between four fhillings and  
fix pence fterling, and feven fhillings and fix pence the current value of the dollar in  
that ftate, by invariable u/agee And, as far asthe information of the Secretary goes,  
the fame comparifon holds in the other ftates. |  
  
But this circumftance in favour of the dollar, lofes much of its weight from two  
eonfiderations. That fpecies of coin has never had any fettled or ftandard value, ac-  
cording to weight or finenefs,

s not lefs than 24 grains in a dollar, of the fame weight  
and age; which istoo much for any probable differences in the pieces. .t js rather  
to be prefumed that a degree of inaccuracy has been occafioned by the want of proper  
apparatus, and in general, of practice. The experiment which appears to have the  
beit pretenfions to exactnefs, would make the new dollarto contain 370 grains and  
- 933 thoufandth parts of a grain of pure filver.  
  
According to an authority, on which the Secretary places reliance, the Randard of  
Spain for its filver coin in the year 1761, was 261 parts fine and 27 parts alloy ; at  
which proportion, a dollar of 17 dwt. 8 grains would confift of 377 grains of fine fil-  
ver, and 39 grains of alloy : But there is no queftion that this ftandard has been fince  
altered confiderably for the worfe; to what precife point is not as weil afcertained as  
could be wifhed; but from a computation of the value of dollars in the markets both  
of Amfterdam and London (a criterion which cannvut materially miflead) the new dol-  
lar appears to contain 368 grains of fine filver, and that which immediately preceded  
it about 374 grains.  
  
In this itate of things, there is fome difficulty in defining the dollar, which is to be  
underftood as conftituting the prefent money unit ; on the fuppolition of its being  
moft applicable to that {pecies of coin. The old Seville piece of 386 grains and 15  
mites fine, comports beft with the computations of foreign exchanges, and with the  
more ancient contracts refpecting landed property; but far the greater number of  
contracts ftill in operation concerning that kind of property, and all thofe of a mere-  
ly perfonal nature, now in force, muit be referred to a dollar of a different kind. ‘The  
actual dollar at the time of contracting is the only one which can be fuppofed to have  
been intended, and it has been feen, that as leng ago as the year 1761, there had been  
a material degradation of the ftandard. And even in regard to the more ancient  
contracts, no perfon has ever had any idea of a {cruple about receiving the dollar of  
the day, as a full equivalent for the nominal fum, which the dollar originally im-  
  
ed.  
A recurrence therefore to the ancient dollar would be, in the greateft gumber of  
cafes, an innovation in /2¢, and in all, an innovation in refpect to opinion. The ac-  
tual dollar, in common circulation, has evidently a much better claim to be regarded  
as the aGtual money unit.  
  
The mean intrinfic value of the different kinds of known dollars has been iatimated  
as affording the proper criterion. But when it is recollected, that the more ancient  
and more valuable ones are not now to be met with at all in circulation, and that the  
mafs of thofe generally current is compofed of the neweft and moit inter or kinds, it  
will be perceived, that even an equation of that nature would be a confidcrable inno-  
vation upon the real prefent ftate of things; which it will certainly be prudent to ap-  
gaan far as may be confiftent with the permanent order, defigned to be introduc-  
  
An additional reafon for confidering the prevailing dollar, as the ftandard of the  
prefent money unit, rather than the ancient one is, that it will not only be conforma-  
ble to the true exifting proportion between the two metals in this country, but will be  
more conformable to that which obtains in the commercial world, generally.  
  
The difference eftablithed by cuftom in the United States between coined gold and  
coined filver, has been ftated upon another occafion, to be nearly as rto 15.6. ‘This,  
if truly the cafe, would imply that gold was extremely overvalued in the United  
States; for the higheft ual proportioa in any part of Europe, very little, if at all, ex-  
ceeds ito 15: and the average proportion throughout Europe is probably not more  
than about x to 14 4-5. But that ftatement has proceeded upon the idea of the ancient  
dollar. One penny-weight of gold of 22 carrats fine at 6s. 8d. and the old Seville  
piece of 386 grains and 15 mitesof pure filver at 7s. 6d, furnifh the exact ratio of £  
tors.6262. But this does not coincide with the real difference between the metals,  
in our market, or, which is with us the fame thing, in our currency. To determine  
  
» the quantity of fine filver in the genera] mafs of the dollars now m circulation,  
mutt afford the rule. Taking the rate of the late dollar of 374 grains, the propor-  
tion would be as 1 to 15.11—Taking the rate of the neweft dollar, the proportion  
Would then be as 1 to 14.87. The mean of the two would give the proportion of 1  
#15 very nearly ; lefsthan the legal proportion in the coins of Great Britain, which

isas ¥ to 15.23 but fomewhat more than the actual or market psoportion, which is  
not quite Ito Irs.  
  
The preceding view of the fubje&amp; does not indeed afford a precife or certain de-  
finition of the prefent unit, im the coims, but it furnifhes data, which will ferve as guides  
in the progrefs of the inveftigation. It afcertains at leaft, that the fum in the money  
of accuunt of cach State correfponding with the nominal value of the dollar in fuch  
State, correfponds alfo with 24 grains and 6-8 of a grain of fine gold; and with fome-  
thing between 368 and 374 grains of fine filver.  
  
The next enquiry towardsa right determination of what ought to he the future  
money unit‘of the United States turns upon thefe queftions—Whether it ought to be  
peculiarly attached to either of the metals, in preference to the other, or not? and if  
to either, to which of them ?  
  
The faggeftions and proceedings hitherto have had for their obje&amp; the annexing ofit  
emphatically to the filver dollar. A refolution of Congtefs of the 6th of July, 1785,  
declares that the money unit of the United States fhail be a-dollar; and another refo-  
lution of the 8th of Auguft, 1786, fixes that dollar at 375 grains and 54 hundredths of  
agrain of fine filver. The famerefolution, however, determines, that there fhall al-  
fo be two gold coins, one of &#x27;246 grains and 268 parts of a grain of pure gold, equal  
to ten dollars, and the other of half that quantity of pure gold, equal to five dollars:  
And it is not explained, whether either of the two fpecieés of coins, of gold or filver,  
fhall have any greater legality in payments, than&#x27;the other: Yet it would feem, that  
a preference inthis particular is neceflary to execute the idea of attaching the unit ex-  
clufively to one’kind. If each of them be ‘as valid as the other, in payments to any  
amount, it is not obvious, in what effectual fenfe either of them can be deemed the  
money’unit; rather than’ the other. .  
  
If the general declaration, that the dollar thallbe the money unit of the United States,  
could be underftood to give it a fuperior legality, in payments, the inftitution ‘of coins  
of gold, and. the declaration’ that each’ of them ‘fhall be eg@al to a ‘certain’ number of  
dollars, would appear to deftroy that inference: And the circumftance of making’  
the dollar the unit inthe -money’of account feéms to be rather matter of form, than  
of fubftance.  
  
Contrary to the ideas which have heretofore prevailed, in the fuggeftions concern-  
ing a coinage of the United States, though not without much hefitation, arifing from  
a deference for thofe ideas, the Secretary is upon the whole ftrongly inclined to the  
opinion; that’a preference ought to be given to neither of the metals for the money  
unit: Perhaps:if either were to be preferred, it ought to be gold rather than filver.  
  
‘The reafons are thefe ,  
  
‘The inducement to fuch a preference’ is to render the unit as little variable as pof-  
fible, becaufe on this depends the fteady value of all contraéts,and in a certain fenfe  
of all other property. And itis truly obferved, that if the unit belong indifcrimin-  
ately to both the metals, it is fubje@ to all the flu&amp;tuations, that happen in the relative

On the Subject of a Mint. 193  
  
may be remarked, that the firft and moft fimple impreffions do not naturally incline  
to giving a preference to the inferior or leaft valuable of the two metals.  
  
It is fometimes obferved, that filver ought to be encouraged rather than gold, as be-  
ing more conductive to the extenfion of bank circulation, from the greater difficulty  
and inconvenience which its greater bulk, compared with its value, occafions in the  
tranfportation of it. But bank circulation is defirable, rather as an auxiliary to, than  
as a fubftitute for that of the precious metals; and ought to be left to its natural  
courfe—Artificial expedients to extend it, by oppofing obftaclesto the other, are at  
leaft not recommended by any very obvious advantages. And, in general, it is the  
fafeft rule to regulate every particular miftitution or objet, according to the principles  
which in relation to itfelf, appear the moft found. 1n addition to this, it may be ob-  
ferved, that the inconvenience of tranfporting either of the metals, is fufficiently great  
toinduce a preference of bank paper, whenever it can be made to anfwer the pur-  
pofe equally well. ,  
  
But upon the whole, it feems to be moft advifable, as has been obferved, not to at-  
tach the unit exclufively to either of the metals; becaufe this cannot be done effediu-  
ally, without deftroying the office and character of one of them as money, and reduc-  
ing it to the fituation of a mere merchandife ; which, accordingly, at different times  
has been propofed from different and very refpectable quarters; but which would  
probably he a greater evil than occafional variations.in the unit, from the fluctuations  
inthe relative value of the metals, efpecially if care be taken to regulate the propor-  
tion between them, with an eye to their average commercial value.  
  
To annul the ufe of either of the metals, as money, is. to abridge the quantity of  
circulating medium; and is liable to all the objections, which arife from a comparifon  
of the benefits of a full, with the evils of a feanty circulation.  
  
Itis not a fatisfaGtory anfwer to fay, that none but the favoured meta] would, in  
this cafe, find its way into the country, as in that all balances muft be paid. The  
practicability of this would in fome meafure depend on the abundance or fearcity of  
it,in the country paying— Where there was but little, it either would not be procura-  
ble at all, or it would coft a premium to obtain it—which, in every cafe of a competi-  
tion with others, in a branch of trade, would conftitute a deductien from the profits  
ofthe party receiving: perhaps, teo, the embarraflments which fuch a circumftance  
might fometimes create, in the pecuniary liquidation of balances, might lend addition-  
defforts to find a fubftitute in commodities, and might fo far impede the introduc-  
tion of the metals. Neither could the exclufiun of either of them be deemed, in other  
telpects, favourable to commerce. It is often, in the courfe of trade, as defirable to  
to poflefs the kind of money, as the kind of commodities, beft adapted to a foreign  
market.  
  
It feems, however, moft probable that the chief, if not the fole effect of fach a re-  
gulation, would be to diminifh the utility of one of the metals. It could hardly prove  
an obftacle to the introduction of that which was excluded, in the natural courfe of  
trade ; becaufe it would always command a ready fale for the purpofe of exportation  
toforeign markets. But fuch an effec, if the only one, is not to be regarded as a tyi-  
vial inconvenience.  
  
If then the unit ought not to be attached exclufively to either of the metals, the&#x27;pro-  
portion which ought to fubfift between them, in the coins, becomes a preliminary en-  
quiry, in order to its proper adjuftment. This proportion appears to be, in feveral  
views, of no inconfiderable moment. —_-  
  
One confequence of overvaluing either metal, in refpeét to the other, is the banifh-  
ment of that which is undervalued. If two countries are fuppofed, in one of which  
  
Proportion of gold to filver is as one to fixteen,in the other as one to fifteen, gold  
being worth more, filver lefs, in one than in the other, it is manifeft, that in their re-  
  
‘iprocal payments, cach will felect that fpecies which it values leaf, to pay to the o-  
  
t, where it is valued moft. Befides this, the dealers in money wil; from the fame  
taufe, often find a profitable traffick, in an exchange of the metals between the two  
countries, And hence, it would come to pafs, if ‘other things were equal, that the  
gteateft part uf the gold would be colle@ted in one, and the greateft part of the filver  
inthe other. The courfe of trade miyht in fonre degree counterad the tendency of  
the difference in the legal proportions, by the market value ; but this is fo far and fo  
often influenced by the legal rates, that it does not prevent their producing the effect  
  
which is inferred. Fats too, verify the inference : In Spain and England whcre gold

is rated higher than in other parts of Europe, there is a fcarcity of filver, while it js  
found to abound in France and Holland, where it is rated higher in proportion to  
gold, than in the neighbouring nation. And it is continually. flowing from Europe  
to China and the Eatft-Indies, owing to the comparative cheapnefs of it in the former,  
and dearnefs of it in the latter.  
  
This confequence is deemed by fome not very material : and there are even perfons,  
who from a fanciful predilection to gold, are willing to invite it, even by a higher  
price. But general utility will beft be promoted by a due prepurtion of both metals,  
If gold be moft convenient in large payments, filver is bef adapted to the more mi-  
nute and ordinary circulation.  
  
But it isto be fufpeéted, that there is another confeqnence morc ferious than the  
one which has becn mentioned. This is the diminution ef the total quantity of fpe-  
cie, which a country would naturally poffefs. :  
  
It is evident, that as often as a country, which ever-rates either of the metals, re-  
ceives a payment in that metal, it getsa lefs aual quantity than it ought to do, or  
than it would do, if a rate were a juft one.  
  
It is alfo equally evident, that there will be a continual effort to make payment to  
it in that fpecies, to which it has annexed an exaggerated eftimation, wherever it is  
current at a lefs proportional value. And it would feem to be a very natural effed  
of thefe two caufes, not only that the mafs of the precious metals in the country in  
queftion, would confitt chiefly of that kind, to which it had given an extraordinary  
value, but that it would be abfolutely lefs, than if they had been duly proportioned  
to each other,  
  
A conclufion of this fort, however, is tobe drawn with great caution. In fuch  
matters, there are always fome local and many other particular circumftances, which  
qualify and vary the operation of ager sivas aay even where they are juft ; and  
there are endlefs combinations, very diflicult to be analyzed, which often render  
principles, that have the moft plaufible pretenfions, unfound and delufive.  
  
There ought, for inftance, according to thofe which have been ftated, to have  
been formerly a greater quantity of gold in proportion to filver in the United States  
than there has been; becaufe the actual value of gold in this country, compared with  
filver, was perhaps higher than in any other. But our fituation in regard to the  
Weft-India iflands, into fome of which there is a large influx of filver dire@ly from  
the mines of South America, occafions an extraordinary fupply of that metal, and  
confequently a greater proportion of it in our circulation than might have been ex-  
pected from its relative value.  
  
What influence the proportion under confideration may have upon the ftate of  
prices, and how far this may counteract its tendency to increafe or leffen the quantity  
of the metals, are points not eafy to he developed ; and yet they are very neceflary  
to an accurate judgment of the truce operation of the thing.  
  
But however impoflible it may be to pronounce with certainty, that the poffeflion  
of a lefs quantity of fpecie is a confequence of overvaluing either of the metals,  
there is enough of probability in the confiderations, which feem to indicate it, to  
form an argument of weight againft fuch overvaluation.  
  
A third ill confequence refulting from it is, a greater and more frequent difturb-  
ance of the ftate of the money unit, by a greater and more frequeat diverfity between  
the legal and market proportions of the metals. This has not hitherto been experi-  
enced in the United Srates, but it has been experienced elfewhere ; and from its not  
having been felt by us hitherto, it does not follow that this will not be the cafe here  
after, when our commerce fhall have attained a maturity, which will place it under  
the influence of more fixed principles.  
  
In eftablifhing a proportion between the metals, there feems to be amption of one  
of two things—  
  
To approach as nearly as it can be afcertained, the mean or average preportion, in  
what may be called the commercial world ; or  
  
To retain that which now exiits in the United States :—As far as thefe happen to  
coincide, they will render the courfe to be purfued more plain and more cei  
tain.  
  
To afcertain the firft with precifion, would require better materials than are pol  
feffed, or than ceyuld be obtained, without an inconvenient delay.

2717, after ating the particular proportions in the different countries of Europe, con-  
cludes thus—“ By the courfe of trade and exchange between nation and nation, in all  
Europe, fine gold isto fine filver as 14 4-§ or 15 to one.”  
  
But however accurate and decifive this authority may be deemed in relation to the  
period to which it applies, it cannot be taken, at the diftance of more than feventy  
years, as a rule for determining the exifting proportion.  
  
Alterations have fince been made, in the regulations of their coins, by feveral na-  
tions; which, as well anthe courfe of trade, have an influence upon the market va-  
lues. Neverthelefs, there is reafon to believe that the ftate of the matter, as repre-  
fented by Sir aac Newton, is not very remote from its actual ftate.  
  
In Holland, the greateft money market in Europe, gold was to filver in December  
1789, as I to 14,88 ; and in that of London it has been for fome time paft but little  
different, approaching perhaps fomething nearer 1 to 15.  
  
Ithas been feen, that the exiting proportion between the two metals in this coun-  
try, is about as 1 to 15.  
  
It is fortunate in this refpeét, that the innovations of the Spanifh mint have imper-  
ceptibly introduced @ proportion fo analogous, as thie is, to that which prevails among  
the princi al commercial nations; as it greatly facilitates a proper regulation of the  
matter. his proportion of £ tors is recommended by the particular fituation of our  
trade, as being nearly that which obtains in the market of Great-Britain, to which  
nation our fpecie is rincipaily exported. A lower rate for cither of the metals in  
our market, than 3n theirs, might not only afford a motive the more in certain cafes to  
remit in {pecie rather than in commodities; but it might in foine others, caufe us to  
pay 2 greater quantity of it for a given fum, than we fhould otherwife do. If the  
  
e&amp; fhould rather be to occafion a premium to be given for the metal, which was  
under rated, this would obviate thofe difadvantages ; but it would involve another,  
a cuftomary difference between the market and legal proportions, which would a~-  
mount te a fpecies of diforder inthe national coinage.  
  
Looking forward to th: payments of intereft hereafter to be made to Holland, the  
fame proportion does not appear ineligible, The prefent legal proportion in the coins  
of Holland is fated at 1 to 14 getc, That of the market varies fomewhat at different  
times, but feldom very widely from this point.  
  
There can hardly be a better rule, in any country, for the legal, than the market  
  
proportion ; if this can be fuppofed to have been produced by the free and fteady  
courfe of commercial principles. The prefumption, in fuch cafe is, that each metal  
finds its true level, according ¢o its intrinfic utility, in the general fyftem of money  
operations.  
_ But it muft be admitted, that this argument in favour of continuing the exifting  
proportion, is not applicable to the ftate of the coins withus. There have been too  
many artificial and hetcrogencous ingredients, too much want .of order in the pecus  
Diary tranfactions of this country, to authorife the attributing the effedts which have  
appeared, to the regular operations of commerce. .A proof of this is to be drawn  
from the alterations, which have happened in the proportion between the metals,  
merely by the fuccefllive degradations of the dollar, in confequence of the mutability  
of a foreign mint. ‘The value of gold to filver appears to have declined, wholly from  
this caufe, from 15 GIo to about 1 stox. Yet asthislaft proportion, however pro-  
duced, coincides fo nearly with y be deemed the commercial average, it may  
be {uppofed to furmith as good a rule as can be purfued.  
  
The only queftion feems to be, whether the value of gold ought not to be a little  
lowered, to bring it to an exa&amp; level with the two markets which have been mention-  
ed. But as the ratio of rto rx 5 is fo nearly conformable to the ftate of thofe markets,  
and beft agrees with that of our own, it will probably be found the moft cligible.  
If the market of Spain continues to give a higher value to gold (as it has done in  
time paft) than that which is recommended, there may be fome advantage in a mid-  
dle flation.  
  
A further preliminary to the adjuftment of the future money unit, is to deter-  
mine what fhall be the proportion and compofition of alloy, in each fpecies of the  
coins.  
  
The firft, by the refolution of the 8th. of Auguft, 1786, before referred to, is re-  
gulated at one twelfth, or, in other words, at part alloy to 11 parts fine, whether  
gold or Gilver ; which appears to be a convenient rule ; unlefs there fhould be fome

collateral confideration, which may dictate a departure fromit. Its correfpondency,  
in regard to both metals, is a recommendation of it, becaufe a difference could  
anfwer no purpofe of pecuniary or commercial utility, and uniformity is favourable  
to order.  
  
This ratio, as it regards gold, coincides with the proportion, real or profeffed, in  
the coinsof Portugal, England, France and Spain. In thofe of the two former it is  
real, in thofe of the two latter there is a deduction for what is called remedy of weight  
and alloy, which is in the nature of an allowance to the mafter of the mint for crrors  
and imperfections in the procefs; rendering the coin either lighter or bafer than it  
ought to be. ‘The fame thing is known inthe theory of the Englith mint, where 1-6  
of a carat isallowed. But the difference feems to be, that there, it is merely an oc-  
cafiona} indemnity within a certain limit, for real and unavoidable errors and imper-  
fections ; whereas in the practice of the mints of France and Spain it appears to a-  
mount to a ftated and regular deviation from the nominal ftandard. Accordingly  
the real ftandards of France and Spain are fomething worle than 22 carats or Ir  
parts in 12 fine.  
  
The principal gold coins in Germany, Holland, Sweden, Denmark, Poland and  
Italy, are finer than thofe of England and, Portugal in different degrees, from 1 carat  
and 1-4 to £ carat and 7-8, which laft is within 1-8 of a carat of pure gold.  
  
There are fimilar diverfities in the ftandards of the filver coins, of the different  
countries of Europe. That of Great Britain is 222 parts fine to 18 alloy : thofe of  
the other European nations vary from that of Great-Britain as widely as from about  
17 of the. fame parts better to 75 worfe.  
  
The principal reafons afligned for the ufe of alloy, are the faving of expence in the  
refining of the metals (which in their natural ftate are ufually mixed with a portion  
oft the coarfer kinds) and the rendering of them harder asa fecurity againft too great  
walte by friction and wearing—The firft reafon, drawn from the original compofi-  
tion of the metals, is rengthened at prefent by the practice of alloying their coins,  
which has.obtained among fo many nations. ‘The reality of the effe@, to which the  
laft reafon is applicable, has been denied, and experience has been appealed to as prov-  
ing, that the more alloyed coins wear faiter than the purer. The true ftate of this  
matter may be worthy of future inveltigation, though firft appearances are in favour  
of alloy. In che mean time, the faving of trouble and expence are {fufficient induce-  
ments to following thofe examples which fuppofe its expediency. And the fame con-  
fideratians lead to taking as our models thofe nations with whom we have moft inter-  
courfe, and whofe coins are moft prevalent in our circulation. Théfe are Spain, Por-  
tugal, England and France, The relation which the propofed proportion bears to  
their geld coins has becn explained. no refpect to their filver coins, it will not be ve-  
ry remote from the mean of their feveral ftandards.  
  
‘The component ingredients of the alloy in each metal willalfo require to be regu-  
Jated. In filver, copper is the only kind in ufe, and it is doubtlefs the only proper  
one. Ingold there isa mixture of filver and copper ; inthe Englifh coins confifting  
of equal parts, in the coins of fome countries varying from 1-3 to 2-3 filver.  
  
The reafon of this union of filver with copper is this—The filver counteracts the  
tendency of the cuppcer to injure the colour or beauty of the goin, by giving it too  
much rednefs, or rather a coppery hue; whicha {mall quantity will produce; and  
the copper prevents the too great whitenefs, Which filver alone would confer. It is  
apprehended, that there are confiderations, which may render it prudent to eftablifh  
by law, that the proportion of filver to copper in the gold coins ofthe United States  
fhall not be more than one half, nor lefs than one third; vefting a difcretion in fome  
proper place to reguiate the matter within thofe limits, as experience in the cxecu-  
tion may recommend. fe  
  
A third point remains to be difcuffed, asa pre-requifite to the determination of the  
money unit, which is, whether the expence of coining fhall be defrayed by the pub-  
lic, or out of the material itfelf; or, as it isfometimes ftated, whether coinage {hall  
be free, or fhall be fubje&amp; to a duty or impofition? This forms, perhaps, one of the  
niceft queftions in the doctrine of money. ;  
  
The practice of different nations is difimilar in this particular. In England, coin-  
age 1s faidto be entirely free: the mint price of the metals in bullion, being the fame  
with the value of themincoin. In France there is a duty which has been, if it 1s not  
now, cight per cent. In Holland there isa difference between the mint price and ce

value in the coins, which has been computed at .96, or fomething lefs than one per  
cent, upon gold; at 1.48, or fomething lefs than one and a half per cent. upon filver.,  
The refolution of the 8th of Auguft, 1786, proceeds upon the idea of a deduction of  
half per cent. from gold, and of two per cent, from filver, as an indemnification for  
the expence of coining. ‘This is inferred from a report of the late board of treafury,  
upon which that refolution appears to have been founded,  
  
Upon the fuppofition that the expence of coinage out to be defrayed ought of the me-  
tals, there are two ways ip which it may be effected; one by a redu¢tion of the quan-  
tity of fine gold and filver in the coins; the other by eftablifhing a difference between  
the value of thofe metals, in the coins, and the mint price of them in bullion.  
  
The firft method appears to the Secretary inadmiffiable. He is unable to diftin-  
guifh an operation of this fort, from that of raifing the denomination of the coin; a  
meafure which has been difapproved of by the wifeft men in the nations in which it  
has heen practifed, and condemned by the reft of the world.. To declare that alefy  
weight of gold or filver fhall pafs for the fame funi which before reprefented a great-  
er weight, or to ordain that the fame weight fhall pafs for a greater fum, are things  
fubftantially of one nature. The confequence of either of them, if the change can be  
realifed, is to degrade the money unit; obliging creditors to receive lefs than their  
jut dues—and depreciating property of every kind : for it is manifeft, that every  
one would in this cafe be reprefented by a lef quantity of gold and filver, than be-  
  
ore,  
  
It is fometimes obferved on this head, that though any article of property might in  
fact be reprefented by a lefs aétual quantity of pure metal, it would neterthelefs be  
reprefented by fomething of the fame intrinfic value. Every fabric, it is remarked,  
is worth intrinfically, the price of the raw material and the expence of fabrication ; a  
truth not lefs applicable to a piece of coin, than te a yard of cloth.  
  
This pofition, well founded in itfelf, is here mifapplied.’ It fuppofes that the coins  
now in circulation, are to be confidered as bullion, or in other words, as a raw matc-  
rial. But the fac is, that the adeption of them, as mency, has caufed them to become  
the fabric. It has invefted them with the chara@ter and office of coins, and hag yiven  
them a fan&amp;tion and efficacy equivalent to that of the ftamp of the fovereign. The  
pricesof all our commodities,at heme and abroad,and of allforcign commodities, in our  
markets, have found their level, in conformity to this principle. The foreign coins  
may he divefed of the privilege they have hitherto been permitted to enjoy, and may  
of courfe be /e/t te find their value in the markets, as araw material. But the quan-  
tity of gold and filver in the national coins, correfponding with a given fum, cannot  
be made lefsthan heretofore, without difturbing the balance of intrinfic value; and  
making every acre of land, as well as every buthel of wheat, of lefs actual worth than  
intime pait. If the United States were infulated, amd cut off from all intercourfe with  
the reft of mankind, this reafoninz would not be equally conclufive. But it appears  
decifive, when confidered with a view to the relations which commerce has created  
between us and other countries.  
  
It is however not improbable, that the effect meditated would be defeated by a  
rife of prices, proportioned to the diminution of the intrinfic value of the coins. This  
might be looked for in every enlightened commercial country ; but perhaps7 noue  
with greater certainty than this: becaufe, in mone, are men lefs liable to be the dupes  
of founds—in none has authority fo little refource for fubftituting names to things.  
  
A general revolution in prices, though only nominally, and in appearance, could  
not fail to diftract the ideas of the community, and would be apt to breed difcontents,  
as well among all thofe who live on the income of their money, as among the poorer  
clafs of the people, to whom the neceffaries of life would feem to have become dear-  
er. In the confufion of fuch a ftate of things, ideas of value would not improbably  
adhere to the old coins, which from that circumftance, inftead of feeling the effe@ of  
the lofs of their privilege as money, would perhaps bear a price in the market rela-  
tively to the new ones, in exact proportion to weight. The frequency of the demand  
for the metals to pay foreign balances would contribute to this effec.  
  
Among the evils, attendant on fuch an operation, are thefe—creditors both of the  
public and of individuals would lofe a part of their property—public and private cre-  
dit would receive a wound—the effective revenues of the government would be di-  
minifhed. There is {carcely any point, in the economy of national affairs of great

iz er moment, than the uniform prefervation of the intrinfic value of the money unit.  
f On this the fecurity and fteady value of property effentially depend.  
  
; The fecond method, therefore, of defraying the expence of the coinage out of the  
  
metals, is greatly to be preferred tothe other. This is to let the fame fum of money  
ie continue to reprefent in the new coins exactly the fame quantity of gold and filver, as  
&#x27; it does in thefe now current—to allow, at the mint, fuch a price only for thefe  
. metals as will admit of profit juft fufficient to fatisfy the expence of coinage—to abol-  
ifh the legal currency of foreign coins, both in public and private payments—and  
of courfe to leave the fuperior utility of the national coins, for domeftic purpofes, to  
operate the difference of market walue, which is neceflary to induce the bringing of  
bullion tothe mint. In this cafe, all property and labour will ftill be reprefented by  
the fame quantity of gold ‘and filver, as formerly ; andthe only change which will  
be wrought, will confift in annexing the office of money exclufively to the national  
coins; confequently, withdrawing it from thofe of foreign countries, and fnffering  
them to become, as they ought to be, mere articles of merchandife.  
  
The arguments in favour of a regulation of thiskind, are—Firft, That the want of  
it is a caufe of extra expence: there being then no motive of individual intereft to  
diftinguifh between the national coins and bullion, they are, it is alledged, indifcrim-  
inately melted down, for domeftic manufaétories, and exported for the purpofes of fo-  
reign trade; and it is added, that when the coins become light, by wearing,the fame  
quantity of fine gold or filver bears a higher price in bullion than in coins; in which  
ftate of things the melting down of the coins to be fold as bullion, is attended with  
profit; and !rom both caufes the’expence of the mint, or in other words the expence of  
maintaining the fpecie capital of the nation, is materially augmented.  
  
Secondiy—That the exiftence of fuch a regulation promotes a favorable courfe of  
exchange, end benefits trade, not only by that circumftance, but by obliging foreign-  
ne in certain cafes, to pay dearer for domeftic commodities, and to fell their own  
  
caper.  
  
Ae far as relates to the tendency ofa free coinage to produce an increafe of ex-  
ro in the different ways that have been ftated, the argument muft be allowed to  
  
ave feundation, both in reafon and in experience. It defcribes what has been ex-  
emplified in Great-Britain.  
  
The effe&amp; of giving an artificial value to bullion, is not at firft fight obvious ; but it  
actually pet at the period immediately preceding the late reformation in the  
gold coin of the country juftnamed. &lt;A pound troy in gold bullion of ftandard fine-  
nefs, was then, from rgs. 6d. to 25s. fterling, dearer than an equal weight of guin-  
eas, as delivered atthe mint. The phenomenon is thus accounted for—the old guin-  
eas were more than

here is

ete The moft plaufible part of it isthzt which relates to the courfe of exchange. Expe-  
wea a rience, in France,hasfhewn, that the market price of bullion has been influenced by the  
inint difference, between that and coin; fometimes to the full extent of the difference,

France to England fhould not be above 2 per cent.; and if exchange fhould be at par,  
it is evident, that a profit of 6 per cent. might be made, by fending bullion from  
France to England and drawing bills for the amount. One hundred louis d’ors in  
coin would purchafe the weight of 108 in bullion; one huncred of which remitted  
to England would fuffice to pay a debt of an equal amount : and two being paid for  
the infurance and tranfportation, there would remain fix for the benefit of the perfon  
who fhould manage the negociation. But as fo large a profit could not fail to pro-  
duce competition, the bills in confequence of this would decrcafe in price, till the pro-  
fit were reduced to the minimum of an adequate recompence for the trouble and rifk.  
And as the amount ef 100 louis d’ors, in England, might be afforded for 96 in France,  
with a profit of more than 14 per cent. bills upon England might fall in France to 4  
  
r cent. below par.; one per cent being a fufficient profit to the exchanger or broker  
for the management of the bufinels.  
  
But it is admitted that this advantage is loft, when the balance of trade js againft the  
nation, which impofes the duty in queftion; becaufe by encreafing the demand for  
bullion, it brings this toa par with the coins; and it is to be /u/pcéted, that where com-  
mercial principles have their free {cope, and are well underftood, the market difference  
between the metals in coin and bullion will feldom approximate to that of the mint,  
if the latter be confiderable. It muft be not alittle difficult to keep the money of the  
world, which can be employed to an equal purpofe, in the commerce of the world, in  
a ftate of degradation, in comparifon with the money of a particular country,  
  
This alone would feem fufficient to prevent it: whenever the price of cvin to bul-  
lion, in the market, materially exceeded the par of the metals, it would hecome an ob-  
ject to fend the bullion abroad ; if net te pay a foreign balance, to be invefted in fome  
other way, in foreign countries, where it bore a fuperier value : an operation, hy which  
immenfe fortunes might be amaffed, if it were not, that the exportation of the bullion  
would of itfelf reftore the intrinfic par. But as it would naturally have this effeét, the  
advantage fuppofed would contain in itfelf the principle of its own deftruction. As  
long, however, as the exportation of bullion could be made with profit, which is as  
long as exchange could remain below par, there would be a drain of the gold and {il-  
ver of the country. ee  
  
if any zhing can maintain for a length of time a material difference, between the  
value of metals in coin and in bullion, it muft be a conftant and confiderable balance  
of trade, in favour of the country in which it is maintained. In one fituated like  
the United States, it would in all probability be a hopelefs attempt. The frequent  
demand for gold and filver, to pay balances to foreigners, would tend powerfully to  
preferve an equilibrium of intrinfic value.  
  
The profpec is, that it would occafion foreign coins, to circulate b  
  
; y common con-  
fent, nearly at par with the national. :  
  
To fay, that as far as the effe&amp; of lowering exchange is produced, though it be |  
  
only occafional and momentary, there is a benefit the more throwa into the fcale of  
public profperity, is not fatisfactory. It has been feen, that it may be productive of  
one evil, the inveftment of a part of the national capital in foreign countries; which  
can hardly be beneficial, but in a fituation like that of the United Netherlands, where  
an immenfe capital and a decreafe of internal demand render it neceflary to find em-  
ployment for money, in the wants of other nations: and, perhaps, on a clofe exami-  
nation, other evils may be defcried.  
  
One allied to that, which has been mentioned, is this—Taking France, for the fake  
ef more concife illuftration, as the fcene. Whenever it happens that French loyis d’ors  
are fent abroad, from whatever caufe, if there be a confiderable difference between  
coin and bullion, in the market of France, it will conftitute an advantageous traffic  
to fend back thefe louis d’ors and bring away bullion, in lieu of them; upon ali of  
which exchanges, France muft fuftain an aStual lofs of a part of its gold and filver.  
  
Again, fuch a difference between coin and bullion may tend to counteraé a favour-  
able balance of trade. Whenever a foreign merchant is the carrier of his own com-  
modities to France, for fale, he has a ftrong inducement to bring back fpecie, inftead  
of French commodities ; becgufe a return in the latter may afferd no profir, may even  
be attended with lofs; in the former, it will afferd a certain profit. The fame prin-  
ciple muft be fuppofed to operate in the general courfe of remittances, from France  
tu other countries. ‘The principal queftion with a merchant naturally is—In what

in cafes, in which other commodities are not likely to produce equal profit with bul.  
lion, it may be expeGed that this will be preferred; to which the greater certainty  
attending the operation, muft be an additional incitement. There can hardly be  
imagined a circumftance, lefs friendly to trade, than the exiftence of an extra induce-  
ment, arifing from the poffibility of a profitable {peculation, upon the articles them-  
felves, to export from a country its gold and filver, rather than the produ@ts of its land  
and Jabour. &#x27;  
  
The other advantages fuppofed, of obliging foreigners to pay dearer for domettic  
commodities, and to fell their own cheaper, are applied to a fituation, which includes  
a favourable balance of trade. It is underftood in this fenfe—The prices of domettic  
commodities (fuch at leaft as are peculiar to the country) remain attached to the de-  
nominations of the coins—When a favourable balance of trade realizes in the market  
the mint difference between coin and ‘bullion, foreigners, who muft pay in the latter,  
are obliged to give more of it for fuch commodities, than they otherwife would do, A-  
gain, the bullion, which is now obtained at a cheaper rate in the home market, will  
procure the fame quantity of goods in the foreign market, as before; which is faid to  
render foreign commodities cheaper. In this reafoning, much fallacy is to be fufpected :  
If it be true, that foreigners pay more for domeftic commodities, it muft be equally  
true, that they get more for their own, when they bring them themfelves to market.  
If peculiar, or other domeftic commodities, adhere to the denominations of the coins,  
no reafon occurs why foreign commodities of a like chara@er fhould not do the fame  
thing.—And in this cafe, the foreigner, though he receive only the fame value in coin  
for his merchandife, as formerly, cam convert it into a greater quantity of bullion.  
Whence the nation is liable to lofe more of its gold and filver, than if their intrinfic  
value in relation to the coins, were preferved. And whether the gain or the lofs, will  
on the whole preponderate, would appear to depend on the comparative proportion  
of active commerce of the one country with the other,  
  
tt is evident, alfo, that the nation muft pay as much gold and filver as before, for  
the commodities which it procures abroad, and whether it obtains this geld and filver  
cheaper, or not, turns upon the folution of the queftion juft intimated, refpe@ting the  
relative proportion of active commerce, between the two countries.  
  
Befides thefe confiderations, it is admitted in the reafoning, that the advantages  
fuppofed, which depend on a favourable balance of trade, have a tendency to affe&amp; that  
balance difadvantageoufly. Foreigners, it is allowed, will in this cafe, feek fome o-  
ther vent for their commodities, and fome other market, where they can fupply their  
wants at an eafier rate. A tendency of this kind, if real, would be a fufficient objec-  
tion to the regulation. Nothing which contributes to change a beneficial current of  
trade, can well compenfate, by particular advantages, for fo injurious an effect. It is  
far more eafy to transfer trade, from a lefs to a more favourable channel, than when  
on¢e transferred, to bring it back to its old one. Every fource of artificial interrup-  
tion to an advantageous current is, therefore, cautioufly to be avoided.  
  
It merits attention, that the able minifter, whe lately and fo long prefided aver the  
finances of France, does not attribute to the duty of coinage, in that coustry, any par-  
ticular advantages, in relation to exchange and trade. ‘Though he rather appears an  
advocate for it, *tis on the fole ground of the revenue it affords, which he reprefents,  
2s in the nature of a very moderate duty on the general mafs of exportation.  
  
And it is not improbable, that to the fingular felicity of fituation of that kingdom,  
is to be attributed its not having been fenfible of the evils which feem incident to  
the regulation. There is perhaps no part of Europe, which has fo little need of other  
countries, as France. Comprehending a variety of foils and climates, an immenfe  
population, its agriculture in a ftate of mature improvement, it pofledes within its  
own bofom, moft, if not all the productions of the carth, which any of its moft fa-  
voured neighbours can boaft. The variety, abundance, and excellence of its wines,  
conftitute a peculiar advantage in its favour. Arts and manufactures are there alfo in  
a very advanced ftate—fome of them of confiderable importance, in higher perfection  
than elfewhere. Its contiguity to Spain, the intimate nature of its connexion with  
that country ; a country with few fabrics of its own, confequently numerous wants,  
and the principal receptacle of the treafures of the hew world. ‘Thefe circumftances  
concur, in fecuring to France, fo uniform, and fo confiderable a balance of trade, as in  
a great meafure to counteract the natural tendency of amy errors, which may cxift in  
the fyftem of her mint; and to render inferences from the operation of that fyftem

Report of the Secretary of the Treasury, on the  
  
fubjeift of a Mint.  
(CONTIKUED.)  
THE neceflitv of fulfilling prior engagements, is a cause or pre­  
text for poflponing the delivery of the coin in lieu of the  
bullion. And this delay creates a difference in the market price  
of the two things. Accordingly, for some years pad, an ounce of  
standard gold, which is worth in coin 17 lOj sterling, has  
been in the market of London, in bullion, only £.%. 17 6, which  
is within a small fraction of one half per cent, lei&#x27;s. Whether this  
be management in the mint to accommodate the bank in the pur­  
chase of bullion, or to effect indire&amp;ly something equivalent to a  
formal difference of price, or whether it be the natural corn fe of  
the bufinefo, is open to conjecture.  
If, at the fame time, indicates, that if the mint were to make  
prompt payment, at about half per cent, less than it does at pre­  
sent, the state of bullion in refpeft to coin, would be precisely&#x27;  
the fame as it now is. And it would be then certain that the go­  
vernment would save expence in the coinage of gold ; since it is  
not probable, that the time afi ially loft in the course of the year  
in converting bullion into coin can be an equivalent to half per  
cent, on the advance; and there will generally be at the com­  
mand of the treasury, a considerable sum of money, waiting for  
some periodical dilburfement, which without hazard might be  
applied to that advance.  
  
In what sense, a free coinage can be said to promote the abun­  
dance of gold and silver, may be inferred fiom the instances,  
which have been given of the tendency of a contrary system to  
promote their exportation. It is, however, not probable, that a  
very small difference of value between coin and bullion can have  
any e ffett, which ought to enter into calculation. There can be  
noinducement of positive profit, to export the bullion, as long as  
the difference of price is exceeded by the expence of transport­  
ation. And the profpett of smaller loss upon the metals, than  
npon commodities, when the difference is very minute, will be  
frequently over-balanced by the poflibility of doing better with  
the latter, from a rife of markets. It is at any rate certain that  
it can be of no consequence, in this view, whether the superiority  
of coin to bullion in the market be produced, as in England, by  
the delay of the mint, or by a formal discrimination in the re­  
gulated values.  
  
Under an impression, that a small difference between the value  
of the coin, and the mint price of bullion, is the least exception­  
able expedient for restraining the melting down, or exportation  
of the former, and not perceiving, that if it be a very moderate  
one, it can be hurtful in other refpefts—the Secretary is inclined  
to an experiment of J percent, on each of the metals. The fact,  
which has been mentioned, with regard to the price of gold bul­  
lion in the Engliffi market, seems to demonstrate that such a dif­  
ference may fafely be.made. In this cafe there must be im­  
mediate payment for the gold and silver offered to the mint. How  
far £ per cent, will go towards defraying the expence of the coin­  
age cannot be determined beforehand, with accuracy. It is pre­  
lumed, that on an economical plan, it will fuffice in relation to  
gold. But it is not expetfed that the fame rate on silver will be  
fiifficient to defray the expence attending that metal. Some ad­  
ditional provision may therefore be fouud neceffdry, if this limit  
be adopted.  
  
It docs not seem to be advisable, to make any greater differ­  
ence in regard to silver than to gold : because it is desirable, that  
the proportion between the two metals, in the market, should cor­  
respond with that in the coins, which would not be the c&#x27;afe, if  
the mint price of one was comparatively lower, than that of &#x27;the  
Other ; and because also silver being proposed to be rated in ref­  
petftogold, somewhat below its general commercial value, if  
there (hould be a disparity, to its disadvantage, in the mint pri­  
ces of the two metals, it would obflru&amp;too much the bringing of  
&#x27;t to be coined, and would add an inducement to export it. Nor  
does it appear to the Secretary fate to make a greater difference,  
between the value of coin and bullion, than has been mentioned.&#x27;  
it will be better to have to increase it hereafter if this shall be  
found expedient than to have it to recede from too considerable a  
difference in consequence of evils, which shall lnve been experi­  
enced. r  
It is sometimes mentioned, as an expedient, which, confidently  
with a free coinage, may fetve to prevent the evils desired to be  
avoided—to incorporate in the coins a greater proportion of al­  
loy, than isufual, regulating their value nevertheless according to  
the quantity of pure metal they contain. This it is supposed, by  
adding to the difficulty of refining them, would cause bullion to  
be preferred both for manufaflure and exportation.  
But flrongobje&amp;ions lie against this scheme An augmenta­  
tion ofexpence;—an actual depreciation of the coin a°danger  
of ltill greater depreciation in the public opinion ; the facilitating  
o.fco»n&#x27;«r«»s : wtllle 11 &#x27;s questionable, whether it wonld have  
the effect expected from it.  
The alloy being esteemed of no value, an increase of it is evi­  
dently an increase of cxpence. This, in relation to the gold coins,  
particularly, is a matter of moment. It has been noted, that the  
alloy in them confills partly of silver. If to avoid expence. the  
addition (hould beof copper only, this would spoil theappeaiance  
ot the coin, and give it a base countenance. lis beauty would in­  
deed be injured, though in a less degree, -even if the usual pro­  
portions of silver and copper should be maintained in the tncrcaf­  
ed quantity of alio).  
And however inconsiderable iin additional expenditure of cop.  
per in the coinage of a year may be deemed ; in a series of years  
it would become of consequence. Im regulations which contem­  
platethe lapse and operation of ages, a very small item ofexpence  
acquires importance.  
The .xflual depreciation of the coin, by an increase of alloy, re­  
mits from the very circumstance, which is the motive to it—the  
greater difficulty of refining. In England it is customary for  
thole concerned in manufaftuies of gold to make a deduction in  
the price, of four pence sterling per ounce, of fine gold, for every  
carat which the mass containing it is below the legal standard  
&quot;.a ™&#x27;e. •&quot;of a single carat, or 1-24 part  
fl SJ&#x27;ld coins°f the United States, compared with the Er.gliffi  
standard would cause the fame quantity of pure gold in them to  
be woith nearly 4_10ths percent, less than in tile coins of Grea&#x27;-  
Br.ta.n This circumstance would be likely, in process of time  
to be felt in the market of the United S&#x27;atcs  
A still greater depreciation, in the public opinion, would be to  
be apprehended from the apparent debasement of the coin. The  
• ofi magi nation and prejudice cannot fafely be difreEarded  
in any thing that relates to money. It the beauty of the coin be  
impaired; it may be fouud difficult to fatisfy the generality of the  
community, that what appears worse is not really less valuable&quot;  
and it is not altogether certain, that an impression of its beini? so&#x27;  
may not occasion an unnatural augmentation of prices &#x27;  
Gr&lt; ater danger of imposition, by counterfeits, is also to be at&gt;-  
prehended from the injury which will be done to the appearance  
of thecoin. It is a just observation, that &quot; The perfection of the  
coins is agreat fafe-guard against counterfeiters.&quot; And it is evid, nt  
that the colour, as well as the excellence of the workmanship.is an in­  
gredient in that peifeftion. The intermixture of too much alloy  
particularly o. copper in the gold coins at least, mud materially  
lessen the facility of distinguishing by the eye, the purer from the  
Daler kind, the genuine from the counterfeit.  
The ineffieacv of the arrangement to the purpose, intended to  
be answered by it, is rendered probable by different confuta­  
tions. If the standard of plate in the United States should be re  
gulated. according to that of the national coins; it is to be ex­  
petted, that thegoldfmith would preferthefe to the foreigncoins ■  
because he would find them prepared to his hand, in &quot;the date&#x27;  
which he desires ; whereas be would have to expend an additional  
  
cuantity of alloy to bring the foreign coins to that date. If the  
ltandard of plate, l&gt;y law or usage, ftiould be superior to that of  
the national coins, there would be a poflibility of the foreign[coins  
bearing a higher price in the market ; and this would not only  
obftrutt their being brought the mint, but might occasion the  
exportation of the national coin in preference. It is not under­  
stood, that the pra6lice of mak:ng an abatement of price for thr  
inferiority of standard, is applicable to the Englilh mint—and if  
it be not, this would also contribute to fruftrating the expelled  
effect from the increafeof alloy. For, in this cafe, a given quan­  
tity of pure metal in our standard, would be worth as much there,  
as in bullion, ot the English or any other standard.

Report ol the Secretary of the Treasury, on the  
fubjeift of a Mint.  
(CON TI N U ED.]  
  
O.NSIDERIXG , tin icfoie, the uncn taint v of the fucccfs *  
ihe expedient, and the inconveniences, which Seem incider  
to it, it would appear preferable to submit to those of a free cain  
age. It is obfervablc, that additional expence, which is one Oi  
the principal of these, is also applicable to the proposed remedy  
It is now proper to resume and finifh the answer to the fiift  
queflion ; in order to which the ihree fuccceding ones have ne­  
cdTarily been anticipated. The conclusion to be drawn from the  
observations, which have been made on the fubje£fc, is this   
That the unit in the coins of the Unitecl States, ought to corres­  
pond with 24 grains and 3-4 of a grain of pure gold, and with  
371 grains and 1-4 of a grain of pure silver, each answering to a  
dollar in the money of account. The former is exa&amp;ly agreea­  
able to the present value of gold, and the latter is within a small  
ira&amp;ion of the mean of the two last emiflions of dollars; the only  
ones which are now found in common circulation, and of which  
the newest is in the greatell abundance. The alloy i/i each cafe  
to be 1-12 th of the total weight, which will make the unit 27  
grains of jtandard gold, and 405 grains of standard-silver.  
Each of these, it has been remarked, will answer to a dollar in  
the money of account. It is conceived thatnoihing better can be  
done in relation to this, than to pursue the track marked out by  
the resolution of the Bih of August, 1786. This has been ap­  
proved abroad, as well as at home, and it is certain, that nothing  
can be more Simple or convenient, than the decimal subdivisions.  
rhere is every rcafon to expc£l that the method will fpcedily grow  
into general use, when it shall be seconded by corresponding  
coins. On this plan, the unit in the money of account, will con­  
tinue to be, as established by that resolution, a dollar; and its  
multiples, dimes, ccnts and milles ; or tenths, hundredths, and  
thousandths.  
Vls ich regard to the number of different pieccs which shall com­  
pose the coins of the United States,two things are to beconfulted :  
convenience of circulation, and cheapness of the coinage. The  
fiift ought not to be Sacrificed to the last ; but as tar as they can  
be reconciled to each other, it is desirable to do it. Numerous  
and small not too minute) fubd&#x27;vifi &gt;ns aflifl circulation ; but  
the multiplication of the smaller kinds expence; the  
lame process being nect flary to a small as to a large piece.  
As it is easy to add, it will be moil advifeable to begin with a  
small number, till experience shall decide wh&#x27;e her any othei  
k&#x27;nds are necefTary. The following, it is conceivcd, will be  
Sufficient in the commeno njeni.  
1 Goid pi tec, equal in weight and vaiqe to 10 units or dollars.  
1 Gold piece, equal to a tenth part of former, and which  
mall be a unit or a dollar.  
1 Silver piece, which shall also be a unit or dollar.  
1 Silver piece, which shall be in weight and value a tenth part  
of the Silver unit or dollar.  
1 Copper piccc, which shall be of the value of a hundredth part  
of a dollar.  
  
J Othercopper piece, which shall be half the value of the form r.  
It is not propof d that the lightcft-of the two gold coins should  
be numerous, as in large paymtnts, the larger the pieces, the shor­  
ter the proccfs of counting, the less the risk of mistake, and conse­  
quently the greater the fafery and the convenience ; and in small  
payments, it is not pcrceived, that any inconvcnience can accrue,  
irom an entire dependence on the silver and copper coins. The  
chief inducement to the establishment of the small gold piece, js  
to have a sensible object in that metal, as well as in silver, to ex­  
press the unit. Fifty thousand at a time in circulation, may fuf­  
fice tor this purpose.  
The tenth part of a dollar is but a small piece, and with the aid  
of the copper coins, will probably fuffifce for all the more minute  
uses of circulation. It is less than the least of the silver coins now  
in general currency in England.  
I he largest copper piece will nearly answer to the half-penny  
sterling, and the frnallefl of course to the farthing. Pieces of very  
small value are a great accommodation, and the means of a bene­  
ficial economy to the poor ; by enabling them to purchase, in small  
portions, and at a more reasonable rate, the neceH ries of which  
they ftarid in need. If they are only cents, the lowijt price for  
any portion of a vendible commodity, however inconlkierable in  
quantity, will be a cent ; if there are half cents, it will be a half  
cent ; and in a great number of cafe exa&amp;ly the fame things will  
be fold for a half ct nt, which if there were none would cost a cent.  
lsut a half cent is low enough for the minimum of price. Exccl­  
five minuteness would defeat its object. To enable the poorer  
cliflVs to pocuie neceffarics cheap, is to enable them with more  
comfort to themfelvej, to labor for less ; the ad\antagcs of which  
need no comment.  
  
The denominations of the silver coir.s contained in the resolu­  
tion of the 8: h of Atiguft, 1786, are concciv d to be fignificant  
and proper. The dollar is recommended by its correfpondenc)  
&quot;with the present coin ot thi;t name, for which it is designed to be  
a substitute; which will facilitate its ready adoption as luch in the  
minds of the citizens. The dime or tenth,the cent or hundredth,  
the mille or thoulandih are proper, because they exprels the pro­  
portions which they are intended to designate. It is only to be  
regret ed, that the meaning of these terms will not be familiar to  
those v, ho are not acquainted with the language from which they  
are bonowed. It woe to be wished, that the length, and in some  
degree the clumsiness of some of the corresponding terms in Eng­  
lish, did not difcouiage Irom pr ferring them. It is ufetul to ha\e  
names which fignify the things to which they belong; and, mre­  
fpccl to ohjefts of general use, in a manner intelligible to all. Per­  
haps it might be an improvement to let the dollar have the -  
lation either of dollar or unit (which last will be the mofl fignifi-*&#x27;  
cant) and to substitute &quot; tenth&quot; for dime. In time, the unit maj|  
succeed to the dollar. The word cent being in tile fn various iraft­  
aflions and inftiuments, will, without much d fficulty, be under­  
stood as the hundredth; and the half cent of couifc as the two  
hundredth part.  
  
The eagle, is not a very expreflive or apt appellation for the  
Jargt ft gold piece, but nothing b&lt; tter Occurs. The fmallcft of the  
gold coins may be called the dollar or unit, in common with the  
silver piece, with which it coincides.  
  
The volume or file of each piecc is a matter of more confe­  
rence than its denomination. It is evident, that the more {yc  
perficies or furfaee, the more the piece will be liable to be   
by frt&amp;ion ; or, in other words, the faftcr it will wear. For this  
reason, it is deferable to render the thickness in proportion to the  
breadth, as great as may consist wi h neatnef* and good appear­  
ance. Hence the form of the double guinea, or double louis d&#x27;or,  
is preferable to that of the half johannes, for the large gold piece.  
The finall one cannot well be of any other size than the Portuguele  
piece of eight, of the fame metal.  
  
As it is of confluence to fortify the idea of the identity of the  
dollar, it may be best to let the form and size of the new one, as  
far as the quantity of matter (the alloy being less) permits, agree  
■with the form and size of the present. The diameter may be the  
feme.  
  
The tenth may be in a mean between the Spanish 1-8 and 1-16  
of a dollar.  
  
The copper coins may be formed merely with a view to good  
appearance, as any difference in the wearing, that can result from

Report of the Secretary of the Treasury, on the  
fubjeift of a Mint.  
(concluded.)  
IT is conceived that the weight of the cent may be eleven penny  
weight, which will about correspond with the value of the  
copper and the expence of the coinage. Thia will be to conform to  
the rule of intrinsic value, as far as regard to the convenient size  
of the coins will permit; and the deduction of the expence of  
coinage in this cafe will be the more proper, as the copper coins,  
which have been current hitherto, have passed till lately for much  
mor,e than their intrinsic value. Taking the weight, as has been  
fuggcfted,|the size of the cent may be nearly that of the piece here­  
with transmitted, which weighs todwt. ugrs. 10m. Two thirds  
of the diameter of the cent will fuflice for the diameter of the half  
cent.  
  
It may perhaps be thought expedient, according to general  
praflice, to make the copper an of profit; but where  
this is done to any considerable extent, it is hardly poflible to have  
effedual security against counterfeits. This confederation, concur­  
ring with the soundness of the principle of prelerving the intrin­  
sic value of the money ot a country, seems to outweigh the confi­  
d ration of profit.  
  
The foregoing l&#x27;uggeiliom, refpefting the fizesofthe several coins,  
are made on the fuppohtion, that the legislature may think fit to  
regulate this matter : perhaps, however, it may be judged not un­  
advifeable to leave it to executive discretion.  
  
With regard to the proposed size of the cent, it is to be con­  
fefitd, that it is rather greater than might be wished, if it could  
&quot;with propriety and fafety be made less : and should the value of  
copper continueto decline, as it has done for iome time past, it is  
very queflionable, whether it will long remain alone a fit metal  
for money. This has led to a confederation of the expediency of  
uniting a small proportion ot silver with the copper, in order to  
be able to leflen the bulk of the inferior coins. For this, there are  
precedents in several paitsof Europe. In France, the composi­  
tion, which is called billion, has confided of one part silver and  
four parts copper ; according to which proportion, a cent might  
contain seventeen grains ; defraying out of the material the ex­  
pence of coinage. The conveniency of size is a recommendation  
ot such a species of coin; but the secretary is deterred from pro­  
posing it, by the apprehension of counterfeits.—The effc£l of so  
small a quantity of silver, in, comparatively so large a quantity of  
copper, could easily be imitated by a mixture of other metals of  
little value, and the temptation to doing it would not be incon­  
siderable.  
  
The devices of the coins are far from being matters of indiffer­  
ence,as they may be made the vehicles of ufeful impreflions. They  
ought therefore to be emblematical, but without lofmg fight of  
simplicity. The fewer sharp points and angles there are, the less  
will be the loss by wearing. The lecretary thinks it btft, on this  
head, to confine himfelf to these concise and general remarks.  
The last point to be difcufTed, refpe&amp;s the currency of foreign  
coins—  
  
The abolition of this, in proper season, is a necessary part of  
the system contemplated for the national coinage. But this, it  
will be expedient to defer, till some coniiderable progress has  
been made in preparing fubflitutes for them. A gradation may  
therefore be found moil convenient.  
  
The foreign coins may be fuffered to circulate, precisely upon  
their present footing, for one year after the mint fliall have com­  
menced its operations. The privilege may then be continued for  
another year to the gold coins of Portugal, England and France,  
and to the lilver coins of Spain. And these may dill be permit­  
ted to be current, for one year more, at the rates allowed to be  
given for them at the mint ; after the expiration of which the cir­  
culation of all foreign coins to cease.  
  
The monies, which will be paid into the treasury, during the  
firft year, being recoined, before they are iflued anew, will afford  
a partial substitute before any interruption is given to the pre-ex­  
iftmg supplies of circulation. The revenues of the succeeding  
year, and the coins which will be brought to the mint, in confc­  
quence of the discontinuance of their currency, will materially ex­  
tend the substitute, in the course of that year, and its extenfton  
will befofar encreafed, during the third year, by the facility of  
procuring the remaining species to be recoined, which will arise  
from the diminution of their current values, as probably to enable  
the dispensing wholly with the circulation of the foreign coins,  
after that period. The progress which the currency of bank-bills,  
will be likely to have made, during the fame time, will also afford  
a substitute of another kind.  
  
This arrangement, besides avoiding a sudden flagnation of cir­  
culation, will cause a considerable proportion of whatever loss  
may be incident to the establishment, in the firft instance, to fall,  
  
as it ought to do, upon the government, and will probably tend to  
diftributc the remainder of it more equally among the commu­  
nity.  
  
It may nevertheless be advifeable, in addition to the precautions  
here suggested, to repose a discretionary authority in the Pre­  
sident of the United States, to continue the currency of the Spanifli  
dollar, at a value corresponding with the quantity of fine silver  
contained in it, beyond the period above mentioned for the epila­  
tion of the circulation of the foreign coins. It is poflibte that an  
exception in favor of this particular species of coin may be found  
expedient ; and it mav tend to obviate inconveniences, if there be  
a power to naake the exception in a capacity to be exerted when  
the period shall arrive.  
The Secretary for the department of State, in his report to the  
House of Representatives, on the fubjett of eftablilhing a uniform­  
ity in the weights, measures and coins of the United States, has  
proposed that the weight of the dollar should correspond with  
the unit of weight. This was done on the supposition, that it  
would require but a very small addition to the quantity of metal,  
which the dollar, independently of the objedl he had in view,  
ought to contain ; in which he was guided by the relolution of  
the Bth of August, 1786—fixing the dollar at 375 grains and 64  
hundredths of a grain.  
Taking this as the prop r standard of the dollar, a Imall altera­  
tion for the fake of incorporating so systematic an idea would ap­  
pear deferable. But if the principles which have been reasoned  
from, in this report, are just, the execution ot that idea bccomes  
more iitr.cult. It would certainly not be advifeable to make on  
th it account, so considerable a change in the money unit, as would  
be produced by the addition of five grains of silver to the proper  
we?ght of the dollar, without a proportional augmentation ot its  
relative value. And to make such an augmentation would be to  
abandon the advantage of prefcrving the identity of the dollar, 01  
to speak more accurately, of having the proposed one received  
and considered, as a mere substitute lor the present.  
The end may however be obtained without either of those in­  
conveniencies, by encreafing the proportion of alloy in the silver  
coins. But this would destroy the uniformity, in that refpeft,  
between the gold and silver coins. It remains therefore to elett  
which of the two systematic ideas fnall be pursued or relinquished.  
And it may be remarked, that it will be more easy to convert the  
present silver coins into the proposed ones, ifthefe last have the  
fame, or near ly the fame proportion of alloy, than if they have  
less.  
  
The organization of the mint yet remains to be considered.  
This relates to the persons to be employed, and to the services  
which they are refpettively to perform. It is conceived that there  
ought to be  
  
A dirtftor of the mint, to have the general fuperintendance oi  
the business.  
  
An a flay matter, or aflayer, to receive the metals brought to the  
Siiint, afcertatn their finenefs, arid deliver them to be coined,  
A master coiner, to condutt the making o£ the coins.  
A cashier, to receive and pay them out.  
  
An auditor, to keep and adiuft the accounts of the mint.  
Clerks, as many as the directors of the mint (hall deem neces­  
sary, to afljlt the different officers.  
  
Workmen, as many as may be found requisite.  
  
A porter.  
In several of the European mints, there are various other offi­  
cers, but the foregoing arc those only, who appear to be indispen­  
sable. Persons in the capacity of clerks will fuffice instead of the  
others, with the advantage of greater economy.  
  
The number of workmen is left indefinite, because, at certain  
  
times, it is requisite to have more than at others. They will, how­  
ever, never be numerous. The ex pence of the establishment, in  
an ordinary year, will probably be from fifteen to twenty thou­  
sand dollars.  
  
The remedy for errors in the weight and alloy of the coins mufl  
necefTarily form a part in the system of a mint ; and the manner  
of applying it will require to be regulated. The following ac­  
count is given of the pra&amp;ice in England, in this particular.  
  
A certain number of pieces are taken promiscuously out of eve­  
ry fifteen pounds of gold coined at the mint, which is deposited  
for fafe keeping in a strong box called the pix. This box, from  
  
time to time, is opened in the presence of the lord chancellor, the  
officers of the treasury, and others ; and portions are fele£ted from  
the pieces of each coinage, which are melted together, and the  
mass afTayed by a jury of the company of goldsmiths. If the im-  
P&#x27;Ttettion and deficiency both in the finenefs and weight, fall  
ihort of a sixth of a carat, or 40 grains of pure gold upon a pound  
of standard, the mailer of the mint is held excusable ; because it  
is supposed that no workman can reasonably be answerable for  
greater exa&amp;nefs. The expediency of some similar regulation  
feeras to be manifeft.

On the Subject of a Mint. 263  
  
REPORT of the SECRETARY of the TREASURY  
on the Subject of a MINT.  
  
(Concluded from page 201)  
  
HIS point has been the longer dwelt upon, not only becawfe there is 2 diverfity of  
opinion among fpeculative men concerning it, and a diverfity in the practice of the  
moft confidcrable commercial nations; but becaufe the acts of our own government,  
under the confederation, have not only admitted the expediency ef defraying the ex-  
pence of coinage out of the metals themfeives ; bu: upon this idea have both made a  
cdu&amp;ion from the weight of the coins, and eftablifhed a difference between their re-  
guiated value and the mint price of bullion greater than would refult from that de-  
duction. This double operation in favour of a principle fo queftionable in itfelf, has  
made a more particular inveftigation of it a duty.  
  
The intention, however, of the preceding remarks, is rather to fhew, that the  
expectation of commercial advantages ought not to decide in favour of a daty on  
comage, and that if it fhould be adopted, it ought not to be inthe form of a deduc-  
tion from the intrinfic value of the coins—than abiolutely to exclude the idea of any  
difference, whatever, between the value of the metals in coin and in bullion. It is  
vot clearly difcerned, that a fmall difference between the mint price of builion, and  
ihe regulated value of the coins, would be pernicious, or that it might not even be  
advifable, in the firft inftance, by way of experiment, merely asa preventative to the  
melting down and exportation of the coins. This will now be fomewhat more par-  
ticularly confidered.  
  
The arguments for a coinage, entirely free, are, that it preferves the intrinfic value  
of the metals; that it makes the expence of fabrication a general inftead of a partial  
ax; amd that ittendsto premote the abundance of gold and filver, which it is allege  
ed will flow to that place, where they find the beft price, and from that place, where  
they are in any degree undervalued.  
  
The firft confideration has not much weight, as an objection ta a plan, which,  
without diminifhing the quantity of metals, in the coins, merely allows a lefs price  
for them inthe bullion at the national fatiory or mint. No rule of intrinfic value is vio-  
lated, by confidering the raw material, as worth lefs than the fabric, in proportion  
two the expemce of fabrication. And by divefting foreign coins of the privilege of  
circulating as money, they become the raw material  
  
The fecond confideration has perhaps greater weight. But it may not amownt toan  
objection, if it be the beft method of preventing dilorders in the coins, which it is in  
a particular manner the intereft of thofe, on whom the tax would fall, to prevent.  
The practice of taking gold by weight, which has of late years ubtained in Great-  
Britain, has been found, im fome degree, a remedy ; but this 1s inconvenient, and may  
on that account fall into difufe. Another circumftance has had a remedial operation.  
This is, the delays of the mint. It appears to be the practice there, not to make  
payment for the bullion, which is brought to be exchanged for cein, till it cither has  
in fa&amp;t or is pretended to have undergone the procefs of recoining.  
  
The neceflity of fulfilling prior engagements, is a caufe or pretext for pofponing  
the delivery of the coin in lieu of the bullion. And this delay creates a diffecence in  
the market price of the two things. Accordingly, for fome years paft, an ounce  
of ftandard gold, which is worth in coin £. 3. 17 104 fterling, has been in the mar-  
ket of London, in bullion, only £. 3 17 6, which is within a fmall fraction of one  
half per cent. lefs. Whether this be management in the mint to accommodate the  
bank in the purchafe ef builion, or to effec indire@ly fomething equivaient to a for-  
mal difference of price, er whether it be the natural cowrfe of the buduels, is open  
to conjecture.  
  
It, at the fame time, indicates, that if the mint were to make prompt payment,  
tt about half per cent. lefs than it does at prefent, the flate of bullion in refpect to  
coin, would be precifely the fame as it now is. And it would be then certain that  
the government would fave expence in the coinage of gold; fince it is not probable,  
that the time actually loft in the courfe of the year in converting bullion into coin, cast  
be an equivalent to half per cent. om the advance; and there will generally be at the

command of the treafury, a confiderable fum of money, waiting for fome periodica}  
difburfment, which without hazard might be applied to that advance.  
  
In what fenfe a free coinage can be faid to promote the abundance of gold and {j.  
ver, may he inferred from the inftances which have been given, of the tendency of  
acontrary fyftem to promote their exportation. It is, however, not probable, that  
a very (mall difference of value between coin and bullion can have any effec, which  
ought to enter into calculation. There can be no inducement of politive profit, to  
export the bullion, as long as the difference of price is exceeded by the expence of  
tranfportation. And the profpeét of fmaller lofs upon the metals, than upon com.  
modites when the difference is very minute, will be frequently over-balanced by the  
pofibility of doing better with the latter, from a rife of markets. It is at any rat  
certain, that it can be of no confequence, in this view, whether the fuperiority of  
coin to bullion inthe market be produced, as in England, by the delay of the mint, or  
by a formal difcrimination in the regulated values.  
  
Under an impreflion, that a fmall difference between the value of the coin, and the  
mint price of builion, is the leaft exceptionable expedient for reftraining the melting  
down, or exportation of the former, and not perceiving, that if it be a very moderate  
one, it can be hurtful in other refpeéts——the Secretary is inclined to an experiment  
of 4 per cent, on each of the metals. The fa&amp; which has been mentioned, with re-  
gard to the price of gold builion in the Englifh market, feems to demonftrate, that  
{uch a difference may fafely be made. In this cafe there muft be immediate payment  
for the gold and filver offered to the mint. How far 4 per cent. will go towards de-  
fraying the expence of the coinage cannot be determined beforehand, with accuracy,  
It is prefumed, that, on an economical plan, it will fuffice in relation to gold. But it  
is not expected, that the fame rate on filver will be fufficient to defray the expence at-  
tending that metal. Some additional provifion may therefore be found neceflary, if  
this limit be adopted.  
  
It does not feem to be advifeable, te make any greater difference in regard to filver  
than to gold : becaule it is defirable, that the proportion between the two metals, in  
the market, fhould correfpond with that in the coins, which would not be the cafe, if  
the mint price of one was comparatively lower than that of the other; and becaufe  
alfo filver being propofed to be rated in refpect to gold, fomewhat below its general  
commercial value, if there fhould be a difparity, to its advantage, in the mint prices  
of the two metals, it would obftruct too much the bringing of it to be coined, and  
would add an inducement to export it. Nor does it appear to the Secretary fale to  
make a greater difference

arent debafement of the coin. The effects of imagination and prejudice can-  
not fafely be difregarded in any thing that relates to money.—If the beauty of the coin  
be impaired, it may be found difficult to fatisfy the generality of the community, that  
what appears worfe is not really lefs valuable ; and it is not altogether certain, that  
sn impreffion of its being fo, may not occafion an unnatural augmentation of pri-  
ces.  
  
Greater danger of impofition, by counterfeits, is alfo to be apprehended from the  
injury which will be done to the appearance of the coin, It is a jult ob&#x27;ervation,  
that, “ The perfection of the coins is a great fafe-guard againf counterfeits.” And  
it is evident that the colour, as well as the excellence of the workmanthip, is an in-  
gredient in that perfection. The intermixture of too much alloy, particularly of cop-  
per, in the gold coins at leaft, muft materially leflen the facility of diftinguithing by  
the eye, the purer from the bafer kind, the genuine from the counterfeit.  
  
The inefficacy of the arrangement to the purpole intended to be anfwered by it, is  
rendered probable by different confiderations. Uf the ftandard of plate in the United  
States fhould be regulated according to that of the national coins, it isto be expected  
that the goldfmith would prefer thefe to the foreiyn coins; becaufe he would find  
them prepared to his hand, in the ftate which he delires; whereas he would have to  
expend an additional quantity of alloy to bring the foreign coins to that ftate. If the  
fandard of plate, by law or ufage, fhould be fuperior to that of the national coins,  
there would be a polflibility of the foreign coins bearing a higher price in the market;  
and this would not only obitruct their being brought tothe mint, but might occafion  
the exportation of the national coin in preference. It is not undertlood, that the  
practice of making an abatement of price for the inferiority of ftandard, is applicable  
to the Englith mint; and if it be not, this would alfo contribute to fruftrating the ex-  
pected effect from the increafe of alloy. For in this cafe, a given quantity of pure  
metal in our ftandard, would be worth as much there, as in bullion of the Englith or  
or any other ftandard.  
  
Confidering, thercfore, the uncertainty of the fuccefs of the expedient, and the in-  
convenicncies which feem incident to it, it would appear preferable to fubmit to thofe  
of afree coinage. It is obfervable, that additional expence, which is one of the prin-  
cipal of thefe, is alfo applicable to the propofed remedy.  
  
It is now proper to refume and finifh the anfwer to the firft queftion ; in order to  
which the three fucceeding ones have neceflarily been anticipated. The conclufion,  
to be drawn from the obfervations which have been made on the fubject, is this—  
That the unit, in the coins of the United States, ought to correfpond with 24 grains  
and 4 of a grain of pure gold, and with 371 and 4 of a grain of pure filver, each an-  
fwering to a dollar in the money of account. The former is exactly agrecable to the  
prefent value of gold, and the latter is within a {mall fraction of the mean of the two  
lait emiflions of dollars; the only ones which ate now found in common circulation,  
and of which the neweft is in the greateft abundance.  
  
‘the alloy in cach cafe to be 1-12 of the total weight, which will make the unit  
27 grains of ftandard gold, and 405 grains of ftandard filver.  
  
Each of thefe it has been remarked will anfwer to a dollar in the moncy of ac-  
count. Jt is conceived that nothing better can be done in relation to this, than to  
purfue the track marked out by the the refolution of the eighth of Augult, 1786.  
This has been approved abroad, as well as at home, and it is certain, that nothing can  
be more fimple or convenient, than the decimal fubdivifions. There is every reafou  
to expect the method will {pcedily grow into general ufe, when it thall be feconded

to be, as eftablithed by the refolution, a dollar; and its maltiples, dimes, cents, and  
mills; or tenths, hundredths, and theufandths.  
  
With regard to the number of different pieces which thall compofe the coins of  
the United States, two things are to be confulted—convenience of circulation, ang  
cheapnefs of the coinage. ‘The fir ought not to be facrificed to the laft; but as far  
as they can be reconciled to each other, it is defirable to do it. Numerous and fmalj  
(if not too minute) fubdivifions affitt circulation ; but the multiplication of the fmaller  
kinds increafes expence; the fame procefs being neceflary to a finall as to a large piece.  
  
As it is eafy to add, it will be moft advifable to begin with a fmall number, til}  
experience fhall decide whether any other kinds are neceflary. ‘The following, it is  
conceived, will be fufficient in the commencement.  
  
1 Gold piece, equal in weight and value, to ten units or dollars.  
  
1 Gold piece, equal toa tenth part of the former, and which thall be a unit or  
dollar  
  
1 Silver piece, which thall alfo be a unit or dollar.  
  
1 Silver piece, which thall be in weight and value a tenth part of the filver unit  
or dollar.  
  
1 Copper piece, which thall be of the value of a hundredth part of a dollar.  
  
1 Other Copper piece, which thall be half the value of the former.  
  
It is not propofed that the lighteft of the two gold coins fhould be numerous, as in  
larye payments, the larger the pieces, the fhorter the procefs of counting, the lef  
the riik of miftake, and confequently the greater the fafety and the convenience; and  
in fall payments, it is not perceived that any inconvenience can accrue, from an  
entire dependence on the filver and copper coins. The chief inducement to the efia  
blifhment of the fmall gold piece is to have a fenfible object in that metal, as well as  
in filver, to exprefs the unit. Fifty thoufand at a time in circulation, may fuflice for  
this purpofe.  
  
The tenth part of a dollar is but a fmall piece, and with the aid of the copper  
coins, will probably fuffice for all the more minute ufes of circulation. It is lefs than  
the leaft of the filver coins, now in general currency in England.  
  
The largeft copper piece will nearly anfwer to the half-penny fterling, and the  
fmalleft of courfe to the farthing. Pieces of very {mall value are a great accommo-  
dation, and the means of a beneficial economy to the poor; by enabling them to pur-  
chafe, in fmall portions, and at a more reafonable rate, the neceffaries of which they  
ftand in aced. If there are only cents, the loweft price for any portion of a vendible com-  
modity, however inconfiderable in quantity, will be a cent ; if there are half cents, it  
will be a half cent ; and in a great number of cafes exaly the fame things will be fold  
for a half cent, which if chere were none would coft acent. But a half cent is low e  
nough for the #inimum of price. Exceflive minutenefs would defeat its obje&amp;. To enable  
the poorer clafles to procure neceflaries cheap, is to enable them with more comfort to  
themfelves, to labour for lefs; the advantages of which need no comment.  
  
The denominations of the filver coins contained in the refolution of the 8th. of  
Auguft, 1786. are conceived to be fignificant and proper. ‘The dollar is recom-  
rhended by its correfpondency with the prefent coin of that name, for which it is de-  
figned to be a fubftitute, which will facilitate its ready adoption as fuch in the minds  
of the citizens, ‘The dime or tenth, the cent or hundredth, the mill or theufandth  
are proper, becaufe they exprefs the proportions which they are intended to defig-  
nate. It is only to be regretted, that the meaning of thefe terms will not be familiar  
to thofe who are not acquainted with the language from which they are borrowed.  
  
It were to be wifhed, that the length and in fome degree the clumfinefs of fome of  
the correfponding termts in Englith, did not difcourage from preferring them. It is  
ufeful to have names which fignify the things to which they belong; and, in refpeé  
to objects of general ufe, in a manner intelligible to all. Perhaps ie might be an  
improvement to let the dollar have the appellation either of dollar or unit (which  
latt will be moft fignificant) and to fubflitute “tenth” fer dime. In time the unit  
may fucceed to the dollar. The word cent being in ufe in various tranfa@ions and  
inftruments, will, without much difficulty, be underftood as the hundredth ; and the  
half cent of courfe as the two hundredth part.  
  
The eagle, is not a very expreffive or apt appellation for the largeft gold piece,  
but nothing better occurs. ‘The fmalleft of the gold coins may be called the dol-  
far or unit, in common with the filver piece, with which it coincides.

On the Subject of a Mint. 267  
  
The volume or fize of each picce, isa matter of more confeqrence than its de«  
nomination. It isevident, that the more fuperficies or furface, che more the piece will  
be liable to be injured by friclion ; or, in other words, the falter it will wear. For  
this reafon, it is defirable to render the thicknefs in proportion to breadth, as great os  
may confit with neatnefs and good appearance. Hence the form of the double gui-  
nea, or double louis d’or, is preferable to that of the half Johannes, for the large gold  
piece. The fmall one cannot weli be of any other Gize than the Portuguefe piece of  
eight, of the fame metal.  
  
As it is of confequence eo fortify the idea of the indentity of the dollar, it may he  
belt to let the form and fize of the new one, as far as the quantity of matter (the al-  
boy being lefs) permits, agree with the form and fize of the prefent. The diameter  
may be the fame.  
  
The tenths may be in a mean between the Spanifa 1-3 and 1-16 of a dollar.  
  
The copper coins may be formed merely with a view to good appearance, as any  
difference in the wearia:,that can refule from difference of form, can be of little con-  
fequence in reference to that metal.  
  
It is conceived, that the weight of the cent may be eleven penny-weights, which  
will about correipond with the value of the copper and the expence of coinage. “Vhis  
will be to conform to the rule of intrinfic value, as far as regard to the convenient  
fize of the coins will permit ; and the deduction of the expence of cvinage in this  
cafe will be the more proper, as the copper coins, which bave been current hitherto,  
have paffed till lately for much more than their intrinfic value. ‘Taking the weighe  
as has been fuggelted, the fizé of the cent may be nearly that of the piece herewith  
wanimitted, which weiyhs rodwt. t1grs. tom. ‘Iwo thirds of the diameter of the  
cent will fuffice for the diameter of the half cent.  
  
It may perhaps be thought expedient, according to the general practice, to make  
the copper cainage an object of profit; but where this is done to any confiderable  
extent, it is hardly poflible to have effectual fecurity againft counterfeits. This con-  
fideration concurring with the foundnefs of the principle of preferving the intrinfic  
value of the meney of a country, feems to outweigh the confideration of profit.  
  
The foregoing fuggeftions, refpecting the fizes of the feveral cvins, are made on  
the fuppofition, that the Legiflature may think fit to regulate this matter : Perhaps,  
however, it may be judged not unadvifeable to Icave it to executive difcretion.  
  
With regard to the propofed fize of the cent, it isto be confeffed, that it is rather  
greater than might be withed, if it could with propriety and fafety be made lefs: And  
thould the value of copper continue to decline, as it has done fur fome time pai, it is  
very queRionable, whether it will long remain alone a fit metal for money. ‘This  
has led to a confideration of the expediency of uniting a {mall proportion of filver  
with the cepper in order’ to be able to leffen the bulk of the inferior cvins, For this,  
there are precedents in feveral parts of Europe. In France, the compofition, which  
is called billion, has confifted of one part filver and four parts copper ; according to  
which proportion, a cent might contain feventeen grains; defraying out of the ma-  
terial the expence of coinage. The convenicncy of fize is a recommendation of fuch  
a fpecies of coin; but the Secretary is deterred from propoémg it, by the apprehenfi-  
on of counterfeits. —The effect of fo {mall a quantity of filver, in, comparitively fo  
large a quantity of copper, could eafily be imitated by a mixture of other metals of  
little value, and the temptatian todo it would not be inconfiderable.  
  
The devices of the coins are far from being matters of indifference, as they may  
be made the vehicles of ufeful impreffions. They ought therefore to be emblemati-  
cal, but without lofing fight of fimplicity, The fewer tharp points and angles there  
are, the lefs will be loft by wearing. The Sccretary thinks it beft, on this head, to  
confine himfelf to thefe concife and general remarks,  
  
The laft point to be difcuffed, refpedts the currency of foreign coins.  
  
The abolition of this, in proper feafon, is a neceffary part of the fyftem contem-  
plated for the national coinage. But this it will be expedient to defer till fome con-  
liderable progrefs has been made in preparing fubftitutes for them. A gradation may  
therefore be found moft convenient.  
  
The foreign coins may be fuffered to circulate, precifely upon their prefent footing,  
for one year after the mint fhall have commenced its operations. ‘lhe privilege may  
then be contigued for another year to the gold coins ef

s of the fuc. wi  
ceeding year, and the coins which will be brought to the mint, in confequence of the &#x27;  
difcontinuance of their currency, will materially extend the fubftitute, in the courfe to  
of that year, and its extention will be fo far increafed, during the third year, by the of  
faeility of procuring the remaining fpecies to be recoined, which will arife from the the  
diminution of their current values, as probably to enable the difpenfing wholly with ;  
the circulation of the foreign coins, after that period. The progrefs which the cur. pa  
rency of bank bills will be likely to have made, during the fame time, will alfo afford lat  
a fubfitute of another kind. lar  
  
This arrangement, befides avoiding a fudden ftagnation of circulation, will caufe )  
a confiderable proportion of whatever lofs may be incident to the eftablithment, in go  
the firit inftance, to fall, as it ought to do, upon the government, and will probably pu  
tend to diftribute the remainder of it more equally among the community. the  
  
It may neverthelefs be advifable, in addition tothe precautions here fuggefted, to ea  
repofe a difcretionary authority in the Prefident of the United States, to continue the pa  
currency of the Spanifh dollar, at a value correfpondiug with the quantity of fine fil. fal  
ver contained in it, beyond the period above mentioned for the ceflation of the circu. th  
lation of the foreign coins. It is poflible that an exception in favour of this particu. rei  
lar {pecies of coin may be found expedient: and it may tend to obviate inconvenien. gu  
  
cies, if there be a power to make the exception in a capacity to be exerted when the  
period {hall arrive.  
  
‘The Secretary for the department of State, in his report to the houfe of reprefen-  
tatives, on the fubject of eftablifhing a uniformity in the weights, meafures and  
coins of the United States, has propofed that the weight of the dollar fhould corref-  
pond with the unit of weight. This was done on the {uppofition, that it would require  
but a very {mall addition to the quantity of metal, which the dollar, independently  
of the object he had in view, ought to contain ; in which he was guided by the refolu- A  
&#x27; tion of the 8th. of Auguft, 1756—fixing the dollar at 375 grains and 64 hundredths  
  
of a grain.  
‘Taking this as the proper ftandard of the dollar, a {mall alteration for the fake of  
} incorporating fo fyftematic an idea would appear defirable. But if the principles  
  
  
  
which have been reafoned from, in this report, are juft, the execution of that idea  
becomes more difficult. It would certainly not be advifable to make, on that account, |  
io confiderable a‘change in the moncy unit, as would be produced by the addition of  
&#x27; five grains of filver to the proper weight of the dollar, without a proportional asug- J  
\ oe | mentation of its relative value. And tq make fuch an augmentation would be to a- fu  
i&quot; bandon the adyantage of preferving the identity of the dollar, or to fpeak more ac- th  
‘ curately, of having the propofed one received and confidered, as a mere fubftitute for d  
. the prefent. I  
i ‘The end may however be obtained without either of thofe inconveniencies, by in- I  
i creafing the proportion of alloy in the filver coins. But this would deftroy the uni- f  
formity, in that refpe@, between the gold and filver coins. It remains therefure to h  
\ clec&amp;t which of the two fy{tematic ideas fhail be purfued or relinquifhed. And it may .  
be remarked, that it will be more eafy te convert the prefent filver coins into the pro- ?  
: pofed ones, if thefe laft have the fame, or nearly the fame proportion of alloy, than  
if they have lefs. f  
‘The organization of the mint yet remains to be confidered. ul  
‘This relates to the perfons employed, and to the fervices which they are refpec- P  
tively to perform. It is conceived that there ought to be  
A Director of the Mint, to have the fuperintendence of the bufinefs, f  
An Affay Mafter, or Affayer, to receive the metals brought to the mint, afcer- t  
» tain their finenefs, and deliver them te be coined.  
A Matter Coiner, to conduct the making of the coins. &quot;  
A Cathier, to receive and pay them out.  
An Auditor, to keep and adjuft the accounts of the mint. 7  
Clerks, as many asthe directors of the mint fhall deem neceflary, to affift the :  
  
diffePent officers.  
  
  
  
Excife Bill. 269  
  
Workmen, as many as may be found requifite.  
  
A Porter.  
  
In feveral of the European mints, there are various other officers, but the foregoing  
are thofe only, who appear to be indifpenfable. Perfons in the capacity of clerks  
will fuflice inftead of the others, with the advantage of greater economy.  
  
The number of workmen is left indefinite, becaufe at certain times, it is requifite  
to have more than at others. They will however never be numerous. The expence  
of the eftablifhment, in an ordinary year, will probably be from fifteen to twenty  
thoufand dollars.  
  
The remedy for errors in the weight and alloy of the coins mu neceffarily form a  
part in the fyftem of a mint; and the manner of applying it will require to be regu-  
lated. The following account is given of the practice in England, in this particu-  
lar.  
  
A certain number of pieces are taken promifcuoufly out of every fifteen pounds of  
gold coined at the mint, which is depofited for fafe keeping in a ftrong box called the  
pix. This box, from time to time, is opened in the prefence of the lord chancellor,  
the officers of the treafury and others; and portions are feleéted from the pieces of  
each coinage, which are melred together, and che mafs aflayed by a jury of the com-  
pany of goldimiths. If the imperfection and deficiency both in finenefs and weight,  
fall fhort of a fixth of acarrat, or 40 grains of pure gold upon a pound of ftandard,  
the mafter of the mint is held excufable ; becaufe it is fuppofed that no workman can  
reafonably be anfwecrable for greater exactnefs. ‘The expediency of fome fimiliar re-  
gulation feems tu be manileft.  
  
All which is humbly fabmitted,

Secretary of the Treafury

gold the price which it commanded in their neigh-  
borhood, and particularly in the countries which  
formed the great sources of their supply, seems to  
indicate the fair proportion between the metals in  
the West Indies, since it is believed to have been,  
in most instances, confirmed by the colonial laws,  
yather than introduced by them. The difference  
established by custom in the U, States, between  
coined gold and silver, before the establishment of  
the present government, seemes to have been near-  
ly as 1 to 156-10. The difference proposed by con-  
gress, in their resolution of the 8th of August, 1786,  
was nearly 1 to 15 1-4; and the reduction in the valu-  
ation of gold, by the act of April 12th, 1792, to the  
proportion of 1 to 15, may be attributed to the belief,  
which was expressed in the report on which that

the general value of the metal in the commercial  
world. It is believed that, both in France and  
England, however, it is made penal to export or  
melt the coin.  
  
Upon the first establishment ofa mint in the Unit-  
ed States, the question of a seigneurage upon the  
coin was necessarily presented to the legislature.  
The secretary of the treasury, in his report on the  
establishment of a mint, urges the propriety of  
commencing our coinage without a seigneurage, or  
witha smail one. “It will be better to increase it  
hereafter,’ he says, “if this shall be found expedi-  
ent, than to recede from too considerable a differ-

plan for the support of public eredit, and that fea-  
  
ture of the plan which proposes the establishment

‘The last point to be discussed, respects the  
* currency of foreign coins. The abolition of this,  
‘in proper season, is a necessary part of the sys-  
*tem contemplated for the national coinage. But  
‘this it will be expedient to defer, till some con-  
‘siderable progress has been made in preparing  
* substitutes for them. A gradation may, therefore,  
*be found most convenient. The foreign coins  
‘may be suffered to circulate, precisely upon their  
‘ present footing, for one year after the mint shall  
hats commenced its operations. The privilege  
‘may then be continued for another year, to the  
* gold coins of Portugal, England, and France, and  
‘to the silver coins of Spain; and these may be  
* permitted to be current for one year more, at the  
* rates allowed to be given for them at the mint; after  
* the expiration of which, the circulation of all for-  
‘eign coins to cease. The moneys which will be  
* paid into the treasury during the first year, being  
* recoined before they are issued anew, will afford  
‘a partial substitute, before any interruption is  
  
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.  
  
* coins which will be brought to the mint, in con-  
* sequence of the discontinuance of their currency, will  
‘ materially extend the substitule in the course of  
that year; and its extension will be so far in-  
creased during the third year, by the facility of  
procuring the remaining specie to be recoined,  
|‘ which will arise from the diminution of their cur-  
| * rent values, as probably to enable the dispensing  
wholly with the circulation of the foreign coins  
‘after that period. Tue rroGress WHICH THE  
|* CURRENCY OF BANK BILLS WILL BE LIKELY TO  
HAVE MADE, DURING THE SAME TIME, WILL ALSO  
AFPPORD A SUBSTITUTE OF ANOTHER KIND. It may,  
‘nevertheless, be advisable to repose a discretion-  
‘ary authority in the President of the United  
‘ States, to continue the currency of the Spanish  
‘dollar, at a value corresponding with the quantity of  
‘ fine silver in it, beyond the period above men-  
‘tioned for the cessation of the circulation of

The unequal values allowed in different parts of the Union to coins of  
the same intrinsic worth; the defective species of them which embarrass the  
circulation of some of the States; and the dissimilarity in their several  
moneys of account, are inconveniences, which, if not to be ascribed to the  
want of a national coinage, will at least be most effectually remedied by the  
establishment of one—a measure that will, at the same time, give additional  
security against impositions by counterfeit as well as by base currencies.

The next inquiry toward a right determination or  
wliat ought lo bo the future money unit of the  
United States turns upon these questions: Whether  
it ought to be peculiarly attached 10 either of the  
uctals In preference to the other or not; and If to  
iithcr, to which of them?  
  
The augaestiona ami proceeding hitherto have  
had for object the annexing of It emphatically to  
the silver dollar. A resolution of Congress, of tho  
Mb of duly, 1780, declare! that the monoy unit of  
tbo UnltuubUtce shall bo a dollar, and another reso­  
lution of tho Hth of August, 1780, fixes that dollar  
st 373 grams and 04-lUO of a grain of flue silver.  
Thu same resolution, however, determines that  
there shall also bo (wo gold coins—one of IMOgralnt  
and 008 parts of a grain of pure gold, cuual  
to $lO, and tho other of half of that quantity  
of pnro gold, equal to,ss. And it la not  
explained whether either of the (wo species of  
ruins of gold or silver shall have any greater  
legality in payments than tho other. Yet It would  
reemibata preference in this particular la neces­  
sary to execute the Idea of attaching tho unit ex­  
clusively to one kind. If each of thorn bo as valid  
ns the other In payments to any amount, It is not  
obvious in what effectual seqso either of them can  
be deemed the money unit ralber than the other.  
If (bo general declaration that the dollar aball be  
tho money of the United Stales could no understood  
in olvo it a superior legality in payments, the in­  
stitution of coins of gold, and tho declaration (hat  
each of them shall bo equal to a certain number of  
dollars, would appear to destroy that Inferonco.  
And tffo circumstance of making tbo dollar tbo  
nultln the money account seems lo bo rather a  
matter of form than of suMlance.

It is therefore quoted entire. Hamilton is giving, let it be  
remembered, the reasons for preferring gold as the unit,  
rather than silver, provided either is to be chosen to the  
exclusion of the other:  
  
‘‘The inducement to such a preference is to render the unit as little variable  
as possible ; because on this depends the steady value of all contracts, and in a  
certain sense, of all other property. And it is truly observed, that if the unit  
belong indiscriminately to both the metals, it is subject to all the fluctuations  
that happen in the relative value which they bear to each other. But the same  
reason would lead to annexing it to that particular one which is itself the least  
liable to variation, if there be in this respect any discernible difference between  
the two.  
  
‘*Gold may, perhaps, in certain senses, be said to have greater stability than  
silver. As being of superior value, less liberties have been taken with it in  
the regulations of different countries. Its standard has remained more uniform,  
and it has in other respects undergone fewer changes ; as not being so much an  
article of merchandise, owing to the use made of silver in the trade with the  
East Indies and China, it is less liable to be influenced by circumstances of  
commercial demand. And if reasoning by analogy, it could be affirmed, that  
there is a physical probability of greater proportional increase in the quantity  
of silver than in that of gold, it would afford an additional reason for calculating  
on greater steadiness in the value of the latter.  
  
‘*As long as gold, either from its intrinsic superiority as a metal, from its  
greater rarity, or from the prejudices of mankind, retains so considerable a  
preéminence in value over silver, as it has hitherto had, a naturai consequence  
of this seems to be that its condition will be more stationary. The revolutions,  
therefore, which may take place, in the comparative value of gold and silver,  
will be changes in the state of the latter rather than in that of the former.”

not to attach the unit exclusively to either of the metals; because this cannot

The same idea of making a strictly honest silver dollar  
appears at various points in Hamilton’s report. “There can  
hardly be a better rule in any country for the legal than the  
market proportion; if this can be supposed to have been  
produced by the free and steady course of commercial prin-  
ciples. The presumption in such case is, that each metal finds  
its true level according to its intrinsic utility in the general  
system of money operations.”

Concerning several of these points Hamilton’s views deserve  
extended consideration. ‘‘As to the first point, the money  
unit,”’ he inquired, ‘“ What it actually is. The pound, though  
_ of various value, was the actual unit of the money of ac-  
  
count; but the manner of adjusting foreign exchanges indi-  
cated that the dollar was best entitled to be considered as

The immense disorder which actually reigns in so delicate and important a con-  
cern, and the still greater disorder which is every moment possible, call loudly for a  
reform. The dollar originally contemplated in the money transactions of this country,  
by successive diminutions of its weight and fineness, has sustained a depreciation of  
five per cent., and yet the new dollar has a currency, in all payments, in place of the  
old, with scarcely any attention to the difference between them. The operation of  
this in depreciating the value of property, depending upon past contracts; and (as far  
as inattention to the alteration in the coin may be supposed to leave prices stationary ),  
of all other property, is apparent. Nor can it require argument to prove that a nation  
ought not to suffer the value of the property of its citizens to fluctuate with the fluc-  
tuations of a foreign mint, and to change with the changes in the regulations of-a  
foreign sovereign. This, nevertheless, is the condition of one which, having no coins  
of its own, adopts with implicit confidence those of other countries.  
  
The unequal values allowed in different parts of the Union to coins of the same  
intrinsic worth; the defective species of them which embarrass the circulation of some  
of the States ; and the dissimilarity in their several moneys of account; are incon-  
veniences, which, if not to be ascribed to the want of a national coinage, will at least  
be most effectually remedied by the establishment of one —a measure that will, at the  
same time, give additional security against impositions by counterfeit as well as by  
base currencies.  
  
It was with great reason, therefore, that the attention of Congress, under the  
late Confederation, was repeatedly drawn to the establishment of a mint; and it is  
with equal reason that the subject has been resumed, now that the favorable change  
which has taken place in the situation of public affairs, admits of its being carried into  
execution.

The Secretary then discusses various particulars as to the nature of the money unit, the  
proportion between gold and silver, and of the alloys to be used, the methods of meeting the  
expense of coinage, the numbers, denominations, devices, and sizes of the coins, and whether  
foreign coins shall be permitted to be current. Much of his discussion of some of these points  
applies with great force to the ‘silver question” to-day,  
  
The greater stability of value of the gold coins is an argument of force for regard-  
ing the money unit as having been hitherto virtually attached to gold, rather than to  
silver. ‘Twenty-four grains and six-eighths of a grain of fine gold have corresponded  
with the nominal value of the dollar in the several States, without regard to the  
successive diminutions of its intrinsic worth. But, if the dollar should, notwithstand-  
ing, be supposed to have the best title to being considered as the present unit in the  
coins, it would remain to determine what kind of dollar ought to be understood; or,  
in other words, what precise quantity of fine silver.  
  
  
  
1Sgt.| AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NUMISMATICS. 29  
  
The old piaster of Spain, which appears to have regulated our foreign exchanges,  
weighed 17 dwt. 12 grains, and contained 386 grains and 15 mites of fine silver. But  
this piece has been long since out of circulation. The dollars now in common cur-  
rency, are of recent date, and much inferior to that, both in weight and fineness. The  
average weight of them, upon different trials, in large masses, has been found to be  
17 dwt. 8 grains. Their fineness is less precisely ascertained ; the results of various  
assays, made by different persons, under the direction of the late Superintendent of  
the Finances, and of the Secretary, being as various as the assays themselves. The  
difference between their extremes is not less than 24 grains in a dollar of the same  
weight and age ; which is too much for any probable differences in the pieces. It is  
rather to be presumed, that a degree of inaccuracy has been occasioned by the want of  
proper apparatus, and, in general, of practice. The experiment which appears to have  
the best pretensions to exactness would make the new dollar to contain 370 grains  
and 933 thousandth parts of a grain of pure silver.  
  
According to an authority on which the Secretary places reliance, the standard  
of Spain, for its silver coin, in the year 1761, was 261 parts fine, and 27 parts alloy ; at  
which proportion, a dollar of 17 dwt. 8 grains, would consist of 377 grains of fine silver  
and 39 grains of alloy. But there is no question that this standard has been since  
altered considerably for the worse: to what precise point, is not as well ascertained as  
could be wished ; but, from a computation of the value of dollars in the markets both  
of Amsterdam and London (a criterion which cannot materially mislead), the new  
lollar appears to contain about 368 grains of fine silver, and that which immediately  
preceded it about 374 grains.

In the suggestions concerning a coinage for the United States, though not with-  
out much hesitation, arising from a deference for those ideas, the Secretary is, upon  
the whole, strongly inclined to the opinion, that a preference ought to be given to  
neither of the metals, for the money unit. Perhaps, if either were to be preferred, it  
ought to be gold rather than silver. . . . . The revolutions, therefore, which may take  
place in the comparative value of gold and silver, will be changes in the state of the  
latter, rather than in that of the former. ... .  
  
One consequence of overvaluing either metal, in respect to the other, is the  
banishment of that which is undervalued. If two countries are supposed, in one of  
which the proportion of gold to silver is as 1 to 16, in the other as I to 15, gold being  
worth more, silver less, in one than in the other, it is manifest, that, in their reciprocal  
payments, each will select that species which it values least, to pay to the other,  
where it is valued most. Besides this, the dealers in money will, from the same cause,  
often find a profitable traffic in an exchange of the metals between the two countries.  
And hence it would come to pass, if other things were equal, that the greatest part of  
the gold would be collected in one, and the greatest part of the silver in the other.  
Facts, too, verify the inference: In Spain and England, where gold is rated higher  
than in other parts of Europe, there is a scarcity of silver; while it is found to abound  
in France and Holland, where it is rated higher, in proportion to gold, than in the  
neighboring nations. And it is continually flowing from Europe to China and the  
ast Indies, owing to the comparative cheapness of it in the former, and dearness of it

The component ingredients of the alloy in each metal will also require to be  
regulated. In silver, copper is the only kind in use, and it is doubtless the only  
proper one. In gold, there is a mixture of silver and copper; in the English coins  
consisting of equal parts; in the coins of some other countries, varying from } to 3  
silver,  
  
The reason of this union of silver with copper is this: The silver counteracts the  
tendency of the copper to injure the color or beauty of the coin, by giving it too much  
redness, or rather a coppery hue, which a small quantity will produce ; and the copper  
prevents the too great whiteness which silver alone would confer, It is apprehended,  
that there are considerations which may render it prudent to establish, by law, that

more than 4, nor less than }; vesting a discretion in some proper place to regulate  
the matter within those limits, as experience in the execution may recommend.  
  
A third point remains to be discussed, as a pre-requisite to the determination of  
the money unit, which is, whether the expense of coining shall be defrayed by the  
public, or out of the material itself; or, as it is sometimes stated, whether coinage  
shall be free, or shall be subject to a duty or imposition? This forms, perhaps, one of  
the nicest questions in the doctrine of money.  
  
The practice of different nations is dissimilar in this particular. In England,  
coinage is said to be entirely free: the mint price of the metals in bullion, being the  
same with the value of them in coin. In France, there is a duty, which has been, if it  
is not now, eight per cent. In Holland, there is a difference between the mint price  
and the value in the coins, which has been computed at .96, or something less than  
one per cent. upon gold; at 1.48, or something less than one and a half per cent. upon  
silver. The resolution of the 8th of August, 1786, proceeds upon the idea of a reduc-  
tion of half per cent. from gold, and of two per cent. from silver, as an indemnification  
for the expense of coining.

THE question of free coinage so persistently pressed by the “silver men” was discussed  
by Alexander Hamilton, in a communication to Congress in January, 1791. At that time the  
quantity of silver offering for coinage was so small, comparatively, that it was the policy of  
the Mint to attract silver bullion, and as an inducement the Secretary was somewhat inclined  
to favor free coinage. It is unnecessary to say that this was before the yield of our silver  
mines had so enormously increased. The question discussed, ¢. ¢., whether the expense of  
coining shall be defrayed by the public, or out of the material itself, was stated in the extrac

from Secretary Hamilton’s paper given in the last Journal [p. 30]. An abstract of his argu-  
ment is given in the extracts from his paper, printed below.  
  
Upon the supposition that the expense of coinage ought to be defrayed out of  
the metals, there are two ways in which it may be effected : one by a reduction of the  
quantity of fine gold and silver in the coins, the other by establishing a difference  
between the value of those metals in the coins, and the mint price of them in bullion.  
The first method appears to the Secretary inadmissible. He is unable to distinguish  
an operation of this sort from that of raising the denomination of the coin—a measure  
which has been disapproved by the wisest men of the nations in which.it has been  
practiced, and condemned by the rest of the world. To declare that a less weight of  
gold or silver shall pass for the same sum, which before represented a greater weight,  
or to ordain that the same weight shall pass for a greater sum, are things substantially  
of one nature. The consequence of either of them, if the change can be realized, is  
to degrade the money unit ; obliging creditors to receive less than their just dues, and  
depreciating property of every kind. For it is manifest, that everything would, in  
this case, be represented by a less quantity of gold and silver than before. It is  
sometimes observed, on this head, that, though any article of property might, in fact,  
be represented by a less actual quantity of pure metal, it would nevertheless be repre-  
sented by something of the same intrinsic value. Every fabric, it is remarked, is  
worth intrinsically the price of the raw material and the expense of fabrication; a  
truth not less applicable to a piece of coin than to a yard of cloth. ;  
  
This position, well founded in itself, is here misapplied. It supposes that the  
coins now in circulation are to be considered as bullion, or, in other words, as a raw  
material. But the fact is, that the adoption of them as money, has caused them to  
become the fabric; it has invested them with the character and office of coins, and  
has given them a sanction and efficacy equivalent to that of the stamp of the sove-  
reign. . . It is, however, not improbable, that the effect meditated would be defeated  
by a rise of prices proportioned to the diminution of the intrinsic value of the coins.  
This might be looked for in every enlightened commercial country; but, perhaps, in  
none with greater certainty than in this; because, in none are men less liable to be  
the dupes of sounds ; in none has authority so little resource for substituting names  
for things. A general revolution in prices, though only nominally, and in appearance,  
could not fail to distract the ideas of the community, and would be apt to breed  
discontents as well as among all those who live on the income of their money, as  
among the poorer classes of the people, to whom the necessaries of life would seem to  
have become dearer. In the confusion of such a state of things, ideas of value would  
not improbably adhere to the old coins, which from that circumstance, instead of  
feeling the effect of the loss of their privilege as money, would, perhaps, bear a price  
in the market, relatively to the new ones, in exact proportion to weight.  
  
Among the evils attendant on such an operation, are these: creditors, both of the  
public and of individuals, would lose a part of their property; public and private credit  
would receive a wound; the effective revenues of the Government would be dimin-  
ished. There is scarcely any point, in the economy of national affairs, of greater

moment than the uniform preservation of the intrinsic value of the money unit. On  
this, the security and steady value of property essentially depend.  
  
The second method, therefore, of defraying the expense of the coinage out of the  
metals, is greatly to be preferred to the other. This is to let the same sum of money  
continue to represent in the new coins exactly the same quantity of gold and silver  
is it does in those now current —to allow at the mint such a price only for those  
metals as will admit of profit just sufficient to satisfy the expense of coinage ; to  
abolish the legal currency of the foreign coins, both in public and private payments ;  
and, of course, to leave the superior utility of the national coins for domestic pur-  
poses, to operate the difference of market value, which is necessary to induce the  
bringing of bullion to the mint. In this case, all property and labor will still be repre-  
sented by the same quantity of gold and silver as formerly; and the only change  
which will be wrought, will consist in annexing the office of money exclusively to  
the national coins; consequently, withdrawing it from those foreign countries, and  
suffering them to become, as they ought to be, mere articles of merchandise.  
  
The arguments in favor of a regulation of this kind are, first: That the want of  
it is a cause of extra expense; there being, then, no motive of individual interest to  
distinguish between the national coins and bullion, they are, it is alleged, indiscrimin-  
ately melted down for domestic manufactures, and exported for the purposes of foreign  
trade; and it is added, that when the coins become light by wearing, the same quantity  
of fine gold or silver bears a higher price in bullion than in the coins; in which state  
of things, the melting down of the coins to be sold as bullion is attended with profit ;  
and from both causes, the expense of the mint, or, in other words, the expense of  
maintaining the specie capital of the nation, is materially augmented. Secondly. That  
the existence of such a regulation promotes a favorable course of exchange, and bene-  
fits trade, not only by that circumstance, but by obliging foreigners, in certain cases,  
to pay dearer for domestic commodities, and to sell their own cheaper.  
  
As far as relates to the tendency of a free coinage to produce an increase of  
expense in the different ways that have been stated, the argument must be allowed to  
have foundation, both in reason and in experience. . . [This the Secretary shows in  
various ways from the experience of Great Britain and France. |  
  
But the remainder of the argument stands upon ground far more questionable.  
It depends upon very numerous and very complex combinations, in which there is  
infinite latitude for fallacy and error. The most plausible part of it, is thatewhich  
relates to the course of exchange. Experience in France has shown that the market  
price of bullion has been influenced by the mint difference between that and coin;  
sometimes to the full extent of the difference; and it would seem to be a clear  
inference, that, whenever that difference materially exceeded the charges of remitting  
bullion from the country where it existed, to another in which coinage was free,  
exchange would be in favor of the former. . . Whenever the price of coin to bullion,  
in the market, materially exceeded the par of the metals, it would become an object to  
send the bullion abroad, if not to pay a foreign balance, to be invested in some other  
way, in foreign countries, where it bore a superior value; an operation by which  
immense fortunes might be amassed, if it were not that the exportation of the bullion  
would of itself restore the intrinsic par. But, as it would naturally have this effect,  
the advantage supposed would contain in itself the principle of its own destruction.  
As long, however, as the exportation of bullion could be made with profit, which is as  
long as exchange could remain below par, there would bea drain of the gold and  
silver of the country. . .  
  
Nothing can show more clearly than this argument — the truth of which has been amply  
confirmed by experience — the fallacy of the position taken by the “silver-maniacs.” Admit-  
ting the soundness of his argument as a demonstrated fact, its converse is equally true. Th

The other advantages supposed, of obliging foreigners to pay dearer for domestic  
commodities, and to sell their own cheaper, are applied to a situation which includes a  
favorable balance of trade. It is understood in this sense—the prices of domestic  
commodities, (such, at least, as are peculiar to the country,) remain attached to the  
denominations of the coins. When a favorable balance of trade realizes in the market  
the mint difference between coin and bullion, foreigners, who must pay in the latter,  
are obliged to give more of it for such commodities than they otherwise would do,  
Again, the bullion, which is now obtained at a cheaper rate in the home market, will  
procure the same quantity of goods in the foreign market, as before: which is said to  
render foreign commodities cheaper. In this reasoning, much fallacy is to be sus-  
pected. If it be true, that foreigners pay more for domestic commodities, it must be  
equally true that they get more for their own when they bring them themselves to  
market. If peculiar, or other domestic commodities adhere to the denominations of  
the coins, no reason occurs why foreign commodities of a like character should not do  
the same thing; and, in this case, the foreigner, though he receive only the same  
value in coin for his merchandise as formerly, can convert it into a greater quantity of  
bullion. Whence the nation is liable to lose more of its gold and silver than if their  
intrinsic value in relation to the coins were preserved. And whether the gain or the  
loss will, on the whole, preponderate, would appear to depend on the comparative  
proportion of active commerce of the one country with the other.

The intention of the preceding remarks is rather to show that the expectation of  
commercial advantages ought not to decide in favor of a duty of coinage, and that, if it  
should be adopted, it ought not to be in the form of a deduction from the intrinsic  
value of the coins, — than absolutely to exclude the idea of any difference whatever,  
  
between the value of the metals in coin and in bullion. It is not clearly discerned, that  
a small difference between the mint price of bullion and the regulated value of the  
coins would be pernicious, or that it might not even be advisable, in the first instance,  
by way of experiment, merely as a preventative to the melting down and exportation  
of the coins. |The argument of the Secretary on this point must be deferred to a  
subsequent number. |

Tue arguments for a coinage entirely free, are, that it preserves the intrinsic  
value of the metals; that it makes the expense of fabrication a general instead of  
partial tax ; and that it tends to promote the abundance of gold and silver, which, it  
is alleged, will flow to that place where they find the best price, and from that place  
where they are in any degree undervalued.  
  
The first consideration has not much weight, as an objection to a plan which,  
without diminishing the quantity of metals in the coins, merely allows a less price for  
them in bullion at the national factory or mint. No rule of intrinsic value is violated,  
by considering the raw material as worth less than the fabric in proportion to the  
expense of fabrication. And by divesting foreign coins of the privilege of circulating  
as money, they become the raw material.  
  
The second consideration has perhaps greater weight. But it may not amount  
to an objection, if it be the best method of preventing disorders in the coins, which it  
is, in a particular manner, the interest of those on whom the tax would fall, to pre-  
vent. The practice of taking gold by weight, which has of late years obtained in  
Great Britain, has been found, in some degree, a remedy; but this is inconvenient,  
and may, on that account, fall into disuse. Another circumstance has had a remedial  
operation. This is the delays of the mint. It appears to be the practice there, not to  
make payment for the bullion which is brought to be exchanged for coin, till it either  
has in fact, or is pretended to have undergone the process of recoining. . . . In what  
sense a free coinage can be said to promote the abundance of gold and silver, may be  
inferred from the instances which have been given of the tendency of a contrary  
system to promote their exportation. It is, however, not probable, that a very small  
difference of value between coin and bullion can have any effect which ought to enter  
into calculation. There can be no inducement of positive profit to export the bullion,  
as long as the difference of price is exceeded by the expense of transportation. And  
the prospect of smaller loss upon the metals than upon commodities, when the differ-  
ence is very minute, will be frequently overbalanced by the possibility of doing better  
with the latter, from a rise of markets. It is, at any rate, certain, that it can be of no  
consequence in this view, whether the superiority of coin to bullion in the market,  
be produced, as in England, by the delay of the mint, or by a formal discrimination in  
the regulated values.  
  
Under an impression that a sma// difference between the value of the coin and  
the mint price of bullion, is the least exceptionable expedient for restraining the  
melting down, or exportation of the former, and not perceiving that, if it be a very  
moderate one, it can be hurtful in other respects, the Secretary is inclined to an experi-  
ment of one half per cent. on each of the metals. The fact which has been mentioned,  
with regard to the price of gold bullion in the English market, seems to demonstrate  
that such a difference may safely be made. In this case, there must be immediate  
payment for the gold and silver offered to the mint. How far one half per cent. will  
go towards defraying the expense of the coinage cannot be determined beforehand  
with accuracy. It is presumed that, on an economical plan, it will suffice in relation °  
to gold. But it is not expected that the same rate on silver will be sufficient to defray  
the expense attending that metal. Some additional provision may, therefore, be found  
necessary, if this limit be adopted.  
  
It does not seem advisable to make any greater difference in regard to silver  
than to gold ; because it is desirable that the proportion between the two metals in  
the market, should correspond with that in the coins, which would not be the case if  
the mint price of one was comparatively lower than that of the other; and because,  
also, silver being proposed to be rated in respect to gold, somewhat below its general  
commercial value, if there should be a disparity to its disadvantage in the mint prices

of the two metals, it would obstruct too much the bringing of it to be coined, and  
would add an inducement to export it. Nor does it appear to the Secretary safe to  
make a greater difference between the value of coin and bullion than has been men-  
tioned. It will be better to have to increase it, hereafter, if this be found expedient,  
than to have to recede from too considerable a difference, in consequence of evils  
which have been experienced.  
  
[The Secretary next discusses the expediency of the use of alloys to prevent the  
export of coined money, or its being turned into bullion.] It is sometimes mentioned,  
as an expedient, which, consistently with a free coinage, may serve to prevent the  
evils desired to be avoided, to incorporate in the coins a greater proportion of alloy  
than is usual; regulating their value, nevertheless, according to the quantity of pure  
metal they contain. This, it is supposed, by adding to the difficulty of refining them,  
would cause bullion to be preferred, both for manufacture and exportation.  
  
But strong objections lie against this scheme —an augmentation of expense ; an  
actual depreciation of the coin; a danger of still greater depreciation in the public  
opinion ; the facilitating of counterfeits; while it is questionable whether it would  
have the effect expected from it... .  
  
The inefficacy of the arrangement to the purpose intended to be answered by it,  
is rendered probable by different considerations. If the standard of plate in the  
United States should be regulated according to that of the national coins, it is to be  
expected that the goldsmith would prefer these to the foreign coins, because he would  
find them prepared to his hand, in the state which he desires ; whereas he would have  
to expend an additional quantity of alloy to bring the foreign coins to that state. If  
the standard of plate, by law or usage, should be superior to that of the national coins,  
there would be a possibility of the foreign coins bearing a higher price in the market ;  
and this would not only obstruct their being brought to the mint, but might occasion  
the exportation of the national coin in preference. It is not understood, that the  
practice of making an abatement of price for the inferiority of standard, is applicable  
to the English mint; and if it be not, this would also contribute to frustrating the  
expected effect from the increase of alloy. For, in this case, a given quantity of pure  
metal, in our standard, would be worth as much there, as in bullion of the English, or  
any other standard.  
  
Considering, therefore, the uncertainty of the success of the expedient, and the  
inconveniences which seem incident to it, it would appear preferable to submit to  
those of a free coinage. It is observable, that additional expense, which is one of the  
principal of these, is also applicable to the proposed remed

just observation that ‘the perfection of coins is a great safeguard against  
counterfeits.’ ‘* The eagle is not a very expressive or apt appellation for the  
largest gold piece, but nothing better appears.” ‘The devices of the coins  
are far from being matters of indifference, as they may be made the vehicles  
of useful impressions. They ought therefore to be emblematical, but without  
losing sight of simplicity. The fewer sharp points and angles there are, the  
less will be the loss by wearing.” Hamilton’s report was sent to the Senate.

Alexander Hamilton, In his report on  
the establishment of a mint In 1791,  
recognized the convenience of the dol­  
lar as a unit of value, but in regard to  
the silver coin Of that day said:  
That species of coin has never had any  
settled or standard value, according to  
weight or fineness, but has been permitted  
to circulate by tale without regard to  
either, very much as a mere mon.;y of  
convenience, while gold has had a fixed  
price by weight, and with an eye to its  
fineness. This greater stability of the value  
of the gold coin is an argument of force  
for regarding the motley untt as having  
been hitherto virtually attracted to -gold,  
rather than to silver.  
Hamilton was a bimetallist,&#x27; and de­  
voted a large, part of this report to dem­  
onstrating that the money unit should  
not be attached peculiarly to either of  
the metals. He concluded: &quot;The Secre­  
tary is, upon the whole, strongly in­  
clined to the opinion that a preference  
ought to be given to neither of the met­  
als for the money unit. Perhaps if  
either were to be preferred it ought to  
be gold Instead of silver.&quot; He accepted  
the term &quot;dollar&quot; as a designation for  
the unit of value, though he thought  
that &quot;In time the unit may succeed to  
the dollar.&quot;  
These suggestions of Jefferson and  
Hamilton, and the coinage act as finally  
passed April 2, 1792, show that in all the  
monetary discussions of that day the  
word unit was used as an abstract term  
to designate a unit ot value. It had no  
necessary connection with either silver  
or gold, the coinage of the unit in silver  
being, as Hamilton said, &quot;to fortify th

One consequence of overrating either  
metal, in respect to the other, is the ban­  
ishment of that which is undervalued.  
(Hamilton understood Gresham&#x27;s law.)  
If two countries are supposed, in one of  
which the proportion of gold to silver is  
as 1 to 16, in the other as 1 to 15, gold toeing  
worth more, &#x27; sdver less, in one than in the  
other, it is manifest that in their reciprocal  
payments each will select . that species  
which it values least to pay to the other  
where it is valued most. Besides this, the  
dealers In money will, from the same  
cause, often find a profitable- traffic in an  
exchange of the metals between the two  
countries. And hence it would come to  
pass, if other things were equal, that the  
greatest part of the gold would be collected  
in one and the greatest part of the silver  
in the other.  
Hamilton discussed the question of  
ratio at considerable length on the line  
above indicated. He analyzed the ratios  
then prevailing in different countries of  
Europe and gave full weight to our  
commercial relations with them. He  
gave no encouragement to the now  
prevalent idea that; the relative com­  
mercial value of the metals can be over-.  
ruled by law. &quot;There can hardly be a  
better rule in any country for the legal  
proportion,&quot; he said, &quot;than the market  
proportion if this can be supposed to  
have been produced by the free and  
steady course of commercial principles.  
The presumption In such case is that  
each metal finds its true level, accord­  
ing to its Intrinsic utility, in the general  
system of money operations.&quot; Hamilto

secretary of the treasury were made  
law April 2, 1792: &quot;As long as gold,  
either from its intrinsic superiority as  
a metal, from its rarity, or from the  
prejudices of mankind, retains so con  
siderable a pre-eminence in value over  
silver as it had hitherto had, a natural

of the former.&quot;

reason that it would be too small to

&#x27;As long as gold , either from Its Intrinsic  
superiority as a metal , from I&#x27;s greater rarity  
or from thp prejudices of mankind , retains  
so considerable a prominence In value over  
silver as It has hitherto had , a natural con­  
sequence of this seems to be that its con­  
dition will remain more stationary. The rev­  
olutions , therefore , which may take place  
In the comparative value of gold and silver  
will be changes In the state of the latter  
rather than In that of the former. But  
upon the whole , It seems to be most advis­  
able , as has been observed , not to attach  
the unit exclusively to either of the metals ,  
because this cannot bo done effectually with­  
out destroying the office and character of one  
of them as money and reducing it to the  
situation of a mere merchandise , which , ac­  
cordingly , at different times , has been pro­  
posed from different and very respectable  
quarters , but which would probably be a  
greater evil than occasional variations In  
tbo unit from the fluctuations In the relative  
values of the metals , especially If care be­  
taken to regulate the proportion between  
them with an eye to the average commercial  
value. &#x27;  
&quot;The conclusion to bs drawn from the ob­

24 % grains of pure gold and with 371&#x27;/i

“As long as gold, either from its intrinsic su-  
periority as a metal, from its greater rarity, or  
from the prejudices of mankind, retains s0 con-  
siderable a preéminence in value over silver as it  
has hitherto had, a natural consequence of this  
seems to be that its condition will remain more  
stationary. The revolutions, therefore, which  
may take place in the comparative value of gold  
and silver will be changes in the state of the /at-  
ter rather than inthat of the former, .. . Bat  
upon the whole it seems to be most advisable, as  
has been observed, not to attach the unit exclu-  
sively to either of the metals; because this can-  
not be done effectually without destroying the  
office and character of one of them as meney and  
reducing it to the situation of a mere merchan-  
dise, which accordingly at different times has  
been proposed from different and very respecta-  
ble quarters, but which would probably be a  
greater evil than occasional variations in the  
unit from the fluctuations in the relative value of  
the metals, especially if care be taken to regulate  
the proportions between them with an eye to  
their average commercial value. . . The  
conclusion to be drawn from the observations  
which have been made on the subject is this:

this as it was known that Jefferson had been  
a silver man for some eight years previously,

it had the greater stability. Hamilton was of  
the opinion that no inconvenience was likely

tho nature of the money unit of the United  
States?&quot; llamiiltoii says, among other  
things: &quot;As long ns gold, either from its  
intrinsic superiority as a metal from its  
greater rarity or from the prejudices of  
mankind, retains so considerable a pre­  
eminence in valuo over silver as it has  
hitherto had, a natural consequence of  
this scorns to be that its condition will re­  
main more stationary. The revolutions,  
therefore, which may take place in the  
comparative value of gold and silver will  
bo changed in the state of the latter,  
rather than in that of tho former. Hut  
uHn tho whole it seems to be most id­  
visable as has been observed, not to attach  
the unit exclusively to either of the metals  
because this can not Iks done eectually  
without destroying the ollico and char­  
acter of a mere merchandise, which ac­  
cordingly at the different times has boon  
proposed from different and very respect­  
able quarters, but which would probably  
be a greater evil than occasional variations  
in tho unit, from the fluctuations in the  
relative values of the metals, especially if  
care be taken to regulate the proposition  
between them with an eye to their average  
commercial vaJue.  
The conclusion to b drawn from tho ob­  
servations which have ben made on the  
subject is that the unit in the coins of the  
United State ought to correspond wih 24  
grains nnd three-fourhs of a grain of pure  
gold, and with 371 grains and one-fourth  
of a grain of pure silver, each answering  
to a dollar in the money of account.

The discussion as was printed in the  
opinion of Judge Vincent yesterday  
discloses one very important point,  
to notice which is the main purpose  
in writing this,-the effect of conlin  
ing the unit to one metal. Alexan­  
der Hamilton, the founder of the  
financial system of the United States,

congress, said this:  
&quot;But, upon the whole, it seems  
to be most advisable, as has been  
observed, not to attach the unit e

cause this cannot be done effectuall  
without destroying the office and  
character of one of them as mond,

different countries what Senator Tur­

was in full accord with Jefferson, as

Hamilton said:

Referring to the unit Hamilton says: ‘‘If the general declaration, that  
the dollar shall be the money unit of the United States, could be understood  
to give it a superior legality in payments, the institution of coins of gold,  
and the declaration that each of them shall be egual to a certain number of

making the dollar the unit in the money of account seems to be rather a

that Judge Powers had in mind and  
that is that Alexander Hamilton the  
father of the protectionist system in  
America the man who believed in a  
strong government in which the rich  
and the well born should rule was a  
gold standard man while Thomas Jef­  
ferson the author of the Declaration

GRAVE RESULTS  
Would Follow the Refusal to Pay  
Out Gold, Bays Secretary Carlsle.  
In his annual report, made public on  
December 16, Secretary Carlisle ex­  
poses the grave results that would fol­  
low if the treasury department should  
refuse to pay out gold, even for one  
hour, as some good-intentioned per­  
sons would have it do. He says:

class of our notes, when demanded by  
the holders, would instantly destroy

both immeasurably greater to-day  
than they were when Mr. Hamilton  
uttered these weighty words.  
&quot; &#x27;On the whole,&#x27; says Mr. Hamil­  
ton, &#x27;it seems most advisable not to  
attach tbe unit exclusively to either  
of the metals, because this cannot  
be done effectually without des­  
troying the office and character of  
one of them as money, and reduc­  
ing to the situation of mere mer­  
chandise.&#x27;  
  
Mr. Hamilton wisely concludes  
that this reduction of either of the  
metals to mere merchandise (I again  
quote his exact words) &#x27;would pro­  
bably be a greater evil than oc­  
casional variations in the unit from  
the fluctuations in the relative  
value of the metals, especially if  
care be taken to regulate the pro­  
portion between them, with an eye  
to their average commercial value.

sible the commercial ratio of the two met­  
als, though even then it was hard to as­  
certain the exact ratio and still harder to  
make the monetary ratio conform to it.  
In 1717 Sir Isaac Newton reported to the  
British government that &quot;by the course of  
trade and exchange between nation and  
nation In all Europe fine gold Is to fine  
silver as 11 4-3 or 15 to 1.&quot; In 17?2 Ham­  
ilton, In his report on the subject, said:  
&quot;However accurate and decisive this au­  
thority may be deemed in relation to the  
period to which it applies, it cannot be  
taken at the distance of more than seventy  
years as a ratio for determining the exist­  
ing proportion.&quot; Those who tnlnl that  
the ratio in coinage of gold and silver Is  
a fixed quantity, cr can be determined by  
one generation for another, should ponder  
these words jf Hamilton. It was natural  
that the United States should adopt the  
idea, then prevalent In the commercial  
world, of a double standard, and also that  
it should adopt the commercial ratio of  
gold and silver as the legal ratio. It di

spired by no selfish purpose, and was im­  
nressed with the necessity of providing for  
the use of both metals. He thought that  
If either metal was to be preferred as a  
standard, &#x27;it ought to be gold rather tnan  
silver.&#x27; The inducement to such a prefer­  
ence is, said he, &#x27;to reuder the unit as  
little variable as possible, because on tnis  
depends the steady value of all contracts,  
and. in a certain sense, of all other prop­  
erty. And It is truly observed that If the  
unit belong indiscriminately to both met­  
als, it is subject to all the fluctuations  
that happen in the relative vaiue wnicn  
they bear to each other. He believed that  
the commercial ratio should be the mint­  
ing ratio; that is to say, that the money  
value of Kold and sliver should be respect­  
ively their market value. &quot;There can hard­  
Iv be a better rule in any country,&#x27; said he,

From a Great Democrat.   
A depreciation of the currency is al­  
ways attended by a loss to the labor­  
ing classes. This portion of the com­  
munity have neither time nor oppor­  
tunity co watch the ebbs and flows of  
the money market. Engaged from day  
to day in their useful toils, they do no*  
perceive that, although their wages are  
nominally the same, or even somewhat  
higher, they are greatly reduced, in  
fact, by the rapid increase of currency,  
which, as it appears to make money  
abound, they are at first inclined to  
consider a blessing.—Andrew Jackson,  
Eighth Annual Message.   
As long as gold, either from its in­  
trinsic superiority as a metal, from its  
rarity or from the prejudices of man­  
kind, retains so considerable a pre­  
eminence in value over silver as it  
has hitherto had, a natural consequence  
of this seems to be that its condition  
will be more stationary. The revolu­  
tions, therefore, which may take place  
in the comparative value of gold and  
silver will be changes in the state of  
the latter rather than in that of the  
former.—Alexander Hamilton.

and all the subsequent experience of  
ninety years has brought oat no  
clearer statement of the ease, or de­  
veloped a more complete comprehen­  
sion of this subtle and difficult subject.  
“On the whole,&quot; says Mr. Hamilton,  
“it seems most advisable not to attach  
the unit exclusively to either of the  
metals, because this cannot be done  
effectually without destroying the  
office and character of one of them as  
money, and reducing it to the situa­  
tion of mere merchandise.” Mr. Ham­  
ilton wisely concludes that this reduc­  
tion of either of the metals to mere  
merchandise (I again quote his exset  
words), “wonld probably be a greater  
evil than occasional variations in the  
unit from the fluctuations in the rela­  
tive value of the metals, especially if  
care be taken to regulate the propor­  
tion between them, with an eye to  
their average commercial value”

port to be the conclusions of Alexander  
Hamilton&#x27;s report to Congress on coinage.  
One of these conclusions, as given by this  
Munchausen, is as follows:  
Fifth That the market value is a proper  
rule for the proportion, provided the mar­  
ket value be fixed by a free and steady use  
of both metals as money.  
For the words, &quot;provided the market  
value be fixed by a free and steady use of  
both metals as money.&quot; there is nothing in  
the mint report of Hamilton to warrant.  
What Hamilton said on this point was;  
There can hardly be any better rule Sn  
any country, for the legal, than the market  
proportion, if this can be supposed to have  
been ptoduced by the free and steady  
cours; of commercial principles. The pre­  
snmption in such case is that each metal  
finds its true level, according to its in­  
trinsic utility, in the general system of  
money operations.  
Hamilton&#x27;s mint report is an argument  
for bimetallism on the commercial ratio.  
He distinctly declares that &quot;one conse­  
quence of overvaluing either metal in re­  
spect to the other is the banishment of that  
Which is undervalued.&quot; That is, if. one  
ounce of gold is worth in the world&#x27;s mar­  
ket thirty ounces of silver, if the ratio for  
free coinage, is made sixteen ounces of sil­  
ver to one of gold by our Nation, gold will  
be banished as money. Mexico&#x27;s experience  
proves that Hamilton was right

But the quantity of gold and silver in

given sum cannot be made less than  
heretofore without disturbing the bal­  
ance of intrinsic value and making ev­  
ery aero of land as well as every bushel

*« But, upon the whole, it seems to be the most advisable, as has been observed,  
not to attach the unit exclusively to either of the metals, because this cannot be  
done effectively without destroying the office and character of one of them as  
money, and reducing it to the situation of a mere merchandise, which, accordingly,  
has been proposed from different and very respectable quarters, but which prob-  
ably would be a greater evil than occasional variations from the unit from the  
fluctuations in the relative value of the metals, especially if care be taken to  
regulate the proportion between them with an eye to their average commercial  
value. To annul the use of either of the metals as money is to abridge the quan-  
tity of circulating medium, and is liable to all the objections which arise from a  
comparison of the benefits of a full with the evils of a scanty circulation. It is  
not a satisfactory answer to say that none but the favoured metal would in this  
case find its way into the country, as in that all balances must be paid. The  
practicability of this would, in some measure, depend on the abundance or scarcity  
of it in the country paying. Where there was little it would either not be procur-  
able at all or it would cost a premium to obtain it, which, in every case of a com-  
petition with others in a branch of trade would constitute a deduction from the  
profits of the party receiving. Perhaps, too, the embarassments which such a  
circumstance might sometimes create in the pecuniary liquidation of balances  
might lead to additional efforts to find a substitute in commodities, and might so  
far impede the introduction of the metals. Neither could the exclusion of either  
of them be deemed in other respects favourable to commerce. J¢ is often in the  
course of trade as desirable to possess the kind of money as the kind of commodities  
best adapted to a foreign market. \t seems, however, most probable that the  
chief, if not the sole effect, of such a regulation would be to diminish the utility  
of one of the metals. It could hardly prove an obstacle to the introduction of that  
which was excluded in the natural course of trade, because it would always com-  
mand a ready sale for the purpose of exportation to foreign markets. Butsuch an  
effect, if the only one, is not to be regarded as a trivial inconvenience.”

Gold may, perhaps, in certain senses be said to have greater stability than  
silver, as, being of superior value, less liberties have been taken with it in the  
regulations of different countries. Its standard has remained more uniform, and  
it has in other respects undergone fewer changes, as, being not so much an article  
of merchandise, owing to the use made of silver in the trade with the East Indies  
and China, it is less liable to be influenced by circumstances of commercial de-  
mand. And if, reasoning by analogy, it could be affirmed that there is a physical  
probability of a greater proportional increase in the quantity of silver than in  
that of gold, it would afford an additional reason for calculating on greater  
steadiness in the value of the latter.  
  
As long as gold, either from its intrinsic superiority as a metal, or from its  
greater rarity, or from the prejudices of mankind, retains so considerable a pre-  
eminence in value over silver, as it has hitherto had, a natural consequence of this  
seems to be that its condition will be more stationary. The revolutions, there-  
fore, which may take place in the comparative value of gold and silver will be  
changes in the state of the latter rather than of the former.  
  
But still, on a review of the whole matter, he concludes:  
  
It seems to be most advisable, as has been observed, not to attach the unit  
exclusively to either of the metals.

In 1792 he wrote to Hamilton, approving his &quot;re­

conclusion was: &quot;That in establishing a ratio be­

may be called the commercial world is the proper one.  
There can hardly be a better rule in any country for  
the legal than the market ratio, if this can be sup­

course of commercial principles. The presumption in  
such case is that each metal finds its true level ac­

As iong as gold, either from its intrinsic superiority as a metal, from its greater  
rarity, or from the prejudices of mankind, retains so considerable a pre-eminence in  
value over silver, as it has hitherto had, a natural consequence of this seems to be  
that its condition will be more stationary. The revolutions, therefore, which may  
take place in the comparative value of gold and silver will be changes in the state  
of the latter rather than in that of the former.  
  
It is sometimes observed that silver ought to be encouraged rather than gold, as  
being more conducive to the extension of bank circulation, from the greater diffi-  
culty and inconvenience which its greater bulk, compared with its value, occasions  
in the transportation of it. But bank circulation is desirable rather as an auailiary  
to, than as a substitute for, that of the precious metals, and ought to be left to its  
natural course. Artificial expedients to extend it, by opposing obstacles to the  
other, are at least not recommended by any very obvious advantages. And, in gen-  
eral, it is the safest rule 1o regulate every particular institution or object, according  
to the principles which, in relation to itself, appear the most sound.
