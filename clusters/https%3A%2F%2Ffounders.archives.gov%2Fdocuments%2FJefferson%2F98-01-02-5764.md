The solemn Declaration and Protest of the Commonwealth of Virginia on the principles of the Constitution of the US. of America &amp; on the violations of them.We the General assembly of Virginia, on behalf, and in the name, of the people thereof do declare as follows.The states in N. America which confederated to establish their independance on the government of Great Britain, of which Virginia was one, became, on that acquisition, free and independant states, and as such authorised to constitute governments, each for itself, in such form as it thought best.They entered into a compact (which is called the Constitution of the US. of America)  by which they agreed to unite in a single government as to their relations with each other, and with foreign nations, and as to certain other articles particularly specified. they retained at the same time, each to itself, the other rights of independant government comprehending mainly their domestic interests.For the administration of their Federal branch they agreed to appoint, in conjunction, a distinct set of  functionaries, legislative, executive and judiciary, in the manner settled in that compact:  while to each severally and of course, remained  it’s original right of appointing, each for itself, a separate set of functionaries, legislative, executive and judiciary also, for administering the Domestic branch of their respective governments.These two sets of officers, each independant of the other, constitute thus a whole of government, for each state separately, the powers ascribed to the one, as specifically made federal, exercisable over the whole, the residuary powers, retained to the other, exercisable exclusively over it’s particular state, foreign herein, each to the others, as they were before their original compact.To this construction of government &amp; distribution of it’s powers, the Commonwealth of Virginia does religiously and affectionately adhere, opposing, with equal fidelity and firmness, the usurpation of either set of functionaries on the rightful powers of the other.But the federal branch has, assumed in some cases, and claimed in others, a right of enlarging it’s own powers by constructions, inferences, and indefinite deductions, from those directly given, which this assembly does declare to be usurpations of the powers retained to the independant branches, mere interpolations into the compact, and direct infractions of it.They claim, for example, and have commenced the exercise of a right to construct roads, open canals, &amp; effect other internal improvements, within the territories and jurisdictions exclusively belonging to the several states, which this assembly does  declare  has not been given to that branch by the constitutional compact, but remain to each state among it’s domestic and unalienated powers, exercisable within itself, and by it’s domestic authorities alone.This  assembly does further disavow, and declare to be most false and unfounded, the doctrine that the compact, in authorising it’s federal branch to lay and collect taxes duties, imposts and excises to pay the debts and provide for the common defence of general welfare of the US. has given them thereby a power to do whatever they may think, or pretend, would promote the general welfare, which construction would make that, of itself, a complete government, without limitation of powers; but that the plain sense and obvious meaning was that they might levy the taxes necessary to provide for the general welfare by the various acts of power therein specified and delegated to them, and by no others.Nor is it admitted, as had been said, that the people of these states, by not investing their federal branch with all the means of bettering their condition, have denied to themselves any  which may effect that purpose; since, in the distribution of these means, they have given to that branch those which belong to it’s department, and to the states have reserved separately the residue which belong to them separately. and thus by the organization of the two branches taken together, have completely secured the first object of human association, the full improvement of their condition, and reserve to themselves all the faculties of multiplying their own blessings.Whilst the General assembly thus declares the rights retained by the states, rights which they have never yielded and which this state will never voluntarily yield, they do not mean to raise the banner of disaffection, or of separation from their sister-states, co-parties with themselves to this compact. they know and value too highly the blessings of their union as to foreign nations and questions arising among themselves, to consider every infraction as to be met by actual resistance; they  respect too affectionately the opinions of those possessing the same rights under the same instrument, to make every difference of construction a ground of immediate rupture. they would indeed consider such a rupture as among the greatest calamities which could befall them; but not the greatest. there is yet one greater, submission to a government of unlimited powers. it is only when the hope of avoiding this shall become absolutely desperate, that further forbearance could not be indulged. should a majority of the co-parties therefore, contrary to the expectation and hope of this assembly, prefer, at this time, acquiescence in these assumptions of power by the federal member of the government, we will be patient and suffer much, under the confidence that time, ere it be too late, will prove to them also the bitter consequences in which this usurpation will involve us all. in the mean while we will breast with them, rather than separate from them, every misfortune save that only of living under a government of unlimited powers. we owe every other sacrifice to ourselves, to our federal brethren, and to the world at large, to pursue with temper and perseverance the great experiment which shall prove that man is capable of living in society, governing itself by laws self-imposed, and securing to it’s members the enjoyment of life, liberty, property and peace; and further to shew that even when the government of it’s choice shall shew a tendency to degeneracy, we are not at once to despair but that the will &amp; the watchfulness of it’s sounder parts will reform it’s aberrations, recall it to original and legitimate principles, and restrain it within the rightful limits of self-government. and these are the objects of this Declaration and Protest. Supposing  therin that it might be for the good of the whole, as some of it’s Co-states seem to think, that  the power of making roads and canals should be added to those directly given to the federal branch, as more likely to be systematically and beneficially directed, than by the independant action of the several states, this Commonwealth,  from respect to these opinions, and a desire of conciliation with it’s Co-states, will consent, in concurrence with them, to make this addition, provided it be done regularly by an amendment of the compact, in the way established by that instrument, and provided also it be sufficiently guarded against abuses, compromises, and corrupt practices, not only of possible, but of probable occurrence.And As a further pledge  of  the sincere and cordial attachment of this commonwealth to the Union of the whole so far as has been consented to by the compact called ‘the Constitution of the US. of America,’ (construed according to the  plain and ordinary meaning of it’s language, to the common intendment of the time, and of those who framed it) to give also to all parties and authorities time for reflection, and for consideration whether, under a temperate view of the possible consequences,  and especially of the constant obstructions which an equivocal majority must ever expect to meet, they will still prefer the assumption of this power rather than it’s acceptance from the free will of their constituents, and to preserve peace in the mean while, we proceed to make it the duty of  our citizens, until the legislature shall otherwise &amp; ultimately, decide, to acquiesce under those acts of the federal branch of our government which we have declared to be usurpations, and against which, in point of right, we do protest as null and void, and never to be quoted as precedents of right.We therefore do enact, and be tt enacted by the General assembly of Virginia that all citizens of this commonwealth, and persons and authorities within the same, shall pay full obedience at all times to the Acts which may be past by the Congress of the US. the object of which shall be the construction of post roads, making canals of navigation, and maintaining the same, in any part of the US. in like manner as if the  said acts were, totidem verbis past by the legislature of this commonwealth.

ealth of Virginia, on the principles of the Con  
stituiion of the United States of America, and or  
the violation of them.  
*We, the Geneal r Assembly of Virginia, or  
behalf, and in the name of the people thereof  
do declare as follows:  
i The States in North Amet ica which confed’  
erated to establish their independence on th&lt;  
government of Great Uiitain, of which Virgin  
ia was one, became, on that acquisition, free an*,  
independent* Sta&#x27;es, and as such, authorised tr  
constitute governments, each for itself, in sucl  
form as it thought best.  
They entered intoa compact,(which is caller  
the constitution of the United States of Amer  
ica,) by which they agreed to unite in a singlt  
government as to their relations with each o­  
ther, and with foreign nations, and as to cert air  
other articles particularly specified l hey re­  
tained at the same time, each to nsttlf, the oth­  
er tights of independent government, comprc  
hending mainly their domestic imeres&#x27;s.  
For the administration of their federal brancli  
they agteed to appoin’, in conjunction, a diS&#x27;  
tinct set of functionaries, legislative, executive  
and judiciary,in she manner settled in ilnvt corn  
pact: while to each, severally and of cours , re­  
mained its original righ* of appointing, each for  
itself, a separate set of functionaries, Icgidutive  
executive and juc!i&lt; iarv, also, for administering  
the domes ic hiancliof their respective govern­  
ments.  
Tl.cse two sets of officers, each independent  
of the oiht r, constitute thus a ichole oT govern­  
ment, for each State separably; the powers as­  
cribed to tne one, as specially made federal,ex­  
ercised over the whole, me residuary powers  
retained to the othet exercisable exclu-.iv«Iy  
over its particula; S ate, foieign her*in, each  
to the others, as they were before the original  
  
l o this construction nT government and dts­  
u ibu ion of i s powers, &#x27;he Commonwealth ol  
Virginia does religiously and affectiona&#x27;elv ad­  
here, opposing, with equal fidcli&#x27;V and firmness  
ihe usur ation of either set of functionaries on  
the rightful powers of the other.  
But the federal branch ha* assumed in some  
cases, andclaimed in others, a right of enlarg­  
ing its own powers by constructions, inferences  
and indefinite deductions from those dirtctly  
given, which this Assembly does declare to be  
usurpations of the powers retained to the indc  
pendent branches, mere interpolation* into the  
compact, and dire&#x27; i infractions of it.  
They claim, for example, and have commen  
erd the exercise of a right to construct roads,  
open canal*, and tff ct o&#x27;her internal improve­  
ments within the territories and jurisdictions  
exclusively belonging to the several Slates,  
which this assembly does declare has not been  
given to that branch by the constitutional com  
pact, but remains to each State among its do­  
mestic and unalienated powers, exercisable  
within itself and by its domestic authorities  
alone. _——  
cjccllare to Be most false and unfounded, the d &gt;e­  
trine that the compact, in authorising its fede­  
ral branch to lay and collect taxes, duties, im­  
posts a»d excises to pay the debts and provide  
for the common defence and general welfare of  
the United Slates, has given them thereby a  
pewer to do whatevever they may think, or pre­  
tend, would promote the general welfare, which  
consti uction would make that, of itself, a com­  
ple’e government, without limitaiion of pow­  
ers; but that the plain sense and obvious mean­  
ing was, that they might levy taxes necessaiy  
to provide for the general welfare, by the vari­  
ous acts of power therem specified and delega­  
ted to them, and by no others  
Nor is it admitted, as has been soid, that the  
people of these Sta&#x27;es, by not investing &#x27;heir  
federal branch with all the means of bettering  
tlit-ir condi&#x27;ion, hav* denied to themselves any  
which may effect that purpose; since in tlie dis­  
tribution of ihcse means, they have given to  
that branch those which btlong lo its depait­  
ineuts and to the S ates have reserved, separate  
I i Un t..i» i/lno K ir B hoLvttrvc In t It nm *u r%a *• *11 m _  
  
&#x27;/». . .— ..­  
ly. And thus by the oigjnizauon of thr two  
tranches ;aken together, hav* completely secu •  
ied the Gist object of human association, &#x27;he  
ruli improvement of their condition, and reser­  
ved to uiemselves all the faculties of n&gt;ul iply­  
mg their own blessings.  
Whilst the General* Assembly thus declares  
he rights retained by the St ile, rights which  
bey have never yielded, and which this Slate  
will never voluntarily yirld, they do not mean  
o raise the banner of disaffection, or of separa­  
ion froi?» iheit sister States, co-patties with  
hemselves in this compact. They know and  
value too highly the blessings of their Union  
is to foreign nations and questions arising  
imong themselves, to consider every infraction  
is &#x27;o be met by ac’ual resistance. They res­  
irct too affectionately the opinions of those  
lossessing toe same tights under the same in­  
itrument, to make every diffrtence of con­  
struction a ground of tmnudia&#x27;e rupture —  
i’hey would indeed, consider such a rup&#x27;ure as  
imong the great-st calamities which could be­  
all them; but not he greatest. There is yet  
&gt;ne greater, submission to a government of un­  
itnited powers. It is only when the hope of  
tvoiding this shall become absolutely desperate,  
hat further forbearance could not be indulged,  
should the majorities of th«-co-parties therr­  
ore, contrary to the expectation and hope of  
his assembly, prefer, a- this time, acquiescence  
n these assumptions of power by the federal  
nemher of the government, we will be patient  
md suffer much under confidence that time, ere  
t be too late, will prove to them also &lt;he bitter  
:onsquences in which that usutpaticn will in­  
volve us ail. In the mean while we will breast  
with them rather than separate from them, ev«  
ry misfortune save that only of living under a  
fovernment of unlimited powers. We owe  
vtry other sacrifice to ourselves, to our federal  
irethren and to the world at large, to pursue  
vitb temper and pentevetance the great ex|»er­  
roent which shall prove that man is capable of  
iving in society governing itself bv laws self  
m&#x27;osed, and securing to its members the en­  
oyraent of life, liberty, property and peace;  
  
11 and further to shew that&#x27;cven when the govern  
I mem of its choice shall show a tendency to de  
,■ gcneracy, we are not at once to despair bit  
. that the will and the watchfulness of its sound  
er parts will reform its aberrations, recall it t(  
original and legitimate principles, and restrait  
it within the rightful limits of self-goverment  
■ And these are the objects of this Declarator  
and Protest.  
i Supposing then, that it might be for th(  
good of the whole as some of its co-States seen  
, to think, that the power of making roads and  
canals should be added to those directly giver  
’ to the federal branch, as more likely to he sys­  
tematically and bcneficiaally directed, than bj  
, the independent action of the several States  
this commonwealth, from respect to these opin  
ions, and a desire oT conciliation with i1 s co­  
, States, will consent in concurrence with them  
to make this addition, provided it be done reg­  
ularly by an amendment of the compact, in the  
way established b&gt; that instrument, and pro­  
vided also, it be sufficiently guarded agains  
abuses, compromises and corrupt practices  
not only of possible hut of probable occurrence  
Ami as a further pledge of the sincere and  
cordial attachment of this c .mmonwealth tc  
the nation of the whole, so far as has been con­  
sented to by the compact called ‘ 1 lie Consti­  
tution of the United States of America,’(con­  
strued arctmling to the plain and ordinal]  
meaning of its language, to the common in  
trndment of the time, anti of those who framed  
it,) to give also to all part&#x27;es and authorities  
time lot’ reflection and considiration whether  
under a temperate view of tht poss&#x27;ble conse  
queners, and especially of llte constant obstruc  
tions which an equivo&#x27; al majority must evei  
expect to meet, they will still prefer the as­  
sumption of this power rather than its accept­  
ance front (lie free will of their constilu1 nts  
and to preserve peace in the meanwhile, wt  
proceed to make it the duty of our citiz&#x27; rt-&lt;  
until the legislature shall otherwise anti ulii­  
ma&#x27;ely decide, 10 acquiesce under those acts ol  
the fcdcial branch of our government which  
we have declared to he usurpations, and againsi  
which, in point of right, we do protest a» null  
and void and never to be quoted as precedents  
of right.  
  
\ve therefore do enact, and do i: enacica oy  
the General Assembly ofVirginia that all cit­  
izons of this Common&quot; eulth and persons and  
authorities within the same, shall pav full obe­  
dience at all times to the arts which maybe

the blessmgs of their anion as to foreign nations and  
questions arising among themselves, to consider every  
infraction as to be met by actual resistance. Thev re-  
spect tom affcetionately the opinions of those possessing  
the same rights under the same instrument, to make  
every difference of construction a ground of immediate  
rupture. —They would indeed, consider such a rupture as  
among the greatest calamities which could befall them;  
but not the greatest. There is yet one greater, sub-  
mission to a government of unlimited powers. It is  
only when the hope of avoiding this shail become abso-

indulged. Should the majorities of the co-parties there-  
fore, contrary to the expectation and hope of this as-  
sembly, prefer, at this time, acquiescence in these as-  
sumptions of power by the federal member of the go-  
vernment, he will be patient and suffer much under con-  
fidence that time, ere it be too late, will prove to them  
also the bitter consequences in which that usurpation will  
involve usall. In the mean while we will breast with  
them rather than separate from them, every misfor-  
tune, save that only of living under a government of un-  
limited powers. We owe every other sacrifice to  
ourselves, to our federal brethren and to the world at  
large, to pursue with temper and perseverance the  
great experiment which shall prove that man is capa-  
ble of living in society, governing itself by laws self im-  
posed, and securing to its members the enjoyment of  
life, liberty, property and peace; and further to shew  
  
  
  
Jae even when the government of its choice shall show  
  
a tendency to degeneracy, we are not at once to despair,

“ They entered into a compact ( which  
is called the Constitution of the United

agreed to unite in a single govern-

other, and with foreign natiuns, and  
as to certain other articles particularly  
specified. They retained, at the same  
time, each to itself, the other rights of  
independent governments, compre-  
hending, mainly, their domestic inter-  
ests.  
  
“For the administration of their

and judiciary, in the manner settled  
in that compact, while to each, seve

ginal right of appointing each for it-  
self, a separate set of functionaries,  
legislative, executive, and judiciary,  
also for administering the domestic  
branch of their respective govern-  
ments.  
  
“These two sets of officers, each in-  
dependent of the other, constitutes  
thus a whole of government for each  
State separately ; the powers ascribed  
to the one as specifically made fede-  
ral, exercised over the whole ; the re-  
siduary power retained to the other,  
exercisable exclusively over its parti-

the other, as they were before the ori-

the Commonwealth of Virginia does  
religiously and affectionately adhere,  
opposing with equal fidelity and firm-  
ness the usurpation of either set of  
functionaries on the rightful powers of  
the other.  
  
“ But the federal branch has assum-

ers, a right of enlarging its own pow-  
ers by constructions, inferences, and  
- indefinite deductions from those direct-  
ly given, which this Assembly does  
declare to be ususpations of the pow-  
ers retained to the independent branch-

commenced the exercise of a right to  
construct roads, open canals, and effect
