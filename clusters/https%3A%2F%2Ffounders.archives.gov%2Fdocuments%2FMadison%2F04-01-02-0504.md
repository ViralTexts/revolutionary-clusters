Montpellier Novr. 27. 1819  
Your letter of the 11th was duly recd, and I should have given it a less tardy answer, but for a succession of particular demands on my attention, and a wish to assist my recollections, by consulting both Manuscript &amp; printed sources of information on the Subjects of your enquiry. Of these, however, I have not been able to avail myself, but very partially.  
As to the intention of the framers of the Constitution in the clause relating to “the Migration and importation of persons &amp;c” the best key may perhaps be found in the case which produced it. The African trade in Slaves had long been odious to most of the States, and the importation of Slaves into them had been prohibited. Particular States, however continued the impor[ta]tion, and were extremely averse to any restriction on their power to do so. In the Convention the former States were anxious, in framing a new constitution, to insert a provision for an immediate and absolute stop to the trade. The latter were not only averse to any interference on the subject; but solemnly declared that their constituents would never accede to a Constitution containing such an article. Out of this conflict grew the middle measure providing that Congress should not interfere until the year 1808; with an implication, that after that date, they might prohibit the importation of Slaves into the States then existing, &amp; previous thereto, into the states not then existing. Such was the tone of opposition in the States of S. Carolina &amp; Georgia, &amp; such the desire to gain their acquiescence in a prohibitory power, that on a question between the epochs of 1800 &amp; 1808, the States of N. Hampshire, Massatts. &amp; Connecticut, (all the eastern States in the Convention) joined in the vote for the latter, influenced however by the collateral motive of reconciling those particular States to the power over commerce &amp; navigation; against which they felt, as did some other States, a very strong repugnance. The earnestness of S. Carolina &amp; Georgia was further manifested by their insisting on the Security in the V. article, against any amendment to the Constitution affecting the right reserved to them, &amp; their uniting with the small states who insisted on a like security for their equality in the Senate.  
But some of the States were not only anxious for a constitutional provision against the introduction of Slaves. They had scruples against admitting the term “Slaves” into the Instrument. Hence the descriptive phrase “migration or importation of persons”; the term migration allowing those who were scrupulous of acknowledging expressly a property in human beings, to view imported persons as a species of emigrants, whilst others might apply the term to foreign malefactors sent or coming into the Country. It is possible tho’ not recollected, that some might have had an eye to the case of freed blacks, as well as malefactors.  
But whatever may have been intended by the term “migration” or the term “persons,” it is most certain, that they referred, exclusively, to a migration or importation from other countries into the U. States; and not to a removal, voluntary or involuntary, of Slaves or freemen, from one to another part of the U. States. Nothing appears or is recollected that warrants this latter intention. Nothing in the proceedings of the State conventions indicates such a construction there. Had such been the construction it is easy to imagine the figure it would have made in many of the states, among the objections to the constitution, and among the numerous amendments to it proposed by the state conventions, not one of which amendments refers to the clause in question. Neither is there any indication that Congress have heretofore considered themselves as deriving from this Clause a power over the migration or removal of individuals, whether freemen or slaves, from one State to another, whether new or old: For it must be Kept in view that if the power was given at all, it has been in force eleven years over all the States existing in 1808, and at all times over the States not then existing. Every indication is against such a construction by Congress of their constitutional powers. Their alacrity in exercising their powers relating to slaves, is a proof that they did not claim what they did not exercise. They punctually and unanimously put in force the power accruing in 1808 against the further importation of Slaves from abroad. They had previously directed their power over American vessels on the high Seas, against the African trade. They lost no time in applying the prohibitory power to Louisiana, which having maritime ports, might be an inlet for slaves from abroad. But they forbore to extend the prohibition to the introduction of slaves from other parts of the Union. They had even prohibited the importation of slaves into the Mississippi Territory from without the limits of the U. S, in the year 1798, without extending the prohibition to the introduction of slaves from within those limits; altho, at the time, the ports of Georgia and S. Carolina were open for the importation of Slaves from abroad, and encreasing the mass of slavery within the U. States.  
If these views of the subject be just, a power in Congress to controul the interior migration or removals of persons, must be derived from some other source than Sect 9, Art. I, either from the clause giving power “to make all needful rules and regulations respecting the Territory or other property belonging to the U. S.; or from that providing for the admission of New States into the Union.”  
The terms in which the 1st of these powers is expressed, tho’ of a ductile character, cannot well be extended beyond a power over the Territory as property, &amp; a power to make the provisions really needful or necessary for the Govt of Settlers until ripe for admission as States into the Union. It may be inferred that Congress did not regard the interdict of slavery among the needful regulations contemplated by the constitution; since in none of the Territorial Governments created by them, is such an interdict found. The power, however be its import what it may, is obviously limited to a Territory whilst remaining in that character as distinct from that of a State.  
As to the power of admitting new States into the federal compact, the questions offering themselves are; whether congress can attach conditions, or the new State concur in conditions, which after admission, would abridge or enlarge the constitutional rights of legislation, common to the other State[s]; whether Congress can by a compact with a new Member take power, either to or from itself, or place the new member above or below the equal rank &amp; rights possessed by the others: whether all such stipulations, expressed or implied would not be nullities, and so pronounced when brought to a practical test. It falls within the Scope of your inquiry, to state the fact, that there was a proposition in the convention to discriminate between the old and new States, by an Article in the Constitution declaring that the aggregate number of representatives from the States thereafter to be admitted, should never exceed that of the States originally adopting the Constitution. The proposition happily was rejected. The effect of such a descrimination, is sufficiently evident.  
In the case of Louisiana, there is a circumstance which may deserve notice. In the Treaty ceding it, a privilege was retained by the ceding party, which distinguishes between its ports &amp; others of the U. S. for a special purpose, &amp; a Short period. This privilege however was the result not of an ordinary legislative power in Congress; nor was it the result of an arrangement between Congress &amp; the people of Lou[i]siana. It rests on the ground that the same entire power, even in the nation, over that territory as over the original territory of the U. S never existed; the privelege alluded to being in the deed of cession carved by the foreign owner, out of the title conveyed to the purchaser. A sort of necessity therefore was thought to belong to so peculiar &amp; extraordinary a case. Notwithstanding this plea it is presumable that if the privelege had materially affected the rights of other ports, or had been of a permanent or durable character, the occurence would not have been so little regarded. Congress would not be allowed to effect through the medium of a Treaty, obnoxious discriminations between new and old States, more than among the latter.  
With respect to what has taken place in the N. W. Territory, it may be observed, that the ordinance giving its distinctive character on the Subject of Slave holding, proceeded from the old Congress, acting, with the best intentions, but under a charter which contains no Shadow of the authority exercised. And it remains to be decided how far the States formed within that Territory &amp; admitted into the Union, are on a different footing from its other members, as to their legislative sovereignty.  
For the grounds on which ⅗ of the Slaves were admitted into the ratio of representation, I will with your permission, Save trouble by referring to No 54 of the Federalist. In addition, it may be Stated that this feature in the Consti[tu]tion was combined with that relating to the power over Commerce &amp; navigation. In truth these two powers, with those relating to the importation of Slaves, &amp; the Articles establishing the equality of representation in the Senate, &amp; the rule of taxation, had a complicated influence on each other which alone would have justified the remark, that the Constitution was “the result of mutual deference &amp; Concession.”  
It was evident that the large States holding slaves, and those not large which felt themselves so by anticipation, would not have concurred in a Constitution, allowing them no more representation in one Legislative Branch than the smallest States, and in the other less than their proportional contributions to the Common Treasury.  
The considerations which led to this mixed ratio, which had been very deliberately agreed on in Apl. 1783. by the old Congress, make it probable that the Convention could not have looked to a departure from it, in any instance where slaves made a part of the local population.  
Whether the Convention could have looked to the existence of slavery at all in the new States is a point on which I can add little to what has been already stated. The great object of the Convention seemed to be to prohibit the increase, by the importation, of slaves. A power to emancipate slaves was disclaimed: Nor is any thing recollected that denoted a view to controul the distribution of those within the Country. The case of the N. Western Territory was probably superseded by the provision agst. the importation of slaves by S. Carolina &amp; Georgia, which had not then passed laws prohibiting it. When the existence of slavery in that territory was precluded, the importation of slaves was rapidly going on, and the only mode of checking it was by narrowing the space open to them. It is not an unfair inference that the expedient would not have been undertaken, if the power afterwards given to terminate the importation every where, had existed or been even anticipated. It has appeared that the present Congress never followed the example during the twenty years preceding the prohibitory epoch.  
The expediency of exercising a supposed power in Congress, to prevent a diffusion of the slaves actually in the Country, as far as the local authorities may admit them, resolves itself into the probable effects of such a diffusion on the interests of the slaves and of the Nation.  
Will it or will it not better the condition of the slaves, by lessening the number belonging to individual Masters, and intermixing both with greater Masses of free people? Will partial manumissions be more or less likely to take place, and a general emancipation be accelerated or retarded? Will the moral &amp; physical condition of slaves, in the mean time, be improved or deteriorated? What do experience and appearances decide as to the comparative rates of generative increase, in their present, and, in a dispersed, situation?  
Will the aggregate strength security tranquility and harmony of the whole nation be advanced or impaired by lessening the proportion of slaves to the free people in particular sections of it?  
How far an occlusion of the space now vacant, agst. the introduction of slaves may be essential to prevent compleatly a smuggled importation of them from abroad, ought to influence the question of expediency, must be decided by a reasonable estimate of the degree in which the importation would take place in spight [sic] of the spirit of the times, the increasing co-operation of foreign powers agst. the slave trade, the increasing rigor of the Acts of Congress, and the vigilant enforcement of them by the Executive; and by a fair comparison of this estimate with the considerations opposed to such an occlusion.  
Will a multiplication of States holding slaves, multiply advocates of the importation of foreign slaves, so as to endanger the continuance of the prohibitory Acts of Congress? To such an apprehension seem to be opposed the facts, that the States holding fewest slaves are those which most readily abolished slavery altogether; that of the 13 primitive States Eleven had prohibited the importation before the power was given to Congs.: that all of them with the newly added States, unanimously concurred in exerting that power: that most of the present slaveholding States can not be tempted by motives of interest to favor the re-opening of the ports to foreign slaves; and that these, with the States which have even abolished Slavery within themselves, could never be outnumbered in the National Councils by new States wishing for slaves, and not Satisfied with the supply attainable within the U. S.  
On the whole, the Missouri question, as a constitutional one, amounts to the question, whether the condition proposed to be annexed to the admission of Missouri would or would not be void in itself, or become void the moment the territory should enter as a State within the pale of the Constitution: And as a question of expediency &amp; humanity, it depends essentially on the probable influence of such restrictions on the quantity &amp; duration of slavery, and on the general condition of slaves in the U. S.  
The question raised with regard to the tenor of the stipulation in the Louisiana Treaty, on the subject of its admission, is one which I have not examined, and on which I could probably throw no light if I had.  
Under one aspect of the general subject, I can not avoid saying, that apart from its merits under others, the tendency of what has passed and is passing, fills me with no slight anxiety. Parties under some denominations or other must always be expected in a Govt. as free as ours. When the individuals belonging to them are intermingled in every part of the whole Country, they strengthen the union of the Whole, while they divide every part. Should a State of parties arise, founded on geographical boundaries and other physical &amp; permanent distinctions which happen to coincide with them, what is to controul those great repulsive Masses from awful shocks agst. each other?  
The delay in answering your letter made me fear you might doubt my readiness to comply with its requests. I now fear you will think I have done more than these justified. I have been the less reserved because you are so ready to conform to my inclination formerly expressed, not to be drawn from my sequestered position into public view.  
Since I thanked you for the copy o

MonreElIEr, November 27, 1819.  
Deas Sia: Your lett er of the 11th was duly received,  
  
and I should have given it a less tardy answer but for a  
succession of particular demands on my attention and a  
wish to assist my recollections by consulting both manu  
script and printed sources of information on the subjects  
of your inquiry. Of these, hewever, I have not been  
able to avall myself but very partially.  
As to the intention of the framers of the Constitution  
in the clause relating to the &quot;migration and importation of  
persons,&quot; &amp;c., the best ker may perhaps be found in the  
case which produced it. The African trade in slaves had  
long been odious to most of the States, and the importa­  
tion into them had been prohibited. Particular States,  
however, continued the mportation, and were extremely  
averse to any restricton on their power to do so. In the  
Convention the former States were anxious, in framing a  
new Constitution to insert a provision for an immediate  
and absolute sto to the trade. The latter were not only  
averse to any nterference on the subject, but solemnly det  
clared that deir constituents would never accede to a Con­  
stitution ontaining such an article. Out of this conflict  
grew the middle measure, providing that Congress should  
not bterfere until the year 1808; with an implication that  
aer that date they might prohibit the importation of  
slaves into the States then existing, and previous thereto  
into the States not then existing. Such was the tone of  
opposition in the States of South Carolina and Georgia,  
and such the desire to gain their acquiescence in a prohi­  
bitory power, that on a question between the epochs of  
1800 and 1808, the States of New Hampshire, Massachu­  
setts and Connecticut (all the Eastern States in Conven­  
tion) joined in the vote for the latter--influenced, howev­  
er, by the collateral motive of reconciling those particular  
States to the power over commerce and navigation, against  
which they felt, as did some other States, a very strong  
repugnance. The earnestness of South Carolina and  
Georgia was further manifested by their insisting on the  
security in the fitth article against any amendment to the  
Constitution affecting the right reserved to them, and  
their uniting with the small States, who insisted on a like  
security for their equality in the Senate.  
But some of the States were not only anxious for con­  
stitutional provision against the introduction of slaves;  
they had scruples against admitting the term &quot;slaves&quot; in­  
to the instrument. Hence the descriptive phrase, &quot;mi­  
gration or importation of persons;&quot; the term migration  
allowing those who were scrupulous of acknowledging  
expressly a property in human beings to view imported  
persons as a species of emigrants, while others might ap­  
ply the term to foreign malefactors sent or coming into  
the country. It is possible, though not recollected, that  
some might have had an eye to the case of freed blacks  
as well as malefactors.  
But, whatever may have been intended by the term  
&quot;migration&quot; or the term &quot;persons,&quot; it is most certain that  
they reterred exclusively to migration or importation from  
other countries into the United States, and not to a removal,  
voluntary or involuntary, of slaves or freemen from one  
to another part of the United States. Nothing appears  
or is recollected that warrants this latter intention.  
Nothing in the proceedings of the State Conventions indi­  
cates such a construction there. Had such been the con­  
struction it is easy to imagine the figure it would have made  
in many of the States among the objections to the Consti­  
tution and among the numerous amendments to it proposed  
by the State Conventions, not one of which amendments  
refers to the clause in question. Neither is there any  
indication that Congress have heretofore considered  
themselves as deriving from this clause a power over the  
migration or removal of individuals, whether freemen or  
slaves, from one State to another, whether new or old; for  
it must be kept in view that if the power was given at all  
it has been in force eleven years over all the States exis-.  
ting in 1808, and at all times over the States not then ex­  
isting. Every indication is against such construction by  
Congress of their constitutional powers. Their alacrity in  
exercising their powers relating to slaves is a proof that  
they did not claim what they did not exercise. They pune­  
tually and unanimously exercised the power accruing in  
18os agaiust the further importation of slaves from abroad.  
  
le had prstiously directed thcir power over American  
vessels on the high seas against the African trade. They  
lost no time in applying the prohibitory power to Lousi­  
ana, which, naving maritime ports might be an inlet for  
slaves from abroad. But they forbore to extend the pro­  
hibition to the introduction of slaves from other parts of  
the Union. They had even prohibited the importation of  
slaves into the Mississippi Territory from without the  
limits of the United States in the year 1798, without ex­  
tending the prohibition to the introduction of slaves from  
within those limits; although at the time the ports of  
Georgia and South Curolina were open for the importation  
of slaves from abroad and increasing the mass of slavery  
withins the United States.  
If these views of the subject be just, a power in Con­  
gress to control the interior migration or removal of per­  
sons must be derived from some other source than section  
9, article 1; either from the clause giving power &quot;to make  
all needtul rules and regulations respecting the territory or  
other property belonging to the United States,&quot; or from  
that providing for the admission of new States into the  
Union.  
The terms in which the first of these powers is expres­  
sed, though of a ductile character, cannot well be exten­  
ded beyond a power over the territory as property, and a  
power to make the provisions really needful or necessary  
for the Government of settlers until ripe for admission as  
States into the Union. It may be inferred that Con­  
grees did not regard the interdict of slavery among the  
needful regulations contemplated by the Constitution, since  
in none of the Territorial Governments created by them is  
such an interdict found. The power, however, be its im­  
port what it may, is obviously limited to a Territory  
while remaining in that character, as distinct from that  
of a State.  
As to the power of admitting new States into the Fed­  
eral compact, the questions offering themselves are:  
Whether Congress can attach conditions or the new State  
concur to oqudttt.w, areer aummesion, woud abridge  
or enfarge the Constitutional rights of legislation common  
to other States; whether Congress can, by a compact with  
a new member, take power either to or from itself, or  
place the new member above or below the equal rank and  
rights possessed by the others; whether all such stipula­  
tions, expressed or implied, would not be nullities, and so  
pronounced when brought to a practical tost? It falls  
within the scope of your inquiry to state the fact that  
there was a proposition in the Convention to discriminate  
between the old and the new States, by an article in the  
Constitution declaring that the aggregate number of Repe  
resentatives from the States thereatter to be admitted  
should never exceed that of States originally adopting the  
Constitution. The proposition, happily, was rejected.  
The effect of such a discrimination is sufficiently evi­  
dent.  
With respect to what has taken place in the Northwest  
Territory, it may be observed that the ordinance givin its  
distinctive character on the subject of slaveholding pro­  
ceeded from the Old Congress, acting with the best inten­  
tions, but under a charter which contains no shadow of the  
authority exercised; and it remains to be decided how far  
the States formed within that Territory and admitted into  
the Union are on a different footing from its other mem­  
bers as to their legislative sovereignty.  
Whother the Convention could have looked to the exis  
tence of slavery at all in the new States is a point on  
which I can add little to what has been already stated.  
The great object of the Convention seemed to be to pro­  
hibit the increase by the importation of slaves. A power  
to emancipate slaves was disclaimed; nor is any thing re  
collected that denoted a view to control the distribution of  
those within the country. The case of the Northwestern  
Territory was probably superseded by the provision a­  
gainst the importation of slaves by South Carolina  
and Georgia, which had not then passed laws proe  
hibiting it. When the existence of slavery in that Terr­  
tory was precluded, the importation of slaves was rapidly  
going on, and the only mode of checking it was by nar­  
rowing the space open to them. It is not an unfair infe­  
rence that the expedient would not have been undertaken  
  
e oe ee e e ate te inporta  
tion everywhere had existed or been even anticipated. It  
has appeared that the present Congress never followed the  
example during the twenty years preceding the prohibito­  
ry epoch.  
Under one aspect of the general subject I cannot avoid  
saying that, apart from its merits under others, the ten­  
dency of what has passed and is passing fills me with no  
slight anxiety. Parties, under some denomnation or oth­  
er, must always be expected in a Government as free as  
ours. When the individuals belonging to them are inter­  
mingled in every part of the whole country, they strength­  
en the union of the whole while they divide every part.  
Should a state of parties arise founded on geographical  
boundaries and other physical and permanent distinctions  
which happen to coincide with them, what is to control  
those great repulsive masses from awful shocks against  
each other?

 MonTPElIER, November 27, 1819.  
DEAR Sir: Your letter of the 11th was duly receiv.  
ed, and I should have given it a less tardy answer but  
for a succession of particular demands on my atten­  
tion and a wish to assist my recollections by con  
sulting both manuscript and printed sources of infor  
mation on the subjects of your inquiry. Of these,  
how ever, I have not been able to avail myself but  
very partially.  
As to the intention of the framers of the Consti­  
tution in the clause relating to the &quot;migration and  
importation of persons,&quot; &amp;c., the best key may per­  
haps be found in the case which produced it. The  
African trade in slaves had long been odious to most  
of the States, and the importation into them had been  
prohibited. Particular States, however, continued  
the importation, and were extremely averse to any  
restriction on their power to do so. In the Conven­  
tion the former States were anxious, in framing a new  
Constitution, to insert a provision for an immediate  
and absolute stop to the trade. The latter were not  
only averse to any interference on the subject, but  
solemnly declared that their constituents would never  
accede to a Constitution containing such an article.  
Out of this conflict grew the middle measure, pro  
viding that Congress should not interfere until the  
year 1808; with an implication that after that date  
they might prohibit the importation of slaves into the  
States then existing, and previous thereto into the  
States not then existing. Such was the tone of op  
position in the States of South Carolina and Georgia,  
and such the desire to gain their acquiescence in a  
prohibitory power, that on a question between the  
epochs of 1800 and 1808, the States of New Hamp-  
shire, Massachusetts and Connecticut (all the Eastern  
States in Convention) joined in the vote for the lat­  
ter--influenced, however, by the collateral motive of  
reconciling those particular States to the power over  
commerce and navigation, against which they felt, as  
did some other States, a very strong repugnance.  
The carnestness of South Carolina and Georgia was  
further manifested by their insisting on the security  
in the fifth article against any amendment to the  
Constitution affecting the right reserved to them, and  
their uniting with the small States, who insisted on a  
like security for their equality in the Senate.  
But some of the States were not only anxious for  
constitutional provision against the introduction of  
slaves; they had scruples against admitting the term  
&quot;slaves&quot; into the instrument. Hence the descriptive  
phrase, &quot;migration or importation of persons;&quot; the  
term migration allowing those who were scrupulous  
of acknowledging expressly a property in human be­  
ings to view imported persons as a species of emi­  
grants, while others might apply the term to foreign  
malefactors sent or coming into the country. It is  
possible, though not recollected, that some might  
have had an eye to the case of freed blacks as well as  
malefactors.  
  
But, whatever may have been intended by the term  
&quot;migration&quot; or the term &quot;persons,&quot; it is most certain  
that they referred exclusively to migration or impor­  
tation from other conntries into the United States,  
and not to a removal, voluntarily or involuntarily, of  
slaves or freemen from one to another part of the  
United States. Nothing appears or is recollected that  
warrants this latter intention. Nothing in the pro­  
ceedings of the State Conventions indicates such a  
construction there. Had such been the construction  
it is easy to imagine the figure it would have made in  
many of the States among the objections to the Con­  
stitution and among the numerous amendments to it  
proposed by the State Conventions, not one of which  
amendments refers to the clause in question. Neither  
is there any indication that Congress have heretofore  
considered themselves as deriving from this clause a  
power over the migration or removal of individuals,  
whether freemen or slaves, from one State to another,  
whether new or old; for it must be kept in view that  
if the power was given at all it has been in force  
eleven years over all the States existing in 1808, and  
at all times over the States not then existing. Every  
indication is against such construction by Congress  
of their constitutional powers. Their alacrity in ex­  
ercising their powers relating to slaves is a proof that  
they did not claim what they did not exercise. They  
punctually and unanimously exercised the power ac­  
cruing in 1808 against the further importation of  
laves from abroad. They had previously directed  
their power over American vessels on the high seas  
against the African trade. They lost no time in ap­  
plying the prohibitory power to Louisiana, which hav-  
ing maritime ports might be an inlet for slaves from  
abroad. But they forbore to extend the prohibition  
to the introduction of slaves from other parts of the  
Union. They had even prohibited the importation  
of slaves into the Mississippi Territory from without  
the limits of the United States in the year 1798, with­  
out extending the prohibition to the introduction of  
slaves from within those limits; although at the time  
the ports of Georgia and South Carolina were open  
for the importation of slaves from abroad and in­  
creasing the mass of slavery within the United States.  
If these views of the subject be just, a power in  
Congress to control the interior migration or remoy­  
al of persons must be derived from some other source  
than section 9, article 1; either from the clause giving  
power &quot;to make all needful rules and regulations res­  
pecting the territory or other property belonging to  
the United States,&quot; or from that providing for the ad­  
mission of new States into the Union.  
The terms in which the first of these powers isex­  
pressed, though of a ductile character, cannot well be  
extended beyond a power over the territory as prop­  
erty, and a power to make the provisions really need­  
ful or necessary for the Government of settlers until  
ripe for admission as states into the Union. It may  
be inferred that congress did not regard the interdict  
of slavery among the needful regulations contempla­  
ted by the Constitution, since in none of the Territo­  
rial Governments created by them is such an inter­  
dict found. The power, however be its import what it  
may, is obviously limited to a Territory while remain­  
in that character, as distinct from that of a State.  
As to the power of admitting new States into the  
Federal compact, the questions offering themselves  
are: Whether Congress can attach conditions or the  
State concur in conditions which, after admission,  
would abridge or enlarge the Constitutional rights  
of legislation common to other States; whether Con­  
gress can, by a compact with a new member, take  
power to or from itself, or place the new member  
above or below the equal rank andrights possessed  
by the others whether all such stipulations, express­  
ed or implied, would not be nullities, and so pro­  
nounced when brought to a practical test? It falls  
within the scope of your inquiry to state the fact that  
there was a proposition in the Convention to discrim­  
inate between the old and new States, by an article  
in the Constitution declaring that the aggregate num­  
ber of Representatives from the States thereafter to  
be admitted should never exceed that of States origi­  
nally adopting the Constitution. The proposition hap­  
pily was rejected. The effect of such a discrimination  
is sufficiently evident.

With respect to what has taken place in the North­  
west Territory, it may be observed that the ordinance  
ng its distinctive character on the subject of slave­  
holding proceeded from the Old Congress, acting  
with the best intentions, but under a charter which  
contains no shadow of the authority exercised; and it  
remains to be decided how far the States formed out  
of that Territory and admitted into the Union are  
on a different footing from its other members as to  
their legislative sovereignty.  
Whether the Convention could have looked to t  
existence of slavery at all in the new States is a point  
on which I can add little to what has been already  
stated. The great object of the Convention seemed  
to be to prohibit the increase by the importation of  
slaves. A power to emancipate slaves was disclaim­  
ed; nor is anything recollected that denoted a view to  
control the distribution of those within the country.  
The case of the Northwestern Territory was probably  
superseded by the provision against the importation  
of slaves by South Carolina and Georgia, which had  
not then passed laws prohibiting it. When the exis­  
tence of slavery in that Territory was precluded, the  
importation of slaves was rapidly going on, and the  
only mode of checking it was by narrowing the space  
open to them. It is not an unfair inference that the  
expe lient would not have been undertaken if the pow­  
er afterwards given to terminate the importation ey­  
ery where had existed or been even anticipated. It  
has appeared that the present Congress never follow­  
ed the example during the twenty years preceling  
the prohibitory epoch.  
Under one aspect of the general subject I cannot  
avoid saying that, apart from its merits under oth­  
  
ers, the tendency of what has passed and is passing  
fills me with no slight anxiety. Parties, under some  
denomination or other, must always be expected in a  
Government as free as ours. When the individuals  
belonging to them are intermingled in every part of  
the whole country, they strengthen the union of the  
whole while they divide every part. Should a state  
of parties arise founded on geographical boundaries  
and other physical and permanent distinctions which  
happen to coincide with them, what is to control  
those great repulsive masses from awful shocks  
against each other?

MosTriLtm, November 27, 1819.  
&#x27; D?a? sin Your letter of tbe 11 tb was duly received,  
] and 1 should have given It a tens tardy answer, but Tor a  
, succession of particular demands on my Attention and a  
wish to assist my recollections by consulting both manu­  
; script and printed sources of information on the subjects of  
your Inquiry. Of these, however, I have not been able to  
avail myself but very partially.  
As to tbe intention of thr framers of the constitution in  
the clause relating to tbe &quot;migration and inpormtlon ol  
persons,&quot; Ac, the best key may perhaps be found In the cause  
which produced it. The African trade in slaves had lont  
been oalous to most of the 8tates, and the Importation o  
slaves into them bad been prohibited. Particular Stales,  
however, con tin tied the importation, and were extremely  
averse to any restriction on their power to do so. In th&gt;  
convention tbe former States were anxions, in framing a  
: new coostitntion, to insert a provision for an immediate  
and absolute stop to the trade. The latter were not ouN  
averse to anv Interference on the subject, but solemnly de­  
clared that their constituents would never accede to a con­  
stitution containing such an article. Out of tbis conflict  
grew the middle measure, providing ibst Congress should  
not interfere nntll the year 1808 . with an Implication that  
after tbat date they might prohibit the importation ol  
slaves into the States then existing, and previous thereto  
! into tbe States not then existing. Much was the tone ol  
i opposition in the States of Sonth Carolina and Georgia.  
I and such tbe desire to gain tbeir acquiescence in a prohiM  
i lory power, that on a question between the epochs of 1800  
and 1808, tl?c States of New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and  
Connecticut (all the eastern States in convention) joined  
in the vote for tbe latter?influenced, however, by tbe col­  
lateral motive of reconciling those particular Stales to tbe  
power over commerce and navigation, against which they  
felt, as did some other State*, a very strong repngnanne  
The earnestness of South Carolina and (leorgla was further  
manifested by their Insisting on the security in the fifth  
article against any amendment lo the constitution affect­  
ing the right reserved to them, and their uniting with the  
small States which insisted ou a like security for their  
equality in the Senate.  
But some of tbe Stales were not only snxious for a con­  
stitutional provision against the introduction of slaves;  
tbey had scruples against admitting thr term &quot; tlavsk* ipto  
  
the luiUuoMml lieutw Um dsacriptive piuasr &quot; migration  
or importation of persons the terui migratiou allowing  
those who we re scrupulous ot acknowledging expressly a  
property iu human being* to view imported | ersous M a  
speciuieu of emigrants, while others might apply the terip  
to foreign malefactors sent or coming into the country. It  
id possible, though not recollected, that tome might hare  
bad ao eye to the caae of freed blacks m well as malefac­  
tors.  
But, whatever may have been intended by the term &quot;mi­  
gration &quot; or the term &quot; persona,&quot; it is moat certain that they  
referred exclusively to a migration or importation from  
otber countries into the United States, and not to a remo­  
val, voluntary or involuntary, of slaves or freemen from  
one to another part of the United States. Nothing appears  
or is recollected that warrants this latter intention. Noth­  
ing iu the proceedings of tbe Slate conventions indicates  
such a construction there, ilud auch been the construo­  
tion it ia easy to imagine tbe tigure it would have made in  
many of the States among tbe objectioua to the constitu­  
tion, and among tbe numerous amendments to it proposed  
by the State conventiona, not one of which amendments  
refers to the clauae in question. Neither ia there any  
indication that Congress have heretofore conaidered them  
selves us deriving from this clause a power over the mi­  
gration or removal of individuals, whether freemen or  
slaves, from one Slate to another, whether new or old; for  
it must be kept in view that if the power was given at all,  
it has been iu force eleven years over nil the StAtes exist­  
ing in 1808, and at all times over the Stutes not then exist­  
ing. Kvery indication ia agaiuat such a construction by j  
Congress of their constitutional powers. Their alacrity iu  
exercising their powers relating to slaves Li a proof that  
tli.y did not claim what they did not exercise. They  
punctually and unanimously exercised (lie power accru­  
ing in 1808 against the further im|&gt;ortalioti of slaves from  
abroad. They hud previously directed their power over  
American vessels on tbe high seas uyaiuat the African  
trade. Tbey lost no time in applying the prohibitory  
power to Louisiana, which, having maritime ports, might  
he an inlet for slaves from abroad. Hut they forbore to  
extend the prohibition to other parts of the Union. They  
had even prohibited the importation of slaves into the Mis­  
sissippi territory from without the limit* of the United Statei  
in the year 1798, without extending the prohibition to tbe  
introduction of slaves from within thou limit! ; although  
at tbe time the ports of Qeorgiu und South Carolina were  
open for the importation of slaves from abroad, and in­  
creasing the mass of slavery witbin tbe United States.  
If these views of the subject be just, a power in Congress  
to control the interior migration or removal of persons  
must be derived from some other source than section 0,  
article 1?either from the clause giving power &quot;to make  
all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory  
or other property belonging to tbe United States,&quot; or from  
that providing for the admission of new States into the  
Union.  
The terms in which the first of these powers is expressed,  
? hough of a ductile character, cannot well bo extended be­  
yond a power over tbe territory as property, and a power  
to make the provisions really needful or necessary lor the  
government Of settlers until ripe for admission as States

may, is obviously limited to u territory while remaining in

pressed or implied, would not be nullities, and so pronounced

at the time, the ports of Georgia and South Carolina were

“If these views of the subject be just, a power in Con  
gress to control the interior migration or removal of persons

regard the interdict of slavery among the needtul regula-

the territorial governments created by them is such an in-

““ Whether the convention could have looked to the ex-

The great object of the convention seemed to be to pro

to emancipate slaves was disclaimed ; nor is anything rec-

property in human beings to view imported persons as a |  
  
species of emigrants, while others might apply the term to  
foreign maletactors, sent or coming into the country. Itis  
possible, though not recollected, that some might have had  
an eye to the ease of freed blacks as well as malefactors.  
* But, whatever may have been intended by the term  
‘migration’ or the term ‘ persons,’it is most certain that  
they referred exclusively to a migration or importation from  
other countries into the United States, and not to aremoval,  
  
voluntary or involuntary, of slaves or freemen from one to |  
  
another part of the United States. Nothing appears, or is  
recollected, that warrants this latter intention.  
the proceedings of the State conventions indicates such a  
construction there. Had such been the construction, it is  
easy to imagine the figure it would have made, in many of  
the States, among the objections to the Constitution and  
  
among the numerous amendments to it, proposed by the ||  
  
State conventions, not one of which amendments refers to  
the clause in question. Neither is there any indication that  
Congress have heretofore considered themselves 4s deriving  
from this clause a power over the migration or removal of  
individuals, whether freemen or slaves, from one State to  
another, whether new or old; for it must be kept in view  
that if the power was given at all, it has been in force eleven  
years, over all the States existing in 1808, and at all times  
over the States not then existing. Every indication is  
against such a construction by Congress of their constitu-  
tional powers. Their alacrity in exercising their powers  
  
relating to slaves is a proof that they did not claim what |  
  
they did not exereise. They punctually and unanimously  
exercised the power accrui  
  
importation of slaves from abroad. They had previous!  
directed their power over Americangressels, on the high  
seas, against the African trade. They lost no time in ap-  
plying the prohibitory power to Louisiana, which, havin  
maritime ports, might be an inlet for slaves from abroad.  
But they forbore to extend the prohibition to the introduc-  
tion of slaves from other parts of the Union. They had  
  
even ibited the im in of slaves into the Missis-  
sippi Terriuocy, Croga without tha limite of the United States,
