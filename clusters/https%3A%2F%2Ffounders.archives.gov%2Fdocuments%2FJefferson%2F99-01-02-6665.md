To the Senate &amp; House of Representatives of the United States  
  
Octob. 27. 1807.  
  
Circumstances, fellow Citizens, which seriously threatened the peace of our Country have made it a duty to  
convene you at an earlier period than usual. the love of peace so much cherished in the bosom of our Citizens, which has  
so long guided the proceedings of their public Councils, &amp; induced forbearance under so many wrongs, may not ensure our  
continuance in the quiet pursuits of industry. the many injuries &amp; depredations committed on our commerce &amp; navigation  
upon the high seas for years past, the successive innovations on those principles of public law which have been  
established by the reason &amp; usage of Nations as the rule of their intercourse, &amp; the umpire &amp; security of their rights &amp; peace, &amp; all the circumstances which induced the  
extraordinary mission to London, are already known to you. the instructions given to our ministers were framed in the  
sincerest spirit of amity &amp; moderation. they accordingly proceeded, in conformity therewith, to propose arrangements  
which might embrace &amp; settle all the points in difference between us; which might bring us to a mutual understanding on  
our neutral &amp; national rights, &amp; provide for a commercial intercourse on conditions of some equality. after long &amp;  
fruitless endeavors to effect the purposes of their mission, &amp; to obtain arrangements within the limits of their  
instructions, they concluded to sign such as could be obtained, &amp; to send them for consideration: candidly declaring to  
the other negociators, at the same time, that they were acting against their instructions, and that their government  
therefore could not be pledged for ratification. some of the articles proposed might have been admitted on a principle of  
compromise, but others were too highly disadvantageous; &amp; no sufficient provision was made against the principal Source  
of the irritations &amp; collisions which were constantly endangering the peace of the two nations. the question therefore  
whether a treaty should be accepted in that form could have admitted but of one decision, even had no declarations of the  
other party impaired our confidence in it. Still Anxious not to close the door against friendly adjustment, new  
modifications were framed, &amp; further Concessions authorised than could before have been supposed necessary: &amp; our  
Ministers were instructed to resume their negociations on these grounds. On this new reference to amicable discussion we were reposing in Confidence, when on the 22d. day of June  
last, by a formal Order from a British Admiral, the frigate Chesapeak, leaving her port for a distant service, was  
attacked by one of those Vessels which had been lying in Our harbours under the indulgences of hospitality, was disabled  
from proceeding, had several of her crew killed, &amp; four taken away. On this Outrage no commentaries are necessary. it’s  
character has been pronounced by the indignant voice of our Citizens with an emphasis &amp; unanimity never exceeded. I  
immediately by proclamation, interdicted our harbors &amp; waters to all British armed vessels, forbade intercourse with  
them, &amp;, uncertain how far hostilities were intended, &amp; the town of Norfolk indeed being threatened with immediate  
attack, a sufficient force was ordered for the protection of that place, &amp; such other preparations commenced &amp; pursued  
as the prospect rendered proper. an armed Vessel of the United States was dispatched with instructions to our ministers at London,  
to call on that Government for the satisfaction &amp; security required by the outrage. A very short interval ought now to  
bring the Answer, which shall be communicated to you as soon as recieved. then also, or as soon after as the public  
interests shall be found to admit, the unratified treaty, &amp; proceedings relative to it, shall be made known to you.  
The aggression, thus begun has been continued on the part of the British Commanders, by remaining within our  
waters in defiance of the Authority of the Country, by habitual violations of it’s jurisdiction, &amp; at length by putting  
to death one of the persons whom they had forcibly taken from on board the Chesapeak. these Aggravations necessarily lead  
to the policy either of never admitting an armed vessel into our harbours, or of Maintaining in every Harbour such an  
armed force as may constrain Obedience to the laws, &amp; protect the lives and property of our Citizens against their armed  
guests. but the expense of such a standing force, &amp; it’s inconsistence with our principles, dispense with those courtesies  
which would necessarily call for it, &amp; leave us equally free to exclude the Navy, as we are the Army of a foreign power,  
from entering our limits.  
  
To former violations of maritime rights, another is now added of very  
extensive effect: the government of that nation has issued an Order interdicting all trade by neutrals between ports not  
in Amity with them. &amp; being now at war with nearly every nation on the Atlantic &amp; Mediterranean seas, our Vessels are  
required to sacrifice, their Cargoes at the first Port they touch, or to return home without the benefit of going to any  
other market: Under this new law of the Ocean, our trade on the Mediterranean has been swept away by seizures &amp;  
condemnations, &amp; that in other seas is threatned with the same fate.  
Our differences with Spain remain still unsettled, no measure having been taken on her part, since my last  
communications to Congress to bring them to a close. but under a State of things, which may favor reconsideration, they  
have been recently pressed, &amp; an expectation is entertained that they may now soon be brought to an issue of some sort.  
with their subjects on our borders, no new collisions have taken place; nor seem immediately to be apprehended. to our  
former grounds of complaint has been added a very serious one; as you will see by the decree, a copy of which is now  
Communicated. Whether this Decree, which professes to be conformable to that of the French Government of Nov: 21. 1806.  
heretofore communicated to Congress, will also be conformed to that in it’s construction &amp; application in relation to  
the United States had not been ascertained at the date of our last communications. these however gave reason to expect such a  
conformity—  
With the other Nations of Europe our harmony has been uninterrupted, &amp; commerce &amp; friendly intercourse  
have been maintained on their usual footing.  
Our peace with the several States on the Coast of Barbary appears as firm as at any former period, and as  
likely to Continue as that of any other nation.  
Among our Indian neighbors, in the northwestern quarter, some fermentation was observed soon after the late  
occurrences threatening the continuance of our peace. Messages were said to be interchanged, &amp; tokens to be passing,  
which usually denote a state of restlessness among them, and the Character of the Agitators pointed to the sources of  
excitement. Measures were immediately taken for providing against that danger: instructions were given to require  
explanations, and, with assurances of our continued friendship, to admonish the tribes to remain quiet at home, taking no  
part in quarrels not belonging to them. As far as we are yet informed, the tribes in our vicinity, who are most advanced  
in the pursuits of industry, are sincerely disposed to adhere to their friendship with us, and to their peace with all  
others. while those more remote do not present appearances sufficiently quiet to justify the intermission of military  
precaution on our part.  
The great tribes on our south western quarter, much advanced beyond the others in Agriculture &amp; houshold  
arts, appear tranquil &amp; identifying their views with ours, in proportion to their advancements. with the whole of these  
people, in every quarter, I shall continue to inculcate peace &amp; friendship with all their neighbors, &amp; perseverance in  
those occupations and pursuits which will best promote their own well: being.—  
The appropriations, of the last session, for the defence of our sea-port towns &amp; harbours, were made under  
expectation that a continuance of our peace would permit us to proceed in that work according to our convenience. It has  
been thought better to apply the sums then given towards the defence of New York, Charleston, &amp; New Orleans chiefly, as  
most Open &amp; most likely first to need protection; &amp; to leave places less immediately in danger to the provisions of  
the present Session—  
The Gun: boats too already provided have, on a like principle, been chiefly assigned to New York, New Orleans  
&amp; the Chesapeak. Whether our moveable force on the water, so material in aid of the defensive works on the Land, should  
be augmented in this or any other form, is left to the wisdom of the Legislature. for the purpose of Manning these  
vessels, in sudden attacks on our Harbours, it is a matter for consideration whether the Seamen of the U.S. may not justly  
be formed into a Special militia, to be called on for tours of duty, in defence of the Harbours where they shall happen to  
be; the ordinary Militia of the place furnishing that portion which may consist of Landsmen.—  
The moment our peace was threatened, I deemed it indispensable to secure a greater provision of those  
articles of military stores, with which our magazines were not sufficiently furnished. to have awaited a previous &amp;  
Special sanction by law, would have lost occasions which might not be retrieved. I did not hesitate therefore to Authorise  
engagements for such supplements to our existing Stock as would render it adequate to the emergencies threatening us: &amp;  
I trust that the Legislature feeling the same anxiety for the safety of our Country, so materially advanced by this  
precaution, will approve when done, what they would have seen so important to be done, if then assembled. Expenses, also  
unprovided for, arose out of the necessity of calling all our Gun: boats into actual service for the defence of our Harbors,  
of all which accounts will be laid before you.  
Whether a regular army is to be raised, and to what extent, must depend on the information so Shortly  
expected. In the mean time I have called on the States for quotas of Militia to be in readiness for present defence; &amp;  
have moreover encouraged the acceptance of volunteers, &amp; I am happy to inform you that these have offered  
themselves with great Alacrity in every part of the union. they are ordered to be organized, &amp; ready at a moments  
warning, to proceed on any Service to which they may be called, &amp; every preparation, within the Executive powers, has  
been made to ensure us the benefit of early exertions  
I informed Congress, at their last Session, of the enterprises against the public peace which were believed to be in preparation by Aaron Burr &amp; his Associates, of the measures taken to defeat them, &amp; to bring the Offenders to justice. their enterprises were happily defeated, by the patriotic exertions of the militia, wherever called into Action, by the fidelity of the Army, &amp; energy of the Commander in Chief, in promptly arranging the difficulties presenting themselves on the Sabine, repairing to meet those arising on the Missisipi, &amp; dissipating before their explosion, Plots engendering there. I shall think it my duty to lay before you the proceedings, and the evidence publicly exhibited on the arraignment of the principal Offenders before the circuit court of Virginia. you will be enabled to judge whether the defect was in the testimony, in the law, or in the Administration of the law; &amp; wherever it Shall be found, the Legislature alone can apply or originate the remedy. The framers of our constitution certainly supposed, they had guarded, as well their Government against destruction by treason, as their Citizens against oppression under pretence of it: And if these ends are not attained, it is of importance to enquire by what means, more effectual, they may be Secured.  
The accounts of the reciepts of revenue during the year ending on the 30th. day of September last, being not yet made up, a correct statement will be hereafter transmitted from the treasury. in the mean time it is ascertained that the reciepts have amounted to near sixteen ~ millions of Dollars; which with the five millions &amp; an half in the treasury at the beginning of the year have enabled us, after meeting the current demands &amp; interest incurred to pay more than four ~~~~~  millions of the principal of our funded debt. these paiments, with those of the preceding five &amp; a half years, have extinguished of the funded debt twenty five millions &amp; an half ~ ~of Dollars being the whole which could be paid or purchased within the limits of the law, &amp; of our contracts, &amp; have left us in the treasury eight millions &amp; an half ~~~  of Dollars. A portion of this sum may be considered as a commencement of accumulation of the surpluses of revenue, which, after paying the instalments of debt, as they shall become payable, will remain without any specific object. It may partly indeed be applied towards compleating the defence of the exposed points of our country, on such a scale as shall be adapted to our principles &amp; circumstances: this object is doubtless among the first entitled to attention, in such a State of our finances, and it is one which, whether we have peace or war, will provide security where it is due. Whether what shall remain of this, with the future surpluses, may be usefully applied to purposes already authorised, or more usefully to others requiring new authorities, or how otherwise they shall be disposed of, are questions calling for the notice of Congress; unless indeed they shall be superceded by a change in our public relations, now awaiting the determination of Others. Whatever be that determination, it is a great consolation that it will become known at a moment when the supreme Council of this nation is assembled at it’s post, and ready to give the aids of it’s wisdom &amp; authority to whatever course the good of our Country shall then call us to pursue.—    
Matters of minor importance will be the subjects of future communications, &amp; nothing shall be wanting on my  
part which may give information or dispatch to the proceedings of the Legislature in the exercise of their high duties,  
and at a moment so interesting to the public welfare—

TO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF  
REPRESENTATIVES OF THE U.

Circumstances, fellow citizens,  
which seriously threatened the  
  
»eace of our country, have made  
  
ita duty to convene you at an ear-  
  
lier period than usual. The love  
of peace, so much cherished in

has so long guided the proceed-

induced forbearance under so  
many wrongs, may not ensure  
our continuance in the quiet pur-

juries and depredations commit-  
  
ted on our commerce and naviga-

past, the successive innovations  
on those principles of public law,  
which have been established by  
the reason and usage of nations,

and the umpire and security of  
their rights and peace, and all  
the circumstances which induced  
the extraordinary mission to Lon-

to propose arrangements which  
might embrace and settle all the  
  
ints in difference between us,  
which might bring us to a mutual  
understanding on our neutral and  
national rights, and provide for a  
commercial intercourse on condi-  
tions of some equality. After  
long and fruitless endeavors to ef-  
  
fect the purposes of their mis-  
  
sion, and to obtam arrangements  
within the limits of their instruc-  
tions, they concluded to sign  
such as could be obtained, and to  
send them for consideration, can-  
didly declaring to the other nego-  
ciators, at the same time, that  
they were acting against their  
instructions, and that their go-  
vernment therefore could not be  
pledged for ratification. Some  
of the articles proposed: might  
have been admitted on a principle  
of compromise, but others were  
too highly disadvantageous, and  
no sufficient provision was made  
against the principal source of the  
irritations and collisions which  
were constantly endangering the  
peace of the two nations. The  
question, therefore, whether a  
treaty should be accepted in that  
form, could have admitted but of  
one decision, even had no decla-  
ration of the other party impair-  
ed our confidence in it. Still  
anxious not to close the door  
against friendly adjustment, new  
modifications were framed, and  
further concessions authorised,  
than could before have been sup-  
posed necessary, and our minis-  
ters were instructed to resume  
their negociations on these  
grrounds.’ On this new reference  
toamicable discussion, we were  
reposing in confidence, when on  
the 22d day of June last, by a  
formal order from a British ad-  
  
tmiral, the frigate Chesapeak,  
  
leaving her port for a distant ser-  
vice, was attacked by one of those  
vessels which had been lying in  
our harbors under the indulgences  
of hospitality, was disabled from  
  
proceeding, had several of her  
crew killed, and four taken away.  
On this outrage no commentaries  
are, necessary. Its character has  
been pronounced by the indig-  
nant voice of our citizens with an  
emphasis and unanimity never  
exceeded. I immediately by  
proclamation interdicted our har-  
bors and waters to all British  
armed vessels, forbade inter-  
course with them ; and uncertain  
how far hostilities were intended,  
and the town of Norfolk indeed  
being threatened with immediate  
attack, a sufficient force was or-  
dered for the protection of that  
place, and such other prepara-  
tions commenced and pursued as  
the prospect rendered proper.  
An armed vessel of the U. States  
was dispatched with instructions  
to our ministers at London, to  
callon that government for the  
satisfaction and security required  
by the outrage. A very short in-  
terval ought now to bring the an-  
swer, which shall be communi-  
cated to you as soon as received :  
then also, or as soon after as the  
public interests shall be found to  
admit, the unratified treaty, and  
proceedings relative to it, shall  
be made known to you.  
  
The aggression thus begun,  
has been continued on the part of  
the British commanders, by re-  
maining within our waters in de-  
fiance of the authority of the  
country, by habitual violations of  
its jurisdiction, and at length by  
putting to death one of the per-  
sons they had forcibly taken from  
on board the Chesapeake. These  
aggravations necessarily lead to  
the policy either of never admit-  
ting an armed vessel into our  
harbors, or of maintaining in  
every harbor such an armed  
force as may constrain obedience  
to the laws, and protect the lives  
and property of our citizens  
against their armed guests ; but  
the expence of such a standing  
force, and its inconsistence with

our principles, dispense with  
those courtesies which would  
necessarily call for it, and leave  
us equally free to exclude the  
navy, as we are the army of a  
foreign power, from entering our  
limits.  
  
To former violations of mari-  
time rights, another is now added  
of very extensive effect. The  
government of that nation has is-  
sued an order interdicting all  
trade by neutrals between ports  
not in amity with them, and be-  
ing now at war with nearly every  
nation on the Atlantic and Medi-  
terranean seas, our vessels are  
required to sacrifice their cargoes  
at the first port they touch, or to  
return home without the benefit  
of going to any other market.  
Under this new law of the ocean,  
our trade on the Mediterranean  
has been swept away by seizures  
and condemnations, and that in  
other seas is threatened with the  
same fate.  
  
Our differences with Spain re-  
main still unsettled, no measure  
having been taken on her part,  
since my last communications to  
congress to bring them to a close.  
But under a state of things  
which may favor re-consideration,  
they have been recently pressed,  
and an expectation is entertained  
that they may now be brought to  
an issue of some sort. With their  
subjects on our borders, no new  
collisions have taken place, nor  
seem immediately to be appre-  
hended. To our former grounds  
of complaint has been added a  
very serious one, as you will see  
by the decree, a copy of which  
is now communicated. Whether  
this decree, which professes to be  
conformabie to that of the French  
government of Nov. 21, 1806,  
heretofore communicated to con-  
gress, will aiso be conformed to  
that in its construction and appli-  
cation in relation to the U. States,  
had uot been ascertained at the  
date of our last communications.  
  
47  
  
These, however, give reason to  
expect such a conformity.  
  
With the other nations of Eu-  
rope our harmony has been unin-  
terrupted, and commerce and  
friendly intercourse have been  
maintained on their usual foot-  
ing.  
  
Our peace with the several  
states on the coast of Barbary  
appear as firm as at any former  
period, and as likely to continue  
as that of any other nation.  
  
Among our Indian neighbors in  
the north-western quarter, some  
fermentation was observed soon  
after the late occurrences threat-  
ening the continuance of our  
peace. Messages were said to be  
interchanged, and tokens pass-  
ing, which usually denote a state  
of restlessness among them, and  
the character of the agitators  
pointed to the sources of excite-  
ment.  
  
Measures were immediately  
teken for providing against that  
danger ; instructions were given  
to require explanations, and, with  
assurances of our continued  
friendship, to admonish the tribes  
to remain quiet at home, taking  
no part in quarrels not belonging  
tothem. As far as we are yet  
informed, the tribes in our vici-  
nity, who are most advanced in  
the pursuits of industry, are sin-  
cerely disposed to adhere to their  
friendship with us, and to their  
peace with all others. While  
those more remote, do not pre-  
sent appearances _ sufficiently  
quiet to justify the intermission  
of military precaution on our  
part.  
  
The great tribes on our south-  
western quarter, much advanced  
beyond the others in agriculture  
and household arts, appear tran-  
quil, and identifying their views  
  
-with ours in proportion to their  
  
advancements. With the whole  
of these people in every quarter,  
I shall continue to inculcate peace  
and friendship with all their

neighbors, and perseverance in  
those occupations and_ pur-  
suits which will best promote  
their own well-being.  
  
The appropriations of the last  
session, for the defence of our  
sea-port towns and harbors, were  
made under expectation, that a  
continuance of our peace would  
permit us to proceed in that work  
according to our convenience. It  
has been thought better to apply  
the sums then given towards the  
defence of New-York, Charles-  
ton, and New-Orleans chiefly, as  
most open and most likely first to  
need protection, and to leave  
piaces less immediately in dan-  
ger to the provisions of the pre-  
sent session.  
  
The gun-boats too already pro-  
vided, have, on a like principle,  
been chiefly assigned to New-  
York, New-Orleans, and the  
Chesapeake. Whether our move-  
able force on the water, so mate-  
rial in aid of the defensive works  
on the land, should be augment-  
ed in this or any other form, is  
left tothe wisdom of the legisla-  
ture. For the purpose of man-  
ning these vessels, in sudden at-  
tacks on our harbors, it is a mat-  
ter for consideration whether the  
seamen of the United States may  
not justly be formed into a spe-  
cial militia, to be called on for  
tours of duty, in defence of the  
harbors where they shall happen  
to be, the ordinary militia of the  
place furnishing that portion,  
which may consist of landsmen.  
  
The moment our peace was  
threatened, I deemed it indis-  
pensable to secure a greater pro-  
vision of those articles of milita-  
ry stores, with which our maga-  
zines were not sufficiently fur-  
nished, to have awaited a previ-  
ous and special sanction by law,  
would have lost occasions which  
might not be retrieved. I did  
not hesitate, therefore, to autho-  
rise engagements for such sup-  
plements to our existing stock, as  
  
would render it adequate to the  
emergencies threatening us ; and  
I trust that the legislature, ‘feel-  
ing the same anxiety for the safe-  
ty of our country, so materially  
advanced by this precaution, will  
approve, when done, what they  
would have seen so important to  
be done, if then assembled. Ex-  
pences, also unprovided for, arose  
out of the necessity of calling all  
our gun-boats into actual service,  
for the defence of our harbors,  
of all which accounts will be laid  
before you.  
  
Whether a regular army is to  
be raised, and to what extent,  
must depend on the information  
so shortly expected. Inthe mean  
time I have calied on the states  
for quotas of militia to be in rea-  
diness for present defence ; and  
have, moreover, encouraged the  
acceptance of volunteers, and I  
am happy to inform you, that  
these have offered themseives  
with great alacrity in every part  
of the union; they are ordered  
to be organised, and ready at a  
moment’s warning, to proceed  
on any service to which they may  
be called, and every preparation  
within the executive powers, has  
been made to ensure us the be-  
nefit of early exertions.  
  
I informed congress at their last  
session, of the enterprises against  
the public peace, which were be- |  
lieved to be in preparation by  
Aaron Burr and his associates, of  
the measures taken to deteat  
them, and to bring the offenders  
to justice ; their enterprises were  
happily defeated, by the patriotic  
exertions of the militia, wherever  
called into action, by the fidelity  
of the army, and energy of the  
commander in chief, in prompt-  
ly arranging the difliculties pre-  
senting themselves on the Sa-  
bine, repairing to meet those  
arising on the Mississippi, and  
dissipating, before their explo-

mencement of accumulation of  
the surplusses of revenue, which,

tary, the following MESSAGE to  
both Houses cf Congress.  
To The Senate and liOuse of Re­  
presentatives of the United  
States.  
Circumstances, fcllow-citi.  
which seriously threatened the peace  
of our country have made it a duty to  
convene you at an earlier period than  
usual. The love of peace so much  
cherished In the bosom of our citizens,  
which has so long guided the pro­  
ceedings of their public councils, and  
induced forbearance under so many  
wrongs, may not ensure our continu­  
ance in the quiet pursuits of industry.  
The many injuries and depredations  
| committed on our commerce and na­  
| vigaiion upon the high seas for years  
I past, the successive innovations on  
I those principles of: public law which  
j have been established by the reason  
] and usage of nations as the rule of  
their intercourse, and the umpire  
and security of their rights and peace,  
and all the circumstances which in­  
duced the extraordinary mission to  
London, are already known to you.  
The instructions given to our minis­  
ters were framed in the sinccrest spi­  
rit of amity and moderation. They  
accordingly proceeded, in conformity  
wherewith, to. propose arrangements  
which might embrace and settle all  
the points in difference between us ;  
Which might bring us to a mutual un­  
derstanding on our neutral and nation­  
al rights, and provide for a commer­  
cial intercourse on conditions of some  
equality. After long and fruitless en­  
deavors to effect the purposes of their  
mission, and to obtain arrangements  
within the limits of their instructions,  
they concluded to sign such as could  
be obtained, and to send them for con­  
sideration : candidly declaring to the  
other negotiators, at tbe same time,  
that they were acting against their in­  
structions, and that their government  
therefore could not be pledged for  
ratification. Some of the articles pro­  
posed might have been admitted on a  
j principle of compromise, but others  
J were too highly disadvantageous ; atid j  
■no sufficient provision was made a­  
; gainst the principal source of the irri­  
: tationsand collisions which were con­  
\ sl.mtly endangering the peace of the ;  
two nations. The question therefore I  
whether a treaty should be accepted in &#x27;  
tl_it form could have admitted but of »  
j one decision, even had no declarations  
jof the other party impaired our confi- j  
deuce in it. Still anxious not to close  
the door against friendly adjustment,  
new modifications were framed, and  
further concessions authorised than  
could before have been supposed ne­  
cessary : and our ministers were in­  
structed to resume their negocialions j  
on these grounds. On this new re­  
ference to amicable discussion we  
were reposing in confidence, when  
;on the twenty-second day of June j  
lust, by a formal order from a Bri- j  
! tieh admiral, the frigate Chesapeake, {  
leaving her port for a distant service, ;  
v\as attacked by one of those vessels!  
which had been lying in our bar- ,  
bors under the indulgences of hospi- j  
tality, was disabled from proceeding,  
! had several of her crew killed, and j  
four taken away. On this outrage no i  
commentaries are necessary. Its cha- j  
racter has been pronounced by the  
indignant voice of our citizens with an  
emphasis and unanimity never ex- (  
cceded. I immediately by proclama- J  
tion, interdicted our harbours and wa- &gt;  
ters to all British armed vessels, for- I  
bade intercourse with them, and, un- j  
Certain how far hostilities were in­  
tended, and the town of Norfolk in­  
deed being threatened with immediate  
attack, a sufficient force was ordered  
for the protection of that place, and  
such other preparations commenced  
and pursued as the prospect rendered [  
proper. An armed vessel of the  
United States was dispatched with in­  
structions to our ministers at London,  
to call on that government for the sa­  
tiflfaction and security t.-quiredby the  
outrage. A very short interval ought  
now to bring the answer which shall  
be communicated to you as soon as  
received; then also, or as SOO.n after  
as,the public interests shall be found  
to admit, the unratified treaty and pro­  
ceedings relative to it -ball he made  
known to you.  
The aggression, thus be  
been continued on the part ofthe Bri­  
i&#x27;r.ii commanders,by remainaig within  
our waters in defiance of the authori­  
ty of the country, by habitual viola­  
tions of its jurisdiction, and at length  
by putting to death one ofthe &quot;persons  
whom they had forcibly taken from on  
board the Chesapeake. These aggra­  
h ,d to the policy  
I either of never admitting an armed  
  
vessel into our harbors or of maintain­  
ing in every harbor such an armed  
force, as may constrain obedience to  
the laws, and protect the lives and pro­  
perty of our citizens against their arm­  
ed guests. But the expense of such a  
standing force, and its inconsistence  
with our principles, dispense with  
those courtesies which would necessa­  
rily call for it, and leave us equally  
free to exclude the navy, as we are the  
army of a foreign power, from en­  
tering our limits.  
To former violations of maritime  
rights, another is now added of very  
extensive effect. The government  
of that nation lias issued an order in- \
terdicting all trade by neutrals be­  
tween ports not in amity with them.  
And being n&gt; , with nearly  
every nationon the ■ and Me­  
diterranean seas, our vessels arc­  
quire ItO s ifi C(  
first port they touch, or to return  
home without the benefit of going to  
any other market. Under this new  
law ofthe ocean, our/trade on the  
diterranean has been swept away by  
si i aires and condemnations,  
in other seas is threatened with the  
same fate.  
Our differences with Spain remain  
still unsettled ;no measure having  
been taken on her part, since my  
communications to Congress, to bring  
ito a close. But under a state of  
things which may favor reconsidera­  
tion, they have ontly pre:  
and an expectation is entertained that  
they may now soon be brought to an  
issue of some sort. With their sub­  
jects on our borders, no new collisions  
have taken place ; nor seem immedi­  
ately to be apprehended. To our for­  
mer grounds of complaint has been  
added a very serious one, as you  
will see by the decree, a copy  
of which is now communicated.  
Whether this decree which professes  
to be conformable to that of the French  
government of Nov. 21, 1896, here­  
tofore communicated to Cong.  
Avill also be conformed to that in its  
construction and application in relati  
on to the United States, had not been  
ascertained at the date of our last  
communications. These however  
gave reason&#x27;to expect such a confor­  
mity.  
With the other nations of Europe  
our harmony has been uninterrupted,  
and commerce and friendly inter*  
j course have been maintained on their  
i usual footing.  
Our peace with the several states  
on the coast of Barbary appears lis  
firm as at any former period, and as  
j likely to continue as that of any other  
I nation.  
  
Among our Indian neighbors in the  
&#x27; north western quarter, some fermen­  
| tation was observed soon after the late  
i occurrences threatening the continu­  
; ance of our peace. Messages were  
| said to he interchanged, and tokens to  
jbe passing which usually denote a  
j state of restlessness among them,  
and the character of the agitators  
I pointed to the sources of excitement.  
j Measures were, immediately taken for  
providing against that danger: in­  
structions were given to require ex­  
planations, and, with assurances of  
our continued friendship, to admonish  
the tribes to remain quiet at home,  
] taking no part in quarrels not belong­  
{ ing to them. As far as we are yctin­  
j formed, the tribes in our vicinity, who  
are most advanced in the put suits of  
industry, are sincerely disposed to  
I adhere to their friendship with us, and  
ito their peace with all others. While  
those more remote do not present  
I appearances sufficiently quiet to jus­  
j tify the intermission of military pre­  
&#x27; caution on our part.  
1 The great tribes on our south wes­  
tern quarter, much advanced beyond  
! the others in agriculture and house!:eld  
! arts, appear tranquil and identn  
I their views with ours, in prope,  
Ito their advancements. With the  
| Whole of these people, in every qur.r­  
--| ter, I shall continue to inculcate peace  
I and friendship with all their neighbors,  
I and perseverance in those occupations  
I ami pursuits which will best pro  
I their own well-being.  
1 The appropriations of the last ses­  
sion, for the defence of our sea-port  
towns and harbours, were made un­  
der expectation that a continuance of  
our peace would permit us to pro  
in that work according to our conveni­  
ence. It has been thought better to  
apply the sums then given towards the  
defence of New York, Charleston,  
and New Orleans chiefly, as most  
open and most likely first to need pro­  
tection ; and to leave places less im­  
mediately in danger to the provisions  
of the present session.  
The gun-boats too already provided  
have, on alike principle, been chiefly  
assigned to New York, New Orleans  
and the Chesapeake. Whether our  
moveable force on the water, so ma­  
terial in aid of the  
the land, should be augmented in this  
or any other form, is left to, the wis­  
dom of the legislature. For thepur­  
-1 pose of manning these vessels, In  
sudden attacks on cur harbours, k is  
  
1 a matter for consideration whether the i  
seamen of the United States may not j  
justly be formed into a special mili­  
tia, to be called on for tours of duty  
m defence ofthe harbours where they  
shall happen to be ; the ordinary mili­  
tia of tin- place furnishing that portion  
which may consist of landsmen.  
T-,- , .1 .  
  
The moment our peace was thrcat­  
-1,1 deemed it indispensable to se­  
cure a greater provision of those arti­  
cles of military stores with which our  
magazines were not sufficiently fur­  
red. To have awaited a previous  
and special sanction by law, would  
hate losf occasions which might not be  
} retrieved. I did not hesitate there­  
fore to authorise engagements for  
h supplements to cur cxi  
i I render it adequate to  
the i les threa : and  
I tru.-i that the Legislature feeling  
the same anxii ty of our  
country, so materially d by  
mtion, will spj i oVe when  
done, what thi  
important to be d&gt;.n\c, if the  
o  
• out ofthe necessity o  
»ur gun-bbats into actual sv  
\ of our harbors, of all i  
h accounts will be laid before |  
you.  
Whether a regular army is to  
raised, and to what extent, must de­  
pend on the information so shortly ex­  
■l. In the mean time I have  
.1 on the States for quotas of Mi­  
,tobe in readiness ; I de­  
fence ; arid hi  
ed the acceptance of Volunteers,  
lam happy to inform you that these  
have offered themselves with great  
alacrity in every part of the union.  
They arc ordered to be organised,and &lt;  
ready at a moment&#x27;s warning, to pro-j  
ceedon any service to which they  
may he called, and every &#x27;preparation j  
within the Executive powers has been j  
re us the benefit of early j  
exertions.  
  
I informed Congress, at their last]  
session, of the enterprb &quot;the  
public peace, Which were believed to  
he in preparation by Aaron Burr and  
his associates, of the in ensures taken  
to defeat them, and to hring the of­  
fenders to justice. Their __terpri_ea  
were happily defeated, by the patrio­  
tic exertions ofthe militia, whenever  
called into action, by the fidelity ofthe  
army, and energy ofthe Commander  
in Chief, iv promptly arranging the  
difficulties presenting themselves im  
the Sabine, repairing to meet those  
arising on the Mississippi, and dissi­  
pating before bheip te_p_osion plots en­  
gendering there : I shall think it my  
duty to lay before you the proceed­  
ing :., and the evidence publicly exhi­  
bited on the arraignment of the prin­  
cipal offenders before the District  
Court of Virginia. You will be en­  
abled to judge whether the delect was  
in the testimony, in the law, or in  
the administration of the law ; and  
wherever it shall be found the I i  
lature alone can apply or originate the |  
remedy. The frame rs of our consti­  
tution certainly supposed they had  
guarded, as well their government a­  
gainst destruction by treason, as their  
citiaens against oppression, undcrprc­  
tfcnce of it ; and if these ends arc not j  
attained, it is of importance to enquire  
by what means, more effectual, they  
may bt secured.  
  
The accounts ofthe receipts ot re- j  
venue during- the year ending on the  
thirtieth day of September last, being  
not yet made up, a correct statement  
will be hereafter transmuted from the  
Treasury. In the mean tr_l. it h  
ascertained that the receipts have „­  
mounted to near sixteen millions of  
dollars; which v, ith the live millions  
and an half in .3 c tr&lt; isury at the be­  
ginning of the year h*ve enabled us,  
aftei the enrrentd mandsand  
interest incurred, to pay more than  
four millions ofthe principal cf our  
fund These payments with  
those ofthe preceding five and a half  
years, haveex ..ie funded  
j tiehttv.er.ty-five millions and a half of  
dollars, being the whole which could  
be paid or purchased within the li  
of the law* and of our contract.-,, and  
have left us in the treasury eight mil­  
lions and an half of Uolla.s. \ portion  
of this sum may be considered as a  
commence ment of accumulation ofthe  
s-.irplussrs df revenue, which, after  
paying the instalments of debt, as they  
shall become ps yaWe, will remain  
without any specific object, it may  
partly indeed be applied towards com­  
pleting tiie defence of the exposed  
points of our country, on such a  
as shall be adapted to our principles  
and circumstances. Tins object is  
doubtless among the first cr.tiiled to  
attention, in sue!&#x27;, a state of our finan­  
ces, and It is one which, whethet  
hive peace or war, Will provide  
vity where it is due. Whether  
uiin of this, with the Uilwrr  
surpiusse-:, may be usefully applied to  
purposes already authorised, or more  
usefully to others repining nev  
ities, or how otherwl &gt;&lt;  
be disposed of, are questioi  
  
indeed they shall be superseded by a,  
change IB our public relations, now u~  
waiting- the determination of others.  
Whatever be that determination, it is a  
great consolation that it will become  
known at a moment when the snpn  
council ofthe nation is assembled at its  
post, and ready to give the aids (

lO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTA­  
TIVES OF THE UNITED STATES.  
Circumstances, fellow-citizens, which seriously threatened the  
peace ol out country have made it a duty to convene you at an ear­  
lier period than usual. 1 he love of peace so much cherished in the  
bosom ol our citizens, which has so long guided the proceedings of  
then public councils, and induced forbearance under so many wrongs,  
in iy not ensuic our#continuance in the quiet pursuits of industry.  
I he main iujuries and depredations committed on our commerce Sc  
navigation upon the high seas for years past, the successive innova­  
tions on those principles ol public law which have been established  
hj&#x27; the reason and usage of nations as the rule oi their intercourse,  
and the umpire and security of their rights and peace, and all the cir­  
cumstances which induced the extraordidary mission to London, are  
already known to you The instructions given to our ministers were  
flamed in the sincercst spirit ol amity and moderation. They ac­  
cordingly proceeded, in conformity wherewith, to propose arrange­  
ments which might embrace and settle all the points in difference be­  
tween us, which might bring us to a mutual understanding on our  
neutral and national rights, and provide lor a commercial intercourse  
on conditions of some equality. After long and fruitless endeavors  
to effect the purposes of their mission, and to obtain arrangements  
within the limits of their instructions, they concluded to sign such  
as could be obtained, and to send them for consideration : ^candid­  
ly declaring to the other negotiators, at the same time, that they  
were acting against their instructions, and that tlicir government  
therefore could not be pledged for ratification. Some of the articles  
proposed might have been admitted on a principle of compromise,  
but others were too highly disadvantageous; and no suliicient provi­  
  
bioii was mace against the principal source of irritations and collisions  
which were constantly endangering the peace of the two nations. The  
question therefore whether a treaty should be accepted in that form  
could have admitted but of one decision, even had no d elaraiiono  
ol the other party impaired our confidence in it. Still anxious not to  
close the door against friendly adjustment, new modifications were  
framed, and further concessions authorised than could before have  
been supposed necessary : and our ministers were instruced to resume  
their negotiations on these grounds. On this new reference to ami­  
cable discussion we were reposing in confidence, when on the 22nd  
cl n of June last, by a iormal order from a British admiral, the fri­  
gate Chesapeake, leaving her port for a distant service, was attacked  
by one of these vessels which ha.i been lying in our harbors under  
the indulgences of hospitality, was disabled from proceeding, had  
several of her crew killed, and four taken away. On this outrage no  
commentaries are necessary. Its character has been pronounced by  
the indignant voice of our citizens with an emphasis and unanmity  
never exceeded. I immediately bv proclamation, interdicted our  
harbours and waters to all British armed vessels, forbade intercourse  
with tnem, and, uncertain how f ir ’io-. ilitics were intended, and the  
town of Norfolk indeed being tV- &#x27; ned with immediate attack, a  
sufficient force was ordered fur &lt; j : -otection of that place, and such  
other preparations commenced i , •-.-sued as the prospect rendered  
proper. An armed v«?sf ol : Stat&lt; 5 was dispatched with  
instructions to our ministers a , on, to call on that government  
for the satisfaction and m’ci. n • ire i bv the outrage. Avery  
short interval ought now to r.nsv.. r which shall breom­  
intinir-t-d toyou a‘ :,oo , . , , . - dicu also, or as soon after as  
the public’u’ .r *&gt;i a 1 .v . •« ..it, the unratified treaty and  
proceedings t dative h, ,i i known to you.  
  
The aggression, thus begun, has been continued on the par&#x27;  
the British commanders, by remaining within our waters in deft..&#x27; c  
of the authority of the country, by habitual violations oi its jurisdicti  
and at length by putting to death one of the persons whom they \\
forcibly taken from on board the Chesapeake. These augrava&#x27; /v -  
necessarily lead to the policy either oi never admitting an armed v s­  
scl into our harbors, or of maintaining in every harbor such an amfeef  
force as may constrain obedience to the laws, and protect the live  
and property of our citizens against their armed guests. B* ■ i ;e  
expense of such a standing force, and its inconsistence with on  
principles, dispense with those courtesies -which would necessarily  
call for it, and leave us equally free to exclude the navy, as we :uv  
the army of a foreign power from entering our limits.  
To former violations of maritime rights, another is now add  
of very extensive effect. The government ©f that nation has issued ao  
order interdicting all trade by neutrals between ports not inamit ?  
with them. And being now at war with nearly evciy nation on -he  
Atlantic and Mediterranean-seas, our vessels are required to sacrifice  
their cargoes at the first port they touch, or to return home without  
the benefit of going to any other market. Under this new law of the  
ocean, our trade on the Mediterranean has been swept away by set  
zures and condemnations, and that in other seas is threatened with  
the same fate.  
  
uur cnitercnccs with bpmn rcmmn still unsettled ; no measure Ha­  
ving been taken on her part, since my last communications to Con­  
gress, to bring them to a close. But under a state of things which  
may favor reconcideration, they have been recently pressed. an ex­  
pectation is entertained that they may now soon be brought to an is­  
sue of some sort. With their subjects on our borders, no new col­  
lisions have taken place, nor seem immediately to be apprehended.  
To our former grounds of complaint has been added a very serious  
one, as you will see by the decree, a copy of which is now communi­  
cated. Whether this decree which professes to be conformable to  
that of the French government of Nov. £!, 1806, Heretofore com­  
municated to Congress, will also be conformed to that in its con­  
struction anti application in relation to the United States, had not  
been ascertained at the date of our last communications. These how­  
ever gave reason to expect such a conformity.  
With the other nations of Europe our harmony has been uninter­  
rupted, and commerce and fi iendly intercourse have been maintained  
on their usual footing.  
Our pence with the several states on the const of Barbnry appears  
as firm as at any former period, and as likely to continue as that of  
any other nation.  
Among our Indian neighbour* in the nerth western quarter, some  
fermentation was observed soon after the late occ urrences threatening  
the continuance of our peace. Messages were said to be interchang­  
ed, and tokens to be passing which usually denote a state of restless­  
ness among them, and the character of the agitators pointed to the  
sources of excitement. Measures were immediately taken forprovi­  
ding against that clanger ; instructions were given to require expla­  
nations, and, with assurances of our continued friendship, to admo­  
nhii the tribes to remain quiet at home, taking no part in quarrel*  
not belonging to them. As far as we are yet informed, the tribes in  
our vicinity, who are most advanced in the pursuits of industry&#x27;, are  
sincerely disposed to adhere to their friendship with its, and to their  
peace fvith all others. While those more remote do not present ap«  
penances sufficiently quiet to justify the intermission of military pre­  
caution on our part. &#x27; 1

H.entiiving tnetr views with ours, in proportion to their advance­  
ments. _ V v iln tne whole of these people, in every quarter, I shall con­  
tinue lo inculcate peace and friendship with *41 their neighbours, and  
perseverance in those occupations and pursuits which will best pro­  
mote their own well-being. 1  
i lu* appropriations of the last session, fer the defence ofoursea­  
1 Mt towns and harbors, were made undcY expectation that n continu­  
ance ot our peace would permit us to proceed in that work aoeordin**­  
to our convenience- It has been thought better &#x27; to apply the sums  
then given towards the defence of New-York, Charleston* and New­  
Oj leans chieilr, as most open and most likely ftrst to need protection ;  
and to leave places lees immediately in danger to the provisions of  
the present session.  
1 he gun-boats too, already provided have, on a like principle, been  
chiefly assigned to New-York, Ncw-Orleans and the Chesapeake.  
V\ hether our moveable force on the water, so material in aid of the  
delenaive works on the land, should be augmented in this or any o­  
thcr form, is left to the wisdom of the legislature, For the purpose  
of manning these vessels, in sudden attacks on our harbours, it is a  
matter for consideration whether the seamen of the United States may  
not justly be formed into a special militia, to be called on for tours of  
duty in defence of the harbours where they shalihappen to be / the or­  
dinary militia of tlic place furnishing that portion which may consist  
of landsmen.  
1 he moment cur peace was threatened, I deemed it indispensible  
to secure a greater provision of those articles of military stores, with  
which our magazines were not sufficiently furnished. To have await­  
ed a previous and special sanction by law, would have lost occasions  
which might not he retrieved. I did not hesitate therefore to author­  
ise eng-agements for such supplements to our existing stock as would  
render it adequate to the emergencies threatening us : and I trust  
that the Legislature feeling the same anxiety for the safety of our  
  
country, so materially advanced by this precaution, will approve  
when done, what they would have seen so important to be done, if  
then assembled. Expenses, also unprovided for, arose out of the  
* necessity of calling all our gun-bouts into actual service for the de­  
fence of our harbors ; of all which, accounts will be laid before you.  
\Y hether a regular army is to be raised, and to what extent, must  
depend on the information so shortly expected, in the mean time I  
have called on the States lor quotas of Militia, to be in readiness for  
present defence ; and have moreover encouraged the acceptance of  
Y^oluntcers, and I am happy to inform you that these have offered  
themselves with great alacrity in every part of the union. They are  
ordered to be organized, and ready at a moment’s warning, to pro­  
ceed on any service to which they may be called, and ev“ry preparati­  
on within the Executive powers has been made to ensure us the be­  
nefit of early exertions.  
I informed Congress, at their last session, of the enterprizes against  
the public peace, which were believed to be in preparation by Aaron  
Burr and his associates, of the measures taken to defeat them, and to  
bring the offenders to justice. Their enterprizes were happily de­  
feated, by the patriotic exertions of the militia, whenever called into  
action, by the fidelity of the army, and energy of the Commander in  
  
Chief, in promptly arranging the difficulties presenting themselves  
on the Sabine, repairing to meet those arising on the Mississippi, and  
dissipating before their explosion, plots engendering there : 1 shall  
tuink it my duty to lay before you the proceedings, and tlu* evidence  
publicly exhibit &#x27;d on the arraignment of the principal offenders be­  
fore the District Court of Virginia. You will be enabled to judge whe­  
ther the delect was in the testimony, in the law, or in the administrati­  
on of the law and wherever it shall be found the legislature alone  
can apply or originate the remedy- The framers of our constituti­  
on certainly supposed they had guarded, as well their government  
against destruction by treason, as their citizens against oppression,  
under pretence of it, and il these ends are not attained, it is of im­  
portance to enquire by what means more effectual, they may be secur­  
ed.  
.Fpc accounts of the receipts of revenue during the year ending on  
the thirtieth day of September last being not yet made up, a correct  
statement w ill be hereafter transmitted from the Treasury. In the.  
mean time it is ascertained that the receipts have amounted to near  
sixteen millions of dollars ; which with the five millions and an half  
in the treasury at the beginning of the year have enabled us, after  
meeting the current demands and interest incurred, to pay more than  
fbui millions of the principal ol our funded debt. These payments’  
with those of the preceding five and a half years, have extinguished  
ol the funded debt twenty-five millions and an half of dollars, being  
the w hole which could be paid or purchased within the limits of the  
law, Sc of our contracts, fk have left us in the treasury eight millions  
and an half of dollars. A portion of this sum may be considered as  
a commencement ol accumulation of the surplusses of revenue, which,  
after paying the iustalments of debt, as they shall become payable,  
  
will remain witnout any specific object. It may partly indeed be ap­  
plied towards compleating the defence of the exposed points of our  
country, on such a scale as shall be adapted to our principles and cir­  
cumstances. 1 his object is doubtless among the first entitled to at­  
tention, in such a state of our finances, and it is one which, whether  
we have peace or war, will provide security where it is due.  
\v helhcr what shall remain of this, with the future surplusses, may  
be usefully applied to purposes already authorised, or more usefully  
t others requiring new authorities, or how otherwise they shall be  
disposed of, arc questions calling for the notice of Congress : unless  
indeed, they shall be superseded by a change in our public relations,  
now awaiting the determination of others. Whatever be that deter­  
mination, it is a great consolation that it will become known at a mo*

cretary, the following MESSAGE to both Hou­  
ses of Congress.  
To the Senate and House of Representatives of the*  
United Slates :  
Circumstances fellow-citizens, which seriously  
thieatened the peace of our country have made it a  
duty to convene you at an earlier period than usual.  
1 he love ot peace so much cherished in the bosom  
of our citizens, which has so long guided the pro­  
ceedings of their publick councils, and induced for­  
bearance under so many wrongs, tnav not ensure  
our continuance in the quiet pursuits&#x27; of industry.  
llic many injuries and depredations committed on  
our commerce and navigation upon the high seas  
tor years past, the successive innovations of those  
principles of publick law which have been establish­  
ed by the reason and usage of nations as the rule of  
their Intercourse, and the umpire and security of  
their rights and peace, and all the circumstances  
which induced the extraordinary mission to London,  
are already knowu to you. The instructions given  
to our ministers were iiamed in the sincerest spirit  
ot amity and moderation. They accordingly pro­  
ceeded, in conformity wherewith, to propose ar­  
rangements which might embrace and settle all the  
points in diHerenre between us ; which might bring  
us to a mutual understanding on our neutral and  
national rights, and provide for a commercial inter­  
course on conditions of some equality. After long  
and huitless endeavours to effect the purposes of their  
mission, and to obtain arrangements within thelimitg  
ot theiriuslructions, they concluded to sign such as  
l could be obtained, and to send them for considera­  
tion : candidly declaring to the other negotiators  
u the same time, that they were acting against  
their instructions, and that their government there-

fore could not be pledged for ratification. Some of  
the articles proposed might have been admitted on.  
a principle of compromise, but others were too high­  
ly disadvantageous; and no sufficient provision was  
made against the principal source of the irritations  
and collisions which were constantly endangering  
the peace of the two nations. The question there­  
fore whether a treaty should be accepted in that  
form could have admitted but of one decision, even  
had no declarations of the other party impaired our  
confidence in it. Still anxious not to close the door  
against friendly adjustment, new modifications were  
framed, and further concessions authorized than  
could before have been supposed necessary : and our  
ministers were instructed to resume their negociati­  
ons on these grounds. On tins new reference to  
amicable discussion we were reposing in confidence,  
when on the twenty-second ilay of June last, by a  
formal order from a British admiral, the frigate  
Chesapeake, leaving her port fora distant service,  
was attacked by one of those vessels which had  
been lying in our harbours under the iodulgenciesol  
hospitality, was disabled from proceeding, had se­  
veral of her crew killed, and four taken away. On  
this outrage no commentaries are necessary. Its  
character has been pronounced by the indignant  
voice ot our citizens with an emphasis and unanimi­  
ty never exceeded. 1 immediately by proclamation,  
interdicted uur harbours and waters to all British  
armed vessels, forbade intercourse with them, and,  
uncertain how far hostilities were intended, and the  
  
town of Norfolk indeed being threatened with im­  
mediate attack, a sufficient force was ordered for  
the protection of that place, aud such other prepa­  
rations commenced and pursued as the prospect ren­  
dered proper. An armed vessel of the United  
States was dispatched with instructions to our mi­  
nisters in London, to call on that government for  
the satisfaction and security required bv the out­  
rage. A very short interval ought now to bring  
the answer whieh shall be communicated to you as  
soon as received ; then also, nr as soon after as the  
publiek interests shall he found to admit, the unra­  
titied treaty and proceedings relative to it shall be  
made known to you.  
The aggression, thus begun, has been continued  
on the part of the British commanders, by remain­  
ing within our waters in defiance of tiie authority  
of the country, by habitual violations of its juris­  
diction, and at length by putting to death one of  
the persons whom they had forcibly taken from on  
board the Chesapeake. These aggravations neces­  
sarily lead to the policy either of never admitting  
an armed vessel into our harbours or of maintain­  
ing in every harbour such an armed force as may  
constrain obedience to the laws, and protect the  
lives and property of our citizens against their armed  
guests. But the expense of such a standing force,  
and its inconsistence with our principles, dispense  
with those courtesies which would necessarily call  
for it, and leave us equally free to exclude the navy,  
as we are the army of a foreign power, from enter­  
ing our limits.  
To former violations of maritime rights, another  
is now added of very extensive efiect. The govern­  
ment of that nation has issued ail order interdicting  
all trade by neutrals between ports not in amity  
with them. And being now at war with neatly e­  
very nation on the Atlar.lick and .Mitleterranean  
seas, our vessels are required to sacrifice their car­  
goes at the first port they touch, or to return home  
without the benefit of going In anv other marke,.  
Under this new law of the ocean, otir trade on the  
Mediteiranean Las been swept away by seizures and  
condemnations, and that in other seas is threatened  
with the same fate.  
Our dideteures with Spain remain still unsettled;  
no measure hav ng been taken on her part, smre  
my list communications to Congress, to bring  
them to aclo.se. But under a state of things which  
nny favour reconsideration, they have been recently  
pressed, and at. expectation is entertained that  
they inav now soon her brought to an issue of some  
sm t. With their subjects on our borders, no new  
collisions have taken place ; nor seem immediately  
to be apprehended. To our former grounds of com­  
plaint has been added a very serious one, as you  
will see by the decree, a ropy of which is now com­  
municated. Whether this decree which professes u,  
be conformable to that of the French government  
of Nov. !21, 1 bob&#x27;, heretofore communicated to  
Congress, will also he conformed to that in its con­  
struction and application in relation to the. United  
Slates, had not been ascertained at the date of our  
last communications. These however gave reason  
to expect such a conformity.  
Wuh the other nations of Europe our harmony  
has been uninterrupted, and commerce and friend­  
ly intercourse have been maintained on their usual  
footing.  
Our peace with the several states on the coast of  
Barhary appears as firm as at anv former pi rmd,  
and as likely to continue as that of any other nati­  
on.  
  
Among our Indian neighbours in the north wes­  
tern quarter, some fermentation was observed soon  
alter the late occurrences threatening the continu­  
ance of our peace. Messages were said to he inter­  
changed, and tokens to be passing which usually  
denote a state of restiesness, among them, and  
the character of the agitators pointed to the  
sources of excitement. Measures were immediate­  
ly taken for providing against that danger: instruc­  
tions were given to require explanations, ana, with  
assurances of our continued friendship, to admonish  
the tribes to remain quiet at home, taking no  
part in quarrels not belonging to them. As far as  
we pre yet informed, the tribes in our vicinity, vvbo  
are the most advanced in the pursuits of industry,  
are sincerely disposed to adhere to their friendship  
with ns, and to their pence with all others. While  
those more remote do not present appearces sntl.Ti­  
ently quiet to justify the intermission of military  
precaution on our part.  
The great tribes on our south western quarter,  
much advanced beyond the others in agriculture and  
household arts, appear tranquil and identifying  
their views with ours, in proportion to their ad­  
vancement. With the whole of these people, in e­  
very quarter, I shall continue to inculcate peace  
and friendship with all their neighbours, and per­  
severance in those occupations and pursuits which  
will best promote their own well-being.  
The appropriations of the last sesssion for the  
defence of our sea-port towns and harbours, were  
made under expectation that a continuance of our  
peace would permit U3 to proceed in that work ac­  
cording to our convenience. It lias been thought  
Ijetter to apply the sums then given towards the de­  
fence of New York, Charleston and. New Orleans  
  
chiefly, S3 most open ani&#x27;most likely first to need  
protection ; and to leave places less immediately in  
danger to the provisions of the present session.  
The gun-boats too already provided have, on e  
like principle, been chiefly assigned to &#x27;New-York.  
New-Orleans and the Chesapeake. Whether our  
moveable .force on the water, so material in aid ol  
the defensive works on the land, should be augment  
ed in this or any other form, is left to the wisdom  
ot the legislature. For the purpose of maiming  
these vessels, in sudden attacks on our harbours, it  
is a matter for*consid&lt; ration whether the seamen  
of the United States may not justly be formed  
into a special militia, to be called on for tours of  
duty in defence of the harbours where they shall  
happen to be ; the ordinary militia of the place fur­  
nishing that portion which may consist of lands­  
men.  
The moment our peace was threatened, I deem­  
ed it indispensable to secure a greater provision of  
those articles of military stores with which our ma­  
gazines were not sufficiently furnished. To have  
awaited a previous and special sanction by law,  
would have lost occasions which might not be re­  
trieved. I did not hesitate therefore to autho­  
rise engagements tor such supplements to our ex  
isting stock as would render it adequate to the  
  
emergencies threatening us, and I trusUhat tb&lt;­  
Legislature ieeling the same anxiety tor the safe­  
ty of our country, so materially advanced by  
this precaution, will approve when done, what  
they would have seen so important to be done,  
it then assembled. Expenses, also unprovided  
tor, arose out ot the necessity of calling all oui  
gun-boats into actual service lor the defence of  
our harbours; ot all which, accounts will be lain  
belore yon.  
Whether a regular army is to be raised, and to  
what extent, must depend on the information so  
shortly&#x27; expected. In the mean lime I have called  
on the States tor quotas of Militia, to be in rea­  
diness tor present defence, and have moreover en­  
couraged the acceptance of Volunteers, and I  
am happy to inform you that these have offered  
themselves with great alacrity in every part of  
the uii&#x27;on. &#x27;1 hey&#x27; are ordered ta be organized,  
and ready at a moment’s warning, to proceed  
on any service to which they may be called,  
and every preparation within the executive pow­  
ers has been made to ensure us the benefit of ear­  
ly exertions.  
1 informed congress, at their Tn^t session, of the  
enlerprizes against the publirk peace, which vveic  
believed to be in preparation by Aaron Burr and his  
associates, ot the measures taken to defeat them,  
and to bring tbs offenders to justice. Their entei­  
prizcs were happily deteated, by the patnotick ex­  
ertions of the militia, whenever called into action,  
by tile nudity ot the army, and energy of the com­  
mander in chief, in promptly arranging the difficul­  
ties presenting themselves on the Jsabine, repairing  
to meet those arising on the Mississippi, and dissi­  
pating belore their explosion plots engendered there :  
I shall thmk it my duty to lay belore you the pro­  
ceedings, an-J the evidence puhlickly exhibited on  
lt;e arraignment of the principal offenders before  
die mstn. i court of Virginia. You will be enabled  
to judge w hettiei the defect was in the testimony, in  
dm law, or in the administration of the law ; and  
wherever it shall be found, the legislature alone can  
appi v or originate the remedy. The framers of our  
constitution certainly supposed they had guaided,  
as well their government against destruction by trea­  
son, as their nuzeris against oppression, under a  
pretence ol it ; and if these ends are not attained,  
il is ot importance to enquire by what means, more  
effectual, they may lie secured,  
1 he accounts of the receipts of revenue during  
the year ending on the thirtieth day of September  
last, being not yet made up, a correct statement  
will be hereafter imusmitted from the Treasury. In  
the mean time it is ascertained that the rec eipts have  
amounted to near sixteen millions of dollars ; which  
with the five millions and a half in the treasury at  
the beginning ol the year have enabled us, after  
meeting the current demands and interest incurred,  
to pay more than four millions of the principal of  
our funded debt.  
Thpse payments with those of the preceding 5 &amp;  
a halt years, have extinguished of the funded debt  
twenty-five millions and a half of dollar*, being  
the whole which could he paid or purchased with­  
in the limits of the law and of our contracts, and  
have left us in the treasury eight millions and a half  
of dollars. A portion of this sum mav he consi­  
dered as a commencement of accumilation of the  
stirplusses of revenue, which, afte r paying the in­  
stalments of debt, as they shall beeonre payable,  
will remain without arty specific object. It mav  
partly indeed be applied towards compleating the  
  
‘■“t- p;;nib OJ OUT COUniry, Oil  
surli a scale as shall be adapted to our principles  
and circumstances.- Tliis object is doubtless a­  
mong the f.n.t entitled to attention, in such a state  
of our finances, and it is one which, whether we  
’nave peace or war, will provide security where it  
is due. Whether what shall remain of this, with  
the future surpasses, may be usefully applied to  
purposes, already authorised, or more usefully to  
others requiring n^w authorities, or how otherwise  
they sli.til be disposed of, are questions calling for  
the notice of Congress ; unless indeed they shall be  
superseded by a change m our public relations, now  
awaiting the determination ot others. Whatever  
Leth.it determination, it is n greit consolation that  
it will become known at a moment when the su­  
preme council of the nation is assembled ut its post,  
and ready to give the aids of its w isdom and au­  
thority to whatever course the good of our country  
shall then call ns to pursue. *  
Matters of minor importance will be the subjects  
ot future communications ; and nothing shall be  
wanting on my part which may give Information,  
or dispatch to the pioceedings of the* Legislature in  
the exercise of their high duties, and at a moment  
so interesting to the public welfare.

&#x27;Prefident’s Meflage.  
70 the Senate and House of Representatives,  
of the UNITED STATES.  
C IRCUMSTANCES, Fellow-Ci­  
tizens, whith seriously threaten­  
ed the peace of the country, have  
made it a duty to corvene you at an  
earlier period than usual. The love  
of peace, so much cherished in the bo­  
som of our citizens, which had so long  
guided the proceedings of their coun­  
cils, and induced forbearance under so  
many wrongs, may not ensure our  
continuance in the quiet pursuits of  
Industry. The many injuries and de­  
predations committed on our com­  
merce and navigation upon the high  
seas, for years past, the fucceflive in­  
novations on the principles of public  
law, which have been established by -  
the reason and usage of nations, as  
the rule of their intercourse, and the  
umpire and security of their rights  
and peace, and all the circumltances  
which induced the extraordinary mis­  
sion to London, are already known to  
you. The infiruélions given to our  
ministers were in the sincerest spirit of  
amity and moderation.—They accor­  
dingly proceeded, in conformity there­  
with, to propose arrangements which  
might embrace and {ettle all the points  
in difference between us, which might  
bring us to a&#x27; mutual nnderftanding on  
our neutral and national rights, and  
provide for 2 commercial intercourse  
on conditions of some equality. Af­  
ter long and fruitlefs endeavours to  
effe® the purpose of their mission, and  
obtain arrangements within the limits  
of their infiructions, they concluded to  
sign (uch as could be obtained, and to  
fend them for consideration, candidly  
declaring to their other negociators®  
that they were a&amp;ing against their in­  
firu&amp;ions, and that their government  
therefore could not be pledged for rat­  
ification. Some of the articles pro­  
posed might have been admitted on a  
principle of compromise, but others  
were too highly disadvantageous, and  
no fufficient provision was made a­  
gainst the principal source of the irri­  
tations and collisions which were con­  
stantly endangering the peace of the  
‘two nations. The question therefore  
whether a treaty should be accepted  
in that form, could have admitted but  
of one decision, even had ne declara­  
tion of the other party impaired our  
confidence in it. Still anxious not to  
close the door againlt friendly adjust­  
ment, new modifications were fram.  
ed, and farther conceflions authorifed,  
than could before have been supposed  
neceflary, and our ministers were in­  
firucted to refome their negociations  
on those grounds. ‘  
On this new reference to amicable  
difcuflion, we were repofling in confi­  
dence, when on the 22d day of June  
last, by a formal order from a Britith  
admiral, the frigate Chesapeake, leav- .  
ing her port for a distant service, was  
attacked by one of those vessels which |  
had been lying in our harbours under 1  
the indulgencies of hospitality, was  
disabled from proceeding, had several  
of her crew killed, and four taken a­  
way.~~On this outrage no commen­  
taries are necessary. Itschara&amp;er has  
been pronomnced by the indignant  
voice of our citizens with an emphasis  
and unanimity never exceeded. I  
immediately by proelamation inter­  
difted our harbours and waters to all  
British armed vessels, forbade inter­  
course with them, and uncertain how  
far hostilities were intended, and the  
town of Norfolk indeed being threat­  
ened with immediate attack, a fuff­  
cient force was ordered for the protec­  
tion of that place, and such other pre­  
parations commenced and pursued as.  
the profpeét rendered proper. An  
armed vessel of the United States was  
dispatched with inftru&amp;ions to our  
ministers at London 10 call on that  
government for the fatisfadtion and  
security. required by the outrage. A  
very short interval ought now te bring  
the answer, which {hall be commiuni­  
cated to you as foomn as received :  
then also, or as soon after as the pub­  
¥ic intereflls {hall be found to admit,  
the unratified treaty, and proceedings  
relative to it, shall be made known to  
you. e iy i  
The aggreflion thus begun, has been  
eontinued on the parc of the Britith  
eommanders, by remaining within our  
waters.in defiance of the authority of  
the country, by habitual violations of  
its jurisdiction, and at length by put­  
‘ting to death one of the perions whom  
they had forcibly taken fiom on board -  
the Chesapeake. These aggreflions  
neceflarily lead to the policy either of  
‘pever admitting an armed veflel into  
‘our harbours, or of maintaining in ev­  
‘ery such barbour, such ap armed force  
‘as may conflrain obedience to the  
laws, and proteét the lives and pro­  
perty of our citizens against their arm­  
ed guelts 5 but the expene of such a_  
ﬂ;&amp;s*forcc, ‘and its .inconfiltence  
with eur principles,difpenfe with those (  
  
courtesies which would neceflarily call  
for it, and leave us equally free to ex­  
clude the navy as we do the army of a  
foreign power, from entering our limits.  
To former violations of maritime”  
rights, another is now added of very  
extenflive effe®. The government of  
that nation has iflued an order interdi&amp;t- 1  
ing all trade by neutrals between ports  
not in amity with them, and being now  
at war with nearly every nation on the  
Atlantic and Mediterranean seas, our  
veflels are required to facrifice their  
cargoes at the firft port they touch, or  
to return home without the benefit of  
going to any other market. Under this  
new law of the ocean, our trade on the  
Mediterranean has been swept away by  
seizures and condemnations, and that in  
other seas is threatened with the fame fate.  
Our differences with Spain remain  
still unsettled, no measure having been  
taken on her part, since my lak com­  
munications to Congress, to bring them  
to aclofe. Butunder a state of things,  
which may favor reconsideration, they  
have been receatly prefled, and an ex­  
peation is-entertained that they may  
now soon be brought to an iflue of some  
fort. With their subjects on our bor­  
ders, no new collisions have taken place,  
nor seem immediately to be apprehend­  
r :  
ed. To our former grounds of com­  
&#x27; plaint has been added a very feriousone  
- as you will fee by the decree, a copy of  
! which is row communicated. Wheth­  
er this decree, which profefles to be  
&quot; conformable to that of the French gov­  
“ernment of Nov. 21, 1806, heretofore  
- communicated to Congress, will also be  
conformed to thatin its conftru&amp;ion and  
application in relation to the U. States  
had not been ascertained at the date of  
our last communications. These, how­  
ever, gave reason to expeét fach a con­  
formity.  
- With the other nations of Europe,  
our harmony has been uninterrupted,  
- and commerce and friendly intercourse  
have been maintained on their usual  
footing. ,  
Our peace with the several states on  
the coast of Barbary appears as firm as  
at any former period, and as likely to  
~ continue as that of any other nation.  
. Among our Indian neighbours, in  
&#x27; the north western quarter, some fer­  
- mentation was observed soon after the  
late occurrences threatening the contin-  
uance of our peace. Mefliges were said  
to be interchanged, . and tokens to be  
- pafling, which usually denote a Rate of  
&#x27; reflleflnefs among them, and the cha­  
“raéter of the agitators pointed to the  
sources of excitement ;—meafures were  
immediately taken for providing against  
~that danger ; infirucions were given to  
&#x27; require explanations, and, with assuran­  
ces of our continued friendthip, to ad­  
~monifh the tribes to remain quiet at  
- home, taking no part in quarrels not  
~belonging to them. As far as we are  
yet informed the tribes in our vicinity,  
who are most advanced in the pursuits  
of industry, are sincerely disposed to ad­  
here to their friendfhip with us, and to  
their peace with all others. ‘While those  
more remote, do not present appearan­  
ces fufficiently quiet to juftify the inter­  
mission of military -precaution on our  
part. | |  
  
The great tribes on our {outh western  
quarters much advanced beyond the  
others in agriculture and household  
arts, appear tranquil and identifying  
their views with ours in proportion to  
their advaneements. -With the whole  
of thefe.people in every quarter, I shall  
continue to inculcate peace and friend­  
thip with all their neighbours, and per­  
severance in those occupations and pur­  
suits which will best promote their own  
well being. &#x27; &#x27;  
The appropriations of the last feflion,  
for the defence of our sea port towns  
and harbours, were made under expec­  
tation that a continuance of our peace  
would permit us to proceed in that work  
according to our convenience. It has  
been thought better to apply the sum  
then given towards the defence of New-  
York, Charleton and New-Orleans  
chiefly, as most open and most likely  
firk to need proteftion, and to leave  
places less immediately in danger to the  
provisions of the present feflion.  
The gun-boats too already provided,  
have,oun a like principle, been chiefly as­  
signed to New-York, New:Orleans, and  
the Chesapeake. Whether our movea­  
ble foree on the water, so material in aid  
of the defenfive works on the land,  
should be augmented in this or any oth­  
er form, is left to the wisdom of the Le­  
gislature. For the purpose of manning  
these vefels, in sudden: attacks on our  
harbours, it is a matter for consideration.  
whether ths seamen of the United States­  
may not joftly be formed into a special  
militia, to be called on for tours of duty,  
in defence of the harbours where they  
{ball happen to- be, the ordinary militia  
of the place furnithing that portion  
which may consist of landsmen.  
- The moment-our peace was threat­  
ened, I deemed it indifpenfikile to secure .  
a great portion: of those articles of mili­  
tary Rores, with which our magazines  
were not fafliciently furnifhed ; to-have  
awaited a previous and special fan&amp;ion  
by law, would have loft occasions  
which might not be retrieved. I did  
not hesitate, therefore, to. authorife en­  
gagements for such fapplements to our  
Friting focky/As el reoder it ad­  
  
equate to the emergencies threatening  
us ; and I trust thatikbe Legislature,  
feeling the fame anxiety for the fafety  
of our cauntry so materially advanced  
by this precaution, will approve when  
done, what they would have seen so.  
important to be done, if then aiflem­  
bled. Expences, also unprovided for,  
arose out of the necessity of calling all  
our gun boats inzo actual service, for  
the defence of our harbours, of all.  
which accounts will be ﬁ g

Whether a regular army 510 Be

ceed on any service to which they may&quot;  
be called, and every preparation with­  
in the executive powers, has been  
made to ensure us the benefit of early  
exertions,  
I info*med Congress at their last  
feflion, of the enterprizes againlt the  
public peace, which were believed to  
be in preparation by Aaron Burr and,  
his associates, of the measures taken to  
defeat them, and to bring the offend­  
érs to justice ; their enterprizes were  
happily defeated, by the patriotic ex­  
ertions of the militia, wherever called  
into a&amp;tion, by the fidelity of the ar­  
my, and energy of the commander in  
chief, in promptly arranging the ma­  
ny difficulties presenting themselves on  
the Sabine, repairing to meet those a­  
rising on the Miflillippi,and diflipating,  
before their explosion, plots engender­  
ing there. I shall think it my duty  
to lay before you the proceedings and  
the evidence publicly exhibited on the  
arraignment of the principal offend­  
ers before the diltri&amp; court of Virgin:  
ia, you will be enabled to judge  
whether the defe&amp; was in the testimo­  
ny, in the law or in the administration  
of the law ; and wherever it shall be  
found, the legislature alone can apply  
or originate the temedy. The fram.  
ers of our constitution certainly sup­  
posed they had guarded, as well their  
government against deftru&amp;tion by  
treason, as their citizens against op­  
preflion under pretence of it ; and if  
these ends are not attained, it is of im­  
portance to enquire by what means  
more effeually, they may be secured.  
Thé accounts of the receipts of rev­  
enue during the year on the 3oth day  
of September lal}, being not yet made  
up; a corredt statement will be here­  
after tranimitted from the treasury, in  
the mean time it is ascertained that  
the receipty have amounted to pear  
sixteen millions of dollars, which, with  
the five millions and an half in the  
  
treasury at the beginning of the year,  
have enabled us, after meeting the  
current demands, and interest incur­  
red, to pay more than four millions  
of the principal of our sanded debt—  
These payments, with those of the  
‘ preceding five and a half years, have  
~ extinguished of the funded debt twen­  
&#x27; ty-five million and a half of dollars,  
being the whole which could be paid  
or purchased within the limits of the  
! law, and of our contradts, and have  
left us in the treasury eight milliens  
’ and a half of dollars. A portion of  
this fom may be considered as a com­  
- mencement of accumulation of the  
furplufles of revenue, which,after pay­  
ing the inftalments of debt as they  
fthall become payable, will remain  
without any fpecific obje@i It may  
partly, ingeed, be applied towards  
compleating the defence of the expos  
ed pomts of our country, on such a  
scale as shall be adapted to our prin­  
ciples and circumstances.  
~This objeét is, doubtless, among the  
firft entitled to attention, in fach a  
state of our finances ; and it is one  
.which, whether we have peace or war,  
will provide security where it 1s due.  
Whether what fhkall remain of this,  
&#x27;with the fature furplufles may be vfe.  
fully applied to purposes already au­  
thorifed, or more ufeful to others re­  
‘quiring new authorities, or how oth­  
erwise they shall be disposed of, are  
questions calling for the natice of Con­  
‘grefs ; unless indeed they shall be fu­  
perceded by a change in our public re­  
lations, now awaiting the determina~  
tion of others. Whatever be that de­  
termination, it is a great consolation  
that it wilk become kdown at a mo­  
ment when the supreme council of  
the nation is assembled: at its post, and  
ready to give the aids of its wisdom  
and authority to whatever course the  
‘good of our country shall then. call us  
10 pursue. -/ =~ &#x27; -_  
- Matters of minor importance will  
be the subject of future commupiga­  
tions ; and nothing shall be wanting  
‘on my part, which may give informa­  
tion or dispatch to the proceé.dmgh ;  
of the legislature, in the exercifs of  
their high duties, and at a moment  
so interesting to the public welfare. 3

To the Senate and House of Representatives  
of the United States.  
CIRCUMSTANCES, fellow-citizens,  
which seriously threatened the peace of our  
country, have made it a duty to convene  
you atanearlier period than usual. The  
love of peace so much cherished in the bo-  
som of our citizens, which had so long  
guided the proceedings of their public  
councils, and induced forbearance under so  
many wrongs, may not enstire our contin-  
wancé in the quiet pursuits of industry.  
The many injuries and depredations com-  
mitted on our commerce and navigation up-  
on the high seas, for years past, the suc-  
cessive innovations on those principles of  
public law, which have been established by  
the reason and usage of nations, as the  
rule of their intercourse, and the umpire  
and security of their rights and peace,  
and all the circumstances. which indu-  
ced the extraordinary mission to London,  
are already known to you. The instruc-  
tions given to our ministers were framed in  
the sincerest spirit of amity and modera-  
tion. They accordingly proceeded, in  
conformity therewith, to propose arrange-  
ments which might embrace and settle all  
the points in difference between us, which  
might bring us to a mutual understanding on  
our neutral and nauional rights, and provide  
for a commercial intercourse on conditions  
of some equality. After long and fruitless  
endeavors to effect the purposes of their  
mission, and to obtain arrangements with-  
in the limits of their instructions, they con-  
cluded to sign such as could be obtained,  
and to send them for consileration, candid-  
ly declaring to the other negociators, that  
they were acting against their instructions,  
and that their government therefore could  
not be pledged for ratification. Some of the  
  
  
  
  
  
articles proposed might have becn admiit-  
ed 0g a principle of compromise, but oth-  
  
  
  
  
  
ers were too highly disadvantageons): ana  
Lo sufficient provision was made against the  
principle source of the irritations and col&lt;  
lisions which were constantly endangering  
the peace of the two nations. The gues-  
tion thercfore whether a treaty should be  
accepted in that form, could have admitted  
but of One decision, even had no declara-  
ion of the other party impaired our conf.  
dence in it. Still anxious not to close the  
door aguinsi friendly adjustment, new mod-  
ifications weré framed, and further conces-  
sions authorised, than could before have  
been supposed necessary, and.our minis.  
ters were instructed to resume their nego-  
ciations on those grounds.  
  
On this new reference to amicable dis-  
cussion, we were reposing in confidence,  
when on the 22d day of June last, by a for-  
mal order from a British admiral, the tri-  
gate Chesapeake, leaving her port for a  
distant service, was attacked by one of  
those vessels which had been lying in our  
harbors under the indulgences of hospitul-  
ity, was disabled from proceeding, had sey-  
eral of her crew killed, and four takeu away,  
On this outrage ne commentarics are neces-  
sary. Its character has been pronounced  
by the indignant veice of our citizens with  
an emphasis and unanimity never exceeded,  
I immediately by proclamation, interdict-  
ed our harbors and waters to all British  
armed vessels, forbade intcrcourse with  
them, and uncertain how far _ hosiilities  
were intenced, andthe town oi Norfolk in-  
deed being threatened with immediate at-  
tack, a sufficient force was ordered for the  
protection of that piace, and such other  
preparations commenced and pursued as  
the prospect rendered preper. An armed  
vessel of the United States was dispatched  
with instructions to our ministers at Lone  
don, to call on that government for the sat-  
isfuction and security required by the out-  
rage. A very short interval ought now to  
bring the answer, which shall be communi- *  
cated to you as soon as received : then also,  
or as soon after as the public interests  
shall be found to admit, the unratified trea-  
ty, and proceedings relative to it, shall be  
made known to you.  
  
The aggression thus begun, has been  
continued on the part of the British com,  
manders, by remaining within our waters  
in defiance of the authority of the country,  
by habitual violations of its jurisdiction,  
and at length by putting to death one of  
the persons whom they had forcibly taken  
from on board the Chesapeake. These  
aggravations necessarily lead to the poli-  
cy either of never admitting an armed ves-  
selinto our harbors, or of maintaining Jn  
every harbor such an armed force as may  
constrain obedience to the laws, and pro-  
tect the lives and property of our citizens  
Against their armed guests ; but the ex-  
pense of such a standing force, and its 1p-  
consistence with our principles, dispense.  
with those courtesies which would necessa-  
rily call for it, and leave us equally free to  
exclude the navy, as we are the army of a  
foreign power, from entering our limits.  
  
To former violations of maritime rights,  
another is now added of very extensive ef-  
fect. , The, government of that nauon -has  
issued an order interdicting all trade by  
neutrals between ports not in, amity wie  
them, and being now at war with nearly

crifice their cargoes. at the first port they  
Youch or return bome without the bene;  
fit of going to any other market, Under  
this new law cf the ocean, our trade on the  
Mediterranean has been swept away by sel-  
zures and condemnations, and that in oth-  
er seas is threatned with the same fate. _  
  
Our differences with Spain remain still  
unsettled, no measure haying been taken  
of her part, since my last communications  
to Congress, to bring them to a close. But  
under astate of things, which may favour  
reconsideration, they have been recently  
pressed, and an expectation is entertained  
they may now soon be brought to an issue  
of some sort. With their subjects on our  
borders, no new collisions have taken place,  
nor seem immediately to be apprehended.  
To our former grounds of complaint has  
been added a very ‘serious one, as you will  
see by the decree, a copy of which is now  
communicated. Whether this decree,  
which professes to be conformable to that of  
the French government of Nov. 21, 1806,  
heretofore communicated to congress, will  
also be conformed to tlrat in its construc-  
tion and application inrelation to the U.S.  
had not been ascertained at the date of our  
last communications. These, however,  
gave reasoh to expect such a confor-  
mity.  
  
With the other nations of Europe our har-  
mony hus been uninterrupted, and com-  
merce and friendly intercourse have been  
maintained on their usual footing.  
  
Our,peace with the several states on the  
coast of barbary appears as firm as at a-  
ny dormer period, and as likcly to continue  
asthat of any other nation.  
  
Among our Indian nejghbors, in the  
north western quarter, some fermentation  
was observed soon alter the late occurrenc-  
es threatening the continuance of our peace.  
Messages were suid to be interchanged, and  
tokens to be passing, which usually denotes  
astate of restiessness among them, and the  
character.of the agitators pointed to the  
sources of excitement. Measures were  
immediatcly taken for providing against that  
danger; instructions were given io require  
explanations, and, with assurances of our  
continued friendship; to admonish the  
tribes to remain quiet at home, taking no  
partin quarrels not belonging tothem. As  
far as’we are yetinformed, the tribes in our  
Vicinity, who are most advanced in the pur-  
suits of industry, are sincerely disposed to  
adhere to theirfriendship with us and to  
their peace with.all others. While those  
more remote-o hot present appearances  
sufficiently quict to justify the iniermissicn  
of military precaution on our part.  
  
The great tribes on our south western  
quarter much advanced beyond the others  
in agriculture and household arts, appear  
tranquil and identifying their views with  
eurs in proportion to their advancements.—  
With the whole of these people in every  
quarter, I shall continue to inculcate peace  
and friendship with all their neighbors, znd  
perseverance in those occupations and pur-  
suits which will best promote their own  
well-Leing. }  
  
The appropriations of the last session,  
forthe defence of our sea-port towns and  
harbours, were made under expectation,  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
eo eee  
  
  
  
  
  
that a continuance of our peace would per-  
mit us to proceed in that work according,to  
our convenience. It has been thought bet-  
ter to apply the sums then given towards  
the defence of New-York, Charleston and  
New-Orleans chiefly, as most open and  
most likely first to need protection, and to  
leave places less immediately in danger to  
the provisions of the present session.  
  
The gup-boats too, already provided;have  
on a like principle, been chietly assigned to  
N.York, New-Orleans and the Chesapeake.  
Whether our moveable force onthe water,  
so material in aid of defensive works on the  
land, should be augmented in this or any o-  
ther form, is left to the wisdom of the Je-  
gislature. . For the purpose of manning  
these vessels, in sudden attacks on our har-  
bors, itis a matter for consideration whe-  
ther the seamen of the United States may  
not justly be formed into a special militia,  
to be called on for tours of duty, in defence  
of the harbours where they shall happen to  
be, the ordinary militia of the place turnish-  
ing that portion which may consist ef lands-  
men.  
  
The moment our peace was threatened, I  
deemed it indispensible to secure a greater  
provision of those articles of military stores,  
with which our magazines were not suffi-  
ciently furnished to have awaited a previ-  
ous and special! sanction by law, would have  
lost occasions which might not be retrieved.  
I did not hesitate, therciore, to authorise en-  
gagements for such supplements to our ex-  
isting stock, as would render it adequate to  
the emergencies threatening us; and I  
trust that the legtslaiure, feeling the same  
anxiety for the safety of our sountry, so ma-  
terially advanced by this precaution, will  
approve when done, what would have been  
so important to be done, if then assembled.  
I:xpences, also unprovided for, arose out of  
the necessity of calling all our gun-bouts in-  
to actual service, for the defence of our  
harbors, of all which, accounts will be laid  
before you.  
  
Whether a regular army is to be raised,  
and to what extent, must depend on the in-  
formation so shortly expected. In‘ the  
mean time, I have cated on the states for  
quotas of militia to be in readiness for pre-  
sent defence ; and have, moreover, encou-  
raged the accepiance of volunteers, and I  
ani happy to inform you, that these have of-  
fered themselves in every part of the union;  
they are ordered to be organized, and rea-  
dy at a moment’s warning, to proceed on a-  
ny service to which they may be called, and  
every preparation within the executive  
powers, has been made to ensure us the be-  
nefit of early exertions.  
  
I informed congress at their last session,  
of the enterprises against the public peace,  
which were believed to be in preparation by  
Aavon Burr and his associates, of the mea-  
sures taken to defeut them, and to bring the  
offcaders to justice ; their enterprizes were  
happily defeated, by the patriotic exertions  
of the militia, wherever called inte action,  
by the fidelity of the army, and energy of  
the commander in chief, in promptly ar-  
ranging the diffeukies presenting them-  
selves on the Sabine, repairing to meet  
those arising on the Mississippi and dissi-  
pating: before their explosion. plets engen-  
dered there. I shall think it my duty to  
lay before you the proceeuings and the evi-  
  
  
  
  
  
ys “ar aoa -  
dence publicly exhibited on the arraign-  
ment of the principal offenders before the  
district court of Virginia, you will be ena-  
bled to judge whether the defect was in the  
testimony, in the law, or in the edministrae  
tion of the law; and wherever it shall be  
found, the legislature alone can apply or o-  
riginate the remedy. The framers of our  
constitution certainly supposed they had  
guarded as well their government against  
destruction by treason, as their citizens a-  
gainst oppression under pretence of it;  
and if these ends are not attained, it isof  
importance to enquire by what means more  
effectually, they may be secured.  
  
The accounts,of the receipts of revenue  
during the year ending on the 30th day of  
September last, being not yet made up, a  
correct statement will be hereafter trans-  
mitted front the treasury; in the mean  
time it is ascertained that the receipts have  
amounted to near sixteen millions of dol-  
lars,which,with the five millions and an half  
in the treasury at the beginning of the year,  
have enabled us, after meeting the current  
demands, and interest incurred, to pay  
more than four millions into the principal  
of our funded debt—These payments,  
with those of the preceding five and an  
half years, Have extinguished of the  
funded debt, twenty-five millions and an  
half of dollars, being’ the whole which  
could be paid or purchased within the Ii-  
mits of the law, and of our contracts, and  
have left us in the treasury eight millions  
and an half of dollars. A portion of this  
sum may be considered as a commence  
ment of accumulation of the surplusses of  
revenue, which, after paying the install-  
ments of debt as they shall become paya-  
ble, will remain without any specifié object.  
It may partly, indeed, be applied towards  
compleating the defence of the exposed  
points of,our country, on such a scale as  
shall be adapted to our principles and cir-  
cumstances. This object is, doubtless, a=  
mong the first entitled to attention, in such  
a state of our finances; and itis one. which,  
whether we have peace or war, will provide  
security where it is due. Whether what  
shall remain of this, with the fature sur-  
plusses, may be usefully applied to purpo-  
ses already authorized, or more usefully to  
others requiring new authorities, or how o-  
therwise they shall be disposed of, are ques-  
tions calling for the notice of congress: un-  
less they shalt be superceded by a change  
in our public relations new awaiting the  
determination. of others. Whatever be  
that determiuatjon, it isa great consolation  
thacit willbe known at a moment when  
the supreme council of the nation is as-  
sembied at its post, ai@ ready to give the  
aid of its wisdem and autherity to whatev-  
er couise the good of our country shall  
then call us to pursue,  
  
Matters of minor importance will be the  
subjects of futuré’ communication ; and  
nothing shalt be wanting on my part, which  
may give information or dispatch te the  
proceedings of the legislature inthe exer-  
cise of their higher duties, and at a moment  
so interesting to the publie welfare.

have called on the btates lor quotas ot iviiiiua  
  
to be in readiness for present defence ; and  
h ive moreover encouraged, the acceptance of  
Volunteers, and I am happy to inform you that  
these have offered themselves with great ala­  
&quot; crity in every part of the union . They are or  
de&#x27;rctl to be organized, and ready at a mo­  
ment&#x27;s warning, to proceed on any service to  
which they may be called, and every prepar­  
ation wlthinthe Executive powers has been  
inade to ensure us the benefit of early exer  
  
tions. x  
I informed Congress, at their last session, of  
  
the enterprizes against the public peace, which  
were believed to be in preparation by Aaron  
B irrand his associates, of the measures taken  
to defeat them, arid to bring the offenders to  
justice. Their enterprizes were happily de­  
feated, by the patriotic exertions of the militia,  
whenever&#x27; called into action, by the fidelity of  
  
the a..my, and energy of the Commander  
  
Chief in promptly .arranging the ditiioultiedf  
presenting themselves&#x27;on the Sabine, repair­  
ing to meet those arising on the Mississippi,  
and dissipating before their explosion plots en­  
gendering there : , I shall think it my duty to  
lay before you the proceedings, and the evi­  
dence publicly exhibited oa jhe arraignment  
of the principal offenders before the District  
Court of Virginia. You will be enabled to  
judge whether the defect was in the testimo­  
ny, in the law or in the administration ofjhe  
law ; and wherever it shall be found the Le­  
.gislature alone can apply or originate the re­  
medy. The framers of our constitution cer­  
tainly supposed they had , guarded, as well  
the&#x27;tr government against destruction by trea­  
son, as their citizens against oppression, under  
pretence, of it; and if these &quot;ends are not at­  
tained, it is of importance lo enquire by what  
means, more effectual, they may be secured.  
- The accounts of the receipts of revenue du­  
ring the year ending on the thirtieth day of  
September last, being not yet made up, a cor­  
rect statement will be hereafter transmitted  
irom the Treasury. In the mean time it is  
ascertained that the receipts have amounted  
to near sixteen millions of dollars ; which with  
the five mijlions and an half in the .treasury at  
thebegin-.ungt-f the year have enabled us, af&#x27;  
ter meeting the current demands and interest  
  
incurred, to pay more than four millions of  
  
the principal of our funded debt. These pay­  
ments with thostt of the preceding five and an  
half years,: have extinguishedpf . the funded  
debt twenty-five millions and a half of dollars,  
ijjeing the whole which could be paid or pur­  
chased within the limits of the law, and of our  
contracts, and have left us ! in fhe treasury  
eightmillions aiid an half-of dollars. A por­  
tioii of this sum ittay be considered as 4c6m  
inenceitieht of accumuUlion of the s&#x27;urplusses  
of revenue, which, &quot;after paying, the ; instal­  
ments of debt, as they shall become payable,  
Avill remain without any specific obiect. It  
  
, . Onay partly indeed be applied towards comple­  
ting the&quot; defence of the exposed points of our  
Country, on SochAa scale as vhallbe adapted  
, to our principles and circumstances7 . Thisob-Ji-  
jeci is doubtless among the first entitled to at­  
tentiojiin such a state of bur finances,&quot; and it  
v is one which, whethcrrve have. peace or war,  
i. will- provide security where it is due. Whc­

lions and an half in the treasury at the be­

meeting the cur rent demands and interest

To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States.  
CIRCUMSTANCES, Fellow-Citizens, which ferioufly threaten­  
ed the peace of the country, have made it a duty to convene  
you at an earlier period than ufual. The love of peace, fo much cherifh­  
ed in the bofom of our citizens, which had fo long guided the proceedings  
of thtir councils, and induced forbearance under fo many wrongs, may  
not infure our continuance in the quiet purfuits of induftry. The many  
in’u&#x27;-ies and depredations committed on our commerce and navigation up­  
on toe high feas, for years paft, the fucceflive innovations on the princi­  
ph-s of pubfc law, which have been eftabbfhed by the reafon Sc ufage of na­  
t&#x27;-on&gt;, as the rule of their intercourfe, and the umpire and fecurity of their  
rights and peace, and all the circumftances which induced the extraordi­  
nary million to London, are already known to you. The inftru&amp;icns  
given to our mimfters were in the fincereft fpirit of amity and moderation.  
Fhey accordingly proceeded, in conformity therewith, to propofe arrange­  
ments which might embrace and fettle all the points in difference between  
us, which might bring us to a mutual underftanding on our neutral and  
national rights, and provide for a commercial intercourfe on conditions of  
I time equality. After long and fruitlefs endeavors to effect the purpofe of  
their million, and obtain arrangements within the limits of their inftru&amp;i­  
ons, they concluded to fign fuch as could be obtained, and to fend them  
for confideration, candidly declaring to their other negociators that they  
were a£tmg againft their inftru&amp;ions, and that their government therefore,  
could not be pledged for ratification. Some of the articles propofed might  
have been admitted on a principle of compromife, but others were too  
highly disadvantageous, and no fufliciem provifion was made againft the  
principal fource of the irritations and collifions which were conftantly en­  
dangering the peace of the two nations. The queftion therefore whether  
a lreaty fhould be accepted in that form, could have admitted but of one  
decifioti, even had no declaration of the other party impaired our confi­  
dence in it. Still anxious not to clofe the door againft friendly adjuft­  
ment, new modifications were framed, and further conceffions authorifed,  
than could before have been fuppofed neceflary, and our minifters were  
inilruifted to relume their negociations on thofe grounds.  
  
con this new reference to amicable dilcuiiion, we were repohng in  
confidence, when, on the ‘&#x27;d day of June laft, by a formal order from a  
Britifh admiral, the frigate Chefapeake, leaving her port for a diftant fer­  
vice, was attacked bv one of thofe veilels which had been lying in our  
harbors under the indulgences of hofpitality, was difabled from proceed­  
ing, had fevera! of her crew killed, and four taken away. On this out­  
rage no commentaries are neceflary. Its chara&amp;er has been prononneed  
by the indignant voice of our citizens with an emphalis and unanimity ne­  
ver exceeded. I immediately by Proclamation interditted our harbors and  
waters to all Britifh armed veflels, forbade intercourfe with them, and, un­  
certain how far hoftilities were intended, and the town of Norfolk indeed  
being threatened with immediate attack, a fufficient force was ordered for  
the prote&amp;ion of that place, and fuch other preparations commenced and  
purfued as the profpecl rendered proper. An armed veflel of the United  
States was difpatched with inftru&amp;ions to our minifters at London to call  
on that government for the fatisfj&amp;ion and fecuriry required by the out­  
rage. A very fhort interval ought now to bring the anfwer, which fliall  
be communicated to you as foon as received ; then alfo, or as foon after  
as the public mterefts Iliad be found to admit, the unratified treaty, and  
proceedings relative to it, {hall be made known to you.  
I he aggreflions thus begun, has been continued on the part of the  
Britifh commanders, by remaining within our waters in defiance of the  
authority of the country,by habitual violations of its jurifdicfion, and at  
length by putting to death one of the perfon whom they had forcebly ta­  
ken irom nn board the Chcfapeakc. Thefe aggreflions neceflarily lead to  
the policy either of never admitting an armed vefl&#x27;el into our harbours, or  
of ma ntaining in every inch harbour, fuch an armed force as may conftrain  
obedience to the laws, find proteft the lives and property of our citizens  
ygainft their armed guefls j but the expenfe of fuch a Banding force, and  
us inconiiftcnce with our principles, difpenfe with thofe courteiies which  
woul ! neceflarily call for it, and leave us equally free to exclude the navy  
as we do the army of a foreign power, from entering our limits.  
  
lo tormer violations of maritime rights, another is now added of very  
exter.five eurct. The gov rnment of that nation has iffued an order in­  
terdicting ad trade by neutrals between ports not in amity with them, and  
ei ig now at war with nearly every nation on the Atlantic and Mediter­  
ranean leas, our veffols are required to facrefice their cargoes at the firft  
port they touch, or to returu home without the benefit of going to any  
other market. Under the new law of the ocean, our trade on the Medi­  
terranean has been fwept away by feizures and condemnations, and that  
in other Teas is threatened with the fame fate.  
Our differences with Spain remains dill unfettled, no meafure having  
been taken on her part, fince my lad communications to Congrefs, to bring  
them to a ciofe. But undtr a date of things, which may favor reconfid­  
cration, they have been recently preffed, and an expectation is entertained  
that they may now foon be brought to an iffue of fome fort. Witlitheir fub­  
iects on our borders, no new collifions have taken place, nor feem imme­  
diately to be apprehended. To our former grounds of complaint has  
been added a very ferious one, as you will fee by the decree, a copy of  
which is now communicated. Whether this decree, which profeffes to be  
conformable to that of the French government of Nov. 21, 1806, hereto­  
fore communicated to Congrefs, will alfo be conformed to that in its con­  
friudion and application in relation the United States had not been af­  
certained at the date of our lad communications. Thefe, however, gave  
reafon to expetft fuch a conformity.  
With the other nations of Europe, ©ur harmony lias&#x27;been uriinter­  
•upted, and commerce aud friendly intercourfe have been maintained on  
dirir ufuai footing;  
Our peace with the feveral dates cn the coad of Barbary appears as  
irm as at any former period, and as likely to continue as that of any oth­  
:r nation.  
Among otir Indian nflghbours, in the north wedern quarter, fome  
ermentation was obferved foon after the late occurrences jthreatening the  
ontmuance of our peace. MefTges were faid to be interchanged, and to­  
:ens to be paffing, which ufually denote a date of redleffnefs among  
h:m, and the character of the agitators pointed to the fourcs of excite­  
ent;—meafures were immediately taken for providing aga&#x27;.nd that dang rj  
ilrruidions were given to require explanations, and, with affuranccs of  
ur continued frirndfhip, to admdnifh the tribes to remain quiet at home,  
1  
  
-- ..-.--- ..  
taking no part in quarrels not belonging to them. As far as we are yet  
informed the tribes in our vicinity, who are mod advanced in the pursuits  
of induftry, are fincerely difpofed to adhere to their friendfhip with us,  
and to their peace with all others. While thofe more ren.6re, do not  
prefent appearances fufficicntly quiet to juftify the intcrmiflion of military  
precaution on our part.  
The great tribes on our fouth weflern quarters nrmch advanced beyond  
the others in agriculture and houfehold arts, appear tranquil and inden­  
tifying their views with ours in proportion to their advancements. With  
th** whole of thefe people in every quarter, I lhall continue to inculcate  
peace and friendfhip with all their neighbours, and perfeverance in thofe  
occupations and purfuits which will beft promote their own well being.  
The appropriations of the laft feflion, for the defence of our fea port  
towns, and harbours, were made under expectation that a continuance of  
our peace would permit us to proceed in that work according to our conve­  
nience. It has been thought better fo apply the fum then given towards  
the defence of New York, Charlefton and New Orleans chiefly, as mofi  
open and mod likely firft to need protection, and leave places lei&#x27;s immedi­  
ately in danger to the provifions of the prefent feflion  
The gun boats too already provided, have, on alike principle, been,  
chiefly afligned to New York, Ne\v*Orleans, and the Chefapcake.—  
Whether our moveable force on the watery fo material in aid ofdiede­  
fenfive works on the land, fhould be augmented in this or any other form,  
as left to the wifdom of the legiflature. For the purpofe of manning  
thefe veflels, in fudden attacks on our harbours, it is a matter for confid­  
eration whether the feamen of the United States may not juftly be formed  
into a fpecial militia, to be called on for tours of duty, in defence of tFe  
harbours where they lhall happen to be, the ordinary militia of the pk e  
furnilhing that portion which may confift oflandfmen.  
The moment our peace was threatened, I deemed it indifpenfible to  
fecure a great portion of thofe articles of military ftores, with which cur  
magazines were not fuffleientiy furnilhed ; to have awaited a previous an  
fpecial fanCiion of law, would have loft occafions which might not be re­  
trieved. I did not hefitate, therefore, to authorize engagements for fucli  
fupplements to our exifting ftock, as would render it adequate to the  
emergencies threatning us ; and I truft that the legiflature, feeling the  
fame anxiety for the fafety of our country fo materially advanced by this  
precaution, will approve when done, what thev would have feen fo impor­  
  
tant to be done, if then affembled. Expences, alfo, unprovided for, arofe  
out of the necefiity of cal ing cur gun boats into actual fervice, for  
the defence of our harbours, of all which accounts will be laid before vou.  
Whether a regular army is to be raifed, and to what extent, muff  
depend on the information fo fhortly expe&amp;ed. In the mean time, I have  
called on the ftates for quotas of militia to be in readinefs For prefent de­  
fence ; and have moreover, encouraged the acceptance of volunteers; and  
I am happy to inform you, that thefe haVe offered themfelves with great  
alacrity in every part of the union ; they are ordered to be organized, and  
ready at a moment’s warning, to proceed on any fervice to which the)r  
may be called, and every preparation within the executive powers, has been,  
madetoenfure us the benefit of early exertions.  
I iNFORMEb Congrefs at their laft feffion, of the enterprizes againft the  
public peace, which were believed to be in preparation by Aaron lkrr and  
his affociates, of the meafures taken to defeat them, and to bring the offen­  
ders tojuftice ; their enterprizes were happily defeated, by the patriotic  
exertions of the militia, wherever called into aftion, by the fidelity of the  
army, and energy of the commander in chief, in promptly arranging the  
many difficulties prefenting themfelves on the Sabine, repairing to meet  
thofe arifing en the Miffilippi, and diffipating, before their exploflon, plots  
engendering there. I ffiait think it my dnty to lay before you the proceed­  
ings &amp; the evidence publicly exhibited on the arraignment of the principal  
offenders before the diftridf court of Virginia, you will be enabled to judge  
whether the deftft was in the teftimony, in the law, or in the adminiftratioil  
of the law ; and wherever it ffiall be found, the iegiflature alone can apply  
or originate the remedy. The framers cf our conftirution certainly fup­  
pofu4 they nad guarded, as well as their government againft deftru&lt;ffon by  
treafon, as their citizens againft oppreffion under pretence of it ; and if  
there ends are not attained, it is of importance to enquire by what means  
more effectually, they may be fecured.  
  
The accounts of receipts of revenue during the year on the 30th day  
of September laft, being not yet made up, $ correct fUtemem will be  
herealler transmitted from the treafury, in the&#x27;mean time it is afeeruined  
that the receipts have amounted to near fixteen millions of dollars, which,  
with the five millions and a haif in the treafury at the beginning of the  
yeir, have enabled us, after meeting the current demands, and intereft in­  
curred, to pay more than four millions of the principal of our funded  
debt-Thefe payments, with thofe of the preceding five and a half  
years, have extinguished of the Funded debt twenty-five millions and a  
half of dollars, being the whole which could be paid or purchafcd within  
the limits of the law, and of out* Contracts, and have left us in the treafury  
tight millions and a half of dollars. A portion of this (urn may be con­  
fidered as a commencement of accumulation of the furplulfes of revenue,  
which, after paying the inftallments of debt as they (hail become payable,  
will remain without any fpecific object. It may partly, indeed, be applied  
towards compleating the defence of the expofed points 01 our country, on  
fuch a Icale as (lrall be adapted to our principles and circumftances.  
This object is, doubtlefs, among tile firft entitled to attention, in furh  
n ftate of our finances 5 and it is one which, whether we have peace or wnr.  
will provide fecurity where it is due. Whether what (hall remain of this*  
with the future furpluiles may be tlfefuMy applied to pnrpofei already tu­  
thorired, or more ufeful to ethers requiring new authorities, or how other­  
wife they (hall be dilpofed of, are qutftions calling for the notice c4 Con­  
crete : unlefs indeed they (hall be fujierceded by a change in cur public re­  
lations, now awaiting the determination of orhers. Whatever be that dc- ,  
termination, it is a great confolation that it will become known it a mo­  
ment when the fupreme council of the nation 1 afi&#x27;embied at its pod, and  
readv to give the aids of its wifdom and authority to whatever con; fe th*s  
good of the nation lhall then call us to pitriae.  
Matters of minor importance will be the fubjeff of future comp u­  
nications ; and nothing (hall be wanting on my part which may giveirffor­  
mation or difpatch to the proceeding-* of the legiflaturcj in the exercife of

ty and moderation. ‘They accordingly pro-  
ceeded, in conformity. therewith, to pro-

tercourse on conditionsof some equality.  
After long and fruitless endeavors to effect  
the purposes of their mission, and to ob-  
tain arrangements within the limits of their  
instructions, they concluded to sign such  
as could be obtained, and to send them for  
consideration, candidly declaring to the  
other negociators, at the same time, that  
they were acting against their instructions,  
and that their government therefore could  
not be pledged for ratification—Some of  
the articles proposed might have been ad-  
mitted on a principle of compromise, “but  
others were too highly disadvante-ecous,  
and no sufficient provision was made wyainst  
the principal source of the irritations and  
collisions which were, constantly endanger-

[’ll their neighbours, and perseverance  
in those occupations and pursuits which  
will best promote their own well-being.  
The appropriations of the last session,  
toi the defence of our seaport towns and  
harbours, were made under expectations  
that a continuance of our peace would  
permit us to proceed in that work ac­  
cording to our convenience. It has  
b..cn thought better to apply the sums  
dun giv n,towards the defence of New­  
i oi k, Charleston, and New-Orleans,  
cniefly, as most open and most likely  
•iist to need protection, and to leave  
peaces less immediately in danger to the  
provisions of the present session.  
1 he gun-boats too, already provided,  
have on a like principle been chiefly as­  
signed to N ew-York, New-Orleans and  
the Chesapeake. W heiherour moveable  
fotce on the water, so material in aid of  
the defensive works on the land, should  
be augmented in this or any other form,  
is led to the wisdom of the legislature.  
I&#x27;or the purpose of manning these ves­  
^t&#x27;l‘‘&gt; hi sudden attacks on our harbours,  
It a matter for consideration whether  
tno seamen cl the United States may  
iioc justly be formed into a special mili­  
tia, to be called on for tours of duty in  
defence of the liar! ours where they shall  
happen to he ; the ordinary militia of  
f iic place furnishing that portion which  
•tilav consist of landsmen.  
  
i he moment our peace was threaten­  
d, I deemed it nidisp-. usable to secure  
a greater provision ot* those articles ol  
military st u*es, with which our maga­  
zines were not sufficiently furnished: to  
have .awaited a pre\icus and special  
sanction oy law, would have lost occa­  
sions which might not be retrieved. 1  
did not hesitate, tlun fore, to authorise  
engagements for su&lt; h supplemnts to  
our existing stock, as would render it a­  
dequate to the emergencies threatening  
us ; and I trust that the legislature, feel­  
ing the same anxLty for the safety o!  
our country, so materially advanced In­  
dus precaution, will approve when-done,  
what they would have seen so important  
to be done if then assembled. Expenses,  
also unprovided for, arose out of the  
necessity of calling all our gun-boats  
into actual service, fertile defence of  
our harbours, of all which accounts will  
he laid before von.  
Whether a regular army is to be rnis­  
&#x27;vl, and to what extent, must depend on  
the information so shortly expected. In  
the mean time I have called o.&#x27; the states  
for quotas of miiitfa, to be in readiness  
  
ior present defence ; and have, moreo­  
ver, encouraged the acceptance of vo­  
lunteers, and I am happy to inform you  
that these have offered themselves with  
great alacrity in every part of the union;  
they are ordered to be organized, and  
ready at a moment’s warning to proceed  
on any service to which they may he  
called, and every preparation within the  
executive powers has been made to in­  
sure ua the benefit of early exertions.  
1 informed congress at their last ses­  
sion, of the enterprises against the pub­  
lic peace, which were believed to be in  
preparation by Aaron Burr and his asso­  
ciates ; of the measures taken to defeat  
them, and to bring the offenders to jus­  
tice. 1 heir enterprises were happily cle­  
*e‘ltt&#x27;d» bv the patriotic exertions of the  
militia, wherever called into action ; by  
the fidelity of the army, and energy of  
the commander in chief in promptly ar­  
ranging tbs difficulties presenting them­  
selves on the Sabine, repairing to meet  
those arising on the Mississippi, and  
dissipating, before their explosion, plots  
engendering there. I shall think it inv  
  
duty to lay before you the proceedings  
and the evidence publicly exhibited on  
the1 arraignment ot the principal offen­  
ders before the district court of&#x27; Virgi­  
nia. ^ ou av 111 be enabled to judge whe­  
ther the defect was in the testimony, in  
the law, or in the administration of the  
law; and wherever it shall be found, the  
legislature alone can apply or originate  
die remedy. The framers of our con­  
stitution certainly supposed they had  
guarded as well the ir government against  
destruction by treason, as their-citizens  
against oppression under pretence of it;  
and it these ends are not attained, it is  
of importance to inquire by what means  
mere effectually they may be secured.  
flic :kc unts ol the receipts of reve­  
nue during the t ear ending on the 30th  
day ol September last, being not yet  
nr.de up, a correct statement will be  
heivaft r tra ismitted from the treasury;  
in the n ea i time it is ascertained that  
the reci ip s have amounted to near six­  
teen millions of dollars, which, with the  
live millions and a half in the treasury  
at the beginning of the year, have ena­  
bled ns, altf r meeting the current de­  
mands and interest incurred, to pav more  
than lour millions of the principal of our  
funded debt. These payments, with  
those of the preceding five and a half  
years, have extinguished of the funded  
debt twenty-five millions and a half of  
dollars, bciug the whole which could be  
  
be paul or purchased within the limits  
die \aw and °f our contracts, and have  
left us in the treasury eight millions and  
an half of dollars. A portion of this sum  
may he considered as a commencement  
of accumulation of the surplusses of re­  
venue, which, after paying the instal- *  
nicnts ol debt as they shall become pay­  
able, will remain without any sped hole  
object. It may partly, indeed, be appli­  
ed towards completing the defence ol  
the exposed points of our country, cri  
such a scale as shall be adapted to  
our principles and circumstances.­  
This object is doubtless among the first  
entitled to attention, in such a state of  
our finances ; and it is one which, whe­  
ther we have peace or war, will provide  
security where it is due. Whether what  
shall remain of this, with the future sur­  
plusses, may be usefully applied to pur­  
poses already authorized, or more use­  
fully tq others requiring new authori­  
ties, or how otherwise they shall be dis­  
posed of, are questions calling for the  
notice of congress : unless indeed thev  
  
shall be superceded by a change in our  
public relations now awaiting ahe_ deter­  
mination oi others. Whatever be that  
determination, it is a great consolation  
that it will become known at the mo­  
ment when the supreme council of the  
nation is assembled at its post, and ready  
to give the aids oi its wisdom and au­  
thority to what course the good of our  
country shall then call us to pursue.  
Matters of minor importance will be  
the subject of future communications ;  
and nothing shall be wanting on my part,  
which may give information or dispatch  
to the proceedings of the legislature, in  
the exercise of their high duties, and at  
a moment so interesting to the public  
welfare.

To the Senate and House of  
Representatives of the United States.  
  
CIRCUMSTANCES, fellow citizens, which seriously threatened the peace  
of our country, have made it a duty to convene you at an earher period than  
usual. The love of peace so much cherished in the bosom of our citizens, which  
has so long guided the procecdings of their councils, and induced forbearance  
under so many wrong’s,may not ensure our continuance in the quiet pursuits of  
industry. The many injuries and depredations committed on our commerce &amp;  
navigation upon the high seas, for years past,the successive innovations on those  
principles of publick law, which have been established by the reason and usage  
of nations, as the rule of their intercourse, and the umpire and security of their  
rights and peace, and all the circumstances which induced the extraordinary  
mission to London, are already known to you. The instructions given to our  
ministers were framed in the sincerest spirit of amity and moderation —  
They accordingly proceeded, in conformity therewith, to propose arrange-  
ments which might embrace and settle all the points in difference be-  
tween us; which might bring us to a mutual understanding on our neutral  
and national rights, and provide for a commercial intercourse on conditions  
ot some equality. After long and fruitless endeavours to effect the purposes  
of their mission, and to obtain arrangements within the limits of their  
instructions, they concluded to sign such as could be obtained and to send  
them for consideration, candidly declaring to the other negociators at  
the same time, that they were acting against their instructions, and  
that their government therefore could not be pledged for ratification.  
Some of the articles proposed might have been admitted on a principle  
of compromise, but others were too highly disadvantageous,and no sufficient  
provision was made against the principal source of the irritations and collisions  
which were constantly endangering the peace of the two nations. The ques-  
tion therefore, whether a treaty should be accepted in that form, could have  
admitted but of one decision,even had nu declarations of the other party im-  
paired our confidence init. Still anxious not to close the door against friend -  
ly adjustments, new modifications were framed, and further concessions au-  
thorised, than could before have been supposed necessary, and our ministers  
were instructed to resume their negociations on these grounds.  
  
On this new reference to amicable discussion,we were reposing in confi-  
dence, when on the 22d day of June last, by a formal order from a British  
admiral, the frigate Chesapeake, leaving her port for a distant service, was  
attacked by one of those vessels which bad been lying in our harbours under  
the indulgences of hospitality, was disabled from proceeding, had several of  
her crew killedjand four taken away.—On this outrage no commentaries are  
necessary. Its character has been pronounced by the indignant voice of our  
citizens with an emphasis and unanimity never exceeded. I immediately  
by proclamation interdicted our harbours and. waters to all British armed  
vessels, forbade intercourse with them, and, uncertain how far hostilities were  
intended, and the town of Norfolk being indeed threatened with immediate a

68 AMERICAN STATE’ PAPERS.  
  
tack, a sufficient force was ordered for the protection of that place, and such  
other preparations commenced and pursued as the prospect rendered proper .  
An armed vessel of the United States was dispatched with instructions to  
our ministers at London to call on that government for the satisfaction and  
security required by the outrage. A very short interval ought now to bring  
the answer, which shall be communicated to you as soon as received : then  
also, or as soon after as the publick interests shall be found to admit, the un-  
ratified treaty and proceedings relative to it, shall be made known to you.  
  
The aggression thus begtn,has been continued on the part of the British com-  
manders by remaining. within our waters in defiance of the authority of the  
country, by habitual violations of its jurisdiction, and atlength by putting to  
death one of the persons whom they had forcibly taken from on board theChes-  
apéake. These aggravations necessarily lead to the policy either of never ad-  
mitting an armed vessel into our harbours, or of maintaining in every harbour  
such an armed force as may costrain obedience to the laws, and protect the  
lives and property of our citizens against their armed guests ; but the expense  
  
‘of such a standing force, and its inconsistency with our principles, dispense  
with those courtesies which would necessarily call for it,and leave us equally  
free to exclude the navy as we are the army of a foreign power,from enter-  
ing our limits.  
  
To former violations of maritime rights another is now added of very exten-  
sive effect. The government of that nation has issued an order interdicting all  
trace by neutrals between ports not in amity with them, and being now at  
war with nearly every nation on the Atlantic and Mediterranean seas, our  
vessels are required to sacrifice their cargoes at the first port they touch, or  
to return home without the benefit of going to any other market. Under  
this new law of the ocean, our trade on the Mediterranean has been swept  
away by seizures and condemnations, and that in other seas is threatned with  
the same fate.  
  
Our differences with Spain remain still unsettled, no measure having been  
tz.gen on her part, since my last communications to Congress, to bring them  
to a close.—But under a state of things, which may favour reconsideration,  
they have been recently pressed, and an expectation is entertained that they  
may now soon be brought to an issue of some sort. With their subjects on  
our borders, no new collisions have taken place, nor seem immediately to  
be apprehended. To our former grounds of complaint has been added a very  
serious one, as you will see by the decree, a copy of which is now communi -  
cated. Whether this decree, which professes to be conformable to that of  
the French government of Nov. 21, 1806, heretofore communicated to Con-  
gress, will also be conformed to that in its construction and application in re-  
lation to the United States, had not been ascertained at the date of our last  
communications. These, however, gave reason to expect such a conformity.  
  
With the other nations of Europe, our harmony has been uninterrupted,  
and commerce and friendly intercourse have been maintained on their usual  
footing.  
  
. oe pee with the several states on the coast of Barbary appears as firm as  
at any former period, and as likely to continue as that of any other nation.  
  
Among our Indian neighbours, in the north-western quarter, some fermen-  
tation was observe soon after the late occurrences threatning the continuance  
of our peace. Messages were said to be interchanged, and tokens to be pas-  
sing, which usually denote a state of restlessness among them, and the char -  
acter of the agitators pointed to the sources of excitement ;+measures were  
immediately taken for providing against that danger ; instructions were  
given to require explanations,and, with assurances of our continued friendship,  
to admonish the tribes to remain quiet at home, taking. no part in quarrels  
not belonging to them. As far as we are yet informed,the tribes in our viein-

ity, who are most advanced in the pursuits of industry,are sincerely disposed  
to adhere to their friendship with us, and to their peace with all others;  
while those, more remote, do not present appearances sufficiently quiet to  
justify the intermission of military precaution on our part.  
  
The great tribes on our south-western quarter,much advanced beyond the  
others in agriculture and houshold arts, appear tranquil and identifying their  
views with ours in proportion to their advancement. With the whole of  
these people in every quarter,I shall continue to inculcate peace and friendship  
with all their neighbours, and perseverance in those occupations and pur-  
suits which will best promote their own well being.  
  
The appropriation of the last session for the detence of our seaport towns  
and harbours, were made under expectation that a continuance of our peace  
would permit us to proceed in that work according to our convenience. It  
has been thought better to apply the sum then given towards the defence of  
New-York, Charleston, and New-Orleans chiefiy, as most n and most  
likely first to need protection, and to leave places less immediately in danger  
to the provisions of the present session.  
  
The gun-boats already provided have,on a like principle,been chiefly assigned  
to New-York,New-Orleans and the Chesapeake. Whether our moveable force  
on the water, so material in aid of the defensive works on the land, should  
be augmented in this or any other form, is left to the wisdom of the legis-  
lature. For the purpose of manning these vessels in sudden attacks on our  
harbours, it is a matter for consideration whether the seamen of the United  
States may not justly be formed into a special militia, to be called on for tours  
of duty, in defence of the harbours where they shall happen to be, the ordina-  
ry militia of the place furnishing that portion which may consist of lands-  
men.  
  
The moment our peace was threatened I deemed it indispensible to secure a  
greater provision of those articles of military stores, with which our magazines  
were not sufficiently furnished. To have awaited a previous and special sanc-  
tion by law, would have lost occasions which might notbe retrieved. I did  
not hesitate, therefore,to authorise engagements for such supplements to our  
existing stock, as would render it adequate to the emergencies threatening  
us; and I trust that the legislature,feeling the same anxiety for the safety of our  
country so materially advanced by this precaution, will approve, when done,  
what they would have seen so important to be done, if then assembled.—Ex-  
penses,also unprovided for,arose out of the necessity of calling all our gun-boats  
into actual service for the defence of our harbours,of all which accounts will  
be laid before you. .  
  
Whether a regular army is to be raised, and to what extent, must depend  
on the information so shortly expected. In the mean time, I have called on  
the states for quotas of militia to be in readiness for present defence ; and  
have moreover, encouraged the acceptance of volunteers ; and I am happy  
to inform you,that these have offered themselves with great alacrity in every  
part of the union ; they are ordered to be organized, and ready at a mo-  
ment’s warning, to proceed on any service to which they may be called,and  
every preparation within the executive powers, has been made to ensure us  
_ the benefit of early exertions.

publick peace, which were believed to be in preparation by Aaron Burr and  
his associates, of the measures taken to defeat them, and to bring the offen-  
ders to justice : their enterprizes were happily defeated by the patriotic ex-  
ertions of the militia, wherever culled into action, by the fidelity of the army  
and energy of the commander in chief, in promptly arranging the diffi-  
culties presenting themselves on the Sabine, repairing to meet those arising

on the Mississippi, and dissipating, before their explosion, plots engendering  
there. Ishall think it my duty to lay before you the proceedings and the  
evidence publicly exhibited on the arraignment of the principal offenders be-  
fore the district court of Virginia. You will be enabled to judge whether the  
defect was in the testimony, in the law, or in the administration of the  
law : and whereverit shall be found,the legislature alone can apply or origin-  
ate the remedy. The framers of our constitution certainly supposed they  
had guarded, as welltheir government against destruction by treason, as  
their citizens against oppression under pretence of it ; and if these ends are  
not attained, it is of importance to inquire by what means more effectually  
they may be secured.  
  
The accounts of the receipts of revenue during the year ending on the  
30th day of September last, being not yet made up, a correct statement will  
be hereafter transmitted from the treasury,in the mean time it is ascertained  
that the receipts have amounted to nearly sixteen millions of dollars, which,  
with the 5 millions and an half in the treasury at the beginning of the year,  
have enabled us, after meeting the current demands,and interest incurred,to  
pay more than four millions ef the principal of our funded debt. These  
payments, with those of the preceding five and an half years, have extin-  
guished of the funded debt twenty-five millions and a halfof dollars,being the  
whole which could be paid or purchased within the limits of the law, and of  
our contracts, and have left us in the treasury 8 millions and a half of dollars.  
A portion of this sum may be considered as a commencement of accumu-  
lation of the surplusses of revenue, which, after paying the instalments of  
debt,as they shall become payable,will remain without any specifick object.  
It may partly, indeed, be applied towards compleating the defence of the  
exposed points of our country jon such a scale as shall be adapted to our  
principles and circumstances.  
  
This object is, doubtless, among the first entitled to attention, in such a  
state of our finances : and it is one which, whether we have peace or war,  
will provide security where it is due. Whether what shall remain of this,  
with the future surplusses,may be usefully applied to purposes already autho-  
rised or more usefully to others requiring new authorities, or how otherwise  
they shall be disposed of,are questions calling for the notice of Congress : un-  
less indeed they shall be superseded by a change in our publick relations,now  
awaiting the determination of others. Whatever be that determination, it is  
a great consolation that it will become known at a moment when the su-  
preme council of the nation is assembled at:its post, and ready to give the  
aids of its wisdom and authority to whatever course the good of our country  
shall then call us to pursue.  
  
Matters of minor importance will be the subject of future communications ;  
and nothing shall be wanting on my part, which may give information or dis-  
patch to the proceedings of the legislature in the exercise of their high du-  
ties, and at a moment so interesting tothe publick welfare.

AMERICA. Message of the President of

our citizens, which had so long guided the  
proceedings of their public councils, and in-  
duced forbearance under so many wrongs,  
may not insure our continuance in the quiet  
pursuits of industry. ‘The many injuries  
and depredations committed on our com-  
merce and navigation on the high seas, for  
years past; the successive innovations on  
those principles of public law, which have  
been established by the reason and usage of  
nations, as the rule of their intercourse, and  
the umpire and security of their rights and  
peace ; and ali the circumstances which in«  
duced the extraordinary mission to London,  
are already known to you. The instructions  
given to our ministers were framed in the  
sincerest spirit of amity and moderation,  
They accordingly proceeded, in conformity  
therewith, to propose arrangements which  
might embrace and settle all the points in  
ditterence between us, which might jbring  
us to a mutual understanding en our neutrak  
and national rights, ard provide for a com-  
mercial intercourse on conditions of some  
equality. After long and fruitless endea-  
vours to effect the purposes of their mission,  
and to obtain arrangements within the limits  
of their instractions, they concluded to sigu  
such as could be obtained, and to send them  
for consideration, candidly declaring to the  
other negociators, that they were acting  
against their instructions, and that their go-  
vernment, therefore, coald not be pledged  
for ratification, Some of the articles»pro-  
posed migbt have been admitted on a prin-  
ciple.of compromise; but others were too  
highly disadvantageous ; and no sufticient  
provision was made against the principal  
source of the irritations and collisions which  
were constantly endangering the peace of  
two nations. Theguestion, therefore; whee  
ther a treaty should be accepted in that form,  
  
could have admitted but of one decision,  
  
even had no declaration of the other party  
impaired our confidence in if. Still anx-  
ious not to close the door against friendly  
  
| adjustment, new moditicutions were framed,  
  
  
  
  
  
and further concessions authorised, than  
could betore have been supposed necessary’,  
and our ministers were instructed to resume  
their negociations on those grounds.——~-On  
this new reference to amicable discussion,  
we were reposing in confidence, when; .on  
the 22d day of June last, by a formal order  
from a British admiral, the frigate Chesa-  
peake, leaving her port for a distaut service,  
was attacked by one of those vessels which  
had been lying in our karbours under the  
indulgences of hospitality, was disabled from  
proceeding, had several of ber crew killed,

and four taken away. On this outrage no  
commentaries are necessary.  
  
of our citizens, with an emphasis, an unani-  
mity never exceeded. I immediately, by  
proclamation, interdicted our harbours and  
waters to all British armed vessels, forbade  
intercourse with them; and uncertain how  
far hostilities were intended, and the town  
of Norfolk indeed being threatened with im-  
mediate attack, a sufficient force was ordered  
for the protection of that place, and such  
other preparations commenced and pursued  
as the prospect rendered proper. Anarmed  
vessel of the U. States was dispatched with  
instructions to our ministers at London, to  
eall on that government for the satisfaction  
and security required by the outrage. A  
very short interval ought now to bring the  
answer, which shall be communicated to you  
as soon as received; then also, or as soon  
after as the public interests shall be found to  
admit, the unratified treaty, and proceedings  
relative to it, shall be made Known to you.  
—The aggression, thus begun, has been con-  
tinued on the part of the British command-  
ers, by remaining within our waters, in de-  
fiance of the authority of the country, by  
habitua! violations of its jurisdiction, and at  
length by putting to death one of the persons  
whom they had forcibly taken from on board  
the Chesapeake. These aggravations neces-  
sarily lead to the policy either of never  
admitting an armed vessel into our har-  
bours, or of maintaining in every harbour  
such an armed force as may constrain : be-  
dience to the laws, and protect the lives and  
property of our citizens against their armed  
guests; but the expense of such a standing  
force, and its inconsistence with our princi-  
ples, dispense with those courtesies which  
would necessarily call for it, and leave us  
equally free to exclude the navy, as we are  
the arniy of a foreign power, from entering  
our limits. ‘To former violations of mari-  
time rights, another is now added of very  
extensive effect, The government of that  
nation has issued an order interdicting all  
trade by neutrals between ports not in ami-  
ty with them; and being now at war with  
nearly every nation on the Atlantic and Me-  
diterranean seas, our vessels are required to  
sacrifice their cargues at the first port they  
touch, or to return home without the benefit  
of going to any other market. Under this  
new law of the ocean, our trade on the Me-  
diterranean has been swept away by seizures  
and condemnations, and that on other seas is  
  
  
  
threatened with the same fate—Our differ-

since ‘my last comimunicétions to Congress,  
to bring them to a close: But under a state  
of things, which may favour re-considera-  
tion, they have been. recently pressed, and  
an expectation is entertained they may now  
soon be brought to an issue of some sort,  
With their subjects on our borders, no new  
collisions have taken place, nor seem imme.  
diately to be apprehended. To our former  
ground of complaints has been added a very  
serions one, as you will see by the decree, a  
copy of which is now communicated. Whe-  
ther this decree, which professes to be con-  
formable to that of the French government  
of Novy. 21, 1806, heretofore communicated  
to Congress, will also be conformed to that  
in its construction and application in relation  
to the United States, had not been ascertain-  
ed at the date of onr last communications.  
These, however, gave reason to expect such  
conformity —With the other nations of Eu-  
rope our harmony has been uninterrupted,  
and commerce and friendly intercourse have  
been maintained on their usual footing.  
Our peace with the several States on the  
coast of Barbary, appears as firm as at any  
former period, and as likely to continue as  
that of any other nation. —Among our Indian  
neighbours in the North Western ‘quarters,  
some fermentations were observed soon alter  
the late occurrences, threatening the conti-  
nuance of our peace. Messages were said  
to be interchanged, and tokens to be passing,  
which usually denotes a state of restlessness  
among them, and the character of the agita-  
tors pointed to the sources of excitement.  
Measures were immediately taken for pro-  
viding against that danger ; instructions were  
given to require explanations, and with as-  
surances of our continued friendship, to ad-  
monish the tribes to remain quiet at home,  
taking no part in quarrels nof belonging to  
them. As far as we are yet informed, the  
tribes in our vicinity, who are most advauced  
in the pursuits of industry, are sincerely dis  
posed to adhere to their friendship with us,  
and to their peace with all others; while  
those more remote, do not present appear-  
ances sufficiently quiet to justify the inter-  
mission of military precaution on our part.  
The great tribes on our South Western  
quarter, much advanced beyond the others  
in agriculture and household arts, appear  
tranquil, and identifying their views with  
ours in proportion to their advancement.  
With the whole of these people, in every  
quarter, I shall continue to inculcate-peace  
and ftiendship-with all their neighbours, and  
perseverance in those occupations and pur-  
suits which will best promote their own well  
being.—The appropriations, of the last se

sion, for the expence of our sea-port towns  
and harbours, were made under expectation  
that a continuance of our peace would per-  
mit us to proceed in that work according to  
our convenience, It has been thought bet-  
ter toapply the sums then given towards the  
defence of New York, Charlestown, and  
New Orleans, chiefly, as most open and  
most likely first to need protection, and to  
leave places less immediately in danger to  
the provisions of the present session.—The  
gun-boats, too, already provided, have on a  
like principle been chiefly assigned to New  
York, New Orleans, and the Chesapeake.  
Whether our moveable force on the water,  
so material in aid of the defensive works on  
the Jand, should be augmented in this or  
any other form, is left to the wisdom of the  
Jegislature. For the purpose of manning  
these vessels in sudden attacks on our har-  
bours, it is a matter for consideration whe-  
ther the seamen of the United States may  
not justly be formed into a special militia, to  
be called on for tours of duty in defence of  
the harbours, where they shall happen to be,  
the ordinary militia of the place furnishing  
that portion which may consist of landsmen.  
—The moment our peace was threatened, I  
deemed it indispensable to secure a greater  
provision of those articles of military stores,  
with which our magazines were not suffi-  
ciently furnished; to have awaited a pre-  
vious and special sanction by law, would  
have lost occasions which might not be re-  
trieved. I did not hesitate, therefore, to  
authorise engagements for such supplements  
to our existing stock, as would render it  
adequate to the emergencies threatening us ;  
and I trust that the legislature, feeling the  
same anxiety for the safety of our country,  
so materially advanced by this precaution,  
will approve, when done, what they would  
have seen so important to be done, if then  
assembled. Expenses, also unprovided for,  
arose out of the necessity of calling all our  
n boats into actual service, for the defence  
of our harbours, all which accounts will be  
laid before you.— Whether a regular army is  
to be raised, and to what extent, must de-

In the mean time I have called on the States

informed Congress, at their last session, of  
the enterprises against the public peace,  
which were believed to be in preparation by  
Aaron Burr and his associates, and of the  
measures taken to defeat them, and to bring  
the offenders to justice. Their enterprises  
were happily defeated by the patriotic exer-  
tions of the militia, wherever called into ac-  
tion, by the fidelity of the army, and energy  
of the commander in chief, in promptly ar-  
ranging the difficulties presenting themselves  
on the Sabine, preparing to meet those ari-  
sing on the Mississippi, and dissipating, be-  
fore their explosion, plots engendered there.  
I shall think it my duty to lay before you  
the proceedings and the evidence publicly  
exhibited on the arraignment of the principal  
offenders before the District Court of Virei-  
nia: you will be enabled to judge whether  
the defect was in the testimony, in the Jaw  
or in the administration of the law; eid  
wherever it shall be found, the legislature  
alone can apply or originate the remedy.  
The framers of our coristitution certainly  
supposed they had guarded, as well their go-  
vernment against destruction by treason, as  
their citizens against oppression under pre-  
tence of it; and if these ends are not attain.  
ed, it is of importance to inquire by what  
means more effectually they maybe secured.

demands and I|nterest incurred, to pay mer  
  
than 4 millions of the principal of our funde:

The President goes on to mention, that the differences with Spain remain un-  
settled ; and that symptoms of ferment have appeared among the remote In-  
dians in the North-west. He notices the application of certain appropriations  
of revenue to the defence of New York, Charleston, and New Orléans, and  
hints at further measures of preparation. He alludes to the matter of Aaron  
Burr, and the defeat of the attempts against the public peace ; and concludes  
with a very favourable statement of the public finances.

Message of the President of the Uniteg  
States of America, upon their meeting,  
Oct. 27, 1807.  
  
Circumstances, fellow-citizens, which serious-  
ly threatened the peace of our country, have made  
ita duty to convene you at an earlier period than  
usual. The love of peace, so much cherished in  
the bosom of our citizens, which has so long  
guided the proceedings of their public councils,  
and indueed forbearance under so many wrongs,  
may not insure our continuance in ‘the quiet  
pursuits of industry, The many injuries and de.  
predations committed on our commerce and na-  
vigation upon the high seas for years past, the  
successive innovations on those principles of pub  
lic law which have been established by the reason  
and usage of nations as the rule of their inter-  
course, and the umpire and security of their rights  
and peace, and all the circumstances which in.  
duced the extraordinary Mission to London, are  
already known to you. The instructions given to  
our Ministers were framed in the sincerest spirit of  
amity and moderation. They accordingly pro-  
ceeded, in gonformity therewith, to propose ar-  
rangements which might embrace and settle al]  
the points in difference between us ; which might  
bring us toa mutual understanding on our neutral  
and national rights, and provide for a commer-  
cial intercourse on conditions of some equality.  
After long and fruitless endeavours to effect the  
purposes of their mission, and to obtain arrange-  
ments within the limits of their instructions, they  
concluded to sign such as could be obtained, and  
to send them for consideration ; candidly declar-  
ing to the other negotiators, at the same time,  
that they were acting against their instructions,  
and that their Government therefore could not be  
pledged for ratification. Some of the articles pro-  
posed might have been admitted on a principle of  
compromise, but others were too highly disad-  
vantageous ; and nosufficient provision was made  
against the principal source of the irritations and  
collisions which were constantly endangering the  
peace of the two nations. ‘The question, there-  
fore, whether a treaty should be accepted in that  
form, could have admitted but of one decision,  
  
  
  
  
  
even had no declarations of the other party impair-  
ed our confidence in it. Still anxious not to close  
the door against friendly adjustment, new modi-  
fications were framed, and further concessions  
authorised than could before have been supposed  
necessary: and our Ministers were instructed to  
  
resume their negotiations on these grounds. On  
j §  
  
this new reference to amicable discussion we were  
reposing in confidence, when on the 22d of June  
last, by a forma! order from a British Admiral,  
the frigate Chesapeake, leaving her port for a dis-  
tantservice, was attacked by one of those vessels  
which had¢ been lying in our harbours under the  
indulgences of hospitality, was disabled from pro-  
  
&#x27; ceeding, had several of her crew killed, and four  
| taken away.  
  
On this outrage no commentaries  
  
are necessary. Its character has been pronounced  
  
| by the indignant voice of our citizens with an em-  
  
phasis and unanimity never exceeded. 1 imme-  
  
| diately, by proclamation, interdicted our harbours  
  
and waters to all British armed vessels, forbade in-

Kostilities were intended, and the town of Nor-  
folk indeed being threatened with immediate at-  
tack, a sufficient’force was ordered for the protec-  
tion of that place, and such other preparations  
commenced and pursued as the prospect rendered  
proper. An armed vessel of the United States

thority of the country, by habitual violations of |  
  
its jurisdiction, and at Jensth by putting to death  
one of the persons whom they had forcibly taken  
from on board the Chesapeake. ‘These aggrava-  
tions necessarily lead to the policy, either of  
never admitting an armed vessel into our harbours,  
or of maintaining in every harbour such an armed  
force as may constrain obedience to the laws, and  
protect the lives and property of our citizens against  
heir armed guests. But the expence of sucha  
standing force, and its inconsistence with our  
principles, dispense with those courtesies which  
would necessarily call for it, and leave us equally  
free to exclude the navy, as we are the army, of  
a foreign power from entering our limits.  
  
To former violations of maritime rights,  
another is now added of very extensive effect.  
The Government of that nation has issued an  
Order interdicting all trade by neutrals between  
ports notin amity with then. Amd being now  
at war with nearly every nation on the Atlantic  
and Mediterranean Seas, our vesselsare required to  
sacrifice their cargoes at the first port they touch,  
or to return home without the benefit of going to  
any other market. Under this new law of the  
ocean, our tiade on the Mediterranean has be  
swept away by seizures and condemnations, and  
that in other seas is threatened with the same fate  
  
Our differences withSpain remain still unsettle  
no measure having been taken on her part, since  
my last communications to Congress, to mene  
them to a close. But under a. state of thin  
which may favour re-consideration, they i  
been recently pressed, and an expectation is en-  
tertained that they may now soon be brought to  
an issue of some sort. With their subjects on our  
borders no new collisions have taken place, no  
seem immediately to be apprehended. To our  
former grounds of complaint has been added a  
very serious one, as you will see by the decree, a  
copy of which is now communicated. Whether  
this decree, which professes to be conformable to  
that of the French Government of Nov. 21, 1806,  
heretofore communicated to Congress, will also  
be conformed to that in its construction and ap-  
plication in relation to the United States, had not  
been ascertained at the date of our last communi-  
cations. These, however, gave reason to expect  
such a conformity.  
  
With the other nations of Europe our harmony  
has-been uninterrupted, and commerce and friend-  
ly intercourse have been maintained on their  
usual footing

intermission of military precaution on our part.  
The great tribes on our south-western quarter,  
much advanced beyond the others in agricultural  
and household arts, appear tranquil and identify-  
ing their views with ours, in proportion to their  
advancements. With the whole of these people,

thought better to apply the sums then given

which our’ maga ere not sufficiently fure

sanction by law, would have lost occasions which  
might not be retrieved. I did not hesitate, there-

anxiety for the safety of our country, so mate-  
tially advanced by this precaution, will approve  
when done, what they would have seen so im-  
portant to be done, if then assembled. Expenses,  
also unprovided for, arose out of the necessity of  
calling all our gun-boats into actual service for  
the defence of our harbours, of aj! which accounts  
will be laid before you.  
  
Whether a regular army is to be raised, and to  
what extent, must depend on the information so  
shortly expected. In the mean time I have  
called on the States for quotas of militia to be in  
readiness for present defence ; and have, more-  
ever, encouraged the acceptance of volun-  
teers, and I am happy to inform you, that these  
have offered themselves with great alacrity in  
  
every part of the Union: they are ordered to be |  
  
organized, and ready at a moment&#x27;s warning, to  
proceed on any service to which they may be  
  
called, and every preparation within the execu- |  
  
tive power, has been made to insure us the bencfit  
of early exertions.  
  
I informed Congress at their last session, of  
the enterprises against the public peace, which  
were believed to be in preparation by Aaron Burr  
and his associates, of the measures taken to de-  
feat them, and to bring the offenders to justice.  
Their enterprizes were happily defeated by the  
patriotic exertions of the militia, whenever called  
into action, by the fidelity of the army, and the  
energy of the Commander in Chief, in promptly  
arranging the difficulties presenting themselves on  
the Sabine, repairing to meet those arising on the  
Mississippi, and dissipating before their explosion,  
plots engendering there: I shall think it my  
duty to lay before you the proceedings, and the  
evidence publicly exhibited on the arraignment of  
the principal offenders before the District Court of  
Virginia. You will be enabled to judge whether  
the defect was in the testimony, in the law, or in  
the administration of the law; and wherever it  
shall be found, the Legislature alone can apply or  
originate the remedy. The framers of our con-  
stitution certainly supposed they had guarded, as  
well their government against destruction by  
treason, as their citizens against oppression, under  
pretence of it: and if these ends are not attained,  
it is of importance to enquire by what means,  
moore effectual, they may be secured.  
  
The accounts of the receipts of revenue, during |  
the year ending on the 30th day of September |  
last, being not yet made up, a correct statement |  
will be hereafter transmitted from the ‘Treasury. |  
  
In the mean time it is ascertained thatthe re- |  
ceipts have amounted to near sixteen maillions of |  
dollars ; which, with the five millions and a halfin  
the Treasury at the beginning of the year, have |  
enabled us, after meeting the current demands  
and interest incurred, to pay more than four mil- |  
lions of the principal of our funded debt. These |  
payments, with those of the preceding five and a  
half years, have extinguished of the funded debt, |  
twenty-five millions and a half of dollars, being |  
the whole which could be paid or purchased  
within the limits of the law, and of our contracts,  
and have left us in the Treasury cight millions  
and a half of dollars. A portion of this sum may  
be considered as a commencement of accumula- |  
tion of the surplusses of revenue, which, after  
paying the insialments of debt, as they shall

become payable, will remain without any specific  
object. It may partly, indeed, be applied to-  
wards completing the defence of the exposed  
| points of our country, on such in scale a shall be  
| adapted to our principles and circumstances.  
| This object is doubtless among the first entitled  
| to attention in such a state of our finances, and itis  
one which, wheth.r we have peace or war, will  
| provide security where it is due. Whether what  
; Shall remain of this, with the future surplusses,  
| may be usefully applied to purposes already au-  
| thorised, or more usefully to others requiring  
| new authorities, or how otherwise they shall be  
| disposed of, are questions calling for the notice of  
| Congress: unless, indeed, they shall be super-  
, seded by a change in our public relations, now  
awaiting the determination of others. Whatever  
be that determination, it is a great consolation  
that it will become known at a moment, when  
the Supreme Council of the nation is assembled  
| atits post, and ready to give the aids of its wisdom  
| and authority to whatever course the good of our  
country sha}! then call us to pursue.  
| Matters of minor importance will be the sub-  
jects of future communications; and nothing  
  
shall be wanting on my part which may give  
  
information, in dispatch to the proceedings of the  
| Legislature, at the exercise of their high duties,  
| and in a moment so interesting to the public  
welfare. TH. JEFFERSON

N early twelve months after this notification  
from the British government to our ministers  
in London, this retaliation is made,bnt under  
qualifications that evidently prove that neces­  
sity produced it.  
The government of the U S. in respect to

&quot; Our diﬀer-ences with Spain remain still

her part, since my last communication to con­

and an expectation is entertained that they  
may now soon be brought to an issue of some  
sort. With their subjects on our borders no  
new collisions have taken place ; nor seem
