I received in due time your letter of the 21st Ult. and with due sensibility to the subject of it. Such,  
however, has been the effect of a painful Rheumatism on my general condition, as well in disqualifying my fingers for the  
use of the pen that I could not do justice &quot;to the principles and measures of the Colonization Society in all the great  
and various relations they sustain to our own Country, and to Africa&quot; if my views of them could have the value which your  
partiality supposes I may observe in brief that the Society had always my good wishes tho’ with hopes of its success less  
sanguine than were entertained by others found to have been the better judges; and that I feel the greatest pleasure at  
the progress already made by the society and the encouragement to incounter remaining difficulties afforded by the earlier  
and greater ones already overcome. Many circumstances at the present moment seem to concur in brightening the prospects  
of the Society and cherishing the hope that the time will come when the dreadful calamity which has so long afflicted our  
Country and filled so many with despair will be gradually removed &amp; by means consistent with justice, peace, and the general  
satisfaction: thus giving to our country the full enjoyment of the blessings of liberty and to the world the full benefit  
of its great example. I never considered the main difficulty of the great work as lying in the deficiency of  
emancipations, but in an inadequacy of asylums for such a growing mass of population and in the great expence of removing  
it to its new home. The Spirit of private manumission as the laws may permit and the exiles may consent, is increasing and  
will increase and there are sufficient indications that the public authorities in slave holding States are looking forward  
to interpositions in different forms that must have a powerful effect. With respect to the new abode for the emigrants all  
agree that the choice made by the Society is rendered peculiarly appropriate by considerations which need not be repeated  
&amp; if other Situations should not be found elegible receptacles for a portion of them, the prospects in Africa seem to be  
expanding in a highly encouraging degree.  
In contemplating the pecuniary resources needed for the removal of such a number to so great a distance, my  
thoughts and hopes have been long turned to the rich fund presented in the Western Lands of the Nation which will soon  
entirely cease to be under a pledge for another object. The great one in question is truly of a National Character and it  
is known that distinguished patriots not dwelling in slave holding states have viewed the object in that light and would  
be willing to let the National domain be a resource in effectuating it.  
Should it be remarked that the States tho’ all may be interested in releiving our Country from the Colored  
population they are not equally so, it is but fair to recollect that the sections most to be benefitted are those whose  
sessions created the fund to be disposed of.  
I am aware of the Constitutional obstacle which has presented itself; but if the general will be reconciled  
to an application of the territorial fund to the removal of the colored population, a grant to Congress of the necessary  
authority could be carried, with little delay through the forms of the Constitution. Sincerely wishing increasing success  
to the labors of the Society, I pray you to be assured of my esteem &amp; to accept my friendly salutations

Moyrpe tier, December 29, 1831.  
  
Dear Sir: 1 received, in due time, your letter of the 21st ult. and with  
due sensibility to the subject of it. Such, however, has been the effect  
of a painful rheumatism on my general condition, as well as in disqualifying  
my fingers for the use of the pen, that I could not do justice “to the prin-  
ciples and measures of the Colonization Society in all the great and various  
relations they sustain to our own country and to Africa,” if my views of them  
could have the value which your partiality supposes. I may observe, in  
brief, that the Society had always my good wishes, though with hopes of  
its success less sanguine than were entertained by others found to have  
been the better judges; and, that I feel the greatest pleasure at the pro-  
gress already made by the Society, and the encouragement to encounter  
remaining difficulties afforded by the earlier and greater ones already  
overcome. Many circumstances at the present moment seem to concur  
in brightening the prospects of the Society and cherishing the hope that  
the time will come, when the dreadful calamity which has so long afflicted  
our country and filled so many with despair, will be gradually removed and  
by means consistent with justice, peace and the general satisfaction: thus  
giving to our country the full enjoyment of the blessings of liberty, and  
to the world the full benefit of its great example. I never considered the  
main difficulty of the great work as lying in the deficiency of emancipa-  
tions, but in an inadequacy of asylums for such a growing mass of popu-  
lation, and in the great expense of removing it to itsnew home. The  
spirit of private manumission as the laws may permit and the exiles may  
consent, is increasing and will increase; and there are sufficient indications  
that the public authorities in slave-holding States are looking forward to  
interpositions in different forms that must have a powerful effect. With  
respect to the new abode for the emigrants, all agree that the choice made  
by the Society is rendered peculiarly appropriate by considerations which  
need not be repeated, and if other situations should not be found eligi-  
ble receptacles for a portion of them, the prospects in Africa seem to be  
expanding in a highly encouraging degree.

Mownrrtcier, December 29, 1831.  
  
Dear Sir: I received, in due time, your letter of the 21st ult., and with due sen-  
sibility to the subject of it. Such, however, has been the effect of a painful rheu-  
matism on my general condition, as well as in disqualifying my fingers for the use  
of the pen, that [ could not do justice “‘to the ao and measures of the Colo-  
nization Society in all the great and various relations they sustain to our own ceun-  
try and to Africa,” if my views of them could have the value which your partiality  
supposes. I may observe, in brief, that the Society had always my good wishes,  
though with hopes of its success less sanguine than were entertained by others  
found to have been the better judges; and that I feel the greatest pleasure at the  
  
rogress already made by the Society, and the encouragement to encounter remain-  
ing difficulties afforded by the earlier and greater ones already overcome. Many  
circumstances at the present moment seem to concur in brightening the prospects  
of the Society and cherishing the hope that the time will come, when the dreadful  
calamity which has so long afflicted our country and filled so many with despair,  
will be gradually removed, and by means consistent with justice, peace and the  
general satisfaction: thus giving to our country the full enjoyment of the blessings  
of liberty, and to the world the full benefit of its great example. I never consi-  
dered the main difficu!ty of the great work as lying in the deficiency of emancipa-  
tions, but in an inadequacy of asylums for such a growiag mass of population, and  
in the great expense of removing it to its new home. The spirit of private manu-  
mission, az the laws may permit and the exiles may consent, is increasing and will  
increase; and there are sufficient indications that the public authorities in slave-  
holding States are looking forward to interpositions in different forms that must  
have a powerful effect. With respect to the new abode for emigrants, all agree  
that the choice made by the Society is rendered peculiarly appropriate by consider-  
ations which need not be repeated, and if other situations should not be found eli-  
  
ible receptacles for a portion of them, the prospects in Africa seem to be expand-  
ing in a highly encouraging degree.  
  
Te contemplating the pecuniary resources needed for the removal of such a num-  
ber to so great a distance, my thoughts and hopes have been long turned to the rich  
fund presented in the western lands of the Nation, which will soon entirely cease  
to be — a pledge for another object. The great ove in question is truly of a
