Fashion.  
An humble address has been lately presented to the Prince of Wales by the buckle manufacturers of Birmingham, Wassal, Wolverhampton, and their environs, stating that the buckle trade gives employment to more than twenty thousand persons, numbers of whom, in consequence of the prevailing fashion of shoestrings &amp; slippers, are at present without employ, almost destitute of bread, and exposed to the horrors of want at the most inclement season; that to the manufactures of buckles and buttons, Birmingham owes its important figure on the map of England; that it is to no purpose to address fashion herself, she being void of feeling and deaf to argument, but fortunately accustomed to listen to his voice, and to obey his commands: and finally, imploring his Royal Highness to consider the deplorable condition of their trade, which is in danger of being ruined by the mutability of fashion, and to give that direction to the public taste, which will insure the lasting gratitude of the petitioners.  
Several important reflections are suggested by this address.  
I. The most precarious of all occupations which give bread to the industrious, are those depending on mere fashion, which generally changes so suddenly, and often so considerably, as to throw whole bodies of people out of employment.  
II. Of all occupations those are the least desirable in a free state, which produce the most servile dependence of one class of citizens on another class. This dependence must increase as the mutuality of wants is diminished. Where the wants on one side are the absolute necessaries; and on the other are neither absolute necessaries, nor result from the habitual œconomy of life, but are the mere caprices of fancy, the evil is in its extreme; or if not,  
III. The extremity of the evil must be in the case before us, where the absolute necessaries depend on the caprices of fancy, and the caprice of a single fancy directs the fashion of the community. Here the dependence sinks to the lowest point of servility. We see a proof of it in the spirit of the address. Twenty thousand persons are to get or go without their bread, as a wanton youth, may fancy to wear his shoes with or without straps, or to fasten his straps with strings or with buckles. Can any despotism be more cruel than a situation, in which the existence of thousands depends on one will, and that will on the most slight and fickle of all motives, a mere whim of the imagination.  
IV. What a contrast is here to the independent situation and manly sentiments of American citizens, who live on their own soil, or whose labour is necessary to its cultivation, or who were occupied in supplying wants, which being founded in solid utility, in comfortable accommodation, or in settled habits, produce a reciprocity of dependence, at once ensuring subsistence, and inspiring a dignified sense of social rights.  
V. The condition of those who receive employment and bread from the precarious source of fashion and superfluity, is a lesson to nations, as well as to individuals. In proportion as a nation consists of that description of citizens, and depends on external commerce, it is dependent on the consumption and caprice of other nations. If the laws of propriety did not forbid, the manufacturers of Birmingham, Wassal, and Wolverhampton, had as real an interest in supplicating the arbiters of fashion in America, as the patron they have addressed. The dependence in the case of nations is even greater than among individuals of the same nation: for besides the mutability of fashion which is the same in both, the mutability of policy is another source of danger in the former.

FASHION.  
AN humble address has been lately pre­  
sented to the Prince of Wales £&gt;y the  
suckle manufacturers of Bir­  
mingham, WalTal, Wolverhampton, and  
their environs, dating that the BUCKLE  
TRADE gives employment to more than  
r WENT If THOUSAND persons, num­  
bers of whom, in consequence of the pre­  
&#x27;&#x27;aiiingfalhion of SHOESTRINGS &amp; SLIP­  
PERS, are at present without employ, al­  
tnoft destitute of bread, and exposed to the  
lorrors of want at the most inclement fea­  
on; that to the manufactures of BUC­  
KLES and BUTTONS, Birmingham owej  
ts important figure on the map of England;  
thftit is to no purpose to address FASHION  
lierfelf, she being void of feeling and deaf  
to argument, but fortunately accustomed  
to listen to his voice, and to obey his com­  
mands : and finally, imploring his Royal  
Highness to conlider the deplorable condi­  
tion of their trade, which is in danger of  
being ruined by the mutability of fajhion, and  
to give tUat direction to &#x27;the public tajle,  
which will insure the lasting gratitude of  
the petitioners.  
Several important reflections are suggest­  
ed by this address.  
I. The molt precarious of all occupations  
which give bread to the industrious, are  
those depending on mere fafliion, which ge­  
nerally changes so suddenly, and often so  
considerably, as to throw whole bodies of  
people out of employment.  
11. Of all occupations those are the least  
deiirable in a free state, which produce the  
most servile dependence of one class of citi­  
zens on another class. This dependence  
must increase as the mutuality of wants is di­  
minished. Where the wants on one fide  
are the absolute neceflaries; and on the  
other are neither absolute neceflaries, nor  
result from the habitual ceconomy of life,  
but are the mere caprices of fancy, the evil  
is in its extreme ; or if not,  
111. The extremity oY the evil must be  
in the cafe before us, where the absolute  
necessaries depend on the caprices of fancy,  
and the caprice of a single fancy directs the  
fafhion of the community. Here the de­  
pendence finks to the lovveft point of servi­  
lity. We fee a proof of it in the spirit of  
the address. Twenty thousand persons are to  
get or go without their bread, as a wanton  
youth, may fancy to wear his flioes with or  
without straps, or to faften his straps with  
firings or with buckles. Can any des­  
potism be more cruel than a situation, in  
which the existence of thousands depends  
on one will, and that w ill on the molt flight  
and fickle of all motives, a mere whim of  
the imagination.  
IV. What a contrast is here to the inde­  
pendent situation and manly sentiments of  
American citizens, who live on their own  
foil, or whose labour is necessary to its cul­  
tivation, or who were occupied in supplying  
wants, which being founded in solid utility,  
in comfortable accommodation, or in fet­  
tled habits, produce a reciprocity of de­  
pendence, at once ensuring subsistence, and  
inspiring a dignified sense of social rights.  
V. The condition of those who receive  
employment and bread from the precarious  
(ource of fafhion and fuperfluity, is a lelfon  
to nations, as well as to individuals. In  
proportion as a nation consists of that des­  
cription of citizens, and depends on exter­  
nal commerce, it is dependent on the con­  
sumption and caprice of other nations. If  
the laws of propriety did not forbid, the  
manufacturers of Birmingham, Waflal, and  
Wolverhampton, had as real an interest in  
supplicating the arbiters of fafhion in Ame­  
rica, as the patron they have addrefled.  
The dependence in the cafe of nations is  
even greater than among individuals of the  
fame nation for besides the mutability offa­  
fhion which is the fame in both, the mutability  
of policy is another source of danger in the  
former. March 20

FASHION,  
  
N humble addrefs has been ately prefented to the prince of Wales by  
the buckle manufaéturcrs of Birmingham, Waflai, Wolverhawptor,  
and their environs, ftating, that the buckle tuade gives employment to more  
than twenty thoufand perfons, numbers ot whom, im confequence of the pre  
vailing fathion of thoe ftiings and flippers, are at pretent without empivy,  
almoft deftitute of bread, and expofed to the horrors of want, at the mit in.  
clement feafon ; that to the manufactures of buckles and but.ons, Birmingham  
owes its important figure on the map of England; thit it is to no purpote te  
addrefs F.thion herfelf, the being vojd of teeling and deaf to argument, but  
fortunately accuftomed to liften to his voice, and to obey his commands ; and  
finally, implo.ing his royal highnefs to confider the deplorabje condition of  
‘their trades which is in danger ot being ruined by the mutability of fafhion,  
and to give that dire€lion to the public tafe, which will inture the laiting yrae  
titude of the petitioners.  
  
Several important reflexions are fuggefted by this addrefs.  
  
I, The moft precarious of ail occupaiioos which give bread to the indutt:i-  
@us are thofe depending on mere fathion, which generally changes fo tudvene  
ly, and often fo confiderably, as to throw whole bodies of pevpic oui of em  
ployment.  
  
II. Of all occupations thofe are the leaft defirzble in a free ftat-, which pros  
duce the moft feivile dependence of one clals of citizenson another class. I his  
dependence muft, increale, as the mutuality of wants is dimimfhed. Where  
the wants on one fide are the sbfolute neceflaries—and on the other are nei-  
ther abfolute neceflaries, nor rejult from the habitual economy of life, but are  
the mere caprices of fancy, the evil is in its extreme; or if not,  
  
III. The extremicy of the evil muft be in the cafe before us, where the abe  
folute neceflaries depend on the caprices of fancy, and the caprice of a fingle  
fancy direéts the fathionof the community. Here the dependence finks to the  
loweit point of fervility. We fee a proof of it in the {pirit of the addrefs.  
‘Twenty thoufand perfons are to get or go without their bread, as a wanton  
youth may fancy to wear his fhoes, with or without ftraps, or to fallen his  
fraps with ftrings or with buckles. Can any cefpotifm be more cruel than a  
fituation, in which the exiftence of thoufands depends on one will, and  
that will on the moft flight and fickle of ail moiives, a mere whim of the ima-  
gination,  
  
iV. What acontraft is here to the independent fituation and manly fenti-  
ments of American citizens, who live on their own foil, or whofe iabour is ne-  
eeflary to its cultivation, or who are occupred in fupplying wants, which,  
being founded in folid utility, in comfortable accommodation, ox in fettled ha-  
bits, produce a reciprocity of dependence, at once infuring fubfiftence, and in-  
{piring a dignified fenfe of focial rights.  
  
VY. The condition of thofe who receive employment and bread from the  
precarious fource of fafhion and {uperfluity is a leffon to nations, as well as to  
individuals. In proportion as a nation confifts ot that &lt;efcription of citizens,  
and depends on external commerce, it is dependent on the con{umption and ca-  
price of other nations. If thelawsof propriety did not forbid, the manufac.  
tnvers of Birmingham, Waffal, and Wolverhampton, had as real an interelt ig
