For the Gazette of The United States  
To Aristides  
The “American” to confirm the inference resulting from the official connection between the Secretary of State and the Editor of the National Gazette, appeals to a conformity of the political principles and views of that officer, with those which are sedulously inculcated in that Gazette. If this conformity exists, it certainly affords a strong presumption, in aid of direct facts, of the operation of his influence on the complexion of that paper.  
  
The circumstances of conformity alleged fall under two heads; one—That the Secretary of State was in the origin opposed to that constitution, which it is the evident object of the National Gazette to discredit—the other That he has been and is opposed to those measures which it is the unremitted and it may be said the avowed endeavour of that paper to censure and subvert.  
In contradiction to the first suggestion, Aristides cites an authority, which the American appears to have relied upon in support of his assertion,—the Speech of Mr. Pendleton in the Convention of Virginia. Let an analasis of this speech shew whether it supports or contradics the assertion.  
Mr. Pendleton represents a certain letter of Mr. Jefferson as containing these particulars 1 a strong wish that the first nine conventions may accept the new constitution, because it would secure the good it contains, which is great and important 2 a wish that the four latest, whichever they should be, might refuse to accede to it, ’til amendments were secured 3 caution to take care that no objection to the form of the Government should produce a scism in the Union; which Mr. Jefferson admits to be an incurable evil.  
From this it appears, that, though Mr. Jefferson was of opinion, that the Constitution contained “great and important good”—and was desirous, that the first nine deliberating states should consent to it, for the sake of preserving the existence of the Union; yet he had strong objections to the constitution—so strong that he was willing to risk an ultimate dismemberment in an experiment to obtain the alterations, which he deemed necessary.  
If the four last deliberating States (particularly if they had happened to be states in Geographical contiguity, which was very possible) had refused to ratify the constitution, what might not have been the consequence? Who knows whether the assenting states would have been willing to have been coerced into the amendments which the non-assenting states might have been disposed to dictate? Calculating the intrigues and machinations, which were to have been expected to stand in the way, who can say, if even two thirds of both houses of Congress should have been found willing to propose—that three fourths of the Legislature—or Conventions in three fourths—of the States—would have been brought to adopt—the required amendments?  
Could any thing but objections to the constitution of the most serious kind, have justified the hazarding an eventual scism in the Union, in so great a degree, as would have attended an adherence to the advice given by Mr. Jefferson? Can there be any perversion of truth, in affirming, that the person, who entertained those objections, was opposed to the Constitution?  
The opposition, which was experienced in every part of the UStates, acknowleged the necessity and utility of Union; and generally speaking, that the Constitution contained many valuable features; contending only that it wanted some essential alterations to render it upon the whole a safe and a good government.  
It may be satisfactory to review what was said, in the same Convention of Virginia, by some other members, on the subject of the letter in question—  
Mr. Henry (Page 109 of the Debates) replies thus to Mr. Pendleton—“The Honorable Gentleman has endeavoured to explain the opinion of Mr. Jefferson, our common friend, into an advice to adopt this new Government. He wishes Nine States to adopt, and that four states may be found somewhere to reject it. Now Sir, I say, if we pursue his advice, what are we to do? To prefer form to substance? For, give me leave to ask, what is the substantial part of his counsel? It is, Sir, that four States should reject. They tell us, that from the most authentic accounts, New Hampshire will adopt it. Where then will four states be found to reject, if we adopt it? If we do, the counsel of this worthy and enlightened countryman of ours will be thrown away &amp;c.” Whether this Gentleman argued sincerely from his impression of the true import of the letter; or made an attempt “to pervert Mr. Jefferson’s sentiments” as Aristides affirms, must be referred to his own consciousness, and to the candid construction of an impartial public.  
Mr. Madison, in reply to Mr. Henry (Page 122 of the same debates) expresses himself thus—“The Honorable Member, in order to influence our decision, has mentioned the opinion of a Citizen, who is an ornament to this state. When the name of this distinguished character was introduced, I was much surprised. Is it come to this then, that we are not to follow our own reason? Is it proper to adduce the opinions of respectable men, not within these walls? If the opinion of an important character were to weigh on this occasion, could we not adduce a character equally great on our side? Are we who (in the Honorable Gentleman’s opinion are not to be guided by an erring world) now to submit to the opinion of a Citizen, beyond the Atlantic? I believe, that were that Gentleman now on this floor, he would be for the adoption of this constitution. I wish his name had never been mentioned. I wish every thing spoken here, relative to his opinion, may be suppressed, if our debates should be published. I know that the delicacy of his feelings will be wounded, when he will see in Print what has, and may be said concerning him on this occasion. I am in some measure acquainted with his sentiments on this subject. It is not right for me to unfold what he has informed me. But I will venture to assert that the clause now discussed is not objected to by Mr. Jefferson. He approves of it, because it enables the Government to carry on its operations &amp;c.”  
It is observable, that Mr. Madison neither advocates the accuracy of Mr. Pendletons comment, nor denies the justness of that of Mr. Henry. His solicitude appears to be to destroy the influence of what he impliedly admits to be the opinion of Mr. Jefferson, to press out of sight the authority of that opinion, and to get rid of the subject as fast as possible. He confesses a knowlege of Mr. Jeffersons sentiments, but prudently avoids disclosure; wrapping the matter in mysterious reserve; and leaving the Public to this day to conjecture what was the precise import of the sentiments communicated.  
Enough however is seen to justify the conclusion that if the spirit of Mr. Jefferson’s advice had prevailed with the Convention, and full credence had been given to the expected adoption by New Hampshire—Virginia, North Carolina, New York and Rhode Island would temporarily have thrown themselves out of the Union. And whether in that event, they would have been at this day reunited to it, or whether there would be now any Union at all is happily a speculation which need only be pursued to derive the pleasing reflection, that the danger was wisely avoided.  
To understand more accurately what the American meant, in asserting that Mr. Jefferson had been opposed to the constitution, let him be compared with himself. In his first paper he expresses himself thus—“While the Constitution of the United States was depending before the People of this Country, for their consideration and decision, Mr. Jefferson being in France was opposed to it, in some of its most important features, and wrote his objections to some of his friends in Virginia. He at first went so far as to discountenance its adoption; though he afterwards recommended it on the ground of expediency, in certain contingencies.”  
From this, it is evident, that so far from denying, he has even admitted, that Mr Jefferson, at one stage of the business, recommended the adoption of the Constitution to his fellow Citizens, but upon a contingency. And this is literally the fact as established by the letter quoted in the debates of the Convention. The advice is to adopt, if nine states had not previously adopted; to reject if that number of states had previously adopted. This clearly is to adopt, or not, upon a contingency. Thus the authority appealed to by Aristides confirms the latter part of the American’s assertion, without contradicting the former part of it.  
Aristides has not denied, nor do I believe he will deny—that Mr. Jefferson in his early communications discountenanced the adoption of the constitution in its primitive form. I know the source of the American’s information. It is equally authentic and friendly to Mr. Jefferson. Allowing for the bare possibility of misapprehension, it exactly accords with the statement, which has been made of it. If the fact shall be denied, the source of information will be indicated under due guards for the delicacy of the proceeding. This will serve, either to confirm, or, in case of misconception to correct.  
I add, that some of Mr. Jefferson’s objections to the constitution have not been removed, by the amendments, which have been proposed. Part of his objections went to the structure of particular parts of the government.  
As to the second fact, with which the American corroborates the charge of Mr. Jefferson’s participation in the views of the National Gazette, it is in a degree conceded by Aristides. He confesses, nay he even boasts, Mr. Jeffersons abhorrence of some of the leading principles of Mr. Hamiltons fiscal administration, that is the leading principles of those measures, which have provided for the public debt, &amp; restored public Credit.  
It would have been well, if Aristides had told us what those leading principles are, which are the objects of so much abhorrence to Mr. Jefferson.  
The leading principles of Mr. Hamilton’s fiscal administration have been—that the Public debt ought to be provided for in favour of those, who, according to the express terms of the contract, were the true legal proprietors of it; that it ought to be provided for in other respects, according to the terms of the contract, except so far as deviations from it should be assented to by the Creditors, upon the condition of a fair equivalent—that it ought to be funded on ascertained revenues pledged for the payment of interest, and the gradual redemption of principal—that the debts of the several states ought to be comprised in the provision, on the same terms with that of the United States—that to render this great operation practicable avoid the oppression of Trade and industry, and facilitate loans to the government, in cases of emergency, it was necessary to institute a National Bank—that indirect taxes were, in the actual circumstances of the country, the most eligible means of revenue, and that direct taxes ought to be avoided as much and as long as possible.  
I aver, from competent opportunities of knowing Mr. Jeffersons ideas, that he has been hostile to all these positions, except, perhaps, the last; and that even in regard to that, his maxims would oblige the government, in practice, speedily to resort to direct taxes.  
I aver, moreover, that Mr. Jefferson’s opposition to the administration of the Government has not been confined to the measures connected with the Treasury Department; but has extended, to use the words of the American “to almost all the important measures of the Government.”  
The exceptions to the generality of both the preceding assertions, I am content to rest on a designation by Mr. Jefferson, or by any person, who shall speak from a knowlege of his sentiments, of those principles of the Fiscal department, or of those measures of the Government of any importance which he does approve. I insist only, that the designation be precise and explicit, and come with such marks of authenticity, as are adapted to the nature of an anonymous discussion.  
To give an idea of the accuracy with which Aristides discloses Mr. Jefferson’s opinions, I shall cite one of his phrases, with a short observation. He asserts, that a suggestion against Mr. Jefferson, which he states, is “made on no better foundation than his being opposed to some of the principles of the funding system, of the National Bank, and of certain other measures of the Secretary of the Treasury.” It is matter of general notoriety and unquestionable certainty, that Mr. Jefferson has been opposed to the National Bank in toto, to its constitutionality and to its expediency. With what propriety, is it then said, that he has been opposed only to “some of the principles of that Institution”?  
I proceed now, to state the exact tenor of the advice, which Mr. Jefferson gave to Congress, respecting the transfer of the debt due to France to a company of Hollanders. After mentioning an offer, which had been made by such a company for the purchase of the debt, he concludes with these extraordinary expressions—“If there is a danger of the public payments not being punctual, I submit whether it may not be better, that the discontents, which would then arise, should be transferred from a Court, of whose good will we have so much need, to the breasts of a private company.”  
The above is an extract which was made from the letter, in February 1787. The date of it was not noted, but the original, being on the files of the department of state, will ascertain that and all other particulars relating to its contents. The genuineness of the foregoing extract may be depended upon.  
This letter was the subject of a Report from the Board of Treasury in February 1787. That Board treated the idea of the Transfer proposed as both unjust and impolitic: unjust, because the Nation would contract an engagement which there was no well grounded prospect of fulfilling; impolitic, because a failure in the payment of interest, on the debt transferred (which was inevitable) would justly blast all hopes of credit with the citizens of the United Netherlands, in future pressing exigencies of the Union: and gave it as their opinion that it would be adviseable for Congress, without delay, to instruct their Minister, at the Court of France, to forbear giving his sanction to any such transfer .  
Congress agreeing in the ideas of the Board caused an instruction to that effect to be sent to Mr. Jefferson  
  
Note at footWhat is here said with regard to Congress is from a recollection of more than 5 years standing &amp; so far liable to error though none is apprehended to exist. The Secret Journals in the possession of the Department of State, if there is one, may correct it.  
  
. Here then was a solemn act of Government condeming the principle, as unjust and impolitic.  
If the sentiment contained in the extract, which has been recited, can be vindicated from the imputation of political profligacy—then is it necessary to unlearn all the ancient notions of justice, and to substitute some new fashioned scheme of morality in their stead.  
Here is no complicated problem, which sophistry may entangle or obscrure—here is a plain question of moral feeling. A Government is encouraged, on the express condition of not having a prospect of making a due provision for a debt, which it owes, to concur in a transfer of that debt from a Nation well able to bear the inconveniences of failure or delay, to Individuals, whose total ruin might have been the consequence of it; and that upon the interested consideration of having need of the good will of the Creditor-Nation, and, with the dishonorable motive as is clearly implied, of having more to apprehend from the discontents of that Nation, than from those of disappointed and betrayed individuals. Let every honest and impartial mind, consulting its own spontaneous emotions, pronounce for itself upon the rectitude of such a suggestion. Let every sober and independent member of the community decide, whether it is likely to be a misfortune to the country, that the maxims of the Officer at the head of its Treasury Department are materially variant from those of the Author of that suggestion.  
And let Aristides prove if he can, that Mr. Jefferson gave advice “expressly contrary to that which has been ascribed to him.” Amidst the excentric ramblings of this political comet, its station, in another revolution, will not prove, that its appearance was not, at one time, at the place, which has been assigned for it.  
The American it ought to be confessed, has, in this instance, drawn larger than the

he has done, by blending with the fact the sudden, though natural, comments of an honest indignation. But the original itself, in its true size and shape, without the help of the least exaggeration, is to the moral eye a deformed and hideous monster.  
Say Aristides! did the Character, to whom you are so partial, imitate, in this case, the sublime virtue of that venerable Athenian, whose name you have assumed? Did he dissuade his countrymen from adopting a proposition, because though “nothing could be more advantageous nothing was more unjust”? Did he not rather advise them to do what was both disadvantageous and unjust? May he not, as a public man, discard all apprehension of ostracism, for being the superlatively just?

FOR THE GAZETTE OF THE UNITED STATES.  
  
TO ARISTIDES.  
  
THE &quot; American&quot; to confirm the inference  
resulting from the official connexion be­  
tween the Secretary of State and the Editorof the  
National Gazette,appeals to a conformity of the  
political principles and views of that officer with  
those which are sedulously inculcated in that  
Gazette. If this conformity exists, it certainly  
affords a strong presumption, in aid of iireft  
fa&amp;s, of the operation of his influence or the  
complexion of that paper.  
  
The circumstances of conformity allelged,  
fall under two head1;; one, That the Secretary  
of State was in the origin opposed to thatCon­  
ftitntion, which it is the evident object 01 the  
National Gazette to discredit: the other, That  
he has been, and is opposed to thore measures  
■which it is the unremited, and it may be laid  
the avowed endeavor of that paper to censure  
and subvert.  
  
lit contradiction to the firft fuggeflion, Afif  
tides cites an authority, which the American ap­  
pears to have relied upon in support of his afler­  
tion ; the speech of Mr. Pendleton in the con­  
vention of Virginia. Let an analysis of this  
speech fliew whether it fuppoi ts or contradicts  
the aiTertion.  
  
Mr. Pendleton represents a certain letter of  
Mr. Jefferfon as containing these particulars—  
a strong v/ilh that the firji nine convcntioni may  
accept the new constitution because it would  
secure the good it contains, which is great and  
important. 2d. A wi(h that-the four latest which  
ever they lhould be, might refufe to accede to  
it till amendments were fecurei. 3d, A caution to  
take care that noobje&lt;stion tothe form of the go­  
vernment (hould produce a schism in the union;  
which Mr. Jeiferfon admits to be an incurable  
evil.  
  
From this it appears, that, though Mr. Jeff­  
erfon was of opinion, that the constitution con­  
tained &quot; great and important good&quot;, and was  
desirous that the firft nine deliberating States  
fhouid consent to it for the fake of preserving  
the existence of the union ; yet he had strong  
objections to the constitution ; so strong that he  
was willing to rilque an ultimate dtjmembement in  
an experiment to obtain the alterations which  
lie deemed neceffarv.  
  
It the four last deliberating States (particular­  
ly if they had happened to be States in geographi­  
cal contiguity, which was very poflible) had re­  
futed to ratify the constitution, what might not  
have been the consequence ? Who knows whe­  
ther the afTenting States would have been will­  
ing to have been coerced into the amendments  
which the non-aflenting States might have been  
disposed to dictate &gt; Calculating the intrigues  
and machinations which were to have been ex  
pefted to stand in the way, who can fay, if even  
two thirds of both houses of CongreVs fliould  
have been found willing to propose, that three  
fourths of the legislatures, or conventions, in  
three fourths of the States would have been  
brought to adopt the required amendments ?  
Could anything but obje&amp;ions to the constitu­  
tion of the most feneus kind have iuftified the  
hazarding an eventual schism in the union, in  
.0 great a degree as would have attended an ad­  
herence to the advice given by Mr. Jefferfon ?  
Can there be any perversion of&#x27;truth in affirm­  
ing, that the person who entertained thole ob­  
jections was opposed to the constitution !  
The opposition which was experienced in  
every part of the United States, acknowledged  
the necessity and utility of the uniou; and, G­  
enerally fpeaking,that she constitution contained  
many valuable features; contending onlv that  
it wanted some eflential alterations to render  
it upon the whole a fafe and a good government.  
It may be fatisfaftory to review what was

and enlightened countryman of our&#x27;s will tie

argued fmcerely from his impreinon of the true  
import of the letter, or made an attempt &quot; tc  
pervert Mr. Jefferfon&#x27;s sentiments,&quot; as Arif­  
tides allinns, must be reserved to his own con­  
sciousness, and to the candid coultrudtion of an  
impartial public.  
  
Mr. Msdifon, in reply to Mr. Henry (p. 122  
of the fame debates) expreUes himfelf thus—  
&quot; The honorable member, in order to influence  
our deciiion, has mentioned the opinion of a ci­  
tizen, who is an ornament to this itate. When  
the name of this diftinguifhecl charatier was in­  
troduced, I was much surprised. hit come to  
this then, that we are not to joilow our own reason ?—  
Is it proper to adduce the opinions of retpetta­  
hle men, not within these walls ? If the opinion  
of an important character were to weigh on  
this occasion, could we not adduce a character  
equally great on our fide ? Are we who (in the  
honorable gentleman&#x27;s opinion) are not to be  
guided by an erring world, now to submit to the  
opinion of a citizen beyond the Atlantic f I believe  
that were that gentleman now on this floor, he  
would be for the adoption of this constitution.  
Iwifhhis name had never been mentioned—  
I wish every thing spoken here relative to his  
opinion, may be iupprefled, if - our debates  
Ihould be publiflied. I know that the delicacy  
of his feelings will be wounded, when he will fee  
in print what bas, and may be )aul concerning  
him on this occasion. I am in some measure  
acquainted with his sentiments on this subject.  
It is not right for me to unfold what he has informed  
me. But I will venture to assert that the clause  
now difculled is notobjefted to by Mr. Jefferfon.  
He approves of it, because it enables the govern­  
ment to carry on its operations, &amp;c.&quot;  
  
It is observable that Mr. Madison neither  
advocates the accuracy of Mr. Pendleton&#x27;s com­  
ment, nor denies the justness of that ot Mr.  
Henry—His solicitude appears to be to destroy  
the influence of what he impliedly admits to be  
the opinion of Mr. Jeferfon, to prefsout of fight  
the authority of that opinion, and to get rid of  
the lu&#x27;ijeet as fa ft as poflible. He confeffes a  
knowledge of Mr. Jefferfon&#x27;s sentiments, but  
prudently avoids disclosure ; wrapping the mat­  
ter in mysterious reserve ; and leaving the pub­  
lic to this day to conjecture what was the pre­  
cise import of the sentiments communicated.  
Enough however is seen to juftify the conclusi­  
on, that if the spirit of Mr. Jefferfon&#x27;s advice  
had prevailed with the convention, and full cre­  
dence had been given to the expected adoption  
by New Hampshire—Virgipia,NorthCarolina,  
New-York and Fihode-Iftand wjuld have tem­  
porarily thrown themselves out of the Union.  
And whether in that event,they would hane been  
at this day reunited to it, or whether there  
would be now any union at all is happiiy a spe­  
culation which need only be pursued to derive  
the pleafmg reflection, that the danger was wife­  
lv avoided.  
  
To understand more accurately what the  
American meant in aflerting that Mr. Jefferfon  
had been opposed to the constitution, let him  
be Compared with himlelf. 11l his hvft paper  
he exprefles himfelf thus—&quot; While the consti­  
tution of the United States was depending be­  
fore the people of this country for their consi­  
deration and decision, Mr. Jefferfon being in  
France was oppoftd to it, in rone of tts ntoji impor­  
tant features, and wrote his objections to iome  
of his friends in Virginia. He atJitJl went so  
far as to discountenance its adoption : thoug he af­  
terwards recommended it on the ground of expedi­  
ency in certain contingencies.&quot;  
  
From this, it is evident, that so far from de­  
nying, he has even admitted, that M. Jefferfon,  
at onefiage of the bufmefs, recommended the adop­  
tion of the constitution to his JJlqzv citizens, but  
upon a contingency. And this is literally the  
fa&amp;, as established by the letter quoted in the  
debates of the convention- The advice is to a­  
dopt if nine dates had not previoully adopted;  
to reje&lt;st, if number of states had previous­  
ly adopted. This is clearly to adopt, or not,  
upon a contingency. Thus the authority ap­  
pealed to by Aiijlides confirms the latter part of  
the American&#x27;s allertion, without contradi&amp;ing  
the former part of it.  
  
Arijlides Las not denied, nor do I believe he  
will deny—That Mr. Jeiferfon in his early com­  
munications discountenanced the adoption of  
the conilitution in its primitve form. I know  
the source of the American*s information. It is  
equally authentic and friendly to Mr. Jefferfon-  
Allowing for the bare pofiibility of mifapprehen.  
fion, it exattly accords with the statement  
which has been made of it. If the fa&lt;st fliall be  
denied, the source of information will be indi­  
cated, under due guards for the delicacy of the  
proceeding.  
  
This will serve, either to confirm, or, in cafe  
of mi (conception, to corre&amp;.  
  
I add that some of* Mr. Jefferfon&#x27;s objections  
to the constitution have not been removed by  
the amendments which have been proposed—  
Part of his objections went to the flru&amp;ure oi  
particular parts of the government.  
  
As to the fccond fart with which the American  
corroborates the charge of Mr. Jefferlon&#x27;s par­  
ticipation in the views of the National Gazette,  
it is in a degree conceded by Arijiidcs. He con­  
feffes, nay he even boajls Mr. Jefferfon&#x27;s abhor­  
rence of some of the leading principles of Mr.  
Hamilton&#x27;s fifcal administration—that is, the  
leading principles of those mea&#x27;fures which have  
provided for the public debt and restored public  
credit.  
  
It would have been well, if Ariflides had told  
us what those leading principles are, which are  
the obje&lt;sts of so much abhorrence to Mr. Tef­  
ferfon.  
  
The leading principles of Mr. Hamilton&#x27;s  
fifcal administration have been—that the public  
debt ought to be provided for, in favor of thole  
who, according to the exprels terms of the con­  
trad, were the true legal proprietors of it;  
that it ought to be provided for, in other re­  
peats, according to the terms of the   
except so tar as deviations from it fhon&#x27;d be s:-

To give an idea of the accuracy with which  
Arijlides difcloles Mr. Jeiferfon&#x27;s opinions I foil  
c ite one of his phrases with a (hort observation  
He aflerts that a suggestion against Mr. |tfel  
ion, which he states, is made on no better fono.  
dation than his being opposed to_/»£of the prin&quot;  
ciples of the funding system, of the national  
bank, and of certain other measures ofthe Se­  
cretary ofthe Treafory. It is matter of gene­  
(ral notoriety, and unquestionable certair.tv  
that Mr. Jefferfon has been opposed to tie u&#x27;  
tional bank in totj, to its conjiitulionahi, arid it  
its expediency. With what propriety is it tiiei  
said that he has been opposed only to &quot;Jem c  
the principles of that institution.&quot;  
  
I proceed scow to state the exact tenor ofrt»  
advice which Mr. Jefferfon gave to Conjpdsie.  
fpedting the transfer of the debt djqe tofooi  
to a company of Hollanders. &#x27;After mental.,  
an offer which had been made byf&#x27;ucbacorapuj&#x27;  
for the purchase of the debt, he concludes wist  
these extraordinary expreffons—&quot; If there isi

The genuineness of the foregoing  
be depended upon. &#x27; • &quot;  
This letter was the fubjeft of a &#x27;  
the board of treasury in Feb. 1787. ThattaHl.  
treated the idea of the transfer proposed ai I*)#&#x27;  
unjust and impolitic: vnjujl, becauie tlie natiajr  
would contract an engagement whichthert  
110 well grounded profpeft of fulfilling;  
because a failure itt the payment of intertft,ojj  
the debt transierred (which was itmlalk)vi&amp;t&#x27;  
bhjl all hopes of credit with the citizens  
the United Netherlands, in future pressing  
gencies of the Union : And gave it as their epij  
nion, that it would be advisable f»r Congrdi,  
ivit/wut delay, to inllruft their Miniver at tli  
Court of France, to forbear giving his faoAiif  
to any such transfer.—  
  
Congress agreeing in the ideas of the board,  
caused an inftrudtion to that effect to be sent  
to Mr. Jeflferfon*. Here then was afoleran ast  
of government condemning the principle as un«  
just and impolitic.  
If* the sentiment contained in the extract  
which has been recited, can be v indicated from  
the imputation of political proJUgic.—tllnis it  
necejfury to art/earn all the ancient notions of jul­  
tice,andtofubftitute some new-fafhioned fcbemc  
of morality in their Head.  
I Here is no complicated problem which fop.iif­  
try may entangle or obscure. Here is a plain  
queflion of moral feeling. A government is en­  
couraged on the express condition of MhaMg&#x27;l  
projpett of making a due provision for a debt  
which it owes, to concur in a transfer oj t a  
debt from a nation well abie to bear the incon­  
veniences of failure or delay, to indivi ua ,  
whofc total ruin might have been e.con!&quot;  
quence of itj and that upon the tvt(r&#x27;Jc C?V  
deration of having need of the good-*&quot; o  
creditor-nation, and, with the difhonora  
motive, as is clearly implied, of having mOJ?  
apprehend from the discontents of that na 1 »  
than from those of disappointed ana  
individuals. Let every honest and ITnPa  
mind, consulting its own fpontaneou eni?.A&#x27;  
pronounce for itfelf upon the rectitude o\lucn  
suggestion. Let every sober and i#n   
member of the community decide we ■&#x27;  
likely to be a misfortune to the coun rv&gt;  
the maxims of the officer at the ea .  
treasury department are mater.?- &gt;

And let Aripdes prove, if can&#x27; rv to

The friends and advocates of Mr. Jefferfon have  
made no scruple to boafl of his abhorrence of the  
leading principles of the adminifl ration of the finances  
of the United States ; and the National Gazette, one rt  
■Vis the maiii objeAs of which was te abuse that ad- m  
mimftiation, in confornsity to that abhorrence, went   
so far in one of the numbeis, as to urge the rnctjji. ?  
~ly of a revolt.4 n, in order to overthrow the whole   
system of public credit. */  
. ,Tbe leading principles of our fifcal adminiftrati- C 3  
on were, that the public debt ought to be provided   
far, in saver of thpfe, who, according to thcexprefs  
terms of the cantraft, were the true legal proprie  
tors of it ; that it ought to be provided for, inoiher  
refpcifts, according to the terms of the contrast, m  
except so far as deviations f.om it fho&#x27;uld be a/Ten- Pc

equivalent, that it oug.ht to be funded upon afcer- Pa  
tained revenues, pledged for the payment of inte- irr

the debts of the feveial Rates ought to be compri-   
led in the provision, on the fame terms with that of v&quot;  
the United States, that to render this great opera- te  
tion practicable, aveid the oppreflion of trade and  
indullry. and facilitate loans to the government,&#x27; in  
cases ot, emergency, it was necessary to inftitut&#x27;e a Pl,

of the debt due to France, to a company of Holland­  
ers. After mentioning an offer which had been  
made by such a company for the purehafe of the  
debt, he concludes with these extraordinary expres­  
sions—&quot; If there is a danger of the public pay­  
ments not be&#x27;mg punctual, I submit whether it may  
not be better, that the discounts which would then  
arise, should be transferred from a court, of whose  
good will we have so mveh need, to the brtafis of&#x27; a  
private company  
The above ic an extract which was trade ftom  
the letter in February 1787. The date of it was  
not n«ted, but the original being on the tiles in the  
department of state, will ascertain that, a»d all o­  
ther particulars, relating to its contents—The ge­  
nuinenefiof the extradl may be depended upon.  
This letter was the fubjeit of a report from the  
board of trcafury, in February 1787: That board  
treated the idea of t&#x27;rantfer proposed as both un­  
just and iMFOUTtc: unjujl, bccaufr thß nation  
would contract an engagement, which there was no  
welt grounded prt/peß of fulfilling ; impolitic, be  
cause a failure in the payment of inteteft on the  
debt transferred (which was wevitoblc) would jufl­  
ly blajt all hopes of credit with the citizens of the  
United Netherlands, in future prefling exigences of  
the Union ; and the board gave it as their opinion,  
that it would be advisable for congress, without de.  
lay, to inftruß their minister at the court of France,  
to forbear giving his fcindiov to any such transfer.  
Congress agreeing in the ideas of the board,  
caused an inflruSion to that effect to be sent to Mr.  
Jefferfon. Here there was a foltmn ad of govern­  
ment condemning the principle as unjujl and impolitic.  
If the sentiment contained io the extract, which  
has been recited, can be vindicated from poli.  
tical profligacy—tUrn is it necejfary to unlearn all the  
ancient notions of juflice, and to fabftittite some  
new-fafhioned scheme of morality in their ftcad.  
Here it no complicated problem, which sophistry  
may entangle or ebfettre. Here is a plain question  
of moral feeling. A government is encouraged on  
j tbe express condition of not having a projpeH of mak­

breasts of a firivate company.”  
  
This kind of honesty, however, did  
not exactly -coincide with certain o/d  
Jashioned idcas, entertained by a board  
from the treasury, who were, perhaps,

the payment of interest on the debt
