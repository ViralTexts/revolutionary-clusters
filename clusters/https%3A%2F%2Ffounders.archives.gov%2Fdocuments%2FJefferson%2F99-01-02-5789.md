n most cases, are perhaps the more confident in proportion as they are less enlightened.  
We know, from what we see &amp; feel, that the animal body, is, in it’s organs &amp; functions, subject to  
derangement, inducing pain, &amp; tending to it’s destruction. in this disordered state we observe nature providing for the  
reestablishment of order by exciting some salutary evacuation of the morbific matter, or by some other operation which  
escapes our imperfect senses and researches. she brings on a crisis by stools, vomiting, sweat, urine, expectoration,  
bleeding &amp;c. which for the most part ends in the restoration of healthy action.   
Experience has taught us also that  
there are certain substances, by which, applied to the living body internally or externally, we can at will produce these  
same evacuations, and thus do, in a short time, what nature would do but slowly, and do effectually, what perhaps she  
would not have strength to accomplish. where then we have seen a disease, characterised by specific signs or phaenomena,  
and relieved by a certain natural evacuation or process, whenever that disease recurs under the same appearances, we may  
reasonably count on producing a solution of it, by the use of such substances as we have found produce the same evacuation  
or movement. thus fulness of the stomach we can relieve by emetics, diseases of the bowels by purgatives,

t was certainly a pious fraud. but the adventurous  
physician goes on, &amp; substitutes presumption for knolege. from the scanty field of what is known, he launches into the  
boundless region of what is unknown. he establishes for his guide some fanciful theory of corpuscular attraction, of  
chemical agency, of mechanical powers, of stimuli, of irritability accumulated, or exhausted, of depletion by the launcet  
&amp; repletion by mercury, or some other ingenious dream which lets him into all nature’s secrets at short hand. on the  
principle which he thus assumes, he forms his table of Nosology, arrays his diseases into families, and extends his  
curative treatment, by analogy, to all the cases he has thus arbitrarily marshalled together. I have lived myself to see  
the disciples of Hoffman, Boerhave, Staalh, Cullen, Brown, succeed one another like the shifting figures of a magic  
lanthern, &amp; their fancies, like the dresses of the annual Doll-babies from Paris becoming, from their novelty, the vogue  
of the day, and yielding to the next novelty their ephemeral favor. the patient treated on the fashionable theory sometimes gets  
well in spite of the medecine. the medecine therefore restored him, &amp; the young Doctor recieves new courage to proceed  
in his bold experiments on the lives of his fellow creatures. I believe we may safely affirm that the inexperienced &amp;  
presumptuous band of Medical tyros let loose upon the world, destroys more of human life in one year, than all the Robin  
hoods, Cartouches, &amp; Macheaths do in a century. it is in this part of medecine that I wish to see a reform, an  
abandonment of hypothesis for sober facts, the first degree of value set on clinical observation, and the lowest on  
visionary theories. I would wish the young practitioner especially to have deeply impressed on his mind the real limits of  
his art, &amp; that when the state of his patient gets beyond these, his office is to be a watchful, but quiet spectator of  
the operations of nature, giving them fair play by a well-regulated regimen, &amp; by all the aid they can derive from the  
excitement of good spirits &amp; hope in the patient. I have no doubt that some diseases, not yet understood, may in time be  
transferred to the table of those known. but, were I a Physician, I would rather leave the transfer to the slow hand of  
accident, than hasten it by guilty experiments on those who put their lives into my hands. the only sure foundations of  
medecine are an intimate knolege of the human body, and observation on the effects of medicinal substances on that. the  
anatomical &amp; clinical schools therefore are those in which the young physician should be formed. if he enters, with  
innocence, that of the theory of medecine, it is scarcely possible he should come out untainted with error. his mind must  
be strong indeed, if, rising above juvenile credulity, it can maintain a wise infidelity against the authority of his  
instructors, &amp; the bewitching delusions of their theories.—you see that I estimate justly that portion of instruction  
which our medical students derive from your labours; &amp;, associating with it one of the chairs which my old &amp; able  
friend Dr. Rush so honorably fills, I consider them as the two fundamental pillars of the edifice. indeed I have such an  
opinion of the talents of the professors in the other branches which constitute the school of medecine with you, as to  
hope &amp; believe that it is from this side of the Atlantic that Europe, which has taught us so many other things, will at  
length be led into sound principles in this branch of science, the most important of all others, being that to which we  
commit the care of health &amp; life

TO SENSIBLE CITIZENS.-W e know   
from what we see and feel, that the animal   
body is, in its organs and functions, subject   
to derangement, inducing pain, and tending   
to its destruction. In this disordered state,   
we observe nature providing for the re-es-   
tablishment of order, by exciting some salu­  
:my evacuation of the morbific matter, or by   
some other operation, which escapes our   
imperfect senses and researches. In some   
eases she brings on a ct his by the bowels, in   
others by sweating, &amp;c. atc.   
Now experience has taught us that there   
are certain sebstances, by which, applied to   
the living body, internally or externally, we   
tan at will produce the same evacuations,   
and thus do in a short time, what nature   
could do but slowly, and do effectually what ;   
she might not have strength to accomplish.   
When then we have seen a disease cured by   
a certain naturalevacuatien, should that dis­  
ease occur again, we may count upon curing   
it by the use of such substances,as we know   
bring about the same evacuation, which we

street.  
“We know, from what we see and feel,  
that the animal body is in its organs and func­  
tions subject to derangement, inducing pain  
and tending to its destruction. In this dis­  
ordered state we observe nature providing for  
the re-establishment of ord,r, by exciting  
some salutary evacuation of the morbific mat­  
ter, or by some other operation and escapes  
our imperfect senses and researches. She  
brings on a crisis by stools, vomiting, sweat,  
urine, expectoration, fee , which for the most  
part ends in the restoration of healthy action.  
Experience has taught us also that there are  
certain substances by which, applied to the  
living body, internally or externally, we can  
at will produce the same evacuations, and  
thus do in a short time what nature would do  
but slowly, and do effectually what perhaps  
she would not have strength to accomplish  
Where, then, we have seen a disease charac­  
terized by specific signs or phenomena; and  
relieved by a certain natural evacuation or  
process, whenever that disease occurs under  
the same appearances, we may reasonably  
count on producing a solution of it, by the  
use of such substances as we have found, by  
experience, produce the same evacuation or  
movement. Thus, fulness of the stomach we  
can relieve by emetics; diseases of bowels by  
purgatives, &amp;c. Here, then, the judi­  
cious, the moral, the humane physician should  
stop *****  
But the adventurous physician goes on,  
and substitutes presumption for know­  
ledge. From the scanty field of what is  
known, he launches into the broundless re­  
gions of what is unknown. He establishes  
for his guide some fanciful theory of corpus­  
cular attraction of chemical agency, or me­  
chanical powers, of stimuli, or irritability  
accumulated or exhausted, of depletion by  
the lancet, and repletion by mercury,or some  
other ingenious dream which lets .him  
into all nature’s secrets at short hand  
On the principle which he thus assumes  
he forms his table of nosology, arrays  
his diseases into families, and extends  
his curative treatment, (says he,) by analogy,  
to all he has thus arbitarily marshalled to­  
gether.  
I have lived myself to see the disciples of  
Hoffman, Boerhaave, Staehl, Cullen, and  
Brown succeed one another like the shifting  
figures of the magic lantern, and their fan  
des, like the dresses of the annual doll-babies  
from Paris, becoming, from their novelty the  
vogue of the day and yielding to the next novel­  
ty their ephemeral favors. The patient, treat­  
ed on the fashionable theory, sometimes gets  
well in spite of the medicine. The medicine,  
therefore, restored him, and the young doctor  
receives new courage to proceed in his bold  
experiments on the lives of his fellow crea­  
tures  
I believe we may safely affirm that the in­  
experienced presumptuous band of me­  
-1 ical tyros let loose upon the world, destroys  
more human life in one year, than all the  
Robbinhoods, Cartouches, and Macheaths do  
in a century.  
It is in this part of medicine I wish to see  
a reform; an abandonment of hypothesis for  
sober facts; the first degree of value set  
on clinical observation and the lowest on  
visionary theories. I would wish the young  
practitioner especially, to have deeply on his  
impressed on his mind the real limits of his  
art. *****  
The only sure foundations of medicine are  
an intimate knowledge of the human body,  
and observation of the effects of medicinal  
substances on that. The anatomical and  
clinical schools, therefore, are those in which  
the young physician should be formed. If he  
enters, with innocence, that of the theory of  
medicine, it is scarcely possible that he should  
come out untainted with error. His mind  
must be strong, indeed, if, rising above juve­  
nile credulity, he can maintain a wise infi­  
delity against the authority of his instructors  
and the bewitching delusion of their theories.  
******  
I hope and believe that it is from this side  
of the Atlantic that Europe, which has iaught  
us so many other things, will be led into  
sound principles in this branch of science,  
the most important of all others,.being that to  
which we commit the care of health and life.
