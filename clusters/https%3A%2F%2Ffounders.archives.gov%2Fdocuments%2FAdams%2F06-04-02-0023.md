The Continental ships of War, and Provincial ships of War, and Letters of Mark and Privateers are permitted to cruise upon British Property, whenever found on the ocean. This is not Independency you know, nothing like it.  
If a Post or two more, should bring you unlimited Latitude of Trade to all Nations, and a polite Invitation to all Nations to trade with you, take care that you dont call it, or think it Independency. No such Matter. Independency is an Hobgoblin, of So frightful Mein, that it would throw a delicate Person into Fits to look it in the Face.

or by all these Titles is it call’d. I think the most apposite is the Act of Independency, for King Lords and Commons have united in Sundering this Country and that I think forever. It is a compleat Dismemberment of the British Empire. It throws thirteen Colonies out of the Royal Protection, levels all Distinctions and makes us independent in Spight of all our supplications and Entreaties.  
It may be fortunate that the Act of Independency should come from the British Parliament, rather than the American Congress: But it is very odd that Americans should hesitate at accepting Such a Gift from them.  
However, my dear Friend Gates, all our Misfortunes arise from a Single Source, the Reluctance of the Southern Colonies to Republican Government. The success of this War depends upon a Skillfull Steerage of the political Vessell. The Difficulty lies in forming Constitutions for particular Colonies, and a Continental Constitution for the whole, each Colony should establish its own Government, and then a League should be formed, between them all. This can be done only on popular Principles and Maxims which are so abhorrent to the Inclinations of the Barons of the south, and the Proprietary Interests in the Middle Colonies, as well as to that Avarice of Land, which has made upon this Continent so many Votaries to Mammon that I Sometimes dread the Consequences.

that ensued, from  
tendering her submission to the British crown. The same principle had been so  
far dominant in the Southern mind, in the days of the Constitutional Convention,  
that Mr. Rutledge, of South Carolina, had said, while opposing a tax on the im-  
portation of slaves: “The true question at present is, whether Southern States  
shall or shall not be parties to the Union.’’ And Mr. Pinckney had followed with  
the odious sentiment that South Carolina would never receive the Constitution if  
it prohibited the slave-trade.  
  
As far back as March, 1776, John Adams had declared—writing to General  
Gates: “All our misfortunes arise from a single source, the resistance of the  
Southern colonies to republican government.” And he adds, that “popular prin-  
ciples and axioms are abhorrent to the inclinations of the BARONS OF THE SouTH.”
