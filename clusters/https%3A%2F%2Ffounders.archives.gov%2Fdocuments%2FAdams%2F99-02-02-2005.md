Sir,  
					June 3, 1797  
				  
				the interesting detail of those events which have rendered the convention of Congress, at this time, indispensable, (communicated in your Speech to both Houses,) has excited in us the strongest emotions. Whilst we regret the occasion, we cannot omit to testify our approbation of the measure, and to pledge ourselves that no considerations of private inconvenience shall prevent, on our part, a faithful discharge of the duties to which we are called.We have constantly hoped that the nations of Europe, whilst desolated by foreign wars, or convulsed by intestine divisions, would have left the United States to enjoy that peace and tranquillity to which the impartial conduct of our Government has entitled us; and it is now, with extreme regret, we find the measures of the French Republic tending to endanger a situation so desirable and interesting to our country.Upon this occasion we feel it our duty to express, in the most explicit manner, the sensations which the present crisis has excited, and to assure you of our zealous co-operation in those measures which may appear necessary for our security or peace.Although it is the earnest wish of our hearts that peace may be maintained with the French Republic, and with all the world, yet we will never surrender those rights which belong to us as a nation; and whilst we view with satisfaction the wisdom, dignity, and moderation, which have marked the measures of the supreme Executive of our country, in its attempts to  remove, by candid explanations, the complaints and jealousies of France, we feel the full force of that indignity which has been offered our country in the rejection of its Minister. No attempts to wound our rights as a sovereign State will escape the notice of our constituents; they will be felt with indignation, and repelled with that decision which shall convince the world that we are not a degraded people, that we can never submit to the demands of a foreign Power without examination and without discussion.Knowing as we do the confidence reposed by the people of the United States in their Government, we cannot hesitate in expressing our indignation at any sentiments tending to derogate from that confidence. Such sentiments, wherever entertained, served to evince an imperfect knowledge of the opinions of our constituents. An attempt to separate the people of the United States from their Government, is an attempt to separate them from themselves; and although foreigners, who know not the genius of our country, may have conceived the project, and foreign emissaries may attempt the execution, yet the united efforts of our fellow-citizens will convince the world of its impracticability.Sensibly as we feel the wound which has been inflicted by the transactions disclosed in your communications, yet we think with you, that neither the honor nor the interest of the United States forbid the repetition of advances for preserving peace. We, therefore, receive with the utmost satisfaction your information that  a fresh attempt at negotiation will be instituted; and we cherish the hope that a mutual spirit of conciliation, and a disposition on the part of France to compensate for any injuries which may have been committed upon our neutral rights; and, on the part of the United States, to place France on grounds similar to those of other countries in their relation and connection with us, if any inequalities shall be found to exist, will produce an accommodation compatible with the engagements, rights, duties, and honor of the United States. Fully, however, impressed with the uncertainty of the result, we shall prepare to meet with fortitude any unfavorable events which may occur, and to extricate ourselves from their consequences with all the skill we possess, and all the efforts in our power. Believing with you that the conduct of the Government has been just and impartial to foreign nations, that the laws for the preservation of peace have been proper, and that they have been fairly executed, the Representatives of the people do not hesitate to declare that they will give their most cordial support to the execution of principles so deliberately and uprightly established.The many interesting subjects which you have recommended to our consideration, and which are so strongly enforced by this momentous occasion, will receive every attention which their importance demands; and we trust that by the decided and explicit conduct which will govern our deliberations, every insinuation will be repelled which is derogatory to the honor and independence of our country.Permit us, in offering this Address, to express our satisfaction at your promotion to the first office in the Government, and our entire confidence that the preeminent talents and patriotism which have placed you in this distinguished situation, will enable you to discharge its various duties with satisfaction to yourself and advantage to our common country.

THE interefting detail of the events, which have ren-  
dered the convention of Congrefs at this time indifpenfable  
(communicated in your fpeech to both houfes) has excited  
in us the ftrongeit emotions. —Whilft we regret’ the oc-  
cafion, we cannot omit to teltify our approbation of the  
meaiure, and to pledge ourfelves chat our confideration of  
private inconvenience, thall prevent, on our part, a faithful  
difcharge of the duties to which we are called.  
  
We have conftantly hoped, that the nations of Europe,  
whilft defolated by foreign wars, or convulfed- by inteftine  
divifions, would have left the United Statesto enjoy that  
peace and tranquility, to which the impartial conduct of  
our governinent has entitled us ; and it is now with extreme  
regret, we find the meafurss of the French Republic  
tending to endanger a fituation fo defireable and intereiting  
to our country. ,  
  
Upon this occafion, we feel it our duty to exprefs, in  
the moft explicit manner, the fenfations which the prefent  
crifis has excited, and to affure you of our zealous co-oper-  
ation in thofe meafures which may appear neceffai y tor our  
fecurity or-peace.  
  
Altho’ it is the firft and moft ardent with of our hearts,  
that peace may be maintained with the French Rep.blic,  
and with all the world; yet we can never furrender thofe  
righis which belong to us as a nation ; and whillt we view  
with fatisfaétion the wifdom, dignity and moderation, which  
have marked the meafures of the Supreme Executive of  
our country, in its attempts to remove, by candid explanz-  
tions, the complaints and jealouiies of France, we feel the  
full force of that indignity which has been offered our  
country in the rejection of its Miniter. No attempts to  
caiecall our rights as a fovercign ftate will efcape the notice  
of our confiituents: they will be felt with indignation,  
and repelled with that decifion-which fhal] convince the  
world that we are not a degraded people, that we can never  
  
fubmit to the demands of a foreign power without examina-  
  
tion and without difcuflion.  
  
Knowing as wedo the confidence repofed by the people  
of the United States in their government, we cannot hefitate  
in exprefling our indignation at the fentiments difclofed  
the Prefident of the Executive Direttory of France, in hiv  
fpeech to the late Minifter of the United States. Such  
fentiments ferve to difcover the imperfe&amp; knowledge which  
France pofleffes of the real opinions of our conftituents.—  
An attempt to feparate the people of the United States  
from tlicir government, is an attempt to feparate them from  
themfelves ; and altho’ foreigners, who know not the geniv:  
of our country, may have conceived the proje&amp;, and foreig:.  
emiflaries may attempt the execution, yet the united effor::  
of our fellow-citizens will convince the world of its im-  
practicability

left the United ‘States to enjoy’ that

Uron this occasion, we feel it our

ALrTHOUGH it is the firflt and most

complaints ‘and’ jealousies of France,  
we feel the fall force of that indigni­  
ty which has been offered our coun­

not hesitate in exprefiimg our mndig­

the President of the Executive Di­

Such sentiments serve to discover the

The intereftingdetait of thofe events, which have rendered .  
  
the convention ot Congrefs indifpenfable, (communicated  
in. your fpeech to bothboufes) has excited in us the flrong­

pledge ourfelvei, that no conGderations of private iuconvc-&#x27;  
niente, fliall prevent, on our part, a faithful difchaige of  
the duties to which we aie called.  
. We havi conflantly hoped, that the nations of Europe,  
whilft dcTolaied by foreign wars, Or convulfed by intcfl&#x27;ine  
divilions, would nave left the United States to enjoy that  
peace and tranquility, to which the impartiality of pur gc.

:we find the meafures of the French republic tending to en  
  
danger a utuation lo delireable and, lntcrctling to our couu. . .  
  
Upon this occafion, we feel it our duty to exprefs, in

crifis has excited, aiid to a dure vou of our zealous co ope&#x27;  
  
ration in tnoie meaiurcs wnicn may appear Decenary, ior . -.  
our fecurity and peace. . .  
Although it is the firft and rhofl ardent wifh of our hearts­  
that peace may be maintained with the French republic, and  
with all the world ; yet we can never fuirendeir. thofe rights­  
which belong to us as a nation ; and wbilfFwc view with fa­  
tisfaclion the wifdora, dignity and moderation which have  
marked the meafures of the fupremc executive of our coun­  
try, in its attempts to remove, by candid explanations, the.  
complaints and jealoufies of France, we feel the full force  
of that indignity which has been offered to our country in  
the rejection of its mifiilter. No attempt to wound our-rights  
asa fovereign Hate, will cfrape the notice of our con-  
  
fti merits: they will be felt with indignation,&#x27; and repelled  
with that decifion which (hall convince the . world that we ...  
are nt a degraded people, that we can never fubmit to the  
demands of a foreign power, without examination and  
without difcumon.  
Knowing as we do, tlieeonfidence repofed by the people  
(jf the United States in their government, we cannot li?ii­

France poflelfes of jhe real opinions of cur condiments,  
An attempt to feparate the people of the United States &#x27;

c J I  
Sir,  
THE inleierting detail of those e««nts, wilich Have  
rendered the convention of Congress at thii time in­  
difpcnfable, (communicated in your fpeecb to both 1  
house*) has excited in ui (he ftiotigelt emotions.  
Whilfl we regret the occasion, we cannot omit to tefli­  
fy our apDrobatior of the measure. and to pledge our­  
selves that no conliderations of private inconvenience,  
(hall prevent, on our part, a faithful difchatgc of the  
duties to which we aie called.  
We have constantly hoped, that the nationsjof Eu­  
rope, whilfl defolatcd by foreign war», or intestine  
divisions, .would have left the United States to enjoy  
that pcice and tranquility, to which the impartial  
eondutl ef our Government had entitled ui; and it ii  
now with extreme regret, we find the measures of the i  
French republic tending to endanger a situation so dc  
firable and interefling to our country -  
Upon this occasion, we feci it our duty to express,  
in the mofl explicit manner, the sensations which the  
present ciifis has excited, and to allure yeu of our  
jealous co-operation in those measures which may ap­  
pear ricceffary so our security or peace  
Although it it the earned wish ot our hearts, that  
peace may be maintained with the French republic,  
and with all the world ; yet we never will (urrender  
those tights which belong to us as a nation: and whilll  
we view wi.h fati-faftion the wisdom, dignity, and &quot;  
moderation, which have marked the measures of the  
supreme executive of our country, in its attempts to  
remove, by candid explanations, the complaints and  
jealousies of France, we (eel the full force of that in­  
| dignity which has been offered to our country in the  
i rejeftion of its minister.  
So attempts to wound our rights as a Sovereign  
J State will escape the notice of our constituents : they  
will be felt with indignation, and repelled with that  
decision, which fhalj convince the world that we are  
not a degraded people ; that we can never submit to  
the demands ot a foreign power, without examination  
aud without difcuflion.  
Knowing, as we do, the confidence rrpofed by the  
people of the United States in their government, we  
cannot hefitatc in cxprcfTing our indignation at any Sen­  
timents tending to derogate fronijthat confidence.  
Such sentiments, wherever entertained, serve to evince  
an imperfeft knowledge of the opinions of our con­  
flituents. An attempt to separate the people of the  
United States from their Government, is an attempt  
to separate them from tbemfelves ; and although foi­  
eiguets who,know not the genius of our country,  
may have conceived theprojctl, and foreign emiflaries  
mav attempt the execution, yet the united efforts of  
our fellow.citizens will convince the world of its im­  
practicability.  
Sensibly as we feel ths wound which has been in.  
fli£l«d by the tranfafttonsdifclofed in your communi­  
cations, yet we think with y®u, thar neither the hon­  
our nor the interefl of the United States forbid the re.  
petition of advances for preserving peace. We there­  
fore receive with the utmolt fatisfa&amp;ion, your infor­  
mation that a trefh attempt at negociation will be in­  
diluted ; and we cherish the hope that a mutual fpiiit  
of conciliation, and a difpofltion cn the part of  
Trance to compensate for&#x27;any injuries which may have  
been committed upon our neutral rights, and on the  
part of the United States to place France on grounds  
• similar to those of other countries, in their relation  
and connection with us, if any inequality shall be  
found to rxift, will produce an accommodation com­  
patible with the rights, duties and honor of the U­  
nitcd States. Fully, hawever, impressed with the  
unceruinty of the result, we lhali prepare to meet  
1 with fortitude any unfavorable events which may oc­  
cur, and to extricateourfelvcs from their conftquences  
with all the flc.i&#x27;l we pofTefs, and all the efforts in our  
power. Believing with you that the unduft of the 1  
goveri.ment has been j.ft and impartial to foreign na- &#x27;  
&#x27; t&#x27;onsi that the !»ws f«r tht pielervation of peace have  
■ been proper, ana that they have been fairly executed,  
, the Reprefentativcs of the People do not hesitate to  
, declare, that they will give their molt cordial support  
. to the execution of principles so deliberately and up­  
&#x27; rightly eitab lulled.  
i The many interefling fublcfts which you &#x27;have re.  
] commended to our confederation, and which are io  
Hrongly enforced .y this momentous occasion, will  
3 receive every attention which their importance de­  
&quot; mands ; end we tiuli that by the decided and explicit  
• conduit which wiil govern our deliberations, every  
iofuiuation will be repelled which is derogatory to the  
honour and independence of our country.  
&gt; Permit u», in o&#x27;&#x27;ering this address, to cxprefi our  
, fatiafatftion at your promotion to the firlt office in  
. the government, and our entire confidence that the  
j pre-eminent talents and patriotism which have  
placed you in this diflioguiihcd situation, will ena­

- The interefting detail of thofe events, which have render~  
ed the convention of Congrefs at this time indifpenfible,  
(communicated in your {peech to both houfes) has excited  
in us the ftrongelt emotions. Whilfl we regret the occafiong  
we cannot omit to teftify our approbation ef the meafure,  
and to pledge ourfelves, that no confiderations of private  
inconvenience {hall prevent, on our part, a faithful dif  
charge of the duties to which we are called,  
  
We have conflani!y hoped, that the nations of Europe,  
whilft defolated by foreign wars, or convulfed by intefline  
divifions, would have left the United States to enjoy that  
peace and tranquility, to which the impartial copduét of  
our government has entitled us: and it is now with ex  
treme regret we find the meafures of the French republic  
tending to endanger a fituation fo defirable and interefting  
iO our country.  
  
Upon this occafion, we feel it our duty to exprefs in the  
moft explicit manner, the fenfations which the prefent crifis  
has excited, and to affure you of our zealous co-operation in  
thofe meafures which may appear neceffary for our fecurity  
or peace.  
  
Although it is the firft wifh of our hearts that peace may  
be maintained with the French Republic and with all the  
worid, yet we never will furrender thofe rights which be«  
long to us asa nation ; and, whilfh}we view with fatisfac-  
tion the wifdom, dignity, and moderation, which have  
marked the meafures of the fupreme executive of our coun«  
try, in its attempts to remove, by candid explanations, the  
complaints and jealoufies of France, we feel the full force  
of that indignity which has been offered our country in the  
rejection of its minifter. No attempts to wound our rights  
as a foreign ftate will efcape the notice of our conftituents.  
They will be felt with ps rn and repelled with that  
decifion which fha&#x27;l convince the world that we are not a  
degraded people, that we can never fubmit to the demands  
of s foreign power, without examination, and without dif  
  
Knowing as wedo the covrfidence repofed by the people  
of the United States in their governmenn, we cannot hefitate  
in exprefling our indignation at any {éntiments tending to  
derogate from that confidence. Such fentiments, wher  
ever entertained, ferve’to evence an imperfeét knowledge  
of the opinions of our conftituents. An attempt to fepas  
rate the people of the United Siates from their government,  
isan attempt to feparate them from themfelves, &amp; although  
foreigners, who know rot the genius of our country, may  
have conceived the proje€t, and foreign emuffaries ma  
attempt the execution, yet the united effortsof our fellow  
citizens will convince the world of its impracticability.  
  
Senfibly as we feel the wound which has. been inflifted  
by the tranfaétions difclofed in your communications, yet  
we think with you, that neither the honor nor the intereft of  
the United States forbid the repetition of advances for  
preferving peace, we therefore receive, with the utmoft  
fatisfattion, your information, dat a frefh attempt at ne-  
gociation will he inftituted ; and we cherifh the hope, that  
a mutual fpirit of conciliation, and a difpofition on the  
pert of France, to compenfate for any injuries which may  
  
ve been committed. upon our neutral rights ; &amp; on the par  
of the United States, to place France on grounds fimilar  
to thofe of other countries, in their relation and conneétion.  
with us, if any inequalities fhall be found to cx:ft, will  
duce an accommodation, compatible with the engagements  
rights, duties, and honor, of the United States. F ully,  
-however, impreffed with the uncertainty of the refult, we  
fhall prepare to meet with fortitade any unfavorable event  
that may occur, and to extricate ourfelves from the confe--  
quences with all the {kill we poffefs, and all the efforts im  
our power. Relieving with you, that the conduét of the  
government has been juft and impartial to foreign nations,  
that the laws for the prefervation ef peace have been  
per, and that they have been fairly executed, the reprefen-  
tatives of the people do not hefitate to declare that they wilk  
gre mot cordial {upport to the execution of principles fo  
  
eliberately and uprightly eftablifhed.  
  
The many interefting fubjefts which you have recom-  
mended to our confideration, and which are fo flrongly  
enforced by this momentous occafion, will receive every  
attention which their importance demands ; and we truff,  
that by the decided and explicit condu&amp; which will govern  
our deliberations, every sulin will be repelled which  
is derogatory tothe honor and independence of our coun-  
uy.  
  
’ pctenit us, in offering this addrefs, to eur fatis-  
faction at your promotion to: the firft office in the govern-  
ment, and our entire confidence that the inent ta~  
  
lents and patriotifm which have placed — in this diftin-  
I seong ituation, will enable you to difcharge its. various  
duties with fatisfattion to yourfelf, and advantage to our  
common country.

THE interefling detail of those events,  
which have rendered the convention of  
Congress, at this time, indilpenfible (com­  
municated in your Speech to both Houses)  
has excited in us the firongeft emotions.  
Whilit we regret the occasion, we cannot  
omt to teftify our approbation of the mea­  
sure, and to pledge ourselves that no con­  
siderations of private inconvenience shall  
prevent, on our part, a faithful discharge  
of the duties to which we are called.  
We have constantly hoped, that the na­  
tions of Europe; whillt desolated Ly fo­  
reign wars, or convulsed by intestine divi­  
sions, would have left the United States  
to enjoy that peace and tranquility, to  
which the impartial conduét of our go­  
vernment has entitled us ; and it is now,  
with extreme regret, we find the measures  
of the French Republic tending to endan­  
ger a situation {o desirable and interefling  
to dur country.  
Upon this occasion, we feel it our duty  
to exprels in the most explicit manner,  
the {enfations which the present crisis has  
excited, and to assure you of our zealous  
co-operation&#x27;in those mealures which may  
appear neceflary for our {ecurity or peace.  
Although it 1s the *carneff with of our  
hearts, that peace may be maintained wiih  
the French Republic, and with all the  
world, yet we twill never surrender those  
rights which belong to us as a nation ; and  
whillt we view with fansfaétion the wisdom,  
dignity and’moderation, which have mark­  
ed the mealures of the Supreme Execu­  
tive of our country, in its attempts to re­  
move by candid explanations, the com­  
plaints and jealoufics of France, we feel  
the full force of that indignity which has  
been oftered our country, in the rejeftion  
of its Minister. No attempts to wound  
our rights as a sovereign state will escape  
the notice of our constituents : They will  
be felt with indignation, and repelled with  
that decision which (hall convince the  
- world that we are not a degraded people,  
‘that we can never submit to the demands  
of a foreign power without examination  
and without discussion.  
Knowing as we do the confidegce re­  
posed by the pcople of the Unitg?Sxates  
in their government, we cannot hefirate  
in exprcfﬁnj our indignation et any sen­  
timents temding to derogate from that con­  
fidence. Such {entiments, wherever enter­  
tained, {erve to evince-enimperfe@ know­  
ledge of the opinions of our constituents.  
Au attempt to separate the people of the  
‘United States from their government, is  
an attempt to separate them from them­  
selves ; and although foreigners, who  
+» know not the genius of cur country, may.  
have conceived the projeft, and foreign  
emissaries may attempt the execution, ye

the united efforts of our fellow-citizens  
will convince the world of its impratica­  
bility. - 8  
Sensibly as we feel the wound which  
has been inflified, §6y the tranfaéiions dis- i  
closed in your communications, yetwe think  
with you, that neither the bonor nor the |  
interefl of the United States forbid the- re- i  
petition of advances for preflerving peace.  
\We therefore, recedve, with the umoft fa- ]  
tisfaclion, your imjormation, that a frefli  
attempt at negociation will be inflituted ; }  
and-we cheri/h the hope that a mutual spi­  
rit of concilration, and a difpcfitzon on the !  
part of France to compensate for amy iz~  
Juries which may have been committed upon  
our meutral rights ; and on the part of  
the United Siates, to place France on  
grounds similar to those of otiier countries  
in their relation and conneliion with us, if  
any incqualities fliall be found to exist, will  
produce an accommodation, compatible with  
the engagements, rights, duties, and honor  
of the United States. Fully, however, imi­  
prefled wirh the uncertaioty of the result,  
we shall prepare to meet with fortirude  
any unfavorable events which may occur,  
and to extricate ourselves from their con­  
sequences, with all- the skill we poflefs,  
and all the efforts 10 our power. Beliey.-  
ing with you that the conduit of the go- .  
~vernment has been jult and Impariial 1o  
foreign nations, that the laws for the pre­  
servation of peace have been proper, and  
that they have been fawly execated, the  
Representatives of the People do not hesi­  
tate to declare, that they will give their  
most cordial support to the exccution of  
principles so deliberately and uprightly  
citablifhed. :  
The many interefling fubjef@s which  
you hiave recommended to our considera­  
tion, and which are so flrongly enforced  
by this momentous occasion, will receive  
every attention which their importanee  
demands ; and we trust that by tire deci­  
ded and explicit condué&amp; which will go­  
vern our deliberations, every insinuation  
will be repeiled which is derogatory to  
the honor and independence of our coun­  
try.  
Permit us, 1o offering this Address, to  
express our fatisfaftion at your promo­  
tion to the firft office in the government,  
and our entire confidence that the pre-emi­  
nent talents and patriotism which have  
placed you in this diftinguifbed situation,  
will enable you to discharge its various  
duties with fausfattion to yourlelf and ad­
