Monticello June 10. 1822.  
  
In my letter to you of May 13. in answer to a charge by a person signing himself ‘A Native Virginian’ that on a bill drawn by me for a sum equivalent to 1148.D. the Treasury of the US. had made double payment, I supposed I had done as much as would be required when I shewed they had only returned to me money which I had previously paid into the treasury on the presumption that such a bill had been paid for me: but that this bill, being lost or destroyed on the way, had never been presented, and consequently never paid by the US. and that the money was therefore returned to me. this being too plain for controversy the Pseudo-Native of Virginia in his reply No 32. in the Federal republican of May 24. reduces himself ultimately to the ground of a double reciept of the money by me; 1st on sale or negociation of the bill in Europe, and a 2d time from the treasury. but the bill was never sold or negociated any where. it was not drawn to raise money in the market; I recieved none I sold it to nobody; recieved no money on it, but inclosed it to Grand and co. for some purpose of account; but for what particular purpose neither my memory, after a lapse of 33. years, nor my papers enable me to say. had I preserved a copy of my letter to Grand inclosing it the bill, that would doubtless have explained the purpose.  but it was drawn on the eve of my embarcation with my family from Cowes for America, and probably the hurry of preparation for that did not allow me time to take a copy. I presume this because I find no such letter among my papers. nor does any subsequent correspondence with Grand explain it, because I had no private account with him; my account, as Minister, being kept with the Treasury directly: so that he, recieving no intimation of this bill, could never give me notice of it’s miscarriage. but, however satisfactory might have been an explanation of the purpose of the bill, it is unnecessary at least; the material fact being established that it never got to hand, nor was ever paid by the US.  
  
And how does the Native Virginian maintain his charge that I recieved the cash when I drew the bill? by unceremoniously inserting, into the entry of that article in my account, words of his own, making me say in direct terms that I did recieve the cash for the bill. in my account rendered to the Treasury it is entered in these words ‘1789. Oct. 1. By my bill on Willincks, Van-Staphorsts &amp; Hubbard in favor of Grand and co. for 2800 flor.—equal to 6230 livres–18 sous.’ but he quotes it as stated in my account rendered to and settled at the Treasury, and yet remaining, as it is to be presumed, among the archives of that department “By cash recieved of Grand for bill on Willincks Etc” now the words expression words ‘cash recieved of Grand’ is constitute ‘the very point the pivot on which the matter turns’ as himself says and and not finding, he has furnished them. although the interpolation of them is sufficiently refuted by the fact that Grand was, at the time, in France, and myself in England, but yet wishing that conviction of the interpolation should be founded on official document, I wrote to the Auditor, mr Harrison, requesting an official certificate of the very words in which that article stood in my autograph account deposited in the office. I recieved on the 9th yesterday his answer of the 3d in which he says ‘I am unable to furnish the extract you require, as the original account rendered by you of your pecuniary transactions of a public nature in Europe, together with the vouchers &amp; documents connected with it, were all destroyed in the Register’s office, in the memorable conflagration of 1814. with respect therefore to the sum of 1148.D. in question, I can only say that, after full and repeated examinations, I considered you as most righteously and justly entitled to recieve it. otherwise, it will, I trust, be believed that I could not have consented to the repayment.’ considering the intimacy which the Native Virginian shews with the Treasury affairs, we might be surely justified in suspecting that he knew this fact of the destruction of the original by fire when he adventured to mis-quote. it. otherwise we might but certainly we may call on him to say, and to shew, from what original he copied these words ‘cash recieved from Grand’? I say most certainly assuredly from none, for none such ever existed. altho’ the original be lost, which would have convicted him officially, it happens that when I made from my rough-draught, a fair copy of my account for the Treasury, I took also, with a Copying machine a press-copy of every page, which I kept for my own use. it is known that copies by this well-known machine, are taken by impression, on damped paper, laid on the face of the written page while fresh, and past thro’ between rollers—as copper plates are. they must therefore be true fac-similes. this press-copy now lies before me has been shewn to several persons, &amp; will be shewn to as many as wish or are willing to examine it; and this article of my account is entered in it in these words ‘1789. Oct. 1. By my bill on Willincks, Van-Staphorsts and Hubbard for 2800. fl. equal to 6230. livres 18. sous.’ an inspection of the acct too shews that whenever I recieved cash on for a bill, it is uniformly entered ‘by cash recd of such an one Etc’ but where a bill was drawn to constitute an item of acct only the entry is ‘by my bill on Etc’ Now to these very words ‘Cash recieved of Grand,’ not in my original, but interpolated by himself, he constantly appeals as proofs of an acknolegement under my own hand that I recieved the cash. in proof of this I must request the patience to read the following quotations from his denunciations as standing in the Federal republican of May. 24.  
page 2. Column 2. l. 48. to 29. from the bottom. ‘he [mr J.] admits in his account rendered in 1790. and settled in 1792. that he had recieved the ‘cash’ [placing the word cash between inverted commas to have it marked particularly as a quotation] that he had recieved the ‘cash’ for the bill in question, and he does not directly deny it now. will he, can he, in the face of his own declaration in writing to the contrary, publicly say that he did not recieve the money for this bill in Europe? this is the point on which the whole matter rests, the pivot on which the argument turns. if he did recieve the money in Europe (no matter whether at Cowes or at Paris) he certainly had no right to recieve it a second time from the public treasury of the US. this is admitted I believe on all sides. now that he did recieve the money in Europe on this bill is proved by the acknolegement of the reciever himself, who credits the amount in his account, as settled at the Treasury thus “cash recieved of Grand for bill on Willincks &amp; Van Staphorsts 2876. gilders=1148. Dollars.”’  
Col. 3. l. 28. to 21. from bottom. ‘there is a plain difference in the phraseology of the account from which an Extract is given by mr J. as above, and that which he rendered to the Treasury. in the former he gives the credit thus ‘By my bills on Willincks Etc.’ in the latter he states “By cash recieved of Grand for bill on Willincks Etc.”’ I say truly there is a difference. but what makes it? indeed as he states it, but it is made solely by his own interpolation.  
Col. 2 3. p l. 8. from bottom. ‘that mr Jefferson should, in the very teeth of the facts of the evidence before us, and in his own breast, gravely say that he had paid the money for this bill, &amp; that therefore it was but just to return him the amount of it, when he had by his own acknolegement sent it to Grand &amp; co. and recieved the money for it, is, I confess, not only matter of utter astonishment but of regret.’ I spare myself the qualifications which these paragraphs may merit, leaving them to be applied by every reader according to the feelings they may excite in his own breast.  
He proceeds ‘And now to place this case beyond the reach of cavil or doubt, &amp; to shew most conclusively that he had  negociated this bill in Europe, and recieved the cash for it there and that such was the understanding of the matter at the treasury in 1809. when he recieved the money,’ these are his own words Col. 4. he then brings forward the overwhelming fact ‘not hitherto made public but stated from the most creditable and authentic source that one of the accounting officers of the treasury suggested in writing the propriety of taking bond &amp; security from mr J. for indemnification of the US. against any future claim on this bill—but it seems the bond was not taken, and the government is now liable in law, and in good faith for the payment of this bill to the rightful owner.’ how this suggestion of taking bond at the treasury, so solemnly paraded, is more conclusive proof than his own interpolation, that the cash was recieved, I am so dull as not to percieve, but I say that had the suggestion been made to me, it should have been instantly complied with. but I deny his law. were the bill now to be presented to the Treasury, the answer would &amp; should be the same as a merchant would give. ‘you have held up this bill three and thirty years without notice: in we have settled in the mean time with the drawer, and have no effects of his left in our hands. apply to him for payment.’ on his application to me, I should first enquire into the history of the bill; where it had been lurking for three and thirty years? how came he by it? by interception? by trover? by assignment from Grand? by purchase? from whom, when &amp; where? and according to his answers I should either institute criminal process against him, or if he shewed that all was fair and honest, I should pay him the money, and look for reimbursement to the quarter appearing liable.   the law deems 7. years of absence of a man, without being heard of, such presumptive evidence of his death, as to distribute his estate, and to allow his wife to marry again. the Auditor thought that 20. years non appearance of a bill which had been risked thro’ the post offices of two nations, was sufficient presumption of it’s loss. but this ‘N self styled Native of Virginia thinks that the 33. years now elapsed are not sufficient. be it so. if the accounting officers of the Treasury have any uneasiness on that subject, I am ready to give a bond of indemnification to the US. in any sum the officers will name and with the security which themselves shall approve. will this satisfy the Native Virginian? or will he now try to pick some other hole in this transaction, to shield himself from a candid acknolegement, that in making up his case, he supplied by gratuitous conjectures, the facts which were not within his knolege, and that thus he has sinned against truth in his delations before the public? be this as it may, I have so much confidence in the discernment &amp; candor of my fellow citizens, as to leave to their judgment, and dismiss from my own notice any future torture of words or circumstances which this writer may devise for their deception. indeed could such a denuntiation, and on such evidence proof, bereave me of that confidence &amp; consolation, I should, thro’ the remainder of life, brood over the afflicting belief that I had lived &amp; labored in vain.

MONTICF.LLO, JUNE 10,1822  
Messrs. Ritchie 15* tiocch—— In my let  
ter to you ot May 13, in answer to a  
charge by a person signing himself a ‘Na­  
tive of Virginia,’ that,on a bill drawn by  
me for a sum equivalent to 1148 dollars,  
&#x27;he treasury of the U. States had made  
double payment, i supposed l had done  
as much as would be* required, when I  
shewed that they had only returned to  
i l,le money which I had previously paid  
into the treasury, on the presumption that  
such a bill had been paid for me; but  
toat this bid, being lost or destroyed on  
the way, had never been presented, con­  
sequently never paid by the. U. JSutes.  
:&lt;nrl ill&#x27;ll fllA __ . 1_  
  
-wiviuuic return  
fcd to me* This being too plain for con  
troversy, the Escudo Native of Virginia  
in bis leply, No, 32 in the Federal Ite­  
publican of May 2d, reduces himself ul  
timatply to the ground of a double re  
ceifit of the money by me, 1st, on sale o.  
uegociation of the bill in Europe, and a  
second time from the treasury. But the  
hill was never sold or negociated any  
where $ it was not drawn to raise money  
m the market ; 1 sold it to nobody, re  
ceived no money on it, but inclosed it to  
Grand &amp; Co. for some purpose of ac.  
count, lor what particular pu pose, neith­  
er my memory, after a lapse of 33 years  
nor my papers enable me to say. Had i  
preserved a copy of my letter&#x27;to Grand  
inclosing the bill, that would doubtless  
have explained the purpose. But it was  
drawn on the eve ol my embarcation  
with my family from Cowes Tor Ameri­  
ca, and probably the lurry of prepara­  
tion for that did not alow me time to  
take a copy. I presume this, because 1  
hod no such letter among my papers; nor  
aoes any subsequent cornapomWc with  
Grand explain it ; because! had no pii­  
vate account with, him, rw account, as  
minister, being kept with the treasury  
directly : so that he receivhg no intima­  
tion of this bill, could neve* give me no­  
tice of its miscarriage. Bu, however sa­  
tisfactory might have beei an explana­  
tion of the purpose of the bill, it is unne­  
cessary at least, the material fact being  
establised that it never got to hand, nor  
was ever paid by the V. States  
And how does the native of Virginia  
maintain his charge that { received the  
cash when I drew the bill ? By uncere­  
moniously inserting into this&gt;ntry of that  
article in my account, word* of hia own,  
making me say in direct terms that I did  
receive the cash for the bill. In my ac­  
count rendered to the treasury, it en.  
  
tered in these words, &lt;!T89, Oct. 1. »By  
my bill on Wiliinks, Van Staphorsts and  
Hubbard in favor of Grand Co. for  
2800 florins, equal to 6230 livres 18  
sous:* but he quotes it as stated in my  
account rendered to, and settled at the  
treasury, and yet remaining, as it is to  
be presumed, among the archives of  
that department. *By caah received oy  
Grand for bill on Wiliinks, Vc.&quot; Now  
the words *caah received of Grand’ con*  
atilute ‘the veiy point, (he pivot on which  
the matter turns/ as he himself says, and  
not finding, he has furnised them, altho’  
the interpolation or them is sufficiently  
refuted by the fact that Grand was, at the  
time, in France, and mysell in England.  
Yet wishing that conviction of the inter­  
polation should be founded on official  
document, l wrote to the auditor, Mr.  
Harrison, requesting an official certifi  
cate of the very -worda in which that ar­  
ticle stood in my autograph account de­  
posited in the office. I received ycsler­  
day his answer of the 3d, in which he says  
•1 am unable to furnish the extract you  
require, as the original account rendered  
by you of your pecuniary transactions of  
a public nature in Europe, together with  
the vouchers and documents connected  
with it, were all destroyed in the Regis­  
ter&#x27;s office, in the memorable conflagra­  
tion of 1814. With respect, therefore,  
to the sum of 1148 dollars in question, i  
can only say, that after full and repeated  
examinations, I considered you as most  
righteously and justly entitled to receive  
it Otherwise it will, I trust, be believed  
that ! could not have consented to the  
re-payment.’ Considering the intimacy  
which the Native of Virginia shews with  
the treasury affairs, we might be justified  
in suspecting that he knew this fact of the  
destruction ol the original by tire, when  
he ventured to mivquote ; but certainly  
we may call on him to say, and to shew  
ftom what original he copied these words  
  
‘cash received of Orand v I say most  
assuredly, from none : for none such e­  
ver existed. Although the original be  
lost, which would have convicted him of­  
ficially, it happens that when 1 made,  
from my rough draught, a fair copy of  
my account i&#x27;or the treasury, I took also,  
with a copying machine, a press-copy of  
every page, which I kept tor my own  
own use. It is known that copies by this  
well known machine, are taken by im­  
pression, on damp paper, laid on the face  
of the written page while fresh, and past­  
ed between rollers, as copperplates  
are. They must therefore be true fac  
similes. This press copy now lies before  
me, has been shewn to several persons  
Sc will be shewn to as many as wish,or are  
willing to examine it; t5*this article of my  
account is entered in it in these words ;  
‘1789, Oct. 1. By my bill on VYillinks,  
&#x27;&#x27;an Staphorsts and Hubbard, 2800 flo­  
rins equal to 6250 livres 18 sous.’ An  
inspection of the account too shews that  
whenever I received cash for a bill, it is  
uniformly entered ‘by cash received of  
such an one, t7c » but where a bill was  
drawn to constitute an item of accoun’  
only, the entry is ‘by my bill on, tfc.»—  
Now to these very words ‘cash received  
of (irand,’ not in my original, but inter­  
polated by himself, he constantly appeals  
as proofs of an acknowledgment, under  
my own hand, that 1 received the cash.  
In proof of this, I must request patience  
to read the following quotations from his  
denunciations, as standing in the Federal  
Republican of May 24.  
Page 2, column 2, line 48 to 29 from  
the bottom,‘he [Mr. J ] admits in his ac­  
count rendered in 1790 and settled in  
1792, that he had received the cash [pla­  
cing the word cash between inverted  
CfimmAA. fn StlVP it mo r»A r»*. I _ _ I  
  
as a quotation,&#x27;] that he had received the  
‘ca«/i,&#x27; ior the bill in question, and tie does  
n t deny it directly now. Will he, can  
tie, in the face of his own declaration in  
writing to the contrary, publicly sav that  
he did not receive the money for this bill  
in Europe ? This is the point, on which  
the whole matter rests, the pivot on  
which the argument turns. If he did re­  
ceive the money in Europe (no matter  
whether at Cowes or at Pari?) he certain­  
ly had no right to receive it a second  
ime from the public treasury of the U.  
States. This is admitted, I believe, on  
all sides ; now that he did receive the mo  
ney in Europe on this bill is proved by  
the acknowledgment cf the receiver him­  
self, who credits the amount in his ac­  
count, as settled at the treasury thus  
‘cash received of Grand for bill on Wil­  
lin&#x27;-ks and Van Staphorts 2876 gilders_  
I 148 dollars.*  
Col. 3 1. 28 to 21. from bottom‘there  
is a plain difference in the phraseology of  
the account from which an extract is giv­  
en by Mr. J as above, and that which he  
rendered to the treasury. In the former  
he gives the credit thus, ‘b&gt; my bill on  
Willincks, tfc,* In the latter he states,  
•by cash received of Grand for bill on  
V\ illincks t7c.* I here is a difference  
indeed, as he states if, but it is made sole­  
ly by his own interpolation.  
Col 3, I, 8 from bottom, ‘that Mr. Jef­  
ferson should, in the very teeth of the  
Iact9 of the evidence before us, and in his  
own breast, gravely say that he had paid  
the money for this bill, and that therelore  
it was but just to return him the amount  
of if, when he had by hit own acknow­  
ledgment sent it to Grand and Co. and  
received the money for it, is, I confess,  
not only a matter of utter astonishment,  
hut of regret.’ I spare myself the quali­  
fications which these paragraphs may  
merit, leaving them to be applied by eve­  
ry reader according to tho feelings they  
inay excite in his own breast.  
He proceeds | ‘and now to place this  
  
case bevond the reach of cavil or doubt*  
and to shew most conclusively that he had  
negociatcd this bill in Europe, and re­  
ceived the cash for it there, and that such  
was the understanding of the matter at  
the treasury in 1809, when he received  
the money’ (these are his own words,)  
Col. 4, he brings forward the overwhelm­  
ing fact -&#x27;not hitherto made public, but  
stated from the most creditable and au­  
thentic source, that one or the accounting  
officers of the treasury suggested in wri­  
ting. the propriety of taking bond and se­  
curity from Mr* J. for indemnification of  
the United States against any future claim  
on this bill* But it seems the bond was  
not taken, and the government is now lia­  
ble in la tv, and in good faith, for the pay*  
ment of this bill to the rightful owner.*  
How this suggestion of taking a bond at  
the treasury, so solemnly paraded, is  
more conclusive firooft than disown in­  
terpolation, »hat the cash was received |  
am so dull as not to perceive. But 1 say  
tnat had the suggestion been made to me  
it should have been instantly complied  
with. But 1 deny his law. Were this  
bill now to be presented to the tieasury  
the answer would, and should be the  
same as a merchant would give : ‘You  
have held up this bill three and thirty  
years, without notice ; we have settled in  
the mean time with the drawer, and have  
no effects of his left in our hands. Ap­  
ply to him for payment.’ On his applica­  
tion to me, I should first inquire into the*  
Idstory of the bill, where it has been |Ui k­  
ing for three and thirty years? Hovv  
came he by it ? By interception ? By  
trover ? By assignment from Grand ? By  
purchase ? From whom, when and where?  
And according to his answers, 1 should  
either institute criminal process against  
him, or if he should 6hew that all was  
fair and hr.ncst, 1 should pay him the mo­  
ney, and look for reimbursement to the  
| quarter appealing liable. The law deems  
KPVPn vparu Alupnrp nf _ . •  
  
ing heard of, such presumptive evidence  
of his death, as to distribute his estate  
and to allow his wife to marry again. The  
auditor thought that twenty years non-ap­  
pearance of a bill, which had been risked  
through the post offices of two nations,  
was sufficient presumption of its |0S3.  
This self-styled Native Virginian thinks  
that the thirty-three years now elapsed  
are not sufficient. Be it so. If the ac­  
counting officers of the treasury have any  
uneasiness on that subject, I am ready u&gt;  
give a bond of indemnification to the U.  
Mates in any sum the officers will name,  
and with the security which themselves  
shall approve. Will this satisfy the Na­  
tive Virginian ? Or will he now try to pick  
some other hole in this transaction, to  
shield himself from a candid acknowl­  
edgment that, in making up his case, he  
supplied, by gratuitous conjectures, the  
facts which were not within his know­  
ledge, and that thus he has sinned against  
truth in his declarations before the public.  
Be this as it may, l have so much confi­  
dence in the discernment and candor of  
my fellow citizens, as to leave to their  
judgment, and to dismiss from my own &#x27;  
notice, any future torture of words or cir­  
cumstances which this writer may devise  
for their deception. Indeed, could such  
a denunciation, and on such prool, be­  
reave me of that confidence and consola­  
tion, l should through the remainder of  
life brood uvei the aillicting evidence that  
1 had lived and labored in vain.

Jifonticcllo, June 10, 1822.  
Messrs Ritchie 8c Gooch-—I n my letter to you  
or May 13, in answer to a charge by a person sign­  
ing himself—&#x27; A Native Virginian,&#x27; that on a bill  
drawn by me for a sum equivalent to 1148 dollars,  
the treasury oT the U. States had made double pay­  
ment, 1 supposed I had done as much as would be  
required, when I shewed that they had only return­  
ed to me money which I had previously paid into  
the treasury, on the presumption that such a bill  
had been paid for me; but that this bill, being lost  
or destroyed on the way, had never been presented,  
consequently never paid by the United States ; and  
that the money was therefore returned to me. This  
being too plain for controversy, the Pseudo-Native  
of Virginia, in his reply, No. 32 in the Federal Re­  
publican of May 24, reduces himself ultimately to  
the ground of a double receipt of the money by me ;  
first, on sale or négociation of the bill in Europe,  
and a second time from the treasury. But the bill  
was never sold or negociated any where ; it was not  
drawn to raise money in the market ; 1 sold it to  
nobody, received no money on it, but enclosed it to  
Grand 8. Co. for some purpose of account—for  
what particular purpose, neither my memory, alter  
a lapse of tiiirty three years, nor my papers enable  
me to say. Had I preserved a copy of my letter to  
Grand inclosing the bill, that would doubtless have  
explained the purpose. But it was drawn on the  
eve of my embarkation with my family from Cowes  
lor America, and probably the hurry of preparation  
for that did not allow me time to take a copy. I  
presume this because I find no such letter among  
nty papers ; nor does any subsequent correspond  
ence with Grand explain it; because I had no pri­  
vate account with him, my account as minister be­  
ing kept with the treasury directly ; so that he, re­  
ceiving no intimation of this bill, could ntver give  
me notice of its miscarriage- But however satis  
factory might have been an explanation ol the pur­  
pose of the&#x27; hill, it is unnecessary at least, the mate­  
rial fact being established that it never got to hand,  
nor was ever paid by the United Stales­  
And how does the Native Virginian maintain his  
charge that I received the cash when I drew the  
bill ? By unceremoniously inserting into this entry  
of that article in my account, words of his own ;  
making me say in direct terms that I did receive  
the cash for the bill. In my account rendered to  
the treasury, it is enteVed in these words, •* 1 1 b9&gt;  
Oct. 1 :—By my bill on Willinks, Van Staphorsts  
8: Hubbard, in favor of Grand 8c Co. for 2800 fio­  
but he quotes it  
vins. equal to 6230 livres 18 sous:  
as stated in my account rendered to, and settled at  
the treasury, and yet remaining, as is to be presum­  
ed, among the archives of that department :—&quot; By  
cash received of Grand for bill on Willinks, 8cc.  
Now the words —cash received of Grand constitute  
&#x27;the very point, the pivot on which the matter turns  
as he himself says ; and not finding, he has furnish­  
ed them, although the interpolation of them is suf  
liciently refuted by the fact, that Grand was at the  
time in France and myself in Englanu. ^el wish­  
ing that conviction of the interpolation should be  
lounded on official document, I wrote to the Audi­  
tor, Mr Harrison, requesting an official certificate  
of the very words in which that article stood in my  
autograph account deposited in the office. I receiv­  
ed yesterday his answer of the 3d, in which he says  
&quot; 1 am unable to furnish the extract you require, as  
the original account rendered by you of your pecu­  
niary transactions of a public nature in Europe, to­  
gether with the vouchers and documents connected  
with it, were all destroyed in the register s office, in  
the memorable conflagration of 1814. W ith res­  
  
j pect therefore, (o the sum of 1148 dollars in qucs­  
lion, I can only say &#x27;hat after full and repeated ex­  
&#x27;aminations, I considered you as most righteously  
and i u3t| y entitled to receive it. Otherwise it will,  
trus, i l,e believed that I could not have consented  
t0 ,be repayment.&quot; Considering the intimacy  
which the Native Virginian shews with the treasu­  
O&#x27; aflTairs, we might be justified in suspecting that  
be knew tllls fact of lhe destruction of the original  
b )[ &quot; re - when he ventured to misquote ; but  
to. ta,n, Y we may call on him to say and to shew from  
what original lie copied these words, • Cash receiv­  
°* Grand.? I say most assuredly from none—  
»or none such ever existed. Although the original  
&#x27; ost * which would have conviced him officially, it  
ha PP en * that when I made from my rough draught,  
a afair c °Py ° f ™Y account for the treasury, I took  
also &lt; with a copying machine, • press-copy of every  
P a R c &gt; which I kept for ray own use. It is known  
&#x27; ba ! copies by this well known machine are taken  
b y *mpression, on damp paper, laid on the face of

] be true &#x27; ac similes. This press-copy now lies be­

| be ®bewn to as many as wish, or are willing to ex­

|u ra wii to constitute an item ol account only, the  
enlr y ,3 &gt; &#x27; &quot;Y j bll J ° n *&lt;••&#x27; Now to these very words  
caab rec e iv ed of Grand, not in my original, but  
interpolated b 7 himself, he constantly appeals as  
proofsof an acknowledgement, under mu own hand,  
that I received the cash. In proof of this I must re­  
quest patience, to read the following quotations from  
his denunciations, as standing in the Federal Re­  
publican of May 24.  
Page 2, column 2, line 48 to 29 from the bottom,  
he [Mr. J ] admits in his account rendered in  
1790 and settled in 1792, that he had received the  
cash [placing the word cash between inverted com­  
mas, to have it marked particularly as a quotation]  
that he had received the 1 cash&#x27; for the bill in ques­  
tion, and he does not deny it directly now. Will  
he, can he, in the face of his own declaration in writ­  
ing to the contrary, publicly say that he did not re­  
ceive the money for litis bill in Europe ? This is the  
point on which the whole matter rests, the pivot on  
which the argument turns. If he did receive the  
money in Europe (no matter whether at Gowes or  
at Pai is) he certainly had no right to receive it a  
second lime from the public treasury of the U. States  
This is admitted I believe, on all sides j now that  
he did receive the money in Europe on this bill, is  
proved by the acknowledgement of the receiver him­  
self, who credits the amount in his account, as set­  
tled at the treasury, thus— &quot;cash received of Grand  
for bill on Willinks and Van Staphorsts, 2876 gild  
ers—1148 dollars.&quot;  
Col.3,1. 28 to21 from bottom—&quot;there is a plain  
difference in the phraseology of the account from  
which an extract is given by Mr. J., as above,  
and that which he rendered to the treasury. In the  
former, he gives the credit thus :—* By my bill on  
Willinks, &amp;c.  
ceivcd of Grand for bill on Willinks See  
is a difference indeed, as he states it, but it is made  
solely by his own interpolation.  
Col. 3, I. 8 from bottom,—&quot; That Mr Jefferson  
should, inlthe very teeth of the facts of the evidence  
before us and in his own breast, gravely say that he  
had paid the money for this bill, and that therefore  
it was but just to return him the amount of it, when  
he had by his own acknowledgement sent it to Grand  
8c Co. and received the money for it, is I confess, not  
only a matter of astonishment, but of regret,  
spare mvself the qualifications which these para­  
graphs may merit, leaving them to be applied by  
every reader, according to the feelings they may  
excite in his own breast.  
He proceeds—&quot; and now to place this case beyond  
the reach of cavil or doubt, and to show most con­  
clusively that he had negociated this bill in Europe,  
and received the cash for it there, and that such was  
the understanding of the matter at the treasury in  
1809, when he received the money&quot; (these are his  
own words ;) Col. 4, he brings forward the over­  
whelming fact &quot;not hitherto made public, but stat­  
ed from the most creditable and authentic source,—  
that one of the accounting officers of the treasury  
suggested in writing, the propriety of taking bond  
and security from Mr J. for indemnification of the  
United States against any future claim on this bill.  
But it seems the bond was not taken, and the gov­  
ernment is now liable in law and in good faith, for  
the payment of this bill to the rightful owner.&quot;—  
How this suggestion of taking a bond at the treas­  
ury, so solemnly paraded, is more conclusive proof  
than his own interpolation that the cash was receiv­  
ed, I am so dull as not to perceive. But I say that  
had the suggestion been made to me, it should have  
been instantly complied with. But I deny his law  
Were this bill now to be presented to the treasury,  
the answer would and should be the same as a mer­  
chant would give : &quot; you have held up this bill three  
and thirty years, without notice ; we have settled in  
the mean time with the drawer, and have no effects  
of his left in our hands Apply to him for payment.&quot;  
On his application to me, I should first enquire in­  
to the history of the bill, where it has been lurking  
for three and thirty years ? How came he by it ?  
By interception ? (By trover ? By assignment from  
Grand ? By purchase ? From whom, when and  
where ? And according to his answers, I should  
either institute criminal process against him, or, if  
he should show that all was fair and honest, I should  
pay him the money and look for reimbursement to  
lhe quarter appearing liable. The law deems seven  
years&#x27; absence of a man, without being heard of,  
such presumptive evidence of his death, as to dis­  
tribute his estate and to allow his wife to marry  
again. The Auditor thought that twenty years non­  
appearance of a bill which had been risked through  
the post offices of two nations, was sufficient pre­  
sumption of its loss. This self styled Native Vir­  
ginian thinks that the thirty three years now elaps­  
ed are not sufficient. Be it so. If the accounting  
officers of the treasury have any uneasiness on that  
subject, I am ready to give a bond of indemnifica­  
tion to the United States, in any sum the officers  
will name, and with the security which themselves  
will approve. Will this satisfy the Native Virgin­  
ian ? Or will he now try to pick some other hole in  
this transaction, to shield himself from a candid a

con&#x27;scqucntly nerer paid by the V. S. and  
that the money was therefore returned to

of a tlmble receipt of the money by me, 1st,

therefore returned to mec. This being téo  
plain for controver{y, the Pseudo Native of  
Virginia. in his reply No. 32, in the Feder­  
al Republican of May 24, reduces himfelf  
nitimately to the ground of double receipt of  
the money by me, lit, on sale or negocia­  
tion of the bill in Europe, and a second time  
fromthe treasury. PRut the bi!l was neverfold  
or negociated 71 v where ; ¢ was not drawn  
to raise money in the market 5 I fold it to  
nobody, received go-fnoney on it, but en.  
clofgd it 10 Craud &amp; Co. for some purpose  
et Sccount, v what particular purpose,  
geither my werysafter a laple of 88 years,  
Dor i tepers enable me to fay. Had I pre.-  
‘wrved 4 copy of ‘my letter to Grand, enclo­  
cao the Lill, that would doubtless have  
e«plzined the purpose. But it was drawn  
on the eve of my embarkation with my fam.  
ily from Cowes for America, and probably  
the burry of preparation foi that did not al.  
low me time to take a copy. 1 presume  
this, because I iind no such letter among my  
papers ; nordoes any subsequent correspon­  
dence with Grand explain it ; because I  
had no private account with him,my account,  
as minister, being kept with the treasury di­  
re€ly ; so that he receiving no intimation of  
this bill, could never give me notice of its  
miscarriage. But, however fatisfa&amp;ory  
might have been an explanation of the pur­  
pose of the bill, it is unnecceffary at least,  
the material fa@ being established that it  
never got to hand, nor was ever paid by the  
United States.  
  
And how does the Native of Virginia  
_maintain his charge that I received the cath  
when I drew the bill ? By unceremoniously  
infertivg into this entry of that article in my  
account, ewords of his own, making me fay  
in dire@ terms that I did receive the cash  
for the bill. In my account rendered to the  
treasury, it is entered in these words,  
“ 1789, O&amp;. 1. By my bill on Willinks,  
Van Staphorfts, and Hubbard in favor of  
Grand &amp; Co. for 2800 florins; equal to  
6230 litres 18 sous ;&gt; but he quotes it as  
stated in my account rendered to, and fettled  
at the treafary, and yet remaining, as it is  
to be presumed, among the archives of that  
department. “By cafb received of Grand  
for bill on Willinks, &amp;c.”” Now the words  
“cash received of Grand,”’ constitute ¢ the  
very point, the pivot on which the matter  
turns,’ as he himfelf fays, and not finding,  
he has furnithed them, although the intere  
polation of them is fufficiently refuted by  
the fa&amp; that Grand was, at the time, in  
France, and myfelf in England. Yet, with.  
ing that conviion of the interpolation  
should be founded on official document, I  
wrote to the auditor, Mr. Harrison, reque@.  
ing an official certificate of the wery words  
in which that article stood in my autograph  
account deposited in the office. I received  
yesterday his answer of the sd, in which he  
fays lam unable to furnith the extra&amp;  
yoeu require, as the original account render­  
ed by you of your pecuriary tranfalions of  
a public nature in Europe, together with  
the vouchers and documents conne&amp;ed with  
it, were all defiroyed in the register’s office,  
in the memorable conflagration of 1814.—  
With refpe@, therefore, to the sum of 1148  
dollars in question, I can only fay, that as.  
ter full and repeated examinations, [ consid­  
ered you as most righteously and justly en.  
titled to receive it. Otherwise it will, I  
trust, be believed that I could not have con.  
fented to the re-payment.” Considering  
the intimacy which the Native of Virginia  
shews with the treasury affairs, we might be  
juftified in fulpe&amp;ing that he knew this fak  
of the defiru@ion of the original by fire  
when he ventured to misquote ; but certain.  
ly we may call on him to fay 2nd thew from  
what original hie copied these words, ¢ cash  
  
received of Grand?”’ 1 fay most assuredly  
Jrom npone: for none such ever existed —  
Although the original be loft, which would  
have convifled bim officially, it happens  
that when I made, from my rough draught,  
a fair copy of my account for the treasury,  
I rook a&#x27;fo, with acopying machine, a press  
copy of every page, which I kept for my  
own ufé. It is known that copies by this  
well known -machine, are takeo by impref.  
fion, on damp paper,laid on the face of the  
written page while frefh, and passed between  
_rollers, as copperplates are. They wult  
therefore be true sac fimilies. This press  
, copy nuw lies before me, has been shewn to  
{everal persons, and will be thewn to as many  
as with,or are willing to examine it ; and this  
article of my account is entered in these  
worde: * 1789, O&amp;.1. By my bill on  
Willinks, ‘Van Staphorfts, and Hubbard,  
2800 florins equal to 6230 livres 18 sous.”  
An infpe&amp;ion of the accovnt too shews that  
whenever [ received caf for a bill, it is uni  
formly entered ¢by cath received of such  
an one, &amp;c.”’ sbut where a bill was drawn  
to conflitute an item of actouat only, the  
eotry is *by my bill on, &amp;c.” Now to  
  
these very words *“ cath received of Grand,”  
not in my original, but interpolated by him.  
{elf, he constantly appeals aé proofs of an  
acknowledgmert, under my oawn hand, that 1  
received the cafb. In proof of this, I must  
requelt patience to read the following quo­  
tations from his denunciations, as standing in  
the Federal Republican of May 24.  
Page 2, column 2, line 48 to 29 from  
the bottom, ¢ he [Mr. J.] admits in his ac.  
count rendered in 1790 and fettled in 1792,  
that he had received the cafb, [placing the  
word cafb between inverted commas, to have  
it marked particularly as a quotation, ] that  
he had received the **.cafb,”’ for the bill in  
queltion, and he does not deny it dire&amp;ly  
now. Will he, can he, in the face of his  
own declaration in wwriting to the contrary,  
publicly fay that he did not receive the mon­  
ey for this bill in Europe? This is the  
point on which the whole matter rests, the  
pivot en which the argument turns. If he  
did receive the money in Europe, (no mat.  
ter whether at Cowes or at Paris,) he cer­  
tainly had no right to receive it a second  
time from the public treasury of the United  
States. This is admitted, I believe, on all  
sides ; now that bes did reccive the money in  
Europe on this bill is proved by Ibe ac.  
knowledgement of the receiver himfelf, who  
credits the amount in his account, as fettled  
at the treasury thus ¢ cafb received of Grand  
for bill on Willinks and Van Staphorts  
2876 gilders——ll4B dollara.”  
- Col. 8,1, 28 to 21 from bottom, ** there  
is a plain difference in the phraseology of  
the account from which an extraé is given  
by Mr. J. as above, and that avhish be ren.  
dered to the treasury.” In the former he gives  
the credit thus,by my bill on Willincks, &amp;c.”’  
In the latter he states, *“ by cafb received of  
Grand for bill on Willinks, &amp;c.”” There  
is a difference indeed, as he states it, but it  
is made solely by his own interpolatien.  
  
Col. 3,1, 8 from bottom, * that Mr.  
Jefferfon should, in the very teeth of the  
faQs of the evidence before us, and in his  
own breast, gravely fay that he had paid  
the money for this bill, and that therefore it  
was but jult to return him the amount of it,  
when be had &amp;y bis own acknowledgemens  
sent it to Grand &amp; Co. and reccived the mo­  
ney for it, i 3, 1 confels, not only a matter of  
utter aftonithment, but of regret.’” 1 spare  
mylelf the qualifications which these para.  
graphs may merit, leaving them to be ap.  
plied by every reader according to the feel­  
ings they may excite in his own breast.  
He proceeds ; **and now to place this  
case beyond the reach of cavil or deubt, and  
to thew mofl conclusively that he bad nego.  
ciated this bill in Europe, and received the  
¢afb for it there, and that such was the un.  
derftanding of the matter at the treasury in  
1809, when he received the money,” (thele  
are his own words, ) col. 4 he brings forward  
the overwhelming fa&amp;, *¢ not hitherto made |  
public, but stated from the most creditable  
and avthentic source that one of the ac.  
counting officers of the treasury suggested  
in writing, the propriety of taking bond and  
security from Mr. J. for indemnification of l  
the United States against any future claim  
on this bill. But it seems the bond was  
not taken, and the government is now liable  
in /aw, and in good faith, for the payment ’  
of this bill to the rightful owner.”” How  
this suggestion of taking a bond at the  
treasury, so solemnly paraded, is more con­  
clusive proof, than bis own interpolation,  
that the cafb was received, 1 am so dull as  
not to perceive. But I fay that had the  
suggestion been made to me, it should have  
been instantly complied with. But I deny  
his Jaw. Were this bill now to be present.  
ed to the treasury, the answer would and  
should be the fame ae a merchant would  
give: * You have held up this bill three  
and thirty years, without notice ; we have  
fettled in the mean time with the drawer,  
and have no effe@s of his in our hands.—  
Apply to him for payment.”” On his ap­  
plication to me, I should firft inquire into  
the biftory of the bill, where it has been  
lurking for three and thirty years ? How  
came he byit. By interception? By tro.  
ver? By aflignment from Grand ? By  
purchase? From whom, when and where ?  
And according to his answers, I should  
either institute criminal process against him,  
or if he should shew that all was fair and  
honest. I should pay him the mones, and  
look for reimbursement to the quarter ap.  
pearing liable. The law deems seven years  
absence of a man, without being heard of,  
such presumptive evidence of his death, as  
to distribute his estate, and to allow his wife  
to marry again. - The auditor thought that  
twenty years non-appearance of a bill, which  
had been risked throngh the post offices of  
two nations, was {ufficient presumption of  
its loss. - This felf ffyled Native Virginian  
thinks that the thirty three years now.  
elapsed are not fufficient. Beit so. If the  
accounting officers of the treasury have any  
uneasiness on that fubje&amp;, I am ready to  
give a bond of indemnitication to the United  
States in any {fum the officers will-nawe, and  
with the security which themselves shall ap.  
prove. Will this fatisfy the Native Virgin.  
ian? Or will he now try to pick some  
other hole in this tranfa&amp;ion, to shield him.  
felf from a candid ackvowledgment, that in  
making up his cale, he supplied, by gratui.  
tous conje&amp;ures, the fa&amp;ts which were not  
within his knowledge, and that thus he has  
finned against truth, in his declarations be.-  
fore the public. Be this as it may, I bave  
so much confidence in the discernment and  
candor of my fellow citizens, as to leave to  
their judgment, and to dismiss from my own  
notice, any future torture of words .or cir.  
cumftances which this writer may devise for  
their deception. Indeed, could such a de.  
nunciation, and on such proof, bereave me  
of that confidence and consolation, I should,  
  
through the remainder of life, brood over  
the affli®ing evidence that I had lived and  
labored in vain.
