Sir  
Head Quarters New York May 7th 1782.  
  
Having been appointed by His Majesty to the Command of the Forces on the Atlantic Ocean and joined with Admiral Digby in the Commission of Peace, I find it proper in this Manner to apprize your Excellency of my Arrival at New York.  
The occasion, Sir, seems to render this Communication proper, but the circumstances of the present Time render it also indispensible, as I find it just to transmit herewith to your Excellency certain papers, from the perusal of which your Excellency will  
perceive what Dispositions prevail in the Government and People of England towards those of America, and wha further Effects are llikely to follow; if the like pacific Disposition should prevail in this Country, both my inclination and Duty will lead me to meet it with the  
most Zealous concurrence. In all events, Sir, it is with me to Declare that, if War must prevail I shall endeavour to render its Miseries as light to the People of this Continent as the circumstances of such a Condition will possibly permit.  
I am much concerned to find that private and unauthorized persons have on both sides given way to those passions which ought to have received the strongest and most effectual Controul, and which have begot Acts of Retaliation, which without proper  
preventions, may have an extent equally Calamitous and dishonorable to both Parties, tho, as it should seem, more extensively pernicious to the Natives and settlers of this Country.  
How much soever, Sir, we may differ in other respects, upon this one point we must perfectly concert, being alike interested to preserve the Name of Englishman from Reproach, and individuals from Experiencing such unnecessary Evils as can have no Effect  
upon a General Decision, every proper Measure which may tend to prevent these criminal Excesses in Individuals, I shall ever be ready to embrace, and as an advance on my part, I have, as the first Act of my Command inlarged Mr Livingston and have written to  
his Father upon the Subject of such Excesses as have passed in New Jersey, desiring his concurrence in such Measures as even under the Conditions of War, the common Interests of Humanity require.  
I am further to acquaint you, Sir, that it was my Intention to have sent this day a similar Letter of Compliment to Congress, but am informed it is previously Necessary to obtain a passport from your Excellency, which I therefore hope to receive, if you  
have no Objection, for the Passage of Mr Morgann to Philadelphia for the above purpose. I have the Honor to be with great Respect Your Excellency’s Most Obedient servt

SiR, Head Dnarters, May 7. 1782:  
  
HAVING been appointed by his Majefty to the command of the  
forces on the Atlantic Ocean, and joined with Admiral Digby in the  
commiffion of peace, J find it proper in this manner to apprize your  
Excellency of my arrival at New York. :  
  
he occafion, Sir, feems to render this communication proper, but  
the circumftances of the prefent time render it alfo indifpenfible, as 1  
find it juft to tranfmit. herewith to your Excellency certain papers,  
from the perufal of which your Excellency will perccive what difpofi-  
tions prevail in the Government and people ef England towards thofe  
of America, and what further effeéts are likely to follow: If the like  
pacific difpofitions thould prevail in this country, both my inclination  
and duty will lead me to meet it with the molt zealous concurrence.  
In all events, Sir, it is with me to declare, that, if war mutt prevail,  
I thall endeavour to render its miferies as light to the people of this  
continent as the circumftances of fich a condition will poffibly pet~  
mit.  
  
_Tam much conéerned to find, that private atid unauthorifed perfons  
have on beth fides given way to thofé paffiuns which ought to have re-  
ceived the ftrongeft and moit effe@tual controul, and which have begot  
atts of retaliation, which, without proper prevention, may have an  
extent equally calamitous and diffionourable to both parties, though as  
it fhould feem more extenfively pernicious to the natives and fettlers  
of this country.  
  
How much foever, Sir, we may differ in other refpedts, upon this  
one point we maft perfeétly concur, being alike interefted to preferve  
the name of Englifhmen from reproach, and individuals from experi-  
encing fuch unneceflary evils as can have no effeét upon a general deci-  
fion; every proper meafure, which inay tend to prevent thefe crimia  
nal cxcefles in individuals, I fhall be ever ready to embrace ; and, as  
2n advantage on my part, I have, as the firit aét of my command, en-  
larged Mr Livingfton, and have written to his father upon the fab:  
ject of fiuch excefles as have paffed in New Jerfey, defis ing his concur-  
rence in fuch meafares, as, even under the conditions of war, the  
common interefts of humanity require.  
  
1 am further to acquaint you, Sir, that it was my intention to have  
fent this day a fimilar letter of compliment to Congrefs, but am in-  
formed it is previoufly neceflary to obtain @ paffport from your Excel-  
Jency, which I therefore hope to receive, if you have no objection for  
the paflage of Mr Morgan to Philadelphia, for the above purpofe. [
