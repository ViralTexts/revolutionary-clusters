Dear Sir  
Paris July 28. 1787.  
  
I received with infinite satisfaction your letter of the 1st. of March. It was the first information I had of your being in America. There is no person whom I shall see again with more cordial joy whenever it shall be my lot to return to my native country; nor any one whose prosperity in the mean time will be more interesting to me. I find as I grow older that I set a higher value on the intimacies of my youth, and am more afflicted by whatever loses one of them to me. Should it be in my power to render any service in your shipment of tobacco to Havre de Grace, I shall do it with great pleasure. The order of Berni has I believe been evaded by the farmers general  as much as possible. At this moment I receive information from most of the seaports that they refuse taking any tobacco under pretext that they have purchased their whole quantity. From Havre I have heard nothing, and beleive you will stand a better chance there than any where else. Being one of the ports of manufacture too it is entitled to a higher price. I have now desired that the farmers may make a distinct return of their purchases which are conformable to the order of Berni. If they have really bought their quantity on those terms, we must be satisfied: if they have not, I shall propose their being obliged to make it up instantly. There is a considerable accumulation of tobacco in the ports.  
Among many good qualities which my countrymen possess, some of a different character unhappily mix themselves. The most remarkable are indolence, extravagance, and infidelity to their engagements. Cure the two first, and the last would disappear, because it is a consequence of them, and not proceeding from a want of morals. I know of no remedy against indolence and extravagance but a free course of justice. Every thing else is merely palliative: but unhappily the evil has gained too generally the mass of the nation to leave the course of justice unobstructed. The maxim of buying nothing without money in our pocket to pay for it, would make of our country one of the happiest upon earth. Experience during the war proved this; as I think every man will remember that under all the privations it obliged him to submit to during that period he slept sounder, and awaked happier than he can do now. Desperate of finding relief from a free course of justice, I look forward to the abolition of all credit as the only other remedy which can take place. I have seen therefore with pleasure the exaggerations of our want of faith with which the London papers teem. It is indeed a strong medecine for sensible minds, but it is a medecine. It will prevent their crediting us abroad, in which case we cannot be credited at home. I have been much concerned at the losses produced by the fire of Richmond. I hope you have escaped them. It will give me much pleasure to hear from you as often as you can spare a moment to write. Be assured that nobody entertains for you sentiments of more perfect and sincere esteem than Dear Sir Your friend &amp; servant,  
  
Th: Jefferso

Paris, July 28, 1787.  
Dear Sir:  
I received with infinite satisfac­

it was the first information 1 had of  
your being in America. There is  
no person I shall see again with  
more cordial joy when it shall be  
my lot to return to my native court  
try; nor anyone whose prosperity in  
the meantime will be more interest­  
ing to me. I find as I grow older  
that I set a higher value on the in­  
timacies of ray youth, and am more  
afflicted by whatever losses one of  
them suffers, should it be in my  
power to render any service in your  
shipment of tobacco to Havre de  
grace, I shall do it with great pleas­  
ure. the order of Berni has I believe  
been evaded by the farmers general  
as much as possible, at this mo­  
ment I receive the information  
from most of the seaports that they  
refuse taking any tabacco under  
pretext that they have purchased  
their whole quantity, from Havre  
I have heard nothing, and I believe  
you will stand a better chance there  
than anywhere else, being one of  
the ports of manufacture too it is

chases which conformable to the

bought their quantity on those

have not, I shall propose their be­  
ing obliged to make it up instantly,  
there is a considerate accumulation  
of tobacco in the ports. Among  
many good qualities which my coun­  
trymen possess, some of a different  
character unhappily mix them­  
selves. the most remarkable are  
indolence, extravagance &amp; infidel­  
ity to their engagements, cure the  
two first and the last would disap­  
pear, because it is a consequence of  
them, and not proceeding from a  
want of morals. I know of no rem­

but unhappily the evill has gained  
too generally the mass of the na­

unobstructed, the maxim of buying  
nothing without money in our pock­
