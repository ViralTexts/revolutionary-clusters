In the days of Horace human nature was about the  
same that it is now, People delighted in scandal even  
then, and they roll the savory morsel under their  
tongues in this nineteenth century. We do take a  
morbid delight in finding out something bad about

considence, and he does the same, and so the story  
goes through the community until everybody has  
been told of the mishap and enjoined to keep it a se-­
