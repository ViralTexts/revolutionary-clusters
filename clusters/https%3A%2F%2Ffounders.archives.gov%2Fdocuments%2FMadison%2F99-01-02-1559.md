						Sir,  
						Department of State, 29th March 1807.  
					  
					FURTHER Reflection on the Tenor and Tendency of the Order of His Britannick Majesty, communicated by your Letter of the 16th Instant, which was answered by mine of the 24th, induces me to resume that important Subject.  
					From the Difficulty of supposing that the Order can have for its Basis either a legal Blockade, impossible to be extended to all the Ports described in the Order, or a supposed Illegality of the Trade between those Ports, an Illegality which has never been  
						applied by the British Government or its Admiralty Courts, to use accustomed Trade even between Ports of a belligerent Nation, and is utterly at Variance with the Conduct of both, in reference to a Trade between a Belligerent Nation and its Allies; a Necessity seems to result  
						of ascribing the Order to the Policy of countervailing, through the Commerce of Neutrals, the French Decree of the 21st of November last.  
					In this View of the Order, it demands, on the Part of the United States, the most serious Attention both to its Principle and to its Operation.  
					With respect to its Principle, it will not be contested, that a Retaliation by one Nation on its Enemy, which is to operate through the Interest of a Nation not its Enemy, essentially requires, not only that the Injury inflicted should be limited by the  
						Measure of Injury sustained, but that every retaliating Step in such a Case should be preceded by an unreasonable Failure of the Neutral Party, in some Mode or other to put an End to the Inequality wrongfully produced. Were it certain, therefore, that the French Decree is to  
						be enforced in the Sense in which it is taken, and that, in Violation of the Treaty between France and the United States, the Commerce of the latter will not be exempted; the British Order being peremptory in its Import and immediate in its Execution, might justly be regarded  
						by the United States as a Proceeding equally premature and unfriendly. But in the Uncertainty as to the real Meaning of that Decree, and whilst a Presumption offered itself, that the Decree, if avowed and executed in an unlawful Extent, might not embrace the Commerce of the  
						United States; they are bound by Justice to their Interests, as well as by Respect for their Rights, to consider the British Order as a Ground for serious Complaint and Remonstrance. Should it prove that the Decree had not the Meaning ascribed to it, and particularly, should  
						the Respect of France for her Treaties with the United States, except their Trade from the Operation of the Decree, the Order of the British Government will stand exposed to still severer Comments. It will take the Character of an original Aggression, will furnish to the  
						French Government a like Ground with that assumed by itself, for retaliating Measures, and will derive a very unfavourable Feature from the Consideration that it was a palpable Infraction of a Treaty just signed on the Part of the British Government, and expected, at the Date  
						of the Order, to be speedily ratified on the Part of the United States.  
					The Necessity of presenting the Subject in its true light, is strengthened by the Operation which the British Order will have, on a vast Proportion of the entire Commerce of the United States, not to dwell on the carrying Branch of the Commerce between our  
						Ports and Countries of Europe, and which the Immunity given by our Flag, in consequence of Treaties with the Enemies of Great Britain, to British Property, and not enjoyed by the Property of her Enemies, has hitherto been advantageous to Great Britain; and without inquiring  
						into the Effect of an Application of the Interdict to the other Quarters of the Globe, all of which are evidently within the comprehensive Terms of the Order, it cannot be overlooked, that the Character and Course of nearly the Whole of the American Commerce with the Ports of  
						Europe, other than of Great Britain, will fall under the destructive Operation of the Order; it is well known that the Cargoes exported from the United States frequently require that they may be disposed of partly at one Market and partly at another. The Return Cargoes are  
						still more frequently collected at different Ports, and not unfrequently at Ports different from those receiving the outward Cargoes.  
					In this circuitous Voyage, generally consisting of several Links, the Interest of the Undertakers materially requires also, either a Trade or a Freightage between the Ports visited in the Circuit. To restrain the Vessels of the United States, therefore,  
						from this legitimate and customary Mode of trading with the Continent of Europe, as is contemplated by the Order, and to compel them, on one Hand, to dispose of the whole of their Cargoes at a Port which may want but a Part; and on the other Hand, to seek the Whole of their  
						Returns at the same Port, which may furnish but a Part, or perhaps no Part of the Articles wanted, would be a Proceeding as ruinous to our Commerce as contrary to our essential Rights.  
					These Observations, which are made in conformity with the Sentiments of the President, cannot fail, Sir, to have all the Weight with an enlightened and friendly Government to which they are entitled, and the President persuades himself, that the good Effect  
						of Truths which they disclose, will be seen in such Measures as will remove all Grounds for Dissatisfaction, and demonstrate on that Side, the same sincere Disposition to cultivate Harmony and beneficial Intercourse, as is felt and evinced by the United States and their  
						Government. I have the Honour to be, &amp;c.

Department of State.  
March 29th, 1807.  
  
Sirâ€”Further reflection on the  
tenor and tendency of the order of  
his Britannic majesty, communi-  
cated by your letter of the 12th in-  
stant, which was answered by  
mine of the 20th, induces me to  
resume that important subject.  
  
From the difficulty of suppos-  
ing that the order can have for its  
basis, either a legal blockade im-  
  
ssible to be extended to all the  
ports described in the order, or a  
supposed illegality of the trade  
between those ports, an illegality  
which has never been applied by  
the British government, or its ad-  
miralty courts to an accustomed  
trade, even between the ports of  
the same belligerent nation, and  
is utterly at variance with the  
conduct ofboth in reference to a  
trade between a belligerent na-  
tion and its allies; a necessity  
seems to result of ascribing the  
order to the policy of countervail-  
  
ing, through the commerce of  
neutrals, the French decree of  
the 21st of November last.  
  
In this view of the order, it de-  
mands, on the part of the United  
States, the most serious atten-  
tion both to its principle, and to  
its operation.  
  
With respect to its frincifile,  
it will not be contested that a re-  
taliation by one nation on its ene-  
my, which is to operate through  
the interest of a nation not an  
enemy, essentially requires not  
only that the injury inflicted  
should be limited by the measure  
of injury sustained ; but that eve-  
ry retaliating step, in such a case,  
should be preceded by an unrea-  
sonable failure of the neutral par-  
ty to put an end, in some mode  
or other, to the inequality wrong-  
fully produced.  
  
Were it certain, therefore, that  
the French decree is to be enfor-  
ced in the sense in which it is ta-  
ken, and that in violation of the  
treaty between France and the  
United States, the commerce ot  
the latter will not be exempted ;  
the British order, being peremp-  
tory in its import, and immediate  
in its execution, might justly be  
regarded #y the United States, as  
a proceeding equally premature  
and unfriendly.  
  
But in the uncertainty as to the  
real meaning of that decree ; and  
whilst a presumption offered it-  
self, that the decree, if avowed  
and executed in an unlawful ex-  
tent, might not embrace the  
  
commerce of the United States,  
  
they are bound by justice to their  
interests, as well as by respect  
for their rights, to consider the  
British order as a ground for se-  
rious complaintand remonstrance.  
  
Should it prove that the decree

AMERICAN STATE PAPERS:  
  
hail not-the meaning ascribed to  
  
it, and particularly, should the  
respect of France for her treaties  
with the United States exempt  
their trade from the operation of  
the decree, the order of the Bri-  
tish goverment will stand ex-  
  
sed to still severer comments.  
It will take the character of an  
original aggression, will furnish  
the French government, a like  
ground with that assumed by it-  
self, for retaliating measures, and  
will derive a vefy unfavorable  
feature from the consideration,  
that it was a palpable infraction of  
a treaty just signed on the part of  
the British government, and ex-  
pected, at the date of the order, to  
be speedily ratified on the part of  
the United States.  
  
The necessity of presenting the  
subjectin its true light, is strength-  
ened by the oferation which the  
British order will have on a vast  
proportion of the entire commerce  
Not to  
dwell on the carrying branch of  
the commerce between the ports  
and countries of Europe, and  
which the immunity given by our  
  
â€˜flaz in consequence of treaties  
  
with the enemies of Great Bri-  
tain, to British property, and not  
enjoyed by the property of her  
enemies, has hitherto been ad-  
tantageous to Great Britain ; and  
without enquiring into the effect  
  
} of an application of the interdict,  
  
to the other quarters of the globe,  
all of which are evidently within  
the comprehensive terms of the  
order, it cannot be overlooked,  
  
| that the character and course of  
  
nearly the whole of the American  
  
commerce with the ports of Eu-  
  
rope, other than of Great Britain,  
  
will fall under the destruÂ¢tive ope-  
VOL, IY.

ration of the order. It is well  
  
known that the cargoes exported  
  
from the United States, frequent-  
  
ly require that they be disposed  
  
of, partly at one market, and part-  
  
ly at another. The return car-  
  
goes are still more frequently  
  
collected at different ports; and  
  
not unfrequently, at ports differ-  
  
ent from those receiving the out-  
  
ward cargoes. In this circuitous  
  
voyage, generally consisting of  
  
several links, the interest of the  
  
undertakers materially requires  
  
also, either a trade or a freight-  
  
age between the ports visited in  
  
the circuit. To restrain the ves-  
  
sels of the United States, there-  
  
fore, from this Jegitimate and cus-  
  
tomary mode of trading with the  
  
continent of Eurepe, as is con-  
  
templated by the order, and to  
  
compel them on one hand to dis-  
  
pose of the whole of their car-  
  
goes ata port which may want.  
but a part, and, on the other hand,  
to seek the whole of their re-  
turns at the same port, which may  
furnish but a part or perhaps no  
part of the articles wanted, would  
be a proceeding as ruinous to our  
commerce, as contrary to our es-  
sential rights.  
  
These observations which are  
made in conformity with the sen-  
timents of the president, cannot  
fail, sir, to have all the weight  
with an enlightened and friendly  
government, to which they are  
entitled ; and the president per-  
suades himself, that the good ef-  
fect of the truths which they dis-  
close, will be seen in such mea-  
sures as will remove all ground  
for dissatisfaction, and demon-  
strate on that side, the same sin-

Alarch 29, 1807. )  
Sir, |  
Further reflection on the tenor  
and tendency of the order of his BiiÂ­  
taiuiic inajc.tv, communicated by  
your letter of (he 12thinst. which was  
! answered by mine of the 30th, induÂ­  
i ces mc to resume that important subÂ­  
i ject  
From tho difficulty of supposing  
that the order can have for its basis,  
either a legal blockade impossible to  
tended to all ihe ports described  
in the order, or a supposed illegality  
ot the trade- between those ports, aii  
illegality which has never been apÂ­  
plied by the British government i  
admiralty courts to an accustomed  
trade even between ports of the same  
belligerent nation, and is utterly ut  
variance v. Lh the conduct of both in  
reference to a trade between a belli*  
gercnt nation and its allies, a necessiÂ­  
ty seems to retail of ascribing the  
is to tiie podcy of countervailing,  
through Hie commerce ol neul  
the French decree of tiie 21st Nov.  
last.  
In this view of the order, it de* j  
mands, on the part ofthe U. S. the  
most, serious atieution, both to its  
principle and to its operation.  
\ ill. respect to its principle, v.  
&#x27; will not be contested, that a reialiaÂ­  
. tion 1/ one nation on its enemy.  
I which is to operate through the interÂ­  
&#x27; est &quot;f a nation, not an enemy, em  
liaiiy requires not only that the injury  
inflicted should be limited by the n  
sure of injury sustained, but that i  
ry retaliating step, in such a case,  
should be preceded by an unreasonaÂ­  
ble failure of the neutral party, in  
some mode or otiier, to put an end to  
the inequality wrongfully produced. ,  
Were il certain, thcielwre, that the i  
French decree is to be enforced in  
the sense in which it is taken, and. that  
in violation of the treaty betwc n  
France ami tiie U. S. the commerce of â–º,  
the latter will not be exempted, the  
Bdilish order being peremptory in its â€¢  
import and Immediate in its execu- &#x27;  
might justl) be regarded by tbp  
at a proceeding equally premuÂ­  
_id unfriendly.  
  
WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 23, 1808.  
  
But, in the uncertainty as to the  
cal meaning of that decree ; and  
&#x27; hilst a presumption offered itself  
&quot;hat tho decree, if avowed and exeÂ­  
cuted in an unlawful extent, might  
not embrace the commerce of the U.  
S. they arc bound&#x27;by justice to their  
interests, as well as by respect for  
their rights, to consider the British  
&gt;rder as a ground for serious comÂ­  
.ilaint and remonstrance.  
Shoi Id it prove that the decree had  
Hot Hie meaning ascribed to it, and  
particularly should tbe respect ol  
ice for her treaties with the U. S.  
except their trade from the operation  
of the decree, the order of the tlriÂ­  
tiÂ«&gt;h government will stand exposed to  
still severer comments. It will take  
the character of an original aggresÂ­  
sion, will furnish to the French goÂ­  
vernment, a like ground with that asÂ­  
sumed by itself for retaliating meaÂ­  
sures, and will derive a very unfavo  
rable feature from the consideration,  
that It was a palpable infraction of a  
treaty just signed on the part of the  
British government, and expected, at  
the date of the order, io be speedily  
ratified on the part of the U. 8.  
The necessity of presenting the  
subject in its true light is StrengthenÂ­  
ed by the operation which the British  
| order will have on a vast proportion of  
; the entire commerce of the United  
J States. Not to dwell on the carrying  
! branch of the commerce between the  
, ports and countries of Europe* and  
which the immunity given toourflag,  
iin consequence of treaties with the  
| enemies of Great Britain, to British  
â€¢ property, and not fen joyed by the  
| property of her enemies, lias hitherto  
; been advantageous io Great Britain ; j  
&#x27;and without enquiring imo the effect  
jof an application of the interdict to  
the other quarters of the globe, all of  
which are evid-r.tly within Ihe com-&#x27;  
prehensive terms of the order, it c ru- j  
, not be overlooked, that the character ;  
j and course of nearly the whole of the &lt;  
j American commerce, with tiie ports &#x27;.  
lof Europe, other than of Great IM- i  
lain, will fall under the destructive |  
operation of the order. It is well !  
known that the cargoes exporLed from  
; the United States frequently require i  
that they be disposed of, partly at one  
! market, and partly at another. The  
return cargoes are still i  
qieutiy collected at different ports,  
and not unfreqtient&#x27;y, at ports differÂ­  
; ent from those receiving the outward  
cargoes. In this circuitous voyage,  
generally consisting of several links,  
the interest of the undertakers mateÂ­  
rially requires, also, cither a trade or  
i a freightage between the ports viÂ­  
sited in the circuit. To restrain the ,  
&#x27;vessels ofthe United States, there*  
&#x27;fore, from this legitimate and ctisÂ­  
j tomary mode of trading with the conÂ­  
tinent of Europe, as is contemplated  
by the orders, and to compel them,  
on one hand, to dispose of the whole  
of their cargoes at a port which may  
want but a part, and on the other  
hand, to seek the whole of their reÂ­  
turns at the same port which may  
furnish but a part, or perhaps no part,  
of the articles wanted, would be a  
proceeding as ruinous to our comÂ­  
merce as contrary lo our essential  
rights.  
These observations wl ieh are  
made in conformity with the senti- j  
ments of the President, cannot fail,  
sir, to have thj? weight, with at  
tened and friendly government,  
to which they are entitled ; and the  
President persuades himself, that the ,  
good effect of the truths which they Â»  
disclose, will i i such inea- j  
sure? as will remove all ground for i  
diiifaction, and demonstrate on f  
that side, the lame sincere disposition &quot;&gt;  
to cultivate harmony and beneficial in- j  
,as is lelt and evinced by j  
the United States and tucir-aoveni-&#x27;

Department of State, March 20, ISOS.  
Sir,  
further red ction on the tenor and tendency of  
the order nt his Britannic m..jcsty, comumni ated  
by ynur letter of the 12th lust, which was answered  
â€¢y mine of the 20lli, induces me to resume that imÂ­  
portant subject.  
From the difficulty of supposing that the order  
ran have lor its basis, either a legal blockade imÂ­  
possible to be extended to all the ports desenbid m  
the order, or a supposed illegality of the trade, beÂ­  
tween those ports, an illegality which has never  
been applied by the British government or its admiÂ­  
rally courts to an accustomed trade, even between  
the ports ot the same belligerent nation, and is utÂ­  
terly at variance with the conduct of both in reierÂ­  
eiKe to a trade between a belligerent nation and its  
aides ; a necessity seems to result of ascribing the  
order to the policy of countervailing, through the  
commerce of neutrals, the French decree of the 21st  
of November last,  
Ju tins view o| the order, it demands, on the part  
, of the L nit. d States, the most serious attention  
I both toils principle, and to its operation.  
With respect to its principle, it will not be conÂ­  
tested that a retaliation by one nation on its enemy,  
which is to operate through the interest of a nation  
not an enemy, essentially requires not only that the  
injury inflicted should be limited by the measure of  
injury sustained ; toil that every retaliating step, in  
such a case, should be preceded by an unreasonable  
failure ol the neutral party to put an end, in somt  
mode or other, to the inequality wrongfully produÂ­  
ced.  
Were it certain, therefore, that the Frence decree  
is to be enforced in the sense in which it is taken,  
and that in violation of the treaty between France  
and the United States, the commerce of the latter  
will not he exempted ; the British order, being peÂ­  
remptory in its import, and immediate in its execuÂ­  
tion. might justly be regarded by the United States,  
as proceeding equally premature and unfriendly.  
But in the uncertainty as to the real meaning of  
that decree; and whilst a presumption offered itself,  
that the derree, if avowed and executed in an unlawÂ­  
I, extenE might not embrace the commerce of the  
United States, they are bound by justice to their inÂ­  
terests, as well as f y respect for their rights, to conÂ­  
sider tin I5i Kish order as a ground fur serious comÂ­  
plaint and remonstrance.  
  
OIIUUâ€˜Â° 11 Prove mat the decree had not the meanÂ­  
mg ascribed to it, and particularly, should the resÂ­  
pect of f ranee for her treaties with the U. States  
exempt their trade from the operation of the decree  
the order of the British government will stand exÂ­  
posed to still severer comments. It will take the  
character of an original aggression, will furnish  
the french government, a like ground with that asÂ­  
sumed by itseit, lor retaliating measures, and will  
derive a very unfavorable feature from the consideÂ­  
ration, that it was a palpable infraction of a treaty  
just signed on the part of the British government  
an 1 expected, at the dale of the order, to be speediÂ­  
ly ratified on the part of the United States.  
The necessity of presenting the subject in its  
true light, is sti. agthened by the operation which  
the Hi ilish order will have on a vast proportion of  
the entire commerce of the United Stales. Not to  
dwell on the carrying branch of the commerce beÂ­  
tween the ports and countries of Europe, and which  
the immunity given by our flag in consequence of tre*.  
ties with the enemies of Great Britain, to British  
property, and nut enjoyed hy the property of her eÂ­  
ucm.es, has hitherto been advantageous to GreatÂ­  
llrit on ; and without enquiring into the effect of ap  
application of the interdict, to the othcruiiarters of  
ihe globe, all o( which are evidently within the  
co nprehensive terms of the order, it cannot be oÂ­  
vtrlooked, that the rharactei and course of nearly  
the whole ot the American commerce within the  
ports of Europe, oibrr than or Great Britain, will  
ull under ilia destructive operation of the pfder.â€”  
It it well known that the cargoes exported from tire

of the order of his Erfranmc majesty, c&lt;y:r.rr.tini- j  
cnted by your letter &lt;;f the 19th inst. which wr 1  
â€¢niwei id by mine of the 20Lli, induces me to re-&gt;  
Â»uiue that important subject.  
From the dihiulty Of supposing that the order  
can have for its basis, either a legal blockade Â»tu  
possible to be extended to all the ports described  
in the order, or a supposed illegality of the trash  
between those ports, an illegality which lias neÂ­  
ver been applied by the British government or itÂ­  
admiralty courts to an uccuxtotned trade even be  
tween ports of the same belligerent nation, and  
â€¢s utterly at variance with the conduct of both  
â€™iÂ» reference to a trade between a belligerent naÂ­  
tion and its allies, a necessity seems to result of  
â€¢scribing the orders to the policy of countervailÂ­  
l!Â»g, through the commerce of neutrals, the  
French decree of the 21st Nov. las&#x27;t.  
In this view of the order, it demands, on the  
part of the U. States, the most serious attention,  
both to its principle and to its operation.  
With respect to its principle, it will not he conÂ­  
tested, that a retaliation by one nation o.i its eneÂ­  
my, which is to operate through the interest of a  
nation, not an enciny, essentially requires not onÂ­  
ly that the injury inflicted should be limited by  
the measure efinjury sustained, but Unit every  
retaliating step, ill such a case, should be preceÂ­  
ded by an unreasonable failure of the neutral  
party, in some mode or other, to pul an end to  
the inequality wrongfully produced.  
Were it certain, therefore, that the French deÂ­  
cree is to be enforced in the sense in which it is  
taken, and that, in violation of the treaty between  
br.mce and the United Stales, the commerce of  
the latter will not be exempted, the British order,  
being peremptory in its import and immediate i:i  
its execution, might justly be regarded by the U.  
â€¢State*, as a procet-.ling equally premature &amp; unÂ­  
friendly.  
  
I iii uic unccrtaimv as to me real meaning  
[ of that decri Â« ; anil whilst a presumption offered  
ilselt that the decree, if avowed and executed in  
an unlawful extent, might not embrace the coinÂ­  
: nicrce of the United Slates, they are bound hv  
I justice to their interests, as well as by respect  
,ur their rights, to consider die ISiiunti &lt;JidcÂ»  
as a ground for serious complaint and remonÂ­  
strance.  
Should it prove that the decree had not the  
meaning ascribed to it, and particularly should  
the respect of France for her treaties with the  
United States, except their trade from the opeÂ­  
ration ot tlie decree, the order of the British goÂ­  
vernment will stand exposed to still severer comÂ­  
ments. It will take the character of an original  
uÂ£grcssion, wiil furnish to the French governÂ­  
ment a like ground v&gt; ith that assumed by itself  
lor retaliating measures, and will derive a very  
unfavorable feature from the consideration, that  
it was a palpable infraction of a treaty jti.it signÂ­  
ed on the part of the British government, and exÂ­  
pected, at the date of the order, to be speedily raÂ­  
tified on the part ol&quot; the United States.  
The necessity of presenting the subject in its  
true light is strengthened by the operation which  
tlie British order will have on a vast proportion  
ol the entire commerce of the United States â€”  
Not to dwell on the carrying branch of the comÂ­  
merce between the ports and countries of Europe,  
and which the immunity given to our flag, in  
consequence of treaties with the enemies of G.  
Britain, to British property, and not enjoyed by  
the property of her enemies, has hitherto been  
advantageous to Great-Britain ; and without enÂ­  
quiring into the eff ect of ail application of the inÂ­  
terdict to tlie other quarters of the globe, all of  
which arc evidently within the comprehensive  
: terms of the order, it cannot he overlooked, that  
tlie character and course of nearly tlie whole of  
the American commerce, with the ports of EuÂ­  
rope, other than of Great-Brilain, will fall under  
the destructive operation of the order. It ir well  
known that the cargoes exported from the UniÂ­  
ted States, frequently require that they be dispoÂ­  
sed of, partly at one market, and partly at anoÂ­  
ther. The return cargoes are still more frequentÂ­  
ly collected at different port*, 8t not unfrequentÂ­  
ly, at ports different from those receiving tlie outÂ­  
ward cargoes. In this circuitous voyage, geneÂ­  
rally consisting of several links, the interest of  
the undertakers materially requires, also, either  
a trade or a freightage between the ports visited  
in the circuit. To restrain the vessels of the UÂ­  
niteil States, therefore, from this legitimate and  
customary mode of trading with the continent of  
Europe, as is contemplated by the orders, and to  
compel them, on one hand, to dispose ot the whole  
of their cargoes at a port which may want but a  
pait, and on the other hand, to seek tlie whole of  
their returns at the same port which may furnish  
but a part, or perhaps no part, of the articles  
wanted, would be a proceeding as ruinous *o our  
commerce as contrary to our essential rights.  
These observations, which are made in conforÂ­  
mity with the sentiments of the President, canÂ­  
not fail, sir, to have the weight, with an enlightÂ­  
ened and friendly government, to which they are  
entitled ; and the President persuades himself,  
that tlie gorid effect of the truths which they disÂ­  
close, will be seen in such measures as will reÂ­  
move all ground for dissatisfaction, and demonÂ­  
itrale on that side, the same sincere disposition to  
cultivate harmony and beneficial intercourse, as  
is felt and evinced by the United Slates and their  
government.

SI .  
Further reflect! n on the &#x27; nor and  
t tndiiicy of the ordv r Â«-i his oritanick  
n ijestv, communicated by your letter  
ol the 12Â»h inst. whi It was answered  
by mine of the 20; h imbu es me to reÂ­  
sume that im octant sit1 &gt;j ct.  
From the diiticultv ei supposing that  
the otdv.r t m have lor its b.i.is, Â«. ithei j  
a legal blockade impos-sibi- o be exÂ­  
ended to all the ports ties ib.-d in the  
order, or a supposed iih .-aiiiv o t!i.  
trade, bi tween those poi t , an illt guilty  
which has never been applied bv th  
British government or its admiralty  
courts to an accustomed trade even  
between the ports of the same belligeÂ­  
rent nation, and is utterlv at variauc&lt;  
with the conduct of both in reference  
to a trade between a belligerent nation  
itnd its allies ; a necessity seems to  
result of ascribing the order to the polÂ­  
icy of countervailing, through the comÂ­  
merce of neutrals, the French dectec  
of the 21st of November last.  
Inthib view of the order, it demands,  
on the part of the United States, the  
most serious attention both to its prinÂ­  
ciple, and to its operation*  
  
with respect to its principle, it will  
not he contested that a retaliation by  
one nation on its enemy, which is to oÂ­  
perate through the interest of a nation  
not an enemy, essentially requires not  
I only that the injury inflicted should hr  
I limited by the measure ol injury susÂ­  
tained ; but that every retaliating step,  
in such a case, should be preceded by  
an unreasonable failure of the neutral  
party to put an end, in some mode or  
other, to the inequality wrongfully pro-^  
duced.  
Were it certain, therefore, that the  
French decree is to he inforced in the  
sense in which it is taken, and that in  
violation of the treaty between France  
and the United States, the commerce  
of the latter will not he exempted ;  
the British order, being perempton  
in its import, and immediate in it1&#x27;  
execution, might justly be regarÂ­  
ded by the United States, as a proceeÂ­  
ding equally premature a ,d unfriendÂ­  
iy*  
Hut in the uncertainty as to the reÂ­  
sl meaning of that decree ; and whilst  
a presumption offered itself, that the  
lecree, if avowed and executed in ar  
unlawful extent, might not embrace  
the commerce of the United States,  
they arc bound by justice to their inÂ­  
  
terests, as well as by respect (or &#x27;heir  
rights, to consider the, British order  
as a ground for serious complaint and  
remonstrance.  
Should it prove that the deer e had  
not the meaning ascribed to it, and  
particularly, should the respect of  
France for her treaties with the U.  
States exempt their trade from the oÂ­  
peration of the decree, the order of  
the British government will stand exÂ­  
posed to still severer comments. It  
will take the character of on original  
aggression, will furnish the French  
government, a like ground with that  
assumed by itself, for retaliating meaÂ­  
sures, anil will derive a verv m.favorÂ­  
able feature from the consideration,  
that it was a palpable infraction of a  
treaty just signed on the part of the BriÂ­  
ti-h government, and expected, at the  
1 &gt;te ol the order, to be speedily ratiÂ­  
fied on the part of the U. States.  
The necessity of presenting the subÂ­  
ject in its true light, is strengthened  
ay the operation which the British oVÂ­  
;ler will have on a vast proportion of  
rhe entire commerce of the U. States.  
Not to dwell on the carrying branch of  
the commerce between the ports and  
countries of Europe, and which the  
immunit\ given by our flag in conseÂ­  
quent, e of treaties with the enemies of  
rireat Britain, to British property,  
tnd not enjoyed by the property of her  
hernies, has hitherto been advantageÂ­  
  
&gt;us to ltreat Britain ; and without &#x27; nÂ­  
cjuirinor into the effect of an appli aÂ­  
tion of the interdict, to the other qu Â»rÂ­  
rers ol the globe, all of which are eviÂ­  
dently within the comprehensive terms  
of the order, it cannot he overlooked,  
that the character and course of nearÂ­  
Iv the whole of the American comÂ­  
merce within th ports of Europe, oÂ­  
ther than of Great Britain, will fall  
under the destructive operation of the  
Older.â€”I is well known that the carÂ­  
goes exported from the United States,  
frequently r- quire that the}&#x27; he dispoÂ­  
s *d of, partly at one market, and partÂ­  
ly at another. The return c rgocs are  
â€¢till more frequently collected at &lt;jifÂ­  
b.i -r.t p rtr. ; and o&lt;Â»t upfyeqiientlv, at  
oorts different from those receiving  
the outward cargoes, in his ircuiÂ­  
tous vovage, generally consisting of  
sever d links, the interest of the unÂ­  
â€¢r&#x27;akers materially requires also eiÂ­  
â– cr a trade or a freightage between  
me ports visited in the circuit.â€”To  
restrain the vcs els of the U. States,  
th r t .r , from this legttimaâ€™e and cusÂ­

same port, which may furnish but a  
part, or perhaps no part of the articles  
wanted, would he a proceeding as  
ruinous to our commerce, is contrary  
to our essential rights.  
These observations, which are made  
â€™n conformity wi h the sentiments of  
&#x27;lie president, cannot fail, sir, to have  
iâ€™l the weight with an enlightened and
