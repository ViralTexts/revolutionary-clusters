hes the welfare of their country, and the happiness of posterity can hesitate one moment at adopting them; I want to know how those Sentiments are received in Congress? I dare say their would be no difficulty in procuring a vote and instructions from all the Assemblies in New England for independancy. I most sincerely wish that now in the Lucky Minuet it might be done.  
I have been kept in a continual state of anxiety and expectation ever since you left me. It has been said to morrow and to morrow for this month, but when the dreadfull to morrow will be I know not—but hark! the House this instant shakes with the roar of Cannon.—I have been to the door and find tis a cannonade from our Army, orders I find are come for all the remaining Militia to repair to the Lines a monday night by twelve o clock. No Sleep for me to Night; and if I cannot who have no guilt upon my Soul with regard to this Cause, how shall the misirible wretches who have been the procurers of this Dreadfull Scene and those who are to be the actors, lie down with the load of Guilt upon their Souls.  
  
Sunday Eve March 3  
I went to Bed after 12 but got no rest, the Cannon continued firing and my Heart Beat pace with them all night. We have had a pretty quiet day, but what to morrow will bring forth God only knows.  
  
  
Monday Evening  
  
Tolerable quiet to day. The Militia have all musterd with 3 days provision and are all march’d by 8 o clock this afternoon tho their notice was no longer than 8 o clock Saturday, and now we have scarcly a Man but our regular guards either in Weymouth, Hingham or Braintree or Milton and the Militia from the more remote towns are call’d in as Sea coast Guards. Can you form to yourself an Idea of our Sensations. Palmer is chief Colonel, Bass is Leit. Colonel and Soper Major and Hall Captain.  
I have just returnd from Penn’s Hill where I have been sitting to hear the amazing roar of cannon and from whence I could see every shell which was thrown. The sound I think is one of the Grandest in Nature and is of the true Speicies of the Sublime. Tis now an incessant Roar. But O the fatal Ideas which are connected with the sound. How many of our dear country men must fall?  
  
  
Twesday morning  
  
I went to bed about 12 and rose again a little after one. I could no more sleep than if I had been in the ingagement. The ratling of the windows, the jar of the house and the continual roar of 24 pounders, the Bursting of shells give us such Ideas, and realize a scene to us of which we could scarcly form any conception. About Six this morning, there was quiet; I rejoiced in a few hours calm. I hear we got possession of Dorchester Hill Last Night. 4000 thousand men upon it to day—lost but one Man. The Ships are all drawn round the Town. To night we shall realize a more terible scene still. I sometimes think I cannot stand it—I wish myself with you, out of hearing as I cannot assist them. I hope to give you joy of Boston, even if it is in ruins before I send this away.—I am too much agitated to write as I ought, and languid for want of rest.  
  
  
Thursday Fast Day  
  
All my anxiety, and distress, is at present at an End. I feel dissapointed. This day our Militia are all returning, without effecting any thing more than taking possession of Dorchester Hill. I hope it is wise and just, but from all the Muster and Stir I hoped and expected more important and decisive Scenes; I would not have sufferd all I have for two such Hills. Ever since the taking of that

? How do the Virginians realish the Troops said to be destined for them? Are they putting themselves into a State of Defence? I inclose to you a Coppy of a Letter sent by Capt. Furnance Furnass who is in Mr. Ned Churchs imploy and who came into the Cape about 10 days ago. You will learn the Sentiments of our Cousin by it, some of which may be true, but I hope he is a much better divine than politician.  
I hear in one of his Letters he mentions certain intercepted Letters which he says have made much Noise in England, and Laments that you ever wrote them.  
What will he and others say to Common Sense? I cannot Bear to think of your continuing in a State of Supineness this winter.  
  
“There is a tide in the affairs of Men  
Which taken, at the flood leads on to fortune;  
omitted, all the voyage of their life  
is bound in shallows and in miseries.  
On such a full sea are we now afloat;  
  
And we must take the current when it serves,  
or lose our ventures.”  
Shakespear  
  
  
Sunday Eve March 10  
I had scarcly finished these lines when my Ears were again assaulted with the roar of Cannon. I could not write any further. My Hand and heart will tremble, at this domestick fury, and firce civil Strife, which cumber all our parts. Tho,   
  
Blood and destruction are so much in use  
And Dreadfull objects so familiar,  
  
Yet is not pitty chok’d, nor my Heart grown Callous. I feel for the unhappy wretches who know not where to fly for safety. I feel still more for my Bleading Country men who are hazarding their lives and their Limbs.—A most Terible and incessant Cannonade from half after 8 till Six this morning. I hear we lost four men kill’d and some wounded in attempting to take the Hill nearest the Town call’d Nook Hill. We did some work, but the fire from the ships Beat off our Men so that they did not secure it but retired to the fort upon the other Hill.  
I have not got all the perticuliars I wish I had but, as I have an opportunity of sending this I shall endeavour to be more perticuliar in my next.  
All our Little ones send duty. Tommy has been very sick with what is call’d the Scarlet or purple fever, but has got about again.  
If we have Reinforcements here, I believe we shall be driven from the sea coast, but in what so ever state I am I will endeavour to be therewith content.  
  
Man wants but Little here below  
Nor wants that Little long.  
  
You will escuse this very incorrect Letter. You see in what purtubation it has been written and how many times I have left of. Adieu pray

pass through scenes of great suffering, amid  
the horrors of war, and the dreadful ravages  
of pestilence. ‘* My heart and hand,” she  
says, ‘still tremble at this domestic fury,

over the hills; many and many prayed  
that God in great mercy would spare their  
loved ones, and their countrymen.

‘‘T have been kept in a continual state of anxiety and ex-  
pectation ever since vou left me. It has been said ‘to-morrow’  
and ‘to-morrow’. for a month, but when the dreadful to-mor-  
row will be, I know not. But hark! The house this instant  
shakes with the roar of cannon. I have been to the door and  
find it is acannonade from our army. Orders, I find, are come  
for all the remaining militia to repair to the lines Monday  
night by 12 o’clock. No sleep for me to-night.  
  
‘* Sunday evening—I went to bed at 12, but got no rest, the  
cannon continued firing, and my heart beat pace with them  
all night. We have had a pretty quiet day, but what to-mor-  
row will bring forth God only knows.  
  
‘‘Monday evening—Tolerably quiet * * * . I have  
just returned from Penn’s Hill, where I have been sitting to  
hear the amazing roar of cannon, and from which I could see  
every shell which was thrown. The sound, I think, is one of  
the grandest in nature, and is of the true species of the sublime.  
Tis now an incessant roar; but Oh! the fatal ideas which are  
connected with the sound. How many of our dear countrymen  
must fall ?

a little after 1. I could no more sleep than if I had been in  
the engagement ; the rattling of the windows, the jar of the

house, the continual roar of twenty-four pounders and the  
bursting of shells give us such ideas and realize a scene to us  
of which we could form scarcely any conception. About 6  
this morning there was quiet. I rejoiced in a few hours’ calm.  
I hear we got possession of Dorchester last night; 4,000 men  
upon it to-day ; lost butone man. The ships are drawn around  
the town. To-night we shall realize a more terrible scene  
still. I sometimes think I cannot stand it. I wish myself out  
of hearing, as I cannot assist them. I hope to give you joy of  
Boston, even if it is in ruins, before I send this away. I am  
too much agitated to write as I ought, and languid for want of  
rest.  
  
‘Thursday, Fast Day. All my anxiety and distress is at  
present at anend. I feel disappointed. This day our militia  
are all returning without effecting anything more than taking  
possession of Dorchester Hill. I hope it is wise and just, but  
from all the muster and stir I hoped and expected more decisive  
scenes. I would not have suffered all I have for two such

‘‘ How do the Virginians relish the troops said to be destined  
for them? Are they putting themselves in a state of defense ?  
I cannot bear to think of your continuing in a state of supine-  
ness this winter.’’  
  
On Sunday evening this remarkable eight-day letter is con-  
cluded.  
  
* * * Thad scarcely finished these lines when my ears  
were again assaulted by the roar of cannon. I could not write  
any farther. My hand and heart will tremble at this ‘‘ domes-  
tic fury and fierce civil strife,’’ which ‘‘ cumber all our parts,”’  
though ‘‘blood and destruction are’so much in use,’’ ‘‘ and  
dreadful objects so familiar,’’ yet is not pity choked or my  
heart grown callous. I feel for the unhappy wretches that  
know not where to fly for safety. I feel still more for my  
bleeding countrymen, who are hazarding their lives and their  
limbs. A most terrible and incessant cannonade from half  
after eight until six this morning. I hear we lost four men  
killed and some wounded in attempting to take the hill nearest  
the town, called Neck’s Hill. We did some work, but the fire  
from the ships beat off our men, so that they did not secure it  
but retired to the fort upon the other hill. I have not yet got  
all the particulars ; I wish I had; but, as I have an opportunity  
of sending this, I shall endeavor to be more particular in my  
next.

If they are reinforced here I believe we shall be driven  
from the sea coast ; but in whatever State I am, I will endeavor

Man wants but little here below,  
Nor wants that little long.  
  
You will excuse this very incorrect letter. You see in what
