ant a comfort.I have made no specific provision for the comfortable maintenance of my son in law Thomas M. Randolph, because of the difficulty and uncertainty of devising terms which shall vest any beneficial interest in him which the law will not transfer to the benefit of his creditors, to the destitution of my daughter and her family and disablement of her to supply  him: whereas property placed under the exclusive right of my daughter and her independant will, as if she were a feme sole, considering the relations in which she stands both to him and his children, will be a certain resource against want for all.I give to my friend James Madison of Montpellier my gold-mounted walking staff of animal horn, as a token of the cordial and affectionate friendship which for nearly now an half century, has united us in the same principles and pursuit of what we have deemed for the greatest good of our country.I give to the University of Virginia my library, except such particular books only, and of the same edition, as it may already possess, when this legacy shall take effect. the rest of my said library  remaining after those given to the University shall have been taken out, I give to my two grandsons in law Nicholas P. Trist and Joseph Coolidge.To my grandson Thomas Jefferson Randolph I give my silver watch in preference of the golden one, because of it’s superior excellence. my papers of business going of course to him, as my executor, all others of a literary or other character I give to him as of his own property.I give a gold watch to each of my grandchildren who shall not have already recieved one from me, to be purchased and delivered by my executor, to my grandsons at the age of 21. and grand-daughters at that of sixteen.I give to my good, affectionate, and faithful servant Burwell his freedom, and the sum of three hundred Dollars to buy necessaries to commence his trade of painter and glazier, or to use otherwise as he pleases. I give also to my good servants John Hemings and Joe Fosset their freedom at the end of one year after my death: and to each of them respectively all the tools of their respective shops or callings: and it is my will that a comfortable log-house be built for each of the three servants so emancipated on some part of my lands convenient to them with respect to the residence of their wives, and to Charlottesville and the University, where they will be mostly employed, and reasonably convenient also to the interests of the proprietor of the lands; of which houses I give the use of one, with a curtilage of an acre to each, during his life or personal occupation thereof.I give also to John Hemings the service of his two apprentices, Madison and Eston Hemings until their respective ages of twenty one years, at which period respectively, I give them their freedom. and I humbly and earnestly request of the legislature of Virginia a confirmation of the bequest of freedom to these servants, with permission to remain in this state where their families and connections are, as an additional instance of the favor, of which I have received so many other manifestations, in the course of my life, and for which I now give them my last, solemn, and dutiful thanks.In testimony that this is a Codicil to my will of yesterday’s date, and that it is to modify so far the provisions of that will, I have written it all with my own hand, in two pag
