oth of the above Letters respecting the jealousies which you say are  
  
gone abroad. I have studiously avoided in all Letters intended for the publick eye—I mean for that of the Congress—every expression that could give pain or uneasiness—and I shall observe the same rule with respect to private Letters, further than appears absolutely necessary for the illucidation of Facts, I cannot charge myself with incivility, or, what in my opinion is tantamount, ceremonious Civility, to the Gentlemen of this Colony; but if such my conduct appears, I will endeavour at a reformation, as I can assure you my dear Reed that I wish to walk in such a Line as will give most general Satisfaction. You knew, that it was my wish at first to Invite a certain number of the Gentlemen of this Colony every day to dinner, but, unintentionally I believe by any body, we some how or other missed of it; if this has given rise to the jealousy, I can only say that I am sorry for it, at the same time I add, that it was rather owing to inattention, or more properly too much attention to other matters, which caused me to neglect it. The Extracts of Letters from this Camp which so frequently appear in the Pensa Papers are not only written without my knowledge, but without my approbation, as I have always thought they must have a disagreeable tendency; but there is no restraining Mens tongues, or Pens, when charged with a little vanity, as in the Accounts given of or rather by the Rifflemen.
