It follows that this article was considered as competent to prevent the coming in and sale of Prizes.  
If so, the same or equivalent terms in the British Treaty must be competent to the same thing.  
Now the 25th article of our Treaty with Great Britain has equivalent terms.

But France, it is answered, had a prior right by the 17th article of our Treaty with her, to come and bring prizes into our ports.  
True, she had this right, and must have i
