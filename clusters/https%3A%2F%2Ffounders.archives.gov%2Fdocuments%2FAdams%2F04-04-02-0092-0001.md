In this Beautifull month when Nature wears her gayest garb, and animal and vegetable life is diffused on every side, when the Chearfull hand of industery is laying a foundation for a plentifull Harvest who can forbear to rejoice in the Season, or refrain looking “through Nature up to Nature’s God?”  
  
“To feel the present Deity and taste  
The joy of God, to see a happy World.”  
  
While my Heart expands, it sighing seeks its associate and joins its first parent in that Beautifull Discriptive passage of Milton  
  
  
  
Sweet is the Breath of morn, her rising sweet, With charm of earliest Bird; pleasent the Sun, When first on this delightfull land he spreads His orient beams, on herb, tree, fruit and flower Glist’ring with dew; fragrant the fertile earth After soft showers, and sweet the comeing on of Gratefull Evening mild; then Silent Night with this her solemn Bird, and this fair Moon And these the Gems of heaven, her starry train; But neither Breath of Morn when she assends With charm of earliest Birds nor rising Sun on this delightfull land: nor herb, fruit, flower Glist’ring with dew; nor fragrance after showers nor Gratefull Evening mild, nor Silent Night with this her Solemn Bird, nor Walk by moon or Glitt’ring Star light, “without thee is sweet.”  
  
  
  
This passage has double charms for me painted by the hand of Truth, and for the same reason that a dear Friend of mine after having viewed a profusion of Beautifull pictures pronounced that which represented the parting of Hector and Andromaque to be worth them all. The journal in which this is mentiond does not add any reason why it was so, but Portia felt its full force, and paid a gratefull tear to the acknowledgment.

‘25 May, 1781.  
  
‘In this beautiful month, when nature wears her gayest garb,  
and animal and vegetable life is diffused on every side, when the  
cheerful hand of industry is laying a foundation for a plentiful  
harvest, who can forbear to rejoice in the season, or refrain from  
looking “ through nature up to nature’s God”;  
  
“To feel the present Deity, and taste  
The joy of God, to see a happy world”.  
  
  
  
1878.] Mrs. Abigail Adams. 315  
  
While my heart expands, it, sighing, seeks its associate, and joins  
its first parent in that beautiful description of Milton :  
  
“Sweet is the breath of Morn, her rising sweet,  
With charm of earliest birds; pleasant the sun,  
When first on this delightful land he spreads  
His orient beams on herb, tree, fruit and flower,  
Glistering with dew; fragrant the fertile earth  
After soft showers ; and sweet the coming on  
Of grateful Evening mild; then silent Night  
With this her solemn bird, and this fair moon,  
‘And these the gems of heaven, her starry train ;—  
But neither breath of morn, when she ascends  
With charm of earliest birds; nor rising sun  
On this delightful land; nor herb, fruit, flower,  
Glistering with dew; nor fragrance after showers;  
Nor grateful evening mild; nor silent night,  
With this her solemn bird; nor walk by moon  
Or glittering starlight, without thee ts sweet.”  
  
This passage has double charms for me, painted by the hand of  
truth ; and for the same reason that a dear friend of mine, after  
having viewed a profusion of beautiful pictures, pronounced  
that which represented the parting of Hector and Andromache  
to be worth them all, The journal in which this is mentioned,  
does not add any reason why it was so; but Portia felt its full  
force, and paid a grateful tear to the acknowledgment’,
