I cannot omit recommendg. a revisal of the laws on the subject of Naturalization. considering the ordinary chances of human life, a denial of citizenship under a residence of 14. years is a denial to the greater number. but this is directly opposite to the fundamental policy of the great portion of these states from their first settlement. and shall we in times when war and desolation are afflicting the other quarters of the earth refuse to their unhappy fugitives that hospitality which the savages of the wilderness extended to our fathers arriving in this land. shall oppressed humanity find no asylum on this globe? safety indeed may dictate that, for admission to offices of important trust, a residence should be required long enough to develope character &amp; design. some length of residence too may be necessary to guard against fraudulent usurpations of our flag. but the ordinary rights and capabilities of a citizen, &amp; especially that of transmitting inheritance, might surely be extended without danger to every one manifesting a bona fide purpose of embarking his life and fortunes permanently with u
