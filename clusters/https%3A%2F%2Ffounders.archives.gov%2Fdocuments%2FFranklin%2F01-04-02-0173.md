d thank you for the kind and judicious remarks you have made on my little Piece. Whatever further occurs to you on the same subject, you will much oblige me in communicating it.  
I have often observed with wonder, that Temper of the poor English Manufacturers and day Labourers which you mention, and acknowledge it to be pretty general. When any of them happen to come here, where Labour is much better paid than in England, their Industry seems to diminish in equal proportion. But it is not so with the German Labourers; They retain the habitual Industry and Frugality they bring with them, and now receiving higher Wages an accumulation arises that makes them all rich.  
When I consider, that the English are the Offspring of Germans, that the Climate they live in is much of the same Temperature; when I can see nothing in Nature that should create this Difference, I am apt to suspect it must arise from Institution, and I have sometimes doubted, whether the Laws peculiar to England which compel the Rich to maintain the Poor, have not given the latter, a Dependance that very much lessens the care of providing against the wants of old Age.  
I have heard it remarked that the Poor in Protestant Countries on the Continent of Europe, are generally more industrious than those of Popish Countries, may not the more numerous foundations in the latter for the relief of the poor have some effect towards rendering them less provident. To relieve the misfortunes of our fellow creatures is concurring with the Deity, ’tis Godlike, but if we provide encouragements for Laziness, and supports for Folly, may it not be found fighting against the order of God and Nature, which perhaps has appointed Want and Misery as the proper Punishments for, and Cautions against as well as necessary consequences of Idleness and Extravagancy.  
Whenever we attempt to mend the scheme of Providence and to interfere in the Government of the World, we had need be very circumspect lest we do more harm than Good. In New England they once thought Black-birds useless and mischievous to their corn, they made [Laws] to destroy them, the consequence was, the Black-birds were diminished but a kind of Worms which devoured their Grass, and which the Black-birds had been used to feed on encreased prodigiously; Then finding their Loss in Grass much greater than their saving in corn they wished again for their Black-birds.  
We had here some years since a Transylvanian Tartar, who had travelled much in the East, and came hither merely to see the West, intending to go home thro’ the spanish West Indies, China &amp;c. He asked me one day what I thought might be the Reason that so many and such numerous nations, as the Tartars in Europe and Asia, the Indians in America, and the Negroes in Africa, continued a wandring careless Life, and refused to live in Cities, and to cultivate the arts they saw practiced by the civilized part of Mankind. While I was considering what answer to make him; I’ll tell you, says he in his broken English, God make man for Paradise, he make him for to live lazy; man make God angry, God turn him out of Paradise, and bid him work; man no love work; he want to go to Paradise again, he want to live lazy; so all mankind love lazy. Howe’er this may be it seems certain, that the hope of becoming at some time of Life free from the necessity of care and Labour, together with fear of penury, are the mainsprings of most peoples industry.  
To those indeed who have been educated in elegant plenty, even the provision made for the poor may appear misery, but to those who have scarce ever been better provided for, such provision may seem quite good and sufficient, these latter have then nothing to fear worse than their present Conditions, and scarce hope for any thing better than a Parish maintainance; so that there is only the difficulty of getting that maintainance allowed while they are able to work, or a little shame they suppose attending it, that can induce them to work at all, and what they do will only be from hand to mouth.  
The proneness of human Nature to a life of ease, of freedom from care and labour appears strongly in the little success that has hitherto attended every attempt to civilize our American Indians, in their present way of living, almost all their Wants are supplied by the spontaneous Productions of Nature, with the addition of very little labour, if hunting and fishing may indeed be called labour when Game is so plenty, they visit us frequently, and see the advantages that Arts, Sciences, and compact Society procure us, they are not deficient in natural understanding and yet they have never shewn any Inclination to change their manner of life for ours, or to learn any of our Arts; When an Indian Child has been brought up among us, taught our language and habituated to our Customs, yet if he goes to see his relations and make one Indian Ramble with them, there is no perswading him ever to return, and that this is not natural [to them] merely as Indians, but as men, is plain from this, that when white persons of either sex have been taken prisoners young by the Indians, and lived a while among them, tho’ ransomed by their Friends, and treated with all imaginable tenderness to prevail with them to stay among the English, yet in a Short time they become disgusted with our manner of life, and the care and pains that are necessary to support it, and take the first good Opportunity of escaping again into the Woods, from whence there is no reclaiming them. One instance I remember to have heard, where the person was brought home to possess a good Estate; but finding some care necessary to keep it together, he relinquished it to a younger Brother, reserving to himself nothing but a gun and a match-Coat, with which he took his way again to the Wilderness.  
Though they have few but natural wants and those easily supplied. But with us are infinite Artificial wants, no less craving than those of Nature, and much more difficult to satisfy; so that I am apt to imagine that close Societies subsisting by Labour and Arts, arose first not from choice, but from necessity: When numbers being driven by war from their hunting grounds and prevented by seas or by other nations were crowded together into some narrow Territories, which without labour would not afford them Food. However as matters [now] stand with us, care and industry seem absolutely necessary to our well being; they should therefore have every Encouragement we can invent, and not one Motive to diligence be subtracted, and the support of the Poor should not be by maintaining them in Idleness, But by employing them in some kind of labour suited to their Abilities of body &amp;c. as I am informed of late begins to be the practice in many parts of England, where work houses are erected for that purpose. If these were general I should think the Poor would be more careful and work voluntarily and lay up something for themselves against a rainy day, rather than run the risque of being obliged to work at the pleasure of others for a bare subsistence and that too under confinement. The little value Indians set on what we prize so highly under the name of Learning appears from a pleasant passage that happened some years since at a Treaty between one of our Colonies and the Six Nations; when every thing had been settled to the Satisfaction of both sides, and nothing remained but a mutual exchange of civilities, the English Commissioners told the Indians, they had in their Country a College for the instruction of Youth who were there taught various languages, Arts, and Sciences; that there was a particular foundation in favour of the Indians to defray the expense of the Education of any of their sons who should desire to take the Benefit of it. And now if the Indians would accept of the Offer, the English would take half a dozen of their brightest lads and bring them up in the Best manner; The Indians after consulting on the proposal replied that it was remembered some of their Youths had formerly been educated in that College, but it had been observed that for a long time after they returned to their Friends, they were absolutely good for nothing being neither acquainted with the true methods of killing deer, catching Beaver or surprizing an enemy. The Proposition however, they looked on as a mark of the kindness and good will of the English to the Indian Nations which merited a grateful return; and therefore if the English Gentlemen would send a dozen or two of their Children to Onondago the great Council would take care of their Education, bring them up in really what was the best manner and make men of them.  
I am perfectly of your mind, that measures of great Temper are necessary with the Germans: and am not without Apprehensions, that thro’ their indiscretion or Ours, or both, great disorders and inconveniences may one day arise among us; Those who come hither are generally of the most ignorant Stupid Sort of their own Nation, and as Ignorance is often attended with Credulity when Knavery would mislead it, and with Suspicion when Honesty would set it right; and as few of the English understand the German Language, and so cannot address them either from the Press  or Pulpit, ’tis almost impossible to remove any prejudices they once entertain. Their own Clergy have very little influence over the people; who seem to take an uncommon pleasure in abusing and discharging the Minister on every trivial occasion. Not being used to Liberty, they know not how to make a modest use of it; and as Kolben says of the young Hottentots, that they are not esteemed men till they have shewn their manhood by beating their mothers, so these seem to think themselves not free, till they can feel their liberty in abusing and insulting their Teachers. Thus they are under no restraint of Ecclesiastical Government; They behave, however, submissively enough at present to the Civil Government which I wish they may continue to do: For I remember when they modestly declined intermeddling in our Elections, but now they come in droves, and carry all before them, except in one or two Counties; Few of their children in the Country learn English; they import many Books from Germany; and of the six printing houses in the Province, two are entirely German, two half German half English, and but two entirely English; They have one German News-paper, and one half German. Advertisments intended to be general are now printed in Dutch and English; the Signs in our Streets have inscriptions in both languages, and in some places only German: They begin of late to make all their Bonds and other legal Writings in their own Language, which (though I think it ought not to be) are allowed good in our Courts, where the German Business so encreases that there is continual need of Interpreters; and I suppose in a few years they will be also necessary in the Assembly, to tell one half of our Legislators what the other half say; In short unless the stream of their importation could be turned from this to other Colonies, as you very judiciously propose, they will soon so out number us, that all the advantages we have will not [in My Opinion] be able to preserve our language, and even our Government will become precarious. The French who watch all advantages, are now [themselves] making a German settlement back of us in the Ilinoes Country, and by means of those Germans they may in time come to an understanding with ours, and indeed in the last war our Germans shewed a general disposition that seems to bode us no good; for when the English who were not Quakers, alarmed by the danger arising from the defenceless state of our Country entered unanimously into an Association within this Government and the lower Countries [Counties] raised armed and Disciplined [near] 10,000 men, the Germans except a very few in proportion to their numbers refused to engage in it, giving out one among another, and even in print, that if they were quiet the French should they take the Country would not molest them; at the same time abusing the Philadelphians for fitting out Privateers against the Enemy; and representing the trouble hazard and Expence of defending the Province, as a greater inconvenience than any that might be expected from a change of Government. Yet I am not for refusing entirely to admit them into our Colonies: all that seems to be necessary is, to distribute them more equally, mix them with the English, establish English Schools where they are now too thick settled, and take some care to prevent the practice lately fallen into by some of the Ship Owners, of sweeping the German Goals to make up the number of their Passengers. I say I am not against the Admission of Germans in general, for they have their Virtues, their industry and frugality is exemplary; They are excellent husbandmen and contribute greatly to the improvement of a Country.  
I pray God long to preserve to Great Britain the English Laws, Manners, Liberties and Religion notwithstanding the complaints so frequent in Your public papers, of the prevailing corruption and degeneracy of your People; I know you have a great deal of Virtue still subsisting among you, and I hope the Constitution is not so near a dissolution, as some seem to apprehend; I do not think you are generally become such Slaves to your Vices, as to draw down that Justice Milton speaks of when he says that  
  
——sometimes Nations will descend so low  
From reason, which is virtue, that no Wrong,  
But Justice, and some fatal curse annex’d  
Deprives them of their outward liberty,  
Their inward lost. Parad: lost.  
  
In history we find that Piety, Public Spirit and military Prowess have their Flows, as well as their ebbs, in every nation, and that the Tide is never so low but it may rise again; But should this dreaded fatal change happen in my time, how should I even in the midst of the Affliction rejoice, if we have been able to preserve those invaluable treasures, and can invite the good among you to come and partake of them! O let not Britain seek to oppress us, but like an affectionate parent endeavour to secure freedom to her children; they may be able one day to assist her in defending her own—Whereas a Mortification begun in the Foot may spread upwards to the destruction of the nobler parts of the Body.  
I fear I have [already] extended this rambling letter beyond your patience, and therefore conclude with requesting your acceptance of the inclosed Pamphlet from Sir Your most humble servant

12 Diary of a Lover of Literature. [Jan.  
latter a dependance that very much lessens the care of providing against  
the wants of old age.  
  
“‘T have heard it remarked that the poor in Protestant countries, on the  
Continent of Europe, are generally more industrious than those of Popish  
countries. May not the more numerous foundations in the latter for  
relief of the poor, have some effect towards rendering them less provident ?  
To relieve the misfortunes of our fellow-creatures is concurring with the  
Deity,—it is godlike ; but if we provide encouragement for laziness, and  
  
‘supports for folly, may it not be found fighting against the order of God  
  
and Nature, which perhaps has appointed want and misery as the proper  
punishments for, and cautions against, as well as necessary consequences  
of, idleness and extravagance? Whenever we attempt to amend the scheme  
of Providence, and to interfere with the government of the world, we had  
need be very circumspect, lest we do more harm than good. In New  
England they once thought blackbirds useless, and mischievous to the corn.  
They made efforts to destroy them. The consequence was, the blackbirds  
were diminished ; but a kind of worm which devoured their grass, and  
which the blackbirds used to feed on, increased prodigiously ; then, find-  
ing their loss in grass much greater than their saving in corn, they wished  
again for their blackbirds.  
  
** We had here some years since a Transylvanian Tartar, who had tra-  
velled much in the East, and came hither merely to see the West, intend-  
ing to go home through the Spanish West Indies, China, &amp;c. He asked  
me one day, what I thought might be the reason that so many and such  
numerous nations, as the Tartars in Europe and Asia, the Indians in Ame-  
rica, and the Negroes in Africa, continued a wandering, careless life, and  
refused to live in cities, and cultivate the arts they saw practised by the  
civilized parts of mankind? While I was considering what answer to  
make him, he said, in his broken English, ‘*God make man for Paradise.  
He make him for live lazy. Man make God angry. God turn him out of  
Paradise, and bid workee. Man no love workee; he want to go to Para-  
dise again; he want to live lazy. So all mankind love lazy.” However  
this may be, it seems certain that the hope of becoming at some time of  
life free from the necessity of care and labour, together with fear of penury,  
are the main springs of most people&#x27;s industry. To those, indeed, who  
have been educated in elegant plenty, even the provision made for the  
poor may appear misery; but to those who have scarce ever been better  
provided for, such provision may seem quite good and sufficient. These  
latter then have nothing to fear worse than their present condition, and  
scarce hope for any thing better than a parish maintenance. So that  
there is only the difficulty of getting that maintenance allowed while they  
are able to work, or a little shame they suppose attending it, that can in-  
  
duce them to work at all; and what they do will only be from hand to  
mouth.

“ The proneness of human nature to a life of ease, of freedom from care  
and labour, appear strongly in the little success that has kitherto attended  
every attempt to civilize our American Indians. In their present way of  
living, almost all their wants are supplied by the spontaneous productions  
of nature, with the addition of very little labour, if hunting and fishing  
may indeed be called labour, where game is so plenty. They visit us fre-  
quently, and see the advantages that arts, sciences, and compact societies  
procure us. They are not deficient in natural understanding ; and yet they  
have never shown any inclination to change their manner of life for ours,  
or to learn any of our arts. When an Indian child has been brought up  
among us, taught our language, and habituated to our customs, yet if he  
goes to see his relatives, and makes one Indian ramble with them, there is  
no persuading him ever to return. And that this is not natural to them  
merely as Indians, but as men, is plain from this, that when white persons,  
of either sex, have been taken prisoners by the Indians, and lived awhile  
with them, though ransomed by their friends, and treated with all ima-  
ginable tenderness to prevail with them to stay among the English, yet in  
a short time they become disgusted with our manner of life, and the care  
and pains that are necessary to support it, and take the first opportunity  
of escaping again into the woods, from whence there is no redeeming  
them. One instance I remember to have heard, where the person was  
brought home to possess a good estate ; but finding some care necessary  
to keep it together, he relinquished it to a younger brother, reserving to  
himself nothing but a gun and a watch-coat, with which he took his way  
again into the wilderness.

years since, at a treaty between some Colonies, and the Six Nations.  
When every thing had been settled to the satisfaction of both sides, and  
nothing remained but a mutual exchange of civilities, the English Commis-  
sioners told the Indians that they had in their country a college for the  
instruction of youth, who were there taught various languages, arts, and  
sciences ; that there was a particular foundation in favour of the Indians  
to defray the expense of the education of any of their sons, who should  
desire to take the benefit of it: and said, if the [Indians would accept the  
offer, the English would take half a dozen of their brightest lads, and  
bring them up in the best manner. The Indians, after consulting on the  
proposals, replied ; that it was remembered that some of their youths had  
formerly been educated at that college, but that it had been observed that  
for a long time after they returned to their friends, they were absolutely  
good for nothing ; being neither acquainted with the true methods of kill-  
ing deer, catching beavers, or surprising an enemy. The proposition they  
looked on, however, as a mark of kindness, and good will of the English,  
to the Indian nations which merited a grateful return: and therefore, if  
the English gentlemen would send a dozen or two of their children to  
Opondago, the Great Council would take care of their education, bring them  
up in what was really the best manner, and make men of them.  
  
“J am perfectly of your mind that measures of great temper are necessary  
with the Germans ; and am not without apprehensions that, through their  
indiscretion, or ours, or both, great disorders may one day arise among us.  
Those who come hither are generally the most stupid of their own nation,  
and as ignorance is often attended with credulity, when knavery would  
mislead it ; and with suspicion when honesty would set it right; and as  
few of the English understand the German language, and so cannot address  
them either from the press or the pulpit, ’tis almost impossible to remove  
any prejudices they may entertain. Their clergy have very little influence  
on the people, who seem to take a pleasure in abusing and discharging the  
minister on every trivial occasion. Not being used to liberty, they know  
not how to make a modest use of it. And as Kolben says of the young  
Hottentots, that they are not esteemed men until they have shown their  
manhood by beating their mothers, so these seem not to think themselves  
free, till they can feel their liberty in abusing and insulting their teachers.  
Thus they are under no restraint from ecclesiastical government ; they  
behave, however, submissively enough at present to the civil government,  
which I wish they may continue to do, for I remember when they modestly  
declined intermeddling in our elections, but now they come in droves and  
carry all before them, except in one or two counties. Few of their children  
in the country know English. They import many books from Germany ;  
and of the six printing-houses in the provinces, two are entirely German,  
two half German, half English, and but two entirely English. ‘They have  
one German newspaper, and one half German. Advertisements intended

to be general, are now printed in Dutch and English. The signs in our  
streets have inscriptions in both languages, and in some places only Ger-  
man. They begin of late to make all their bonds, and other legal instru-  
ments in their own language, which (though, I think, it ought not to be)  
are allowed good in our courts, where the German business so increases,  
that there is continued need of interpreters: and, I suppose, in a few  
years, they will also be’necessary in the Assembly to tell one half of our  
legislators what the other half say. In short, unless the stream of their  
importation could be turned from this to other colonies, as you very judi-  
ciously propose, they will soon so outnumber us, that all the advantages  
we have, will, in my opinion, be not able to preserve our language, and  
even our government will become precarious. ‘The French, who watch all  
advantages, are now themselves making a German settlement, back of us  
in the Illinois country, and by means of these Germans they may in time  
come to an understanding with ours ; and, indeed, in the last war, our  
Germans showed a general disposition that seemed to bode us no good.  
For when the English, who were not Quakers, alarmed by the danger aris-  
ing from the defenceless state of our country, entered unanimously into an  
association, and within this government and the low countries, raised,  
armed, and disciplined near ten thousand men, the Germans, except a very  
few in proportion to their number, refused to engage in it : giving out, one  
amongst another, and even in print, that if they were quiet, the French,  
should they take the country, would not molest them; at the same time  
abusing the Philadelphians for fitting out privateers against the enemy :  
and representing the trouble, hazard, and expense of defending the pro-  
vince, as a greater inconvenience than any that might be expected from a  
change of government. Yet I am not for refusing to admit them entirely  
into our Colonies. All that seems to me necessary is, to distribute them  
more equally, mix them with the English, establish English schools, where  
they are now too thick settled : and take some care to prevent the practice  
lately fallen into by some of the ship-owners of sweeping the German gaols  
to make up the number of their passengers. I say, I am not against the  
admission of Germans in general, for they have their virtues ;—their in-  
dustry and frugality is exemplary. They are excellent husbandmen ; and  
contribute greatly to the improvement of a country.  
  
“] pray God to preserve long to Great Britain the English laws, manners,  
liberties, and religion. Notwithstanding the complaints so frequent in your  
public papers, of the prevailing corruption and degeneracy of the people,  
I know you have a great deal of virtue still subsisting among you; and I  
hope the Constitution is not so near a dissolution, as some seem to appre-  
hend. I do not think you are generally become such slaves to your vices  
as to draw down the justice Milton speaks of, when he says, that” .......

ittle piece. I have often observed with  
wonder that temper of the pvorer English  
labourers which you iain al lees  
ledge it to be pretty general. When any of  
  
them happen to come here, where labour is  
much better paid than in England, their  
industry seems to diminish in equal propor-  
tion. But it is not so with the German  
labourers: they retain the habitual industry  
and frugality they bring with them, and  
receiving higher wages, an accumulation  
arises that makes them all rich. When I  
consider that the English are the offspring of  
Germans, that the climate they live in is  
much of the same temperature, when I see  
nothing in nature that should create this  
difference, I am tempted to suspect it must  
arise from constitution; and I have some-  
times doubted whether the laws peculiar to  
England, which compel the rich to maintain  
the poor, have not given the latter a depend-  
ance that very much lessens the care of pro-  
viding against the wants of old age.  
  
“ T have heard it remarked that the pour  
in Protestant countries, on the continent of  
Europe, are generally more industrious than  
those of Popish countries. May not the  
more numerous foundations in the latter for  
relief of the poor, have some effect towards  
rendering them less provident? To relieve  
the mistortunes of our fellow-creatures is  
concurring with the Deity,—it is like ;  
but if we provide encouragement for laziness,  
and supports for folly, may it not be found  
fighting against the order of God and Nature,  
which, perhaps, has appointed want and  
misery asthe proper punishments for, and  
cautions against, as well as necessary con-  
sequences of, idleness and extravagance ?  
Whenever we attempt to amend the scheme  
of Providence, and to interfere with the  
government of the world, we had need be  
very cireumspect, lest we do more harm than  
  
In New England they once thought  
blackbirds useless, and mischievous to the  
corn. They made efforts to destroy them,  
The consequence was, the blackbirds were  
diminished ; but a kind of worm which  
devoured their grass, and which the black-  
birds used to feed on, increased prodigiously ;  
then, finding their loss in grass much greater  
than their saving in corn, they wished again  
for their blackbirds.  
  
“ We had here some years since a Transyl-  
vanian Tartar, who had travelled much in  
the East, and came hither merely to see the  
West, intending to go home through the  
Spanish West Indies, China, &amp;. He asked  
me one day, what I thought might be the  
reason that so many and such numerous  
nations, as the Tartars in Europe and Asia,  
the Indians in America, and the Negroes in  
Africa, continued a wandering, careless life,  
and refused to live in cities, and cultivate the  
arts they saw practised by the civilized parts  
of mankind? While I was considering what  
answer to make him, he said, in his broken  
English, “ God make man for Paradise. He  
man him for live lazy. Man make God  
  
  
  
  
  
  
a oe ee ee aE Sti OO!  
  
  
  
  
  
angry. God turn him out of Paradise, and  
bid workee. Man no love workee; he want  
to go to Paradise again; he want to live  
lazy. So all mankind love lazy.” However  
this may be, it seems certain that the hope  
of becoming at some time of life free from  
the necessity of care and labour, . together  
with fear of penury, are the mainsprings of  
most people’s industry. To those, indeed,  
who have been educated in elegant plenty,  
even the provision made for the poor may  
appear misery; but to those who have scarce  
ever been better provided for, such provision  
may seem quite good and sufficient. These  
latter then Ton nothing to fear worse than  
their present condition, and scarce hope for  
anything better than a parish maintenance.  
So that there is only the difficulty of getting  
that maintenance allowed while they are  
able to work, or a little shame they sup  
attending it, that can induce them tu work at  
all; and what they do will only be from hand  
to mouth.  
  
“ The proneness of human nature to a life  
of ease, of freedom from care and labour,  
appear strongly in the little success that has  
hitherto attended every attempt to civilize  
our American Indians. In their present  
way of living, almost all their wants are sup-  
plied by the spontaneous productions of nature,  
with the addition of very little labour, if  
hunting and fishing may indeed be called  
labour, where game is so plenty. They visit  
us frequently, and see the advantages that  
arts, sciences, and compact societies procure  
us. They are not deficient in natural under-  
standing; and yet they have never shown  
any inclination to change their manner of  
life for. ours, or to learn any of our arts.  
When an Indian child has been brought up  
among us, taught our language, and habi-  
tuated to our customs, yet if he goes to see  
his relatives, and m one Indian ramble  
with them, there is no persuading him ever  
to return. And that this is not natural to  
them merely as Indians, but as men, is plain  
from this, that when white persons, of either  
sex, have been taken prisoners by the Indians,  
and lived awhile with them, though ransomed  
by their friends, and treated with all imagi-  
nable tenderness to prevail with. them to stay  
among the English, yet in a short time they  
become disgusted with our manner of life,  
and the care and pains that are necessary to  
support it, and take the first opportunity of  
escaping again into the woods, from whence  
there is no redeeming them. One instance  
I remember to have Reard, where the person  
was brought home to possess a gocd estate ;  
but finding some care necessary to keep it  
together, he relinquished it to a younger  
brother, reserving to himself nothing but a  
gun and a watch-coat, with which he took  
his way again into the wilderness,

“ So that [ am apt to imagine that close  
Societies subsisting by labour and art, arose  
first not from choice but from necessity, when  
numbers being driven by war from their hunt-  
ing-grounds, and prevented by seas, or by  
other nations, from obtaining other hunting-  
grounds, were crowded together into some  
narrow territories, which without labour could  
not afford them food. However, as matters  
now stand with us, care and industry seem  
absolutely necessary to our well-being. They  
should therefore have every encouragement  
we can invent, and not one motive to dili-  
gence be subtracted, and the support of the  
poor should not be by maintaining them in  
idleness, but by employing them in some  
kind of labour suited to their abilities of body,  
&amp;c. as I am informed begins to be of late the  
practice in many parts of England, where  
workhouses are erected for that purpose. If  
these were general, I should think the poor  
would be more careful, and work voluntarily  
to lay up something for themselves against a  
rainy day, rather than run the risk of being  
obliged to work at the pleasure of others for  
a bare subsistence, and that too under con-  
finement. The little value Indians set on  
what we prize so highly, under the name of  
learning, appears from a pleasant passage  
that happened some years since, at a treaty  
between some colonies and the Six Nations.  
When everything had been settled to the  
satisfaction of both sides, and nothing re-  
mained but a mutual exchange of civilities,  
the English Commissioners told the Indians  
that they had in their country a college for  
the instruction of youth, who were there taught  
various languages, arts, and sciences ;  
there was a particular foundation in favour  
of the Indians to defray the expense of the  
education of any of their sons, who should  
desire to take the benefit of it: and said, if  
the Indians would accept the offer, the  
English would take half a dozen of their  
brightest lads, and bring them up in the  
best manner. The Indians, after consulting  
on the proposals, replied, that it was remem-  
bered that some of their youths had formerly  
been educated at that college, but that it had  
been observed that for a long time after they  
returned to their triends, they were absolutely  
good for nothing ; being neither acquainted  
with the true methods of killing deer, catch-  
ing beavers, or surprising an enemy. ‘The  
proposition they louked on, however, as a  
mark of kindness aud good will of the Eng-  
lish, to the Indian nations which merited a  
grateful return: and, therefore, if the English  
gentlemen would send a dozen or two of their  
children to Opondago, the Great Council  
would take care of their education, bring  
them up in what was really the best manner,  
aud make men of them.
