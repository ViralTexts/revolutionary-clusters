d Reader,  
Since the King and Parliament have thought fit to alter our Year, by taking eleven Days out of September, 1752, and directing us to begin our Account for the future on the First of January, some Account of the Changes the Year hath heretofore undergone, and the Reasons of them, may a little gratify thy Curiosity.  
The Vicissitude of Seasons seems to have given Occasion to the first Institution of the Year. Man naturally curious to know the Cause of that Diversity, soon found it was the Nearness and Distance of the Sun; and upon this, gave the Name Year to the Space of Time wherein that Luminary, performing his whole Course, returned to the same Point of his Orbit.  
And hence, as it was on Account of the Seasons, in a great Measure, that the Year was instituted, their chief Regard and Attention was, that the same Parts of the Year should always correspond to the same Seasons; i.e. that the Beginning of the Year should always be when the Sun was in the same Point of his Orbit; and that they should keep Pace, come round, and end together.  
This, different Nations aimed to attain by different Ways; making the Year to commence from different Points of the Zodiac; and even the Time of his Progress different. So that some of their Years were much more perfect than others, but none of them quite just; i.e. none of them but whose Parts shifted with regard to the Parts of the Sun’s Course.  
It was the Egyptians, if we may credit Herodotus, that first formed the Year, making it to contain 360 Days, which they subdivided into twelve Months, of thirty Days each.  
Mercury Trismegistus added five Days more to the Account. And on this Footing Thales is said to have instituted the Year among the Greeks. Tho’ that Form of the Year did not ho

, are all different.  
In effect, considering the poor State of Astronomy in those Ages, it is no Wonder different People should disagree in the Calculus of the Sun’s Course. We are even assured by Diodorus Siculus, Plutarch, and Pliny, that the Egyptian Year itself was at first very different from what it became afterwards.  
According to our Account, the Solar Year, or the Interval of Time in which the Sun finishes his Course thro’ the Zodiac, and returns to the same Point thereof from which he had departed, is 365 Days, 5 Hours, 49 Minutes; tho’ some Astronomers make it a few Seconds, and some a whole Minute less; as Kepler, for Instance, who makes it 365 Days, 5 Hours, 48 Minutes, 57 Seconds, 39 Thirds. Ricciolus, 365 Days, 5 Hours, 48 Minutes. Tycho Brahe, 365 Days, 5 Hours, 48 Minutes.  
The Civil Year is that Form of the Year which each Nation has contrived to compute Time by; or the Civil is the Tropical Year, considered as only consisting of a certain Number of whole Days; the odd Hours and Minutes being set aside, to render the Computation of Time in the common Occasions of Life more easy.  
Hence as the Tropical Year is 365 Days, 5 Hours, 49 Minutes; the Civil Year is 365 Days. And hence also, as it is necessary to keep Pace with the Heavens, it is required that every fourth Year consist of 366 Days, which would for ever keep the Year exactly right, if the odd Hours of each Year were precisely 6.  
The ancient Roman Year, as first settled by Romulus, consisted of ten Months only; viz. I. March, containing 31 Days. II. April, 30. III. May, 31. IV. June 30. V. Quintilis, 31. VI. Sextilis, 30. VII. September, 30. VIII. October, 31. IX. November, 30. X. December, 30; in all 304

 of the Solar Year, by 61 Days.  
Hence the Beginning of Romulus’s Year was vague, and unfixed to any precise Season; which Inconvenience to remove, that Prince ordered so many Days to be added yearly, as would make the State of the Heavens correspond to the first Month, without incorporating these additional Days, or calling them by the Name of any Month.  
  
Numa Pompilius corrected this irregular Constitution of the Year, and composed two new Months, January and February, of the Days that were used to be added to the former Year. Thus, Numa’s Year consisted of twelve Months; viz. I. January, containing 29 Days. II. February, 28. III. March, 31. IV. April, 29. V. May, 31. VI. June, 29. VII. Quintilis, 31. VIII. Sextilis, 29. IX. September, 29. X. October, 31. XI. November, 29. XII. December, 29; in all 355 Days, which came short of the common Solar Year by ten Days; so that its Beginning was vague and unfixed.  
Numa, however, desiring to have it fixed to the Winter Solstice, ordered 22 Days to be intercalated in February every second Year, 23 every fourth, 22 every sixth, and 23 every eighth Year.  
But this Rule failing to keep Matters even, Recourse was had to a new Way of Intercalating; and instead of 23 Days every eighth Year, only 15 were added; and the Care of the whole committed to the Pontifex Maximus, or High Priest; who, neglecting the Trust, let Things run to the utmost Confusion. And thus the Roman Year stood till Julius Caesar made a Reformation.  
The Julian Year is a Solar Year, containing commonly 365 Days; tho’ every fourth Year, called Bissextile, contains 366. The Names and Order of the Months of the Julian Year, and the Number of Days in each, are well known to us, having been long in Use.  
The astronomical Quantity, therefore, of the Julian Year, is 365 Days, 6 Hours, which exceeds the true Solar Year by 11 Minutes; which Excess in 131 Years amounts to a whole Day. And thus the Roman Year stood, till the Reformation made therein by Pope Gregory.  
Julius Caesar, in the Contrivance of his Form of the Year, was assisted by Sosigenes, a famous Mathematician, called over from Egypt for this very Purpose; who, to supply the Defect of 67 Days which had been lost thro’ the Fault of the High Priests, and to fix the Beginning of the Year to the Winter Solstice, made that Year to consist of 15 Months, or 445 Days; which for that Reason is used to be called Annus Confusionis, the Year of Confusion.  
This Form of the Year was used by all Christian Nations, till the Middle of the 16th Century; and still continues to be so by several Nations; among the Rest, by the Swedes, Danes, &amp;c. and by the English till the second of September next, when they are to assume the Use of the Gregorian Year.  
  
The Gregorian Year is the Julian Year corrected by this Rule; that whereas on the common Footing, every Secular or Hundredth Year, is Bissextile; on the new Footing, three of them are common Years, and only the fourth Bissextile.  
The Error of eleven Minutes in the Julian Year, little as it was, yet, by being repeated over and over, at length became considerable; and from the Time when Caesar made his Correction, was grown into 13 Days, by which the Equinoxes were greatly disturbed. To remedy this Irregularity, which was still a growing, Pope Gregory the XIII. called together the chief Astronomers of his Time, and concerted this Correction; and to restore the Equinoxes to their Place threw out the ten Days that had been got from the Council of Nice, and which had shifted the fifth of October to the 15th.  
In the Year 1700, the Error of ten Days was grown to eleven; upon which the Protestant States of Germany, to prevent further Confusion, accepted the Gregorian Correction. And now in 1752, the English follow their Example.  
Yet is the Gregorian Year far from being perfect, for we have shewn, that, in four Centuries, the Julian Year gains three Days, one Hour, twenty Minutes: But it is only the three Days are kept out in the Gregorian Year; so that here is still an Excess of one Hour, twenty Minutes, in four Centuries; which in 72 Centuries will amount to a whole Day.  
As to the Commencement of the Year, the legal Year in England used to begin on the Day of the Annunciation; i.e. on the 25th of March; tho’ the historical Year began on the Day of the Circumcision; i.e. the first of January, on which Day the Italian and German Year also begins; and on which Day ours is to begin from this Time forward, the first Day of January being now by Act of Parliament declared the first Day of the Year 1752.  
At the Yearly Meeting of the People called Quakers, held in London, since the Passing of this Act, it was agreed to recommend to their Friends

May. V Month.  
  
And when too populous at length confess’d,  
From confluent Strangers refug’d and redress’d:  
When War so long withdraws his barb’rous Train,  
That Peace o’er stocks us with the Sons of Men:  
So long Health breathes thro’ the pure ambient Air,  
That Want must prey on those Disease would spare;  
Then will be all the gen’rous Goddess seen,  
Then most diffus’d she shines, and most benign.  
  
’Tis more noble to forgive, and more manly to despise, than to revenge an Injury.  
A Brother may not be a Friend, but a Friend will always be a Brother.  
Meanness is the Parent of Insolence.  
June. VI Month.  
  
Her Eye far piercing, round extends its Beams,  
To Erie’s Banks, or smooth Ohio’s Streams,  
It fixes where kind Rays till then have smil’d,  
  
(Vain Smile!) on some luxuriant houseless Wild;  
How many Sons of Want might here enjoy  
What Nature gives for Age but to destroy?  
“Blush, blush, O Sun (she cries) here vainly found  
To rise, to set, to roll the Seasons round!  
  
Mankind are very odd Creatures: One Half censure what they practise, the other half practise what they censure; the rest always say and do as they ought.  
Severity is often Clemency; Clemency Severity.  
July. VII Month.  
  
“Shall Heav’n distil in Dews, descend in Rain,  
From Earth gush Fountains, Rivers flow in vain?  
There shall the watry Lives in Myriads stray,  
And be, to be alone each other’s Prey?  
Unsought shall here the teeming Quarries own  
The various Species of mechanic Stone?  
From Structure This, from Sculpture That confine?  
Shall Rocks forbid the latent Gem to shine?  
  
Bis dat qui cito dat: He gives twice that gives soon; i.e. he will soon be called upon to give again.  
A Temper to bear much, will have much to bear.  
Pride dines upon Vanity, sups on Contempt.  
August. VIII Month.  
  
“Shall Minds obedient aid no Artist’s Care,  
Nor give the martial Sword and peaceful Share?  
Ah! shall they never precious Ore unfold,  
To smile in Silver, or to flame in Gold?  
Shall here the vegetable World alone,  
For Joys, for various Virtues rest unknown?  
  
While Food and Physic, Plants and Herbs supply,  
Here must they shoot alone to bloom and die?  
  
Great Merit is coy, as well as great Pride.  
An undutiful Daughter, will prove an unmanageable Wife.  
Old Boys have their Playthings as well as young Ones; the Difference is only in the Price.  
September. IX Month.  
  
“Shall Fruits, which none, but brutal Eyes survey,  
Untouch’d grow ripe, untasted drop away?  
Shall here th’irrational, the salvage Kind  
Lord it o’er Stores by Heav’n for Man design’d,  
And trample what mild Suns benignly raise,  
While Man must lose the Use, and Heav’n the Praise?  
Shall it then be?” (Indignant here she rose,  
Indignant, yet humane, her Bosom glows.)  
  
The too obliging Temper is evermore disobliging itself.  
Hold your Council before Dinner; the full Belly hates Thinking as well as Acting.  
October. X Month.  
  
“No! By each honour’d Grecian Roman Name,  
By Men for Virtue Deified by Fame,  
Who peopled Lands, who model’d infant State,  
And then bad Empire be maturely great,  
By These I swear (be witness Earth and Skies!)  
Fair Order here shall from Confusion rise,  
Rapt I a future Colony survey!  
Come then, ye Sons of Mis’ry! come away!  
  
  
The Brave and the Wise can both pity and excuse; when Cowards and Fools shew no Mercy.  
Ceremony is not Civility; nor Civility Ceremony.  
If Man could have Half his Wishes, he would double his Troubles.  
November. XI Month.  
  
“Let Those, whose Sorrows from Neglect are known,  
(Here taught compell’d empower’d) Neglect attone!  
Let Those enjoy (who never merit Woes)  
In Youth th’industrious Wish, in Age Repose!  
Allotted Acres (no reluctant Soil)  
Shall prompt their Industry, and pay their Toil.  
Let Families, long Strangers to Delight,  
Whom wayward Fate dispers’d, by Me unite;  
  
It is ill Jesting with the Joiner’s Tools, worse with the Doctor’s.  
Children and Princes will quarrel for Trifles.  
Praise to the undeserving, is severe Satyr.  
December. XII Month.  
  
“Here live enjoying Life, see Plenty, Peace;  
Their Lands encreasing as their Sons increase!  
As Nature yet is found in leafy Glades  
To intermix the Walks with Lights and Shades;  
Or as with Good and Ill, in chequer’d Strife,  
Various the Goddess colours human Life;  
So in this fertile Clime if yet are seen  
Moors, Marshes, Cliffs, by Turns to intervene:  
  
Success has ruin’d many a Man.  
  
Great Pride and Meanness sure are near ally’d;  
Or thin Partitions do their Bounds divide.  
  
“Where Cliffs, Moors, Marshes desolate the View,  
Where haunts the Bittern, and where screams the Mew,  
Where prowls the Wolf, where roll’d the Serpent lies,  
Shall solemn Fanes, and Halls of Justice rise.  
And Towns shall open (all of Structure fair!)  
To bright’ning Prospects, and to purest Air,  
Frequented Ports and Vineyards green succeed,  
And Flocks encreasing whiten all the Mead;  
On Science Science, Arts on Arts refine;  
On these from high all Heav’n shall smiling shine,  
And Publick Spirit here a People show,  
Free num’rous pleas’d and busy all below.  
Learn future Natives of this promis’d Land,  
What your Forefathers ow’d my saving Hand!  
Learn when Despair such sudden Bliss shall see,  
Such Bliss must shine from Providence thro’ ME!  
Do you the neighb’ring blameless Indian aid,  
Culture what he neglects, not His invade;  
Dare not, oh dare not, with ambitious View,  
Force or demand Subjection never due;  
Let by My specious Name no Tyrants rise,  
And cry, while they enslave, they civilize!  
Know, Liberty and I are still the same,  
Congenial!—ever mingling Flame with Flame!  
Nor let me Afric’s sable Children see,  
Vended for Slaves tho’ form’d by Nature free;  
If These you dare, albeit unjust Success  
Empow’rs you now unpunish’d to oppress,  
Revolving Empire you and yours may doom  
(Rome all subdu’d, yet Vandals vanquish’d Rome)  
Yes, Empire may revolve, give them the Day,  
And Yoke may Yoke, and Blood may Blood repay.”  
Thus (Ah! how far unequall’d by my Lays,  
  
Unskill’d the Heart to melt or Mind to raise)  
Sublime benevolent deep sweetly clear,  
Worthy a Thomson’s Muse, an ----’s Ear,  
Thus spoke the Goddess. Thus I faintly tell  
In what lov’d Works Heav’n gives her to excel.  
But who her Sons, that to her Int’rest true,  
Still plan with Wisdom, and with Zeal pursue?  
These found most frequent in Life’s middle State,  
Rich without Gold, and without Titles great:  
Knowledge of Books and Men exalts their Thought,  
In Wit accomplish’d tho’ in Wiles untaught,  
Careless of Whispers meant to wound their Name,  
Nor sneer’d nor brib’d from Virtue into Shame;  
In Letters elegant, in Honour bright,  
Form’d to give Happiness, their sole Delight.  
When Gifts like these conferr’d by bounteous Heav’n,  
Talents and Will to the same Person giv’n,  
The Man ennobled doth an Hero rise,  
Fame and his Virtues lift him to the Skies.  
While we admire what we can’t imitate,  
Deny’d by Nature, and forbid by Fate.  
O! were I form’d to share this heav’nly Fire,  
In Parts and Pow’rs strong as in Desire,  
Moses, Lycurgus, Numa I revere,  
Their Wisdom great, their Love to Man sincere,  
By Publick Spirit rank’d the first of M

The Gregorian Year, or what is commonly termed New  
Stile, is the Fu/ian Year correéted by this Rule ; that whereas  
on the common Footing every fecular or hundredth Year is  
Biffextile; on the new Footing, three of them are common  
Years, and only the 4th Biffextile.  
  
The Error of 11 Minutes in the Yudian Year, little as it was,  
yet by being repeated over and over, at length became confide -  
rable ; and from the Time when Czfar made his Correétion  
was grown into 13 Days, by which Means the Equinoxes were  
greatly. difturbed. — &#x27;T&#x27;o —_ this Itregularity, which wa:  
Kill growing, Pope Gregory X1IT. called together the Chief of  
the Aftronomers of his ‘lime, and concerted this Correétion ;  
and to reftore the Equinoxes to their Place, threw out the to  
Days that had been got from the ‘Time of the Council of Nice,  
and which had fhifted the ¢th of Ofoder to the 15th.  
  
In the Year 1700, the Error of 10 Days was grown to 11 ;  
upon which at the Diet of Rati/éon, the fame Year, it was de-  
creed by the whole Body of the Proreftants of the Empire to  
retrench 11 Days, from the Old Stile, and accomodate their  
Computation to the New for the future: The fame Regulation  
has fince paffed in Saveden and .Denmark. ~ Englend fill holds  
out; but, according to fome Advices, we are ipeedily to expect  
the like Alteration.  
  
Notwithftanding the Gregorian Year is reduced to {uch a State  
of Correénefs, yet it is far from being quite pertett ;* for we  
have fhewn, that in four Centuries, the 7u/ian Year gains three  
Days, one Hour, 20 Minutes; but it is only the three Days  
which are kept out in the Gregorian Year: fo that here is ftill  
an Excefs of one Hour, 20 Minutes, in fourCenturies; which  
in 72 Centuries amount to a whole Day.  
  
The New, or Gregorian Stile, is the Manner of ¢ *  
fettled by the above named Pope Gregory, and is followed by  
all the Catholicks in Europe.

The Gregorian Year, so named from Pope Gregory XIII., by whom it  
was introduced in 1582, is the Julian year corrected by this rule; — that  
whereas, on the former footing, every hundredth year is bissextile, on  
the new footing every four-hundredth year only is bissextile ; the others,  
viz. the first, second, and third hundredth years, being common years.  
Thus, by sinking 3 days in 400 years, being the error of about 1 day  
in 130; and consequently by making the years 1700, 1800, and 1900  
to be common years, and the year 2000 bissextile or leap year, the

first very different from what it became after-  
| wards.  
  
According to our account of the solar year, or  
the interval of time in whics the sun finishes his  
course through the zodiac and returns to the  
same point thereof from which he had departed,  
is 365 days, 5 hours and 49 minutes; though  
some astronomers make it less; as Kepler, for  
instance, who makes it 365 days, 5 hours, 48  
ininutes, 56 seconds, 48 thirds. Recciolus, 365  
days, 5 hours, 48 minutes. Tycho Brahe, 365  
days, 5 hours, 48 minutes.  
  
The civil year is the form of year which each  
nation has contrived to compute time by, or the  
civil is the trophical year considered as only con-  
sisting of a certain number of whole days, the  
odd hours and minutes being set aside to render  
the computations of time in the common occa-  
sions of life more easy.  
  
Hence, as the tropical year is 365 days, 5  
hours, 49 minutes, the civil year is only 365 days:  
  
| and hence, also, as it is necessary to keep pace  
  
with the heavens, it is required that every fourth  
year consists of 366 days, which would forever  
keep the year exactly right, if the odd hours of  
each year were exactly six.  
  
The ancient Romao year, as first settled by  
Romulus, consisted of 10 months only, viz :—  
  
First, Mareh containing 31 days; second,  
April, 30 days; third, May, 31 days; fourth,  
June, 30 days; filth, Quintiles, 31 days; sixth,  
Seatiles, 30 days; seventh, September, 30 days;

Change of the Style.—Since the king and parlia-  
ment have thought fit to aller the year, by taking  
  
11 days out of September, 1752, and directing  
  
us lo vegin our account for the future on the  
first of January, some account of the changes the  
yeat hath undergone may a little gratify public  
curiosily.  
  
The vicissitudes of seasons seem to have given  
occasion to the first institution of the year. Men,  
naturally curious (o kuow the cause of the diver-  
sity, soon found it was the nearness and distance  
of the sun ; aud upon this gave the name year lo  
the space of time wherein that luminary, perlorm-  
ing his whole course, returned tu the same point  
of his orbit.  
  
And hence, as it was on account of the seasons  
in a great measure the year was instiluted, their  
chiet regard and attention was that the same  
parts of the year should always correspond to the  
same seasons; that the beginning of the year  
should always be when the sun was in the same  
poiui of his orbit, and that they should keep  
pace, come around and end together.  
  
This diflerent nations aimed to attain by dif-  
ferent ways; making the year to commence trom  
different points of the zodiac ; and even the time  
of his progress different. So that some of their  
years were much more periect than others, but  
none of them quite just, that is none of them but  
whose parts shilted with regard tu parts of the  
sun’s course.  
  
lt was the Sgyptians, if we may credit Hero-  
dotus, that first formed the year—making it lo  
contain 360 days, which they subdivided into 12  
months of 30 days each.  
  
Mercury ‘J&#x27;rismegesties added five days more  
to the angount, ani on this footing Thales is said  
to have instituted the year among the Greeks,  
though that form did not hold thrgughout al

Hence, the beginning of Romulus’ year was  
vague and unfixed in apy precise seasou—to re-  
| move which immcunvenience that Prince ordered so  
| many days to be added yearly as would make  
| the state of the heavens correspond to the first  
) mouth, without meorporating these additional  
| d.ys or cailing them by the name of any month.  
| Numa Pompilius corrected this irregular con-  
stitution of the year, and composed two new  
months, January and February, of the days that  
/used to be added to the former year. Thus  
| Numa’s year consisted of twelve months in all,  
‘containing 355 days, which came shortof the  
‘commen solar year by 10 days, so that its begin-  
/ping was vague aud unfixed. Numa, bowever,  
desiring to have it fixed to the winter solstice,  
ordered 22 duys to be interculated to February  
every second year, 23 every fourth, 22 every  
sixth, and 23 every eighth.  
  
But the rule failing to keep matters even, re-  
course was had to a new way ol swilerculating;  
and instead of 23 days every eighth year ouly 15  
were added, and the care ol the whole committed  
to the Pontifex Maximus, or bigh priest, who  
neglected the trust, let things run on to the ul-  
most confusion, and thus the Roman year stood  
until Julius Caesar made a reformation,  
  
The Julian year is a solar year, containing  
commonly 365 days, though every fourth year,  
called Bissextile, contained 366. The names  
and order of «the months of the Julian year, and  
the number uf days in each, are well kaown to  
us, having been loug in use.  
  
The astronomical quantity therefore, in the  
Julian. year is 365 days and 6 hours, which ex-  
ceeds the true solar year by Ll minutes; which  
excess in 131 years amounts to a whole day, and  
thus the Roman year stood till the reformation  
made therein by Pope Gregory.  
  
Julius Cesar, in the conirivance of his form of  
the year, was assisted by Sosigenes, a famous  
mathematician calied over from Egypt, for the  
very purpose, to supply the defect of 67 days  
whieh had been lost by the neglect of the high  
priests, and to fix the: beginning of the year to  
ihe winter solstices, made to consist of 15  
months, or 445 days; lor which it used to be  
calied Annus Confusions, or the Year of Confu-  
sions.  
  
‘This form of the year was used by all Chris-  
tian pations t:/l the middie of the 16th centary,  
and continues to be so by several nations ; among  
the rest by the Swedes, Danes, &amp;c., and by the  
English till the 2d of September neat, (1752),  
when they are to assume the Gregorial year.
