The arrival of the French Fleet upon the Coast of America is a great, &amp;  
striking event; but the operations of it have been injured by a number of unforeseen  
&amp; unfavourable cercumstances—which, tho they  ought not to  
detract from the merit, and good intention of our great Ally, has nevertheless lessened  
the importance of their Services in a great degree—The length of the passage in the  
first instance was a capitol misfortune, for had even one of common length taken place,  
Lord Howe with the British Ships of War and all the Transports in the River Delaware  
must, inevitably, have fallen; and Sir Harry must have had better luck than is commonly  
dispensed to Men of his profession, under such circumstances, if he and his Troops had  
not shared (at least) the fate of Burgoyne—The long passage of Count D’Estaign was  
succeeded by an unfavourable discovery at the hook, which hurt us in two respects; first  
in a defeat of the enterprize upon New York—the Shipping—&amp; Troops at that place;  
and next, in the delay that was used in ascertaining the depth of Water over the Bar;  
which was essential to their entrance into the Harbour of New York—And lastly after the  
enterprize upon Rhode Island had been planned, and was in the moment of execution, that  
Lord Howe with the British Ships should interpose, merely to create a diversion, and  
draw the French fleet from the Island was again unlucky, as the Count had not return’d  
on the 17th to the Island tho drawn off from it the 10th; by which means the Land  
operations were retarded, and the whole subject to a miscarriage in case of the arrival  
of Byrons Squadron.
