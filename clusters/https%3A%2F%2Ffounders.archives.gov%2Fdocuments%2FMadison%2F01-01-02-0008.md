If I should set off from this place as soon as I expect you may look for me in October perhaps a little before the middle if the weather should be good. We have no publick news but the base conduct of the Merchants in N. York in breaking through their spirited resolutions not to import, a distinct account of which I suppose will be in the Virginia Gazete before this arrives. their Letter to the Merchants in Philadelphia requesting their concurrence was lately burnt by the Students of this place in the college Yard, all of them appearing in their black Gowns &amp; the bell Tolling. The number of Students has increased very much of late; there are about an hundred &amp; fifteen in College &amp; the Grammar School, twenty two commence this Fall, all of them in American Cloth.
