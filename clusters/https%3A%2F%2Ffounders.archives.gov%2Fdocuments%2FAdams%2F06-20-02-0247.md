Dear sir  
Boston Octr. 4th: 1790  
  
With pleasure I received your Letter of Septr. 12th; and as our good friend, to whom I dictated my last is yet in Town; I have requested of him a second favour—  
You ask what the World is about to become? and, Is the Millenium commencing? I have not studied the Prophesies, and cannot even conjecture. The Golden Age so finely pictured by Poets, I beleive has never yet existed; but in their own imaginations. In the earliest  
  
periods, when for the honor of human nature, one should have thought, that man had not learnt to be cruel; what Scenes of horror have been exhibited in families of some of the best instructors in Piety, and morals! Even the heart of our first father was grievously wounded at the sight of the murder of one of his Sons, perpetrated by the hand of the other.— Has Mankind since seen the happy Age? No, my friend. The same Tragedy’s have been acted in the Theatre of the World; the same Arts of tormenting have been studied, and practiced to this day; and true religion, and reason united have never succeeded to establish the permanent foundations of political freedom, and happiness in the most enlightened Countries on the Earth.— After a compliment to Boston Town meetings, and our Harvard College as having “set the universe in Motion”; you tell me Every Thing will be pulled down; I think with you, “so much seems certain,” but what say you, will be built up?  
Hay, wood, and stuble may probably be the materials, ’till Men shall be yet more enlightned, and more friendly to each other— “Are there any Principles of Political Architecture”? Undoubtedly. “What are they?”— Philosophers ancient, and modern have laid down different plans, and all have thought themselves, Masters of the true Principles. Their disciples have followed them, probably with a blind prejudice, which is always an Enemy to truth, and have thereby added fresh fuel to the fire of Contention, and increased the political disorder— Kings have been deposed by aspiring Nobles, whose pride could not brook restraint— These have waged everlasting War, against the common rights of Men.— The Love of Liberty is interwoven in the Soul of Man, and can never be totally extinguished; and there are certain periods when human patience can no longer endure indignity, and oppression. The spark of liberty then kindles into a flame; when the injured people attentive to the feelings of their just rights magnanimously contend for their compleat restoration But such contests have too often ended in nothing more than “a change of Impostures, and impositions.” The Patriots of Rome put an End to the Life of Cæsar; and Rome submitted to a Race of Tyrants in his stead. Were the People of England free, after they had obliged King John to concede to them their ancient rights, and Libertys, and promise to govern them according to the Old Law of the Land? Were they free, after they had wantonly deposed their Henrys, Edwards, and Richards to gratify family pride? Or, after they had brought their first Charles to the block, and banished his family? They were not— The Nation was then governed by King, Lords, and Commons, and its Libertys were  
  
lost by a strife among three Powers, soberly intended to check each other, and keep the scales even. But while we daily see the violence of the human passions controuling the Laws of Reason and religion, and stifling the very feelings of humanity; can we wonder, that in such tumults little, or no regard is had to Political Checks, and Ballances? And such tumults have always happened within as well as without doors. The best formed constitutions that have yet been contrived by the wit of Man have, and will come to an End—because “the Kingdoms of the Earth have not been governed by Reason.” The Pride of Kings, of Nobles, and leaders of the People who have all governed in their turns, have dissadjusted the delicate frame, and thrown all into confusion— What then is to be done?— Let Divines, and Philosophers, Statesmen and Patriots unite their endeavours to renovate the Age by impressing the Minds of Men with the importance of educating their little Boys, and Girls—of inculcating in the Minds of Youth the fear, and Love of the Deity, and universal Phylanthropy; and in subordination to these great principles the Love of their Country—of instructing them in the Art of self government, without which they never can act a wise part in the Government of Societys great, or small—in short of leading them in the Study, and Practice of the exalted Virtues of the Christian system; which will happily tend to subdue the turbulent passions of Men, and introduce that Golden Age beautifully described in figurative language; when the Wolf shall dwell with the Lamb, and the Leopard lie down with the Kid—the Cow, and the bear shall feed; their Young ones shall lie down together, and the Lyon shall eat straw like the Ox—none shall then hurt, or destroy—for the Earth shall be full of the Knowledge of the Lord— When this Millenium shall commence, if there shall be any need of Civil Government, indulge me in the fancy that it will be in the Republican form, or something better—  
I thank you for your Countenance to our friend Lyde— Mrs. Adams tells me to remember her to yourself, Lady, and Connections; And be assured that I am sincerely / Your friend—

LETTER II.  
Boston, October 4, 1790,  
  
DEAR Sik,  
  
W ITH pleasure i received your letter of September 12th:  
And as our good friend, to whom I diétated my laft, is  
vet in town, i have requetted of hima second favour.  
  
You ask, what the world is about to become? and, 18 the mil-  
lennium commencing ? JT have not fludied the propheties, and  
cannot even conjecture. The golden age, so finely pictured by  
pocis, I believe has never yet exifted, but in their own imagina-  
tions, In the earlicft periods, when, for the honor of human  
nature, one fhould have thought man had not learnt to be cruel,  
what scenes of horror have been exhibited in families of some  
of the beft inftruGors in piety and morals! Even the heart of  
our firft father was gricvously wounded at the fight of the mur-  
der of one of his sons, perpetrated by the hand of the other.—  
Has mankind fince seen the happy age? No, my friend. The  
same tragedies have been ated on the theatre of the world, the  
same arts of tormenting have been ftudied and prattised to this  
day ; andeven religion and reason united, have never sccceeded  
to eftablish the permanent foundations of political freedom and  
happiness, in the moft enlightened countries onthe earth. After  
a compliment to Bofton town-meetings, and our Harvard Cols  
lege, as having “set the universe in motion,” youtell me, Every  
thing willbe pulled down. I think with you, “ So much seems  
ceriain.” But what, say you, will be built up? Hay, wood, ane  
ftubble, may probably be the materials, till men shail be yet more  
enlightedand mere ftricndi, to each other. ‘Are there any  
principles of politic achitecture ?” Undoubtedly. ‘ What are  
they ?”? Philosophers, aucient and modern, have laid down difs  
ferent plans, and ail have thought tnemselves maiters of the true  
princivles. ‘heir disciples have foliewed them, probably witle  
2 bhad prejudice, which ts always au oncmy to truth, and have  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
f 186 ] POLITi€AL PRINCIPLES OF  
  
‘thereby added fresh fuel to the fire of contention, and increaséd  
  
the political disorder.  
  
Kings have been deposed by aspiring nobles, whose pride could  
not brook reftraint. ‘These have waged everlafting war, againft  
the common rights of men. The love of liberty is interwoven  
in the soul ofman, and can never be totally extinguished, and  
there are certain periods when human patience can no longer en-  
dure indignity and opprefiion. &quot;The spark of iiberty then kindles  
into ig when the injured people, attentive to the feelings of  
their judi rights, magnanimously contend for their complete res-  
toration. Bui such conteils have too often ended in nothing  
more than “a change of impoftors and impcfitions.”? ‘The pate  
  
sots-of Home put a an end to the lite of Cesar, and Rome sub-  
mitted to a race of tyrants in his tlead. Were the people ot  
Enciand free, after they had obliged king John to concede to  
them their ancient rights and Eber ties, and promised to govern  
them according to the old law of the land? Were they free after  
they had wantonly deposed ther Henrys, Edwards, and Rich-  
ards, to gratify family pride? Or after they had brought their  
firtt Chat Log to the block, and banished his family ? T hey were  
not. The nation was then governed by King, Lords and Com-  
mons ; and its hberties were loft by a Crife among three pow-  
ers, soberly mtended to check each other, and keep the scales  
even.  
  
But while we daily see the violence of the human paffions con-  
troling the laws of reason and religion, and itifling the very feel-  
ings of humanity, can we wonder that in such tumults, little or no  
reyard-is had to political checks aud ballances? And such tu-  
  
miults have always hanpened within as well as without doors.  
The beft formed conttitutions that have yet been contrived by  
the wit of man, have and will come to an end; ecause “ the  
  
cingcoms of the earth have not been governed by reason.” ‘Lhe  
pride of kings, ofnobles, and leaders of the people, who have all  
governed im theit turns, have disadjulted the delicate frame and  
thrown allinto contulion.  
  
What then is&#x27;to be done? Let divines and philosophers,  
ftatesmen and patriots, unite their endeavors to renovate the age,  
by impretling the mincs of men with the importance of educa-  
ting their “tle boysand girls—of inculcating in the minds of

our independence, viz, by elevating the character  
of our population, and instructing our children in  
the great principles of morality and religiom  
&quot;Kings have been deposed by aspiring nobles,  
whose pride could not brook restraint. These have  
waged everlasting war against the common rights  
of men. The love of liberty is interwoven in the  
soul of man, ecan never be totally extinguished, &amp;  
there are certain periods whon human patience can  
no longer endure indignity and oppre-sion. The  
spark of liberty then kindles into a flame, when the  
injured people, attentive to the feelings of their just  
rights, magnanimousty contend for their complete  
restoration. But such contests have offen ended in  
nothing more than a change of impostors and impo­  
sitions.&quot; The patriots of Rome pat an end to the life  
of Coesar, and Rome submitted to a race of tyrants  
in his stead. Were the people of England free, af  
ter they had obliged King John to concede to thein-  
their ancient rights and liberties, and promised to  
govern them according to the old law of the land?  
Were they free, after they had wantonly deposed  
their Henrys, Edwards and Richards, to gratify fam­  
tly pride? Or, after they had brought their first  
Charles to the block and banished his family!  
They were not. The nation was then governed  
by King, Lords, and Commons; and its liberties were  
lost by a strife among three powers, soberly intend­  
ed to check each other and keep the scales even.  
&quot;But while we daily see the violence of the hu­  
man passions controlling the laws of reason and re­  
ligion, and stifling the very feelings of humanity,  
cun we wonder that, in such tumults, little or no  
regard is had to political checks and balances? And  
such tumults have always happened within, as well  
as withoul doors. The best formed constitutions  
that have yet been contrived by the wit of man,  
have and will come to an end, be­  
cause the kingdoms of the earth have not been  
governod by reason.&quot; The pride of kings, of nobles,  
and leaders of the People, who have all governed  
in their turns, have disadjusted the delicate frame,  
and thrown all into confusion.;  
 &quot;What, then, is to be done? Let divines and  
 philosophers, statesmen and patriots, unite their en­  
deavors to renovate the age--by impressing the  
minds of men with the importance of educating  
their little boys and girls--of inculcatingfin the mind  
of youth the fear and love of the Deity, and univer­  
sal philanthropy,--and, in subordination these great  
principles, the love of their connteg of instruet  
  
them in the art of self-government, without which  
they never can act a wise part in the Government  
of societies, great or small--in short, of leading the  
study and practice of the exalted virtues of the  
Christian system, which will happily tend to subdue  
the turbulent passions of men, and introduce that  
golden age, beautifully described in figurative lan­  
guage, when the wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and  
the leopard lie down with the kid- the cow and the  
bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down to­  
gether, and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.-  
None shall then hurt or destroy, for the earth shall  
be full of the knowledge of the Lord. When this  
millenium shall commence, if there shall be any  
need of civil government, indulge me in the fancy  
that it will be in the republican form or something  
better.
