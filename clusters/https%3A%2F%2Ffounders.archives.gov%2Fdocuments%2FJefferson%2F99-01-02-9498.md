My Children Depities of the Cherokees of the Upper &amp; lower Towns  
I understand, by the speeches which you have delivered Me, that there is a difference of disposition among the people of both parts of your Nation. Some of them desiring to remain on their lands, to betake themselves to Agriculture, and the industrious occupations of civilised life, while others, retaining their attachment to the hunter life, &amp; having little game on their present lands, are desirous to remove across the Mississippi, to some of the vacant lands of the U.S., where game is abundant I am pleased to find so many disposed to insure, by the cultivation of the earth, a plentiful subsistence to their families, &amp; to improve their minds by education: but I do not blame those who, having been brought up from their infancy to the pursuit of game, desire still to follow it to distant countries. I know how difficult it is for men to change the habits in which they have been raised. The U.S., my Children, are the friends of both parties, and, as far as can reasonably be asked, they will be willing to satisfy the wishes of both. those who remain may be assured of our patronage, our aid, &amp; good neighborhood. those who wish to remove, are permitted to send an exploring party to reconnoitre the country on the waters of the Arkansas &amp; White River, &amp; the higher up the better, as they will be the longer unapproached by our Settlements, which will begin at the mouths of those Rivers. the regular Districts of the Government of St. Louis are already laid off to the St. Francis. when this party shall have found a tract of country suiting the emigrants, &amp; not claimed by other Indians, we will arrange with them and you the exchange of that for a just portion of the country they leave, &amp; to a part of which proportioned to their numbers they have a right. every aid towards their removal, and what will be necessary for them there, will then be freely administered to them. and, when established in their new settlements, we shall still consider them as our children, give them the benefit of exchanging their peltries for what they will want at our factories, &amp; always hold them firmly by the hand.  
I will, now, my Children, proceed to answer your kind address on my retiring from the Government. sensible that I am become too old, to watch over the extensive concerns of the seventeen States, and their territories, I requested my fellow Citizens to permit me to retire, to live with my family, &amp; to chuse another President for themselves, and Father for you. they have done so: and in a short time I shall retire, &amp; resign into his hands the care of your, &amp; our concerns. be assured my Children that he will have the same friendly dispositions towards you which I have had, &amp; that you will find in him a true &amp; affectionate Father. indeed this is now the disposition of all our people towards you. they look upon you as brethren, born in the same land, and having the same interests. tell your people therefore to entertain no uneasiness on account of this Change, for there will be no change as to them. deliver to them my Adieux, and my prayers to the Great Spirit for their happiness. tell them that, during my administration, I have held their hand fast in mine, &amp; that I will put it into the hand of their new Father, who will hold it as I have done.

the President replied, January 9, 1809, that “those who wish  
to remove are permitted to send an exploring party to recon-  
noitre the country on the waters of the Arkansas and White  
Rivers, and the higher up the better, as they will be the  
longer unapproached by our settlements, which will begin at  
the mouths of those rivers,” and that “when this party shall  
have found a tract of country suiting the emigrants, and not  
claimed by other Indians, we will arrange with them and you  
the exchange of that for a just portion of the country they  
leave, and to a part of which, proportioned to their numbers,  
they have a right.”

who wished to remove, to send an ex­  
ploring party to reconnoitre the coun­  
try on the waters of the Arkansaw or  
White rivers; the higher up the better,  
as they will be the longer unapproached  
by our settlements, which will begin at  
the mouths of these rivers. The regu­  
lar districts of the Government of the  
United States were already laid off to  
the St. Francis. When these parties,  
said the President, shall have found a  
tract of country suiting the emigrants,  
and not claimed by other Indians, we  
will arrange with them, and give in ex­  
change that, for a just portion of the  
country they have, and to a part of  
which, proportioned to their numbers,  
they have a right.  
Every aid towards their removal, and  
what will be necessary for them to  
have, will then be freely administered  
to them, and when established in their  
new settlements, we shall still consider  
them as our children, give them the  
benefit of exchanging their peltries for  
what they will want of our factories,  
and always hold them&#x27; firmly by the  
baud. They explored the country ac  
cordicgly, on tho west 6ide of the Miss  
issippi, and made choice of thedountry  
on the Arkansaw and White rivers,  
and settled themselves down on the  
United States lands, to which no other  
tiibe of Indians have any just claim.  
They duly notified the President there­  
of, and of their anxious desire for the  
full and complete ratification of his  
promise, and sent on their agents to  
execute a tieaty. The nation of the
