Sir,  
						Department of State July 21st. 1808  
					  
					Herewith you will receive a copy of the papers relating to one of the vessels which were destroyed at sea by the French Frigates returning from the West Indies. I observe that in your letter to Mr. Champagny of the 2d. of April, you have incidentally  
						noticed this occurrence. If ample reparation should not have been made to the sufferers, the President thinks it proper that as their cases become authenticated, you should present them in terms which may awaken the French Government to the natures of the injury, and the  
						demands of justice. The burning of neutral vessels detained on the high seas is the most distressing of all the modes by which belligerents exert force contrary to right; and in proportion as it is destitute of apology, ought at least to be the promptitude and amplitude of  
						the redress. If it be contended that the destruction in these cases proceeded solely from the danger that otherwise intelligence might reach a pursuing or hovering force, it may be answered, that if such a plea were of greater avail, it would only disprove a hostility of  
						intention without diminishing the obligation to indemnify on the most liberal scale the injured individuals. It may be added that if the outrage on the individuals was not meant as a hostility towards their nation, the latter might justly expect a tender of such explanations  
						as would leave no doubt on this subject. I have the honor to be &amp;c

DliPAKTMEKT OF STATE, j  
&quot; July 21, 1805.  
Sir, - t  
i Herewith you will receive a copy of the pa­  
pers relating to one of the vessels which were  
destroyed at sea by the Frenchjfriga&#x27;es, return­  
ing from the West Indies. I observe that, in  
your letter to Mr. Champagny, of the 2d &#x27;of  
April, you have incidentally noticed this oc­  
currence. If ample reparation should not  
hive been made to the sufferers, the Presi­  
dent thinks &quot;it propsr tint, as their cases be­  
come authenticated, you should present them  
in terms which may awaken the French&quot; go­  
vernment to the nature of the ir.j iry and the  
demands of justice. The burning of neutral  
vessels&#x27;. detained on the hrgh seas, is the  
most distressing of aH the modes by which  
belligerents exert force contrary to right; and,  
in proportion as it is destitute of apology,  
ought at least to be the promptitude and am­  
plitude ofthe redress. If it be contended  
that the destruction,, in these cures, proceed  
ed solely from the danger tat otherwise in­  
telligence migh reach a pursuing or hovering  
force, it may be answered, tharif such a plea  
were of greater avail, it would ordy disprove  
a .hostility of intention, without diminishing  
the obligation to indemnify, on the most.  
1&#x27;beral scale, the injured individuals. It may  
be added, that if the outrage on the individu­  
als was not meant -as a hostility towards their  
nation, Jthe latter might justly expect a ten­
