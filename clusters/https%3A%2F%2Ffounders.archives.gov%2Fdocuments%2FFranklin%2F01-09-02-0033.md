t in Pensilvania.  
I will shortly send you a Copy of the Chapter you are pleas’d to mention in so obliging a Manner; and shall be extreamly oblig’d in receiving a Copy of the Collection of Maxims for the Conduct of Life, which you are preparing for the Use of your Children. I purpose, likewise, a little Work for the Benefit of Youth, to be call’d The Art of Virtue. From the Title I think you will hardly conjecture what the Nature of such a Book may be. I must therefore explain it a little. Many People lead bad Lives that would gladly lead good ones, but know not how to make the Change. They have frequently resolv’d and endeavour’d it; but in vain, because their Endeavours have not been properly conducted. To exhort People to be good, to be just, to be temperate, &amp;c. without shewing them how they shall become so, seems like the ineffectual Charity mention’d by the Apostle, which consisted in saying to the Hungry, the Cold, and the Naked, be ye fed, be ye warmed, be ye clothed, without shewing them how they should get Food, Fire or Clothing. Most People have naturally some Virtues, but none have naturally all the Virtues. To acquire those that are wanting, and secure what we acquire as well as those we have naturally, is the Subject of an Art. It is as properly an Art, as Painting, Navigation, or Architecture. If a Man would become a Painter, Navigator, or Architect, it is not enough that he is advised to be one, that he is convinc’d by the Arguments of his Adviser that it would be for his Advantage to be one, and that he resolves to be one, but he must also be taught the Principles of the Art, be shewn all the Methods of Working, and how to acquire the Habits of using properly all the Instruments; and thus regularly and gradually he arrives by Practice at some Perfection in the Art. If he does not proceed thus, he is apt to meet with Difficulties that discourage him, and make him drop the Pursuit. My Art of Virtue has also its Instruments, and teaches the Manner of Using them. Christians are directed to have Faith in Christ, as the effectual Means of obtaining the Change they desire. It may, when sufficiently strong, be effectual with many. A full Opinion that a Teacher is infinitely wise, good, and powerful, and that he will certainly reward and punish the Obedient and Disobedient, must give great Weight to his Precepts, and make them much more attended to by his Disciples. But all Men cannot have Faith in Christ; and many have it in so weak a Degree, that it does not produce the Effect. Our Art of Virtue may therefore be of great Service to those who have not Faith, and come in Aid of the weak Faith of others. Such as are naturally well-disposed, and have been carefully educated, so that good Habits have been early established, and bad ones prevented, have less Need of this Art; but all may be more or less benefited by it. It is, in short, to be adapted for universal Use. I imagine what I have now been writing will seem to savour of great Presumption; I must therefore speedily finish my little Piece, and communicate the Manuscript to you, that you may judge whether it is possible to make good such Pretensions. I shall at the same time hope for the Benefit of your Corrections.

“‘T purpose a little work, for the benefit  
of youth, to be entitled ‘The Art of  
Virtue’. Many people lead bad lives that  
would gladly lead good ones, but do not  
know how to make the change. Christians

effectual means of obtaining the change they

powerful, and that he will certainly re-  
ward the obedient and punish the dis-

precepts. But many have this faith in so

he claimed, did not instruct and indicate the means, but  
was like the apostle’s man of verbal charity, who admon-  
ished the naked and the hungry to be clothed and fed withal,  
but vouchsafed no information as to where the clothes were  
to be had or how the food was to be forthcoming.  
  
In a letter to Lord Kames as early as 1760, he asserted  
that many people led bad lives who would gladly lead good  
ones but did not know how to make the change. That to  
acquire virtue was as properly an art as painting, navigation,

a painter, navigator, or architect, it is not enough that he  
is advised to be one, that he is convinced by the arguments  
of his adviser that it would be for his advantage to be one,  
and that he resolves to be one; but he must be taught the  
principles of the art, be shown all the methods of work-  
ing, and how to acquire the habit of using properly all the  
instruments.’’ As for himself, he aspired to no less than the  
attainment of human perfection, and in his autobiography  
he takes the reader into his confidence as to the methods  
devised to accomplish it. There is nothing in all literature  
which compares with the philosophical naiveté of these dis-  
closures. There have been memoirs galore, giving the  
‘‘reflections,’’ the ‘‘ reveries,’’ the ‘‘ meditations,’’ the ‘‘ mus-

clothed” without showing them how they should  
get food, fire and clothing.
