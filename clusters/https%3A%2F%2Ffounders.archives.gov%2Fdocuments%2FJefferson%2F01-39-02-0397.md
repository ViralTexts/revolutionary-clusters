A striking example of this proper rule of  
conduct is found in the recently published  
diary of Thomas JeeFerson, the original  
of which is one of the treasures of Mr. Til  
Den&#x27;s library  
During Mr. JeFFersos&#x27;s first term as  
President he purchased two hundred bottles  
of wine from the Spanish Minister at Wash­  
ington. Under the diplomatic privilege of the  
Minister, this wine was brought in free of  
duty. Mr. Jerperson was aware of this fact  
and he wrote to Genr Muhleneeng, then Col­  
lector of the port of Philadelphia, informing  
him of the circumstances and saying  
I must therefore ask the favor of you to take the
