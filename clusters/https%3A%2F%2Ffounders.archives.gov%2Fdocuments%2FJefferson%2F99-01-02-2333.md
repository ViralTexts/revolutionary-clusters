To the  
People of the  
United States of America.  
Syracuse 1st. Septr. 1805.  
  
It is known to the whole world that the reigning Bashaw of Tripoli, Jusuf, obtained the Throne by the Murder of our Father and Elder brother and by my exile, who came next in succession. Driven by his impious and cruel usurpation, I took refuge in Egypt where I was kindly received by the Mameluke Beys, who gave me a distinguished rank in the military service. Reposing in the security of peace, I had ceased to repine for the loss of my Throne, and regretted only the lot of my unhappy Subjects, doomed to the yoke of my cruel and tyranical brother.  
It was at this Epoch, that the arrival of General Eaton gave me hopes of better fortune, and tho’ I could not tell what were his powers, I trusted to the faith of a great people, of whom he was the ostensible representative, and threw myself into his arms. We concluded a Treaty at Alexandria, a copy of which is among the papers of Commodore Barron in the custody of his Secretary Mr. Robert Denison. This treaty not only stipulates the recovery of the Throne for me, but also includes several advantageous articles for the United States, for which Genl. Eaton will be my Voucher; ought I then to suppose that the engagements of  an American Agent would be disputed by his constituent Government? I cannot suppose that a Gentleman has pledged towards me the honor of his Country on purpose to deceive me!  
General Eaton and myself with our joint followers had already advanced 600 miles into the Kingdom of Tripoli; and a general defection had seized my brothers army, and all things prepared the protected of America to be hailed Sovereign of his usurped Throne. At this juncture a peace is concluded in which a Throne, acquired by rapine &amp; murder, is guaranteed to its usurper, and I the rightful Sovereign, the friend and ally of America, am left unprovided for. No article in my favor, no provision for me and my family, and no remuneration for the advantages I had foregone in trusting to American honor. I am left in Syracuse with 30 dependents, on the pittance of two hundred Dollars per Month and no prospect of future establishment. What with the expences of my retinue &amp;c. &amp;c. I, a Sovereign Prince, am now reduced to the pension of 150 Cents per day.  
I must here observe that Mr. Eaton, whose generosity I cannot sufficiently praise, has assisted me from his own finances, else hard indeed had been my lot.   
When the prevalence of ages has accustomed men to the Government of one, the right of a Throne enters into the System of human thoughts, and that usage must have its rights like others.  
In this situation I appeal to the Virtue, generosity and candour of the people and government of America. I trust that a brave and free Nation will interest itself in behalf of a fallen Prince, who has trusted to its national honor and good faith. I trust the Government will take my case into consideration and at least send me back to Egypt indemnified for those comforts lost by uniting my fortune to theirs, and I am confident the American People will feel for the misfortunes of one, who has fought in the united cause of their interest and his own right.

It h known to the whole world that  
Hie reigning Bashaw ef Tripoli, Jussuf,_  
obtained tile throne by the murder of  
our I&#x27;-.;&#x27;.her and elder brother, and by  
my exile, who came next m succession.  
Driven by bislropiuus and cruel usurpa­  
tion, 11-&gt;&lt; &#x27; in Egypt, wh«  
eived by the Mameluke  
beys, whogave me a distinguished rank  
mile , service. Reposing in

gretted only the lot of my uuh.ppy sub­  
jects, dooosed to the yoke ot my cruel  
anil tyrannical brother.  
It was at this epoch, that the arrival  
of general Eaton gave me hopes of bet­  
ter&#x27;fortune ; and though 1 could not  
tell what were his powers, 1 trusted to  
the faith of a great people, of whom he  
was the bstCttfcinl* representative, and  
threw myself into his &#x27;arms. We con­  
cluded a&#x27;trcaty at Alexandria, a ropy of  
which is amorg the papers of Commo­  
dore Barron, iv the custody of his se­

treaty &#x27;not only stipulates the recovery

several a as articles for the  
United States, for Which Gen. Eaton  
&#x27;Will be my voucher. Ought I then to  
htt the engagements of an A­  
merican agent would be disputed, by his  
&#x27;ltucnt government I I cannot sup­  
that a gentleman has pledged U&gt;­  
1b me the honor of ids country on  
purpose to t!o( eive me.  
Gei nd myself, with our joint  
followers, had atready advanced COO

the rightful sovereign, the friend and  
ally of A m erica, am left unprovided for.  
No article in my favor, no provision for

I mu#t here observe, that Mr. Eaton,  
who &#x27; ity I cannot sufficieritly  
is assisted me from his own  
finances, else hard indeed had been my  
lot.  
Wrhen the prevalence of ages has ac­  
customed men to the government of j  
one, the right of a throne enters into the .  
system of human thoughts, and that v- ;  
sage must have its rights like others.  
In this situation, I appeal to the vir- j

It was at this epoch, that the arrival of General  
Eaton me hopes of better fortune; and  
though I could not tell what were his powers, I  
trusted to the faith of a great people, of whom he  
was the ostensible representative, and threw mysclf  
mto his arms. Weconcluded a treaty at Alexan-  
dria, acopy of which is among the papers of Com-  
modore Barron, in the custody of his secretary Mr.  
Denison. . This treaty not only stipulates the recov-  
ery of the throne tor me, but also includes several  
advantageous articles for the United States, tor  
which General Eaton will be my voucher. Ought  
I then to suppose that the engagements of an Amer-  
ican agent would be disputed by his constituent gov-  
ernment? I cannot suppose thata gentleman has  
pledged towards me the honor of his country on pur-  
  
ose todeceive me.  
  
General Eaton and myself with our joint follow-  
ers, had already advanced 600 miles into the Fing-  
dom of Tripoli; and a general defecthon had seized  
my brother’s army, and all things prepared the pro-  
tected of America to be hailed. sovereign of his usur-  
vei throne. At this junctpre a peace 1s concluded,  
in which a throne, acquiréd by rapine and murder,  
is guaranteed to its usurper, and I, the rightful sov-  
reign, the friend and ally of America, am left un-  
wovided for. Noarticle in my favor, no provis-  
ion for me and my family, and no remuneration  
for theadvantages [ had foregone in trusting to A-  
merican honor. J am left in Syracuse with thirty  
dependents, on the pittance of two hundred dollars  
per month, and no prospect of future establishment.  
What with the expences of my retinue, &amp;c, &amp;c. I,  
2 sovereign prince, am now reduced to the pension  
of 1450 cents per day.  
  
I must here observe, that Mr. Eaton, whose gen-  
erosity I ca not sufficiently praise, has assisted me  
from his own finances, else hard indeed had been  
my lot.  
  
When the prevalence of ages has accustomed  
mento the government of one, the right of a  
throne enters into the system of human thoughts,  
and that usage must have its’right like others.  
  
In this situation I appeal to tie virtue, generosity  
and candor of the people and government of Ameri-  
ica. I trust that a brave and free nation will inter-  
est itself in behalf of a fallen prince, wine has trust-  
ed to its national honor and good faith. I trust the  
government will take my case into consideration, &amp;  
at least send me back into Egypt, indemnified for  
those comfortstost by uniting my fortune to theirs ;  
antl Lam confident the American people wil) feel  
for the misfortunes of one, who has.tourht in the  
united cause of their interest, and his own right.
